# Git Test 4

## Van Gogh 
I chose the Van Gogh project and the focus of the project was to discover if Van Gogh's adversity had caused his large amount of productivity and the last two years of his life. The project team decided to look at letters between Van Gogh and his brother. They decided to do this because of how close he and his brother were so they could learn about how he was feeling during the two-year stretch. What I really like about this project is how clean it is visually. I like how the color palette that the project team chose matched the Van Gogh paintings that they displayed on their website.

## Hamilton
The goal of this project was to analyze the song lyrics to further understand US History, characters, and the story. I really enjoy the colors used in this project, but in the graphics tab, I think the pictures could be bigger as it's hard to read the graphs. There is a lot of empty space. This might just be a me thing, but if the text was a bit bigger or even thicker, it would be easier to read.
