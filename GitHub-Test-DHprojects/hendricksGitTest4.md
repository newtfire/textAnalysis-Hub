# Vincent van Gogh Response

by Kat Hendricks
- This project team chose to analyze Vincent van Gogh and the letters he sent to his brother Theo. They believed in order to truly understand him and his personal life that these letters would help them reveal valuable information considering the two were so close during their lifetime. The first and main question this team analyzed is “Who was Vincent van Gogh?” This question and response are found at the beginning of the team's ‘About’ page. Below is a paragraph talking about their research methods and how/why they chose to analyze the letters for their project. Aside from their topic and research methods, the team added some amazing visualizations to their project. The ‘Home’ and ‘About’ pages have pictures of the art that Vincent van Gogh produced in his lifetime as an artist. Then their ‘Topic Modeling’ page has a number of charts and models that show different information on the topic. Overall, the project is very well put together and you can tell they put a lot of effort into the making of the website.
