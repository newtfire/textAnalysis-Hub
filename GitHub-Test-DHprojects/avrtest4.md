# Git Test 4

In the Tarantino profanity project, the students focused on looking into frequency of swear words and slurs used by characters of different genders in 3 of Tarantino's movies.
The 3 main predictions they made were that men would swear more, they would swear even more than usual when conversing with other men, and women would swear less overall.
To analyze this profanity usage they created two separate categories, one for regular curse words and the other for slurs.
Afterwards, they made sure that any variations of the words in their profanity word bank would be properly sorted into on of the preexisting categories.
Then, to make all of the data presentable they were able to generate graphs of the results using xslt.
