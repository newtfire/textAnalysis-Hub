### Van Gogh "Tortured Genius"

By Felipe Bassi

The Van Gogh, *"Tortured Genius"* project goal was to understand whether Van Gogh's remarkableworks were due to his mental and personal issues or what exactly was the secret of one of the greatest artists of all time.

The main tool to visualize all the texts they use for this research was **MALLET**. **MALLET** is a software that basically organizes, classifies, models and clusters text, and it is used by many researches for this purpose. Another very important software was **Excel**, which was mainly used for visualization of the data gathered.
