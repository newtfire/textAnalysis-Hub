# K-Pop Songs, Translations, and Profiles Discussion

In this project, the features were really well organized. The mechanic I really liked was for the menu bar at the top. If you mouse over the tabs "Group Profiles" and "Songs", a little mini menu shows up of stuff you will find within the tab. It's very user friendly in that regard and I really liked that feature. I also noticed that if you press "Group Profiles" for example, a bunch of options show up. When you put your mouse over them, the visualization of the option lights up.

I think that the research question they mainly focused on is "What is K-Pop?" They had researched a lot of information about the 10 most popular, international K-Pop groups. They showed songs written by the K-Pop groups as well as created a profile for each group so that the user would be able to get to know the people behind the music.
