# textAnalysis-Hub
shared repo for the Text Analysis class at Penn State Erie, The Behend College.

Welcome to the textAnalysis-Hub! This is a repository to help introduce and orient DIGIT students to the GitHub collaboration environment, and accompanies the course website posted at <https://newtfire.org/courses/textAnalysis/>

In order for you to participate fully in this shared class space, I need to add you as a collaborator. [Set up your own GitHub account](https://github.com) and write to me to tell me how to find you.

Now that you're here, you should try to "clone" this repository on your local computer.

Here is a quick and handy list of git commands: <https://github.com/newtfire/textAnalysis-Hub/blob/master/GitCommands.md>
You can read our detailed guide to get started with Git (or just use this as we do, like a reference to search in for information): <https://newtfire.org/courses/tutorials/explainGitShell.html>

When you have set up an account and have installed the git tools (Mac/Linux) or Git Bash shell (Windows) locally on your computer, you are ready to experiment with git commands. Always be sure to sync your local folder to receive any changes pushed to this GitHub repository. At command line, that means, issue a **"git pull"** (or a "git fetch" and "git merge") command to retrieve changes to the directories from the cloud *before* you begin working. Always sync your local directory with our cloud directory here on the web when you begin work, and when you conclude work at a local computer.

When you are ready to make changes (adding, deleting, moving files), you will go through the sequence of **git add**, **git commit -m "...."**, and **git push**.  Save a file in your local folder (or the "clone" of this repository), and then use your GitHub client to "push" a file into this online collaboration space. To do this, first **commit** your changes and write the required commit message. Then you must **push** in order to sync these changes to the GitHub cloud.

There are things we will do together only in the remote webpage view of GitHub visible at <https://github.com/newtfire/textAnalysis-Hub/>:
*  See if you can find the "Issues" area by mousing over the icons on the top (in the new view) or the right-hand (old view) side of the GitHub page: "Issues" is the exclamation point inside the circle. We're using the "Issues" page to open conversations about questions, problems, things we need to discuss and fix and work on together. 
* If we formulate a new method or policy we definitely want to follow, we'll post a Wiki page about it. (Find the Wiki area, the icon that looks like a book.) The Issues and Wikis are searchable, and you write in them using markdown syntax, which lets you easily and quickly format headings, lists, bold, italics, or share an image.
