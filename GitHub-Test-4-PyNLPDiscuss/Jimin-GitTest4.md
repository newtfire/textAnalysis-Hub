# Discussion: Intro to Python for Humanists Sections

I found Social Network Analysis to be very fascinating. I think it’s because it’s a familiar topic for me by taking a Social Media Management course and a Data Analytics course this semester. From both of the courses, the common factor of how we focus on the relationship and the connection of each data drew my attention to this method more than the others. Since I’ve always been interested in how all social media insights work with connections, I would love to study how the connections suggest the “potential mutual account” that you might know in person on social media. With the limited dataset, I want to see how the backend of AI figures out the “potential mutual account” and suggests it to the user. I would need a lot of different resources to do this study, such as User profile information that includes basic demographic information, and user activity data that includes data on how frequently users interact with the platform based on what kind of content they engage, and how they interact with other users. Lastly, the Social network data includes information about users’ connections to other users on the platform, such as their friends, followers, and the accounts they interact with most frequently. I didn’t have the texts yet, but I found this link that might be useful for later.
