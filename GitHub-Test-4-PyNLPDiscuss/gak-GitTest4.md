# I am interested in topic modeling.
## I like the idea of finding "hidden themes" within text.
### One concern about it that the book addresses is that we could potentially misinterpret certain words and patterns and make false inferences about the text as a result.
#### I suppose that makes topic modeling somewhat subjective.

<p> It might be interesting to perform topic modeling on a movie or video game script for a project. 
I have started collecting <a href="https://github.com/gak5275/GK-HonorsProject/tree/main/gamescripts">game scripts</a> on one of my GitHub repos to potentially 
use for a project involving NLP. 
I know past DIGIT projects have done this, so it would be cool to do one of my own.</p>
```

I tried to create a link to my [game script list on GitHub](https://github.com/gak5275/GK-HonorsProject/tree/main/gamescripts) in the code block, but it didn't work.
