# GitHub Test 4: Post your comments on the Mattingly Python NLP reading

This directory is here, in the `GitHub-Test-4-PyNLPDiscuss` directory, to hold your files for **Part 4** of the GitHub Test. 
To proceed with completing this portion of the test:

1. Check what branch you are in on your local computer's clone of this textAnalysis-Hub.
1. Make your way to the main branch (if you are not already there) using the appropriate git commands. 
1. Use the appropriate git command to update the main branch and pull in this folder.
1. Then create a new branch (using the appropriate git command) Name the branch with your name, a hyphen, and GitTest4, like this: `ebeshero-GitTest4`
1. Save the markdown file you have written (according to the test instructions) into **this folder** (GitHub-Test-4-PyNLPDiscuss) in the repo. For the purposes of our exam, you can write whatever you wish but the markdown must contain *at least one heading* and *at least one codeblock*. Practice writing in markdown, which is used for easily readable documentation on GitHub. Work with [GitHub's Markdown Tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) to prepare a file. 
1. Push your branch to the remote repo and issue a new pull request asking me (@ebeshero) to merge your branch into the main branch.
