# GitHub Test 4

Not gonna lie, I thought that the reading was pretty confusing, but I did put together that there is a lot of potential that spaCy and python provide to text analysis. 
I am interested in EntityRuler and Social Network Analysis because they visualize the data better to me. I am more of a visual learner, so I like creating models for 
better understanding. I like EntityRuler because it gives simple results like "this = that." I like Social Network Analysis because it can literally visualize 
connections. It's almost like the Kumu.io website we used in Digit 110 but made from scratch. Also a special mention to Topic Modeling where nlp will strain all the 
"topic" words out to use in different scenarios. I am a part of the Digital Mitford Project and might be interested in analizing a bunch of Mary Mitford's letters.
Here is the link to access the [letters](https://digitalmitford.org//lettersInterface.php).
