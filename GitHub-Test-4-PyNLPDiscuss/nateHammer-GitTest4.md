## NLP Discussion Post
Overall, I think I understand how the NLP workflow will go. Loading a DOC and tokenization. Grouping sentences with SBD and other neat features. However, how exactly NLP and Pipelines work is EntityRulers is a little confusing. Topic modeling is a very interesting aspect of NLP that I would really would like to explore. In the document, they describe Bigrams and Trigrams which are used to teach the machine how certain combination of words are interpreted. I would like to look into academic articles and historical documents to see if there is some kind of hidden bias. 
[Declaration of Independence transcript](https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/declaration-transcriptLinks/) may be an interesting text to analyze.
