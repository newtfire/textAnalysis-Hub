    Question 1

    What I find interesting about NLP is the large volume of textual data, I am curious as to how it measures a human idea and determines what is important.

    Question2

    I find pandas fascinating and something I'd be interested in trying in a class project.

    Question3

    I would like to try pandas out on a historical book from different countries to what data could be extracted.
