<p> A few interesting things that stood out to me while reading is the discussion about the construction of a reliable data set for the holocaust experiment and Topic modeling. The holocaust portion of the reading walks readers through constructing a data set from scratch if one did not exist like in the case of the holocaust study. This really drives home the importance of having a reliable data set before even starting any kind of work or analysis with it. Topic modeling is interesting because it seems to be an alternative to text classification in the event that we dont already have a good idea of topics or "themes" within text to look for. I am a huge fan of starwars and I think doing an analysis of some sort with all of the scripts would be fun. I even found an already complete data set of the scripts!<p>
