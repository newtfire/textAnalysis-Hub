Before we start, I forgot to put a codeblock in my last mardown file, so here is a code block:

## Questions 
1. Bigrams and Trigrams Interest
     - Bigrams and Trigrams really stuck out to me as interesting forms of modeling because it gives the concept of NLP a more visualized sense, which makes it easier to understand for me. It reminded me of vendiagrams that we would do in school, however it is just for a word rather than topics. I am just curious how computers would read these. I understand there is a part about overlapping data with the words, but how? Does it access a database of word meaning and hundreds of instances of word usage to understand what a particular instance of a specific word means?
2. One To Work With
     - Bigrams a Trigrams really are the ones I would like the work with because of the visualization aspect. I can actually visualize how words are related and link libraries of word usage to them. The other ones I just have a hard time wrapping my brain around, this one just makes the most sense to me.
     
3. Future Project
     - I would want to analyze Warrior Cats again, as that seems to be the theme for any of my text analysis work. I would want to see how names are used again, but this time is it because the character is speaking, or is it in passing as another character is referencing them?
     - Or I could do a social media analysis to see how frequently certain words are used among different political alignments, along with a general positive or negative connotation being associated with them. I am uncertain what to really link here, I was thinking of just looking at Tweets and charting behavioral patterns, I really enjoyed that part of the reading. I also do not really want to go out of my way to look for nasty tweets at this moment, let along link them for others to see.
