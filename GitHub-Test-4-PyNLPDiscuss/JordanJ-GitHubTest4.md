# GitHub Test 4 


This is my response from the reading 

1. Based off of the readings I found it interesting that sorting and creating patterns can help people remember. I'm curious about what the limits of matching and patterns are in NLP. One area that I am interested in Sentiment Analysis in the context of determining whether data is positive, negative or neutral, this keeps tracks of textural data  and allow businesses to track and analyze customers responses.

 2. The pipe component really interested me. It is the component of a pipeline, the purpose of the pipeline is to take data input and perform a set of operations on that input data, then take the output either as new data or extracted metadata. The pipe component is used for the pipeline that tokenizes the text into individual tokens. 

 3. The website that I will be referencing a lot will be a collection of Lore the video game franchise Destiny. [Here] (https://www.ishtar-collective.net)
