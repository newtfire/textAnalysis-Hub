## NLP Discussion


* A Method of NLP that I am interested in is **Topic Modeling** because it is used organize text based on common themes or ideas and analyzing the content of a text. I think this is interesting because I like the idea of detecting common themes in similar pieces of texts. 
* I think **Topic Modeling** would be interesting for the class to look at. 
* Something I want to look at with **Topic Modeling** is comparing the idea's and themes of song lyrics from a site like [Genius](https://genius.com/) against songs generated by [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/) in the style of the same musician.
