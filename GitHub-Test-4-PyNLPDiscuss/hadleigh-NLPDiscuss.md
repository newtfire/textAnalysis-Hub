I personally really enjoyed reading about the Matcher and PhraseMatcher MLP methods. I am a big fan of digitally organizing things, so any way I can figure out how to organize something better or in another way, I am interested. I could organize congressional bills and/or supreme court cases since I find American Government fascinating and want to make it easier to understand what the government does and/or is doing. I loved taking AP Gov my senior year, but I often found it difficult to read large texts. I feel that organization of these would help not only me, but other people interested in Government and Politics.
