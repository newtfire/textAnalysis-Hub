Simply put, NLP is confusing...and i dont think I am the only one that feels this way. After going through this reading, I was able to say multiple areas that can and should be used while using Python however, it takes time to understand it all. I wanted to say that for loops interest me from this reading. I think these are pretty straight forward however, why is it used to mainly modify data? In addition, I am interested in trying out pandas in class or in a project being that they look pretty cool for charts and other things that could be used almost like an Excel file. I want to test NLP on some examples listed below and see how it is handled afterwards. 

- anime scripts
- modern songs
- youtube video subtitles/transcripts

This is some sample text I was thinking of using:
