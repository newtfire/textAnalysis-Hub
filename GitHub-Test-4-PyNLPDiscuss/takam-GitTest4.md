# GitHub Test 4
- From the reading, I was fairly interested in learning about creating patterns. I found that it was a helpful way of processing information based off of a text. I'm really curious about what the limits of Matching and Patterns are. It would be interesting to discover how many words can be categorized in ways that perform different tasks. Simply finding proper nouns and the sort seems to be useful, but not groundbreaking, at least to me.

- I think it would be beneficial to explore how matching can be used to find different kinds of literary devices to help us or maybe even NLP understand different kinds of texts. In a project in class, it might be cool to analyze different literary works, songs, poems, scripts, etc. in order to categorize strings of words as metaphors, similes, or the like.

- As for examples of this, I think music lyrics benefit the most, and classmates usually like to incorporate their music into a project they can be attached to, so I think using resources such as [genius.com](genius.com) Links to an external site.for music would be beneficial. Alternatively, using scripts for tv and movies could also be fun, and these can be found on sites like [This](https://tvshowtranscripts.ourboard.org/).
