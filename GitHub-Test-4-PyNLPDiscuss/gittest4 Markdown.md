# Question 1

1. NLP has always intrigued me, and I am particularly drawn to using it to interpret text and gain meaningful insights. One area I am interested in is sentiment analysis. This area allows businesses to track and analyze the customersâ€™ responses and perceptions on their brands. Additionally, I am interested in the idea of creating automated translations, which could be a great help in tackling language barriers. I am curious to find out more about the capabilities of NLP and the potential applications it has.

# Question 2

2. Natural language processing is one of the sentiment analysis areas that I am much interested in and I will learn more about it because my class is trying it. Innovative methods are being explored, and I am excited to discover what can be achieved. Doing trials with numerous NLP approaches can be a valuable learning experience for the students. We can take the knowledge gained from such experiments to investigate and create novel applications of NLP in the future. This analysis is used for various purposes, such as customer feedback examination, opinion mining, and social media analytics. The purpose is to find out the author's attitude or the text's opinion to help companies or organizations make better decisions.

# Question 3

3. Sentiment analysis techniques can be assessed on multiple texts, such as novels, movies, reviews, blog pieces, articles, and social media messages (Wankhade et al., 2022). Moreover, it can be used in social media posts, chatbots, virtual assistants, and news articles where people can express their sentiments. Through the use of sentiment analysis, firms can acquire an understanding of customer sentiment and enhance customer satisfaction. Additionally, it may be used to identify sentimental patterns and produce insights that aid in decision-making.
