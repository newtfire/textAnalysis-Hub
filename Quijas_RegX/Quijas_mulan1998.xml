<p> the summer of 1998 when the film originally aired.] <\p> 

<p> [Chinese guard is seen walking on The Great Wall.  Shan-Yu's falcon swoops <\p> 
<p> down and hits the guard on the head knocking his helmet off.  The falcon lands <\p> 
<p> on top of a flag pole in front of a full moon and lets out a large cry.  One <\p> 
<p> grappling hook comes over The Great Wall.  The guard walks over to the edge <\p> 
<p> and sees many grappling hooks coming towards him] <\p> 

<p> Guard [yelling]:  We're under attack!  Light the signal! <\p> 

<p> [Guard runs to the tower and up the ladder as Hun Bald Man #1 and Hun Long <\p> 
<p> Hair Man appear trying to stop him.  Hun Bald Man #1 breaks the ladder with <\p> 
<p> his sword just as Guard reaches the top.  The guard picks up the torch to <\p> 
<p> light the fire and sees Shan-Yu jump over the edge of the tower and looks at <\p> 
<p> him across from the caldron.  The guard throws the torch into the caldron <\p> 
<p> lighting a large fire.  Shan-Yu watches as each tower lights their caldrons <\p> 
<p> one by one] <\p> 

<p> Guard [sternly]:  Now all of China knows you're here. <\p> 

<p> Shan-Yu [taking the flag and holding it over the fire]:  Perfect. <\p> 

<p> [Cut to the palace.  The large doors to the central chamber open as General Li <\p> 
<p> walks in flanked on his left and right by soldiers and approaches the Emperor.  <\p> 
<p> He bows, then looks up] <\p> 

<p> General Li:  Your Majesty, the Huns have crossed our Northern border. <\p> 

<p> Chi Fu:  Impossible! No one can get through The Great Wall.  [The Emperor <\p> 
<p> motions for Chi Fu's silence] <\p> 

<p> General Li:  Shun-Yu is leading them.  We'll set up defenses around your <\p> 
<p> palace immediately. <\p> 

<p> Emperor [forcefully]:  No!  Send your troops to protect my people.  Chi Fu,  <\p> 

<p> Chi Fu:  Yes, your highness. <\p> 

<p> Emperor: Deliver conscription notices throughout all the provinces.  Call up <\p> 
<p> reserves and as many new recruits as possible. <\p> 

<p> General Li:  Forgive me your Majesty, but I believe my troops can stop him. <\p> 

<p> Emperor:  I wont take any chances, General.  A single grain of rice can tip <\p> 
<p> the scale.  One man may be the difference between victory and defeat. <\p> 

<p> [Cut to Mulan using her chopsticks to single out a grain of rice on top of the <\p> 
<p> mound of rice] <\p> 

<p> Mulan: Quiet and demure...graceful...polite...[picking up some rice with her <\p> 
<p> chopsticks and eating a mouthful] delicate...refined...poised... [She sets <\p> 
<p> down her chopsticks and writes down a final word on her right arm] punctual. <\p> 
<p> [A cock crows]  Aiya.  [Calling out]  Little brother. Little brother.  Lit- <\p> 
<p> ahhh, there you are.  Who's the smartest doggie in the world?  Come on smart <\p> 
<p> boy, can you help me with my chores today? <\p> 

<p> [Mulan ties a sack of grain around Little Brother's waist.  She ties a stick <\p> 
<p> onto Little brother so that end of it is in front of Little Brother's face.  <\p> 
<p> She ties the bone on the end of the stick just out of reach.  Little Brother <\p> 
<p> begins to run after the bone which he cannot reach.  Mulan opens the door for <\p> 
<p> Little Brother and he runs into the door frame, then out the open door.  <\p> 
<p> Little brother runs by the chickens and Khan - the family horse] <\p> 

<p> [Cut to Mulan's Father, Fa Zhou, kneeling and praying before the Fa family's <\p> 
<p> ancestors] <\p> 

<p> Fa Zhou:  Honorable ancestors, please help Mulan impress the matchmaker today.  <\p> 
<p> Little Brother [running into the temple and around Fa Zhou scattering grain <\p> 
<p> around the floor]: Bark, bark, bark, bark, bark. <\p> 

<p> [The chickens follow Little Brother into the temple and begin to feed on the <\p> 
<p> grain] <\p> 

<p> Fa Zhou:  Please, PLEASE, help her. <\p> 

<p> [Mulan steps up to the temple seeing Little Brother on his hind legs trying to <\p> 
<p> get the bone.  Mulan bends the stick down so that Little brother can reach the <\p> 
<p> bone.  Little brother gnaws on the bone happily.  Mulan continues toward the <\p> 
<p> temple] <\p> 

<p> Mulan [calling out]: Father I brought your--whoop!  [Fa Zhou bumps into Mulan.  <\p> 
<p> The cup falls to the ground and Fa Zhou catches the teapot with the handle of <\p> 
<p> his cane] <\p> 

<p> Fa Zhou:  Mulan-- <\p> 

<p> Mulan:  I brought a spare. [Mulan pulls out a cup from underneath the back of <\p> 
<p> her dress and begins to pour the tea]   <\p> 

<p> Fa Zhou:  Mulan-- <\p> 

<p> Mulan [hurried]: Remember, the doctor said three cups of tea in the morning-- <\p> 

<p> Fa Zhou:  Mulan-- <\p> 

<p> Mulan:  And three at night.  <\p> 

<p> Fa Zhou:  Mulan, you should already be in town.  We're counting on you to up-- <\p> 

<p> Mulan:  --uphold the family honor.  Don't worry father.  I wont let you down.  <\p> 
<p> [Mulan covers over the writing on her arm with here sleeve]  Wish me luck.  <\p> 
<p> [Mulan hurries down the stairs] <\p> 

<p> Fa Zhou [calling out]:  Hurry!  [to himself] I'm going to...pray some more. <\p> 
<p> [Fa Zhou turns and walks back into the temple] <\p> 

<p> [Cut to the town with Fa Li looking worried] <\p> 

<p> Bath Lady [poking out of her building]:  Fa Li, is your daughter here yet?  <\p> 
<p> The matchmaker is not a patient woman.  [She goes back into the building] <\p> 

<p> Fa Li:  Of all days to be late.  I should have prayed to the ancestors for <\p> 
<p> luck. <\p> 

<p> Grandma Fa [walking in with a Cri-Kee in a cage]:  How lucky can they be, <\p> 
<p> they're dead.  Besides,  I've got all the luck we'll need.  [Speaking to <\p> 
<p> Cri-Kee]  This is your chance to prove yourself.  [Cri-Kee chirps approvingly.  <\p> 
<p> Grandma Fa covers her eyes steps into a busy street] <\p> 

<p> Fa Li [excitedly]:  Grandma No! <\p> 

<p> [The traffic barely misses Grandma Fa as she crosses the busy street.  But two <\p> 
<p> horse and carriage collide causing a big accident.  She arrives at the other <\p> 
<p> side of the street, uncovers here eyes and looks at Cri-Kee] <\p> 

<p> Grandma Fa:  Yep, this cricket's a lucky one. [Cri-Kee falls over out of <\p> 
<p> fright] <\p> 

<p> Fa Li [sighing in relief]:  Hai. <\p> 

<p> [Mulan arrives on Khan jumping over the recent accident in the street and <\p> 
<p> jumps off with hay stuck in her hair] <\p> 

<p> Mulan: I'm here.  [Seeing a stern look from her mother] What?  But Mama I had <\p> 
<p> to-- <\p> 

<p> Fa Li:  None of your 'xcuses.  Now let's get you cleaned up. [They walk <\p> 
<p> together into the preparation area] <\p> 

<p> [Song: Honor to us all] <\p> 

<p> Bath Lady:  [all the while Bath Lady undresses Mulan and pushes her into the <\p> 
<p> Bath] <\p> 
<p> This is what you give me  <\p> 
<p> to work with? <\p> 
<p> Well, honey, I've seen worse. <\p> 
<p> We're gonna turn  <\p> 
<p> this sow's ear <\p> 
<p> Into a silk purse. [Bath Lady moves the silk partition aside showing Mulan in <\p> 
<p> the bath]  <\p> 

<p> Mulan [spoken]:  It's freezing. <\p> 

<p> Fa Li [spoken]:  It would have been warm if you were here on time.   <\p> 

<p> Bath Lady [washing Mulan's hair]: <\p> 
<p> We'll have you <\p> 
<p> Washed and dried <\p> 
<p> Primped and polished  <\p> 
<p> till you glow with pride <\p> 
<p> Trust my recipe for  <\p> 
<p> instant bride <\p> 
<p> You'll bring honor to us all <\p> 

<p> Fa Li [grabbing a sponge and Mulan's right arm to start cleaning her.  She <\p> 
<p> notices the writing] [spoken]:  Mulan, what's this? <\p> 

<p> Mulan [Drawing her arm back and batting her eyelashes] [spoken]:  Ahh, notes, <\p> 
<p> in case I forget something? <\p> 

<p> Grandma Fa [spoken]:  Here, hold this [hands the cricket to Fa Li].  We'll <\p> 
<p> need more luck than I thought.  [Mulan looks on with an air of disappointment] <\p> 

<p> [Cut to the hair dressers] <\p> 

<p> Hair Dresser 1 [Brushing and combing Mulan's hair much to Mulan's chagrin]: <\p> 
<p> Wait and see <\p> 
<p> When we're through <\p> 

<p> Hair Dresser 2: <\p> 
<p> Boys will gladly go to  <\p> 
<p> war for you <\p> 

<p> Hair Dresser 1: <\p> 
<p> With good fortune  <\p> 

<p> Hair Dresser 2 [Finalizing the hairdo to look exactly like hers]: <\p> 
<p> And a great hairdo <\p> 

<p> Both: <\p> 
<p> You'll bring honor to us all <\p> 

<p> Fa Li and others:  [Mulan following her Mother passes a xiangqi game and <\p> 
<p> pauses to make an impressive move.  Mulan has a smug look on her face when Fa <\p> 
<p> Li comes back and drags Mulan away] <\p> 
<p> A girl can bring her family <\p> 
<p> Great honor in one way <\p> 
<p> By striking a good match <\p> 
<p> And this could be the day <\p> 

<p> Dresser 1 [Dresser 1, Dresser 2, and Fa Li dress Mulan]: <\p> 
<p> Men want girls  <\p> 
<p> with good taste <\p> 

<p> Dresser 2: <\p> 
<p> Calm <\p> 

<p> Fa Li: <\p> 
<p> Obedient <\p> 

<p> Dresser 1: <\p> 
<p> Who work fast-paced <\p> 

<p> Fa Li: <\p> 
<p> With good breeding <\p> 

<p> Dresser 2 [Pulling the dress tight around her waist]: <\p> 
<p> And a tiny waist  <\p> 

<p> Mulan [expressing her waist being squeezed tight] [spoken]: huh. <\p> 

<p> All Three: <\p> 
<p> You'll bring honor to us all  <\p> 

<p> Chorus:  [Mulan follows Fa Li and sees boy stealing a doll from a girl.  Mulan <\p> 
<p> grabs the doll from the boy and returns it to its owner] <\p> 
<p> We all must serve  <\p> 
<p> our Emperor <\p> 
<p> Who guards us from the Huns <\p> 
<p> A man by bearing arms <\p> 
<p> A girl by bearing sons  <\p> 

<p> Make-up Lady/Fa Li: [Putting on Mulan's face, powder, lipstick and eye liner] <\p> 
<p> [in a 3 person round] <\p> 
<p>  When we're through  <\p> 
<p> you can't fail <\p> 
<p> Like a lotus blossom  <\p> 
<p> soft and pale <\p> 
<p> How could any fellow  <\p> 
<p> say "No sale" <\p> 
<p> You'll bring honor to us all <\p> 
<p> [Make-Up Lady holds a mirror so Mulan can see her reflection.  Not looking <\p> 
<p> pleased, Mulan takes her single, short bang and brings it down in front of her <\p> 
<p> forehead and smiles] <\p> 

<p> Fa Li [spoken. Fa Li places a hair comb in Mulan's hair]:  There, you're <\p> 
<p> ready. <\p> 

<p> Grandma Fa [spoken]:  Not yet! An apple for serenity [putting an apple in <\p> 
<p> Mulan's mouth]...A pendant for balance [places a yin-yang pendant under her <\p> 
<p> sash] [sings] <\p> 

<p> Beads of jade for beauty [putting beads around Mulan's neck] <\p> 
<p> You must proudly show it [Grandma Fa raises her chin high with her hand] <\p> 
<p> Now add a cricket just for luck [putting the cage with Cri-Kee under Mulan's <\p> 
<p> sash in the back.  Cri-Kee doesn't look pleased] <\p> 
<p> And even you can't blow it <\p> 

<p> Mulan:  [Walking to catch up with the other maidens] <\p> 
<p> Ancestors <\p> 
<p> Hear my plea <\p> 
<p> Help me not to make a fool of me <\p> 
<p> And to not uproot my fam'ly tree <\p> 
<p> Keep my father standing tall <\p> 

<p> Maidens and Mulan: [Mulan taking the parasol from Fal Li and running to fall <\p> 
<p> in line with the other 4 maidens] <\p> 
<p> Scarier than the undertaker <\p> 
<p> We are meeting our  <\p> 
<p> matchmaker <\p> 

<p> All Townspeople: <\p> 
<p> Destiny <\p> 
<p> Guard our girls <\p> 
<p> And our future  <\p> 
<p> as it fast unfurls <\p> 
<p> Please look kindly on  <\p> 
<p> these cultured pearls <\p> 
<p> Each a perfect porcelain doll <\p> 

<p> Maiden #1:  Please bring honor to us <\p> 
<p> Maiden #2:  Please bring honor to us <\p> 
<p> Maiden #3:  Please bring honor to us <\p> 
<p> Maiden #4:  Please bring honor to us <\p> 
<p> Mulan and Maidens:  Please bring honor to us all!  <\p> 

<p> [All Girls and Mulan arrive before the Matchmaker crouched down behind their <\p> 
<p> parasols.  End of song] <\p> 

<p> Matchmaker [looking at her clipboard]:  Fa Mulan <\p> 

<p> Mulan [Jumping up and raising her hand]:  Present. <\p> 

<p> Matchmaker:  Speaking without permission. <\p> 

<p> Mulan:  Oops.  <\p> 

<p> Grandma Fa [to Fa Li]:  Who spit in her bean curd? <\p> 

<p> [Mulan walks into the Matchmaker's building with the Matchmaker following <\p> 
<p> behind and closing the door] <\p> 

<p> Matchmaker [looking over Mulan]: Huh, Hmm, too skinny.  [Cri-Kee escapes from <\p> 
<p> his cage.  Mulan struggles to catch him] Hmph, not good for bearing sons.  <\p> 
<p> [Mulan puts Cri-Kee in her mouth when Matchmaker turns around to face her] <\p> 
<p> Recite the final admonition. <\p> 

<p> Mulan [nodding and smiling]:  Mmm-Hmm.  [Takes out fan and covers her mouth as <\p> 
<p> she spits out Cri-Kee] Ptu <\p> 

<p> Matchmaker:  Well... <\p> 

<p> Mulan [with dignity]: Fulfill your duties calmly and re...f--[looking at her <\p> 
<p> arm with smeared writing] spectfully.  Reflect before you snack [surprised, <\p> 
<p> Mulan looks at her arm again] act.  [now rapidly] This shall bring you honor <\p> 
<p> and glory.  [Fanning herself rapidly and sighing in relief] Huh. <\p> 

<p> Matchmaker [snatches the fan and looks at it on both sides looking for notes <\p> 
<p> not finding any.  Mulan smiles big when Matchmaker looks at her.  Matchmaker <\p> 
<p> grabs Mulan's right arm pulling her along while smearing the writing and <\p> 
<p> leaving some ink on her hand]  Hmmm, this way.  Now, pour the tea  [Pushing a <\p> 
<p> teapot towards Mulan].  To please your future in-laws you must demonstrate a <\p> 
<p> sense of dignity [Matchmaker smears ink around her mouth.  Mulan staring at <\p> 
<p> Matchmaker pours some tea onto the table then notices her mistake and pours <\p> 
<p> the tea into the cup] and refinement.  You must also be poised.  [Mulan <\p> 
<p> notices Cri-kee in the tea-cup as Matchmaker takes the cup] <\p> 

<p> Mulan [quiet and timid]:  Um, pardon me. <\p> 

<p> Matchmaker:  And silent! [Matchmaker sniffs the tea] <\p> 

<p> Mulan [reaching and grabbing the teacup]:  Could I just take that back...one <\p> 
<p> moment. <\p> 

<p> [They struggle for the teacup and it turns over on Matchmaker and Cri-kee <\p> 
<p> jumps down matchmaker's dress] <\p> 

<p> Matchmaker:  Why you clumsy--[Matchmaker feels Cri-Kee in her dress and dances <\p> 
<p> around]  Wooo, woooo, wooooooo, [Matchmaker knocks over her pot of coals, and <\p> 
<p> sits down on the coals.  Matchmaker jumps around screaming]  Ahhhhhhhhhhh  <\p> 
<p> [Mulan grabs her fan and briskly fans the charred area on Matchmaker's behind <\p> 
<p> causing it to flame up.  Mulan looks surprised about her mistake] <\p> 

<p> [Cut to outside Matchmakers building showing Grandma Fa with much noise coming <\p> 
<p> from Matchmaker's building] <\p> 

<p> Grandma Fa [to Fa Li]:  I think it's going well, don't you? <\p> 

<p> Matchmaker [running out of the building screaming]:  Put it out! Put it out!  <\p> 
<p> Put it out! [Mulan takes the teapot, throws the tea on Matchmaker and puts out <\p> 
<p> the fire.  She bows, hands the teapot back to Matchmaker and covers her face <\p> 
<p> as she walks toward Fa Li and Grandma Fa] [with anger]  You are a disgrace!  <\p> 
<p> [Matchmaker throws the teapot down smashing it to pieces]  You may look like a <\p> 
<p> bride, but you will never bring your family honor! <\p> 

<p> [The townsfolk who have gathered whisper and walk away] <\p> 

<p> [Cut to Mulan walking through the gate with her home leading khan.  She looks <\p> 
<p> sorrowful.  Fa Zhou sees his daughter and smiles.  Mulan sees her father's <\p> 
<p> smile.  She covers her face with Khan's head and leads him to the water <\p> 
<p> trough] <\p> 

<p> [Song: Reflection] <\p> 

<p> Mulan:  <\p> 
<p> Look at me [looking at her reflection in the water trough] <\p> 
<p> I will never pass for  <\p> 
<p> a perfect bride [taking off her earrings and beads of jade] <\p> 
<p> Or a perfect daughter [Mulan watches Fa Li relating what happened at the <\p> 
<p> Matchmaker's to Fa Zhou] <\p> 
<p> Can it be <\p> 
<p> I'm not meant to play  <\p> 
<p> this part?  [Mulan releases Cri-Kee back to the wild] <\p> 
<p> Now I see <\p> 
<p> That if I were to truly <\p> 
<p> To be myself [Mulan hops along the bridge railing] <\p> 
<p> I would break my  <\p> 
<p> family's heart <\p> 

<p> Who is that girl I see  [Mulan looks into the pond and sees her own <\p> 
<p> reflection] <\p> 
<p> Staring straight <\p> 
<p> Back at me? [Mulan puts her hand on the Great Stone Dragon and looks toward <\p> 
<p> the temple] <\p> 
<p> Why is my reflection someone  <\p> 
<p> I don't know? [Cri-Kee rowing across the pond on a lily pad] <\p> 
<p> Somehow I cannot hide [Mulan walking into the family temple] <\p> 
<p> Who I am [Cri-Kee watches Mulan in the temple seeing multiple reflections of <\p> 
<p> herself in the ancestors' stones] <\p> 
<p> Though I've tried  [Mulan bows to the ancestors] <\p> 
<p> When will my reflection show <\p> 
<p> Who I am inside?  [Mulan finishes wiping off her make-up seeing her reflection <\p> 
<p> in the stones] <\p> 
<p> When will my reflection show <\p> 
<p> Who I am inside? [Mulan gets up and heads out the temple] <\p> 

<p> [End of song.  Mulan sits on a bench under the blossom tree.  Fa Zhou <\p> 
<p> approaches her, clearing his throat.  Mulan sees him approaching and turns her <\p> 
<p> head away.  Fa Zhou sits down beside Mulan] <\p> 

<p> Fa Zhou:  My, my, what beautiful blossoms we have this year [looking up into <\p> 
<p> the blossom tree].  But look, this one's late.  But, I'll bet that when it <\p> 
<p> blooms, it will be the most beautiful of all.  [Mulan and Fa Zhou share <\p> 
<p> smiles.  Drums start pounding announcing the arrival of Chi Fu and two guards <\p> 
<p> on horseback] <\p> 

<p> Mulan:  What is it? <\p> 

<p> [Fa Zhou gets up and walks to the entrance of their house with Mulan <\p> 
<p> following] <\p> 

<p> Fa Li:  Mulan, stay inside. <\p> 

<p> [Grandma Fa clears her throat catching Mulan's attention and motions inside.  <\p> 
<p> Mulan spies the railing near the wall and climbs up to watch over the roof] <\p> 

<p> Chi Fu:  Citizens  I bring you a proclamation from the Imperial City:  the <\p> 
<p> Huns have invaded China!  <\p> 

<p> Townspeople [expressing surprise]:  No! <\p> 

<p> Chi Fu:  By order of the Emperor, one man from every family must serve in the <\p> 
<p> Imperial Army.  The Xiao family [a family member steps up, bows to the guard <\p> 
<p> and takes the conscription notice from the guard].  The Yi family. <\p> 

<p> Yi's Son [holding his old father back]:  I will serve the Emperor in my <\p> 
<p> father's place. <\p> 

<p> Chi Fu:  The Fa Family. <\p> 

<p> Mulan:  No. <\p> 

<p> [Fa Zhou gives his cane to Fa Li and walks toward Chi Fu.  Fa Zhou bows before <\p> 
<p> the horsemen] <\p> 

<p> Fa Zhou [standing proud]:  I am ready to serve the Emperor.  [Fa Zhou reaches <\p> 
<p> for the conscription notice] <\p> 

<p> Mulan [running outside to keep her father from taking the conscription <\p> 
<p> notice]:  Father, you can't go. <\p> 

<p> Fa Zhou [turning to see his daughter]:  Mulan! <\p> 

<p> Mulan:  Please sir, my father has already fought bravely-- <\p> 

<p> Chi Fu:  Silence!  You would do well to teach your daughter to hold her tongue <\p> 
<p> in a man's presence. <\p> 

<p> Fa Zhou [looking away from Mulan]:  Mulan, you dishonor me. <\p> 

<p> [Grandma Fa guides Mulan back away] <\p> 

<p> Chi Fu [handing Fa Zhou the conscription notice]:  Report tomorrow at the Wu <\p> 
<p> Shu camp. <\p> 

<p> Fa Zhou:  Yes, sir. [Fa Zhou walks back into the homestead refusing to take <\p> 
<p> his cane from Fa Li] <\p> 

<p> Chi Fu [fading out as we follow Fa Zhou]:  The Chu family.  The Wen family.  <\p> 
<p> The Chang family.  The... <\p> 

<p> [Cut to Fa Zhou in his armory at night.  Fa Zhou takes out his sword and <\p> 
<p> practices his stances.  Whan he balances on his right leg, his leg injury acts <\p> 
<p> up and he falls.  Unbeknownst to her father, Mulan watches in horror.  She <\p> 
<p> breathes heavily] <\p> 

<p> [Cut to dinner.  The Fa Zhou, Grandma Fa, Fa Li, and Mulan eat in silence.  <\p> 
<p> Thunder can be heard and lightning can be seen through the opaque window.  <\p> 
<p> Mulan pours the tea for her family.  She slams her teacup down on the table <\p> 
<p> and stands up] <\p> 

<p> Mulan:  You shouldn't have to go. <\p> 

<p> Fa Li:  Mulan! <\p> 

<p> Mulan:  There are plenty of young men to fight for China. <\p> 

<p> Fa Zhou:  It is an honor to protect my country and my family. <\p> 

<p> Mulan [angrily]:  So you'll die for honor! <\p> 

<p> Fa Zhou [standing up and angered]:  I will DIE doing what's right. <\p> 

<p> Mulan [starts to speak but is cut off]: But if you-- <\p> 

<p> Fa Zhou:  I know my place, it is time you learned yours. <\p> 

<p> [Mulan looking like she's about to cry, turn away from Fa Zhou and runs <\p> 
<p> outside into the rain storm and cries] <\p> 

<p> [Cut to Mulan sitting at the base of the Great Stone Dragon in the rain.  <\p> 
<p> Mulan looks down to see her reflection in the puddle caused by the rain. She <\p> 
<p> watches her parents in the bedroom.  Fa Li turns away from Fa Zhou and walks <\p> 
<p> out of site.  Fa Zhou blows out the light.  Mulan gets up and walks to the Fa <\p> 
<p> Family Temple.  Mulan's image reflects off the stone tablets as she lights <\p> 
<p> incense and places it in the hanging encense holder.  She bows and prays to <\p> 
<p> her ancestors. Getting up, Mulan hurries down the steps.  Cri-Kee sees her and <\p> 
<p> hops down from above and follows her.  Mulan goes to her parent's bedroom and <\p> 
<p> takes the conscription notice replacing it with the hair comb her mother gave <\p> 
<p> to her.  She pauses to give her parents a loving, sorrowful look and hurries <\p> 
<p> out.  Cut to Mulan in the armory.  She opens the cabinet with the armor.  <\p> 
<p> Using her father's sword, she cuts her hair short and ties it up above her <\p> 
<p> head.  She finishes putting on the armor and ties it in the front.  She takes <\p> 
<p> the sword and places it in the scabbard to her left.  Cut to Mulan in the <\p> 
<p> stable doorway.  Khan rears back in fright at the sight of Mulan.  Mulan goes <\p> 
<p> forward and comforts Khan letting him know her identity.  Mulan walks Khan out <\p> 
<p> of the stable, Cri-Kee watches from the ground as she passes by.  Mulan takes <\p> 
<p> one sorrowful glance back at her parents bedroom and rides Khan through the <\p> 
<p> gate and off to camp.] <\p> 

<p> [Cut to the face of a statue in the Fa Family Temple.  The eyes glow.  Cut to <\p> 
<p> Grandma Fa.  She wakes up with a start rising in bed.  Cut to Grandma Fa <\p> 
<p> walking into Fa Li and Fa Zhou's bedroom, both are in bed] <\p> 

<p> Grandma Fa:  Mulan is gone. <\p> 

<p> Fa Zhou [waking up]:  What?  It can't be.  [Fa Zhou looks at his night stand <\p> 
<p> and notices the hair comb in place of his conscription notice.  He checks the <\p> 
<p> cabinet and sees his armor is gone.  He hurries outside] [calling out]  Mulan!  <\p> 
<p> [He stumbles while walking because of his leg injury] No. <\p> 

<p> Fa Li [kneeling down beside the fallen Fa Zhou]:  You must go after her.  She <\p> 
<p> could be killed! <\p> 

<p> Fa Zhou [sadly]:  If I reveal her, she will be. [Fa Zhou embraces Fa Li] <\p> 

<p> Grandma Fa:  Ancestors, hear our prayer: Watch over Mulan. <\p> 

<p> [Cut to the Fa Family Temple.  A wind blows out the incense at the base of the <\p> 
<p> center stone.  The center stone begins to glow as First Ancestor comes to <\p> 
<p> life] <\p> 

<p> First Ancestor [motioning to a bronze dragon]:  Mushu, awaken! <\p> 

<p> [Mushu comes to life and falls to the ground flat on his back all being <\p> 
<p> obscured by smoke] <\p> 

<p> Mushu [rising from the smoke arms stretched out]:  I live!  So tell me what <\p> 
<p> mortal needs my protection Great Ancestor.  You just say the word and I'm <\p> 
<p> there. <\p> 

<p> First Ancestor [agitated]:  Mushu! <\p> 

<p> Mushu:  Hey, let me say something. Anybody who is foolish enough to threaten <\p> 
<p> our family, vengeance will be MINE.  Hrrrrr. <\p> 

<p> First Ancestor [sternly to silence Mushu]:  Mushu!  These are the family <\p> 
<p> guardians [motioning towards the stone statues on pedestals near the ceiling].  <\p> 
<p> They... <\p> 

<p> Mushu [dejectedly]:  Protect the family. <\p> 

<p> First Ancestor [pointing to the empty pedestal]:  And you, oh demoted one. <\p> 

<p> Mushu:  I...ring the gong. <\p> 

<p> First Ancestor:  That's right, now, wake up the ancestors. <\p> 

<p> Mushu:  One family reunion coming right up.  [ringing the gong] Okay people, <\p> 
<p> people look alive, lets go! C'mon get up.  Let's move it, rise and shine.  <\p> 
<p> You're way past the beauty sleep thing now trust me! <\p> 

<p> Ancestor 1:  I knew it, I knew it. That Mulan was a trouble maker from the <\p> 
<p> start. <\p> 

<p> Ancestor 3:  Don't look at me, she gets it from your side of the family. <\p> 

<p> Ancestor 2:  She's just trying to help her father. <\p> 

<p> Ancestor 4 [appearing out of thin air]:  But, if she is discovered, Fa Zhou <\p> 
<p> will be forever shamed.  Dishonor will come to the family.  Traditional values <\p> 
<p> will disintegrate. <\p> 

<p> Ancestor 5:  Not to mention they'll lose the farm. <\p> 

<p> Ancestor 1:  My children never caused such trouble.  They all became <\p> 
<p> acupuncturists. <\p> 

<p> Ancestor 3:  Well, We can't all be acupuncturists. <\p> 

<p> Ancestor 6:  No, your great granddaughter had to be cross-dresser! <\p> 

<p> [All ancestors argue at once, except First Ancestor] <\p> 

<p> Ancestor 7:  Let a guardian bring her back.   <\p> 

<p> Ancestor 8 [grabbing Mushu and bringing him next to a guardian]: Yeah, awaken <\p> 
<p> the most cunning. <\p> 

<p> Ancestor 4 [taking Mushu and holding him next to the stone rabbit guardian]:  <\p> 
<p> No, the swiftest. <\p> 

<p> Ancestor 9 [grabbing Mushu and holding him next to the stone monkey guardian]:  <\p> 
<p> No, send the wisest. <\p> 

<p> First Ancestor:  Silence!  We must send the most powerful of all [Motioning to <\p> 
<p> the Great Stone Dragon as it is seen through the window] <\p> 

<p> Mushu [climbs up the empty guardian post laughing]:  Ho, ho, heh, heh. Okay, <\p> 
<p> okay, I get the drift, I'll go. [All Ancestors give a quick look of surprise <\p> 
<p> and laugh uncontrollably]  You all don't think I can do it.  Watch this here.  <\p> 
<p> [Mushu produces a small flame from his mouth]  Ah, ha, Jump back, I'm pretty <\p> 
<p> hot huh.  Don't make me have to singe nobody to prove no point. <\p> 

<p> First Ancestor [grabbing Mushu and pulling away from the post]:  You had your <\p> 
<p> chance to protect the Fa family. <\p> 

<p> Ancestor 6:  Your mis-guidance led Fa Deng to disaster. <\p> 

<p> Fa Deng [with his decapitated head on his lap]:  Yeah, thanks a lot. <\p> 

<p> Mushu:  And your point is? <\p> 

<p> First Ancestor:  The point is we will be sending a real dragon to retrieve <\p> 
<p> Mulan. <\p> 

<p> Mushu:  What?  But I'm a real dragon. <\p> 

<p> First Ancestor [grabbing Mushu and pulling him away from the guardian post as <\p> 
<p> Mushu fights to hold on]:  You are not worthy of this spot.  Now, awaken the <\p> 
<p> Great Stone Dragon.  [First Ancestor throws Mushu out of the temple] <\p> 

<p> Mushu [looking back into the temple]:  So you'll get back to me on the job <\p> 
<p> thing. <\p> 

<p> [An ancestor throws Mushu's gong and hits Mushu in the face] <\p> 

<p> Mushu [walking with a slouch and banging the gong on the ground]:  Just one <\p> 
<p> chance is that too much to ask?  I mean, it's not like it'll kill ya. <\p> 

<p> Mushu [rings the gong and looks at the Great Stone Dragon]:  Yo rocky, wake <\p> 
<p> up!  You gotta go fetch Mulan.  [pauses as nothing happens.  Mushu walks over <\p> 
<p> to the side of the statue] C'mon boy, go get her, go on, [throws the gong <\p> 
<p> stick off the screen and whistles] Come on.  [Angrily while climbing up the <\p> 
<p> Great Stone Dragon] Grrr, Grrrr.  [speaking in his ear and banging the ear <\p> 
<p> with the gong] Hello, helloooooo. [curtly] Hello [bangs the gong extra hard <\p> 
<p> against the ear causing it to break off].  Uh oh.  [The Great Stone Dragon <\p> 
<p> crumbles to the ground, head intact minus the ear].  [knocks on the dragon's <\p> 
<p> head] Uh, Stoney, Stooooneeey.  Oh man, they're gonna kill me! <\p> 

<p> First Ancestor [calling out through the temple window]:  Great Stone Dragon, <\p> 
<p> have you awaken?  <\p> 

<p> Mushu [holding the head of the Great Stone Dragon up to that First Ancestor <\p> 
<p> can only see it's head and Mushu's body]:  Uhhh, Yes, I just woke up.  And I <\p> 
<p> am the Great Stone Dragon, good morning [Mushu waves].  I will go forth and <\p> 
<p> fetch Mulan.  Did, did I mention that I was the Great Stone Dragon? <\p> 

<p> First Ancestor:  Go, The fate of the Fa Family rests in your claws. <\p> 

<p> Mushu:  Don't even worry about it, I will not lose face.  [Mushu falls down <\p> 
<p> the hill under the weight of the Great Stone Dragon's head and lands on the <\p> 
<p> dragon's pedestal with the head falling on top of him] <\p> 

<p> Mushu [muffled]:  Ow, my elbow.  Aw, aw, I know I twisted something.  <\p> 
<p> [Throwing the head off him]  That's just great.  Now what?  I'm doomed!   And <\p> 
<p> all 'cause miss man decides to take her little drag show on the road. <\p> 

<p> [Cri-Kee enters stage right] <\p> 

<p> Cri-Kee:  Chirp, Chirp. <\p> 

<p> Mushu:  Go get her?   What's the matter with you?  After this great stone <\p> 
<p> Humpty Dumpty mess, I'd have to bring her home with a medal to get back in the <\p> 
<p> temple.  Wait a minute, that's it!  I make Mulan a war hero, then they'll be <\p> 
<p> begging me to come back to work.  That's the master plan.  Oh, you've gone and <\p> 
<p> done it now. [Mushu runs off stage right] <\p> 

<p> Cri-Kee [hopping along side of Mushu]:  Chirp.  Chirp Chirp Chirp. <\p> 

<p> Mushu [pushing Cri-Kee away]:  Hey, what makes you think you're coming? <\p> 

<p> Cri-Kee:  Chirp, Chirp.  <\p> 

<p> Mushu:  You're lucky?  Ho, ho, heh.  Do I look like a sucker to you? <\p> 

<p> Cri-Kee:  Chirp. Chirp. <\p> 

<p> Mushu:  Whach' you mean loser?  How 'bout I pop one of your antenna's off and <\p> 
<p> throw it across the yard.  Then who's a loser, me or you? <\p> 

<p> [Interlude] <\p> 

<p> [Cut to Shan-Yu leading his army at a charge on horseback through a forest.  <\p> 
<p> He stops and motions stage right.  Hun Archer, Hun Strong Guy, Hun Long-Hair <\p> 
<p> Guy dismount and walk into the forest.  They throw down two Imperial scouts <\p> 
<p> before the rest of the army] <\p> 

<p> Hun Long-Hair Guy:  Imperial scouts.  <\p> 

<p> [Shan Yu dismounts and walks towards the scouts] <\p> 

<p> Scout #1:  Shan-Yu. <\p> 

<p> [He crouches down in front of them] <\p> 

<p> Shan-Yu [adjusting Scout #1's collar]:  Nice work, gentlemen.  You found the <\p> 
<p> Hun army. [motioning to the soldiers on horseback.  The Hun army laughs] <\p> 

<p> Scout #2:  The Emperor will stop you. <\p> 

<p> Shan-Yu [grabs Scout #2 by the shirt collar and lifts him up to his face]:  <\p> 
<p> Stop me?  He invited me.  By building his wall, he challenged my strength.  <\p> 
<p> Well I'm here to play his game  [Shan-Yu throws Scout #2 to the ground and <\p> 
<p> points his sword at Scout #1 as he gets up and runs] [calling out to the <\p> 
<p> scouts] Go!  Tell your emperor to send his strongest armies.  [Quietly]  I'm <\p> 
<p> ready.  <\p> 

<p> [The Imperial Scouts run off towards the palace] <\p> 

<p> Shan-Yu [scratching his chin]:  How many men does it take to deliver a <\p> 
<p> message. <\p> 

<p> Archer Guy [drawing back his bow]:  One. <\p> 

<p> [End Interlude] <\p> 

<p> [Cut to Mulan on a hill outside of the camp.  Khan is sitting watching] <\p> 

<p> Mulan:  Okay, okay, how 'bout this?  Ahem, [in her manly voice] excuse me, <\p> 
<p> where do I sign in?  Hah, I see you have a sword.  I have one too.  They're <\p> 
<p> very manly and tough [Mulan bites her lip as she mishandles pulling the sword <\p> 
<p> out of the scabbard and it falls to the ground.  Khan rolls on his back in <\p> 
<p> laughter.  Mulan throws her shoe and hits Khan in the head with it quieting <\p> 
<p> Khan].  I'm working on it.  Who am I fooling?  It's going to take a miracle to <\p> 
<p> get me into the army. <\p> 

<p> [Mushu appears as a giant shadow being cast on a rock with flames on either <\p> 
<p> side.  Mushu's real appearance remains out of sight] <\p> 

<p> Mushu [in a Southern Baptist Preacher's voice]:  Did I hear someone ask for a <\p> 
<p> miracle!?  Let me hear you say aye! <\p> 

<p> Mulan [Running and hiding behind a rock]:  Ahhhhhh. <\p> 

<p> Mushu:  That's close enough. <\p> 

<p> Mulan [from behind a rock]:  Ghost. <\p> 

<p> Mushu:  Get ready Mulan your serpentine salvation is at hand.  For I have <\p> 
<p> been sent by your ancestors-- [notices Cri-Kee making a hand shadow of a <\p> 
<p> dragon on the rock and stamps him down with his foot] to guide you through <\p> 
<p> your masquerade.  [bending down to Cri-Kee]  C'mon, you're gonna stay you're <\p> 
<p> gonna work. [returning to Mulan] Heed my word, 'cause if the army finds out <\p> 
<p> that you are a girl, the penalty is death. [big flames shoot up from the <\p> 
<p> rocks] <\p> 

<p> Mulan:  Who are you? <\p> 

<p> Mushu:  Who am I?  Who am I?  I am the guardian of lost souls. [Mulan smiles <\p> 
<p> big in anticipation of seeing her guardian] I am the powerful, the <\p> 
<p> pleasurable, the indestructible [coming out from the rocks to show his real <\p> 
<p> size] Mushu! Oh hah, hah, pretty hot, huh? [Khan stomps on Mushu.  Mulan <\p> 
<p> pushes Khan back] <\p> 

<p> Mulan:  Ah, my ancestors sent a little lizard to help me? <\p> 

<p> Mushu:  Hey, dragon, dragon,  not lizard.  I don't do that tongue thing [flips <\p> 
<p> out his tongue to show Mulan what he means]. <\p> 

<p> Mulan:  You're uh... <\p> 

<p> Mushu:  Intimidating?  Awe inspiring? <\p> 

<p> Mulan [making a hand gesture to denote his smallness of size]: Tiny. <\p> 

<p> Mushu [with a look of disappointment]:  Of course.  I'm travel size for your <\p> 
<p> convenience.  If I was my real size, your cow here [patting Khan on the nose] <\p> 
<p> would die of fright.  [Khan tries to bite Mushu]  [pointing to the ground <\p> 
<p> speaking to Khan] Down Bessy.  My powers are beyond your mortal imagination.  <\p> 
<p> For instance, [leaning in and looking at Mulan's chest] my eyes can see <\p> 
<p> straight through your armor.  [Mulan cover her bust with her left arm and <\p> 
<p> slaps Mushu with the right]  Ow.  [angrily] All right, that's it!  Dishonor!  <\p> 
<p> Dishonor on your whole family.  [aside to Cri-Kee] Make a note of this <\p> 
<p> [Cri-Kee grabs a leaf and a pen and starts writing].  [Loudly with gusto] <\p> 
<p> Dishonor on you.  Dishonor on your cow.  Dis- <\p> 

<p> Mulan [pleadingly while covering Mushu's mouth]:  Stop!  I'm sorry, I'm sorry <\p> 
<p> [kneeling down in front of Mushu].  I'm just nervous.  I've never done this <\p> 
<p> before. <\p> 

<p> Mushu: Then you're gonna have to trust me.  And don't you slap me no more, we <\p> 
<p> clear on that?  [Mulan nods emphatically].  All right.  Okey dokey, let's get <\p> 
<p> this show on the road.  Cri-Kee, get the bags [Mushu starts walking to the <\p> 
<p> camp].  [to Khan] Let's move it heifer. <\p> 

<p> [Cut to Mulan at the camp's entrance] <\p> 

<p> Mushu [hiding in Mulan's armor poking his head out from her back]:  Okay this <\p> 
<p> is it, time to show 'em your man walk.  Shoulders back,  chest high, feet <\p> 
<p> apart, head up [Mushu pulls Mulan's head back]  ...and strut 2, 3, break it <\p> 
<p> down, 2, 3 and work it, [Mulan walks into the camp drawing the attention the <\p> 
<p> men who see her.  Mulan walks into a tent and sees a man picking his nose and <\p> 
<p> another man picking out dirt from between his toes with chopsticks] Beautiful <\p> 
<p> isn't it? <\p> 

<p> Mulan [making a face of disgust and continuing to walk]:  They're disgusting. <\p> 

<p> Mushu:  No, they're men.  And you're going to have to act just like them, so <\p> 
<p> pay attention. <\p> 

<p> [Mulan stops and watches Yao, Ling, Chien-Po and Tattoo Soldier] <\p> 

<p> Tattoo Soldier [showing the dragon tattoo on his chest and belly]:  Look, this <\p> 
<p> tattoo will protect me from harm. <\p> 

<p> [Yao thinks for a moment, then punches Tattoo Soldier in the stomach causing <\p> 
<p> Ling to laugh.  Mulan watches in utter amazement.  Yao kisses his hand] <\p> 

<p> Ling [laughing]:  I hope you can get your money back. <\p> 

<p> Mulan:  I don't think I can do this. <\p> 

<p> Mushu:  It's all attitude.  Be tough like this guy here [looking at Yao]. <\p> 

<p> [Mulan looks at Yao as he hocks up a loogie and spits] <\p> 

<p> Yao [noticing Mulan watching him]:  What are you looking at? <\p> 

<p> Mushu:  Punch him, it's how men say 'hello.' <\p> 

<p> [Mulan looks at her fist, then punches Yao from behind on the shoulder.  The <\p> 
<p> force causes Yao to run into Chien-Po] <\p> 

<p> Chien-Po:  Oh Yao, you made a friend. <\p> 

<p> Mushu:  Good, Now slap him on the behind, they like that. <\p> 

<p> [Mulan slaps Yao on the behind] <\p> 

<p> Yao:  Wu hoo hooooo.  [grabbing Mulan buy the collar]  I'm going to hit you so <\p> 
<p> hard it'll make your ancestors dizzy. <\p> 

<p> Chien-Po [Holding and picking up Yao]:  Yao, relax and chant with me.  <\p> 
<p> Yaaaaaaa Moouuuu Ahhhhhh Doooou Fuuuu Daaaaa. <\p> 

<p> Yao:  Ya Mi Ah To Fu Da. <\p> 

<p> Chien-Po:  Feel better?  <\p> 

<p> Yao [relaxed]:  Yeah. [Chien-Po places Yao back on the ground]  [to Mulan <\p> 
<p> while walking away] Aaaaa, you ain't worth my time chicken boy. <\p> 

<p> Mushu [loudly]:  Chicken boy!?  Say that to my face ya limp noodle! <\p> 

<p> [Yao grabs Mulan by the collar cocking back his arm to punch.  Mulan ducks as <\p> 
<p> Yao hits Ling standing behind her] <\p> 

<p> Yao:  Oh, sorry Ling.  Hey! <\p> 

<p> [Yao grabs Mulan's foot as she starts to crawl away.  Ling kicks Yao on the butt causing him to land on Chien-Po's stomach. Ling Jump <\p> 
<p> attacks Mulan, but she ducks and he lands on Yao on top of Chien-Po] <\p> 

<p> Ling:  You're dead.  [They fight on top of Chien-Po.  Mulan runs away.  Ling notices Mulan and then points toward her] Oh, there he goes. <\p> 

<p> [Mulan runs into a tent and stops.  Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po (in that order) run through the tent.  Yao stops short as he is about to run into a <\p> 
<p> soldier in a line for food.  He looks behind him with concerned eyes as Ling stops in time.  Chien-Po bumps into Ling causing the entire line <\p> 
<p> of soldiers to fall forward and knock over the pot of congee and the cook behind it.  The men look to the back of the line and spy Mulan who <\p> 
<p> has emerged from the tent.  They angrily start walking towards her.  Mulan has a look of horror on her face as if trouble is about to brew] <\p> 

<p> Mulan:  Hey guys.   <\p> 

<p> [Chi Fu watches and then walks into the tent.  General Li and Li Shang are in the tent.] <\p> 

<p> General Li [motioning with his pointer to a map of the region]:  The Huns have struck here, here and here.  I will take the main troops up to <\p> 
<p> the Tung Shao Pass and stop Shan-Yu before he destroys this village. <\p> 

<p> Chi Fu:  Excellent strategy, Sir.  I do love surprises, Ha ha, ha, ha. <\p> 

<p> General Li:  You will stay here and train the new recruits.  When Chi Fu believes you're ready, you will join us...Captain. [General Li hands <\p> 
<p> a sword to Shang] <\p> 

<p> Shang:  Captain? <\p> 

<p> Chi Fu:  Oh, this is an enormous responsibility, General.  Uh, perhaps a soldier with more experience-- <\p> 

<p> General Li:  Number one in his class, extensive knowledge of training techniques, [leaning back smugly stroking his chin] an impressive <\p> 
<p> military lineage.  I believe Li Shang will do an excellent job. <\p> 

<p> Shang [excitedly]:  Oh, I will.  I wont let you down.  This is, I mean, I...[somberly] yes sir. <\p> 

<p> General Li [gets up and starts walking out of the tent]:  Very good then.  We'll toast China's victory at the Imperial City.  [to Chi Fu] I'll <\p> 
<p> expect a full report in three weeks. <\p> 

<p> Chi Fu [to Shang]:  And I wont leave anything out.  [exits through the tent] <\p> 

<p> Shang [while tying his sword to his uniform]:  Captain Li Shang, Hmmm, leader of China's finest troops.  No, the greatest troops of all time.  <\p> 
<p> Heh, heh, heh, heh.  [Shang walks out of the tent to see the recruits fighting.  He stands stage left of Chi Fu and General Li.  Injured Recruit <\p> 
<p> sees the General and salutes him as he falls to the ground.  General Li steps over Injured Recruit and mounts his horse] <\p> 

<p> Chi Fu:  Most impressive. <\p> 

<p> General Li:  Good luck Captain.  [The general and his mounted troops leave the camp] <\p> 

<p> Shang [quietly, to himself]:  Good luck, Father.  [Shang looks at his troops and sighs] <\p> 

<p> Chi Fu [smirking, with board and brush in hand]:  Day one. <\p> 

<p> Shang [shouting]:  Soldiers! <\p> 

<p> All Recruits [backing away revealing Mulan and pointing at her.  Mulan is crouching in the fetal position on the ground]:  He started it! <\p> 

<p> [Shang approaches Mulan and looks down over her.  Mulan looks up, sees Shang over top of her and gets up quickly dusting herself off] <\p> 

<p> Shang [to Mulan]:  I don't need anyone causing trouble in my camp! <\p> 

<p> Mulan:  Sorry, [in her man voice] Uhh, I mean, sorry you had to see that.  [with her fist she taps Shang on the shoulder]  You know how it is <\p> 
<p> when you get those, uh [pounding her chest] manly urges and you just have to kill something [slapping her hand], fix things, uh, cook <\p> 
<p> outdoors. <\p> 

<p> Shang:  What's your name? <\p> 

<p> Mulan [stumbling]:  Ahh, I, uhhh, I, uh-- <\p> 

<p> Chi Fu [stepping into Mulan's face]:  Your commanding officer just asked you a question. <\p> 

<p> Mulan:  Uhh, I've got a name.  Huh.  And it's a boys name too. <\p> 

<p> Mushu [from the back of Mulan]:  Ling, How 'bout Ling? <\p> 

<p> Mulan [to Mushu motioning with her head to Ling]:  His name's Ling. <\p> 

<p> Shang:  I didn't ask for his name.  I asked for yours. <\p> 

<p> Mushu:  Try, uh, ahh, Chu! <\p> 

<p> Mulan:  Ah Chu. <\p> 

<p> Shang:  Ah Chu? <\p> 

<p> Mushu:  Gesundheit.  He He, I kill myself. <\p> 

<p> Mulan [whispering over her shoulder]:  Mushu. <\p> 

<p> Shang:  Mushu? <\p> 

<p> Mulan:  No. <\p> 

<p> Shang:  Then what is it! <\p> 

<p> Mushu:  Ping! Ping was my best friend growing up! <\p> 

<p> Mulan:  It's Ping. <\p> 

<p> Shang:  Ping. <\p> 

<p> Mushu:  Of course Ping DID steal my gir-[Mulan reaches back and grabs holds Mushu's mouth together] <\p> 

<p> Mulan:  Yes, my name is Ping. <\p> 

<p> Shang:  Let me see your conscription notice.  [Takes the notice from Mulan]  Fa Zhou, *the* Fa Zhou? <\p> 

<p> Chi Fu:  I didn't know Fa Zhou had a son. <\p> 

<p> Mulan:  Um, he...doesn't talk about me much.  [Mulan tries to hawk up a loogie and spit but the saliva just runs from her mouth.  The <\p> 
<p> recruits laugh] <\p> 

<p> Chi Fu:  I can see why, the boy's an absolute lunatic. <\p> 

<p> Shang [to the recruits]: Okay gentlemen, thanks to your new friend Ping, you'll spend tonight picking up every single grain of rice.  And <\p> 
<p> tomorrow, the real work begins. <\p> 

<p> [All recruits growl at Mulan] <\p> 

<p> Mushu [Popping out the front of Mulan's armor]:  You know, we have to work on your people skills. <\p> 

<p> [Cut to Mulan sleeping in her tent.  Mushu winds up Cri-Kee's wings.  Cri-Kee rings like an alarm clock] <\p> 

<p> Mushu: All right, rise and shine sleeping beauty.  [Mulan rises and blinks] C'mon [rapping on Mulan's head with each syllable] hup, hup, <\p> 
<p> hup. [Mulan groans, lies back down and pulls the covers over her head.  Mushu pulls the covers off Mulan entirely]  Get your clothes on.  <\p> 
<p> Get ready.  Got breakfast for ya.  [Mushu jumps onto Mulan's knee with a bowl of porridge]  Look, you get porridge, and it's happy to see <\p> 
<p> you.  [Mushu shows her the bowl with two eggs and bacon looking like a smiley face.  Cri-Kee pops up out from the bowl of porridge] Hey, <\p> 
<p> get outta there, you gonna make people sick!  [Mushu uses chopsticks to push Cri-Kee out of the porridge] <\p> 

<p> Mulan:  Am I late? <\p> 

<p> Mushu [while feeding Mulan]:  No time to talk.  Now remember, it's your first day of training so listen to your teacher and no fighting.  Play <\p> 
<p> nice with the other kids, unless of course one of the other kids wanna fight, then you have to kick the other kid's butt. <\p> 

<p> Mulan [with her mouth full of food]:  But I don't wanna kick the other kid's butt. <\p> 

<p> Mushu:  Don't talk with your mouth full.  Now let's see your war face [Mulan looks at him with wide eyes and chipmunk cheeks full of food].  <\p> 
<p> I think my bunny slippers just ran for cover.  C'mon scare me, girl!  <\p> 

<p> Mulan [swallows the food]:  Rrrrrrr! <\p> 

<p> Mushu [rolling back into the half eaten bowl of porridge]:  Oh, that's my tough looking warrior.  That's what I'm talking about.  Now get out <\p> 
<p> there and make me proud. [Mushu ties up Mulan's hair] <\p> 

<p> [Khan whinnies and pokes his head into the tent] <\p> 

<p> Mushu:  What do you mean the troops just left?   <\p> 

<p> Mulan [acting surprised]:  They what!? [Mulan hurriedly puts on her clothes and jumps out of the tent going off to join the other recruits]   <\p> 

<p> Mushu [running out from the tent calling after Mulan]:  Wait, you forgot your sword.  My little baby off to destroy people [sniffle]. <\p> 

<p> [Cut to the troops muddling around near Shang's tent] <\p> 

<p> Chi Fu [enters stage left]:  Order people, order! <\p> 

<p> Recruit #2:  I'd like a pan fried noodle. <\p> 

<p> Chien-Po:  Oh, oh, sweet and pungent shrimp [Ling and others begin to laugh] <\p> 

<p> Recruit #3:  Moo goo gai pan <\p> 

<p> Chi Fu:  That's not funny. <\p> 

<p> [Mulan comes running up to the group] <\p> 

<p> Ling [noticing Mulan's arrival]:  Looks like our new friend slept in this morning.  [Mulan stops between Ling and Yao] [to Ping] Hellooo Ping, <\p> 
<p> Are you hungry? <\p> 

<p> Yao:  Yeah, 'cause I owe you a knuckle sandwich.  [grabs Mulan by the shirt collar drawing back his other arm.  Mulan hides her face with <\p> 
<p> her hands.  Ling looks away, closes his eyes, and puts his fingers in his ears so that he wont hear anything] <\p> 

<p> All Soldiers [in agreement with Yao]:  Yeah. <\p> 

<p> Shang [loudly]:  Soldiers!  [The soldiers line up quicky.  Shang takes off his shirt and grabs a bow and quiver of arrows.  Mulan is duly <\p> 
<p> impressed by Shang's physique] You will assemble swiftly and silently every morning. [Shang walks down the line of soldiers] Anyone who <\p> 
<p> acts otherwise will answer to me. <\p> 

<p> Yao:  Ooooo, tough guy. <\p> 

<p> Shang [turning around with knocked arrow pointing towards Yao]:  Yao.  [All recruits take a step back leaving Yao one step forward.  Shang <\p> 
<p> Points arrow skyward and shoots it into the top of a high pole]  Thank you for volunteering.  Retrieve the arrow. <\p> 

<p> Yao [bows to Shang]:  I'll get that arrow pretty boy.  And I'll do it with my shirt on.  [Yao prepares to leap onto that pole] <\p> 

<p> Shang:  One moment, you seem to be missing something.  [Chi Fu brings out two large bronze disks.  Shang takes out one disk and holds it <\p> 
<p> high speaking to all the troops]  This represents discipline  [Shang hands the weight to Yao and the weight falls to the ground taking Yao's <\p> 
<p> arm with it]  and this represents strength [Shang hands the other weight to Yao making him fall to the ground.  The troops laugh while <\p> 
<p> Mulan looks concerned].  You need both to reach the arrow. <\p> 

<p> [Yao climbs up the pole then slips down under the weight.  Ling, Chien-Po, and Mulan each take their turn and fall down.  Mulan rubs her <\p> 
<p> behind as she walks away in front of Shang] <\p> 

<p> Shang:  We've got a long way to go. <\p> 

<p> [Song I'll Make a Man Out of You] <\p> 

<p> [Shang throws staffs to the soldiers.  Yao intercepts Mulan's staff and trips her with it] <\p> 

<p> Shang: <\p> 
<p> Let's get down to business-- <\p> 
<p> to defeat the Huns. <\p> 

<p> [Shang throws up two clay pots and breaks them apart with his staff.  The troops are highly impressed] <\p> 

<p> Recruits [putting their staffs out at arms length, spoken]:  Hua <\p> 

<p> Shang: <\p> 
<p> Did they send me daughters <\p> 
<p>  when I asked for sons?  [Ling puts a cricket down Mulan's back causing her to flail erratically] <\p> 
<p> You're the saddest bunch <\p> 
<p>  I ever met  [Most soldiers fall as Mulan moves uncontrollably] <\p> 
<p> But you can bet  <\p> 
<p> before we're through  [Shang does a somersault in the air landing near Mulan.  He takes a pole in the stomach.  Shang stops Mulan and <\p> 
<p> takes her staff.  He grabs her by the collar] <\p> 
<p> Mister, I'll make a man <\p> 
<p>  out of you  <\p> 

<p> [Shang steps on a lever throwing up 3 targets which he hits with 3 arrows from one bow] <\p> 
<p> Tranquil as a forest <\p> 
<p> [The recruits try and fail.  Mulan gets ready to fire when Mushu sticks a target on her arrow before she shoots.  Mulan looks at Mushu's in <\p> 
<p> shock and pauses.  Shang looks disdainfully at Mulan as she cracks a huge smile] <\p> 
<p> But on fire within <\p> 
<p> [Shang balances a bucket of water on his head holding a staff.  The recruits fire stones at him which Shang deflect with the staff] <\p> 
<p> Once you find your center <\p> 
<p> You are sure to win <\p> 
<p> [Mulan wobbles with the bucket of water on her head.  As the recruits throw stones at her the bucket tips over onto her head] <\p> 
<p> You're a spineless, pale, <\p> 
<p> pathetic lot  <\p> 
<p> And you haven't got a clue  <\p> 
<p> [Shang throws his hand down into a river and retrieves a fish.  Mulan throws her hand down into the river and retrieve's Yao's foot.  Mushu <\p> 
<p> comes out of the water with a fish in hand to give to Mulan] <\p> 
<p> Somehow I'll make a man <\p> 
<p> out of you! <\p> 

<p> Chien-Po [running through a field of fire arrows]: <\p> 
<p> I'm never gonna catch  <\p> 
<p> my breath <\p> 

<p> Yao [following Chien-Po, falls and gets hit in the butt with an arrow]: <\p> 
<p> Say good-bye to those  <\p> 
<p> who knew me <\p> 

<p> Ling [Banging his head on a stone slab]: <\p> 
<p> Boy I was a fool in school  <\p> 
<p> for cutting gym <\p> 

<p> [Shang practices martial arts with Mulan.  With a punch to the face he knocks her back into a tree] <\p> 

<p> Mushu [from the tree acts as a boxing coach]: <\p> 
<p> This guy's got 'em  <\p> 
<p> scared to death <\p> 

<p> Mulan [Mushu pushes Mulan back out into the ring]: <\p> 
<p> Hope he doesn't see  <\p> 
<p> right through me <\p> 

<p> Chien-Po [stops as he's hopping across poles protruding from water causing Shang and the recruits to pile into him]: <\p> 
<p> Now I really wish that I  <\p> 
<p> knew how to swim! <\p> 

<p> Shang and Chorus:   <\p> 
<p> [Cannon fire misses the target in the middle of an open field. Ling kicks the support structure out from Mulan's cannon and it begins to fall. <\p> 
<p> Mulan quickly grabs the cannon and it fires high and back towards the camp landing and exploding Chi Fu's tent] <\p> 
<p> (Be a man) <\p> 
<p> We must be swift as  <\p> 
<p> the coursing river <\p> 
<p> (Be a man) <\p>

<p> [Picture of Shang looking over the camp from the hill not looking pleased] <\p> 
<p> Mysterious as the  <\p> 
<p> dark side of the moon  <\p> 

<p> Shang [his troops laden with poles on their shoulders carrying bags of grain - one on each side.  They march up a mountain]: <\p> 
<p> Time is racing toward us  <\p> 
<p> till the Huns arrive   <\p> 
<p> [Chi Fu points Shang's eyes back to a struggling Mulan who falls to the ground.  Cri-Kee and Mushu try to pick her up but hide when Shang <\p> 
<p> comes up to her.  Shang picks up her pole with grain, puts it on top of his and returns to the troops. Mulan looks rejected] <\p> 
<p> Heed my every order  <\p> 
<p> and you might survive <\p> 
<p> [Shang hand the reigns of Khan to Mulan] <\p> 
<p> You're unsuited for  <\p> 
<p> the rage of war <\p> 
<p> So pack up, go home,  <\p> 
<p> you're through <\p> 
<p> How could I make a man <\p> 
<p> out of you? <\p> 

<p> Shang and Chorus [Mulan takes the weights and tries to climb the pole again]: <\p> 
<p> (Be a man) <\p> 
<p> We must be swift as  <\p> 
<p> the coursing river <\p> 
<p> [Mulan ties the weights together behind the pole and uses the cloth to help her shimmy up the pole] <\p> 
<p> (Be a man) <\p> 
<p> With all the force  <\p> 
<p> of a great typhoon <\p> 
<p> [As the sun begins to rise the recruits come out of their tents to cheer on Mulan] <\p> 
<p> (Be a man) <\p> 
<p> With all the strength  <\p> 
<p> of a raging fire <\p> 
<p> [As Shang comes out of his tent, the arrow he shot up onto the pole comes down to his feet.  He looks up and sees Mulan sitting on top of <\p> 
<p> the pole] <\p> 
<p> Mysterious as the  <\p> 
<p> dark side of the moon <\p> 

<p> [order of events during the last repeat of the chorus: <\p>

<p> [End Song] <\p> 

<p> [Interlude] <\p> 

<p> [Cut to Shan Yu sitting on top of a tree.  He cuts off the very top with his sword.  His falcon swoops buy and drops a doll.  Shan-Yu takes <\p> 
<p> the doll, sniffs it, looks surprised, and drops down to the ground] <\p> 

<p> Shan-Yu [tossing the doll to Hun Strong Man]:  What do you see? <\p> 

<p> Hun Strong Man [feeling the doll]:  Black pine, from the high mountains.  [Long Hair Hun Man takes the doll from Hun Strong Man.  Bald <\p> 
<p> Hun Man #1 takes a hair as it passes by him] <\p> 

<p> Bald Hun Man #1:  White horse hair.  Imperial stallions.   <\p> 

<p> Long Hair Hun Man [sniffing the doll]:  Sulfur, from cannons. <\p> 

<p> Shan-Yu:  This doll came from a village in the Tung Shao Pass, where the Imperial Army's waiting for us. <\p> 

<p> Hun Archer:  We can avoid them easily. <\p> 

<p> Shan-Yu [shaking his head]:  No, the quickest way to the Emperor is through that pass.  Besides, the little girl will be missing her doll.  We <\p> 
<p> should return it to her. <\p> 

<p> [End Interlude] <\p> 

<p> [Cut to Mulan by the lake with Mushu, Khan, and Cri-Kee] <\p> 

<p> Mushu:  Hey, oh, ah, no, this is not a good idea.  What if somebody sees you? <\p> 

<p> Mulan [from behind the reeds]:  Just because I look like a man doesn't mean I have to smell like one.   <\p> 

<p> Mushu [holding a towel covering his eyes with his ears]:  So a couple of guys don't rinse out their socks, picky, picky, picky.  Well myself I <\p> 
<p> kinda like that corn chip's smell. <\p> 

<p> Mulan [running by Mushu and jumps into the lake splashing water on Mushu]:  Ahhhhhhh. <\p> 

<p> Mushu:   Okay, all right, all right, that's enough.  Now, c'mon, get out before you get all pruny and stuff [holding out a towel towards Mulan <\p> 
<p> keeping his eyes covered]. <\p> 

<p> Mulan:   Mushu, if you're so worried, go stand watch. <\p> 

<p> Mushu:  Yeah, yeah, [walking in a womanly fashion speaking in woman's voice] stand watch Mushu while I blow our secret with my stupid <\p> 
<p> girly habits. [back to normal] Humph, hygiene. <\p> 

<p> Cri-Kee [alarmed, tugging on Mushu's whiskers]:  Chirp, Chirp. <\p> 

<p> Yao:  Me first! Me first! Me First! [Yao, Ling and Chien-Po run by Mushu smacking him in the face with colored boxers] <\p> 

<p> Mushu [gasps]:  Ah.  We're doomed!  There a couple of things I know they're bound to notice! <\p> 

<p> [Yao and Ling jump into the water.  Chien-Po dips in his toe to check temperature then jumps in causing a large wave.  Yao and Ling ride <\p> 
<p> the wave towards Mulan.  Mulan sees them and hides her face behind a lily pad] <\p> 

<p> Yao [calling]:  Hey, Ping. <\p> 

<p> [Mulan peeks over the lily pad and spreads it on the water covering her chest] <\p> 

<p> Mulan [speaking nervously and unnaturally in a manly voice]:  Oh hi guys, I didn't know you were *here*. [Yao, Ling and Chien-Po share <\p> 
<p> "this boy is strange" looks] I was just washing, so now I'm clean and I'm gonna go.  Bye, bye.  [Mulan hides behind a rock keeping her front <\p> 
<p> facing the rock] <\p> 

<p> Ling [from behind Mulan]:  Come back here.  I know we were jerks to you before so lets start over.  [extending his hand to shake hands with <\p> 
<p> Mulan]  Hi, I'm Ling! <\p> 

<p> Mulan [covering her chest with her left arm, she turns and shakes his hand with an outstretched right arm, smiling]:  Heh, heh.  [Mulan turns <\p> 
<p> and wades away from Ling and runs into Chien-Po] <\p> 

<p> Chien-Po [taking a lily pad off his head]:  And I'm Chien-Po. <\p> 

<p> Mulan [waving slightly and smiling]:  Hello Chien-Po. <\p> 

<p> [Yao stands on top of a rock looking down at the others.  Mulan looks down into the water and hides her eyes with her free hand] <\p> 

<p> Yao:  And I am Yao, king of the rock.  And there's nothin' you girls can do about it. <\p> 

<p> Ling [taking a fighting stance]:  Oh, yeah?  Well, I think Ping [elbowing Mulan] and I could take you. <\p> 

<p> Mulan [wading away]:  I really don't want to take him anywhere. <\p> 

<p> Ling [following Mulan]:  Ping, we have to fight! <\p> 

<p> Mulan:  No we don't. [unnaturally]  We could just close our eyes and swim around. <\p> 

<p> Ling: C'mon don't be such a g--Ouch!  Something bit me. <\p> 

<p> Mushu [popping out of the water between Mulan and Ling]:  What a nasty flavor. <\p> 

<p> Ling [with fear and gusto]:  Snake!   <\p> 

<p> Chien-Po [while all three of them climb up the rock and on each other]: Snake, snake. <\p> 

<p> [Mulan whistles for Khan and wades back to shore.  Khan comes close enough to shore and Mulan hides behind Khan as she wraps a towel <\p> 
<p> around her body] <\p> 

<p> [Cut to Yao, Ling and Chien-Po calmed down sitting on the rock] <\p> 

<p> Ling:  Some king of the rock!  [Yao pushes him off the rock] <\p> 

<p> [Cut to Mulan with towel wrapped around her] <\p> 

<p> Mulan:  Boy, that was close. <\p> 

<p> Mushu [brushing his teeth]:  No, that was vile!  You owe me big! <\p> 

<p> Mulan:  I never want to see a naked man again.  [the rest of the troops run by naked and jump into the lake] <\p> 

<p> Mushu:  Hey, don't look at me.  I ain't biting any more butts. <\p> 

<p> [Cut to Mulan outside Chi Fu's Tent having dressed fully.  Chi Fu and Shang are talking from inside] <\p> 

<p> Chi Fu [fading in]:  You think your troops are ready to fight?  Hah!  They would not last a minute against the Huns.   <\p> 

<p> Shang:  They completed their training. <\p> 

<p> Chi Fu:  Those *boys* are no more fit to be soldiers than you are to be Captain.  Once the general reads my report, your troops will never <\p> 
<p> see battle. <\p> 

<p> Mushu [from outside the tent]:  Oh no you don't.  I've worked to hard to get Mulan into this war. [to Cri-Kee] This guy's messing with my <\p> 
<p> plan. <\p> 

<p> Shang [grabbing onto the front of Chi Fu's clip board]:  We're not finished. <\p> 

<p> Chi Fu [pulling the board away]:  Be careful, Captain.  The General may be your father, but I am the Emperor's council.  And, oh, by the <\p> 
<p> way, huh, I got that job on my own.  [opens the entrance to the tent for Shang] You're dismissed. <\p> 

<p> [Shang storms out of the tent and starts to walk by Mulan] <\p> 

<p> Mulan [in a manly voice]:  Hey, I'll hold him and you punch, heh, heh...  [Shang walks by without reacting] or not.  [calling out to Shang]  <\p> 
<p> For what it's worth, I think you're a great captain.  [Shang pauses to glance back, then continues forward] <\p> 

<p> Mushu [looking at Mulan's fixed gaze on Shang]:  I saw that! <\p> 

<p> Mulan [innocently]:  What? <\p> 

<p> Mushu [teasing]:  You like him don't you? <\p> 

<p> Mulan:  No, I-- <\p> 

<p> Mushu:  Yeah right, Yeah sure.  Look,  [pointing to Mulan's tent] go to your tent.  [Mulan walks away with a look of delight. Mushu talks to <\p> 
<p> Cri-Kee]  I think it's time we took this war into our own hands [rubbing hands together]. <\p> 

<p> [Mushu and Cri-Kee wait outside Chi Fu's Tent.  Chi Fu emerges with carrying a scrub brush and wrapped in a towel and with big <\p> 
<p> showering slippers on his feet.  He whistles as he walks off.  Mushu and Cri-Kee enter his tent.  Cri-Kee uses his legs to write up a letter.  He <\p> 
<p> finishes and Mushu takes the paper] <\p> 

<p> Mushu:  Okay, okay, let me see what you've got.  From General Li, dear son, we're waiting for the huns at the pass and it would mean a lot <\p> 
<p> if you'd come and back us up.  [sarcastically]  That's great except you forgot, "and since we're all out of potpourri, maybe you wouldn't <\p> 
<p> mind bringing up some."  Hellooooo, this is the army!  Make it sound more urgent, please!  You know what I'm talkin' about?  [Cri-Kee starts <\p> 
<p> writing the note again]  That's better, much better.  [taking the note] Okay, Let's go. <\p> 

<p> [Cut to Khan drinking water from the trough.  Mushu is on his back] <\p> 

<p> Mushu:  Khan-ie baby, hey, we need a ride.  [Khan squirts Mushu off his back with water from his mouth] <\p> 

<p> [Cut to Chi Fu walking out of the lake wrapped in a towel, sounds of laughter can be heart from the troops] <\p> 

<p> Chi Fu [muttering]:  Insubordinate ruffians.  [then calling to the troops]  You men owe me a new pair of slippers.  And I do not squeal like a <\p> 
<p> girl.  [a panda bear chomps down on the slipper Chi Fu is holding] Aaaaaahhhhhh! <\p> 

<p> Mushu [sitting on top of the panda bear behind a dummy of a soldier using sticks to gesticulate with the dummy's arms to push the note <\p> 
<p> towards Chi Fu.  Cri-Kee works the mouth]:  Urgent news from the general!  [Chi Fu looks over the panda]  What's the matter, you've never <\p> 
<p> seen a 'black and white' before? <\p> 

<p> Chi Fu:  Who are you? <\p> 

<p> Mushu:  Excuse me!  I think the question is: who are you?  We're in a war man!  There's no time for stupid questions.  I should have your <\p> 
<p> hat for that, [the panda starts walking forward] snatch it right off of your head [swiping with an arm at Chi Fu's hat.  Mushu turns the upper <\p> 
<p> half of the dummy around after the panda passes Chi Fu.  Chi Fu begins reading the message].  But I'm feeling gracious today, so carry on <\p> 
<p> before I report you.  [the panda walks up a tree taking Mushu and Cri-Kee with him out of sight] <\p> 

<p> Chi Fu [looking around for Mushu but not finding him, then runs into Shang's tent]:  Captain.  Urgent news from the General.  We're needed <\p> 
<p> at the front. <\p> 

<p> Mushu [from up in the tree]:  Pack your bags Cri-Kee, we're movin' out.  [Cri-Kee high fives Mushu] <\p> 

<p> [Song:  A Girl Worth Fighting For] <\p> 

<p> Army Chorus [troops walking up hill]: <\p> 
<p> For a long time we've been  <\p> 
<p> marching off to battle <\p> 

<p> Yao [close-up of Yao, then a shot of 2 cows]:  <\p> 
<p> In a thundering herd  <\p> 
<p> we feel a lot like cattle <\p> 

<p> Cow [spoken]:  Moo <\p> 

<p> Army Chorus [showing troops marching]: <\p> 
<p> Like the pounding beat  <\p> 
<p> our aching feet aren't  <\p> 
<p> easy to ignore <\p> 

<p> Ling [catching up to Yao and Chien-Po]: <\p> 
<p> Hey, think of instead, <\p> 
<p> A girl worth fighting for [Yao, Ling and Chien-Po look upwards dreamily] <\p> 

<p> Mulan [spoken from behind]: Huh? <\p> 

<p> Ling [grabbing Mulan and drawing her close while pulling out a centerfold]: <\p> 
<p> That's what I said, a girl  <\p> 
<p> worth fighting for [Mulan runs away seeing the centerfold] <\p> 

<p> [artistry section where the images are drawn like painted people.  Ling is seen looking at a woman and then kissing her] <\p> 
<p> I want her paler than the  <\p> 
<p> moon with eyes that  <\p> 
<p> shine like stars <\p> 

<p> Yao [lifting and lowering a woman over his head then opening his chest to show a gaping wound that we can see the woman through]: <\p> 
<p> My girl will marvel at  <\p> 
<p> my strength, adore my  <\p> 
<p> battle scars <\p> 

<p> Chien-Po [Chien-Po and a woman circle around then land on the edge of a large bowl of rice as a cow, pig and chicken fall beside them]: <\p> 
<p> I couldn't care less what she'll  <\p> 
<p> wear or what she looks like <\p> 
<p> It all depends on what  <\p> 
<p> she cooks like: <\p> 
<p> Beef, pork, chicken... [end painted people section, the last image fades into statues that the troops just passed] <\p> 

<p> All Three: <\p> 
<p> Mmm... <\p> 

<p> Yao [looking at Mulan while crossing the river with swords over their heads.  Mulan looks disgusted and hurries forward]: <\p> 
<p> Bet the local girls thought  <\p> 
<p> you were quite the charmer <\p> 

<p> Ling [with armor full of water to make him look muscular]: <\p> 
<p> And I'll bet the ladies love  <\p> 
<p> a man in armor [the water leaks out making Ling look like his normal self] <\p> 

<p> Army Chorus [Mushu whistles to ladies working in the rice field from out of the carriage holding cannons.  Cri-Kee looks shocked.  The <\p> 
<p> ladies look and giggle at Mulan who hides her face]: <\p> 
<p> You can guess what we  <\p> 
<p> have missed the most  <\p> 
<p> since we went off  <\p> 
<p> to war <\p> 
<p> What do we want? <\p> 
<p> A girl worth fighting for! <\p> 

<p> Yao [Mulan walks away from Yao and into Chien-Po]: <\p> 
<p> My girl will think I have  <\p> 
<p> no faults <\p> 

<p> Chien-Po: <\p> 
<p> That I'm a major find <\p> 

<p> Mulan [Caught between Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po who all look up dreamily waiting for her ideal woman.  She is forced to speak (sing)]: <\p> 
<p> [spoken] Uh, [singing] How about a girl who's  <\p> 
<p> got a brain,  [Yao starts to look unimpressed] <\p> 
<p> Who always speaks her mind? [Mulan shrugs her shoulders] <\p> 

<p> Ling, Yao and Chien-Po [disdainfully, looking disappointed and disgusted]: Nah! <\p> 

<p> Ling [grabbing Mulan's shoulder and leaning on her, she takes his hand off and shakes her head disapprovingly.  Ling leans against the <\p> 
<p> carriage of cannons]: <\p> 
<p> My manly ways and turns of  <\p> 
<p> phrase are sure to thrill her <\p> 

<p> Yao [hitting Khan so that the carriage runs out from under Ling.  Ling looks upset then falls in the mud]: <\p> 
<p> He thinks he's such a  <\p> 
<p> lady-killer! <\p> 

<p> Chi Fu: <\p> 
<p> I've a girl back home who's  <\p> 
<p> unlike any other. <\p> 

<p> Yao [aside to Mulan]: <\p> 
<p> Yeah, the only girl who'd  <\p> 
<p> love him is his mother! [Mulan smiles] <\p> 

<p> Army Men [lining up locking arms across each others shoulders with Mulan in the middle to her discontent]: <\p> 
<p> But when we come home  <\p> 
<p> in victory they'll line up  <\p> 
<p> at the door! <\p> 

<p> Ling [sitting on top of Chien-Po]: <\p> 
<p> What do we want? <\p> 

<p> Army Chorus: <\p> 
<p> A girl worth fighting for! <\p> 

<p> Ling: <\p> 
<p> Wish that I had <\p> 

<p> Army Chorus [Mulan breaks away and walks in the opposite direction of the army]: <\p> 
<p> A girl worth fighting for! <\p> 
<p> (whistle) [Mulan sees Ling, Yao, and Chien-Po with snowballs about to pelt her so she turns around]  <\p> 
<p> A girl worth fighting-- <\p> 

<p> [All have stunned looks on their faces] <\p> 

<p> [End Song] <\p> 

<p> [Cut to ruins of a burned out village.  The soldiers walk through the singed gate and look around at the few planks that remain from the <\p> 
<p> buildings] <\p> 

<p> Shang [from mounted horse]:  Search for survivors. <\p> 

<p> [Cut to Mulan walking around the burned-out village.  She finds a the doll that Shan-Yu was holding and looks up sorrowfully.  Shang <\p> 
<p> comes to her side] <\p> 

<p> Shang:  I don't understand.  My father should have been here. <\p> 

<p> Chi Fu [calling out from the top of a hill overlooking a valley]:  Captain!   <\p> 

<p> [Chi Fu points down to the valley where the remains of General Li's army can be seen.  Flags poking up out of the snow, armor lying face <\p> 
<p> down, broken cannon carts.  Ling, Yao, Mulan, and a soldier have the look of horror on their faces as they look into the valley.  Chien-Po <\p> 
<p> walks up from the valley carrying a helmet] <\p> 

<p> Chien-po [handing the helmet to Shang]:  ...the General. <\p> 

<p> [Shang takes the helmet and walks to the edge of the hill.  He draws his sword and stabs it into the snow upright.  He kneels down and <\p> 
<p> places the helmet on top of the sword.  Mulan approaches him from behind] <\p> 

<p> Mulan [softly]:  I'm sorry. <\p> 

<p> [Shang gets up, turns around and puts his hand on Mulan's shoulder and he walks by.  Shang walks to the center of the troops. He grabs his <\p> 
<p> horse by the saddle, takes one quick look of grief then mounts his horse] <\p> 

<p> Shang:  The Huns are moving quickly.  We'll make better time to the Imperial City through the Tung Shao Pass.  We're the only hope for the <\p> 
<p> Emperor now.  Move out! <\p> 

<p> [Mulan looks at the sword, takes out the doll she found and places the doll at the base of the sword.  She turns around and joins the rest of <\p> 
<p> the troops marching on] <\p> 

<p> [Cut to Mulan standing next to Khan saddled to the cart with cannons.  A cannon blast shoots out of the cart and explodes in the air.  The <\p> 
<p> troops look surprised.  Mulan glances back with a scowl into the hole in the canopy of the cart to see Mushu with a sorrowful face.  Mushu <\p> 
<p> points at Cri-Kee.  Shang charges up to Mulan on his horse, Chi Fu right behind] <\p> 

<p> Shang [angrily]:  What happened?! <\p> 

<p> Mulan [stumbling]:  Uhhh-- <\p> 

<p> Shang:  You just gave away our position.  Now we're--[an arrow hits Shang in the shoulder as he falls to the ground.  Shang pulls out the <\p> 
<p> arrow]  [calling out] Get out of range!! <\p> 

<p> [The troops hurriedly run away as many arrows start falling all around them.  Mulan pulls Khan by the reins to hurry him up.  Fire arrows <\p> 
<p> start hitting the cart with cannons attached to Khan.  The cart begins to blaze with fire] <\p> 

<p> Shang:  Save the cannons! <\p> 

<p> [The troops form a human chain and start taking the cannons out of the burning cart one by one while Mulan steadies Khan to keep him <\p> 
<p> from bolting.  Chien-Po grabs many and hauls them on his own.  The troops grab]as many cannons as they safely can and Mulan cuts Khan <\p> 
<p> free from the cart.  She mounts Khan and charges away from the fire.  The cart explodes sending Mulan flying off Khan losing her helmet <\p> 
<p> and sword which land near her.  Mushu and Cri-Kee, sent flying by the blast, scream and land near Mulan. <\p> 

<p> Mushu:  Oh sure, save the horse. <\p> 

<p> [Mulan grabs Mushu with her right hand and grabs the sword with her left and runs to the troops position.  Cri-Kee and Khan follow.  Yao, <\p> 
<p> Ling, Chien-Po and other recruits set up cannons against rocks.  They dodge a set of arrows that fall around them] <\p> 

<p> Shang:  Fire! <\p> 

<p> [They launch a volley at the mountain where the archers are stationed.  As the cannon fire explodes, Shan-Yu's army hides] <\p> 

<p> Shang:  Fire! <\p> 

<p> [Mulan, Ling and Chien-Po launch a second volley at the mountain where the archers are stationed.  No more arrows can be seen coming <\p> 
<p> from the mountain position] <\p> 

<p> Shang:  Hold the last cannon.  [Yao poised to light his cannon, pauses.  Shan-Yu and his troops appear at the top of the mountain]  Prepare <\p> 
<p> to fight.  If we die, we die with honor. <\p> 

<p> [Shan-Yu raises his sword high above his head and charges down the mountain at Shang's position.  His falcon flies off his shoulder on <\p> 
<p> Shan-Yu's war cry  The Hun army follows] <\p> 

<p> Shang:  Yao, aim the cannon at Shan-Yu. <\p> 

<p> [The line of Shang's troops with Mulan at the end draw their swords.  Mulan looks down at her sword and sees the reflection of a large snow <\p> 
<p> embankment hanging to the side of a cliff.  She rushes forward] <\p> 

<p> Yao [being pushed aside by Mulan as she grabs the cannon]:  Hey. <\p> 
<p> Shang:  Ping, come back.  Ping! <\p> 

<p> [Mulan charges forward towards the oncoming horde of the Hun army being led by Shan-Yu and his falcon.  Mushu looks over her at the <\p> 
<p> oncoming horde with worry in his eyes] <\p> 

<p> Shang [starting to run after her waving his arms]:  Stop! <\p> 

<p> [Mulan plants the cannon and aims it for the cliff with the snow overhang] <\p> 

<p> Mushu [seeing Shan-Yu riding closer to their position]:  All right, you might want to light that right about now.  Quickly!  Quickly! <\p> 

<p> [Mulan takes out the flint and tries to light the fuse.  Shan-Yu's falcon swoops buy knocking Mulan down scattering the flint rock] <\p> 

<p> Yao [speaking to Ling and Chien-Po]:  C'mon, we've gotta help.  [they charge towards Mulan's position] <\p> 

<p> [Mulan searches for the flint in the snow in vain.  She sees Mushu, grabs him and stretches him causing him to light the fuse.  Mushu lands <\p> 
<p> on the cannon and the cannon fires off just above the charging Shan-Yu] <\p> 

<p> Mushu [tailing off as he rides the cannon toward the snow embankment]:  You missed him!  How could you miss?  He was three feet in <\p> 
<p> front of you! <\p> 

<p> [The cannon lodges in the snow and explodes causing the beginning of a large avalanche.  Mulan looks up with an evil grin on her face and <\p> 
<p> Shan-Yu watches in horror as many of his troops begin to be swallowed up by the snow] <\p> 

<p> Shan-Yu [recollecting himself and focusing in on Mulan]:  Yrrrrrrraah.   <\p> 

<p> [Shan-Yu swipes at Mulan with his sword hitting her in the right side.  Mulan falls back grabbing her right side.  Shan-Yu's horse stumbles.  <\p> 
<p> Mulan uses this break to bolt away from the avalanche.  Shan-Yu gains his composure and starts to gallop away from the avalanche on his <\p> 
<p> horse.  Shang looks with shock as hee sees the avalanche coming toward him.   Mulan grabs Shang as she passes by him, turning him <\p> 
<p> around and helping him run away from the avalanche] <\p> 

<p> Yao, Chien-Po and Ling [running towards the oncoming avalanche]:  Yeeahhhhhh!  [they stop.  noticing the oncoming avalanche they  turn <\p> 
<p> around and run back to where they came from]  Waaaaaaaaaa! <\p> 

<p> [Khan jumps away from the troops position and starts to run towards Mulan passing Ling, Yao and Chien-Po. The avalanche swallows up <\p> 
<p> Shan-Yu and his horse.  Khan arrives at Mulan's position just ahead of the avalanche.  Mulan jumps onto Khan and reaches for Shang.  She <\p> 
<p> grabs his hand, then the avalanche rushes forth breaking their grip, turning Khan around facing the oncoming avalanche of snow] <\p> 

<p> [Cut to Ling, Yao and Chien-Po standing behind a rock.  They see the snow approaching close and run to larger shelter where the rest of <\p> 
<p> Shang's army is positioned just as the avalance reaches their posision] <\p> 

<p> [Cut to Mushu riding down the snow on a shield] <\p> 

<p> Mushu [calling out]:  Mulan!  Mulan!  [seeing hair sticking up from the snow] Mulan?  [Mushu picks up the Hun by the hair] <\p> 

<p> Hun Soldier:  Arrrrr. <\p> 

<p> Mushu [pushing the hun soldier back under the snow]:  Nope.  Mulan!  [Mushu picks up Cri-Kee out of the snow]  Man, you are one lucky <\p> 
<p> bug. <\p> 

<p> [Cut to Mulan riding Khan above the snow into the teeth of the avalanche.  Khan and Mulan are swept under by the snow and reemerge <\p> 
<p> quickly.  She looks back and sees Shang passed out riding the wave of snow] <\p> 

<p> Mulan [calling loudly]:  Shang, Shang!  [Mulan turns around and rides to Shang's position.  She picks him up and places him on Khan.  She <\p> 
<p> turns Khan around again to be riding upstream] <\p> 

<p> [Cut to Chien-Po with Ling standing on him and Yao standing on top of Ling] <\p> 

<p> Chien-Po:  Do you see them? <\p> 

<p> Yao [extatically]:  Yes! [Yao shoots an arrow with a rope attached]  Perfect!  Now I'll pull them to safe--[Yao grasps at air as the rope <\p> 
<p> completely passed through his hands]--ty. <\p> 

<p> [Cut to Mulan and Shang on Khan with Mushu and Cri-Kee riding up to her on his shield] <\p> 

<p> Mushu [riding on the shield up to Mulan, Khan and Shang speaking loudly, above the noise of the avalanche]:  Hey Mulan, I found a lucky <\p> 
<p> cricket. <\p> 

<p> Mulan [speaking loudly]:  We need help!  [Yao's arrow lands near by Mulan and she picks it up and starts to tie the rope to Khan] <\p> 

<p> Mushu [Getting off the shield and carrying Cri-Kee with him]:  Ooo, nice, very nice, you can sit by me.  [Mushu sees that they're about to fall <\p> 
<p> over the cliff.  He and Cri-Kee look frightened] Ahhhhh!  We're gonna die!  We're gonna die!  I know we're gonna die!  No way we can <\p> 
<p> survive this!  Death is coming! [Mulan knocks the arrow and shoots it toward Yao] <\p> 

<p> Yao [crying]:  I let them slip through my fingers. [Mulan's arrow lands in Yao's hands.  He grabs on and is pulled toward the cliff, the soldiers <\p> 
<p> grab onto Yao and hold him steady near the cliff edge with the rope taught over the cliff] <\p> 

<p> Yao:  Pull <\p> 

<p> [Chien-Po prays as he calmly walks up to the group of soldiers.  He lifts them all up and pulls backward hauling Mulan, Shang, Khan, Mushu <\p> 
<p> and Cri-Kee to safety] <\p> 

<p> Mushu:  I knew we could to it.  You da man. [Mulan looks pleased] Well sorta. [Mulan grimaces] <\p> 

<p> [The soldiers help them up to the cliff] <\p> 

<p> Ling:  Step back guys, give 'em some air. <\p> 

<p> Shang [catching his breath]:  Ping, you are the craziest man I've ever met.  And for that I owe you my life.  From now on, you have my trust. <\p> 
<p> [Mulan smiles big] <\p> 

<p> Ling:  Let's hear it for Ping!  The bravest of us all. <\p> 

<p> Yao [lifting his arm high]:  You're king of the mountain! <\p> 

<p> Chien-Po [jumping up and down]:  Yes, yes, yes! <\p> 

<p> Mulan [beginning to stand up]:  Ahhh, [she clutches her right side] <\p> 

<p> Shang:  Ping, what's wrong?  [Mulan removes her hand slightly to show the blood on her hand and seeping through the armour] [loudly]  <\p> 
<p> He's wounded, get help!  [Ping starts to pass out.  The images of Shang, Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po begin to fade as she loses consciousness]  <\p> 
<p> Ping, hold on.  Hold on. <\p> 

<p> [Cut to outside of the medic tent.  Mulan and Medic are inside.  Shang stands by the entrance.  Yao, Ling and Chien-Po look quite <\p> 
<p> concerned.  Ling drums his fingers on his knees.  The medic comes out from the tent and whispers to Shang.  Shang looks astonished and <\p> 
<p> goes into the tent.  Mulan is lying down.  She opens her eyes, sees Shang and smiles at the sight of him.  She sits up allowing the blanket to <\p> 
<p> fall to her waist revealing her form fitting bandages on her chest.  She sees Shang's surprised look and realizes her feminine form is <\p> 
<p> noticeable] <\p> 

<p> Mulan [gasping as she covers up]: Huh,  I can explain. <\p> 

<p> Chi Fu [stepping into the tent]:  Huh?  So it's true. <\p> 

<p> Mulan [calling after Shang as he steps out of the tent]:  Shang! <\p> 

<p> [Cut to outside the tent.  Chi Fu hauls out Mulan by the arm.  Mulan uses her other hand to hold the blanket] <\p> 

<p> Chi Fu:  I knew there was something wrong with you.  [Chi Fu takes off Mulan's hair tie and throws her to the ground]  A woman. <\p> 

<p> [Ling, Yao and Chien-Po are shocked] <\p> 

<p> Chi Fu [to the troops]:  Trecherous snake. <\p> 

<p> Mulan [on the ground kneeling and hunched over, speaking to Shang]:  My name is Mulan.  I did it to save my father. <\p> 

<p> Chi Fu [to the troops]:  High treason! <\p> 

<p> Mulan:  I didn't mean for it to go this far. <\p> 

<p> Chi Fu [getting in Mulan's face and speaking to her while she whinces]:  Ultimate dishonor. <\p> 

<p> Mulan:  It was the only way.  Please believe me. <\p> 

<p> Chi Fu [to Shang]:  Hmph, Captain? <\p> 

<p> [Shang walks over to Khan and takes the sword out of the scabbard attached to Khan.  Khan rears back] <\p> 

<p> Chi Fu [to the soldier by Khan]:  Restrain him. <\p> 

<p> [Shang walks toward Mulan with sword in hand] <\p> 

<p> Yao, Ling and Chien-Po [rushing toward Mulan]:  Noooooo! <\p> 

<p> Chi Fu [putting his hand to stop Ling, Yao, and Chien-Po from proceeding further]:  You know the law. <\p> 

<p> [Shang stands over Mulan.  Mulan looks at Shang then bows her head in anticipation.  Shang lifts the sword high above his head and throws <\p> 
<p> it down in front of Mulan] <\p> 

<p> Shang:  A life for a life.  My debt is repaid.  [turns and walks towards the Imperial City]  Move out! <\p> 

<p> Chi Fu [coming up to Shang's face]:  But you can't just... <\p> 

<p> Shang [getting in Chi Fu's face]:  I said, "Move out!" <\p> 

<p> [The troops walk off toward the Imperial City leaving Mulan behind with Khan, Cri-Kee, and Mushu.  Mulan is sitting, shivering. Khan takes <\p> 
<p> his blanket and wraps it around Mulan with his mouth and sits behind her.  Cri-Kee lights a fire with twigs.  When he doesn't get warm, he <\p> 
<p> moves under the blanket wrapped around Mulan.  Mushu walks toward Mulan carrying a stick] <\p> 

<p> Mushu:  I was this close, this close to impressing the ancestors, getting the top shelf, an entourage.  Man, all my fine work, ffft.  [Mushu picks <\p> 
<p> up a dumpling with his stick, slumps down in front of the fire Cri-Kee made and begins to cook the dumpling over the fire] [glancing up] Hi. <\p> 

<p> Mulan [look of sadness]:  I should never have left home. <\p> 

<p> Mushu:  Eh, come on, you wanted to save your father's life.  Who knew you'd end up shaming him, disgracing your ancestors, and losing all <\p> 
<p> your friends.  You know, you just gotta, you gotta learn to let these things go [looking as if he's about to cry]. <\p> 

<p> Mulan:  Maybe I didn't go for my father.  Maybe what I really wanted was to prove I could do things right.  So when I looked in the mirror <\p> 
<p> [picking up her helmet and looking at her reflection in her helmet] I'd see someone worthwhile.  But I was wrong.  I see nothing.  [throws the <\p> 
<p> helmet down and a tear runs down her cheek] <\p> 

<p> Mushu [picking up the helmet and spitting on it]:  Well that's because this just needs a little spit, that's all.  Let me shine this up for ya [wiping <\p> 
<p> the spit to clean the helmet and holding it up to Mulan].   I can see you, look at you, you look so pretty.  [seeing Mulan is not cheered up by <\p> 
<p> his actions, he shows sorrow on his face]  The truth is we're both frauds.  Your ancestors never sent me, they don't even like me.  I mean, <\p> 
<p> you risked your life to help people you love.  I risked your life to help myself.  At least you had good intentions  [Mulan smiles]. <\p> 

<p> Cri-Kee [jumping on top of the helmet beginning to bawl]:  Chirp, Chirp, Chirp.  Bawl, Bawl. <\p> 

<p> Mushu:  What!?  What do you mean you're not lucky?  You lied to me?  [Cri-Kee nods] [to Khan]  And what are you? A sheep? <\p> 

<p> Mulan [sadly]:  I'll have to face my father sooner or later.  Let's go home. <\p> 

<p> Mushu:  Yeah, this ain't gonna be pretty.  But, don't you worry, 'kay?  Things'll work out.  We started this thing together and that's how we'll <\p> 
<p> finish. [Mushu hugs Mulan.  Mulan smiles]  I promise. <\p> 

<p> [Cut to Shan-Yu's falcon flying over the avalanche site.  Shan-Yu's hand pops out of the snow.  He gets up and glances around] <\p> 

<p> Shan-Yu [screaming]:  Rrrrrrraaaaaaaaahhh! <\p> 

<p> [Hun Archer, Long-Hair Hun Man, Hun Strong Guy, Hun Bald Man #1, and Hun Bald Man #2 each pop out of the snow and join <\p> 
<p> Shan-Yu.  They set off towards the Imperial City] <\p> 

<p> Mulan [seeing them from behind, gasps]:  Huh.  [Mulan runs, grabs her sword, mounts Khan, and heads out following the Huns to the <\p> 
<p> Imperial City] <\p> 

<p> Mushu:  Home is that way! [points to the opposite direction Mulan is heading] <\p> 

<p> Mulan:  I have to do something. <\p> 

<p> Mushu:  Did you see those Huns!?  They popped out of the snow, like daisies! <\p> 

<p> Mulan:  Are we in this together or not? <\p> 

<p> Cri-Kee [emphatically]:  Chirp, Chirp. <\p> 

<p> Mushu:  Well, let's go kick some Huny buns!  [Jumps onto Khan and utters fighting words as they ride off to the Imperial City]  Wu Hu Ha <\p> 
<p> Ga, Wu Hu Ha Ga <\p> 

<p> [Cut to the victory parade in the Imperial City.  Fireworks go off, kites are flying.  The drummers march by, followed by the flutist, followed <\p> 
<p> by the acrobats.  The Parade Leader follows, then Shang and his men, followed by lion dancers] <\p> 

<p> Parade Leader:  Make way for the heros of China. <\p> 

<p> [Shang leads the men on horseback, all have sorrowful looks on their faces.  Mulan rides up through the crowd and stops.  She looks around <\p> 
<p> and sees Shang in the parade] <\p> 

<p> Mulan [calling out]:  Shang! [riding next to him] <\p> 

<p> Shang [surprised]:  Mulan? <\p> 

<p> Mulan:  The Huns are alive, they're in the city. <\p> 

<p> Shang:  You don't belong here Mulan, go home. <\p> 

<p> Mulan [with a scowl rides khan to the other side of Shang]:  Shang, I saw them in the mountains.  You have to believe me. <\p> 

<p> Shang:  Why should I? <\p> 

<p> Mulan [riding ahead to block Shang's horse]:  Why else would I come back?  You said you'd trust Ping.  Why is Mulan any different? <\p> 

<p> [Shang turns his horse and rides around Mulan and goes forward] <\p> 

<p> Mulan [to Yao, Chien-Po and Ling]:  Keep your eyes open.  I know they're here.  Hya. <\p> 

<p> [Mulan rides off and stops near the entrance to the palace, she dismounts Khan and runs into the palace yard] <\p> 

<p> Mushu:  Now where are you going? <\p> 

<p> Mulan [calling over her shoulder]:  To find someone who will believe me.  [Mulan runs into the palace yard]   <\p> 

<p> [Cut to the parade procession stopping in front of the Emperor on the steps of the palace.  Chi Fu stands next to Shang and gives him <\p> 
<p> Shan-Yu's sword.  The Lion dancers stop behind Shang.  A palace man strikes a large gong and the people fall silent] <\p> 

<p> Emperor:  My children, heaven smiles down upon the Middle Kingdom.  China will sleep safely tonight thanks to our brave warriors. <\p> 

<p> [The crowd cheers] <\p> 

<p> [Cut to Mulan at the fringe of the crowd] <\p> 

<p> Mulan [approaching Man #1 laying her hand on his shoulder]:  Sir, the Emperor's in danger! [Man #1 rips his shoulder away from Mulan's <\p> 
<p> touch and moves away] [agitated]  But the Huns are here!  [Mulan walks up to Man #2]  Please, you have to help me.  [Man #2 walks <\p> 
<p> away from Mulan] [turning to Mushu who is standing near her in the yard]  No one will listen! <\p> 

<p> Mushu:  Huh?  Oh, I'm sorry, did you say something? <\p> 

<p> Mulan [irritatedly]:  Mushu! <\p> 

<p> Mushu:  Hey, you're a girl again, remember? <\p> 

<p> [Cut to Shang holding the sword before the Emperor] <\p> 

<p> Shang [kneeling down giving the sword to the Emperor]:  Your Majesty, I present to you the sword of Shan-Yu. <\p> 

<p> Emperor:  I know what this means to you, Captain Li.  Your father would have been very proud. <\p> 

<p> [Shan-Yu's falcon swoops down and takes the sword as Shang is giving it to the Emperor.  The falcon rises above the roof and drops the <\p> 
<p> sword to Shan-Yu who was sitting next to the gargoyles in the shadows blending in.  He rises out of the shadows to catch the sword so that <\p> 
<p> all the people can see his face.  The masses of people gasp at the sight of Shan-Yu.  Shang begins to draw his sword.  All 5 of Shan-Yu's <\p> 
<p> men jump out from behind the dragon knocking down Shang and grab the Emperor knocking off his hat.  Hun Bald Man #1 and #2 carry <\p> 
<p> the Emperor into the Palace.  Long-Haired Hun Man and Hun Strong Guy close the palace doors as Hun archer knocks his arrow retreating <\p> 
<p> into the Palace to threaten would be rescue attempts] <\p> 

<p> Shang [getting up and running toward the closing doors]:  No. <\p> 

<p> Yao [beckoning to the other soldiers]:  C'mon. <\p> 

<p> [Shang reaches the palace doors just as they close with all the Huns inside] <\p> 

<p> Shan-Yu [laughs evily]:  Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha. <\p> 

<p> [Shang and his soldiers pick up a big stone statue and use it as a battering ram.  They are unsuccessful at opening the door.  Mulan sees <\p> 
<p> what's going on and arrives at the steps] <\p> 

<p> Mulan [to herself]:  They'll never reach the Emperor in time.  [She looks at the columns and runs near to the Shang and his soldiers.  She <\p> 
<p> whistles loudly catching the soldiers' attention]  Hey guys, I've got an idea.  [Mulan runs around the palace to the right towards the columns] <\p> 

<p> [Song:  I'll Make a Man Out of You (reprise) plays in the background during the next action sequence] <\p> 

<p> (Be a man)  <\p> 
<p> We must be swift as  <\p> 
<p> the coursing river <\p> 
<p> (Be a man) <\p> 
<p> With all the force  <\p> 
<p> of a great typhoon <\p> 
<p> (Be a man) <\p> 
<p> With all the strength  <\p> 
<p> of a raging fire <\p> 
<p> Mysterious as the  <\p> 
<p> dark side of the moon <\p> 

<p> [Yao, Ping and Chien-Po look at one another then drop the statue and follow Mulan.  Shang looks astonished.  Around the corner Yao, Ling <\p> 
<p> and Chien-Po begin to take off their armor and dress as women.  Once the transformation is complete, they take out their sashes and <\p> 
<p> prepare to shimmy up the columns.  Shang arrives and taps Mulan on the shoulder.  He takes off his cape and wraps it around the column <\p> 
<p> to signify that he's coming along.  They shimmy up the poles together] <\p> 

<p> [End song] <\p> 

<p> [Cut to Hun Bald Man #1 and #2 arriving with the Emperor and a high balcony within the palace.  Shan-Yu drops down from the roof] <\p> 

<p> Shan-Yu:  Boo.  [Shan-Yu steps into the balcony next to the Emperor] [to Hun Bald Man #1 and #2] Guard the door [they walk off down <\p> 
<p> the stairs that lead to the balcony].  [pacing around the Emperor]  Your walls and armies have fallen, and now it's your turn.  Bow to me. <\p> 

<p> [Cut to the entrance to the stairwell that leads to the balcony.  Hun Bald Man #1 and #2 come down the stairs and close the door, joining <\p> 
<p> Hun Archer Man, Hun Strong Man and Hun Long-Hair Man.  Mulan and company are around the corner] <\p> 

<p> Mulan [whispering]:  Okay, any questions? <\p> 

<p> Yao [whispering]:  Does this dress make me look fat? [Mulan slaps him]  Ow. <\p> 

<p> [Mulan, Yao, Ling and Chien-Po walk out smiling, giggling and trying to act lady-like including holding fans and waving fans] <\p> 

<p> Hun Archer:  Who's there? <\p> 

<p> Hun Bald Man #2 [putting down Hun Bald Man #1's sword]:  Concubines. <\p> 

<p> Hun Bald Man #1:  Ugly concubines. <\p> 

<p> Ling [waving daintily, speaking to Yao]:  Oh he's so cute. <\p> 

<p> [Hun Bald Man #2 smiles and waves back.  Hun Bald Man #1 elbows Hun Bald Man #2.  A bitten apple falls out from beneath Ling's <\p> 
<p> dress.  He pulls the dress out and turns so as not to expose the loss of figure] <\p> 

<p> Shang [from around the corner putting his head down into his hand]:  Aww. <\p> 

<p> [Shan-Yu's Falcon sees Shang and starts to squawk.  Mushu from above singes off all his feathers with his fire breathing] <\p> 

<p> Mushu [to Cri-Kee sitting above him]:  Now that's what I call Mongolian Barbeque.  [Cri-Kee rolls on his back in laughter.  The stunned <\p> 
<p> falcon doesn't do anything] <\p> 

<p> [Hun Bald Man #2 picks up the apple and offers it back to Ling.  Ling, Yao, and Chien-Po pull out the fruit they were using to simulate a <\p> 
<p> woman's chest.  Chien-Po takes his watermelons and smashes them on the heads of Hun Bald Man #1 and #2.  He then smashes their two <\p> 
<p> heads together and they fall to the ground.  Ling pushes the apple into Hun Long-Hair man's mouth and kicks him in the stomach causing <\p> 
<p> Hun Long-Hair Man to stoop over on the ground.  Ling uses his head to crack Hun Long-Hair Man's back.  Hun Strong Guy lunges his fist <\p> 
<p> at Yao and misses, he misses with the other.  Yao grabs the outstretched arm and flips him over onto his head. Mulan kicks away Hun <\p> 
<p> Archer Man's bow and knocked arrow, avoids his strike by turning her back to Hun Archer.  She follows with a left elbow to the stomach <\p> 
<p> followed by a left upper cut knocking Hun Archer to the ground.  She sits on his back and uses the bow to pull his head back] <\p> 

<p> Mulan [calling out]:  Shang, GO! <\p> 

<p> [Shang runs out from behind the corner, charges through the door and runs up the stairs] <\p> 

<p> [Cut to Shan-Yu and the Emperor on the balcony] <\p> 

<p> Shan-Yu:  I tire of your arrogance old man.  [yelling and putting his sword at the emperor's <\p> 
<p> throat] Bow to me! <\p> 

<p> Emperor:  No matter how the wind howls, the mountain cannot bow to it. <\p> 

<p> Shan-Yu:  Then you will kneel in pieces. [Shan-Yu draws back his sword to strike the Emperor] <\p> 

<p> [Shang runs up in time to block the striking blow of Shan-Yu with his sword.  Shang swipes with <\p> 
<p> his sword.  Shan-Yu grabs Shang's arm and throws him towards the edge.  Shang grabs onto a column <\p> 
<p> and he flies over the edge and uses the momentum to swing back and kick Shan-Yu.  Shan-Yu falls <\p> 
<p> to the ground, Shang on top of him. Shang punches Shan-Yu.  Shan-Yu grabs Shang and rolls over <\p> 
<p> forcing Shang to be on his back underneath him.  Shang uses his knee to hit Shan-Yu from behind <\p> 
<p> as he uses his hand to hit him in the head.  Shang forces Shan-Yu onto his back and grabs his arm <\p> 
<p> pulling it behind Shan-Yu's back.  Mulan, Chien-Po, Yao and Ling enter the balcony from the <\p> 
<p> stairs] <\p> 

<p> Mulan:  Chien-Po, get the Emperor. <\p> 

<p> Chien-Po [standing in front of the Emperor and bowing]:  Sorry, your Majesty.   <\p> 

<p> [Chien-Po lifts up the Emperor and runs over to Mulan who is by a rope attached to a column in <\p> 
<p> the balcony.  Chien-Po uses his sash as a pulley and rides down the rope to the ground.  Shan Yu <\p> 
<p> watches the Emperor leave] <\p> 

<p> Shan-Yu:  No!  <\p> 
<p> [Shan-Yu uses his free arm to elbow Shang in the face.  Shan-Yu gets up and head-butts Shang and <\p> 
<p> throws him to the ground.  Shang lies limp.  Mulan watches Shang fall then she looks over the <\p> 
<p> edge at Ling and Yao now on the ground.  Chien-Po runs off the screen out of sight] <\p> 

<p> Yao [motioning her to follow]:  Come on! <\p> 

<p> [Mulan looks down at Shang with a worried look.  Shan-Yu begins to approach Mulan and the rope.  <\p> 
<p> Mulan looks at the approaching Shan-Yu and then down to spy his sword. Thinking quickly, Mulan grabs <\p> 
<p> Shan-Yu's sword and cuts the taught rope.  Shan-Yu reaches the edge and grabs for the falling rope unsuccessfully as Mulan leaves the <\p> 
<p> sword embedded in the column and runs to Shang's position.  The crowd cheers] <\p> 

<p> Shan-Yu:  No!  [He looks down at the crowd and realizes he cannot find the Emperor among the <\p> 
<p> throng of people]  Yrraaaaahhhh! <\p> 

<p> [Shan-Yu turns and looks back and sees Mulan looking concerned, holding up Shang.  Shan-Yu pulls <\p> 
<p> out his sword lodged in the column and heads toward them.  As Shang sees Shan-Yu approaching, he <\p> 
<p> puts his arm in front of Mulan to ask her to leave and takes out his knife.  Mulan slides away.  <\p> 
<p> Shan-Yu comes up to Shang, knocks away his knife, slaps him in the face, and grabs Shang by the <\p> 
<p> shirt collar] <\p> 

<p> Shan-Yu [in Shang's face]:  You, you took away my victory. <\p> 

<p> [Mulan's shoe hits Shan-Yu in the head and bounces back to her feet.  Shan-Yu turns toward Mulan] <\p> 

<p> Mulan:  No!  I did!  [Mulan pulls her hair back to look like she did when she was a soldier] <\p> 

<p> Shan-Yu [looking at Mulan]:  The soldier from the mountains. <\p> 

<p> [Shan-Yu drops Shang and starts after Mulan as she puts on her shoe and runs down the stairs and <\p> 
<p> through the doors to the balcony.  She closes the door with the latch falling in place right <\p> 
<p> behind her.  She leans against the doors.  Shan-Yu punches a hole in one door with his fist.  <\p> 
<p> Mulan runs away from the doors down the corridor.  Mushu riding Shan-Yu's falcon like a horse <\p> 
<p> catches up with Mulan] <\p> 

<p> Mushu:  So what's the plan? <\p> 

<p> Mulan:  Ummmm. <\p> 

<p> Mushu:  You don't have a plan?! <\p> 

<p> Mulan:  Hey, I'm making this up as I...[looks out a window and spies the firework tower] go.  <\p> 
<p> Mushu-- <\p> 

<p> Mushu:  I'm way ahead of you sister.  C'mon Cri-Kee. [Mushu and Cri-Kee jump onto a kite and use <\p> 
<p> the wings to soar over toward the fireworks tower] <\p> 

<p> [Cut to Shan-Yu.  Shan-Yu breaks through the doors and catches up to Mulan swinging his sword <\p> 
<p> wildly knocking down a support column with every swipe.  Mulan runs and ducks his every blow.  <\p> 
<p> Mulan climbs up a column to get out of Shan-Yu's reach.  Shan-Yu slices the base of the column <\p> 
<p> causing it to fall and break through the outer wall.  Mulan screams as the beam falls and comes <\p> 
<p> to a stop.  Mulan gets up on the beam and jumps up to catch onto the awning.  She looks off to <\p> 
<p> her right and spies Mushu arriving at the fireworks tower] <\p> 

<p> [Zoom in on the fireworks tower.  Mushu lands near Barry Cook and Tony Bancroft (the firework <\p> 
<p> lighters) on the edge of the tower]  <\p> 

<p> Mushu:  Citizens, I need firepower. <\p> 

<p> Barry Cook:  Who are you? <\p> 

<p> Mushu [Mushu (using the wings from the kite) and Cri-Kee with wings spread like batman]:  You're <\p> 
<p> worst nightmare. <\p> 

<p> [Barry Cook and Tony Bancroft jump off the tower and plunge toward the ground] <\p> 

<p> [Cut to Mulan. She pulls herself onto the roof and climbs up to the crest] <\p> 

<p> Man in Crowd #1:  On the roof. <\p> 

<p> Man in Crowd #2:  Look! <\p> 

<p> [Mulan lines up where she is standing with the fireworks tower across the way.  Shan-Yu breaks <\p> 
<p> through the roof behind Mulan surprising her.  Mulan backs away and searches for something on her <\p> 
<p> person to help her against Shan-Yu.  She finds a her fan, takes it out, and opens it] <\p> 

<p> Shan-Yu:  It looks like you're out of ideas. <\p> 

<p> [Shan-Yu lunges with his sword.  Mulan dodges to her right and lets the sword go right through <\p> 
<p> the fan.  She closes the fan back up on the sword and twists the fan with both hands so that <\p> 
<p> Shan-Yu loses his grip.  The sword flies toward Mulan and she catches it by the handle slipping <\p> 
<p> off the fan with her sword movement] <\p> 

<p> Mulan:  Not quite.  [calling out]  Ready, Mushu? <\p> 

<p> Mushu [behind Shan-Yu tied to a large rocket firework]:  I am ready, baby. [He blows fire onto a <\p> 
<p> stick and hands the stick to Cri-Kee who's standing on the firework]  Light me!  [Cri-Kee lights <\p> 
<p> the fuse] <\p> 

<p> [Shan-Yu approaches Mulan.  Using the sword as a lever, Mulan lunges at Shan-Yu kicking him in <\p> 
<p> the face then sweep kicks him and he falls to the ground.  Mulan picks the sword back up and <\p> 
<p> stabs it into Shan-Yu's cape.  The rocket on Mushu ignites and hurls him toward Shan-Yu.  Mulan <\p> 
<p> lies flat down on the left side of the roof.  Shan-Yu sees the approaching rocket and tries to <\p> 
<p> run, but the sword has him pinned to the spot.  The rocket hits Shan-Yu square in the belly <\p> 
<p> propelling him toward the firework tower.  Mushu grabbed onto the sword as he went by letting the <\p> 
<p> rocket do the work.  Cri-Kee hangs on to Mushu's tail.  Mulan jumps back up to the crest of the <\p> 
<p> roof and runs away from the fireworks tower grabbing Mushu and Cri-Kee off the sword] <\p> 

<p> Mulan [while running]:  Get off the roof, get off the roof, get off the roof. <\p> 

<p> [The rocket rides Shan-Yu into the fireworks tower causing masses of explosions and fireworks to <\p> 
<p> fly everywhere.  Mulan jumps near the edge of the roof.  Propelled by the explosion, she grabs <\p> 
<p> onto a lantern that is hanging on a taught rope and starts to slide down.  She looks down and <\p> 
<p> releases her grip so that she lands on the back of Shang causing the two of them to fall to the <\p> 
<p> ground.  Shan-Yu's sword follows and lands on the ground near by] <\p> 

<p> Mushu [landing and flying backwards on his butt a couple of times pointing at the fireworks]:  Ah <\p> 
<p> ha ha ha ha.  [Mushu's catches Cri-Kee with antenna on fire as Cri-Kee falls toward him] [to <\p> 
<p> Cri-Kee]  You are a lucky bug. [Mushu pinches out the fire on Cri-Kee's antenna] <\p> 

<p> Chi Fu [walking down the stairs in a tattered outfit and slightly burned]:  That was a deliberate <\p> 
<p> attempt on my life.  Where is she?  Now she's done it.  What a mess.  [Shang and troops push <\p> 
<p> Mulan behind them to protect her] [to Shang] Stand aside, that creature's not worth protecting. <\p> 

<p> Shang [in Chi Fu's face]:  She's a hero. <\p> 

<p> Chi Fu:  'Tis a woman.  She will never be worth anything. <\p> 

<p> Shang [grabbing Chi Fu by the shirt collar]:  Listen, you pompous-- <\p> 

<p> Emperor [walking down the steps]:  That is enough! <\p> 

<p> Shang:  Your Majesty, I can explain. <\p> 

<p> [The Emperor motions for Shang to stand aside.  Shang and his men part giving the Emperor a clear <\p> 
<p> path to Mulan.  Mulan steps forward and bows before the Emperor.  Chi Fu with a sinister look <\p> 
<p> waits to write down the words of the Emperor] <\p> 

<p> Emperor:  I've heard a great deal about you, Fa Mulan.  You stole your father's armor, ran away <\p> 
<p> from home, impersonated a soldier, deceived your commanding officer, dishonored the Chinese army, <\p> 
<p> destroyed my palace, AND...you have saved us all.  [the Emperor bows to Mulan] <\p> 

<p> [Chi Fu looks at the Emperor actions astonishingly then immediately falls prostrate before Mulan.  <\p> 
<p> Shang, Yao, Ling, and Chien-Po follow suit.  Mulan looks up then turns around hardly believing <\p> 
<p> what she sees as the entire Chinese population within the palace grounds fall prostrate on the <\p> 
<p> ground in a wave like pattern, bowing to her.  Khan bows with Mushu and Cri-Kee on his back] <\p> 

<p> Mushu:  My little baby's all grown up and savin' China.  [to Cri-Kee] You have a tissue? <\p> 

<p> Emperor:  Chi Fu, <\p> 

<p> Chi Fu:  Your Excellency? <\p> 

<p> Emperor:  See to it that this woman is made a member of my council. <\p> 

<p> Chi Fu [muttering to himself]:  A member of your coun...[realizing what the Emperor has said] <\p> 
<p> what? [stutters] But there are no council positions open, your Majesty. <\p> 

<p> Emperor [to Mulan]:  Very well then, you can have his job [pointing out Chi Fu]. <\p> 

<p> Chi Fu [wobbling to and fro]:  What?...My...[faints] <\p> 

<p> Mulan [smiles big then turns to the Emperor and bows]:  With all due respect, your Excellency.  I <\p> 
<p> have been away from home long enough. <\p> 

<p> Emperor [taking off his pendant]:  Then take this, so your family will know what you have done <\p> 
<p> for me.  And this [handing her the sword of Shan-Yu]  so the world will know what you have done <\p> 
<p> for China. <\p> 

<p> [Mulan takes the gifts and hugs the Emperor] <\p> 

<p> Yao:  Is she allowed to do that?  [Shang, Ling, and Chien-Po shrug] <\p> 

<p> [Mulan walks away from the Emperor and is embraced by Yao and Ling.  Chien-Po comes up and lifts <\p> 
<p> all three of them off the ground in a big bear hug.  Chien-Po lets them all back to the ground <\p> 
<p> again.  Mulan walks toward Shang and stops in front of him.  As Shang begins to speak Mulan <\p> 
<p> starts to smile anticipating something good] <\p> 

<p> Shang:  Um...[Mulan grins]  You... [Mulan smiles] You fight good. <\p> 

<p> Mulan [smile turning into disappointment]:  Oh, thank you.  [Mulan walks toward Khan] <\p> 

<p> Shang: [turning toward Mulan and grunts with disappointment in himself]:  Hmm. <\p> 

<p> [Mulan mounts Khan] <\p> 

<p> Mulan:  Khan, let's go home. <\p> 

<p> [Khan jumps down the steps and gallops on the flat parts of the stair case back down to ground <\p> 
<p> level.  The crowd cheers al the while.  The Emperor approaches Shang and clears his throat] <\p> 

<p> Emperor [to Shang]:  The flower that blooms in adversity is the most rare and beautiful of all. <\p> 

<p> Shang [dumbfounded]:  Sir? <\p> 

<p> Emperor:  You don't meet a girl like that ev'ry dynasty.  [The emperor puts on his hat and walks <\p> 
<p> back up the steps to his palace] <\p> 

<p> [Cut to Mulan's home, her father is sitting beneath the blossom tree.   A blossom falls and lands <\p> 
<p> on his leg.  Mulan appears at the threshold and moves toward her father.  Fa Zhou sees her <\p> 
<p> approaching and starts to stand] <\p> 

<p> Fa Zhou:  Mulan.   <\p> 

<p> [Mulan quickly moves in front of her father and kneels causing him to sit back down] <\p> 

<p> Mulan:  Father, I brought you the sword of Shan-Yu [hands the sword to Fa Zhou] and the crest of <\p> 
<p> the Emperor [hands the crest to Fa Zhou].  [with head bowed] They're gifts to honor the Fa <\p> 
<p> Family. <\p> 

<p> [Fa Zhou takes the gifts and throws them down to the ground beside him to the surprise of Mulan.  <\p> 
<p> He bends down and holds her arms outstretched] <\p> 

<p> Fa Zhou:  The greatest gift and honor, is having you for a daughter.  [Fa Zhou wipes away Mulan's <\p> 
<p> tear then hugs Mulan]  I've missed you so. <\p> 

<p> Mulan:  I've missed you too Baba. <\p> 

<p> [Fa li and Grandma Fa watch from the doorway] <\p> 

<p> Fa Li [sighing]:  Ahhhhh <\p> 

<p> Grandma Fa:  Great, she brings home a sword.  If you ask me she should have brought home a <\p> 
<p> ma--[leaving her mouth open when she sees Shang] <\p> 

<p> Shang [just arriving]:  Excuse me, does Fa Mulan live here? <\p> 

<p> [Grandma Fa's mouth stays open as she and Fa Li point toward Mulan's position.  Shang walks <\p> 
<p> toward Mulan and Fa Zhou] <\p> 

<p> Grandma Fa:  Woo, sign me up for the next war. <\p> 

<p> [Shang approaches seeing Fa Zhou] <\p> 

<p> Shang [bows before Fa Zhou and speaks confidently]:  Honorable Fa Zhou I--Mulan [Mulan steps up.  <\p> 
<p> Shang sees her and speaks insecurely] Uh...Uh...You forgot your helmet.  Ah but well, actually <\p> 
<p> it's your helmet, isn't it?...[handing the helmet toward Fa Zhou] I mean... <\p> 

<p> [Fa Zhou motions with his head for Mulan to take over.  Mulan holds the helmet Shang offers] <\p> 

<p> Mulan:  Would you like to stay for dinner? <\p> 

<p> Grandma Fa [speaking from stage right]:  Would you like to stay forever? [Mulan shakes her head with a <\p> 
<p> smile at Grandma Fa's statement] <\p> 

<p> Shang [reassuredly to Mulan]:  Dinner would be great. <\p> 

<p> [Cut to First Ancestor grinning happily looking at the scene through the temple window.  He watches Mulan hand the helmet back to Fa <\p> 
<p> Zhou.  Mushu climbs up to the window sill by First Ancestor's his head] <\p> 

<p> Mushu [tugging on First Ancestor's ear]:  C'mon, who did a good job?  C'mon, tell me who did a <\p> 
<p> good job. <\p> 

<p> First Ancestor [hesitantly]:  Oh, all right.  You can be a guardian again. <\p> 

<p> Mushu: Yeeeeeahhhhhhh.  [Mushu runs to his post and Cri-Kee bangs the gong awakening all the <\p> 
<p> ancestors] <\p> 

<p> Mushu:  Take it Cri-Kee. <\p> 

<p> [Song:  True to Your Heart -- No characters sing in the song] <\p> 

<p> [Ancestor 1 does a dance from Pulp Fiction while Ancestor 3 does the Hand Jive] <\p> 

<p> Ancestor 3 [spoken to Ancestor 1]:  She get's it from my side of the family. <\p> 

<p> Mushu [spoken while swinging on a chain]:  Call out for egg rolls! <\p> 

<p> First Ancestor [disgusted]:  Guardians. <\p> 

<p> [Mushu lands on the steps outside the temple.  Mulan walks up to him and rests besides him on the <\p> 
<p> steps] <\p> 

<p> Mulan:  Thanks, Mushu [kisses Mushu on the forehead]. <\p> 

<p> Little Brother:  Bark, bark, bark, bark, bark, bark, bark   <\p> 

<p> [Little brother runs up the steps and into the temple with the bag of grain tied to him.  The <\p> 
<p> chickens follow him in] <\p> 

<p> First Ancestor [annoyed]:  Mushu! <\p> 

<p> [Roll Credits] <\p> 

<p> [The End] <\p>
