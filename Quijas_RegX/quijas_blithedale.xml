<p> I. OLD MOODIE <\p> 

<p> The evening before my departure for Blithedale, I was returning to my <\p> 
<p> bachelor apartments, after attending the wonderful exhibition of the <\p> 
<p> Veiled Lady, when an elderly man of rather shabby appearance met me in <\p> 
<p> an obscure part of the street. <\p> 

<p> "Mr. Coverdale," said he softly, "can I speak with you a moment?" <\p> 

<p> As I have casually alluded to the Veiled Lady, it may not be amiss to <\p> 
<p> mention, for the benefit of such of my readers as are unacquainted with <\p> 
<p> her now forgotten celebrity, that she was a phenomenon in the mesmeric <\p> 
<p> line; one of the earliest that had indicated the birth of a new <\p> 
<p> science, or the revival of an old humbug.  Since those times her <\p> 
<p> sisterhood have grown too numerous to attract much individual notice; <\p> 
<p> nor, in fact, has any one of them come before the public under such <\p> 
<p> skilfully contrived circumstances of stage effect as those which at <\p> 
<p> once mystified and illuminated the remarkable performances of the lady <\p> 
<p> in question.  Nowadays, in the management of his "subject," <\p> 
<p> "clairvoyant," or "medium," the exhibitor affects the simplicity and <\p> 
<p> openness of scientific experiment; and even if he profess to tread a <\p> 
<p> step or two across the boundaries of the spiritual world, yet carries <\p> 
<p> with him the laws of our actual life and extends them over his <\p> 
<p> preternatural conquests.  Twelve or fifteen years ago, on the contrary, <\p> 
<p> all the arts of mysterious arrangement, of picturesque disposition, and <\p> 
<p> artistically contrasted light and shade, were made available, in order <\p> 
<p> to set the apparent miracle in the strongest attitude of opposition to <\p> 
<p> ordinary facts.  In the case of the Veiled Lady, moreover, the interest <\p> 
<p> of the spectator was further wrought up by the enigma of her identity, <\p> 
<p> and an absurd rumor (probably set afloat by the exhibitor, and at one <\p> 
<p> time very prevalent) that a beautiful young lady, of family and <\p> 
<p> fortune, was enshrouded within the misty drapery of the veil.  It was <\p> 
<p> white, with somewhat of a subdued silver sheen, like the sunny side of <\p> 
<p> a cloud; and, falling over the wearer from head to foot, was supposed <\p> 
<p> to insulate her from the material world, from time and space, and to <\p> 
<p> endow her with many of the privileges of a disembodied spirit. <\p> 

<p> Her pretensions, however, whether miraculous or otherwise, have little <\p> 
<p> to do with the present narrative--except, indeed, that I had <\p> 
<p> propounded, for the Veiled Lady's prophetic solution, a query as to the <\p> 
<p> success of our Blithedale enterprise.  The response, by the bye, was of <\p> 
<p> the true Sibylline stamp,--nonsensical in its first aspect, yet on <\p> 
<p> closer study unfolding a variety of interpretations, one of which has <\p> 
<p> certainly accorded with the event.  I was turning over this riddle in <\p> 
<p> my mind, and trying to catch its slippery purport by the tail, when the <\p> 
<p> old man above mentioned interrupted me. <\p> 

<p> "Mr. Coverdale!--Mr. Coverdale!" said he, repeating my name twice, in <\p> 
<p> order to make up for the hesitating and ineffectual way in which he <\p> 
<p> uttered it.  "I ask your pardon, sir, but I hear you are going to <\p> 
<p> Blithedale tomorrow." <\p> 

<p> I knew the pale, elderly face, with the red-tipt nose, and the patch <\p> 
<p> over one eye; and likewise saw something characteristic in the old <\p> 
<p> fellow's way of standing under the arch of a gate, only revealing <\p> 
<p> enough of himself to make me recognize him as an acquaintance.  He was <\p> 
<p> a very shy personage, this Mr. Moodie; and the trait was the more <\p> 
<p> singular, as his mode of getting his bread necessarily brought him into <\p> 
<p> the stir and hubbub of the world more than the generality of men. <\p> 

<p> "Yes, Mr. Moodie," I answered, wondering what interest he could take in <\p> 
<p> the fact, "it is my intention to go to Blithedale to-morrow.  Can I be <\p> 
<p> of any service to you before my departure?" <\p> 

<p> "If you pleased, Mr. Coverdale," said he, "you might do me a very great <\p> 
<p> favor." <\p> 

<p> "A very great one?" repeated I, in a tone that must have expressed but <\p> 
<p> little alacrity of beneficence, although I was ready to do the old man <\p> 
<p> any amount of kindness involving no special trouble to myself. "A very <\p> 
<p> great favor, do you say?  My time is brief, Mr. Moodie, and I have a <\p> 
<p> good many preparations to make.  But be good enough to tell me what you <\p> 
<p> wish." <\p> 

<p> "Ah, sir," replied Old Moodie, "I don't quite like to do that; and, on <\p> 
<p> further thoughts, Mr. Coverdale, perhaps I had better apply to some <\p> 
<p> older gentleman, or to some lady, if you would have the kindness to <\p> 
<p> make me known to one, who may happen to be going to Blithedale. You are <\p> 
<p> a young man, sir!" <\p> 

<p> "Does that fact lessen my availability for your purpose?" asked I. <\p> 
<p> "However, if an older man will suit you better, there is Mr. <\p> 
<p> Hollingsworth, who has three or four years the advantage of me in age, <\p> 
<p> and is a much more solid character, and a philanthropist to boot.  I am <\p> 
<p> only a poet, and, so the critics tell me, no great affair at that! But <\p> 
<p> what can this business be, Mr. Moodie?  It begins to interest me; <\p> 
<p> especially since your hint that a lady's influence might be found <\p> 
<p> desirable.  Come, I am really anxious to be of service to you." <\p> 

<p> But the old fellow, in his civil and demure manner, was both freakish <\p> 
<p> and obstinate; and he had now taken some notion or other into his head <\p> 
<p> that made him hesitate in his former design. <\p> 

<p> "I wonder, sir," said he, "whether you know a lady whom they call <\p> 
<p> Zenobia?" <\p> 

<p> "Not personally," I answered, "although I expect that pleasure <\p> 
<p> to-morrow, as she has got the start of the rest of us, and is already a <\p> 
<p> resident at Blithedale.  But have you a literary turn, Mr. Moodie? or <\p> 
<p> have you taken up the advocacy of women's rights? or what else can have <\p> 
<p> interested you in this lady?  Zenobia, by the bye, as I suppose you <\p> 
<p> know, is merely her public name; a sort of mask in which she comes <\p> 
<p> before the world, retaining all the privileges of privacy,--a <\p> 
<p> contrivance, in short, like the white drapery of the Veiled Lady, only <\p> 
<p> a little more transparent.  But it is late.  Will you tell me what I <\p> 
<p> can do for you?" <\p> 

<p> "Please to excuse me to-night, Mr. Coverdale," said Moodie.  "You are <\p> 
<p> very kind; but I am afraid I have troubled you, when, after all, there <\p> 
<p> may be no need.  Perhaps, with your good leave, I will come to your <\p> 
<p> lodgings to-morrow morning, before you set out for Blithedale. I wish <\p> 
<p> you a good-night, sir, and beg pardon for stopping you." <\p> 

<p> And so he slipt away; and, as he did not show himself the next morning, <\p> 
<p> it was only through subsequent events that I ever arrived at a <\p> 
<p> plausible conjecture as to what his business could have been. Arriving <\p> 
<p> at my room, I threw a lump of cannel coal upon the grate, lighted a <\p> 
<p> cigar, and spent an hour in musings of every hue, from the brightest to <\p> 
<p> the most sombre; being, in truth, not so very confident as at some <\p> 
<p> former periods that this final step, which would mix me up irrevocably <\p> 
<p> with the Blithedale affair, was the wisest that could possibly be <\p> 
<p> taken.  It was nothing short of midnight when I went to bed, after <\p> 
<p> drinking a glass of particularly fine sherry on which I used to pride <\p> 
<p> myself in those days.  It was the very last bottle; and I finished it, <\p> 
<p> with a friend, the next forenoon, before setting out for Blithedale. <\p> 

<p> II. BLITHEDALE <\p> 

<p> There can hardly remain for me (who am really getting to be a frosty <\p> 
<p> bachelor, with another white hair, every week or so, in my mustache), <\p> 
<p> there can hardly flicker up again so cheery a blaze upon the hearth, as <\p> 
<p> that which I remember, the next day, at Blithedale.  It was a wood <\p> 
<p> fire, in the parlor of an old farmhouse, on an April afternoon, but <\p> 
<p> with the fitful gusts of a wintry snowstorm roaring in the chimney. <\p> 
<p> Vividly does that fireside re-create itself, as I rake away the ashes <\p> 
<p> from the embers in my memory, and blow them up with a sigh, for lack of <\p> 
<p> more inspiring breath.  Vividly for an instant, but anon, with the <\p> 
<p> dimmest gleam, and with just as little fervency for my heart as for my <\p> 
<p> finger-ends!  The staunch oaken logs were long ago burnt out. Their <\p> 
<p> genial glow must be represented, if at all, by the merest phosphoric <\p> 
<p> glimmer, like that which exudes, rather than shines, from damp <\p> 
<p> fragments of decayed trees, deluding the benighted wanderer through a <\p> 
<p> forest.  Around such chill mockery of a fire some few of us might sit <\p> 
<p> on the withered leaves, spreading out each a palm towards the imaginary <\p> 
<p> warmth, and talk over our exploded scheme for beginning the life of <\p> 
<p> Paradise anew. <\p> 

<p> Paradise, indeed!  Nobody else in the world, I am bold to <\p> 
<p> affirm--nobody, at least, in our bleak little world of New <\p> 
<p> England,--had dreamed of Paradise that day except as the pole suggests <\p> 
<p> the tropic.  Nor, with such materials as were at hand, could the most <\p> 
<p> skilful architect have constructed any better imitation of Eve's bower <\p> 
<p> than might be seen in the snow hut of an Esquimaux.  But we made a <\p> 
<p> summer of it, in spite of the wild drifts. <\p> 

<p> It was an April day, as already hinted, and well towards the middle of <\p> 
<p> the month.  When morning dawned upon me, in town, its temperature was <\p> 
<p> mild enough to be pronounced even balmy, by a lodger, like myself, in <\p> 
<p> one of the midmost houses of a brick block,--each house partaking of <\p> 
<p> the warmth of all the rest, besides the sultriness of its individual <\p> 
<p> furnace--heat.  But towards noon there had come snow, driven along the <\p> 
<p> street by a northeasterly blast, and whitening the roofs and sidewalks <\p> 
<p> with a business-like perseverance that would have done credit to our <\p> 
<p> severest January tempest.  It set about its task apparently as much in <\p> 
<p> earnest as if it had been guaranteed from a thaw for months to come. <\p> 
<p> The greater, surely, was my heroism, when, puffing out a final whiff of <\p> 
<p> cigar-smoke, I quitted my cosey pair of bachelor-rooms,--with a good <\p> 
<p> fire burning in the grate, and a closet right at hand, where there was <\p> 
<p> still a bottle or two in the champagne basket and a residuum of claret <\p> 
<p> in a box,--quitted, I say, these comfortable quarters, and plunged into <\p> 
<p> the heart of the pitiless snowstorm, in quest of a better life. <\p> 

<p> The better life!  Possibly, it would hardly look so now; it is enough <\p> 
<p> if it looked so then.  The greatest obstacle to being heroic is the <\p> 
<p> doubt whether one may not be going to prove one's self a fool; the <\p> 
<p> truest heroism is to resist the doubt; and the profoundest wisdom to <\p> 
<p> know when it ought to be resisted, and when to be obeyed. <\p> 

<p> Yet, after all, let us acknowledge it wiser, if not more sagacious, to <\p> 
<p> follow out one's daydream to its natural consummation, although, if the <\p> 
<p> vision have been worth the having, it is certain never to be <\p> 
<p> consummated otherwise than by a failure.  And what of that?  Its <\p> 
<p> airiest fragments, impalpable as they may be, will possess a value that <\p> 
<p> lurks not in the most ponderous realities of any practicable scheme. <\p> 
<p> They are not the rubbish of the mind.  Whatever else I may repent of, <\p> 
<p> therefore, let it be reckoned neither among my sins nor follies that I <\p> 
<p> once had faith and force enough to form generous hopes of the world's <\p> 
<p> destiny--yes!--and to do what in me lay for their accomplishment; even <\p> 
<p> to the extent of quitting a warm fireside, flinging away a freshly <\p> 
<p> lighted cigar, and travelling far beyond the strike of city clocks, <\p> 
<p> through a drifting snowstorm. <\p> 

<p> There were four of us who rode together through the storm; and <\p> 
<p> Hollingsworth, who had agreed to be of the number, was accidentally <\p> 
<p> delayed, and set forth at a later hour alone.  As we threaded the <\p> 
<p> streets, I remember how the buildings on either side seemed to press <\p> 
<p> too closely upon us, insomuch that our mighty hearts found barely room <\p> 
<p> enough to throb between them.  The snowfall, too, looked inexpressibly <\p> 
<p> dreary (I had almost called it dingy), coming down through an <\p> 
<p> atmosphere of city smoke, and alighting on the sidewalk only to be <\p> 
<p> moulded into the impress of somebody's patched boot or overshoe.  Thus <\p> 
<p> the track of an old conventionalism was visible on what was freshest <\p> 
<p> from the sky.  But when we left the pavements, and our muffled <\p> 
<p> hoof-tramps beat upon a desolate extent of country road, and were <\p> 
<p> effaced by the unfettered blast as soon as stamped, then there was <\p> 
<p> better air to breathe.  Air that had not been breathed once and again! <\p> 
<p> air that had not been spoken into words of falsehood, formality, and <\p> 
<p> error, like all the air of the dusky city! <\p> 

<p> "How pleasant it is!" remarked I, while the snowflakes flew into my <\p> 
<p> mouth the moment it was opened.  "How very mild and balmy is this <\p> 
<p> country air!" <\p> 

<p> "Ah, Coverdale, don't laugh at what little enthusiasm you have left!" <\p> 
<p> said one of my companions.  "I maintain that this nitrous atmosphere is <\p> 
<p> really exhilarating; and, at any rate, we can never call ourselves <\p> 
<p> regenerated men till a February northeaster shall be as grateful to us <\p> 
<p> as the softest breeze of June!" <\p> 

<p> So we all of us took courage, riding fleetly and merrily along, by <\p> 
<p> stone fences that were half buried in the wave-like drifts; and through <\p> 
<p> patches of woodland, where the tree-trunks opposed a snow-incrusted <\p> 
<p> side towards the northeast; and within ken of deserted villas, with no <\p> 
<p> footprints in their avenues; and passed scattered dwellings, whence <\p> 
<p> puffed the smoke of country fires, strongly impregnated with the <\p> 
<p> pungent aroma of burning peat.  Sometimes, encountering a traveller, we <\p> 
<p> shouted a friendly greeting; and he, unmuffling his ears to the bluster <\p> 
<p> and the snow-spray, and listening eagerly, appeared to think our <\p> 
<p> courtesy worth less than the trouble which it cost him.  The churl!  He <\p> 
<p> understood the shrill whistle of the blast, but had no intelligence for <\p> 
<p> our blithe tones of brotherhood.  This lack of faith in our cordial <\p> 
<p> sympathy, on the traveller's part, was one among the innumerable tokens <\p> 
<p> how difficult a task we had in hand for the reformation of the world. <\p> 
<p> We rode on, however, with still unflagging spirits, and made such good <\p> 
<p> companionship with the tempest that, at our journey's end, we professed <\p> 
<p> ourselves almost loath to bid the rude blusterer good-by. But, to own <\p> 
<p> the truth, I was little better than an icicle, and began to be <\p> 
<p> suspicious that I had caught a fearful cold. <\p> 

<p> And now we were seated by the brisk fireside of the old farmhouse, the <\p> 
<p> same fire that glimmers so faintly among my reminiscences at the <\p> 
<p> beginning of this chapter.  There we sat, with the snow melting out of <\p> 
<p> our hair and beards, and our faces all ablaze, what with the past <\p> 
<p> inclemency and present warmth.  It was, indeed, a right good fire that <\p> 
<p> we found awaiting us, built up of great, rough logs, and knotty limbs, <\p> 
<p> and splintered fragments of an oak-tree, such as farmers are wont to <\p> 
<p> keep for their own hearths, since these crooked and unmanageable boughs <\p> 
<p> could never be measured into merchantable cords for the market.  A <\p> 
<p> family of the old Pilgrims might have swung their kettle over precisely <\p> 
<p> such a fire as this, only, no doubt, a bigger one; and, contrasting it <\p> 
<p> with my coal-grate, I felt so much the more that we had transported <\p> 
<p> ourselves a world-wide distance from the system of society that <\p> 
<p> shackled us at breakfast-time. <\p> 

<p> Good, comfortable Mrs. Foster (the wife of stout Silas Foster, who was <\p> 
<p> to manage the farm at a fair stipend, and be our tutor in the art of <\p> 
<p> husbandry) bade us a hearty welcome.  At her back--a back of generous <\p> 
<p> breadth--appeared two young women, smiling most hospitably, but looking <\p> 
<p> rather awkward withal, as not well knowing what was to be their <\p> 
<p> position in our new arrangement of the world.  We shook hands <\p> 
<p> affectionately all round, and congratulated ourselves that the blessed <\p> 
<p> state of brotherhood and sisterhood, at which we aimed, might fairly be <\p> 
<p> dated from this moment.  Our greetings were hardly concluded when the <\p> 
<p> door opened, and Zenobia--whom I had never before seen, important as <\p> 
<p> was her place in our enterprise--Zenobia entered the parlor. <\p> 

<p> This (as the reader, if at all acquainted with our literary biography, <\p> 
<p> need scarcely be told) was not her real name.  She had assumed it, in <\p> 
<p> the first instance, as her magazine signature; and, as it accorded well <\p> 
<p> with something imperial which her friends attributed to this lady's <\p> 
<p> figure and deportment, they half-laughingly adopted it in their <\p> 
<p> familiar intercourse with her.  She took the appellation in good part, <\p> 
<p> and even encouraged its constant use; which, in fact, was thus far <\p> 
<p> appropriate, that our Zenobia, however humble looked her new <\p> 
<p> philosophy, had as much native pride as any queen would have known what <\p> 
<p> to do with. <\p> 

<p> III. A KNOT OF DREAMERS <\p> 

<p> Zenobia bade us welcome, in a fine, frank, mellow voice, and gave each <\p> 
<p> of us her hand, which was very soft and warm.  She had something <\p> 
<p> appropriate, I recollect, to say to every individual; and what she said <\p> 
<p> to myself was this:--"I have long wished to know you, Mr. Coverdale, <\p> 
<p> and to thank you for your beautiful poetry, some of which I have <\p> 
<p> learned by heart; or rather it has stolen into my memory, without my <\p> 
<p> exercising any choice or volition about the matter.  Of course--permit <\p> 
<p> me to say you do not think of relinquishing an occupation in which you <\p> 
<p> have done yourself so much credit.  I would almost rather give you up <\p> 
<p> as an associate, than that the world should lose one of its true poets!" <\p> 

<p> "Ah, no; there will not be the slightest danger of that, especially <\p> 
<p> after this inestimable praise from Zenobia," said I, smiling, and <\p> 
<p> blushing, no doubt, with excess of pleasure.  "I hope, on the contrary, <\p> 
<p> now to produce something that shall really deserve to be called <\p> 
<p> poetry,--true, strong, natural, and sweet, as is the life which we are <\p> 
<p> going to lead,--something that shall have the notes of wild birds <\p> 
<p> twittering through it, or a strain like the wind anthems in the woods, <\p> 
<p> as the case may be." <\p> 

<p> "Is it irksome to you to hear your own verses sung?" asked Zenobia, <\p> 
<p> with a gracious smile.  "If so, I am very sorry, for you will certainly <\p> 
<p> hear me singing them sometimes, in the summer evenings." <\p> 

<p> "Of all things," answered I, "that is what will delight me most." <\p> 

<p> While this passed, and while she spoke to my companions, I was taking <\p> 
<p> note of Zenobia's aspect; and it impressed itself on me so distinctly, <\p> 
<p> that I can now summon her up, like a ghost, a little wanner than the <\p> 
<p> life but otherwise identical with it.  She was dressed as simply as <\p> 
<p> possible, in an American print (I think the dry-goods people call it <\p> 
<p> so), but with a silken kerchief, between which and her gown there was <\p> 
<p> one glimpse of a white shoulder.  It struck me as a great piece of good <\p> 
<p> fortune that there should be just that glimpse.  Her hair, which was <\p> 
<p> dark, glossy, and of singular abundance, was put up rather soberly and <\p> 
<p> primly--without curls, or other ornament, except a single flower.  It <\p> 
<p> was an exotic of rare beauty, and as fresh as if the hothouse gardener <\p> 
<p> had just clipt it from the stem.  That flower has struck deep root into <\p> 
<p> my memory.  I can both see it and smell it, at this moment.  So <\p> 
<p> brilliant, so rare, so costly as it must have been, and yet enduring <\p> 
<p> only for a day, it was more indicative of the pride and pomp which had <\p> 
<p> a luxuriant growth in Zenobia's character than if a great diamond had <\p> 
<p> sparkled among her hair. <\p> 

<p> Her hand, though very soft, was larger than most women would like to <\p> 
<p> have, or than they could afford to have, though not a whit too large in <\p> 
<p> proportion with the spacious plan of Zenobia's entire development. It <\p> 
<p> did one good to see a fine intellect (as hers really was, although its <\p> 
<p> natural tendency lay in another direction than towards literature) so <\p> 
<p> fitly cased.  She was, indeed, an admirable figure of a woman, just on <\p> 
<p> the hither verge of her richest maturity, with a combination of <\p> 
<p> features which it is safe to call remarkably beautiful, even if some <\p> 
<p> fastidious persons might pronounce them a little deficient in softness <\p> 
<p> and delicacy.  But we find enough of those attributes everywhere. <\p> 
<p> Preferable--by way of variety, at least--was Zenobia's bloom, health, <\p> 
<p> and vigor, which she possessed in such overflow that a man might well <\p> 
<p> have fallen in love with her for their sake only.  In her quiet moods, <\p> 
<p> she seemed rather indolent; but when really in earnest, particularly if <\p> 
<p> there were a spice of bitter feeling, she grew all alive to her <\p> 
<p> finger-tips. <\p> 

<p> "I am the first comer," Zenobia went on to say, while her smile beamed <\p> 
<p> warmth upon us all; "so I take the part of hostess for to-day, and <\p> 
<p> welcome you as if to my own fireside.  You shall be my guests, too, at <\p> 
<p> supper.  Tomorrow, if you please, we will be brethren and sisters, and <\p> 
<p> begin our new life from daybreak." <\p> 

<p> "Have we our various parts assigned?" asked some one. <\p> 

<p> "Oh, we of the softer sex," responded Zenobia, with her mellow, almost <\p> 
<p> broad laugh,--most delectable to hear, but not in the least like an <\p> 
<p> ordinary woman's laugh,--"we women (there are four of us here already) <\p> 
<p> will take the domestic and indoor part of the business, as a matter of <\p> 
<p> course.  To bake, to boil, to roast, to fry, to stew,--to wash, and <\p> 
<p> iron, and scrub, and sweep,--and, at our idler intervals, to repose <\p> 
<p> ourselves on knitting and sewing,--these, I suppose, must be feminine <\p> 
<p> occupations, for the present.  By and by, perhaps, when our individual <\p> 
<p> adaptations begin to develop themselves, it may be that some of us who <\p> 
<p> wear the petticoat will go afield, and leave the weaker brethren to <\p> 
<p> take our places in the kitchen." <\p> 

<p> "What a pity," I remarked, "that the kitchen, and the housework <\p> 
<p> generally, cannot be left out of our system altogether!  It is odd <\p> 
<p> enough that the kind of labor which falls to the lot of women is just <\p> 
<p> that which chiefly distinguishes artificial life--the life of <\p> 
<p> degenerated mortals--from the life of Paradise.  Eve had no dinner-pot, <\p> 
<p> and no clothes to mend, and no washing-day." <\p> 

<p> "I am afraid," said Zenobia, with mirth gleaming out of her eyes, "we <\p> 
<p> shall find some difficulty in adopting the paradisiacal system for at <\p> 
<p> least a month to come.  Look at that snowdrift sweeping past the <\p> 
<p> window!  Are there any figs ripe, do you think?  Have the pineapples <\p> 
<p> been gathered to-day?  Would you like a bread-fruit, or a cocoanut? <\p> 
<p> Shall I run out and pluck you some roses?  No, no, Mr. Coverdale; the <\p> 
<p> only flower hereabouts is the one in my hair, which I got out of a <\p> 
<p> greenhouse this morning.  As for the garb of Eden," added she, <\p> 
<p> shivering playfully, "I shall not assume it till after May-day!" <\p> 

<p> Assuredly Zenobia could not have intended it,--the fault must have been <\p> 
<p> entirely in my imagination.  But these last words, together with <\p> 
<p> something in her manner, irresistibly brought up a picture of that <\p> 
<p> fine, perfectly developed figure, in Eve's earliest garment.  Her free, <\p> 
<p> careless, generous modes of expression often had this effect of <\p> 
<p> creating images which, though pure, are hardly felt to be quite <\p> 
<p> decorous when born of a thought that passes between man and woman.  I <\p> 
<p> imputed it, at that time, to Zenobia's noble courage, conscious of no <\p> 
<p> harm, and scorning the petty restraints which take the life and color <\p> 
<p> out of other women's conversation.  There was another peculiarity about <\p> 
<p> her.  We seldom meet with women nowadays, and in this country, who <\p> 
<p> impress us as being women at all,--their sex fades away and goes for <\p> 
<p> nothing, in ordinary intercourse.  Not so with Zenobia.  One felt an <\p> 
<p> influence breathing out of her such as we might suppose to come from <\p> 
<p> Eve, when she was just made, and her Creator brought her to Adam, <\p> 
<p> saying, "Behold! here is a woman!"  Not that I would convey the idea of <\p> 
<p> especial gentleness, grace, modesty, and shyness, but of a certain warm <\p> 
<p> and rich characteristic, which seems, for the most part, to have been <\p> 
<p> refined away out of the feminine system. <\p> 

<p> "And now," continued Zenobia, "I must go and help get supper.  Do you <\p> 
<p> think you can be content, instead of figs, pineapples, and all the <\p> 
<p> other delicacies of Adam's supper-table, with tea and toast, and a <\p> 
<p> certain modest supply of ham and tongue, which, with the instinct of a <\p> 
<p> housewife, I brought hither in a basket?  And there shall be bread and <\p> 
<p> milk, too, if the innocence of your taste demands it." <\p> 

<p> The whole sisterhood now went about their domestic avocations, utterly <\p> 
<p> declining our offers to assist, further than by bringing wood for the <\p> 
<p> kitchen fire from a huge pile in the back yard.  After heaping up more <\p> 
<p> than a sufficient quantity, we returned to the sitting-room, drew our <\p> 
<p> chairs close to the hearth, and began to talk over our prospects. <\p> 
<p> Soon, with a tremendous stamping in the entry, appeared Silas Foster, <\p> 
<p> lank, stalwart, uncouth, and grizzly-bearded. He came from foddering <\p> 
<p> the cattle in the barn, and from the field, where he had been <\p> 
<p> ploughing, until the depth of the snow rendered it impossible to draw a <\p> 
<p> furrow.  He greeted us in pretty much the same tone as if he were <\p> 
<p> speaking to his oxen, took a quid from his iron tobacco-box, pulled off <\p> 
<p> his wet cowhide boots, and sat down before the fire in his <\p> 
<p> stocking-feet.  The steam arose from his soaked garments, so that the <\p> 
<p> stout yeoman looked vaporous and spectre-like. <\p> 

<p> "Well, folks," remarked Silas, "you'll be wishing yourselves back to <\p> 
<p> town again, if this weather holds." <\p> 

<p> And, true enough, there was a look of gloom, as the twilight fell <\p> 
<p> silently and sadly out of the sky, its gray or sable flakes <\p> 
<p> intermingling themselves with the fast-descending snow.  The storm, in <\p> 
<p> its evening aspect, was decidedly dreary.  It seemed to have arisen for <\p> 
<p> our especial behoof,--a symbol of the cold, desolate, distrustful <\p> 
<p> phantoms that invariably haunt the mind, on the eve of adventurous <\p> 
<p> enterprises, to warn us back within the boundaries of ordinary life. <\p> 

<p> But our courage did not quail.  We would not allow ourselves to be <\p> 
<p> depressed by the snowdrift trailing past the window, any more than if <\p> 
<p> it had been the sigh of a summer wind among rustling boughs.  There <\p> 
<p> have been few brighter seasons for us than that.  If ever men might <\p> 
<p> lawfully dream awake, and give utterance to their wildest visions <\p> 
<p> without dread of laughter or scorn on the part of the audience,--yes, <\p> 
<p> and speak of earthly happiness, for themselves and mankind, as an <\p> 
<p> object to be hopefully striven for, and probably attained, we who made <\p> 
<p> that little semicircle round the blazing fire were those very men.  We <\p> 
<p> had left the rusty iron framework of society behind us; we had broken <\p> 
<p> through many hindrances that are powerful enough to keep most people on <\p> 
<p> the weary treadmill of the established system, even while they feel its <\p> 
<p> irksomeness almost as intolerable as we did.  We had stepped down from <\p> 
<p> the pulpit; we had flung aside the pen; we had shut up the ledger; we <\p> 
<p> had thrown off that sweet, bewitching, enervating indolence, which is <\p> 
<p> better, after all, than most of the enjoyments within mortal grasp.  It <\p> 
<p> was our purpose--a generous one, certainly, and absurd, no doubt, in <\p> 
<p> full proportion with its generosity--to give up whatever we had <\p> 
<p> heretofore attained, for the sake of showing mankind the example of a <\p> 
<p> life governed by other than the false and cruel principles on which <\p> 
<p> human society has all along been based. <\p> 

<p> And, first of all, we had divorced ourselves from pride, and were <\p> 
<p> striving to supply its place with familiar love.  We meant to lessen <\p> 
<p> the laboring man's great burden of toil, by performing our due share of <\p> 
<p> it at the cost of our own thews and sinews.  We sought our profit by <\p> 
<p> mutual aid, instead of wresting it by the strong hand from an enemy, or <\p> 
<p> filching it craftily from those less shrewd than ourselves (if, indeed, <\p> 
<p> there were any such in New England), or winning it by selfish <\p> 
<p> competition with a neighbor; in one or another of which fashions every <\p> 
<p> son of woman both perpetrates and suffers his share of the common evil, <\p> 
<p> whether he chooses it or no.  And, as the basis of our institution, we <\p> 
<p> purposed to offer up the earnest toil of our bodies, as a prayer no <\p> 
<p> less than an effort for the advancement of our race. <\p> 

<p> Therefore, if we built splendid castles (phalansteries perhaps they <\p> 
<p> might be more fitly called), and pictured beautiful scenes, among the <\p> 
<p> fervid coals of the hearth around which we were clustering, and if all <\p> 
<p> went to rack with the crumbling embers and have never since arisen out <\p> 
<p> of the ashes, let us take to ourselves no shame.  In my own behalf, I <\p> 
<p> rejoice that I could once think better of the world's improvability <\p> 
<p> than it deserved.  It is a mistake into which men seldom fall twice in <\p> 
<p> a lifetime; or, if so, the rarer and higher is the nature that can thus <\p> 
<p> magnanimously persist in error. <\p> 

<p> Stout Silas Foster mingled little in our conversation; but when he did <\p> 
<p> speak, it was very much to some practical purpose.  For <\p> 
<p> instance:--"Which man among you," quoth he, "is the best judge of <\p> 
<p> swine?  Some of us must go to the next Brighton fair, and buy half a <\p> 
<p> dozen pigs." <\p> 

<p> Pigs!  Good heavens! had we come out from among the swinish multitude <\p> 
<p> for this?  And again, in reference to some discussion about raising <\p> 
<p> early vegetables for the market:--"We shall never make any hand at <\p> 
<p> market gardening," said Silas Foster, "unless the women folks will <\p> 
<p> undertake to do all the weeding.  We haven't team enough for that and <\p> 
<p> the regular farm-work, reckoning three of your city folks as worth one <\p> 
<p> common field-hand.  No, no; I tell you, we should have to get up a <\p> 
<p> little too early in the morning, to compete with the market gardeners <\p> 
<p> round Boston." <\p> 

<p> It struck me as rather odd, that one of the first questions raised, <\p> 
<p> after our separation from the greedy, struggling, self-seeking world, <\p> 
<p> should relate to the possibility of getting the advantage over the <\p> 
<p> outside barbarians in their own field of labor.  But, to own the truth, <\p> 
<p> I very soon became sensible that, as regarded society at large, we <\p> 
<p> stood in a position of new hostility, rather than new brotherhood. Nor <\p> 
<p> could this fail to be the case, in some degree, until the bigger and <\p> 
<p> better half of society should range itself on our side. Constituting so <\p> 
<p> pitiful a minority as now, we were inevitably estranged from the rest <\p> 
<p> of mankind in pretty fair proportion with the strictness of our mutual <\p> 
<p> bond among ourselves. <\p> 

<p> This dawning idea, however, was driven back into my inner consciousness <\p> 
<p> by the entrance of Zenobia.  She came with the welcome intelligence <\p> 
<p> that supper was on the table.  Looking at herself in the glass, and <\p> 
<p> perceiving that her one magnificent flower had grown rather languid <\p> 
<p> (probably by being exposed to the fervency of the kitchen fire), she <\p> 
<p> flung it on the floor, as unconcernedly as a village girl would throw <\p> 
<p> away a faded violet.  The action seemed proper to her character, <\p> 
<p> although, methought, it would still more have befitted the bounteous <\p> 
<p> nature of this beautiful woman to scatter fresh flowers from her hand, <\p> 
<p> and to revive faded ones by her touch. Nevertheless, it was a singular <\p> 
<p> but irresistible effect; the presence of Zenobia caused our heroic <\p> 
<p> enterprise to show like an illusion, a masquerade, a pastoral, a <\p> 
<p> counterfeit Arcadia, in which we grown-up men and women were making a <\p> 
<p> play-day of the years that were given us to live in.  I tried to <\p> 
<p> analyze this impression, but not with much success. <\p> 

<p> "It really vexes me," observed Zenobia, as we left the room, "that Mr. <\p> 
<p> Hollingsworth should be such a laggard.  I should not have thought him <\p> 
<p> at all the sort of person to be turned back by a puff of contrary wind, <\p> 
<p> or a few snowflakes drifting into his face." <\p> 

<p> "Do you know Hollingsworth personally?"  I inquired. <\p> 

<p> "No; only as an auditor--auditress, I mean--of some of his lectures," <\p> 
<p> said she.  "What a voice he has! and what a man he is!  Yet not so much <\p> 
<p> an intellectual man, I should say, as a great heart; at least, he moved <\p> 
<p> me more deeply than I think myself capable of being moved, except by <\p> 
<p> the stroke of a true, strong heart against my own.  It is a sad pity <\p> 
<p> that he should have devoted his glorious powers to such a grimy, <\p> 
<p> unbeautiful, and positively hopeless object as this reformation of <\p> 
<p> criminals, about which he makes himself and his wretchedly small <\p> 
<p> audiences so very miserable.  To tell you a secret, I never could <\p> 
<p> tolerate a philanthropist before.  Could you?" <\p> 

<p> "By no means," I answered; "neither can I now." <\p> 

<p> "They are, indeed, an odiously disagreeable set of mortals," continued <\p> 
<p> Zenobia.  "I should like Mr. Hollingsworth a great deal better if the <\p> 
<p> philanthropy had been left out.  At all events, as a mere matter of <\p> 
<p> taste, I wish he would let the bad people alone, and try to benefit <\p> 
<p> those who are not already past his help.  Do you suppose he will be <\p> 
<p> content to spend his life, or even a few months of it, among tolerably <\p> 
<p> virtuous and comfortable individuals like ourselves?" <\p> 

<p> "Upon my word, I doubt it," said I. "If we wish to keep him with us, we <\p> 
<p> must systematically commit at least one crime apiece!  Mere peccadillos <\p> 
<p> will not satisfy him." <\p> 

<p> Zenobia turned, sidelong, a strange kind of a glance upon me; but, <\p> 
<p> before I could make out what it meant, we had entered the kitchen, <\p> 
<p> where, in accordance with the rustic simplicity of our new life, the <\p> 
<p> supper-table was spread. <\p> 

<p> IV. THE SUPPER-TABLE <\p> 

<p> The pleasant firelight!  I must still keep harping on it.  The kitchen <\p> 
<p> hearth had an old-fashioned breadth, depth, and spaciousness, far <\p> 
<p> within which lay what seemed the butt of a good-sized oak-tree, with <\p> 
<p> the moisture bubbling merrily out at both ends.  It was now half an <\p> 
<p> hour beyond dusk.  The blaze from an armful of substantial sticks, <\p> 
<p> rendered more combustible by brushwood and pine, flickered powerfully <\p> 
<p> on the smoke-blackened walls, and so cheered our spirits that we cared <\p> 
<p> not what inclemency might rage and roar on the other side of our <\p> 
<p> illuminated windows.  A yet sultrier warmth was bestowed by a goodly <\p> 
<p> quantity of peat, which was crumbling to white ashes among the burning <\p> 
<p> brands, and incensed the kitchen with its not ungrateful fragrance. <\p> 
<p> The exuberance of this household fire would alone have sufficed to <\p> 
<p> bespeak us no true farmers; for the New England yeoman, if he have the <\p> 
<p> misfortune to dwell within practicable distance of a wood-market, is as <\p> 
<p> niggardly of each stick as if it were a bar of California gold. <\p> 

<p> But it was fortunate for us, on that wintry eve of our untried life, to <\p> 
<p> enjoy the warm and radiant luxury of a somewhat too abundant fire. If <\p> 
<p> it served no other purpose, it made the men look so full of youth, warm <\p> 
<p> blood, and hope, and the women--such of them, at least, as were anywise <\p> 
<p> convertible by its magic--so very beautiful, that I would cheerfully <\p> 
<p> have spent my last dollar to prolong the blaze.  As for Zenobia, there <\p> 
<p> was a glow in her cheeks that made me think of Pandora, fresh from <\p> 
<p> Vulcan's workshop, and full of the celestial warmth by dint of which he <\p> 
<p> had tempered and moulded her. <\p> 

<p> "Take your places, my dear friends all," cried she; "seat yourselves <\p> 
<p> without ceremony, and you shall be made happy with such tea as not many <\p> 
<p> of the world's working-people, except yourselves, will find in their <\p> 
<p> cups to-night.  After this one supper, you may drink buttermilk, if you <\p> 
<p> please.  To-night we will quaff this nectar, which, I assure you, could <\p> 
<p> not be bought with gold." <\p> 

<p> We all sat down,--grizzly Silas Foster, his rotund helpmate, and the <\p> 
<p> two bouncing handmaidens, included,--and looked at one another in a <\p> 
<p> friendly but rather awkward way.  It was the first practical trial of <\p> 
<p> our theories of equal brotherhood and sisterhood; and we people of <\p> 
<p> superior cultivation and refinement (for as such, I presume, we <\p> 
<p> unhesitatingly reckoned ourselves) felt as if something were already <\p> 
<p> accomplished towards the millennium of love.  The truth is, however, <\p> 
<p> that the laboring oar was with our unpolished companions; it being far <\p> 
<p> easier to condescend than to accept of condescension.  Neither did I <\p> 
<p> refrain from questioning, in secret, whether some of us--and Zenobia <\p> 
<p> among the rest--would so quietly have taken our places among these good <\p> 
<p> people, save for the cherished consciousness that it was not by <\p> 
<p> necessity but choice.  Though we saw fit to drink our tea out of <\p> 
<p> earthen cups to-night, and in earthen company, it was at our own option <\p> 
<p> to use pictured porcelain and handle silver forks again to-morrow. <\p> 
<p> This same salvo, as to the power of regaining our former position, <\p> 
<p> contributed much, I fear, to the equanimity with which we subsequently <\p> 
<p> bore many of the hardships and humiliations of a life of toil.  If ever <\p> 
<p> I have deserved (which has not often been the case, and, I think, <\p> 
<p> never), but if ever I did deserve to be soundly cuffed by a fellow <\p> 
<p> mortal, for secretly putting weight upon some imaginary social <\p> 
<p> advantage, it must have been while I was striving to prove myself <\p> 
<p> ostentatiously his equal and no more.  It was while I sat beside him on <\p> 
<p> his cobbler's bench, or clinked my hoe against his own in the <\p> 
<p> cornfield, or broke the same crust of bread, my earth-grimed hand to <\p> 
<p> his, at our noontide lunch.  The poor, proud man should look at both <\p> 
<p> sides of sympathy like this. <\p> 

<p> The silence which followed upon our sitting down to table grew rather <\p> 
<p> oppressive; indeed, it was hardly broken by a word, during the first <\p> 
<p> round of Zenobia's fragrant tea. <\p> 

<p> "I hope," said I, at last, "that our blazing windows will be visible a <\p> 
<p> great way off.  There is nothing so pleasant and encouraging to a <\p> 
<p> solitary traveller, on a stormy night, as a flood of firelight seen <\p> 
<p> amid the gloom.  These ruddy window panes cannot fail to cheer the <\p> 
<p> hearts of all that look at them.  Are they not warm with the <\p> 
<p> beacon-fire which we have kindled for humanity?" <\p> 

<p> "The blaze of that brushwood will only last a minute or two longer," <\p> 
<p> observed Silas Foster; but whether he meant to insinuate that our moral <\p> 
<p> illumination would have as brief a term, I cannot say. <\p> 

<p> "Meantime," said Zenobia, "it may serve to guide some wayfarer to a <\p> 
<p> shelter." <\p> 

<p> And, just as she said this, there came a knock at the house door. <\p> 

<p> "There is one of the world's wayfarers," said I. "Ay, ay, just so!" <\p> 
<p> quoth Silas Foster.  "Our firelight will draw stragglers, just as a <\p> 
<p> candle draws dorbugs on a summer night." <\p> 

<p> Whether to enjoy a dramatic suspense, or that we were selfishly <\p> 
<p> contrasting our own comfort with the chill and dreary situation of the <\p> 
<p> unknown person at the threshold, or that some of us city folk felt a <\p> 
<p> little startled at the knock which came so unseasonably, through night <\p> 
<p> and storm, to the door of the lonely farmhouse,--so it happened that <\p> 
<p> nobody, for an instant or two, arose to answer the summons.  Pretty <\p> 
<p> soon there came another knock.  The first had been moderately loud; the <\p> 
<p> second was smitten so forcibly that the knuckles of the applicant must <\p> 
<p> have left their mark in the door panel. <\p> 

<p> "He knocks as if he had a right to come in," said Zenobia, laughing. <\p> 
<p> "And what are we thinking of?--It must be Mr. Hollingsworth!" <\p> 

<p> Hereupon I went to the door, unbolted, and flung it wide open.  There, <\p> 
<p> sure enough, stood Hollingsworth, his shaggy greatcoat all covered with <\p> 
<p> snow, so that he looked quite as much like a polar bear as a modern <\p> 
<p> philanthropist. <\p> 

<p> "Sluggish hospitality this!" said he, in those deep tones of his, which <\p> 
<p> seemed to come out of a chest as capacious as a barrel.  "It would have <\p> 
<p> served you right if I had lain down and spent the night on the <\p> 
<p> doorstep, just for the sake of putting you to shame.  But here is a <\p> 
<p> guest who will need a warmer and softer bed." <\p> 

<p> And, stepping back to the wagon in which he had journeyed hither, <\p> 
<p> Hollingsworth received into his arms and deposited on the doorstep a <\p> 
<p> figure enveloped in a cloak.  It was evidently a woman; or, <\p> 
<p> rather,--judging from the ease with which he lifted her, and the little <\p> 
<p> space which she seemed to fill in his arms, a slim and unsubstantial <\p> 
<p> girl.  As she showed some hesitation about entering the door, <\p> 
<p> Hollingsworth, with his usual directness and lack of ceremony, urged <\p> 
<p> her forward not merely within the entry, but into the warm and strongly <\p> 
<p> lighted kitchen. <\p> 

<p> "Who is this?" whispered I, remaining behind with him, while he was <\p> 
<p> taking off his greatcoat. <\p> 

<p> "Who?  Really, I don't know," answered Hollingsworth, looking at me <\p> 
<p> with some surprise.  "It is a young person who belongs here, however; <\p> 
<p> and no doubt she had been expected.  Zenobia, or some of the women <\p> 
<p> folks, can tell you all about it." <\p> 

<p> "I think not," said I, glancing towards the new-comer and the other <\p> 
<p> occupants of the kitchen.  "Nobody seems to welcome her.  I should <\p> 
<p> hardly judge that she was an expected guest." <\p> 

<p> "Well, well," said Hollingsworth quietly, "We'll make it right." <\p> 

<p> The stranger, or whatever she were, remained standing precisely on that <\p> 
<p> spot of the kitchen floor to which Hollingsworth's kindly hand had <\p> 
<p> impelled her.  The cloak falling partly off, she was seen to be a very <\p> 
<p> young woman dressed in a poor but decent gown, made high in the neck, <\p> 
<p> and without any regard to fashion or smartness.  Her brown hair fell <\p> 
<p> down from beneath a hood, not in curls but with only a slight wave; her <\p> 
<p> face was of a wan, almost sickly hue, betokening habitual seclusion <\p> 
<p> from the sun and free atmosphere, like a flower-shrub that had done its <\p> 
<p> best to blossom in too scanty light.  To complete the pitiableness of <\p> 
<p> her aspect, she shivered either with cold, or fear, or nervous <\p> 
<p> excitement, so that you might have beheld her shadow vibrating on the <\p> 
<p> fire-lighted wall.  In short, there has seldom been seen so depressed <\p> 
<p> and sad a figure as this young girl's; and it was hardly possible to <\p> 
<p> help being angry with her, from mere despair of doing anything for her <\p> 
<p> comfort.  The fantasy occurred to me that she was some desolate kind of <\p> 
<p> a creature, doomed to wander about in snowstorms; and that, though the <\p> 
<p> ruddiness of our window panes had tempted her into a human dwelling, <\p> 
<p> she would not remain long enough to melt the icicles out of her hair. <\p> 
<p> Another conjecture likewise came into my mind.  Recollecting <\p> 
<p> Hollingsworth's sphere of philanthropic action, I deemed it possible <\p> 
<p> that he might have brought one of his guilty patients, to be wrought <\p> 
<p> upon and restored to spiritual health by the pure influences which our <\p> 
<p> mode of life would create. <\p> 

<p> As yet the girl had not stirred.  She stood near the door, fixing a <\p> 
<p> pair of large, brown, melancholy eyes upon Zenobia--only upon <\p> 
<p> Zenobia!--she evidently saw nothing else in the room save that bright, <\p> 
<p> fair, rosy, beautiful woman.  It was the strangest look I ever <\p> 
<p> witnessed; long a mystery to me, and forever a memory.  Once she seemed <\p> 
<p> about to move forward and greet her,--I know not with what warmth or <\p> 
<p> with what words,--but, finally, instead of doing so, she dropped down <\p> 
<p> upon her knees, clasped her hands, and gazed piteously into Zenobia's <\p> 
<p> face. Meeting no kindly reception, her head fell on her bosom. <\p> 

<p> I never thoroughly forgave Zenobia for her conduct on this occasion. <\p> 
<p> But women are always more cautious in their casual hospitalities than <\p> 
<p> men. <\p> 

<p> "What does the girl mean?" cried she in rather a sharp tone.  "Is she <\p> 
<p> crazy?  Has she no tongue?" <\p> 

<p> And here Hollingsworth stepped forward. <\p> 

<p> "No wonder if the poor child's tongue is frozen in her mouth," said he; <\p> 
<p> and I think he positively frowned at Zenobia.  "The very heart will be <\p> 
<p> frozen in her bosom, unless you women can warm it, among you, with the <\p> 
<p> warmth that ought to be in your own!" <\p> 

<p> Hollingsworth's appearance was very striking at this moment.  He was <\p> 
<p> then about thirty years old, but looked several years older, with his <\p> 
<p> great shaggy head, his heavy brow, his dark complexion, his abundant <\p> 
<p> beard, and the rude strength with which his features seemed to have <\p> 
<p> been hammered out of iron, rather than chiselled or moulded from any <\p> 
<p> finer or softer material.  His figure was not tall, but massive and <\p> 
<p> brawny, and well befitting his original occupation; which as the reader <\p> 
<p> probably knows--was that of a blacksmith.  As for external polish, or <\p> 
<p> mere courtesy of manner, he never possessed more than a tolerably <\p> 
<p> educated bear; although, in his gentler moods, there was a tenderness <\p> 
<p> in his voice, eyes, mouth, in his gesture, and in every indescribable <\p> 
<p> manifestation, which few men could resist and no woman. But he now <\p> 
<p> looked stern and reproachful; and it was with that inauspicious meaning <\p> 
<p> in his glance that Hollingsworth first met Zenobia's eyes, and began <\p> 
<p> his influence upon her life. <\p> 

<p> To my surprise, Zenobia--of whose haughty spirit I had been told so <\p> 
<p> many examples--absolutely changed color, and seemed mortified and <\p> 
<p> confused. <\p> 

<p> "You do not quite do me justice, Mr. Hollingsworth," said she almost <\p> 
<p> humbly.  "I am willing to be kind to the poor girl.  Is she a protegee <\p> 
<p> of yours?  What can I do for her?" <\p> 

<p> "Have you anything to ask of this lady?" said Hollingsworth kindly to <\p> 
<p> the girl.  "I remember you mentioned her name before we left town." <\p> 

<p> "Only that she will shelter me," replied the girl tremulously.  "Only <\p> 
<p> that she will let me be always near her." <\p> 

<p> "Well, indeed," exclaimed Zenobia, recovering herself and laughing, <\p> 
<p> "this is an adventure, and well-worthy to be the first incident in our <\p> 
<p> life of love and free-heartedness!  But I accept it, for the present, <\p> 
<p> without further question, only," added she, "it would be a convenience <\p> 
<p> if we knew your name." <\p> 

<p> "Priscilla," said the girl; and it appeared to me that she hesitated <\p> 
<p> whether to add anything more, and decided in the negative.  "Pray do <\p> 
<p> not ask me my other name,--at least not yet,--if you will be so kind to <\p> 
<p> a forlorn creature." <\p> 

<p> Priscilla!--Priscilla!  I repeated the name to myself three or four <\p> 
<p> times; and in that little space, this quaint and prim cognomen had so <\p> 
<p> amalgamated itself with my idea of the girl, that it seemed as if no <\p> 
<p> other name could have adhered to her for a moment.  Heretofore the poor <\p> 
<p> thing had not shed any tears; but now that she found herself received, <\p> 
<p> and at least temporarily established, the big drops began to ooze out <\p> 
<p> from beneath her eyelids as if she were full of them. Perhaps it showed <\p> 
<p> the iron substance of my heart, that I could not help smiling at this <\p> 
<p> odd scene of unknown and unaccountable calamity, into which our <\p> 
<p> cheerful party had been entrapped without the liberty of choosing <\p> 
<p> whether to sympathize or no.  Hollingsworth's behavior was certainly a <\p> 
<p> great deal more creditable than mine. <\p> 

<p> "Let us not pry further into her secrets," he said to Zenobia and the <\p> 
<p> rest of us, apart; and his dark, shaggy face looked really beautiful <\p> 
<p> with its expression of thoughtful benevolence.  "Let us conclude that <\p> 
<p> Providence has sent her to us, as the first-fruits of the world, which <\p> 
<p> we have undertaken to make happier than we find it.  Let us warm her <\p> 
<p> poor, shivering body with this good fire, and her poor, shivering heart <\p> 
<p> with our best kindness.  Let us feed her, and make her one of us.  As <\p> 
<p> we do by this friendless girl, so shall we prosper. And, in good time, <\p> 
<p> whatever is desirable for us to know will be melted out of her, as <\p> 
<p> inevitably as those tears which we see now." <\p> 

<p> "At least," remarked I, "you may tell us how and where you met with <\p> 
<p> her." <\p> 

<p> "An old man brought her to my lodgings," answered Hollingsworth, "and <\p> 
<p> begged me to convey her to Blithedale, where--so I understood him--she <\p> 
<p> had friends; and this is positively all I know about the matter." <\p> 

<p> Grim Silas Foster, all this while, had been busy at the supper-table, <\p> 
<p> pouring out his own tea and gulping it down with no more sense of its <\p> 
<p> exquisiteness than if it were a decoction of catnip; helping himself to <\p> 
<p> pieces of dipt toast on the flat of his knife blade, and dropping half <\p> 
<p> of it on the table-cloth; using the same serviceable implement to cut <\p> 
<p> slice after slice of ham; perpetrating terrible enormities with the <\p> 
<p> butter-plate; and in all other respects behaving less like a civilized <\p> 
<p> Christian than the worst kind of an ogre.  Being by this time fully <\p> 
<p> gorged, he crowned his amiable exploits with a draught from the water <\p> 
<p> pitcher, and then favored us with his opinion about the business in <\p> 
<p> hand.  And, certainly, though they proceeded out of an unwiped mouth, <\p> 
<p> his expressions did him honor. <\p> 

<p> "Give the girl a hot cup of tea and a thick slice of this first-rate <\p> 
<p> bacon," said Silas, like a sensible man as he was.  "That's what she <\p> 
<p> wants.  Let her stay with us as long as she likes, and help in the <\p> 
<p> kitchen, and take the cow-breath at milking time; and, in a week or <\p> 
<p> two, she'll begin to look like a creature of this world." <\p> 

<p> So we sat down again to supper, and Priscilla along with us. <\p> 

<p> V. UNTIL BEDTIME <\p> 

<p> Silas Foster, by the time we concluded our meal, had stript off his <\p> 
<p> coat, and planted himself on a low chair by the kitchen fire, with a <\p> 
<p> lapstone, a hammer, a piece of sole leather, and some waxed-ends, in <\p> 
<p> order to cobble an old pair of cowhide boots; he being, in his own <\p> 
<p> phrase, "something of a dab" (whatever degree of skill that may imply) <\p> 
<p> at the shoemaking business.  We heard the tap of his hammer at <\p> 
<p> intervals for the rest of the evening.  The remainder of the party <\p> 
<p> adjourned to the sitting-room.  Good Mrs. Foster took her <\p> 
<p> knitting-work, and soon fell fast asleep, still keeping her needles in <\p> 
<p> brisk movement, and, to the best of my observation, absolutely footing <\p> 
<p> a stocking out of the texture of a dream.  And a very substantial <\p> 
<p> stocking it seemed to be.  One of the two handmaidens hemmed a towel, <\p> 
<p> and the other appeared to be making a ruffle, for her Sunday's wear, <\p> 
<p> out of a little bit of embroidered muslin which Zenobia had probably <\p> 
<p> given her. <\p> 

<p> It was curious to observe how trustingly, and yet how timidly, our poor <\p> 
<p> Priscilla betook herself into the shadow of Zenobia's protection. She <\p> 
<p> sat beside her on a stool, looking up every now and then with an <\p> 
<p> expression of humble delight at her new friend's beauty.  A brilliant <\p> 
<p> woman is often an object of the devoted admiration--it might almost be <\p> 
<p> termed worship, or idolatry--of some young girl, who perhaps beholds <\p> 
<p> the cynosure only at an awful distance, and has as little hope of <\p> 
<p> personal intercourse as of climbing among the stars of heaven.  We men <\p> 
<p> are too gross to comprehend it.  Even a woman, of mature age, despises <\p> 
<p> or laughs at such a passion.  There occurred to me no mode of <\p> 
<p> accounting for Priscilla's behavior, except by supposing that she had <\p> 
<p> read some of Zenobia's stories (as such literature goes everywhere), or <\p> 
<p> her tracts in defence of the sex, and had come hither with the one <\p> 
<p> purpose of being her slave.  There is nothing parallel to this, I <\p> 
<p> believe,--nothing so foolishly disinterested, and hardly anything so <\p> 
<p> beautiful,--in the masculine nature, at whatever epoch of life; or, if <\p> 
<p> there be, a fine and rare development of character might reasonably be <\p> 
<p> looked for from the youth who should prove himself capable of such <\p> 
<p> self-forgetful affection. <\p> 

<p> Zenobia happening to change her seat, I took the opportunity, in an <\p> 
<p> undertone, to suggest some such notion as the above. <\p> 

<p> "Since you see the young woman in so poetical a light," replied she in <\p> 
<p> the same tone, "you had better turn the affair into a ballad.  It is a <\p> 
<p> grand subject, and worthy of supernatural machinery.  The storm, the <\p> 
<p> startling knock at the door, the entrance of the sable knight <\p> 
<p> Hollingsworth and this shadowy snow-maiden, who, precisely at the <\p> 
<p> stroke of midnight, shall melt away at my feet in a pool of ice-cold <\p> 
<p> water and give me my death with a pair of wet slippers!  And when the <\p> 
<p> verses are written, and polished quite to your mind, I will favor you <\p> 
<p> with my idea as to what the girl really is." <\p> 

<p> "Pray let me have it now," said I; "it shall be woven into the ballad." <\p> 

<p> "She is neither more nor less," answered Zenobia, "than a seamstress <\p> 
<p> from the city; and she has probably no more transcendental purpose than <\p> 
<p> to do my miscellaneous sewing, for I suppose she will hardly expect to <\p> 
<p> make my dresses." <\p> 

<p> "How can you decide upon her so easily?"  I inquired. <\p> 

<p> "Oh, we women judge one another by tokens that escape the obtuseness of <\p> 
<p> masculine perceptions!" said Zenobia.  "There is no proof which you <\p> 
<p> would be likely to appreciate, except the needle marks on the tip of <\p> 
<p> her forefinger.  Then, my supposition perfectly accounts for her <\p> 
<p> paleness, her nervousness, and her wretched fragility.  Poor thing! She <\p> 
<p> has been stifled with the heat of a salamander stove, in a small, close <\p> 
<p> room, and has drunk coffee, and fed upon doughnuts, raisins, candy, and <\p> 
<p> all such trash, till she is scarcely half alive; and so, as she has <\p> 
<p> hardly any physique, a poet like Mr. Miles Coverdale may be allowed to <\p> 
<p> think her spiritual." <\p> 

<p> "Look at her now!" whispered I. <\p> 

<p> Priscilla was gazing towards us with an inexpressible sorrow in her wan <\p> 
<p> face and great tears running down her cheeks.  It was difficult to <\p> 
<p> resist the impression that, cautiously as we had lowered our voices, <\p> 
<p> she must have overheard and been wounded by Zenobia's scornful estimate <\p> 
<p> of her character and purposes. <\p> 

<p> "What ears the girl must have!" whispered Zenobia, with a look of <\p> 
<p> vexation, partly comic and partly real.  "I will confess to you that I <\p> 
<p> cannot quite make her out.  However, I am positively not an ill-natured <\p> 
<p> person, unless when very grievously provoked,--and as you, and <\p> 
<p> especially Mr. Hollingsworth, take so much interest in this odd <\p> 
<p> creature, and as she knocks with a very slight tap against my own heart <\p> 
<p> likewise,--why, I mean to let her in.  From this moment I will be <\p> 
<p> reasonably kind to her.  There is no pleasure in tormenting a person of <\p> 
<p> one's own sex, even if she do favor one with a little more love than <\p> 
<p> one can conveniently dispose of; and that, let me say, Mr. Coverdale, <\p> 
<p> is the most troublesome offence you can offer to a woman." <\p> 

<p> "Thank you," said I, smiling; "I don't mean to be guilty of it." <\p> 

<p> She went towards Priscilla, took her hand, and passed her own rosy <\p> 
<p> finger-tips, with a pretty, caressing movement, over the girl's hair. <\p> 
<p> The touch had a magical effect.  So vivid a look of joy flushed up <\p> 
<p> beneath those fingers, that it seemed as if the sad and wan Priscilla <\p> 
<p> had been snatched away, and another kind of creature substituted in her <\p> 
<p> place.  This one caress, bestowed voluntarily by Zenobia, was evidently <\p> 
<p> received as a pledge of all that the stranger sought from her, whatever <\p> 
<p> the unuttered boon might be.  From that instant, too, she melted in <\p> 
<p> quietly amongst us, and was no longer a foreign element. Though always <\p> 
<p> an object of peculiar interest, a riddle, and a theme of frequent <\p> 
<p> discussion, her tenure at Blithedale was thenceforth fixed.  We no more <\p> 
<p> thought of questioning it, than if Priscilla had been recognized as a <\p> 
<p> domestic sprite, who had haunted the rustic fireside of old, before we <\p> 
<p> had ever been warmed by its blaze. <\p> 

<p> She now produced, out of a work-bag that she had with her, some little <\p> 
<p> wooden instruments (what they are called I never knew), and proceeded <\p> 
<p> to knit, or net, an article which ultimately took the shape of a silk <\p> 
<p> purse.  As the work went on, I remembered to have seen just such purses <\p> 
<p> before; indeed, I was the possessor of one.  Their peculiar excellence, <\p> 
<p> besides the great delicacy and beauty of the manufacture, lay in the <\p> 
<p> almost impossibility that any uninitiated person should discover the <\p> 
<p> aperture; although, to a practised touch, they would open as wide as <\p> 
<p> charity or prodigality might wish.  I wondered if it were not a symbol <\p> 
<p> of Priscilla's own mystery. <\p> 

<p> Notwithstanding the new confidence with which Zenobia had inspired her, <\p> 
<p> our guest showed herself disquieted by the storm.  When the strong <\p> 
<p> puffs of wind spattered the snow against the windows and made the oaken <\p> 
<p> frame of the farmhouse creak, she looked at us apprehensively, as if to <\p> 
<p> inquire whether these tempestuous outbreaks did not betoken some <\p> 
<p> unusual mischief in the shrieking blast.  She had been bred up, no <\p> 
<p> doubt, in some close nook, some inauspiciously sheltered court of the <\p> 
<p> city, where the uttermost rage of a tempest, though it might scatter <\p> 
<p> down the slates of the roof into the bricked area, could not shake the <\p> 
<p> casement of her little room.  The sense of vast, undefined space, <\p> 
<p> pressing from the outside against the black panes of our uncurtained <\p> 
<p> windows, was fearful to the poor girl, heretofore accustomed to the <\p> 
<p> narrowness of human limits, with the lamps of neighboring tenements <\p> 
<p> glimmering across the street.  The house probably seemed to her adrift <\p> 
<p> on the great ocean of the night. A little parallelogram of sky was all <\p> 
<p> that she had hitherto known of nature, so that she felt the awfulness <\p> 
<p> that really exists in its limitless extent.  Once, while the blast was <\p> 
<p> bellowing, she caught hold of Zenobia's robe, with precisely the air of <\p> 
<p> one who hears her own name spoken at a distance, but is unutterably <\p> 
<p> reluctant to obey the call. <\p> 

<p> We spent rather an incommunicative evening.  Hollingsworth hardly said <\p> 
<p> a word, unless when repeatedly and pertinaciously addressed. Then, <\p> 
<p> indeed, he would glare upon us from the thick shrubbery of his <\p> 
<p> meditations like a tiger out of a jungle, make the briefest reply <\p> 
<p> possible, and betake himself back into the solitude of his heart and <\p> 
<p> mind.  The poor fellow had contracted this ungracious habit from the <\p> 
<p> intensity with which he contemplated his own ideas, and the infrequent <\p> 
<p> sympathy which they met with from his auditors,--a circumstance that <\p> 
<p> seemed only to strengthen the implicit confidence that he awarded to <\p> 
<p> them.  His heart, I imagine, was never really interested in our <\p> 
<p> socialist scheme, but was forever busy with his strange, and, as most <\p> 
<p> people thought it, impracticable plan, for the reformation of criminals <\p> 
<p> through an appeal to their higher instincts. <\p> 

<p> Much as I liked Hollingsworth, it cost me many a groan to tolerate him <\p> 
<p> on this point.  He ought to have commenced his investigation of the <\p> 
<p> subject by perpetrating some huge sin in his proper person, and <\p> 
<p> examining the condition of his higher instincts afterwards. <\p> 

<p> The rest of us formed ourselves into a committee for providing our <\p> 
<p> infant community with an appropriate name,--a matter of greatly more <\p> 
<p> difficulty than the uninitiated reader would suppose.  Blithedale was <\p> 
<p> neither good nor bad.  We should have resumed the old Indian name of <\p> 
<p> the premises, had it possessed the oil-and-honey flow which the <\p> 
<p> aborigines were so often happy in communicating to their local <\p> 
<p> appellations; but it chanced to be a harsh, ill-connected, and <\p> 
<p> interminable word, which seemed to fill the mouth with a mixture of <\p> 
<p> very stiff clay and very crumbly pebbles.  Zenobia suggested "Sunny <\p> 
<p> Glimpse," as expressive of a vista into a better system of society. <\p> 
<p> This we turned over and over for a while, acknowledging its prettiness, <\p> 
<p> but concluded it to be rather too fine and sentimental a name (a fault <\p> 
<p> inevitable by literary ladies in such attempts) for sunburnt men to <\p> 
<p> work under.  I ventured to whisper "Utopia," which, however, was <\p> 
<p> unanimously scouted down, and the proposer very harshly maltreated, as <\p> 
<p> if he had intended a latent satire.  Some were for calling our <\p> 
<p> institution "The Oasis," in view of its being the one green spot in the <\p> 
<p> moral sand-waste of the world; but others insisted on a proviso for <\p> 
<p> reconsidering the matter at a twelvemonths' end, when a final decision <\p> 
<p> might be had, whether to name it "The Oasis" or "Sahara."  So, at last, <\p> 
<p> finding it impracticable to hammer out anything better, we resolved <\p> 
<p> that the spot should still be Blithedale, as being of good augury <\p> 
<p> enough. <\p> 

<p> The evening wore on, and the outer solitude looked in upon us through <\p> 
<p> the windows, gloomy, wild, and vague, like another state of existence, <\p> 
<p> close beside the little sphere of warmth and light in which we were the <\p> 
<p> prattlers and bustlers of a moment.  By and by the door was opened by <\p> 
<p> Silas Foster, with a cotton handkerchief about his head, and a tallow <\p> 
<p> candle in his hand. <\p> 

<p> "Take my advice, brother farmers," said he, with a great, broad, <\p> 
<p> bottomless yawn, "and get to bed as soon as you can.  I shall sound the <\p> 
<p> horn at daybreak; and we've got the cattle to fodder, and nine cows to <\p> 
<p> milk, and a dozen other things to do, before breakfast." <\p> 

<p> Thus ended the first evening at Blithedale.  I went shivering to my <\p> 
<p> fireless chamber, with the miserable consciousness (which had been <\p> 
<p> growing upon me for several hours past) that I had caught a tremendous <\p> 
<p> cold, and should probably awaken, at the blast of the horn, a fit <\p> 
<p> subject for a hospital.  The night proved a feverish one. During the <\p> 
<p> greater part of it, I was in that vilest of states when a fixed idea <\p> 
<p> remains in the mind, like the nail in Sisera's brain, while innumerable <\p> 
<p> other ideas go and come, and flutter to and fro, combining constant <\p> 
<p> transition with intolerable sameness.  Had I made a record of that <\p> 
<p> night's half-waking dreams, it is my belief that it would have <\p> 
<p> anticipated several of the chief incidents of this narrative, including <\p> 
<p> a dim shadow of its catastrophe.  Starting up in bed at length, I saw <\p> 
<p> that the storm was past, and the moon was shining on the snowy <\p> 
<p> landscape, which looked like a lifeless copy of the world in marble. <\p> 

<p> From the bank of the distant river, which was shimmering in the <\p> 
<p> moonlight, came the black shadow of the only cloud in heaven, driven <\p> 
<p> swiftly by the wind, and passing over meadow and hillock, vanishing <\p> 
<p> amid tufts of leafless trees, but reappearing on the hither side, until <\p> 
<p> it swept across our doorstep. <\p> 

<p> How cold an Arcadia was this! <\p> 

<p> VI. COVERDALE'S SICK-CHAMBER <\p> 

<p> The horn sounded at daybreak, as Silas Foster had forewarned us, harsh, <\p> 
<p> uproarious, inexorably drawn out, and as sleep-dispelling as if this <\p> 
<p> hard-hearted old yeoman had got hold of the trump of doom. <\p> 

<p> On all sides I could hear the creaking of the bedsteads, as the <\p> 
<p> brethren of Blithedale started from slumber, and thrust themselves into <\p> 
<p> their habiliments, all awry, no doubt, in their haste to begin the <\p> 
<p> reformation of the world.  Zenobia put her head into the entry, and <\p> 
<p> besought Silas Foster to cease his clamor, and to be kind enough to <\p> 
<p> leave an armful of firewood and a pail of water at her chamber door. <\p> 
<p> Of the whole household,--unless, indeed, it were Priscilla, for whose <\p> 
<p> habits, in this particular, I cannot vouch,--of all our apostolic <\p> 
<p> society, whose mission was to bless mankind, Hollingsworth, I <\p> 
<p> apprehend, was the only one who began the enterprise with prayer. My <\p> 
<p> sleeping-room being but thinly partitioned from his, the solemn murmur <\p> 
<p> of his voice made its way to my ears, compelling me to be an auditor of <\p> 
<p> his awful privacy with the Creator.  It affected me with a deep <\p> 
<p> reverence for Hollingsworth, which no familiarity then existing, or <\p> 
<p> that afterwards grew more intimate between us,--no, nor my subsequent <\p> 
<p> perception of his own great errors,--ever quite effaced. It is so rare, <\p> 
<p> in these times, to meet with a man of prayerful habits (except, of <\p> 
<p> course, in the pulpit), that such an one is decidedly marked out by the <\p> 
<p> light of transfiguration, shed upon him in the divine interview from <\p> 
<p> which he passes into his daily life. <\p> 

<p> As for me, I lay abed; and if I said my prayers, it was backward, <\p> 
<p> cursing my day as bitterly as patient Job himself.  The truth was, the <\p> 
<p> hot-house warmth of a town residence, and the luxurious life in which I <\p> 
<p> indulged myself, had taken much of the pith out of my physical system; <\p> 
<p> and the wintry blast of the preceding day, together with the general <\p> 
<p> chill of our airy old farmhouse, had got fairly into my heart and the <\p> 
<p> marrow of my bones.  In this predicament, I seriously wished--selfish <\p> 
<p> as it may appear--that the reformation of society had been postponed <\p> 
<p> about half a century, or, at all events, to such a date as should have <\p> 
<p> put my intermeddling with it entirely out of the question. <\p> 

<p> What, in the name of common-sense, had I to do with any better society <\p> 
<p> than I had always lived in?  It had satisfied me well enough. My <\p> 
<p> pleasant bachelor-parlor, sunny and shadowy, curtained and carpeted, <\p> 
<p> with the bedchamber adjoining; my centre-table, strewn with books and <\p> 
<p> periodicals; my writing-desk with a half-finished poem, in a stanza of <\p> 
<p> my own contrivance; my morning lounge at the reading-room or picture <\p> 
<p> gallery; my noontide walk along the cheery pavement, with the <\p> 
<p> suggestive succession of human faces, and the brisk throb of human life <\p> 
<p> in which I shared; my dinner at the Albion, where I had a hundred <\p> 
<p> dishes at command, and could banquet as delicately as the wizard <\p> 
<p> Michael Scott when the Devil fed him from the king of France's kitchen; <\p> 
<p> my evening at the billiard club, the concert, the theatre, or at <\p> 
<p> somebody's party, if I pleased,--what could be better than all this? <\p> 
<p> Was it better to hoe, to mow, to toil and moil amidst the accumulations <\p> 
<p> of a barnyard; to be the chambermaid of two yoke of oxen and a dozen <\p> 
<p> cows; to eat salt beef, and earn it with the sweat of my brow, and <\p> 
<p> thereby take the tough morsel out of some wretch's mouth, into whose <\p> 
<p> vocation I had thrust myself?  Above all, was it better to have a fever <\p> 
<p> and die blaspheming, as I was like to do? <\p> 

<p> In this wretched plight, with a furnace in my heart and another in my <\p> 
<p> head, by the heat of which I was kept constantly at the boiling point, <\p> 
<p> yet shivering at the bare idea of extruding so much as a finger into <\p> 
<p> the icy atmosphere of the room, I kept my bed until breakfast-time, <\p> 
<p> when Hollingsworth knocked at the door, and entered. <\p> 

<p> "Well, Coverdale," cried he, "you bid fair to make an admirable farmer! <\p> 
<p> Don't you mean to get up to-day?" <\p> 

<p> "Neither to-day nor to-morrow," said I hopelessly.  "I doubt if I ever <\p> 
<p> rise again!" <\p> 

<p> "What is the matter now?" he asked. <\p> 

<p> I told him my piteous case, and besought him to send me back to town in <\p> 
<p> a close carriage. <\p> 

<p> "No, no!" said Hollingsworth with kindly seriousness.  "If you are <\p> 
<p> really sick, we must take care of you." <\p> 

<p> Accordingly he built a fire in my chamber, and, having little else to <\p> 
<p> do while the snow lay on the ground, established himself as my nurse. A <\p> 
<p> doctor was sent for, who, being homaeopathic, gave me as much medicine, <\p> 
<p> in the course of a fortnight's attendance, as would have laid on the <\p> 
<p> point of a needle.  They fed me on water-gruel, and I speedily became a <\p> 
<p> skeleton above ground.  But, after all, I have many precious <\p> 
<p> recollections connected with that fit of sickness. <\p> 

<p> Hollingsworth's more than brotherly attendance gave me inexpressible <\p> 
<p> comfort.  Most men--and certainly I could not always claim to be one of <\p> 
<p> the exceptions--have a natural indifference, if not an absolutely <\p> 
<p> hostile feeling, towards those whom disease, or weakness, or calamity <\p> 
<p> of any kind causes to falter and faint amid the rude jostle of our <\p> 
<p> selfish existence.  The education of Christianity, it is true, the <\p> 
<p> sympathy of a like experience and the example of women, may soften and, <\p> 
<p> possibly, subvert this ugly characteristic of our sex; but it is <\p> 
<p> originally there, and has likewise its analogy in the practice of our <\p> 
<p> brute brethren, who hunt the sick or disabled member of the herd from <\p> 
<p> among them, as an enemy.  It is for this reason that the stricken deer <\p> 
<p> goes apart, and the sick lion grimly withdraws himself into his den. <\p> 
<p> Except in love, or the attachments of kindred, or other very long and <\p> 
<p> habitual affection, we really have no tenderness.  But there was <\p> 
<p> something of the woman moulded into the great, stalwart frame of <\p> 
<p> Hollingsworth; nor was he ashamed of it, as men often are of what is <\p> 
<p> best in them, nor seemed ever to know that there was such a soft place <\p> 
<p> in his heart.  I knew it well, however, at that time, although <\p> 
<p> afterwards it came nigh to be forgotten.  Methought there could not be <\p> 
<p> two such men alive as Hollingsworth.  There never was any blaze of a <\p> 
<p> fireside that warmed and cheered me, in the down-sinkings and <\p> 
<p> shiverings of my spirit, so effectually as did the light out of those <\p> 
<p> eyes, which lay so deep and dark under his shaggy brows. <\p> 

<p> Happy the man that has such a friend beside him when he comes to die! <\p> 
<p> and unless a friend like Hollingsworth be at hand,--as most probably <\p> 
<p> there will not,--he had better make up his mind to die alone.  How many <\p> 
<p> men, I wonder, does one meet with in a lifetime, whom he would choose <\p> 
<p> for his deathbed companions!  At the crisis of my fever I besought <\p> 
<p> Hollingsworth to let nobody else enter the room, but continually to <\p> 
<p> make me sensible of his own presence by a grasp of the hand, a word, a <\p> 
<p> prayer, if he thought good to utter it; and that then he should be the <\p> 
<p> witness how courageously I would encounter the worst. It still <\p> 
<p> impresses me as almost a matter of regret that I did not die then, when <\p> 
<p> I had tolerably made up my mind to it; for Hollingsworth would have <\p> 
<p> gone with me to the hither verge of life, and have sent his friendly <\p> 
<p> and hopeful accents far over on the other side, while I should be <\p> 
<p> treading the unknown path.  Now, were I to send for him, he would <\p> 
<p> hardly come to my bedside, nor should I depart the easier for his <\p> 
<p> presence. <\p> 

<p> "You are not going to die, this time," said he, gravely smiling. "You <\p> 
<p> know nothing about sickness, and think your case a great deal more <\p> 
<p> desperate than it is." <\p> 

<p> "Death should take me while I am in the mood," replied I, with a little <\p> 
<p> of my customary levity. <\p> 

<p> "Have you nothing to do in life," asked Hollingsworth, "that you fancy <\p> 
<p> yourself so ready to leave it?" <\p> 

<p> "Nothing," answered I; "nothing that I know of, unless to make pretty <\p> 
<p> verses, and play a part, with Zenobia and the rest of the amateurs, in <\p> 
<p> our pastoral.  It seems but an unsubstantial sort of business, as <\p> 
<p> viewed through a mist of fever.  But, dear Hollingsworth, your own <\p> 
<p> vocation is evidently to be a priest, and to spend your days and nights <\p> 
<p> in helping your fellow creatures to draw peaceful dying breaths." <\p> 

<p> "And by which of my qualities," inquired he, "can you suppose me fitted <\p> 
<p> for this awful ministry?" <\p> 

<p> "By your tenderness," I said.  "It seems to me the reflection of God's <\p> 
<p> own love." <\p> 

<p> "And you call me tender!" repeated Hollingsworth thoughtfully.  "I <\p> 
<p> should rather say that the most marked trait in my character is an <\p> 
<p> inflexible severity of purpose.  Mortal man has no right to be so <\p> 
<p> inflexible as it is my nature and necessity to be." <\p> 

<p> "I do not believe it," I replied. <\p> 

<p> But, in due time, I remembered what he said. <\p> 

<p> Probably, as Hollingsworth suggested, my disorder was never so serious <\p> 
<p> as, in my ignorance of such matters, I was inclined to consider it. <\p> 
<p> After so much tragical preparation, it was positively rather mortifying <\p> 
<p> to find myself on the mending hand. <\p> 

<p> All the other members of the Community showed me kindness, according to <\p> 
<p> the full measure of their capacity.  Zenobia brought me my gruel every <\p> 
<p> day, made by her own hands (not very skilfully, if the truth must be <\p> 
<p> told), and, whenever I seemed inclined to converse, would sit by my <\p> 
<p> bedside, and talk with so much vivacity as to add several gratuitous <\p> 
<p> throbs to my pulse.  Her poor little stories and tracts never half did <\p> 
<p> justice to her intellect.  It was only the lack of a fitter avenue that <\p> 
<p> drove her to seek development in literature.  She was made (among a <\p> 
<p> thousand other things that she might have been) for a stump oratress. <\p> 
<p> I recognized no severe culture in Zenobia; her mind was full of weeds. <\p> 
<p> It startled me sometimes, in my state of moral as well as bodily <\p> 
<p> faint-heartedness, to observe the hardihood of her philosophy.  She <\p> 
<p> made no scruple of oversetting all human institutions, and scattering <\p> 
<p> them as with a breeze from her fan.  A female reformer, in her attacks <\p> 
<p> upon society, has an instinctive sense of where the life lies, and is <\p> 
<p> inclined to aim directly at that spot.  Especially the relation between <\p> 
<p> the sexes is naturally among the earliest to attract her notice. <\p> 

<p> Zenobia was truly a magnificent woman.  The homely simplicity of her <\p> 
<p> dress could not conceal, nor scarcely diminish, the queenliness of her <\p> 
<p> presence.  The image of her form and face should have been multiplied <\p> 
<p> all over the earth.  It was wronging the rest of mankind to retain her <\p> 
<p> as the spectacle of only a few.  The stage would have been her proper <\p> 
<p> sphere.  She should have made it a point of duty, moreover, to sit <\p> 
<p> endlessly to painters and sculptors, and preferably to the latter; <\p> 
<p> because the cold decorum of the marble would consist with the utmost <\p> 
<p> scantiness of drapery, so that the eye might chastely be gladdened with <\p> 
<p> her material perfection in its entireness.  I know not well how to <\p> 
<p> express that the native glow of coloring in her cheeks, and even the <\p> 
<p> flesh-warmth over her round arms, and what was visible of her full <\p> 
<p> bust,--in a word, her womanliness incarnated,--compelled me sometimes <\p> 
<p> to close my eyes, as if it were not quite the privilege of modesty to <\p> 
<p> gaze at her.  Illness and exhaustion, no doubt, had made me morbidly <\p> 
<p> sensitive. <\p> 

<p> I noticed--and wondered how Zenobia contrived it--that she had always a <\p> 
<p> new flower in her hair.  And still it was a hot-house flower,--an <\p> 
<p> outlandish flower,--a flower of the tropics, such as appeared to have <\p> 
<p> sprung passionately out of a soil the very weeds of which would be <\p> 
<p> fervid and spicy.  Unlike as was the flower of each successive day to <\p> 
<p> the preceding one, it yet so assimilated its richness to the rich <\p> 
<p> beauty of the woman, that I thought it the only flower fit to be worn; <\p> 
<p> so fit, indeed, that Nature had evidently created this floral gem, in a <\p> 
<p> happy exuberance, for the one purpose of worthily adorning Zenobia's <\p> 
<p> head.  It might be that my feverish fantasies clustered themselves <\p> 
<p> about this peculiarity, and caused it to look more gorgeous and <\p> 
<p> wonderful than if beheld with temperate eyes.  In the height of my <\p> 
<p> illness, as I well recollect, I went so far as to pronounce it <\p> 
<p> preternatural. <\p> 

<p> "Zenobia is an enchantress!" whispered I once to Hollingsworth.  "She <\p> 
<p> is a sister of the Veiled Lady.  That flower in her hair is a talisman. <\p> 
<p> If you were to snatch it away, she would vanish, or be transformed into <\p> 
<p> something else." <\p> 

<p> "What does he say?" asked Zenobia. <\p> 

<p> "Nothing that has an atom of sense in it," answered Hollingsworth. "He <\p> 
<p> is a little beside himself, I believe, and talks about your being a <\p> 
<p> witch, and of some magical property in the flower that you wear in your <\p> 
<p> hair." <\p> 

<p> "It is an idea worthy of a feverish poet," said she, laughing rather <\p> 
<p> compassionately, and taking out the flower.  "I scorn to owe anything <\p> 
<p> to magic.  Here, Mr. Hollingsworth, you may keep the spell while it has <\p> 
<p> any virtue in it; but I cannot promise you not to appear with a new one <\p> 
<p> to-morrow.  It is the one relic of my more brilliant, my happier days!" <\p> 

<p> The most curious part of the matter was that, long after my slight <\p> 
<p> delirium had passed away,--as long, indeed, as I continued to know this <\p> 
<p> remarkable woman,--her daily flower affected my imagination, though <\p> 
<p> more slightly, yet in very much the same way.  The reason must have <\p> 
<p> been that, whether intentionally on her part or not, this favorite <\p> 
<p> ornament was actually a subtile expression of Zenobia's character. <\p> 

<p> One subject, about which--very impertinently, moreover--I perplexed <\p> 
<p> myself with a great many conjectures, was, whether Zenobia had ever <\p> 
<p> been married.  The idea, it must be understood, was unauthorized by any <\p> 
<p> circumstance or suggestion that had made its way to my ears.  So young <\p> 
<p> as I beheld her, and the freshest and rosiest woman of a thousand, <\p> 
<p> there was certainly no need of imputing to her a destiny already <\p> 
<p> accomplished; the probability was far greater that her coming years had <\p> 
<p> all life's richest gifts to bring.  If the great event of a woman's <\p> 
<p> existence had been consummated, the world knew nothing of it, although <\p> 
<p> the world seemed to know Zenobia well.  It was a ridiculous piece of <\p> 
<p> romance, undoubtedly, to imagine that this beautiful personage, wealthy <\p> 
<p> as she was, and holding a position that might fairly enough be called <\p> 
<p> distinguished, could have given herself away so privately, but that <\p> 
<p> some whisper and suspicion, and by degrees a full understanding of the <\p> 
<p> fact, would eventually be blown abroad. But then, as I failed not to <\p> 
<p> consider, her original home was at a distance of many hundred miles. <\p> 
<p> Rumors might fill the social atmosphere, or might once have filled it, <\p> 
<p> there, which would travel but slowly, against the wind, towards our <\p> 
<p> Northeastern metropolis, and perhaps melt into thin air before reaching <\p> 
<p> it. <\p> 

<p> There was not--and I distinctly repeat it--the slightest foundation in <\p> 
<p> my knowledge for any surmise of the kind.  But there is a species of <\p> 
<p> intuition,--either a spiritual lie or the subtile recognition of a <\p> 
<p> fact,--which comes to us in a reduced state of the corporeal system. <\p> 
<p> The soul gets the better of the body, after wasting illness, or when a <\p> 
<p> vegetable diet may have mingled too much ether in the blood. Vapors <\p> 
<p> then rise up to the brain, and take shapes that often image falsehood, <\p> 
<p> but sometimes truth.  The spheres of our companions have, at such <\p> 
<p> periods, a vastly greater influence upon our own than when robust <\p> 
<p> health gives us a repellent and self-defensive energy. Zenobia's <\p> 
<p> sphere, I imagine, impressed itself powerfully on mine, and transformed <\p> 
<p> me, during this period of my weakness, into something like a mesmerical <\p> 
<p> clairvoyant. <\p> 

<p> Then, also, as anybody could observe, the freedom of her deportment <\p> 
<p> (though, to some tastes, it might commend itself as the utmost <\p> 
<p> perfection of manner in a youthful widow or a blooming matron) was not <\p> 
<p> exactly maiden-like.  What girl had ever laughed as Zenobia did? What <\p> 
<p> girl had ever spoken in her mellow tones?  Her unconstrained and <\p> 
<p> inevitable manifestation, I said often to myself, was that of a woman <\p> 
<p> to whom wedlock had thrown wide the gates of mystery.  Yet sometimes I <\p> 
<p> strove to be ashamed of these conjectures.  I acknowledged it as a <\p> 
<p> masculine grossness--a sin of wicked interpretation, of which man is <\p> 
<p> often guilty towards the other sex--thus to mistake the sweet, liberal, <\p> 
<p> but womanly frankness of a noble and generous disposition. Still, it <\p> 
<p> was of no avail to reason with myself nor to upbraid myself. <\p> 
<p> Pertinaciously the thought, "Zenobia is a wife; Zenobia has lived and <\p> 
<p> loved!  There is no folded petal, no latent dewdrop, in this perfectly <\p> 
<p> developed rose!"--irresistibly that thought drove out all other <\p> 
<p> conclusions, as often as my mind reverted to the subject. <\p> 

<p> Zenobia was conscious of my observation, though not, I presume, of the <\p> 
<p> point to which it led me. <\p> 

<p> "Mr. Coverdale," said she one day, as she saw me watching her, while <\p> 
<p> she arranged my gruel on the table, "I have been exposed to a great <\p> 
<p> deal of eye-shot in the few years of my mixing in the world, but never, <\p> 
<p> I think, to precisely such glances as you are in the habit of favoring <\p> 
<p> me with.  I seem to interest you very much; and yet--or else a woman's <\p> 
<p> instinct is for once deceived--I cannot reckon you as an admirer.  What <\p> 
<p> are you seeking to discover in me?" <\p> 

<p> "The mystery of your life," answered I, surprised into the truth by the <\p> 
<p> unexpectedness of her attack.  "And you will never tell me." <\p> 

<p> She bent her head towards me, and let me look into her eyes, as if <\p> 
<p> challenging me to drop a plummet-line down into the depths of her <\p> 
<p> consciousness. <\p> 

<p> "I see nothing now," said I, closing my own eyes, "unless it be the <\p> 
<p> face of a sprite laughing at me from the bottom of a deep well." <\p> 

<p> A bachelor always feels himself defrauded, when he knows or suspects <\p> 
<p> that any woman of his acquaintance has given herself away.  Otherwise, <\p> 
<p> the matter could have been no concern of mine.  It was purely <\p> 
<p> speculative, for I should not, under any circumstances, have fallen in <\p> 
<p> love with Zenobia.  The riddle made me so nervous, however, in my <\p> 
<p> sensitive condition of mind and body, that I most ungratefully began to <\p> 
<p> wish that she would let me alone.  Then, too, her gruel was very <\p> 
<p> wretched stuff, with almost invariably the smell of pine smoke upon it, <\p> 
<p> like the evil taste that is said to mix itself up with a witch's best <\p> 
<p> concocted dainties.  Why could not she have allowed one of the other <\p> 
<p> women to take the gruel in charge?  Whatever else might be her gifts, <\p> 
<p> Nature certainly never intended Zenobia for a cook.  Or, if so, she <\p> 
<p> should have meddled only with the richest and spiciest dishes, and such <\p> 
<p> as are to be tasted at banquets, between draughts of intoxicating wine. <\p> 

<p> VII. THE CONVALESCENT <\p> 

<p> As soon as my incommodities allowed me to think of past occurrences, I <\p> 
<p> failed not to inquire what had become of the odd little guest whom <\p> 
<p> Hollingsworth had been the medium of introducing among us.  It now <\p> 
<p> appeared that poor Priscilla had not so literally fallen out of the <\p> 
<p> clouds, as we were at first inclined to suppose.  A letter, which <\p> 
<p> should have introduced her, had since been received from one of the <\p> 
<p> city missionaries, containing a certificate of character and an <\p> 
<p> allusion to circumstances which, in the writer's judgment, made it <\p> 
<p> especially desirable that she should find shelter in our Community. <\p> 
<p> There was a hint, not very intelligible, implying either that Priscilla <\p> 
<p> had recently escaped from some particular peril or irksomeness of <\p> 
<p> position, or else that she was still liable to this danger or <\p> 
<p> difficulty, whatever it might be.  We should ill have deserved the <\p> 
<p> reputation of a benevolent fraternity, had we hesitated to entertain a <\p> 
<p> petitioner in such need, and so strongly recommended to our kindness; <\p> 
<p> not to mention, moreover, that the strange maiden had set herself <\p> 
<p> diligently to work, and was doing good service with her needle.  But a <\p> 
<p> slight mist of uncertainty still floated about Priscilla, and kept her, <\p> 
<p> as yet, from taking a very decided place among creatures of flesh and <\p> 
<p> blood. <\p> 

<p> The mysterious attraction, which, from her first entrance on our scene, <\p> 
<p> she evinced for Zenobia, had lost nothing of its force.  I often heard <\p> 
<p> her footsteps, soft and low, accompanying the light but decided tread <\p> 
<p> of the latter up the staircase, stealing along the passage-way by her <\p> 
<p> new friend's side, and pausing while Zenobia entered my chamber. <\p> 
<p> Occasionally Zenobia would be a little annoyed by Priscilla's too close <\p> 
<p> attendance.  In an authoritative and not very kindly tone, she would <\p> 
<p> advise her to breathe the pleasant air in a walk, or to go with her <\p> 
<p> work into the barn, holding out half a promise to come and sit on the <\p> 
<p> hay with her, when at leisure. Evidently, Priscilla found but scanty <\p> 
<p> requital for her love. Hollingsworth was likewise a great favorite with <\p> 
<p> her.  For several minutes together sometimes, while my auditory nerves <\p> 
<p> retained the susceptibility of delicate health, I used to hear a low, <\p> 
<p> pleasant murmur ascending from the room below; and at last ascertained <\p> 
<p> it to be Priscilla's voice, babbling like a little brook to <\p> 
<p> Hollingsworth. She talked more largely and freely with him than with <\p> 
<p> Zenobia, towards whom, indeed, her feelings seemed not so much to be <\p> 
<p> confidence as involuntary affection.  I should have thought all the <\p> 
<p> better of my own qualities had Priscilla marked me out for the third <\p> 
<p> place in her regards.  But, though she appeared to like me tolerably <\p> 
<p> well, I could never flatter myself with being distinguished by her as <\p> 
<p> Hollingsworth and Zenobia were. <\p> 

<p> One forenoon, during my convalescence, there came a gentle tap at my <\p> 
<p> chamber door.  I immediately said, "Come in, Priscilla!" with an acute <\p> 
<p> sense of the applicant's identity.  Nor was I deceived.  It was really <\p> 
<p> Priscilla,--a pale, large-eyed little woman (for she had gone far <\p> 
<p> enough into her teens to be, at least, on the outer limit of girlhood), <\p> 
<p> but much less wan than at my previous view of her, and far better <\p> 
<p> conditioned both as to health and spirits.  As I first saw her, she had <\p> 
<p> reminded me of plants that one sometimes observes doing their best to <\p> 
<p> vegetate among the bricks of an enclosed court, where there is scanty <\p> 
<p> soil and never any sunshine.  At present, though with no approach to <\p> 
<p> bloom, there were indications that the girl had human blood in her <\p> 
<p> veins. <\p> 

<p> Priscilla came softly to my bedside, and held out an article of <\p> 
<p> snow-white linen, very carefully and smoothly ironed.  She did not seem <\p> 
<p> bashful, nor anywise embarrassed.  My weakly condition, I suppose, <\p> 
<p> supplied a medium in which she could approach me. <\p> 

<p> "Do not you need this?" asked she.  "I have made it for you."  It was a <\p> 
<p> nightcap! <\p> 

<p> "My dear Priscilla," said I, smiling, "I never had on a nightcap in my <\p> 
<p> life!  But perhaps it will be better for me to wear one, now that I am <\p> 
<p> a miserable invalid.  How admirably you have done it!  No, no; I never <\p> 
<p> can think of wearing such an exquisitely wrought nightcap as this, <\p> 
<p> unless it be in the daytime, when I sit up to receive company." <\p> 

<p> "It is for use, not beauty," answered Priscilla.  "I could have <\p> 
<p> embroidered it and made it much prettier, if I pleased." <\p> 

<p> While holding up the nightcap and admiring the fine needlework, I <\p> 
<p> perceived that Priscilla had a sealed letter which she was waiting for <\p> 
<p> me to take.  It had arrived from the village post-office that morning. <\p> 
<p> As I did not immediately offer to receive the letter, she drew it back, <\p> 
<p> and held it against her bosom, with both hands clasped over it, in a <\p> 
<p> way that had probably grown habitual to her.  Now, on turning my eyes <\p> 
<p> from the nightcap to Priscilla, it forcibly struck me that her air, <\p> 
<p> though not her figure, and the expression of her face, but not its <\p> 
<p> features, had a resemblance to what I had often seen in a friend of <\p> 
<p> mine, one of the most gifted women of the age.  I cannot describe it. <\p> 
<p> The points easiest to convey to the reader were a certain curve of the <\p> 
<p> shoulders and a partial closing of the eyes, which seemed to look more <\p> 
<p> penetratingly into my own eyes, through the narrowed apertures, than if <\p> 
<p> they had been open at full width.  It was a singular anomaly of <\p> 
<p> likeness coexisting with perfect dissimilitude. <\p> 

<p> "Will you give me the letter, Priscilla?" said I. <\p> 

<p> She started, put the letter into my hand, and quite lost the look that <\p> 
<p> had drawn my notice. <\p> 

<p> "Priscilla," I inquired, "did you ever see Miss Margaret Fuller?" <\p> 

<p> "No," she answered. <\p> 

<p> "Because," said I, "you reminded me of her just now,--and it happens, <\p> 
<p> strangely enough, that this very letter is from her." <\p> 

<p> Priscilla, for whatever reason, looked very much discomposed. <\p> 

<p> "I wish people would not fancy such odd things in me!" she said rather <\p> 
<p> petulantly.  "How could I possibly make myself resemble this lady <\p> 
<p> merely by holding her letter in my hand?" <\p> 

<p> "Certainly, Priscilla, it would puzzle me to explain it," I replied; <\p> 
<p> "nor do I suppose that the letter had anything to do with it.  It was <\p> 
<p> just a coincidence, nothing more." <\p> 

<p> She hastened out of the room, and this was the last that I saw of <\p> 
<p> Priscilla until I ceased to be an invalid. <\p> 

<p> Being much alone during my recovery, I read interminably in Mr. <\p> 
<p> Emerson's Essays, "The Dial," Carlyle's works, George Sand's romances <\p> 
<p> (lent me by Zenobia), and other books which one or another of the <\p> 
<p> brethren or sisterhood had brought with them.  Agreeing in little else, <\p> 
<p> most of these utterances were like the cry of some solitary sentinel, <\p> 
<p> whose station was on the outposts of the advance guard of human <\p> 
<p> progression; or sometimes the voice came sadly from among the shattered <\p> 
<p> ruins of the past, but yet had a hopeful echo in the future. They were <\p> 
<p> well adapted (better, at least, than any other intellectual products, <\p> 
<p> the volatile essence of which had heretofore tinctured a printed page) <\p> 
<p> to pilgrims like ourselves, whose present bivouac was considerably <\p> 
<p> further into the waste of chaos than any mortal army of crusaders had <\p> 
<p> ever marched before.  Fourier's works, also, in a series of horribly <\p> 
<p> tedious volumes, attracted a good deal of my attention, from the <\p> 
<p> analogy which I could not but recognize between his system and our own. <\p> 
<p> There was far less resemblance, it is true, than the world chose to <\p> 
<p> imagine, inasmuch as the two theories differed, as widely as the zenith <\p> 
<p> from the nadir, in their main principles. <\p> 

<p> I talked about Fourier to Hollingsworth, and translated, for his <\p> 
<p> benefit, some of the passages that chiefly impressed me. <\p> 

<p> "When, as a consequence of human improvement," said I, "the globe shall <\p> 
<p> arrive at its final perfection, the great ocean is to be converted into <\p> 
<p> a particular kind of lemonade, such as was fashionable at Paris in <\p> 
<p> Fourier's time.  He calls it limonade a cedre.  It is positively a <\p> 
<p> fact!  Just imagine the city docks filled, every day, with a flood tide <\p> 
<p> of this delectable beverage!" <\p> 

<p> "Why did not the Frenchman make punch of it at once?" asked <\p> 
<p> Hollingsworth.  "The jack-tars would be delighted to go down in ships <\p> 
<p> and do business in such an element." <\p> 

<p> I further proceeded to explain, as well as I modestly could, several <\p> 
<p> points of Fourier's system, illustrating them with here and there a <\p> 
<p> page or two, and asking Hollingsworth's opinion as to the expediency of <\p> 
<p> introducing these beautiful peculiarities into our own practice. <\p> 

<p> "Let me hear no more of it!" cried he, in utter disgust.  "I never will <\p> 
<p> forgive this fellow!  He has committed the unpardonable sin; for what <\p> 
<p> more monstrous iniquity could the Devil himself contrive than to choose <\p> 
<p> the selfish principle,--the principle of all human wrong, the very <\p> 
<p> blackness of man's heart, the portion of ourselves which we shudder at, <\p> 
<p> and which it is the whole aim of spiritual discipline to eradicate,--to <\p> 
<p> choose it as the master workman of his system?  To seize upon and <\p> 
<p> foster whatever vile, petty, sordid, filthy, bestial, and abominable <\p> 
<p> corruptions have cankered into our nature, to be the efficient <\p> 
<p> instruments of his infernal regeneration!  And his consummated <\p> 
<p> Paradise, as he pictures it, would be worthy of the agency which he <\p> 
<p> counts upon for establishing it.  The nauseous villain!" <\p> 

<p> "Nevertheless," remarked I, "in consideration of the promised delights <\p> 
<p> of his system,--so very proper, as they certainly are, to be <\p> 
<p> appreciated by Fourier's countrymen,--I cannot but wonder that <\p> 
<p> universal France did not adopt his theory at a moment's warning.  But <\p> 
<p> is there not something very characteristic of his nation in Fourier's <\p> 
<p> manner of putting forth his views?  He makes no claim to inspiration. <\p> 
<p> He has not persuaded himself--as Swedenborg did, and as any other than <\p> 
<p> a Frenchman would, with a mission of like importance to <\p> 
<p> communicate--that he speaks with authority from above.  He promulgates <\p> 
<p> his system, so far as I can perceive, entirely on his own <\p> 
<p> responsibility.  He has searched out and discovered the whole counsel <\p> 
<p> of the Almighty in respect to mankind, past, present, and for exactly <\p> 
<p> seventy thousand years to come, by the mere force and cunning of his <\p> 
<p> individual intellect!" <\p> 

<p> "Take the book out of my sight," said Hollingsworth with great <\p> 
<p> virulence of expression, "or, I tell you fairly, I shall fling it in <\p> 
<p> the fire!  And as for Fourier, let him make a Paradise, if he can, of <\p> 
<p> Gehenna, where, as I conscientiously believe, he is floundering at this <\p> 
<p> moment!" <\p> 

<p> "And bellowing, I suppose," said I,--not that I felt any ill-will <\p> 
<p> towards Fourier, but merely wanted to give the finishing touch to <\p> 
<p> Hollingsworth's image, "bellowing for the least drop of his beloved <\p> 
<p> limonade a cedre!" <\p> 

<p> There is but little profit to be expected in attempting to argue with a <\p> 
<p> man who allows himself to declaim in this manner; so I dropt the <\p> 
<p> subject, and never took it up again. <\p> 

<p> But had the system at which he was so enraged combined almost any <\p> 
<p> amount of human wisdom, spiritual insight, and imaginative beauty, I <\p> 
<p> question whether Hollingsworth's mind was in a fit condition to receive <\p> 
<p> it.  I began to discern that he had come among us actuated by no real <\p> 
<p> sympathy with our feelings and our hopes, but chiefly because we were <\p> 
<p> estranging ourselves from the world, with which his lonely and <\p> 
<p> exclusive object in life had already put him at odds. Hollingsworth <\p> 
<p> must have been originally endowed with a great spirit of benevolence, <\p> 
<p> deep enough and warm enough to be the source of as much disinterested <\p> 
<p> good as Providence often allows a human being the privilege of <\p> 
<p> conferring upon his fellows.  This native instinct yet lived within <\p> 
<p> him.  I myself had profited by it, in my necessity.  It was seen, too, <\p> 
<p> in his treatment of Priscilla.  Such casual circumstances as were here <\p> 
<p> involved would quicken his divine power of sympathy, and make him seem, <\p> 
<p> while their influence lasted, the tenderest man and the truest friend <\p> 
<p> on earth.  But by and by you missed the tenderness of yesterday, and <\p> 
<p> grew drearily conscious that Hollingsworth had a closer friend than <\p> 
<p> ever you could be; and this friend was the cold, spectral monster which <\p> 
<p> he had himself conjured up, and on which he was wasting all the warmth <\p> 
<p> of his heart, and of which, at last,--as these men of a mighty purpose <\p> 
<p> so invariably do,--he had grown to be the bond-slave.  It was his <\p> 
<p> philanthropic theory. <\p> 

<p> This was a result exceedingly sad to contemplate, considering that it <\p> 
<p> had been mainly brought about by the very ardor and exuberance of his <\p> 
<p> philanthropy.  Sad, indeed, but by no means unusual: he had taught his <\p> 
<p> benevolence to pour its warm tide exclusively through one channel; so <\p> 
<p> that there was nothing to spare for other great manifestations of love <\p> 
<p> to man, nor scarcely for the nutriment of individual attachments, <\p> 
<p> unless they could minister in some way to the terrible egotism which he <\p> 
<p> mistook for an angel of God.  Had Hollingsworth's education been more <\p> 
<p> enlarged, he might not so inevitably have stumbled into this pitfall. <\p> 
<p> But this identical pursuit had educated him.  He knew absolutely <\p> 
<p> nothing, except in a single direction, where he had thought so <\p> 
<p> energetically, and felt to such a depth, that no doubt the entire <\p> 
<p> reason and justice of the universe appeared to be concentrated <\p> 
<p> thitherward. <\p> 

<p> It is my private opinion that, at this period of his life, <\p> 
<p> Hollingsworth was fast going mad; and, as with other crazy people <\p> 
<p> (among whom I include humorists of every degree), it required all the <\p> 
<p> constancy of friendship to restrain his associates from pronouncing him <\p> 
<p> an intolerable bore.  Such prolonged fiddling upon one string--such <\p> 
<p> multiform presentation of one idea!  His specific object (of which he <\p> 
<p> made the public more than sufficiently aware, through the medium of <\p> 
<p> lectures and pamphlets) was to obtain funds for the construction of an <\p> 
<p> edifice, with a sort of collegiate endowment.  On this foundation he <\p> 
<p> purposed to devote himself and a few disciples to the reform and mental <\p> 
<p> culture of our criminal brethren.  His visionary edifice was <\p> 
<p> Hollingsworth's one castle in the air; it was the material type in <\p> 
<p> which his philanthropic dream strove to embody itself; and he made the <\p> 
<p> scheme more definite, and caught hold of it the more strongly, and kept <\p> 
<p> his clutch the more pertinaciously, by rendering it visible to the <\p> 
<p> bodily eye.  I have seen him, a hundred times, with a pencil and sheet <\p> 
<p> of paper, sketching the facade, the side-view, or the rear of the <\p> 
<p> structure, or planning the internal arrangements, as lovingly as <\p> 
<p> another man might plan those of the projected home where he meant to be <\p> 
<p> happy with his wife and children. I have known him to begin a model of <\p> 
<p> the building with little stones, gathered at the brookside, whither we <\p> 
<p> had gone to cool ourselves in the sultry noon of haying-time.  Unlike <\p> 
<p> all other ghosts, his spirit haunted an edifice, which, instead of <\p> 
<p> being time-worn, and full of storied love, and joy, and sorrow, had <\p> 
<p> never yet come into existence. <\p> 

<p> "Dear friend," said I once to Hollingsworth, before leaving my <\p> 
<p> sick-chamber, "I heartily wish that I could make your schemes my <\p> 
<p> schemes, because it would be so great a happiness to find myself <\p> 
<p> treading the same path with you.  But I am afraid there is not stuff in <\p> 
<p> me stern enough for a philanthropist,--or not in this peculiar <\p> 
<p> direction,--or, at all events, not solely in this.  Can you bear with <\p> 
<p> me, if such should prove to be the case?" <\p> 

<p> "I will at least wait awhile," answered Hollingsworth, gazing at me <\p> 
<p> sternly and gloomily.  "But how can you be my life-long friend, except <\p> 
<p> you strive with me towards the great object of my life?" <\p> 

<p> Heaven forgive me!  A horrible suspicion crept into my heart, and stung <\p> 
<p> the very core of it as with the fangs of an adder.  I wondered whether <\p> 
<p> it were possible that Hollingsworth could have watched by my bedside, <\p> 
<p> with all that devoted care, only for the ulterior purpose of making me <\p> 
<p> a proselyte to his views! <\p> 

<p> VIII. A MODERN ARCADIA <\p> 

<p> May-day--I forget whether by Zenobia's sole decree, or by the unanimous <\p> 
<p> vote of our community--had been declared a movable festival. It was <\p> 
<p> deferred until the sun should have had a reasonable time to clear away <\p> 
<p> the snowdrifts along the lee of the stone walls, and bring out a few of <\p> 
<p> the readiest wild flowers.  On the forenoon of the substituted day, <\p> 
<p> after admitting some of the balmy air into my chamber, I decided that <\p> 
<p> it was nonsense and effeminacy to keep myself a prisoner any longer. <\p> 
<p> So I descended to the sitting-room, and finding nobody there, proceeded <\p> 
<p> to the barn, whence I had already heard Zenobia's voice, and along with <\p> 
<p> it a girlish laugh which was not so certainly recognizable.  Arriving <\p> 
<p> at the spot, it a little surprised me to discover that these merry <\p> 
<p> outbreaks came from Priscilla. <\p> 

<p> The two had been a-maying together.  They had found anemones in <\p> 
<p> abundance, houstonias by the handful, some columbines, a few <\p> 
<p> long-stalked violets, and a quantity of white everlasting flowers, and <\p> 
<p> had filled up their basket with the delicate spray of shrubs and trees. <\p> 
<p> None were prettier than the maple twigs, the leaf of which looks like a <\p> 
<p> scarlet bud in May, and like a plate of vegetable gold in October. <\p> 
<p> Zenobia, who showed no conscience in such matters, had also rifled a <\p> 
<p> cherry-tree of one of its blossomed boughs, and, with all this variety <\p> 
<p> of sylvan ornament, had been decking out Priscilla. Being done with a <\p> 
<p> good deal of taste, it made her look more charming than I should have <\p> 
<p> thought possible, with my recollection of the wan, frost-nipt girl, as <\p> 
<p> heretofore described.  Nevertheless, among those fragrant blossoms, and <\p> 
<p> conspicuously, too, had been stuck a weed of evil odor and ugly aspect, <\p> 
<p> which, as soon as I detected it, destroyed the effect of all the rest. <\p> 
<p> There was a gleam of latent mischief--not to call it deviltry--in <\p> 
<p> Zenobia's eye, which seemed to indicate a slightly malicious purpose in <\p> 
<p> the arrangement. <\p> 

<p> As for herself, she scorned the rural buds and leaflets, and wore <\p> 
<p> nothing but her invariable flower of the tropics. <\p> 

<p> "What do you think of Priscilla now, Mr. Coverdale?" asked she, <\p> 
<p> surveying her as a child does its doll.  "Is not she worth a verse or <\p> 
<p> two?" <\p> 

<p> "There is only one thing amiss," answered I. Zenobia laughed, and flung <\p> 
<p> the malignant weed away. <\p> 

<p> "Yes; she deserves some verses now," said I, "and from a better poet <\p> 
<p> than myself.  She is the very picture of the New England spring; <\p> 
<p> subdued in tint and rather cool, but with a capacity of sunshine, and <\p> 
<p> bringing us a few Alpine blossoms, as earnest of something richer, <\p> 
<p> though hardly more beautiful, hereafter.  The best type of her is one <\p> 
<p> of those anemones." <\p> 

<p> "What I find most singular in Priscilla, as her health improves," <\p> 
<p> observed Zenobia, "is her wildness.  Such a quiet little body as she <\p> 
<p> seemed, one would not have expected that.  Why, as we strolled the <\p> 
<p> woods together, I could hardly keep her from scrambling up the trees, <\p> 
<p> like a squirrel.  She has never before known what it is to live in the <\p> 
<p> free air, and so it intoxicates her as if she were sipping wine. And <\p> 
<p> she thinks it such a paradise here, and all of us, particularly Mr. <\p> 
<p> Hollingsworth and myself, such angels!  It is quite ridiculous, and <\p> 
<p> provokes one's malice almost, to see a creature so happy, especially a <\p> 
<p> feminine creature." <\p> 

<p> "They are always happier than male creatures," said I. <\p> 

<p> "You must correct that opinion, Mr. Coverdale," replied Zenobia <\p> 
<p> contemptuously, "or I shall think you lack the poetic insight.  Did you <\p> 
<p> ever see a happy woman in your life?  Of course, I do not mean a girl, <\p> 
<p> like Priscilla and a thousand others,--for they are all alike, while on <\p> 
<p> the sunny side of experience,--but a grown woman.  How can she be <\p> 
<p> happy, after discovering that fate has assigned her but one single <\p> 
<p> event, which she must contrive to make the substance of her whole life? <\p> 
<p> A man has his choice of innumerable events." <\p> 

<p> "A woman, I suppose," answered I, "by constant repetition of her one <\p> 
<p> event, may compensate for the lack of variety." <\p> 

<p> "Indeed!" said Zenobia. <\p> 

<p> While we were talking, Priscilla caught sight of Hollingsworth at a <\p> 
<p> distance, in a blue frock, and with a hoe over his shoulder, returning <\p> 
<p> from the field.  She immediately set out to meet him, running and <\p> 
<p> skipping, with spirits as light as the breeze of the May morning, but <\p> 
<p> with limbs too little exercised to be quite responsive; she clapped her <\p> 
<p> hands, too, with great exuberance of gesture, as is the custom of young <\p> 
<p> girls when their electricity overcharges them. But, all at once, midway <\p> 
<p> to Hollingsworth, she paused, looked round about her, towards the <\p> 
<p> river, the road, the woods, and back towards us, appearing to listen, <\p> 
<p> as if she heard some one calling her name, and knew not precisely in <\p> 
<p> what direction. <\p> 

<p> "Have you bewitched her?"  I exclaimed. <\p> 

<p> "It is no sorcery of mine," said Zenobia; "but I have seen the girl do <\p> 
<p> that identical thing once or twice before.  Can you imagine what is the <\p> 
<p> matter with her?" <\p> 

<p> "No; unless," said I, "she has the gift of hearing those 'airy tongues <\p> 
<p> that syllable men's names,' which Milton tells about." <\p> 

<p> From whatever cause, Priscilla's animation seemed entirely to have <\p> 
<p> deserted her.  She seated herself on a rock, and remained there until <\p> 
<p> Hollingsworth came up; and when he took her hand and led her back to <\p> 
<p> us, she rather resembled my original image of the wan and spiritless <\p> 
<p> Priscilla than the flowery May-queen of a few moments ago.  These <\p> 
<p> sudden transformations, only to be accounted for by an extreme nervous <\p> 
<p> susceptibility, always continued to characterize the girl, though with <\p> 
<p> diminished frequency as her health progressively grew more robust. <\p> 

<p> I was now on my legs again.  My fit of illness had been an avenue <\p> 
<p> between two existences; the low-arched and darksome doorway, through <\p> 
<p> which I crept out of a life of old conventionalisms, on my hands and <\p> 
<p> knees, as it were, and gained admittance into the freer region that lay <\p> 
<p> beyond.  In this respect, it was like death.  And, as with death, too, <\p> 
<p> it was good to have gone through it.  No otherwise could I have rid <\p> 
<p> myself of a thousand follies, fripperies, prejudices, habits, and other <\p> 
<p> such worldly dust as inevitably settles upon the crowd along the broad <\p> 
<p> highway, giving them all one sordid aspect before noon-time, however <\p> 
<p> freshly they may have begun their pilgrimage in the dewy morning.  The <\p> 
<p> very substance upon my bones had not been fit to live with in any <\p> 
<p> better, truer, or more energetic mode than that to which I was <\p> 
<p> accustomed.  So it was taken off me and flung aside, like any other <\p> 
<p> worn-out or unseasonable garment; and, after shivering a little while <\p> 
<p> in my skeleton, I began to be clothed anew, and much more <\p> 
<p> satisfactorily than in my previous suit.  In literal and physical <\p> 
<p> truth, I was quite another man.  I had a lively sense of the exultation <\p> 
<p> with which the spirit will enter on the next stage of its eternal <\p> 
<p> progress after leaving the heavy burden of its mortality in an early <\p> 
<p> grave, with as little concern for what may become of it as now affected <\p> 
<p> me for the flesh which I had lost. <\p> 

<p> Emerging into the genial sunshine, I half fancied that the labors of <\p> 
<p> the brotherhood had already realized some of Fourier's predictions. <\p> 
<p> Their enlightened culture of the soil, and the virtues with which they <\p> 
<p> sanctified their life, had begun to produce an effect upon the material <\p> 
<p> world and its climate.  In my new enthusiasm, man looked strong and <\p> 
<p> stately,--and woman, oh, how beautiful!--and the earth a green garden, <\p> 
<p> blossoming with many-colored delights.  Thus Nature, whose laws I had <\p> 
<p> broken in various artificial ways, comported herself towards me as a <\p> 
<p> strict but loving mother, who uses the rod upon her little boy for his <\p> 
<p> naughtiness, and then gives him a smile, a kiss, and some pretty <\p> 
<p> playthings to console the urchin for her severity. <\p> 

<p> In the interval of my seclusion, there had been a number of recruits to <\p> 
<p> our little army of saints and martyrs.  They were mostly individuals <\p> 
<p> who had gone through such an experience as to disgust them with <\p> 
<p> ordinary pursuits, but who were not yet so old, nor had suffered so <\p> 
<p> deeply, as to lose their faith in the better time to come. On comparing <\p> 
<p> their minds one with another they often discovered that this idea of a <\p> 
<p> Community had been growing up, in silent and unknown sympathy, for <\p> 
<p> years.  Thoughtful, strongly lined faces were among them; sombre brows, <\p> 
<p> but eyes that did not require spectacles, unless prematurely dimmed by <\p> 
<p> the student's lamplight, and hair that seldom showed a thread of <\p> 
<p> silver.  Age, wedded to the past, incrusted over with a stony layer of <\p> 
<p> habits, and retaining nothing fluid in its possibilities, would have <\p> 
<p> been absurdly out of place in an enterprise like this.  Youth, too, in <\p> 
<p> its early dawn, was hardly more adapted to our purpose; for it would <\p> 
<p> behold the morning radiance of its own spirit beaming over the very <\p> 
<p> same spots of withered grass and barren sand whence most of us had seen <\p> 
<p> it vanish.  We had very young people with us, it is true,--downy lads, <\p> 
<p> rosy girls in their first teens, and children of all heights above <\p> 
<p> one's knee; but these had chiefly been sent hither for education, which <\p> 
<p> it was one of the objects and methods of our institution to supply. <\p> 
<p> Then we had boarders, from town and elsewhere, who lived with us in a <\p> 
<p> familiar way, sympathized more or less in our theories, and sometimes <\p> 
<p> shared in our labors. <\p> 

<p> On the whole, it was a society such as has seldom met together; nor, <\p> 
<p> perhaps, could it reasonably be expected to hold together long. Persons <\p> 
<p> of marked individuality--crooked sticks, as some of us might be <\p> 
<p> called--are not exactly the easiest to bind up into a fagot.  But, so <\p> 
<p> long as our union should subsist, a man of intellect and feeling, with <\p> 
<p> a free nature in him, might have sought far and near without finding so <\p> 
<p> many points of attraction as would allure him hitherward. We were of <\p> 
<p> all creeds and opinions, and generally tolerant of all, on every <\p> 
<p> imaginable subject.  Our bond, it seems to me, was not affirmative, but <\p> 
<p> negative.  We had individually found one thing or another to quarrel <\p> 
<p> with in our past life, and were pretty well agreed as to the <\p> 
<p> inexpediency of lumbering along with the old system any further.  As to <\p> 
<p> what should be substituted, there was much less unanimity.  We did not <\p> 
<p> greatly care--at least, I never did--for the written constitution under <\p> 
<p> which our millennium had commenced.  My hope was, that, between theory <\p> 
<p> and practice, a true and available mode of life might be struck out; <\p> 
<p> and that, even should we ultimately fail, the months or years spent in <\p> 
<p> the trial would not have been wasted, either as regarded passing <\p> 
<p> enjoyment, or the experience which makes men wise. <\p> 

<p> Arcadians though we were, our costume bore no resemblance to the <\p> 
<p> beribboned doublets, silk breeches and stockings, and slippers fastened <\p> 
<p> with artificial roses, that distinguish the pastoral people of poetry <\p> 
<p> and the stage.  In outward show, I humbly conceive, we looked rather <\p> 
<p> like a gang of beggars, or banditti, than either a company of honest <\p> 
<p> laboring-men, or a conclave of philosophers. Whatever might be our <\p> 
<p> points of difference, we all of us seemed to have come to Blithedale <\p> 
<p> with the one thrifty and laudable idea of wearing out our old clothes. <\p> 
<p> Such garments as had an airing, whenever we strode afield!  Coats with <\p> 
<p> high collars and with no collars, broad-skirted or swallow-tailed, and <\p> 
<p> with the waist at every point between the hip and arm-pit; pantaloons <\p> 
<p> of a dozen successive epochs, and greatly defaced at the knees by the <\p> 
<p> humiliations of the wearer before his lady-love,--in short, we were a <\p> 
<p> living epitome of defunct fashions, and the very raggedest presentment <\p> 
<p> of men who had seen better days.  It was gentility in tatters.  Often <\p> 
<p> retaining a scholarlike or clerical air, you might have taken us for <\p> 
<p> the denizens of Grub Street, intent on getting a comfortable livelihood <\p> 
<p> by agricultural labor; or Coleridge's projected Pantisocracy in full <\p> 
<p> experiment; or Candide and his motley associates at work in their <\p> 
<p> cabbage garden; or anything else that was miserably out at elbows, and <\p> 
<p> most clumsily patched in the rear.  We might have been sworn comrades <\p> 
<p> to Falstaff's ragged regiment.  Little skill as we boasted in other <\p> 
<p> points of husbandry, every mother's son of us would have served <\p> 
<p> admirably to stick up for a scarecrow.  And the worst of the matter <\p> 
<p> was, that the first energetic movement essential to one downright <\p> 
<p> stroke of real labor was sure to put a finish to these poor <\p> 
<p> habiliments.  So we gradually flung them all aside, and took to honest <\p> 
<p> homespun and linsey-woolsey, as preferable, on the whole, to the plan <\p> 
<p> recommended, I think, by Virgil,--"Ara nudus; sere nudus, "--which as <\p> 
<p> Silas Foster remarked, when I translated the maxim, would be apt to <\p> 
<p> astonish the women-folks. <\p> 

<p> After a reasonable training, the yeoman life throve well with us. Our <\p> 
<p> faces took the sunburn kindly; our chests gained in compass, and our <\p> 
<p> shoulders in breadth and squareness; our great brown fists looked as if <\p> 
<p> they had never been capable of kid gloves.  The plough, the hoe, the <\p> 
<p> scythe, and the hay-fork grew familiar to our grasp.  The oxen <\p> 
<p> responded to our voices.  We could do almost as fair a day's work as <\p> 
<p> Silas Foster himself, sleep dreamlessly after it, and awake at daybreak <\p> 
<p> with only a little stiffness of the joints, which was usually quite <\p> 
<p> gone by breakfast-time. <\p> 

<p> To be sure, our next neighbors pretended to be incredulous as to our <\p> 
<p> real proficiency in the business which we had taken in hand.  They told <\p> 
<p> slanderous fables about our inability to yoke our own oxen, or to drive <\p> 
<p> them afield when yoked, or to release the poor brutes from their <\p> 
<p> conjugal bond at nightfall.  They had the face to say, too, that the <\p> 
<p> cows laughed at our awkwardness at milking-time, and invariably kicked <\p> 
<p> over the pails; partly in consequence of our putting the stool on the <\p> 
<p> wrong side, and partly because, taking offence at the whisking of their <\p> 
<p> tails, we were in the habit of holding these natural fly-flappers with <\p> 
<p> one hand and milking with the other.  They further averred that we hoed <\p> 
<p> up whole acres of Indian corn and other crops, and drew the earth <\p> 
<p> carefully about the weeds; and that we raised five hundred tufts of <\p> 
<p> burdock, mistaking them for cabbages; and that by dint of unskilful <\p> 
<p> planting few of our seeds ever came up at all, or, if they did come up, <\p> 
<p> it was stern-foremost; and that we spent the better part of the month <\p> 
<p> of June in reversing a field of beans, which had thrust themselves out <\p> 
<p> of the ground in this unseemly way.  They quoted it as nothing more <\p> 
<p> than an ordinary occurrence for one or other of us to crop off two or <\p> 
<p> three fingers, of a morning, by our clumsy use of the hay-cutter. <\p> 
<p> Finally, and as an ultimate catastrophe, these mendacious rogues <\p> 
<p> circulated a report that we communitarians were exterminated, to the <\p> 
<p> last man, by severing ourselves asunder with the sweep of our own <\p> 
<p> scythes! and that the world had lost nothing by this little accident. <\p> 

<p> But this was pure envy and malice on the part of the neighboring <\p> 
<p> farmers.  The peril of our new way of life was not lest we should fail <\p> 
<p> in becoming practical agriculturists, but that we should probably cease <\p> 
<p> to be anything else.  While our enterprise lay all in theory, we had <\p> 
<p> pleased ourselves with delectable visions of the spiritualization of <\p> 
<p> labor.  It was to be our form of prayer and ceremonial of worship. <\p> 
<p> Each stroke of the hoe was to uncover some aromatic root of wisdom, <\p> 
<p> heretofore hidden from the sun.  Pausing in the field, to let the wind <\p> 
<p> exhale the moisture from our foreheads, we were to look upward, and <\p> 
<p> catch glimpses into the far-off soul of truth.  In this point of view, <\p> 
<p> matters did not turn out quite so well as we anticipated.  It is very <\p> 
<p> true that, sometimes, gazing casually around me, out of the midst of my <\p> 
<p> toil, I used to discern a richer picturesqueness in the visible scene <\p> 
<p> of earth and sky.  There was, at such moments, a novelty, an unwonted <\p> 
<p> aspect, on the face of Nature, as if she had been taken by surprise and <\p> 
<p> seen at unawares, with no opportunity to put off her real look, and <\p> 
<p> assume the mask with which she mysteriously hides herself from mortals. <\p> 
<p> But this was all.  The clods of earth, which we so constantly belabored <\p> 
<p> and turned over and over, were never etherealized into thought.  Our <\p> 
<p> thoughts, on the contrary, were fast becoming cloddish.  Our labor <\p> 
<p> symbolized nothing, and left us mentally sluggish in the dusk of the <\p> 
<p> evening. Intellectual activity is incompatible with any large amount of <\p> 
<p> bodily exercise.  The yeoman and the scholar--the yeoman and the man of <\p> 
<p> finest moral culture, though not the man of sturdiest sense and <\p> 
<p> integrity--are two distinct individuals, and can never be melted or <\p> 
<p> welded into one substance. <\p> 

<p> Zenobia soon saw this truth, and gibed me about it, one evening, as <\p> 
<p> Hollingsworth and I lay on the grass, after a hard day's work. <\p> 

<p> "I am afraid you did not make a song today, while loading the <\p> 
<p> hay-cart," said she, "as Burns did, when he was reaping barley." <\p> 

<p> "Burns never made a song in haying-time," I answered very positively. <\p> 
<p> "He was no poet while a farmer, and no farmer while a poet." <\p> 

<p> "And on the whole, which of the two characters do you like best?" asked <\p> 
<p> Zenobia.  "For I have an idea that you cannot combine them any better <\p> 
<p> than Burns did.  Ah, I see, in my mind's eye, what sort of an <\p> 
<p> individual you are to be, two or three years hence.  Grim Silas Foster <\p> 
<p> is your prototype, with his palm of sole-leather, and his joints of <\p> 
<p> rusty iron (which all through summer keep the stiffness of what he <\p> 
<p> calls his winter's rheumatize), and his brain of--I don't know what his <\p> 
<p> brain is made of, unless it be a Savoy cabbage; but yours may be <\p> 
<p> cauliflower, as a rather more delicate variety.  Your physical man will <\p> 
<p> be transmuted into salt beef and fried pork, at the rate, I should <\p> 
<p> imagine, of a pound and a half a day; that being about the average <\p> 
<p> which we find necessary in the kitchen.  You will make your toilet for <\p> 
<p> the day (still like this delightful Silas Foster) by rinsing your <\p> 
<p> fingers and the front part of your face in a little tin pan of water at <\p> 
<p> the doorstep, and teasing your hair with a wooden pocket-comb before a <\p> 
<p> seven-by-nine-inch looking-glass.  Your only pastime will be to smoke <\p> 
<p> some very vile tobacco in the black stump of a pipe." <\p> 

<p> "Pray, spare me!" cried I. "But the pipe is not Silas's only mode of <\p> 
<p> solacing himself with the weed." <\p> 

<p> "Your literature," continued Zenobia, apparently delighted with her <\p> 
<p> description, "will be the 'Farmer's Almanac;' for I observe our friend <\p> 
<p> Foster never gets so far as the newspaper.  When you happen to sit <\p> 
<p> down, at odd moments, you will fall asleep, and make nasal proclamation <\p> 
<p> of the fact, as he does; and invariably you must be jogged out of a <\p> 
<p> nap, after supper, by the future Mrs. Coverdale, and persuaded to go <\p> 
<p> regularly to bed.  And on Sundays, when you put on a blue coat with <\p> 
<p> brass buttons, you will think of nothing else to do but to go and <\p> 
<p> lounge over the stone walls and rail fences, and stare at the corn <\p> 
<p> growing.  And you will look with a knowing eye at oxen, and will have a <\p> 
<p> tendency to clamber over into pigsties, and feel of the hogs, and give <\p> 
<p> a guess how much they will weigh after you shall have stuck and dressed <\p> 
<p> them.  Already I have noticed you begin to speak through your nose, and <\p> 
<p> with a drawl.  Pray, if you really did make any poetry to-day, let us <\p> 
<p> hear it in that kind of utterance!" <\p> 

<p> "Coverdale has given up making verses now," said Hollingsworth, who <\p> 
<p> never had the slightest appreciation of my poetry.  "Just think of him <\p> 
<p> penning a sonnet with a fist like that!  There is at least this good in <\p> 
<p> a life of toil, that it takes the nonsense and fancy-work out of a man, <\p> 
<p> and leaves nothing but what truly belongs to him.  If a farmer can make <\p> 
<p> poetry at the plough-tail, it must be because his nature insists on it; <\p> 
<p> and if that be the case, let him make it, in Heaven's name!" <\p> 

<p> "And how is it with you?" asked Zenobia, in a different voice; for she <\p> 
<p> never laughed at Hollingsworth, as she often did at me.  "You, I think, <\p> 
<p> cannot have ceased to live a life of thought and feeling." <\p> 

<p> "I have always been in earnest," answered Hollingsworth.  "I have <\p> 
<p> hammered thought out of iron, after heating the iron in my heart!  It <\p> 
<p> matters little what my outward toil may be.  Were I a slave, at the <\p> 
<p> bottom of a mine, I should keep the same purpose, the same faith in its <\p> 
<p> ultimate accomplishment, that I do now.  Miles Coverdale is not in <\p> 
<p> earnest, either as a poet or a laborer." <\p> 

<p> "You give me hard measure, Hollingsworth," said I, a little hurt.  "I <\p> 
<p> have kept pace with you in the field; and my bones feel as if I had <\p> 
<p> been in earnest, whatever may be the case with my brain!" <\p> 

<p> "I cannot conceive," observed Zenobia with great emphasis,--and, no <\p> 
<p> doubt, she spoke fairly the feeling of the moment,--"I cannot conceive <\p> 
<p> of being so continually as Mr. Coverdale is within the sphere of a <\p> 
<p> strong and noble nature, without being strengthened and ennobled by its <\p> 
<p> influence!" <\p> 

<p> This amiable remark of the fair Zenobia confirmed me in what I had <\p> 
<p> already begun to suspect, that Hollingsworth, like many other <\p> 
<p> illustrious prophets, reformers, and philanthropists, was likely to <\p> 
<p> make at least two proselytes among the women to one among the men. <\p> 
<p> Zenobia and Priscilla!  These, I believe (unless my unworthy self might <\p> 
<p> be reckoned for a third), were the only disciples of his mission; and I <\p> 
<p> spent a great deal of time, uselessly, in trying to conjecture what <\p> 
<p> Hollingsworth meant to do with them--and they with him! <\p> 

<p> IX. HOLLINGSWORTH, ZENOBIA, PRISCILLA <\p> 

<p> It is not, I apprehend, a healthy kind of mental occupation to devote <\p> 
<p> ourselves too exclusively to the study of individual men and women. If <\p> 
<p> the person under examination be one's self, the result is pretty <\p> 
<p> certain to be diseased action of the heart, almost before we can snatch <\p> 
<p> a second glance.  Or if we take the freedom to put a friend under our <\p> 
<p> microscope, we thereby insulate him from many of his true relations, <\p> 
<p> magnify his peculiarities, inevitably tear him into parts, and of <\p> 
<p> course patch him very clumsily together again.  What wonder, then, <\p> 
<p> should we be frightened by the aspect of a monster, which, after <\p> 
<p> all,--though we can point to every feature of his deformity in the real <\p> 
<p> personage,--may be said to have been created mainly by ourselves. <\p> 

<p> Thus, as my conscience has often whispered me, I did Hollingsworth a <\p> 
<p> great wrong by prying into his character; and am perhaps doing him as <\p> 
<p> great a one, at this moment, by putting faith in the discoveries which <\p> 
<p> I seemed to make.  But I could not help it.  Had I loved him less, I <\p> 
<p> might have used him better.  He and Zenobia and Priscilla--both for <\p> 
<p> their own sakes and as connected with him--were separated from the rest <\p> 
<p> of the Community, to my imagination, and stood forth as the indices of <\p> 
<p> a problem which it was my business to solve.  Other associates had a <\p> 
<p> portion of my time; other matters amused me; passing occurrences <\p> 
<p> carried me along with them, while they lasted.  But here was the vortex <\p> 
<p> of my meditations, around which they revolved, and whitherward they too <\p> 
<p> continually tended.  In the midst of cheerful society, I had often a <\p> 
<p> feeling of loneliness.  For it was impossible not to be sensible that, <\p> 
<p> while these three characters figured so largely on my private theatre, <\p> 
<p> I--though probably reckoned as a friend by all--was at best but a <\p> 
<p> secondary or tertiary personage with either of them. <\p> 

<p> I loved Hollingsworth, as has already been enough expressed.  But it <\p> 
<p> impressed me, more and more, that there was a stern and dreadful <\p> 
<p> peculiarity in this man, such as could not prove otherwise than <\p> 
<p> pernicious to the happiness of those who should be drawn into too <\p> 
<p> intimate a connection with him.  He was not altogether human.  There <\p> 
<p> was something else in Hollingsworth besides flesh and blood, and <\p> 
<p> sympathies and affections and celestial spirit. <\p> 

<p> This is always true of those men who have surrendered themselves to an <\p> 
<p> overruling purpose.  It does not so much impel them from without, nor <\p> 
<p> even operate as a motive power within, but grows incorporate with all <\p> 
<p> that they think and feel, and finally converts them into little else <\p> 
<p> save that one principle.  When such begins to be the predicament, it is <\p> 
<p> not cowardice, but wisdom, to avoid these victims.  They have no heart, <\p> 
<p> no sympathy, no reason, no conscience.  They will keep no friend, <\p> 
<p> unless he make himself the mirror of their purpose; they will smite and <\p> 
<p> slay you, and trample your dead corpse under foot, all the more <\p> 
<p> readily, if you take the first step with them, and cannot take the <\p> 
<p> second, and the third, and every other step of their terribly strait <\p> 
<p> path.  They have an idol to which they consecrate themselves <\p> 
<p> high-priest, and deem it holy work to offer sacrifices of whatever is <\p> 
<p> most precious; and never once seem to suspect--so cunning has the Devil <\p> 
<p> been with them--that this false deity, in whose iron features, <\p> 
<p> immitigable to all the rest of mankind, they see only benignity and <\p> 
<p> love, is but a spectrum of the very priest himself, projected upon the <\p> 
<p> surrounding darkness.  And the higher and purer the original object, <\p> 
<p> and the more unselfishly it may have been taken up, the slighter is the <\p> 
<p> probability that they can be led to recognize the process by which <\p> 
<p> godlike benevolence has been debased into all-devouring egotism. <\p> 

<p> Of course I am perfectly aware that the above statement is exaggerated, <\p> 
<p> in the attempt to make it adequate.  Professed philanthropists have <\p> 
<p> gone far; but no originally good man, I presume, ever went quite so far <\p> 
<p> as this.  Let the reader abate whatever he deems fit.  The paragraph <\p> 
<p> may remain, however, both for its truth and its exaggeration, as <\p> 
<p> strongly expressive of the tendencies which were really operative in <\p> 
<p> Hollingsworth, and as exemplifying the kind of error into which my mode <\p> 
<p> of observation was calculated to lead me. The issue was, that in <\p> 
<p> solitude I often shuddered at my friend.  In my recollection of his <\p> 
<p> dark and impressive countenance, the features grew more sternly <\p> 
<p> prominent than the reality, duskier in their depth and shadow, and more <\p> 
<p> lurid in their light; the frown, that had merely flitted across his <\p> 
<p> brow, seemed to have contorted it with an adamantine wrinkle.  On <\p> 
<p> meeting him again, I was often filled with remorse, when his deep eyes <\p> 
<p> beamed kindly upon me, as with the glow of a household fire that was <\p> 
<p> burning in a cave.  "He is a man after all," thought I; "his Maker's <\p> 
<p> own truest image, a philanthropic man!--not that steel engine of the <\p> 
<p> Devil's contrivance, a philanthropist!" But in my wood-walks, and in my <\p> 
<p> silent chamber, the dark face frowned at me again. <\p> 

<p> When a young girl comes within the sphere of such a man, she is as <\p> 
<p> perilously situated as the maiden whom, in the old classical myths, the <\p> 
<p> people used to expose to a dragon.  If I had any duty whatever, in <\p> 
<p> reference to Hollingsworth, it was to endeavor to save Priscilla from <\p> 
<p> that kind of personal worship which her sex is generally prone to <\p> 
<p> lavish upon saints and heroes.  It often requires but one smile out of <\p> 
<p> the hero's eyes into the girl's or woman's heart, to transform this <\p> 
<p> devotion, from a sentiment of the highest approval and confidence, into <\p> 
<p> passionate love.  Now, Hollingsworth smiled much upon Priscilla,--more <\p> 
<p> than upon any other person.  If she thought him beautiful, it was no <\p> 
<p> wonder.  I often thought him so, with the expression of tender human <\p> 
<p> care and gentlest sympathy which she alone seemed to have power to call <\p> 
<p> out upon his features.  Zenobia, I suspect, would have given her eyes, <\p> 
<p> bright as they were, for such a look; it was the least that our poor <\p> 
<p> Priscilla could do, to give her heart for a great many of them.  There <\p> 
<p> was the more danger of this, inasmuch as the footing on which we all <\p> 
<p> associated at Blithedale was widely different from that of conventional <\p> 
<p> society.  While inclining us to the soft affections of the golden age, <\p> 
<p> it seemed to authorize any individual, of either sex, to fall in love <\p> 
<p> with any other, regardless of what would elsewhere be judged suitable <\p> 
<p> and prudent. Accordingly the tender passion was very rife among us, in <\p> 
<p> various degrees of mildness or virulence, but mostly passing away with <\p> 
<p> the state of things that had given it origin.  This was all well <\p> 
<p> enough; but, for a girl like Priscilla and a woman like Zenobia to <\p> 
<p> jostle one another in their love of a man like Hollingsworth, was <\p> 
<p> likely to be no child's play. <\p> 

<p> Had I been as cold-hearted as I sometimes thought myself, nothing would <\p> 
<p> have interested me more than to witness the play of passions that must <\p> 
<p> thus have been evolved.  But, in honest truth, I would really have gone <\p> 
<p> far to save Priscilla, at least, from the catastrophe in which such a <\p> 
<p> drama would be apt to terminate. <\p> 

<p> Priscilla had now grown to be a very pretty girl, and still kept <\p> 
<p> budding and blossoming, and daily putting on some new charm, which you <\p> 
<p> no sooner became sensible of than you thought it worth all that she had <\p> 
<p> previously possessed.  So unformed, vague, and without substance, as <\p> 
<p> she had come to us, it seemed as if we could see Nature shaping out a <\p> 
<p> woman before our very eyes, and yet had only a more reverential sense <\p> 
<p> of the mystery of a woman's soul and frame. Yesterday, her cheek was <\p> 
<p> pale, to-day, it had a bloom.  Priscilla's smile, like a baby's first <\p> 
<p> one, was a wondrous novelty.  Her imperfections and shortcomings <\p> 
<p> affected me with a kind of playful pathos, which was as absolutely <\p> 
<p> bewitching a sensation as ever I experienced.  After she had been a <\p> 
<p> month or two at Blithedale, her animal spirits waxed high, and kept her <\p> 
<p> pretty constantly in a state of bubble and ferment, impelling her to <\p> 
<p> far more bodily activity than she had yet strength to endure.  She was <\p> 
<p> very fond of playing with the other girls out of doors.  There is <\p> 
<p> hardly another sight in the world so pretty as that of a company of <\p> 
<p> young girls, almost women grown, at play, and so giving themselves up <\p> 
<p> to their airy impulse that their tiptoes barely touch the ground. <\p> 

<p> Girls are incomparably wilder and more effervescent than boys, more <\p> 
<p> untamable and regardless of rule and limit, with an ever-shifting <\p> 
<p> variety, breaking continually into new modes of fun, yet with a <\p> 
<p> harmonious propriety through all.  Their steps, their voices, appear <\p> 
<p> free as the wind, but keep consonance with a strain of music inaudible <\p> 
<p> to us.  Young men and boys, on the other hand, play, according to <\p> 
<p> recognized law, old, traditionary games, permitting no caprioles of <\p> 
<p> fancy, but with scope enough for the outbreak of savage instincts. <\p> 
<p> For, young or old, in play or in earnest, man is prone to be a brute. <\p> 

<p> Especially is it delightful to see a vigorous young girl run a race, <\p> 
<p> with her head thrown back, her limbs moving more friskily than they <\p> 
<p> need, and an air between that of a bird and a young colt.  But <\p> 
<p> Priscilla's peculiar charm, in a foot-race, was the weakness and <\p> 
<p> irregularity with which she ran.  Growing up without exercise, except <\p> 
<p> to her poor little fingers, she had never yet acquired the perfect use <\p> 
<p> of her legs.  Setting buoyantly forth, therefore, as if no rival less <\p> 
<p> swift than Atalanta could compete with her, she ran falteringly, and <\p> 
<p> often tumbled on the grass.  Such an incident--though it seems too <\p> 
<p> slight to think of--was a thing to laugh at, but which brought the <\p> 
<p> water into one's eyes, and lingered in the memory after far greater <\p> 
<p> joys and sorrows were wept out of it, as antiquated trash. Priscilla's <\p> 
<p> life, as I beheld it, was full of trifles that affected me in just this <\p> 
<p> way. <\p> 

<p> When she had come to be quite at home among us, I used to fancy that <\p> 
<p> Priscilla played more pranks, and perpetrated more mischief, than any <\p> 
<p> other girl in the Community.  For example, I once heard Silas Foster, <\p> 
<p> in a very gruff voice, threatening to rivet three horseshoes round <\p> 
<p> Priscilla's neck and chain her to a post, because she, with some other <\p> 
<p> young people, had clambered upon a load of hay, and caused it to slide <\p> 
<p> off the cart.  How she made her peace I never knew; but very soon <\p> 
<p> afterwards I saw old Silas, with his brawny hands round Priscilla's <\p> 
<p> waist, swinging her to and fro, and finally depositing her on one of <\p> 
<p> the oxen, to take her first lessons in riding.  She met with terrible <\p> 
<p> mishaps in her efforts to milk a cow; she let the poultry into the <\p> 
<p> garden; she generally spoilt whatever part of the dinner she took in <\p> 
<p> charge; she broke crockery; she dropt our biggest water pitcher into <\p> 
<p> the well; and--except with her needle, and those little wooden <\p> 
<p> instruments for purse-making--was as unserviceable a member of society <\p> 
<p> as any young lady in the land.  There was no other sort of efficiency <\p> 
<p> about her.  Yet everybody was kind to Priscilla; everybody loved her <\p> 
<p> and laughed at her to her face, and did not laugh behind her back; <\p> 
<p> everybody would have given her half of his last crust, or the bigger <\p> 
<p> share of his plum-cake.  These were pretty certain indications that we <\p> 
<p> were all conscious of a pleasant weakness in the girl, and considered <\p> 
<p> her not quite able to look after her own interests or fight her battle <\p> 
<p> with the world.  And Hollingsworth--perhaps because he had been the <\p> 
<p> means of introducing Priscilla to her new abode--appeared to recognize <\p> 
<p> her as his own especial charge. <\p> 

<p> Her simple, careless, childish flow of spirits often made me sad. She <\p> 
<p> seemed to me like a butterfly at play in a flickering bit of sunshine, <\p> 
<p> and mistaking it for a broad and eternal summer.  We sometimes hold <\p> 
<p> mirth to a stricter accountability than sorrow; it must show good <\p> 
<p> cause, or the echo of its laughter comes back drearily. Priscilla's <\p> 
<p> gayety, moreover, was of a nature that showed me how delicate an <\p> 
<p> instrument she was, and what fragile harp-strings were her nerves.  As <\p> 
<p> they made sweet music at the airiest touch, it would require but a <\p> 
<p> stronger one to burst them all asunder.  Absurd as it might be, I tried <\p> 
<p> to reason with her, and persuade her not to be so joyous, thinking <\p> 
<p> that, if she would draw less lavishly upon her fund of happiness, it <\p> 
<p> would last the longer.  I remember doing so, one summer evening, when <\p> 
<p> we tired laborers sat looking on, like Goldsmith's old folks under the <\p> 
<p> village thorn-tree, while the young people were at their sports. <\p> 

<p> "What is the use or sense of being so very gay?"  I said to Priscilla, <\p> 
<p> while she was taking breath, after a great frolic.  "I love to see a <\p> 
<p> sufficient cause for everything, and I can see none for this.  Pray <\p> 
<p> tell me, now, what kind of a world you imagine this to be, which you <\p> 
<p> are so merry in." <\p> 

<p> "I never think about it at all," answered Priscilla, laughing.  "But <\p> 
<p> this I am sure of, that it is a world where everybody is kind to me, <\p> 
<p> and where I love everybody.  My heart keeps dancing within me, and all <\p> 
<p> the foolish things which you see me do are only the motions of my <\p> 
<p> heart.  How can I be dismal, if my heart will not let me?" <\p> 

<p> "Have you nothing dismal to remember?"  I suggested.  "If not, then, <\p> 
<p> indeed, you are very fortunate!" <\p> 

<p> "Ah!" said Priscilla slowly. <\p> 

<p> And then came that unintelligible gesture, when she seemed to be <\p> 
<p> listening to a distant voice. <\p> 

<p> "For my part," I continued, beneficently seeking to overshadow her with <\p> 
<p> my own sombre humor, "my past life has been a tiresome one enough; yet <\p> 
<p> I would rather look backward ten times than forward once. For, little <\p> 
<p> as we know of our life to come, we may be very sure, for one thing, <\p> 
<p> that the good we aim at will not be attained.  People never do get just <\p> 
<p> the good they seek.  If it come at all, it is something else, which <\p> 
<p> they never dreamed of, and did not particularly want.  Then, again, we <\p> 
<p> may rest certain that our friends of to-day will not be our friends of <\p> 
<p> a few years hence; but, if we keep one of them, it will be at the <\p> 
<p> expense of the others; and most probably we shall keep none.  To be <\p> 
<p> sure, there are more to be had; but who cares about making a new set of <\p> 
<p> friends, even should they be better than those around us?" <\p> 

<p> "Not I!" said Priscilla.  "I will live and die with these!" <\p> 

<p> "Well; but let the future go," resumed I. "As for the present moment, <\p> 
<p> if we could look into the hearts where we wish to be most valued, what <\p> 
<p> should you expect to see?  One's own likeness, in the innermost, <\p> 
<p> holiest niche?  Ah!  I don't know!  It may not be there at all.  It may <\p> 
<p> be a dusty image, thrust aside into a corner, and by and by to be flung <\p> 
<p> out of doors, where any foot may trample upon it.  If not to-day, then <\p> 
<p> to-morrow!  And so, Priscilla, I do not see much wisdom in being so <\p> 
<p> very merry in this kind of a world." <\p> 

<p> It had taken me nearly seven years of worldly life to hive up the <\p> 
<p> bitter honey which I here offered to Priscilla.  And she rejected it! <\p> 

<p> "I don't believe one word of what you say!" she replied, laughing anew. <\p> 
<p> "You made me sad, for a minute, by talking about the past; but the past <\p> 
<p> never comes back again.  Do we dream the same dream twice? There is <\p> 
<p> nothing else that I am afraid of." <\p> 

<p> So away she ran, and fell down on the green grass, as it was often her <\p> 
<p> luck to do, but got up again, without any harm. <\p> 

<p> "Priscilla, Priscilla!" cried Hollingsworth, who was sitting on the <\p> 
<p> doorstep; "you had better not run any more to-night.  You will weary <\p> 
<p> yourself too much.  And do not sit down out of doors, for there is a <\p> 
<p> heavy dew beginning to fall." <\p> 

<p> At his first word, she went and sat down under the porch, at <\p> 
<p> Hollingsworth's feet, entirely contented and happy.  What charm was <\p> 
<p> there in his rude massiveness that so attracted and soothed this <\p> 
<p> shadow-like girl?  It appeared to me, who have always been curious in <\p> 
<p> such matters, that Priscilla's vague and seemingly causeless flow of <\p> 
<p> felicitous feeling was that with which love blesses inexperienced <\p> 
<p> hearts, before they begin to suspect what is going on within them. It <\p> 
<p> transports them to the seventh heaven; and if you ask what brought them <\p> 
<p> thither, they neither can tell nor care to learn, but cherish an <\p> 
<p> ecstatic faith that there they shall abide forever. <\p> 

<p> Zenobia was in the doorway, not far from Hollingsworth.  She gazed at <\p> 
<p> Priscilla in a very singular way.  Indeed, it was a sight worth gazing <\p> 
<p> at, and a beautiful sight, too, as the fair girl sat at the feet of <\p> 
<p> that dark, powerful figure.  Her air, while perfectly modest, delicate, <\p> 
<p> and virgin-like, denoted her as swayed by Hollingsworth, attracted to <\p> 
<p> him, and unconsciously seeking to rest upon his strength. I could not <\p> 
<p> turn away my own eyes, but hoped that nobody, save Zenobia and myself, <\p> 
<p> was witnessing this picture.  It is before me now, with the evening <\p> 
<p> twilight a little deepened by the dusk of memory. <\p> 

<p> "Come hither, Priscilla," said Zenobia.  "I have something to say to <\p> 
<p> you." <\p> 

<p> She spoke in little more than a whisper.  But it is strange how <\p> 
<p> expressive of moods a whisper may often be.  Priscilla felt at once <\p> 
<p> that something had gone wrong. <\p> 

<p> "Are you angry with me?" she asked, rising slowly, and standing before <\p> 
<p> Zenobia in a drooping attitude.  "What have I done?  I hope you are not <\p> 
<p> angry!" <\p> 

<p> "No, no, Priscilla!" said Hollingsworth, smiling.  "I will answer for <\p> 
<p> it, she is not.  You are the one little person in the world with whom <\p> 
<p> nobody can be angry!" <\p> 

<p> "Angry with you, child?  What a silly idea!" exclaimed Zenobia, <\p> 
<p> laughing.  "No, indeed!  But, my dear Priscilla, you are getting to be <\p> 
<p> so very pretty that you absolutely need a duenna; and, as I am older <\p> 
<p> than you, and have had my own little experience of life, and think <\p> 
<p> myself exceedingly sage, I intend to fill the place of a maiden aunt. <\p> 
<p> Every day, I shall give you a lecture, a quarter of an hour in length, <\p> 
<p> on the morals, manners, and proprieties of social life.  When our <\p> 
<p> pastoral shall be quite played out, Priscilla, my worldly wisdom may <\p> 
<p> stand you in good stead." <\p> 

<p> "I am afraid you are angry with me!" repeated Priscilla sadly; for, <\p> 
<p> while she seemed as impressible as wax, the girl often showed a <\p> 
<p> persistency in her own ideas as stubborn as it was gentle. <\p> 

<p> "Dear me, what can I say to the child!" cried Zenobia in a tone of <\p> 
<p> humorous vexation.  "Well, well; since you insist on my being angry, <\p> 
<p> come to my room this moment, and let me beat you!" <\p> 

<p> Zenobia bade Hollingsworth good-night very sweetly, and nodded to me <\p> 
<p> with a smile.  But, just as she turned aside with Priscilla into the <\p> 
<p> dimness of the porch, I caught another glance at her countenance.  It <\p> 
<p> would have made the fortune of a tragic actress, could she have <\p> 
<p> borrowed it for the moment when she fumbles in her bosom for the <\p> 
<p> concealed dagger, or the exceedingly sharp bodkin, or mingles the <\p> 
<p> ratsbane in her lover's bowl of wine or her rival's cup of tea.  Not <\p> 
<p> that I in the least anticipated any such catastrophe,--it being a <\p> 
<p> remarkable truth that custom has in no one point a greater sway than <\p> 
<p> over our modes of wreaking our wild passions.  And besides, had we been <\p> 
<p> in Italy, instead of New England, it was hardly yet a crisis for the <\p> 
<p> dagger or the bowl. <\p> 

<p> It often amazed me, however, that Hollingsworth should show himself so <\p> 
<p> recklessly tender towards Priscilla, and never once seem to think of <\p> 
<p> the effect which it might have upon her heart.  But the man, as I have <\p> 
<p> endeavored to explain, was thrown completely off his moral balance, and <\p> 
<p> quite bewildered as to his personal relations, by his great excrescence <\p> 
<p> of a philanthropic scheme.  I used to see, or fancy, indications that <\p> 
<p> he was not altogether obtuse to Zenobia's influence as a woman.  No <\p> 
<p> doubt, however, he had a still more exquisite enjoyment of Priscilla's <\p> 
<p> silent sympathy with his purposes, so unalloyed with criticism, and <\p> 
<p> therefore more grateful than any intellectual approbation, which always <\p> 
<p> involves a possible reserve of latent censure.  A man--poet, prophet, <\p> 
<p> or whatever he may be--readily persuades himself of his right to all <\p> 
<p> the worship that is voluntarily tendered.  In requital of so rich <\p> 
<p> benefits as he was to confer upon mankind, it would have been hard to <\p> 
<p> deny Hollingsworth the simple solace of a young girl's heart, which he <\p> 
<p> held in his hand, and smelled too, like a rosebud.  But what if, while <\p> 
<p> pressing out its fragrance, he should crush the tender rosebud in his <\p> 
<p> grasp! <\p> 

<p> As for Zenobia, I saw no occasion to give myself any trouble.  With her <\p> 
<p> native strength, and her experience of the world, she could not be <\p> 
<p> supposed to need any help of mine.  Nevertheless, I was really generous <\p> 
<p> enough to feel some little interest likewise for Zenobia. With all her <\p> 
<p> faults (which might have been a great many besides the abundance that I <\p> 
<p> knew of), she possessed noble traits, and a heart which must, at least, <\p> 
<p> have been valuable while new.  And she seemed ready to fling it away as <\p> 
<p> uncalculatingly as Priscilla herself.  I could not but suspect that, if <\p> 
<p> merely at play with Hollingsworth, she was sporting with a power which <\p> 
<p> she did not fully estimate.  Or if in earnest, it might chance, between <\p> 
<p> Zenobia's passionate force and his dark, self-delusive egotism, to turn <\p> 
<p> out such earnest as would develop itself in some sufficiently tragic <\p> 
<p> catastrophe, though the dagger and the bowl should go for nothing in it. <\p> 

<p> Meantime, the gossip of the Community set them down as a pair of <\p> 
<p> lovers.  They took walks together, and were not seldom encountered in <\p> 
<p> the wood-paths: Hollingsworth deeply discoursing, in tones solemn and <\p> 
<p> sternly pathetic; Zenobia, with a rich glow on her cheeks, and her eyes <\p> 
<p> softened from their ordinary brightness, looked so beautiful, that had <\p> 
<p> her companion been ten times a philanthropist, it seemed impossible but <\p> 
<p> that one glance should melt him back into a man. Oftener than anywhere <\p> 
<p> else, they went to a certain point on the slope of a pasture, <\p> 
<p> commanding nearly the whole of our own domain, besides a view of the <\p> 
<p> river, and an airy prospect of many distant hills.  The bond of our <\p> 
<p> Community was such, that the members had the privilege of building <\p> 
<p> cottages for their own residence within our precincts, thus laying a <\p> 
<p> hearthstone and fencing in a home private and peculiar to all desirable <\p> 
<p> extent, while yet the inhabitants should continue to share the <\p> 
<p> advantages of an associated life.  It was inferred that Hollingsworth <\p> 
<p> and Zenobia intended to rear their dwelling on this favorite spot. <\p> 

<p> I mentioned those rumors to Hollingsworth in a playful way. <\p> 

<p> "Had you consulted me," I went on to observe, "I should have <\p> 
<p> recommended a site farther to the left, just a little withdrawn into <\p> 
<p> the wood, with two or three peeps at the prospect among the trees. You <\p> 
<p> will be in the shady vale of years long before you can raise any better <\p> 
<p> kind of shade around your cottage, if you build it on this bare slope." <\p> 

<p> "But I offer my edifice as a spectacle to the world," said <\p> 
<p> Hollingsworth, "that it may take example and build many another like <\p> 
<p> it.  Therefore, I mean to set it on the open hillside." <\p> 

<p> Twist these words how I might, they offered no very satisfactory <\p> 
<p> import.  It seemed hardly probable that Hollingsworth should care about <\p> 
<p> educating the public taste in the department of cottage architecture, <\p> 
<p> desirable as such improvement certainly was. <\p> 

<p> X. A VISITOR FROM TOWN <\p> 

<p> Hollingsworth and I--we had been hoeing potatoes, that forenoon, while <\p> 
<p> the rest of the fraternity were engaged in a distant quarter of the <\p> 
<p> farm--sat under a clump of maples, eating our eleven o'clock lunch, <\p> 
<p> when we saw a stranger approaching along the edge of the field. He had <\p> 
<p> admitted himself from the roadside through a turnstile, and seemed to <\p> 
<p> have a purpose of speaking with us. <\p> 

<p> And, by the bye, we were favored with many visits at Blithedale, <\p> 
<p> especially from people who sympathized with our theories, and perhaps <\p> 
<p> held themselves ready to unite in our actual experiment as soon as <\p> 
<p> there should appear a reliable promise of its success.  It was rather <\p> 
<p> ludicrous, indeed (to me, at least, whose enthusiasm had insensibly <\p> 
<p> been exhaled together with the perspiration of many a hard day's toil), <\p> 
<p> it was absolutely funny, therefore, to observe what a glory was shed <\p> 
<p> about our life and labors, in the imaginations of these longing <\p> 
<p> proselytes.  In their view, we were as poetical as Arcadians, besides <\p> 
<p> being as practical as the hardest-fisted husbandmen in Massachusetts. <\p> 
<p> We did not, it is true, spend much time in piping to our sheep, or <\p> 
<p> warbling our innocent loves to the sisterhood.  But they gave us credit <\p> 
<p> for imbuing the ordinary rustic occupations with a kind of religious <\p> 
<p> poetry, insomuch that our very cow-yards and pig-sties were as <\p> 
<p> delightfully fragrant as a flower garden.  Nothing used to please me <\p> 
<p> more than to see one of these lay enthusiasts snatch up a hoe, as they <\p> 
<p> were very prone to do, and set to work with a vigor that perhaps <\p> 
<p> carried him through about a dozen ill-directed strokes.  Men are <\p> 
<p> wonderfully soon satisfied, in this day of shameful bodily enervation, <\p> 
<p> when, from one end of life to the other, such multitudes never taste <\p> 
<p> the sweet weariness that follows accustomed toil.  I seldom saw the new <\p> 
<p> enthusiasm that did not grow as flimsy and flaccid as the proselyte's <\p> 
<p> moistened shirt-collar, with a quarter of an hour's active labor under <\p> 
<p> a July sun. <\p> 

<p> But the person now at hand had not at all the air of one of these <\p> 
<p> amiable visionaries.  He was an elderly man, dressed rather shabbily, <\p> 
<p> yet decently enough, in a gray frock-coat, faded towards a brown hue, <\p> 
<p> and wore a broad-brimmed white hat, of the fashion of several years <\p> 
<p> gone by.  His hair was perfect silver, without a dark thread in the <\p> 
<p> whole of it; his nose, though it had a scarlet tip, by no means <\p> 
<p> indicated the jollity of which a red nose is the generally admitted <\p> 
<p> symbol.  He was a subdued, undemonstrative old man, who would doubtless <\p> 
<p> drink a glass of liquor, now and then, and probably more than was good <\p> 
<p> for him,--not, however, with a purpose of undue exhilaration, but in <\p> 
<p> the hope of bringing his spirits up to the ordinary level of the <\p> 
<p> world's cheerfulness.  Drawing nearer, there was a shy look about him, <\p> 
<p> as if he were ashamed of his poverty, or, at any rate, for some reason <\p> 
<p> or other, would rather have us glance at him sidelong than take a full <\p> 
<p> front view.  He had a queer appearance of hiding himself behind the <\p> 
<p> patch on his left eye. <\p> 

<p> "I know this old gentleman," said I to Hollingsworth, as we sat <\p> 
<p> observing him; "that is, I have met him a hundred times in town, and <\p> 
<p> have often amused my fancy with wondering what he was before he came to <\p> 
<p> be what he is.  He haunts restaurants and such places, and has an odd <\p> 
<p> way of lurking in corners or getting behind a door whenever <\p> 
<p> practicable, and holding out his hand with some little article in it <\p> 
<p> which he wishes you to buy.  The eye of the world seems to trouble him, <\p> 
<p> although he necessarily lives so much in it.  I never expected to see <\p> 
<p> him in an open field." <\p> 

<p> "Have you learned anything of his history?" asked Hollingsworth. <\p> 

<p> "Not a circumstance," I answered; "but there must be something curious <\p> 
<p> in it.  I take him to be a harmless sort of a person, and a tolerably <\p> 
<p> honest one; but his manners, being so furtive, remind me of those of a <\p> 
<p> rat,--a rat without the mischief, the fierce eye, the teeth to bite <\p> 
<p> with, or the desire to bite.  See, now!  He means to skulk along that <\p> 
<p> fringe of bushes, and approach us on the other side of our clump of <\p> 
<p> maples." <\p> 

<p> We soon heard the old man's velvet tread on the grass, indicating that <\p> 
<p> he had arrived within a few feet of where we Sat. <\p> 

<p> "Good-morning, Mr. Moodie," said Hollingsworth, addressing the stranger <\p> 
<p> as an acquaintance; "you must have had a hot and tiresome walk from the <\p> 
<p> city.  Sit down, and take a morsel of our bread and cheese." <\p> 

<p> The visitor made a grateful little murmur of acquiescence, and sat down <\p> 
<p> in a spot somewhat removed; so that, glancing round, I could see his <\p> 
<p> gray pantaloons and dusty shoes, while his upper part was mostly hidden <\p> 
<p> behind the shrubbery.  Nor did he come forth from this retirement <\p> 
<p> during the whole of the interview that followed.  We handed him such <\p> 
<p> food as we had, together with a brown jug of molasses and water (would <\p> 
<p> that it had been brandy, or some thing better, for the sake of his <\p> 
<p> chill old heart!), like priests offering dainty sacrifice to an <\p> 
<p> enshrined and invisible idol.  I have no idea that he really lacked <\p> 
<p> sustenance; but it was quite touching, nevertheless, to hear him <\p> 
<p> nibbling away at our crusts. <\p> 

<p> "Mr. Moodie," said I, "do you remember selling me one of those very <\p> 
<p> pretty little silk purses, of which you seem to have a monopoly in the <\p> 
<p> market?  I keep it to this day, I can assure you." <\p> 

<p> "Ah, thank you," said our guest.  "Yes, Mr. Coverdale, I used to sell a <\p> 
<p> good many of those little purses." <\p> 

<p> He spoke languidly, and only those few words, like a watch with an <\p> 
<p> inelastic spring, that just ticks a moment or two and stops again. He <\p> 
<p> seemed a very forlorn old man.  In the wantonness of youth, strength, <\p> 
<p> and comfortable condition,--making my prey of people's individualities, <\p> 
<p> as my custom was,--I tried to identify my mind with the old fellow's, <\p> 
<p> and take his view of the world, as if looking through a smoke-blackened <\p> 
<p> glass at the sun.  It robbed the landscape of all its life.  Those <\p> 
<p> pleasantly swelling slopes of our farm, descending towards the wide <\p> 
<p> meadows, through which sluggishly circled the brimful tide of the <\p> 
<p> Charles, bathing the long sedges on its hither and farther shores; the <\p> 
<p> broad, sunny gleam over the winding water; that peculiar <\p> 
<p> picturesqueness of the scene where capes and headlands put themselves <\p> 
<p> boldly forth upon the perfect level of the meadow, as into a green <\p> 
<p> lake, with inlets between the promontories; the shadowy woodland, with <\p> 
<p> twinkling showers of light falling into its depths; the sultry <\p> 
<p> heat-vapor, which rose everywhere like incense, and in which my soul <\p> 
<p> delighted, as indicating so rich a fervor in the passionate day, and in <\p> 
<p> the earth that was burning with its love,--I beheld all these things as <\p> 
<p> through old Moodie's eyes.  When my eyes are dimmer than they have yet <\p> 
<p> come to be, I will go thither again, and see if I did not catch the <\p> 
<p> tone of his mind aright, and if the cold and lifeless tint of his <\p> 
<p> perceptions be not then repeated in my own. <\p> 

<p> Yet it was unaccountable to myself, the interest that I felt in him. <\p> 

<p> "Have you any objection," said I, "to telling me who made those little <\p> 
<p> purses?" <\p> 

<p> "Gentlemen have often asked me that," said Moodie slowly; "but I shake <\p> 
<p> my head, and say little or nothing, and creep out of the way as well as <\p> 
<p> I can.  I am a man of few words; and if gentlemen were to be told one <\p> 
<p> thing, they would be very apt, I suppose, to ask me another. But it <\p> 
<p> happens just now, Mr. Coverdale, that you can tell me more about the <\p> 
<p> maker of those little purses than I can tell you." <\p> 

<p> "Why do you trouble him with needless questions, Coverdale?" <\p> 
<p> interrupted Hollingsworth.  "You must have known, long ago, that it was <\p> 
<p> Priscilla.  And so, my good friend, you have come to see her? Well, I <\p> 
<p> am glad of it.  You will find her altered very much for the better, <\p> 
<p> since that winter evening when you put her into my charge. Why, <\p> 
<p> Priscilla has a bloom in her cheeks, now!" <\p> 

<p> "Has my pale little girl a bloom?" repeated Moodie with a kind of slow <\p> 
<p> wonder.  "Priscilla with a bloom in her cheeks!  Ah, I am afraid I <\p> 
<p> shall not know my little girl.  And is she happy?" <\p> 

<p> "Just as happy as a bird," answered Hollingsworth. <\p> 

<p> "Then, gentlemen," said our guest apprehensively, "I don't think it <\p> 
<p> well for me to go any farther.  I crept hitherward only to ask about <\p> 
<p> Priscilla; and now that you have told me such good news, perhaps I can <\p> 
<p> do no better than to creep back again.  If she were to see this old <\p> 
<p> face of mine, the child would remember some very sad times which we <\p> 
<p> have spent together.  Some very sad times, indeed!  She has forgotten <\p> 
<p> them, I know,--them and me,--else she could not be so happy, nor have a <\p> 
<p> bloom in her cheeks.  Yes--yes--yes," continued he, still with the same <\p> 
<p> torpid utterance; "with many thanks to you, Mr. Hollingsworth, I will <\p> 
<p> creep back to town again." <\p> 

<p> "You shall do no such thing, Mr. Moodie," said Hollingsworth bluffly. <\p> 
<p> "Priscilla often speaks of you; and if there lacks anything to make her <\p> 
<p> cheeks bloom like two damask roses, I'll venture to say it is just the <\p> 
<p> sight of your face.  Come,--we will go and find her." <\p> 

<p> "Mr. Hollingsworth!" said the old man in his hesitating way. <\p> 

<p> "Well," answered Hollingsworth. <\p> 

<p> "Has there been any call for Priscilla?" asked Moodie; and though his <\p> 
<p> face was hidden from us, his tone gave a sure indication of the <\p> 
<p> mysterious nod and wink with which he put the question.  "You know, I <\p> 
<p> think, sir, what I mean." <\p> 

<p> "I have not the remotest suspicion what you mean, Mr. Moodie," replied <\p> 
<p> Hollingsworth; "nobody, to my knowledge, has called for Priscilla, <\p> 
<p> except yourself.  But come; we are losing time, and I have several <\p> 
<p> things to say to you by the way." <\p> 

<p> "And, Mr. Hollingsworth!" repeated Moodie. <\p> 

<p> "Well, again!" cried my friend rather impatiently.  "What now?" <\p> 

<p> "There is a lady here," said the old man; and his voice lost some of <\p> 
<p> its wearisome hesitation.  "You will account it a very strange matter <\p> 
<p> for me to talk about; but I chanced to know this lady when she was but <\p> 
<p> a little child.  If I am rightly informed, she has grown to be a very <\p> 
<p> fine woman, and makes a brilliant figure in the world, with her beauty, <\p> 
<p> and her talents, and her noble way of spending her riches.  I should <\p> 
<p> recognize this lady, so people tell me, by a magnificent flower in her <\p> 
<p> hair." <\p> 

<p> "What a rich tinge it gives to his colorless ideas, when he speaks of <\p> 
<p> Zenobia!"  I whispered to Hollingsworth.  "But how can there possibly <\p> 
<p> be any interest or connecting link between him and her?" <\p> 

<p> "The old man, for years past," whispered Hollingsworth, "has been a <\p> 
<p> little out of his right mind, as you probably see." <\p> 

<p> "What I would inquire," resumed Moodie, "is whether this beautiful lady <\p> 
<p> is kind to my poor Priscilla." <\p> 

<p> "Very kind," said Hollingsworth. <\p> 

<p> "Does she love her?" asked Moodie. <\p> 

<p> "It should seem so," answered my friend.  "They are always together." <\p> 

<p> "Like a gentlewoman and her maid-servant, I fancy?" suggested the old <\p> 
<p> man. <\p> 

<p> There was something so singular in his way of saying this, that I could <\p> 
<p> not resist the impulse to turn quite round, so as to catch a glimpse of <\p> 
<p> his face, almost imagining that I should see another person than old <\p> 
<p> Moodie.  But there he sat, with the patched side of his face towards me. <\p> 

<p> "Like an elder and younger sister, rather," replied Hollingsworth. <\p> 

<p> "Ah!" said Moodie more complacently, for his latter tones had harshness <\p> 
<p> and acidity in them,--"it would gladden my old heart to witness that. <\p> 
<p> If one thing would make me happier than another, Mr. Hollingsworth, it <\p> 
<p> would be to see that beautiful lady holding my little girl by the hand." <\p> 

<p> "Come along," said Hollingsworth, "and perhaps you may." <\p> 

<p> After a little more delay on the part of our freakish visitor, they set <\p> 
<p> forth together, old Moodie keeping a step or two behind Hollingsworth, <\p> 
<p> so that the latter could not very conveniently look him in the face.  I <\p> 
<p> remained under the tuft of maples, doing my utmost to draw an inference <\p> 
<p> from the scene that had just passed.  In spite of Hollingsworth's <\p> 
<p> off-hand explanation, it did not strike me that our strange guest was <\p> 
<p> really beside himself, but only that his mind needed screwing up, like <\p> 
<p> an instrument long out of tune, the strings of which have ceased to <\p> 
<p> vibrate smartly and sharply. Methought it would be profitable for us, <\p> 
<p> projectors of a happy life, to welcome this old gray shadow, and <\p> 
<p> cherish him as one of us, and let him creep about our domain, in order <\p> 
<p> that he might be a little merrier for our sakes, and we, sometimes, a <\p> 
<p> little sadder for his. Human destinies look ominous without some <\p> 
<p> perceptible intermixture of the sable or the gray.  And then, too, <\p> 
<p> should any of our fraternity grow feverish with an over-exulting sense <\p> 
<p> of prosperity, it would be a sort of cooling regimen to slink off into <\p> 
<p> the woods, and spend an hour, or a day, or as many days as might be <\p> 
<p> requisite to the cure, in uninterrupted communion with this deplorable <\p> 
<p> old Moodie! <\p> 

<p> Going homeward to dinner, I had a glimpse of him, behind the trunk of a <\p> 
<p> tree, gazing earnestly towards a particular window of the farmhouse; <\p> 
<p> and by and by Priscilla appeared at this window, playfully drawing <\p> 
<p> along Zenobia, who looked as bright as the very day that was blazing <\p> 
<p> down upon us, only not, by many degrees, so well advanced towards her <\p> 
<p> noon.  I was convinced that this pretty sight must have been purposely <\p> 
<p> arranged by Priscilla for the old man to see.  But either the girl held <\p> 
<p> her too long, or her fondness was resented as too great a freedom; for <\p> 
<p> Zenobia suddenly put Priscilla decidedly away, and gave her a haughty <\p> 
<p> look, as from a mistress to a dependant.  Old Moodie shook his head; <\p> 
<p> and again and again I saw him shake it, as he withdrew along the road; <\p> 
<p> and at the last point whence the farmhouse was visible, he turned and <\p> 
<p> shook his uplifted staff. <\p> 

<p> XI. THE WOOD-PATH <\p> 

<p> Not long after the preceding incident, in order to get the ache of too <\p> 
<p> constant labor out of my bones, and to relieve my spirit of the <\p> 
<p> irksomeness of a settled routine, I took a holiday.  It was my purpose <\p> 
<p> to spend it all alone, from breakfast-time till twilight, in the <\p> 
<p> deepest wood-seclusion that lay anywhere around us.  Though fond of <\p> 
<p> society, I was so constituted as to need these occasional retirements, <\p> 
<p> even in a life like that of Blithedale, which was itself characterized <\p> 
<p> by a remoteness from the world.  Unless renewed by a yet further <\p> 
<p> withdrawal towards the inner circle of self-communion, I lost the <\p> 
<p> better part of my individuality.  My thoughts became of little worth, <\p> 
<p> and my sensibilities grew as arid as a tuft of moss (a thing whose life <\p> 
<p> is in the shade, the rain, or the noontide dew), crumbling in the <\p> 
<p> sunshine after long expectance of a shower.  So, with my heart full of <\p> 
<p> a drowsy pleasure, and cautious not to dissipate my mood by previous <\p> 
<p> intercourse with any one, I hurried away, and was soon pacing a <\p> 
<p> wood-path, arched overhead with boughs, and dusky-brown beneath my feet. <\p> 

<p> At first I walked very swiftly, as if the heavy flood tide of social <\p> 
<p> life were roaring at my heels, and would outstrip and overwhelm me, <\p> 
<p> without all the better diligence in my escape.  But, threading the more <\p> 
<p> distant windings of the track, I abated my pace, and looked about me <\p> 
<p> for some side-aisle, that should admit me into the innermost sanctuary <\p> 
<p> of this green cathedral, just as, in human acquaintanceship, a casual <\p> 
<p> opening sometimes lets us, all of a sudden, into the long-sought <\p> 
<p> intimacy of a mysterious heart.  So much was I absorbed in my <\p> 
<p> reflections,--or, rather, in my mood, the substance of which was as yet <\p> 
<p> too shapeless to be called thought,--that footsteps rustled on the <\p> 
<p> leaves, and a figure passed me by, almost without impressing either the <\p> 
<p> sound or sight upon my consciousness. <\p> 

<p> A moment afterwards, I heard a voice at a little distance behind me, <\p> 
<p> speaking so sharply and impertinently that it made a complete discord <\p> 
<p> with my spiritual state, and caused the latter to vanish as abruptly as <\p> 
<p> when you thrust a finger into a soap-bubble. <\p> 

<p> "Halloo, friend!" cried this most unseasonable voice.  "Stop a moment, <\p> 
<p> I say!  I must have a word with you!" <\p> 

<p> I turned about, in a humor ludicrously irate.  In the first place, the <\p> 
<p> interruption, at any rate, was a grievous injury; then, the tone <\p> 
<p> displeased me.  And finally, unless there be real affection in his <\p> 
<p> heart, a man cannot,--such is the bad state to which the world has <\p> 
<p> brought itself,--cannot more effectually show his contempt for a <\p> 
<p> brother mortal, nor more gallingly assume a position of superiority, <\p> 
<p> than by addressing him as "friend."  Especially does the misapplication <\p> 
<p> of this phrase bring out that latent hostility which is sure to animate <\p> 
<p> peculiar sects, and those who, with however generous a purpose, have <\p> 
<p> sequestered themselves from the crowd; a feeling, it is true, which may <\p> 
<p> be hidden in some dog-kennel of the heart, grumbling there in the <\p> 
<p> darkness, but is never quite extinct, until the dissenting party have <\p> 
<p> gained power and scope enough to treat the world generously.  For my <\p> 
<p> part, I should have taken it as far less an insult to be styled <\p> 
<p> "fellow," "clown," or "bumpkin."  To either of these appellations my <\p> 
<p> rustic garb (it was a linen blouse, with checked shirt and striped <\p> 
<p> pantaloons, a chip hat on my head, and a rough hickory stick in my <\p> 
<p> hand) very fairly entitled me.  As the case stood, my temper darted at <\p> 
<p> once to the opposite pole; not friend, but enemy! <\p> 

<p> "What do you want with me?" said I, facing about. <\p> 

<p> "Come a little nearer, friend," said the stranger, beckoning. <\p> 

<p> "No," answered I. "If I can do anything for you without too much <\p> 
<p> trouble to myself, say so.  But recollect, if you please, that you are <\p> 
<p> not speaking to an acquaintance, much less a friend!" <\p> 

<p> "Upon my word, I believe not!" retorted he, looking at me with some <\p> 
<p> curiosity; and, lifting his hat, he made me a salute which had enough <\p> 
<p> of sarcasm to be offensive, and just enough of doubtful courtesy to <\p> 
<p> render any resentment of it absurd.  "But I ask your pardon!  I <\p> 
<p> recognize a little mistake.  If I may take the liberty to suppose it, <\p> 
<p> you, sir, are probably one of the aesthetic--or shall I rather say <\p> 
<p> ecstatic?--laborers, who have planted themselves hereabouts.  This is <\p> 
<p> your forest of Arden; and you are either the banished Duke in person, <\p> 
<p> or one of the chief nobles in his train.  The melancholy Jacques, <\p> 
<p> perhaps?  Be it so.  In that case, you can probably do me a favor." <\p> 

<p> I never, in my life, felt less inclined to confer a favor on any man. <\p> 

<p> "I am busy," said I. <\p> 

<p> So unexpectedly had the stranger made me sensible of his presence, that <\p> 
<p> he had almost the effect of an apparition; and certainly a less <\p> 
<p> appropriate one (taking into view the dim woodland solitude about us) <\p> 
<p> than if the salvage man of antiquity, hirsute and cinctured with a <\p> 
<p> leafy girdle, had started out of a thicket.  He was still young, <\p> 
<p> seemingly a little under thirty, of a tall and well-developed figure, <\p> 
<p> and as handsome a man as ever I beheld.  The style of his beauty, <\p> 
<p> however, though a masculine style, did not at all commend itself to my <\p> 
<p> taste.  His countenance--I hardly know how to describe the <\p> 
<p> peculiarity--had an indecorum in it, a kind of rudeness, a hard, <\p> 
<p> coarse, forth-putting freedom of expression, which no degree of <\p> 
<p> external polish could have abated one single jot.  Not that it was <\p> 
<p> vulgar.  But he had no fineness of nature; there was in his eyes <\p> 
<p> (although they might have artifice enough of another sort) the naked <\p> 
<p> exposure of something that ought not to be left prominent.  With these <\p> 
<p> vague allusions to what I have seen in other faces as well as his, I <\p> 
<p> leave the quality to be comprehended best--because with an intuitive <\p> 
<p> repugnance--by those who possess least of it. <\p> 

<p> His hair, as well as his beard and mustache, was coal-black; his eyes, <\p> 
<p> too, were black and sparkling, and his teeth remarkably brilliant. He <\p> 
<p> was rather carelessly but well and fashionably dressed, in a <\p> 
<p> summer-morning costume.  There was a gold chain, exquisitely wrought, <\p> 
<p> across his vest.  I never saw a smoother or whiter gloss than that upon <\p> 
<p> his shirt-bosom, which had a pin in it, set with a gem that glimmered, <\p> 
<p> in the leafy shadow where he stood, like a living tip of fire.  He <\p> 
<p> carried a stick with a wooden head, carved in vivid imitation of that <\p> 
<p> of a serpent.  I hated him, partly, I do believe, from a comparison of <\p> 
<p> my own homely garb with his well-ordered foppishness. <\p> 

<p> "Well, sir," said I, a little ashamed of my first irritation, but still <\p> 
<p> with no waste of civility, "be pleased to speak at once, as I have my <\p> 
<p> own business in hand." <\p> 

<p> "I regret that my mode of addressing you was a little unfortunate," <\p> 
<p> said the stranger, smiling; for he seemed a very acute sort of person, <\p> 
<p> and saw, in some degree, how I stood affected towards him.  "I intended <\p> 
<p> no offence, and shall certainly comport myself with due ceremony <\p> 
<p> hereafter.  I merely wish to make a few inquiries respecting a lady, <\p> 
<p> formerly of my acquaintance, who is now resident in your Community, <\p> 
<p> and, I believe, largely concerned in your social enterprise.  You call <\p> 
<p> her, I think, Zenobia." <\p> 

<p> "That is her name in literature," observed I; "a name, too, which <\p> 
<p> possibly she may permit her private friends to know and address her <\p> 
<p> by,--but not one which they feel at liberty to recognize when used of <\p> 
<p> her personally by a stranger or casual acquaintance." <\p> 

<p> "Indeed!" answered this disagreeable person; and he turned aside his <\p> 
<p> face for an instant with a brief laugh, which struck me as a noteworthy <\p> 
<p> expression of his character.  "Perhaps I might put forward a claim, on <\p> 
<p> your own grounds, to call the lady by a name so appropriate to her <\p> 
<p> splendid qualities.  But I am willing to know her by any cognomen that <\p> 
<p> you may suggest." <\p> 

<p> Heartily wishing that he would be either a little more offensive, or a <\p> 
<p> good deal less so, or break off our intercourse altogether, I mentioned <\p> 
<p> Zenobia's real name. <\p> 

<p> "True," said he; "and in general society I have never heard her called <\p> 
<p> otherwise.  And, after all, our discussion of the point has been <\p> 
<p> gratuitous.  My object is only to inquire when, where, and how this <\p> 
<p> lady may most conveniently be seen." <\p> 

<p> "At her present residence, of course," I replied.  "You have but to go <\p> 
<p> thither and ask for her.  This very path will lead you within sight of <\p> 
<p> the house; so I wish you good-morning." <\p> 

<p> "One moment, if you please," said the stranger.  "The course you <\p> 
<p> indicate would certainly be the proper one, in an ordinary morning <\p> 
<p> call.  But my business is private, personal, and somewhat peculiar. <\p> 
<p> Now, in a community like this, I should judge that any little <\p> 
<p> occurrence is likely to be discussed rather more minutely than would <\p> 
<p> quite suit my views.  I refer solely to myself, you understand, and <\p> 
<p> without intimating that it would be other than a matter of entire <\p> 
<p> indifference to the lady.  In short, I especially desire to see her in <\p> 
<p> private.  If her habits are such as I have known them, she is probably <\p> 
<p> often to be met with in the woods, or by the river-side; and I think <\p> 
<p> you could do me the favor to point out some favorite walk, where, about <\p> 
<p> this hour, I might be fortunate enough to gain an interview." <\p> 

<p> I reflected that it would be quite a supererogatory piece of Quixotism <\p> 
<p> in me to undertake the guardianship of Zenobia, who, for my pains, <\p> 
<p> would only make me the butt of endless ridicule, should the fact ever <\p> 
<p> come to her knowledge.  I therefore described a spot which, as often as <\p> 
<p> any other, was Zenobia's resort at this period of the day; nor was it <\p> 
<p> so remote from the farmhouse as to leave her in much peril, whatever <\p> 
<p> might be the stranger's character. <\p> 

<p> "A single word more," said he; and his black eyes sparkled at me, <\p> 
<p> whether with fun or malice I knew not, but certainly as if the Devil <\p> 
<p> were peeping out of them.  "Among your fraternity, I understand, there <\p> 
<p> is a certain holy and benevolent blacksmith; a man of iron, in more <\p> 
<p> senses than one; a rough, cross-grained, well-meaning individual, <\p> 
<p> rather boorish in his manners, as might be expected, and by no means of <\p> 
<p> the highest intellectual cultivation.  He is a philanthropical <\p> 
<p> lecturer, with two or three disciples, and a scheme of his own, the <\p> 
<p> preliminary step in which involves a large purchase of land, and the <\p> 
<p> erection of a spacious edifice, at an expense considerably beyond his <\p> 
<p> means; inasmuch as these are to be reckoned in copper or old iron much <\p> 
<p> more conveniently than in gold or silver.  He hammers away upon his one <\p> 
<p> topic as lustily as ever he did upon a horseshoe!  Do you know such a <\p> 
<p> person?"  I shook my head, and was turning away.  "Our friend," he <\p> 
<p> continued, "is described to me as a brawny, shaggy, grim, and <\p> 
<p> ill-favored personage, not particularly well calculated, one would say, <\p> 
<p> to insinuate himself with the softer sex.  Yet, so far has this honest <\p> 
<p> fellow succeeded with one lady whom we wot of, that he anticipates, <\p> 
<p> from her abundant resources, the necessary funds for realizing his plan <\p> 
<p> in brick and mortar!" <\p> 

<p> Here the stranger seemed to be so much amused with his sketch of <\p> 
<p> Hollingsworth's character and purposes, that he burst into a fit of <\p> 
<p> merriment, of the same nature as the brief, metallic laugh already <\p> 
<p> alluded to, but immensely prolonged and enlarged.  In the excess of his <\p> 
<p> delight, he opened his mouth wide, and disclosed a gold band around the <\p> 
<p> upper part of his teeth, thereby making it apparent that every one of <\p> 
<p> his brilliant grinders and incisors was a sham.  This discovery <\p> 
<p> affected me very oddly. <\p> 

<p> I felt as if the whole man were a moral and physical humbug; his <\p> 
<p> wonderful beauty of face, for aught I knew, might be removable like a <\p> 
<p> mask; and, tall and comely as his figure looked, he was perhaps but a <\p> 
<p> wizened little elf, gray and decrepit, with nothing genuine about him <\p> 
<p> save the wicked expression of his grin.  The fantasy of his spectral <\p> 
<p> character so wrought upon me, together with the contagion of his <\p> 
<p> strange mirth on my sympathies, that I soon began to laugh as loudly as <\p> 
<p> himself. <\p> 

<p> By and by, he paused all at once; so suddenly, indeed, that my own <\p> 
<p> cachinnation lasted a moment longer. <\p> 

<p> "Ah, excuse me!" said he.  "Our interview seems to proceed more merrily <\p> 
<p> than it began." <\p> 

<p> "It ends here," answered I. "And I take shame to myself that my folly <\p> 
<p> has lost me the right of resenting your ridicule of a friend." <\p> 

<p> "Pray allow me," said the stranger, approaching a step nearer, and <\p> 
<p> laying his gloved hand on my sleeve.  "One other favor I must ask of <\p> 
<p> you.  You have a young person here at Blithedale, of whom I have <\p> 
<p> heard,--whom, perhaps, I have known,--and in whom, at all events, I <\p> 
<p> take a peculiar interest.  She is one of those delicate, nervous young <\p> 
<p> creatures, not uncommon in New England, and whom I suppose to have <\p> 
<p> become what we find them by the gradual refining away of the physical <\p> 
<p> system among your women.  Some philosophers choose to glorify this <\p> 
<p> habit of body by terming it spiritual; but, in my opinion, it is rather <\p> 
<p> the effect of unwholesome food, bad air, lack of outdoor exercise, and <\p> 
<p> neglect of bathing, on the part of these damsels and their female <\p> 
<p> progenitors, all resulting in a kind of hereditary dyspepsia.  Zenobia, <\p> 
<p> even with her uncomfortable surplus of vitality, is far the better <\p> 
<p> model of womanhood.  But--to revert again to this young person--she <\p> 
<p> goes among you by the name of Priscilla.  Could you possibly afford me <\p> 
<p> the means of speaking with her?" <\p> 

<p> "You have made so many inquiries of me," I observed, "that I may at <\p> 
<p> least trouble you with one.  What is your name?" <\p> 

<p> He offered me a card, with "Professor Westervelt" engraved on it.  At <\p> 
<p> the same time, as if to vindicate his claim to the professorial <\p> 
<p> dignity, so often assumed on very questionable grounds, he put on a <\p> 
<p> pair of spectacles, which so altered the character of his face that I <\p> 
<p> hardly knew him again.  But I liked the present aspect no better than <\p> 
<p> the former one. <\p> 

<p> "I must decline any further connection with your affairs," said I, <\p> 
<p> drawing back.  "I have told you where to find Zenobia.  As for <\p> 
<p> Priscilla, she has closer friends than myself, through whom, if they <\p> 
<p> see fit, you can gain access to her." <\p> 

<p> "In that case," returned the Professor, ceremoniously raising his hat, <\p> 
<p> "good-morning to you." <\p> 

<p> He took his departure, and was soon out of sight among the windings of <\p> 
<p> the wood-path.  But after a little reflection, I could not help <\p> 
<p> regretting that I had so peremptorily broken off the interview, while <\p> 
<p> the stranger seemed inclined to continue it.  His evident knowledge of <\p> 
<p> matters affecting my three friends might have led to disclosures or <\p> 
<p> inferences that would perhaps have been serviceable.  I was <\p> 
<p> particularly struck with the fact that, ever since the appearance of <\p> 
<p> Priscilla, it had been the tendency of events to suggest and establish <\p> 
<p> a connection between Zenobia and her.  She had come, in the first <\p> 
<p> instance, as if with the sole purpose of claiming Zenobia's protection. <\p> 
<p> Old Moodie's visit, it appeared, was chiefly to ascertain whether this <\p> 
<p> object had been accomplished.  And here, to-day, was the questionable <\p> 
<p> Professor, linking one with the other in his inquiries, and seeking <\p> 
<p> communication with both. <\p> 

<p> Meanwhile, my inclination for a ramble having been balked, I lingered <\p> 
<p> in the vicinity of the farm, with perhaps a vague idea that some new <\p> 
<p> event would grow out of Westervelt's proposed interview with Zenobia. <\p> 
<p> My own part in these transactions was singularly subordinate.  It <\p> 
<p> resembled that of the Chorus in a classic play, which seems to be set <\p> 
<p> aloof from the possibility of personal concernment, and bestows the <\p> 
<p> whole measure of its hope or fear, its exultation or sorrow, on the <\p> 
<p> fortunes of others, between whom and itself this sympathy is the only <\p> 
<p> bond.  Destiny, it may be,--the most skilful of stage managers,--seldom <\p> 
<p> chooses to arrange its scenes, and carry forward its drama, without <\p> 
<p> securing the presence of at least one calm observer.  It is his office <\p> 
<p> to give applause when due, and sometimes an inevitable tear, to detect <\p> 
<p> the final fitness of incident to character, and distil in his <\p> 
<p> long-brooding thought the whole morality of the performance. <\p> 

<p> Not to be out of the way in case there were need of me in my vocation, <\p> 
<p> and, at the same time, to avoid thrusting myself where neither destiny <\p> 
<p> nor mortals might desire my presence, I remained pretty near the verge <\p> 
<p> of the woodlands.  My position was off the track of Zenobia's customary <\p> 
<p> walk, yet not so remote but that a recognized occasion might speedily <\p> 
<p> have brought me thither. <\p> 

<p> XII. COVERDALE'S HERMITAGE <\p> 

<p> Long since, in this part of our circumjacent wood, I had found out for <\p> 
<p> myself a little hermitage.  It was a kind of leafy cave, high upward <\p> 
<p> into the air, among the midmost branches of a white-pine tree. A wild <\p> 
<p> grapevine, of unusual size and luxuriance, had twined and twisted <\p> 
<p> itself up into the tree, and, after wreathing the entanglement of its <\p> 
<p> tendrils around almost every bough, had caught hold of three or four <\p> 
<p> neighboring trees, and married the whole clump with a perfectly <\p> 
<p> inextricable knot of polygamy.  Once, while sheltering myself from a <\p> 
<p> summer shower, the fancy had taken me to clamber up into this seemingly <\p> 
<p> impervious mass of foliage.  The branches yielded me a passage, and <\p> 
<p> closed again beneath, as if only a squirrel or a bird had passed.  Far <\p> 
<p> aloft, around the stem of the central pine, behold a perfect nest for <\p> 
<p> Robinson Crusoe or King Charles!  A hollow chamber of rare seclusion <\p> 
<p> had been formed by the decay of some of the pine branches, which the <\p> 
<p> vine had lovingly strangled with its embrace, burying them from the <\p> 
<p> light of day in an aerial sepulchre of its own leaves.  It cost me but <\p> 
<p> little ingenuity to enlarge the interior, and open loopholes through <\p> 
<p> the verdant walls.  Had it ever been my fortune to spend a honeymoon, I <\p> 
<p> should have thought seriously of inviting my bride up thither, where <\p> 
<p> our next neighbors would have been two orioles in another part of the <\p> 
<p> clump. <\p> 

<p> It was an admirable place to make verses, tuning the rhythm to the <\p> 
<p> breezy symphony that so often stirred among the vine leaves; or to <\p> 
<p> meditate an essay for "The Dial," in which the many tongues of Nature <\p> 
<p> whispered mysteries, and seemed to ask only a little stronger puff of <\p> 
<p> wind to speak out the solution of its riddle.  Being so pervious to <\p> 
<p> air-currents, it was just the nook, too, for the enjoyment of a cigar. <\p> 
<p> This hermitage was my one exclusive possession while I counted myself a <\p> 
<p> brother of the socialists.  It symbolized my individuality, and aided <\p> 
<p> me in keeping it inviolate.  None ever found me out in it, except, <\p> 
<p> once, a squirrel.  I brought thither no guest, because, after <\p> 
<p> Hollingsworth failed me, there was no longer the man alive with whom I <\p> 
<p> could think of sharing all.  So there I used to sit, owl-like, yet not <\p> 
<p> without liberal and hospitable thoughts.  I counted the innumerable <\p> 
<p> clusters of my vine, and fore-reckoned the abundance of my vintage.  It <\p> 
<p> gladdened me to anticipate the surprise of the Community, when, like an <\p> 
<p> allegorical figure of rich October, I should make my appearance, with <\p> 
<p> shoulders bent beneath the burden of ripe grapes, and some of the <\p> 
<p> crushed ones crimsoning my brow as with a bloodstain. <\p> 

<p> Ascending into this natural turret, I peeped in turn out of several of <\p> 
<p> its small windows.  The pine-tree, being ancient, rose high above the <\p> 
<p> rest of the wood, which was of comparatively recent growth.  Even where <\p> 
<p> I sat, about midway between the root and the topmost bough, my position <\p> 
<p> was lofty enough to serve as an observatory, not for starry <\p> 
<p> investigations, but for those sublunary matters in which lay a lore as <\p> 
<p> infinite as that of the planets.  Through one loophole I saw the river <\p> 
<p> lapsing calmly onward, while in the meadow, near its brink, a few of <\p> 
<p> the brethren were digging peat for our winter's fuel.  On the interior <\p> 
<p> cart-road of our farm I discerned Hollingsworth, with a yoke of oxen <\p> 
<p> hitched to a drag of stones, that were to be piled into a fence, on <\p> 
<p> which we employed ourselves at the odd intervals of other labor.  The <\p> 
<p> harsh tones of his voice, shouting to the sluggish steers, made me <\p> 
<p> sensible, even at such a distance, that he was ill at ease, and that <\p> 
<p> the balked philanthropist had the battle-spirit in his heart. <\p> 

<p> "Haw, Buck!" quoth he.  "Come along there, ye lazy ones!  What are ye <\p> 
<p> about, now?  Gee!" <\p> 

<p> "Mankind, in Hollingsworth's opinion," thought I, "is but another yoke <\p> 
<p> of oxen, as stubborn, stupid, and sluggish as our old Brown and Bright. <\p> 
<p> He vituperates us aloud, and curses us in his heart, and will begin to <\p> 
<p> prick us with the goad-stick, by and by.  But are we his oxen?  And <\p> 
<p> what right has he to be the driver?  And why, when there is enough else <\p> 
<p> to do, should we waste our strength in dragging home the ponderous load <\p> 
<p> of his philanthropic absurdities?  At my height above the earth, the <\p> 
<p> whole matter looks ridiculous!" <\p> 

<p> Turning towards the farmhouse, I saw Priscilla (for, though a great way <\p> 
<p> off, the eye of faith assured me that it was she) sitting at Zenobia's <\p> 
<p> window, and making little purses, I suppose; or, perhaps, mending the <\p> 
<p> Community's old linen.  A bird flew past my tree; and, as it clove its <\p> 
<p> way onward into the sunny atmosphere, I flung it a message for <\p> 
<p> Priscilla. <\p> 

<p> "Tell her," said I, "that her fragile thread of life has inextricably <\p> 
<p> knotted itself with other and tougher threads, and most likely it will <\p> 
<p> be broken.  Tell her that Zenobia will not be long her friend. Say that <\p> 
<p> Hollingsworth's heart is on fire with his own purpose, but icy for all <\p> 
<p> human affection; and that, if she has given him her love, it is like <\p> 
<p> casting a flower into a sepulchre.  And say that if any mortal really <\p> 
<p> cares for her, it is myself; and not even I for her realities,--poor <\p> 
<p> little seamstress, as Zenobia rightly called her!--but for the <\p> 
<p> fancy-work with which I have idly decked her out!" <\p> 

<p> The pleasant scent of the wood, evolved by the hot sun, stole up to my <\p> 
<p> nostrils, as if I had been an idol in its niche.  Many trees mingled <\p> 
<p> their fragrance into a thousand-fold odor.  Possibly there was a <\p> 
<p> sensual influence in the broad light of noon that lay beneath me.  It <\p> 
<p> may have been the cause, in part, that I suddenly found myself <\p> 
<p> possessed by a mood of disbelief in moral beauty or heroism, and a <\p> 
<p> conviction of the folly of attempting to benefit the world. Our <\p> 
<p> especial scheme of reform, which, from my observatory, I could take in <\p> 
<p> with the bodily eye, looked so ridiculous that it was impossible not to <\p> 
<p> laugh aloud. <\p> 

<p> "But the joke is a little too heavy," thought I. "If I were wise, I <\p> 
<p> should get out of the scrape with all diligence, and then laugh at my <\p> 
<p> companions for remaining in it." <\p> 

<p> While thus musing, I heard with perfect distinctness, somewhere in the <\p> 
<p> wood beneath, the peculiar laugh which I have described as one of the <\p> 
<p> disagreeable characteristics of Professor Westervelt.  It brought my <\p> 
<p> thoughts back to our recent interview.  I recognized as chiefly due to <\p> 
<p> this man's influence the sceptical and sneering view which just now had <\p> 
<p> filled my mental vision in regard to all life's better purposes.  And <\p> 
<p> it was through his eyes, more than my own, that I was looking at <\p> 
<p> Hollingsworth, with his glorious if impracticable dream, and at the <\p> 
<p> noble earthliness of Zenobia's character, and even at Priscilla, whose <\p> 
<p> impalpable grace lay so singularly between disease and beauty.  The <\p> 
<p> essential charm of each had vanished.  There are some spheres the <\p> 
<p> contact with which inevitably degrades the high, debases the pure, <\p> 
<p> deforms the beautiful.  It must be a mind of uncommon strength, and <\p> 
<p> little impressibility, that can permit itself the habit of such <\p> 
<p> intercourse, and not be permanently deteriorated; and yet the <\p> 
<p> Professor's tone represented that of worldly society at large, where a <\p> 
<p> cold scepticism smothers what it can of our spiritual aspirations, and <\p> 
<p> makes the rest ridiculous.  I detested this kind of man; and all the <\p> 
<p> more because a part of my own nature showed itself responsive to him. <\p> 

<p> Voices were now approaching through the region of the wood which lay in <\p> 
<p> the vicinity of my tree.  Soon I caught glimpses of two figures--a <\p> 
<p> woman and a man--Zenobia and the stranger--earnestly talking together <\p> 
<p> as they advanced. <\p> 

<p> Zenobia had a rich though varying color.  It was, most of the while, a <\p> 
<p> flame, and anon a sudden paleness.  Her eyes glowed, so that their <\p> 
<p> light sometimes flashed upward to me, as when the sun throws a dazzle <\p> 
<p> from some bright object on the ground.  Her gestures were free, and <\p> 
<p> strikingly impressive.  The whole woman was alive with a passionate <\p> 
<p> intensity, which I now perceived to be the phase in which her beauty <\p> 
<p> culminated.  Any passion would have become her well; and passionate <\p> 
<p> love, perhaps, the best of all.  This was not love, but anger, largely <\p> 
<p> intermixed with scorn.  Yet the idea strangely forced itself upon me, <\p> 
<p> that there was a sort of familiarity between these two companions, <\p> 
<p> necessarily the result of an intimate love,--on Zenobia's part, at <\p> 
<p> least,--in days gone by, but which had prolonged itself into as <\p> 
<p> intimate a hatred, for all futurity.  As they passed among the trees, <\p> 
<p> reckless as her movement was, she took good heed that even the hem of <\p> 
<p> her garment should not brush against the stranger's person.  I wondered <\p> 
<p> whether there had always been a chasm, guarded so religiously, betwixt <\p> 
<p> these two. <\p> 

<p> As for Westervelt, he was not a whit more warmed by Zenobia's passion <\p> 
<p> than a salamander by the heat of its native furnace.  He would have <\p> 
<p> been absolutely statuesque, save for a look of slight perplexity, <\p> 
<p> tinctured strongly with derision.  It was a crisis in which his <\p> 
<p> intellectual perceptions could not altogether help him out.  He failed <\p> 
<p> to comprehend, and cared but little for comprehending, why Zenobia <\p> 
<p> should put herself into such a fume; but satisfied his mind that it was <\p> 
<p> all folly, and only another shape of a woman's manifold absurdity, <\p> 
<p> which men can never understand.  How many a woman's evil fate has yoked <\p> 
<p> her with a man like this!  Nature thrusts some of us into the world <\p> 
<p> miserably incomplete on the emotional side, with hardly any <\p> 
<p> sensibilities except what pertain to us as animals.  No passion, save <\p> 
<p> of the senses; no holy tenderness, nor the delicacy that results from <\p> 
<p> this.  Externally they bear a close resemblance to other men, and have <\p> 
<p> perhaps all save the finest grace; but when a woman wrecks herself on <\p> 
<p> such a being, she ultimately finds that the real womanhood within her <\p> 
<p> has no corresponding part in him.  Her deepest voice lacks a response; <\p> 
<p> the deeper her cry, the more dead his silence.  The fault may be none <\p> 
<p> of his; he cannot give her what never lived within his soul.  But the <\p> 
<p> wretchedness on her side, and the moral deterioration attendant on a <\p> 
<p> false and shallow life, without strength enough to keep itself sweet, <\p> 
<p> are among the most pitiable wrongs that mortals suffer. <\p> 

<p> Now, as I looked down from my upper region at this man and <\p> 
<p> woman,--outwardly so fair a sight, and wandering like two lovers in the <\p> 
<p> wood,--I imagined that Zenobia, at an earlier period of youth, might <\p> 
<p> have fallen into the misfortune above indicated.  And when her <\p> 
<p> passionate womanhood, as was inevitable, had discovered its mistake, <\p> 
<p> here had ensued the character of eccentricity and defiance which <\p> 
<p> distinguished the more public portion of her life. <\p> 

<p> Seeing how aptly matters had chanced thus far, I began to think it the <\p> 
<p> design of fate to let me into all Zenobia's secrets, and that therefore <\p> 
<p> the couple would sit down beneath my tree, and carry on a conversation <\p> 
<p> which would leave me nothing to inquire.  No doubt, however, had it so <\p> 
<p> happened, I should have deemed myself honorably bound to warn them of a <\p> 
<p> listener's presence by flinging down a handful of unripe grapes, or by <\p> 
<p> sending an unearthly groan out of my hiding-place, as if this were one <\p> 
<p> of the trees of Dante's ghostly forest.  But real life never arranges <\p> 
<p> itself exactly like a romance. In the first place, they did not sit <\p> 
<p> down at all.  Secondly, even while they passed beneath the tree, <\p> 
<p> Zenobia's utterance was so hasty and broken, and Westervelt's so cool <\p> 
<p> and low, that I hardly could make out an intelligible sentence on <\p> 
<p> either side.  What I seem to remember, I yet suspect, may have been <\p> 
<p> patched together by my fancy, in brooding over the matter afterwards. <\p> 

<p> "Why not fling the girl off," said Westervelt, "and let her go?" <\p> 

<p> "She clung to me from the first," replied Zenobia.  "I neither know nor <\p> 
<p> care what it is in me that so attaches her.  But she loves me, and I <\p> 
<p> will not fail her." <\p> 

<p> "She will plague you, then," said he, "in more ways than one." <\p> 

<p> "The poor child!" exclaimed Zenobia.  "She can do me neither good nor <\p> 
<p> harm.  How should she?" <\p> 

<p> I know not what reply Westervelt whispered; nor did Zenobia's <\p> 
<p> subsequent exclamation give me any clew, except that it evidently <\p> 
<p> inspired her with horror and disgust. <\p> 

<p> "With what kind of a being am I linked?" cried she.  "If my Creator <\p> 
<p> cares aught for my soul, let him release me from this miserable bond!" <\p> 

<p> "I did not think it weighed so heavily," said her companion.. <\p> 

<p> "Nevertheless," answered Zenobia, "it will strangle me at last!" <\p> 

<p> And then I heard her utter a helpless sort of moan; a sound which, <\p> 
<p> struggling out of the heart of a person of her pride and strength, <\p> 
<p> affected me more than if she had made the wood dolorously vocal with a <\p> 
<p> thousand shrieks and wails. <\p> 

<p> Other mysterious words, besides what are above written, they spoke <\p> 
<p> together; but I understood no more, and even question whether I fairly <\p> 
<p> understood so much as this.  By long brooding over our recollections, <\p> 
<p> we subtilize them into something akin to imaginary stuff, and hardly <\p> 
<p> capable of being distinguished from it.  In a few moments they were <\p> 
<p> completely beyond ear-shot.  A breeze stirred after them, and awoke the <\p> 
<p> leafy tongues of the surrounding trees, which forthwith began to <\p> 
<p> babble, as if innumerable gossips had all at once got wind of Zenobia's <\p> 
<p> secret.  But, as the breeze grew stronger, its voice among the branches <\p> 
<p> was as if it said, "Hush!  Hush!" and I resolved that to no mortal <\p> 
<p> would I disclose what I had heard.  And, though there might be room for <\p> 
<p> casuistry, such, I conceive, is the most equitable rule in all similar <\p> 
<p> conjunctures. <\p> 

<p> XIII. ZENOBIA'S LEGEND <\p> 

<p> The illustrious Society of Blithedale, though it toiled in downright <\p> 
<p> earnest for the good of mankind, yet not unfrequently illuminated its <\p> 
<p> laborious life with an afternoon or evening of pastime.  Picnics under <\p> 
<p> the trees were considerably in vogue; and, within doors, fragmentary <\p> 
<p> bits of theatrical performance, such as single acts of tragedy or <\p> 
<p> comedy, or dramatic proverbs and charades.  Zenobia, besides, was fond <\p> 
<p> of giving us readings from Shakespeare, and often with a depth of <\p> 
<p> tragic power, or breadth of comic effect, that made one feel it an <\p> 
<p> intolerable wrong to the world that she did not at once go upon the <\p> 
<p> stage.  Tableaux vivants were another of our occasional modes of <\p> 
<p> amusement, in which scarlet shawls, old silken robes, ruffs, velvets, <\p> 
<p> furs, and all kinds of miscellaneous trumpery converted our familiar <\p> 
<p> companions into the people of a pictorial world.  We had been thus <\p> 
<p> engaged on the evening after the incident narrated in the last chapter. <\p> 
<p> Several splendid works of art--either arranged after engravings from <\p> 
<p> the old masters, or original illustrations of scenes in history or <\p> 
<p> romance--had been presented, and we were earnestly entreating Zenobia <\p> 
<p> for more. <\p> 

<p> She stood with a meditative air, holding a large piece of gauze, or <\p> 
<p> some such ethereal stuff, as if considering what picture should next <\p> 
<p> occupy the frame; while at her feet lay a heap of many-colored <\p> 
<p> garments, which her quick fancy and magic skill could so easily convert <\p> 
<p> into gorgeous draperies for heroes and princesses. <\p> 

<p> "I am getting weary of this," said she, after a moment's thought. "Our <\p> 
<p> own features, and our own figures and airs, show a little too <\p> 
<p> intrusively through all the characters we assume.  We have so much <\p> 
<p> familiarity with one another's realities, that we cannot remove <\p> 
<p> ourselves, at pleasure, into an imaginary sphere.  Let us have no more <\p> 
<p> pictures to-night; but, to make you what poor amends I can, how would <\p> 
<p> you like to have me trump up a wild, spectral legend, on the spur of <\p> 
<p> the moment?" <\p> 

<p> Zenobia had the gift of telling a fanciful little story, off-hand, in a <\p> 
<p> way that made it greatly more effective than it was usually found to be <\p> 
<p> when she afterwards elaborated the same production with her pen. Her <\p> 
<p> proposal, therefore, was greeted with acclamation. <\p> 

<p> "Oh, a story, a story, by all means!" cried the young girls.  "No <\p> 
<p> matter how marvellous; we will believe it, every word.  And let it be a <\p> 
<p> ghost story, if you please." <\p> 

<p> "No, not exactly a ghost story," answered Zenobia; "but something so <\p> 
<p> nearly like it that you shall hardly tell the difference.  And, <\p> 
<p> Priscilla, stand you before me, where I may look at you, and get my <\p> 
<p> inspiration out of your eyes.  They are very deep and dreamy to-night." <\p> 

<p> I know not whether the following version of her story will retain any <\p> 
<p> portion of its pristine character; but, as Zenobia told it wildly and <\p> 
<p> rapidly, hesitating at no extravagance, and dashing at absurdities <\p> 
<p> which I am too timorous to repeat,--giving it the varied emphasis of <\p> 
<p> her inimitable voice, and the pictorial illustration of her mobile <\p> 
<p> face, while through it all we caught the freshest aroma of the <\p> 
<p> thoughts, as they came bubbling out of her mind,--thus narrated, and <\p> 
<p> thus heard, the legend seemed quite a remarkable affair.  I scarcely <\p> 
<p> knew, at the time, whether she intended us to laugh or be more <\p> 
<p> seriously impressed.  From beginning to end, it was undeniable <\p> 
<p> nonsense, but not necessarily the worse for that. <\p> 

<p> THE SILVERY VEIL <\p> 

<p> You have heard, my dear friends, of the Veiled Lady, who grew suddenly <\p> 
<p> so very famous, a few months ago.  And have you never thought how <\p> 
<p> remarkable it was that this marvellous creature should vanish, all at <\p> 
<p> once, while her renown was on the increase, before the public had grown <\p> 
<p> weary of her, and when the enigma of her character, instead of being <\p> 
<p> solved, presented itself more mystically at every exhibition?  Her last <\p> 
<p> appearance, as you know, was before a crowded audience.  The next <\p> 
<p> evening,--although the bills had announced her, at the corner of every <\p> 
<p> street, in red letters of a gigantic size,--there was no Veiled Lady to <\p> 
<p> be seen!  Now, listen to my simple little tale, and you shall hear the <\p> 
<p> very latest incident in the known life--(if life it may be called, <\p> 
<p> which seemed to have no more reality than the candle-light image of <\p> 
<p> one's self which peeps at us outside of a dark windowpane)--the life of <\p> 
<p> this shadowy phenomenon. <\p> 

<p> A party of young gentlemen, you are to understand, were enjoying <\p> 
<p> themselves, one afternoon,--as young gentlemen are sometimes fond of <\p> 
<p> doing,--over a bottle or two of champagne; and, among other ladies less <\p> 
<p> mysterious, the subject of the Veiled Lady, as was very natural, <\p> 
<p> happened to come up before them for discussion.  She rose, as it were, <\p> 
<p> with the sparkling effervescence of their wine, and appeared in a more <\p> 
<p> airy and fantastic light on account of the medium through which they <\p> 
<p> saw her.  They repeated to one another, between jest and earnest, all <\p> 
<p> the wild stories that were in vogue; nor, I presume, did they hesitate <\p> 
<p> to add any small circumstance that the inventive whim of the moment <\p> 
<p> might suggest, to heighten the marvellousness of their theme. <\p> 

<p> "But what an audacious report was that," observed one, "which pretended <\p> 
<p> to assert the identity of this strange creature with a young <\p> 
<p> lady,"--and here he mentioned her name,--"the daughter of one of our <\p> 
<p> most distinguished families!" <\p> 

<p> "Ah, there is more in that story than can well be accounted for," <\p> 
<p> remarked another.  "I have it on good authority, that the young lady in <\p> 
<p> question is invariably out of sight, and not to be traced, even by her <\p> 
<p> own family, at the hours when the Veiled Lady is before the public; nor <\p> 
<p> can any satisfactory explanation be given of her disappearance.  And <\p> 
<p> just look at the thing: Her brother is a young fellow of spirit.  He <\p> 
<p> cannot but be aware of these rumors in reference to his sister.  Why, <\p> 
<p> then, does he not come forward to defend her character, unless he is <\p> 
<p> conscious that an investigation would only make the matter worse?" <\p> 

<p> It is essential to the purposes of my legend to distinguish one of <\p> 
<p> these young gentlemen from his companions; so, for the sake of a soft <\p> 
<p> and pretty name (such as we of the literary sisterhood invariably <\p> 
<p> bestow upon our heroes), I deem it fit to call him Theodore. <\p> 

<p> "Pshaw!" exclaimed Theodore; "her brother is no such fool!  Nobody, <\p> 
<p> unless his brain be as full of bubbles as this wine, can seriously <\p> 
<p> think of crediting that ridiculous rumor.  Why, if my senses did not <\p> 
<p> play me false (which never was the case yet), I affirm that I saw that <\p> 
<p> very lady, last evening, at the exhibition, while this veiled <\p> 
<p> phenomenon was playing off her juggling tricks!  What can you say to <\p> 
<p> that?" <\p> 

<p> "Oh, it was a spectral illusion that you saw!" replied his friends, <\p> 
<p> with a general laugh.  "The Veiled Lady is quite up to such a thing." <\p> 

<p> However, as the above-mentioned fable could not hold its ground against <\p> 
<p> Theodore's downright refutation, they went on to speak of other stories <\p> 
<p> which the wild babble of the town had set afloat.  Some upheld that the <\p> 
<p> veil covered the most beautiful countenance in the world; others,--and <\p> 
<p> certainly with more reason, considering the sex of the Veiled <\p> 
<p> Lady,--that the face was the most hideous and horrible, and that this <\p> 
<p> was her sole motive for hiding it.  It was the face of a corpse; it was <\p> 
<p> the head of a skeleton; it was a monstrous visage, with snaky locks, <\p> 
<p> like Medusa's, and one great red eye in the centre of the forehead. <\p> 
<p> Again, it was affirmed that there was no single and unchangeable set of <\p> 
<p> features beneath the veil; but that whosoever should be bold enough to <\p> 
<p> lift it would behold the features of that person, in all the world, who <\p> 
<p> was destined to be his fate; perhaps he would be greeted by the tender <\p> 
<p> smile of the woman whom he loved, or, quite as probably, the deadly <\p> 
<p> scowl of his bitterest enemy would throw a blight over his life.  They <\p> 
<p> quoted, moreover, this startling explanation of the whole affair: that <\p> 
<p> the magician who exhibited the Veiled Lady--and who, by the bye, was <\p> 
<p> the handsomest man in the whole world--had bartered his own soul for <\p> 
<p> seven years' possession of a familiar fiend, and that the last year of <\p> 
<p> the contract was wearing towards its close. <\p> 

<p> If it were worth our while, I could keep you till an hour beyond <\p> 
<p> midnight listening to a thousand such absurdities as these.  But <\p> 
<p> finally our friend Theodore, who prided himself upon his common-sense, <\p> 
<p> found the matter getting quite beyond his patience. <\p> 

<p> "I offer any wager you like," cried he, setting down his glass so <\p> 
<p> forcibly as to break the stem of it, "that this very evening I find out <\p> 
<p> the mystery of the Veiled Lady!" <\p> 

<p> Young men, I am told, boggle at nothing over their wine; so, after a <\p> 
<p> little more talk, a wager of considerable amount was actually laid, the <\p> 
<p> money staked, and Theodore left to choose his own method of settling <\p> 
<p> the dispute. <\p> 

<p> How he managed it I know not, nor is it of any great importance to this <\p> 
<p> veracious legend.  The most natural way, to be sure, was by bribing the <\p> 
<p> doorkeeper,--or possibly he preferred clambering in at the window. <\p> 
<p> But, at any rate, that very evening, while the exhibition was going <\p> 
<p> forward in the hall, Theodore contrived to gain admittance into the <\p> 
<p> private withdrawing-room whither the Veiled Lady was accustomed to <\p> 
<p> retire at the close of her performances.  There he waited, listening, I <\p> 
<p> suppose, to the stifled hum of the great audience; and no doubt he <\p> 
<p> could distinguish the deep tones of the magician, causing the wonders <\p> 
<p> that he wrought to appear more dark and intricate, by his mystic <\p> 
<p> pretence of an explanation.  Perhaps, too, in the intervals of the wild <\p> 
<p> breezy music which accompanied the exhibition, he might hear the low <\p> 
<p> voice of the Veiled Lady, conveying her sibylline responses.  Firm as <\p> 
<p> Theodore's nerves might be, and much as he prided himself on his sturdy <\p> 
<p> perception of realities, I should not be surprised if his heart <\p> 
<p> throbbed at a little more than its ordinary rate. <\p> 

<p> Theodore concealed himself behind a screen.  In due time the <\p> 
<p> performance was brought to a close, and whether the door was softly <\p> 
<p> opened, or whether her bodiless presence came through the wall, is more <\p> 
<p> than I can say, but, all at once, without the young man's knowing how <\p> 
<p> it happened, a veiled figure stood in the centre of the room.  It was <\p> 
<p> one thing to be in presence of this mystery in the hall of exhibition, <\p> 
<p> where the warm, dense life of hundreds of other mortals kept up the <\p> 
<p> beholder's courage, and distributed her influence among so many; it was <\p> 
<p> another thing to be quite alone with her, and that, too, with a <\p> 
<p> hostile, or, at least, an unauthorized and unjustifiable purpose.  I <\p> 
<p> further imagine that Theodore now began to be sensible of something <\p> 
<p> more serious in his enterprise than he had been quite aware of while he <\p> 
<p> sat with his boon-companions over their sparkling wine. <\p> 

<p> Very strange, it must be confessed, was the movement with which the <\p> 
<p> figure floated to and fro over the carpet, with the silvery veil <\p> 
<p> covering her from head to foot; so impalpable, so ethereal, so without <\p> 
<p> substance, as the texture seemed, yet hiding her every outline in an <\p> 
<p> impenetrability like that of midnight.  Surely, she did not walk!  She <\p> 
<p> floated, and flitted, and hovered about the room; no sound of a <\p> 
<p> footstep, no perceptible motion of a limb; it was as if a wandering <\p> 
<p> breeze wafted her before it, at its own wild and gentle pleasure.  But, <\p> 
<p> by and by, a purpose began to be discernible, throughout the seeming <\p> 
<p> vagueness of her unrest.  She was in quest of something.  Could it be <\p> 
<p> that a subtile presentiment had informed her of the young man's <\p> 
<p> presence?  And if so, did the Veiled Lady seek or did she shun him? <\p> 
<p> The doubt in Theodore's mind was speedily resolved; for, after a moment <\p> 
<p> or two of these erratic flutterings, she advanced more decidedly, and <\p> 
<p> stood motionless before the screen. <\p> 

<p> "Thou art here!" said a soft, low voice.  "Come forth, Theodore!" Thus <\p> 
<p> summoned by his name, Theodore, as a man of courage, had no choice.  He <\p> 
<p> emerged from his concealment, and presented himself before the Veiled <\p> 
<p> Lady, with the wine-flush, it may be, quite gone out of his cheeks. <\p> 

<p> "What wouldst thou with me?" she inquired, with the same gentle <\p> 
<p> composure that was in her former utterance. <\p> 

<p> "Mysterious creature," replied Theodore, "I would know who and what you <\p> 
<p> are!" <\p> 

<p> "My lips are forbidden to betray the secret," said the Veiled Lady. <\p> 

<p> "At whatever risk, I must discover it," rejoined Theodore. <\p> 

<p> "Then," said the Mystery, "there is no way save to lift my veil." <\p> 

<p> And Theodore, partly recovering his audacity, stept forward on the <\p> 
<p> instant, to do as the Veiled Lady had suggested.  But she floated <\p> 
<p> backward to the opposite side of the room, as if the young man's breath <\p> 
<p> had possessed power enough to waft her away. <\p> 

<p> "Pause, one little instant," said the soft, low voice, "and learn the <\p> 
<p> conditions of what thou art so bold to undertake.  Thou canst go hence, <\p> 
<p> and think of me no more; or, at thy option, thou canst lift this <\p> 
<p> mysterious veil, beneath which I am a sad and lonely prisoner, in a <\p> 
<p> bondage which is worse to me than death.  But, before raising it, I <\p> 
<p> entreat thee, in all maiden modesty, to bend forward and impress a kiss <\p> 
<p> where my breath stirs the veil; and my virgin lips shall come forward <\p> 
<p> to meet thy lips; and from that instant, Theodore, thou shalt be mine, <\p> 
<p> and I thine, with never more a veil between us.  And all the felicity <\p> 
<p> of earth and of the future world shall be thine and mine together.  So <\p> 
<p> much may a maiden say behind the veil.  If thou shrinkest from this, <\p> 
<p> there is yet another way."  "And what is that?" asked Theodore.  "Dost <\p> 
<p> thou hesitate," said the Veiled Lady, "to pledge thyself to me, by <\p> 
<p> meeting these lips of mine, while the veil yet hides my face?  Has not <\p> 
<p> thy heart recognized me?  Dost thou come hither, not in holy faith, nor <\p> 
<p> with a pure and generous purpose, but in scornful scepticism and idle <\p> 
<p> curiosity?  Still, thou mayest lift the veil!  But, from that instant, <\p> 
<p> Theodore, I am doomed to be thy evil fate; nor wilt thou ever taste <\p> 
<p> another breath of happiness!" <\p> 

<p> There was a shade of inexpressible sadness in the utterance of these <\p> 
<p> last words.  But Theodore, whose natural tendency was towards <\p> 
<p> scepticism, felt himself almost injured and insulted by the Veiled <\p> 
<p> Lady's proposal that he should pledge himself, for life and eternity, <\p> 
<p> to so questionable a creature as herself; or even that she should <\p> 
<p> suggest an inconsequential kiss, taking into view the probability that <\p> 
<p> her face was none of the most bewitching.  A delightful idea, truly, <\p> 
<p> that he should salute the lips of a dead girl, or the jaws of a <\p> 
<p> skeleton, or the grinning cavity of a monster's mouth!  Even should she <\p> 
<p> prove a comely maiden enough in other respects, the odds were ten to <\p> 
<p> one that her teeth were defective; a terrible drawback on the <\p> 
<p> delectableness of a kiss. <\p> 

<p> "Excuse me, fair lady," said Theodore, and I think he nearly burst into <\p> 
<p> a laugh, "if I prefer to lift the veil first; and for this affair of <\p> 
<p> the kiss, we may decide upon it afterwards." <\p> 

<p> "Thou hast made thy choice," said the sweet, sad voice behind the veil; <\p> 
<p> and there seemed a tender but unresentful sense of wrong done to <\p> 
<p> womanhood by the young man's contemptuous interpretation of her offer. <\p> 
<p> "I must not counsel thee to pause, although thy fate is still in thine <\p> 
<p> own hand!" <\p> 

<p> Grasping at the veil, he flung it upward, and caught a glimpse of a <\p> 
<p> pale, lovely face beneath; just one momentary glimpse, and then the <\p> 
<p> apparition vanished, and the silvery veil fluttered slowly down and lay <\p> 
<p> upon the floor.  Theodore was alone.  Our legend leaves him there. His <\p> 
<p> retribution was, to pine forever and ever for another sight of that <\p> 
<p> dim, mournful face,--which might have been his life-long household <\p> 
<p> fireside joy,--to desire, and waste life in a feverish quest, and never <\p> 
<p> meet it more. <\p> 

<p> But what, in good sooth, had become of the Veiled Lady?  Had all her <\p> 
<p> existence been comprehended within that mysterious veil, and was she <\p> 
<p> now annihilated?  Or was she a spirit, with a heavenly essence, but <\p> 
<p> which might have been tamed down to human bliss, had Theodore been <\p> 
<p> brave and true enough to claim her?  Hearken, my sweet friends,--and <\p> 
<p> hearken, dear Priscilla,--and you shall learn the little more that <\p> 
<p> Zenobia can tell you. <\p> 

<p> Just at the moment, so far as can be ascertained, when the Veiled Lady <\p> 
<p> vanished, a maiden, pale and shadowy, rose up amid a knot of visionary <\p> 
<p> people, who were seeking for the better life.  She was so gentle and so <\p> 
<p> sad,--a nameless melancholy gave her such hold upon their <\p> 
<p> sympathies,--that they never thought of questioning whence she came. <\p> 
<p> She might have heretofore existed, or her thin substance might have <\p> 
<p> been moulded out of air at the very instant when they first beheld her. <\p> 
<p> It was all one to them; they took her to their hearts. Among them was a <\p> 
<p> lady to whom, more than to all the rest, this pale, mysterious girl <\p> 
<p> attached herself. <\p> 

<p> But one morning the lady was wandering in the woods, and there met her <\p> 
<p> a figure in an Oriental robe, with a dark beard, and holding in his <\p> 
<p> hand a silvery veil.  He motioned her to stay.  Being a woman of some <\p> 
<p> nerve, she did not shriek, nor run away, nor faint, as many ladies <\p> 
<p> would have been apt to do, but stood quietly, and bade him speak.  The <\p> 
<p> truth was, she had seen his face before, but had never feared it, <\p> 
<p> although she knew him to be a terrible magician. <\p> 

<p> "Lady," said he, with a warning gesture, "you are in peril!"  "Peril!" <\p> 
<p> she exclaimed.  "And of what nature?" <\p> 

<p> "There is a certain maiden," replied the magician, "who has come out of <\p> 
<p> the realm of mystery, and made herself your most intimate companion. <\p> 
<p> Now, the fates have so ordained it, that, whether by her own will or <\p> 
<p> no, this stranger is your deadliest enemy.  In love, in worldly <\p> 
<p> fortune, in all your pursuit of happiness, she is doomed to fling a <\p> 
<p> blight over your prospects.  There is but one possibility of thwarting <\p> 
<p> her disastrous influence." <\p> 

<p> "Then tell me that one method," said the lady. <\p> 

<p> "Take this veil," he answered, holding forth the silvery texture. "It <\p> 
<p> is a spell; it is a powerful enchantment, which I wrought for her sake, <\p> 
<p> and beneath which she was once my prisoner.  Throw it, at unawares, <\p> 
<p> over the head of this secret foe, stamp your foot, and cry, 'Arise, <\p> 
<p> Magician!  Here is the Veiled Lady!' and immediately I will rise up <\p> 
<p> through the earth, and seize her; and from that moment you are safe!" <\p> 

<p> So the lady took the silvery veil, which was like woven air, or like <\p> 
<p> some substance airier than nothing, and that would float upward and be <\p> 
<p> lost among the clouds, were she once to let it go.  Returning homeward, <\p> 
<p> she found the shadowy girl amid the knot of visionary <\p> 
<p> transcendentalists, who were still seeking for the better life.  She <\p> 
<p> was joyous now, and had a rose-bloom in her cheeks, and was one of the <\p> 
<p> prettiest creatures, and seemed one of the happiest, that the world <\p> 
<p> could show.  But the lady stole noiselessly behind her and threw the <\p> 
<p> veil over her head.  As the slight, ethereal texture sank inevitably <\p> 
<p> down over her figure, the poor girl strove to raise it, and met her <\p> 
<p> dear friend's eyes with one glance of mortal terror, and deep, deep <\p> 
<p> reproach.  It could not change her purpose. <\p> 

<p> "Arise, Magician!" she exclaimed, stamping her foot upon the earth. <\p> 
<p> "Here is the Veiled Lady!" <\p> 

<p> At the word, up rose the bearded man in the Oriental robes,--the <\p> 
<p> beautiful, the dark magician, who had bartered away his soul!  He threw <\p> 
<p> his arms around the Veiled Lady, and she was his bond-slave for <\p> 
<p> evermore! <\p> 
<p> Zenobia, all this while, had been holding the piece of gauze, and so <\p> 
<p> managed it as greatly to increase the dramatic effect of the legend at <\p> 
<p> those points where the magic veil was to be described.  Arriving at the <\p> 
<p> catastrophe, and uttering the fatal words, she flung the gauze over <\p> 
<p> Priscilla's head; and for an instant her auditors held their breath, <\p> 
<p> half expecting, I verily believe, that the magician would start up <\p> 
<p> through the floor, and carry off our poor little friend before our eyes. <\p> 

<p> As for Priscilla, she stood droopingly in the midst of us, making no <\p> 
<p> attempt to remove the veil. <\p> 

<p> "How do you find yourself, my love?" said Zenobia, lifting a corner of <\p> 
<p> the gauze, and peeping beneath it with a mischievous smile.  "Ah, the <\p> 
<p> dear little soul!  Why, she is really going to faint!  Mr. Coverdale, <\p> 
<p> Mr. Coverdale, pray bring a glass of water!" <\p> 

<p> Her nerves being none of the strongest, Priscilla hardly recovered her <\p> 
<p> equanimity during the rest of the evening.  This, to be sure, was a <\p> 
<p> great pity; but, nevertheless, we thought it a very bright idea of <\p> 
<p> Zenobia's to bring her legend to so effective a conclusion. <\p> 

<p> XIV. ELIOT'S PULPIT <\p> 

<p> Our Sundays at Blithedale were not ordinarily kept with such rigid <\p> 
<p> observance as might have befitted the descendants of the Pilgrims, <\p> 
<p> whose high enterprise, as we sometimes flattered ourselves, we had <\p> 
<p> taken up, and were carrying it onward and aloft, to a point which they <\p> 
<p> never dreamed of attaining. <\p> 

<p> On that hallowed day, it is true, we rested from our labors.  Our oxen, <\p> 
<p> relieved from their week-day yoke, roamed at large through the pasture; <\p> 
<p> each yoke-fellow, however, keeping close beside his mate, and <\p> 
<p> continuing to acknowledge, from the force of habit and sluggish <\p> 
<p> sympathy, the union which the taskmaster had imposed for his own hard <\p> 
<p> ends.  As for us human yoke-fellows, chosen companions of toil, whose <\p> 
<p> hoes had clinked together throughout the week, we wandered off, in <\p> 
<p> various directions, to enjoy our interval of repose.  Some, I believe, <\p> 
<p> went devoutly to the village church.  Others, it may be, ascended a <\p> 
<p> city or a country pulpit, wearing the clerical robe with so much <\p> 
<p> dignity that you would scarcely have suspected the yeoman's frock to <\p> 
<p> have been flung off only since milking-time.  Others took long rambles <\p> 
<p> among the rustic lanes and by-paths, pausing to look at black old <\p> 
<p> farmhouses, with their sloping roofs; and at the modern cottage, so <\p> 
<p> like a plaything that it seemed as if real joy or sorrow could have no <\p> 
<p> scope within; and at the more pretending villa, with its range of <\p> 
<p> wooden columns supporting the needless insolence of a great portico. <\p> 
<p> Some betook themselves into the wide, dusky barn, and lay there for <\p> 
<p> hours together on the odorous hay; while the sunstreaks and the shadows <\p> 
<p> strove together,--these to make the barn solemn, those to make it <\p> 
<p> cheerful,--and both were conquerors; and the swallows twittered a <\p> 
<p> cheery anthem, flashing into sight, or vanishing as they darted to and <\p> 
<p> fro among the golden rules of sunshine.  And others went a little way <\p> 
<p> into the woods, and threw themselves on mother earth, pillowing their <\p> 
<p> heads on a heap of moss, the green decay of an old log; and, dropping <\p> 
<p> asleep, the bumblebees and mosquitoes sung and buzzed about their ears, <\p> 
<p> causing the slumberers to twitch and start, without awaking. <\p> 

<p> With Hollingsworth, Zenobia, Priscilla, and myself, it grew to be a <\p> 
<p> custom to spend the Sabbath afternoon at a certain rock.  It was known <\p> 
<p> to us under the name of Eliot's pulpit, from a tradition that the <\p> 
<p> venerable Apostle Eliot had preached there, two centuries gone by, to <\p> 
<p> an Indian auditory.  The old pine forest, through which the Apostle's <\p> 
<p> voice was wont to sound, had fallen an immemorial time ago. But the <\p> 
<p> soil, being of the rudest and most broken surface, had apparently never <\p> 
<p> been brought under tillage; other growths, maple and beech and birch, <\p> 
<p> had succeeded to the primeval trees; so that it was still as wild a <\p> 
<p> tract of woodland as the great-great-great-great grandson of one of <\p> 
<p> Eliot's Indians (had any such posterity been in existence) could have <\p> 
<p> desired for the site and shelter of his wigwam. These after-growths, <\p> 
<p> indeed, lose the stately solemnity of the original forest.  If left in <\p> 
<p> due neglect, however, they run into an entanglement of softer wildness, <\p> 
<p> among the rustling leaves of which the sun can scatter cheerfulness as <\p> 
<p> it never could among the dark-browed pines. <\p> 

<p> The rock itself rose some twenty or thirty feet, a shattered granite <\p> 
<p> bowlder, or heap of bowlders, with an irregular outline and many <\p> 
<p> fissures, out of which sprang shrubs, bushes, and even trees; as if the <\p> 
<p> scanty soil within those crevices were sweeter to their roots than any <\p> 
<p> other earth.  At the base of the pulpit, the broken bowlders inclined <\p> 
<p> towards each other, so as to form a shallow cave, within which our <\p> 
<p> little party had sometimes found protection from a summer shower.  On <\p> 
<p> the threshold, or just across it, grew a tuft of pale columbines, in <\p> 
<p> their season, and violets, sad and shadowy recluses, such as Priscilla <\p> 
<p> was when we first knew her; children of the sun, who had never seen <\p> 
<p> their father, but dwelt among damp mosses, though not akin to them.  At <\p> 
<p> the summit, the rock was overshadowed by the canopy of a birch-tree, <\p> 
<p> which served as a sounding-board for the pulpit.  Beneath this shade <\p> 
<p> (with my eyes of sense half shut and those of the imagination widely <\p> 
<p> opened) I used to see the holy Apostle of the Indians, with the <\p> 
<p> sunlight flickering down upon him through the leaves, and glorifying <\p> 
<p> his figure as with the half-perceptible glow of a transfiguration. <\p> 

<p> I the more minutely describe the rock, and this little Sabbath <\p> 
<p> solitude, because Hollingsworth, at our solicitation, often ascended <\p> 
<p> Eliot's pulpit, and not exactly preached, but talked to us, his few <\p> 
<p> disciples, in a strain that rose and fell as naturally as the wind's <\p> 
<p> breath among the leaves of the birch-tree.  No other speech of man has <\p> 
<p> ever moved me like some of those discourses.  It seemed most pitiful--a <\p> 
<p> positive calamity to the world--that a treasury of golden thoughts <\p> 
<p> should thus be scattered, by the liberal handful, down among us three, <\p> 
<p> when a thousand hearers might have been the richer for them; and <\p> 
<p> Hollingsworth the richer, likewise, by the sympathy of multitudes. <\p> 
<p> After speaking much or little, as might happen, he would descend from <\p> 
<p> his gray pulpit, and generally fling himself at full length on the <\p> 
<p> ground, face downward.  Meanwhile, we talked around him on such topics <\p> 
<p> as were suggested by the discourse. <\p> 

<p> Since her interview with Westervelt, Zenobia's continual inequalities <\p> 
<p> of temper had been rather difficult for her friends to bear.  On the <\p> 
<p> first Sunday after that incident, when Hollingsworth had clambered down <\p> 
<p> from Eliot's pulpit, she declaimed with great earnestness and passion, <\p> 
<p> nothing short of anger, on the injustice which the world did to women, <\p> 
<p> and equally to itself, by not allowing them, in freedom and honor, and <\p> 
<p> with the fullest welcome, their natural utterance in public. <\p> 

<p> "It shall not always be so!" cried she.  "If I live another year, I <\p> 
<p> will lift up my own voice in behalf of woman's wider liberty!" <\p> 

<p> She perhaps saw me smile. <\p> 

<p> "What matter of ridicule do you find in this, Miles Coverdale?" <\p> 
<p> exclaimed Zenobia, with a flash of anger in her eyes.  "That smile, <\p> 
<p> permit me to say, makes me suspicious of a low tone of feeling and <\p> 
<p> shallow thought.  It is my belief--yes, and my prophecy, should I die <\p> 
<p> before it happens--that, when my sex shall achieve its rights, there <\p> 
<p> will be ten eloquent women where there is now one eloquent man.  Thus <\p> 
<p> far, no woman in the world has ever once spoken out her whole heart and <\p> 
<p> her whole mind.  The mistrust and disapproval of the vast bulk of <\p> 
<p> society throttles us, as with two gigantic hands at our throats!  We <\p> 
<p> mumble a few weak words, and leave a thousand better ones unsaid. You <\p> 
<p> let us write a little, it is true, on a limited range of subjects. But <\p> 
<p> the pen is not for woman.  Her power is too natural and immediate.  It <\p> 
<p> is with the living voice alone that she can compel the world to <\p> 
<p> recognize the light of her intellect and the depth of her heart!" <\p> 

<p> Now,--though I could not well say so to Zenobia,--I had not smiled from <\p> 
<p> any unworthy estimate of woman, or in denial of the claims which she is <\p> 
<p> beginning to put forth.  What amused and puzzled me was the fact, that <\p> 
<p> women, however intellectually superior, so seldom disquiet themselves <\p> 
<p> about the rights or wrongs of their sex, unless their own individual <\p> 
<p> affections chance to lie in idleness, or to be ill at ease. They are <\p> 
<p> not natural reformers, but become such by the pressure of exceptional <\p> 
<p> misfortune.  I could measure Zenobia's inward trouble by the animosity <\p> 
<p> with which she now took up the general quarrel of woman against man. <\p> 

<p> "I will give you leave, Zenobia," replied I, "to fling your utmost <\p> 
<p> scorn upon me, if you ever hear me utter a sentiment unfavorable to the <\p> 
<p> widest liberty which woman has yet dreamed of.  I would give her all <\p> 
<p> she asks, and add a great deal more, which she will not be the party to <\p> 
<p> demand, but which men, if they were generous and wise, would grant of <\p> 
<p> their own free motion.  For instance, I should love dearly--for the <\p> 
<p> next thousand years, at least--to have all government devolve into the <\p> 
<p> hands of women.  I hate to be ruled by my own sex; it excites my <\p> 
<p> jealousy, and wounds my pride.  It is the iron sway of bodily force <\p> 
<p> which abases us, in our compelled submission.  But how sweet the free, <\p> 
<p> generous courtesy with which I would kneel before a woman-ruler!" <\p> 

<p> "Yes, if she were young and beautiful," said Zenobia, laughing.  "But <\p> 
<p> how if she were sixty, and a fright?" <\p> 

<p> "Ah! it is you that rate womanhood low," said I. "But let me go on. I <\p> 
<p> have never found it possible to suffer a bearded priest so near my <\p> 
<p> heart and conscience as to do me any spiritual good.  I blush at the <\p> 
<p> very thought!  Oh, in the better order of things, Heaven grant that the <\p> 
<p> ministry of souls may be left in charge of women!  The gates of the <\p> 
<p> Blessed City will be thronged with the multitude that enter in, when <\p> 
<p> that day comes!  The task belongs to woman.  God meant it for her.  He <\p> 
<p> has endowed her with the religious sentiment in its utmost depth and <\p> 
<p> purity, refined from that gross, intellectual alloy with which every <\p> 
<p> masculine theologist--save only One, who merely veiled himself in <\p> 
<p> mortal and masculine shape, but was, in truth, divine--has been prone <\p> 
<p> to mingle it.  I have always envied the Catholics their faith in that <\p> 
<p> sweet, sacred Virgin Mother, who stands between them and the Deity, <\p> 
<p> intercepting somewhat of his awful splendor, but permitting his love to <\p> 
<p> stream upon the worshipper more intelligibly to human comprehension <\p> 
<p> through the medium of a woman's tenderness. Have I not said enough, <\p> 
<p> Zenobia?" <\p> 

<p> "I cannot think that this is true," observed Priscilla, who had been <\p> 
<p> gazing at me with great, disapproving eyes.  "And I am sure I do not <\p> 
<p> wish it to be true!" <\p> 

<p> "Poor child!" exclaimed Zenobia, rather contemptuously.  "She is the <\p> 
<p> type of womanhood, such as man has spent centuries in making it.  He is <\p> 
<p> never content unless he can degrade himself by stooping towards what he <\p> 
<p> loves.  In denying us our rights, he betrays even more blindness to his <\p> 
<p> own interests than profligate disregard of ours!" <\p> 

<p> "Is this true?" asked Priscilla with simplicity, turning to <\p> 
<p> Hollingsworth.  "Is it all true, that Mr. Coverdale and Zenobia have <\p> 
<p> been saying?" <\p> 

<p> "No, Priscilla!" answered Hollingsworth with his customary bluntness. <\p> 
<p> "They have neither of them spoken one true word yet." <\p> 

<p> "Do you despise woman?" said Zenobia. <\p> 

<p> "Ah, Hollingsworth, that would be most ungrateful!" <\p> 

<p> "Despise her?  No!" cried Hollingsworth, lifting his great shaggy head <\p> 
<p> and shaking it at us, while his eyes glowed almost fiercely. "She is <\p> 
<p> the most admirable handiwork of God, in her true place and character. <\p> 
<p> Her place is at man's side.  Her office, that of the sympathizer; the <\p> 
<p> unreserved, unquestioning believer; the recognition, withheld in every <\p> 
<p> other manner, but given, in pity, through woman's heart, lest man <\p> 
<p> should utterly lose faith in himself; the echo of God's own voice, <\p> 
<p> pronouncing, 'It is well done!' All the separate action of woman is, <\p> 
<p> and ever has been, and always shall be, false, foolish, vain, <\p> 
<p> destructive of her own best and holiest qualities, void of every good <\p> 
<p> effect, and productive of intolerable mischiefs! Man is a wretch <\p> 
<p> without woman; but woman is a monster--and, thank Heaven, an almost <\p> 
<p> impossible and hitherto imaginary monster--without man as her <\p> 
<p> acknowledged principal!  As true as I had once a mother whom I loved, <\p> 
<p> were there any possible prospect of woman's taking the social stand <\p> 
<p> which some of them,--poor, miserable, abortive creatures, who only <\p> 
<p> dream of such things because they have missed woman's peculiar <\p> 
<p> happiness, or because nature made them really neither man nor <\p> 
<p> woman!--if there were a chance of their attaining the end which these <\p> 
<p> petticoated monstrosities have in view, I would call upon my own sex to <\p> 
<p> use its physical force, that unmistakable evidence of sovereignty, to <\p> 
<p> scourge them back within their proper bounds!  But it will not be <\p> 
<p> needful.  The heart of time womanhood knows where its own sphere is, <\p> 
<p> and never seeks to stray beyond it!" <\p> 

<p> Never was mortal blessed--if blessing it were--with a glance of such <\p> 
<p> entire acquiescence and unquestioning faith, happy in its completeness, <\p> 
<p> as our little Priscilla unconsciously bestowed on Hollingsworth.  She <\p> 
<p> seemed to take the sentiment from his lips into her heart, and brood <\p> 
<p> over it in perfect content.  The very woman whom he pictured--the <\p> 
<p> gentle parasite, the soft reflection of a more powerful existence--sat <\p> 
<p> there at his feet. <\p> 

<p> I looked at Zenobia, however, fully expecting her to resent--as I felt, <\p> 
<p> by the indignant ebullition of my own blood, that she ought this <\p> 
<p> outrageous affirmation of what struck me as the intensity of masculine <\p> 
<p> egotism.  It centred everything in itself, and deprived woman of her <\p> 
<p> very soul, her inexpressible and unfathomable all, to make it a mere <\p> 
<p> incident in the great sum of man.  Hollingsworth had boldly uttered <\p> 
<p> what he, and millions of despots like him, really felt. Without <\p> 
<p> intending it, he had disclosed the wellspring of all these troubled <\p> 
<p> waters.  Now, if ever, it surely behooved Zenobia to be the champion of <\p> 
<p> her sex. <\p> 

<p> But, to my surprise, and indignation too, she only looked humbled. Some <\p> 
<p> tears sparkled in her eyes, but they were wholly of grief, not anger. <\p> 

<p> "Well, be it so," was all she said.  "I, at least, have deep cause to <\p> 
<p> think you right.  Let man be but manly and godlike, and woman is only <\p> 
<p> too ready to become to him what you say!" <\p> 

<p> I smiled--somewhat bitterly, it is true--in contemplation of my own <\p> 
<p> ill-luck.  How little did these two women care for me, who had freely <\p> 
<p> conceded all their claims, and a great deal more, out of the fulness of <\p> 
<p> my heart; while Hollingsworth, by some necromancy of his horrible <\p> 
<p> injustice, seemed to have brought them both to his feet! <\p> 

<p> "Women almost invariably behave thus," thought I. "What does the fact <\p> 
<p> mean?  Is it their nature?  Or is it, at last, the result of ages of <\p> 
<p> compelled degradation?  And, in either case, will it be possible ever <\p> 
<p> to redeem them?" <\p> 

<p> An intuition now appeared to possess all the party, that, for this <\p> 
<p> time, at least, there was no more to be said.  With one accord, we <\p> 
<p> arose from the ground, and made our way through the tangled undergrowth <\p> 
<p> towards one of those pleasant wood-paths that wound among the <\p> 
<p> overarching trees.  Some of the branches hung so low as partly to <\p> 
<p> conceal the figures that went before from those who followed. Priscilla <\p> 
<p> had leaped up more lightly than the rest of us, and ran along in <\p> 
<p> advance, with as much airy activity of spirit as was typified in the <\p> 
<p> motion of a bird, which chanced to be flitting from tree to tree, in <\p> 
<p> the same direction as herself.  Never did she seem so happy as that <\p> 
<p> afternoon.  She skipt, and could not help it, from very playfulness of <\p> 
<p> heart. <\p> 

<p> Zenobia and Hollingsworth went next, in close contiguity, but not with <\p> 
<p> arm in arm.  Now, just when they had passed the impending bough of a <\p> 
<p> birch-tree, I plainly saw Zenobia take the hand of Hollingsworth in <\p> 
<p> both her own, press it to her bosom, and let it fall again! <\p> 

<p> The gesture was sudden, and full of passion; the impulse had evidently <\p> 
<p> taken her by surprise; it expressed all!  Had Zenobia knelt before him, <\p> 
<p> or flung herself upon his breast, and gasped out, "I love you, <\p> 
<p> Hollingsworth!"  I could not have been more certain of what it meant. <\p> 
<p> They then walked onward, as before.  But, methought, as the declining <\p> 
<p> sun threw Zenobia's magnified shadow along the path, I beheld it <\p> 
<p> tremulous; and the delicate stem of the flower which she wore in her <\p> 
<p> hair was likewise responsive to her agitation. <\p> 

<p> Priscilla--through the medium of her eyes, at least could not possibly <\p> 
<p> have been aware of the gesture above described.  Yet, at that instant, <\p> 
<p> I saw her droop.  The buoyancy, which just before had been so <\p> 
<p> bird-like, was utterly departed; the life seemed to pass out of her, <\p> 
<p> and even the substance of her figure to grow thin and gray. I almost <\p> 
<p> imagined her a shadow, tiding gradually into the dimness of the wood. <\p> 
<p> Her pace became so slow that Hollingsworth and Zenobia passed by, and <\p> 
<p> I, without hastening my footsteps, overtook her. <\p> 

<p> "Come, Priscilla," said I, looking her intently in the face, which was <\p> 
<p> very pale and sorrowful, "we must make haste after our friends. Do you <\p> 
<p> feel suddenly ill?  A moment ago, you flitted along so lightly that I <\p> 
<p> was comparing you to a bird.  Now, on the contrary, it is as if you had <\p> 
<p> a heavy heart, and a very little strength to bear it with. Pray take my <\p> 
<p> arm!" <\p> 

<p> "No," said Priscilla, "I do not think it would help me.  It is my <\p> 
<p> heart, as you say, that makes me heavy; and I know not why.  Just now, <\p> 
<p> I felt very happy." <\p> 

<p> No doubt it was a kind of sacrilege in me to attempt to come within her <\p> 
<p> maidenly mystery; but, as she appeared to be tossed aside by her other <\p> 
<p> friends, or carelessly let fall, like a flower which they had done <\p> 
<p> with, I could not resist the impulse to take just one peep beneath her <\p> 
<p> folded petals. <\p> 

<p> "Zenobia and yourself are dear friends of late," I remarked.  "At <\p> 
<p> first,--that first evening when you came to us,--she did not receive <\p> 
<p> you quite so warmly as might have been wished." <\p> 

<p> "I remember it," said Priscilla.  "No wonder she hesitated to love me, <\p> 
<p> who was then a stranger to her, and a girl of no grace or beauty,--she <\p> 
<p> being herself so beautiful!" <\p> 

<p> "But she loves you now, of course?" suggested I. "And at this very <\p> 
<p> instant you feel her to be your dearest friend?" <\p> 

<p> "Why do you ask me that question?" exclaimed Priscilla, as if <\p> 
<p> frightened at the scrutiny into her feelings which I compelled her to <\p> 
<p> make.  "It somehow puts strange thoughts into my mind.  But I do love <\p> 
<p> Zenobia dearly!  If she only loves me half as well, I shall be happy!" <\p> 

<p> "How is it possible to doubt that, Priscilla?"  I rejoined.  "But <\p> 
<p> observe how pleasantly and happily Zenobia and Hollingsworth are <\p> 
<p> walking together.  I call it a delightful spectacle.  It truly rejoices <\p> 
<p> me that Hollingsworth has found so fit and affectionate a friend!  So <\p> 
<p> many people in the world mistrust him,--so many disbelieve and <\p> 
<p> ridicule, while hardly any do him justice, or acknowledge him for the <\p> 
<p> wonderful man he is,--that it is really a blessed thing for him to have <\p> 
<p> won the sympathy of such a woman as Zenobia.  Any man might be proud of <\p> 
<p> that.  Any man, even if he be as great as Hollingsworth, might love so <\p> 
<p> magnificent a woman.  How very beautiful Zenobia is!  And Hollingsworth <\p> 
<p> knows it, too." <\p> 

<p> There may have been some petty malice in what I said.  Generosity is a <\p> 
<p> very fine thing, at a proper time and within due limits.  But it is an <\p> 
<p> insufferable bore to see one man engrossing every thought of all the <\p> 
<p> women, and leaving his friend to shiver in outer seclusion, without <\p> 
<p> even the alternative of solacing himself with what the more fortunate <\p> 
<p> individual has rejected.  Yes, it was out of a foolish bitterness of <\p> 
<p> heart that I had spoken. <\p> 

<p> "Go on before," said Priscilla abruptly, and with true feminine <\p> 
<p> imperiousness, which heretofore I had never seen her exercise.  "It <\p> 
<p> pleases me best to loiter along by myself.  I do not walk so fast as <\p> 
<p> you." <\p> 

<p> With her hand she made a little gesture of dismissal.  It provoked me; <\p> 
<p> yet, on the whole, was the most bewitching thing that Priscilla had <\p> 
<p> ever done.  I obeyed her, and strolled moodily homeward, wondering--as <\p> 
<p> I had wondered a thousand times already--how Hollingsworth meant to <\p> 
<p> dispose of these two hearts, which (plainly to my perception, and, as I <\p> 
<p> could not but now suppose, to his) he had engrossed into his own huge <\p> 
<p> egotism. <\p> 

<p> There was likewise another subject hardly less fruitful of speculation. <\p> 
<p> In what attitude did Zenobia present herself to Hollingsworth?  Was it <\p> 
<p> in that of a free woman, with no mortgage on her affections nor <\p> 
<p> claimant to her hand, but fully at liberty to surrender both, in <\p> 
<p> exchange for the heart and hand which she apparently expected to <\p> 
<p> receive?  But was it a vision that I had witnessed in the wood?  Was <\p> 
<p> Westervelt a goblin?  Were those words of passion and agony, which <\p> 
<p> Zenobia had uttered in my hearing, a mere stage declamation?  Were they <\p> 
<p> formed of a material lighter than common air?  Or, supposing them to <\p> 
<p> bear sterling weight, was it a perilous and dreadful wrong which she <\p> 
<p> was meditating towards herself and Hollingsworth? <\p> 

<p> Arriving nearly at the farmhouse, I looked back over the long slope of <\p> 
<p> pasture land, and beheld them standing together, in the light of <\p> 
<p> sunset, just on the spot where, according to the gossip of the <\p> 
<p> Community, they meant to build their cottage.  Priscilla, alone and <\p> 
<p> forgotten, was lingering in the shadow of the wood. <\p> 

<p> XV. A CRISIS <\p> 

<p> Thus the summer was passing away,--a summer of toil, of interest, of <\p> 
<p> something that was not pleasure, but which went deep into my heart, and <\p> 
<p> there became a rich experience.  I found myself looking forward to <\p> 
<p> years, if not to a lifetime, to be spent on the same system.  The <\p> 
<p> Community were now beginning to form their permanent plans.  One of our <\p> 
<p> purposes was to erect a Phalanstery (as I think we called it, after <\p> 
<p> Fourier; but the phraseology of those days is not very fresh in my <\p> 
<p> remembrance), where the great and general family should have its <\p> 
<p> abiding-place.  Individual members, too, who made it a point of <\p> 
<p> religion to preserve the sanctity of an exclusive home, were selecting <\p> 
<p> sites for their cottages, by the wood-side, or on the breezy swells, or <\p> 
<p> in the sheltered nook of some little valley, according as their taste <\p> 
<p> might lean towards snugness or the picturesque.  Altogether, by <\p> 
<p> projecting our minds outward, we had imparted a show of novelty to <\p> 
<p> existence, and contemplated it as hopefully as if the soil beneath our <\p> 
<p> feet had not been fathom-deep with the dust of deluded generations, on <\p> 
<p> every one of which, as on ourselves, the world had imposed itself as a <\p> 
<p> hitherto unwedded bride. <\p> 

<p> Hollingsworth and myself had often discussed these prospects.  It was <\p> 
<p> easy to perceive, however, that he spoke with little or no fervor, but <\p> 
<p> either as questioning the fulfilment of our anticipations, or, at any <\p> 
<p> rate, with a quiet consciousness that it was no personal concern of <\p> 
<p> his.  Shortly after the scene at Eliot's pulpit, while he and I were <\p> 
<p> repairing an old stone fence, I amused myself with sallying forward <\p> 
<p> into the future time. <\p> 

<p> "When we come to be old men," I said, "they will call us uncles, or <\p> 
<p> fathers,--Father Hollingsworth and Uncle Coverdale,--and we will look <\p> 
<p> back cheerfully to these early days, and make a romantic story for the <\p> 
<p> young People (and if a little more romantic than truth may warrant, it <\p> 
<p> will be no harm) out of our severe trials and hardships. In a century <\p> 
<p> or two, we shall, every one of us, be mythical personages, or <\p> 
<p> exceedingly picturesque and poetical ones, at all events.  They will <\p> 
<p> have a great public hall, in which your portrait, and mine, and twenty <\p> 
<p> other faces that are living now, shall be hung up; and as for me, I <\p> 
<p> will be painted in my shirtsleeves, and with the sleeves rolled up, to <\p> 
<p> show my muscular development.  What stories will be rife among them <\p> 
<p> about our mighty strength!" continued I, lifting a big stone and <\p> 
<p> putting it into its place, "though our posterity will really be far <\p> 
<p> stronger than ourselves, after several generations of a simple, <\p> 
<p> natural, and active life.  What legends of Zenobia's beauty, and <\p> 
<p> Priscilla's slender and shadowy grace, and those mysterious qualities <\p> 
<p> which make her seem diaphanous with spiritual light!  In due course of <\p> 
<p> ages, we must all figure heroically in an epic poem; and we will <\p> 
<p> ourselves--at least, I will--bend unseen over the future poet, and lend <\p> 
<p> him inspiration while he writes it." <\p> 

<p> "You seem," said Hollingsworth, "to be trying how much nonsense you can <\p> 
<p> pour out in a breath." <\p> 

<p> "I wish you would see fit to comprehend," retorted I, "that the <\p> 
<p> profoundest wisdom must be mingled with nine tenths of nonsense, else <\p> 
<p> it is not worth the breath that utters it.  But I do long for the <\p> 
<p> cottages to be built, that the creeping plants may begin to run over <\p> 
<p> them, and the moss to gather on the walls, and the trees--which we will <\p> 
<p> set out--to cover them with a breadth of shadow.  This spick-and-span <\p> 
<p> novelty does not quite suit my taste.  It is time, too, for children to <\p> 
<p> be born among us.  The first-born child is still to come.  And I shall <\p> 
<p> never feel as if this were a real, practical, as well as poetical <\p> 
<p> system of human life, until somebody has sanctified it by death." <\p> 

<p> "A pretty occasion for martyrdom, truly!" said Hollingsworth. <\p> 

<p> "As good as any other," I replied.  "I wonder, Hollingsworth, who, of <\p> 
<p> all these strong men, and fair women and maidens, is doomed the first <\p> 
<p> to die.  Would it not be well, even before we have absolute need of it, <\p> 
<p> to fix upon a spot for a cemetery?  Let us choose the rudest, roughest, <\p> 
<p> most uncultivable spot, for Death's garden ground; and Death shall <\p> 
<p> teach us to beautify it, grave by grave.  By our sweet, calm way of <\p> 
<p> dying, and the airy elegance out of which we will shape our funeral <\p> 
<p> rites, and the cheerful allegories which we will model into tombstones, <\p> 
<p> the final scene shall lose its terrors; so that hereafter it may be <\p> 
<p> happiness to live, and bliss to die.  None of us must die young.  Yet, <\p> 
<p> should Providence ordain it so, the event shall not be sorrowful, but <\p> 
<p> affect us with a tender, delicious, only half-melancholy, and almost <\p> 
<p> smiling pathos!" <\p> 

<p> "That is to say," muttered Hollingsworth, "you will die like a heathen, <\p> 
<p> as you certainly live like one.  But, listen to me, Coverdale.  Your <\p> 
<p> fantastic anticipations make me discern all the more forcibly what a <\p> 
<p> wretched, unsubstantial scheme is this, on which we have wasted a <\p> 
<p> precious summer of our lives.  Do you seriously imagine that any such <\p> 
<p> realities as you, and many others here, have dreamed of, will ever be <\p> 
<p> brought to pass?" <\p> 

<p> "Certainly I do," said I. "Of course, when the reality comes, it will <\p> 
<p> wear the every-day, commonplace, dusty, and rather homely garb that <\p> 
<p> reality always does put on.  But, setting aside the ideal charm, I hold <\p> 
<p> that our highest anticipations have a solid footing on common sense." <\p> 

<p> "You only half believe what you say," rejoined Hollingsworth; "and as <\p> 
<p> for me, I neither have faith in your dream, nor would care the value of <\p> 
<p> this pebble for its realization, were that possible.  And what more do <\p> 
<p> you want of it?  It has given you a theme for poetry.  Let that content <\p> 
<p> you.  But now I ask you to be, at last, a man of sobriety and <\p> 
<p> earnestness, and aid me in an enterprise which is worth all our <\p> 
<p> strength, and the strength of a thousand mightier than we." <\p> 

<p> There can be no need of giving in detail the conversation that ensued. <\p> 
<p> It is enough to say that Hollingsworth once more brought forward his <\p> 
<p> rigid and unconquerable idea,--a scheme for the reformation of the <\p> 
<p> wicked by methods moral, intellectual, and industrial, by the sympathy <\p> 
<p> of pure, humble, and yet exalted minds, and by opening to his pupils <\p> 
<p> the possibility of a worthier life than that which had become their <\p> 
<p> fate.  It appeared, unless he overestimated his own means, that <\p> 
<p> Hollingsworth held it at his choice (and he did so choose) to obtain <\p> 
<p> possession of the very ground on which we had planted our Community, <\p> 
<p> and which had not yet been made irrevocably ours, by purchase.  It was <\p> 
<p> just the foundation that he desired.  Our beginnings might readily be <\p> 
<p> adapted to his great end.  The arrangements already completed would <\p> 
<p> work quietly into his system. So plausible looked his theory, and, more <\p> 
<p> than that, so practical,--such an air of reasonableness had he, by <\p> 
<p> patient thought, thrown over it,--each segment of it was contrived to <\p> 
<p> dovetail into all the rest with such a complicated applicability, and <\p> 
<p> so ready was he with a response for every objection, that, really, so <\p> 
<p> far as logic and argument went, he had the matter all his own way. <\p> 

<p> "But," said I, "whence can you, having no means of your own, derive the <\p> 
<p> enormous capital which is essential to this experiment?  State Street, <\p> 
<p> I imagine, would not draw its purser strings very liberally in aid of <\p> 
<p> such a speculation." <\p> 

<p> "I have the funds--as much, at least, as is needed for a <\p> 
<p> commencement--at command," he answered.  "They can be produced within a <\p> 
<p> month, if necessary." <\p> 

<p> My thoughts reverted to Zenobia.  It could only be her wealth which <\p> 
<p> Hollingsworth was appropriating so lavishly.  And on what conditions <\p> 
<p> was it to be had?  Did she fling it into the scheme with the <\p> 
<p> uncalculating generosity that characterizes a woman when it is her <\p> 
<p> impulse to be generous at all?  And did she fling herself along with <\p> 
<p> it?  But Hollingsworth did not volunteer an explanation. <\p> 

<p> "And have you no regrets," I inquired, "in overthrowing this fair <\p> 
<p> system of our new life, which has been planned so deeply, and is now <\p> 
<p> beginning to flourish so hopefully around us?  How beautiful it is, <\p> 
<p> and, so far as we can yet see, how practicable!  The ages have waited <\p> 
<p> for us, and here we are, the very first that have essayed to carry on <\p> 
<p> our mortal existence in love and mutual help!  Hollingsworth, I would <\p> 
<p> be loath to take the ruin of this enterprise upon my conscience." <\p> 

<p> "Then let it rest wholly upon mine!" he answered, knitting his black <\p> 
<p> brows.  "I see through the system.  It is full of <\p> 
<p> defects,--irremediable and damning ones!--from first to last, there is <\p> 
<p> nothing else!  I grasp it in my hand, and find no substance whatever. <\p> 
<p> There is not human nature in it." <\p> 

<p> "Why are you so secret in your operations?"  I asked.  "God forbid that <\p> 
<p> I should accuse you of intentional wrong; but the besetting sin of a <\p> 
<p> philanthropist, it appears to me, is apt to be a moral obliquity. His <\p> 
<p> sense of honor ceases to be the sense of other honorable men. At some <\p> 
<p> point of his course--I know not exactly when or where--he is tempted to <\p> 
<p> palter with the right, and can scarcely forbear persuading himself that <\p> 
<p> the importance of his public ends renders it allowable to throw aside <\p> 
<p> his private conscience.  Oh, my dear friend, beware this error!  If you <\p> 
<p> meditate the overthrow of this establishment, call together our <\p> 
<p> companions, state your design, support it with all your eloquence, but <\p> 
<p> allow them an opportunity of defending themselves." <\p> 

<p> "It does not suit me," said Hollingsworth.  "Nor is it my duty to do <\p> 
<p> so." <\p> 

<p> "I think it is," replied I. <\p> 

<p> Hollingsworth frowned; not in passion, but, like fate, inexorably. <\p> 

<p> "I will not argue the point," said he.  "What I desire to know of you <\p> 
<p> is,--and you can tell me in one word,--whether I am to look for your <\p> 
<p> cooperation in this great scheme of good?  Take it up with me!  Be my <\p> 
<p> brother in it!  It offers you (what you have told me, over and over <\p> 
<p> again, that you most need) a purpose in life, worthy of the extremest <\p> 
<p> self-devotion,--worthy of martyrdom, should God so order it!  In this <\p> 
<p> view, I present it to you.  You can greatly benefit mankind.  Your <\p> 
<p> peculiar faculties, as I shall direct them, are capable of being so <\p> 
<p> wrought into this enterprise that not one of them need lie idle. Strike <\p> 
<p> hands with me, and from this moment you shall never again feel the <\p> 
<p> languor and vague wretchedness of an indolent or half-occupied man. <\p> 
<p> There may be no more aimless beauty in your life; but, in its stead, <\p> 
<p> there shall be strength, courage, immitigable will,--everything that a <\p> 
<p> manly and generous nature should desire!  We shall succeed!  We shall <\p> 
<p> have done our best for this miserable world; and happiness (which never <\p> 
<p> comes but incidentally) will come to us unawares." <\p> 

<p> It seemed his intention to say no more.  But, after he had quite broken <\p> 
<p> off, his deep eyes filled with tears, and he held out both his hands to <\p> 
<p> me. <\p> 

<p> "Coverdale," he murmured, "there is not the man in this wide world whom <\p> 
<p> I can love as I could you.  Do not forsake me!" <\p> 

<p> As I look back upon this scene, through the coldness and dimness of so <\p> 
<p> many years, there is still a sensation as if Hollingsworth had caught <\p> 
<p> hold of my heart, and were pulling it towards him with an almost <\p> 
<p> irresistible force.  It is a mystery to me how I withstood it. But, in <\p> 
<p> truth, I saw in his scheme of philanthropy nothing but what was odious. <\p> 
<p> A loathsomeness that was to be forever in my daily work! A great black <\p> 
<p> ugliness of sin, which he proposed to collect out of a thousand human <\p> 
<p> hearts, and that we should spend our lives in an experiment of <\p> 
<p> transmuting it into virtue!  Had I but touched his extended hand, <\p> 
<p> Hollingsworth's magnetism would perhaps have penetrated me with his own <\p> 
<p> conception of all these matters.  But I stood aloof.  I fortified <\p> 
<p> myself with doubts whether his strength of purpose had not been too <\p> 
<p> gigantic for his integrity, impelling him to trample on considerations <\p> 
<p> that should have been paramount to every other. <\p> 

<p> "Is Zenobia to take a part in your enterprise?"  I asked. <\p> 

<p> "She is," said Hollingsworth. <\p> 

<p> "She!--the beautiful!--the gorgeous!"  I exclaimed.  "And how have you <\p> 
<p> prevailed with such a woman to work in this squalid element?" <\p> 

<p> "Through no base methods, as you seem to suspect," he answered; "but by <\p> 
<p> addressing whatever is best and noblest in her." <\p> 

<p> Hollingsworth was looking on the ground.  But, as he often did <\p> 
<p> so,--generally, indeed, in his habitual moods of thought,--I could not <\p> 
<p> judge whether it was from any special unwillingness now to meet my <\p> 
<p> eyes.  What it was that dictated my next question, I cannot precisely <\p> 
<p> say.  Nevertheless, it rose so inevitably into my mouth, and, as it <\p> 
<p> were, asked itself so involuntarily, that there must needs have been an <\p> 
<p> aptness in it. <\p> 

<p> "What is to become of Priscilla?" <\p> 

<p> Hollingsworth looked at me fiercely, and with glowing eyes.  He could <\p> 
<p> not have shown any other kind of expression than that, had he meant to <\p> 
<p> strike me with a sword. <\p> 

<p> "Why do you bring in the names of these women?" said he, after a moment <\p> 
<p> of pregnant silence.  "What have they to do with the proposal which I <\p> 
<p> make you?  I must have your answer!  Will you devote yourself, and <\p> 
<p> sacrifice all to this great end, and be my friend of friends forever?" <\p> 

<p> "In Heaven's name, Hollingsworth," cried I, getting angry, and glad to <\p> 
<p> be angry, because so only was it possible to oppose his tremendous <\p> 
<p> concentrativeness and indomitable will, "cannot you conceive that a man <\p> 
<p> may wish well to the world, and struggle for its good, on some other <\p> 
<p> plan than precisely that which you have laid down?  And will you cast <\p> 
<p> off a friend for no unworthiness, but merely because he stands upon his <\p> 
<p> right as an individual being, and looks at matters through his own <\p> 
<p> optics, instead of yours?" <\p> 

<p> "Be with me," said Hollingsworth, "or be against me!  There is no third <\p> 
<p> choice for you." <\p> 

<p> "Take this, then, as my decision," I answered.  "I doubt the wisdom of <\p> 
<p> your scheme.  Furthermore, I greatly fear that the methods by which you <\p> 
<p> allow yourself to pursue it are such as cannot stand the scrutiny of an <\p> 
<p> unbiassed conscience." <\p> 

<p> "And you will not join me?" <\p> 

<p> "No!" <\p> 

<p> I never said the word--and certainly can never have it to say <\p> 
<p> hereafter--that cost me a thousandth part so hard an effort as did that <\p> 
<p> one syllable.  The heart-pang was not merely figurative, but an <\p> 
<p> absolute torture of the breast.  I was gazing steadfastly at <\p> 
<p> Hollingsworth.  It seemed to me that it struck him, too, like a bullet. <\p> 
<p> A ghastly paleness--always so terrific on a swarthy face--overspread <\p> 
<p> his features.  There was a convulsive movement of his throat, as if he <\p> 
<p> were forcing down some words that struggled and fought for utterance. <\p> 
<p> Whether words of anger, or words of grief, I cannot tell; although many <\p> 
<p> and many a time I have vainly tormented myself with conjecturing which <\p> 
<p> of the two they were.  One other appeal to my friendship,--such as <\p> 
<p> once, already, Hollingsworth had made,--taking me in the revulsion that <\p> 
<p> followed a strenuous exercise of opposing will, would completely have <\p> 
<p> subdued me.  But he left the matter there.  "Well!" said he. <\p> 

<p> And that was all!  I should have been thankful for one word more, even <\p> 
<p> had it shot me through the heart, as mine did him.  But he did not <\p> 
<p> speak it; and, after a few moments, with one accord, we set to work <\p> 
<p> again, repairing the stone fence.  Hollingsworth, I observed, wrought <\p> 
<p> like a Titan; and, for my own part, I lifted stones which at this <\p> 
<p> day--or, in a calmer mood, at that one--I should no more have thought <\p> 
<p> it possible to stir than to carry off the gates of Gaza on my back. <\p> 

<p> XVI. LEAVE-TAKINGS <\p> 

<p> A few days after the tragic passage-at-arms between Hollingsworth and <\p> 
<p> me, I appeared at the dinner-table actually dressed in a coat, instead <\p> 
<p> of my customary blouse; with a satin cravat, too, a white vest, and <\p> 
<p> several other things that made me seem strange and outlandish to <\p> 
<p> myself.  As for my companions, this unwonted spectacle caused a great <\p> 
<p> stir upon the wooden benches that bordered either side of our homely <\p> 
<p> board. <\p> 

<p> "What's in the wind now, Miles?" asked one of them.  "Are you deserting <\p> 
<p> us?" <\p> 

<p> "Yes, for a week or two," said I. "It strikes me that my health demands <\p> 
<p> a little relaxation of labor, and a short visit to the seaside, during <\p> 
<p> the dog-days." <\p> 

<p> "You look like it!" grumbled Silas Foster, not greatly pleased with the <\p> 
<p> idea of losing an efficient laborer before the stress of the season was <\p> 
<p> well over.  "Now, here's a pretty fellow!  His shoulders have broadened <\p> 
<p> a matter of six inches since he came among us; he can do his day's <\p> 
<p> work, if he likes, with any man or ox on the farm; and yet he talks <\p> 
<p> about going to the seashore for his health!  Well, well, old woman," <\p> 
<p> added he to his wife, "let me have a plateful of that pork and cabbage! <\p> 
<p> I begin to feel in a very weakly way.  When the others have had their <\p> 
<p> turn, you and I will take a jaunt to Newport or Saratoga!" <\p> 
<p> "Well, but, Mr. Foster," said I, "you must allow me to take a little <\p> 
<p> breath." <\p> 

<p> "Breath!" retorted the old yeoman.  "Your lungs have the play of a pair <\p> 
<p> of blacksmith's bellows already.  What on earth do you want more?  But <\p> 
<p> go along!  I understand the business.  We shall never see your face <\p> 
<p> here again.  Here ends the reformation of the world, so far as Miles <\p> 
<p> Coverdale has a hand in it!" <\p> 

<p> "By no means," I replied.  "I am resolute to die in the last ditch, for <\p> 
<p> the good of the cause." <\p> 

<p> "Die in a ditch!" muttered gruff Silas, with genuine Yankee intolerance <\p> 
<p> of any intermission of toil, except on Sunday, the Fourth of July, the <\p> 
<p> autumnal cattle-show, Thanksgiving, or the annual Fast,--"die in a <\p> 
<p> ditch!  I believe, in my conscience, you would, if there were no <\p> 
<p> steadier means than your own labor to keep you out of it!" <\p> 

<p> The truth was, that an intolerable discontent and irksomeness had come <\p> 
<p> over me.  Blithedale was no longer what it had been.  Everything was <\p> 
<p> suddenly faded.  The sunburnt and arid aspect of our woods and <\p> 
<p> pastures, beneath the August sky, did but imperfectly symbolize the <\p> 
<p> lack of dew and moisture, that, since yesterday, as it were, had <\p> 
<p> blighted my fields of thought, and penetrated to the innermost and <\p> 
<p> shadiest of my contemplative recesses.  The change will be recognized <\p> 
<p> by many, who, after a period of happiness, have endeavored to go on <\p> 
<p> with the same kind of life, in the same scene, in spite of the <\p> 
<p> alteration or withdrawal of some principal circumstance.  They discover <\p> 
<p> (what heretofore, perhaps, they had not known) that it was this which <\p> 
<p> gave the bright color and vivid reality to the whole affair. <\p> 

<p> I stood on other terms than before, not only with Hollingsworth, but <\p> 
<p> with Zenobia and Priscilla.  As regarded the two latter, it was that <\p> 
<p> dreamlike and miserable sort of change that denies you the privilege to <\p> 
<p> complain, because you can assert no positive injury, nor lay your <\p> 
<p> finger on anything tangible.  It is a matter which you do not see, but <\p> 
<p> feel, and which, when you try to analyze it, seems to lose its very <\p> 
<p> existence, and resolve itself into a sickly humor of your own. Your <\p> 
<p> understanding, possibly, may put faith in this denial.  But your heart <\p> 
<p> will not so easily rest satisfied.  It incessantly remonstrates, <\p> 
<p> though, most of the time, in a bass-note, which you do not separately <\p> 
<p> distinguish; but, now and then, with a sharp cry, importunate to be <\p> 
<p> heard, and resolute to claim belief.  "Things are not as they were!" it <\p> 
<p> keeps saying.  "You shall not impose on me!  I will never be quiet!  I <\p> 
<p> will throb painfully!  I will be heavy, and desolate, and shiver with <\p> 
<p> cold!  For I, your deep heart, know when to be miserable, as once I <\p> 
<p> knew when to be happy!  All is changed for us! You are beloved no <\p> 
<p> more!"  And were my life to be spent over again, I would invariably <\p> 
<p> lend my ear to this Cassandra of the inward depths, however clamorous <\p> 
<p> the music and the merriment of a more superficial region. <\p> 

<p> My outbreak with Hollingsworth, though never definitely known to our <\p> 
<p> associates, had really an effect upon the moral atmosphere of the <\p> 
<p> Community.  It was incidental to the closeness of relationship into <\p> 
<p> which we had brought ourselves, that an unfriendly state of feeling <\p> 
<p> could not occur between any two members without the whole society being <\p> 
<p> more or less commoted and made uncomfortable thereby.  This species of <\p> 
<p> nervous sympathy (though a pretty characteristic enough, sentimentally <\p> 
<p> considered, and apparently betokening an actual bond of love among us) <\p> 
<p> was yet found rather inconvenient in its practical operation, mortal <\p> 
<p> tempers being so infirm and variable as they are. If one of us happened <\p> 
<p> to give his neighbor a box on the ear, the tingle was immediately felt <\p> 
<p> on the same side of everybody's head. Thus, even on the supposition <\p> 
<p> that we were far less quarrelsome than the rest of the world, a great <\p> 
<p> deal of time was necessarily wasted in rubbing our ears. <\p> 

<p> Musing on all these matters, I felt an inexpressible longing for at <\p> 
<p> least a temporary novelty.  I thought of going across the Rocky <\p> 
<p> Mountains, or to Europe, or up the Nile; of offering myself a volunteer <\p> 
<p> on the Exploring Expedition; of taking a ramble of years, no matter in <\p> 
<p> what direction, and coming back on the other side of the world.  Then, <\p> 
<p> should the colonists of Blithedale have established their enterprise on <\p> 
<p> a permanent basis, I might fling aside my pilgrim staff and dusty <\p> 
<p> shoon, and rest as peacefully here as elsewhere.  Or, in case <\p> 
<p> Hollingsworth should occupy the ground with his School of Reform, as he <\p> 
<p> now purposed, I might plead earthly guilt enough, by that time, to give <\p> 
<p> me what I was inclined to think the only trustworthy hold on his <\p> 
<p> affections.  Meanwhile, before deciding on any ultimate plan, I <\p> 
<p> determined to remove myself to a little distance, and take an exterior <\p> 
<p> view of what we had all been about. <\p> 

<p> In truth, it was dizzy work, amid such fermentation of opinions as was <\p> 
<p> going on in the general brain of the Community.  It was a kind of <\p> 
<p> Bedlam, for the time being, although out of the very thoughts that were <\p> 
<p> wildest and most destructive might grow a wisdom, holy, calm, and pure, <\p> 
<p> and that should incarnate itself with the substance of a noble and <\p> 
<p> happy life.  But, as matters now were, I felt myself (and, having a <\p> 
<p> decided tendency towards the actual, I never liked to feel it) getting <\p> 
<p> quite out of my reckoning, with regard to the existing state of the <\p> 
<p> world.  I was beginning to lose the sense of what kind of a world it <\p> 
<p> was, among innumerable schemes of what it might or ought to be.  It was <\p> 
<p> impossible, situated as we were, not to imbibe the idea that everything <\p> 
<p> in nature and human existence was fluid, or fast becoming so; that the <\p> 
<p> crust of the earth in many places was broken, and its whole surface <\p> 
<p> portentously upheaving; that it was a day of crisis, and that we <\p> 
<p> ourselves were in the critical vortex. Our great globe floated in the <\p> 
<p> atmosphere of infinite space like an unsubstantial bubble.  No <\p> 
<p> sagacious man will long retain his sagacity, if he live exclusively <\p> 
<p> among reformers and progressive people, without periodically returning <\p> 
<p> into the settled system of things, to correct himself by a new <\p> 
<p> observation from that old standpoint. <\p> 

<p> It was now time for me, therefore, to go and hold a little talk with <\p> 
<p> the conservatives, the writers of "The North American Review," the <\p> 
<p> merchants, the politicians, the Cambridge men, and all those <\p> 
<p> respectable old blockheads who still, in this intangibility and <\p> 
<p> mistiness of affairs, kept a death-grip on one or two ideas which had <\p> 
<p> not come into vogue since yesterday morning. <\p> 

<p> The brethren took leave of me with cordial kindness; and as for the <\p> 
<p> sisterhood, I had serious thoughts of kissing them all round, but <\p> 
<p> forbore to do so, because, in all such general salutations, the penance <\p> 
<p> is fully equal to the pleasure.  So I kissed none of them; and nobody, <\p> 
<p> to say the truth, seemed to expect it. <\p> 

<p> "Do you wish me," I said to Zenobia, "to announce in town, and at the <\p> 
<p> watering-places, your purpose to deliver a course of lectures on the <\p> 
<p> rights of women?" <\p> 

<p> "Women possess no rights," said Zenobia, with a half-melancholy smile; <\p> 
<p> "or, at all events, only little girls and grandmothers would have the <\p> 
<p> force to exercise them." <\p> 

<p> She gave me her hand freely and kindly, and looked at me, I thought, <\p> 
<p> with a pitying expression in her eyes; nor was there any settled light <\p> 
<p> of joy in them on her own behalf, but a troubled and passionate flame, <\p> 
<p> flickering and fitful. <\p> 

<p> "I regret, on the whole, that you are leaving us," she said; "and all <\p> 
<p> the more, since I feel that this phase of our life is finished, and can <\p> 
<p> never be lived over again.  Do you know, Mr. Coverdale, that I have <\p> 
<p> been several times on the point of making you my confidant, for lack of <\p> 
<p> a better and wiser one?  But you are too young to be my father <\p> 
<p> confessor; and you would not thank me for treating you like one of <\p> 
<p> those good little handmaidens who share the bosom secrets of a <\p> 
<p> tragedy-queen." <\p> 

<p> "I would, at least, be loyal and faithful," answered I; "and would <\p> 
<p> counsel you with an honest purpose, if not wisely." <\p> 

<p> "Yes," said Zenobia, "you would be only too wise, too honest. Honesty <\p> 
<p> and wisdom are such a delightful pastime, at another person's expense!" <\p> 

<p> "Ah, Zenobia," I exclaimed, "if you would but let me speak!" <\p> 

<p> "By no means," she replied, "especially when you have just resumed the <\p> 
<p> whole series of social conventionalisms, together with that <\p> 
<p> strait-bodied coat.  I would as lief open my heart to a lawyer or a <\p> 
<p> clergyman!  No, no, Mr. Coverdale; if I choose a counsellor, in the <\p> 
<p> present aspect of my affairs, it must be either an angel or a madman; <\p> 
<p> and I rather apprehend that the latter would be likeliest of the two to <\p> 
<p> speak the fitting word.  It needs a wild steersman when we voyage <\p> 
<p> through chaos!  The anchor is up,--farewell!" <\p> 

<p> Priscilla, as soon as dinner was over, had betaken herself into a <\p> 
<p> corner, and set to work on a little purse.  As I approached her, she <\p> 
<p> let her eyes rest on me with a calm, serious look; for, with all her <\p> 
<p> delicacy of nerves, there was a singular self-possession in Priscilla, <\p> 
<p> and her sensibilities seemed to lie sheltered from ordinary commotion, <\p> 
<p> like the water in a deep well. <\p> 

<p> "Will you give me that purse, Priscilla," said I, "as a parting <\p> 
<p> keepsake?" <\p> 

<p> "Yes," she answered, "if you will wait till it is finished." <\p> 

<p> "I must not wait, even for that," I replied.  "Shall I find you here, <\p> 
<p> on my return?" <\p> 

<p> "I never wish to go away," said she. <\p> 

<p> "I have sometimes thought," observed I, smiling, "that you, Priscilla, <\p> 
<p> are a little prophetess, or, at least, that you have spiritual <\p> 
<p> intimations respecting matters which are dark to us grosser people. If <\p> 
<p> that be the case, I should like to ask you what is about to happen; for <\p> 
<p> I am tormented with a strong foreboding that, were I to return even so <\p> 
<p> soon as to-morrow morning, I should find everything changed. Have you <\p> 
<p> any impressions of this nature?" <\p> 

<p> "Ah, no," said Priscilla, looking at me apprehensively.  "If any such <\p> 
<p> misfortune is coming, the shadow has not reached me yet.  Heaven <\p> 
<p> forbid!  I should be glad if there might never be any change, but one <\p> 
<p> summer follow another, and all just like this." <\p> 

<p> "No summer ever came back, and no two summers ever were alike," said I, <\p> 
<p> with a degree of Orphic wisdom that astonished myself.  "Times change, <\p> 
<p> and people change; and if our hearts do not change as readily, so much <\p> 
<p> the worse for us.  Good-by, Priscilla!" <\p> 

<p> I gave her hand a pressure, which, I think, she neither resisted nor <\p> 
<p> returned.  Priscilla's heart was deep, but of small compass; it had <\p> 
<p> room but for a very few dearest ones, among whom she never reckoned me. <\p> 

<p> On the doorstep I met Hollingsworth.  I had a momentary impulse to hold <\p> 
<p> out my hand, or at least to give a parting nod, but resisted both. <\p> 
<p> When a real and strong affection has come to an end, it is not well to <\p> 
<p> mock the sacred past with any show of those commonplace civilities that <\p> 
<p> belong to ordinary intercourse.  Being dead henceforth to him, and he <\p> 
<p> to me, there could be no propriety in our chilling one another with the <\p> 
<p> touch of two corpse-like hands, or playing at looks of courtesy with <\p> 
<p> eyes that were impenetrable beneath the glaze and the film.  We passed, <\p> 
<p> therefore, as if mutually invisible. <\p> 

<p> I can nowise explain what sort of whim, prank, or perversity it was, <\p> 
<p> that, after all these leave-takings, induced me to go to the pigsty, <\p> 
<p> and take leave of the swine!  There they lay, buried as deeply among <\p> 
<p> the straw as they could burrow, four huge black grunters, the very <\p> 
<p> symbols of slothful ease and sensual comfort.  They were asleep, <\p> 
<p> drawing short and heavy breaths, which heaved their big sides up and <\p> 
<p> down.  Unclosing their eyes, however, at my approach, they looked dimly <\p> 
<p> forth at the outer world, and simultaneously uttered a gentle grunt; <\p> 
<p> not putting themselves to the trouble of an additional breath for that <\p> 
<p> particular purpose, but grunting with their ordinary inhalation.  They <\p> 
<p> were involved, and almost stifled and buried alive, in their own <\p> 
<p> corporeal substance.  The very unreadiness and oppression wherewith <\p> 
<p> these greasy citizens gained breath enough to keep their life-machinery <\p> 
<p> in sluggish movement appeared to make them only the more sensible of <\p> 
<p> the ponderous and fat satisfaction of their existence.  Peeping at me <\p> 
<p> an instant out of their small, red, hardly perceptible eyes, they dropt <\p> 
<p> asleep again; yet not so far asleep but that their unctuous bliss was <\p> 
<p> still present to them, betwixt dream and reality. <\p> 

<p> "You must come back in season to eat part of a spare-rib," said Silas <\p> 
<p> Foster, giving my hand a mighty squeeze.  "I shall have these fat <\p> 
<p> fellows hanging up by the heels, heads downward, pretty soon, I tell <\p> 
<p> you!" <\p> 

<p> "O cruel Silas, what a horrible idea!" cried I. "All the rest of us, <\p> 
<p> men, women, and livestock, save only these four porkers, are bedevilled <\p> 
<p> with one grief or another; they alone are happy,--and you mean to cut <\p> 
<p> their throats and eat them!  It would be more for the general comfort <\p> 
<p> to let them eat us; and bitter and sour morsels we should be!" <\p> 

<p> XVII. THE HOTEL <\p> 

<p> Arriving in town (where my bachelor-rooms, long before this time, had <\p> 
<p> received some other occupant), I established myself, for a day or two, <\p> 
<p> in a certain, respectable hotel.  It was situated somewhat aloof from <\p> 
<p> my former track in life; my present mood inclining me to avoid most of <\p> 
<p> my old companions, from whom I was now sundered by other interests, and <\p> 
<p> who would have been likely enough to amuse themselves at the expense of <\p> 
<p> the amateur workingman.  The hotel-keeper put me into a back room of <\p> 
<p> the third story of his spacious establishment. The day was lowering, <\p> 
<p> with occasional gusts of rain, and an ugly tempered east wind, which <\p> 
<p> seemed to come right off the chill and melancholy sea, hardly mitigated <\p> 
<p> by sweeping over the roofs, and amalgamating itself with the dusky <\p> 
<p> element of city smoke.  All the effeminacy of past days had returned <\p> 
<p> upon me at once.  Summer as it still was, I ordered a coal fire in the <\p> 
<p> rusty grate, and was glad to find myself growing a little too warm with <\p> 
<p> an artificial temperature. <\p> 

<p> My sensations were those of a traveller, long sojourning in remote <\p> 
<p> regions, and at length sitting down again amid customs once familiar. <\p> 
<p> There was a newness and an oldness oddly combining themselves into one <\p> 
<p> impression.  It made me acutely sensible how strange a piece of <\p> 
<p> mosaic-work had lately been wrought into my life.  True, if you look at <\p> 
<p> it in one way, it had been only a summer in the country.  But, <\p> 
<p> considered in a profounder relation, it was part of another age, a <\p> 
<p> different state of society, a segment of an existence peculiar in its <\p> 
<p> aims and methods, a leaf of some mysterious volume interpolated into <\p> 
<p> the current history which time was writing off.  At one moment, the <\p> 
<p> very circumstances now surrounding me--my coal fire and the dingy room <\p> 
<p> in the bustling hotel--appeared far off and intangible; the next <\p> 
<p> instant Blithedale looked vague, as if it were at a distance both in <\p> 
<p> time and space, and so shadowy that a question might be raised whether <\p> 
<p> the whole affair had been anything more than the thoughts of a <\p> 
<p> speculative man.  I had never before experienced a mood that so robbed <\p> 
<p> the actual world of its solidity.  It nevertheless involved a charm, on <\p> 
<p> which--a devoted epicure of my own emotions--I resolved to pause, and <\p> 
<p> enjoy the moral sillabub until quite dissolved away. <\p> 

<p> Whatever had been my taste for solitude and natural scenery, yet the <\p> 
<p> thick, foggy, stifled element of cities, the entangled life of many men <\p> 
<p> together, sordid as it was, and empty of the beautiful, took quite as <\p> 
<p> strenuous a hold upon my mind.  I felt as if there could never be <\p> 
<p> enough of it.  Each characteristic sound was too suggestive to be <\p> 
<p> passed over unnoticed.  Beneath and around me, I heard the stir of the <\p> 
<p> hotel; the loud voices of guests, landlord, or bar-keeper; steps <\p> 
<p> echoing on the staircase; the ringing of a bell, announcing arrivals or <\p> 
<p> departures; the porter lumbering past my door with baggage, which he <\p> 
<p> thumped down upon the floors of neighboring chambers; the lighter feet <\p> 
<p> of chambermaids scudding along the passages;--it is ridiculous to think <\p> 
<p> what an interest they had for me! From the street came the tumult of <\p> 
<p> the pavements, pervading the whole house with a continual uproar, so <\p> 
<p> broad and deep that only an unaccustomed ear would dwell upon it.  A <\p> 
<p> company of the city soldiery, with a full military band, marched in <\p> 
<p> front of the hotel, invisible to me, but stirringly audible both by its <\p> 
<p> foot-tramp and the clangor of its instruments.  Once or twice all the <\p> 
<p> city bells jangled together, announcing a fire, which brought out the <\p> 
<p> engine-men and their machines, like an army with its artillery rushing <\p> 
<p> to battle. Hour by hour the clocks in many steeples responded one to <\p> 
<p> another. <\p> 

<p> In some public hall, not a great way off, there seemed to be an <\p> 
<p> exhibition of a mechanical diorama; for three times during the day <\p> 
<p> occurred a repetition of obstreperous music, winding up with the rattle <\p> 
<p> of imitative cannon and musketry, and a huge final explosion. Then <\p> 
<p> ensued the applause of the spectators, with clap of hands and thump of <\p> 
<p> sticks, and the energetic pounding of their heels.  All this was just <\p> 
<p> as valuable, in its way, as the sighing of the breeze among the <\p> 
<p> birch-trees that overshadowed Eliot's pulpit. <\p> 

<p> Yet I felt a hesitation about plunging into this muddy tide of human <\p> 
<p> activity and pastime.  It suited me better, for the present, to linger <\p> 
<p> on the brink, or hover in the air above it.  So I spent the first day, <\p> 
<p> and the greater part of the second, in the laziest manner possible, in <\p> 
<p> a rocking-chair, inhaling the fragrance of a series of cigars, with my <\p> 
<p> legs and slippered feet horizontally disposed, and in my hand a novel <\p> 
<p> purchased of a railroad bibliopolist.  The gradual waste of my cigar <\p> 
<p> accomplished itself with an easy and gentle expenditure of breath.  My <\p> 
<p> book was of the dullest, yet had a sort of sluggish flow, like that of <\p> 
<p> a stream in which your boat is as often aground as afloat.  Had there <\p> 
<p> been a more impetuous rush, a more absorbing passion of the narrative, <\p> 
<p> I should the sooner have struggled out of its uneasy current, and have <\p> 
<p> given myself up to the swell and subsidence of my thoughts.  But, as it <\p> 
<p> was, the torpid life of the book served as an unobtrusive accompaniment <\p> 
<p> to the life within me and about me.  At intervals, however, when its <\p> 
<p> effect grew a little too soporific,--not for my patience, but for the <\p> 
<p> possibility of keeping my eyes open, I bestirred myself, started from <\p> 
<p> the rocking-chair, and looked out of the window. <\p> 

<p> A gray sky; the weathercock of a steeple that rose beyond the opposite <\p> 
<p> range of buildings, pointing from the eastward; a sprinkle of small, <\p> 
<p> spiteful-looking raindrops on the window-pane.  In that ebb-tide of my <\p> 
<p> energies, had I thought of venturing abroad, these tokens would have <\p> 
<p> checked the abortive purpose. <\p> 

<p> After several such visits to the window, I found myself getting pretty <\p> 
<p> well acquainted with that little portion of the backside of the <\p> 
<p> universe which it presented to my view.  Over against the hotel and its <\p> 
<p> adjacent houses, at the distance of forty or fifty yards, was the rear <\p> 
<p> of a range of buildings which appeared to be spacious, modern, and <\p> 
<p> calculated for fashionable residences.  The interval between was <\p> 
<p> apportioned into grass-plots, and here and there an apology for a <\p> 
<p> garden, pertaining severally to these dwellings.  There were <\p> 
<p> apple-trees, and pear and peach trees, too, the fruit on which looked <\p> 
<p> singularly large, luxuriant, and abundant, as well it might, in a <\p> 
<p> situation so warm and sheltered, and where the soil had doubtless been <\p> 
<p> enriched to a more than natural fertility.  In two or three places <\p> 
<p> grapevines clambered upon trellises, and bore clusters already purple, <\p> 
<p> and promising the richness of Malta or Madeira in their ripened juice. <\p> 
<p> The blighting winds of our rigid climate could not molest these trees <\p> 
<p> and vines; the sunshine, though descending late into this area, and too <\p> 
<p> early intercepted by the height of the surrounding houses, yet lay <\p> 
<p> tropically there, even when less than temperate in every other region. <\p> 
<p> Dreary as was the day, the scene was illuminated by not a few sparrows <\p> 
<p> and other birds, which spread their wings, and flitted and fluttered, <\p> 
<p> and alighted now here, now there, and busily scratched their food out <\p> 
<p> of the wormy earth.  Most of these winged people seemed to have their <\p> 
<p> domicile in a robust and healthy buttonwood-tree.  It aspired upward, <\p> 
<p> high above the roofs of the houses, and spread a dense head of foliage <\p> 
<p> half across the area. <\p> 

<p> There was a cat--as there invariably is in such places--who evidently <\p> 
<p> thought herself entitled to the privileges of forest life in this close <\p> 
<p> heart of city conventionalisms.  I watched her creeping along the low, <\p> 
<p> flat roofs of the offices, descending a flight of wooden steps, gliding <\p> 
<p> among the grass, and besieging the buttonwood-tree, with murderous <\p> 
<p> purpose against its feathered citizens.  But, after all, they were <\p> 
<p> birds of city breeding, and doubtless knew how to guard themselves <\p> 
<p> against the peculiar perils of their position. <\p> 

<p> Bewitching to my fancy are all those nooks and crannies where Nature, <\p> 
<p> like a stray partridge, hides her head among the long-established <\p> 
<p> haunts of men!  It is likewise to be remarked, as a general rule, that <\p> 
<p> there is far more of the picturesque, more truth to native and <\p> 
<p> characteristic tendencies, and vastly greater suggestiveness in the <\p> 
<p> back view of a residence, whether in town or country, than in its <\p> 
<p> front.  The latter is always artificial; it is meant for the world's <\p> 
<p> eye, and is therefore a veil and a concealment.  Realities keep in the <\p> 
<p> rear, and put forward an advance guard of show and humbug.  The <\p> 
<p> posterior aspect of any old farmhouse, behind which a railroad has <\p> 
<p> unexpectedly been opened, is so different from that looking upon the <\p> 
<p> immemorial highway, that the spectator gets new ideas of rural life and <\p> 
<p> individuality in the puff or two of steam-breath which shoots him past <\p> 
<p> the premises.  In a city, the distinction between what is offered to <\p> 
<p> the public and what is kept for the family is certainly not less <\p> 
<p> striking. <\p> 

<p> But, to return to my window at the back of the hotel.  Together with a <\p> 
<p> due contemplation of the fruit-trees, the grapevines, the <\p> 
<p> buttonwood-tree, the cat, the birds, and many other particulars, I <\p> 
<p> failed not to study the row of fashionable dwellings to which all these <\p> 
<p> appertained.  Here, it must be confessed, there was a general sameness. <\p> 
<p> From the upper story to the first floor, they were so much alike, that <\p> 
<p> I could only conceive of the inhabitants as cut out on one identical <\p> 
<p> pattern, like little wooden toy-people of German manufacture.  One <\p> 
<p> long, united roof, with its thousands of slates glittering in the rain, <\p> 
<p> extended over the whole.  After the distinctness of separate characters <\p> 
<p> to which I had recently been accustomed, it perplexed and annoyed me <\p> 
<p> not to be able to resolve this combination of human interests into <\p> 
<p> well-defined elements.  It seemed hardly worth while for more than one <\p> 
<p> of those families to be in existence, since they all had the same <\p> 
<p> glimpse of the sky, all looked into the same area, all received just <\p> 
<p> their equal share of sunshine through the front windows, and all <\p> 
<p> listened to precisely the same noises of the street on which they <\p> 
<p> boarded.  Men are so much alike in their nature, that they grow <\p> 
<p> intolerable unless varied by their circumstances. <\p> 

<p> Just about this time a waiter entered my room.  The truth was, I had <\p> 
<p> rung the bell and ordered a sherry-cobbler. <\p> 
<p> "Can you tell me," I inquired, "what families reside in any of those <\p> 
<p> houses opposite?" <\p> 

<p> "The one right opposite is a rather stylish boarding-house," said the <\p> 
<p> waiter.  "Two of the gentlemen boarders keep horses at the stable of <\p> 
<p> our establishment.  They do things in very good style, sir, the people <\p> 
<p> that live there." <\p> 

<p> I might have found out nearly as much for myself, on examining the <\p> 
<p> house a little more closely, in one of the upper chambers I saw a young <\p> 
<p> man in a dressing-gown, standing before the glass and brushing his hair <\p> 
<p> for a quarter of an hour together.  He then spent an equal space of <\p> 
<p> time in the elaborate arrangement of his cravat, and finally made his <\p> 
<p> appearance in a dress-coat, which I suspected to be newly come from the <\p> 
<p> tailor's, and now first put on for a dinner-party.  At a window of the <\p> 
<p> next story below, two children, prettily dressed, were looking out.  By <\p> 
<p> and by a middle-aged gentleman came softly behind them, kissed the <\p> 
<p> little girl, and playfully pulled the little boy's ear.  It was a papa, <\p> 
<p> no doubt, just come in from his counting-room or office; and anon <\p> 
<p> appeared mamma, stealing as softly behind papa as he had stolen behind <\p> 
<p> the children, and laying her hand on his shoulder to surprise him. <\p> 
<p> Then followed a kiss between papa and mamma; but a noiseless one, for <\p> 
<p> the children did not turn their heads. <\p> 

<p> "I bless God for these good folks!" thought I to myself.  "I have not <\p> 
<p> seen a prettier bit of nature, in all my summer in the country, than <\p> 
<p> they have shown me here, in a rather stylish boarding-house.  I will <\p> 
<p> pay them a little more attention by and by." <\p> 

<p> On the first floor, an iron balustrade ran along in front of the tall <\p> 
<p> and spacious windows, evidently belonging to a back drawing-room; and <\p> 
<p> far into the interior, through the arch of the sliding-doors, I could <\p> 
<p> discern a gleam from the windows of the front apartment.  There were no <\p> 
<p> signs of present occupancy in this suite of rooms; the curtains being <\p> 
<p> enveloped in a protective covering, which allowed but a small portion <\p> 
<p> of their crimson material to be seen.  But two housemaids were <\p> 
<p> industriously at work; so that there was good prospect that the <\p> 
<p> boarding-house might not long suffer from the absence of its most <\p> 
<p> expensive and profitable guests.  Meanwhile, until they should appear, <\p> 
<p> I cast my eyes downward to the lower regions.  There, in the dusk that <\p> 
<p> so early settles into such places, I saw the red glow of the kitchen <\p> 
<p> range.  The hot cook, or one of her subordinates, with a ladle in her <\p> 
<p> hand, came to draw a cool breath at the back door.  As soon as she <\p> 
<p> disappeared, an Irish man-servant, in a white jacket, crept slyly <\p> 
<p> forth, and threw away the fragments of a china dish, which, <\p> 
<p> unquestionably, he had just broken.  Soon afterwards, a lady, showily <\p> 
<p> dressed, with a curling front of what must have been false hair, and <\p> 
<p> reddish-brown, I suppose, in hue,--though my remoteness allowed me only <\p> 
<p> to guess at such particulars,--this respectable mistress of the <\p> 
<p> boarding-house made a momentary transit across the kitchen window, and <\p> 
<p> appeared no more.  It was her final, comprehensive glance, in order to <\p> 
<p> make sure that soup, fish, and flesh were in a proper state of <\p> 
<p> readiness, before the serving up of dinner. <\p> 

<p> There was nothing else worth noticing about the house, unless it be <\p> 
<p> that on the peak of one of the dormer windows which opened out of the <\p> 
<p> roof sat a dove, looking very dreary and forlorn; insomuch that I <\p> 
<p> wondered why she chose to sit there, in the chilly rain, while her <\p> 
<p> kindred were doubtless nestling in a warm and comfortable dove-cote. <\p> 
<p> All at once this dove spread her wings, and, launching herself in the <\p> 
<p> air, came flying so straight across the intervening space, that I fully <\p> 
<p> expected her to alight directly on my window-sill.  In the latter part <\p> 
<p> of her course, however, she swerved aside, flew upward, and vanished, <\p> 
<p> as did, likewise, the slight, fantastic pathos with which I had <\p> 
<p> invested her. <\p> 

<p> XVIII. THE BOARDING-HOUSE <\p> 

<p> The next day, as soon as I thought of looking again towards the <\p> 
<p> opposite house, there sat the dove again, on the peak of the same <\p> 
<p> dormer window!  It was by no means an early hour, for the preceding <\p> 
<p> evening I had ultimately mustered enterprise enough to visit the <\p> 
<p> theatre, had gone late to bed, and slept beyond all limit, in my <\p> 
<p> remoteness from Silas Foster's awakening horn.  Dreams had tormented me <\p> 
<p> throughout the night.  The train of thoughts which, for months past, <\p> 
<p> had worn a track through my mind, and to escape which was one of my <\p> 
<p> chief objects in leaving Blithedale, kept treading remorselessly to and <\p> 
<p> fro in their old footsteps, while slumber left me impotent to regulate <\p> 
<p> them.  It was not till I had quitted my three friends that they first <\p> 
<p> began to encroach upon my dreams.  In those of the last night, <\p> 
<p> Hollingsworth and Zenobia, standing on either side of my bed, had bent <\p> 
<p> across it to exchange a kiss of passion. Priscilla, beholding <\p> 
<p> this,--for she seemed to be peeping in at the chamber window,--had <\p> 
<p> melted gradually away, and left only the sadness of her expression in <\p> 
<p> my heart.  There it still lingered, after I awoke; one of those <\p> 
<p> unreasonable sadnesses that you know not how to deal with, because it <\p> 
<p> involves nothing for common-sense to clutch. <\p> 

<p> It was a gray and dripping forenoon; gloomy enough in town, and still <\p> 
<p> gloomier in the haunts to which my recollections persisted in <\p> 
<p> transporting me.  For, in spite of my efforts to think of something <\p> 
<p> else, I thought how the gusty rain was drifting over the slopes and <\p> 
<p> valleys of our farm; how wet must be the foliage that overshadowed the <\p> 
<p> pulpit rock; how cheerless, in such a day, my hermitage--the <\p> 
<p> tree-solitude of my owl-like humors--in the vine-encircled heart of the <\p> 
<p> tall pine!  It was a phase of homesickness.  I had wrenched myself too <\p> 
<p> suddenly out of an accustomed sphere.  There was no choice, now, but to <\p> 
<p> bear the pang of whatever heartstrings were snapt asunder, and that <\p> 
<p> illusive torment (like the ache of a limb long ago cut off) by which a <\p> 
<p> past mode of life prolongs itself into the succeeding one.  I was full <\p> 
<p> of idle and shapeless regrets.  The thought impressed itself upon me <\p> 
<p> that I had left duties unperformed. With the power, perhaps, to act in <\p> 
<p> the place of destiny and avert misfortune from my friends, I had <\p> 
<p> resigned them to their fate.  That cold tendency, between instinct and <\p> 
<p> intellect, which made me pry with a speculative interest into people's <\p> 
<p> passions and impulses, appeared to have gone far towards unhumanizing <\p> 
<p> my heart. <\p> 

<p> But a man cannot always decide for himself whether his own heart is <\p> 
<p> cold or warm.  It now impresses me that, if I erred at all in regard to <\p> 
<p> Hollingsworth, Zenobia, and Priscilla, it was through too much <\p> 
<p> sympathy, rather than too little. <\p> 

<p> To escape the irksomeness of these meditations, I resumed my post at <\p> 
<p> the window.  At first sight, there was nothing new to be noticed. The <\p> 
<p> general aspect of affairs was the same as yesterday, except that the <\p> 
<p> more decided inclemency of to-day had driven the sparrows to shelter, <\p> 
<p> and kept the cat within doors; whence, however, she soon emerged, <\p> 
<p> pursued by the cook, and with what looked like the better half of a <\p> 
<p> roast chicken in her mouth.  The young man in the dress-coat was <\p> 
<p> invisible; the two children, in the story below, seemed to be romping <\p> 
<p> about the room, under the superintendence of a nursery-maid.  The <\p> 
<p> damask curtains of the drawing-room, on the first floor, were now fully <\p> 
<p> displayed, festooned gracefully from top to bottom of the windows, <\p> 
<p> which extended from the ceiling to the carpet. A narrower window, at <\p> 
<p> the left of the drawing-room, gave light to what was probably a small <\p> 
<p> boudoir, within which I caught the faintest imaginable glimpse of a <\p> 
<p> girl's figure, in airy drapery.  Her arm was in regular movement, as if <\p> 
<p> she were busy with her German worsted, or some other such pretty and <\p> 
<p> unprofitable handiwork. <\p> 

<p> While intent upon making out this girlish shape, I became sensible that <\p> 
<p> a figure had appeared at one of the windows of the drawing-room. There <\p> 
<p> was a presentiment in my mind; or perhaps my first glance, imperfect <\p> 
<p> and sidelong as it was, had sufficed to convey subtile information of <\p> 
<p> the truth.  At any rate, it was with no positive surprise, but as if I <\p> 
<p> had all along expected the incident, that, directing my eyes <\p> 
<p> thitherward, I beheld--like a full-length picture, in the space between <\p> 
<p> the heavy festoons of the window curtains--no other than Zenobia!  At <\p> 
<p> the same instant, my thoughts made sure of the identity of the figure <\p> 
<p> in the boudoir.  It could only be Priscilla. <\p> 

<p> Zenobia was attired, not in the almost rustic costume which she had <\p> 
<p> heretofore worn, but in a fashionable morning-dress.  There was, <\p> 
<p> nevertheless, one familiar point.  She had, as usual, a flower in her <\p> 
<p> hair, brilliant and of a rare variety, else it had not been Zenobia. <\p> 
<p> After a brief pause at the window, she turned away, exemplifying, in <\p> 
<p> the few steps that removed her out of sight, that noble and beautiful <\p> 
<p> motion which characterized her as much as any other personal charm. Not <\p> 
<p> one woman in a thousand could move so admirably as Zenobia.  Many women <\p> 
<p> can sit gracefully; some can stand gracefully; and a few, perhaps, can <\p> 
<p> assume a series of graceful positions.  But natural movement is the <\p> 
<p> result and expression of the whole being, and cannot be well and nobly <\p> 
<p> performed unless responsive to something in the character.  I often <\p> 
<p> used to think that music--light and airy, wild and passionate, or the <\p> 
<p> full harmony of stately marches, in accordance with her varying <\p> 
<p> mood--should have attended Zenobia's footsteps. <\p> 

<p> I waited for her reappearance.  It was one peculiarity, distinguishing <\p> 
<p> Zenobia from most of her sex, that she needed for her moral well-being, <\p> 
<p> and never would forego, a large amount of physical exercise.  At <\p> 
<p> Blithedale, no inclemency of sky or muddiness of earth had ever impeded <\p> 
<p> her daily walks.  Here in town, she probably preferred to tread the <\p> 
<p> extent of the two drawing-rooms, and measure out the miles by spaces of <\p> 
<p> forty feet, rather than bedraggle her skirts over the sloppy pavements. <\p> 
<p> Accordingly, in about the time requisite to pass through the arch of <\p> 
<p> the sliding-doors to the front window, and to return upon her steps, <\p> 
<p> there she stood again, between the festoons of the crimson curtains. <\p> 
<p> But another personage was now added to the scene.  Behind Zenobia <\p> 
<p> appeared that face which I had first encountered in the wood-path; the <\p> 
<p> man who had passed, side by side with her, in such mysterious <\p> 
<p> familiarity and estrangement, beneath my vine curtained hermitage in <\p> 
<p> the tall pine-tree.  It was Westervelt.  And though he was looking <\p> 
<p> closely over her shoulder, it still seemed to me, as on the former <\p> 
<p> occasion, that Zenobia repelled him,--that, perchance, they mutually <\p> 
<p> repelled each other, by some incompatibility of their spheres. <\p> 

<p> This impression, however, might have been altogether the result of <\p> 
<p> fancy and prejudice in me.  The distance was so great as to obliterate <\p> 
<p> any play of feature by which I might otherwise have been made a <\p> 
<p> partaker of their counsels. <\p> 

<p> There now needed only Hollingsworth and old Moodie to complete the knot <\p> 
<p> of characters, whom a real intricacy of events, greatly assisted by my <\p> 
<p> method of insulating them from other relations, had kept so long upon <\p> 
<p> my mental stage, as actors in a drama.  In itself, perhaps, it was no <\p> 
<p> very remarkable event that they should thus come across me, at the <\p> 
<p> moment when I imagined myself free.  Zenobia, as I well knew, had <\p> 
<p> retained an establishment in town, and had not unfrequently withdrawn <\p> 
<p> herself from Blithedale during brief intervals, on one of which <\p> 
<p> occasions she had taken Priscilla along with her.  Nevertheless, there <\p> 
<p> seemed something fatal in the coincidence that had borne me to this one <\p> 
<p> spot, of all others in a great city, and transfixed me there, and <\p> 
<p> compelled me again to waste my already wearied sympathies on affairs <\p> 
<p> which were none of mine, and persons who cared little for me.  It <\p> 
<p> irritated my nerves; it affected me with a kind of heart-sickness. <\p> 
<p> After the effort which it cost me to fling them off,--after <\p> 
<p> consummating my escape, as I thought, from these goblins of flesh and <\p> 
<p> blood, and pausing to revive myself with a breath or two of an <\p> 
<p> atmosphere in which they should have no share,--it was a positive <\p> 
<p> despair to find the same figures arraying themselves before me, and <\p> 
<p> presenting their old problem in a shape that made it more insoluble <\p> 
<p> than ever. <\p> 

<p> I began to long for a catastrophe.  If the noble temper of <\p> 
<p> Hollingsworth's soul were doomed to be utterly corrupted by the too <\p> 
<p> powerful purpose which had grown out of what was noblest in him; if the <\p> 
<p> rich and generous qualities of Zenobia's womanhood might not save her; <\p> 
<p> if Priscilla must perish by her tenderness and faith, so simple and so <\p> 
<p> devout, then be it so!  Let it all come!  As for me, I would look on, <\p> 
<p> as it seemed my part to do, understandingly, if my intellect could <\p> 
<p> fathom the meaning and the moral, and, at all events, reverently and <\p> 
<p> sadly.  The curtain fallen, I would pass onward with my poor individual <\p> 
<p> life, which was now attenuated of much of its proper substance, and <\p> 
<p> diffused among many alien interests. <\p> 

<p> Meanwhile, Zenobia and her companion had retreated from the window. <\p> 
<p> Then followed an interval, during which I directed my eves towards the <\p> 
<p> figure in the boudoir.  Most certainly it was Priscilla, although <\p> 
<p> dressed with a novel and fanciful elegance.  The vague perception of <\p> 
<p> it, as viewed so far off, impressed me as if she had suddenly passed <\p> 
<p> out of a chrysalis state and put forth wings.  Her hands were not now <\p> 
<p> in motion.  She had dropt her work, and sat with her head thrown back, <\p> 
<p> in the same attitude that I had seen several times before, when she <\p> 
<p> seemed to be listening to an imperfectly distinguished sound. <\p> 

<p> Again the two figures in the drawing-room became visible.  They were <\p> 
<p> now a little withdrawn from the window, face to face, and, as I could <\p> 
<p> see by Zenobia's emphatic gestures, were discussing some subject in <\p> 
<p> which she, at least, felt a passionate concern.  By and by she broke <\p> 
<p> away, and vanished beyond my ken.  Westervelt approached the window, <\p> 
<p> and leaned his forehead against a pane of glass, displaying the sort of <\p> 
<p> smile on his handsome features which, when I before met him, had let me <\p> 
<p> into the secret of his gold-bordered teeth.  Every human being, when <\p> 
<p> given over to the Devil, is sure to have the wizard mark upon him, in <\p> 
<p> one form or another.  I fancied that this smile, with its peculiar <\p> 
<p> revelation, was the Devil's signet on the Professor. <\p> 

<p> This man, as I had soon reason to know, was endowed with a cat-like <\p> 
<p> circumspection; and though precisely the most unspiritual quality in <\p> 
<p> the world, it was almost as effective as spiritual insight in making <\p> 
<p> him acquainted with whatever it suited him to discover.  He now proved <\p> 
<p> it, considerably to my discomfiture, by detecting and recognizing me, <\p> 
<p> at my post of observation.  Perhaps I ought to have blushed at being <\p> 
<p> caught in such an evident scrutiny of Professor Westervelt and his <\p> 
<p> affairs.  Perhaps I did blush.  Be that as it might, I retained <\p> 
<p> presence of mind enough not to make my position yet more irksome by the <\p> 
<p> poltroonery of drawing back. <\p> 

<p> Westervelt looked into the depths of the drawing-room, and beckoned. <\p> 
<p> Immediately afterwards Zenobia appeared at the window, with color much <\p> 
<p> heightened, and eyes which, as my conscience whispered me, were <\p> 
<p> shooting bright arrows, barbed with scorn, across the intervening <\p> 
<p> space, directed full at my sensibilities as a gentleman.  If the truth <\p> 
<p> must be told, far as her flight-shot was, those arrows hit the mark. <\p> 
<p> She signified her recognition of me by a gesture with her head and <\p> 
<p> hand, comprising at once a salutation and dismissal.  The next moment <\p> 
<p> she administered one of those pitiless rebukes which a woman always has <\p> 
<p> at hand, ready for any offence (and which she so seldom spares on due <\p> 
<p> occasion), by letting down a white linen curtain between the festoons <\p> 
<p> of the damask ones.  It fell like the drop-curtain of a theatre, in the <\p> 
<p> interval between the acts. <\p> 

<p> Priscilla had disappeared from the boudoir.  But the dove still kept <\p> 
<p> her desolate perch on the peak of the attic window. <\p> 

<p> XIX. ZENOBIA'S DRAWING-ROOM <\p> 

<p> The remainder of the day, so far as I was concerned, was spent in <\p> 
<p> meditating on these recent incidents.  I contrived, and alternately <\p> 
<p> rejected, innumerable methods of accounting for the presence of Zenobia <\p> 
<p> and Priscilla, and the connection of Westervelt with both. It must be <\p> 
<p> owned, too, that I had a keen, revengeful sense of the insult inflicted <\p> 
<p> by Zenobia's scornful recognition, and more particularly by her letting <\p> 
<p> down the curtain; as if such were the proper barrier to be interposed <\p> 
<p> between a character like hers and a perceptive faculty like mine.  For, <\p> 
<p> was mine a mere vulgar curiosity? Zenobia should have known me better <\p> 
<p> than to suppose it.  She should have been able to appreciate that <\p> 
<p> quality of the intellect and the heart which impelled me (often against <\p> 
<p> my own will, and to the detriment of my own comfort) to live in other <\p> 
<p> lives, and to endeavor--by generous sympathies, by delicate intuitions, <\p> 
<p> by taking note of things too slight for record, and by bringing my <\p> 
<p> human spirit into manifold accordance with the companions whom God <\p> 
<p> assigned me--to learn the secret which was hidden even from themselves. <\p> 

<p> Of all possible observers, methought a woman like Zenobia and a man <\p> 
<p> like Hollingsworth should have selected me.  And now when the event has <\p> 
<p> long been past, I retain the same opinion of my fitness for the office. <\p> 
<p> True, I might have condemned them.  Had I been judge as well as <\p> 
<p> witness, my sentence might have been stern as that of destiny itself. <\p> 
<p> But, still, no trait of original nobility of character, no struggle <\p> 
<p> against temptation,--no iron necessity of will, on the one hand, nor <\p> 
<p> extenuating circumstance to be derived from passion and despair, on the <\p> 
<p> other,--no remorse that might coexist with error, even if powerless to <\p> 
<p> prevent it,--no proud repentance that should claim retribution as a <\p> 
<p> meed,--would go unappreciated.  True, again, I might give my full <\p> 
<p> assent to the punishment which was sure to follow. But it would be <\p> 
<p> given mournfully, and with undiminished love.  And, after all was <\p> 
<p> finished, I would come as if to gather up the white ashes of those who <\p> 
<p> had perished at the stake, and to tell the world--the wrong being now <\p> 
<p> atoned for--how much had perished there which it had never yet known <\p> 
<p> how to praise. <\p> 

<p> I sat in my rocking-chair, too far withdrawn from the window to expose <\p> 
<p> myself to another rebuke like that already inflicted.  My eyes still <\p> 
<p> wandered towards the opposite house, but without effecting any new <\p> 
<p> discoveries.  Late in the afternoon, the weathercock on the church <\p> 
<p> spire indicated a change of wind; the sun shone dimly out, as if the <\p> 
<p> golden wine of its beams were mingled half-and-half with water. <\p> 
<p> Nevertheless, they kindled up the whole range of edifices, threw a glow <\p> 
<p> over the windows, glistened on the wet roofs, and, slowly withdrawing <\p> 
<p> upward, perched upon the chimney-tops; thence they took a higher <\p> 
<p> flight, and lingered an instant on the tip of the spire, making it the <\p> 
<p> final point of more cheerful light in the whole sombre scene.  The next <\p> 
<p> moment, it was all gone.  The twilight fell into the area like a shower <\p> 
<p> of dusky snow, and before it was quite dark, the gong of the hotel <\p> 
<p> summoned me to tea. <\p> 

<p> When I returned to my chamber, the glow of an astral lamp was <\p> 
<p> penetrating mistily through the white curtain of Zenobia's <\p> 
<p> drawing-room.  The shadow of a passing figure was now and then cast <\p> 
<p> upon this medium, but with too vague an outline for even my adventurous <\p> 
<p> conjectures to read the hieroglyphic that it presented. <\p> 

<p> All at once, it occurred to me how very absurd was my behavior in thus <\p> 
<p> tormenting myself with crazy hypotheses as to what was going on within <\p> 
<p> that drawing-room, when it was at my option to be personally present <\p> 
<p> there, My relations with Zenobia, as yet unchanged,--as a familiar <\p> 
<p> friend, and associated in the same life-long enterprise,--gave me the <\p> 
<p> right, and made it no more than kindly courtesy demanded, to call on <\p> 
<p> her.  Nothing, except our habitual independence of conventional rules <\p> 
<p> at Blithedale, could have kept me from sooner recognizing this duty. <\p> 
<p> At all events, it should now be performed. <\p> 

<p> In compliance with this sudden impulse, I soon found myself actually <\p> 
<p> within the house, the rear of which, for two days past, I had been so <\p> 
<p> sedulously watching.  A servant took my card, and, immediately <\p> 
<p> returning, ushered me upstairs.  On the way, I heard a rich, and, as it <\p> 
<p> were, triumphant burst of music from a piano, in which I felt Zenobia's <\p> 
<p> character, although heretofore I had known nothing of her skill upon <\p> 
<p> the instrument.  Two or three canary-birds, excited by this gush of <\p> 
<p> sound, sang piercingly, and did their utmost to produce a kindred <\p> 
<p> melody.  A bright illumination streamed through, the door of the front <\p> 
<p> drawing-room; and I had barely stept across the threshold before <\p> 
<p> Zenobia came forward to meet me, laughing, and with an extended hand. <\p> 

<p> "Ah, Mr. Coverdale," said she, still smiling, but, as I thought, with a <\p> 
<p> good deal of scornful anger underneath, "it has gratified me to see the <\p> 
<p> interest which you continue to take in my affairs!  I have long <\p> 
<p> recognized you as a sort of transcendental Yankee, with all the native <\p> 
<p> propensity of your countrymen to investigate matters that come within <\p> 
<p> their range, but rendered almost poetical, in your case, by the refined <\p> 
<p> methods which you adopt for its gratification.  After all, it was an <\p> 
<p> unjustifiable stroke, on my part,--was it not?--to let down the window <\p> 
<p> curtain!" <\p> 

<p> "I cannot call it a very wise one," returned I, with a secret <\p> 
<p> bitterness, which, no doubt, Zenobia appreciated.  "It is really <\p> 
<p> impossible to hide anything in this world, to say nothing of the next. <\p> 
<p> All that we ought to ask, therefore, is, that the witnesses of our <\p> 
<p> conduct, and the speculators on our motives, should be capable of <\p> 
<p> taking the highest view which the circumstances of the case may admit. <\p> 
<p> So much being secured, I, for one, would be most happy in feeling <\p> 
<p> myself followed everywhere by an indefatigable human sympathy." <\p> 

<p> "We must trust for intelligent sympathy to our guardian angels, if any <\p> 
<p> there be," said Zenobia.  "As long as the only spectator of my poor <\p> 
<p> tragedy is a young man at the window of his hotel, I must still claim <\p> 
<p> the liberty to drop the curtain." <\p> 

<p> While this passed, as Zenobia's hand was extended, I had applied the <\p> 
<p> very slightest touch of my fingers to her own.  In spite of an external <\p> 
<p> freedom, her manner made me sensible that we stood upon no real terms <\p> 
<p> of confidence.  The thought came sadly across me, how great was the <\p> 
<p> contrast betwixt this interview and our first meeting. Then, in the <\p> 
<p> warm light of the country fireside, Zenobia had greeted me cheerily and <\p> 
<p> hopefully, with a full sisterly grasp of the hand, conveying as much <\p> 
<p> kindness in it as other women could have evinced by the pressure of <\p> 
<p> both arms around my neck, or by yielding a cheek to the brotherly <\p> 
<p> salute.  The difference was as complete as between her appearance at <\p> 
<p> that time--so simply attired, and with only the one superb flower in <\p> 
<p> her hair--and now, when her beauty was set off by all that dress and <\p> 
<p> ornament could do for it.  And they did much.  Not, indeed, that they <\p> 
<p> created or added anything to what Nature had lavishly done for Zenobia. <\p> 
<p> But, those costly robes which she had on, those flaming jewels on her <\p> 
<p> neck, served as lamps to display the personal advantages which required <\p> 
<p> nothing less than such an illumination to be fully seen.  Even her <\p> 
<p> characteristic flower, though it seemed to be still there, had <\p> 
<p> undergone a cold and bright transfiguration; it was a flower <\p> 
<p> exquisitely imitated in jeweller's work, and imparting the last touch <\p> 
<p> that transformed Zenobia into a work of art. <\p> 

<p> "I scarcely feel," I could not forbear saying, "as if we had ever met <\p> 
<p> before.  How many years ago it seems since we last sat beneath Eliot's <\p> 
<p> pulpit, with Hollingsworth extended on the fallen leaves, and Priscilla <\p> 
<p> at his feet!  Can it be, Zenobia, that you ever really numbered <\p> 
<p> yourself with our little band of earnest, thoughtful, philanthropic <\p> 
<p> laborers?" <\p> 

<p> "Those ideas have their time and place," she answered coldly.  "But I <\p> 
<p> fancy it must be a very circumscribed mind that can find room for no <\p> 
<p> other." <\p> 

<p> Her manner bewildered me.  Literally, moreover, I was dazzled by the <\p> 
<p> brilliancy of the room.  A chandelier hung down in the centre, glowing <\p> 
<p> with I know not how many lights; there were separate lamps, also, on <\p> 
<p> two or three tables, and on marble brackets, adding their white <\p> 
<p> radiance to that of the chandelier.  The furniture was exceedingly <\p> 
<p> rich.  Fresh from our old farmhouse, with its homely board and benches <\p> 
<p> in the dining-room, and a few wicker chairs in the best parlor, it <\p> 
<p> struck me that here was the fulfilment of every fantasy of an <\p> 
<p> imagination revelling in various methods of costly self-indulgence and <\p> 
<p> splendid ease.  Pictures, marbles, vases,--in brief, more shapes of <\p> 
<p> luxury than there could be any object in enumerating, except for an <\p> 
<p> auctioneer's advertisement,--and the whole repeated and doubled by the <\p> 
<p> reflection of a great mirror, which showed me Zenobia's proud figure, <\p> 
<p> likewise, and my own.  It cost me, I acknowledge, a bitter sense of <\p> 
<p> shame, to perceive in myself a positive effort to bear up against the <\p> 
<p> effect which Zenobia sought to impose on me.  I reasoned against her, <\p> 
<p> in my secret mind, and strove so to keep my footing.  In the <\p> 
<p> gorgeousness with which she had surrounded herself,--in the redundance <\p> 
<p> of personal ornament, which the largeness of her physical nature and <\p> 
<p> the rich type of her beauty caused to seem so suitable,--I malevolently <\p> 
<p> beheld the true character of the woman, passionate, luxurious, lacking <\p> 
<p> simplicity, not deeply refined, incapable of pure and perfect taste. <\p> 
<p> But, the next instant, she was too powerful for all my opposing <\p> 
<p> struggles.  I saw how fit it was that she should make herself as <\p> 
<p> gorgeous as she pleased, and should do a thousand things that would <\p> 
<p> have been ridiculous in the poor, thin, weakly characters of other <\p> 
<p> women.  To this day, however, I hardly know whether I then beheld <\p> 
<p> Zenobia in her truest attitude, or whether that were the truer one in <\p> 
<p> which she had presented herself at Blithedale.  In both, there was <\p> 
<p> something like the illusion which a great actress flings around her. <\p> 

<p> "Have you given up Blithedale forever?"  I inquired. <\p> 

<p> "Why should you think so?" asked she. <\p> 

<p> "I cannot tell," answered I; "except that it appears all like a dream <\p> 
<p> that we were ever there together." <\p> 

<p> "It is not so to me," said Zenobia.  "I should think it a poor and <\p> 
<p> meagre nature that is capable of but one set of forms, and must convert <\p> 
<p> all the past into a dream merely because the present happens to be <\p> 
<p> unlike it.  Why should we be content with our homely life of a few <\p> 
<p> months past, to the exclusion of all other modes?  It was good; but <\p> 
<p> there are other lives as good, or better.  Not, you will understand, <\p> 
<p> that I condemn those who give themselves up to it more entirely than I, <\p> 
<p> for myself, should deem it wise to do." <\p> 

<p> It irritated me, this self-complacent, condescending, qualified <\p> 
<p> approval and criticism of a system to which many individuals--perhaps <\p> 
<p> as highly endowed as our gorgeous Zenobia--had contributed their all of <\p> 
<p> earthly endeavor, and their loftiest aspirations.  I determined to make <\p> 
<p> proof if there were any spell that would exorcise her out of the part <\p> 
<p> which she seemed to be acting.  She should be compelled to give me a <\p> 
<p> glimpse of something true; some nature, some passion, no matter whether <\p> 
<p> right or wrong, provided it were real. <\p> 

<p> "Your allusion to that class of circumscribed characters who can live <\p> 
<p> only in one mode of life," remarked I coolly, "reminds me of our poor <\p> 
<p> friend Hollingsworth.  Possibly he was in your thoughts when you spoke <\p> 
<p> thus.  Poor fellow!  It is a pity that, by the fault of a narrow <\p> 
<p> education, he should have so completely immolated himself to that one <\p> 
<p> idea of his, especially as the slightest modicum of common-sense would <\p> 
<p> teach him its utter impracticability.  Now that I have returned into <\p> 
<p> the world, and can look at his project from a distance, it requires <\p> 
<p> quite all my real regard for this respectable and well-intentioned man <\p> 
<p> to prevent me laughing at him,--as I find society at large does." <\p> 

<p> Zenobia's eyes darted lightning, her cheeks flushed, the vividness of <\p> 
<p> her expression was like the effect of a powerful light flaming up <\p> 
<p> suddenly within her.  My experiment had fully succeeded.  She had shown <\p> 
<p> me the true flesh and blood of her heart, by thus involuntarily <\p> 
<p> resenting my slight, pitying, half-kind, half-scornful mention of the <\p> 
<p> man who was all in all with her.  She herself probably felt this; for <\p> 
<p> it was hardly a moment before she tranquillized her uneven breath, and <\p> 
<p> seemed as proud and self-possessed as ever. <\p> 

<p> "I rather imagine," said she quietly, "that your appreciation falls <\p> 
<p> short of Mr. Hollingsworth's just claims.  Blind enthusiasm, absorption <\p> 
<p> in one idea, I grant, is generally ridiculous, and must be fatal to the <\p> 
<p> respectability of an ordinary man; it requires a very high and powerful <\p> 
<p> character to make it otherwise.  But a great man--as, perhaps, you do <\p> 
<p> not know--attains his normal condition only through the inspiration of <\p> 
<p> one great idea.  As a friend of Mr. Hollingsworth, and, at the same <\p> 
<p> time, a calm observer, I must tell you that he seems to me such a man. <\p> 
<p> But you are very pardonable for fancying him ridiculous.  Doubtless, he <\p> 
<p> is so--to you!  There can be no truer test of the noble and heroic, in <\p> 
<p> any individual, than the degree in which he possesses the faculty of <\p> 
<p> distinguishing heroism from absurdity." <\p> 

<p> I dared make no retort to Zenobia's concluding apothegm.  In truth, I <\p> 
<p> admired her fidelity.  It gave me a new sense of Hollingsworth's native <\p> 
<p> power, to discover that his influence was no less potent with this <\p> 
<p> beautiful woman here, in the midst of artificial life, than it had been <\p> 
<p> at the foot of the gray rock, and among the wild birch-trees of the <\p> 
<p> wood-path, when she so passionately pressed his hand against her heart. <\p> 
<p> The great, rude, shaggy, swarthy man!  And Zenobia loved him! <\p> 

<p> "Did you bring Priscilla with you?"  I resumed.  "Do you know I have <\p> 
<p> sometimes fancied it not quite safe, considering the susceptibility of <\p> 
<p> her temperament, that she should be so constantly within the sphere of <\p> 
<p> a man like Hollingsworth.  Such tender and delicate natures, among your <\p> 
<p> sex, have often, I believe, a very adequate appreciation of the heroic <\p> 
<p> element in men.  But then, again, I should suppose them as likely as <\p> 
<p> any other women to make a reciprocal impression. Hollingsworth could <\p> 
<p> hardly give his affections to a person capable of taking an independent <\p> 
<p> stand, but only to one whom he might absorb into himself.  He has <\p> 
<p> certainly shown great tenderness for Priscilla." <\p> 

<p> Zenobia had turned aside.  But I caught the reflection of her face in <\p> 
<p> the mirror, and saw that it was very pale,--as pale, in her rich <\p> 
<p> attire, as if a shroud were round her. <\p> 

<p> "Priscilla is here," said she, her voice a little lower than usual. <\p> 
<p> "Have not you learnt as much from your chamber window?  Would you like <\p> 
<p> to see her?" <\p> 

<p> She made a step or two into the back drawing-room, and <\p> 
<p> called,--"Priscilla!  Dear Priscilla!" <\p> 

<p> XX. THEY VANISH <\p> 

<p> Priscilla immediately answered the summons, and made her appearance <\p> 
<p> through the door of the boudoir.  I had conceived the idea, which I now <\p> 
<p> recognized as a very foolish one, that Zenobia would have taken <\p> 
<p> measures to debar me from an interview with this girl, between whom and <\p> 
<p> herself there was so utter an opposition of their dearest interests, <\p> 
<p> that, on one part or the other, a great grief, if not likewise a great <\p> 
<p> wrong, seemed a matter of necessity.  But, as Priscilla was only a leaf <\p> 
<p> floating on the dark current of events, without influencing them by her <\p> 
<p> own choice or plan, as she probably guessed not whither the stream was <\p> 
<p> bearing her, nor perhaps even felt its inevitable movement,--there <\p> 
<p> could be no peril of her communicating to me any intelligence with <\p> 
<p> regard to Zenobia's purposes. <\p> 

<p> On perceiving me, she came forward with great quietude of manner; and <\p> 
<p> when I held out my hand, her own moved slightly towards it, as if <\p> 
<p> attracted by a feeble degree of magnetism. <\p> 

<p> "I am glad to see you, my dear Priscilla," said I, still holding her <\p> 
<p> hand; "but everything that I meet with nowadays makes me wonder whether <\p> 
<p> I am awake.  You, especially, have always seemed like a figure in a <\p> 
<p> dream, and now more than ever." <\p> 

<p> "Oh, there is substance in these fingers of mine," she answered, giving <\p> 
<p> my hand the faintest possible pressure, and then taking away her own. <\p> 
<p> "Why do you call me a dream?  Zenobia is much more like one than I; she <\p> 
<p> is so very, very beautiful!  And, I suppose," added Priscilla, as if <\p> 
<p> thinking aloud, "everybody sees it, as I do." <\p> 

<p> But, for my part, it was Priscilla's beauty, not Zenobia's, of which I <\p> 
<p> was thinking at that moment.  She was a person who could be quite <\p> 
<p> obliterated, so far as beauty went, by anything unsuitable in her <\p> 
<p> attire; her charm was not positive and material enough to bear up <\p> 
<p> against a mistaken choice of color, for instance, or fashion.  It was <\p> 
<p> safest, in her case, to attempt no art of dress; for it demanded the <\p> 
<p> most perfect taste, or else the happiest accident in the world, to give <\p> 
<p> her precisely the adornment which she needed.  She was now dressed in <\p> 
<p> pure white, set off with some kind of a gauzy fabric, which--as I bring <\p> 
<p> up her figure in my memory, with a faint gleam on her shadowy hair, and <\p> 
<p> her dark eyes bent shyly on mine, through all the vanished years--seems <\p> 
<p> to be floating about her like a mist.  I wondered what Zenobia meant by <\p> 
<p> evolving so much loveliness out of this poor girl.  It was what few <\p> 
<p> women could afford to do; for, as I looked from one to the other, the <\p> 
<p> sheen and splendor of Zenobia's presence took nothing from Priscilla's <\p> 
<p> softer spell, if it might not rather be thought to add to it. <\p> 

<p> "What do you think of her?" asked Zenobia. <\p> 

<p> I could not understand the look of melancholy kindness with which <\p> 
<p> Zenobia regarded her.  She advanced a step, and beckoning Priscilla <\p> 
<p> near her, kissed her cheek; then, with a slight gesture of repulse, she <\p> 
<p> moved to the other side of the room.  I followed. <\p> 

<p> "She is a wonderful creature," I said.  "Ever since she came among us, <\p> 
<p> I have been dimly sensible of just this charm which you have brought <\p> 
<p> out.  But it was never absolutely visible till now.  She is as lovely <\p> 
<p> as a flower!" <\p> 

<p> "Well, say so if you like," answered Zenobia.  "You are a poet,--at <\p> 
<p> least, as poets go nowadays,--and must be allowed to make an <\p> 
<p> opera-glass of your imagination, when you look at women.  I wonder, in <\p> 
<p> such Arcadian freedom of falling in love as we have lately enjoyed, it <\p> 
<p> never occurred to you to fall in love with Priscilla.  In society, <\p> 
<p> indeed, a genuine American never dreams of stepping across the <\p> 
<p> inappreciable air-line which separates one class from another.  But <\p> 
<p> what was rank to the colonists of Blithedale?" <\p> 

<p> "There were other reasons," I replied, "why I should have demonstrated <\p> 
<p> myself an ass, had I fallen in love with Priscilla.  By the bye, has <\p> 
<p> Hollingsworth ever seen her in this dress?" <\p> 

<p> "Why do you bring up his name at every turn?" asked Zenobia in an <\p> 
<p> undertone, and with a malign look which wandered from my face to <\p> 
<p> Priscilla's.  "You know not what you do!  It is dangerous, sir, believe <\p> 
<p> me, to tamper thus with earnest human passions, out of your own mere <\p> 
<p> idleness, and for your sport.  I will endure it no longer!  Take care <\p> 
<p> that it does not happen again!  I warn you!" <\p> 

<p> "You partly wrong me, if not wholly," I responded.  "It is an uncertain <\p> 
<p> sense of some duty to perform, that brings my thoughts, and therefore <\p> 
<p> my words, continually to that one point." <\p> 

<p> "Oh, this stale excuse of duty!" said Zenobia, in a whisper so full of <\p> 
<p> scorn that it penetrated me like the hiss of a serpent.  "I have often <\p> 
<p> heard it before, from those who sought to interfere with me, and I know <\p> 
<p> precisely what it signifies.  Bigotry; self-conceit; an insolent <\p> 
<p> curiosity; a meddlesome temper; a cold-blooded criticism, founded on a <\p> 
<p> shallow interpretation of half-perceptions; a monstrous scepticism in <\p> 
<p> regard to any conscience or any wisdom, except one's own; a most <\p> 
<p> irreverent propensity to thrust Providence aside, and substitute one's <\p> 
<p> self in its awful place,--out of these, and other motives as miserable <\p> 
<p> as these, comes your idea of duty!  But, beware, sir!  With all your <\p> 
<p> fancied acuteness, you step blindfold into these affairs.  For any <\p> 
<p> mischief that may follow your interference, I hold you responsible!" <\p> 

<p> It was evident that, with but a little further provocation, the lioness <\p> 
<p> would turn to bay; if, indeed, such were not her attitude already.  I <\p> 
<p> bowed, and not very well knowing what else to do, was about to <\p> 
<p> withdraw.  But, glancing again towards Priscilla, who had retreated <\p> 
<p> into a corner, there fell upon my heart an intolerable burden of <\p> 
<p> despondency, the purport of which I could not tell, but only felt it to <\p> 
<p> bear reference to her.  I approached and held out my hand; a gesture, <\p> 
<p> however, to which she made no response.  It was always one of her <\p> 
<p> peculiarities that she seemed to shrink from even the most friendly <\p> 
<p> touch, unless it were Zenobia's or Hollingsworth's. Zenobia, all this <\p> 
<p> while, stood watching us, but with a careless expression, as if it <\p> 
<p> mattered very little what might pass. <\p> 

<p> "Priscilla," I inquired, lowering my voice, "when do you go back to <\p> 
<p> Blithedale?" <\p> 

<p> "Whenever they please to take me," said she. <\p> 

<p> "Did you come away of your own free will?"  I asked. <\p> 

<p> "I am blown about like a leaf," she replied.  "I never have any free <\p> 
<p> will." <\p> 

<p> "Does Hollingsworth know that you are here?" said I. <\p> 

<p> "He bade me come," answered Priscilla. <\p> 

<p> She looked at me, I thought, with an air of surprise, as if the idea <\p> 
<p> were incomprehensible that she should have taken this step without his <\p> 
<p> agency. <\p> 

<p> "What a gripe this man has laid upon her whole being!" muttered I <\p> 
<p> between my teeth. <\p> 

<p> "Well, as Zenobia so kindly intimates, I have no more business here. I <\p> 
<p> wash my hands of it all.  On Hollingsworth's head be the consequences! <\p> 
<p> Priscilla," I added aloud, "I know not that ever we may meet again. <\p> 
<p> Farewell!" <\p> 

<p> As I spoke the word, a carriage had rumbled along the street, and stopt <\p> 
<p> before the house.  The doorbell rang, and steps were immediately <\p> 
<p> afterwards heard on the staircase.  Zenobia had thrown a shawl over her <\p> 
<p> dress. <\p> 

<p> "Mr. Coverdale," said she, with cool courtesy, "you will perhaps excuse <\p> 
<p> us.  We have an engagement, and are going out." <\p> 

<p> "Whither?"  I demanded. <\p> 

<p> "Is not that a little more than you are entitled to inquire?" said she, <\p> 
<p> with a smile.  "At all events, it does not suit me to tell you." <\p> 

<p> The door of the drawing-room opened, and Westervelt appeared.  I <\p> 
<p> observed that he was elaborately dressed, as if for some grand <\p> 
<p> entertainment.  My dislike for this man was infinite.  At that moment <\p> 
<p> it amounted to nothing less than a creeping of the flesh, as when, <\p> 
<p> feeling about in a dark place, one touches something cold and slimy, <\p> 
<p> and questions what the secret hatefulness may be.  And still I could <\p> 
<p> not but acknowledge that, for personal beauty, for polish of manner, <\p> 
<p> for all that externally befits a gentleman, there was hardly another <\p> 
<p> like him.  After bowing to Zenobia, and graciously saluting Priscilla <\p> 
<p> in her corner, he recognized me by a slight but courteous inclination. <\p> 

<p> "Come, Priscilla," said Zenobia; "it is time.  Mr. Coverdale, <\p> 
<p> good-evening." <\p> 

<p> As Priscilla moved slowly forward, I met her in the middle of the <\p> 
<p> drawing-room. <\p> 

<p> "Priscilla," said I, in the hearing of them all, "do you know whither <\p> 
<p> you are going?" <\p> 

<p> "I do not know," she answered. <\p> 

<p> "Is it wise to go, and is it your choice to go?"  I asked.  "If not, I <\p> 
<p> am your friend, and Hollingsworth's friend.  Tell me so, at once." <\p> 

<p> "Possibly," observed Westervelt, smiling, "Priscilla sees in me an <\p> 
<p> older friend than either Mr. Coverdale or Mr. Hollingsworth.  I shall <\p> 
<p> willingly leave the matter at her option." <\p> 

<p> While thus speaking, he made a gesture of kindly invitation, and <\p> 
<p> Priscilla passed me, with the gliding movement of a sprite, and took <\p> 
<p> his offered arm.  He offered the other to Zenobia; but she turned her <\p> 
<p> proud and beautiful face upon him with a look which--judging from what <\p> 
<p> I caught of it in profile--would undoubtedly have smitten the man dead, <\p> 
<p> had he possessed any heart, or had this glance attained to it.  It <\p> 
<p> seemed to rebound, however, from his courteous visage, like an arrow <\p> 
<p> from polished steel.  They all three descended the stairs; and when I <\p> 
<p> likewise reached the street door, the carriage was already rolling away. <\p> 

<p> XXI. AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE <\p> 

<p> Thus excluded from everybody's confidence, and attaining no further, by <\p> 
<p> my most earnest study, than to an uncertain sense of something hidden <\p> 
<p> from me, it would appear reasonable that I should have flung off all <\p> 
<p> these alien perplexities.  Obviously, my best course was to betake <\p> 
<p> myself to new scenes.  Here I was only an intruder.  Elsewhere there <\p> 
<p> might be circumstances in which I could establish a personal interest, <\p> 
<p> and people who would respond, with a portion of their sympathies, for <\p> 
<p> so much as I should bestow of mine. <\p> 

<p> Nevertheless, there occurred to me one other thing to be done. <\p> 
<p> Remembering old Moodie, and his relationship with Priscilla, I <\p> 
<p> determined to seek an interview, for the purpose of ascertaining <\p> 
<p> whether the knot of affairs was as inextricable on that side as I found <\p> 
<p> it on all others.  Being tolerably well acquainted with the old man's <\p> 
<p> haunts, I went, the next day, to the saloon of a certain establishment <\p> 
<p> about which he often lurked.  It was a reputable place enough, <\p> 
<p> affording good entertainment in the way of meat, drink, and fumigation; <\p> 
<p> and there, in my young and idle days and nights, when I was neither <\p> 
<p> nice nor wise, I had often amused myself with watching the staid humors <\p> 
<p> and sober jollities of the thirsty souls around me. <\p> 

<p> At my first entrance, old Moodie was not there.  The more patiently to <\p> 
<p> await him, I lighted a cigar, and establishing myself in a corner, took <\p> 
<p> a quiet, and, by sympathy, a boozy kind of pleasure in the customary <\p> 
<p> life that was going forward.  The saloon was fitted up with a good deal <\p> 
<p> of taste.  There were pictures on the walls, and among them an <\p> 
<p> oil-painting of a beefsteak, with such an admirable show of juicy <\p> 
<p> tenderness, that the beholder sighed to think it merely visionary, and <\p> 
<p> incapable of ever being put upon a gridiron.  Another work of high art <\p> 
<p> was the lifelike representation of a noble sirloin; another, the <\p> 
<p> hindquarters of a deer, retaining the hoofs and tawny fur; another, the <\p> 
<p> head and shoulders of a salmon; and, still more exquisitely finished, a <\p> 
<p> brace of canvasback ducks, in which the mottled feathers were depicted <\p> 
<p> with the accuracy of a daguerreotype. Some very hungry painter, I <\p> 
<p> suppose, had wrought these subjects of still-life, heightening his <\p> 
<p> imagination with his appetite, and earning, it is to be hoped, the <\p> 
<p> privilege of a daily dinner off whichever of his pictorial viands he <\p> 
<p> liked best. <\p> 

<p> Then there was a fine old cheese, in which you could almost discern the <\p> 
<p> mites; and some sardines, on a small plate, very richly done, and <\p> 
<p> looking as if oozy with the oil in which they had been smothered. All <\p> 
<p> these things were so perfectly imitated, that you seemed to have the <\p> 
<p> genuine article before you, and yet with an indescribable, ideal charm; <\p> 
<p> it took away the grossness from what was fleshiest and fattest, and <\p> 
<p> thus helped the life of man, even in its earthliest relations, to <\p> 
<p> appear rich and noble, as well as warm, cheerful, and substantial. <\p> 
<p> There were pictures, too, of gallant revellers, those of the old time, <\p> 
<p> Flemish, apparently, with doublets and slashed sleeves, drinking their <\p> 
<p> wine out of fantastic, long-stemmed glasses; quaffing joyously, <\p> 
<p> quaffing forever, with inaudible laughter and song; while the champagne <\p> 
<p> bubbled immortally against their moustaches, or the purple tide of <\p> 
<p> Burgundy ran inexhaustibly down their throats. <\p> 

<p> But, in an obscure corner of the saloon, there was a little Picture <\p> 
<p> excellently done, moreover of a ragged, bloated, New England toper, <\p> 
<p> stretched out on a bench, in the heavy, apoplectic sleep of <\p> 
<p> drunkenness.  The death-in-life was too well portrayed.  You smelt the <\p> 
<p> fumy liquor that had brought on this syncope.  Your only comfort lay in <\p> 
<p> the forced reflection, that, real as he looked, the poor caitiff was <\p> 
<p> but imaginary, a bit of painted canvass, whom no delirium tremens, nor <\p> 
<p> so much as a retributive headache, awaited, on the morrow. <\p> 

<p> By this time, it being past eleven o'clock, the two bar-keepers of the <\p> 
<p> saloon were in pretty constant activity.  One of these young men had a <\p> 
<p> rare faculty in the concoction of gin-cocktails.  It was a spectacle to <\p> 
<p> behold, how, with a tumbler in each hand, he tossed the contents from <\p> 
<p> one to the other.  Never conveying it awry, nor spilling the least <\p> 
<p> drop, he compelled the frothy liquor, as it seemed to me, to spout <\p> 
<p> forth from one glass and descend into the other, in a great parabolic <\p> 
<p> curve, as well-defined and calculable as a planet's orbit.  He had a <\p> 
<p> good forehead, with a particularly large development just above the <\p> 
<p> eyebrows; fine intellectual gifts, no doubt, which he had educated to <\p> 
<p> this profitable end; being famous for nothing but gin-cocktails, and <\p> 
<p> commanding a fair salary by his one accomplishment. These cocktails, <\p> 
<p> and other artificial combinations of liquor, (of which there were at <\p> 
<p> least a score, though mostly, I suspect, fantastic in their <\p> 
<p> differences,) were much in favor with the younger class of customers, <\p> 
<p> who, at farthest, had only reached the second stage of potatory life. <\p> 
<p> The staunch, old soakers, on the other hand men who, if put on tap, <\p> 
<p> would have yielded a red alcoholic liquor, by way of blood usually <\p> 
<p> confined themselves to plain brandy-and-water, gin, or West India rum; <\p> 
<p> and, oftentimes, they prefaced their dram with some medicinal remark as <\p> 
<p> to the wholesomeness and stomachic qualities of that particular drink. <\p> 
<p> Two or three appeared to have bottles of their own behind the counter; <\p> 
<p> and, winking one red eye to the bar-keeper, he forthwith produced these <\p> 
<p> choicest and peculiar cordials, which it was a matter of great interest <\p> 
<p> and favor, among their acquaintances, to obtain a sip of. <\p> 

<p> Agreeably to the Yankee habit, under whatever circumstances, the <\p> 
<p> deportment of all these good fellows, old or young, was decorous and <\p> 
<p> thoroughly correct.  They grew only the more sober in their cups; there <\p> 
<p> was no confused babble nor boisterous laughter.  They sucked in the <\p> 
<p> joyous fire of the decanters and kept it smouldering in their inmost <\p> 
<p> recesses, with a bliss known only to the heart which it warmed and <\p> 
<p> comforted.  Their eyes twinkled a little, to be sure; they hemmed <\p> 
<p> vigorously after each glass, and laid a hand upon the pit of the <\p> 
<p> stomach, as if the pleasant titillation there was what constituted the <\p> 
<p> tangible part of their enjoyment.  In that spot, unquestionably, and <\p> 
<p> not in the brain, was the acme of the whole affair.  But the true <\p> 
<p> purpose of their drinking--and one that will induce men to drink, or do <\p> 
<p> something equivalent, as long as this weary world shall endure--was the <\p> 
<p> renewed youth and vigor, the brisk, cheerful sense of things present <\p> 
<p> and to come, with which, for about a quarter of an hour, the dram <\p> 
<p> permeated their systems.  And when such quarters of an hour can be <\p> 
<p> obtained in some mode less baneful to the great sum of a man's <\p> 
<p> life,--but, nevertheless, with a little spice of impropriety, to give <\p> 
<p> it a wild flavor,--we temperance people may ring out our bells for <\p> 
<p> victory! <\p> 

<p> The prettiest object in the saloon was a tiny fountain, which threw up <\p> 
<p> its feathery jet through the counter, and sparkled down again into an <\p> 
<p> oval basin, or lakelet, containing several goldfishes.  There was a bed <\p> 
<p> of bright sand at the bottom, strewn with coral and rock-work; and the <\p> 
<p> fishes went gleaming about, now turning up the sheen of a golden side, <\p> 
<p> and now vanishing into the shadows of the water, like the fanciful <\p> 
<p> thoughts that coquet with a poet in his dream.  Never before, I <\p> 
<p> imagine, did a company of water-drinkers remain so entirely <\p> 
<p> uncontaminated by the bad example around them; nor could I help <\p> 
<p> wondering that it had not occurred to any freakish inebriate to empty a <\p> 
<p> glass of liquor into their lakelet.  What a delightful idea!  Who would <\p> 
<p> not be a fish, if he could inhale jollity with the essential element of <\p> 
<p> his existence! <\p> 

<p> I had begun to despair of meeting old Moodie, when, all at once, I <\p> 
<p> recognized his hand and arm protruding from behind a screen that was <\p> 
<p> set up for the accommodation of bashful topers.  As a matter of course, <\p> 
<p> he had one of Priscilla's little purses, and was quietly insinuating it <\p> 
<p> under the notice of a person who stood near.  This was always old <\p> 
<p> Moodie's way.  You hardly ever saw him advancing towards you, but <\p> 
<p> became aware of his proximity without being able to guess how he had <\p> 
<p> come thither.  He glided about like a spirit, assuming visibility close <\p> 
<p> to your elbow, offering his petty trifles of merchandise, remaining <\p> 
<p> long enough for you to purchase, if so disposed, and then taking <\p> 
<p> himself off, between two breaths, while you happened to be thinking of <\p> 
<p> something else. <\p> 

<p> By a sort of sympathetic impulse that often controlled me in those more <\p> 
<p> impressible days of my life, I was induced to approach this old man in <\p> 
<p> a mode as undemonstrative as his own.  Thus, when, according to his <\p> 
<p> custom, he was probably just about to vanish, he found me at his elbow. <\p> 

<p> "Ah!" said he, with more emphasis than was usual with him.  "It is Mr. <\p> 
<p> Coverdale!" <\p> 

<p> "Yes, Mr. Moodie, your old acquaintance," answered I. "It is some time <\p> 
<p> now since we ate luncheon together at Blithedale, and a good deal <\p> 
<p> longer since our little talk together at the street corner." <\p> 

<p> "That was a good while ago," said the old man. <\p> 

<p> And he seemed inclined to say not a word more.  His existence looked so <\p> 
<p> colorless and torpid,--so very faintly shadowed on the canvas of <\p> 
<p> reality,--that I was half afraid lest he should altogether disappear, <\p> 
<p> even while my eyes were fixed full upon his figure.  He was certainly <\p> 
<p> the wretchedest old ghost in the world, with his crazy hat, the dingy <\p> 
<p> handkerchief about his throat, his suit of threadbare gray, and <\p> 
<p> especially that patch over his right eye, behind which he always seemed <\p> 
<p> to be hiding himself.  There was one method, however, of bringing him <\p> 
<p> out into somewhat stronger relief.  A glass of brandy would effect it. <\p> 
<p> Perhaps the gentler influence of a bottle of claret might do the same. <\p> 
<p> Nor could I think it a matter for the recording angel to write down <\p> 
<p> against me, if--with my painful consciousness of the frost in this old <\p> 
<p> man's blood, and the positive ice that had congealed about his heart--I <\p> 
<p> should thaw him out, were it only for an hour, with the summer warmth <\p> 
<p> of a little wine.  What else could possibly be done for him?  How else <\p> 
<p> could he be imbued with energy enough to hope for a happier state <\p> 
<p> hereafter?  How else be inspired to say his prayers?  For there are <\p> 
<p> states of our spiritual system when the throb of the soul's life is too <\p> 
<p> faint and weak to render us capable of religious aspiration. <\p> 

<p> "Mr. Moodie," said I, "shall we lunch together?  And would you like to <\p> 
<p> drink a glass of wine?" <\p> 

<p> His one eye gleamed.  He bowed; and it impressed me that he grew to be <\p> 
<p> more of a man at once, either in anticipation of the wine, or as a <\p> 
<p> grateful response to my good fellowship in offering it. <\p> 

<p> "With pleasure," he replied. <\p> 

<p> The bar-keeper, at my request, showed us into a private room, and soon <\p> 
<p> afterwards set some fried oysters and a bottle of claret on the table; <\p> 
<p> and I saw the old man glance curiously at the label of the bottle, as <\p> 
<p> if to learn the brand. <\p> 

<p> "It should be good wine," I remarked, "if it have any right to its <\p> 
<p> label." <\p> 

<p> "You cannot suppose, sir," said Moodie, with a sigh, "that a poor old <\p> 
<p> fellow like me knows any difference in wines." <\p> 

<p> And yet, in his way of handling the glass, in his preliminary snuff at <\p> 
<p> the aroma, in his first cautious sip of the wine, and the gustatory <\p> 
<p> skill with which he gave his palate the full advantage of it, it was <\p> 
<p> impossible not to recognize the connoisseur. <\p> 

<p> "I fancy, Mr. Moodie," said I, "you are a much better judge of wines <\p> 
<p> than I have yet learned to be.  Tell me fairly,--did you never drink it <\p> 
<p> where the grape grows?" <\p> 

<p> "How should that have been, Mr. Coverdale?" answered old Moodie shyly; <\p> 
<p> but then he took courage, as it were, and uttered a feeble little <\p> 
<p> laugh.  "The flavor of this wine," added he, "and its perfume still <\p> 
<p> more than its taste, makes me remember that I was once a young man." <\p> 

<p> "I wish, Mr. Moodie," suggested I,--not that I greatly cared about it, <\p> 
<p> however, but was only anxious to draw him into some talk about <\p> 
<p> Priscilla and Zenobia,--"I wish, while we sit over our wine, you would <\p> 
<p> favor me with a few of those youthful reminiscences." <\p> 

<p> "Ah," said he, shaking his head, "they might interest you more than you <\p> 
<p> suppose.  But I had better be silent, Mr. Coverdale.  If this good <\p> 
<p> wine,--though claret, I suppose, is not apt to play such a trick,--but <\p> 
<p> if it should make my tongue run too freely, I could never look you in <\p> 
<p> the face again." <\p> 

<p> "You never did look me in the face, Mr. Moodie," I replied, "until this <\p> 
<p> very moment." <\p> 

<p> "Ah!" sighed old Moodie. <\p> 

<p> It was wonderful, however, what an effect the mild grape-juice wrought <\p> 
<p> upon him.  It was not in the wine, but in the associations which it <\p> 
<p> seemed to bring up.  Instead of the mean, slouching, furtive, painfully <\p> 
<p> depressed air of an old city vagabond, more like a gray kennel-rat than <\p> 
<p> any other living thing, he began to take the aspect of a decayed <\p> 
<p> gentleman.  Even his garments--especially after I had myself quaffed a <\p> 
<p> glass or two--looked less shabby than when we first sat down.  There <\p> 
<p> was, by and by, a certain exuberance and elaborateness of gesture and <\p> 
<p> manner, oddly in contrast with all that I had hitherto seen of him. <\p> 
<p> Anon, with hardly any impulse from me, old Moodie began to talk.  His <\p> 
<p> communications referred exclusively to a long-past and more fortunate <\p> 
<p> period of his life, with only a few unavoidable allusions to the <\p> 
<p> circumstances that had reduced him to his present state.  But, having <\p> 
<p> once got the clew, my subsequent researches acquainted me with the main <\p> 
<p> facts of the following narrative; although, in writing it out, my pen <\p> 
<p> has perhaps allowed itself a trifle of romantic and legendary license, <\p> 
<p> worthier of a small poet than of a grave biographer. <\p> 

<p> XXII. FAUNTLEROY <\p> 

<p> Five-and-twenty years ago, at the epoch of this story, there dwelt in <\p> 
<p> one of the Middle States a man whom we shall call Fauntleroy; a man of <\p> 
<p> wealth, and magnificent tastes, and prodigal expenditure.  His home <\p> 
<p> might almost be styled a palace; his habits, in the ordinary sense, <\p> 
<p> princely.  His whole being seemed to have crystallized itself into an <\p> 
<p> external splendor, wherewith he glittered in the eyes of the world, and <\p> 
<p> had no other life than upon this gaudy surface.  He had married a <\p> 
<p> lovely woman, whose nature was deeper than his own.  But his affection <\p> 
<p> for her, though it showed largely, was superficial, like all his other <\p> 
<p> manifestations and developments; he did not so truly keep this noble <\p> 
<p> creature in his heart, as wear her beauty for the most brilliant <\p> 
<p> ornament of his outward state.  And there was born to him a child, a <\p> 
<p> beautiful daughter, whom he took from the beneficent hand of God with <\p> 
<p> no just sense of her immortal value, but as a man already rich in gems <\p> 
<p> would receive another jewel.  If he loved her, it was because she shone. <\p> 

<p> After Fauntleroy had thus spent a few empty years, coruscating <\p> 
<p> continually an unnatural light, the source of it--which was merely his <\p> 
<p> gold--began to grow more shallow, and finally became exhausted. He saw <\p> 
<p> himself in imminent peril of losing all that had heretofore <\p> 
<p> distinguished him; and, conscious of no innate worth to fall back upon, <\p> 
<p> he recoiled from this calamity with the instinct of a soul shrinking <\p> 
<p> from annihilation.  To avoid it,--wretched man!--or rather to defer it, <\p> 
<p> if but for a month, a day, or only to procure himself the life of a few <\p> 
<p> breaths more amid the false glitter which was now less his own than <\p> 
<p> ever,--he made himself guilty of a crime.  It was just the sort of <\p> 
<p> crime, growing out of its artificial state, which society (unless it <\p> 
<p> should change its entire constitution for this man's unworthy sake) <\p> 
<p> neither could nor ought to pardon.  More safely might it pardon murder. <\p> 
<p> Fauntleroy's guilt was discovered.  He fled; his wife perished, by the <\p> 
<p> necessity of her innate nobleness, in its alliance with a being so <\p> 
<p> ignoble; and betwixt her mother's death and her father's ignominy, his <\p> 
<p> daughter was left worse than orphaned. <\p> 

<p> There was no pursuit after Fauntleroy.  His family connections, who had <\p> 
<p> great wealth, made such arrangements with those whom he had attempted <\p> 
<p> to wrong as secured him from the retribution that would have overtaken <\p> 
<p> an unfriended criminal.  The wreck of his estate was divided among his <\p> 
<p> creditors: His name, in a very brief space, was forgotten by the <\p> 
<p> multitude who had passed it so diligently from mouth to mouth.  Seldom, <\p> 
<p> indeed, was it recalled, even by his closest former intimates.  Nor <\p> 
<p> could it have been otherwise.  The man had laid no real touch on any <\p> 
<p> mortal's heart.  Being a mere image, an optical delusion, created by <\p> 
<p> the sunshine of prosperity, it was his law to vanish into the shadow of <\p> 
<p> the first intervening cloud.  He seemed to leave no vacancy; a <\p> 
<p> phenomenon which, like many others that attended his brief career, went <\p> 
<p> far to prove the illusiveness of his existence. <\p> 

<p> Not, however, that the physical substance of Fauntleroy had literally <\p> 
<p> melted into vapor.  He had fled northward to the New England <\p> 
<p> metropolis, and had taken up his abode, under another name, in a <\p> 
<p> squalid street or court of the older portion of the city.  There he <\p> 
<p> dwelt among poverty-stricken wretches, sinners, and forlorn good <\p> 
<p> people, Irish, and whomsoever else were neediest.  Many families were <\p> 
<p> clustered in each house together, above stairs and below, in the little <\p> 
<p> peaked garrets, and even in the dusky cellars.  The house where <\p> 
<p> Fauntleroy paid weekly rent for a chamber and a closet had been a <\p> 
<p> stately habitation in its day.  An old colonial governor had built it, <\p> 
<p> and lived there, long ago, and held his levees in a great room where <\p> 
<p> now slept twenty Irish bedfellows; and died in Fauntleroy's chamber, <\p> 
<p> which his embroidered and white-wigged ghost still haunted. Tattered <\p> 
<p> hangings, a marble hearth, traversed with many cracks and fissures, a <\p> 
<p> richly carved oaken mantelpiece, partly hacked away for kindling-stuff, <\p> 
<p> a stuccoed ceiling, defaced with great, unsightly patches of the naked <\p> 
<p> laths,--such was the chamber's aspect, as if, with its splinters and <\p> 
<p> rags of dirty splendor, it were a kind of practical gibe at this poor, <\p> 
<p> ruined man of show. <\p> 

<p> At first, and at irregular intervals, his relatives allowed Fauntleroy <\p> 
<p> a little pittance to sustain life; not from any love, perhaps, but lest <\p> 
<p> poverty should compel him, by new offences, to add more shame to that <\p> 
<p> with which he had already stained them.  But he showed no tendency to <\p> 
<p> further guilt.  His character appeared to have been radically changed <\p> 
<p> (as, indeed, from its shallowness, it well might) by his miserable <\p> 
<p> fate; or, it may be, the traits now seen in him were portions of the <\p> 
<p> same character, presenting itself in another phase.  Instead of any <\p> 
<p> longer seeking to live in the sight of the world, his impulse was to <\p> 
<p> shrink into the nearest obscurity, and to be unseen of men, were it <\p> 
<p> possible, even while standing before their eyes.  He had no pride; it <\p> 
<p> was all trodden in the dust.  No ostentation; for how could it survive, <\p> 
<p> when there was nothing left of Fauntleroy, save penury and shame!  His <\p> 
<p> very gait demonstrated that he would gladly have faded out of view, and <\p> 
<p> have crept about invisibly, for the sake of sheltering himself from the <\p> 
<p> irksomeness of a human glance.  Hardly, it was averred, within the <\p> 
<p> memory of those who knew him now, had he the hardihood to show his full <\p> 
<p> front to the world.  He skulked in corners, and crept about in a sort <\p> 
<p> of noonday twilight, making himself gray and misty, at all hours, with <\p> 
<p> his morbid intolerance of sunshine. <\p> 

<p> In his torpid despair, however, he had done an act which that condition <\p> 
<p> of the spirit seems to prompt almost as often as prosperity and hope. <\p> 
<p> Fauntleroy was again married.  He had taken to wife a forlorn, <\p> 
<p> meek-spirited, feeble young woman, a seamstress, whom he found dwelling <\p> 
<p> with her mother in a contiguous chamber of the old gubernatorial <\p> 
<p> residence.  This poor phantom--as the beautiful and noble companion of <\p> 
<p> his former life had done brought him a daughter. And sometimes, as from <\p> 
<p> one dream into another, Fauntleroy looked forth out of his present <\p> 
<p> grimy environment into that past magnificence, and wondered whether the <\p> 
<p> grandee of yesterday or the pauper of to-day were real.  But, in my <\p> 
<p> mind, the one and the other were alike impalpable.  In truth, it was <\p> 
<p> Fauntleroy's fatality to behold whatever he touched dissolve.  After a <\p> 
<p> few years, his second wife (dim shadow that she had always been) faded <\p> 
<p> finally out of the world, and left Fauntleroy to deal as he might with <\p> 
<p> their pale and nervous child.  And, by this time, among his distant <\p> 
<p> relatives,--with whom he had grown a weary thought, linked with <\p> 
<p> contagious infamy, and which they were only too willing to get rid <\p> 
<p> of,--he was himself supposed to be no more. <\p> 

<p> The younger child, like his elder one, might be considered as the true <\p> 
<p> offspring of both parents, and as the reflection of their state. She <\p> 
<p> was a tremulous little creature, shrinking involuntarily from all <\p> 
<p> mankind, but in timidity, and no sour repugnance.  There was a lack of <\p> 
<p> human substance in her; it seemed as if, were she to stand up in a <\p> 
<p> sunbeam, it would pass right through her figure, and trace out the <\p> 
<p> cracked and dusty window-panes upon the naked floor.  But, <\p> 
<p> nevertheless, the poor child had a heart; and from her mother's gentle <\p> 
<p> character she had inherited a profound and still capacity of affection. <\p> 
<p> And so her life was one of love.  She bestowed it partly on her father, <\p> 
<p> but in greater part on an idea. <\p> 

<p> For Fauntleroy, as they sat by their cheerless fireside,--which was no <\p> 
<p> fireside, in truth, but only a rusty stove,--had often talked to the <\p> 
<p> little girl about his former wealth, the noble loveliness of his first <\p> 
<p> wife, and the beautiful child whom she had given him.  Instead of the <\p> 
<p> fairy tales which other parents tell, he told Priscilla this. And, out <\p> 
<p> of the loneliness of her sad little existence, Priscilla's love grew, <\p> 
<p> and tended upward, and twined itself perseveringly around this unseen <\p> 
<p> sister; as a grapevine might strive to clamber out of a gloomy hollow <\p> 
<p> among the rocks, and embrace a young tree standing in the sunny warmth <\p> 
<p> above.  It was almost like worship, both in its earnestness and its <\p> 
<p> humility; nor was it the less humble--though the more earnest--because <\p> 
<p> Priscilla could claim human kindred with the being whom she, so <\p> 
<p> devoutly loved.  As with worship, too, it gave her soul the refreshment <\p> 
<p> of a purer atmosphere.  Save for this singular, this melancholy, and <\p> 
<p> yet beautiful affection, the child could hardly have lived; or, had she <\p> 
<p> lived, with a heart shrunken for lack of any sentiment to fill it, she <\p> 
<p> must have yielded to the barren miseries of her position, and have <\p> 
<p> grown to womanhood characterless and worthless. But now, amid all the <\p> 
<p> sombre coarseness of her father's outward life, and of her own, <\p> 
<p> Priscilla had a higher and imaginative life within.  Some faint gleam <\p> 
<p> thereof was often visible upon her face. It was as if, in her spiritual <\p> 
<p> visits to her brilliant sister, a portion of the latter's brightness <\p> 
<p> had permeated our dim Priscilla, and still lingered, shedding a faint <\p> 
<p> illumination through the cheerless chamber, after she came back. <\p> 

<p> As the child grew up, so pallid and so slender, and with much <\p> 
<p> unaccountable nervousness, and all the weaknesses of neglected infancy <\p> 
<p> still haunting her, the gross and simple neighbors whispered strange <\p> 
<p> things about Priscilla.  The big, red, Irish matrons, whose innumerable <\p> 
<p> progeny swarmed out of the adjacent doors, used to mock at the pale <\p> 
<p> Western child.  They fancied--or, at least, affirmed it, between jest <\p> 
<p> and earnest--that she was not so solid flesh and blood as other <\p> 
<p> children, but mixed largely with a thinner element.  They called her <\p> 
<p> ghost-child, and said that she could indeed vanish when she pleased, <\p> 
<p> but could never, in her densest moments, make herself quite visible. <\p> 
<p> The sun at midday would shine through her; in the first gray of the <\p> 
<p> twilight, she lost all the distinctness of her outline; and, if you <\p> 
<p> followed the dim thing into a dark corner, behold! she was not there. <\p> 
<p> And it was true that Priscilla had strange ways; strange ways, and <\p> 
<p> stranger words, when she uttered any words at all.  Never stirring out <\p> 
<p> of the old governor's dusky house, she sometimes talked of distant <\p> 
<p> places and splendid rooms, as if she had just left them.  Hidden things <\p> 
<p> were visible to her (at least so the people inferred from obscure hints <\p> 
<p> escaping unawares out of her mouth), and silence was audible.  And in <\p> 
<p> all the world there was nothing so difficult to be endured, by those <\p> 
<p> who had any dark secret to conceal, as the glance of Priscilla's timid <\p> 
<p> and melancholy eyes. <\p> 

<p> Her peculiarities were the theme of continual gossip among the other <\p> 
<p> inhabitants of the gubernatorial mansion.  The rumor spread thence into <\p> 
<p> a wider circle.  Those who knew old Moodie, as he was now called, used <\p> 
<p> often to jeer him, at the very street-corners, about his daughter's <\p> 
<p> gift of second-sight and prophecy.  It was a period when science <\p> 
<p> (though mostly through its empirical professors) was bringing forward, <\p> 
<p> anew, a hoard of facts and imperfect theories, that had partially won <\p> 
<p> credence in elder times, but which modern scepticism had swept away as <\p> 
<p> rubbish.  These things were now tossed up again, out of the surging <\p> 
<p> ocean of human thought and experience.  The story of Priscilla's <\p> 
<p> preternatural manifestations, therefore, attracted a kind of notice of <\p> 
<p> which it would have been deemed wholly unworthy a few years earlier. <\p> 
<p> One day a gentleman ascended the creaking staircase, and inquired which <\p> 
<p> was old Moodie's chamber door.  And, several times, he came again.  He <\p> 
<p> was a marvellously handsome man,--still youthful, too, and fashionably <\p> 
<p> dressed.  Except that Priscilla, in those days, had no beauty, and, in <\p> 
<p> the languor of her existence, had not yet blossomed into womanhood, <\p> 
<p> there would have been rich food for scandal in these visits; for the <\p> 
<p> girl was unquestionably their sole object, although her father was <\p> 
<p> supposed always to be present.  But, it must likewise be added, there <\p> 
<p> was something about Priscilla that calumny could not meddle with; and <\p> 
<p> thus far was she privileged, either by the preponderance of what was <\p> 
<p> spiritual, or the thin and watery blood that left her cheek so pallid. <\p> 

<p> Yet, if the busy tongues of the neighborhood spared Priscilla in one <\p> 
<p> way, they made themselves amends by renewed and wilder babble on <\p> 
<p> another score.  They averred that the strange gentleman was a wizard, <\p> 
<p> and that he had taken advantage of Priscilla's lack of earthly <\p> 
<p> substance to subject her to himself, as his familiar spirit, through <\p> 
<p> whose medium he gained cognizance of whatever happened, in regions near <\p> 
<p> or remote.  The boundaries of his power were defined by the verge of <\p> 
<p> the pit of Tartarus on the one hand, and the third sphere of the <\p> 
<p> celestial world on the other.  Again, they declared their suspicion <\p> 
<p> that the wizard, with all his show of manly beauty, was really an aged <\p> 
<p> and wizened figure, or else that his semblance of a human body was only <\p> 
<p> a necromantic, or perhaps a mechanical contrivance, in which a demon <\p> 
<p> walked about.  In proof of it, however, they could merely instance a <\p> 
<p> gold band around his upper teeth, which had once been visible to <\p> 
<p> several old women, when he smiled at them from the top of the <\p> 
<p> governor's staircase.  Of course this was all absurdity, or mostly so. <\p> 
<p> But, after every possible deduction, there remained certain very <\p> 
<p> mysterious points about the stranger's character, as well as the <\p> 
<p> connection that he established with Priscilla.  Its nature at that <\p> 
<p> period was even less understood than now, when miracles of this kind <\p> 
<p> have grown so absolutely stale, that I would gladly, if the truth <\p> 
<p> allowed, dismiss the whole matter from my narrative. <\p> 

<p> We must now glance backward, in quest of the beautiful daughter of <\p> 
<p> Fauntleroy's prosperity.  What had become of her?  Fauntleroy's only <\p> 
<p> brother, a bachelor, and with no other relative so near, had adopted <\p> 
<p> the forsaken child.  She grew up in affluence, with native graces <\p> 
<p> clustering luxuriantly about her.  In her triumphant progress towards <\p> 
<p> womanhood, she was adorned with every variety of feminine <\p> 
<p> accomplishment.  But she lacked a mother's care.  With no adequate <\p> 
<p> control, on any hand (for a man, however stern, however wise, can never <\p> 
<p> sway and guide a female child), her character was left to shape itself. <\p> 
<p> There was good in it, and evil.  Passionate, self-willed, and <\p> 
<p> imperious, she had a warm and generous nature; showing the richness of <\p> 
<p> the soil, however, chiefly by the weeds that flourished in it, and <\p> 
<p> choked up the herbs of grace.  In her girlhood her uncle died.  As <\p> 
<p> Fauntleroy was supposed to be likewise dead, and no other heir was <\p> 
<p> known to exist, his wealth devolved on her, although, dying suddenly, <\p> 
<p> the uncle left no will.  After his death there were obscure passages in <\p> 
<p> Zenobia's history.  There were whispers of an attachment, and even a <\p> 
<p> secret marriage, with a fascinating and accomplished but unprincipled <\p> 
<p> young man.  The incidents and appearances, however, which led to this <\p> 
<p> surmise soon passed away, and were forgotten. <\p> 

<p> Nor was her reputation seriously affected by the report.  In fact, so <\p> 
<p> great was her native power and influence, and such seemed the careless <\p> 
<p> purity of her nature, that whatever Zenobia did was generally <\p> 
<p> acknowledged as right for her to do.  The world never criticised her so <\p> 
<p> harshly as it does most women who transcend its rules.  It almost <\p> 
<p> yielded its assent, when it beheld her stepping out of the common path, <\p> 
<p> and asserting the more extensive privileges of her sex, both <\p> 
<p> theoretically and by her practice.  The sphere of ordinary womanhood <\p> 
<p> was felt to be narrower than her development required. <\p> 

<p> A portion of Zenobia's more recent life is told in the foregoing pages. <\p> 
<p> Partly in earnest,--and, I imagine, as was her disposition, half in a <\p> 
<p> proud jest, or in a kind of recklessness that had grown upon her, out <\p> 
<p> of some hidden grief,--she had given her countenance, and promised <\p> 
<p> liberal pecuniary aid, to our experiment of a better social state.  And <\p> 
<p> Priscilla followed her to Blithedale.  The sole bliss of her life had <\p> 
<p> been a dream of this beautiful sister, who had never so much as known <\p> 
<p> of her existence.  By this time, too, the poor girl was enthralled in <\p> 
<p> an intolerable bondage, from which she must either free herself or <\p> 
<p> perish.  She deemed herself safest near Zenobia, into whose large heart <\p> 
<p> she hoped to nestle. <\p> 

<p> One evening, months after Priscilla's departure, when Moodie (or shall <\p> 
<p> we call him Fauntleroy?) was sitting alone in the state-chamber of the <\p> 
<p> old governor, there came footsteps up the staircase.  There was a pause <\p> 
<p> on the landing-place.  A lady's musical yet haughty accents were heard <\p> 
<p> making an inquiry from some denizen of the house, who had thrust a head <\p> 
<p> out of a contiguous chamber.  There was then a knock at Moodie's door. <\p> 
<p> "Come in!" said he. <\p> 

<p> And Zenobia entered.  The details of the interview that followed being <\p> 
<p> unknown to me,--while, notwithstanding, it would be a pity quite to <\p> 
<p> lose the picturesqueness of the situation,--I shall attempt to sketch <\p> 
<p> it, mainly from fancy, although with some general grounds of surmise in <\p> 
<p> regard to the old man's feelings. <\p> 

<p> She gazed wonderingly at the dismal chamber.  Dismal to her, who beheld <\p> 
<p> it only for an instant; and how much more so to him, into whose brain <\p> 
<p> each bare spot on the ceiling, every tatter of the paper-hangings, and <\p> 
<p> all the splintered carvings of the mantelpiece, seen wearily through <\p> 
<p> long years, had worn their several prints! Inexpressibly miserable is <\p> 
<p> this familiarity with objects that have been from the first disgustful. <\p> 

<p> "I have received a strange message," said Zenobia, after a moment's <\p> 
<p> silence, "requesting, or rather enjoining it upon me, to come hither. <\p> 
<p> Rather from curiosity than any other motive,--and because, though a <\p> 
<p> woman, I have not all the timidity of one,--I have complied.  Can it be <\p> 
<p> you, sir, who thus summoned me?" <\p> 

<p> "It was," answered Moodie. <\p> 

<p> "And what was your purpose?" she continued.  "You require charity, <\p> 
<p> perhaps?  In that case, the message might have been more fitly worded. <\p> 
<p> But you are old and poor, and age and poverty should be allowed their <\p> 
<p> privileges.  Tell me, therefore, to what extent you need my aid." <\p> 

<p> "Put up your purse," said the supposed mendicant, with an inexplicable <\p> 
<p> smile.  "Keep it,--keep all your wealth,--until I demand it all, or <\p> 
<p> none!  My message had no such end in view.  You are beautiful, they <\p> 
<p> tell me; and I desired to look at you." <\p> 

<p> He took the one lamp that showed the discomfort and sordidness of his <\p> 
<p> abode, and approaching Zenobia held it up, so as to gain the more <\p> 
<p> perfect view of her, from top to toe.  So obscure was the chamber, that <\p> 
<p> you could see the reflection of her diamonds thrown upon the dingy <\p> 
<p> wall, and flickering with the rise and fall of Zenobia's breath. It was <\p> 
<p> the splendor of those jewels on her neck, like lamps that burn before <\p> 
<p> some fair temple, and the jewelled flower in her hair, more than the <\p> 
<p> murky, yellow light, that helped him to see her beauty. But he beheld <\p> 
<p> it, and grew proud at heart; his own figure, in spite of his mean <\p> 
<p> habiliments, assumed an air of state and grandeur. <\p> 

<p> "It is well," cried old Moodie.  "Keep your wealth.  You are right <\p> 
<p> worthy of it.  Keep it, therefore, but with one condition only." <\p> 

<p> Zenobia thought the old man beside himself, and was moved with pity. <\p> 

<p> "Have you none to care for you?" asked she.  "No daughter?--no <\p> 
<p> kind-hearted neighbor?--no means of procuring the attendance which you <\p> 
<p> need?  Tell me once again, can I do nothing for you?" <\p> 

<p> "Nothing," he replied.  "I have beheld what I wished.  Now leave me. <\p> 
<p> Linger not a moment longer, or I may be tempted to say what would bring <\p> 
<p> a cloud over that queenly brow.  Keep all your wealth, but with only <\p> 
<p> this one condition: Be kind--be no less kind than sisters are--to my <\p> 
<p> poor Priscilla!" <\p> 

<p> And, it may be, after Zenobia withdrew, Fauntleroy paced his gloomy <\p> 
<p> chamber, and communed with himself as follows,--or, at all events, it <\p> 
<p> is the only solution which I can offer of the enigma presented in his <\p> 
<p> character:--"I am unchanged,--the same man as of yore!" said he. "True, <\p> 
<p> my brother's wealth--he dying intestate--is legally my own.  I know it; <\p> 
<p> yet of my own choice, I live a beggar, and go meanly clad, and hide <\p> 
<p> myself behind a forgotten ignominy.  Looks this like ostentation?  Ah! <\p> 
<p> but in Zenobia I live again!  Beholding her, so beautiful,--so fit to <\p> 
<p> be adorned with all imaginable splendor of outward state,--the cursed <\p> 
<p> vanity, which, half a lifetime since, dropt off like tatters of once <\p> 
<p> gaudy apparel from my debased and ruined person, is all renewed for her <\p> 
<p> sake.  Were I to reappear, my shame would go with me from darkness into <\p> 
<p> daylight.  Zenobia has the splendor, and not the shame.  Let the world <\p> 
<p> admire her, and be dazzled by her, the brilliant child of my <\p> 
<p> prosperity!  It is Fauntleroy that still shines through her!"  But <\p> 
<p> then, perhaps, another thought occurred to him. <\p> 

<p> "My poor Priscilla!  And am I just to her, in surrendering all to this <\p> 
<p> beautiful Zenobia?  Priscilla!  I love her best,--I love her only!--but <\p> 
<p> with shame, not pride.  So dim, so pallid, so shrinking,--the daughter <\p> 
<p> of my long calamity!  Wealth were but a mockery in Priscilla's hands. <\p> 
<p> What is its use, except to fling a golden radiance around those who <\p> 
<p> grasp it?  Yet let Zenobia take heed! Priscilla shall have no wrong!" <\p> 
<p> But, while the man of show thus meditated,--that very evening, so far <\p> 
<p> as I can adjust the dates of these strange incidents,--Priscilla poor, <\p> 
<p> pallid flower!--was either snatched from Zenobia's hand, or flung <\p> 
<p> wilfully away! <\p> 

<p> XXIII. A VILLAGE HALL <\p> 

<p> Well, I betook myself away, and wandered up and down, like an exorcised <\p> 
<p> spirit that had been driven from its old haunts after a mighty <\p> 
<p> struggle.  It takes down the solitary pride of man, beyond most other <\p> 
<p> things, to find the impracticability of flinging aside affections that <\p> 
<p> have grown irksome.  The bands that were silken once are apt to become <\p> 
<p> iron fetters when we desire to shake them off.  Our souls, after all, <\p> 
<p> are not our own.  We convey a property in them to those with whom we <\p> 
<p> associate; but to what extent can never be known, until we feel the <\p> 
<p> tug, the agony, of our abortive effort to resume an exclusive sway over <\p> 
<p> ourselves.  Thus, in all the weeks of my absence, my thoughts <\p> 
<p> continually reverted back, brooding over the bygone months, and <\p> 
<p> bringing up incidents that seemed hardly to have left a trace of <\p> 
<p> themselves in their passage.  I spent painful hours in recalling these <\p> 
<p> trifles, and rendering them more misty and unsubstantial than at first <\p> 
<p> by the quantity of speculative musing thus kneaded in with them. <\p> 
<p> Hollingsworth, Zenobia, Priscilla!  These three had absorbed my life <\p> 
<p> into themselves.  Together with an inexpressible longing to know their <\p> 
<p> fortunes, there was likewise a morbid resentment of my own pain, and a <\p> 
<p> stubborn reluctance to come again within their sphere. <\p> 

<p> All that I learned of them, therefore, was comprised in a few brief and <\p> 
<p> pungent squibs, such as the newspapers were then in the habit of <\p> 
<p> bestowing on our socialist enterprise.  There was one paragraph, which <\p> 
<p> if I rightly guessed its purport bore reference to Zenobia, but was too <\p> 
<p> darkly hinted to convey even thus much of certainty. Hollingsworth, <\p> 
<p> too, with his philanthropic project, afforded the penny-a-liners a <\p> 
<p> theme for some savage and bloody minded jokes; and, considerably to my <\p> 
<p> surprise, they affected me with as much indignation as if we had still <\p> 
<p> been friends. <\p> 

<p> Thus passed several weeks; time long enough for my brown and <\p> 
<p> toil-hardened hands to reaccustom themselves to gloves.  Old habits, <\p> 
<p> such as were merely external, returned upon me with wonderful <\p> 
<p> promptitude.  My superficial talk, too, assumed altogether a worldly <\p> 
<p> tone.  Meeting former acquaintances, who showed themselves inclined to <\p> 
<p> ridicule my heroic devotion to the cause of human welfare, I spoke of <\p> 
<p> the recent phase of my life as indeed fair matter for a jest.  But, I <\p> 
<p> also gave them to understand that it was, at most, only an experiment, <\p> 
<p> on which I had staked no valuable amount of hope or fear. It had <\p> 
<p> enabled me to pass the summer in a novel and agreeable way, had <\p> 
<p> afforded me some grotesque specimens of artificial simplicity, and <\p> 
<p> could not, therefore, so far as I was concerned, be reckoned a failure. <\p> 
<p> In no one instance, however, did I voluntarily speak of my three <\p> 
<p> friends.  They dwelt in a profounder region.  The more I consider <\p> 
<p> myself as I then was, the more do I recognize how deeply my connection <\p> 
<p> with those three had affected all my being. <\p> 

<p> As it was already the epoch of annihilated space, I might in the time I <\p> 
<p> was away from Blithedale have snatched a glimpse at England, and been <\p> 
<p> back again.  But my wanderings were confined within a very limited <\p> 
<p> sphere.  I hopped and fluttered, like a bird with a string about its <\p> 
<p> leg, gyrating round a small circumference, and keeping up a restless <\p> 
<p> activity to no purpose.  Thus it was still in our familiar <\p> 
<p> Massachusetts--in one of its white country villages--that I must next <\p> 
<p> particularize an incident. <\p> 

<p> The scene was one of those lyceum halls, of which almost every village <\p> 
<p> has now its own, dedicated to that sober and pallid, or rather <\p> 
<p> drab-colored, mode of winter-evening entertainment, the lecture.  Of <\p> 
<p> late years this has come strangely into vogue, when the natural <\p> 
<p> tendency of things would seem to be to substitute lettered for oral <\p> 
<p> methods of addressing the public.  But, in halls like this, besides the <\p> 
<p> winter course of lectures, there is a rich and varied series of other <\p> 
<p> exhibitions.  Hither comes the ventriloquist, with all his mysterious <\p> 
<p> tongues; the thaumaturgist, too, with his miraculous transformations of <\p> 
<p> plates, doves, and rings, his pancakes smoking in your hat, and his <\p> 
<p> cellar of choice liquors represented in one small bottle.  Here, also, <\p> 
<p> the itinerant professor instructs separate classes of ladies and <\p> 
<p> gentlemen in physiology, and demonstrates his lessons by the aid of <\p> 
<p> real skeletons, and manikins in wax, from Paris.  Here is to be heard <\p> 
<p> the choir of Ethiopian melodists, and to be seen the diorama of Moscow <\p> 
<p> or Bunker Hill, or the moving panorama of the Chinese wall.  Here is <\p> 
<p> displayed the museum of wax figures, illustrating the wide catholicism <\p> 
<p> of earthly renown, by mixing up heroes and statesmen, the pope and the <\p> 
<p> Mormon prophet, kings, queens, murderers, and beautiful ladies; every <\p> 
<p> sort of person, in short, except authors, of whom I never beheld even <\p> 
<p> the most famous done in wax.  And here, in this many-purposed hall <\p> 
<p> (unless the selectmen of the village chance to have more than their <\p> 
<p> share of the Puritanism, which, however diversified with later <\p> 
<p> patchwork, still gives its prevailing tint to New England <\p> 
<p> character),--here the company of strolling players sets up its little <\p> 
<p> stage, and claims patronage for the legitimate drama. <\p> 

<p> But, on the autumnal evening which I speak of, a number of printed <\p> 
<p> handbills--stuck up in the bar-room, and on the sign-post of the hotel, <\p> 
<p> and on the meeting-house porch, and distributed largely through the <\p> 
<p> village--had promised the inhabitants an interview with that celebrated <\p> 
<p> and hitherto inexplicable phenomenon, the Veiled Lady! <\p> 

<p> The hall was fitted up with an amphitheatrical descent of seats towards <\p> 
<p> a platform, on which stood a desk, two lights, a stool, and a capacious <\p> 
<p> antique chair.  The audience was of a generally decent and respectable <\p> 
<p> character: old farmers, in their Sunday black coats, with shrewd, hard, <\p> 
<p> sun-dried faces, and a cynical humor, oftener than any other <\p> 
<p> expression, in their eyes; pretty girls, in many-colored attire; pretty <\p> 
<p> young men,--the schoolmaster, the lawyer, or student at law, the <\p> 
<p> shop-keeper,--all looking rather suburban than rural.  In these days, <\p> 
<p> there is absolutely no rusticity, except when the actual labor of the <\p> 
<p> soil leaves its earth-mould on the person.  There was likewise a <\p> 
<p> considerable proportion of young and middle-aged women, many of them <\p> 
<p> stern in feature, with marked foreheads, and a very definite line of <\p> 
<p> eyebrow; a type of womanhood in which a bold intellectual development <\p> 
<p> seems to be keeping pace with the progressive delicacy of the physical <\p> 
<p> constitution.  Of all these people I took note, at first, according to <\p> 
<p> my custom.  But I ceased to do so the moment that my eyes fell on an <\p> 
<p> individual who sat two or three seats below me, immovable, apparently <\p> 
<p> deep in thought, with his back, of course, towards me, and his face <\p> 
<p> turned steadfastly upon the platform. <\p> 

<p> After sitting awhile in contemplation of this person's familiar <\p> 
<p> contour, I was irresistibly moved to step over the intervening benches, <\p> 
<p> lay my hand on his shoulder, put my mouth close to his ear, and address <\p> 
<p> him in a sepulchral, melodramatic whisper: "Hollingsworth! where have <\p> 
<p> you left Zenobia?" <\p> 

<p> His nerves, however, were proof against my attack.  He turned half <\p> 
<p> around, and looked me in the face with great sad eyes, in which there <\p> 
<p> was neither kindness nor resentment, nor any perceptible surprise. <\p> 

<p> "Zenobia, when I last saw her," he answered, "was at Blithedale." <\p> 

<p> He said no more.  But there was a great deal of talk going on near me, <\p> 
<p> among a knot of people who might be considered as representing the <\p> 
<p> mysticism, or rather the mystic sensuality, of this singular age. The <\p> 
<p> nature of the exhibition that was about to take place had probably <\p> 
<p> given the turn to their conversation. <\p> 

<p> I heard, from a pale man in blue spectacles, some stranger stories than <\p> 
<p> ever were written in a romance; told, too, with a simple, unimaginative <\p> 
<p> steadfastness, which was terribly efficacious in compelling the auditor <\p> 
<p> to receive them into the category of established facts.  He cited <\p> 
<p> instances of the miraculous power of one human being over the will and <\p> 
<p> passions of another; insomuch that settled grief was but a shadow <\p> 
<p> beneath the influence of a man possessing this potency, and the strong <\p> 
<p> love of years melted away like a vapor.  At the bidding of one of these <\p> 
<p> wizards, the maiden, with her lover's kiss still burning on her lips, <\p> 
<p> would turn from him with icy indifference; the newly made widow would <\p> 
<p> dig up her buried heart out of her young husband's grave before the <\p> 
<p> sods had taken root upon it; a mother with her babe's milk in her bosom <\p> 
<p> would thrust away her child.  Human character was but soft wax in his <\p> 
<p> hands; and guilt, or virtue, only the forms into which he should see <\p> 
<p> fit to mould it. The religious sentiment was a flame which he could <\p> 
<p> blow up with his breath, or a spark that he could utterly extinguish. <\p> 
<p> It is unutterable, the horror and disgust with which I listened, and <\p> 
<p> saw that, if these things were to be believed, the individual soul was <\p> 
<p> virtually annihilated, and all that is sweet and pure in our present <\p> 
<p> life debased, and that the idea of man's eternal responsibility was <\p> 
<p> made ridiculous, and immortality rendered at once impossible, and not <\p> 
<p> worth acceptance.  But I would have perished on the spot sooner than <\p> 
<p> believe it. <\p> 

<p> The epoch of rapping spirits, and all the wonders that have followed in <\p> 
<p> their train,--such as tables upset by invisible agencies, bells <\p> 
<p> self-tolled at funerals, and ghostly music performed on <\p> 
<p> jew's-harps,--had not yet arrived.  Alas, my countrymen, methinks we <\p> 
<p> have fallen on an evil age!  If these phenomena have not humbug at the <\p> 
<p> bottom, so much the worse for us.  What can they indicate, in a <\p> 
<p> spiritual way, except that the soul of man is descending to a lower <\p> 
<p> point than it has ever before reached while incarnate?  We are pursuing <\p> 
<p> a downward course in the eternal march, and thus bring ourselves into <\p> 
<p> the same range with beings whom death, in requital of their gross and <\p> 
<p> evil lives, has degraded below humanity!  To hold intercourse with <\p> 
<p> spirits of this order, we must stoop and grovel in some element more <\p> 
<p> vile than earthly dust.  These goblins, if they exist at all, are but <\p> 
<p> the shadows of past mortality, outcasts, mere refuse stuff, adjudged <\p> 
<p> unworthy of the eternal world, and, on the most favorable supposition, <\p> 
<p> dwindling gradually into nothingness.  The less we have to say to them <\p> 
<p> the better, lest we share their fate! <\p> 

<p> The audience now began to be impatient; they signified their desire for <\p> 
<p> the entertainment to commence by thump of sticks and stamp of <\p> 
<p> boot-heels.  Nor was it a great while longer before, in response to <\p> 
<p> their call, there appeared a bearded personage in Oriental robes, <\p> 
<p> looking like one of the enchanters of the Arabian Nights.  He came upon <\p> 
<p> the platform from a side door, saluted the spectators, not with a <\p> 
<p> salaam, but a bow, took his station at the desk, and first blowing his <\p> 
<p> nose with a white handkerchief, prepared to speak.  The environment of <\p> 
<p> the homely village hall, and the absence of many ingenious contrivances <\p> 
<p> of stage effect with which the exhibition had heretofore been set off, <\p> 
<p> seemed to bring the artifice of this character more openly upon the <\p> 
<p> surface.  No sooner did I behold the bearded enchanter, than, laying my <\p> 
<p> hand again on Hollingsworth's shoulder, I whispered in his ear, "Do you <\p> 
<p> know him?" <\p> 

<p> "I never saw the man before," he muttered, without turning his head. <\p> 

<p> But I had seen him three times already. <\p> 

<p> Once, on occasion of my first visit to the Veiled Lady; a second time, <\p> 
<p> in the wood-path at Blithedale; and lastly, in Zenobia's drawing-room. <\p> 
<p> It was Westervelt.  A quick association of ideas made me shudder from <\p> 
<p> head to foot; and again, like an evil spirit, bringing up reminiscences <\p> 
<p> of a man's sins, I whispered a question in Hollingsworth's ear,--"What <\p> 
<p> have you done with Priscilla?" <\p> 

<p> He gave a convulsive start, as if I had thrust a knife into him, <\p> 
<p> writhed himself round on his seat, glared fiercely into my eyes, but <\p> 
<p> answered not a word. <\p> 

<p> The Professor began his discourse, explanatory of the psychological <\p> 
<p> phenomena, as he termed them, which it was his purpose to exhibit to <\p> 
<p> the spectators.  There remains no very distinct impression of it on my <\p> 
<p> memory.  It was eloquent, ingenious, plausible, with a delusive show of <\p> 
<p> spirituality, yet really imbued throughout with a cold and dead <\p> 
<p> materialism.  I shivered, as at a current of chill air issuing out of a <\p> 
<p> sepulchral vault, and bringing the smell of corruption along with it. <\p> 
<p> He spoke of a new era that was dawning upon the world; an era that <\p> 
<p> would link soul to soul, and the present life to what we call futurity, <\p> 
<p> with a closeness that should finally convert both worlds into one <\p> 
<p> great, mutually conscious brotherhood.  He described (in a strange, <\p> 
<p> philosophical guise, with terms of art, as if it were a matter of <\p> 
<p> chemical discovery) the agency by which this mighty result was to be <\p> 
<p> effected; nor would it have surprised me, had he pretended to hold up a <\p> 
<p> portion of his universally pervasive fluid, as he affirmed it to be, in <\p> 
<p> a glass phial. <\p> 

<p> At the close of his exordium, the Professor beckoned with his <\p> 
<p> hand,--once, twice, thrice,--and a figure came gliding upon the <\p> 
<p> platform, enveloped in a long veil of silvery whiteness.  It fell about <\p> 
<p> her like the texture of a summer cloud, with a kind of vagueness, so <\p> 
<p> that the outline of the form beneath it could not be accurately <\p> 
<p> discerned. But the movement of the Veiled Lady was graceful, free, and <\p> 
<p> unembarrassed, like that of a person accustomed to be the spectacle of <\p> 
<p> thousands; or, possibly, a blindfold prisoner within the sphere with <\p> 
<p> which this dark earthly magician had surrounded her, she was wholly <\p> 
<p> unconscious of being the central object to all those straining eyes. <\p> 

<p> Pliant to his gesture (which had even an obsequious courtesy, but at <\p> 
<p> the same time a remarkable decisiveness), the figure placed itself in <\p> 
<p> the great chair.  Sitting there, in such visible obscurity, it was, <\p> 
<p> perhaps, as much like the actual presence of a disembodied spirit as <\p> 
<p> anything that stage trickery could devise.  The hushed breathing of the <\p> 
<p> spectators proved how high-wrought were their anticipations of the <\p> 
<p> wonders to be performed through the medium of this incomprehensible <\p> 
<p> creature.  I, too, was in breathless suspense, but with a far different <\p> 
<p> presentiment of some strange event at hand. <\p> 

<p> "You see before you the Veiled Lady," said the bearded Professor, <\p> 
<p> advancing to the verge of the platform.  "By the agency of which I have <\p> 
<p> just spoken, she is at this moment in communion with the spiritual <\p> 
<p> world.  That silvery veil is, in one sense, an enchantment, having been <\p> 
<p> dipped, as it were, and essentially imbued, through the potency of my <\p> 
<p> art, with the fluid medium of spirits.  Slight and ethereal as it <\p> 
<p> seems, the limitations of time and space have no existence within its <\p> 
<p> folds.  This hall--these hundreds of faces, encompassing her within so <\p> 
<p> narrow an amphitheatre--are of thinner substance, in her view, than the <\p> 
<p> airiest vapor that the clouds are made of.  She beholds the Absolute!" <\p> 

<p> As preliminary to other and far more wonderful psychological <\p> 
<p> experiments, the exhibitor suggested that some of his auditors should <\p> 
<p> endeavor to make the Veiled Lady sensible of their presence by such <\p> 
<p> methods--provided only no touch were laid upon her person--as they <\p> 
<p> might deem best adapted to that end.  Accordingly, several deep-lunged <\p> 
<p> country fellows, who looked as if they might have blown the apparition <\p> 
<p> away with a breath, ascended the platform.  Mutually encouraging one <\p> 
<p> another, they shouted so close to her ear that the veil stirred like a <\p> 
<p> wreath of vanishing mist; they smote upon the floor with bludgeons; <\p> 
<p> they perpetrated so hideous a clamor, that methought it might have <\p> 
<p> reached, at least, a little way into the eternal sphere.  Finally, with <\p> 
<p> the assent of the Professor, they laid hold of the great chair, and <\p> 
<p> were startled, apparently, to find it soar upward, as if lighter than <\p> 
<p> the air through which it rose.  But the Veiled Lady remained seated and <\p> 
<p> motionless, with a composure that was hardly less than awful, because <\p> 
<p> implying so immeasurable a distance betwixt her and these rude <\p> 
<p> persecutors. <\p> 

<p> "These efforts are wholly without avail," observed the Professor, who <\p> 
<p> had been looking on with an aspect of serene indifference.  "The roar <\p> 
<p> of a battery of cannon would be inaudible to the Veiled Lady.  And yet, <\p> 
<p> were I to will it, sitting in this very hall, she could hear the desert <\p> 
<p> wind sweeping over the sands as far off as Arabia; the icebergs <\p> 
<p> grinding one against the other in the polar seas; the rustle of a leaf <\p> 
<p> in an East Indian forest; the lowest whispered breath of the <\p> 
<p> bashfullest maiden in the world, uttering the first confession of her <\p> 
<p> love.  Nor does there exist the moral inducement, apart from my own <\p> 
<p> behest, that could persuade her to lift the silvery veil, or arise out <\p> 
<p> of that chair." <\p> 

<p> Greatly to the Professor's discomposure, however, just as he spoke <\p> 
<p> these words, the Veiled Lady arose.  There was a mysterious tremor that <\p> 
<p> shook the magic veil.  The spectators, it may be, imagined that she was <\p> 
<p> about to take flight into that invisible sphere, and to the society of <\p> 
<p> those purely spiritual beings with whom they reckoned her so near akin. <\p> 
<p> Hollingsworth, a moment ago, had mounted the platform, and now stood <\p> 
<p> gazing at the figure, with a sad intentness that brought the whole <\p> 
<p> power of his great, stern, yet tender soul into his glance. <\p> 

<p> "Come," said he, waving his hand towards her.  "You are safe!" <\p> 

<p> She threw off the veil, and stood before that multitude of people pale, <\p> 
<p> tremulous, shrinking, as if only then had she discovered that a <\p> 
<p> thousand eyes were gazing at her.  Poor maiden!  How strangely had she <\p> 
<p> been betrayed!  Blazoned abroad as a wonder of the world, and <\p> 
<p> performing what were adjudged as miracles,--in the faith of many, a <\p> 
<p> seeress and a prophetess; in the harsher judgment of others, a <\p> 
<p> mountebank,--she had kept, as I religiously believe, her virgin reserve <\p> 
<p> and sanctity of soul throughout it all.  Within that encircling veil, <\p> 
<p> though an evil hand had flung it over her, there was as deep a <\p> 
<p> seclusion as if this forsaken girl had, all the while, been sitting <\p> 
<p> under the shadow of Eliot's pulpit, in the Blithedale woods, at the <\p> 
<p> feet of him who now summoned her to the shelter of his arms. And the <\p> 
<p> true heart-throb of a woman's affection was too powerful for the <\p> 
<p> jugglery that had hitherto environed her.  She uttered a shriek, and <\p> 
<p> fled to Hollingsworth, like one escaping from her deadliest enemy, and <\p> 
<p> was safe forever. <\p> 

<p> XXIV. THE MASQUERADERS <\p> 

<p> Two nights had passed since the foregoing occurrences, when, in a <\p> 
<p> breezy September forenoon, I set forth from town, on foot, towards <\p> 
<p> Blithedale.  It was the most delightful of all days for a walk, with a <\p> 
<p> dash of invigorating ice-temper in the air, but a coolness that soon <\p> 
<p> gave place to the brisk glow of exercise, while the vigor remained as <\p> 
<p> elastic as before.  The atmosphere had a spirit and sparkle in it. <\p> 
<p> Each breath was like a sip of ethereal wine, tempered, as I said, with <\p> 
<p> a crystal lump of ice.  I had started on this expedition in an <\p> 
<p> exceedingly sombre mood, as well befitted one who found himself tending <\p> 
<p> towards home, but was conscious that nobody would be quite overjoyed to <\p> 
<p> greet him there.  My feet were hardly off the pavement, however, when <\p> 
<p> this morbid sensation began to yield to the lively influences of air <\p> 
<p> and motion.  Nor had I gone far, with fields yet green on either side, <\p> 
<p> before my step became as swift and light as if Hollingsworth were <\p> 
<p> waiting to exchange a friendly hand-grip, and Zenobia's and Priscilla's <\p> 
<p> open arms would welcome the wanderer's reappearance.  It has happened <\p> 
<p> to me on other occasions, as well as this, to prove how a state of <\p> 
<p> physical well-being can create a kind of joy, in spite of the <\p> 
<p> profoundest anxiety of mind. <\p> 

<p> The pathway of that walk still runs along, with sunny freshness, <\p> 
<p> through my memory.  I know not why it should be so.  But my mental eye <\p> 
<p> can even now discern the September grass, bordering the pleasant <\p> 
<p> roadside with a brighter verdure than while the summer heats were <\p> 
<p> scorching it; the trees, too, mostly green, although here and there a <\p> 
<p> branch or shrub has donned its vesture of crimson and gold a week or <\p> 
<p> two before its fellows.  I see the tufted barberry-bushes, with their <\p> 
<p> small clusters of scarlet fruit; the toadstools, likewise,--some <\p> 
<p> spotlessly white, others yellow or red,--mysterious growths, springing <\p> 
<p> suddenly from no root or seed, and growing nobody can tell how or <\p> 
<p> wherefore.  In this respect they resembled many of the emotions in my <\p> 
<p> breast.  And I still see the little rivulets, chill, clear, and bright, <\p> 
<p> that murmured beneath the road, through subterranean rocks, and <\p> 
<p> deepened into mossy pools, where tiny fish were darting to and fro, and <\p> 
<p> within which lurked the hermit frog. But no,--I never can account for <\p> 
<p> it, that, with a yearning interest to learn the upshot of all my story, <\p> 
<p> and returning to Blithedale for that sole purpose, I should examine <\p> 
<p> these things so like a peaceful-bosomed naturalist.  Nor why, amid all <\p> 
<p> my sympathies and fears, there shot, at times, a wild exhilaration <\p> 
<p> through my frame. <\p> 

<p> Thus I pursued my way along the line of the ancient stone wall that <\p> 
<p> Paul Dudley built, and through white villages, and past orchards of <\p> 
<p> ruddy apples, and fields of ripening maize, and patches of woodland, <\p> 
<p> and all such sweet rural scenery as looks the fairest, a little beyond <\p> 
<p> the suburbs of a town.  Hollingsworth, Zenobia, Priscilla! They glided <\p> 
<p> mistily before me, as I walked.  Sometimes, in my solitude, I laughed <\p> 
<p> with the bitterness of self-scorn, remembering how unreservedly I had <\p> 
<p> given up my heart and soul to interests that were not mine.  What had I <\p> 
<p> ever had to do with them?  And why, being now free, should I take this <\p> 
<p> thraldom on me once again?  It was both sad and dangerous, I whispered <\p> 
<p> to myself, to be in too close affinity with the passions, the errors, <\p> 
<p> and the misfortunes of individuals who stood within a circle of their <\p> 
<p> own, into which, if I stept at all, it must be as an intruder, and at a <\p> 
<p> peril that I could not estimate. <\p> 

<p> Drawing nearer to Blithedale, a sickness of the spirits kept <\p> 
<p> alternating with my flights of causeless buoyancy.  I indulged in a <\p> 
<p> hundred odd and extravagant conjectures.  Either there was no such <\p> 
<p> place as Blithedale, nor ever had been, nor any brotherhood of <\p> 
<p> thoughtful laborers, like what I seemed to recollect there, or else it <\p> 
<p> was all changed during my absence.  It had been nothing but dream work <\p> 
<p> and enchantment.  I should seek in vain for the old farmhouse, and for <\p> 
<p> the greensward, the potato-fields, the root-crops, and acres of Indian <\p> 
<p> corn, and for all that configuration of the land which I had imagined. <\p> 
<p> It would be another spot, and an utter strangeness. <\p> 

<p> These vagaries were of the spectral throng so apt to steal out of an <\p> 
<p> unquiet heart.  They partly ceased to haunt me, on my arriving at a <\p> 
<p> point whence, through the trees, I began to catch glimpses of the <\p> 
<p> Blithedale farm.  That surely was something real.  There was hardly a <\p> 
<p> square foot of all those acres on which I had not trodden heavily, in <\p> 
<p> one or another kind of toil.  The curse of Adam's posterity--and, curse <\p> 
<p> or blessing be it, it gives substance to the life around us--had first <\p> 
<p> come upon me there.  In the sweat of my brow I had there earned bread <\p> 
<p> and eaten it, and so established my claim to be on earth, and my <\p> 
<p> fellowship with all the sons of labor.  I could have knelt down, and <\p> 
<p> have laid my breast against that soil.  The red clay of which my frame <\p> 
<p> was moulded seemed nearer akin to those crumbling furrows than to any <\p> 
<p> other portion of the world's dust.  There was my home, and there might <\p> 
<p> be my grave. <\p> 

<p> I felt an invincible reluctance, nevertheless, at the idea of <\p> 
<p> presenting myself before my old associates, without first ascertaining <\p> 
<p> the state in which they were.  A nameless foreboding weighed upon me. <\p> 
<p> Perhaps, should I know all the circumstances that had occurred, I might <\p> 
<p> find it my wisest course to turn back, unrecognized, unseen, and never <\p> 
<p> look at Blithedale more.  Had it been evening, I would have stolen <\p> 
<p> softly to some lighted window of the old farmhouse, and peeped darkling <\p> 
<p> in, to see all their well-known faces round the supper-board.  Then, <\p> 
<p> were there a vacant seat, I might noiselessly unclose the door, glide <\p> 
<p> in, and take my place among them, without a word.  My entrance might be <\p> 
<p> so quiet, my aspect so familiar, that they would forget how long I had <\p> 
<p> been away, and suffer me to melt into the scene, as a wreath of vapor <\p> 
<p> melts into a larger cloud. I dreaded a boisterous greeting.  Beholding <\p> 
<p> me at table, Zenobia, as a matter of course, would send me a cup of <\p> 
<p> tea, and Hollingsworth fill my plate from the great dish of pandowdy, <\p> 
<p> and Priscilla, in her quiet way, would hand the cream, and others help <\p> 
<p> me to the bread and butter.  Being one of them again, the knowledge of <\p> 
<p> what had happened would come to me without a shock.  For still, at <\p> 
<p> every turn of my shifting fantasies, the thought stared me in the face <\p> 
<p> that some evil thing had befallen us, or was ready to befall. <\p> 

<p> Yielding to this ominous impression, I now turned aside into the woods, <\p> 
<p> resolving to spy out the posture of the Community as craftily as the <\p> 
<p> wild Indian before he makes his onset.  I would go wandering about the <\p> 
<p> outskirts of the farm, and, perhaps, catching sight of a solitary <\p> 
<p> acquaintance, would approach him amid the brown shadows of the trees (a <\p> 
<p> kind of medium fit for spirits departed and revisitant, like myself), <\p> 
<p> and entreat him to tell me how all things were. <\p> 

<p> The first living creature that I met was a partridge, which sprung up <\p> 
<p> beneath my feet, and whirred away; the next was a squirrel, who <\p> 
<p> chattered angrily at me from an overhanging bough.  I trod along by the <\p> 
<p> dark, sluggish river, and remember pausing on the bank, above one of <\p> 
<p> its blackest and most placid pools (the very spot, with the barkless <\p> 
<p> stump of a tree aslantwise over the water, is depicting itself to my <\p> 
<p> fancy at this instant), and wondering how deep it was, and if any <\p> 
<p> overladen soul had ever flung its weight of mortality in thither, and <\p> 
<p> if it thus escaped the burden, or only made it heavier. And perhaps the <\p> 
<p> skeleton of the drowned wretch still lay beneath the inscrutable depth, <\p> 
<p> clinging to some sunken log at the bottom with the gripe of its old <\p> 
<p> despair.  So slight, however, was the track of these gloomy ideas, that <\p> 
<p> I soon forgot them in the contemplation of a brood of wild ducks, which <\p> 
<p> were floating on the river, and anon took flight, leaving each a bright <\p> 
<p> streak over the black surface.  By and by, I came to my hermitage, in <\p> 
<p> the heart of the white-pine tree, and clambering up into it, sat down <\p> 
<p> to rest.  The grapes, which I had watched throughout the summer, now <\p> 
<p> dangled around me in abundant clusters of the deepest purple, <\p> 
<p> deliciously sweet to the taste, and, though wild, yet free from that <\p> 
<p> ungentle flavor which distinguishes nearly all our native and <\p> 
<p> uncultivated grapes.  Methought a wine might be pressed out of them <\p> 
<p> possessing a passionate zest, and endowed with a new kind of <\p> 
<p> intoxicating quality, attended with such bacchanalian ecstasies as the <\p> 
<p> tamer grapes of Madeira, France, and the Rhine are inadequate to <\p> 
<p> produce.  And I longed to quaff a great goblet of it that moment! <\p> 

<p> While devouring the grapes, I looked on all sides out of the peep-holes <\p> 
<p> of my hermitage, and saw the farmhouse, the fields, and almost every <\p> 
<p> part of our domain, but not a single human figure in the landscape. <\p> 
<p> Some of the windows of the house were open, but with no more signs of <\p> 
<p> life than in a dead man's unshut eyes.  The barn-door was ajar, and <\p> 
<p> swinging in the breeze.  The big old dog,--he was a relic of the former <\p> 
<p> dynasty of the farm,--that hardly ever stirred out of the yard, was <\p> 
<p> nowhere to be seen.  What, then, had become of all the fraternity and <\p> 
<p> sisterhood?  Curious to ascertain this point, I let myself down out of <\p> 
<p> the tree, and going to the edge of the wood, was glad to perceive our <\p> 
<p> herd of cows chewing the cud or grazing not far off.  I fancied, by <\p> 
<p> their manner, that two or three of them recognized me (as, indeed, they <\p> 
<p> ought, for I had milked them and been their chamberlain times without <\p> 
<p> number); but, after staring me in the face a little while, they <\p> 
<p> phlegmatically began grazing and chewing their cuds again.  Then I grew <\p> 
<p> foolishly angry at so cold a reception, and flung some rotten fragments <\p> 
<p> of an old stump at these unsentimental cows. <\p> 

<p> Skirting farther round the pasture, I heard voices and much laughter <\p> 
<p> proceeding from the interior of the wood.  Voices, male and feminine; <\p> 
<p> laughter, not only of fresh young throats, but the bass of grown <\p> 
<p> people, as if solemn organ-pipes should pour out airs of merriment. Not <\p> 
<p> a voice spoke, but I knew it better than my own; not a laugh, but its <\p> 
<p> cadences were familiar.  The wood, in this portion of it, seemed as <\p> 
<p> full of jollity as if Comus and his crew were holding their revels in <\p> 
<p> one of its usually lonesome glades.  Stealing onward as far as I durst, <\p> 
<p> without hazard of discovery, I saw a concourse of strange figures <\p> 
<p> beneath the overshadowing branches.  They appeared, and vanished, and <\p> 
<p> came again, confusedly with the streaks of sunlight glimmering down <\p> 
<p> upon them. <\p> 

<p> Among them was an Indian chief, with blanket, feathers, and war-paint, <\p> 
<p> and uplifted tomahawk; and near him, looking fit to be his woodland <\p> 
<p> bride, the goddess Diana, with the crescent on her head, and attended <\p> 
<p> by our big lazy dog, in lack of any fleeter hound.  Drawing an arrow <\p> 
<p> from her quiver, she let it fly at a venture, and hit the very tree <\p> 
<p> behind which I happened to be lurking.  Another group consisted of a <\p> 
<p> Bavarian broom-girl, a negro of the Jim Crow order, one or two <\p> 
<p> foresters of the Middle Ages, a Kentucky woodsman in his trimmed <\p> 
<p> hunting-shirt and deerskin leggings, and a Shaker elder, quaint, <\p> 
<p> demure, broad-brimmed, and square-skirted.  Shepherds of Arcadia, and <\p> 
<p> allegoric figures from the "Faerie Queen," were oddly mixed up with <\p> 
<p> these.  Arm in arm, or otherwise huddled together in strange <\p> 
<p> discrepancy, stood grim Puritans, gay Cavaliers, and Revolutionary <\p> 
<p> officers with three-cornered cocked hats, and queues longer than their <\p> 
<p> swords.  A bright-complexioned, dark-haired, vivacious little gypsy, <\p> 
<p> with a red shawl over her head, went from one group to another, telling <\p> 
<p> fortunes by palmistry; and Moll Pitcher, the renowned old witch of <\p> 
<p> Lynn, broomstick in hand, showed herself prominently in the midst, as <\p> 
<p> if announcing all these apparitions to be the offspring of her <\p> 
<p> necromantic art.  But Silas Foster, who leaned against a tree near by, <\p> 
<p> in his customary blue frock and smoking a short pipe, did more to <\p> 
<p> disenchant the scene, with his look of shrewd, acrid, Yankee <\p> 
<p> observation, than twenty witches and necromancers could have done in <\p> 
<p> the way of rendering it weird and fantastic. <\p> 

<p> A little farther off, some old-fashioned skinkers and drawers, all with <\p> 
<p> portentously red noses, were spreading a banquet on the leaf-strewn <\p> 
<p> earth; while a horned and long-tailed gentleman (in whom I recognized <\p> 
<p> the fiendish musician erst seen by Tam O'Shanter) tuned his fiddle, and <\p> 
<p> summoned the whole motley rout to a dance, before partaking of the <\p> 
<p> festal cheer.  So they joined hands in a circle, whirling round so <\p> 
<p> swiftly, so madly, and so merrily, in time and tune with the Satanic <\p> 
<p> music, that their separate incongruities were blended all together, and <\p> 
<p> they became a kind of entanglement that went nigh to turn one's brain <\p> 
<p> with merely looking at it.  Anon they stopt all of a sudden, and <\p> 
<p> staring at one another's figures, set up a roar of laughter; whereat a <\p> 
<p> shower of the September leaves (which, all day long, had been <\p> 
<p> hesitating whether to fall or no) were shaken off by the movement of <\p> 
<p> the air, and came eddying down upon the revellers. <\p> 

<p> Then, for lack of breath, ensued a silence, at the deepest point of <\p> 
<p> which, tickled by the oddity of surprising my grave associates in this <\p> 
<p> masquerading trim, I could not possibly refrain from a burst of <\p> 
<p> laughter on my own separate account. <\p> 

<p> "Hush!"  I heard the pretty gypsy fortuneteller say.  "Who is that <\p> 
<p> laughing?" <\p> 

<p> "Some profane intruder!" said the goddess Diana.  "I shall send an <\p> 
<p> arrow through his heart, or change him into a stag, as I did Actaeon, <\p> 
<p> if he peeps from behind the trees!" <\p> 

<p> "Me take his scalp!" cried the Indian chief, brandishing his tomahawk, <\p> 
<p> and cutting a great caper in the air. <\p> 

<p> "I'll root him in the earth with a spell that I have at my tongue's <\p> 
<p> end!" squeaked Moll Pitcher.  "And the green moss shall grow all over <\p> 
<p> him, before he gets free again!" <\p> 

<p> "The voice was Miles Coverdale's," said the fiendish fiddler, with a <\p> 
<p> whisk of his tail and a toss of his horns.  "My music has brought him <\p> 
<p> hither.  He is always ready to dance to the Devil's tune!" <\p> 

<p> Thus put on the right track, they all recognized the voice at once, and <\p> 
<p> set up a simultaneous shout. <\p> 

<p> "Miles!  Miles!  Miles Coverdale, where are you?" they cried. "Zenobia! <\p> 
<p> Queen Zenobia! here is one of your vassals lurking in the wood. <\p> 
<p> Command him to approach and pay his duty!" <\p> 

<p> The whole fantastic rabble forthwith streamed off in pursuit of me, so <\p> 
<p> that I was like a mad poet hunted by chimeras.  Having fairly the start <\p> 
<p> of them, however, I succeeded in making my escape, and soon left their <\p> 
<p> merriment and riot at a good distance in the rear.  Its fainter tones <\p> 
<p> assumed a kind of mournfulness, and were finally lost in the hush and <\p> 
<p> solemnity of the wood.  In my haste, I stumbled over a heap of logs and <\p> 
<p> sticks that had been cut for firewood, a great while ago, by some <\p> 
<p> former possessor of the soil, and piled up square, in order to be <\p> 
<p> carted or sledded away to the farmhouse.  But, being forgotten, they <\p> 
<p> had lain there perhaps fifty years, and possibly much longer; until, by <\p> 
<p> the accumulation of moss, and the leaves falling over them, and <\p> 
<p> decaying there, from autumn to autumn, a green mound was formed, in <\p> 
<p> which the softened outline of the woodpile was still perceptible.  In <\p> 
<p> the fitful mood that then swayed my mind, I found something strangely <\p> 
<p> affecting in this simple circumstance.  I imagined the long-dead <\p> 
<p> woodman, and his long-dead wife and children, coming out of their chill <\p> 
<p> graves, and essaying to make a fire with this heap of mossy fuel! <\p> 

<p> From this spot I strayed onward, quite lost in reverie, and neither <\p> 
<p> knew nor cared whither I was going, until a low, soft, well-remembered <\p> 
<p> voice spoke, at a little distance. <\p> 

<p> "There is Mr. Coverdale!" <\p> 

<p> "Miles Coverdale!" said another voice,--and its tones were very stern. <\p> 
<p> "Let him come forward, then!" <\p> 

<p> "Yes, Mr. Coverdale," cried a woman's voice,--clear and melodious, but, <\p> 
<p> just then, with something unnatural in its chord,--"you are welcome! <\p> 
<p> But you come half an hour too late, and have missed a scene which you <\p> 
<p> would have enjoyed!" <\p> 

<p> I looked up and found myself nigh Eliot's pulpit, at the base of which <\p> 
<p> sat Hollingsworth, with Priscilla at his feet and Zenobia standing <\p> 
<p> before them. <\p> 

<p> XXV. THE THREE TOGETHER <\p> 

<p> Hollingsworth was in his ordinary working-dress.  Priscilla wore a <\p> 
<p> pretty and simple gown, with a kerchief about her neck, and a calash, <\p> 
<p> which she had flung back from her head, leaving it suspended by the <\p> 
<p> strings.  But Zenobia (whose part among the maskers, as may be <\p> 
<p> supposed, was no inferior one) appeared in a costume of fanciful <\p> 
<p> magnificence, with her jewelled flower as the central ornament of what <\p> 
<p> resembled a leafy crown, or coronet.  She represented the Oriental <\p> 
<p> princess by whose name we were accustomed to know her.  Her attitude <\p> 
<p> was free and noble; yet, if a queen's, it was not that of a queen <\p> 
<p> triumphant, but dethroned, on trial for her life, or, perchance, <\p> 
<p> condemned already.  The spirit of the conflict seemed, nevertheless, to <\p> 
<p> be alive in her.  Her eyes were on fire; her cheeks had each a crimson <\p> 
<p> spot, so exceedingly vivid, and marked with so definite an outline, <\p> 
<p> that I at first doubted whether it were not artificial.  In a very <\p> 
<p> brief space, however, this idea was shamed by the paleness that ensued, <\p> 
<p> as the blood sunk suddenly away.  Zenobia now looked like marble. <\p> 

<p> One always feels the fact, in an instant, when he has intruded on those <\p> 
<p> who love, or those who hate, at some acme of their passion that puts <\p> 
<p> them into a sphere of their own, where no other spirit can pretend to <\p> 
<p> stand on equal ground with them.  I was confused,--affected even with a <\p> 
<p> species of terror,--and wished myself away. The intenseness of their <\p> 
<p> feelings gave them the exclusive property of the soil and atmosphere, <\p> 
<p> and left me no right to be or breathe there. <\p> 

<p> "Hollingsworth,--Zenobia,--I have just returned to Blithedale," said I, <\p> 
<p> "and had no thought of finding you here.  We shall meet again at the <\p> 
<p> house.  I will retire." <\p> 

<p> "This place is free to you," answered Hollingsworth. <\p> 

<p> "As free as to ourselves," added Zenobia.  "This long while past, you <\p> 
<p> have been following up your game, groping for human emotions in the <\p> 
<p> dark corners of the heart.  Had you been here a little sooner, you <\p> 
<p> might have seen them dragged into the daylight.  I could even wish to <\p> 
<p> have my trial over again, with you standing by to see fair play!  Do <\p> 
<p> you know, Mr. Coverdale, I have been on trial for my life?" <\p> 

<p> She laughed, while speaking thus.  But, in truth, as my eyes wandered <\p> 
<p> from one of the group to another, I saw in Hollingsworth all that an <\p> 
<p> artist could desire for the grim portrait of a Puritan magistrate <\p> 
<p> holding inquest of life and death in a case of witchcraft; in Zenobia, <\p> 
<p> the sorceress herself, not aged, wrinkled, and decrepit, but fair <\p> 
<p> enough to tempt Satan with a force reciprocal to his own; and, in <\p> 
<p> Priscilla, the pale victim, whose soul and body had been wasted by her <\p> 
<p> spells.  Had a pile of fagots been heaped against the rock, this hint <\p> 
<p> of impending doom would have completed the suggestive picture. <\p> 

<p> "It was too hard upon me," continued Zenobia, addressing Hollingsworth, <\p> 
<p> "that judge, jury, and accuser should all be comprehended in one man! <\p> 
<p> I demur, as I think the lawyers say, to the jurisdiction.  But let the <\p> 
<p> learned Judge Coverdale seat himself on the top of the rock, and you <\p> 
<p> and me stand at its base, side by side, pleading our cause before him! <\p> 
<p> There might, at least, be two criminals instead of one." <\p> 

<p> "You forced this on me," replied Hollingsworth, looking her sternly in <\p> 
<p> the face.  "Did I call you hither from among the masqueraders yonder? <\p> 
<p> Do I assume to be your judge?  No; except so far as I have an <\p> 
<p> unquestionable right of judgment, in order to settle my own line of <\p> 
<p> behavior towards those with whom the events of life bring me in <\p> 
<p> contact.  True, I have already judged you, but not on the world's <\p> 
<p> part,--neither do I pretend to pass a sentence!" <\p> 

<p> "Ah, this is very good!" cried Zenobia with a smile.  "What strange <\p> 
<p> beings you men are, Mr. Coverdale!--is it not so?  It is the simplest <\p> 
<p> thing in the world with you to bring a woman before your secret <\p> 
<p> tribunals, and judge and condemn her unheard, and then tell her to go <\p> 
<p> free without a sentence.  The misfortune is, that this same secret <\p> 
<p> tribunal chances to be the only judgment-seat that a true woman stands <\p> 
<p> in awe of, and that any verdict short of acquittal is equivalent to a <\p> 
<p> death sentence!" <\p> 

<p> The more I looked at them, and the more I heard, the stronger grew my <\p> 
<p> impression that a crisis had just come and gone.  On Hollingsworth's <\p> 
<p> brow it had left a stamp like that of irrevocable doom, of which his <\p> 
<p> own will was the instrument.  In Zenobia's whole person, beholding her <\p> 
<p> more closely, I saw a riotous agitation; the almost delirious <\p> 
<p> disquietude of a great struggle, at the close of which the vanquished <\p> 
<p> one felt her strength and courage still mighty within her, and longed <\p> 
<p> to renew the contest.  My sensations were as if I had come upon a <\p> 
<p> battlefield before the smoke was as yet cleared away. <\p> 

<p> And what subjects had been discussed here?  All, no doubt, that for so <\p> 
<p> many months past had kept my heart and my imagination idly feverish. <\p> 
<p> Zenobia's whole character and history; the true nature of her <\p> 
<p> mysterious connection with Westervelt; her later purposes towards <\p> 
<p> Hollingsworth, and, reciprocally, his in reference to her; and, <\p> 
<p> finally, the degree in which Zenobia had been cognizant of the plot <\p> 
<p> against Priscilla, and what, at last, had been the real object of that <\p> 
<p> scheme.  On these points, as before, I was left to my own conjectures. <\p> 
<p> One thing, only, was certain.  Zenobia and Hollingsworth were friends <\p> 
<p> no longer.  If their heartstrings were ever intertwined, the knot had <\p> 
<p> been adjudged an entanglement, and was now violently broken. <\p> 

<p> But Zenobia seemed unable to rest content with the matter in the <\p> 
<p> posture which it had assumed. <\p> 

<p> "Ah! do we part so?" exclaimed she, seeing Hollingsworth about to <\p> 
<p> retire. <\p> 

<p> "And why not?" said he, with almost rude abruptness.  "What is there <\p> 
<p> further to be said between us?" <\p> 

<p> "Well, perhaps nothing," answered Zenobia, looking him in the face, and <\p> 
<p> smiling.  "But we have come many times before to this gray rock, and we <\p> 
<p> have talked very softly among the whisperings of the birch-trees.  They <\p> 
<p> were pleasant hours!  I love to make the latest of them, though not <\p> 
<p> altogether so delightful, loiter away as slowly as may be.  And, <\p> 
<p> besides, you have put many queries to me at this, which you design to <\p> 
<p> be our last interview; and being driven, as I must acknowledge, into a <\p> 
<p> corner, I have responded with reasonable frankness.  But now, with your <\p> 
<p> free consent, I desire the privilege of asking a few questions, in my <\p> 
<p> turn." <\p> 

<p> "I have no concealments," said Hollingsworth. <\p> 

<p> "We shall see," answered Zenobia.  "I would first inquire whether you <\p> 
<p> have supposed me to be wealthy?" <\p> 

<p> "On that point," observed Hollingsworth, "I have had the opinion which <\p> 
<p> the world holds." <\p> 

<p> "And I held it likewise," said Zenobia.  "Had I not, Heaven is my <\p> 
<p> witness the knowledge should have been as free to you as me.  It is <\p> 
<p> only three days since I knew the strange fact that threatens to make me <\p> 
<p> poor; and your own acquaintance with it, I suspect, is of at least as <\p> 
<p> old a date.  I fancied myself affluent.  You are aware, too, of the <\p> 
<p> disposition which I purposed making of the larger portion of my <\p> 
<p> imaginary opulence,--nay, were it all, I had not hesitated.  Let me ask <\p> 
<p> you, further, did I ever propose or intimate any terms of compact, on <\p> 
<p> which depended this--as the world would consider it--so important <\p> 
<p> sacrifice?" <\p> 

<p> "You certainly spoke of none," said Hollingsworth. <\p> 

<p> "Nor meant any," she responded.  "I was willing to realize your dream <\p> 
<p> freely,--generously, as some might think,--but, at all events, fully, <\p> 
<p> and heedless though it should prove the ruin of my fortune. If, in your <\p> 
<p> own thoughts, you have imposed any conditions of this expenditure, it <\p> 
<p> is you that must be held responsible for whatever is sordid and <\p> 
<p> unworthy in them.  And now one other question.  Do you love this girl?" <\p> 

<p> "O Zenobia!" exclaimed Priscilla, shrinking back, as if longing for the <\p> 
<p> rock to topple over and hide her. <\p> 

<p> "Do you love her?" repeated Zenobia. <\p> 

<p> "Had you asked me that question a short time since," replied <\p> 
<p> Hollingsworth, after a pause, during which, it seemed to me, even the <\p> 
<p> birch-trees held their whispering breath, "I should have told <\p> 
<p> you--'No!' My feelings for Priscilla differed little from those of an <\p> 
<p> elder brother, watching tenderly over the gentle sister whom God has <\p> 
<p> given him to protect." <\p> 

<p> "And what is your answer now?" persisted Zenobia. <\p> 

<p> "I do love her!" said Hollingsworth, uttering the words with a deep <\p> 
<p> inward breath, instead of speaking them outright.  "As well declare it <\p> 
<p> thus as in any other way.  I do love her!" <\p> 

<p> "Now, God be judge between us," cried Zenobia, breaking into sudden <\p> 
<p> passion, "which of us two has most mortally offended Him!  At least, I <\p> 
<p> am a woman, with every fault, it may be, that a woman ever had,--weak, <\p> 
<p> vain, unprincipled (like most of my sex; for our virtues, when we have <\p> 
<p> any, are merely impulsive and intuitive), passionate, too, and pursuing <\p> 
<p> my foolish and unattainable ends by indirect and cunning, though <\p> 
<p> absurdly chosen means, as an hereditary bond-slave must; false, <\p> 
<p> moreover, to the whole circle of good, in my reckless truth to the <\p> 
<p> little good I saw before me,--but still a woman!  A creature whom only <\p> 
<p> a little change of earthly fortune, a little kinder smile of Him who <\p> 
<p> sent me hither, and one true heart to encourage and direct me, might <\p> 
<p> have made all that a woman can be! But how is it with you?  Are you a <\p> 
<p> man?  No; but a monster!  A cold, heartless, self-beginning and <\p> 
<p> self-ending piece of mechanism!" <\p> 

<p> "With what, then, do you charge me!" asked Hollingsworth, aghast, and <\p> 
<p> greatly disturbed by this attack.  "Show me one selfish end, in all I <\p> 
<p> ever aimed at, and you may cut it out of my bosom with a knife!" <\p> 

<p> "It is all self!" answered Zenobia with still intenser bitterness. <\p> 
<p> "Nothing else; nothing but self, self, self!  The fiend, I doubt not, <\p> 
<p> has made his choicest mirth of you these seven years past, and <\p> 
<p> especially in the mad summer which we have spent together.  I see it <\p> 
<p> now!  I am awake, disenchanted, disinthralled!  Self, self, self! You <\p> 
<p> have embodied yourself in a project.  You are a better masquerader than <\p> 
<p> the witches and gypsies yonder; for your disguise is a self-deception. <\p> 
<p> See whither it has brought you!  First, you aimed a death-blow, and a <\p> 
<p> treacherous one, at this scheme of a purer and higher life, which so <\p> 
<p> many noble spirits had wrought out.  Then, because Coverdale could not <\p> 
<p> be quite your slave, you threw him ruthlessly away.  And you took me, <\p> 
<p> too, into your plan, as long as there was hope of my being available, <\p> 
<p> and now fling me aside again, a broken tool!  But, foremost and <\p> 
<p> blackest of your sins, you stifled down your inmost consciousness!--you <\p> 
<p> did a deadly wrong to your own heart!--you were ready to sacrifice this <\p> 
<p> girl, whom, if God ever visibly showed a purpose, He put into your <\p> 
<p> charge, and through whom He was striving to redeem you!" <\p> 

<p> "This is a woman's view," said Hollingsworth, growing deadly pale,--"a <\p> 
<p> woman's, whose whole sphere of action is in the heart, and who can <\p> 
<p> conceive of no higher nor wider one!" <\p> 

<p> "Be silent!" cried Zenobia imperiously.  "You know neither man nor <\p> 
<p> woman!  The utmost that can be said in your behalf--and because I would <\p> 
<p> not be wholly despicable in my own eyes, but would fain excuse my <\p> 
<p> wasted feelings, nor own it wholly a delusion, therefore I say it--is, <\p> 
<p> that a great and rich heart has been ruined in your breast. Leave me, <\p> 
<p> now.  You have done with me, and I with you.  Farewell!" <\p> 

<p> "Priscilla," said Hollingsworth, "come."  Zenobia smiled; possibly I <\p> 
<p> did so too.  Not often, in human life, has a gnawing sense of injury <\p> 
<p> found a sweeter morsel of revenge than was conveyed in the tone with <\p> 
<p> which Hollingsworth spoke those two words.  It was the abased and <\p> 
<p> tremulous tone of a man whose faith in himself was shaken, and who <\p> 
<p> sought, at last, to lean on an affection.  Yes; the strong man bowed <\p> 
<p> himself and rested on this poor Priscilla!  Oh, could she have failed <\p> 
<p> him, what a triumph for the lookers-on! <\p> 

<p> And, at first, I half imagined that she was about to fail him.  She <\p> 
<p> rose up, stood shivering like the birch leaves that trembled over her <\p> 
<p> head, and then slowly tottered, rather than walked, towards Zenobia. <\p> 
<p> Arriving at her feet, she sank down there, in the very same attitude <\p> 
<p> which she had assumed on their first meeting, in the kitchen of the old <\p> 
<p> farmhouse.  Zenobia remembered it. <\p> 

<p> "Ah, Priscilla!" said she, shaking her head, "how much is changed since <\p> 
<p> then!  You kneel to a dethroned princess.  You, the victorious one! <\p> 
<p> But he is waiting for you.  Say what you wish, and leave me." <\p> 

<p> "We are sisters!" gasped Priscilla. <\p> 

<p> I fancied that I understood the word and action.  It meant the offering <\p> 
<p> of herself, and all she had, to be at Zenobia's disposal. But the <\p> 
<p> latter would not take it thus. <\p> 

<p> "True, we are sisters!" she replied; and, moved by the sweet word, she <\p> 
<p> stooped down and kissed Priscilla; but not lovingly, for a sense of <\p> 
<p> fatal harm received through her seemed to be lurking in Zenobia's <\p> 
<p> heart.  "We had one father!  You knew it from the first; I, but a <\p> 
<p> little while,--else some things that have chanced might have been <\p> 
<p> spared you.  But I never wished you harm.  You stood between me and an <\p> 
<p> end which I desired.  I wanted a clear path.  No matter what I meant. <\p> 
<p> It is over now.  Do you forgive me?" <\p> 

<p> "O Zenobia," sobbed Priscilla, "it is I that feel like the guilty one!" <\p> 

<p> "No, no, poor little thing!" said Zenobia, with a sort of contempt. <\p> 
<p> "You have been my evil fate, but there never was a babe with less <\p> 
<p> strength or will to do an injury.  Poor child!  Methinks you have but a <\p> 
<p> melancholy lot before you, sitting all alone in that wide, cheerless <\p> 
<p> heart, where, for aught you know,--and as I, alas! believe,--the fire <\p> 
<p> which you have kindled may soon go out.  Ah, the thought makes me <\p> 
<p> shiver for you!  What will you do, Priscilla, when you find no spark <\p> 
<p> among the ashes?" <\p> 

<p> "Die!" she answered. <\p> 

<p> "That was well said!" responded Zenobia, with an approving smile. <\p> 
<p> "There is all a woman in your little compass, my poor sister. <\p> 
<p> Meanwhile, go with him, and live!" <\p> 

<p> She waved her away with a queenly gesture, and turned her own face to <\p> 
<p> the rock.  I watched Priscilla, wondering what judgment she would pass <\p> 
<p> between Zenobia and Hollingsworth; how interpret his behavior, so as to <\p> 
<p> reconcile it with true faith both towards her sister and herself; how <\p> 
<p> compel her love for him to keep any terms whatever with her sisterly <\p> 
<p> affection!  But, in truth, there was no such difficulty as I imagined. <\p> 
<p> Her engrossing love made it all clear.  Hollingsworth could have no <\p> 
<p> fault.  That was the one principle at the centre of the universe.  And <\p> 
<p> the doubtful guilt or possible integrity of other people, appearances, <\p> 
<p> self-evident facts, the testimony of her own senses,--even <\p> 
<p> Hollingsworth's self-accusation, had he volunteered it,--would have <\p> 
<p> weighed not the value of a mote of thistledown on the other side.  So <\p> 
<p> secure was she of his right, that she never thought of comparing it <\p> 
<p> with another's wrong, but left the latter to itself. <\p> 

<p> Hollingsworth drew her arm within his, and soon disappeared with her <\p> 
<p> among the trees.  I cannot imagine how Zenobia knew when they were out <\p> 
<p> of sight; she never glanced again towards them.  But, retaining a proud <\p> 
<p> attitude so long as they might have thrown back a retiring look, they <\p> 
<p> were no sooner departed,--utterly departed,--than she began slowly to <\p> 
<p> sink down.  It was as if a great, invisible, irresistible weight were <\p> 
<p> pressing her to the earth.  Settling upon her knees, she leaned her <\p> 
<p> forehead against the rock, and sobbed convulsively; dry sobs they <\p> 
<p> seemed to be, such as have nothing to do with tears. <\p> 

<p> XXVI. ZENOBIA AND COVERDALE <\p> 

<p> Zenobia had entirely forgotten me.  She fancied herself alone with her <\p> 
<p> great grief.  And had it been only a common pity that I felt for <\p> 
<p> her,--the pity that her proud nature would have repelled, as the one <\p> 
<p> worst wrong which the world yet held in reserve,--the sacredness and <\p> 
<p> awfulness of the crisis might have impelled me to steal away silently, <\p> 
<p> so that not a dry leaf should rustle under my feet.  I would have left <\p> 
<p> her to struggle, in that solitude, with only the eye of God upon her. <\p> 
<p> But, so it happened, I never once dreamed of questioning my right to be <\p> 
<p> there now, as I had questioned it just before, when I came so suddenly <\p> 
<p> upon Hollingsworth and herself, in the passion of their recent debate. <\p> 
<p> It suits me not to explain what was the analogy that I saw or imagined <\p> 
<p> between Zenobia's situation and mine; nor, I believe, will the reader <\p> 
<p> detect this one secret, hidden beneath many a revelation which perhaps <\p> 
<p> concerned me less.  In simple truth, however, as Zenobia leaned her <\p> 
<p> forehead against the rock, shaken with that tearless agony, it seemed <\p> 
<p> to me that the self-same pang, with hardly mitigated torment, leaped <\p> 
<p> thrilling from her heartstrings to my own.  Was it wrong, therefore, if <\p> 
<p> I felt myself consecrated to the priesthood by sympathy like this, and <\p> 
<p> called upon to minister to this woman's affliction, so far as mortal <\p> 
<p> could? <\p> 

<p> But, indeed, what could mortal do for her?  Nothing!  The attempt would <\p> 
<p> be a mockery and an anguish.  Time, it is true, would steal away her <\p> 
<p> grief, and bury it and the best of her heart in the same grave.  But <\p> 
<p> Destiny itself, methought, in its kindliest mood, could do no better <\p> 
<p> for Zenobia, in the way of quick relief; than to cause the impending <\p> 
<p> rock to impend a little farther, and fall upon her head. So I leaned <\p> 
<p> against a tree, and listened to her sobs, in unbroken silence.  She was <\p> 
<p> half prostrate, half kneeling, with her forehead still pressed against <\p> 
<p> the rock.  Her sobs were the only sound; she did not groan, nor give <\p> 
<p> any other utterance to her distress.  It was all involuntary. <\p> 

<p> At length she sat up, put back her hair, and stared about her with a <\p> 
<p> bewildered aspect, as if not distinctly recollecting the scene through <\p> 
<p> which she had passed, nor cognizant of the situation in which it left <\p> 
<p> her.  Her face and brow were almost purple with the rush of blood. <\p> 
<p> They whitened, however, by and by, and for some time retained this <\p> 
<p> deathlike hue.  She put her hand to her forehead, with a gesture that <\p> 
<p> made me forcibly conscious of an intense and living pain there. <\p> 

<p> Her glance, wandering wildly to and fro, passed over me several times, <\p> 
<p> without appearing to inform her of my presence.  But, finally, a look <\p> 
<p> of recognition gleamed from her eyes into mine. <\p> 

<p> "Is it you, Miles Coverdale?" said she, smiling.  "Ah, I perceive what <\p> 
<p> you are about!  You are turning this whole affair into a ballad. Pray <\p> 
<p> let me hear as many stanzas as you happen to have ready." <\p> 

<p> "Oh, hush, Zenobia!"  I answered.  "Heaven knows what an ache is in my <\p> 
<p> soul!" <\p> 

<p> "It is genuine tragedy, is it not?" rejoined Zenobia, with a sharp, <\p> 
<p> light laugh.  "And you are willing to allow, perhaps, that I have had <\p> 
<p> hard measure.  But it is a woman's doom, and I have deserved it like a <\p> 
<p> woman; so let there be no pity, as, on my part, there shall be no <\p> 
<p> complaint.  It is all right, now, or will shortly be so.  But, Mr. <\p> 
<p> Coverdale, by all means write this ballad, and put your soul's ache <\p> 
<p> into it, and turn your sympathy to good account, as other poets do, and <\p> 
<p> as poets must, unless they choose to give us glittering icicles instead <\p> 
<p> of lines of fire.  As for the moral, it shall be distilled into the <\p> 
<p> final stanza, in a drop of bitter honey." <\p> 

<p> "What shall it be, Zenobia?"  I inquired, endeavoring to fall in with <\p> 
<p> her mood. <\p> 

<p> "Oh, a very old one will serve the purpose," she replied.  "There are <\p> 
<p> no new truths, much as we have prided ourselves on finding some.  A <\p> 
<p> moral?  Why, this: That, in the battlefield of life, the downright <\p> 
<p> stroke, that would fall only on a man's steel headpiece, is sure to <\p> 
<p> light on a woman's heart, over which she wears no breastplate, and <\p> 
<p> whose wisdom it is, therefore, to keep out of the conflict.  Or, this: <\p> 
<p> That the whole universe, her own sex and yours, and Providence, or <\p> 
<p> Destiny, to boot, make common cause against the woman who swerves one <\p> 
<p> hair's-breadth out of the beaten track.  Yes; and add (for I may as <\p> 
<p> well own it, now) that, with that one hair's-breadth, she goes all <\p> 
<p> astray, and never sees the world in its true aspect afterwards." <\p> 

<p> "This last is too stern a moral," I observed.  "Cannot we soften it a <\p> 
<p> little?" <\p> 

<p> "Do it if you like, at your own peril, not on my responsibility," she <\p> 
<p> answered.  Then, with a sudden change of subject, she went on: "After <\p> 
<p> all, he has flung away what would have served him better than the poor, <\p> 
<p> pale flower he kept.  What can Priscilla do for him?  Put passionate <\p> 
<p> warmth into his heart, when it shall be chilled with frozen hopes? <\p> 
<p> Strengthen his hands, when they are weary with much doing and no <\p> 
<p> performance?  No! but only tend towards him with a blind, instinctive <\p> 
<p> love, and hang her little, puny weakness for a clog upon his arm!  She <\p> 
<p> cannot even give him such sympathy as is worth the name.  For will he <\p> 
<p> never, in many an hour of darkness, need that proud intellectual <\p> 
<p> sympathy which he might have had from me?--the sympathy that would <\p> 
<p> flash light along his course, and guide, as well as cheer him?  Poor <\p> 
<p> Hollingsworth! Where will he find it now?" <\p> 

<p> "Hollingsworth has a heart of ice!" said I bitterly.  "He is a wretch!" <\p> 

<p> "Do him no wrong," interrupted Zenobia, turning haughtily upon me. <\p> 
<p> "Presume not to estimate a man like Hollingsworth.  It was my fault, <\p> 
<p> all along, and none of his.  I see it now!  He never sought me.  Why <\p> 
<p> should he seek me?  What had I to offer him?  A miserable, bruised, and <\p> 
<p> battered heart, spoilt long before he met me.  A life, too, hopelessly <\p> 
<p> entangled with a villain's!  He did well to cast me off. God be <\p> 
<p> praised, he did it!  And yet, had he trusted me, and borne with me a <\p> 
<p> little longer, I would have saved him all this trouble." <\p> 

<p> She was silent for a time, and stood with her eyes fixed on the ground. <\p> 
<p> Again raising them, her look was more mild and calm. <\p> 

<p> "Miles Coverdale!" said she. <\p> 

<p> "Well, Zenobia," I responded.  "Can I do you any service?" <\p> 

<p> "Very little," she replied.  "But it is my purpose, as you may well <\p> 
<p> imagine, to remove from Blithedale; and, most likely, I may not see <\p> 
<p> Hollingsworth again.  A woman in my position, you understand, feels <\p> 
<p> scarcely at her ease among former friends.  New faces,--unaccustomed <\p> 
<p> looks,--those only can she tolerate.  She would pine among familiar <\p> 
<p> scenes; she would be apt to blush, too, under the eyes that knew her <\p> 
<p> secret; her heart might throb uncomfortably; she would mortify herself, <\p> 
<p> I suppose, with foolish notions of having sacrificed the honor of her <\p> 
<p> sex at the foot of proud, contumacious man.  Poor womanhood, with its <\p> 
<p> rights and wrongs!  Here will be new matter for my course of lectures, <\p> 
<p> at the idea of which you smiled, Mr. Coverdale, a month or two ago. <\p> 
<p> But, as you have really a heart and sympathies, as far as they go, and <\p> 
<p> as I shall depart without seeing Hollingsworth, I must entreat you to <\p> 
<p> be a messenger between him and me." <\p> 

<p> "Willingly," said I, wondering at the strange way in which her mind <\p> 
<p> seemed to vibrate from the deepest earnest to mere levity.  "What is <\p> 
<p> the message?" <\p> 

<p> "True,--what is it?" exclaimed Zenobia.  "After all, I hardly know. On <\p> 
<p> better consideration, I have no message.  Tell him,--tell him something <\p> 
<p> pretty and pathetic, that will come nicely and sweetly into your <\p> 
<p> ballad,--anything you please, so it be tender and submissive enough. <\p> 
<p> Tell him he has murdered me!  Tell him that I'll haunt him! "--She <\p> 
<p> spoke these words with the wildest energy.--"And give him--no, give <\p> 
<p> Priscilla--this!" <\p> 

<p> Thus saying, she took the jewelled flower out of her hair; and it <\p> 
<p> struck me as the act of a queen, when worsted in a combat, discrowning <\p> 
<p> herself, as if she found a sort of relief in abasing all her pride. <\p> 

<p> "Bid her wear this for Zenobia's sake," she continued.  "She is a <\p> 
<p> pretty little creature, and will make as soft and gentle a wife as the <\p> 
<p> veriest Bluebeard could desire.  Pity that she must fade so soon! These <\p> 
<p> delicate and puny maidens always do.  Ten years hence, let <\p> 
<p> Hollingsworth look at my face and Priscilla's, and then choose betwixt <\p> 
<p> them.  Or, if he pleases, let him do it now." <\p> 

<p> How magnificently Zenobia looked as she said this!  The effect of her <\p> 
<p> beauty was even heightened by the over-consciousness and <\p> 
<p> self-recognition of it, into which, I suppose, Hollingsworth's scorn <\p> 
<p> had driven her.  She understood the look of admiration in my face; <\p> 
<p> and--Zenobia to the last--it gave her pleasure. <\p> 

<p> "It is an endless pity," said she, "that I had not bethought myself of <\p> 
<p> winning your heart, Mr. Coverdale, instead of Hollingsworth's.  I think <\p> 
<p> I should have succeeded, and many women would have deemed you the <\p> 
<p> worthier conquest of the two.  You are certainly much the handsomest <\p> 
<p> man.  But there is a fate in these things.  And beauty, in a man, has <\p> 
<p> been of little account with me since my earliest girlhood, when, for <\p> 
<p> once, it turned my head.  Now, farewell!" <\p> 

<p> "Zenobia, whither are you going?"  I asked. <\p> 

<p> "No matter where," said she.  "But I am weary of this place, and sick <\p> 
<p> to death of playing at philanthropy and progress.  Of all varieties of <\p> 
<p> mock-life, we have surely blundered into the very emptiest mockery in <\p> 
<p> our effort to establish the one true system.  I have done with it; and <\p> 
<p> Blithedale must find another woman to superintend the laundry, and you, <\p> 
<p> Mr. Coverdale, another nurse to make your gruel, the next time you fall <\p> 
<p> ill.  It was, indeed, a foolish dream!  Yet it gave us some pleasant <\p> 
<p> summer days, and bright hopes, while they lasted.  It can do no more; <\p> 
<p> nor will it avail us to shed tears over a broken bubble.  Here is my <\p> 
<p> hand!  Adieu!" <\p> 

<p> She gave me her hand with the same free, whole-souled gesture as on the <\p> 
<p> first afternoon of our acquaintance, and, being greatly moved, I <\p> 
<p> bethought me of no better method of expressing my deep sympathy than to <\p> 
<p> carry it to my lips.  In so doing, I perceived that this white hand--so <\p> 
<p> hospitably warm when I first touched it, five months since--was now <\p> 
<p> cold as a veritable piece of snow. <\p> 

<p> "How very cold!"  I exclaimed, holding it between both my own, with the <\p> 
<p> vain idea of warming it.  "What can be the reason?  It is really <\p> 
<p> deathlike!" <\p> 

<p> "The extremities die first, they say," answered Zenobia, laughing. "And <\p> 
<p> so you kiss this poor, despised, rejected hand!  Well, my dear friend, <\p> 
<p> I thank you.  You have reserved your homage for the fallen. Lip of man <\p> 
<p> will never touch my hand again.  I intend to become a Catholic, for the <\p> 
<p> sake of going into a nunnery.  When you next hear of Zenobia, her face <\p> 
<p> will be behind the black veil; so look your last at it now,--for all is <\p> 
<p> over.  Once more, farewell!" <\p> 

<p> She withdrew her hand, yet left a lingering pressure, which I felt long <\p> 
<p> afterwards.  So intimately connected as I had been with perhaps the <\p> 
<p> only man in whom she was ever truly interested, Zenobia looked on me as <\p> 
<p> the representative of all the past, and was conscious that, in bidding <\p> 
<p> me adieu, she likewise took final leave of Hollingsworth, and of this <\p> 
<p> whole epoch of her life.  Never did her beauty shine out more <\p> 
<p> lustrously than in the last glimpse that I had of her.  She departed, <\p> 
<p> and was soon hidden among the trees.  But, whether it was the strong <\p> 
<p> impression of the foregoing scene, or whatever else the cause, I was <\p> 
<p> affected with a fantasy that Zenobia had not actually gone, but was <\p> 
<p> still hovering about the spot and haunting it.  I seemed to feel her <\p> 
<p> eyes upon me.  It was as if the vivid coloring of her character had <\p> 
<p> left a brilliant stain upon the air.  By degrees, however, the <\p> 
<p> impression grew less distinct.  I flung myself upon the fallen leaves <\p> 
<p> at the base of Eliot's pulpit.  The sunshine withdrew up the tree <\p> 
<p> trunks and flickered on the topmost boughs; gray twilight made the wood <\p> 
<p> obscure; the stars brightened out; the pendent boughs became wet with <\p> 
<p> chill autumnal dews.  But I was listless, worn out with emotion on my <\p> 
<p> own behalf and sympathy for others, and had no heart to leave my <\p> 
<p> comfortless lair beneath the rock. <\p> 

<p> I must have fallen asleep, and had a dream, all the circumstances of <\p> 
<p> which utterly vanished at the moment when they converged to some <\p> 
<p> tragical catastrophe, and thus grew too powerful for the thin sphere of <\p> 
<p> slumber that enveloped them.  Starting from the ground, I found the <\p> 
<p> risen moon shining upon the rugged face of the rock, and myself all in <\p> 
<p> a tremble. <\p> 

<p> XXVII. MIDNIGHT <\p> 

<p> It could not have been far from midnight when I came beneath <\p> 
<p> Hollingsworth's window, and, finding it open, flung in a tuft of grass <\p> 
<p> with earth at the roots, and heard it fall upon the floor.  He was <\p> 
<p> either awake or sleeping very lightly; for scarcely a moment had gone <\p> 
<p> by before he looked out and discerned me standing in the moonlight. <\p> 

<p> "Is it you, Coverdale?" he asked.  "What is the matter?" <\p> 

<p> "Come down to me, Hollingsworth!"  I answered.  "I am anxious to speak <\p> 
<p> with you." <\p> 

<p> The strange tone of my own voice startled me, and him, probably, no <\p> 
<p> less.  He lost no time, and soon issued from the house-door, with his <\p> 
<p> dress half arranged. <\p> 

<p> "Again, what is the matter?" he asked impatiently. <\p> 

<p> "Have you seen Zenobia," said I, "since you parted from her at Eliot's <\p> 
<p> pulpit?" <\p> 

<p> "No," answered Hollingsworth; "nor did I expect it." <\p> 

<p> His voice was deep, but had a tremor in it, <\p> 

<p> Hardly had he spoken, when Silas Foster thrust his head, done up in a <\p> 
<p> cotton handkerchief, out of another window, and took what he called as <\p> 
<p> it literally was--a squint at us. <\p> 

<p> "Well, folks, what are ye about here?" he demanded.  "Aha! are you <\p> 
<p> there, Miles Coverdale?  You have been turning night into day since you <\p> 
<p> left us, I reckon; and so you find it quite natural to come prowling <\p> 
<p> about the house at this time o' night, frightening my old woman out of <\p> 
<p> her wits, and making her disturb a tired man out of his best nap.  In <\p> 
<p> with you, you vagabond, and to bed!" <\p> 

<p> "Dress yourself quickly, Foster," said I. "We want your assistance." <\p> 

<p> I could not, for the life of me, keep that strange tone out of my <\p> 
<p> voice.  Silas Foster, obtuse as were his sensibilities, seemed to feel <\p> 
<p> the ghastly earnestness that was conveyed in it as well as <\p> 
<p> Hollingsworth did.  He immediately withdrew his head, and I heard him <\p> 
<p> yawning, muttering to his wife, and again yawning heavily, while he <\p> 
<p> hurried on his clothes.  Meanwhile I showed Hollingsworth a delicate <\p> 
<p> handkerchief, marked with a well-known cipher, and told where I had <\p> 
<p> found it, and other circumstances, which had filled me with a suspicion <\p> 
<p> so terrible that I left him, if he dared, to shape it out for himself. <\p> 
<p> By the time my brief explanation was finished, we were joined by Silas <\p> 
<p> Foster in his blue woollen frock. <\p> 

<p> "Well, boys," cried he peevishly, "what is to pay now?" <\p> 

<p> "Tell him, Hollingsworth," said I. <\p> 

<p> Hollingsworth shivered perceptibly, and drew in a hard breath betwixt <\p> 
<p> his teeth.  He steadied himself, however, and, looking the matter more <\p> 
<p> firmly in the face than I had done, explained to Foster my suspicions, <\p> 
<p> and the grounds of them, with a distinctness from which, in spite of my <\p> 
<p> utmost efforts, my words had swerved aside.  The tough-nerved yeoman, <\p> 
<p> in his comment, put a finish on the business, and brought out the <\p> 
<p> hideous idea in its full terror, as if he were removing the napkin from <\p> 
<p> the face of a corpse. <\p> 

<p> "And so you think she's drowned herself?" he cried.  I turned away my <\p> 
<p> face. <\p> 

<p> "What on earth should the young woman do that for?" exclaimed Silas, <\p> 
<p> his eyes half out of his head with mere surprise.  "Why, she has more <\p> 
<p> means than she can use or waste, and lacks nothing to make her <\p> 
<p> comfortable, but a husband, and that's an article she could have, any <\p> 
<p> day.  There's some mistake about this, I tell you!" <\p> 

<p> "Come," said I, shuddering; "let us go and ascertain the truth." <\p> 

<p> "Well, well," answered Silas Foster; "just as you say.  We'll take the <\p> 
<p> long pole, with the hook at the end, that serves to get the bucket out <\p> 
<p> of the draw-well when the rope is broken.  With that, and a couple of <\p> 
<p> long-handled hay-rakes, I'll answer for finding her, if she's anywhere <\p> 
<p> to be found.  Strange enough!  Zenobia drown herself! No, no; I don't <\p> 
<p> believe it.  She had too much sense, and too much means, and enjoyed <\p> 
<p> life a great deal too well." <\p> 

<p> When our few preparations were completed, we hastened, by a shorter <\p> 
<p> than the customary route, through fields and pastures, and across a <\p> 
<p> portion of the meadow, to the particular spot on the river-bank which I <\p> 
<p> had paused to contemplate in the course of my afternoon's ramble. A <\p> 
<p> nameless presentiment had again drawn me thither, after leaving Eliot's <\p> 
<p> pulpit.  I showed my companions where I had found the handkerchief, and <\p> 
<p> pointed to two or three footsteps, impressed into the clayey margin, <\p> 
<p> and tending towards the water.  Beneath its shallow verge, among the <\p> 
<p> water-weeds, there were further traces, as yet unobliterated by the <\p> 
<p> sluggish current, which was there almost at a standstill.  Silas Foster <\p> 
<p> thrust his face down close to these footsteps, and picked up a shoe <\p> 
<p> that had escaped my observation, being half imbedded in the mud. <\p> 

<p> "There's a kid shoe that never was made on a Yankee last," observed he. <\p> 
<p> "I know enough of shoemaker's craft to tell that.  French manufacture; <\p> 
<p> and see what a high instep! and how evenly she trod in it!  There never <\p> 
<p> was a woman that stept handsomer in her shoes than Zenobia did.  Here," <\p> 
<p> he added, addressing Hollingsworth, "would you like to keep the shoe?" <\p> 

<p> Hollingsworth started back. <\p> 

<p> "Give it to me, Foster," said I. <\p> 

<p> I dabbled it in the water, to rinse off the mud, and have kept it ever <\p> 
<p> since.  Not far from this spot lay an old, leaky punt, drawn up on the <\p> 
<p> oozy river-side, and generally half full of water.  It served the <\p> 
<p> angler to go in quest of pickerel, or the sportsman to pick up his wild <\p> 
<p> ducks.  Setting this crazy bark afloat, I seated myself in the stern <\p> 
<p> with the paddle, while Hollingsworth sat in the bows with the hooked <\p> 
<p> pole, and Silas Foster amidships with a hay-rake. <\p> 

<p> "It puts me in mind of my young days," remarked Silas, "when I used to <\p> 
<p> steal out of bed to go bobbing for hornpouts and eels. <\p> 
<p> Heigh-ho!--well, life and death together make sad work for us all! <\p> 
<p> Then I was a boy, bobbing for fish; and now I am getting to be an old <\p> 
<p> fellow, and here I be, groping for a dead body!  I tell you what, lads; <\p> 
<p> if I thought anything had really happened to Zenobia, I should feel <\p> 
<p> kind o' sorrowful." <\p> 

<p> "I wish, at least, you would hold your tongue," muttered I. <\p> 

<p> The moon, that night, though past the full, was still large and oval, <\p> 
<p> and having risen between eight and nine o'clock, now shone aslantwise <\p> 
<p> over the river, throwing the high, opposite bank, with its woods, into <\p> 
<p> deep shadow, but lighting up the hither shore pretty effectually. Not a <\p> 
<p> ray appeared to fall on the river itself.  It lapsed imperceptibly <\p> 
<p> away, a broad, black, inscrutable depth, keeping its own secrets from <\p> 
<p> the eye of man, as impenetrably as mid-ocean could. <\p> 

<p> "Well, Miles Coverdale," said Foster, "you are the helmsman.  How do <\p> 
<p> you mean to manage this business?" <\p> 

<p> "I shall let the boat drift, broadside foremost, past that stump," I <\p> 
<p> replied.  "I know the bottom, having sounded it in fishing.  The shore, <\p> 
<p> on this side, after the first step or two, goes off very abruptly; and <\p> 
<p> there is a pool, just by the stump, twelve or fifteen feet deep.  The <\p> 
<p> current could not have force enough to sweep any sunken object, even if <\p> 
<p> partially buoyant, out of that hollow." <\p> 

<p> "Come, then," said Silas; "but I doubt whether I can touch bottom with <\p> 
<p> this hay-rake, if it's as deep as you say.  Mr. Hollingsworth, I think <\p> 
<p> you'll be the lucky man to-night, such luck as it is." <\p> 

<p> We floated past the stump.  Silas Foster plied his rake manfully, <\p> 
<p> poking it as far as he could into the water, and immersing the whole <\p> 
<p> length of his arm besides.  Hollingsworth at first sat motionless, with <\p> 
<p> the hooked pole elevated in the air.  But, by and by, with a nervous <\p> 
<p> and jerky movement, he began to plunge it into the blackness that <\p> 
<p> upbore us, setting his teeth, and making precisely such thrusts, <\p> 
<p> methought, as if he were stabbing at a deadly enemy.  I bent over the <\p> 
<p> side of the boat.  So obscure, however, so awfully mysterious, was that <\p> 
<p> dark stream, that--and the thought made me shiver like a leaf--I might <\p> 
<p> as well have tried to look into the enigma of the eternal world, to <\p> 
<p> discover what had become of Zenobia's soul, as into the river's depths, <\p> 
<p> to find her body.  And there, perhaps, she lay, with her face upward, <\p> 
<p> while the shadow of the boat, and my own pale face peering downward, <\p> 
<p> passed slowly betwixt her and the sky! <\p> 

<p> Once, twice, thrice, I paddled the boat upstream, and again suffered it <\p> 
<p> to glide, with the river's slow, funereal motion, downward.  Silas <\p> 
<p> Foster had raked up a large mass of stuff, which, as it came towards <\p> 
<p> the surface, looked somewhat like a flowing garment, but proved to be a <\p> 
<p> monstrous tuft of water-weeds.  Hollingsworth, with a gigantic effort, <\p> 
<p> upheaved a sunken log.  When once free of the bottom, it rose partly <\p> 
<p> out of water,--all weedy and slimy, a devilish-looking object, which <\p> 
<p> the moon had not shone upon for half a hundred years,--then plunged <\p> 
<p> again, and sullenly returned to its old resting-place, for the remnant <\p> 
<p> of the century. <\p> 

<p> "That looked ugly!" quoth Silas.  "I half thought it was the Evil One, <\p> 
<p> on the same errand as ourselves,--searching for Zenobia." <\p> 

<p> "He shall never get her," said I, giving the boat a strong impulse. <\p> 

<p> "That's not for you to say, my boy," retorted the yeoman.  "Pray God he <\p> 
<p> never has, and never may.  Slow work this, however!  I should really be <\p> 
<p> glad to find something!  Pshaw!  What a notion that is, when the only <\p> 
<p> good luck would be to paddle, and drift, and poke, and grope, <\p> 
<p> hereabouts, till morning, and have our labor for our pains! For my <\p> 
<p> part, I shouldn't wonder if the creature had only lost her shoe in the <\p> 
<p> mud, and saved her soul alive, after all.  My stars! how she will laugh <\p> 
<p> at us, to-morrow morning!" <\p> 

<p> It is indescribable what an image of Zenobia--at the breakfast-table, <\p> 
<p> full of warm and mirthful life--this surmise of Silas Foster's brought <\p> 
<p> before my mind.  The terrible phantasm of her death was thrown by it <\p> 
<p> into the remotest and dimmest background, where it seemed to grow as <\p> 
<p> improbable as a myth. <\p> 

<p> "Yes, Silas, it may be as you say," cried I. The drift of the stream <\p> 
<p> had again borne us a little below the stump, when I felt--yes, felt, <\p> 
<p> for it was as if the iron hook had smote my breast--felt <\p> 
<p> Hollingsworth's pole strike some object at the bottom of the river! <\p> 

<p> He started up, and almost overset the boat. <\p> 

<p> "Hold on!" cried Foster; "you have her!" <\p> 

<p> Putting a fury of strength into the effort, Hollingsworth heaved amain, <\p> 
<p> and up came a white swash to the surface of the river.  It was the flow <\p> 
<p> of a woman's garments.  A little higher, and we saw her dark hair <\p> 
<p> streaming down the current.  Black River of Death, thou hadst yielded <\p> 
<p> up thy victim!  Zenobia was found! <\p> 

<p> Silas Foster laid hold of the body; Hollingsworth likewise grappled <\p> 
<p> with it; and I steered towards the bank, gazing all the while at <\p> 
<p> Zenobia, whose limbs were swaying in the current close at the boat's <\p> 
<p> side.  Arriving near the shore, we all three stept into the water, bore <\p> 
<p> her out, and laid her on the ground beneath a tree. <\p> 

<p> "Poor child!" said Foster,--and his dry old heart, I verily believe, <\p> 
<p> vouchsafed a tear, "I'm sorry for her!" <\p> 

<p> Were I to describe the perfect horror of the spectacle, the reader <\p> 
<p> might justly reckon it to me for a sin and shame.  For more than twelve <\p> 
<p> long years I have borne it in my memory, and could now reproduce it as <\p> 
<p> freshly as if it were still before my eyes.  Of all modes of death, <\p> 
<p> methinks it is the ugliest.  Her wet garments swathed limbs of terrible <\p> 
<p> inflexibility.  She was the marble image of a death-agony.  Her arms <\p> 
<p> had grown rigid in the act of struggling, and were bent before her with <\p> 
<p> clenched hands; her knees, too, were bent, and--thank God for it!--in <\p> 
<p> the attitude of prayer.  Ah, that rigidity! It is impossible to bear <\p> 
<p> the terror of it.  It seemed,--I must needs impart so much of my own <\p> 
<p> miserable idea,--it seemed as if her body must keep the same position <\p> 
<p> in the coffin, and that her skeleton would keep it in the grave; and <\p> 
<p> that when Zenobia rose at the day of judgment, it would be in just the <\p> 
<p> same attitude as now! <\p> 

<p> One hope I had, and that too was mingled half with fear.  She knelt as <\p> 
<p> if in prayer.  With the last, choking consciousness, her soul, bubbling <\p> 
<p> out through her lips, it may be, had given itself up to the Father, <\p> 
<p> reconciled and penitent.  But her arms!  They were bent before her, as <\p> 
<p> if she struggled against Providence in never-ending hostility.  Her <\p> 
<p> hands!  They were clenched in immitigable defiance. Away with the <\p> 
<p> hideous thought.  The flitting moment after Zenobia sank into the dark <\p> 
<p> pool--when her breath was gone, and her soul at her lips was as long, <\p> 
<p> in its capacity of God's infinite forgiveness, as the lifetime of the <\p> 
<p> world! <\p> 

<p> Foster bent over the body, and carefully examined it. <\p> 

<p> "You have wounded the poor thing's breast," said he to Hollingsworth, <\p> 
<p> "close by her heart, too!" <\p> 

<p> "Ha!" cried Hollingsworth with a start. <\p> 

<p> And so he had, indeed, both before and after death! <\p> 

<p> "See!" said Foster.  "That's the place where the iron struck her.  It <\p> 
<p> looks cruelly, but she never felt it!" <\p> 

<p> He endeavored to arrange the arms of the corpse decently by its side. <\p> 
<p> His utmost strength, however, scarcely sufficed to bring them down; and <\p> 
<p> rising again, the next instant, they bade him defiance, exactly as <\p> 
<p> before.  He made another effort, with the same result. <\p> 

<p> "In God's name, Silas Foster," cried I with bitter indignation, "let <\p> 
<p> that dead woman alone!" <\p> 

<p> "Why, man, it's not decent!" answered he, staring at me in amazement. <\p> 
<p> "I can't bear to see her looking so!  Well, well," added he, after a <\p> 
<p> third effort, "'tis of no use, sure enough; and we must leave the women <\p> 
<p> to do their best with her, after we get to the house.  The sooner <\p> 
<p> that's done, the better." <\p> 

<p> We took two rails from a neighboring fence, and formed a bier by laying <\p> 
<p> across some boards from the bottom of the boat.  And thus we bore <\p> 
<p> Zenobia homeward.  Six hours before, how beautiful!  At midnight, what <\p> 
<p> a horror!  A reflection occurs to me that will show ludicrously, I <\p> 
<p> doubt not, on my page, but must come in for its sterling truth. Being <\p> 
<p> the woman that she was, could Zenobia have foreseen all these ugly <\p> 
<p> circumstances of death,--how ill it would become her, the altogether <\p> 
<p> unseemly aspect which she must put on, and especially old Silas <\p> 
<p> Foster's efforts to improve the matter,--she would no more have <\p> 
<p> committed the dreadful act than have exhibited herself to a public <\p> 
<p> assembly in a badly fitting garment!  Zenobia, I have often thought, <\p> 
<p> was not quite simple in her death.  She had seen pictures, I suppose, <\p> 
<p> of drowned persons in lithe and graceful attitudes.  And she deemed it <\p> 
<p> well and decorous to die as so many village maidens have, wronged in <\p> 
<p> their first love, and seeking peace in the bosom of the old familiar <\p> 
<p> stream,--so familiar that they could not dread it,--where, in <\p> 
<p> childhood, they used to bathe their little feet, wading mid-leg deep, <\p> 
<p> unmindful of wet skirts.  But in Zenobia's case there was some tint of <\p> 
<p> the Arcadian affectation that had been visible enough in all our lives <\p> 
<p> for a few months past. <\p> 

<p> This, however, to my conception, takes nothing from the tragedy.  For, <\p> 
<p> has not the world come to an awfully sophisticated pass, when, after a <\p> 
<p> certain degree of acquaintance with it, we cannot even put ourselves to <\p> 
<p> death in whole-hearted simplicity?  Slowly, slowly, with many a dreary <\p> 
<p> pause,--resting the bier often on some rock or balancing it across a <\p> 
<p> mossy log, to take fresh hold,--we bore our burden onward through the <\p> 
<p> moonlight, and at last laid Zenobia on the floor of the old farmhouse. <\p> 
<p> By and by came three or four withered women and stood whispering around <\p> 
<p> the corpse, peering at it through their spectacles, holding up their <\p> 
<p> skinny hands, shaking their night-capped heads, and taking counsel of <\p> 
<p> one another's experience what was to be done. <\p> 

<p> With those tire-women we left Zenobia. <\p> 

<p> XXVIII. BLITHEDALE PASTURE <\p> 

<p> Blithedale, thus far in its progress, had never found the necessity of <\p> 
<p> a burial-ground.  There was some consultation among us in what spot <\p> 
<p> Zenobia might most fitly be laid.  It was my own wish that she should <\p> 
<p> sleep at the base of Eliot's pulpit, and that on the rugged front of <\p> 
<p> the rock the name by which we familiarly knew her, Zenobia,--and not <\p> 
<p> another word, should be deeply cut, and left for the moss and lichens <\p> 
<p> to fill up at their long leisure.  But Hollingsworth (to whose ideas on <\p> 
<p> this point great deference was due) made it his request that her grave <\p> 
<p> might be dug on the gently sloping hillside, in the wide pasture, <\p> 
<p> where, as we once supposed, Zenobia and he had planned to build their <\p> 
<p> cottage.  And thus it was done, accordingly. <\p> 

<p> She was buried very much as other people have been for hundreds of <\p> 
<p> years gone by.  In anticipation of a death, we Blithedale colonists had <\p> 
<p> sometimes set our fancies at work to arrange a funereal ceremony, which <\p> 
<p> should be the proper symbolic expression of our spiritual faith and <\p> 
<p> eternal hopes; and this we meant to substitute for those customary <\p> 
<p> rites which were moulded originally out of the Gothic gloom, and by <\p> 
<p> long use, like an old velvet pall, have so much more than their first <\p> 
<p> death-smell in them.  But when the occasion came we found it the <\p> 
<p> simplest and truest thing, after all, to content ourselves with the old <\p> 
<p> fashion, taking away what we could, but interpolating no novelties, and <\p> 
<p> particularly avoiding all frippery of flowers and cheerful emblems. <\p> 
<p> The procession moved from the farmhouse.  Nearest the dead walked an <\p> 
<p> old man in deep mourning, his face mostly concealed in a white <\p> 
<p> handkerchief, and with Priscilla leaning on his arm.  Hollingsworth and <\p> 
<p> myself came next.  We all stood around the narrow niche in the cold <\p> 
<p> earth; all saw the coffin lowered in; all heard the rattle of the <\p> 
<p> crumbly soil upon its lid,--that final sound, which mortality awakens <\p> 
<p> on the utmost verge of sense, as if in the vain hope of bringing an <\p> 
<p> echo from the spiritual world. <\p> 

<p> I noticed a stranger,--a stranger to most of those present, though <\p> 
<p> known to me,--who, after the coffin had descended, took up a handful of <\p> 
<p> earth and flung it first into the grave.  I had given up <\p> 
<p> Hollingsworth's arm, and now found myself near this man. <\p> 

<p> "It was an idle thing--a foolish thing--for Zenobia to do," said he. <\p> 
<p> "She was the last woman in the world to whom death could have been <\p> 
<p> necessary.  It was too absurd!  I have no patience with her." <\p> 

<p> "Why so?"  I inquired, smothering my horror at his cold comment, in my <\p> 
<p> eager curiosity to discover some tangible truth as to his relation with <\p> 
<p> Zenobia.  "If any crisis could justify the sad wrong she offered to <\p> 
<p> herself, it was surely that in which she stood.  Everything had failed <\p> 
<p> her; prosperity in the world's sense, for her opulence was gone,--the <\p> 
<p> heart's prosperity, in love.  And there was a secret burden on her, the <\p> 
<p> nature of which is best known to you.  Young as she was, she had tried <\p> 
<p> life fully, had no more to hope, and something, perhaps, to fear.  Had <\p> 
<p> Providence taken her away in its own holy hand, I should have thought <\p> 
<p> it the kindest dispensation that could be awarded to one so wrecked." <\p> 

<p> "You mistake the matter completely," rejoined Westervelt. <\p> 

<p> "What, then, is your own view of it?"  I asked. <\p> 

<p> "Her mind was active, and various in its powers," said he.  "Her heart <\p> 
<p> had a manifold adaptation; her constitution an infinite buoyancy, which <\p> 
<p> (had she possessed only a little patience to await the reflux of her <\p> 
<p> troubles) would have borne her upward triumphantly for twenty years to <\p> 
<p> come.  Her beauty would not have waned--or scarcely so, and surely not <\p> 
<p> beyond the reach of art to restore it--in all that time.  She had <\p> 
<p> life's summer all before her, and a hundred varieties of brilliant <\p> 
<p> success.  What an actress Zenobia might have been!  It was one of her <\p> 
<p> least valuable capabilities.  How forcibly she might have wrought upon <\p> 
<p> the world, either directly in her own person, or by her influence upon <\p> 
<p> some man, or a series of men, of controlling genius!  Every prize that <\p> 
<p> could be worth a woman's having--and many prizes which other women are <\p> 
<p> too timid to desire--lay within Zenobia's reach." <\p> 

<p> "In all this," I observed, "there would have been nothing to satisfy <\p> 
<p> her heart." <\p> 

<p> "Her heart!" answered Westervelt contemptuously.  "That troublesome <\p> 
<p> organ (as she had hitherto found it) would have been kept in its due <\p> 
<p> place and degree, and have had all the gratification it could fairly <\p> 
<p> claim.  She would soon have established a control over it.  Love had <\p> 
<p> failed her, you say.  Had it never failed her before?  Yet she survived <\p> 
<p> it, and loved again,--possibly not once alone, nor twice either.  And <\p> 
<p> now to drown herself for yonder dreamy philanthropist!" <\p> 

<p> "Who are you," I exclaimed indignantly, "that dare to speak thus of the <\p> 
<p> dead?  You seem to intend a eulogy, yet leave out whatever was noblest <\p> 
<p> in her, and blacken while you mean to praise.  I have long considered <\p> 
<p> you as Zenobia's evil fate.  Your sentiments confirm me in the idea, <\p> 
<p> but leave me still ignorant as to the mode in which you have influenced <\p> 
<p> her life.  The connection may have been indissoluble, except by death. <\p> 
<p> Then, indeed,--always in the hope of God's infinite mercy,--I cannot <\p> 
<p> deem it a misfortune that she sleeps in yonder grave!" <\p> 

<p> "No matter what I was to her," he answered gloomily, yet without actual <\p> 
<p> emotion.  "She is now beyond my reach.  Had she lived, and hearkened to <\p> 
<p> my counsels, we might have served each other well.  But there Zenobia <\p> 
<p> lies in yonder pit, with the dull earth over her. Twenty years of a <\p> 
<p> brilliant lifetime thrown away for a mere woman's whim!" <\p> 

<p> Heaven deal with Westervelt according to his nature and deserts!--that <\p> 
<p> is to say, annihilate him.  He was altogether earthy, worldly, made for <\p> 
<p> time and its gross objects, and incapable--except by a sort of dim <\p> 
<p> reflection caught from other minds--of so much as one spiritual idea. <\p> 
<p> Whatever stain Zenobia had was caught from him; nor does it seldom <\p> 
<p> happen that a character of admirable qualities loses its better life <\p> 
<p> because the atmosphere that should sustain it is rendered poisonous by <\p> 
<p> such breath as this man mingled with Zenobia's. Yet his reflections <\p> 
<p> possessed their share of truth.  It was a woeful thought, that a woman <\p> 
<p> of Zenobia's diversified capacity should have fancied herself <\p> 
<p> irretrievably defeated on the broad battlefield of life, and with no <\p> 
<p> refuge, save to fall on her own sword, merely because Love had gone <\p> 
<p> against her.  It is nonsense, and a miserable wrong,--the result, like <\p> 
<p> so many others, of masculine egotism,--that the success or failure of <\p> 
<p> woman's existence should be made to depend wholly on the affections, <\p> 
<p> and on one species of affection, while man has such a multitude of <\p> 
<p> other chances, that this seems but an incident.  For its own sake, if <\p> 
<p> it will do no more, the world should throw open all its avenues to the <\p> 
<p> passport of a woman's bleeding heart. <\p> 

<p> As we stood around the grave, I looked often towards Priscilla, <\p> 
<p> dreading to see her wholly overcome with grief.  And deeply grieved, in <\p> 
<p> truth, she was.  But a character so simply constituted as hers has room <\p> 
<p> only for a single predominant affection.  No other feeling can touch <\p> 
<p> the heart's inmost core, nor do it any deadly mischief.  Thus, while we <\p> 
<p> see that such a being responds to every breeze with tremulous <\p> 
<p> vibration, and imagine that she must be shattered by the first rude <\p> 
<p> blast, we find her retaining her equilibrium amid shocks that might <\p> 
<p> have overthrown many a sturdier frame.  So with Priscilla; her one <\p> 
<p> possible misfortune was Hollingsworth's unkindness; and that was <\p> 
<p> destined never to befall her, never yet, at least, for Priscilla has <\p> 
<p> not died. <\p> 

<p> But Hollingsworth!  After all the evil that he did, are we to leave him <\p> 
<p> thus, blest with the entire devotion of this one true heart, and with <\p> 
<p> wealth at his disposal to execute the long-contemplated project that <\p> 
<p> had led him so far astray?  What retribution is there here?  My mind <\p> 
<p> being vexed with precisely this query, I made a journey, some years <\p> 
<p> since, for the sole purpose of catching a last glimpse of <\p> 
<p> Hollingsworth, and judging for myself whether he were a happy man or <\p> 
<p> no.  I learned that he inhabited a small cottage, that his way of life <\p> 
<p> was exceedingly retired, and that my only chance of encountering him or <\p> 
<p> Priscilla was to meet them in a secluded lane, where, in the latter <\p> 
<p> part of the afternoon, they were accustomed to walk.  I did meet them, <\p> 
<p> accordingly.  As they approached me, I observed in Hollingsworth's face <\p> 
<p> a depressed and melancholy look, that seemed habitual; the powerfully <\p> 
<p> built man showed a self-distrustful weakness, and a childlike or <\p> 
<p> childish tendency to press close, and closer still, to the side of the <\p> 
<p> slender woman whose arm was within his.  In Priscilla's manner there <\p> 
<p> was a protective and watchful quality, as if she felt herself the <\p> 
<p> guardian of her companion; but, likewise, a deep, submissive, <\p> 
<p> unquestioning reverence, and also a veiled happiness in her fair and <\p> 
<p> quiet countenance. <\p> 

<p> Drawing nearer, Priscilla recognized me, and gave me a kind and <\p> 
<p> friendly smile, but with a slight gesture, which I could not help <\p> 
<p> interpreting as an entreaty not to make myself known to Hollingsworth. <\p> 
<p> Nevertheless, an impulse took possession of me, and compelled me to <\p> 
<p> address him. <\p> 

<p> "I have come, Hollingsworth," said I, "to view your grand edifice for <\p> 
<p> the reformation of criminals.  Is it finished yet?" <\p> 

<p> "No, nor begun," answered he, without raising his eyes.  "A very small <\p> 
<p> one answers all my purposes." <\p> 

<p> Priscilla threw me an upbraiding glance.  But I spoke again, with a <\p> 
<p> bitter and revengeful emotion, as if flinging a poisoned arrow at <\p> 
<p> Hollingsworth's heart. <\p> 

<p> "Up to this moment," I inquired, "how many criminals have you reformed?" <\p> 

<p> "Not one," said Hollingsworth, with his eyes still fixed on the ground. <\p> 
<p> "Ever since we parted, I have been busy with a single murderer." <\p> 

<p> Then the tears gushed into my eyes, and I forgave him; for I remembered <\p> 
<p> the wild energy, the passionate shriek, with which Zenobia had spoken <\p> 
<p> those words, "Tell him he has murdered me!  Tell him that I'll haunt <\p> 
<p> him!"--and I knew what murderer he meant, and whose vindictive shadow <\p> 
<p> dogged the side where Priscilla was not. <\p> 

<p> The moral which presents itself to my reflections, as drawn from <\p> 
<p> Hollingsworth's character and errors, is simply this, that, admitting <\p> 
<p> what is called philanthropy, when adopted as a profession, to be often <\p> 
<p> useful by its energetic impulse to society at large, it is perilous to <\p> 
<p> the individual whose ruling passion, in one exclusive channel, it thus <\p> 
<p> becomes.  It ruins, or is fearfully apt to ruin, the heart, the rich <\p> 
<p> juices of which God never meant should be pressed violently out and <\p> 
<p> distilled into alcoholic liquor by an unnatural process, but should <\p> 
<p> render life sweet, bland, and gently beneficent, and insensibly <\p> 
<p> influence other hearts and other lives to the same blessed end.  I see <\p> 
<p> in Hollingsworth an exemplification of the most awful truth in Bunyan's <\p> 
<p> book of such, from the very gate of heaven there is a by-way to the pit! <\p> 

<p> But, all this while, we have been standing by Zenobia's grave.  I have <\p> 
<p> never since beheld it, but make no question that the grass grew all the <\p> 
<p> better, on that little parallelogram of pasture land, for the decay of <\p> 
<p> the beautiful woman who slept beneath.  How Nature seems to love us! <\p> 
<p> And how readily, nevertheless, without a sigh or a complaint, she <\p> 
<p> converts us to a meaner purpose, when her highest one--that of a <\p> 
<p> conscious intellectual life and sensibility has been untimely balked! <\p> 
<p> While Zenobia lived, Nature was proud of her, and directed all eyes <\p> 
<p> upon that radiant presence, as her fairest handiwork.  Zenobia <\p> 
<p> perished.  Will not Nature shed a tear?  Ah, no!--she adopts the <\p> 
<p> calamity at once into her system, and is just as well pleased, for <\p> 
<p> aught we can see, with the tuft of ranker vegetation that grew out of <\p> 
<p> Zenobia's heart, as with all the beauty which has bequeathed us no <\p> 
<p> earthly representative except in this crop of weeds.  It is because the <\p> 
<p> spirit is inestimable that the lifeless body is so little valued. <\p> 

<p> XXIX. MILES COVERDALE'S CONFESSION <\p> 

<p> It remains only to say a few words about myself.  Not improbably, the <\p> 
<p> reader might be willing to spare me the trouble; for I have made but a <\p> 
<p> poor and dim figure in my own narrative, establishing no separate <\p> 
<p> interest, and suffering my colorless life to take its hue from other <\p> 
<p> lives.  But one still retains some little consideration for one's self; <\p> 
<p> so I keep these last two or three pages for my individual and sole <\p> 
<p> behoof. <\p> 

<p> But what, after all, have I to tell?  Nothing, nothing, nothing!  I <\p> 
<p> left Blithedale within the week after Zenobia's death, and went back <\p> 
<p> thither no more.  The whole soil of our farm, for a long time <\p> 
<p> afterwards, seemed but the sodded earth over her grave.  I could not <\p> 
<p> toil there, nor live upon its products.  Often, however, in these years <\p> 
<p> that are darkening around me, I remember our beautiful scheme of a <\p> 
<p> noble and unselfish life; and how fair, in that first summer, appeared <\p> 
<p> the prospect that it might endure for generations, and be perfected, as <\p> 
<p> the ages rolled away, into the system of a people and a world!  Were my <\p> 
<p> former associates now there,--were there only three or four of those <\p> 
<p> true-hearted men still laboring in the sun,--I sometimes fancy that I <\p> 
<p> should direct my world-weary footsteps thitherward, and entreat them to <\p> 
<p> receive me, for old friendship's sake.  More and more I feel that we <\p> 
<p> had struck upon what ought to be a truth.  Posterity may dig it up, and <\p> 
<p> profit by it.  The experiment, so far as its original projectors were <\p> 
<p> concerned, proved, long ago, a failure; first lapsing into Fourierism, <\p> 
<p> and dying, as it well deserved, for this infidelity to its own higher <\p> 
<p> spirit.  Where once we toiled with our whole hopeful hearts, the town <\p> 
<p> paupers, aged, nerveless, and disconsolate, creep sluggishly afield. <\p> 
<p> Alas, what faith is requisite to bear up against such results of <\p> 
<p> generous effort! <\p> 

<p> My subsequent life has passed,--I was going to say happily, but, at all <\p> 
<p> events, tolerably enough.  I am now at middle age, well, well, a step <\p> 
<p> or two beyond the midmost point, and I care not a fig who knows it!--a <\p> 
<p> bachelor, with no very decided purpose of ever being otherwise. I have <\p> 
<p> been twice to Europe, and spent a year or two rather agreeably at each <\p> 
<p> visit.  Being well to do in the world, and having nobody but myself to <\p> 
<p> care for, I live very much at my ease, and fare sumptuously every day. <\p> 
<p> As for poetry, I have given it up, notwithstanding that Dr. <\p> 
<p> Griswold--as the reader, of course, knows--has placed me at a fair <\p> 
<p> elevation among our minor minstrelsy, on the strength of my pretty <\p> 
<p> little volume, published ten years ago. As regards human progress (in <\p> 
<p> spite of my irrepressible yearnings over the Blithedale reminiscences), <\p> 
<p> let them believe in it who can, and aid in it who choose.  If I could <\p> 
<p> earnestly do either, it might be all the better for my comfort.  As <\p> 
<p> Hollingsworth once told me, I lack a purpose.  How strange!  He was <\p> 
<p> ruined, morally, by an overplus of the very same ingredient, the want <\p> 
<p> of which, I occasionally suspect, has rendered my own life all an <\p> 
<p> emptiness.  I by no means wish to die.  Yet, were there any cause, in <\p> 
<p> this whole chaos of human struggle, worth a sane man's dying for, and <\p> 
<p> which my death would benefit, then--provided, however, the effort did <\p> 
<p> not involve an unreasonable amount of trouble--methinks I might be bold <\p> 
<p> to offer up my life.  If Kossuth, for example, would pitch the <\p> 
<p> battlefield of Hungarian rights within an easy ride of my abode, and <\p> 
<p> choose a mild, sunny morning, after breakfast, for the conflict, Miles <\p> 
<p> Coverdale would gladly be his man, for one brave rush upon the levelled <\p> 
<p> bayonets.  Further than that, I should be loath to pledge myself. <\p> 

<p> I exaggerate my own defects.  The reader must not take my own word for <\p> 
<p> it, nor believe me altogether changed from the young man who once hoped <\p> 
<p> strenuously, and struggled not so much amiss.  Frostier heads than mine <\p> 
<p> have gained honor in the world; frostier hearts have imbibed new <\p> 
<p> warmth, and been newly happy.  Life, however, it must be owned, has <\p> 
<p> come to rather an idle pass with me.  Would my friends like to know <\p> 
<p> what brought it thither?  There is one secret,--I have concealed it all <\p> 
<p> along, and never meant to let the least whisper of it escape,--one <\p> 
<p> foolish little secret, which possibly may have had something to do with <\p> 
<p> these inactive years of meridian manhood, with my bachelorship, with <\p> 
<p> the unsatisfied retrospect that I fling back on life, and my listless <\p> 
<p> glance towards the future.  Shall I reveal it? It is an absurd thing <\p> 
<p> for a man in his afternoon,--a man of the world, moreover, with these <\p> 
<p> three white hairs in his brown mustache and that deepening track of a <\p> 
<p> crow's-foot on each temple,--an absurd thing ever to have happened, and <\p> 
<p> quite the absurdest for an old bachelor, like me, to talk about.  But <\p> 
<p> it rises to my throat; so let it come. <\p> 

<p> I perceive, moreover, that the confession, brief as it shall be, will <\p> 
<p> throw a gleam of light over my behavior throughout the foregoing <\p> 
<p> incidents, and is, indeed, essential to the full understanding of my <\p> 
<p> story.  The reader, therefore, since I have disclosed so much, is <\p> 
<p> entitled to this one word more.  As I write it, he will charitably <\p> 
<p> suppose me to blush, and turn away my face: <\p> 

<p> I--I myself--was in love--with--Priscilla! <\p>

<p> 1.F. <\p> 

<p> 1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable <\p> 
<p> effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread <\p>

<p> "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or <\p> 
<p> corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual <\p>

<p> Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all <\p> 
<p> liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal <\p> 
<p> fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT <\p> 
<p> LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE <\p>

<p> TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE <\p> 
<p> LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR <\p> 
<p> INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH <\p> 
<p> DAMAGE. <\p> 

<p> 1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a <\p> 
<p> defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can <\p>

<p> received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with <\p> 
<p> your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with <\p> 
<p> the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a <\p>

<p> warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages. <\p> 
<p> If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the <\p> 
<p> law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be <\p> 
<p> interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by <\p> 
<p> the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any <\p> 
<p> provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions. <\p> 

<p> 1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the <\p> 
<p> trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone <\p>

<p> promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works, <\p> 
<p> harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees, <\p> 
<p> that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do <\p> 
<p> or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm <\p> 
<p> work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any <\p> 
<p> Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause. <\p> 
<p> Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm <\p> 

<p> Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of <\p> 
<p> electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers <\p> 
<p> including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists <\p> 
<p> because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from <\p> 
<p> people in all walks of life. <\p> 

<p> Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the <\p> 
<p> assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's <\p> 
<p> goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will <\p> 
<p> remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project <\p> 
<p> Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure <\p> 
<p> and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations. <\p> 
<p> To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation <\p> 
<p> and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 <\p> 
<p> and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org. <\p>

<p> state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal <\p>

<p> Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg <\p> 
<p> Literary Archive Foundation <\p> 

<p> Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide <\p> 
<p> spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of <\p> 
<p> increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be <\p> 
<p> freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest <\p> 
<p> array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations <\p> 
<p> ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt <\p> 
<p> status with the IRS. <\p> 

<p> The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating <\p> 
<p> charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United <\p> 
<p> States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a <\p> 
<p> considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up <\p> 
<p> with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations <\p> 
<p> where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To <\p> 
<p> SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any <\p> 
<p> particular state visit http://pglaf.org <\p> 

<p> While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we <\p> 
<p> have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition <\p> 
<p> against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who <\p> 
<p> approach us with offers to donate. <\p> 

<p> International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make <\p> 
<p> any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from <\p> 
<p> outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff. <\p> 

<p> Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation <\p> 
<p> methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other <\p> 
<p> ways including including checks, online payments and credit card <\p> 
<p> donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate <\p> 
<p> Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic <\p> 
<p> works. <\p> 

<p> Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm <\p> 
<p> concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared <\p> 
<p> with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project <\p> 
<p> Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support. <\p> 
<p> Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed <\p> 
<p> editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. <\p> 
<p> unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily <\p> 
<p> keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition. <\p> 
<p> Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility: <\p> 
<p>     http://www.gutenberg.net <\p> 

<p> This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm, <\p> 
<p> including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary <\p> 
<p> Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to <\p> 
<p> subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks. <\p>
