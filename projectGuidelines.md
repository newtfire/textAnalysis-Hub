## Guidelines for Semester Projects in DIGIT 210

* Projects must explore a research question (or a cluster or related research questions) about a collection of texts
     * Articulate those research question(s) on your GitHub repo and your project website.
     * A key aspect of each project is curation,cleaning, and maintaining a document collection for analysis.
     * Projects will involve working with texts in multiple formats, from so-called "plain" text to markup structures.
     * Research methods involve a combination of document analysis, structured markup, and natural language processing over structures and semi-structured text.

* Projects will have a public-facing web presence via the project GitHub repo.
     * Project sites must acknowledge, document, and link to the sources of their documents a
     * Projects may prepare their own reading views of their curated texts when these are in the public domain or not protected by copyright.
     
* Project sites must visualize and discuss their document data.
     * All visualizations must be accompanied by a legend and by discussion (in paragraphs) of their significance
     * Projects must contain reflection on the research questions, to what extent they were answered, and what questions cannot fully be resolved.
     
* Projects must credit and acknowledge the distinct work of each team member.
* See the Newtfire website guidelines for projects for [details on website expectations](https://newtfire.org/courses/tutorials/projectGuide.html).
