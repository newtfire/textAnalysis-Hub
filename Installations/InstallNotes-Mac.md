# Preliminary Installations & Suggestions

### Installing Homebrew

<img src="homebrew.png" alt="homebrew logo" width="500"/>

Homebrew is a package manager that helps you install things on your Mac quickly in your Terminal. We'll use it for installing OpenJDK Java, but it's a great tool to have in your toolbag for other future installations. You can [view their website](https://brew.sh) for full instructions and nerdy stuff, but we have the instructions here:
	
* **Open a new terminal window, and in your "home" directory, run this line from their website:**
	
	```shell 
	/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
	```  

* **You'll be asked to enter your password.** This means the local password you use to login to your computer. *The password will not appear as you type it. This is a security feature.*

	* You *might* receive an error for sudo (**s**ubstitude **u**ser **do**)
		* To fix this error, take the download code line for homebrew and add `sudo ` before it: 

		```shell
		sudo /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
		``` 
	
	* After running this line, you will be asked to enter your password.
	* Once you enter your password, the terminal will the state `Checking for sudo access (which may request your password)... Don't run this as root!`
	* After receiving this error, repaste the orginal homebrew install line:
	
		```shell
		/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
		``` 

* Then, carefully follow the instructions that appear in the terminal window.

	* If you're prompted to accept "Y" or "N" (Yes or No) questions, enter "Y" to continue installing.
	
* Your terminal will run many lines to install homebrew. **After the process is complete, the terminal should say something like this**:

	```shell
	...
	==> Next steps:
	- Run these commands in your terminal to add Homebrew to your PATH:
		echo >> /Users/eeb4/.zprofile
		echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> /Users/eeb4/.zprofile
		eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
	- Run brew help to get started
	- Further documentation:
		https://docs.brew.sh
	```

* You will need to run those three commands to be able to use Homebrew. Be cautious: run each line separately, and if you're copying them from here, replace the "eeb4" portion of each command with your username so it uses your specific filepath to your "home" and system dot-files. **You may also simply copy and run them from within your terminal where the filepaths are automatically correct for your system.**

    * 1st command: 
    
		```shell
		echo >> /Users/eeb4/.zprofile
		```
	    
    * 2nd command:
    	
		```shell
		echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> /Users/eeb4/.zprofile
		```
    	
    * 3rd command:

		```shell
		eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
		```

* You should now have successfully installed Homebrew!

### Installing JDK

You will need the Java Development Kit (OpenJDK) java environment installed:

* Check to see if you already have OpenJDK installed:

	```shell
	java -version
	```
 
     * NOTE: if you have Oracle Java and need to uninstall it, follow these instructions: <https://www.java.com/en/download/help/mac_uninstall_java.html>

* If you don't have it already, we'll [install the latest OpenJDK with Homebrew](<https://ansidev.xyz/posts/2023-07-11-how-to-install-openjdk-on-macos>):
	* To install OpenJDK on your computer, you must have [Homebrew installed first](#installing-homebrew). Install the current stable OpenJDK with: 
	
		```shell
		brew install openjdk
		```
		
	* To finish the installation, you'll need to run the line they give you in the success dialog (this adds a necessary line to your `.zshrc` file):

		```shell
		echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/openjdk/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
		```
	
* Now, you'll need to restart your terminal to be able to successfully run the java version check again:

	```shell
	java -version
	```

### Suggestions

* There are a lot of installations throughout this process. To keep them organized, *it is a good idea to place them all in your GitHub directory since you should be familiar with that directory at this point.*

* To make things simpler for yourself, use the same alias names that I use in this tutorial, so when we're working on this in class, there's no confusion if your alias has a different name than mine.

* We also suggest you install 3 more helpful command line tools via Homebrew:

	```shell
 	brew install bat
 	```

	```shell
 	brew install xmlstarlet
 	``` 

	*(macOS only)*
  
	```shell
 	brew install xq
 	```
 
*********************

# XProc Processors

## Calabash

This is an XProc processor that you can use with the ixml processor [**CoffeePot**](#coffeepot) that's good for simple grammars and input files that aren't super large.

### Installing Calabash

* Visit the [xmlcalabash github repo](https://github.com/xmlcalabash/xmlcalabash3/releases) and look for the latest release (**alpha20 is the latest release as of 17 February 2025**).
* Download the xmlcalabash zip directory (`xmlcalabash-3.0.0-alpha20.zip`)
* Unzip this directory and place the unzipped folder it your GitHub directory.
* Open your terminal and navigate to your new xmlcalabash folder:

	```shell
 	cd /Documents/GitHub/xmlcalabash-3.0.0-alpha20
 	```
 
* Test if your Java installation works **(ADAPT THIS LINE TO APPLY TO YOUR VERSION NUMBER OF XMLCALABASH AS NEEDED!)**:
	
	```shell
	java -jar xmlcalabash-app-3.0.0-alpha20.jar help
	```
* If successful, this 'help' shell command will show you all the different xmlcalabash commands available.

### Graphviz

* **Test if you have Graphviz installed** by entering this in your terminal: 

	```shell
	dot -V
	```
	
* If this returns an error, you will need to install Graphviz.
* **In your "home" directory, paste and run this command:**

	```shell
	brew install graphviz
 	```

* Now, run the first command again to verify the installation worked:

	```shell
	dot -V
	```

### CoffeeSacks

*(This is needed for Calabash)*

* Pick up CoffeeSacks from the versioned releases on the repo, here: https://github.com/nineml/coffeesacks/releases and find the latest one to download.
* Copy the **CoffeeSacks jar** file into your XML Calabash `extra/` subdirectory.

### Configuring Calabash

***Making the .xmlcalabash3 dot-file:***
 
* Navigate to your "home" directory (which is where you set up your .zshrc file and establish your aliases and environment variables and such like). In this location we'll be storing a dot-file which will help Calabash to run.
    * NOTE: We will NOT be using Saxon EE at all.
    * We need to know where Homebrew installed graphviz. Double-check by navigating to see if Homebrew installed it in the default location: `/opt/homebrew/bin/dot` .
        * In my (probably extra special and weird) case, it did not. **I found out where graphviz was installed by typing in `where dot` and following the paths**. Mine is "symlinked" from `/usr/local/bin` which eventually showed me my way to the exact location on my machine (which was `/usr/local/Cellar/graphviz/12.2.1/bin`). This may be because I've installed a few different versions of graphviz for Python and other applications over the years. Anyway, just check and make sure you know where Homebrew installed graphviz and its executable `dot`. You will need this path.
* Back in your "home" directory, we will now make a new file. You can copy & paste this command into your terminal (with that leading dot exactly like this):

	```shell
	nano .xmlcalabash3
	```

This will create and open the new system file for editing.
	
* Here's what you'll need inside (copy/paste):

    
    * ***(For the default location for Homebrew Graphviz)***
  
   ```shell
      <cc:xml-calabash xmlns:cc="https://xmlcalabash.com/ns/configuration">
         <cc:graphviz dot="/opt/homebrew/bin/dot"/>
      </cc:xml-calabash>
   ```

   * *(For Dr. B's weird special case b/c Graphviz was installed elsewhere):*    
   
   ```shell
      <cc:xml-calabash xmlns:cc="https://xmlcalabash.com/ns/configuration">
         <cc:graphviz dot="/usr/local/Cellar/graphviz/12.2.1/bin/dot"/>
      </cc:xml-calabash>
   ```

### Creating an Alias for Calabash
This alias will execute a pretty long command, so you'll definitely want to use it instead of typing the whole command each time.

* Open up your `.zshrc` :

	```shell
	nano .zshrc
	```

    * You need the filepath of where you installed Calabash (I put mine in my GitHub directory). You'll be pointing your script to the `xmlcalabash.sh` file inside.

    * Here's what my calabash execution alias looks like in my `.zshrc` file, giving it the name "calabash"

	```shell
	alias calabash='/Users/eeb4/Documents/GitHub/xmlcalabash-3.0.0-alpha20/xmlcalabash.sh --init:org.nineml.coffeesacks.RegisterCoffeeSacks'
	```
	
   * NOTE: If you're copying this line and just changing the username to match your own, make sure you also check that the name of the calabash directory is the same (version name) as yours.
    
### Testing Calabash

   * To "smoke test" (or see if your installation is working) navigate to your xmlcalabash repo and enter this command: `calabash helloWorld.xpl`. If your installation was successful you should see the following:
     
		```shell
		=== result :: 1 :: file:/Users/eeb4/Documents/GitHub/xmlcalabash-3.0.0-alpha20/helloWorld.xpl ===
		<helloWorld>This is XML Calabash version 3.0.0-alpha20.
		Share and enjoy!</helloWorld>
		==========================================================================================================
		```	
    
   * *For future reference*: As soon as we have an XProc pipeline file (`.xpl`) ready to run, we'll be running with a command like this, using the alias you created: `calabash filename.xpl` ). And we can see some nifty graphviz sketches of our pipeline if we append this to the command (including the dot at the end: `--graphs:.` like so: `calabash filename.xpl --graphs:.`


## Morgana

This is an XProc processor that you can use with more complex ixml contexts and for processing lots of input. It works with the ixml processor [**Markup Blitz**](#markup-blitz).

### Installing Morgana

* Official documentation: <https://www.xml-project.com/manual/index.html>
* Download MorganaXProc-IIIse from [Sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/morganaxproc-iiise/) and unzip the folder. I'm extracting this to my GitHub folder so it's near my projects.

### Installing SchXslt

* Now we're going to install [SchXslt](https://git.sr.ht/~dmaus/schxslt2/refs) (which is pronounced "Shicksilt" ... be careful with that one!) This is an XSLT-based Schematron processor that can handle Schematron validation.
	* Find the latest version, and download the `.zip` file.
		* (As of 17 February 2025, the current SchXslt2 release is <https://git.sr.ht/~dmaus/schxslt2/refs/v1.3.4>)
	* Unzip the file into your GitHub directory.

### Configuring Morgana

* Let's navigate to your "home" directory (where your `.zshrc` lives), and we'll set up a `morgana-config.xml` configuration file there. For this configuration, you're going to need to have some inforamtion ready:
    * You'll need the path to the SchXSLT transpile.xsl file: You'll find that in the main directory of the schxslt directory you just saved. (Mine is here: `/Users/eeb4/Documents/GitHub/schxslt2-v1.3.4`
    * You'll need the path to a Saxon processor that can run XSLT and XQuery and such. You have this already if you installed Calabash: Saxon-HE comes in its library or "lib" folder: 
    Find/copy the path to the Saxon_HE jar file in your xml-calabash lib. (Here's mine:  `/Users/eeb4/Documents/GitHub/xmlcalabash-3.0.0-alpha20/lib/Saxon-HE-12.5.jar`)
  * We presume you're going to be installing [Markup Blitz](#markup-blitz) for your ixml processor (so our configuration settings for Morgana will be set to Markup Blitz).
 
* In your "home" directory, make and open the configuration file:

	```shell
	nano morgana-config.xml
	```

* Paste in the following:    

    ```shell
    <morgana-config xmlns="http://www.xml-project.com/morganaxproc">
	<!-- Relative paths are resolved by uri of this file -->
	
	    <path_to_SchXSLT2_transpiler>/Users/eeb4/Documents/GitHub/schxslt2-1.3.4/transpile.xsl</path_to_SchXSLT2_transpiler>
		
	    <XSLTValidationMode>LAX</XSLTValidationMode>
	
	    <xslt-connector>Saxon12-3</xslt-connector>
	    <xquery-connector>Saxon12-3</xquery-connector>
	    <schematron-connector>schxslt2</schematron-connector>

	    <xslt-config>/Users/eeb4/Documents/GitHub/xmlcalabash-3.0.0-alpha20/lib/Saxon-HE-12.5.jar</xslt-config>
	    <xslt-config></xslt-config>
          <silent>true</silent>
    
	<!--
	<fo-connector>com.xml_project.morganaxproc3.fop2x.ApacheFOP2xConnector</fo-connector>
	<fo-connector>com.xml_project.fosupport.AHFormatterV65.AHF65Connector</fo-connector>
	-->
	
	<!-- <ixml-connector>com.xml_project.morganaxproc3.ninemlConnector.NineMLConnector</ixml-connector> -->`
	<ixml-connector>com.xml_project.morganaxproc3.markupblitzConnector.MarkupBlitzConnector</ixml-connector>

	<!--
	<mediatype-mapping>
		<map file-extension="123" media-type="application/xml" />
	</mediatype-mapping>
	-->
    </morgana-config>
    ```

* **Adapt** these parts of the file:  
     * Change the `<path_to_SchXSLT2_transpiler>` element contents to your path to the transpile.xsl file in schxslt directory. 
     * Change the `<xslt-config>` element contents to your path to Saxon-HE.
     * One more thing: notice the contents of the `<ixml-connector>` element. That's not a filepath, but it is an indicator of which ixml processor you're using. Our active setting in the code below is for Markup Blitz, but you can set this to CoffeePot instead. (We think you can set it to CoffeePot by using the NineMLConnector version that is commented out above it, but we should check the documentation to be sure). 
    
### Creating an Alias for Morgana

Okay, now it's time to make an alias for Morgana!

* Open up your `.zshrc` :

	```shell
	nano .zshrc
	```

* My morgana alias looks like this:

    ```shell
    alias morgana='/Users/eeb4/Documents/GitHub/MorganaXProc-IIIse-1.5/Morgana.sh -config=/Users/eeb4/morgana-config.xml'
    ```

  * You will need to **adapt** my sample alias to represent the locations of: 
     * Your Morgana.sh file in the Morgana directory (mine is in my "GitHub" folder). 
     * Your morgana-config.xml file (in your "home").

### Installing CoffeeFilter and CoffeeGrinder

***Time for some coffee!***

* Download and install CoffeeFilter and CoffeeGrinder from <https://github.com/nineml>. (As usual I'm setting coffee stuff in my GitHub folder.)
    * Download [the most recent CoffeeFilter](https://github.com/nineml/coffeefilter/releases), unzip it into your GitHub folder.
    * Download [the most recent CoffeeGrinder](https://github.com/nineml/coffeegrinder/releases), unzip it into your GitHub folder.

### More Morgana Configuration

**Modifying Morgana.sh:**

Now, we need to make sure Morgana's executable script (the Morgana.sh file) can find its way to the CoffeeGrinder and CoffeeFilter jar files you just unpacked.
    
* First, navigate in your shell to where you saved the MorganaXproc-IIISe directory. Take a look with

	```shell
	ls
	``` 
	
	and make sure it has a file named `Morgana.sh` inside.
	
* Try 

	```shell
	ls -lisa
	```
	
	to see its rwx (read-write-execute) properties. They probably look like this: `-rw-r--r--@`. We need to change it to make it executable.
   
* **Make Morgana.sh executable**: Do this with 

	```shell
	chmod +x Morgana.sh
	```
	
* **Now, we need to edit Morgana.sh**:

	```shell
	nano Morgana.sh
	```
        
* **You'll need to add and adjust the lines marked `#Local customization`** to identify the location of Saxon-HE (we'll use the one in Calabash library), the CoffeeGrinder and CoffeeFilter .jar files, and finally the location of the Markup Blitz .jar file (after you install [Markup Blitz](#markup-blitz)).

	```shell
	#Local customization
	SAXON_JAR=/Users/eeb4/Documents/GitHub/xmlcalabash-3.0.0-alpha20/lib/Saxon-HE-12.5.jar
	COFFEEGRINDER_JAR=/Users/eeb4/Documents/GitHub/coffeegrinder-3.2.7/CoffeeGrinder-3.2.7.jar
	COFFEEFILTER_JAR=/Users/eeb4/Documents/GitHub/coffeefilter-3.2.7/CoffeeFilter-3.2.7.jar
	BLITZ_JAR=/Users/eeb4/Documents/GitHub/markup-blitz/build/libs/markup-blitz.jar
	```
	
	* NOTE: the line noting the `markup-blitz.jar` file is assuming you install it in your GitHub folder. If you do this step first, make sure you know where you are going to install Markup Blitz. If you're unsure, **make sure you come back to this step and confirm the filepath is correct.**

* **Edit the `CLASSPATH`** near the end of the file: Basically you need to add all the local customization variables here, and it will be kind of like pouring Markup Blitz through a coffee grinder, into a coffee filter, and then through some Saxon into a morgana mug. :-) Here's how the `CLASSPATH` should be edited, and you just need to make sure that each of these variables has been defined in order for Morgana to run.

	```shell
	CLASSPATH=$BLITZ_JAR:$COFFEEGRINDER_JAR:$COFFEEFILTER_JAR:$SAXON_JAR:$MORGANA_LIB:$MORGANA_HOME/MorganaXProc-IIIse.jar
	```
        
* Here is how my Morgana.sh looks:

 ```shell
	CURRENT_SCRIPT=$0
	#CURRENT_SCRIPT="$(readlink -f "$0")"  #resolves symlinks on unix based systems (Does not work on BSD systems like MacOS)
	
	#echo $0
	MORGANA_HOME=$(dirname $CURRENT_SCRIPT)
	MORGANA_LIB=$MORGANA_HOME/MorganaXProc-IIIse_lib/*
	
	#Local customization
	SAXON_JAR=/Users/eeb4/Documents/GitHub/xmlcalabash-3.0.0-alpha20/lib/Saxon-HE-12.5.jar
	COFFEEGRINDER_JAR=/Users/eeb4/Documents/GitHub/coffeegrinder-3.2.7/CoffeeGrinder-3.2.7.jar
	COFFEEFILTER_JAR=/Users/eeb4/Documents/GitHub/coffeefilter-3.2.7/CoffeeFilter-3.2.7.jar
	BLITZ_JAR=/Users/eeb4/Documents/GitHub/markup-blitz/build/libs/markup-blitz.jar
	
	#Settings for JAVA_AGENT: Only for Java 8 we have to use -javaagent.
	JAVA_AGENT=""
	
	JAVA_VER=$(java -version 2>&1 | sed -n ';s/.* version "\(.*\)\.\(.*\)\..*".*/\1\2/p;')
	
	if [ $JAVA_VER = "18" ]
	then
		JAVA_AGENT=-javaagent:$MORGANA_HOME/MorganaXProc-IIIse_lib/quasar-core-0.7.9.jar
	fi
	
	# All related jars are expected to be in $MORGANA_LIB. For externals jars: Add them to $CLASSPATH
	CLASSPATH=$BLITZ_JAR:$COFFEEGRINDER_JAR:$COFFEEFILTER_JAR:$SAXON_JAR:$MORGANA_LIB:$MORGANA_HOME/MorganaXProc-IIIse.jar
	
	java $JAVA_AGENT -cp $CLASSPATH com.xml_project.morganaxproc3.XProcEngine "$@"
 ```

### Testing Morgana

* To "smoke test" Morgana to see if it is properly installed, navigate to your Morgana repo and enter `morgana pipeline.xpl`. If your installation was successful, you will see the following:

	```shell
	$ morgana pipeline.xpl
	Hello world. This is an XProc 3.0 pipeline running.
	```

# Invisible XML (ixml) Processors

## CoffeePot

...to be used with the XProc processor [**Calabash**](#calabash).
You may think you installed this already, but that was "CoffeeSacks" (made by the same NineML developers) which we needed for Calabash to run, and we'll see a running theme on "coffee" related installations in our XProc and ixml setup. :-) 

### Installing CoffeePot

* Here's the [CoffeePot](https://github.com/nineml/coffeepot) repo, and here's where to [download the latest release](https://github.com/nineml/coffeepot/releases).
    * Surprise: I'm storing CoffeePot in my GitHub directory along with everything else from this tutorial :)

### Creating an Alias for CoffeePot

* We need to **create an alias for the coffeepot .jar file** in your `.zshrc` file. 

* Open up your `.zshrc` :

	```shell
	nano .zshrc
	```

* Create an alias:

	```shell
	alias coffeepot='java -jar /Users/eeb4/Documents/GitHub/coffeepot-3.2.7/coffeepot-3.2.7.jar'
	```

    * Note the filepath that leads to the coffeepot jar (use `pwd` to help) and your alias might look something like mine (make sure yours applies the version number that you downloaded)

### Configuring CoffeePot

* To do things with CoffeePot, we need to create a system dot-file named `.nineml.properties` in the same "home" location as your `zshrc`. This contains some default settings for pretty-printing your output XML and your graphviz visualizations. You'll need to note (again) where your GraphViz bin/dot is located, and you've entered that already in your `.xmlcalabash3` file, so use the same filepath location here.

* In your "home" directory, make and open the dot-file:

	```shell
	nano .nineml.properties
	```

* **Adapt** the following (using your own filepath to graphviz that you copied from `.xmlcalabash3`). 

	Examples:

 
    * ***(For the default location for Homebrew Graphviz)***
  
   	    ```shell
	    graphviz=/opt/homebrew/bin/dot
	    ignore-trailing-whitespace=true
	    pretty-print=true
	    progress-bar=tty
	    assert-valid-xml-characters=true
	    assert-valid-xml-names=true
	    ignore-bom=true
	    normalize-line-endings=true
	    trailing-newline-on-output=true
	    ```

    * *(Dr. B's weird special case b/c Graphviz was installed elsewhere):*
   
	    ```shell
	    graphviz=/usr/local/Cellar/graphviz/12.2.1/bin/dot
	    ignore-trailing-whitespace=true
	    pretty-print=true
	    progress-bar=tty
	    assert-valid-xml-characters=true
	    assert-valid-xml-names=true
	    ignore-bom=true
	    normalize-line-endings=true
	    trailing-newline-on-output=true
	    ```   

  * If you ever need to adjust these settings or find out more, here's [the CoffeePot documentation](https://docs.nineml.org/current/coffeepot/bk02ch07.html).

### Running CoffeePot 
* Run CoffeePot over an ixml grammar and a .txt file like this, using your alias: (Think of "g" as standing for "grammar" and "i" as "input file")

	```shell
	coffeepot -g:filename.ixml -i:filename.txt
	``` 

* You can add a couple of things to this command to check for ambiguities in the ixml, and to visualize the output:
    * Try adding `--analyze-ambiguity` like so: `coffeepot -g:filename.ixml -i:filename.txt --analyze-ambiguity`
    * Try adding `--graph:filename.svg` to get some SVG output, like so: `coffeepot -g:filename.ixml -i:filename.txt --graph:filename.svg`
        * NOTE: The SVG option is meant for simple/small things. CoffeePot won't be able to generate the SVG if it's going to be a large and complicated file. 

## Markup Blitz

To be used with the XProc processor [**Morgana**](#morgana). Up to this point, we have been unpacking a lot of jar (java archive) files. This time, we're actually going to *build* the jar for Markup Blitz in order to install it. 

### Installing Markup Blitz

* For this, we'll follow the [official Markup Blitz instructions (on the README)](https://github.com/GuntherRademacher/markup-blitz).
* Begin by cloning the markup-blitz repo in your GitHub directory:

	```shell
	git clone https://github.com/GuntherRademacher/markup-blitz.git
	```
	
* Navigate to the new directory you just cloned:

	```shell
	cd markup-blitz
	```
	
* For Macs, this line (marked for Unix/Linux) works to build our jar:

	```shell
	./gradlew clean jar
	```
	
* When Gradle finishes building, you'll be returned to the command prompt. Check for the new jar, which you should now find in the repo in `build/libs/markup-blitz.jar`.

### Creating an Alias for Markup Blitz

* Finally, go to "home" to your `.zshrc` and open it with

	```shell
	nano .zshrc
	```

* Make an alias for running your new markup-blitz.jar file. I called my alias "blitz" and my alias definition looks like this:

  ```shell
  alias blitz='java -jar /Users/eeb4/Documents/GitHub/markup-blitz/build/libs/markup-blitz.jar'
  ```

### Running Markup Blitz

* To run Markup Blitz to process an ixml grammar and an input .txt file, use your new alias like this:

  ```shell
  blitz filename.ixml filename.txt
  ```

# Completion

When you have finished all these installations, congratulations! You have everything you need (with Coffee Pot and Markup Blitz) to apply invisible xml to convert text files to xml according to your grammar definition. And you have everything you need (with Calabash and Morgana) to set that ixml conversion into a processing pipeline that can apply XSLT, XQuery, and Schematron to the XML that you create with ixml!
