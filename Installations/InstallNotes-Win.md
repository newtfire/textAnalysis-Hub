# Preliminary Installations & Suggestions

On Windows, you will need to move between different shells to handle installations. You will get to know:

* Windows Power Shell, Run in Administrator mode

* Git Bash Shell (where you use git commands / interface with GitHub)

You will also need to: 

* have a `.bashrc` file for storing aliases. An alias is a short word / phrase you can type in your shell to stand in for longer commands, and it will make it easy to run the programs we're installing.

* find and edit your system PATH variables. Some of this can be done in your Control Panel.

* **Know how to enter Windows FilePaths**: Windows filepaths can be entered in three different ways (and you may see all three ways in these instructions).
    * **With the drive letter**, like this. *This is usually how we prefer to enter absolute Windows paths in the scripts below.*
      ```shell
      /c/Users/ebbon/Documents/GitHub/xmlcalabash-3.0.0-alpha20/lib/Saxon-HE-12.5.jar
      ```
    * You will also see Windows paths that look like this with the drive letter capitalized and the path separators as backslashes `\`. That is more native to the Windows command line how you see them in the Windows System Properties Environment Variables where you set your JAVA_HOME variable:
      ```shell
      C:\Program Files\OpenJDK\jdk-22.0.2\
      ```
    * **With a tilda** `~` to stand in for the drive letter and path to your home directory (the filepath you go to when you enter `cd ` ). This can be a convenient shorter way to write the paths. *Sometimes we have entered the path with this notation. It is fine, just note what the ~ means.*
      ```shell
      ~/Documents/GitHub/xmlcalabash-3.0.0-alpha20/lib/Saxon-HE-12.5.jar
      ```
    * **If you see filepaths written out for these Windows instructions that do NOT start with either the `~` or the drive letter, they are incorrect!** (Let us know if you spot these and we will revise them! These simply cannot work because Windows will supply some extra folders at the start of the filepath, leading to incorrect paths.)
      

### Installing Chocolatey

First, install the chocolatey package manager for Windows. This will help you to install packages at the command line.

* Use your Windows PowerShell in "Run as Administrator" mode, and follow [Chocolatey's installation instructions](https://chocolatey.org/install)).

* You can quickly test out your new installation of Chocolatey by installing Marktext, popular free markdown editor for Windows (which I'm using to write up this guide). Try the command `choco install marktext` You should see the new software come up in your taskbar and you can try it out!

### Installing JDK

First, make sure you have developer (jdk) java installed:

* To check if you have java, you can use your Git Bash shell to enter `which java` or `where java`(Those commands won't work in PowerShell, but all the shells will respond to `java -version` (which tells you if you have an old version or nothing at all.)
  * Dr. B here: My version was Java 19 (from 2022) on my Lenovo laptop. For the invisible XML / XProc work we're doing here, I'm going ahead and installing the latest easily available OpenJDK developer version for Windows.
* Most likely, you'll need to install OpenJDK java. We'll use chocolatey to install it. Open your PowerShell (running as Administrator) and enter:

	```shell
	choco install openjdk
	```

  (When doing all these shell installations be sure you read the responses and enter "Y" as needed to continue processes.)

* Now when you check your version of java:
* 
	```shell
	java -version
	```

	You should see the current JDK that you installed with chocolatey.

* Next we need to make sure the location of the JDK you installed is set in your system environment variables. In your Search bar, look for "System" or "Control Panel" (or Edit the System Environment Variables). Find the tab to edit the Environment Variables and look for JAVA_HOME. Click "Edit User Variable" and paste in the new filepath of your Java. (You can see that in Git Bash with `where java`) **NOTE** : For the Windows installations to work, we will need to the User Path to be set to the jdk folder that's inside OpenJDK, like so (depending on your version number): `C:\Program Files\OpenJDK\jdk-22.0.2\` . Your system should look something like this screen capture:
  
  ![](environvar-win.png)
  
### Suggestions

* There are a lot of installations throughout this process. To keep them organized, *it is a good idea to place them all in your GitHub directory since you should be familiar with that directory at this point.*

* To make things simpler for yourself, use the same alias names that I use in this tutorial, so when we're working on this in class, there's no confusion if your alias has a different name than mine.

* We also suggest you install 2 more helpful command line tools via Chocolatey:

	```shell
 	choco install bat
 	```

	```shell
 	choco install xmlstarlet
 	```

# XProc Processors

## Calabash

This is an XProc processor that you can use with the ixml processor [**CoffeePot**](#coffeepot) that's good for simple grammars and input files that aren't super large.

### Installing Calabash
  
* Get it from here: <https://github.com/xmlcalabash/xmlcalabash3/releases> and look for the **xmlcalabash zip file** in the latest release, after the release notes. The zip directory you need is the third one from the top (named something like this with the version number in the name): **xmlcalabash-3.0.0-alpha20.zip**
* Unzip this and move it somewhere central where it's easy to work with. I set my unzipped xmlcalabash folder in my GitHub directory so it's near where I work on code.
* Open your shell and navigate to your new xmlcalabash folder. For this to work we need to be able to use Java to execute the .jar file inside.
       Test if your Java installation works. This 'help' shell command will show you all the different commands available **(ADAPT THIS LINE TO APPLY TO YOUR VERSION NUMBER AS NEEDED!)**:
	
	```shell
	java -jar xmlcalabash-app-3.0.0-alpha20.jar help
	```
	
	* NOTE: **The XML Calabash version number may have changed** since we drafted these instructions! Check the version number carefully as you adapt the following instructions, which will require you to enter a filepath to this xmlcalabash jar file.  
  
### Graphviz

* **Test if you have graphviz** by entering this in your terminal: 

	```shell
	dot -V
	```
	
* You will probably need to install GraphViz, and you can do that with `choco install graphviz`.

### CoffeeSacks

*(This is needed for Calabash)*
  
  * Pick up CoffeeSacks from the versioned releases on the repo, here: https://github.com/nineml/coffeesacks/releases and find the latest one to download.
  * Copy the **CoffeeSacks jar** file into your XML Calabash `extra/` subdirectory.

### Configuring Calabash

***Making the .xmlcalabash3 dot-file:***
 
* Navigate to your "home" directory (which is where you set up your .bash_profile file and establish your aliases and environment variables and such like). In this location we'll be storing a dot-file which will help Calabash to run.
    * NOTE: We will NOT be using Saxon EE at all.
    * We need to know where Chocolatey installed graphviz.
    * Use the Git Bash shell and type `where dot` . Mine is given as `C:\Program Files\Graphviz\bin\dot.exe` You will need this path.
* Back in your "home" directory, we will now make a new file. You can copy in this command in your Git Bash terminal (with that leading dot exactly like this). 

	```shell
	nano .xmlcalabash3
	```

This will create and open the new system file for editing.
	
* Here's what you'll need inside (copy/paste):


    * *You will need to edit the `@dot` attribute on the `<cc:graphviz>` element to point it to YOUR location for graphviz up to the dot.exe*
  
   ```shell
      <cc:xml-calabash xmlns:cc="https://xmlcalabash.com/ns/configuration">
         <cc:graphviz dot="C:\Program Files\Graphviz\bin\dot.exe"/>
      </cc:xml-calabash>
   ```

### Creating an Alias for Calabash
This alias will execute a pretty long command, so you'll definitely want to use it instead of typing the whole command each time.

* Open up your `.bashrc` in your Git Bash terminal:

	```shell
	nano .bashrc
	```

    * You need the filepath of where you installed Calabash (I put mine in my GitHub directory). You'll be pointing your script to the `xmlcalabash.sh` file inside.

    * Here's what my calabash execution alias looks like in my `.bashrc` file, giving it the name "calabash"

	```shell
	alias calabash='~/Documents/GitHub/xmlcalabash-3.0.0-alpha20/xmlcalabash.sh --init:org.nineml.coffeesacks.RegisterCoffeeSacks'
	```
	
   * NOTE: If you're copying this line and just changing the username to match your own, make sure you also check that the name of the calabash directory is the same (version name) as yours.

### Testing Calabash

* To "smoke test" (or see if your installation is working) navigate to your xmlcalabash repo and enter this command: `calabash helloWorld.xpl`. If your installation was successful you should see the following:

	```shell
	  === result :: 1 :: file:/C:/Users/ebbon/Documents/GitHub/xmlcalabash-3.0.0-alpha20/helloWorld.xpl ===
	<?xml version="1.0" encoding="windows-1252"?>
	<helloWorld>This is XML Calabash version 3.0.0-alpha20.
	Share and enjoy!</helloWorld>
	=====================================================================================================
	```

* *For future reference*: As soon as we have our own XProc pipeline files (`.xpl`) ready to run, we'll be running with a command like this, using the alias you created: `calabash filename.xpl` ). And we can see some nifty graphviz sketches of our pipeline if we append this to the command (including the dot at the end: `--graphs:.` like so: `calabash filename.xpl --graphs:.`


## Morgana

This is an XProc processor that you can use with more complex ixml contexts and for processing lots of input. It works with the ixml processor [**Markup Blitz**](#markup-blitz).

### Installing Morgana

* Official documentation: <https://www.xml-project.com/manual/index.html>
* Download MorganaXProc-IIIse from [Sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/morganaxproc-iiise/) and unzip the folder.
     * Unzip the folder and extract it to your GitHub folder (so it's near your projects). 

### Installing SchXslt

* Now we're going to install [SchXslt](https://git.sr.ht/~dmaus/schxslt2/refs) (which is pronounced "Shicksilt" ... be careful with that one!) This is an XSLT-based Schematron processor that can handle Schematron validation.
     * Find the latest version, and download the .zip file. **Double check your release number (it may not match ours)**: (As of 17 February 2025, the current SchXslt2 release is https://git.sr.ht/~dmaus/schxslt2/refs/v1.3.4)
     * Unzip the file into your GitHub directory.


### Configuring Morgana

* Let's navigate to your "home" directory (where your `.bashrc` lives), and we'll set up a `morgana-config.xml` configuration file there. For this configuration, you're going to need to have some inforamtion ready:
    * You'll need the path to the SchXSLT transpile.xsl file: You'll find that in the main directory of the schxslt directory you just saved. (Mine is here: `/c/Users/ebbon/Documents/GitHub/schxslt2-v1.3.4`
    * You'll need the path to a Saxon processor that can run XSLT and XQuery and such. You have this already if you installed Calabash: Saxon-HE comes in its library or "lib" folder: 
    Find/copy the path to the Saxon_HE jar file in your xml-calabash lib. (Here's mine:  `/c/Users/ebbon/Documents/GitHub/xmlcalabash-3.0.0-alpha20/lib/Saxon-HE-12.5.jar`)
  * We presume you're going to be installing [Markup Blitz](#markup-blitz) for your ixml processor (so our configuration settings for Morgana will be set to Markup Blitz).

* In your "home" directory, make and open the configuration file:

	```shell
	nano morgana-config.xml
	```
	
* Paste in the following:    

    ```shell
    <morgana-config xmlns="http://www.xml-project.com/morganaxproc">
	<!-- Relative paths are resolved by uri of this file -->
	
	    <path_to_SchXSLT2_transpiler>/c/Users/ebbon/Documents/GitHub/schxslt2-v1.3.4/transpile.xsl</path_to_SchXSLT2_transpiler>
		
	    <XSLTValidationMode>LAX</XSLTValidationMode>
	
	    <xslt-connector>Saxon12-3</xslt-connector>
	    <xquery-connector>Saxon12-3</xquery-connector>
	    <schematron-connector>schxslt2</schematron-connector>

          <silent>true</silent>
    
	<!--
	<fo-connector>com.xml_project.morganaxproc3.fop2x.ApacheFOP2xConnector</fo-connector>
	<fo-connector>com.xml_project.fosupport.AHFormatterV65.AHF65Connector</fo-connector>
	-->
	
	<!-- <ixml-connector>com.xml_project.morganaxproc3.ninemlConnector.NineMLConnector</ixml-connector> -->`
	<ixml-connector>com.xml_project.morganaxproc3.markupblitzConnector.MarkupBlitzConnector</ixml-connector>

	<!--
	<mediatype-mapping>
		<map file-extension="123" media-type="application/xml" />
	</mediatype-mapping>
	-->
    </morgana-config>
    ```

* **Adapt** these parts of the file:  
     * Change the `<path_to_SchXSLT2_transpiler>` element contents to your path to the transpile.xsl file in schxslt directory. **CHECK the schxslt version number** as this may have changed since we drafted this instructions!
     * Change the `<xslt-config>` element contents to your path to Saxon-HE. **Notice that this is in your xmlcalabash directory** that you set up earlier!
     * One more thing: notice the contents of the `<ixml-connector>` element. That's not a filepath, but it is an indicator of which ixml processor you're using. Our active setting in the code below is for Markup Blitz, but you can set this to CoffeePot instead. (We think you can set it to CoffeePot by using the NineMLConnector version that is commented out above it, but we should check the documentation to be sure).

### Creating an Alias for Morgana

Okay, now it's time to make an alias for Morgana!

* Open up your `.bashrc` :

	```shell
	nano .bashrc
	```

* My morgana alias looks like this:

    ```shell
    alias morgana='~/Documents/GitHub/MorganaXProc-IIIse-1.5/Morgana.bat -config=C:/Users/eebon/morgana-config.xml'
    ```
    **Double check the version number on your Morgana directory**: Yours may not match mine if there's been an update since I last posted these instructions!

  * You will need to **adapt** my sample alias to represent the locations of: 
     * Your Morgana.sh file in the Morgana directory (mine is in my "GitHub" folder). 
     * Your morgana-config.xml file (in your "home").

### Installing CoffeeFilter and CoffeeGrinder

***Time for some coffee!***

* Download and install CoffeeFilter and CoffeeGrinder from <https://github.com/nineml>. (As usual I'm setting coffee stuff in my GitHub folder.)
    * Download [the most recent CoffeeFilter](https://github.com/nineml/coffeefilter/releases), unzip it into your GitHub folder.
    * Download [the most recent CoffeeGrinder](https://github.com/nineml/coffeegrinder/releases), unzip it into your GitHub folder.

### More Morgana Configuration

**Modifying Morgana.bat**

Now we need to make sure Morgana's Windows batch executable script (the Morgana.bat file) can find its way to the CoffeeGrinder and CoffeeFilter jar files you just unpacked.

* Navigate to your Morgana directory (where you unzipped the "MorganaXProc-IIIse-1.4.10" folder) and open the `Morgana.bat` file:

	```shell
	nano Morgana.bat
	```
  
* **You'll need to add and adjust the lines marked `REM Local customization`** to identify the location of Saxon-HE (we'll use the one in Calabash library), the CoffeeGrinder and CoffeeFilter .jar files, and finally the location of the Markup Blitz .jar file (after you install [Markup Blitz](#markup-blitz)).

	```shell
	REM Local customization
	set SAXON_JAR="/c/Users/ebbon/Documents/GitHub/xmlcalabash-3.0.0-alpha20/lib/Saxon-HE-12.5.jar"
	set COFFEEGRINDER_JAR="/c/Users/ebbon/Documents/GitHub/coffeegrinder-3.2.7/CoffeeGrinder-3.2.7.jar"
	set COFFEEFILTER_JAR="/c/Users/ebbon/Documents/GitHub/coffeefilter-3.2.7/CoffeeFilter-3.2.7.jar"
	set BLITZ_JAR="/c/Users/ebbon/Documents/GitHub/markup-blitz/build/libs/markup-blitz.jar"
	```
	
	* NOTE: the line noting the `markup-blitz.jar` file is assuming you install it in your GitHub folder. If you do this step first, make sure you know where you are going to install Markup Blitz. If you're unsure, **make sure you come back to this step and confirm the filepath is correct.**

* **Edit the `CLASSPATH`** near the end of the file: Basically you need to add all the local customization variables here, and it will be kind of like pouring Markup Blitz through a coffee grinder, into a coffee filter, and then through some saxon into a morgana mug. :-) Here's how the CLASSPATH should be edited, and you just need to make sure that each of these variables has been defined in order for Morgana to run.

	```
	set CLASSPATH="%BLITZ_JAR%;%COFFEEGRINDER_JAR%;%COFFEEFILTER_JAR%;%SAXON_JAR%;%LIB_PATH%;%PROG_PATH%"
	```

* Here is what my `Morgana.bat` looks like after I've located (and installed) everything:

	```shell
	@echo off
	setlocal
	
	set MORGANADIR=%~dp0
	
	REM All related jars are expected to be in $MORGANA_LIB. For externals jars: Add them to $CLASSPATH
	set PROG_PATH="%MORGANADIR%MorganaXProc-IIIse.jar"
	set LIB_PATH="%MORGANADIR%MorganaXProc-IIIse_lib/*"
	
	REM Local customization
	set SAXON_JAR="/c/Users/ebbon/Documents/GitHub/xmlcalabash-3.0.0-alpha20/lib/Saxon-HE-12.5.jar"
	set COFFEEGRINDER_JAR="/c/Users/ebbon/Documents/GitHub/coffeegrinder-3.2.7/CoffeeGrinder-3.2.7.jar"
	set COFFEEFILTER_JAR="/c/Users/ebbon/Documents/GitHub/coffeefilter-3.2.7/CoffeeFilter-3.2.7.jar"
	set BLITZ_JAR="/c/Users/ebbon/Documents/GitHub/markup-blitz/build/libs/markup-blitz.jar"
	
	
	set CLASSPATH="%BLITZ_JAR%;%COFFEEGRINDER_JAR%;%COFFEEFILTER_JAR%;%SAXON_JAR%;%LIB_PATH%;%PROG_PATH%"
	
	REM Settings for JAVA_AGENT: Only for Java 8 we have to use -javaagent.
	@for /f tokens^=2-5^ delims^=.-_^" %%j in ('java -fullversion 2^>^&1') do set "JAVA_VERSION=%%j%%k"
	
	set JAVA_AGENT=
	if %JAVA_VERSION% EQU 18 (set JAVA_AGENT="-javaagent:%MORGANADIR%MorganaXProc-IIIse_lib/quasar-core-0.7.9.jar")
	
	java %JAVA_AGENT% -cp %CLASSPATH% com.xml_project.morganaxproc3.XProcEngine %*
	
	```

### Testing Morgana

* To "smoke test" Morgana to see if it is properly installed, navigate to your Morgana repo and enter `morgana pipeline.xpl`. If your installation was successful, you will see the following:

	```shell
	$ morgana pipeline.xpl
	Hello world. This is an XProc 3.0 pipeline running.
	```

# Invisible XML (ixml) Processors

## CoffeePot

...to be used with the XProc processor [**Calabash**](#calabash).
You may think you installed this already, but that was "CoffeeSacks" (made by the same NineML developers) which we needed for Calabash to run, and we'll see a running theme on "coffee" related installations in our XProc and ixml setup. :-) 

### Installing CoffeePot

* Here's the [CoffeePot](https://github.com/nineml/coffeepot) repo, and here's where to [download the latest release](https://github.com/nineml/coffeepot/releases).
    * Surprise: I'm storing CoffeePot in my GitHub directory along with everything else from this tutorial :)

### Creating an Alias for CoffeePot

* We need to **create an alias for the coffeepot .jar file** in your `.bashrc` file. 

* Open up your `.bashrc` :

	```shell
	nano .bashrc
	```

* Create an alias:

	```shell
	alias coffeepot='java -jar /c/Users/ebbon/Documents/GitHub/coffeepot-3.2.7/coffeepot-3.2.7.jar'
	```

    * Note the filepath that leads to the coffeepot jar (use `pwd` to help) and your alias might look something like mine (make sure yours applies the version number that you downloaded)

### Configuring CoffeePot

* To do things with CoffeePot, we need to create a system dot-file named `.nineml.properties` in the same "home" location as your `bashrc`. This contains some default settings for pretty-printing your output XML and your graphviz visualizations. You'll need to note (again) where your GraphViz bin/dot is located, and you've entered that already in your `.xmlcalabash3` file, so use the same filepath location here.

* In your "home" directory, make and open the dot-file:

	```shell
	nano .nineml.properties
	```

* **Adapt** the following (using your own filepath to graphviz that you copied from `.xmlcalabash3`):

    * Code:
  
   	    ```shell
	    graphviz=/c/Program\ Files/Graphviz/bin/dot.exe
	    ignore-trailing-whitespace=true
	    pretty-print=true
	    progress-bar=tty
	    assert-valid-xml-characters=true
	    assert-valid-xml-names=true
	    ignore-bom=true
	    normalize-line-endings=true
	    trailing-newline-on-output=true
	    ```

  * If you ever need to adjust these settings or find out more, here's [the CoffeePot documentation](https://docs.nineml.org/current/coffeepot/bk02ch07.html).

### Smoke Test for CoffeePot

Open a shell anywhere and run `coffeepot` to test your alias. If all is well, you should see this single line appear in your shell:

```
Usage: ... -g:input.ixml -o:output.xml (--help for more details)
```
      
### Running CoffeePot 
* Run CoffeePot over an ixml grammar and a .txt file like this, using your alias: (Think of "g" as standing for "grammar" and "i" as "input file")

	```shell
	coffeepot -g:filename.ixml -i:filename.txt
	``` 

* You can add a couple of things to this command to check for ambiguities in the ixml, and to visualize the output:
    * Try adding `--analyze-ambiguity` like so: `coffeepot -g:filename.ixml -i:filename.txt --analyze-ambiguity`
    * Try adding `--graph:filename.svg` to get some SVG output, like so: `coffeepot -g:filename.ixml -i:filename.txt --graph:filename.svg`
        * NOTE: The SVG option is meant for simple/small things. CoffeePot won't be able to generate the SVG if it's going to be a large and complicated file. 

## Markup Blitz

To be used with the XProc processor [**Morgana**](#morgana). Up to this point, we have been unpacking a lot of jar (java archive) files. This time, we're actually going to *build* the jar for Markup Blitz in order to install it. 

### Installing Markup Blitz

* For this, we'll follow the [official Markup Blitz instructions (on the README)](https://github.com/GuntherRademacher/markup-blitz).
* Begin by cloning the markup-blitz repo in your GitHub directory:

	```shell
	git clone https://github.com/GuntherRademacher/markup-blitz.git
	```
	
* Navigate to the new directory you just cloned:

	```shell
	cd markup-blitz
	```
	
Working in our Git Bash shell on Windows, this line works to build our jar:

```shell
 	./gradlew clean jar
```
	
* When Gradle finishes building, you'll be returned to the command prompt. Check for the new jar, which you should now find in the repo in `build/libs/markup-blitz.jar`.

### Creating an Alias for Markup Blitz

* Finally, go to "home" to your `.bashrc` and open it with

	```shell
	nano .bashrc
	```

* Make an alias for running your new markup-blitz.jar file. I called my alias "blitz" and my alias definition looks like this:

  ```shell
  alias blitz='java -jar /c/Users/ebbon/Documents/GitHub/markup-blitz/build/libs/markup-blitz.jar'
  ```

### Smoke Test for Markup Blitz

Open a shell anywhere and run `blitz` to test your alias. You should see a screen about compiling Invisible XML commands that starts like this:

```
Usage: java -jar markup-blitz.jar [<OPTION>...] [<GRAMMAR>] <INPUT>

. . . more stuff below . . .

# Completion

When you have finished all these installations, congratulations! You have everything you need (with Coffee Pot and Markup Blitz) to apply invisible xml to convert text files to xml according to your grammar definition. And you have everything you need (with Calabash and Morgana) to set that ixml conversion into a processing pipeline that can apply XSLT, XQuery, and Schematron to the XML that you create with ixml!
