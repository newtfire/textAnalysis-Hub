This directory contains step-by-step installation and configuration guides for setting up **[Invisible XML (ixml)](https://invisiblexml.org/)** and **[XProc](https://xproc.org/)** tools for course tutorials and hands-on XML processing work.

These guides walk you through installing:

- Invisible XML processors (CoffeePot, Markup Blitz)
- XProc processors (Calabash, Morgana)
- Required dependencies (OpenJDK, Graphviz, package managers)
- Helpful shell aliases and smoke tests

## What’s in This Directory

- **[macOS Setup Guide](https://github.com/newtfire/textAnalysis-Hub/blob/main/Installations/ixml-xproc-InstallNotes-Mac.md)**: Full installation instructions for macOS users

- **[Windows Setup Guide](https://github.com/newtfire/textAnalysis-Hub/blob/main/Installations/ixml-xproc-InstallNotes-Win.md)**: The same instructions, adapted for Windows environments

Both guides are based on the official NineML and XProc documentation and support the Spring 2025 Invisible XML + XProc tutorial materials developed by David Birnbaum.

## Who This Is For

This setup is intended for:

- Students working with Invisible XML and XProc pipelines

## How to Use

1. Open the guide that matches your operating system  
2. Follow the steps in order (don’t skip the smoke tests!)
