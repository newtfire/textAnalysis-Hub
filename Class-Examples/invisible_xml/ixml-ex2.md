#Invisible XML (ixml) Exercise 2

You are ready for this assignment if you have completed (that is, attempted and discussed and followed along) [Invisibe XML Exercise 1](ixml-ex1.md). This time we're not going to give as many pointers in the assignment, but let you figure out how to write your grammar working with what you learned form  our  guide,  ["Writing your First Invisible XML"](https://github.com/newtfire/textAnalysis-Hub/blob/main/Class-Examples/invisible_xml/iXMLstart.md)** and the readings/linked resources provided on invisible XML. 

## Source file: Zoom transcript
This time, let's try writing a grammar to structure the transcript and timestamps in this Zoom transcript made from a recording for our Digit 210 on January 30, 2026.

You can follow the link to download and save this directly, or use `git pull` on the main branch of  the textAnalysis-Hub/Class-Examples/invisible_xml/zoom-transcript.txt. Save it in a folder with your personal repo / homework to work on together with an invisible xml grammar file.

Your task is to create an invisible XML grammar that represents a good XML model of your choice, organizing this information into elements and/or attributes.
