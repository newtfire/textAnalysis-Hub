00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:07,330
Greetings digit 210.
So at the end of class

2
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:10,510
today on Friday January
30th I left us on a

3
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:13,250
bit of a cliffhanger
with a bit of broken

4
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:15,990
code. Let me remind
you what we were trying

5
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:19,090
to do. I have now fixed
it so I'm going to

6
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:22,830
show you the graph the
way I wanted to plot

7
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:27,330
it. Here it is and
this is the number of

8
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:31,880
speeches in each location
of the Dan to Dan

9
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:34,950
episode that we were
looking at. And as you see,

10
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:36,830
this is what I wanted
to do. I wanted to

11
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:39,510
put the location with
the most speeches at

12
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:42,410
the bottom of the graph,
and then I could plot

13
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:45,390
them in descending
order. So each one of

14
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:47,890
these little wedges
gets smaller and smaller

15
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:50,530
based on the number
of speeches. We go 49

16
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:55,590
to 33 to 24. so you see
how that works so how

17
00:00:55,590 --> 00:01:01,570
did I do that and
let me stop the share

18
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:07,850
restart it switch to my
other desktop and here

19
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:13,110
I think you can see
my code so previously

20
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:17,070
we had been sort we
had been outputting a

21
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:21,950
chunk of like a little
bar to stack based on

22
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:25,610
these distinct values
of the where attributes

23
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:29,650
on stage and previously
I had this little

24
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:33,170
expath sort what that
did is sort these

25
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:36,590
distinct values the default
way and expath which

26
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:39,270
is alphabetical order
and we decided that

27
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:41,090
didn't really look so
good or make that much

28
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:43,310
sense so we're gonna
do it a different way

29
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:48,910
to fix things I
removed this sort and I

30
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:54,730
created a new variable
down here that I'm going

31
00:01:54,730 --> 00:01:57,470
to take out a little
extra white space here

32
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:03,210
I'm calling this one
sorted stage locations

33
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:06,250
you saw me do this
earlier in class where

34
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:10,030
I unpack a variable and
I go through things,

35
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:12,470
this is going to make
a series of strings.

36
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:15,750
This time, I start
with the distinct stage

37
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,750
locations that we
calculated up here,

38
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:22,670
and I'm going to go
in, and I'm actually

39
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:27,370
using the XSL sort in
here. This made a nice

40
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:29,650
safe space for me
to work this out and

41
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:32,310
check my work to make
sure it was it was

42
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:37,670
working so I said XSL
sort but we're gonna

43
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:42,490
do this based on the
XML tree we're gonna

44
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:46,890
go down find the stages
where the current

45
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:51,770
one where the where
the where attribute

46
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:54,470
equals the current
value we're gonna go

47
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:56,630
reach into the speeches
and count them.

48
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:02,250
And what xsl sort
does is it changes the

49
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:06,730
order of the output
based on the number

50
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:10,650
of counts. So this
value here is going to

51
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:14,250
determine the order
of the output of xsl

52
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:17,090
for each. I have to
output something or

53
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:20,150
this doesn't work. So
I say output the value

54
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:24,130
of the current
location at this point.

55
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:26,950
XSL sort is a little
bit of magic, just

56
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:29,990
like XPath sort, but
the way it's going

57
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:34,210
to work is like every
time the XSL foreach

58
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:36,230
runs, it's going
to grab a count

59
00:03:36,230 --> 00:03:39,770
value, and the output
of this foreach is

60
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:44,170
going to be determined
by the sort order,

61
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:46,850
which we've now made
based on a number.

62
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:51,190
okay I checked this in
an XSL comment because

63
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:53,610
I really wanted to
make sure that I had

64
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:56,550
a series of strings
that were based on my

65
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:59,630
sort order and I knew
that spaceship was

66
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:02,810
going to be the largest
one so when I run this

67
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:04,770
I'm going to like
make sure I save this

68
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:08,150
and run it I'm going
to go take a look at

69
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:12,150
my output and try to
move my zoom screen over

70
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:15,670
and you can see my
sorted stage locations

71
00:04:15,670 --> 00:04:19,010
are spaceship hallway
hospital and as soon

72
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:21,490
as i saw that i knew
this was what i wanted

73
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:24,210
um i wanted i did
that i want to look at

74
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:26,250
my output usually
when i'm about to plot

75
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:30,050
to make sure i i got
it right so i may have

76
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:32,830
been able to i i didn't
get this working in

77
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:34,930
the real for each
over this where i'm

78
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:37,510
plotting the g elements
but i did it up here

79
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:40,690
i'm going to use sorted
stage locations now

80
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:44,790
and when I began
plotting I changed this

81
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:48,050
from distinct stage
locations to sorted stage

82
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:50,490
locations and you'll
see that change when

83
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:54,400
I go to push my code
in a few minutes I'll

84
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:57,950
that this has changed
and now it's it's going

85
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:00,750
to be plotting these
in the sort order and

86
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,650
then I keep pretty much
everything else the

87
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:06,530
same except I needed
to remember to change

88
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:09,570
my stack that this like
change that variable

89
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:11,750
down here where I'm
doing the stacking

90
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:14,110
so instead of making
that based on distinct

91
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:16,730
stage locations I now
needed to use my new

92
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:19,350
variable as soon as
I did that I get the

93
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:24,270
output that I want and
I will switch my share

94
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:28,420
again to just show this
to you it all works

95
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:33,360
this is all working
the way I intended and

96
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:36,510
we've got the output
coming out sorting is

97
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:39,050
a little tricky but
now that you have one

98
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:42,510
that's working to use
as a model I hope that

99
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:44,350
you'll find this
helpful in your own code

100
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:48,350
okay so two videos
today and I hope this is

101
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:51,310
useful to you good luck
with the assignment

102
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:54,090
for next week I'm gonna
quickly look at that

103
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:56,570
while I'm on the zoom
with you let's go

104
00:05:56,570 --> 00:06:02,470
back here take a look
at assignments so this

105
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:04,990
is a little little
exercise for Monday to

106
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:07,030
introduce the new
regular expressions unit

107
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:09,610
but this very last
thing it's like kind of

108
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:12,470
our last hurrah for
this unit plotting svg

109
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:16,310
with xslt it's the small
test project i'm going

110
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:20,850
to invite you to go
over um choose some

111
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:24,750
xml to start with um
i was suggesting this

112
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:28,150
um like working the
vogue project team could

113
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:30,370
work with a collection
of their files but

114
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:33,410
you can kind of see um
some interesting things

115
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:38,270
here coded with rs you
could count materials

116
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:42,690
um fabrics garments
like find something

117
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:45,750
get counts of things
and count how many

118
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,930
there are of that type
so i'd suggest maybe

119
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:51,690
looking at colors or
something because this

120
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:54,470
team was really interested
in the colors like

121
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:56,750
what colors were
popular in a given era.

122
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:01,990
And you can count
the number of

123
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:04,670
things of a kind
that have variety,

124
00:07:04,670 --> 00:07:06,290
like what are the
different values

125
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:09,070
of color in this
chunk of code.

126
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:11,490
You can, if you're ready

127
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:13,070
to process a collection,

128
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:17,070
you could process the
collection of these

129
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:19,810
TEI files. I'm going
to prepare a mock-up of

130
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:21,850
that this weekend so
that you know how to

131
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:24,330
work with a collection
of XML instead of just

132
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:28,190
one file to make an
SVG plot but it's gonna

133
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:30,070
work essentially the
same way you sort of

134
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:33,830
drill into these files
count the number of

135
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:37,750
things that like that
represent a color and

136
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:42,510
output them so we'll
try that another option

137
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:44,910
you could look at is
the pokey this Pokemon

138
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:49,730
moves file which let
me see where did I put

139
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:55,390
that that's going to be
in what it's probably

140
00:07:55,390 --> 00:08:02,950
faster for me to get
to this fire text

141
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:06,190
analysis hub if I do
that from here I can just

142
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:08,050
show you where this
is my stuff's always

143
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:12,530
in class examples and
you will find an XSLT

144
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:16,030
to SVG here's a little
Pokemon on moves folder

145
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:19,850
and there's some pretty
simple xml in here

146
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:25,030
where every move element
has categories and

147
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:29,330
you could count up the
number of different

148
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:31,510
things that are like
that share the same

149
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:35,170
category um get a count
of those things and

150
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:38,310
then try to plot them
you know you know as the

151
00:08:38,310 --> 00:08:40,910
parts that make a
whole these are um this

152
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:43,090
is this is some good
data to help show that

153
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:45,630
so mess around you
don't have to use these

154
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:47,710
two files but I'm
suggesting that they might

155
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:52,070
be good for doing a
quick visual analysis

156
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:57,550
and see if you can make
some kind of SVG plot

157
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:59,750
that plots the parts
of a complete whole.

158
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:03,650
Alright, that's it.
I'm happy that finally

159
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:05,850
worked and I will
see you next week.
