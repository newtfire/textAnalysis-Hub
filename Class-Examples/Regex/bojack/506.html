Your mother's having another one

of her episodes.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=30" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="30">00:00:30</a>

<p>
Last night, she went to see <i>A Doll's House</i>

with a couple girlfriends,

and now she has ideas.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=35" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="35">00:00:35</a>

<p>
I emerged from my sanctum, this afternoon,

to discover that not only had she

not made me lunch,

which is a meal I need in order to live,

but she'd furthermore, locked herself

in the bedroom to weep... loudly.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=45" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="45">00:00:45</a>

<p>
Now, it's one thing for a woman to weep,

but when they do it at such a volume

you can hear it through the door,

then you know they're doing it

just for the attention.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=53" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="53">00:00:53</a>

<p>
Anyway, I was able to cobble together

a sandwich for myself,

so, I'm the real hero of the story.

<p>
It was a couple hours later

when I realized I was on a good run

with my novel.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=66" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="66">00:01:06</a>

<p>
I had this really interesting sentence

that kept going for pages and pages,

and I thought about how rare it is

to really get in the groove like that.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=73" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="73">00:01:13</a>

<p>
How, most days, I can't concentrate

because my idiot child

is blasting the television,

and it suddenly dawned on me;

hot cock on a rock,

she never even picked up

the little noise and snot factory!

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=83" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="83">00:01:23</a>

<p>
So, here I am, being your mother,

which I know is giving you all sorts

of mixed-up ideas about gender,

while your brain

is still loose and stupid.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=95" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="95">00:01:35</a>

<p>
Just remember,

if you become a queer later in life,

this isn't my fault!

</p>

<p>
Don't you sing no songs in your nightclub

act called, "My Daddy was My Mommy,"

while gazing longingly

at a tangled string of pearls.

</p>

<p>
You know Sunday is my writing day.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=114" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="114">00:01:54</a>

<p>
Sundays are the one day

that are just for me and my craft,

and still, you and the black hole

that birthed you

conspire to ruin it for me.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=122" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="122">00:02:02</a>

<p>
What am I supposed to do now?

Just go back to writing?

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=124" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="124">00:02:04</a>

<p>
I'm out of the zone now,

the whole day's shot!

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=127" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="127">00:02:07</a>

<p>
All because of you

and that brittle wisp of a woman

you made the mistake

of making your mother.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=133" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="133">00:02:13</a>

<p>
[sighs] No. It's not her fault.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=135" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="135">00:02:15</a>

<p>
She's doing the best she can, after all.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=137" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="137">00:02:17</a>

<p>
It's just that...

you can't depend on women.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=140" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="140">00:02:20</a>

<p>
You can't depend on anyone.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=142" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="142">00:02:22</a>

<p>
Sooner or later, you need to learn

that no one else

is gonna take care of you.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=145" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="145">00:02:25</a>

<p>
That's what I learned

when I had to make my own sandwich.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=148" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="148">00:02:28</a>

<p>
You can't rely on other people, BoJack.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=150" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="150">00:02:30</a>

<p>
It's good for you to know that.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=152" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="152">00:02:32</a>

<p>
And she's a good mother

for teaching you that.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=154" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="154">00:02:34</a>

<p>
You've got a head start on most kids.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=157" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="157">00:02:37</a>

<p>
You're actually very lucky.

</p>

<p>
[theme music playing]

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=221" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="221">00:03:41</a>

<p>
So, I stopped at a Jack in the Box,

on the way here,

and the girl behind the counter said,

"Hiya! Are you having an awesome day?"

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=228" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="228">00:03:48</a>

<p>
Not, "How are you doing today?"

No. "Are you having an awesome day?"

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=232" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="232">00:03:52</a>

<p>
Which is pretty shitty because it puts

the onus on me to disagree with her,

like if I'm not having an "awesome day,"

suddenly I'm the negative one.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=240" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="240">00:04:00</a>

<p>
Usually, when people ask how I'm doing,

the real answer is I'm doing shitty,

but I can't say I'm doing shitty

because I don't have a good reason

to be doing shitty.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=247" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="247">00:04:07</a>

<p>
So if I say, "I'm doing shitty,"

then they say, "Why? What's wrong?"

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=250" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="250">00:04:10</a>

<p>
And I have to be like,

"I don't know, all of it?"

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=253" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="253">00:04:13</a>

<p>
So instead, when people ask how I'm doing,

I usually say, "I am doing so great."

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=258" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="258">00:04:18</a>

<p>
But when this girl at the Jack in the Box

asked me if I was having an awesome day,

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=262" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="262">00:04:22</a>

<p>
I thought, well, today

I'm actually allowed to feel shitty,

today I have a good reason,

so I said to her, "Well, my mom died."

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=268" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="268">00:04:28</a>

<p>
And she immediately burst into tears.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=270" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="270">00:04:30</a>

<p>
So, now I have to comfort her,

which is annoying,

and meanwhile, there's a line

of people forming behind me,

who are all giving me

these real judgy looks

because I made

the Jack in the Box girl cry.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=279" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="279">00:04:39</a>

<p>
And she's bawling, and she's saying,

"I'm sorry, I'm so sorry,"

and I'm like, "It's fine. It's fine.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=284" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="284">00:04:44</a>

<p>
I mean, it's not fine,

but, you know, it's... fine.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=287" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="287">00:04:47</a>

<p>
And I would like to order

a Double Jack Meal,

and I've kinda got somewhere to be,

so maybe less with the crying

and more with the frying, huh?"

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=294" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="294">00:04:54</a>

<p>
[inhales] And the girl apologizes, again,

and she offers me a free churro

with my meal.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=299" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="299">00:04:59</a>

<p>
And as I'm leaving,

I think, "I just got a free churro

because my mom died."

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=304" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="304">00:05:04</a>

<p>
No one ever tells you when your mom dies,

you get a free churro.

I don't know, Mom, you got any ideas?

<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=389" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="389">00:06:29</a>

Knock once if you're proud of me.

{\an8}Can I just say how amazing it is

to be in a room with my mother,

and I can just talk without her telling me

to shut up and make her a drink?

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=404" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="404">00:06:44</a>

<p>
Hey, Mom. Knock once

if you think I should shut up.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=406" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="406">00:06:46</a>

<p>
I mean, I don't want to embarrass you,

by making this eulogy into a me-logy,

so, seriously,

if you wanted me to sit down

and let someone else talk, just knock.

I will not be offended.

<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=421" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="421">00:07:01</a>

<p>
She wanted an open casket,

but, you know, she's dead now,

so who cares what she wanted?

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=426" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="426">00:07:06</a>

<p>
I think that if she could've seen

what she looked like dead,

she'd agree it's better this way.

She looked like this.

<p>
Here's a story.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=461" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="461">00:07:41</a>

<p>
When I was a teenager,

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=462" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="462">00:07:42</a>

<p>
I performed a comedy routine

for my high school talent show.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=466" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="466">00:07:46</a>

<p>
There was this cool jacket

that I wanted to wear

because it would make me

look like Albert Brooks.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=470" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="470">00:07:50</a>

<p>
For months, I saved up for this jacket,

but when I finally had enough,

I went to the store and it was gone.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=475" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="475">00:07:55</a>

<p>
They had just sold it to someone else.

So, I went home and I told my mother.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=478" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="478">00:07:58</a>

<p>
She said, "Let that be a lesson.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=480" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="480">00:08:00</a>

<p>
That's the good

that comes from wanting things."

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=482" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="482">00:08:02</a>

<p>
She was really good

at dispensing life lessons,

that always seemed to circle back

to everything being my fault.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=488" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="488">00:08:08</a>

<p>
But then, on the day of the talent show,

my mother had a surprise for me.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=492" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="492">00:08:12</a>

<p>
She had bought me the jacket.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=493" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="493">00:08:13</a>

<p>
Even though she didn't know how to say it,

I knew this meant that she loved me.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=498" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="498">00:08:18</a>

<p>
Now, that's a good story about my mother.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=500" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="500">00:08:20</a>

<p>
It's not true,

but it's a good story, right?

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=502" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="502">00:08:22</a>

<p>
I stole it from an episode of <i>Maude </i>I saw

when i was a kid,

where she talks about her father.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=506" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="506">00:08:26</a>

<p>
I remember when I saw it,

thinking that's the kind of story

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=509" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="509">00:08:29</a>

<p>
I want to tell

about my parents when they die.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=512" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="512">00:08:32</a>

<p>
But I don't have any stories like that.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=514" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="514">00:08:34</a>

<p>
All I know about being good

I learned from TV.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=517" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="517">00:08:37</a>

<p>
And in TV, flawed characters

are constantly showing people they care

with these surprising grand gestures.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=522" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="522">00:08:42</a>

<p>
And I think that part of me

still believes that's what love is.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=526" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="526">00:08:46</a>

<p>
But in real life,

the big gesture isn't enough.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=528" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="528">00:08:48</a>

<p>
You need to be consistent,

you need to be dependably good.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=531" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="531">00:08:51</a>

<p>
You can't just screw everything up,

and then take a boat out into the ocean

to save your best friend,

or solve a mystery, and fly to Kansas.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=537" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="537">00:08:57</a>

<p>
You need to do it every day,

which is so... hard.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=541" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="541">00:09:01</a>

<p>
When you're a kid, you convince yourself

that maybe the grand gesture

could be enough.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=546" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="546">00:09:06</a>

<p>
That even though your parents

aren't what you need them to be,

over and over and over again,

at any moment they might surprise you,

with something... wonderful.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=555" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="555">00:09:15</a>

<p>
I kept waiting for that, the proof,

that even though my mother

was a hard woman,

deep down, she loved me

and cared about me

and wanted me to know

that I made her life

a little bit brighter.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=566" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="566">00:09:26</a>

<p>
Even now, I find myself waiting.

Hey, Mom, knock once if you love me

and care about me,

and want me to know I made your life

<p>
I was in the hospital with her

those last moments,

and they were truly horrifying,

full of nonsensical screams and cries,

but there was this moment,

this one instant of strange calm,

where she looked in my direction

and said, "I see you."

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=609" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="609">00:10:09</a>

<p>
That's the last thing she said to me.

"I see you."

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=612" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="612">00:10:12</a>

<p>
Not a statement of judgment

or disappointment, just acceptance

and the simple recognition

of another person in a room.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=619" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="619">00:10:19</a>

<p>
"Hello, there. You are a person.

And I see you."

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=623" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="623">00:10:23</a>

<p>
Let me tell you,

it's a weird thing to feel

at 54 years old,

that for the first time in your life

your mother sees you.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=629" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="629">00:10:29</a>

<p>
It's an odd realization that it's

the thing you've been missing,

the only thing you wanted all along,

to be seen.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=635" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="635">00:10:35</a>

<p>
And it doesn't feel like a relief,

to finally be seen.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=637" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="637">00:10:37</a>

<p>
It feels mean, like,

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=639" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="639">00:10:39</a>

<p>
"Oh, it turns out that you knew

what I wanted,

and you waited until the very last moment

to give it to me."

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=644" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="644">00:10:44</a>

<p>
I was prepared for more cruelty.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=646" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="646">00:10:46</a>

<p>
I was sure that she would get

in one final zinger,

about how I let her down,

and about how I was fat and stupid,

and too tall to be

an effective Lindy-hopper.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=654" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="654">00:10:54</a>

<p>
How I was needy and a burden

and an embarrassment.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=658" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="658">00:10:58</a>

<p>
All that I was ready for.

I was not ready for "I see you."

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=663" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="663">00:11:03</a>

<p>
Only my mother would be lousy enough

to swipe me

with a moment of connection

on her way out.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=668" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="668">00:11:08</a>

<p>
But maybe I'm giving her too much credit.

Maybe it wasn't about connection.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=672" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="672">00:11:12</a>

<p>
Maybe it was a... Maybe it was

an "I see you," like, "I see you."

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=677" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="677">00:11:17</a>

<p>
Like, "You might have the rest

of the world fooled,

but I know exactly who you are."

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=681" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="681">00:11:21</a>

<p>
That's more my mom's speed.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=684" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="684">00:11:24</a>

<p>
Or maybe she just literally meant

"I see you.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=687" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="687">00:11:27</a>

<p>
You are an object

<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=691" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="691">00:11:31</a>

<p>
She was out of it at the end,

so maybe it's dumb

to try to attribute it to anything.

<p>
I was in a very famous TV Show

called <i>Horsin' Around.</i>

</p>

<p>
And I remember one time, a fan asked me,

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=704" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="704">00:11:44</a>

<p>
"Hey, um, you know that episode

where the horse has to give Ethan

a pep talk,

after Ethan finds out his crush

only asked him to the dance

because her friends were having

a dorkiest date contest?

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=714" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="714">00:11:54</a>

<p>
In all the shots of the horse,

you can see a paper coffee cup

on the kitchen counter,

but in the shots of Ethan,

the coffee cup's missing.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=722" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="722">00:12:02</a>

<p>
Was that because the show

was making a statement,

about the fluctuant subjectivity of memory

and how even two people

can experience the same moment

in entirely different ways?

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=732" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="732">00:12:12</a>

"No, man, some crew guy

just left their coffee cup in the shot."

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=739" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="739">00:12:19</a>

<p>
So instead, I was, like... "Yeah."

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=743" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="743">00:12:23</a>

<p>
And maybe this is like that coffee cup.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=745" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="745">00:12:25</a>

<p>
Maybe, we're dumb to try to pin

significance onto every little thing.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=749" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="749">00:12:29</a>

<p>
Maybe, when someone says,

"I see you," it just means, "I see you."

<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=754" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="754">00:12:34</a>

<p>
Then again, it's possible

she wasn't even talking to me.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=757" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="757">00:12:37</a>

<p>
Because, if I'm being honest,

she wasn't really looking at me,

she was looking past me.

There was nobody else in the room.

<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=762" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="762">00:12:42</a>

<p>
I think she was talking to me,

but, honestly,

she was so far gone at that point,

who knows what she was seeing.

</p>

My dad died about ten years ago

of injuries he sustained during a duel.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=783" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="783">00:13:03</a>

<p>
When your father dies,

you ask yourself a lot of questions.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=786" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="786">00:13:06</a>

<p>
Questions like,

"Wait, did you say he died in a duel?"

and "Who dies in a duel?"

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=791" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="791">00:13:11</a>

<p>
The whole thing was so stupid.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=792" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="792">00:13:12</a>

<p>
Dad spent his entire life

writing this book,

but he couldn't get any stores

to carry it,

or any newspapers to review it.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=799" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="799">00:13:19</a>

<p>
Finally, I guess this one newspaper

thought he was pretty hilarious,

because they ran a review

and tore him to shreds.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=805" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="805">00:13:25</a>

<p>
So, my father, ever the Proud Mary,

decided he would not stand

for this besmirchment of his honor.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=809" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="809">00:13:29</a>

<p>
He claimed the critic didn't understand

what it meant to be a man,

so he demanded satisfaction

in the form of pistols at dawn.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=816" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="816">00:13:36</a>

<p>
He wrote the paper, this letter,

saying anyone who didn't like his book,

he would challenge to a duel,

anyone in the world.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=822" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="822">00:13:42</a>

<p>
He'd even pay for airfare

to San Francisco and a night in a hotel.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=825" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="825">00:13:45</a>

<p>
Well, eventually this found its way

to some kook in Montana,

who was as batshit as he was

and took him up on the offer.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=830" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="830">00:13:50</a>

<p>
They met at Golden Gate Park and agreed:

ten paces, then shoot.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=834" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="834">00:13:54</a>

<p>
But in the middle of the ten paces,

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=836" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="836">00:13:56</a>

<p>
Dad turned to ask the guy if he'd actually

read the book and what he thought,

but, not looking where he was going,

tripped over an exposed root

and bashed his head on a rock.

</p>

I don't know why she said that.

Maybe she felt that's the kind of thing

you're supposed to say at a funeral.

<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=875" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="875">00:14:35</a>

Maybe she hoped one day

Or maybe she knew

that he had frittered away

all her inheritance,

and replaced it with crippling debt,

which is a pretty shitty thing

to leave your widow with.

But it makes us small,

and stupid, and petty.

I actually had a near-death experience,

recently.

<p>
A stunt went bad

and I fell off a building.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=1103" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1103">00:18:23</a>

I'm on this new show <i>Philbert.</i>

I'm Philbert. Star of the show.

<p>
It hasn't come out yet,

but it's already getting Emmy buzz.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=1111" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1111">00:18:31</a>

<p>
I've to take

two of these every morning,

but my days are so screwed up

'cause of the shooting schedule,

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=1118" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1118">00:18:38</a>

<p>
I don't even know

what morning means anymore.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=1120" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1120">00:18:40</a>

<p>
There's a joke in there somewhere,

about a guy

who's been to so many funerals,

he doesn't even know

what mourning means anymore.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=1126" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1126">00:18:46</a>

<p>
Let you guys figure that one out

for yourselves. [gulps]

<p>
Anyway, you know what I thought...

when I was falling off the building

and I went into panic mode?

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=1134" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1134">00:18:54</a>

<p>
The last thing that my stupid brain

could come up with before I died?

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=1139" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1139">00:18:59</a>

<p>
"Won't they be sorry."

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=1142" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1142">00:19:02</a>

<p>

<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=1143" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1143">00:19:03</a>

<p>

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=1144" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1144">00:19:04</a>

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=1146" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1146">00:19:06</a>

<p>
I don't even know what "they"

I wanted to be sorry.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=1149" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1149">00:19:09</a>

<p>
My mom, even before she died,

could barely remember who I was.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=1152" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1152">00:19:12</a>

<p>
And of course, my dad's dead.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=1154" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1154">00:19:14</a>

<p>
The last conversation I ever had with him

was about his novel.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=1157" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1157">00:19:17</a>

<p>
He was so certain

this book was his legacy.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=1159" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1159">00:19:19</a>

<p>
Maybe he thought it would vindicate him

for all the shitty things he ever did

in his stupid worthless life.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=1165" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1165">00:19:25</a>

<p>
Maybe it did. I don't know.

I never read it.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=1167" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1167">00:19:27</a>

<p>
Because why would I give him that?

<p>
I used to be on this TV show

called <i>Horsin' Around.</i>

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=1173" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1173">00:19:33</a>

<p>
Seriously, hold your applause.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=1175" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1175">00:19:35</a>

-[man coughs]

-Well held.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=1177" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1177">00:19:37</a>

<p>
It was written by my friend Herb Kazzaz,

who's also dead now,

and it starred this little girl

named Sarah Lynn.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=1183" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1183">00:19:43</a>

<p>
And it was about these orphans.

And early on, the network had a note,

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=1186" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1186">00:19:46</a>

<p>
"Maybe don't mention

they're orphans,

because audiences tend

to find orphans sad and not relatable."

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=1192" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1192">00:19:52</a>

<p>
I never thought the orphans were sad.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=1193" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1193">00:19:53</a>

<p>
I always thought they were lucky

because they could imagine their parents

to be anything they wanted.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=1199" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1199">00:19:59</a>

<p>
They had something to long for.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=1201" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1201">00:20:01</a>

<p>
Anyway, we did this one season finale,

where Olivia's birth mother comes to town.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=1204" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1204">00:20:04</a>

<p>
And she was a junkie,

but she's gotten herself cleaned up,

and she wants to be

in Olivia's life again.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=1209" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1209">00:20:09</a>

<p>
And of course, she's like a perfect

grown-up version of Olivia,

and they go to the mall together

and get her ears pierced,

like she's always wanted and--

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=1216" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1216">00:20:16</a>

<p>
Sorry, spoiler alert for the season six

finale of <i>Horsin' Around,</i>

if you're still working

your way through it.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=1222" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1222">00:20:22</a>

<p>
Anyway, the horse tries

to warn her, "Be careful,

moms have a way of letting you down."

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=1226" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1226">00:20:26</a>

<p>
But Olivia just thinks

the horse is jealous,

and when the mom says

she's moving to California,

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=1232" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1232">00:20:32</a>

<p>
Olivia decides to go with her.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=1234" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1234">00:20:34</a>

<p>
And the network really juiced

the cliffhanger:

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=1236" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1236">00:20:36</a>

<p>
''Is Olivia gone for good?''

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=1239" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1239">00:20:39</a>

<p>
But of course, because it's a TV show,

she was not gone for good.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=1241" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1241">00:20:41</a>

<p>
Of course, because it's a TV show,

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=1243" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1243">00:20:43</a>

<p>
Olivia's mother had a relapse

and had to go back to rehab,

so Olivia had to hitchhike

all the way home,

getting rides from Mr. T,

Alf, and the cast of <i>Stomp.</i>

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=1252" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1252">00:20:52</a>

<p>
Of course that's what happened.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=1253" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1253">00:20:53</a>

<p>
Because, what are you gonna do,

just not have Olivia on the show?

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=1257" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1257">00:20:57</a>

<p>
You can't have happy endings in sitcoms,

not really,

because, if everyone's happy,

the show would be over,

and above all else,

the show... has to keep going.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=1266" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1266">00:21:06</a>

<p>
There's always more show.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=1268" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1268">00:21:08</a>

<p>
And you can call <i>Horsin' Around </i>dumb,

or bad, or unrealistic,

but there is nothing more realistic

than that.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=1274" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1274">00:21:14</a>

<p>
You never get a happy ending,

'cause there's always more show.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=1279" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1279">00:21:19</a>

<p>
I guess until there isn't.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=1281" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1281">00:21:21</a>

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=1283" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1283">00:21:23</a>

<p>
My mom would hate it if she knew

that I spent so much time at her funeral

talking about my old TV show.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=1289" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1289">00:21:29</a>

<p>
Or maybe she'd think it was funny

that her idiot son

couldn't even do this right. Who knows?

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=1293" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1293">00:21:33</a>

<p>
She left no instructions

for what she wanted me to say.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=1296" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1296">00:21:36</a>

<p>
All I know is she wanted an open casket,

and her idiot son

couldn't even do that right.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=1301" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1301">00:21:41</a>

<p>
I'll stand up here and pretend

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=1303" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1303">00:21:43</a>

<p>
I understood

how to please that woman,

even though so much of my life has been

wasted in vain attempts to figure it out.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=1308" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1308">00:21:48</a>

<p>
But I keep going back to that moment

in the ICU when she looked at me, and...

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=1312" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1312">00:21:52</a>

<p>

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=1314" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1314">00:21:54</a>

<p>
"I... see... you."

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=1319" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1319">00:21:59</a>

<p>
Jesus Christ,

we were in the intensive care unit.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=1323" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1323">00:22:03</a>

<p>
She was just reading a sign.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=1327" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1327">00:22:07</a>

<p>
My mom died and all I got

was this free churro.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=1332" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1332">00:22:12</a>

<p>

about all of this?

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=1334" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1334">00:22:14</a>

<p>
Is when that stranger behind the counter

gave me that free churro,

that small act of kindness

showed more compassion

than my mother gave me

her entire goddamn life.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=1343" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1343">00:22:23</a>

<p>
Like, how hard is it to do something nice

for a person?

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=1346" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1346">00:22:26</a>

<p>
This woman at the Jack in the Box

didn't even know me.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=1350" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1350">00:22:30</a>

<p>
I'm your son.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=1351" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1351">00:22:31</a>

<p>
All I had was you!

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=1355" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1355">00:22:35</a>

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=1357" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1357">00:22:37</a>

<p>
I have this friend.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=1358" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1358">00:22:38</a>

<p>
And right around when I first met her,

her dad died, and I actually went with her

to the funeral.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=1364" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1364">00:22:44</a>

<p>
And months later, she told me

that she didn't understand

why she was still upset,

because she never even liked her father.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=1371" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1371">00:22:51</a>

<p>
It made sense to me, because I went

through the same thing when my dad died.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=1374" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1374">00:22:54</a>

<p>
And I'm going through the same thing now.

You know what it's like?

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=1377" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1377">00:22:57</a>

<p>
It's like that show <i>Becker,</i>

you know, with Ted Danson?

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=1379" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1379">00:22:59</a>

<p>
I watched the entire run of it,

hoping that it would get better,

and it never did.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=1384" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1384">00:23:04</a>

<p>
It had all the right pieces, but it just--

It couldn't put them together.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=1386" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1386">00:23:06</a>

<p>
And when it got canceled,

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=1387" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1387">00:23:07</a>

<p>
I was really bummed out,

not because I liked the show,

but because I knew it could be

so much better,

and now it never would be.

And that's what losing a parent is like.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=1397" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1397">00:23:17</a>

<p>
It's like <i>Becker.</i>

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=1399" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1399">00:23:19</a>

<p>
Suddenly, you realize you'll never have

the good relationship you wanted,

and as long as they were alive,

even though you'd never admit it,

part of you,

the stupidest goddamn part of you,

was still holding on to that chance.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=1413" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1413">00:23:33</a>

<p>
And you didn't even realize it

until that chance went away.

</p>
<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=1416" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1416">00:23:36</a>

I will never have a mother

<a href="https://www.netflix.com/watch/80200247?t=1426" class="timestamp" target="_blank" data-time="1426">00:23:46</a>
