Hmm.

Hey.

Ah, but <location>Paris</location> would make a tres bon site for the next Olympic Games.

And why is that?

We don't have to explain ourselves to the likes of you!

I await your reply.

I recommend <location>Moscow</location>, where the American dollar buys seven rubles.

<stage> Pager Beeps </stage>

Twelve rubles.

<stage> Beeping Continues </stage>

Sixty rubles. I ,000 rubles! I must go!

I suggest Motown.

<location>Detroit</location>.

No, no. <location>Mongolia</location> Town- home of the Motown sound.

<location>Bangkok</location>!

People! People! Please.

You are forgetting what the Olympics are all about- giving out medals of beautiful gold... so-so silver and shameful bronze.

<stage> All Murmuring </stage>

<stage> Woman </stage> It's so true.

I have here a letter from a little girl named <fam><person>Lisa</person></fam> Simpson.

She says her town might not be important enough to host the Olympics... but she asks if the torch could just pass by... so she can experience the glow that we feel every day.

Well, I say we don't bring her the torch.

I say we bring her... the Olympic Games!

Who is with me?

<stage> Cricket Chirps </stage>

Well, I don't care. It's my decision.

<location>Springfield</location> was shocked today to learn it will host the next Olympics.

Economists predict our city will experience the same boom... that <location>Sarajevo</location> enjoyed after the I 984 Games.

And it's all because of your letter, <fam><person>Lisa</person></fam>.

Well, actually, I just wrote it for a school assignment.

Everyone else wrote to the Backstreet Boys.

To honor the arrival of our foreign friends- and enemies-

Channel 6 is sponsoring a contest to find a <location>Springfield</location> Olympic mascot.

The winner will join such other memorable mascots... as the <location>Atlanta</location> whatsit and the <location>Montreal</location> vampire.

A mascot contest? I'm sure to win that- unless one of you jinxes me.

No one's gonna jinx you, <fam><person>Homer</person></fam>. In fact, we're rooting for you.

Yeah. Go for the gold, Dad.

Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

Well, you said I couldn't do it, but here it is.

Meet Abby, the Olympic Tabby!

<stage> <fam><person>Bart</person></fam> </stage> How'd you get the eyes to move?

<stage> Plaintive Meowing </stage>

<stage> Gasps </stage> You papier-mached my cat?

Just for the prototype, honey.

<stage> Meows </stage>

<stage> Hisses </stage>

<stage> Yelps </stage>

Knowing you always hate my first idea, I prepared a backup.

How about a big Olympic hello for Springy- the <location>Springfield</location> spring!

<stage> <fam><person>Bart</person></fam> </stage> Those aren't the dog's eyes, are they?

Hey, that's cute.

Good work, Dad.

It's fun for the whole family.

And the ends are razor sharp- to protect our nation and its interests.

Ow!

God bless <location>America</location>.

<stage> Spray Can Rattles </stage>

Oh, Cinnamon, don't make this harder than it already is.

Bravo, <location>Springfield</location>.

I have never seen such a clean sewer.

<stage> Chuckles </stage>

And we are positively inspired by your solar power plant.

Yes. Love that sun, man.

We will do anything, including but not limited to anything... to make your stay here tolerable.

Yes. You'll be completely above the law.

Uh, women, g*n, cash- whatever you need. It's yours.

<stage> Man </stage> Ach du Lieber.!

And that's not all.

We've just chosen our official Olympic mascot.

<stage> Crowd Oohs and Aahs </stage>

<stage> Gasps </stage> They picked Springy!

In your face, <person>Patty</person> and <person>Selma</person>!

Well, we still love you, Ciggy.

Yeah.

Mmm! That glue really gives it a pop.

And now, because the children are our future... here are the children of <location>Springfield Elementary</location>... with a song they call "The Children Are Our Future."

It gives me great pride to officially declare... the next Olympics will be held right here in-

Wait! Wait! We have one more act.

The patriotic comedy stylings of <fam><person>Bart</person></fam> Simpson!

<stage> Man </stage> Oh, fine.

Thank you, thank you.

So, uh, you're from <location>Russia</location>, huh?

Da.

You drunk yet?

Da.

<location>Poland</location>, eh? <stage> Chuckles </stage> Too easy.

How ya doin', <location>Germany</location>? Here's my impression of an <location>East</location> German woman.

I'm not thinking that.

Hey, Swiss miss. There's no missin' you, babe.

Lay off the cocoa.

<stage> Laughter </stage>

Now I'd like to say one last thing to our Olympic representatives.

If there was a medal for horrible audiences, you'd get the gold.

Well, it really did seem funny in rehearsal.

And he didn't even get to his Ubangi routine.

<stage> Laughing </stage>

Ha, ha, ha. Laugh it up, ya punks.

'Cause you and Jan Murray here just cost our town the Olympics.

Hey, Chalmers. Where are you from?

Huh?

Well, I was born in <location>Queens</location>, went to Ball State... then made the move to lntercourse, <location>Pennsylvania</location>.

Uh, why do you ask?

Don't worry, sir.

I'll teach these children some respect for their town.

I'm assigning each of you 20 hours of community service.

<stage> Groaning, Grumbling </stage>

Community service?

No, no!

Intercourse?

What if we refuse?

You won't pass to the next grade.

I fail to see the thr*at.

<person>Skinner</person>! Good idea.

Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to my vacation at <location>Lake Titicaca</location>.

Let's see you make a joke out of that, Mr. Smart Guy.

All right, Martin. For your community service... you'll be setting up a midnight basketball program for inner-city street gangs.

All right, g*ng. Shirts and skins.

Let's hustle.

<stage> g*n </stage>

<stage> Tires Screeching </stage>

<person>Milhouse</person>, do you like the beach?

Who doesn't?

Good.

I want you to pick up all this medical waste... that's washed up on the shore here.

Ow! I pricked myself.

Well, just keep working.

You'll prick yourself with the antidote sooner or later.

<stage> Sighs </stage>

What are ya gonna do to me?

<fam><person>Bart</person></fam>, not all community service... is g*ng warfare and dangerous infection.

And to illustrate that point, here's where you'll be working.

The fireworks, candy and puppy dog store?

<stage> Puppies Yipping </stage>

No, no, no. Next to it.

Settle a bet. Boil or mole?

Where do you think you're goin'?

<stage> Gulps </stage>

Oh, no. Lise, they got you too?

Oh! I got a bingo! What do I win?

A banana.

A whole one?

Yep.

That's the prize? A banana?

Their natural mushiness prevents choking and promotes regularity.

They're not babies, <fam><person>Lisa</person></fam>. Give 'em something fun- like cigars or booze.

We tried giving them eggnog at Christmas... but it led to widespread "de-shawling."

Well, that's what they get for wearing such tight little shawls.

Oh!

<stage> Chuckles </stage>
Okay. 4:00. Nap time.

That place sucks. The nurses don't let <fam>Grampa</fam> do anything.

They practically chew his food for him.

Lucky stiff. I'm workin' my ass off here.

Good steak, honey.

The elderly aren't like you or me, <fam><person>Bart</person></fam>.

They thrive on consistency, predictability... and a life with no surprises.

But we lost the Olympics to <location>Shelbyville</location>.

Yeah, but I should have no problem selling a thousand springs.

To who?

Idiots.

Ooh! These are fun.

Oh, Rhett! Rhett!

Oh, Rhett. Where will I go?

What'll I do?

Frankly, my dear-

<stage> Different Male Voice </stage> I love you. Let's remarry.

Ahh. That's sweet.

What a lovely ending.

They cut out the best word.

Didn't that movie used to have a w*r in it?

Come on, you. You've been warned.

Picture yourself on a beautiful sailboat.

<stage> Waves Lapping, Gulls Crying </stage>

Ah. Can't you just feel the sea breeze in your hair?

<stage> Man </stage> Oh, boy.

Say, I hear a foghorn.

I see Petey and Blackie and Schnoodle.

Oh, no! Pirates!

I'm just trying to liven things up around here.

These people need to ride motorcycles and play rockin' electric guitars... like the old people on TV.

Excuse me. But when those pirates boarded...

I swallowed my wedding ring for safekeeping.

Get me some ipecac. I'd like to expunge it.

<stage> Sighs </stage>

Okay, she's gone. Let's break out of here and have some fun.

Shouldn't we ask someone first?

If I get up, somebody will take my chair.

Got that right. It's the only one left with padding.

<stage> All </stage> Padding.

<stage> Sighs </stage> What about you, Chief?

Don't you wanna be free like the eagle?

Oh, I don't live here. I'm just dropping off Indian casino pamphlets.
