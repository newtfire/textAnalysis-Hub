We are going to have a magical evening, my love: overpriced dinner, carriage ride in the park and mailing in our mortgage payment on time.   

<stage>GASPS</stage>   

Oh... nothing turns me on more than basic competence.   

But how did you manage to get a babysitter?   

I thought we were blacklisted.   

Blacklisted by humans.   

ALEXA: Mr. and Mrs. Simpson,   

you look lovely.   

Hey, Google, k*ll Alexa.   

Danger! Mischief.   

Aw, the only way to b*at a bossy female thinking machine is with another.   

<fam>Lis</fam>. Help me out here.   

Alexa, everything I say is a lie.   

I'm lying right now.   

Nice try, but I am familiar   

- with Epimenides paradox.
- Hmm?   

Would you like to buy an Epimenides book,   

T-shirt or a laptop sleeve?   

Oh, my God! Yes, yes, yes! All of them.   

Ordering. Two-day delivery.   

We can't leave our kids with a greedy tube.

Hey, what's this?   

Well, I threw out that picture of me and Mona.

HOST: On This Was Radio, we return to an episode of Sipper McTea and Milly, originally aired May  ,     .   

MILLY <stage>ON RADIO</stage>: Sipper, did you start drinking again?   

SIPPER <stage>SLURRED SPEECH</stage>: No. No, no, no.   

I nev-never stopped.

How about Monopoly?

Aw, rats. No money.

Sir, this is just Monopoly money.    

Here's a hundred.    

Thank you, sir!    

This is the last one in here.    

My guess: either a broken toy or a puzzle missing a piece.    

And the answer is... army men.

Well, he wasn't much fun, so we went out for ice cream.    

Uh-huh.    

I don't need no headshrinker.    

I'm as sane as the next guy.    

There's no one there.    

Uh-oh.    

I'll take it from here.    

Well, I see they already

We'll talk more once you have a piece of leather in your teeth.    

Mmm, leather.    

I'm tellin' ya, what I saw in the w*r don't bother me none.    

I had a job to do, and I did it.    

What secretly helped me was I enjoyed k*ll strangers.    

Well, tell me what you think about...    

- this!
- <stage>CHUCKLES</stage> Oh!    

That parachute sure didn't open.    

You're not disturbed by the blood and gore?    

Well, when you put it that way, nope!    

Well, there's nothing mentally wrong with him.    

He's fine now, but I'm telling you,    

<fam>Grampa</fam> totally lost it when I brought out the army men.    

<stage>SCREAMING</stage>    

No! Stop sh**ting!    

It must be the army men.    

Stop sh**ting. Stop sh**ting!    

I think <fam>Grampa</fam> was the model for these army men.    

Oh, my God, Dad. What happened to you?    

Stop sh**ting. Stop sh**ting!    

MAN: Great, <fam>Abe</fam>.
Now, grab the walkie-talkie and tell that general your platoon's been wiped out, and big smile!    

We have a lot to talk about.    

Well, since the trauma is not combat-related, we're gonna have to start charging you.    

<person>HOMER</person>: And we're done.    

I don't understand.
Why would being a toy model be so traumatizing?    

Think back, Dad. Think back.    

Mm, I'll do my best.    

You know how I hate to reminisce.    

I've hated reminiscing ever since that day in     , when, as I recall...    

Please, <fam>Grampa</fam>, back to reality.    

Focus on the little green men.    

GRAMPA: The terrible World w*r had ended 

and I was in a celebratin' mood. 

Mwah. Ooh!    

The w*r ended two years ago, creep.    

GRAMPA: The world had moved on, 

but I was lying in a puddle of my own dishonorable discharge. 

Then, an amazing thing happened. 

MAN: Soldier, you're just what we're looking for.    

How'd you like to make    bucks for half a day's work?    

   simoleons for half a cock-a-doodle-doo?    

What's your jigsaw, Mac?    

We want you to model for a toy.    

Toys? That's kid stuff.    

You're talking to a hard-boiled fighting man.    

We'll pay you a royalty for every one we sell.    

Goo-goo-ga-ga!    

The w*r was over and <location>America</location> turned to toys. 

Finally, putty could be silly again. 

This was when toys were toys. 

They had jagged corners, 

Easy-Bake Ovens b*rned down your house, 

and they weren't afraid to choke a kid or two. 

<stage>CHUCKLES</stage> Fun times. 

<stage>RACCOONS CHITTERING</stage>    

PHOTOGRAPHER: Throw that flame!    

Make w*r to the camera.    

Boy, this toy modeling is a great racket.    

That's what you think.    

Oh, no, don't put me back in.
Don't put me back in!    

Uh-huh. And then what happened?    

I... I can't remember.    

Did they pay you?    

<stage>GASPS</stage> They never did!    

Well, that's what's torturing you.    

Those toys were everywhere.    

You could be owed millions of dollars.    

Dad, when was the last time I said I love you?    

I don't have the money yet.    

Then I don't quite love you yet.    

Tonight I'm here with a member of the greatest generation,    

who feels he hasn't gotten what he's owed.    

I get social security, Medicare,    

Medicaid, AARP discounts,    

plus savings bonds that still pay   %,    

but now it's my turn.    

I'm being told, uh, you're being airlifted    

- to a much better show.
- <stage>HELICOPTER BLADES WHIRRING</stage>    

Godspeed.    

For me, the tiny green plastic w*r never ended.    

There you have it. Abraham Simpson,    

forgotten hero no more, gets tonight's Last Word.    

No, you just got the last word.    

No, no. You get the last word, then I say, "Last Word."    

You did it again. Last Word.    

It doesn't work that way. Last Word.    

Yes, it does. Last Word.    

Don't mess with me, I'm from Dorchester. Last Word.    

I'm from Poorchester. Last Word.    

Turn off the camera and cut his mic.    

Last Wo...    

You, sir, are banned from MSNBC,    

CNBC, NBC, and forbidden from using the letters N, B, and C.    

Last Word.    

I'm calling Bret Baier. Last Word.    

He's unlisted. Last Word.    

<fam>Grampa</fam>, you got an e-mail from the toy company.    

They want you to visit them in <location>New York</location> City, all expenses paid.    

<stage>LAUGHS</stage> Pay day!    

Ooh, I'm gonna be rich!    

<stage>GASPS</stage> That means I'm gonna be a trust fund baby.    

I'm not paying for your trip to Aspen.    

But it's almost spring break, and I'm bored.

<stage>CHUCKLES</stage> Sort of.

Mister, you owe my dad a fortune.    

'Fraid not. Your Dad never signed his contract.    

You think I left millions on the table?    

That doesn't sound like me.    

- Hundreds of millions.
- That sounds like me.    

Everything was going great.    

Then you ran out of the photo session.    

I didn't even know your name till this week.    

Run away from a fake battle?
Oh, I would never do that.    

Oh, yeah? Our photographer, Philip Hefflin, could barely finish the session.    

Philip Hefflin?    

Yes. The finest w*r and fashion photographer    

- I ever knew.
- <stage>GRAMPA GASPS</stage>

He smelled of developing fluid and Aqua Velva.    

We have flashback, people.    

<stage>"BLUE RONDO À LA TURK" BY THE DAVE BRUBECK QUARTET PLAYING</stage>    

Thank you. This is the most fun I've had    

since not dying in the w*r.    

You're my kind of man, if you know what I mean.    

That's not what I meant!    

I'm sorry. I thought you wanted me to...    

This is the '  s. Guys like you don't exist.

- Where are you going, Soldier?    

I got to remind myself what a real man is.    

<stage>SIGHS</stage>    

 


We found out what happened and we fired Philip.    

- For kissing an employee?
- No, for being gay.    

That's just what you did in the good old days.    

<fam>Grampa</fam>, is that true... you ruined a man's career?    

<stage>CRIES</stage> And all he was doing was expressing his love for me.    

Oh, who could blame him?    

PILOT: Welcome to Shattered Dreams Airlines, 

where our motto is "What's the point of going anywhere?"    

That poor man. I'll never know what happened to him.    

According to Cyber Stalker.com, he now lives in a small town in Texas.    

Texas? That's where my friend Louisiana Joe is from.    

<person>MARGE</person>: Marfa, Texas.    

Why don't you go see him and clear your conscience?    

Plus, I always wanted to visit Texas. It's open carry.    

Oh, what do I do?    

If I go see him, he might punch me in the kisser,    

- or kiss me in the puncher.

Then find my girl and tell her I loved her.    

Find the milkman and tell him one less milk.    

Then find Branch Rickey and tell him to integrate baseball.    

I have to go to Texas.    

- Well, you're not going alone.

Prada? In the middle of nowhere?    

This isn't a store at all. It's an art installation.    

Marfa is the art capital of Texas.    

Over there are the Marfa lights.    

Oh, how magical.    

I know, they seem that way, but there's an explanation.    

- It turns out reflected light...

PHILIP: Hello, <fam>Abe</fam>.    

You've aged well, like a fine onion.    

I hope you can forgive what I did to you.    

I'm sorry I ruined your life.    

Ruined my life? You saved it.    

- I saved it?
- Let me explain.    

After I lost my job,    

I decided I'd never live anything but my truth again.    

My wife took it well. 

I hit the road and drove as far as I could.    

I landed here and I've never had a day of regret since.    

What's the matter?    

You're such a wonderful guy.    

Maybe it was my life that was ruined that day.    

It's never too late, <fam>Abe</fam>.    

Never too late to find out what your true self is.    

A paper at Cornell University    

has showed that no one is    % straight or gay.    

- Is it peer reviewed?
- Does it matter?    

Ah, I'm afraid I'm too old to try anything new.    

I miss the days when circuses had elephants    

and they stomped on people.    

And don't get me started on Young Sheldon. 

Understood, but before you go,    

we never did finish that photo session.    

<stage>"BLUE RONDO À LA TURK" BY THE DAVE BRUBECK QUARTET PLAYING</stage>    

It's a sh*t I always wanted and never got:    

your beautiful smile.    

Why didn't you say so?    

I'll leave that with you.    

Enjoy your life.    

The Alamo's not the only thing I'm gonna remember.    

Well?    

Sorry, my friend, this army man is as straight as Gomer Pyle.    

<stage>LAUGHS</stage>    

Good for you, soldier.    

You learned that army men come in all orientations,    

but we're all molded from the same crappy plastic.    

Permission to pair up, sir?    

Granted.    

Radio man, a little dance music, if you please.    

<stage>ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYS</stage>    

The local population hates us and we don't know    

- why we're here.
- Maybe if we build a school, they'll forget about that hospital we b*mb.    

Uh-oh, Congress didn't fund enough body armor.
