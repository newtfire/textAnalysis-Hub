<fam><person>Homer</person></fam>, is it too late to change babysitters?

None!

Aren't you going to chuckle?    

An inguinal hernia is no laughing matter.    

<stage>CHUCKLES</stage>    

"Inguinal."    

Will I need surgery?    

Possibly. But don't be alarmed.    

It's just some scalpel work around your scrotum.

Honey, I signed us up for physical therapy this afternoon.    

They sound terrific.    

Even booking the appointment, they told me, "Great job."    

Absolutely.    

I want to get better.    

I really do.

We'll start tomorrow.    

Mwah.

It's me, your hernia.    

<fam><person>Homer</person></fam>, your doctor told you to listen to your body.    

And I am telling you, just take it easy.    

Are you sure?

Is it this?    

No. All I can say is, if you have a muscle and you know what it does, then that is not the co-ah.    

Oh, the core. 

Right, that's what I said... co-ah.    

Now, what sports are we gettin' you ready for, <fam><person>Marge</person></fam>?    

Rollerblading? Uh, Muay Thai?    

No, nothing like that.    

I only have to be in good enough shape to take care of an immobile    -pound man.    

Ah, so <fam><person>Homer</person></fam> isn't coming, eh?    

You know, I could go to him at work.    

Oh, he's got enough stress at work.    

All right, well, we'll get you into something.    

Uh, mountain biking? Free bouldering?    

I got it. <fam><person>Marge</person></fam>, we are going to get you kitesurfing!    

Kitesurfing?

Yeah, ruining people's day at the beach.

They're just setting themselves up to meet my buddies    

Torn ACL and Pinched Nerve.    

Now, you, you're smart.    

The most strenuous thing you're gonna do is fart "The Star Spangled Banner."    

Mm, that's got a difficult range.    

Is there an easier anthem?    

Hey, the riskiest thing we're gonna do is have lasagna.    

We just had lasagna.

Dimitri Nigelovonovitch.

I guess I didn't want to know.
