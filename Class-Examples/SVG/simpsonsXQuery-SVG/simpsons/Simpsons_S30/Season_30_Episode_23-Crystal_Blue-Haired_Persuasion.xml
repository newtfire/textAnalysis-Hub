Whee!  

Uh-oh. Aah!

<catchphrase>D'oh</catchphrase>!  


Sir, I've prepared your year-end finance report.  

Initiate ocular scan mode.   

Illuminate... and recalibrate.   

Gah! Unthinkable! The horror!   

This is the first year my earnings are lower than the year before.   

I'm sorry, sir.   

These days, enlightened people like solar, and the consciously evil prefer fracking.   

<stage>SPUTTERS</stage> Wh-Why, if this continues, in     years I'll be out on the street.   

Sir, sir, sir, I'm sure there's some sort of inessential line item   

- that no one will miss.
- Mm-hmm.   

Effective immediately: children's health care will be cut from workers' benefits.   

<stage>BOOING</stage>   

This meeting is over. God bless <location>the United States</location> of <location>America</location> and release the hounds.   

<stage>BARKING</stage>   

Oh, I got three kids, and they've all got health.   

I am so cursed.   

That's what you get for having a family.   

<stage>CHUCKLES</stage> I'm gonna die like I lived:   

nice and lonely.   

<stage>CHUCKLES</stage> Sweet.   

Maybe we can get the kids government health care.   

Oh, sorry, <fam><person>Marge</person></fam>, that's gone, remember?   

Because of those corporate tax cuts we all wanted?   

I didn't want them.   

<stage>LAUGHS</stage>: You say so now, but I remember you back then.   

<stage>HIGH-PITCHED VOICE</stage>: "Ooh, corporate tax cuts. Makers not takers."   

Oh, every time Ann Coulter has a cold, you think she's me.   

I'm sorry, honey. We'll just have to cut back on the kids' meds.   

Back in my day, children didn't need no meds!   

You just gave 'em a slug of whiskey and sent 'em off to school.   

And if they lost their snowshoe, you'd b*at 'em with the other one!   

That's how we raised the generation that lost <location>Vietnam</location>.   

<fam><person>Bart</person></fam>, your old attention deficit disorder medicine isn't covered by insurance anymore, so we'll have to use a cheaper drug that's just as good.   

So goodbye, Focusyn.   

Hello, Chillaxodol.   

Mm.   

Mom, I was just on hypochondria.edu, and I think you should see something.   

Are you giving your precious child 

the generic ADD medication Chillaxodol? 

Yes. Why?   

Your child may experience unwanted side effects, 

including headaches... 

... painful spasms... 

<stage>BABBLING</stage>   

... dry mouth... 

<stage>GASPS</stage> Ah.   

- ... and whiskers...
- Mm!   

... musical flatulence... 

<stage>FARTING RHYTHMICALLY</stage>   

... involuntary Memphis juking...

... sudden relocation... 

<person>MARGE</person>: Hmm? Mm.   

... and a symptom that can only be described 

as "dolphining." 

<stage>SQUEAKING</stage>   

<stage>GASPS</stage>   

If you or a loved one 

is experiencing any of these side effects, 

you would do well to remember 

that life is heartless and brutal, 

and the cosmos is indifferent to us all. 

I'd say goodbye, but what's the point? 

<stage>HORN HONKS</stage> 

- <stage>TIRES SCREECH</stage>
- <stage>THUD</stage> 

Without insurance, we'll just have to go to...   

<stage>SIGHS</stage> <person>Dr. Nick</person>.   

Sorry, everybody.   

Remember, if at any time you become a dog, then I can medicine you.   

No hope. There's no hope here.   

Hmm. "The healing magic of crystals."   

<stage>SIGHS</stage> Well, I've tried everything else.   

Shalom, kind queen.   

I mean the "hello" shalom, but also the "peace" one.   

How can I soothe you?   

Wow. That was a lot just now.   

But yet it's only a snippet of the cosmic conversation.   

Look, my son is having bad side effects from his ADD meds.    

His father wants him to join football for a nice, calming concussion.    

I have just the thing for you.    

Crystals?    

Healing crystals.    

I am pretty desperate.    

Crystals are a timeless database of energy, knowledge and sparkling.    

Scientists are finally waking up to what pyramids have known all along.    

<stage>LIKE DRACULA</stage>: I vant to suck your money.    

Uh, maybe I could just buy a couple rocks and go.    

Oh, they're more than rocks.    

They make great stocking stuffers.    

And for Hanukkah?    

Uh, useless.    

<stage>SCRAPING NEARBY</stage>    

<person>MARGE</person>: Hey.    

<fam><person>Bart</person></fam>, it's time for your ADD treatment.    

Aah... aah, aah, aah.    

Hmm, maybe he's a little overtrained.    

It's not a pill.    

Ooh, a suppository.    

Fill 'er up.    

It's not a drug.    

I want you to try these.    

Hmm...

"A" paper by <fam><person>Bart</person></fam>.    

An "A"? Oh, my gosh, <fam><person>Bart</person></fam>!    

Could it really be the crystals?    

Yes, definitely the crystals.    

You really got an "A"?    

No white-out.    

The answers are actually correct.    

Maybe he really did the work.    

Or maybe he cheated, and I have to find out how.    

Whoa! Someone could use a chill-out crystal.    

It's made by your boyfriend, <fam>Lis</fam>, the <location>Earth</location>!    

<fam><person>Lisa</person></fam> has a boyfriend?    

And this is how I find out?    

I don't know which of you two is dumber.    

So I'm a bit of a mystery, huh? Huh?    

<stage>SCHOOL BELL RINGING</stage>    

<fam><person>Marge</person></fam>, I heard <fam><person>Bart</person></fam> got an "A."    

- How'd you do it?
- Can you keep a secret?    

Unless it's about a person, yes.    

It was crystals.    

Crystals, huh?    

I could use some of those for Kirk.    

I want to seed the bed with them, so he doesn't crawl over to me.    

No worries. I'll pick up more on my way home.    

Oh, no, what happened?    

I'm closing the store.
A cot finally opened up in this cult I've been trying to get into.    

Congratulations, I guess.    

Can I still buy crystals?    

Just take 'em.    

In fact, you can have my entire inventory.    

Thank you.    

Now, enter my chariot to Heaven.    

Are you sure about this?    

Of course! I'm ascending to a higher level of being.    

Now, sisters, let us Sharpie in the whites of our eyes.    

<stage>SHARPIES SQUEAKING</stage>    

<person>MARGE</person>: Oh, wow.    

"Before passing on to a new owner,    

"crystals should be cleared of their old energy with a combination of water and sulfur."    

Which is just what comes out of our tap!    

The crystals got Kirk a new job.    

With a uniform!    

That's right, I'm a batboy.    

<stage>CHUCKLES</stage>    

<person>Nelson</person> got an "A" on his test!    

This is going right up on the refrigerator in the front yard.    

<fam><person>Marge</person></fam>, we need more crystals.    

<person>MARGE</person>: I'm not even    % sure these things work.    

Should I really be selling them? 

You know, these just might make me stop drinking.    

I guess I should.    

I'm gonna grind 'em up and snort 'em.

<fam><person>Marge</person></fam>, another "A" in my class for <fam><person>Bart</person></fam>.    

I'm so impressed that a boy with <fam><person>Bart</person></fam>'s jiggly-wigglies  could be cured by this pagan hogwash.    

You can't argue with facts.    

Oh, dear, we're running low on obsidian.    

Almost out of moon potion.    

And there's no more brain powder.    

I can sell you brain powder in bulk.    

Here's whose brain the powder is from.    

It's a cow, but a very smart one.    

Hmm. What else do you sell?    

Oh, massage stones, copper bracelets, dream catchers, dream catcher filter replacements.    

This old one is full of dreams.    

I don't see anything in it.    

Don't you see it? Your dream of being a massive success?    

You see it? Right there. See it?    

- Mm-mmm.
- Right there. See it?    

I think I am starting to see it.    

Are you sure? Do you really?    

I see it!    

Yeah, okay, bring it down.    

Less Oprah, more Chopra.    

I see it. I guess I could expand my product line.    

Then I can really start making my own money, not be dependent on <fam><person>Homer</person></fam>.    

Did I hear "not dependent on <fam><person>Homer</person></fam>"?    

Boom. Retired.    

You should still go in to work.    

I don't think I even remember how to get there.    

You were just there today.    

<stage>ELDERLY VOICE</stage>: Feels like that, doesn't it?

I'm sorry, <fam><person>Marge</person></fam>,    

I'm gonna have to shut you down.    

You don't have a retail business license.    

Well, Chief, do I really need a license to sell that hemp body lotion Sarah likes so much?    

And which is free to you?    

Ooh, I like it, too!    

But I'm gonna need more than that.

Yeah, but what's the point of that?    

I'm telling Dad.    

Not today. I got my book club.

I learned Swedish to read this here book, and we are gonna discuss it.    

Nordic noir is known for its plain language and absence of metaphors.    

Dig deeper.    

<stage>STAMMERS</stage> The novel reflects, implicitly and explicitly, gaps between rhetoric and practice in Swedish policy.
