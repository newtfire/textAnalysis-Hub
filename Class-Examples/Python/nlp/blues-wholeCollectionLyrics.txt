Woke up this mornin' when chickens was crowin' for day

But not someone to light the fire
No not the way she used to do
You lose the things that made it
What it was when it was new
And once you've got them
You've always got the blues
That new love only can replace
Just so much of you
That leaves a lot that gets lost between
Number one and number two
In time well you may find someone else
That can comfort you
But not someone to light the fire
No not the way she used to do

Look over yonder's wall and a hand me down my walkin' cane
Look over yonder's wall and a hand me down my walkin' cane

So you look on yonder's wall and hand me down my walkin' cane

I worry all day I worry all night
Every time my man comes home he wants to fuss and fight
When I pick up the paper to read about the news
just as I'm satisfied yonder comes the blues
I went down to the river each and every day
Trying to keep from crying' and do my self away
I walked and walked till I wore out my shoes
I can't walk no further yonder comes the blues
Some folks never worry things all go all right
Or lay down on that sofa weep and cry all night
When I get a letter it never brings good news
Every time I see the mail babe yonder comes the blues
Go back blues don't come this way
Oughta give me something else beside the blues all day
Every man I love I've been refused
And when I want some loving yonder comes the blues
People have different blues and think their mighty bad
But blues that bother me are the worst I've ever had
I've been disgusted and all confused every time I look around yonder
come those blues
The blues the blues the yodling blues
They seem to haunt me all the time
Because that I ain't got no one
That will console my mind
It seems to me no happiness will I ever find
No happiness will I find
Lord lord lord lord
Lord lord lord lord
My man went out without a cause
I wonder who put them jinx
on me I said them jinx on me
I wonder who put them jinx on me lowdown jinx on me
My man's gone back to his used-to-be
I'm gonna yodel yodel my blues away I said my blues away
I'm gonna yodel yodel my blues away ee-ooo I'm gonna yodel
Till things come back my way
I've got the blues go spread the news
I've got those doggone yodling blues
Lord when you get home baby please write me a few of your lines
Lord when you get home baby sit down and write me a few of your lines
Lord that'd be consolation Lord mama to my worried mind
Lord I left my baby standing in our back door cryin'
Lord I left my baby standing alone in our back door cryin'
Lord I never felt so sorry no honey till she said goodbye
Lord I'm going down to the river I'm gonna sit on the ground
You know I'm going down to the river baby I'm gonna sit on the ground

You're a like an old horse shoe that's had its day

You ain't got no money you are down and broke
You're just an old has-been like a worn-out joke

Get your hands on your money mine all while you're gone

Willie the Wimp was buried today
they laid him to rest in a special way
Sent him off in the finest style
that casket-mobile really drove 'em wild
Southside Chicago will think of him often
talkin' 'bout Willie the Wimp and his cadillac coffin
Willie the Wimp and his cadillac coffin
That casket it looked like a fine Seville
he had a vanity license and a cadillac grille
Willie was propped up in the driver's seat
he had diamonds on his fingers and a smile sweet
Fine red suit had the whole town talkin'
talkin' 'bout Willie the Wimp and his Cadillac coffin
Willie the Wimp and his cadillac coffin
Oh cadillac to heaven he was wavin' the banner
he left like he lived in a lively manner
With a-hundred dollar bills in his fingers tight
he had flowers for wheels and a-flashin' headlights
He been wishin' for wings no way he was walkin'
talkin' 'bout Willie the Wimp and his cadillac coffin
Yeah Willie the Wimp and his cadillac coffin
I hear these women raving 'bout their monkey men
About their trifling husbands and their no good
friends
These poor women sit around all day and moan
Wondering why their wandering papa's don't come home
But wild women don't worry wild women don't have no blues
Now when you've got a man don't never be on the square
'Cause if you do he'll have a woman everywhere
I never was known to treat no one man right
I keep 'em working hard both day and night
'Cause wild women don't worry wild women don't have their blues
I've got a disposition and a way of my own
When my man starts kicking I let him find another home
I get full of good liquor walk the streets all night
Go home and put my man out if he don't act right
Wild women don't worry wild women don't have their blues
You never get nothing by being an angel child
You better change your ways and get real wild
I wanna tell you something I wouldn't tell you a lie
Wild women are the only kind that really get by
'Cause wild women don't worry wild women don't have their blues
Honey baby won't you cuddle near
just sweet mama whisper in your ear
I'm wild about that thing it makes me laugh and sing
give it to me papa I'm wild about that thing
Do it easy honey don't get rough
from you papa I can't get enough
I'm wild about that thing I'm wild about that thing
everybody knows it I'm wild about that thing
Please don't hold it baby when I cry
give me every bit of it or else I'll die
I'm wild about that thing ja da ging ging ging
all the time I'm cryin' I'm wild about that thing
What's the matter papa please don't stop
don't you know I love it and I want it all
I'm wild about that thing just give my bell a ring

If you want so satisfy my soul

I'm wild about that thing gee I like your ting-a-ling

Come on turn the lights down low

I'm wild about that thing my passions got the fling
come on hear me cryin' I'm wild about that thing
I just don't know what's this all about
What is it all about boys
I just don't know what's this all all about
The woman I love is tryin' to put me out
She said she didn't want me why should I hang around
Hey why should I hang around
And that if I hang around I would be jail house bound
I love that woman more than she will ever know
Yes I love her
Hey baby more than you will ever know
But if you drive me away I won't be back no more
I just stole that woman stole her from my best friend

He's 'bout to get her back again
Why not why not darling

You all have been wonderin' wonderin' why I sing the blues
You all have been wonderin' wonderin' why I sing the blues
Yeah you just listen and say you're me instead of you
Ah you won't to or you do get married to someone for the rest of your life
Ah you won't to or you do get married to someone for the rest of your life
Yes and there is always someone else whenever you out of sight
You get the affection of a servant the kindness of a slave
You get the affection of a servant the kindness of a slave
Yeah you get the love of a dog that can't even hear a word you say
I try to say something people something just to pacify
I try to say something people something just to pacify
I might not have lived right all of my life but people please believe me I've tried
Why get up why get up
How can I get up why should I get up
This whole world's gone crazy
Think I've seen enough
I'm gonna sleep forever why get up
Phone keeps ringing right off the hook
Some bill collector I know what cooks
Think I'll stay in bed dream all day
World outside bugs me anyway
When I get things going the going gets rough
So I ask myself why get up
Chorus
Went to the doctor he said lose some weight
If you don't do it quick we'll have to operate
I talked to my lawyer he said case is closed
That woman got it all even the garden hose
Staring at the ceiling thinking just my luck
Better roll back over why get up
Chorus
Well I can't quit drinking I'm nervous all the time
When I wake up it's like a ton lead on my mind
What was it I said to that girl last night
She really got upset I best stay out of sight
I remember a gun and calling somebody's bluff
I better duck under the cover why get up
Chorus
Chorus
Why don't you live so God can use you anywhere Lord anytime
Why don't you live so God can use you anywhere Lord anytime
Why don't you think so God can use you anywhere any time
Why don't you think so God can use you anywhere Lord any time
Why don't you walk so God can use you anywhere Lord any time
Why don't you walk so God can use you anywhere Lord any time
Why don't you moan so God can use you anywhere Lord any time
Why don't you moan so God can use you anywhere Lord any time
Why don't you sing so God can use you anywhere Lord any time
Why don't you sing so God can use you anywhere Lord
I wonder why why do everything have to happen to me

Well I'm blue and I'm lonesome my heart is filled with misery
Oh so many strange things they happen to me all day long
Oh so many strange things they happen to me all day long

Tillie Brown was a dancing fool
Spent her time in a dancing school
When the band would play
Tillie would start right in to sway
First one out on the ballroom floor
She never got enough she just craved for more
When she start to sway
All the girls and boys would say
Whoa Tillie take your time
Whoa Tillie take your time
There ain't no use to hurrying 'cause you wanna prance

I cover the waterfront watchin' the ship go by
I could see everybody's baby but I couldn't see mine
I could see the ships pullin' in to the harbor
I could see the people meetin' their loved one
Shakin' hand I sat there
so all alone coverin' the waterfront
And after a while all the people
left the harbor and headed for their destination
All the ships left the harbor
and headed for their next destination
I sat there coverin' the waterfront
And after a while I looked down the ocean
as far as I could see in the fog I saw a ship
It headed this way comin' out the foam
It must be my baby comin' down
And after a while the ship pulled into the harbor
rollin' slow so cripple
And my baby stepped off board
I was still coverin' the waterfront
Said "Johnny our ship had trouble with the fog
And that's why we're so late so late
Comin' home comin' down'
I've lived a life but nothin' I've gained
Each day I'm full of sorrow and pain
No one seems to care enough for poor me
to give me a word of sympathy
Oh me Oh me Wonder what will become of poor me
No father to guide me no mother to care
Must bear my troubles alone
Not even a brother to help me share
This burden I must bear alone
Oh me Oh me Wonder what will become of poor me
I'm settin' and thinkin' of the days gone by
They filled my heart with pain
I'm too weak to stand and too strong to cry
But I'm forgittin' it all in vain
Oh me Oh me Wonder what will become of poor me
I've traveled and wandered almost everywhere
To git a little joy from life
Still I've gained nothin' but wars and despairs
Still strugglin' in this world of strife
Oh me Oh me Wonder what will become of poor me
I read your ad this morning you said you want a real good man
I read your ad this morning you said you want a real good man
Now I'm here with you baby I want to know your plan

Every night I wander all by myself
Every night I wander all by myself
Thinkin' about the woman I love lovin' someone else
Boo-hoo I just can't keep from cryin'
Boo-hoo I just can't keep from cryin'
I'm worried about my baby she's on my mind
Sometimes I wonder do she think of me
Sometimes I wonder do she think of me
And again I wonder if I will ever be free
I'm tellin' all you women what's on my mind
I'm tellin' all you women what's on my mind
I never love one woman no more at a time
Boo-hoo I wring my hands and cry
Boo-hoo I wring my hands and cry
I'm thinking about the lovin' that I let go by
Since you've been gone baby I haven't been a bit of good
Since you've been gone baby I haven't been a bit of good
Because I never get the loving that I really should
The tar in the street starts to melt from the heat and the sweats runnin' down from my hair I walked miles and I'm dragging my feet and I'll walk more I don't care
And I'll wander this world wander this world Wander this world wander this world all alone
I'm like a ghost some people can't see others drive by and stare A shadow that drifts by the side of the road it's like I'm not even there
And I'll wander this world wander this world Wander this world wander this world all alone
Well I've never been part of the game the life that I live is my own All that I know is that I was born to wander this world all alone all alone
Some people are born with their lives all laid out and all their success is assured Some people work hard all their lives for nothin' They take it and don't say a word they don't say a word
Sometimes it's like I don't even exist even God has lost track of my soul Why else would he leave me out here like this to wander this world all alone
And I'll wander this world wander this world
Wander this world wander this world all alone
A wall of denial is fallin' down
Wo it's fallin' so hard own to the ground
Never knew something so strong could be washed away by tears
but this wall of denial was just built on fear
We've all had our demons from the garden of white lies
dressed them amused them pullin' wool over our eyes
Go so far as to love them to keep from letting them go
all the while they we're killin' us but we couldn't let it show
No matter what the trouble we carry round inside
we're never safe from the truth but in the truth we can survive
When this wall of denial comes tumblin' down
down to the ground
Simple things in life bring the greatest pleasure
a smile a kiss a little baby's laughter
It makes no difference if we run away in fear
the little things in life hold us so near
No matter what the trouble we carry round inside
we're never safe from the truth but in the truth we can survive
When this wall of denial comes tumblin' down
Yeah this wall of denial must tumble down
Down to the ground
Woke up this morning up this morning
With my head bowed down hey hey hey

Nobody feels like there beholding to anyone
They don't feel there's no more lessons to be learned
But when you rub two
together
Somebody's got to burn
But if you love somebody with all your might
You might have to fuss you might have to fight
Resign yourself there's nothing you can do
You're gonna have to let 'em two time you

Did you read about the flood
It happened long time ago in a little country town way back in Mississippi
It rained and it rained it rained both night and day
The people got worried they began to cry
"Lord have mercy where can we go now"
There were women and there was children screaming and crying
"Lord have mercy and a great disaster who can we turn to now but you"
The great flood of Tupelo Mississippi
It happened one evenin' one Friday evenin' a long time ago

The people of Tupelo out on the farm gathering their harvest
a dark cloud rolled way back in Tupelo Mississippi hmm hmm
Wasn't that a mighty time

A little town called Tupelo Mississippi

For you baby I would swim the sea

and not even worry about getting hurt
I would work hours days a week
just so I can come home and kiss your cheek
I love you in the mornin' and I love a-you at noon
I love you in the night take you to the moon
Lain to buy my burnin' money that I've earned

Never gets served before it's time
Baby be true to me
Like I'm true to you

Went down to Albert's Alley
Pick up on me a Collins mix
Went to the bar an' ordered me a drink
Tried to relax myself
Looked around and saw two soul sisters
They were sippin' sodas
And the other look caught their companions
On the dance floor
They were doin' the Collin's shuffle
Pretty soon a cute little number
Came and asked me to do the stomp polka
I told her I couldn't do the stomp polka
I could show her how to do the Sissy
We were on the dance floor
And I was doin' my thing
After a while out of nowhere
Up walks her boyfriend
While she's standin' there doin' the shivers and shake
He gave me a look that was very icy blue
And believe me he made me thaw out
I said to myself "Albert don't lose your cool"
By that time I'd gotten hungry
'Cause I smelled someone cookin' catfish
Oughta be something along with some greens
Told him definitely I didn't want no leftovers
The cook took so long about fixin' my grub
I had to go see what was takin' him so long
He was back there jivin'
I had to tell him to get it together
He asked me "Can't you wait"
Made me mad I said "No man I ain't got time
I've got to keep on pushin'
I got to make it down the soul road
Got to go do some turnin' on"
Don't want person give me no dyin' food
So I'm leavin' town goin' home
I've got homesick anyway
I'm leavin' this place before I freeze
Goin' home to defrost
Ain't gonna have me lookin' like a snow cone
I don't know he's gettin' rough
Took the car and drove off the hills
Saw the flashing lights and saw them die
Left behind society that kills
Me and Nancy waved them all goodbye
Took the car the sun was going down
Saw the changing colors of the sky
An old Apache canyon out campground
Secure and safe together made us sigh
Took the car and filled the trunk with wood
Took it back and made of it a fire
To be a child again would be so good
Me and Nancy warm in our desire
Took the car and drove it everywhere
Through the land where all the West began
Desert wind was blowing in our hair
Me and Nancy running hand in hand
Well I laid down last night too tired to wake I had a chill this mornin' too tired to shake I got a good poker hand too tired to win I can hear my baby callin' too tired to let her in
Well I'm tired yes I'm tired babe Too tired now too tired for anything
Too tired to walk too tired to run I can hear my baby knockin' Too tired Too tired Too tired babe yes I'm tired Too tired now Too tired for anything Break it down now
Too tired of prosperity too tired o' luck
I'm sittin' on a pin I'm too tired to get up
Well I'm tired yes I'm tired babe
Too tired now
Too tired for anything I'm tired babe
Too many dirty dishes in the sink for just us two
I said too many dirty dishes in the sink for just us two
You got me wonderin' baby

Too many dirty dishes in the sink just for us two
Well you got me wonderin' baby
Who's makin' dirty dishes with you
Spoken:
Look at this kitchen
Pots an' pans ev'rywhere it's pitiful
Look at all these glasses layin' all up on the sink
Looks like she even had a party up in here too
You wait 'til I see this woman when she get home
That glass over there got a cigar in it or sump'in

Gettin' all this stuff under my fingernails
Run some more water in here

Yeah that's pretty clean now though
Now I got all this now I gotta work on these pots a little bit more
Makes me so mad I don't know what to do
Thought I was her husband 'stead a maid
Like ol red chili or somethin' all done got dried up on all these pots
She never fix me none of this good food
You wait 'til that woman get home I'm scrappin' all these pots for her
Sings:

How much am I suppose to take

Went down to Tin Pan Alley see what was going on
Things was too hot down there couldn't stay very long
Hey hey hey hey alley's the roughest place I've ever been
All the people down there livin' for their whisky wine and gin
I heard a woman scream yeah and I peeked through the door
Some cat was workin' on Annie with a Lord with a two-by-four
Hey hey hey hey alley's the roughest place I've ever been
All the people down there livin' for their whisky wine and gin
I heard a pistol shoot yeah and it was a
Somebody killed a crap shooter cause he didn't shake rattle and roll
Hey hey hey hey alley's the roughest place I've ever been
All the people down there killin' for their whisky wine and gin
I saw a cop standin' with his hand on his gun
Said "This is a raid boys nobody run"
Hey Hey Hey alley's the roughest place I've ever been
Yeah they took me away from tin pan alley
And took me right back to the pen
Caught up in a whirlwind can't catch my breath
knee deep in hot water broke out in a cold sweat
Can't catch a turtle in this rat race
feels like I'm losin' time at a breakneck pace
Afraid of my own shadow in the face of grace
heart full of darkness spotlight on my face
There was love all around me but I was lookin' for revenge
thank God it never found me would have been the end
I was walkin' the tightrope steppin' on my friends
Walkin' the tightrope it was a shame and a sin
Walkin' the tightrope between wrong and right
Walkin' the tightrope both day and night
Lookin' back in front of me in the mirror's a grin
through eyes of love I see I'm really lookin' at a friend
We've all had our problems that's the way life is
my heart goes out to others who are there to make amends
We've been walkin' the tightrope tryin' to make it right
Walkin' the tightrope every day and every night
Walkin' the tightrope bring it all around
Walkin' the tightrope from the lost to found
Walkin' the tightrope stretched around the world
Walkin' the tightrope save the boys and girls
Walkin' the tightrope let's make it right
Walkin' the tightrope do it do it tonight
Walkin' the tightrope
One night while sleeping in my bed I had a beautiful dream
That all the people of the world got together on the same wavelength
and began helping one another
Now in this dream universal love was the theme of the day
Peace and understanding and it happened this way
The sick the hungry had smiles on their faces
the tired and the homeless had family all around
The streets and the cities were all beautiful places
and the walls came tumblin' down
People of the world all had it together
had it together for the boys and the girls
And the children of the world look forward to a future
Remember
Tick tock tick tock tick tock people time's tickin' away
Remember that
Tick tock tick tock tick tock people time's tickin' away
I had a vision of blue skies from sea to shining sea
all the trees in the forest stood strong and tall again
Everything was clean and pretty and safe for you and me
the worst of enemies became the best of friends
People of the world all had it together
had it together for the boys and the girls
Children of the world look forward to a future
Remember
Tick tock tick tock tick tock people time's tickin' away
Remember that
Tick tock tick tock tick tock people time's tickin' away
Remember that remember that
Remember that remember that
People of the world all had it together
had it together for the boys and the girls
Children of the world look forward to a future
Remember
Tick tock tick tock tick tock people time's tickin' away
Remember that
Tick tock tick tock tick tock people time's tickin' away
All you girls think the days are gone
You don't have to worry you can have your fun
Take me baby for your little boy
Three hundred pounds of heavenly joy
This is it

'Cause you got you a man that you don't like
Throw that Jack baby outta your mind

Three hundred pounds of muscle and man

Look what you get
I have sent a letter away 'cause my man and I don't agree
There's no reason why he should treat me this way
'Cause the way I worry I will soon be old and grey
Don't want to do nothing that's wrong
But can't stand this treatment long
I just lay and suffer crying sighing all night long
'Cause the way that I'm worried Lordy it sure is wrong
All night long all night long
It's this one man on my mind
Can't sleep a wink at night from crying
All night long got my worries just renewed
And I suffer with those all night blues
I remember way back in nineteen and twenty-nine
I had plenty woman then money
But I very much short in mind
But if I could just go back
And start my life brand new
Well well I would control myself more better
Woo well well I would know just what to do
Used to spend a hundred dollars just to have a big name
I used to spend a hundred dollars just to have a big name
Well well if my woman asked me for ten dollars
Woo well well I'd give her twenty and say "Keep the change"
Now people used to be so nice to me
I often wondered why
But now it's just "Hello Slim"
As they keep walkin' by
But If I could just go back
And start my life brand new
Well well I would control myself more better
Woo well well because I know just what to do
Yes yes yes yes
In those days I had plenty to loan or either give
Now in those days I had plenty to loan or either give
Well well but now things are a lot different
woo well well from the life that I used to live

You want me to try and forget you
Well I'll do
Baby I'll do the best I can
You know it hurts you when you're in love with someone and you know that someone don't love you It carries a heavy burden on your heart to know that the someone that you're in love with is in love with your best friend And I'll tell you when someone else is rocking you rocking your cradle you know better than you can rock your cradle yourself then there's only one thing for you to do You just pack your clothes turn around and slowly walk out of the door Look over your left shoulder as you go out then you hang your head and you say:
Oh please don't try to tell me
Uh huh I think I understand
No no no no
Please don't try to tell me
Because you think you think I understand
Oh you want me to try
To try to forget you baby
And I'll tell you I'll do the best I can
You know after you have done all you could do and you can't take no more then you go downtown you get your big baseball bat and you come back on the scene where they both are still together and then you just go and kick down the door Now as you kick down the door you just start beating the hell of everybody that you can see everybody that comes through the door and just as you make up your mind that you're gonna try to forgive her then out comes another one of your friends and that really blows your mind So you go and think about you say to yourself baby I realize I've done wrong but please forgive me And with a smirky smile on her face then she look up at you and she say
If you ever think about me
Oh I think about you baby
If you ever charge your mind
Oh you're staying on my mind baby
If you ever think about me
Oh I think I think about you all the time
And if I ever cross your mind
You stay on my mind
Well you know you know
You know I'm yours
And I know I know you got to be mine
Yeah
There's something on your mind B
I can tell by the way you look at me
Oh there's something on my mind Miss James
There's something on your mind
Oh can you tell there's something on my mind
By the way you look at me
Oh the way I look at you you look good to me
And what you're thinking brings happiness
Yes baby
Oh and it can bring misery
Yes all right
If your whole life somehow
Wasn't much 'til now
And you've almost lost
Your will to live
No matter what you've been through
Long as there's breath in you
There is always one more time
And if your dreams go bad
Every one that you've had
That don't mean that some dreams
Can't come true
'Cause it's funny about dreams
As strange as it seems
There is always one more time
Oh turnin' corners
Is only a state of mind
Keeping your eyes closed
Is worse than being blind
If there's a heart out there
Looking for someone to share
I don't care if it's been
Turned down time and time again
And if we meet one day
Please don't walk away
'Cause there is always one more time
There is always one more time
The thrill is gone the thrill is gone away
The thrill is gone baby the thrill is gone away
You know you don't me wrong baby but you will be sorry someday
The thrill is gone it's gone away from me
The thrill is gone away from me
Although I'll still live on but so lonely I'll be
The thrill is gone it's gone away for good
The thrill is gone baby it's gone away for good
Someday I know I'll be over it all baby just like I know a good man should
You know I'm free free now baby I'm free from your spell
Oh I'm free free free now I'm free from your spell

She pulled me in with her lip but I

And get myself out of this jam

Move way out in the woods

Preacher takes up collection
And say brother what will you pay
I think I'll move to the jungle
Move way out in the woods
Yes because the way things are here now
Well I ain't doin' myself no good
They call me the hunter that's my name
A pretty woman like you is my only game
I bought me a love gun just the other day
And I aim to aim it your way
Ain't no use to hide ain't no use to run
'Cause I've got you in the sights of my love gun
The first time I saw you standing on the street
I says to myself "Woo ain't she sweet"
I've got my love gun loaded with hugs and kisses
And when I pull the trigger there will be no misses
Ain't no need to hide ain't no use to run
'Cause I've got you in the sights of my love gun
Ain't no use to hide ain't no use to run
'Cause I've got you in the sights of my love gun

The time has come I got to hit the road again

'Cause I travel with a passion and the highway is my lady friend
You see the highway's like a woman soft shoulders an' dangerous curves
You see the highway is like a woman like a woman soft shoulders an' dangerous curve
If you don't know her when you start travelin' boy she can really upset your nerves
But if you respect her when she warns you I swear the highway treat you fine
But if you respect her when she warn you I swear the highway'll treat you fine
When she's wet an' she's slippery then watch out for the detour

Spoken:
I remember when I was snowed in and up at old Shire town
I'm sure the next tour take me right back through that town
Snow was up to your shoulders man and that ain't no lie
Chicago wasn't so cold it would make a polar bear cry
Now when you hear the people talk about their bird called the hawk
Now I'm gonna tell ya somethin' that'll make you let out a squawk
Spoken:
Now where I live the weather's mostly warm
We don't have to worry about no snow or if we have a storm
But Shire town sits on the shores of a lake
and when that hawk flaps his wings it make you shiver an' shake
Now when you hear the people talk about their bird called the hawk
Man I'm tellin' ya one thing they just let out a squawk
Spoken:
But man you should a been there in the winter of '
You couldn't catch a cab down on State and Lake
Now you know that's bad 'cause that's right in the heart of town
And it was so bad the mayor had to close the whole town down
Now when you hear the people talk about their bird called the hawk
Oh man I tell you tell you let out a squawk
Gone are the days I'm holding you tight
Gone are the times I thrill with delight
Oh how I've missed you and your tender kiss I've been a fool too long
I took your love then broke my heart
Can you forgive me we'll make a new start
Guess life ain't worth living if you ain't giving I've been a fool to long
I've played the field but could not conceal
The way I feel about you
Everyone guessed I had no happiness loving you the way I do
You carried my heart around in your hand
Yes I still love you please understand
Life ain't worth living if you ain't giving I've been a fool to
long
All you people you know the blues got a soul
Well this is a story a story never been told
Well you know the blues got pregnant
And they named the baby Rock & Roll
Muddy Waters said it you know the blues got a soul
James Brown said it you know the blues got a soul
Well the blues had a baby and they named the baby rock & roll
Ray Charles said it you know the blues got a soul
John Lee Hooker said it you know the blues got a soul
Well the blues had a baby and they named the baby rock & roll
Otis Redding said it you know the blues got a soul
Queen Victoria said it you know the blues got a soul
Well the blues had a baby and they named the baby Rock & Roll
My baby gives me love
As good as love can be
I just leave her crying
When the blues come over me
Up on a mountain
I'm drowning in the sea
All the clocks say midnight
When the blues come over me
The blues come over me
I pack it up and go
The blues come over me
I catch the wind and blow
And some will take the wine
And some will take the night
When everything's all wrong
Then anything is all right
Some put in a song
And some sing it for their dues
Some go to sleep and wake up
Tangled in the blues
The blues come over me
I pack it up and go
The blues come over me
I catch the wind and blow
The blues come in a whisper
And make you scream and shout
And you'll do most anything
Just to let them out
I may think I'm happy
I may think I'm free
Nothing don't mean nothing
When the blues come over me
The blues come up behind
The blues wait up ahead
The blues ask why you are born
If you just end up dead
The blues talking about the blues
The blues oh the blues the blues
Talking about the blues
When the blues come over me
Talking about the blues
I have to go away
The blues the blues
When the blues come over me
I have to pack it up and go
When I first met you we burned like a flame
Now it's gettin' colder and you know that's a same
Love's out there somewhere but you know it won't come in
So let's remember baby how sweet all this has been
But when two real good lovers start bein' real good friends
You know that's the beginning of the end
I make you sparkle like strawberry wine
And when I felt bad you make me feel fine
Oh it's good when it's goin' and gone when it's gone
We both know enough to leave well enough alone
When two real good lovers start bein' real good friends
Baby can't you see that's the beginning of the end
The cool of the morning the heat of the night
The loving was good but you know it just wasn't right
Someday when you wake up and call out my name
Don't feel bad about it I'll probably do the same
But when two real good lovers start bein' real good friends
Baby don't ya know that's the beginning of the end
Remember when we first met
I was so excited just to get to know you
Oh baby just to know you
I was just a little bit shy
God willing I was ready
To try to show you
Oh just to show you
I felt a little funny
But it was really no joke
I wanted to prove my love
In every word that I spoke
Chorus:
But the action
Speaks louder
You know the action
Speaks louder than
The word
The action
Louder than the word
I loved you just the way you were
Somehow I had to find the nerve to tell you
Oh baby just to tell you
So I did what a man must do
I walked right over to you
And I was asking
Baby lets go dancing
I felt a little guilty
But I had committed no crime
I wanted to love you
Love you and love you
For a long time
Chorus
Bridge:
I can't wait until I'm holding you
And there's no doubt in your mind
You're the one and only one for me
Only one for me
I'm gonna prove my love no matter how long that it takes
The feelings I have for you they're no mistake
Chorus
Well now it's all over
Now you say we're through
You've gone an' left
You say you found somebody new
That's what you think
That's what you think
You can lay off a while
But you sure can't quit me now
Now I tried my best to please you
And all I do is hurt
Each time I try to tease you
You say you're going away to stay
That's what you think
That's what you think
You can lay off a while
But you sure can't quit me now
You might as well come back to me
And do the things you should
Now I'll tell you just one fact you see
Though you might as well be good
Say you used to love me
With all your heart an' soul
But now that you're above me
You say your love is goin' cold
That's what you think
That's what you think
You can lay off a while
But you sure can't quit me now
You say you used to love me
With all your heart an' soul
But now that you above me
You say your love is goin' cold
That's what you think
That's what you think
You can lay off a while
But you sure can't quit me now
Quit me now
Quit me now
Quit me now
Quit me now
You can lay off a while
But you sure can't quit me now
Oh-oh
Oh you come home one eve'nin'
To nothin' but the four walls
And then ya find your phone been disconnected
You can't even make no call
Ya hung out for your baby oh an'she's not there
You look in the closet buddy an'you find it's all bare
Oh that's what the blues is people
That's what the blues is all about
Well that's a hard pill to have to swallow um
When you find what the blues is all about
Now listen to this:
I went out to my backyard
Ya know I whistled for my dog [ whistle sounds]
He ran up under the house people
Like he didn't even know me at all
Now I hadn't fed him in two or three days
An' he was lookin' kinda thin
Oh when your dog turn his back on ya buddy
You know ya haven't even got a friend
That's the blues people
That's what the blues is all about
Oh it's a hard pill to swallow um
When ya find out what the blues is all about
Oh look out
Uh
Oh no
I think I got 'em
I went out to my mail box
I got a bunch-a bills that I can't pay
I guess my wife been out shoppin' again
While I been at work all day
I see the man comin' with his tools
Now is he gonna cut off my water
You know they got my gas yesterday
An' they comin' right back for the lines tomorrow
Ah that's what the blues is people
That's what the blues is all about
Well that's a hard pill to swallow buddy
Oh when you find out what the blues is all about
It ain't you
No it ain't me
That's not the way
Love's supposed to be
And it's just no good
No it ain't right
For you to be sitting all alone
Crying every night
You're down on your knees
Scared he's gonna leave
But if you really wanna know
You're gonna have to let go
Cause that's not love
Love don't feel that bad
That's not love
It don't feel that sad
No that's not love
'Cause you don't feel good inside
I don't know what it is
But that's not love
Inside your heart
It's always raining
And you're oh so tired
Tired of your own complaining
This is for real
It ain't no game
You can't measure your love
By the depths of your pain
There ain't no road too rough to walk
There ain't no talk too sweet to talk
Wherever you are it's where I'll be
'Cause that's how much you mean to me
All the money in the whole round world
Wouldn't be enough for you little girl
Wish I could give you a money tree
'Cause that's how much you mean to me
A girl like you needs some loving
Teasin' squeezin' and huggin'
Step right up and take my hand
I wanna be your great big hunk of man
Baby I wanna have your picture
To put it in my my storybook
While it out big so the world can see
'Cause that's how much you mean to me
Hmm hmm
Lord Lord Lord Lord that;s alright babe

I just can't lose with the Texas blues
I said I just can't lose with the Texas blues
The Texas blues
Got myself in Double Trouble when I saw that Texas Flood

I just can't lose with the Texas blues
I said I just can't lose with the Texas blues

Well I'm going back to Dallas won't go waitin' for no bus
Ridin' off into the sunset you won't see my heels for dust
I just can't lose with the Texas blues
I said I just can't lose with the Texas blues
I said I just can't lose with the Texas blues
And I just can't lose with the Texas blues
The Texas blues
Texas blues
A-how-how-how-how

You're my man you're so nice and brown sweetest man in this town
I heard you say you was goin' away and leave me here to stay
I feel like I could cry and here's the reason why
Daddy you really knows your stuff when you take me for a buggy ride
I like you when you got your habits on you can shift your gear with so much pride
I gets a funny feelin' when you gaze into my eyes
You give me so much thrill you make my thermometer rise
I'm happy when you're by my side when you take me for a buggy ride
Daddy you're as sweet as you can be when you take me for a buggy ride
When you set me down up on your knee and ask me to be your bride
When you hug and kiss me it makes me feel fine
I gets this funny feelin' up and down my spine
You don't need no teachin' you don't need no guide when you take me for a buggy ride
Your lovin' ain't so forte in the park but you a lovin' poor creature in the dark
You ain't so hot
What can it be that makes me say "daddy take all of me"
You always ready ev'ry time that I call
What I like about you you never stall
You ain't no preacher you a good old soul
You done sent salvation to my very soul
I can't kick but I'm satisfied when you take me for a buggy ride
Way down South there's a clear stream running
In the night I feel my heart turning
I'm feeling some day I'd like to come
Back to the place I started from
Take it home
Country night with the stars above me
Way down there with the ones who love me
Mother Sister Father Son
They mean more than anyone
Take it home
Fall winds blow and the red leaves falling
Don't know there's a voice keeps calling
Saying you have found your song
You've been gone so long
Take it home
Seems my life is a long road winding
Gone so far but the ties are binding
I'll pack up my bags and fly away
To a far better day
Take it home
Don't know why I was made to wander
I've seen the light lord I've felt the thunder
Someday I'll go home again
And I know they'll take me in
Take it home
I've cried and I worries all night I lays and groan
I've cried and I worries all night I lays and groan
I used to weigh two hundred now I'm down to skin and bones
It's all about my man who has always kicked and dogged me around
It's all about my man who's always kicked and dogged me around
I've tried my best to kill him but when I do my love comes down
I've gone to the gypsy and beggin' on my bended knees
I've gone to the gypsy beggin' on my bended knees
That man put somethin' on me oh won't you take it off me please
It starts at my forehead and goes clean on down to my toes
It starts at my forehead and goes clean on down to my toes
Oh how I've suffered gypsy nobody but the good Lord knows
So fix him for me gypsy lay your money on the line
Just fix him for me gypsy I lay your money on the line
Just fix him so he will love me but please take him off my mind
Come on please take a walk with me

To jump into the ocean

If I go to church on Sunday

I sure had a wonderful time last night
Least wise they tell me I did
I sure had a wonderful time last night
Really blew my lid
Went to a party I recollect that much
But after four or five you know I lost my touch
I sure had a wonderful time last night
Least wise they tell me I did
I had a whale of good time last night
Really got myself some kicks
I sure had a wonderful time last night
Took me right back to the sticks
Between that hillbilly band and old Uncle Zeke
And that new atomic beverage that they called "Sneaky Pete"
I sure had a wonderful time last night
Least wise they tell me I did
Sure had a wonderful time last night
Don't know how I got to bed
Sure had a wonderful time last night
Come here feel this lump on my head
They say I got kinda noisy
And started to shout
Four big bouncers grabbed me
But I threw them out
I sure had a wonderful time last night
Least wise they tell me I did
Sure had a wonderful time last night
Really had myself some fun
Sure had a wonderful time last night
Didn't get home until about half past one
You know I'd like to take you with me the next time I go
But where the heck was it
Sure would like to know
But I sure had a wonderful time last night

I've got a street walkin' woman she stays tall an twisted all the time
I've got a street walkin' woman she stays tall an twisted all the time

She leaves home early in the mo'nin' then she don't come back until the sun's goin' down
She leaves home in the mo'nin' an' she don't come back until the sun is goin' down
She's always got her whiskey up to her mouth and her face full of ugly frown

All that woman wants to do is keep her big feet in the street
I love my street walkin' woman she walks the avenue up and down

Sometime I wish she would start ta walkin' an' keep on walkin' outta
town
I play the street life
Because there's no place I can go
Street life
And it's the only life I know
Street life
And there's a thousand parts to play
Street life
Until you play your life away
You let the people see
Just who you want to be
And every night you shine just like a super star
That's how the life is played
A ten cent Masquerade
You dress and walk and talk you're who you think you are
Street life
You can run away from time

My enemies have betrayed me have overtaken poor Bob at last

Clouds one by one fill the sky just like these tears that fill my eyes I know by now she ain't comin' back I watch my world slowly fade into black
Look out my window it's still rainin' Look out my window it's still rainin'
They say that time heals everything I've felt the pain that love can bring It don't get no better with each passing day any hope I had is slowly slipping away
Look out my window it's still rainin' Look out my window it's still rainin'
I thought the morning would rescue me but the rain keeps falling endlessly endlessly Sometimes I wonder what'll become of me there ain't much left of what I used to be Her love shone on me like the morning light now here I am alone again tonight
Look out my window it's still rainin'
Look out my window it's still rainin'
Used to be so easy to give my heart away
But I found out the hard way there's a price you have to pay
I found out that love was no friend of mine
I should have known time after time
So long it was so long ago but I've still got the blues for you
Used to be so easy to fall in love again
But I found out the hard way it's a road that leads to pain
I found that love was more than just a game
You're playin' to win but you lose just the same
So long it was so long ago but I've still got the blues for you
So many years since I've seen your face
Here in my heart there's an empty space where you used to be
So long it was so long ago but I've still got the blues for you
Though the days come and go there is one thing I know
I've still got the blues for you
Well now there's two there's two trains running
Well they ain't never no going my way
Well now one run at midnight and the other one
running just 'fore day

Late last night I was dreaming
I was dreaming of your charms
I was standing
On the edge of love darling
With you in my arms
Well you whispered sweet things
And told me
That you loved me and always be true
And you'd stand
On the edge of love with me
If I'd stand with you
I'm standing on the edge of love
Just about to slip and fall
Standing on the edge of love darling
Waiting on your call
You know I'm standing on the edge of love
Just about to lose my mind
Standing on the edge of love darling
Waiting on you one more time
Now a young man's mind will wander
Wander to distant shores
If you'll just come here
And stand with me
I won't wander no more
I promise to stop all of my gambling
Even stop staying out late all night
Might even settle down and have babies
Treat ourselves right
'Cause a young man's dreams are many
Lord so few come true
So if you'll just come here
And stand with me
I'll stand with you
That's why I say you know
I'm standing on the edge of love
Just about to slip and fall
Standing on the edge of love darling
Waiting on your call that's why I say
You know I'm standing on the edge of love
Just about to lose my mind
Standing on the edge of love darling
Waiting on you one more time
That's why I'm standing standing
Standing yes I'm standing
Standing on the edge of love
Waiting on you one more time
That's why I'm standing standing
Standing yes I'm standing
Standing on the edge of love
Waiting on you one more time
That's why I'm standing standing
Standing yes I'm standing
Standing on the edge of love
One more time
Oh baby look how you got me standin' around cyin'

You got so many men

Oh baby you ain't nothin' like you used to be
Oh no don't get me killed honey
Oh baby you ain't nothin' like you used to be
When I was deep in love with you little girl
you was just sweet as an apple on a tree
Standin' in the rain and ain't a drop fell on me
Standin' in the rain and ain't a drop fell on me
My clothes is all wet but my flesh is as dry as can be
It can rain all day I ain't got no place to go
It can rain all day I ain't got no place to go
Because it's cold outside in that ice and snow
If it rains five days that won't give me no blues
If it rains five days that won't give me no blues
I've got my raincoat and hat umbrella boots and shoes
Rain rain rain don't rain on me all day
Rain rain rain don't rain on me all day
'Cause if I get too wet I've got to go into the house and stay
Standin' at the station
Teardrops in my eyes
Standin' at the station
Wonderin' why
You love him more than you love me
You wanna marry him
Make a family
That's why I'm standin' at the station
Teardrops in my eyes
Well I'm standin' at the station
Sad as a man can be
And you're gazing through the window
Waving good-bye to me
Well I know you got to do what you got to do
But you're leaving me
And I'm loving you
That's why I'm standin' at the station
Teardrops in my eyes
Yes I'm standin' at the station
Teardrops in my eyes

Worried in the nighttime worried in the day
'Cause another sweetie took my man away
Down in St Louis there I lost my pride and joy
St Louis woman stole the heart of my big boy I'm cryin'
St Louis gal just look what you done done I said what you done done
St Louis gal you gonna have some fun I mean a-lots of fun
I'm always cryin' the blues both night and day
Now daddy's gone but you will shake in your shoes
Hear what I say 'cause some fine mornin' without any warnin'
St Louis gal I'm gonna handle you I say manhandle you
You'll find yourself in a jam as sure as anything what am
Down in Missouri there'll come a time your life won't be worth a dime
You stole my pal St Louis gal I'm going a-huntin' do do de do
You know just what I'm gonna do you stole my pal St Louis gal
I hate to see the ev'nin' sun go down
Hate to see the ev'nin' sun go down
'cause my baby he done left this town
Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today
Feel tomorrow like I feel today
I'll pack my trunk make my getaway
St Louis woman with her diamond rings
Pulls that man 'round by her apron strings
't'want for powder and for store-bought hair
The man I love would not gone nowhere
got the St Louis blues just as blue as I can be
That man got a heart like a rock cast in the sea
or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me
Been to the gypsy to get my fortune told
To the gypsy to get my fortune told
'cause I'm most wild about my jelly roll
Gypsy done told me "Don't you wear no black"
Yes she done told me "Don't you wear no black
go to St Louis you can win him back"
Help me to Cairo make St Louis by myself
Gone to Cairo find my old friend Jeff
Goin' to pin myself close to his side
if I flag his train I sure can ride
I love that man like a schoolboy loves his pie
Like a Kentucky Colonel loves his mint and rye
I'll love my baby till the day I die
You ought to see that stovepipe brown of mine
like he owns the diamond Joseph line
He'd make across-eyed old man go stone blind
Blacker than midnight teeth like flags of truce
Blackest man in the whole St Louis
Blacker the berry sweeter is the juice
About a crap game he knows a powerful lot
but when work time comes he's on the dot
Goin' to ask him for a cold ten spot
what it takes to get it he's certainly got
A black-headed gal make a freight train jump the track
Said a black-headed gal make a freight train jump the track
But a redheaded woman makes a preacher
ball the jack
Daddy you've been doggone sweet on me daddy you the only one I see
You know I need but you 'cause you my man you can love me like no one can
Something 'bout you I can't resist and when you kiss me daddy I stay kissed
Now daddy squeeze me squeeze me again oh daddy don't stop till I tell you when
Now daddy squeeze me kiss me some more oh Lord like you did before
Your papa cupid is standing close by
Now daddy don't let sweet baby cry
Pick me up on your knee
I just git so you know when you squeeze me
I just git so you know when you squeeze me
It could be a spoonful
of diamonds
Could be a spoonful of gold
Just a little spoon of your precious love
Satisfies my soul
Men lies about little
Some of them cries about little
Some of them dies about little
Everything fight about little spoonful
That spoon that spoon that spoonful
It could be a spoonful of coffee
Could be a spoonful of tea
But a little spoon of your precious love
Good enough for me
Men lies about that
Some of them dies about that
Some of them cries about that
But everything fight about that spoonful
That spoon that spoon that spoonful
It could be a spoonful of water
Saved from the deserts sand
But one spoon of them fortifies
Save you from another man
Men lies about that
Some of them cries about that
Some of them dies about that
Everybody fightin' about that spoonful
That spoon that spoon that spoonful

Ain't no telling what I may do
I've got something up my sleeve
I've got something up my sleeve
I've got something up my sleeve
I've got something up my sleeve baby
I've got something baby
Up my sleeve baby
Give me a chance
I've got something baby
I know there's someone somewhere who loves me
I know there's someone somewhere who cares
I know there's someone somewhere who loves me
I know there's someone somewhere who cares
I'm gonna keep on a-searchin' until the angel answer my prayer
Good thing good things good things good things good things
Come to those who wai-ait
An' I've been waitin' a long long time good things come to those who wait
An' I wanna tell you I been waitin' long long time
I'm gonna keep on a-waitin' until the day I can call you mine
I'm not gonna get discouraged I'm not gonna turn around
I'm not gonna get discouraged I'm tryin' to tell you I'm not gonna turn around
I'm gonna keep on pressin' hard and forward until true love I've
found
Don't care when you go
How long you stay
But good kind treatments
Will bring you back someday
But someday baby
I ain't gonna worry my life anymore
Aw but one thing
Really give me the blues
When I wore a hole
In my last pair of shoes
But someday baby
I ain't gonna worry my life anymore
Just keep on a-bettin'
About the dice don't pass
You're gonna leave here runnin'
Almost too fast
But someday baby
I ain't gonna worry my life anymore
Don't like everybody
In my neighborhood
I got a no-good woman
She don't mean me no good
But someday baby
I ain't gonna worry my life anymore

Well I'm tryin' yes I'm tryin just to get a line on you where you been

Anything you wanna do is cool with me I don't care who shakes your
tree
Somebody done changed somebody done changed the lock on that door
Somebody done changed they done changed the lock on that door
'Cause the key I got won't fit that lock no more
Now I came home last night about half past ten
Tried to get the key in the lock but I couldn't get it in
'Cause somebody done changed
They done changed the lock on that door
'Cause the key I got won't fit that lock no more
I looked through the window to see what I could see
She was talking to someone else
I know it wasn't me
She said "daddy daddy daddy daddy you don't have to go
'Cause I done changed I done changed that lock on my door"
She changed the bed around even painted the door
She even changed the carpet I mean on the floor
My baby changed
Oh she done changed the lock on my door
'Cause the key I got won't fit that lock no more
Well I walked down the street lookin' where I used to go
She's got a mean black snake and I can't go there no more
My baby changed
She done changed the lock on my door
And the key I got won't fit that lock no more
Well the blues is on me now
I'll feel better when I leave your town
But some sweet day you're gonna be sorry
That you throwed me down
I got my suitcase already packed
Yes my trunk is on the road
Don't worry baby you won't see my smilin' face no more
You're so mean and you're so evil
You got me runnin' runnin' from door to door
But some sweet day you gonna be sorry
Babe that you let me go
Now get it together boys
Yeah-hey-yeah

And I don't know just what to do
Some sweet day your luck will change
Baby you will be blue too

So many days I'd rather steal away and die
I was too blue to live and to mean to die
You've been so mean baby you've been so mean to me
Baby you've been so mean you've been so mean to me

Yes you can pack your clothes baby you can pack your clothes and go
Pack your clothes woman you can pack your clothes and go
I want you to know baby you ain't no better than the little girl I
had before
I'm worried in mind stay worried all the time
Someday I'll be satisfied
It's your time now but it's my time after a while
Oh say if things don't get no better
I'm gonna move on down the line
'Cause when you was my baby
I treated you nice an' kind
But baby I have changed my mind
I was crazy 'bout you baby
Crazy as a man could be
So now when I leave ya now baby don't try an' follow me
You gonna wake up one-a these mornin's and it won't be long
And look for me an' I will be gone
So bye-bye baby babe you know you've done me wrong
So try your best to forget that I ever held you in my arms
Yes yes yes
You gonna worry 'bout me one a-these old lonesome days
An' your daddy be far away
So long peoples an' sweetheart I'll soon be on my way
You're goin' to be sorry that you let me go 'round still

I've lost the right to say that I love you
I've lost the right to say that you are fine
Yes I've lost the right to say that I love you baby
and I've lost the right to say that you are fine
I've lost the right to say that I need you like I do now baby
and I'm slowly losing my mind
Oh you once told me how much you love me
and I said God love us all
Oh you told me once how much you love me baby
and I said God love us all
Yes I was young and just a fool then baby
and couldn't hear the lovers call
Oh now I'm all alone and waiting here baby
I have no one to call my own
Yes I'm all alone and I'm waiting baby
I have no one to call my own
Yes you are just a fool each lonely heartbeat says
now I wonder why was I born
When I was a young boy
Well they tried to tell me
That I was movin'
Movin' way too fast
And I knew everything
About everything
But I really didn't wanna listen
To a bunch of old folks talkin' trash
So I got out on the highway
Pedal to the floor
Smokin' and drinkin'
And a whole lot more
But when they came to collect me
Out of that jail
They said boy next time
You get no bail
Chorus:
You better slow down
You better slow down
Woke up one mornin'
Ooh to a hunger
I moaned
And I began to twitch
Felt the need
For some lovin'
A little sweet somebody
To scratch my itch
Momma said I don't mean to pry
But I'm here to advise you
Seeds like to grow
When you put 'em in fertilizer
Chorus
Doin' my own thing
I'm all grown up
Yes I am
Little bit older
But I feel like a young buck
I'm ridin' down the highway
In a brand new mini van
Wife and kids screamin'
Ooh God I'm a family man
I'm outta mind
Losin control
I could leave tomorrow
But there ain't nowhere to go
Chorus
I'd rather be sloppy drunk than anything I know
I'd rather be sloppy drunk than anything I know
Another half a pint then you'll see me go
My gal done quit me for somebody else
Oh my gal done quit me for somebody else
Now I'm sloppy drunk again sleeping all by myself
Oh I love my whiskey tell the world I do
Oh I love my whiskey telling the world I do
And my reason for drinkin' tryin' to get along with you
Oh I drink while I'm up drink until I'll fall
I'm gonna drink while I'm up drink until I'll fall
If you tryin' to stop me drinkin' ain't saying nothing at all
Oh hey bartender bring another half a pint
Oh hey bartender bring another half a pint
Two or three more drinks I'm gonna raid this joint
Yes
I'm sloppy drunk again
I don't care who knows
Yeahow
The sky is cryin' look at the tears roll down the street
The sky is cryin' look at the tears roll down the street
I been lookin' for my baby yeah an' I wonder where can she be
I saw my baby early one mornin' an' she was walkin' on down the street
I saw my baby early one mornin' an' she was walkin' on down the street
You know it hurt me so bad yeah it made my poor heart skip a beat
I got a bad feelin' my baby don't love me no more
I got a real bad bad feelin' my baby don't love me no more
You know the sky is cryin' yeah the tears rollin' down my nose
Fading:
The sky is cryin' look at the tears roll down the street
Now I don't want no no skinny woman I want the woman she got a-plenty of Lord
I don't want no skinny woman I want some a woman with a-plenty a-meat
Now we can roll all night long an' this woman won't have to stop 'n eat
Well I've got so so many women now an' I don't know who I love
Yes Lord I 've got me so many women til I'm I really don't know who I love
Now an' it seems like the girl I been cravin' for slipped away to the good Lord up above
I have the blues blues in the mo'nin blues is the first thing when I lay down
An' Lord I have the blues in the mo'nin blues is the first thing when I lay down at night
Now that's the reason my baby worries me my baby she don't treat me right
Now if you take me take me back baby now an' I won't do you mean no mo' oh Lord
If you just forgive me this time I won't never do you mean no mo'
Now that you been get all-a my labor love n' you just let Mister So an' So go

I she gone she's gone she'll for'ever be on my mind
Now she was a sweet little woman she just wouldn't be lovin' n'

Well I pulled out of Pittsburgh
rolling down the eastern sea border
I got my rig so wound up
and she's running like never before
There's a speed zone ahead on my right
but I don't see a cop in sight
Six days on the road and I'm gonna make it home tonight
Well my rig's a little low
but that don't mean that she's slow
There a flame from her stack
blowing smoke as black as coal
My hotel's comin' in sight
if you think I'm happy all right
Six days on the road and I'm gonna make it home tonight
I've got ten forward gears
and a sweet Georgia overdrive
I got the pedal to the metal
and my eyes are open wide
I just passed a Jimmy in white
I've been passing everything in sight
Six days on the road and I gotta see my baby tonight
The ICC is checking on down the line
I'm a little hung over
And my log book is way behind
but nothing bothers me tonight
Just I can dodge them scales alright
Six days on the road and I'm gonna make it home tonight
Yeah it seems like a year since I kissed my baby bye bye
I can have a lot of chicks but I'm not like some other guys
Yes I can find one to hold me tight
but you know it wouldn't be alright
Six days on the road and I'm gonna make it home tonight
I pulled out of Pittsburgh
rolling down the eastern sea border
I got my rig wound up
and she's running like never before
There's a speed zone ahead on my right
but I can dodge the law all night
Six days on the road and I'm gonna make it home tonight
Six days on the road and I gotta see my baby tonight
I am sitting here thinking and your thoughts make me feel so sad
I am sitting here thinking and your thoughts make me feel so sad
I've searched eleven long years for love yeah searchin' for something I already had
When I think of what the old folks say I can't help but cry
When I think of what the old folks say umm I can't help but cry
They have told me so often you never miss your water 'til the well goes dry
From now on I'll try and do the things I should
From now on I'll try and do the things I should
Let's take a chance on that old sayin' it's never too late to be
good
One summer day she went away
She gone and left me she gone to stay
But now she's gone and I can't worry
Because I'm sittin' on top of the world
Worked all the summer worked all the fall
Had to take Christmas in my overalls
But now she's gone and I don't worry
Sittin' on top of the world
Goin' down to the freight yard catch me a freight train
I'm gonna leave this town work done got hard
But now she's gone and I don't worry
Sittin' on top of the world
I dreamed last night I was far from harm
Woke up and found my man in a sissy's arms
"Hello Central it's 'bout to run me wild
Can I get that number or will I have to wait a while"
Some are young some are old
My man says sissy's got good jelly roll
My man got a sissy his name is Miss Kate
He shook that thing like jelly on a plate
Now all the people ask me why I'm all alone
A sissy shook that thing and took my man from me
I lost a good woman and I grieve both night and day
I lost a good woman and I grieve both night and day
I get the blues for my baby ever since she been gone away
I'm so unhappy mama when I used to be so gay
I'm so unhappy baby when I used to be so gay
I get the blues for my baby ever since she been gone away
I watches the sun when it rises until it fade away
I watch the sun when it rises until it fade away
I get the blues for my baby ever since she been gone away
Yeah boy
Just as long as I live babe you will always hear me say
Just as long as I live mama you will always hear me say
I get the blues for my baby ever since she been gone away
I used to wake up in the morning with an aching head
I couldn't remember anything I'd said
My friends told me I was getting out of line
if it wasn't for you baby I'd be doing time
Since I met you baby you've made a new man of me
Since I met you baby I'm happy as a man could be
Yes I am

Ain't no doubt about it I was no second best
Didn't seem to matter what was right or what was wrong

Since I met you baby you've made a new man of me
Since I met you baby I'm happy as a man could be
Yes I am
Since I met you baby

Since I fell for you
Love brings such misery and pain

Since I fell for you
Oh it's too bad oh it's so sad
I'm in love with you
You love me then you snub me
But what can I do
I'm so in love with you
Oh I guess I'll never see the light

Since I fell for you
Well it's too bad oh it's so sad
That I'm in love with you
Oh you love me then you snub me
Oh but what can I do

Giving me a dirty look

Just to get along with you
I've got your picture and I'm going to put it in a frame

And then if you leave town we can find you just the same
Now if you don't love me please don't dog me around
If you don't love me please don't dog me around Shuckin' Sugar
Like you dog me around I'll know you'll put me down

Everytime she smiles she shines a light on me

Well I'm of tired of marriage and I'm tired of this settlin' down

I only wanna be like I am in a different kind of town
Tell me anybody do you really give a damn for me
I said tell me anybody do you really give a damn for me
'Cause I just got to tell you 'bout a thing that's botherin' me
I was a ramblin' pony I would roll I would roll I would roll from town to town

Yes just looking for a sweet woman and makin' all my love come on down

Do you want me to make a last cry or be satisfied
That's exactly what I mean to do
Oh the gale is raging and my ship's without a sail
Oh the gale is raging and my ship's without a sail
If the wind keeps on a-blowing I won't be left to tell the tale
Oh the ship is sinking and the lightning struck the mast
Now the ship is sinking and the lightning struck the mast
And my crew is done deserted I've got to stick here to the last
Oh I don't mind drowning but the water is so cold
No I don't mind drowning but the water is so cold
If I must leave this good world I wanna leave it brave and bold
Mama's shipwrecked shipwrecked she ain't got no time to lose
Mama's shipwrecked shipwrecked she ain't got no time to lose
Lord if someone don't save me I'll go down singing the shipwrecked
blues
Captain tell your men to get on board
Hoist your sail just pull into another shore
I'm dreary in mind and I'm so worried in heart
Oh the best of friends sho' has got to part
Blow your whistle captain so your men'll know what to do
Blow your whistle captain so your men'll know what to do
When a woman gets dreary ain't no tellin' what she won't do
It's cloudy outdoors as can be
Oh it's cloudy as can be
That's the time I need my good man with me
It's rainin' and it's stormin' on the sea
It's rainin' it's stormin' on the sea
I feel like somebody has shipwrecked poor me
When I tiptoe to the house high as a kite
I'd rather face a tiger than to face my wife
She's the no sleepin'est woman I ever did see
When I hit the doorstep she knows it's me
With my shoes in my hand I'm careful too
It makes no difference it's "honey is that you"
She's the no sleepin'est woman I ever did see
When I hit the doorstep she knows it's me
Well I like to play around sometime with my friend
But when I go home I'm afraid to go in
She thinks my head is a rubber ball
It's the same old story from summer to fall
She knows I'm sick and a little tight
But I gotta prepare for a all night fight
She's the no sleepin'est woman I ever did see
When I hit the doorstep she knows it's me
Well I like to play around sometime with my friend
But when I go home I'm afraid to go in
She thinks my head is a rubber ball
It's the same old story from summer to fall
She knows I'm sick and a little tight
But I gotta prepare for a all night fight
She's the no sleepin'est woman I ever did see
When I hit the doorstep she knows it's me
She's the no sleepin'est woman I ever did see
I give her some pills and she trick poor me
No sleepin'est woman that I ever did see
I've got a right to love my baby
Oh she treats me just like a king
Hey I've got a right to love my baby
I said she treats me just like a king
Oh she eases my mind body and soul
My baby she can do most anything
Oh she's my doctor when I'm sick people
She's my all around standby
Hey she's my lawyer when I'm in trouble
And she's my mother when I wanna cry
I've got a right to love my baby
Hey can't you see the reason why
That gives me a right to love my baby
She's always here by my side
Hey my sweet undersanding baby
She makes my temperature rise
And when it comes to kind treatment people
My baby's an angel in disguise
Well when I'm sick she's my doctor
When I'm well she's my pride and joy
Hey when I'm cold
When I'm cold she's my cover
And she calls me "my little baby boy"
When I'm tired and wanna play people
It's my baby that's my toy
Met a lot women who could love alright
But nothing like the woman I met this night
She's dynamite she's dynamite
She knows what to do and she knows what it's all about
Now men don't blame me because I've been around
I don't understand what's she's putting down
She's dynamite she's dynamite
She knows what to do and she knows what it's all about
Now she don't drink liquor and very little gin
But she'll show you how you just tell her when
She's dynamite she's dynamite
She knows what to do and she knows what it's all about
She's got a peal handled pistol a knife and a razor too
You can't ever tell her she'll always tell you
She's dynamite she's dynamite
She knows what to do and she knows what it's all about
Now you can whip it whop it or hang it on the wall
Or throw it out the window she'll pitch herself a ball
She's dynamite yeah she's dynamite
She knows what to do and she knows what it's all about
I wanna tell you about my little girl

Well she would do anything just to slide behind the wheel
She said "What's it gonna take for you to lay your top on down"
She said "What's it gonna take for you to lay your top on down"
I said "Honey why don't you ask me when we get to the outskirts of town"
Well now she don't care if I'm stoned or sloppy drunk
Well she don't care if I'm stoned or sloppy drunk
Long as she got the keys and there's a spare wheel in her trunk
Chorus:
Shame shame shame

You came and you went

Shame shame shame

I got a hip-shaking woman shake like a willow tree
You better wait baby you got back a little too late
You better wait baby you got back a little too late
I got a cool-shaking baby shake like jello on a plate
When my baby walk you know she's fine and mellow
When my baby walk you know she's fine and mellow
Every time she stops her flesh it shake like jello
Oh shake it baby shake it for me
Oh shake lil' baby shake it for me
Oh shake it little baby shake like a willow tree

She wanna know
Why we don't get along

But that'll never do
I have to hang around
Every day and night
I can't trust the girl
Out of my sight
She wanna sell my monkey

But that'll never do
And it's hey hey hey she was standin' in the kitchen honey in her morning gown

No need to worry
See-see baby
See what you have done
Yes you've told me a lie
Now you man has come
That man you got don't love you
Yes he told me so Lordy mama no need to worry
The man don't love you yes he told me so
He's just only jivin' you baby
He in love with the girl next door
Oh an' I love your teasin' an' the way you carries on oh Lordy mama
No need to worry I love your teasin' an' the way you carries on
Yes you told me a lie little girl you know that's wrong
She told me she'd been loved before
If I took a little less
She'd give a little more
She told me she'd been hurt a lot
But somehow she still knew
What a woman's love was for
She said if I would take a second-hand woman
The night wouldn't be so long
She said if I would take a second-hand woman
She'd put love where love belonged
I said that's alright with me
I'll do everything I can
After all baby I'm a second-hand man
I showed her Where I hid the scars
From all the battles I had fought
In lost and lonely wars
It took al night for us to understand
Life had led to us
Loves old soft and healing hand
Second guessin' first impressions there you go again Rushing off in all directions since I don't know when All day long you're building walls you're building walls all day Putting ceilings on your feelings when they should fly away
Don't you think it's time you quit it Don't you think it's time you admit it Your heart is more worthy of trust than the thoughts in your mind that sit there gathering dust
Everything you're looking for you'll know when it's real You'll know when you've found it by the way you feel
Writing down your deepest emotions with your pen in hand Your piece of paper flew out the window you watched it try and land You felt bad as it flew out of sight a part of your heart alone in the night All of a sudden you didn't mind it when you pictured that lonely stranger that would find it
Everything you're looking for
you'll know when it's real
You'll know when you've found it
by the way you feel
They were two lonely folks doin' the do's and don'ts
and got the notion together they'd be happy
Thought they'd lose the crowd 'n' do the mess around
decided to make it snappy
Just a twist of fate they didn't hesitate
now they had another party to lean on
She made him jump and sang he made her share that thing
looks like they gonna have a ball ain't nothin' wrong at all
Wo they gonna have a ball
They got to askin' what if they had to scratch-n-sniff
to find out what it is they are after
Got the ants out their pants 'n' took the chance on romance
made some plans to make it forever
Now several years have gone they still gettin' along
they know what true love is made of
Now they know that life's a trip with all it's bumps and dips
they gonna help one another along
No

Alternate lines spoken by Bo Diddley and Jerome Green :
Say man
What's that boy
I want to tell you 'bout your girlfriend
What about my girl
Well you don't look strong enough to take the message
I'm strong enough
I might hurt your feelings
My feelings are already hurt by being here with you
Well I was walking down the street with your girl the other day
Ah-ha
And the wind was blowin' real hard
Is that right
And the wind blew her hair into my face
Ah-ha
You know what else happened
What happened
The wind blew her hair into her face
Yeh
And we went a little further; you wanna hear the rest of it
I might as well
The wind blew her hair into the street
Ok; since you told me about my girl I'm gonna tell you about yours I was walking down the street with your girl
Yes
I took her home for a drink you know
Took her home
Yeh jus' for a drink
Oh
But that chick looked so ugly she had to sneak up on the glass to get a drink of water
You've got the nerve to call somebody ugly; why you so ugly the stork that brought you in the world oughta be arrested
That's alright; my momma didn't have to put a sheet on my head so sleep could slip up on me
Look-a here
What's that
Where are you from
South America
What's that
South America
You don't look like no South American to me
I'm still from South America
What part
South Texas
Where are your workin' boots at
I've got 'em on
Those aren't no boots you got on; those broguettes
Hey look-a here
What's that
I've bin tryin' to figure out what you is
I already figured out what YOU is
What's that
You that thing I throw peanuts at
Look-a here
What's that
You should be ashamed of yourself
Why
Calling people ugly
I didn't call you ugly
What you say
I said you was ruined that's all
You know somethin'
What
You look like you've bin whooped with a ugly-stick
Hey I ain't got nothin' to do with it but I beat the fellah
right
Now if you've ever been down to New Orleans
Then you can understand just what I mean
All thru the week it's quiet as a mouse
But on Saturday night they go from house to house
You don't have to pay the usual admission
If you're a cook a waiter or a good musician
So if you happen to be just passin' by
Stop in at the Saturday Night Fish Fry
It was rockin' it was rockin'
You never seen such scufflin'
And shufflin' 'till the break of dawn
It was rockin' it was rockin'
You never seen such scufflin'
And shufflin' 'till the break of dawn
Now my buddy and me was on the main stem
Foolin' around just me and him
We decided we could use a little something to eat
So we went to a house on Rampart Street
We knocked on the door and it opened up with ease
And a lush little Miss said "Come in please"
And before we could even bat an eye
We were right in the middle of a big fish fry
It was rockin' it was rockin'
You never seen such scufflin'
And shufflin' 'till the break of dawn
It was rockin' it was rockin'
You never seen such scufflin'
And shufflin' 'till the break of dawn
Now the folks was havin' the time of their life
And Sam was jivin' Jimmie's wife
Over in the corner was a beat up grand
Being played by a big fat piano man
Some of the chicks wore expensive frocks
Some of them had on bobbie socks
But everybody was nice and high
At this particular Saturday Night Fish Fry
It was rockin' it was rockin'
You never seen such scufflin'
And shufflin' 'till the break of dawn
It was rockin' it was rockin'
You never seen such scufflin'
And shufflin' 'till the break of dawn
Now the women were screamin' and jumpin' and yellin'
The bottles was flyin' and the fish was smellin'
And way above all the noise we made
Somebody hollered "You better get outta here this is a raid"
I didn't know we was breaking the law but
Somebody reached over and hit me on the jaw
Now they had us blocked off from front to back
And they was puttin' 'em in the wagon like potatoes in a sack
It was rockin' it was rockin'
You never seen such scufflin'
And shufflin' 'till the break of dawn
It was rockin' it was rockin'
You never seen such scufflin'
And shufflin' 'till the break of dawn
I knew I could get away if I had a chance
But I was shakin' like I had the St Vitus dance
So I tried to crawl in under a bath tab
When a policeman said "Where are you goin' there bub"
Now they got us out of there like a house on fire
And put us all in the black Maria
Now they might have missed a pitiful few
But they got both me and my buddy too
It was rockin' it was rockin'
You never seen such scufflin'
And shufflin' 'till the break of dawn
It was rockin' it was rockin'
You never seen such scufflin'
And shufflin' 'till the break of dawn
Well we headed for jail in a dazed condition
They booked each one of us on suspicion
Now my chick came down and paid my bail
And finally got me outta that rotten jail
Now if you ever want to get a fist in your eye
Just mention a Saturday Night Fish Fry
I don't care how many fish in the sea
But don't ever mention a fish to me
It was rockin' it was rockin'
You never seen such scufflin'
And shufflin' 'till the break of dawn
It was rockin' it was rockin'
You never seen such scufflin'
And shufflin' 'till the break of dawn
Spoken:
Take a lot a entertainers sing songs
'Bout the things they experienced in life

And hold on to what is left to you
Same old story same old song
Goes all right till it goes all wrong
Now you're going then you're gone
Same old story same old song
Spoken:
Who's that knockin' on that door
Jones
You better get away from that door
I don't know nobody named Jones
You're in the right church brother but the wrong pew
Sam Jones left his lawful wife just to step around
Came back home 'bout a year
Took it for his high brown
Went to his accustomed shore
And he knocked his knuckles sore
His wife she came but to his shame
She knew his face no more
Sam said "I'm your husband dear"
But she said "Dear that's strange to hear"
You ain't talkin' to Mrs Jones
You speakin' to Miss Wilson now
I used to be your lawful mate
But the judge done changed my fate
Was a time you could-a' walked right in
And call this place your home sweet home
But now it's all mine for all time
I'm free and livin' all alone
Don't need your clothes don't need your rent
Don't need your ones and twos
Though I ain't rich I know my stitch
I earned my strutting
shoes
Say hand me the key that unlocks my front door
Because that bell don't read Sam Jones no more no
You ain't talkin' to Mrs Jones
You speakin' to Miss Wilson now

Well I could a had a religion this bad old thing instead
Well I could a had a religion this bad old thing instead
Well all whiskey and women would not let me pray

To the city where I strayed
There's been some good time living
And some good music played
And some good loving made
I like it
I like it just that way

I wanna feel the beat go on
I wanna roll roll roll forever
I wanna feel it till it's gone
I wanna roll roll roll forever
And live from song to song
Right there in the music
Is right where I belong
When I meet my Maker
With my music in my hand
He'll smile down when He sees me
And ask about the band
I know He'll understand
He knows life
And life can be so grand
I wanna roll roll roll forever
I wanna feel the beat go on
I wanna roll roll roll forever
I wanna feel it till it's gone
I wanna roll roll roll forever
And live from song to song
Right there in the music
Is right where I belong

People since its raining has been for nights and days
Thousands people stands on the hill looking down were they used to stay
Children stand there screaming: mama we ain't got no home
Oh mama we ain't got no home
Papa says to the children "Backwater left us all alone"
Backwater rising come in my windows and door
The backwater rising come in my windows and door

On the Cupid doll

We're on a TWA to the promised land
Every woman child and man
It's a Cadillac and a great big diamond ring
Don't you know you're ridin' with King
He's on a mission of mercy on a new frontier
He's gonna check us all out of here
Up to the mansion on the hill
Where you can get your booze strips and pills
Any kind of pills folks
We're on a TWA to the promised land
Everybody clap your hands
Don't you girls love the way that he sings
Don't you know you're ridin' with King
Ridin' with the King

The brute and the lies
Tonight everybody's getting their angel wings
Don't you know you're ridin' with King
I stepped out of Mississippi when I was ten years old
With a suit cut sharp as a razor and a hot tomato road
I had a guitar hanging just about waist high
And I'm gonna play this thing until the day I die
Don't you know we're ridin' with King
Don't you know we're ridin' with King
You're ridin' with me Eric you're in good hands
You're ridin' with the blues

Don't you know you're ridin' with King

The whistle blow and through the switch
Nobody knew just-a which one switch

A man named Mose with a great big nose
Sleepin' on that pile of toes

I ain't jivin' ridin' on the L&N
Spoken: Walter Trout on guitar

Since we've been together
There's been a change in the weather
Chorus:
She's a rainmaker
She makes the rain fall from my eyes
She's a rainmaker
She makes a grown man wanna cry
Well I never thought
That a tear could fall
From the eyes of a man
Who never even cried at all
Now I've been happy
I've been blue
For the change in the season
Chorus
The lightning flashes the thunder roars
There's no stoppin' the wind
The tide is washing
Her a path to my door
I've never ever loved like this before
Storm is over the sun is bright
There's a rainbow in my life
Clouds are gone the sky is clear
And since we've been together
There's been a change in the weather
Chorus x
They tell me love is like quicksand can't stop when you're sinkin' down
Tell me love is like quicksand you can't stop when you're sinkin' down

I had a man for fifteen years
Give him his room and board
Once he was like a Cadillac
Now he's like an old worn out Ford
He never brought me a lousy dime
And put it in my hand
So there'll be some changes from now on
According to my plan
He's got to get it bring it and put it right here
Or else he's gonna keep it out there
If he must steal it beg it or borrow it somewhere
Long as he gets it I don't care
I'm tired of fryin' pork chops
To grease his fat lips
And he has to find another place
For to park his old hips
He must get it and bring it and put it right here
Or else he's gonna keep it out there
The bee gets the honey and brings it to the corn
Else he's kicked out of his home sweet home
To show you that they brings it watch the dog and the cat
Everything even brings it from a mule to a gnat
The rooster gets the worm and brings it to the hen
That oughta be a tip to all you no-good men
The groundhog even brings it and puts it in his hole
So my man has got to bring it doggone
his soul
He's got to get it bring it and put it right here
Or else he's gonna keep it out there
If he must steal it beg it or borr' it somewhere
Long as he gets it child I don't care
I'm gonna tell him like the China man: when you don't bring 'em check
You don't get 'em laundry if you break 'em down neck
You got to get it bring it and put it right here
Or else you gonna keep it out there
I don't want no woman crazy 'bout a process head
I don't want no woman crazy 'bout a process head
She a process head it's almost simple head
Ain't got no money only got a hair-do fare
Ain't got no money only got a hair-do fare
Ain't got a dime enough to your hair did right
Been a fool one time crazy over process head
Been a fool one time crazy over process head
That no-good woman almost drove me insane
Have mercy she begged
Lord have mercy on this processing fool
Lord have mercy on on this processing fool
She won't have a process head she's seen
walking up and down the street
Have mercy have mercy with a processing fool
Getting tired of sleeping in this lowdown lonesome cell
Lord I wouldn't have been here if it had not been for Nell
Lay awake at night and just can't eat a bite
Used to be my rider but
she just won't treat me right
Got a red-eyed captain and a squabbling boss
Got a mad dog sergeant honey and he won't knock off
I'm getting tired of sleeping in this lowdown lonesome cell
Lord I wouldn't 've been here if it had not been for Nell
I asked the government to knock some days off my time
Well the way I'm treated I'm about to lose my mind
I wrote to the governor please turn me a-loose
Since I don't get no answer I know it ain't no use
I'm getting tired of sleeping in this lowdown lonesome cell
Lord I wouldn't have been here if it had not been for Nell
I hate to turn over and find my rider gone
Walking across my floor Lordy how I moan
Lord I wouldn't have been here if it had not been for Nell
I'm getting tired of sleeping in this lowdown lonesome cell
Well you've heard about love givin' sight to the blind
My baby's lovin' cause the sun to shine
She's my sweet little thing she's my pride and joy
She's my sweet little baby I'm her little lover boy
Yeah I love my baby heart and soul
Love like ours won't never grow old
She's my sweet little thing she's my pride and joy
She's my sweet little baby I'm her little lover boy
Yeah I love my lady she's long and lean
You mess with her you'll see a man get mean
She's my sweet little thing she's my pride and joy
She's my sweet little baby I'm her little lover boy
Well I love my baby like the finest wine
Stick with her until the end of time
She's my sweet little thing she's my pride and joy
She's my sweet little baby I'm her little lover boy
Yeah I love my baby heart and soul
Love like ours won't never grow old
She's my sweet little thing she's my pride and joy
She's my sweet little baby I'm her little lover boy

All day long I'm worried all night long I'm blue
I'm so awfully lonesome I don't know what to do
So I ask you doctor see if you can't find
Something in your satchel to satisfy my mind
Doctor doctor write me a prescription for the blues
The wearied blues
Let me tell you doctor why I'm in misery
Once I had a lover he went away from me
Sent to see the gypsy voodoo
doctors too
Shook their heads and told me nothing they could do
Doctor doctor write me a prescription for the blues
The mean old blues
Like a little baby all day long I cry
And if you can't cure me I just am sure to die
Give me something poison doctor won't you please
Then I'll sign a paper: died with the heart's disease
Doctor doctor write me a prescription for the blues
The plain old blues
Down in Atlanta GA under the viaduct ev'ry day drinking corn and hollerin' hooray
Pianos playing till the break of day
But as I turned my head I loudly said "Preach 'em blues sing them blues"
They certainly sound good to me
I've been in love for the last six months and ain't done worrying yet
Moan'em blues holler them blues
Let me convert your soul
'Cause just a little spirit of the blues tonight
Let me tell you girls that your man ain't treating you right
Let me tell you I don't mean no wrong
I will learn you something if you listen to this song
I ain't here to try to save your soul just want to teach you how to save your good jelly roll
Going on down the line a little further now
There's many a poor woman down
Read on down to chapter nine
woman must learn how to take their time
Read on down to chapter ten
taking other women's men you are doing a sin
Sing'em sing'em sing them blues
Let me convert your soul
Now one sister by the name of Sister Green
jumped up and done a shimmy you ain't never seen
Sing'em sing'em sing them blues
Let me convert your soul
Mmmmm mmmmm
I's up this mornin' ah blues walkin' like a man
I's up this mornin' ah blues walkin' like a man
Worried blues give me your right hand
And the blues fell mama's child tore me all upside down
Blues fell mama's child and it tore me all upside down
Travel on poor Bob just can't turn you 'round
The blues is a low-down shakin' chill
spoken: Yes preach 'em now
Mmmmm mmmmm
Is a low-down shakin' chill
You ain't never had 'em I hope you never will
Well the blues is a achin' old heart disease
spoken: Do it now you gon' do it Tell me all about it
The blues is a low-down achin' heart disease
Like consumption killing me by degrees
I can study rain oh oh drive oh oh drive my blues
I been studyin' the rain and I'm 'on drive my blues away
Goin' to the 'stil'ry stay out there all day
Get it while it's hot
I've been all over Europe
And across the sea
With each new place
It gets clearer to me
Week after week
On tour with my band
You don't have to speak
'Cause they all understand
The power of the blues
Hey hey the power of the blues
And that's good news
I'm talking about the power of the blues
Yes it's just a few changes
That I won't deny
But if you think it's easy
You just give it a try
You know the truth
But you're afraid to say it
That it ain't what I play
It's the way that I play it
That's the power of the blues
Yes the power of the blues
You'll change your views
When you hear the power of the blues
Now me and Lucille
We're gonna stop this war
I'm no politician
But I know the score
You can call me a hawk
Or maybe I'm a dove
But all we gotta do
Is shoot 'em full of love
With the power of the blues
Hey the power of the blues
It's the thing to use
Talking about the power of the blues
Yes I am
I went up on the mountain to see what Poor Kelly done
He killed his woman an' didn't even attempt to run
Up on the mountain just to see what Poor Kelly done
Well he killed his woman an' he didn't even attempt to run
When I found Poor Kelly he was standing in the door
With a thirty-two twenty and a forty-four
When I found Poor Kelly he was standing in the door
With a thirty-two twenty and a hard-hitting forty-four
I asked him was he was sorry he said
"Nobody know just can't stand the way she was treatin' me anymore
Just couldn't stand the way she was doin' me anymore
She's a dirty-mistreater she won't jive
me no more"
He said "I know I loved her better than I did myself
She misused me for somebody else
She know I loved her better than I did myself
Still she tried to misuse me for somebody else"
"I know they gonna get me" he said "But I know I don't care
They may even send me to the 'lectric chair
I know they gonna get me but babe I don't care
There's one consolation they won't leave my woman here"
I'm a poor poor boy
But that don't worry me
Everybody knows that the best things in life are free
Well I go out make a little money
Spend it fast as I can
I'm gonna go out and have a good time

I got all the girls I need
And a hotel over my head
One thing I know baby I got clean sheets on my bed
Well I ain't got no money
But baby I don't care
I'm gonna ride around this town in my new car lookin' like a millionaire
Yes I said I'm a poor poor boy
But that don't worry me
Everybody knows that the best things in life are free
I'm achin' all over baby b'lieve I got the pneumonia this time
I'm achin' all over baby b'lieve I got the pneumonia this time
An' it's all on account of that low-down gal of mine
Slippin' round the corners running up alleys too
Slippin' round the corners running up alleys too
Watching my woman trying to see what she goin' do
Sat out in the streets one cold dark stormy night
Sat out in the streets one cold dark stormy night
Trying to see if my good gal going to make it home all right
Wearin' BVD's in the winter prowling 'round in the
rain
Wearin' BVD's in the winter prowling 'round in the rain
Runnin' down baby give me this pneumonia pain

Play on little girl play until the morning sun

You don't live but once so you're playing days are done
One day every week I prop myself at my front door
One day every week I prop myself at my front door
And the police force couldn't move me 'fore that mail man blow
'T'was a little white paper Uncle Sam had done addressed to me
'T'was a little white paper Uncle Sam had done addressed to me
It meant one more week one week of sweet prosperity
But bad news got to spreading and my poor hair started turning grey
But bad news got to spreading and my poor hair started turning grey
'Cause Uncle Sam started chopping cutting thousands off the WPA
Just a little pink slip in a long white envelope
Just a little pink slip in a long white envelope
Was the end of my road was the last ray of my only hope
After four long years Uncle Sam done put me on the shelf
After four long years Uncle Sam done put me on the shelf
'Cause that little pink slip means you got to go for yourself
Girls I wanna tell you about these sweet men
These men goin' around here tryin' to play cute
I'm hard on you boys yes sir
I fell in love with a sweet man once
He said he loved me too
He said if I'd run away with him
What nice things he would do
I'd travel around from town to town
How happy I would feel
But don't you know he would not work
Girls take this tip from me
Get a working man when you marry
And let all these sweet men be
Child it takes money to run a business
And with me I know you girls will agree
There's one thing about this married life
That these young girls have got to know
Say if a sweet man enter your front gate
Turn out your light and lock your door
Yes get a working man when you marry
Let all these pinchbacks be
Child it takes money to run a business
And with me I know you girls will agree
And if this panic stays on much longer
I'll hear all these young girls say
That it's a long way to Oklahoma
But these little pinchbacks take them away
My best man my best friend
told me to stop peddlin' gin
They even told me to keep my hands
out people's pocket where their money was in
But I wouldn't listen or have any shame
'long as someone else would take the blame
Now I can see it all come home to me
I'm sittin' in the jailhouse now
I mean I'm in the jailhouse now
I done stop runnin' around with this one
and these good lookin' browns
Any time you see me I was good time bound
with this one that one most all in town
I'm in the jailhouse now
I'm sittin' in the jailhouse now
Beatrice got a phonograph and it won't say a lonesome word

What evil have I done or what evil have the poor girl heard
You had style you had class
You had everything to make a love last
You had grace you had charm
You had me hanging on your arm
When I found out you were a fake
You rared up and bit me like a snake
And I was ready to let go
And let all my feelings show
Chorus:
Tell me why you wanna be so cold
Why you wanna be so mean
You've gone and let your true colors show
You're a perpetual blues machine
We could have been just fine
If you'd have only been all mine
'Cause I was for real but you did not know
That you were steppin' on my heart
As you were walkin' out the door
But now I know who you are
And it's a damn good thing we didn't get too far
'Cause I'm not the one that's right for you
You need a man to do your rolling
Like what you want him to do
Chorus
Now you've gone and I'm glad
That we didn't let it go too bad
You know I tried to make it go
But there was just no way to tell u so
Chorus
Raise up your hands and put a smile on your face
I'm talking to everyone in the human race
We're proud and strong so stand up tall
Let's all get together bring peace to the world
There's a train of love beginning right here
So jump on to it and have no fear
It's yours it's mine we got the call
Let's all get together and bring peace to the world
Let's all get together bring peace to the world
Let's all get together bring peace to the world
Every man and woman boy and girl
Let's all get together bring peace to the world
Shelter the homeless open your door
Feed the hungry give to the poor
Offer your heart don't think small
Let's all get together bring peace to the world
Let's all get together bring peace to the world
Let's all get together bring peace to the world
Every man and woman boy and girl
Let's all get together bring peace to the world

Had peace of mind

I was born and raised down in Alabama on a farm way back up in the woods Oh I was so ragged folks used to call me "Patches" Papa used to tease me about it but deep down inside dad was hurtin' 'cause he'd done the best he could
My papa was a great old man
I can see him with a shovel in his hand
Education that he never had
But he did wonders when the times got bad
The little money from the crops we raised
Barely paid the bills we made
Oh life whipped him
Down to the ground
When he tried to get up
Life would kick him back down
On the day papa called me
To his dyin' bed
Placed his hand on my shoulders
And in tears he said
Patches
I'm depending on you son
To pull the family through
My son it's all left up to you
Two days later papa passed away
And I became a man that day
Everyday I had to work the fields
'Cause that's the only way
We got our meals
See I was the oldest of the family
And everybody was depending on me
Now the years have passed
And everybody's grown
Mama's been livin'
In a brand new home
Lord knows it took
A lot of sweat and tears
And my daddy's voice
To help us through the years
He said:
Patches
I'm depending on you son
To pull the family through
My son it's all left up to you
Daddy had been sick for a long time flat on his back Every evenin' after we'd finish our chores and eat our dinner we'd all go into papa's room to cheer him up a little And this particular day dad was in good spirits sittin' on the side of the bed tellin' mama how good she looked When all of a sudden papa had a pain in his chest I was too young to understand talkin' about a heart attack here Mama rushed us all out of the room into the hallway About ten minutes later she came out with tears in her eyes She called out to me "Patches Patches get in here boy Your daddy wanna see you" I went runnin' into papa's room there papa lay Daddy had tears in his eyes I knew something was wrong daddy was a poor man but all of my life he'd been a proud man I knelt down on one knee beside the bed papa put his hand on my shoulder He said "Patches Patches boy the hammer of life done beat your old papa down to the ground and I ain't got nobody to turn to to take care of mama and the younger So what I want you to do is promise me son is that you're gonna do your best to help your mama as much as you can" I said "Papa I'm gonna do my best" But little did I know then like I know now that tryin' to climb life's mountains searchin' for a top where there ain't no top sometimes you find yourself frustrated lazy But every time I feel like I can't live my life like I want to my mind goes back to that day when I see those tears in my daddy's eyes But most of all I remember his words "Patches I'm dependin' on you boy" Every time I feel like givin' up I hear his voice "Patches Patches Patches Patches -"
I'm depending on you son
I've tried to do my best
It's up to you to do the rest
Patches
I'm depending on you son
I've tried to do my best
It's up to you to do the rest
Patches
I'm depending on you son
To pull the family through
My son it's all left up to you

Six feet in my grave
Than to live lonely
Each and everyday

I need me a part time love
Every time my woman leaves me
You know I need a part time love
She came home this morning

I've gotten good at missin' her I practice all the time
While I drive the Pan Am highway thru with that cactus friend of mine
It's gettin' hard to see the white line rollin' by I can't forget her memory deep inside
I dropped a bundle down in Panama but the loss didn't do me no good
Spendin' cash and talkin' trash don't do it like it should
I realized I just couldn't buy her smile I'll keep tryin' on that Pan Am mile by mile
If she'd meet me in San Salvador I'd buy her a drink or two
We'd talk about our used to be and ride on to Peru
The time to get it right is here and now if she won't I'll move on
anyhow
My head is spinnin' around

But his love is that sticking brand
His kiss just lingers on my lips
And thrill me to my fingertips
People say I'm a fool
He's heartless and also cruel
But outside of that he's all right with me
Outside of that he's sweet as he can be
I love him as true as stars above
He beats me up but how he can love
I never loved like that since the day I was born
I said for fun I don't want you no more
And when I said that I made sweet papa sore
He blacked my eyes I couldn't see
Then he pawned the things he gave to me
But outside of that he's all right with me
I said for fun I don't want you no more
And when I said that I made sweet papa sore
When he pawned my things I said: you're a dirty old thief
Now then he turned around and knocks out both of my teeth
Outside of that he's all right with me
Whoa-ooh baby I love you
Ooh baby I love you yeah
Whoa-ooh baby I love you
Ooh baby I love you
Spoken:

When love has us right in its hands
Oh here in the dark

Woman your wonder don't end
And it's one of those nights
One of those nights again

Oh you know it has been such a hard hard journey I don't have to cry no more
Keep your light up burnin' so I can know the score
I got one more mile oh you know I only got one more mile to go
Oh you know my journey was so hard
but I don't have to worry 'bout you no more
Oh you know they tell me that thousands of schoolkids every one have a mate
The little girl that I love she the richest in the state
I got one more mile oh you know I only got one more mile to go
Oh you know my journey has been so hard
but I don't have to worry 'bout you no more
Oh you know I made a mistake for gamblin' I betted my money wrong
I was bettin' on my baby but she weren't even at home
I got one more mile oh you know I got one more mile to go
Oh you know it has been such a long journey
but I don't have to cry 'bout you no more
One more day one more day of being alone
One more day one more day of being alone
Got a letter from my baby sayin' she's on her way back home
Why don't you call me baby sayin' you'll bring you're bringin' your clothes back home
Why don't you call me baby sayin' you'll bring you're bringin' your clothes back home
You know I'm crazy about you baby but you been gone away too
long
Just one kind favor I ask of you
One kind favor I ask of you
One kind favor I ask of you
To see that my grave is kept clean
If you ever hear a church bell toll
If you ever hear a church bell toll
If you ever hear a church bell toll
You'll know by that I'm dead and gone
Dig my grave with a silver spade
Dig my grave with a silver spade
Dig my grave with a silver spade
Mark the place where I would lay
Just one kind favor I ask of you
One kind favor I ask of you
One kind favor I ask of you
See that my grave is kept clean
See that my grave is kept clean
See my grave is kept clean
I've always heard that haste makes waste
So I believe in takin' my time
The highest mountain can't be raced
It's something you must slowly climb
I want a slow and easy man
He needn't ever take the lead
'Cause I work on that longtime plan
And I ain't a-lookin' for no speed
I'm a one hour mama
So no one minute papa
Ain't the kind of man for me
Set your alarm clock papa
One hour that's proper
Then love me like I like to be
I don't want no lame excuses
'Bout my lovin' bein' so good
That you couldn't wait no longer
Now I hope I'm understood
I'm a one hour mama
So no one minute papa
Ain't the kind of man for me
I can't stand no greenhorn lover
Like a rookie goin' to war
With a load of big artillery
But don't know what it's for
He's got to bring me a reference
With a great long pedigree
And must prove he's got endurance
Or he don't mean that to me
I don't like no crowin' rooster
What just kicks a lick or two
Action is the only booster
Of just what my man can do
I don't want no imitation
My requirements ain't no joke
Cause I've got pure indignation
For a guy what's lost his stroke
I'm a one hour mama
So no one minute papa
Ain't the kind of man for me
Set your alarm clock papa
One hour that's proper
Then love me like I like to be
I may want love for one hour
Then decide to make it two
Takes an hour before I get started
Maybe three 'fore I'm through
I'm a one hour mama
So no one minute papa
Ain't the kind of man for me
You say "Come over baby come talk to me"
Then you drive me so crazy
I can't hardly see
If this keeps goin' on
I might just leave and not come back
I got one foot in your doorway
I got one foot on the path
Well you beg me to stay
then you order me to go
All this up and down
is wear and tear on my soul
I'm wonderin' if our future
is gonna look just like our past
I got one foot in your doorway
I got one foot on the path
Now I love you baby
don't get me wrong
But this heart of mine
may not be that strong
You got me on your line
reel me in or throw me back
I got one foot in your doorway
I got on foot on the path
You'd best thing about it baby
but don't take too long
If we can't get it right
I'll just be movin' on
I can't wait forever
for us to get this thing on track
I got one foot in your doorway baby
I got on foot on the path
Wanna tell you a story
about the house-man blues
I come home one Friday
had to tell the landlady I'd-a lost my job
She said that don't confront me
long as I get my money next Friday
Now next Friday come I didn't get the rent

So I goes to the landlady
I said "You let me slide"
I'll have the rent for you in a month

So said let me slide it on you know people

Loh' she was lovy-dovy
I come home one particular evening
The landlady said "You got the rent money yet"
I said "No can't find no job"
Therefore I ain't got no money to pay the rent
She said "I don't believe you're tryin' to find no job"
Said "I seen you today you was standin' on a corner
leaning up against a post"
I said "But I'm tired I've been walkin' all day"
She said "That don't confront me
long as I get my money next Friday"
Now next Friday come I didn't have the rent
and out the door I went
So I go down the streets

I know that was no
He said "I don't know man ah she kinda funny you know"
I said "I know everybody funny now you funny too"
So I go back home
I tell the landlady I got a job I'm gonna pay the rent
She said "Yeah" I said "Oh yeah"
And then she was so nice
loh' she was lovy-dovy
So I go in my room pack up my things and I go

Oh pretty woman she's the rising sun
Says all your cheap paint and powder ain't gonna help you none
She's a pretty woman right down to the bone
So you just might as well still leave your skin alone
Pretty woman
What's the matter with you
Can't make you love me no matter what I do
Oh pretty woman what you trying to do
You kept on foolin' around till I got stuck on you
So you just drop that mess and come down off your throne
Stop using my poor heart as a stepping stone
Pretty woman
What's the matter with you
Can't make you love me no matter what I do
Oh pretty woman that's all right for you
Now you just go on doing what you want to do
But someday when you thing you've got it made
You get in water deep enough so you can't wade
Pretty woman
What's the matter with you
Can't make you love me no matter what I do
Just like a flower I am fading away
The doctor call to see me most every day
But he don't do me no good why
Because I'm lonesome for you
And if you care for me
Then you will listen to my plea
Oh daddy look what you doin' look what you doin'
Oh daddy you with your foolin' think what you're losin'
All the little love I gave you
Is goin' to make you feel so awfully blue
When you miss me and long to kiss me
You'll curse the day that you ever quit me
Oh daddy think when you're all alone
You'll get so lonely just wait and see
But there will be someone else makin' love to me
Then daddy daddy you won't have no mama at all
Oh daddy look what you doin' look what you doin'
Oh daddy you and your foolin' think what you losin'
All the little love I gave you
Is goin' to make me feel so awfully blue
When you miss me and long to kiss me
You'll curse the day that you ever quit me
Oh daddy think when you're all alone
You know that you are getting old
You'll miss the way I baked your jelly roll
And daddy daddy you won't have no mama at all
I once lived the life of a millionaire
Spending my money I didn't care
Always taking my friends out for a good time
Buying champagne gin and wine
But just as soon as my dough got low
I couldn't find a friend no place I go
If I ever get my hands on a dollar again
I'm gonna squeeze it and squeeze it
Till the eagle grins
Nobody knows you when you're down and out
In your pocket not one penny
And your friends you haven't any
And as soon as you get on your feet again
Everybody is your long lost friend
It's mighty strange without a doubt but
Nobody wants you when you're down and out
You know folks I once had a mansion
Way up on the side of a hill
I'd give champagne and caviar parties
Just for fun and get a thrill
But you know things they just can't stay like that forever
And now I can't muscle up enough money
To buy a shot of gin
But you know if I ever get my hands on a dollar again
I'm gonna squeeze it and squeeze it till the eagle grins
It's mighty strange without a doubt
Nobody wants you
Nobody needs you
Nobody wants you when you're down and out
In a bakery shop today
I heard Miss Mandy Jenkins say
She had the best cake you see
And they were fresh as fresh could be
And as the people would pass by
You would hear Miss Mandy cry
Nobody in town can bake a sweet jelly roll like mine like mine
No other one in town can bake a sweet jelly roll so fine so fine
It's worth lots of dough the boys tell me so
It's fresh every day you'll hear 'em all say
Don't be no dunce just try it once
You'll be right in line
Somebody told me I made the best jelly roll in town I say in town
You must admit that I'm a jelly roll bakin' hound bakin' hound
Good jelly roll jelly roll is so hard to find
We always get the other kind
Nobody in town can bake a sweet jelly roll like mine
Somebody told me I made the best jelly roll in town I say in town
You must admit that I'm a jelly roll bakin' hound bakin' hound
Good jelly roll jelly roll from a bakery shop
Will surely make a pool frog hop
Nobody in town can bake a sweet jelly roll like mine like mine

Hop Scop Blues will make you do a lovely shake
They'll make you feel so grand when you join hand in hand
I'll never git tired of dancin' those Hop Scop Blues
Don't ever trust a woman until she's dead and buried
Yes don't ever trust a woman until she's dead and buried
One day she'll say that she loves you and the next day she'll throw you in the street
She'll smother you with kisses when her birthday comes around
But soon as she gets her presents she'll down talk you all over over town
No don't ever trust a woman until she's dead and buried
One day she'll say that she loves you and the next day she'll throw you in the street
She'll beg you for clothes and diamonds until you're all in hock
And then you'll come home one mornin' and your key won't fit the lock
Don't ever trust a woman until she's dead and buried
Well one day she'll say that she loves you the next day she'll throw you in the street
She'll call you every mornin' every mornin' noon and night
She'll call you in between times just to see if you're doin' alright
She'll ask to borrow five and then she'll beg for ten
And baby that five and ten you won't ever see again
Man don't ever trust a woman man until she's dead and buried
One day she'll say that she loves you and the next day she'll throw
you in the street
Three days of snow in Birmingham
Thought you would wonder where I am
Rang our number all night long
It's no comfort on the telephone
Ran out and caught a midnight flight
Thought a little love would make everything all right
The landlord said you moved away
And left me all your bills to pay
Look out baby you might have made your move too soon
Left me with a Keno card
This life in Vegas sure ain't hard
I ran it up to about fifty grand
Cashed it in and held it in my hand
That kind of word can get around
And make a lost love come up found
I hear you knocking baby at my door
But you know you ain't living here no more
It's too bad
I think you made your move too soon
I've been from Spain to Tokyo
From Africa to Ohio
I never tried to make the news
I'm just a man who plays the blues
I take my lovin' everywhere
I come back and they still care you know
One love ahead
One love behind
One in my arms and one on my mind
It's one thing baby
I never make my move too soon
I've been from Spain to Tokyo
From Africa to Ohio
I never tried to make the news
I'm just a man who plays the blues
I take my lovin' everywhere
I come back you know they still all care
One love ahead and one behind
One in my arms you know one on my mind
And it's one thing people
I never make my move too soon
Neighbor neighbor why you messin' in my life
Neighbor neighbor you've been talkin' to my wife
Tellin' her you seen me runnin' wild the other night runnin' wild the other night
A neighbor neighbor there's always one in every crowd
A neighbor neighbor tellin' lies and talkin' loud
You better watch your step now you might fall off your cloud you might fall off your cloud
Now I was walking down a dusty road when along came a neighbor of mine
He saw me walkin' with my head hung down he just had to stop and pass the time
Neighbor neighbor floatin' in the salty brine floatin' in the salty brine
Ah that is nature won't let me treat you right
Ah that is nature won't let me treat you right
I'm out lookin' on the other side
You know I love you want to stay with you day and night
You know I love you I want to stay with you day and night
I'm just out lookin' I'm usin' my sight
I'm workin' babe day and night
I'm workin' baby day and night
Ah that's nature won't let me come to your side
I'm sorry baby I'm sorry baby
I'm sorry baby I'm sorry baby
I'm sorry baby nature caused me to mess up my life
Did you ever hear about the burning
that happened way down in Natchez Mississippi town
Did you ever hear about the burning
that happened way down in Natchez Mississippi town
Those buildings got to burning there's my baby layin'on the ground
Charlotte Jones was there Luiza was there
Rosie Mae was there Louise was there
Did you ever hear about the burning
that happened way down in Natchez Mississippi town
I stood back was lookin' and the old building come tumble down
I've got a lovesick tale to tell to you
Though it ain't no affair of mine
It's 'bout a gal named Sue and a boy named Lou
They were fighting all the time
Sue came home one afternoon
And found an empty dining room
Without a word her turtledove had flown
She began to moan
My sweetie went away but he didn't say where
He didn't say when he didn't say why
Oh bid me goodbye
I'm blue as I can be
I know he loved another one but he didn't say who
He didn't say when he didn't say what
His mama has got
That took my sweetie from me
I'm like a little lost sheep
And I can't sleep
But I keep trying to forget
My trifling papa has left his mama all alone I groan
My sweetie went away but he didn't say where
He didn't say when he didn't say why
I know I'll die
Why don't he hurry home
My silent prayer is the love we knew
If it should reach all of the heart of you
I'll offer the heart you had manage to break
I'll offer the love that forgave your mistake
Deep in my heart you still belong to me
I only know I'll never never be free
Please don't consider the love a closed episode
The love that we knew comes to few
For my silent love is for you and only for you
My pretty girl is sitting in her room of red
My pretty girl lying on her furry bed
Pretty as the moonlight
I only want to treat her right
My pretty girl doing something to her hair
My pretty girl dressing up with special care
Pretty as the moonlight
I only want to treat her right
My pretty girl making me feel her man
My pretty girl hugging me when she can
Pretty as the moonlight
I only want to treat her right
My pretty girl sleeping in the still of night
My pretty girl glowing in the candlelight
Pretty as the moonlight
I only want to treat her right

Let everybody think I'm a little bit strange
Chorus:
Cause I love Muddy Water
It's dirty but it feels alright
I love Muddy Waters
I'm ready for the blues tonight-ooh yes I am
On my way to California

And I walked on into town
I found a cheap hotel
Got a twenty dollar room
And when I woke up the next day
It was four o'clock in the afternoon
Well I ain't gonna fuss and fight
I ain't stayin' up all night
Worryin' 'bout the things that I can't change
Let everybody think I'm a little bit strange
Chorus
Ooh why should I worry all night and day
Whatever it is
It's gonna be ok
Chorus

I looked out my window and saw my baby walk away
I thought Lord please stop her ain't gonna get drunk no mo'
I thought Lord please stop her ain't gonna get drunk no mo'
I hollered out my window "Come back baby please don't go"
I know she heard me callin' she looked back and waved her hand
I know she heard me callin' she looked back and waved her hand
I could hear her tell her mother "That's one no good man"
Well I watched my baby leave her mother had her by the hand
Well I watched my baby leave her mother had her by the hand
I'd give anything I have just to see my little girl again
I bought a spray last night 'n I sprayed all over my house
I bought a spray last night 'n I sprayed all over my house
Mosquitoes all around my door won't let nobody come out
Mosquitoes all around me mosquitoes everywhere I go
Mosquitoes all around me mosquitoes everywhere I go
No matter where I go they sticks their bills in me
I would say gallinipper these gallinippers bites too hard
I would say gallinipper these gallinippers bites too hard
I stepped back in my kitchen and they springing up in my back yard
Daddy came around every once in awhile
But momma she was there all the time
And summertime in Compton
Was not like TV
But we were right there
Where we needed to be
And the Thurmond boys
On peach street
With only their dad
So proud of themselves
And that old Pontiac they had
And miss brooks her bible
And her three little boys
At the double rock
Baptist church
Makin' a joyful noise
Chorus:
Well there's more than
One way home
Ain't no right way
Ain't no wrong
And whatever road you
Might be on
You find your own way
'Cause there's more than
One way home
Got me a job at the grocery store
Workin' weekdays after
School from to
Tommy John and Charlie were
The neighborhood stars
With their midsize homes
And their big fancy cars
And when the eagle flied on Friday
I'd go out and play
Wastin' time with Otis
Out on the dock of the bay
And my ticket to adventure
Was a ride on the bus
Different places
Different faces
But they were just like us
Chorus x
Now any this moonshine moonshine do harm to many men

- Hold him Luke he must be a bootlegger -
I've been drinking all night babe and the night before
But when I get sober I ain't gonna drink no more
'Cause my friend's left me standing in my door
My head goes round and around babe since my baby left town
I don't know if the river's running up or down
But that one thing certain is mama's going to leave town
You'll find me reeling and a-rocking howling like a hound
Catch the first train that's running Southbound
Oh stop you'll hear me saying
Stop right through my brain
Oh stop that train
So I can ride back home again
Here I'm upon my knees
Play that again for me
'Cause I'm about to be a-losing my mind
Boys I can't stand up I can't sit down
The man I love has done left town
I feel like screaming I feel like crying Lord
I've been mistreated folks and don't mind I'm dying
I'm going home I'm going to settle down
I'm going to stop my running around
Tell everybody that comes my way
I've got those moonshine
blues I say
I've got those moonshine blues
Well money's gettin' cheaper prices gettin' steeper
Found myself a woman but I just couldn't keep her
Times gettin' tougher than tough
Things gettin' rougher than rough
I make a lot of money I just keep spendin' the stuff
Well pork chops on the market ask the butcher for a pound
Couldn't buy a pork chop when I laid my money down
Times gettin' tougher than tough
Things gettin' rougher than rough
I make a lot of money just keep spendin' the stuff
Well politicians are tellin' folks to cut out on their meat
Why don't they cut the price an let the people eat
Times gettin' tougher than tough
Things gettin' rougher than rough
I make a lot of money I just keep spendin' the stuff
Well I can't afford to live I guess I'll have to try
Undertaker's got a union and it costs to much to die
Times gettin' tougher than tough
Things gettin' rougher than rough
I make a lot of money I just keep spendin' the stuff
Oh my Monday woman
Starch and iron my clothes
Monday woman
Starch and iron my clothes

Oh right along don't stop dead in your tracks
I can't go on with this song no more no more
I was born down in Dallas raised up in the city of the wind
Yeah I could spend a month of Sundays talkin' about the places I've been
Yeah I played the blues in England I visit with the queen
She really dug my style but queen is not my thing
I'm goin' back to Dallas back to the palace of the king
Hey they wanted me in Russia but Moscow was much too cold
Yeah I could have played down in Denmark but the girls was much too old
Yeah let me tell you something funny I don't know what they say
I can't find a Chitlins Pizza for any price I pay
I'm goin' back to Dallas back to the palace of the king
Oh living in the palace of the king
Yeah I'm living in the palace gives me service quite the same yeah
I can make you smile with every note I play
I can make you happy playin' the blues my way
I'm goin back to Dallas back to the palace of the king
Oh living in the palace of the king
Yeah I'm living in the palace never had service quite the same yeah
I been around the world I have many things
nothing makes me satisfied but this blues I sing
I'm goin' back to Dallas back to the palace of the king
Yeah I'm living in the palace of the king
Living in the palace of the king
Well now sittin' here so lonely feelin' oh so blue
My baby's tryin' to mistreat me and I don't know what to do
So I'm cryin' why do I have to feel this way
If I can't love my baby I can't live another day
Yeah I've loved her for such a long time to end it all this way
Sittin' here so lonely tears keep fallin' just like rain
So I'm cryin' why do I have to feel this way
If I can't love my baby I can't live another day
Yeah you know I love you baby I'll do anything for you
But when we start to fightin' I just get these same old blues
So I'm cryin' why do I have to feel this way
If I can't love my baby I can't live another day
Yeah now when I first met you baby at a dance and we did fine
Now we're together and it's a total waste of time
So I'm cryin' why do I have to feel this way
If I can't love my baby I can't live another day
Well I guess it's just my own fault the truth I cannot hide
But if I ever get her back again I'll stay right by her side
I won't be cryin' I'll stay happy that a way
I'll be lovin' my little baby every night and every day
Let me be your little wheel babe 'til your big wheel come
Let me be your little wheel babe 'til your big wheel come

Let me roll with you baby roll you all over town

Long look in the mirror we've come face to face
Wishin' all the love we took for granted

Life without you all the love you passed my way
The angels have waited for so long now they have their way
Take your place
Hello there my old friend
not so long ago it was 'till the end
We played outside in the pouring rain
on our way up the road we started over again
You're livin' a dream wo you on top
My mind is achin' Lord it won't stop
That's how it happens livin' life by the drop
Up and down that road in our worn out shoes
talkin' 'bout good things and signin' the blues
You went your way I stayed behind
We both knew it was just a matter of time
You're livin' a dream wo you on top
My mind is achin' Lord it won't stop
That's how it happens livin' life by the drop
No wasted time we're alive today
Churnin' up the past there's no easier way
Time's been between us a means to an end
God it's good to be here walkin' together my friend
You're livin' a dream wo you on top
My mind is achin' Lord it won't stop
That's how it happens livin' life by the drop

We ain't sayin' nothin' we ain't sayin' a thing
Let's make it me and you
Let's make it let's make it let's make it
You know by now that I've been passed
Through an awful lot of hands
And all I have is what is left
From ten thousand one night stands
Sometimes I feel like I was there
When the blues began
With this crying guitar holding me
Like a woman holds a man
Let me make you cry a little longer
Let me make you high a little longer
Oh I want to try a little longer
Make some woman sigh a little longer
At night sometimes I can still feel
Every place I've ever been
I feel it in my music
And it all comes back again
You know I've played for city lights
And for stars above
And every note I ever play
I always play for love
Let me make you cry a little longer
Let me make you high a little longer
Oh I want to try a little longer
Make some woman sigh a little longer
Oh wee baby I declare you sure look fine
Oho wee baby I declare you sure look fine
A girl like you has made many a man change his mind
Baby when you walk you know you shake like a willow tree
Baby when you walk you know you shake like a willow tree
A girl like you would just love to make a fool of me
Let me love you baby let me love you baby
Let me love you little darlin' let me love you baby
Let me love you darlin' 'till your good love drives me crazy
Let me love you baby let me love you baby
Let me love you little darlin' let me love you baby
Let me love you darlin' 'till your good love drives me crazy
Now lend me your love little girl please lend me your love
Lend me your love baby please lend me your love
I know you hear me keep moanin' moanin' just like Noah's dove
You got a mortgage on my love girl there really is no doubt
You got a mortgage on my love girl there really is no doggone doubt
But someday I be lucky enough to find another woman
gonna buy your love mortgage out
I want to shake hands with my partner and ask him how come he's here
I want to shake hands with my partner ask him how come he's here
I had a wreck with my family they're gonna send me to the electric chair
I wonder why they electrocute a man at the one o'clock hour of night
And I wonder why they electrocute a man at the one o'clock hour of night
Because the current is much stronger when the folks has turned out all the lights
I sat in the electrocutin' room my arms folded up and cryin'
I sat in the electrocutin' room my arms folded up and cryin'
And my baby asked the question was they gonna electrocute that man of mine
Lemon get me a taxi to take me away from here
Lemon get me a taxi to take me all away from here
I haven't had a good friend in this world since they lead Lemon to the electric chair
I feel like jumpin' in the ocean I feel like jumpin' in the deep blue sea
I feel like jumpin' in the ocean and like jumpin' into the deep blue sea
But nothin' like that wrecked in my heart when they brought my electrocuted daddy to me
I can't believe in what I've seen I been forsaken I been deceived Cast aside and left behind I can't believe my own eyes
I been waiting for the glory of the coming of the Lord I heard a lot of stories but all my prayers have been ignored I been waiting in the wings between the ocean and the shore But this time I'm leaving to stay I'm walking away
I seen the red sky in the morning I seen the low tide slipping away I do believe I'll take warning taking my leave to stay
Chorus
Like an angel afraid to fly
Like the last lonely rose hung on the vine
You better leave you better leave my little girl alone
You better leave you better leave my little girl alone
Lord before I get evil man and I go and do something wrong
You call my house just yesterday
I picked up the extension and I heard every word you said
Why don't you just go on man and leave my little girl alone
Lord before I get evil man and I go and do something wrong
You call my house all hours of the night
Let me tell you mister that's a sure sure way to start a fight
Why don't you just go on man and leave my little girl alone
Lord before I get evil man and I'm gonna do something wrong
All day long
I've been thinking about you baby
With loving you on my mind
I couldn't hardly wait
To get home to you baby
So I could do a little overtime
Baby baby you've been so good to me
I want to understand
If I want a do right woman
Then I've got to be a do right man
So I'm gonna lay another log
On the fire baby
Before my flame gets too low
Yes I'm gonna lay another log
On the fire baby
Trying to keep Jody from my door
Oh I know I've been neglecting you
Lately baby
Just trying to make ends meet
But tonight I'm gonna be
On my love job baby
Me working on you you working on me
Wine music and a little candlelight
Just to help me unwind
'Cause I know
I got so much love to give baby
And tonight I'm gonna take my time
I'm gonna lay another log
On the fire baby
Before my flame gets too low
Said I'm gonna lay another log
On the fire baby
Just trying to keep Jody from my door
I'm gonna lay another log
On the fire baby
Before my flame gets too low
Yes I'm gonna lay another log
On the fire baby
Just gotta keep Jody from my door
I'm gonna lay another log
On the fire baby
Before my flame gets too low
Think I'm gonna lay another log
On the fire baby
Just trying to keep Jody from my door
Been playin' blues all-a my life
Always have been that way
But I've a got tired of these bills comin' in
And I don't have the money to pay
That is why I gotta put it down
So I'm gonna tell ya again
It's gonna be my last time around
Well please don't try to tell me
'Bout all the money I made
Last night I went out an' I played all night
When it was over I didn't get paid
That is why I gotta put it down
So I'm gonna tell ya again
This gonna be my last time around
Well I know I'm in the wrong business
That don't bother me
I'm gonna take my saxophone an' sell it
I'm goin' down in Tennessee
That is why I gotta put it down
So I'm gonna tell ya again
This gonna be my last time around
Minutes seem like hours hours seem like days
Minutes seem like hours hours seem like days
It seems like my daddy won't stop his evil ways
Seems like every minute's going to be my last
Seems like every minute's going to be my last
If I can't tell my future I won't tell my past
The brook runs into the river river runs into the sea
The brook runs into the river river runs into the sea
If I don't run into my daddy somebody ought to bury me
If anybody asks you who wrote this lonesome song
If anybody asks you who wrote this lonesome song
Tell 'em you don't know the writer but Ma Rainey put it on
You wonder why I'm grievin' and feelin' blue
All I do is moan and cry
With me you'd be in sympathy if you only knew
And here's the reason why:
Have you heard what that mean old judge has done to me
He told the jury not to let my man go free
There I stood with my heart so full of misery
He must die on the gallows that was the court's decree
I walked the floor until his time was through
The judge he said "There's nothin' you can do"
He must die on the gallows by his neck be hung
He must pay with his life when that there trap is sprung
He refused folks to talk until it was too late
He gave his life to satisfy the State
When they pull the black cap over my daddy's face
Lord I beg the sheriff to let me take his place
Now everyday I seem to see that news
I cry to hide my tears but what's the use
Thirteen steps with his lovin' arms bound to his side
With a smile on his face that's how my daddy died
It's the last fair deal goin' down
last fair deal goin' down
It's the last fair deal goin' down good Lord
on that Gulfport Island Road
Ida Belle don't you cry this time
Ida Belle don't you cry this time
If you cry about a nickel you'll die 'bout a dime
I wouldn't cry but the money it ain't mine
My captain 's so mean on me
My captain's so mean on me
My captain's so mean on me good Lord
on that Gulfport Island Road
Workin' my way back home
Workin' my way back home
I'm workin' my way back home good Lord
on that Gulfport Island Road
It's the last fair deal goin' down last fair deal goin' down
It's the last fair deal goin' down good Lord
on that Gulfport Island Road
On that Gulfport Island Road
On that Gulfport Island
Bad luck has come to stay
Trouble never end
My man has gone away
With a girl I thought was my friend
I'm worried down with care
Lordy can't you hear my prayer
Lady Luck Lady Luck
Won't you please smile down on me
There's the time friend of mine

Since my man's done turned me loose
I've got those Lady Luck blues I mean

Lady Luck Lady Luck
Won't you please smile down on me
There's the time friend of mine

I've got his picture turned upside down

Since my man is gone I'm all confused
I've got those Lady Luck blues
Find my good man

Feel I got to go
Gonna leave here running
Walking is both too slow
I'm going back to the border
Baby where I'm better known
Because you haven't done nothing baby
But draw the good man from home

Just before I go
'Cause when I leave this time little girl
I won't be back no more

Is the glow in your eyes
Gain and power and riches
Are thrills I'll never miss
For the key to my kingdom
Is the thrill of your kiss
Baby I have more
Than fame and fortune
Every time I hold your hand

Somewhere in this world the one you waited for
Come along and find you turn the key your door
Hurts my soul babe when I find you feeling rough
Life is so bad baby when you find the key to love
One dark and stormy night Bill Jones was feeling blue
Things didn't seem just right so he didn't know just what to do
I said: Bill please tell me ain't you satisfied
He looked around so pitiful then to me he replied
Keeps on a-rainin' look how it's rainin'
Papa he can't make no time
Wind keeps blowing cold wind blowing
Soon I'll find a southern clime
In the wintertime when it starts to snow
You know you pretty mama's got to have some dough
Keeps on rainin' look how it's rainin'
Papa he can't make no time
Ain't the snow just beautiful some people say
But I'd rather see it in a moving picture play
Keeps on snowin' look how it's snowin'
Papa he can't make no time

Hello my old friend
It's been awhile
All our old clothes
Are back in style
We went our separate ways
Only to return
To face a lesson
We failed to learn
We didn't understand the truth
We were blinded by the eyes of youth
But time kept on moving
And a change has come
You think that I don't know
Where you're coming from
Chorus:
'Cause I feel just like you
And I cry just like you
But I heal just like you
And under my skin
I'm just like you
You gave your love and your innocence
And they took away your confidence
Well I'm not those women
I'm not those men
Put your arms around me
I am your friend
Chorus
Bridge:
You and everybody else
When I get hurt
I cry for help
And I've got secrets
That god only knows
And god knows I feel
Chorus
I just got paid today got me a pocket full of change
Said I just got paid today got me a pocket full of change
If you believe like workin' hard all day just step in my shoes and take my pay
I was born my papa's son when I hit the ground I was on the run
I had one glad hand and the other behind you can have yours just give me mine
When the hound dog barkin' in the black of the night stick my hand in my pocket everything's all right
I just got paid today got me a pocket full of change
Said black sheep black do you got some wool
Yes I do man my bag is full
It's the root of evil and you know the rest but it's way ahead of
what's second best
Spoken: Douse that light
Now I just got back from baby's we been rollin' all night long
I said I just got back from baby's we been rollin' all night long
She come on likes and loves me but I feel like somethin' wrong
Now sometimes I go see baby and sometimes she come see me
I said sometimes I go see baby and sometimes baby come see me
I got a funny funny feelin' I'm not the only man she sees
Now I just got back from baby's big white house on the hill
I said I just got back from baby's big white house on the hill
If her lovin' don't get me I know her husband will
Some people die for hate
Some die for love
Some die because
They don't have mate
But all I want
All I want is a little love
All I've ever wanted people

A little bit of love A little bit of love
All I want All I want

Well I wanna tell the story about a hard luck guy
Nobody seems to love me I guess that's the reason why
Just dreams dreams all night long and through the day
Yes and it's so sad oh to break my heart this way
Yes I'm not handsome or romantic I don't have wavy hair
Won't you girls please have mercy the way you treat me ain't fair
Why does bad luck follow me
Oh dreams seems that's all that's left for me
Well I just can't get no place with a doggone thing a plan
Every girl I try my luck on belongs to some other man
Where where where is the one I'm dreaming of
All gone gone with last night's dreams of love
Yes last night as I lay sleepin' I dreamed about a queen
And it hurt me so bad people
To wake up and find out it was just a dream
Dream dream is all I can do
Oh I'm so tired dreamin' dreams dreams
That won't come true
Ridin' down a highway in my ragged Greyhound bus
Wanted to buy me some food but my money didn't have enough

Spoken:
Memphis Slim: Say look-a-her man do you know Jaspar's got a new gal in town
Man replies: Sho' nuf man
Memphis Slim: Yeah man
Other man: Well tell me about her
Now he's got a girl she's shaped like a hog
Her voice reminds me of an old bull dog
Her hair looks just like a chinchilla coat
You get close up on her she smells just like a goat
You know she's smellin'
Got bo all the time
And she thinks soap and water
Is a doggone crime
Now her ears are so long her nose is flat
Her head's so big she can't wear no hat
Now her jaws are swollen and she's got one eye
She looks like a wreck that happened last July
She's a ugly
Got bo all the time
And she thinks soap and water
Is a doggone crime
Now she must-a been her mother only child
She should be a gorilla because she sure is wild
Got ways like a monkey and sly as a fox
She should be in a chain gang breakin' up rocks
Because she's ugly
Got bo all the time
And she thinks soap and water
Is a doggone crime
Now she got legs like a needle
She ain't got no chin
She's a beautiful woman for the shape she's in
Her feet look like swings way out on a limb
That's why her mother put her off on him
Because she bo-gish
She's got bo all the time
And she thinks soap and water
Is a doggone crime
'Gimme a little taste of drum'
'And a piece of bass'
'And eyes of organ'
'Gimme a little piano'
'Now let it all hang out'
Lord this house is goin' to get raided yes sir
Thirty days in jail with my back turned to the wall to the wall
Thirty days in jail with my back turned to the wall
Look here mister jail keeper put another gal in my stall
I don't mind being in jail but I got to stay there so long so long
I don't mind being in jail but I got to stay there so long so long
Well every friend I had is done shook hands and gone
You better stop your man from ticklin' me under my chin under my chin
You better stop your man from ticklin' me under my chin
'Cause if he keeps on ticklin' I'm sure gonna take him on in
Good morning blues blues how do you do how do you do
Good morning blues blues how do you do
Well I just come here to have a few words with you
When you've got no more assurance
Than a great big hunk of lead
If you don't respond to romance
Jack you're dead
When a chick is smiling at you
Even though there's nothing said
If you stand there like a statue
Jack you're dead
You've been always kicking
But you stubbed your toes
When you ups and kicks the bucket
Just like old man Mose
When you get no kicks from loving
And you blow your top instead
It's a fact that you ain't living
Jack you're dead
If you just ain't got nobody
Since you've gone and lost your head
Rigor Mortis has set in daddy
Jack you're dead
What's the use of having muscles
When your life hangs by a thread
If you ain't got no red corpuscles
Jack you're dead
You've been always kicking
But you stubbed your toes
When you ups and kicks the bucket
Just like old man Mose
When you get no kicks from loving
And the news begins to spread
All the cats will holler "Murder"
Jack you're dead
All the breaths leaked out of you
When your friends gather round the bed
And look at you and say "Um um um don't he look natural"
When that happens to you daddy
Jack you're dead
Don't'cha know
don't'cha know
I love you ev'ry night
Don't'cha know baby
don't'cha know babe
I love you no matter what they say
I still love you
I still care
I don't care what the world say
but I still love you
I still I still
I still love you
I still I still
Care for my baby
No matter what they say
What they do
I still love you
I still I still
Care for your baby
No matter what you do what they say
You still my baby
You still my baby
Little baby
Little baby
Little baby
Hmm hmm
I'm gonna tell you just the way I feel
No use in waiting around
I've got this feeling that it might be real
and that's just from the sound
Oh my heart when I heard you laugh
and when I saw that smile
You made me feel like I was alive again
I hadn't felt that in a while
But I don't want to waste your time
'Cause if I'm not the right girl or
it's not the right time for you
Here's what I'm gonna do
I'll send this song out to you
Oh then it's up to you
Now don't you worry that you'll break my heart
Don't make no difference to me
I've had it happen once or twice before
Won't need no sympathy
I'll probably find something to keep my mind very occupied
I think I'll read some book on my list
or take a long walk outside
But I don't want to waste your time
'Cause if I'm not the right girl or
it's not the right time for you
Here's what I'm gonna do
I'll send this song out to you
Oh then it's up to you
Oh it's up to you baby it's up to you baby
Oh it's up to you baby it's up to you baby
And while I don't want to waste your time
I just ask that you maybe play it out in your mind
And if your heart starts talking to you
Just hear what it's saying 'cause
It might be telling you what to do
Oh it's up to you baby it's up to you baby
Oh it's up to you baby it's up to you baby
It's too bad things are going so tough with me
Well it's too bad things are going so tough with me
Well no matter what I do seem like ev'rything happen to me
I used to have a car and it was painted white an' black
I used to have a car and it was painted white an' black
Well I couldn't keep up the payments and the man he took it back
Yeah
Now I used to smoke cigars
The very best in town
But bad luck an' trouble
Is bound to get me down
It's too bad things are going so tough with me
Well no matter what I do
Seem like ev'rything I do happen to me
People Got Money
Still Got problems
Got to the doctor
And try to solve them
Anyway you look at it
It's still called the blues
Baby needs new shoes
Mama needs a new dress
Daddy's out scufflin'
Tryin' to do his best
Anyway you look at it
It's still called the blues
Makes no difference
What you do or say
The blues might still
Come your way
Just when you think
Your trouble's about to end
Along comes something
And start it all over again
You party on a Saturday
Go to church on Sunday
Fun leaves you because
Gotta work on Monday
Anyway you look at it
It's still called the blues
Makes no difference
What you do or say
The blues might still
Come your way
Just when you think
Your trouble's about to end
Along comes something
And start it all over again
Ain't got no money
To pay the rent

When things go wrong go wrong with you

It had to be you
It had to be you
I've wandered around
Finally found
Somebody who
Could make me be true
Could make me be blue
And even be glad
Just to be sad
Thinking of you
Some others I've seen
Might never be mean
Might never be cross
Try to be boss
They wouldn't do
For nobody else
Gave me a thrill
With all your faults
I love you still
It had to be you
Wonderful you
It had to be you
Some others I've seen
Might never be mean
Might never be cross
Or try to be boss
But they wouldn't do
'Cause nobody else
Gave me a thrill
With all your faults
I love you still
It had to be you
Had to be you
Had to be you
It had to be you
Wonderful you
It had to be you
It had to be you
Wonderful you
It had to be you
Had to be you
Wonderful you yeah
You know it ain't right just to treat me this a way
Well you know it ain't right just to treat me this a way
Well you know my baby have you home one day
You know it ain't right just to treat me like you do
Well you know it ain't right just to treat me like you do
Well you know my baby coming home to you
You know it ain't right baby stay out all night long
Well you know it ain't right baby stay out all night long
Well you know my baby you done something wrong
I gotta a girl who's always late
Anytime we have a date
But I love her
Yes I love her
I'm gonna walk up to her gate
And see if I can get it straight
'Cause I want her
I'm gonna ask her
Is you is or is you ain't my baby
The way you're acting lately makes me doubt
You is still my baby baby
Seems my flame in your heart's done gone out
A woman is a creature that has always been strange
Just when you're sure of one you find
She's gone and made a change
Is you is or is you ain't my baby
Maybe baby's found somebody new
Or is my baby still my baby true
Caught in quicksand
Starting to sink
So tired of struggling
That my mind can barely think
Don't know where I'm going
Lord I don't know what I'm gonna do
Fuel supply is finished
Ain't nothing left to burn
I need someone to help me
But I don't know which way to turn
I know I don't have much of a choice
I'll go out of my mind
Or into the night
Rolling and tumbling
Spinning end over end
Got to have some peace and quiet
So I can find myself again
Ask me what's the matter
Hey I don't know what to say
People all around me
But I'm so alone
I guess they'd like to help me
But I have to do it on my own
I know I don't have much of a choice
I'll go out of my mind
Or into the night

I can't save a cent
It takes all of my money
Just to eat and pay my rent
I got the blues
Got those inflation blues
You know I'm not one
Of those high brows
I'm average Joe to you
I came up eating cornbread
Candied yams and chicken stew
Now you take that paper dollar
It's only that in name
The way that buck has shrunk
It's a lowdown dirty shame
That's why I got the blues
Got those inflation blues
Mr President
Please cut the price of sugar
I wanna make my coffee sweet
I wanna smear some butter on my bread
And I just got to have my meat
When you start rationing
You really played the game
And things are going up
And up and up and up
And my check remains the same
That's why I got the blues
Got those inflation blues
I'm in the mood
I'm in the mood for love

She go off every day and she won't come home 'till night
"I'll be home" well last week that's what she said
"I'll be home" well last week that's what she said
She don't care if I don't eat
'Cause she don't know how the rent is paid
She's a gamblin' woman she chases men in between
She's a gamblin' girl she chases men in between
She mistreats me and she cheats me
Meanest woman I ever seen
The kid's in bed I lay awake 'till broad daylight
The kid's in bed I lay awake 'till broad daylight
Every now and then I wonder will my baby be home tonight
Wait a minute baby
Don't leave just yet
I can explain baby
But it looks like the more I talk
The madder you get
It's not what you think it is
Trust me I wouldn't do you no harm
She means nothing to me
The whole time I was imagining
It was you in my arms
You in my arms
Chorus:
I was wrong
And I admit it
My explanations
Don't seem to get it
I was wrong
And my heart can't take it
If you leave me now
I'm not gonna make it
I'm not gonna make it-no
What about the good times baby
What about all the fun we had together
It meant a lot to me baby
It must have meant something to you
Well ok I see your point
But baby please
Don't let a little thing like this come between us
Cause our love is bigger than this
It's more than this
It's bigger than the universe
It's bigger than life
Chorus x
I was blind and I could not see
That you were gettin' away from me
But now I know that you are gone
I live by the night
And slumber through the day
Because life don't seem worth livin' anyway
If I could only see
Life would be so miserable to me
Tell me why my love want leave in misery
Oh now I haven't be true
But this I want to be my wife
So baby please please think of you and me
If I could only see
Life would be so miserable to me
Why would the one I love want to leave in misery
Oh haven't been true all of my life
Ah but this one I want want her to be my wife
So baby please baby please think of you and me
I want you to love me love your baby slow
I want you to love me love you baby slow

I want you to love me till the house stand on my head
I want you to love me till the house stand on my head

Have you ever wanted someone
And you thought they didn't want you
Have you ever ever wanted someone
And you thought they didn't want you
You know what you wanted
To say to them people
But you were afraid she may walk away
Someone like you baby
Someone like you I ain't never had

So whatever you do baby
Please leave me a way
To get in touch with you
Oh whatever ever you do baby
Please leave me a way
To get in touch with you

When you leave I'll be so sad
The spark in your eye sets my soul on fire
your voice is like a angel above
The touch of your hand woman drives me insane
but baby I want's to be loved
I'm crazy 'bout every little thing you do
I even cherish your hug
Your kisses so sweet honey they can't be beat
but baby I want's to be loved
Every time I ask ya for a date

The trouble I've been havin' seem like I was raised in a orphan home
My mother died an left me when I was only two years old
My mother died an left me when I was two years old
An' the trouble I've been havin' the Good Lord only knows
I've been treated like an orphan an' been workin' like a slave
I've been treated like an orphan an' I've been workin' like a slave
An' if I never get my revenge evilness will carry me to my grave
Now I've been havin' trouble ever since I've been grown
Lord knows I've been havin' trouble trouble trouble ever since I was grown
Well I'm too old for the orphans an' too young for the old folks
home
All my life I've caught it hard
All of my life I have caught it hard
I've been abused and I've been scorned
I feel so bad it ain't gonna last
I feel so bad this ain't gonna last
I've been scorned and I've been kicked out
I've been abused I've been talked about
I've been abused I've been talked about

I've been abused and I've been kicked out
I don't have to know your name
Unless you really want me too
All I really want to know
Is what you want to do
Hope there's something you like
In something that you see
I don't have that much to say for me
I've always been lonely
But don't be afraid
I've always been lonely
Like a song never played
I've always been lonely
But if you come with me tonight
And stayed
At least we'd know
It wasn't loneliness we made
You don't have to know my past
It's much too much for me and you
If the sadness has to show
I guess I'll let it through
We can go till it's gone
And give it all we've got
Sometimes anything can mean a lot
Yeah I stay in the mood for you 'cause I just can't help myself
Yeah I stay in the mood for you 'cause I just can't help myself
You've always fooling around givin' my love to somebody else
Still I stay in the mood for you and I can see you everywhere I go
Still I stay in the mood for you and I can see you everywhere I go
Well if something soon don't happen my heart is gonna break I know
Well you said that you love me you've sworn that you'll be true
But now you're tellin' stronger that I'm just a fool you know
But I stay in the mood for you 'cause I just can't help myself
Please come back to me baby 'cause I'm tired of livin' by myself
I've got somethin' to tell you baby don't let it break your heart
So long together now we've got to part

You told me that you loved me said you loved me all your life
I caught you 'round the corner tellin' that same lie twice
You know I'm tired of findin' frogs for snakes

And let bygones be bygones
And troubles be long gone

Still you's a mean little thing
Well you told me that you love me
You cross your heart to die
But I found out baby bye bye
I'm leavin'
Woman I got to put you down
Well if you can't treat me right
Ain't no use for me hangin' around
Well early in the morning before I rise
You lay that role in your bloodshot eyes
You's a mean little thing
Mean little thing as you can be
Well if you can't treat me right
Still you's a mean little thing
I'm leavin'
I'm leavin'
I'm leavin'
I'm leavin'
I've been around the world seen everything
And if it's love you want baby just give me a ring
I can't lose with the stuff I use
I'm the king of the blues
I've loved in sunshine I've loved in the rain
All of the women who know me call that loving man
I can't lose with the stuff I use
I'm the king of the blues
Some people go to school to try and learn their trade
Yes but I'm a lover a lover by nature
That's why I know I know I know I've got it made
Yes you might think I'm jokin' or just havin' fun
But they tell me the reason I'm the king
I'm a lovin' son of a gun
I can't lose with the stuff I use
I'm the king of the blues
I'm in the wrong business
I swear I ain't lyin'

Should've been like Michael Jackson

And give me account of every dime she spend

I'm gonna do the same thing
The same thing they been doing to me
She gotta make me think she loves me
By staying in her place
And sleep in another room
So she won't be snorin' in my face

My song is a serious matter
It reflects what I feel
If I say I love you I mean it
'Cause in my song
Every line is for real
Every man or woman
Enjoys going home
To a peaceful situation
To give love and receive love
Without any complications
Whether my tune is short or long
Whether my lyrics are weak or strong
I like to live the love
That I sing about in my song
I like to live the love
That I sing about in my song
Music is love
And my love is music
In perfect harmony
So when I sing
I have sung all about
The love of you and me
I never got angry with my guitar
'Cause when I strike a chord
It gives me what I wanna hear
So I'm finding out that
We are quite like my song together my dear
Outside answers
Should always be forbidden
Problems should be solved
And never hidden
I like to live the love
That I sing about in my song
I like to live the love
That I sing about in my song
I know you don't love me no more
No more no no more
And I don't wanna be hurt anymore
Anymore
I love so hard
Everything I did was no joy
If I can't love you right baby
I don't have to love you at all
I know you don't want me no more
No more no no more
And I need someone else
Who's gonna love me more
Love me more

Anymore
Love me more
After you have put me down

And every time my front doorbell rings
Some angry six foot man
With a knife in his hand
They say I'm in love with a woman
That works down at the Chicken Shack
They say Deacon Jones' wife
Gave me a brand new Cadillac
That's why I gotta move
I gotta get out of my neighborhood
I tell you the people
They tell lies on me
Hey they just don't mean me
No doggone good
My landlady came by my apartment
She came by just to make up my bed
But it took her all night long
Can you imagine what the neighbors said
That's why I gotta move
Hey I gotta get out
Of my neighborhood
I tell you the people
They tell lies on me
Hey they just don't mean me
No doggone good
Hey I gotta move
Hey I gotta move

No doggone good
Nobody loves me but my mother
Sometimes I think
She could be jiving too

And she could be jiving too
Now I think you know
Why I act funny baby
Oh when you do the things you do
I got to leave this woman but I ain't got nowhere else to go

You see she owns everything including the carpet on the floor
When I was givin' her my money she treated me like I was BB King
Hey when I was givin' her my money she treated me like I was BB King
Now I ain't got no money left now she treats me like I'm not even a human bein'
I got to leave this woman I can't take this kind of treatment no more
Got to leave this woman I can't take this kind of treatment no more
I've got one big problem I ain't got nowhere to go
Hey all the pretty furniture she got I even bought her a mink coat too
Yeah all the furniture she got I even bought her that mink coat too
Now that we've got a divorce that's what she put me through
I got to leave this woman but I ain't got nowhere else to go
I got to leave this woman can't take this kind of treatment no more
She owns everything even the carpet on the floor
I'm picking up on a signal that's in the air tonight
It's sparkin' my receiver it feels like dynamite
I got the message but I wanna get it straight from you
My mind is electric I'm about to blow a fuse
The cockpit is empty so shoot it down the tube
I got the message but I wanna get it straight from you
I've got to make a connection I'm on needles and pins
Workin' up a printout and I'm gonna zero in
I got the message but I wanna get it straight from you
I got the key to the highway

I'm gonna roam this highway untill the day I die
Yes when the moon peep o'er the mountain

That you really care
We've talked it out
We did our best
And still it ain't going nowhere
It feels like our forever
just ended yesterday
And all our tomorrow's
Were simply tossed away
Should I stay should I go I don't know
Could it be I've always
Known it all along
And didn't have the courage
To tell you what was wrong
What's the in cryin
Why should we be sad
Maybe in the long run
It really ain't so sad
Should I stay should I go I don't know
Whatever I tell myself
Whatever I do
I can't get a hold on nothing
And I can't break through
Whenever I feel myself
Slipping away
I'm gonna hold on
There's a time to walk away
And a time to learn
A time will come when Ill know
Just when and where to turn
Until we know the answer
Faith is all we have
Our trust is in the moment
Fear is in the past
I don't care what my baby do
Long as I'm doin' what she's doin'
I don't care where my baby go
Long as I'm goin' where she's goin'
I don't care if my baby play
Long as it's me that she's playin'
I don't care where my baby stay
Long as I stay where she's stayin'
A man an' a dog they tell me
Have a lot in common
The dog chases cars
And the man chases woman
I don't care what my baby do
Long as I'm doin' what she's doin'
I don't care where my baby go
Yes long as I'm goin' where she's goin'
I don't care if my baby plays

Alone with my canary
To leave a man alone with my woman
Is unnecessary
I don't care what my baby do
No long as I'm doin' what she's doin'

Long as I'm goin' where she's goin'
Ya can't trust a bear
Alone with your honey

No I didn't know babe you was lovin' somebody else
I didn't know but I know now
If heartaches brought fame
In love's crazy game
I'd be a legend in my time
If they gave gold statuettes
For tears and regrets
I'd be a legend in my time
But they don't give awards
And there's no praise or fame
For a heart that's been broken
Over love that's in vain
If loneliness meant world acclaim
Then everyone would know my name
I'd be a legend in my time
But they don't give awards
And there's no praise or fame
For a heart that's been broken
Over love that's in vain
If loneliness meant world acclaim
Then everyone would know my name
I'd be a legend in my time
I'd be a legend in my time
Those happy hours
That we once knew
Though long ago
Still makes me so blue
They say that time
Heals a broken heart
But time has stood still
Since we've been apart

It's useless to say

Men killing their brothers Nobody wants to go down alone in this age of uncertainty
Love's worth more than gold
I'd sleep outside your window
if that would make you see
That I'm the only one for you
and you're the only one for me
Well I ain't superstitious black cat just cross my trail
Well I ain't superstitious oh the black cat just cross my trail
Don't sweep me with no broom I might get put in jail
When my right hand itches I gets money for sure
When my right hand itches I gets money for sure
But when my left eye jumps somebody's got to go
Well I ain't superstitious black cat just cross my trail
Well I ain't superstitious black cat just cross my trail
Don't sweep me with no broom I just might get put in jail
Well the dogs are howlin all over the neighborhood
Whoa the dogs are howlin all over the neighborhood
That is true sign of death baby that ain't no good
Well I'm not superstitious blow that black cat across my trail
Well I'm not superstitious a black cat across my trail
Don't sweep me with no broom I just might get put in jail
That's bad luck for me
There's a saying going 'round and I begin to think it's true
It's awful hard to love someone when they don't care 'bout you
Once I had a lovin' man as good as many in this town
But now I'm sad and lonely for he's gone and turned me down now
I ain't got nobody and nobody cares for me
I got the blues the weary blues
And I'm sad and lonely won't somebody come and take a chance with me
I'll sing sweet love songs honey all the time
If you'll come and be my sweet baby mine
'Cause I ain't got nobody and nobody cares for me
Won't somebody go and find my man and bring him back to me
It's awful hard to be alone and without sympathy
Once I was a loving gal as good as any in this town
but since my daddy left me I'm a gal with her heart bowed down
Everyday baby when the sun go down
I get with my friends an' I begin to clown
I don't care what the people are thinkin'
I ain't drunk I'm just drinkin'
But you're so high
Oh man you know I ain't high

What ya'all doin' drinkin'
But you're so high
Actually I'm just havin' fun man

Bo Diddley done had a farm

Women here women there
women women women everywhere
But one little girl lived on a hill
she rustled and tussled like Buffalo Bill
One day she decided she'd go for a ride
with a pistol and a sword by her side
She rolled right up to my front door
knocked an' knocked 'til her fist got sore
When she turned and walked away
all I could hear my baby say
Hey Bo Diddley oh Bo Diddley
Hey Bo Diddley oh Bo Diddley
Saw my baby run across the field

Have a ham sandwich
Remember if you can
When cotton was picked by hand
Down in Dixie
Under southern skies
Working from sun to sun
Remember if you will
Lightnin' from a whiskey still
Blues in the breeze
The sweet magnolia trees
A little church house up on the hill
Chorus:
I can hear the delta calling
From the light of a distant star
I can see my future
And I can feel my past
When Henry plays his steel guitar
Won't you take me back in time
Free me from this crime
Well I have no shame
And I have no blame
It's time for us to be moving on
I can hear the delta calling
From the light of a distant star
I can see my future
And I can feel my past
When Henry plays his steel guitar
Chorus x
I can hear the delta calling
From the light of a distant star
I can see my future
And I can feel my past
When Henry plays his steel guitar

But you can't make him think
You'll never miss your water baby

And you'll never miss me baby
Till I say good-bye
Mm hm you'd better heed my warning
The straw that broke the camel's back

Always laughs the best
And I'm gonna laugh louder baby
Than all the rest
Mm hm baby you'd better heed
You'd better heed my warning
If you want me to get out baby

When the cow is gone
But you're gonna miss me baby
On some frosty dawn
Mm hm you know you'd better heed
You'd better heed my warning
It's a long long road

You have to be an early bird
If you wanna catch a worm

If the grass look greener yonder
Baby that's where I'm gonna be
Mm hm baby you know you'd better heed
You'd better heed my warning

Hey hey hey
Don't bring no ghosts in the front hurry 'em round to the backdoor
This house is so haunted with dead men I can't lose
This house is so haunted with dead men I can't lose
And a sneaky old feeling gives me those haunted house blues
I can't sleep no more I done lost my appetite
I can't sleep no more done lost my appetite
'Cause my mistreating daddy hangs around me day and night
He moans when I'm sleeping he wakes me at am
He moans when I'm sleeping he wakes me at am
And he makes me swear I'll have no other man but him
Now I'm so worried and I'm blue all the time
Now I'm so worried and I'm blue all the time
Go tell the undertaker to fix that old coffin of mine
Lord help us to get right
I'm scared to stay here I'm scared to leave this town
I'm scared to stay here I'm scared to leave this town
But a feeling just tells me to burn this house on down
Tear this house on down
It's hard to be
It's hard for me to keep arm's length from my baby
Can't you see when I'm away from her it sho' nuff drives me crazy
Something inside of me when she's gone I miss her so
I wanna tell her how I feel just gotta let her know
When I'm alone with her and she's in my arms I'm in heaven
It's all I see in my dreams we'll be happy together
Side by side I hope that our love will stay this way forever
Something inside of me got a feelin' that won't let go
I wanna tell her how I feel I just gotta let her know
Lookin' through her eyes I see a paradise no mistake she's full of fire
Like a real live wire a house on fire
She's my burnin' she's my burnin' burnin' desire
Well it's hard to be it's hard for me to keep arm's length from my baby
Oh can't you see when I'm away from her it sho' nuff drives me crazy
Something inside of me when she's gone I miss her so
I wanna tell her how I feel I just gotta let her know
When I'm alone with her and she's in my arms I'm in heaven
Like a real live wire a house on fire
She's my burnin' she's my burnin' burnin' desire
Hard to be it's hard for me
It's hard to keep keep me from my baby
I never seen such a real hard times before
I never seen such a real hard times before
The wolf keeps walkin' all 'round my door
They howl all night and they moan till the break of day
They howl all night and they moan till the break of day
They seem to know my good man's gone away
I can't go outside to my grocery store
I can't go outside to my grocery store
I ain't got no money and my credit don't go no more
Won't somebody please try and find my man for me
Won't you please try and find my man for me
Tell him I'm broke and hungry lonely as I can be
If he didn't like my potatoes why did he dig so deep
If he didn't like my potatoes why did he dig so deep
In his mama's potato patch five and ten times a week
Baby lights her cigarette
And takes a look around
She says that morning sun
Sure does get her down
Nothing else to see
Just to help her lose
Those happy birthday blues
Grandpa takes a drink of wine
And tells it like it was
Tells me all he wants to do
Is what everybody does
Say he'd give the world
For a little girl
Just to help him lose
Those happy birthday blues
Happy birthday blues
Happy birthday blues
Got to pay your dues
Those happy birthday blues
In and out and on and on
Everybody goes
And where the fun with finally stops
Everybody knows
Girls it's me and you
Doing what we do
Just one way to lose
Those happy birthday blues
Hangman's rope sho' is tough and strong
Hangman's rope sho' is tough and strong
They gonna hang me because I did something wrong
I wanna tell you the gallis Lord's a fearful sight
I wanna tell you the gallis Lord's a fearful sight
Hang me in the mornin' and cut me down at night
Mean ole hangman is waitin' to tighten up that noose
Mean ole hangman is waitin' to tighten up that noose
Lord I'm so scared I'm trembling in my shoes
Jury heard my case and they said my hands was red
Jury heard my case and they said my hands was red
And judge he sentenced me be hanging till I'm dead
Crowd 'round the courthouse and the time is going fast
Crowd 'round the courthouse and the time is going fast
Soon a good-for-nothin' killer is gonna breath his last
Lord I'm almost dyin' gasping for my breath
Lord I'm almost dyin' gasping for my breath
And a triflin' woman waiting to celebrate my death
If your problems
Won't go away
And you're worried
Both night and day
Hand it over
Get on your knees and pray
If you're sick
Feeling low
Got no money
Got nowhere to go
Hand it over
Get on your knees and pray
Chorus:
Hand it over
Hand it over
Give it up give it over
Hand it over
Get on your knees and pray
Bridge:
Ain't no mountain
You cant climb
Ain't no answer
You can't find
All you need is a hand to hold
Ill heal your body
And feed your soul
If the road is dark
And you can`t find your way
Just let the spirit light the way
Hand it over
Get on your knees and pray
Chorus

Chorus
You know the gypsy woman told me that you your mother's bad-luck child
You know the gypsy woman told me that you your mother's bad-luck child
Well you're having a good time now but that'll be trouble after while
Well you know I went to a gypsy woman to have my fortune told
She say "You better go back home son and peep through your your key hole"
You know the gypsy woman told me that you your mother's bad-luck child
Well you're having a good time now but that'll be trouble after while
Well now you know I went back home I took the gypsy woman as she said

You know the gypsy woman told me that you your mother's bad-luck child
Well you're having a good time now but that'll be trouble after while
I've been blue all day my man's gone away
He has left his mama cold for another gal I'm told
I tried to treat him kind I thought he would be mine
That man I hate to lose that's why mama's got the blues
The man I love he has done left this town
The man I love he has done left this town
And if it keeps on snowing I will be Gulf Coast bound
The mail man passed but he didn't leave no news
The mail man passed but he didn't leave no news

Thank you so much ladies and gentlemen right here

This is about a country boy from down home
This young man has never been north before
I want you to listen to me I got something to tell you
He heard about Chicago
He worked hard over here made all of that money dollars
After caring for his crop he called his cousin in Chicago
and he said "Cousin I'm on my way"
He picked all of that cotton
I said this is about a country boy like myself BB King you know
So when he get to Chicago his cousin meet him and bring him out to the club
He said "Set him up" cous's payin' for
Had all the go-go girls set up waitin' up
They carried him downtown and put him up in one of the pleasure hotels
They brought him back out and said "Set him up" cous's payin' for
His money got a little lighter they lured him out from the Lute and brought him down to Robert's
And then he said "Set him up" cous's payin' for
And then the dollars bein' more money then my man had ever had began to run out
Then they moved him out and put him down with the
And then ladies and gentlemen the go-go girls would get fewer
His friends was fewer
All his buddies are startin' passin' him on the other side of the street
And then it happened all his buddies were gone
And my man knew only one thing to do it was getting cold there like it is today
you know what I'm talking about
He went down to the railroad yard
and one of the few ladies that had helped him to spent his money came by to see him
And she said "You fool you fool" I wouldn't have spend your money but the rest of them was spending your money so I decided to spend my portion too you know
But ladies God bless 'em wonderful something's aren't they
They always like to feel like they're needed and she knew my man needed her bad
He gotten sick he's layin' down there under the boxcar
Couldn't read so well so you know if he couldn't read so well he couldn't write too well
you know what I'm talkin' about
So this is a letter back down home I know what I'm talkin' about

Everything for you baby
Tried to give you everything

To play with baby
And I needed me someone to love
I say I'm tired of you
Putting me down

With troubles baby
Because I wake up
Thinking about you
I'm tired of you
Putting me down baby
I think I'm gonna do like a mole
And move underground
Oh I paid the cost baby

So baby go on

So baby go on
Go on go on go on baby go on

You wanna lose your happy home
Then baby go on

And the chances are slim
Since I walked around the corner
Saw you kissing on him
You said he's just a long lost friend
If you please
You'd better take him home now
So darling where's the keys
Go on got me on my knees
Go on do just what you please
You wanna lose your happy home
Then baby go on go on

When you call me to leave my my happy home
But someday you ain't gonna worry my life anymore
You told everybody in your neighborhood
what a dirty mistreater didn't mean you no good
But someday you ain't gonna worry my life anymore
When I had money I had plenty friends
I ain't got no money baby honey even no friends
But someday you ain't gonna worry my life anymore
If I had money like Henry Ford
I'd have me a woman on on every road
But bye bye you ain't gonna worry my life anymore
When you lose your money don't lose your mind
When you lose your money don't lose your mind
When you lose your good man please don't mess with mine
And I'm gonna buy me a bulldog to watch my man while he sleeps

Men are so doggone crooked afraid he might make a four day creep
Girls I'm gonna tell you this ain't gonna tell you nothin' else
Girls I'm gonna tell you this ain't gonna tell you nothin' else
Any woman's a fool who thinks she's got a whole man by herself
But if you got a good man and don't want him taken away from you
Girls if you got a good man and don't want him taken away from you
Don't ever tell your friend woman what your man can do
Lord Lord I'm getting up in years

But mama ain't too old to shift her gears
And I'm a big fat mama got the meat shakin' on my bones
I'm a big fat mama got the meat shakin' on my bones
And every time I shake some skinny gal loses her home
Tired of being alone
Waiting on you to phone baby
It's four in the morning and I'm cold
There ain't no one to hold me
I know that's it's real
I found someone new

But I can't give up this fight
'Cause I'm tired of being lonely
Think it's me that's been wrong

Forty days and forty nights
Since my baby left this town
Sunshinin' all day long
But the rain keep comin' down
She's my life I need her so
Why she left I just don't know
Forty days and forty nights
Since I set right down and cried
Keep rainin' all the time
But the river is runnin' dry
Lord help me it just ain't right
I love that girl with all-a my might
Forty days and forty nights
Since my baby broke my heart
Searchin' for her in a while
Like a blind man in the dark
Love can make a poor man rich
Or break his heart I don't know which
Forty days and forty nights
Like a ship out on the sea
Prayin' for her each night
That she would come back-a home to me
Life is love and love is right
I hope she come back home tonight
One two three four
For the love of a woman
A man will do most anything
For a love of a woman
A man will do most anything
Make him steal from his mother
Just to buy her a diamond ring

Men sure is deceitful and they's gettin' worser ev'ry day
Men sure is deceitful and they's gettin' worser ev'ry day
Act like a bunch of women they's just-a gab gab gabbin' away
There's two things got me puzzled there's two things I can't stand
There's two things got me puzzled there's two things I can't stand
A mannish actin' woman and a skippin' twistin' woman actin' man
I used to love a man he always made my poor heart ache
I used to love a man he always made my poor heart ache
He was crooked as a corkscrew and evil as a copperhead snake
Iknow a certain man who spent a year runnin' a poor gal down
Iknow a certain man who spent a year runnin' a poor gal down
And when she let him kiss her the fool blabbed it all over town
When I was a young man
Just gotten out
I didn't know
What this world was all about
I was lied to I was cheated
I played all kinds of fools
It didn't take me long
To learn the rules
Fool me once shame on you
Fool me twice shame on me
Fool me once shame on you
Fool me twice shame on me
Lady swore she loved me
Loved through and through
And then my pal said
She said she loved him too
And the milkman and the postman
And in a dream

Football team
Fool me once shame on you

Fool me once
Do me as bad as you can do
Shame on you

Fool me twice

Bought him a stake
The banker swore that one day

Banker's on a long trip
Out of town
Fool me once
Do me as bad as you can do
Shame on you
Shame on you
Fool me twice
I'll be as mad as I can be
Shame on me
Shame on me
Why do people believe in some old sign
Why do people believe in some old sign
To hear a hoot owl holler someone is surely dyin'
Some will break a mirror cry bad luck for seven years
Some will break a mirror cry bad luck for seven years
And if a black cat crosses them they'll break right down in tears
To dream of muddy water trouble is knockin' at your door
To dream of muddy water trouble is knockin' at your door
Your man is sure to leave you and never return no more
When your man come home evil tell you you are getting old
When your man come home evil tell you you are getting old
That's a true sign he's got someone else bakin' his jelly roll
Florine Lord you know I call her Flo

I told him folks don't have a clue
Where you're from or where you're goin' to
An' sometime baby gets so hard to deal
With folks that believe wrestlin' is real
An' we fightin' hard
If I could stroll 'cross the sands of time
I'd call my cronies up and drink some wine
'Cause all we got's just a little time
'Fore we all gotta say goodbye
An' I'm fightin' hard
An' I'm fightin' hard
I've got a real fine woman and she gives me everything
I've got a real fine woman and she gives me everything
It just makes me feel so good just to hear my baby call my name
My baby's sly way of loving makes me feel so good I could sing
My baby's sly way of loving makes me feel so good I wanna sing
Yes I feel just like a millionaire when I hear my baby call my name
Yes there ain't nobody like my baby that's the reason I love her so
Ain't nobody nobody nobody like my baby that's the reason I love her so
Yes I would even die for her and I want the whole world to know
Yes when I'm down she'll pick me up and tell me "Daddy you can't lose"
Yes when I'm down when I'm down when I'm down people my baby tell me I can't lose
Yes when all of my friends forget about me my baby keeps away these
blues
Still playin' this music now
I wanna show you way I feel
I feel bad 'cause I don't have a dollar bill
I need money Lord at least that's what I wish
One bird in the hand is better 'n two out in the bush
That' why I'm fed up
He's fed up
Gotta keep the bird right in my hand oh yeah
Well I'm gonna stop this runnin' around
An' get me a job like the average man um-hm
I'm gonna get me a job where I work from nine to five
I'm playin' this music an' I can't hardly survive
Money on a musician is the worst musician I ever seen
I was better off when I was workin' for Walgreen
That's why I'm fed up
He's fed up
Wanna keep a dollar right in my hand oh yeah
Well I'm gonna stop this runnin' around
Get me a job like the average man um-hm
Should be a star 'cause I always want to be
I hate guitars 'cause they just won't profit to me
I'm playin' my saxophone an' I'm walkin' the streets an' cryin'
Gotta get me a job 'cause I don't have a lousy dime
Now I hate this music 'cause it always leave me flat
Thirty dollar job and you got your agent tryin' a-steal that
People keep on tellin' me blues don't get satisfaction
One hit record then I'll be a star like Michael Jackson
That's why I'm fed up
He's fed up
Gonna keep a dollar right in my hand oh yeah
Well I'm gonna stop this runnin' around
And get me a job like the average man
Lord I'm gonna stop this runnin' around
An' get me a job like the average man
Well I'm gonna stop this runnin' around
An' get me a job like the average man
Yes your talkin' about your woman

Her daddy must have been a millionaire
I can tell by the way she walks
My baby's daddy must have been a millionaire
I can tell by the way she walks
When she start walkin'

I remember one Friday morning

And said ain't she pretty
the world know she's fine
She start lovin'
she brings eyesight to the blind

Run around to the back you'll catch him just before he go

My room was empty and my woman was gone
My room was empty and my woman was gone
I didn't have a nickel and all my clothes in pawn
I asked my next door neighbor which-a-way did my baby go
Asked my next door neighbor which-a-way did my baby go
She says she left for the border down in old Mexico
I found a note on the floor it almost sent me off in a trance
I found a note on the floor it almost sent me off in a trance
She said it's nothin' that you done I'm just leavin' in advance
Yes yes yes
It's so hard when a woman leave you and she leave you on a zoom
It's so hard when a woman leave you and leave you on a zoom
You come home feelin' very happy and find only a empty room
I woke up this morning with a awful aching head
I woke up this morning with a awful aching head
My new man had left me just a room and a empty bed
Bought me a coffee grinder
that's the best one I could find
Bought me a coffee grinder that's the best one I could find
Oh he could grind my coffee 'cause he had a brand new grind
He's a deep sea diver with a stroke that can't go wrong
He's a deep sea diver with a stroke that can't go wrong
He can stay at the bottom and his wind holds out so long
He knows how to thrill me and he thrills me night and day
Oh he knows how to thrill me he thrills me night and day
He's got a new way of loving almost takes my breath away
Lord he's got that sweet somethin' and I told my girlfriend Lou
He's got that sweet somethin' and I told my girlfriend Lou
From the way she's raving she must have gone and tried it too
Part
When my bed get empty make me feel awful mean and blue
When my bed get empty make me feel awful mean and blue
My springs are getting rusty sleeping single like I do
Bought him a blanket pillow for his head at night
Bought him a blanket pillow for his head at night
Then I bought him a mattress so he could lay just right
He came home one evening with his spirit way up high
He came home one evening with his spirit way up high
What he had to give me make me wring my hands and cry
He give me a lesson that I never had before
He give me a lesson that I never had before
When he got to teachin' me from my elbow down was sore
He boiled my first cabbage and he made it awful hot
He boiled my first cabbage and he made it awful hot
When he put in the bacon it overflowed the pot
When you git good lovin' never go and spread the news
Yes he'll double-cross you and leave you with them empty bed blues
Your gonna miss me little darlin' the day that I'm gone
Your gonna miss me little baby the day that I'm gone
Cause I'm leavin' in the mornin' won't be back at all
You have run me ragged baby your own fault your on your own
You have run me ragged baby your own fault your on your own
You didn't want me no way baby 'till that other man was gone
You can try to get me back baby with all your tricks and charms
You can try to get me back baby with all your tricks and charms
But when all your games are over you'll be left with empty arms
Low down and dead and all alone
Elevate me mama mama five or six floors all down
Elevate me mama mama five or six floors all down
Ah you know everybody tell me you must be the elevatin' woman in town
Well you know when you start to elevate me

Elevate me mama mama five or six floors all down

Elevate me mama mama five or six floors on down
Well you know everybody tells me you must be the elevatin' woman in
town
The pages of my history
Ain't no great big mystery
For the price of petty bribes
Separation of the tribes
Men with guns have leadeth us
Down their path of righteousness
A thousand trips around the sun
Hard to tell who lost and won
Who lost
The faces in the mist I see
Ain't no great big mystery
Loss of heart loss of mind
Lost some chrome through tests of time
Through tests of time

But right now I'm drowning
Drowning in the sea of love
I've been out here so very long

Baby when you came my way
Thought I had found my protection
But a strong wind came into my life
It surely took me by surprise
I can't seem to control these tears
That's falling from my eyes

And I've been down two times
But right now I'm drowning
Drowning in the sea of love
Sea of love
Baby I depended on you
For the love navigation
But now you've gone and deserted me
Can't you see that I'm in desperation
I'm in the middle of a bad love storm
And it's bad as it can be
I look around all I can see
Is water coming down over me
I've been down one time
And I've been down two times
But right now I'm drowning
Drowning in the sea of love
Sea of love sea of love
I've been down one time
And I've been down two times
But right now I'm drowning
Drowning in the sea of love
Sea of love
But right now I'm just drowning
Drowning in the sea of love
A sea of love sea of love

Ever since the day we met
Baby I've been down hearted
Ever since the day we met
I've been loving nothing but the blues
Baby how blue can you get
My love burned like a fire
Your love burned like a cigarette
Yes my love burned like a fire
Your love burned like a cigarette
Yes I've seen you put it down and crush it
Baby how blue can you get
Oh you're evil when I'm with you baby
And you're jealous when we're apart
Yes you're evil when I'm with you baby
And you're jealous when we're apart
How blue can you get baby
The answer's right here in my heart
I gave you a brand new Ford
But you said "I want a Cadillac"
I bought you a ten dollar dinner
and you said "Thanks for the snack"
I let you live in my penthouse
You said it just a shack
I gave seven children
And now you wanna give them back
I said "I've been down hearted baby
ever since the day we met"
I've been loving nothing but the blues
Tell me how blue can you get
Gee but it's hard to love someone when that someone don't love you
I'm so disgusted heartbroken too
I've got those down hearted blues
Once I was crazy 'bout a man
He mistreated me all the time
The next man I get he's got to promise to be mine all mine
If I could only find the man oh how happy I would be
To the good Lord ev'ry night I pray
Please send my man back to me
I've almost worried myself to death wond'ring why he went away
But just wait and see he's gonna want me back some sweet day
Trouble trouble I've had it all my days
Trouble trouble I've had it all my days
It seems that trouble's going to follow me to my grave
Got the world in a jug the stopper's in my hand
Got the world in a jug
The stopper's in my hand
Going to hold it baby till you come under my command
Say I ain't never loved but three men in my life
No I ain't never loved but three men in my life
'T'was my father brother and the man who wrecked my life
'Cause he mistreated me and he drove me from his door
Yeah he mistreated me and he drove me from his door
But the good book says you'll reap just what you sow
Oh it may be a week and it may be a month or two
Yes it may be a week and it may be a month or two
But the day you quit me honey it's coming home to you
Oh I walked the floor and I wrung my hands and cried

Sadie Brown and Linda Lee
Were as good a pair as could be
Till Sadie tried a brand new man
Start telling 'bout his good quality
How he could love pet and tease
How the things he did would please
One night her good man give her the air
Sadie cried out loud right then and there
Don't never tell nobody what your perfect good man can do
You just get them anxious to try some of his good points too
If he's nice and sweet and hard to beat
Don't tell your bestest friend
They'll never rest without a test
You know that there is always better than best
He may really try to be good and true
But if you want to keep him it is up to you
Do never tell nobody what your perfect good man can do
You've been runnin' in the streets again but I'd never had a hand on you
I've been a better man this year than all the men that you've been through
Don't mistake kindness for weakness 'cause a little girl only a fool would stay with you
I tried so hard to please you babe I've even turned your lies to truth
I said I tried so hard to please you baby I turned your lies to truth
But when you said were my baby I think I got to ask you for more proof
Don't mistake kindness for weakness 'cause your chicken has come to roost
I said don't mistake kindness for weakness baby your chicken done come to roost
I think another man would be a fool to try to hang around with you
I'm all done Mister Nice Guy but I ain't playin' around with your rules
If you think that's liquor talkin' you better try an' get on back to school
So mistake kindness for weakness woman you done used up your your
last fool
My pockets are empty I feel so low
If somebody loves me ain't said so
And I got holes in both of my shoes
Don't look now but I've got the blues
There ain't nobody on this old earth
Who'll give a nickel for what I'm worth
I got more worries that I can use
Don't look now but I've got the blues
Troubles everywhere I act like I don't care
But it's not true
'Cause I remember things so many many things
But mostly I remember you
I'm gonna go some place else
And cry these tears all by myself
I ain't got nothing left to lose
Don't look now but I've got the blues
Hear that whistle it's ten o'clock
Don't let go don't let go
C'mon baby it's time to rock
Don't let go don't let go
I'm so happy I got you here
Don't let go don't let go
Keeps me grinnin' from ear to ear
Don't let go don't let go
Ooo-wee um-um this feelin's killin' me
Aw shucks
I wouldn't stop for a million bucks
I love you so
Just hold me tight an don't let go
Thunder an' lightnin' wind an rain
Don't let go don't let go
Love is storming inside my brain
Don't let go don't let go
I'm so eager I'm nearly dying
Don't let go don't let go
You've been keepin' your lips from mine
Don't let go don't let go
Ooo-wee um-um this feelin's killin' me
Aw shucks
I wouldn't stop for a million bucks
I love you so
Just hold me tight an' don't let go
Hound dog barkin' upside the hill
Don't let go don't let go
Love is draggin' him through the mill
Don't let go don't let go
If it wasn't for havin' you
Don't let go don't let go
I'd be barkin' an howling too
Don't let go don't let go
Ooo-wee um-um this feelin's killin' me
Aw shucks ha
I wouldn't stop for a million bucks
I love you so
Just hold me tight an don't let go
One day baby you'll quit me yet
Don't let go don't let go
An' I'll be cryin' soakin' wet
Don't let go don't let go
One thing babe I'll never stand
Don't let go don't let go
Your lips kissin' some other man

Just hold me tight an don't let go
A hold me tight an don't let go

Fading:

If one thing in this world
I just can't stand
Is bein' at the table wit' an ill-mannered man
Now if he's sittin' on your left
Before you could eat a bite
He'll reach across your plate
An' you know that ain't right
Now I like to eat as well as any man
But there's some rules a fool should understand
When ya have one little helpin'
An' one extra piece of cake
I tell ev'rybody don't go reachin' across my plate
I was at a party last night at over Big Murray
Cat reached 'cross my plate
Got a coat sleeve in my gravy
I didn't say a word just looked him dead in the eye
He reached across my plate an' cut him a piece a pie
Now I don't care if he did it for a prank
I don't care if you had a drink
Especially when I'm out a-with my date
Now don't you go reachin' across MY plate
At a party last week there was some high-class folks
Ev'rything on the table an' that ain't no joke
They had barbecue possum rattlesnake gravy
Chicken fried skunk an' it smelt real crazy
Ev'rything went fine but one thing made me blue
A cat reached across my plate for some armadillo
stew
Now when you at the table you act real nice
You say "pass me that" or "pass me the platter"
But just because you hungry an' happen to come in late
Don't you go reachin' across MY plate
Spoken:
"Pass some a-that turkey over there baby"
"No don't give me none of that skunk I don't want none a-that"
"I I beg your pardon"
"If this cat stop reachin' 'cross my plate I can maybe ask for somethin'"
"A pass me a little a-that turkey there baby"
Fading:
Na na na na-na-na-na
Yeah-heya
"Party' nice party's nice"
"Yeah ah give gimme some a that chicken over there baby"
"Chicken fried skunk "ah no"

Missed the Saturday dance
heard they crowded the floor
It's awfully different without you
don't get around much anymore
Thought I visit the club
got as far as the door
I just couldn't bear without you
I don't get around much anymore
Darling I guess my mind is more at ease
but nevertheless why stir up memories
Been invited on a date
I might have gone but what for
I just couldn't bear it without you
I don't get around much anymore
Don't get around much anymore
My daddy come home this mornin' drunk as he could be
My daddy come home this mornin' drunk as he could be
I know that he's done got bad on me
He used to stay out late now he don't come home at all
He used to stay out late now he don't come home at all
I know there's another mule been kicking in my stable
If you don't like my ocean don't fish in my sea
If you don't like my ocean don't fish in my sea
Stay out of my valley let my mountain be
I ain't had no loving since God knows when
I ain't had no loving since God knows when
That's the reason I'm through with these no-good trifling men
You'll never miss the sunshine till the rain begin to fall
You'll never miss the sunshine till the rain begin to fall
You'll never miss your ham till another mule be in your stall
Girl you're my sunshine
You chase away the raindrops
Make it all worthwhile
Make all the pain stop
Just like a river you keep love flowing
Don't let our world stop keep it growing
Oh I like you just the way you are
Honey don't change on me
Don't change on me
Please don't change on me
Girl you're my lucky star
Don't change on me
Don't change on me
Please don't ever change
I used to wonder where would I find
Some kind of happiness and peace of mind
I was living in darkness
Oh but then you came
Bringing in the sunlight
And easing my pain
Oh I like you just the way you are
Honey don't change on me
Don't change on me
Please don't change on me
Girl you're my lucky star
Don't change on me
Don't change on me
Please don't ever change
If there's a heaven
Then this is my prayer
Lord knows I want to know you
If we ever should meet there
And then forever we'll walk together
Nothing but sunshine
And no more stormy weather
Oh I like you just the way you are
Honey don't change on me
Don't change on me
Please don't change on me
Girl you're my lucky star
Don't change on me
Don't change on me
Please don't ever change
Spoken:
Now this tune is all about a girl that's got a good man
But she gonna leave him to another for another slick talkin' dude
But I advised her not to burn down the bridge
She might wanna come back
One two three four
Your mind's set on leavin'
To a house down a one way street
Say you're gonna lock up all the doors
And throw away the key
Oh but don't burn down the bridge darlin'
You just might wanna come back
'Cause the grass ain't no greener
On the other side of the track
Oh you counted me out before I could get to bat
All the things are out-ta the Chevrolet
Tomorrow night be drivin' a Cadillac
But don't burn down the bridge darlin'
You just might wanna come back
'Cause the grass ain't no greener
On the other side of the track
Hey
All your so called friends
Taught you how to cheat an' lie
Now it seem like you gonna jump
From the fryin' pan to the fire
Oh but don't burn down your bridge darlin'
You just might wanna come back
'Cause the grass ain't no greener
On the other side of the track
Hey Ha

Did you ever love a woman
And you loved her with all your might
Did you ever love a woman
And you loved her with all your might
Well and you knew all the time
That the woman wasn't treating you right
You fix her breakfast in the morning
Stay at home everyday
Even wash the dishes
If she has to go away
You send the children to school
Even mend their hose
Stay up all nights with the babies
Even wash their dirty clothes
Did you ever love a woman
And you loved her with all your might
Yes and you knew all the time
That the woman wasn't treating you right
But when it's time to go to bed
The woman grabs you in her arms
She holds you real tight
She hugs you with all her charms
She calls you a lot of sweet names
Then she turns out the light
She sets your soul on fire
And you say "Baby everything is all right"
Did you ever love a woman
And you loved her with all your might
Yes and you knew all the time
That the woman wasn't treating you right
She got to take sick and die one of these days
She got to take sick and die oh one of these days

She got to take sick and die one of these days
When she's dead I'm gonna bury her very deep
When she's dead I'm gonna bury her very deep
I'm gonna bury her very deep rubies and diamonds round her feet
She got to take sick and die one of these days
I got to take sick and die one of these days

All the medicine she can buy and all the doctors she can hire
She got to take sick and die one of these days
She got to take sick and die one of these days
She got to take sick and die one of these days
All the medicine she can buy and all the doctors she can hire
She got to take sick and die one of these days

She looked at me like she could kill me when I said that we were through

Happy now that we are free
This is how it ought to be
We are on our own
Go underwater and see another world of green
Fishes go by and I get to wondering where they#;ve been
Sunny day
We can play
Lazing by the deep blue sea
Happy now that we are free
This is how it ought to be
We are on our own
Take out a boat and paddle it around the bay
Pressures from the world seem to fade away
Sunny day
We can play
Sailing on the deep blue sea
Happy now that we are free
This is how it ought to be
We are on our own

His eyes was set and his face was full of frowns

He wasn't dead but he was slowly dyin'
And to think of him I just can't help from cryin'
I followed my daddy to the buryin' ground

Way back yonder in the days of old
The men was workin' but not savin' any dough
Then came a woman lookin' real cool
She said to herself "Now that's my fool"
I'm gonna ball tonight
I'm gonna ball tonight
Well you can't break the rule because every man is some woman's fool
Met a girl on the avenue
She was shy and I was blue
Like a teacher and a student in the school
Looked at me and said "You're my fool"
Gonna ball tonight
We're gonna ball tonight
Man I can't break a rule cause every man is some woman's fool
Way back yonder in the days of old
The men was workin' but not savin' any dough
Then came a woman lookin' real cool
She said to herself "Now that's my fool"
I'm gonna ball tonight
I'm gonna ball tonight
Well you can't break the rule because every man is some woman's fool
I'm gonna ball tonight
We're gonna ball tonight
We're gonna ball tonight
We're gonna ball tonight
Well I can't break the rule because every man is some woman's
fool
Way back yonder in the days of old
The men was workin' but not savin' any dough
Then came a woman lookin' real cool
She said to herself "Now that's my fool"
I'm gonna ball tonight
I'm gonna ball tonight
Well I can't break the rule
'Cause every man is some woman's fool
I met a girl on the avenue
She was shy and I was blue
Like a teacher and a student in the school
She looked at me and said "You're my fool"
Way back yonder in the days of old
The men was workin' but not savin' any dough
Then came a woman lookin' real cool

Oh darling what happened to that beautiful smile
The ones you gave me any time we were face to face
Oh is it someone else taking my place
Oh baby what happened
Oh what happened to those fast heartbeats
The ones that excited me so
Oh tell me don't you love me
Oh baby don't you care any more
Darling what happened
Oh it's so sad what a little time can do
Oh when you're hanging out with another
Losing a love with you
All those good times we had
Baby just me and you
Oh darling before I go
There's one thing I'd like to know
Don't you love me
Don't you care any more
Darling what happened
Darlin' darlin' you know I love you
I love you for myself
But you're gone gone and left me for someone else
I think of you think of you every morning
I dream of you every night and with love
love to be with you always
When night began to fall
I cry cry alone
And I wish maybe I can hold you in my arms tonight
Oh darlin' darlin' you know I love you
I love you for myself
But you're gone gone and left me for someone else
Look at the man with the smile on his face Looks like he#;s always feelin#; good Sometimes you might want to take his place and sometimes I think that you would
When the sun is goin#; down and there is no place to hide Even in the brightest light you might lean toward the darker side
Look at the people they learn how to lie so easy They learn how to lie to get what they need and after they got what they needed It turns into a simple case of greed
When they no longer feel ashamed and they#;ve lost all sense of pride Misery loves company and it#;s lonely on the darker side
And when the party is over and the music has died You#;ll be dancin#; to the music baby somewhere on the darker side
Somewhere on the darker side
Part :
Blues has got me there is teardrops in my eyes
Yes the blues has got me there is teardrops in my eyes
Well dark is the night since my baby said goodbye
Oh how I've suffered since my baby went away
Yes how I've suffered since my baby went away
And I've got that feeling that my baby's gone to stay
Take me back baby forgive me for the wrong I've done
Yes take me back darling forgive me for the wrong I've done
Well I know I love you and you're the only one
Yes talk to me baby call me on the telephone
Yeah talk to me baby call me on the telephone
Yes the blues has got me and I want my baby home
Yes if your baby love you keep her home and treat her nice
Oh if your baby love you you better keep her home and treat her nice
Well never mistreat a good woman this is some doggone good advice
Part :
Yes it's been so long since I've seen my baby's face
Well it's been so long since I've seen my baby's face

When I hit my woman down
It was a bad bad evil night
When I realized what I#;d done
It was way too late too late
Too late for words and I#;m crying
In torment sometimes
We hurt each other so bad
Nobody to turn to no going back
No such thing as God for us
No more to touch her body
No more to stroke her hair
All I can do is break down in tears
I#;m crying and wondering
Where am I now because of what I did
I just don#;t know and I#;m crying
It was a long time ago
The pain is over now
But I still think back sometimes
And remember how I cried

And your crying won't help you woman
Oh crying won't help you baby

I'm just a little country boy
Lookin' for my pride and joy
I came to the city just to see what I could see
I just made it in your town
Thought I'd take a look around
I wanna tell you baby
Just how good you look to me
My mama told me there will be sometime like this
She told me there would be some moments here will flip
She warned me of a lot of things I had to do
But she didn't tell me I would meet somebody like you
Somebody take a chance with me
I want you to romance with me
You might say I'm coy

Memphis Ramport
Beale Street set 'em free
Graveyard 'Bama Bound Lord Lord come from stingaree
Lord sittin' on the Southern gonna ride all night long
Lord sittin' on the Southern
gonna ride all night long
Downhearted Gulf Coast - they was all good songs
Lord 'rested at midnight Jailhouse made me loose my mind
Lord 'rested at midnight Jailhouse made me loose my mind
Bad Luck 'n' Boll-Weevil made me think of old Moonshine
Lord goin' to sleep now for Mama just got bad news
Lord goin' to sleep now for Mama just got bad news
To try to dream away my troubles countin' these blues
Runnin' through this business of life
rarely time if I'm needed to
Ain't so funny when things ain't feelin' right
then daddy's hand helps to see me through
Sweet as sugar love won't wash away
rain or shine it always here to stay
All these years you and I've spent together
all this we just couldn't stand the weather
Like a train that stops at every station
we all deal with trials and tribulations
Fear hangs the fellow that ties up his years
entangled in yellow and cries all his tears
Changes come before we can grow
learn to see them before we're too old
Don't just take me for tryin' to be heavy
understand it's time to get ready for the storm
Corrina Corrina where ya been so long
Tell me Corrina where ya been so long
I haven't had no lovin' since you been gone
I love Corrina I tell the world I do
Well I love Corrina I tell the world I do
Well I hope some day she will come to love me too
Corrina Corrina where you stay last night
Tell me Corrina where you stayed last night
You came home this mornin' the sun was shinin' bright
I met Corrina a-way across the sea
Yeah I met Corrina way across the sea
She wouldn't write me no letter she didn#;t care for me
Bye-bye Corrina I got to leave ya now
Bye-bye Corrina I got to leave ya now
Well I know you didn#;t mean it no good no how
#;Instrumental amp; guitar background during conversation#;

Three o'clock come still no wife
Four o'clock sure was mad now

Kissin' me all on the neck an' goin' on
Felt good but I'm still mad
Now after she done all that sweet talk
You know what I told her fellas

You don't know what I told her
An' I fool around an' made her mad you know what would happen
You know what she told me fellas

#;Let's ride this thing outta trouble#; yeah
Well this woman is puttin' me out
How 'bout that
Yeah here I stand before you with my heart in my hand
I want you to great it baby hopin' that you'll understand
I said baby honey please don't dog me around
Because I'd rather love you woman honey than anyone else I know in town
Because you're so nice and lovely and you have such pleasant ways
If you take to your heart I'll be there the rest of my days
I said baby that's the truth
Honey I declare I wouldn't lie
Because I gotta love you baby
If I don't I swear I hope I die
Oh baby don't you want a man like me
Can you hear me woman don't you want a man like me
You gotta think you gotta think about our future baby
And you forget about your used to be
Well my days are long and dreary
and the sun refuse to shine
I will never be blue and lonely
only if I knew where you are
I got the blues baby
You can make everything alright
Can I see you today baby
Or will it have to be tomorrow night
Yes this is still my confession baby
And I'm thrilled by all your charms
It seems that I'm in heaven when I hold you in my arms
Baby woman you can have me for yourself
You know I was meant for you baby
And I don't want nobody else no I don't
Hey you told me that you love me woman you meant it from the start
You said that we would be together until death do us part
But you lied to me baby yes and you called it on the phone
Now how can I be happy woman with all the wrong you done
When you know just where I stand
I don't wanna lose you woman wanna keep you if I can
But baby baby you know I never had a friend
You're my one and only woman you're all I have that stays
Now let me come in here
I'm gonna love you
Like nobody's loved you
Come rain or come shine
High as a mountain and deep as a river
Come rain or come shine
Well I guess when you met me
That it were just one of those things
Don't you ever bet me
'Cause I'm gonna be true if you let me
Oh you're gonna love me
Like nobody's loved me
Come rain or come shine
Happy together unhappy together
Won't that be fine
Day may be cloudy or sunny
We're either in or we're out of our money
I'm with you always
I'm with you rain or shine
You're gonna love me
Like nobody's loved me
Come rain or come shine
Happy together unhappy together
Won't that be fine
Day may be cloudy or sunny
We're in or we're out of our money
I'm with you always
I'm with you rain or shine
Rain or shine
I'm with you always
I'm with you rain or shine
People talkin' but they just don't know
what's in my heart and why I love you so
I love you baby like a miner loves gold
come on baby let the good times roll
Let the good times roll
come on it soothes my soul
Oh let the good times roll
come on come on come on
A lot of people live in make believe
they keep a lot of dirt up their sleeve
My love baby ain't the kind to fold
come on baby let the good times roll
Let the good times roll
come on an' let it roll
Ah yeah let it roll come on let it roll
Our lovin's nice if it's understood
it's even nicer when you feel so good
You got me flippin' like a flag on a pole
come on sugar let the good times roll
Oh let the good times roll
come on let it roll come on come on
Come on come on come on and let it roll

Oh how the wind do howl

But she better come on in my kitchen 'cause it's goin' to be rainin' outdoors

Once was a sweet thing baby held out her lovin' in our hands
Now I reach to kiss your lips the touch don't mean a thing
And that's a cold shot baby yeah that's a drag
A cold shot baby I let our love go bad
Remember the way that you loved me do anything I said
Now I see you out somewhere you won't give me the time of day
And that's a cold shot darlin' yeah that's a drag
And that's a cold shot baby we let our love go bad
I really meant I was sorry for ever causin' you pain
You showed your appreciation by walkin' out anyway
And that's a cold shot baby yeah that's a drag
And that's a cold shot baby we let our love go bad
So sad too bad so sad
Don't let our true love run cold baby
Cold chills my baby makes cold chills go all over me
Cold chills cold chills goes all over me
Ev'rytime I lay my hand on her brown body cold chills goes all over me
Baby I say please don't run around baby please don't stay out all night long
Baby please don't run around baby please don't stay out all night long
When you come home drunk and you know that's what you've done
My baby went out last night my baby got drunk
That's one thing God knows I just can't stand
She makes cold chills she make cold chills go out all over me
Ev'rytime you go out and get drunk it makes cold chills go all over me
I got drunk last night baby I got drunk to keep from cryin'
Lord I got drunk last night baby I got drunk to keep from cryin'
You didn't come home last night baby and that lasted four days
Daddy oh daddy won't you answer me please
Daddy oh daddy won't you answer me please
All day I stood by your coffin tryin' to give my poor heart ease
I run my hands over your head and whispered in your
ear
I run my hands over your head and whispered in your
ear
And I wonder if you know that your mama is near
You told me that you love me and I believe what you said
You told me that you love me and I believe what you said
And I wish that I could fall here across your coffin dead
When I left the undertaker I couldn't help but cry
When I left the undertaker I couldn't help but cry
And it hurt me so bad to tell the man I love goodbye
Early one morning while makin' the rounds
I took a shot of cocaine and I shot my baby down
I shot her down then I went to bed
I stuck that lovin' forty-four beneath my head
Woke up next morning and I grabbed that gun
I took a shot of cocaine and away I run
Made a good run but I run too slow
they overtook me down in Juarez Mexico
In the hot joint takin' the pill
there walked the sheriff from Jericho Hill
Willy Lee your name is not Jack Brown
you're the dirty hack that shot your woman down
Yes so my name's is Billy Lee
if you've got a warrant you better read it to me
I shot her down 'cause she made me sore
I thought I was her daddy but she had five more
When I was arrested I was dressed in black
they threw me on a freight train and hauled me back
Had no friend who'd go my bail
they stuck my dried-up carcass in the county jail
Early next morning 'round half past nine
I saw the sheriff comin' down the line
That sheriff yelled as he cleared his throat
said come on you dirty hackin' to the district court
Into the courtroom my trial began
where I was judged by twelve honest men
Yes as the jury started walkin' out
I saw that little judge commence to look about
In about five minutes then walked a man
holding the verdict in his right hand
The verdict read in the first degree
I shouted Lordy Lordy please have mercy on me
The judge he smiled when he picked up his pen
ninety-nine years in the San Quentin Penn
Ninety-nine years underneath that ground
but I can't forget that day I shot that bad bitch down
Come on you hotheads you listen to me
stay off that whiskey and let that cocaine be
I want to be close to you baby as I can get
Close to you baby as water is wet
Close to you baby as a hair on your head
Close to you babe you better believe what I said
I want to be close to you baby
yeah let me be close to you
I want to be close to you darlin'
'til you don't know what to say or do
I want to be close to you baby as white is to rice
Close to you baby as cold is to ice
Close to you baby as a fire is to smoke
Close to you baby as a pig is to pork
I want to be close to you baby
who let me be close to you
I want to be close to you darlin'
'til you don't know what to say or do
I said closer and closer baby
Closer and closer baby haha
Closer and closer baby
Closer and closer baby
I want to be close to you darlin'
'til you don't know what to say or do
I want to be close to you baby as the whites of your eyes
Close to you baby as cold is to ice
Close to you baby as an egg is to a hen
Close to you baby as Siamese twins
I want to be close to you baby
whoa let me be close to you
I want to be close to you darlin'
'til you don't know what to say or do
In my home of sand outside the city of gold
Well the wind's so burning hot but my heart remains so cold
I need to buy myself some answers but the truth's already been sold
Well I know how to use a razor carve my initials in the light
Yes I know how to use a razor carve my initials in the light
Sometimes in the depth of the dark baby I can make everything all right
In my home of sand outside the city of gold
Well the wind's so burning hot but my heart remains so cold yes it does
The shelter in your eyes I dream about it when I die
Thirst for it when I cry yeah
My home of sand outside the city of gold
Well the wind's so burning hot but my heart remains so cold it does
The shelter in your eyes I dream about it when I die
Thirst for it when I cry
Yeah na na
Oh my meal of salt on that table of stone
And my meal of salt on that table of stone yeah
Your feat's so sweet while I thirst here all alone
My home of sand outside the city of gold
Well the wind's so burning hot but my heart remains so cold yes it does
I need to buy myself some aspirin
but the truth's already been sold
People I thought I heard I thought I heard heard them church bell tone
Well I thought I heard I heard thought I heard this mornin' thought I heard the church bell tone
It might be tonin' for my baby my baby she been mighty low
Way down way down in shady land way down way down way down in shady land
There's two great white horses they gonna drive my baby away
Well two two great white horses comin' to drive my baby to the buryin' ground
Hmmm gonna take her down to a buryin' ground
I hate to see the two great white horses comin'
That ol' hearse gonna back up to the door
I know I heard I know I heard I know I heard a church bell tone this mornin'
Hmm I know I heard heard the church bell tone
I said "Bye bye baby bye bye baby I know we'll never meet again
Hmmm we'll never meet no more; goodbye baby goodbye
darlin'"
Headin' for the station with a pack on my back
I'm tired of transportation in the back of my hack
I love to hear the rhythm of the clickety clack
And hear the lonesome whistle see the smoke from the stack to pal around
With democratic fellow named Mac
So take me right back to the track Jack
Choo-choo choo-choo ch'boogie woo-woo
Woo-woo ch'boogie choo-choo choo-choo ch'boogie
Take me right back to the track Jack
You reach your destination but you don't go back
You need some compensation to get back in the black
You take a morning paper from the top of the stack
And read the situations from the front to the back
But the only job that's open needs a man with a knack
So put it right back in the rack Jack
Choo-choo choo-choo ch'boogie woo-woo
Woo-woo ch'boogie choo-choo choo-choo ch'boogie
Take me right back to the track Jack
Gonna settle down by the railroad track
Live the life O'Riley in the beat down shack
When I hear a whistle I can peep thru the crack
Watch the train rollin' when it's ballin' the jack
Love to hear the rhythm of the clickety clack
So take me right back to the track Jack
Choo-choo choo-choo ch'boogie woo-woo
Woo-woo ch'boogie choo-choo choo-choo ch'boogie
Take me right back to the track Jack
Take me right back to the track Jack
I'm goin' to Chicago sorry but I can't take you
Yes I'm goin' to Chicago sorry but I can't take you
'Cause there's nothin' on State Street that a monkey man can do
I've got a monkey man here a monkey man over there
I've got a monkey man here a monkey man over there
If monkey men were money I'd be a Chicago millionaire
I've got fourteen men now I only want one more
I've got fourteen men now and I only want one more
As soon as I can get one I'll let these fourteen go
Now I'm goin' tell you like the day goes so must you
Now I'm goin' tell you like the day goes so must you
When you nobody no money mama can no usin' you
I can take my monkey men and stand them all in line
I can take my monkey men and stand them all in line
Anybody can count them one two three four five six seven
eight times
Late last night I sold away and cried
Late last night I sold away and cried
Had the blues for Chicago I just can't be satisfied
Blues on my brain my tongue refused to talk
Blues on my brain my tongue refused to talk
I was followin' my daddy but my feet refuses to walk
Mean old fireman cruel old engineer
Lord mean old fireman cruel old engineer
You took my man and left his mama standing here
Big red headline tomorrow Defender
news
Big red headline tomorrow Defender news
"Woman dead down home these old Chicago blues"
I said blues
Watching you baby watching you all the time Watching you watching you all the time Watching you destroy yourself all you do is sit around drinking wine
You worry me baby I'm sitting here wondering wondering what in the world can I do You're worrying me you're worrying me baby Sitting here wondering what in the world can I do We've got so much to live for baby But I can't do nothing but sit here and watch that wine destroy you
That's wrong baby
I'm taking you to the doctor darling
Maybe the doctor knows what's going on in your head
Maybe the doctor can help me baby
Maybe he knows what's going on in your head
You see you're gonna keep on drinking that bad wine baby
Even the glass that grows on your grave will be cherry red
Come here pretty papa sit down on your mama's knee
Come here pretty papa sit down on your mama's knee
I don't want to tell you how you have mistreated me
You leave me after supper and you don't come home till morn'
You leave me after supper and you don't come home till morn'
You'll come home some morning and find your cherry tree gone
You can't slip back to your brownskin I mean your used-to-be
You can't slip back to your brownskin I mean your used-to-be
I know you're crazy 'bout your cherry pie but you can't two-time me
I've got my trunk all packed and I'm going to leave this town
I've got my trunk all packed and I'm going to leave this town
Goodbye little papa another man has cut your cherry tree down
I got a friend at the bar his name is Ray And I really don't know what he's trying to say
His skin is black mine is white To me there's no difference wrong or right
Told me he leave the girl at the curb Told me never to speak an unkind word My brother's got rhythm I got the blues but Babe we love to live the life that we choose
But now I know what they was trying to say I gotta change my life change my ways
Now I know what they were trying to say I gotta change my life change my ways
Now when the night comes babe you know I'll be found I'll be playing the blues on every stage in town
And there's a song to be played
and there's a song to be sung
'Cause there's a little lovin' boy
in everyone
Hey I went 'cross town to see my woman
I knocked upon her door
She said "Baby I'm glad ya stopped by

Honey you've been replaced

I leave home in the morning don't come back 'til the break of dawn
My baby said that ain't right I'll admit that is true
My baby said that ain't right I'll admit that is true
She said daddy daddy you got to change the way you do
You know I leave in the mornin' and I don't come back 'til dawn
You know I leaves in the mornin' and I don't come back 'til dawn
My baby looked me in the eyes and said daddy you got to change your
evil way
Hey hey mama that ride has come and gone
I say hey hey mama that ride has come and gone
I just can't see what in the world is you waiting on
I've done met a mama she ain't long in or tall
I say I got another mama she ain't long in or tall
But to tell you the truth man she's as soft as a butter ball
She got every movement from her head down to her toe
She got every movement from her head down to her toe
And she can break in on the dollar man busting it where she goes
She was my best mama but she wouldn't treat me right
I said she was my best mama but she wouldn't treat me right
She wouldn't do nothin' but barrelhouse
all night long
I'm gonna get a mama I mean with lots of buck
I'm gonna get a mama I mean with lots of buck
I want to be gone mama so I can change my luck
Be gone mama be gone
You can't change it
can't rearrange it
If time is all that we got
then baby let's take it
Lovin' is a lovin'
the moment is a-right
It's worth all the years in the past
let's go one more night
Get away from the blind side of life
Honey I want you to be by my side
Me and my back door moves ain't no more
no more
Get away from the blind side of life
Honey I want you to be by my side
Me and my back door moves ain't no more
no more
Get away from the blind side of life
Honey I want you to be by my side
Me and my back door moves ain't no more
no more
Goodnight my darlin'
another day has passed
Forget all those painful memories
our love's gonna last
Come to me baby come to me one more time

Ride our way home let's glide our way home
Let's go let's go let's go let's go

There's a change in your loving
Strange kind of loving
A change in your loving
You are cold to the touch
Change in your loving
Strange kind of loving baby
A change in your loving
Once you loved me so much
You started a fire
Inside of me
My burning hot body
Was a hundred and three
But lately I'm feeling
A drop in temperature
You're cooling down baby
And I'm begging for more
There's a change in your loving
Strange kind of loving
A change in your loving
You are cold to the touch
Change in your loving
Strange kind of loving baby
A change in your loving
Once you loved me so much
With you I was feeling
So secure
When I was down and had the blues
You had the cure
Now things are so different
But I believe I understand
I may be sharing your lips
With another man
Change in your loving
Strange kind of loving
A change in your loving
You are cold to the touch
There's a change in your loving
Strange kind of loving baby
A change in your loving
Once you loved me so much
A change in your loving
A change in your loving
Woke up this morning
after another one of those crazy dreams
Oh nothing is going right this morning
the whole world is wrong it seems
Oh I guess it's the chain that bind me
I can't shake it loose these chains and things
Got to work this morning
seems like everything is lost
I got a cold hearted wrong doing woman
and a slave driving ball
I can't loosen these chains that bind me
can't shake them loosen these chains and things
Just can't loosen these chains and things
Well you talk about hard luck and trouble
seems to be my middle name
All the odds are against me
yes I can only play a losing game
These chains that bind me
can't loosen these chains and things
Just can't loosen these chains and things
Oh I would pack up and leave today people
but I ain't got nowhere to go
Ain't got money to buy a ticket
and I don't feel like walking anymore
These chains that bind me
I can't lose I can't lose these chains and things
The judge found me guilty the clerk he wrote it down
The judge found me guilty the clerk he wrote it down
Just a poor gal in trouble I know I'm county road bound
Many days of sorrow many nights of woe
Many days of sorrow many nights of woe
And a ball and chain everywhere I go
Chains on my feet padlock on my hand
Chains on my feet padlock on my hand
It's all on account of stealing a woman's man
It was early this morning that I had my trial
It was early this morning that I had my trial
Ninety days on the county road and judge didn't even smile
I woke up this mornin' with these certified blues they sure been stalkin' me 'round
So down tonight I couldn't tie my shoes
They about to drop me in the ground
If I could shake loose I would feel so fine
There's one thing for sure and it's on my mind
These certified blues are gonna take their time
I've been livin' here way down South a place that I wanna stay
Been workin' hard just to feed my mouth
Just can keep them blues away
There's one thing for sure and it's on my mind
These certified blues are gonna take their time
If I could shake loose I would feel so fine
You say you're feelin' bad and you don't know why
You're broke and your woman been ly'n'
And just one thing before I'm fired the blues have just been certified
If I could shake loose I would feel so fine
There's one thing for sure and it's on my mind
These certified blues are gonna take their time
Folks I know a gal named Cemetery Lize down in Tennessee
She has got a pair of mean old graveyard eyes full of misery
Every night and day you can hear her sing a blues away
I'm going down to the cemetery 'cause the world is all wrong
I'm going down to the cemetery 'cause the world is all wrong
Down there with the spooks to hear 'em sing my sorrow song
Got a date to see a ghost by the name of Jones
Got a date to see a ghost by the name of Jones
Makes me feel happy to hear him rattle his bones
He's one man I always know just where to find
He's one man I always know just where to find
When you want true lovin' go and get the cemetery kind
He ain't no fine dresser he don't wear nothing but a sack
Yeah he ain't no fine dresser he don't wear nothing but a sack
Everytime he kisses me that funny feeling creeps up my back
Here I am head over heel in love again
Here I am head over heel in love again
Besides you woman it was my mother and that's where love begins
I used to be a playboy I played hard both night and day
I used to be a playboy and I played hard both night and day
But since I met Miss Lemon she has made me change my ways
Oh yes woman you've caught the old coon at last
Oh yes woman you have caught the old coon at last
But I just hope I be happy with my future as I am with my present and past
Yes yes yes yes yes
They caught the old coon at last
Now I love the life I'm livin' and I'm livin' the life I love
Now I love the life I'm livin' and I'm livin' the life I love
Woman I don't believe I could be any happier if I was livin' in heaven above
I'm not feeling like I usually do
I think it might have something
To do with you
Every time you're near me
My body gets hot
Don't need a doctor
I know what I've got
Caught a touch of your love
It came on overnight
I must have held you too tight
Last night
Caught a touch of your love
Your affection has affected me
I'm feeling kind of dizzy
And weak in the knees
I've been in love before
But never so bad
You're in my system
And it's driving me mad
The fever from your kisses
Tears me apart
It starts from your lips
And goes straight to my heart
No use pretending
'Cause baby I'm sure
There's no cure
And I've just gotta have more
Well I wish I was a catfish
Swimmin' in the deep blue sea
I'd have all you women
Fishin' after me
Fishin' after me
Fishin' after me
Well I'm broke and I'm hungry
Ragged and I'm dirty too
Well if I clean up baby can I
Stay home with you
Stay home with you
Stay home with you
If I can't can't come in
Let me sit down front of your door
I'll leave so early your
Mom won't know
Won't never know
Won't never know
Oh I know know my baby
Well she's going to jump and shout
When my train pulls in and I
I come walkin' out
Come walkin' out
Come walkin' out
Yes I'm goin' babe I'm goin'
And your crying won't make me stay
Oh the more you cry baby
More I'll go away
More I'll go away
More I'll go away
Well now I know I know you don't want me
Why in the world won't you tell me so
Then I won't be caught baby 'round
Your house no more
Your house no more
Your house no more
Well I walked down to my bank just to see what I could see
I asked the man behind the desk I say "Ah is there any money for me"
Now he didn't know just what to say
I say "I need that money in a terrible way"
Now he didn't say "yeah" but he didn't say "no"
He just shook my hand and showed me the door
Oh Lord the blues is killin' me
Oh Lord Lord Lord these blues is killin' me
Yes sir

She runs to the store and she buys on time

What Oh what are you gonna do with me
Ooo wow uh
But I was cool
So I "one for the roaded" at a all night bar
I wound up so loaded I tore up my car
The judge threw the book at me
An' when I read the sentence there I said:
"Oow Please oooow ooow please I got to know I got to know
What what went wrong
I don't underst I oh a
But I was cool
So I said she's the only one that I have to pay
And I found her an' pulled my gun an' fired point blank
The shot whistled right past that woman's head
An' I killed my hound dog dead
Oooooow ruff ruff rrr rrr rrr rur rur rur
As they carried me away
I was overheard to say
"Be cool be cool stay cool be cool"
My woman's been accusing me
Of stepping out
Jealous rumors have her mind filled
With so much doubt
And I've gotta convince her
I'm not doing her wrong
Before she leaves me
Sad and all alone
So when the clock hits five
I'll be gone
There's a matter
That I'm gonna settle later on
So if the boss man talks
About overtime
I'm just gonna smile
and pay him no mind
I've got business with my baby tonight
We're gonna talk things over
And make things right
'Cause I couldn't sleep at all
Since we had our fight
I've got business with my baby tonight
We'll go out to dinner
At our favorite restaurant
I'll hold her hand
And tell her she's all I'll ever want
When we get home
I'll take her straight to paradise
And we'll still be loving
Till the morning light
I've got business with my baby tonight
We're gonna talk things over
And make things right
'Cause I couldn't sleep at all
Since we had our fight
I've got business with my baby tonight
Now don't you start talking
About gossip or news
I'm warning you now
I'll put on my walking shoes
'Cause to me nothing in this world
Is a big deal
When it's compared to the way
She makes me feel all right
I've got business with my baby tonight
We're gonna talk things over
And make things right
'Cause I couldn't sleep at all
Since we had our fight
I've got business with my baby tonight
BB's got business tonight
We're gotta talk things over
And make things right
'Cause I couldn't sleep at all
Since we had our fight
I've got business with my baby tonight

You broke your promise baby
You don't love honor or obey
You won't do nothing I tell you
You go on mistreating me everyday
You're hardly acting your part baby
You won't do nothing the preacher says
You don't love me baby
You don't even wish me well
Honor's just a joke with you baby
You don't love me I can tell
Married life with you baby
I'd rather be living in a cell
You deceive me baby
You use me like a child
You tricked me into loving you baby
I was loving you all the while
You played with my heart baby
I said I was loving you all the while
You're breaking my heart baby
There ain't a damn thing I can do
You got me wringing my hands
And crying baby
While you're breaking my heart in two
You know I just can't believe
I can't believe baby
That you're doing the things you do
I can't believe baby
I can't believe you would do me wrong
Please have mercy on me baby
I want you to come on back
Come on back where you belong
I want you so bad
I want you so bad baby
You know I need my lady home
I used to be a big shot long ago

Real fine women used to chase me down
Now not one-a those gals can be found
They're never home whenever I call
Don't seem to want me around at all
I'm broke I'm broke I'm broke I'm broke
Stone-cold broke I ain't got a lousy dime
Went to a nightclub an' had my fun
Shuckin' an' jivin' wit'

Drinkin' that beer an' gin an' wine
Boy I'm tellin' ya I had a good time
When I got home I didn't have no loot
Had to go down an' pawn my suit
I'm broke I'm broke I'm broke I'm broke ha-ha
Stone-cold broke I ain't got a lousy dime
Now I'm a low-down dirty bum
Right back where I started from

Huffin' an' puffin' can't raise a cent
Put me out I can't pay my rent
I'm broke I'm broke I'm broke I'm broke
Stone-cold broke I ain't got a lousy dime
Spoken:
"Damn I'm broke man I got no damn money"
"What n' the hell am I gonna do now"

I don't want no sugar put into my tea
I don't want no sugar put into my tea
The mens are so evil I'm scared they might poison me
I went downtown
I bought myself a hat
I brought it back home
I laid it on the shelf
I looked in my bedroom
Tired sleepin' by myself
I'm tired sleepin' by myself
Up from the ashes out of the flames
Keeps gettin' stronger like a slow rollin' train
Watch it run
Oh why do the good die young
Burnin' like a shootin' star
Born with a broken heart
Off in the distance it was callin' my name
So I took me a ride on that slow rollin' train
It still runs
But it seems that the good die young
Playin' on that sad guitar
Born with a broken heart
Burnin' like a shootin' star
Born with a broken heart
Seems it was over before it begun
Killed by a bullet from a six-string gun
Bang a drum
Oh why do the good die young
Ridin' in a long black car
Born with a broken heart
Playin' on that sad guitar
Born with a broken heart
Burnin' like a shootin' star
Born with a broken heart
One two
Born under a bad sign
I been down since I begin to crawl
If it wasn't for bad luck I wouldn't have no luck at all
Hard luck and trouble is my only friend
I been on my own ever since I was ten
Born under a bad sign
I been down since I begin to crawl
If it wasn't for bad luck I wouldn't have no luck at all
I can't read haven't learned how to write
My whole life has been one big fight
Born under a bad sign
I been down since I begin to crawl
If it wasn't for bad luck I wouldn't have no luck at all
I ain't lyin'
If it wasn't for bad luck I wouldn't have no kind-a luck
If it wasn't for real bad luck I wouldn't have no luck at all
Wine and women is all I crave
A big legged woman is gonna carry me to my grave
Born under a bad sign
I been down since I begin to crawl
If it wasn't for bad luck I wouldn't have no luck at all
Yeah my bad luck boy
Been havin' bad luck all of my days yes

Just for daddy to have some place to lay his weary head

Feeling disgusted and blue

No one to tell your troubles to
That's the time you'll hang your head
And begin to cry
All your friends forsake you

And your friends can't be found
Not a soul to ease your pain
You will plead in vain
You've got those bleeding hearted blues

Ma:
"All these many years I've been pleadin' for a man
How come I can't get me a real monkey man
I'm not no triflin' woman
I've been lookin' for a man I can call my own
Been married many times but they left my home
Ah big feelin' blues worst I ever had
I've got the big feelin' blues I mean I've got them bad"
Charlie :
"If you're lookin' for a brown come get this chocolate cream
I'm a big kid-man - just out of my teens"
Ma:
"Ah big feelin' blues worst I ever had
I've got them big feelin' blues I mean I've got them bad"
"Unlucky with my yellow unlucky with my brown
the black bitches keep on throwin' me down'
"Ah big feelin' blues worst I've ever had
I've got the big feelin' blues I mean I've got them bad"
Charlie:
"If you need a good man why don't you try me
I sure can put you out of your misery"

Hey fellas yes you fellas listen to me I got something to tell you
And I want you to listen to every word and govern yourselves accordingly
Now you see these girls with these fine diamonds fine furs and fine clothes
Well they're looking for a husband and you're listening to a man who knows
They ain't foolin' and if you fool around with them
You're gonna get yourself in a schoolin'
Listen if she saves you dough and won't go to the show
Beware
If she's easy to kiss and won't resist
Beware
And if you go for a walk and she listens while you talk
She's tryin' to hook you
And nobody's lookin' and she asks you to taste her cookin'
Don't do it don't do it
And if you go to a show and she wants to sit in the back row
Bring her down front bring her right down front
If you wanna go for a snack and she wants to sit in the booth in the back
Beware
And listen if she's used to caviar and fine silk
When you go out with her she wanna a hot dog and a malted milk
She's trying to get you
If you're used to goin' to Carnegie Hall but when you take her out night club'ing
All she wants is one meatball
You better take it easy
If she grabs your hand and says "Darling you're such a nice man"
Beware I'm telling you
Should I tell them no more
Tell them everything
You better listen to me 'cause I'm telling you what's being put down
You better pick up on it
If her sister calls your brother you better get further
I'm telling you you better watch it
And if she's acting kind of wild and she says "Darling give me a trial"
Don't you do it don't be weak don't give it to her
And if she smiles in your face and just melts into place
Let her melt forget it let her melt
Should I tell them no more
Tell them everything
Now listen if she calls you up on the phone and says
"Darling are you all alone"
Tell her "No no I've got two three women with me"
Don't pay no attention to women
Stand up for your right be a man be a man
Are you listening
If you turn out the lights and she don't fight
That's the end it's too late
She's got you hooked you might as well stick with her
Should I tell them no more
If you get home about two and don't know what to do
You pull back the curtains and the whole family's looking at you
Get your business straight
Set the date don't be late
Brother beware beware beware
Brother you better beware
I've been around and I've seen some things
People moving faster than the speed of sound
Faster than the speeding bullet
People living like Superman
All day and all night
And I won't say if it's wrong or if it's right
I'm pretty fast myself
But I do have some advice to pass along
Along in the chorus of this song
Better not look down if you want to keep on flying
Put the hammer down keep it full speed ahead
Better not look back or you might just wind up crying
You can keep it moving if you don't look down
An old girl friend of mine showed up the other day
That girl have lived in love and for love
and over love and under love all her life
If the arrows from cupid's bow that had
passed through her heart had been sticking
Out of her body she would have looked like a porcupine
And she asked me "BB do you think I've lived my life all wrong"
And I said: "The only advice I have to pass
along in the chorus of this song" girl
Better not look down if you want to keep on flying
Put the hammer down keep it full speed ahead
Better not look back or you might just wind up crying
You can keep it moving if you don't look down
I was walking down the street at sunrise one morning in London England
And there was a very large Rolls Royce limousine
pulling slowly along the street
And in that Rolls Royce was the queen of England looking tired
Just go back from a party and the queen leaned out and
she said: "Aren't you BB King"
She said: "Oh BB sometimes it's so hard to pull things together
Could you tell me what you think I ought to do"
And I said:
Better not look down if you want to keep on flying
Put the hammer down keep it full speed ahead
Better not look back or you might just wind up crying
You can keep it moving if you don't look down
Better not look down if you want to keep on flying
Put the hammer down keep it full speed ahead
Better not look back or you might just wind up crying
You can keep it moving if you don't look down
I've been wrong wrong for so long
Living life like this I just can't go on
Without a helping hand
I just can't seem to find my way
So I'll keep waiting waiting for my better days
Better Days
Now I said a prayer last night
when my day was through
That I could live my life
the way the Lord would want me to
'Cause without a helping hand
I just can't seem to find my way
So I'll keep waiting waiting for my better days
Better Days
Tell me I have a home just as long as you have yours
'Cause there's a pain in my heart
Oh that I've just got to cure
Please please baby won't you take me in
There's been too many times I needed to find a true friend
Say you'll always always tell the truth to me
'Cause there's been too many times
that I've been lied to and deceived
and somehow I got lost and now I can't find my way
Oh I guess I'll keep waiting waiting for my better days
Better Days
Tell me I have a home just as long as you have yours
'Cause there's a pain in my heart
Oh that I've just got to cure
and somehow I got lost and now I can't find my way
Oh I guess I'll keep waiting waiting for my better days
Better Days
If you don't bend you'll have to break
It's good advise but a little too late
Nothin' but trouble everywhere I go yeah
What I've been through you never know
Got me down on my bendin' knee
Weepin' and bendin' like a willow tree
I'm not lyin' it's not a fake
You can tell by the look on my face
Just so much a man can take
Sooner or later he's gotta break
Yes I'm down on my bendin' knee
Weeping an' bendin' like a willow tree
Like a bitter pill that ya have to take
I'm beggin' you baby you say it's too late
For goodness sakes please give me a break
Just a little more that I can take
Got me down on my bendin' knee
Weepin' and bendin' like a willow tree
I seen every one of the faces you wear low high and everything in between Your eyes are fixed on the prize like a dead man's stare Tick tock the hands on the clock don't care
Buzz is good Feelin' fine One of these days you'll be out of time God ain't gonna look for you down in the lost and found You better look up or you're gonna be gone before you hit the ground
You'll keep dippin' in till the well run dry hope you don't get thirsty later I know talking to you's just a waste of my time I'm gonna stop tellin' you how to live your life
One more time to score so make it fast when you lose your mind you got no mind left to lose Three four open the door to your last chance and when you get where you're goin' you won't be comin' back
You better look up or you're gonna be gone
before you hit the ground
Before you accuse me take a look at yourself
Before you accuse me take a look at yourself
You say I've been buyin' another woman clothes but you've been talkin' to someone else
I called your mama 'bout three or four nights ago
I called your mama 'bout three or four nights ago
Your mama said "Son don't call my daughter no more"
Before you accuse me take a look at yourself
Before you accuse me take a look at yourself
You say I've been buyin' another woman clothes but you've been takin' money from someone else
Come on back home baby; try my love one more time
Come on back home baby; try my love one more time
You've been gone away so long I'm just about to lose my mind
Now I walked into a beer tavern
To give a girl a nice time
When I entered I had forty-five dollars
When I left I had one dime
Wasn't that a beer drinkin' woman
Don't you know man don't you know
She was a beer drinkin' woman
I don't want to see her no more
Now when I spent down to my last dime
She says "Daddy I know you're not through"
I told her "Yes baby doll and the diploma belongs to you"
Wasn't that a beer drinkin' woman
Don't you know man don't you know
She was a beer drinkin' woman
And I don't want to see her no more
She would often say "Excuse me a minute
I've got to step around here"
And every time she'd come back
She'd say "I want another quart of beer"
Wasn't that a beer drinkin' woman
Don't you know man don't you know
Boy she was the toughest I met
Lord she was a beer drinkin' woman
I don't want to see her no more
I say "I've got to step off baby
anything else you would like"
She said "Daddy I'll keep this table
If you promise me you'll be back"
You know that was a beer drinkin' woman
Don't you know man don't you know
She was a beer drinkin' woman
I don't wanna see her no more
I says "I'm sorry baby but I only have one more dime"
She said "Daddy buy me a small bottle of beer
so I can concentrate my mind"
Wasn't that a beer drinkin' woman
Don't you know man don't you know
Lord she was a beer drinkin' woman
I don't wanna see her no more
I met a fine beautician in a very fine condition
She was long and lean and you know what that means
She's a good lovin' mama a hard workin' woman
She makes a lot of money I don't have to worry about a thing
She works hard all day dressin' hair
Man you can bet I want to get somewhere
With my good lovin' mama my hard workin' woman
She makes a lot of money I don't have a worry about a thing
I meet the finest woman from everywhere
Because my baby dress their hair
I'll be her lover boy she treats me like a king
She makes a lot of money don't have to worry about a thing
Yes she keeps her hair so neat and fine
And every pound of her is mine
I'll be her lover boy I'll be happy as a king
She makes a lot of money don't have to worry about a thing
Minnie Neal down in Beale gave her papa the air
Left him cold got him told said she didn't care
Poor Joe her beau looked just like he would die
If you were near him you would hear him start his mournful cry
Beale Street papa why don't you come back home
It isn't proper to leave your mama all alone
Sometimes I was cruel that was true
But papa you know mama never two-times you
Ooh-ooh I'm blue
So how come you do me like you do I'm crying
Beale Street papa don't mess around with me
There's plenty of petting that I can get in Tennessee
I still get my sweet cookies constantly
But not the kind you serve to me
So Beale Street papa come back home

Enough trouble to make poor girl wonder where she gonna go
They rowed a little boat about five miles 'cross the farm

It thundered and it lightened and the winds began to blow

From Hollywood and Vine
To the Sunset Strip
There's so much going on
You can lose your grip
From early in the morning
Until late at night
They'll do you so wrong
They'll do you so right
Back in LA
Waiting for the sun to shine
Back in LA
Living down a life of crime
Back in LA
Working on another line
Back in LA
To pick up the dime
You must do the time
From way up in the canyons
Where the hot winds howl
To the mean city streets
Where the night hawks prowl
I can feel the rhythm play
The whole night long
Guess I'll stay in LA
And listen to this song
Back in LA
Waiting for the sun to shine
Back in LA
Living down a life of crime
Back in LA
Working on another line
Back in LA
To pick up the dime
You must do the time
You must do the time

Happy New Year is after that happy I'll be that is a fact

Everyone must watch their step or they will loose their rep
Everybody full of fare at the Christmas Ball
Excellent Joe Smith solo
Grab your partner one an' all keep on dancing 'round the hall

And I've tried to give you everything in the world
When all you really wanted - to wound my heart oh-ho
Angelina baby won't you please come home
Oh Angelina baby won't you please come home
You know my heart is aching and all my dreams have gone
Well I've tried to love you with diamonds and pearls

When the shadows fallin' and the day turns into night I hear my angel callin' and I can't wait to see the light Angel of mercy you don't need no golden wing The way you came down to my rescue heaven must be watchin' over me
Sometimes I get a feelin' like a fever comin' over me just a touch of my angels hand and I'm right back on my feet

Stay with me baby come down from the sky Just like an angel take me to paradise

The way you came down to my rescue

I am an old woman
Named after my mother
My old man is another
Child that's grown old
If dreams were thunder
And lightnin' was desire
This old house would'a burned down
A long time ago
Make me an angel to fly from Montgomery
Make me a poster of an old rodeo
Just give me one thing I can hold onto
To believe in this living is just a hard way to go
When I was a young girl
I had me a cowboy
He wasn't much to look at
Just a free ramblin' man
Aw but that was a long time
And no matter how I try
Those years they just flow by
Like a broken-down dam
Make me an angel to fly from Montgomery
Make me a poster of an old rodeo
Just give me one thing I can hold onto
To believe in this living is just a hard way to go
There's flies in the kitchen
I can hear 'em a-buzzin'
But I ain't done nothin'
Since I woke up today
How the hell can a person
Go to work in the mornin'
And come home in the evenin'
And have nothin' to say
Make me an angel to fly from Montgomery
Make me a poster of an old rodeo
Just give me one thing I can hold onto
To believe in this living is just a hard way to go
There's a girl in the town calling my name
She says I put her down and I'm the one to blame
Well I broke her heart and left her here to cry
And I know that girl is telling me a lie
She says "I left and took back my ring
I don't remember a god-darn thing"
I used to like to run around
My reputation was going down
Spent my money like it was out of style
I wouldn't even give my gal a smile
She says "I left and took back my ring
I really don't remember a thing"
Amnesia amnesia amnesia
Baby what I do
Amnesia amnesia amnesia
Baby what I do
I used to like to run around
With every little girl in this town
Well I spent my money like it was out of style
I wouldn't even give my gal a smile
She says she wants me to come home
I wish the girl would just leave me alone
Amnesia amnesia amnesia
Baby what I do
Am I wrong fallin' in love with you
tell me am I wrong well fallin' in love with you
While your other man was out there
cheatin' and lyin' steppin' all over you
Uh sweet thing
Tell me am I wrong holdin' on to you so tight
Tell me tell me am I wrong holdin' on to you so tight
If your other man come to claim you
he'd better be ready ready for a long long fight
Well I gotta be strong well I know you're dependin' on me
You know I gotta be strong I know you're dependin' on me
To give you all of my attention
all of my time and all of the love you need
Oh tell me am I wrong tryin' to hold on to you
Tell me am I wrong tryin' to hold on to you
I just wanna make a home for you baby
and all of your children too
Tell me am I wrong fallin' in love with you

While your other man was out there
cheatin' and lyin' steppin' all over you
While your other man was out there

When I lost my baby I almost lost my mind
When I lost my baby I almost lost my mind
My eyes was full of tears since she left me behind
I pass a million people; I can't tell who I meet
I pass a million people; I can't tell who I meet
My eyes are full of tears where can my baby be
I went to see a gypsy to get my fortune read
I went to see a gypsy to have my fortune read
My head hung in sorrow when she said what she said
When I lost my baby I almost lost my mind
When I lost my baby I almost lost my mind
When I lost my baby I almost lost my mind

I ain't gone 'n' give up on love
love won't give up on me

pounds with joy and not with pain
Every beat of my heart
pounds with joy and not in vain
And although those are painful memories

Baby ain't nobody home chorus: nobody's home

One night farmer Brown was takin' the air
Locked up the barnyard with the greatest of care
Down in the hen house something stirred
When he shouted "Who's there"
This is what he heard
There ain't nobody here but us chickens
There ain't nobody here at all

We chickens tryin' to sleep and you butt in
And hobble hobble hobble hobble with your chin
There ain't nobody here but us chickens

We got ground to dig and worms to scratch
It takes a lot of sittin' gettin' chicks to hatch
Oh there ain't nobody here but us chickens
There ain't nobody here at all
So quiet yourself and stop that fuss
There ain't nobody here but us
Kindly point the gun the other way
And hobble hobble hobble hobble off and hit the hay

Then the other night he had a fight
with a gal named Mandy Brown

Aggravatin' papa don't you try to two-time me
Now won't you listen dearie while I say

Don't say that we must part don't break my aching heart
You know I've loved you truly many years loved you night and day
How can you leave me can't you see my tears
Listen while I say
After you've gone and left me crying
After you've gone there's no denying
You'll feel blue you'll feel sad
You'll miss the dearest pal you've ever had
There'll come a time now don't forget it
There'll come a time when you'll regret it
Some day when you grow lonely
You heart will break like mine and you'll want me only
After you've gone after you've gone away
After I'm gone after we break up
After I'm gone you're gonna wake up
You will find you were blind
To let somebody come and change your mind
After the years we've been together
Their joy and tears all kinds of weather
Someday blue and downhearted
You'll long to be with me right back where you started
After I'm gone after I'm gone away
You won't listen to nothing I tell you baby you keep on doing just as you please

I was over in Aberdeen
on my way to New Orleans
I was over in Aberdeen
on my way to New Orleans
Well them Aberdeen women told me

Aberdeen is my home

If I'm never gonna see you no more
Well it's goodbye baby
if I'm never gonna see you no more
I'm gonna tell everybody you've been
still knockin' at my door
The late show is over
And the city is fast asleep
And I'm lost in a world
That's just too cold and deep
I've turned so many ways
I'm spinning like a top
I wish that I could get off
Or get this world to stop
I'm a stranger and afraid
I'm a stranger and afraid
I'm a stranger and afraid
In a world I never made
I'm always chasing dragons
With a sword that's made of tin
So I know in my soul
There's no way I can win
I tried oh I tried
But there's no place no place to go
There's no one here who knows me
And no one here I know
I'm a stranger and afraid
I'm a stranger and afraid
I'm a stranger and afraid
In a world I never made
You and me don't see eye to eye
On every little thing
We've missed a lot of sunshine
And caught a lot of rain
If you want to leave I can't make you stay
But there is something I have to say
No matter how high you get
Or how low you go
There's one thing darling
You ought to know
There's a world full of strangers out there
A world full of strangers
Beware
There's a world full of strangers out there
And if it gets too strange
Just come on home
Restless hearts looking for a love
Are waiting in the street
They're all prepared to give you
The bitter with the sweet
If you wake someday and you reach for me
Well you know this is where I'll be
No matter how high you get
Or how low you go
There's one thing darling
You ought to know
There's a world full of strangers out there
A world full of strangers
Beware
There's a world full of strangers out there
And if it gets too strange
Just come on home
You may be rich
You may be poor
You may be high
Or you just may be low
But if you fall in love
Oh and you should lose
A woman don't care
She don't care who she gives the blues
Wo you may be young
You may be old
Maybe you've heard
Or maybe you've never been told
If you've got a good woman
Oh try not to misuse
Oh a woman don't care
She don't care who she gives the blues
She'll make you hot in the winter
Make you cold in the summertime
She'll make you feel young in the spring
And in the fall drive you out of your mind
A woman don't you hear me callin' you
Yeah woman you don't care
Yeah you don't care who you give the blues
Oh you may be up
You may be down
You may be short tall skinny
Or you just might be round
Oh don't be too sure of your woman
Thinkin' man that you can't lose
Oh remember that a woman don't care
She don't care who she gives the blues
I got a whole lot o' lovin' baby just waiting for you

eyes
Went to a party the New York style
I met a lady make a sane man wild
She said the words only her lips could say
She made me want to throw my life away
But when I asked her she said "Maybe tomorrow BB"
And that's a story everybody knows
I took her flying out across the sea
I thought I had her I know that she had me
And when we landed it was Paris France
Seemed like a nice place for some French romance
But when I touched her she said "Maybe a little later BB"
And that's the story everybody knows
We went to Berlin and to Stockholm too
And on the Moscow then to the Peking Zoo
As far as travel she couldn't get too much
Somewhere in Oakland she let me have just a little touch
And then she said "I'm late for beauty appointment
I've got a headache and I believe I'm coming down with the flu"
And that's the story everybody knows
Seems like now days ain#;t nothin#; meant to last one day you#;ve got it all and then it disappears so fast and you know our love is on and off again Well I know you wanna quit me baby but a quitter never wins
Well you#;ve walked out on our lovin#; but I#;ve stayed through thick and thin and you know our love is on and off again I know you want to quit me but a quitter never wins
Seems like now days love is a word that no one means Ya said you#;d never leave me then ya upped and walked right out on me and now our love is on and off again Well I know you wanna quit me but a quitter never wins
Well I know you wanna quit me baby

And she looked at me real cool
She said "Albert you ain't nothin' but a overgrown fool
I'm gonna leave you gonna leave you behind"
I said " Baby I'm gonna tell you that a good fool is hard to find"
Now baby if you leave me it would hurt me to my soul
I just can't understand why baby any woman could be so cold
But a good fool a good fool is hard to find
Take a lesson from me baby a good fool is hard to find
The last time you left me I didn't have much to lose
You left me with nothin' woman but a pair of thin-sole shoe
But a good fool a good fool is hard to find
Take a lesson from me baby a good fool is hard to find
Now listen to me baby I think you should be told
When they made yo' daddy somebody went an' broke the mold
A good fool a good fool is hard to find
You take the lesson from me woman a good fool is hard to find
Sittin' here in my problem
What am I gonna do now
Am I gonna make it
Someway somehow
Maybe I'm not supposed to know
Maybe I'm supposed to cry
And if nobody ever knows
The way I feel
It's all right
And it'll be ok
Chorus:
I'm gonna make my world a better place
I'm gonna keep that smile on my face
I'm gonna teach myself how to understand
I'm gonna make myself a better man
Climbing out of the window
Climbing up the wall
Is anybody gonna save me
Or are they gonna let me fall
Well I don't really wanna know
I#;ll just hold on the best I can
And if I fall down
I#;ll just get back up
It'll be alright
It'll be ok
Chorus x
Maybe I'm not supposed to know
Maybe I'm supposed to cry
And if nobody ever knows
The way I feel
That's all right
It'll be ok
Chorus x

I went down to old Joe's bar room on the corner by the square
Well the drinks were bein' served as usual and this motley crowd was there
Well on my left stood Joe McKennedy and his eyes were bloodshot red
When he told me that sad story these were the words he said:
I went down to the St James infirmary I saw my baby there
She was stretched out on a long white table so cold and fine and fair
Go ahead
Let her go let her go God bless her wherever she may be
She can search this world over never find another man like me
Yes sixteen coal black horses to pull that rubber tied hack
Well it's seventeen miles to the graveyard but my baby's never comin' back
Well now you've heard my story well have another round of booze
And if anyone should ever ever ask you I've got the St James infirmary blues
Cryin' Lord I wonder will I ever ooo get back ho-ooome

So many days I done traveling way-sided more
So many days I done traveling way-sided more
Wonder if possible ooo will I ever ooo get back ho-oome
