<p><name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> looked out from the shelter of <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>'s cloak. He wondered if he was awake or still sleeping, still in the swift-moving dream in which he had been wrapped so long since the great <name type="GPE">ri</name>de began. The dark world was rushing by and the wind sang loudly in his ears. He could see nothing but the wheeling stars, and away to his <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght vast shadows against the sky where the mountains of the <name type="LOC">South</name> <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ched past. Sleepily he t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed to reckon the times and stages of their journey, but his memory was drowsy and uncertain.</p>
<p>There had been the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> <name type="GPE">ri</name>de at ter<name type="GPE">ri</name>ble speed without a halt, and then in the <name type="TIME">dawn</name> he had seen a pale gleam of gold, and they had come to the silent town and the great empty house on the <name type="ORG">hill</name>. And hardly had they reached its shelter when the winged shadow had passed over once again, and men wilted with fear. But <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> had spoken soft words to him, and he had slept in a corner, tired but uneasy, dimly aware of comings and goings and of men talking and <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> giving orders. And then again <name type="GPE">ri</name>ding, <name type="GPE">ri</name>ding in the <name type="TIME">night</name>. This was the <name type="ORG">sec</name>ond, no, the <name type="ORDINAL">third</name> <name type="TIME">night</name> since he had looked in the <name type="ORG">St<name type="CARDINAL">one</name></name>. And with that hideous memory he woke fully, and shivered, and the noise of the wind became filled with menacing voices.</p>
<p>A light kindled in the sky, a blaze of yellow fire behind dark bar<name type="GPE">ri</name>ers <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> cowered back, afraid for a moment, wonde<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng into what dreadful country <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> was bea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng him. He rubbed his eyes, and then he saw that it was the moon <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing above the eastern shadows, now almost at the full. So the <name type="TIME">night</name> was not yet old and for <name type="TIME">hour</name>s the dark journey would go on. He stirred and spoke.</p>
<p><q>'Where are we, <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>?'</q> he asked.</p>
<p><q>'In the realm of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>,'</q> the wizard answered. <q>'The land of <name type="PERSON">An�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en</name> is still passing by.'</q></p>
<p>There was a silence again for a while. Then, <q>'What is that?'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> suddenly, clut<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g at <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>'s cloak. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok! <name type="ORG">Fire</name>, red fire! Are there dragons in this land? <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok, there is another!'</q></p>
<p>For answer <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed aloud to his horse. <q>'On, <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>fax! We must has<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>. <name type="PERSON">Tim</name>e is short. See! The beacons of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> are alight, calling for aid. War is kindled. See, there is the fire on <name type="GPE">Amon D�n</name>, and flame on <name type="GPE">Eilenach</name>; and there they go speeding west: <name type="GPE">Nar<name type="PERSON">dol</name></name>, Erelas, <name type="GPE">Min-<name type="PERSON">Rimmon</name></name>, Calenhad, and the <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>ifi<name type="GPE">ri</name>en on the borders of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>.'</q></p>
<p>But <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>fax paused in his st<name type="GPE">ri</name>de, slowing to a walk, and then he lifted up his head and neighed. And out of the darkness the answe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng neigh of other horses came; and presently the thudding of hoofs was heard, and <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> <name type="GPE">ri</name>ders swept up and passed like flying ghosts in the moon and vanished into the <name type="LOC">West</name>. Then <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>fax gathered himself together and sprang away, and the <name type="TIME">night</name> flowed over him like a roa<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng wind.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> became drowsy again and paid little at<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>tion to <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> telling him of the cus<name type="PERSON">tom</name>s of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>, and how the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd of the <name type="LOC">City</name> had beacons built on the tops of outlying <name type="ORG">hill</name>s along both borders of the great range, and maintained posts at these points where fresh horses were always in readiness to bear his errand-<name type="GPE">ri</name>ders to <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> in the <name type="LOC">North</name>, or to <name type="PERSON">Belfalas</name> in the <name type="LOC">South</name>. <q><name type="DATE">'It</name> is long since the beacons of the <name type="LOC">North</name> were lit,'</q> he said; <q>'and in the <name type="DATE">ancient <name type="DATE">day</name>s</name> of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> they were not needed, for they had the <name type="CARDINAL">Seven</name> <name type="ORG">St<name type="CARDINAL">one</name></name>s.'</q> <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> stirred uneasily.</p>
<p><q>'Sleep again, and do not be afraid!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'For you are not going like <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> to <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>, but to Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name>, and there you will be as safe as you can be anywhere in these <name type="DATE">day</name>s. If <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> falls, or the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> is taken, then the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> will be no refuge.'</q></p>
<p><q>'You do not comfort me,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>, but n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>theless sleep crept over him. The last thing that he remembered before he fell into deep dream was a glimpse of high white peaks, glimme<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng like floating isles above the clouds as they caught the light of the weste<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng moon. He wondered where <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> was, and if he was already in <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>, or if he was dead; and he did not know that <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> from far away looked on <name type="TIME">that same moon</name> as it set beyond <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> ere the coming of the <name type="DATE">day</name>.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> woke to the sound of voices. <name type="DATE">Another <name type="DATE">day</name></name> of hiding and <name type="TIME">a <name type="TIME">night</name></name> of journey had fleeted by. It was <name type="TIME">twilight</name>: the cold <name type="TIME">dawn</name> was at hand again, and c<name type="ORG">hill</name> grey mists were about them. <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>fax stood steaming with sweat, but he held his neck proudly and showed no sign of wea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ness. Many tall men heavily cloaked stood beside him, and behind them in the mist loomed a wall of st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. Partly ruinous it seemed, but already before the <name type="TIME">night</name> was passed the sound of hur<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed labour could be heard: beat of hammers, clink of trowels, and the creak of wheels. Torches and flares glowed dully here and there in the fog. <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> was speaking to the men that barred his way, and as he lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> became aware that he himself was being discussed.</p>
<p><q>'Yea truly, we know you, <name type="LOC">Mithrandir</name>,'</q> said the leader of the men, <q>'and you know the pass-words of the <name type="CARDINAL">Seven</name> <name type="FAC">Gate</name>s and are free to go forward. But we do not know your companion. What is he? A dwarf out of the mountains in the <name type="LOC">North</name>? We wish for no strangers in the land at this time, unless they be mighty men of arms in whose faith and help we can trust.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I will vouch for him before the seat of <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q><name type="PERSON">'And</name> as for valour, that cannot be computed by stature. He has passed through more battles and pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ls than you have, <name type="PERSON">Ingold</name>, though you be twice his h<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name>; and he comes now from the storming of <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard, of which we bear tidings, and great wea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ness is on him, or I would wake him. His name is <name type="PERSON">Pereg<name type="GPE">ri</name>n</name>, a very valiant man.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Man?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Ingold</name> dubiously; and the others laughed.</p>
<p><q>'Man!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>, now thoroughly roused. <q>'Man! Indeed not! I am a hobbit and no more valiant than I am a man, save perhaps now and again by necessity. Do not let <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> deceive you!'</q></p>
<p><q>'Many a doer of great deeds might say no more,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Ingold</name>. <q>'But what is a hobbit?'</q></p>
<p><q>'A <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>fling,'</q> answered <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Nay</name>, not the <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> that was spoken of,'</q> he added seeing the wonder in the men's faces. <q><name type="DATE">'No</name>t he, yet <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of his kindred.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Yes, and <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> who journeyed with him,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q><name type="PERSON">'And</name> <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> of your <name type="LOC">City</name> was with us, and he saved me in the snows of the <name type="LOC">North</name>, and at the last he was slain de<name type="PERSON">fen</name>ding me from many foes.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Peace!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'The news of that g<name type="GPE">ri</name>ef should have been told <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> to the father.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'It</name> has been guessed already,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Ingold</name>; <q>'for there have been strange por<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ts here of late. But pass on now quickly! For the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd of Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name> will be eager to see any that bear the latest tidings of his son, be he man or-'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbit,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q>'Little service can I offer to your lord, but what I can do, I would do, remembe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> the brave.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Fare you well!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Ingold</name>; and the men made way for <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name> fax, and he passed through a narrow gate in the wall. <q>'<name type="DATE">May</name> you b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng good counsel to <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name> in his need, and to us all, <name type="LOC">Mithrandir</name>!'</q> <name type="PERSON">Ingold</name> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed. <q>'But you come with tidings of g<name type="GPE">ri</name>ef and danger, as is your wont, they say.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Because I come seldom but when my help is needed,'</q> answered <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q><name type="PERSON">'And</name> as for counsel, to you I would say that you are over-late in repai<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng the wall of the <name type="ORG">Pelennor</name>. <name type="ORG">Courage</name> will now be your best de<name type="PERSON">fen</name>ce against the storm that is at hand � that and such hope as I b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng. For not all the tidings that I b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng are evil. But leave your trowels and sharpen your swords!'</q></p>
<p><q>'The work will be finished ere <name type="TIME">evening</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Ingold</name>. <q>'This is the last portion of the wall to be put in de<name type="PERSON">fen</name>ce: the least open to attack, for it looks towards our f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>. Do you know aught of them? Will they answer the summons, think you?'</q></p>
<p><q>'Yes, they will come. But they have fought many battles at your back. This road and no road looks towards safety any longer. Be vigilant! But for <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> <name type="ORG">Stormcrow</name> you would have seen a host of foes coming out of <name type="PERSON">An�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en</name> and no <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>. And you may yet. Fare you well, and sleep not!'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> passed now into the wide land beyond the <name type="ORG">Rammas</name> Echor. So the men of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> called the out wall that they had built with great labour, after <name type="ORG">Ithil</name>ien fell under the shadow of their Enemy. For <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> leagues or more it ran from the mountains' feet and so back again, enclosing in its <name type="PERSON">fen</name>ce the fields of the <name type="ORG">Pelennor</name>: fair and fertile townlands on the long slopes and terraces falling to the deep levels of the <name type="GPE">Anduin</name>. At its furthest point from the Great <name type="FAC">Gate</name> of the <name type="LOC">City</name>, north-eastward, the wall was <name type="CARDINAL">four</name> leagues distant, and there from a frowning bank it overlooked the long flats beside the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver, and men had made it high and strong; for at that point, upon a walled causeway, the road came in from the <name type="ORG">ford</name>s and b<name type="GPE">ri</name>dges of <name type="NORP">Osgiliath</name> and passed through a guarded gate between embattled towers. At its nearest point the wall was little <name type="CARDINAL">more than <name type="CARDINAL">one</name></name> league from the <name type="LOC">City</name>, and that was south-eastward. There <name type="GPE">Anduin</name>, going in a wide knee about the <name type="ORG">hill</name>s of <name type="PERSON">Emyn Arnen</name> in <name type="LOC">South</name> <name type="ORG">Ithil</name>ien, bent sharply west, and the out-wall rose upon its very b<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk; and beneath it lay the quays and landings of the <name type="PERSON">Harlond</name> for craft that came upstream from the southern fiefs.</p>
<p>The townlands were <name type="GPE">ri</name>ch, with wide tilth and many orchards, and homesteads there were with oast and garner, fold and <name type="ORG">byre</name>, and many <name type="GPE">ri</name>lls <name type="GPE">ri</name>ppling through the green from the highlands down to <name type="GPE">Anduin</name>. Yet the herdsmen and husbandmen that dwelt there were not many, and the most part of the people of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> lived in the <name type="CARDINAL">seven</name> circles of the <name type="LOC">City</name>, or in the high <name type="GPE">vale</name>s of the mountain-borders, in <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ssarnach, or further south in fair <name type="ORG">Lebennin</name> with its <name type="CARDINAL">five</name> swift streams. There dwelt a hardy folk between the mountains and the sea. They were reck<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>d men of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>, yet their blood was mingled, and there were short and <name type="PERSON">swart</name>hy folk among them whose sires came more from the forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> men who housed in the shadow of the <name type="ORG">hill</name>s in the <name type="EVENT">Dark Years</name> ere the coming of the kings. But beyond, in the great fief of <name type="PERSON">Belfalas</name>, dwelt P<name type="GPE">ri</name>nce <name type="PERSON">Imrahil</name> in his castle of Dol <name type="PERSON">Amroth</name> by the sea, and he was of high blood, and his folk also, tall men and proud with sea-grey eyes.</p>
<p>Now after <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> had <name type="GPE">ri</name>dden for some time the light of <name type="DATE">day</name> grew in the sky, and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> roused himself and looked up. To his left lay a sea of mist, <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing to a bleak shadow in the <name type="LOC">East</name>; but to his <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght great mountains reared their heads, ranging from the <name type="LOC">West</name> to a steep and sudden end, as if in the making of the land the <name type="LOC">River</name> had burst through a great bar<name type="GPE">ri</name>er, carving out a mighty valley to be a land of battle and debate in times to come. And there where the White <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s of <name type="ORG">Ered Nimrais</name> came to their end he saw, as <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> had promised, the dark mass of Mount <name type="GPE">Min<name type="PERSON">dol</name>luin</name>, the deep purple shadows of its high <name type="LOC">glen</name>s, and its tall face whi<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing in the <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing <name type="DATE">day</name>. And upon its out-thrust knee was the <name type="ORG">Guard</name>ed <name type="LOC">City</name>, with its <name type="CARDINAL">seven</name> walls of st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> so strong and old that it seemed to have been not builded but <name type="PERSON">carven</name> by <name type="ORG">giants</name> out of the b<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s of the <name type="LOC">earth</name>.</p>
<p>Even as <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> gazed in wonder the walls passed from looming grey to white, blushing faintly in the <name type="TIME">dawn</name>; and suddenly the sun climbed over the eastern shadow and sent forth a shaft that smote the face of the <name type="LOC">City</name>. Then <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed aloud, for the <name type="FAC">Tower</name> of <name type="ORG">Ecthelion</name>, standing high within the topmost walls' sh<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> out against the sky, glimme<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng like a spike of pearl and silver, tall and fair and shapely, and its pinnacle glittered as if it were wrought of crystals; and white banners broke and fluttered from the battlements in the <name type="TIME">morning</name> breeze' and high and far he heard a clear <name type="GPE">ri</name>nging as of silver trumpets.</p>
<p>So <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> and <name type="PERSON">Pereg<name type="GPE">ri</name>n</name> rode to the Great <name type="FAC">Gate</name> of the <name type="ORG">Men</name> of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> at the <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing of the sun, and its iron doors rolled back before them.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="LOC">Mithrandir</name>! <name type="LOC">Mithrandir</name>!'</q> men c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed. <q><name type="DATE">'No</name>w we know that the storm is indeed nigh!'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'It</name> is upon you,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'I have <name type="GPE">ri</name>dden on its wings. Let me pass! I must come to your <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name>, while his stewardship lasts. Whatever betide, you have come to the end of the <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> that you have known. Let me pass!'</q></p>
<p>Then men fell back before the command of his voice and questi<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>d him no further, though they gazed in wonder at the hobbit that sat before him and at the horse that bore him. For the people of the <name type="LOC">City</name> used horses very little and they were seldom seen in their streets, save only those <name type="GPE">ri</name>dden by the errand-<name type="GPE">ri</name>ders of their lord. And they said: <q>'Surely that is <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the great <name type="PERSON">steed</name>s of the <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>? <name type="DATE">May</name>be the Rohir<name type="GPE">ri</name>m will come soon to strengthen us.'</q> But <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>fax walked proudly up the long winding road.</p>
<p>For the fashion of Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name> was such that it was built on <name type="CARDINAL">seven</name> levels, each delved into the <name type="ORG">hill</name>, and about each was set a wall, and in each wall was a gate. But the gates were not set in a line: the Great <name type="FAC">Gate</name> in the <name type="LOC">City</name> Wall was at the east point of the circuit, but the next faced <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> south, and the <name type="ORDINAL">third</name> <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> north, and so to and fro upwards; so that the paved way that climbed towards the <name type="ORG">Citadel</name> turned <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> this way and then that across the face of the <name type="ORG">hill</name>. And each time that it passed the line of the Great <name type="FAC">Gate</name> it went through an arched tunnel, piercing a vast pier of rock whose huge out-thrust bulk divided in <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> all the circles of the <name type="LOC">City</name> save the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>. For partly in the p<name type="GPE">ri</name>meval shaping of the <name type="ORG">hill</name>, partly by the mighty craft and labour of old, there stood up from the rear of the wide court behind the <name type="FAC">Gate</name> a towe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng bastion of st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, its edge sharp as a ship-keel facing east. Up it rose, even to the level of the topmost circle, and there was crowned by a battlement; so that those in the <name type="ORG">Citadel</name> might, like <name type="PERSON">mar</name>iners in a mountainous ship, look from its peak sheer down upon the <name type="FAC">Gate</name> <name type="CARDINAL">seven</name> <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name> feet below. The entrance to the <name type="ORG">Citadel</name> also looked eastward, but was delved in the heart of the rock; thence a long lamp-lit slope ran <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name> the <name type="CARDINAL">seven</name>th gate. Thus men reached at last <name type="ORG">the High Court</name>, and the Place of the Fountain before the feet of the White <name type="FAC">Tower</name>: tall and shapely, <name type="CARDINAL">fifty</name> fathoms from its base to the pinnacle, where the banner of the <name type="ORG">Steward</name>s floated <name type="CARDINAL">a thousand</name> feet above the plain.</p>
<p>A strong citadel it was indeed, and not to be taken by a host of enemies, if there were any within that could hold weapons; unless some foe could come behind and scale the lower skirts of <name type="GPE">Min<name type="PERSON">dol</name>luin</name>, and so come upon the narrow shoulder that joined the <name type="ORG">Hill</name> of <name type="ORG">Guard</name> to the mountain mass. But that shoulder, which rose to the h<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name> of the <name type="ORDINAL">fifth</name> wall, was hedged with great ramparts <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name> the precipice that overhung its western end; and in that space stood the houses and domed <name type="PERSON">tom</name>bs of byg<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> kings and lords, for ever silent between the mountain and the tower.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> gazed in growing wonder at the great st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> city, vaster and more splendid than anything that he had dreamed of; greater and stronger than <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard, and far more beautiful. Yet it was in truth falling <name type="DATE">year</name> by <name type="DATE">year</name> into decay; and already it lacked <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> the men that could have dwelt at ease there. In every street they passed some great house or court over whose doors and arched gates were carved many fair letters of strange and ancient shapes: names <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> guessed of great men and kindreds that had once dwelt there; and yet now they were silent, and no footsteps rang on their wide pavements, nor voice was heard in their halls, nor any face looked out from door or empty window.</p>
<p>At last they came out of shadow to the <name type="CARDINAL">seven</name>th gate, and the warm sun that sh<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> down beyond the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver, as <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> walked in the glades of <name type="ORG">Ithil</name>ien, glowed here on the smooth walls and rooted pillars, and the great arch with keyst<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> <name type="PERSON">carven</name> in the likeness of a crowned and kingly head. <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> dismounted, for no horse was allowed in the <name type="ORG">Citadel</name>, and <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>fax suffered himself to be led away at the soft word of his master.</p>
<p>The <name type="ORG">Guard</name>s of the gate were robed in black, and their helms were of strange shape, high-crowned, with long cheek-guards close-fitting to the face, and above the cheek-guards were set the white wings of sea-birds; but the helms gleamed with a flame of silver, for they were indeed wrought of _<name type="PERSON">mith<name type="GPE">ri</name>l</name>_, heirlooms from the glory of old <name type="DATE">day</name>s. Upon <name type="ORG">the black surcoats</name> were embroidered in white a tree blossoming like snow beneath a silver crown and many-pointed stars. This was the livery of the heirs of <name type="PERSON">Elen</name>dil, and n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> wore it now in all <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>, save the <name type="ORG">Guard</name>s of the <name type="ORG">Citadel</name> before <name type="ORG">the Court of the Fountain</name> where the White <name type="PERSON">Tree</name> once had grown.</p>
<p>Already it seemed that word of their coming had g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> before them: and at once they were admitted, silently, and without question. Quickly <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> strode across the white-paved court. A sweet fountain played there in the <name type="TIME">morning</name> sun, and a sward of b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght green lay about it; but in the midst. drooping over the pool, stood a dead tree, and <name type="DATE">the fall</name>ing drops d<name type="GPE">ri</name>pped sadly from its barren and broken branches back into the clear water.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> glanced at it as he hur<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed after <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. It looked mournful, he thought, and he wondered why the dead tree was left in this place where everything else was well <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ded.</p>
<p>_<name type="CARDINAL">Seven</name> stars and <name type="CARDINAL">seven</name> st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s and <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> white tree._</p>
<p>The words that <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> had murmured came back into his mind. And then he found himself at the doors of the great hall beneath the gleaming tower; and behind the wizard he passed the tall silent door-wardens and entered the cool echoing shadows of the house of st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>.</p>
<p>They walked down a paved passage, long and empty, and as they went <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> spoke softly to <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q>'Be careful of your words, Master <name type="PERSON">Pereg<name type="GPE">ri</name>n</name>! This is no time for hobbit pertness. Th�oden is a kindly old man. <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name> is of another sort, proud and subtle, a man of far greater lineage and power, though he is not called a king. But he will speak most to you, and question you much, since you can tell him of his son <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>. He loved him greatly: too much perhaps; and the more so because they were unlike. But under cover of this love he will think it easier to learn what he witches from you rather than from me. Do not tell him more than you need, and leave quiet the matter of <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s errand. I will deal with that in due time. And say nothing about <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> either, unless you must.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Why not? What is wrong with <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>?'</q> <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> whispered. <q><name type="CARDINAL">'He</name> meant to come here, didn't he? And he'll be ar<name type="GPE">ri</name>ving soon himself anyway.'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="DATE">May</name>be, maybe,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'Though if he comes, it is likely to be in some way that no <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> expects, not even <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name>. It will be better so. At least he should come unheralded by us.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> halted before a tall door of polished metal. <q>'See, Master <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>, there is no time to instruct you now in the history of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>; though it might have been better, if you had learned something of it, when you were still birds-nesting and playing truant in the woods of the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>. Do as I bid! It is scarcely wise when b<name type="GPE">ri</name>nging the news of the death of his heir to a mighty lord to speak over much of the coming of <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> who will, if he comes, claim the kingship. Is that enough?'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Kin</name>gship?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> amazed.</p>
<p><q>'Yes,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'If you have walked <name type="DATE">all these <name type="DATE">day</name>s</name> with closed ears and mind asleep, wake up now!'</q> He knocked on the door.</p>
<p>The door opened, but no <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> could be seen to open it. <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> looked into a great hall. It was lit by deep windows in the wide aisles at either side, beyond the rows of tall pillars that upheld the roof. Monoliths of black <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ble, they rose to great capitals carved in many strange figures of beasts and leaves; and far above in shadow the wide vaulting gleamed with dull gold, inset with flowing trace<name type="GPE">ri</name>es of many colours. No hangings nor sto<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed webs, nor any things of woven stuff or of wood, were to be seen in that long solemn hall; but between the pillars there stood a silent company of tall images g<name type="PERSON">raven</name> in cold st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>.</p>
<p>Suddenly <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> was reminded of the hewn rocks of <name type="PERSON">Argonath</name>, and awe fell on him, as he looked down that avenue of kings long dead. At the far end upon a dais of many steps was set a high thr<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> under a canopy of <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ble shaped like a crowned helm; behind it was carved upon the wall and set with gems an image of a tree in flower. But the thr<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> was empty. At the foot of the dais, upon the lowest step which was broad and deep, there was a st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>r, black and unadorned, and on it sat an old man gazing at his lap. In his hand was a white rod with a golden knob. He did not look up. Solemnly they paced the long floor towards him, until they stood <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> paces from his footstool. Then <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> spoke.</p>
<p><q><name type="PERSON">'Hail</name>, <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd and <name type="ORG">Steward</name> of Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name>, <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name> son of <name type="ORG">Ecthelion</name>! I am come with counsel and tidings in this dark <name type="TIME">hour</name>.'</q></p>
<p>Then the old man looked up. <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> saw his <name type="PERSON">carven</name> face with its proud b<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s and skin like ivory, and the long curved nose between the dark deep eyes; and he was reminded not so much of <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> as of <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'Dark indeed is the <name type="TIME">hour</name>,'</q> said the old man, <q>'and at such times you are wont to come, <name type="LOC">Mithrandir</name>. But though all the signs <name type="PERSON">forebode</name> that the doom of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> is drawing nigh, less now to me is that darkness than my own darkness. It has been told to me that you b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng with you <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> who saw my son die. Is this he?'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'It</name> is,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q><name type="CARDINAL">'<name type="CARDINAL">One</name></name> of the t<name type="PERSON">wain</name>. The other is with Th�oden of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> and may come hereafter. <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>flings they are, as you see, yet this is not he of whom the omens spoke.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'Yet</name> a <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>fling still,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name> g<name type="GPE">ri</name>mly, <q>'and little love do I bear the name, since those accursed words came to trouble our counsels and drew away my son on the wild errand to his death. My <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>! Now we have need of you. <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name> should have g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> in his stead.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="CARDINAL">'He</name> would have g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'Be not unjust in your g<name type="GPE">ri</name>ef! <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> claimed the errand and would not suffer any other to have it. He was a masterful man, and <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> to take what he desired. I journeyed far with him and learned much of his mood. But you speak of his death. You have had news of that ere we came?'</q></p>
<p><q>'I have received this,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name>, and laying down his rod he lifted from his lap the thing that he had been gazing at. In each hand he held up <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> of a great horn cloven through the middle: a wild-ox horn bound with silver.</p>
<p><q>'That is the horn that <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> always wore!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>.</p>
<p><q>'Ve<name type="GPE">ri</name>ly,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name>. <q><name type="PERSON">'And</name> in my turn I bore it, and so did each eldest son of our house, far back into <name type="DATE">the vanished <name type="DATE">year</name>s</name> before the failing of the kings, since <name type="PERSON">Vorondil</name> father of <name type="GPE">Mardil</name> hunted the wild kine of <name type="PRODUCT">Araw</name> in the far fields of Rh�n. I heard it blowing dim upon the northern <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ches <name type="CARDINAL">thirteen</name> <name type="DATE">day</name>s ago, and the <name type="LOC">River</name> brought it to me, broken: it will wind no more.'</q> He paused and there was a heavy silence. Suddenly he turned his black glance upon <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q>'What say you to that, <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>fling?'</q></p>
<p><q>'Thirteen, <name type="CARDINAL">thirteen</name> <name type="DATE">day</name>s,'</q> faltered <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q>'Yes, I think that would be so. Yes, I stood beside him, as he blew the horn. But no help came. Only more orcs.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="CARDINAL">'So</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name>, looking keenly at <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>'s face. <q>'You were there? Tell me more! Why did no help come? And how did you escape, and yet he did not, so mighty a man as he was, and only orcs to withstand him?'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> flushed and forgot his fear. <q>'The mightiest man may be slain by <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> arrow,'</q> he said; <q>'and <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> was pierced by many. When last I saw him he sank beside a tree and plucked a black-feathered shaft from his side. Then I swo<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>d and was made captive. I saw him no more, and know no more. But I honour his memory, for he was very valiant. He died to save us, my kinsman <name type="PERSON">Me<name type="GPE">ri</name>adoc</name> and myself, <name type="ORG">waylaid</name> in the woods by the soldiery of the Dark <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd; and though he fell and failed, my gratitude is n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> the less.'</q></p>
<p>Then <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> looked the old man in the eye, for p<name type="GPE">ri</name>de stirred strangely within him, still stung by the scorn and suspicion in that cold voice. <q>'Little service, no doubt, will so great a lord of <name type="ORG">Men</name> think to find in a hobbit, a <name type="CARDINAL">half</name>ling from the northern <name type="LOC">Shire</name>; yet such as it is, I will offer it, in payment of my debt.'</q> Twit<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g aside his grey cloak, <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> drew forth his small sword and laid it at <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name>'s feet.</p>
<p>A pale smile, like a gleam of cold sun on a <name type="DATE">winter</name>'s <name type="TIME">evening</name>, passed over the old man's face; but he bent his head and held out his hand, laying the shards of the horn aside. <q>'Give me the weapon!'</q> he said.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> lifted it and presented the hilt to him. <q>'Whence came this?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name>. <q>'Many, <name type="DATE">many <name type="DATE">year</name>s</name> lie on it. Surely this is a blade wrought by our own kindred in the <name type="LOC">North</name> in the deep past?'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'It</name> came out of the mounds that lie on the borders of my country ' said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. 'But only evil wights dwell there now, and I will not willingly tell more of them.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I see that strange tales are woven about you,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name>, <q>'and once again it is shown that looks may belie the man � or the <name type="CARDINAL">half</name>ling. I accept your service. For you are not daunted by words; and you have courteous speech, strange though the sound of it may be to us in the <name type="LOC">South</name>. And we shall have need of all folk of courtesy, be they great or small, in the <name type="DATE">day</name>s to come. Swear to me now!'</q></p>
<p><q>'Take the hilt,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, <q>'and speak after the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd, if you are resolved on this.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I am,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>.</p>
<p>The old man laid the sword along his lap, and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> put his hand to the hilt, and said slowly after <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name>:</p>
<p><q><name type="CARDINAL">'He</name>re do I swear fealty and service to <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>, and to the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd and <name type="ORG">Steward</name> of the realm, to speak and to be silent, to do and to let be, to come and to go, in need or plenty, in peace or war, in living or dying, from this <name type="TIME">hour</name> henceforth, until my lord release me, or death take me, or the world end. So say I, <name type="PERSON">Pereg<name type="GPE">ri</name>n</name> son of <name type="PERSON">Paladin</name> of the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> of the <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>flings.'</q></p>
<p>And this do I hear, <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name> son of <name type="ORG">Ecthelion</name>, <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>, <name type="ORG">Steward</name> of the High <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g, and I will not forget it, nor fail to reward that which is given: fealty with love, valour with honour, oath-breaking with vengeance.' Then <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> received back his sword and put it in its sheath.</p>
<p><q><name type="PERSON">'And</name> now,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name>, <q>'my <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> command to you: speak and be not silent! Tell me your full tale, and see that you recall all that you can of <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>, my son. Sit now and begin!'</q> As he spoke he struck a small silver gong that stood near his footstool, and at once servants came forward. <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> saw then that they had been standing in alcoves on either side of the door, unseen as he and <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> entered.</p>
<p><q>'B<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng wine and food and seats for the guests,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name>, <q>'and see that n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> trouble us for <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> <name type="TIME">hour</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'It</name> is all that I have to spare, for there is much else to heed,'</q> he said to <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'Much of more import, it may seem, and yet to me less pressing. But maybe we can speak again at the end of the <name type="DATE">day</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="PERSON">'And</name> earlier, it is to be hoped,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'For I have not <name type="GPE">ri</name>dden hither from <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard, <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name> and <name type="CARDINAL">fifty</name> leagues, with the speed of wind, only to b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng you <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> small war<name type="GPE">ri</name>or, however courteous. Is it naught to you that Th�oden has fought a great battle and that <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard is overthrown, and that I have broken the staff of <name type="ORG">Saruman</name>?'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'It</name> is much to me. But I know already sufficient of these deeds for my own counsel against the menace of the <name type="LOC">East</name>.'</q> He turned his dark eyes on <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, and now <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> saw a likeness between the <name type="CARDINAL">two</name>, and he felt the strain between them, almost as if he saw a line of smoulde<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng fire, drawn from eye to eye, that might suddenly burst into flame.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Denethor</name> looked indeed much more like a great wizard than <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> did, more kingly, beautiful, and powerful; and older. Yet by a sense other than sight <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> perceived that <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> had the greater power and the deeper wisdom, and a majesty that was veiled. And he was older, far older. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w much older?'</q> he wondered, and then he thought how odd it was that he had never thought about it before. <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard had said something about wizards, but even then he had not thought of <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> as <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of them. What was <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>? In what far time and place did he come into the world, and when would he leave it? And then his musings broke off, and he saw that <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name> and <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> still looked each other in the eye, as if reading the other's mind. But it was <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name> who <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> withdrew his gaze.</p>
<p><q>'Yea,'</q> he said; <q>'for though the <name type="ORG">St<name type="CARDINAL">one</name></name>s be lost, they say, still the lords of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> have keener sight than lesser men, and many messages come to them. But sit now!'</q></p>
<p>Then men came bea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng a c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>r and a low stool, and <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> brought a salver with a silver flagon and cups, and white cakes. <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> sat down, but he could not take his eyes from the old lord. Was it so, or had he only imagined it, that as he spoke of the <name type="ORG">St<name type="CARDINAL">one</name></name>s a sudden gleam of his eye had glanced upon <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>'s face?</p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'No</name>w tell me your tale, my liege,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name>, <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> kindly; <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> mockingly. <q>'For the words of <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> whom my son so bef<name type="GPE">ri</name>ended will be welcome indeed.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> never forgot that <name type="TIME">hour</name> in the great hall under the piercing eye of the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>, stabbed ever and anon by his shrewd questions, and all the while conscious of <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> at his side, wat<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g and lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing, and (so <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> felt) holding in check a <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing wrath and impatience. When the <name type="TIME">hour</name> was over and <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name> again rang the gong, <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> felt worn out. <q><name type="DATE">'It</name> cannot be <name type="TIME">more than <name type="CARDINAL">nine</name> o'clock</name>,'</q> he thought. <q>'I could now eat <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> breakfasts on end.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Lead the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd <name type="LOC">Mithrandir</name> to the housing prepared for him,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name>, 'and his companion may lodge with him for the present, if he will. But be it known that I have now sworn him to my service, and he shall be known as <name type="PERSON">Pereg<name type="GPE">ri</name>n</name> son of <name type="PERSON">Paladin</name> and taught the lesser pass-words. Send word to the Captains that they shall wait on me here, as soon as may be after the <name type="ORDINAL">third</name> <name type="TIME">hour</name> has rung.</p>
<p><q><name type="PERSON">'And</name> you, my <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd <name type="LOC">Mithrandir</name>, shall come too, as and when you will. N<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> shall hinder your coming to me at any time, save only in my b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ef <name type="TIME">hour</name>s of sleep. Let your wrath at an old man's folly run off and then return to my comfort!'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Folly</name>?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Nay</name>, my lord, when you are a dotard you will die. You can use even your g<name type="GPE">ri</name>ef as a cloak. Do you think that I do not understand your purpose in questioning for <name type="TIME">an <name type="TIME">hour</name></name> <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> who knows the least, while I sit by?'</q></p>
<p><q>'If you understand it, then be con<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>t,'</q> returned <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name>. <q>'P<name type="GPE">ri</name>de would be folly that disdained help and counsel at need; but you deal out such gifts according to your own designs. Yet the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> is not to be made the tool of other men's purposes, however worthy. And to him there is no purpose higher in the world as it now stands than the good of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>; and the rule of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>, my lord, is mine and no other man's, unless the king should come again.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Unless the king should come again?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'Well, my lord <name type="ORG">Steward</name>, it is your task to keep some kingdom still against that event, which few now look to see. In that task you shall have all the aid that you are pleased to ask for. But I will say this: the rule of no realm is mine, neither of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> nor any other, great or small. But all worthy things that are in pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>l as the world now stands, those are my care. And for my part, I shall not wholly fail of my task, though <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> should pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>sh, if anything passes through this <name type="TIME">night</name> that can still grow fair or bear fruit and flower again in <name type="DATE">day</name>s to come. For I also am a steward. Did you not know?'</q> And with that he turned and strode from the hall with <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> running at his side.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> did not look at <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> or speak a word to him as they went. Their guide brought them from the doors of the hall, and then led them across <name type="ORG">the Court of the Fountain</name> into a lane between tall buildings of st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. After several turns they came to a house close to the wall of the citadel upon the north side, not far from the shoulder that linked the <name type="ORG">hill</name> with the mountain. Within, upon the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> floor above the street, up a wide <name type="PERSON">carven</name> stair, he showed them to a fair room, light and airy, with goodly hangings of dull gold sheen unfigured. It was sparely furnished, having but a small table, <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>rs and a bench; but at either side there were curtained alcoves and well-clad beds within with vessels and basins for washing. There were <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> high narrow windows that looked northward over the great curve of <name type="GPE">Anduin</name>, still shrouded in mists, towards the <name type="ORG">Emyn Muil</name> and <name type="PERSON">Rauros</name> far away. <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> had to climb on the bench to look out over the deep st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> sill.</p>
<p><q>'Are you angry with me, <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>?'</q> he said, as their guide went out and closed the door. <q>'I did the best I could.'</q></p>
<p><q>'You did indeed!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, laughing suddenly; and he came and stood beside <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>, putting his arm about the hobbit's shoulders and gazing out of the window. <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> glanced in some wonder at the face now close beside his own, for the sound of that laugh had been gay and merry. Yet in the wizard's face he saw at <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> only lines of care and sorrow; though as he looked more in<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>tly he perceived that under all there was a great joy: a fountain of mirth enough to set a kingdom laughing, were it to gush forth.</p>
<p><q>'Indeed you did your best,'</q> said the wizard; 'and I hope that it may be long before you find yourself in such a tight corner again <name type="CARDINAL">between <name type="CARDINAL">two</name></name> such ter<name type="GPE">ri</name>ble old men. Still the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> learned more from you than you may have guessed, <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. You could not hide the fact that <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> did not lead the <name type="ORG">Company</name> from <name type="GPE">Mo<name type="GPE">ri</name>a</name>, and that there was <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> among you of high honour who was coming to Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name>; and that he had a famous sword. <name type="ORG">Men</name> think much about the sto<name type="GPE">ri</name>es of old <name type="DATE">day</name>s in <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>; and <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name> has given long thought to the rhyme and to the words _<name type="ORG">Isildur</name>'s <name type="PERSON">Bane</name>_, since <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> went away.</p>
<p><name type="CARDINAL">'He</name> is not as other men of this time, <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>, and whatever be his descent from father to son, by some chance the blood of <name type="LOC">West</name>ernesse runs nearly true in him; as it does in his other son, <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name>, and yet did not in <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> whom he loved best. He has long sight. He can perceive, if he bends his will thither, much of what is passing in the minds of men, even of those that dwell far off. It is difficult to deceive him, and dangerous to try.</p>
<p><q>'Remember that! For you are now sworn to his service. I do not know what put it into your head, or your heart, to do that. But it was well d<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. I did not hinder it, for generous deed should not be checked by cold counsel. It touched his heart, as well (may I say it) as pleasing his humour. And at least you are free now to move about as you will in Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name> � when you are not on duty. For there is another side to it. You are at his command; and he will not forget. Be wary still!'</q></p>
<p>He fell silent and sighed. <q>'Well, no need to brood on what to<name type="DATE">morrow</name> may b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng. For <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> thing, to<name type="DATE">morrow</name> will be certain to b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng worse than to<name type="DATE">day</name>, for many <name type="DATE">day</name>s to come. And there is nothing more that I can do to help it. The board is set, and the pieces are moving. <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> piece that I greatly desire to find is <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name>, now the heir of <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name>. I do not think that he is in the <name type="LOC">City</name>; but I have had no time to gather news. I must go. <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. I must go to this lords' council and learn what I can. But the Enemy has the move, and he is about to open his full game. And pawns are likely to see as much of it as any, <name type="PERSON">Pereg<name type="GPE">ri</name>n</name> son of <name type="PERSON">Paladin</name>, soldier of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>. <name type="ORG">Sharp</name>en your blade!'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> went to the door, and there he turned. <q>'I am in haste <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>,'</q> he said. <q>'Do me a favour when you go out. Even before you rest, if you are not too weary. Go and find <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>fax and see how he is housed. These people are kindly to beasts, for they are a good and wise folk, but they have less skill with horses than some.'</q></p>
<p>With that <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> went out; and as he did so, there came the note of a clear sweet bell <name type="GPE">ri</name>nging in a tower of the citadel. <name type="PERSON">Thr</name>ee strokes it rang, like silver in the air, and ceased: the <name type="ORDINAL">third</name> <name type="TIME">hour</name> from the <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing of the sun.</p>
<p>After <name type="TIME">a minute</name> <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> went to the door and down the stair and looked about the street. The sun was now shining warm and b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght, and the towers and tall houses cast long clear-cut shadows westward. High in the blue air Mount <name type="GPE">Min<name type="PERSON">dol</name>luin</name> lifted its white helm and snowy cloak. Armed men went to and fro in the ways of the <name type="LOC">City</name>, as if going at the st<name type="GPE">ri</name>king of the <name type="TIME">hour</name> to changes of post and duty.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="CARDINAL">Nine</name> o'clock we'd call it in the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> aloud to himself. <q>'Just the time for a nice breakfast by the open window in sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng sunshine. And how I should like breakfast! Do these people ever have it, or is it over? And when do they have dinner, and where?'</q></p>
<p>Presently he noticed a man, clad in black and white, coming along the narrow street from the centre of the citadel towards him. <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> felt l<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>ly and made up his mind to speak as the man passed; but he had no need. The man came straight <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name> him.</p>
<p><q>'You are <name type="PERSON">Pereg<name type="GPE">ri</name>n</name> the <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>fling?'</q> he said. 'I am told that you have been sworn to the service of the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd and of the <name type="LOC">City</name>. Welcome! He held out his hand and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> took it.</p>
<p><q>'I am named <name type="PERSON">Beregond</name> son of <name type="GPE">Baranor</name>. I have no duty this <name type="TIME">morning</name>, and I have been sent to you to teach you the pass-words, and to tell you some of the many things that no doubt you will wish to know. And for my part, I would learn of you also. For never before have we seen a <name type="CARDINAL">half</name>ling in this land and though we have heard rumour of them, little is said of them in any tale that we know. Moreover you are a f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end of <name type="LOC">Mithrandir</name>. Do you know him well?'</q></p>
<p><q>'Well,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q>'I have known _of_ him all my short life, as you might say; and lately I have travelled far with him. But there is much to read in that book, and I cannot claim to have seen more than a page or <name type="CARDINAL">two</name>. Yet perhaps I know him as well as any but a few. <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> was the only <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of our <name type="ORG">Company</name>, I think, who really knew him.'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Beregond</name>. <q><name type="CARDINAL">'Who</name> is he?'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'Oh</name>,'</q> stammered <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>, <q>'he was a man who went about with us. I think he is in <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> now.'</q></p>
<p><q>'You have been in <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>, I hear. There is much that I would ask you of that land also; for we put much of what little hope we have in its people. But I am forgetting my errand, which was <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> to answer what you would ask. What would you know, Master <name type="PERSON">Pereg<name type="GPE">ri</name>n</name>?'</q></p>
<p><q>'Er well,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>, <q>'if I may venture to say so, rather a burning question in my mind at present is, well, what about breakfast and all that? I mean, what are the meal-times, if you understand me, and where is the dining-room, if there is <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>? And the inns? I looked, but never a <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> could I see as we rode up, though I had been borne up by the hope of a draught of ale as soon as we came to the homes of wise and courtly men.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Beregond</name> looked at him gravely. <q>'An old campaigner, I see,'</q> he said. <q>'They say that men who go war<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng afield look ever to the next hope of food and of d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk; though I am not a travelled man myself. Then you have not yet ea<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> to<name type="DATE">day</name>?'</q></p>
<p><q>'Well, yes, to speak in courtesy, yes,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q>'But no more than a cup of wine and a white cake or <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> by the kindness of your lord; but he racked me for it with <name type="TIME">an <name type="TIME">hour</name></name> of questions, and that is hungry work.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Beregond</name> laughed. <q><name type="CARDINAL">'At</name> the table small men may do the greater deeds, we say. But you have broken your fast as well as any man in the <name type="ORG">Citadel</name>, and with greater honour. This is a fortress and a tower of guard and is now in posture of war. We <name type="GPE">ri</name>se ere the <name type="ORG">Sun</name>, and take a morsel in the grey light, and go to our duties at the opening <name type="TIME">hour</name>. But do not despair!'</q> He laughed again, seeing the dismay in <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>'s face. <name type="PERSON">'Those</name> who have had heavy duty take somewhat to refresh their strength in the <name type="TIME">mid-<name type="TIME">morning</name></name>. Then there is the <name type="LOC">nuncheon</name>, at <name type="TIME">noon</name> or after as duties allow; and men gather for the <name type="DATE">day</name>meal, and such mirth as there still may be, <name type="TIME">about the <name type="TIME">hour</name></name> of sunset.</p>
<p><q><name type="WORK_OF_ART">'<name type="WORK_OF_ART">Come</name></name>! We will walk a little and then go find us some refreshment, and eat and d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk on the battlement, and survey the fair <name type="TIME">morning</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="CARDINAL">'<name type="CARDINAL">One</name></name> moment!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> blushing. <q>'Greed, or hunger by your courtesy, put it out of my mind. But <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, <name type="LOC">Mithrandir</name> as you call him, asked me to see to his horse � <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>fax, a great <name type="PERSON">steed</name> of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>, and the apple of the king's eye, I am told, though he has given him to <name type="LOC">Mithrandir</name> for his services. I think his new master loves the beast better than he loves many men, and if his good will is of any value to this city, you will treat <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>fax with all honour: with greater kindness than you have treated this hobbit, if it is possible.'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbit?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Beregond</name>.</p>
<p><q>'That is what we call ourselves,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>.</p>
<p><q>'I am glad to learn it,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Beregond</name>, <q>'for now I may say that strange accents do not <name type="PERSON">mar</name> fair speech, and hobbits are a fair-spoken folk. But come! You shall make me acquainted with this good horse. I love beasts, and we see them seldom in this stony city; for my people came from the mountain-<name type="GPE">vale</name>s, and before that from <name type="ORG">Ithil</name>ien. But fear not! The visit shall be short, a mere call of courtesy, and we will go thence to the butte<name type="GPE">ri</name>es.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> found that <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>fax had been well housed and <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ded. For in the <name type="CARDINAL">six</name>th circle, outside the walls of the citadel, there were some fair stables where a few swift horses were kept, hard by the lodgings of the errand-<name type="GPE">ri</name>ders of the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd: messengers always ready to go at the urgent command of <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name> or his chief captains. But now all the horses and the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ders were out and away.</p>
<p><name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>fax whinnied as <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> entered the stable and turned his head. <q><name type="CARDINAL">'Go</name>od <name type="TIME">morning</name>!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q><name type="ORG">'<name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name></name> will come as soon as he may. He is busy, but he sends greetings, and I am to see that all is well with you; and you resting, I hope, after your long labours.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>fax tossed his head and stamped. But he allowed <name type="PERSON">Beregond</name> to handle his head gently and stroke his great flanks.</p>
<p><q><name type="CARDINAL">'He</name> looks as if he were spoiling for a race, and not newly come from a great journey,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Beregond</name>. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w strong and proud he is! Where is his harness? It should be <name type="GPE">ri</name>ch and fair.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'No</name>ne is <name type="GPE">ri</name>ch and fair enough for him,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q><name type="CARDINAL">'He</name> will have n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. If he will consent to bear you, bear you he does; and if not, well, no bit, b<name type="GPE">ri</name>dle, whip, or thong will tame him. <name type="PERSON">Farewell</name>, <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>fax! Have patience. <name type="PERSON">Battle</name> is coming.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>fax lifted up his head and neighed, so that the stable shook, and they covered their ears. Then they took their leave, seeing that the manger was well filled.</p>
<p><q><name type="PERSON">'And</name> now for our manger,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Beregond</name>, and he led <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> back to the citadel, and so to a door in the north side of the great tower. There they went down a long cool stair into a wide alley lit with lamps. There were hatches in the walls at the side, and <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of these was open.</p>
<p><q>'This is the storehouse and buttery of my company of the <name type="ORG">Guard</name>.'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Beregond</name>. <q>'Greetings, <name type="PERSON">Targon</name>!'</q> he called through the hatch. <q><name type="DATE">'It</name> is early yet, but here is a newcomer that the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd has taken into his service. He has <name type="GPE">ri</name>dden long and far with a tight belt, and has had sore labour this <name type="TIME">morning</name>, and he is hungry. Give us what you have!'</q></p>
<p>They got there bread, and butter, and cheese and apples: the last of <name type="DATE">the <name type="DATE">winter</name></name> store, w<name type="GPE">ri</name>nkled but sound and sweet; and a leather flagon of new-drawn ale, and wooden platters and cups. They put all into a wicker basket and climbed back into the sun; and <name type="PERSON">Beregond</name> brought <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> to a place at the east end of the great out-thrust battlement where there was an embrasure in the walls with a st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> seat beneath the sill. From there they could look out on the <name type="TIME">morning</name> over the world.</p>
<p>They ate and drank; and they talked now of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> and its ways and cus<name type="PERSON">tom</name>s, now of the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> and the strange count<name type="GPE">ri</name>es that <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> had seen. And ever as they talked <name type="PERSON">Beregond</name> was more amazed, and looked with greater wonder at the hobbit, swinging his short legs as he sat on the seat, or standing tiptoe upon it to peer over the sill at the lands below.</p>
<p><q>'I will not hide from you, Master <name type="PERSON">Pereg<name type="GPE">ri</name>n</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Beregond</name>, <q>'that to us you look almost as <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of our children, a lad of <name type="CARDINAL">nine</name> <name type="DATE">summer</name>s or so; and yet you have endured pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ls and seen <name type="PERSON">mar</name>vels that few of our greybeards could boast of. I thought it was the whim of our <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd to take him a noble page, after the manner of the kings of old, they say. But I see that it is not so, and you must pardon my foolishness.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I do,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q>'Though you are not far wrong. I am still little more than a boy in the reckoning of my own people, and it will be <name type="CARDINAL">four</name> <name type="DATE">year</name>s yet before I "come of age", as we say in the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>: But do not bother about me. <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Come</name> and look and tell me what I can see.'</q></p>
<p>The sun was now climbing, and the mists in the <name type="GPE">vale</name> below had been drawn up. The last of them were floating away, just overhead, as wisps of white cloud borne on the stif<name type="PERSON">fen</name>ing breeze from the <name type="LOC">East</name>, that was now flapping and tugging the flags and white standards of the citadel. Away down in the valley-bot<name type="PERSON">tom</name>, <name type="CARDINAL">five</name> leagues or so as the eye leaps, the <name type="LOC">Great <name type="LOC">River</name></name> could now be seen grey and glitte<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng, coming out of the north-west, and bending in a mighty sweep south and west again, till it was lost to view in a haze and shimmer, far beyond which lay the <name type="LOC">Sea</name> <name type="CARDINAL">fifty</name> leagues away.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> could see all the <name type="ORG">Pelennor</name> laid out before him, dotted into the distance with farmsteads and little walls, barns and <name type="ORG">byre</name>s, but nowhere could he see any kine or other beasts. Many roads and tracks crossed the green fields, and there was much coming and going: <name type="PERSON">wain</name>s moving in lines towards the Great <name type="FAC">Gate</name>, and others passing out. Now and again a horseman would <name type="GPE">ri</name>de up, and leap from the saddle and has<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> into the <name type="LOC">City</name>. But most of the traffic went out along the chief highway, and that turned south, and then bending swifter than the <name type="LOC">River</name> skirted the <name type="ORG">hill</name>s and passed soon from sight. It was wide and well-paved, and along its eastern edge ran a broad green <name type="GPE">ri</name>ding-track, and beyond that a wall. On the <name type="GPE">ri</name>de horsemen galloped to and fro, but all the street seemed to be choked with great covered <name type="PERSON">wain</name>s going south. But soon <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> saw that all was in fact well-ordered: the <name type="PERSON">wain</name>s were moving in <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> lines, <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> swifter drawn by horses; another slower, great waggons with fair housings of many colours, drawn by oxen; and along the west <name type="GPE">ri</name>m of the road many smaller carts hauled by trudging men.</p>
<p><q>'That is the road to the <name type="GPE">vale</name>s of <name type="GPE">Tumladen</name> and <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ssarnach, and the mountain-villages, and then on to <name type="ORG">Lebennin</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Beregond</name>. <q>'There go the last of the <name type="PERSON">wain</name>s that bear away to refuge the aged the children, and the women that must go with them. They must all be g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> from the <name type="FAC">Gate</name> and the road clear for a league before <name type="TIME">noon</name>: that was the order. It is a sad necessity.'</q> He sighed. <q>'Few, maybe, of those now sundered will meet again. And there were always too few children in this city; but now there are n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>-save some young lads that will not depart, and may find some task to do: my own son is <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of them.'</q></p>
<p>They fell silent for a while. <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> gazed anxiously eastward, as if at any moment he might see <name type="CARDINAL">thousands</name> of orcs pou<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng over the fields. <q>'What can I see there?'</q> he asked, pointing down to the middle of the great curve of the <name type="GPE">Anduin</name>. <q>'Is that another city, or what is it?'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'It</name> was a city,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Beregond</name>, <q>'the chief city of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>, of which this was only a fortress. For that is the ruin of <name type="NORP">Osgiliath</name> on either side of <name type="GPE">Anduin</name>, which our enemies took and burned <name type="DATE">long ago</name>. Yet we won it back in the <name type="DATE">day</name>s of the youth of <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name>: not to dwell in, but to hold as an outpost, and to rebuild the b<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge for the passage of our arms. And then came the Fell <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s out of Minas <name type="PERSON">Morgul</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q>'The <name type="ORG">Black</name> <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>, opening his eyes, and they were wide and dark with an old fear re-awakened.</p>
<p><q>'Yes, they were black,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Beregond</name>, <q>'and I see that you know something of them, though you have not spoken of them in any of your tales.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I know of them,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> softly, <q>'but I will not speak of them now, so near, so near.'</q> He broke off and lifted his eyes above the <name type="LOC">River</name>, and it seemed to him that all he could see was a vast and threa<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing shadow. Perhaps it was mountains looming on the verge of sight, their jagged edges sof<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed by wellnigh <name type="CARDINAL">twenty</name> leagues of <name type="ORG">misty air</name>; perhaps it was but a cloud-wall, and beyond that again a yet deeper gloom. But even as he looked it seemed to his eyes that the gloom was growing and gathe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng, very slowly, slowly <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing to smother the regions of the sun.</p>
<p><q><name type="CARDINAL">'So</name> near to <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Beregond</name> quietly. <q>'Yes, there it lies. We seldom name it; but we have dwelt ever in sight of that shadow: sometimes it seems fainter and more distant; sometimes nearer and darker. It is growing and darkening now; and therefore our fear and disquiet grow too. And the Fell <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s, less than <name type="DATE">a <name type="DATE">year</name></name> ago they won back the crossings, and many of our best men were slain. <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> it was that drove the enemy at last back from this western shore, and we hold still the near <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> of <name type="NORP">Osgiliath</name>. For a little while. But we await now a new onslaught there. <name type="DATE">May</name>be the chief onslaught of the war that comes.'</q></p>
<p><q>'When?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q>'Have you a guess? For I saw the beacons <name type="TIME">last <name type="TIME">night</name></name> and the errand-<name type="GPE">ri</name>ders; and <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> said that it was a sign that war had begun. He seemed in a desperate hurry. But now everything seems to have slowed up again.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Only because everything is now ready,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Beregond</name>. <q><name type="DATE">'It</name> is but the deep breath before the plunge.'</q></p>
<p><q>'But why were the beacons lit <name type="TIME">last <name type="TIME">night</name></name>?'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'It</name> is over-late to send for aid when you are already besieged,'</q> answered <name type="PERSON">Beregond</name>. 'But I do not know the counsel of the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd and his captains. They have many ways of gathe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng news. And the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name> is unlike other men: he sees far. Some say that as he sits al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> in his high chamber in the <name type="FAC">Tower</name> at <name type="TIME">night</name>, and bends his thought this way and that, he can read somewhat of the future; and that he will at times search even the mind of the Enemy, wrestling with him. And so it is that he is old, worn before his time. But however that may be, my lord <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name> is abroad, beyond the <name type="LOC">River</name> on some pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>lous errand, and he may have sent tidings.</p>
<p>'But if you would know what I think set the beacons ablaze, it was the news that came yestereve out of <name type="ORG">Lebennin</name>. There is a great fleet drawing near to the mouths of <name type="GPE">Anduin</name>, manned by the corsairs of <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Umbar</name> in the <name type="LOC">South</name>. They have long ceased to fear the might of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>, and they have allied them with the Enemy, and now make a heavy stroke in his cause. For this attack will draw off much of the help that we looked to have from <name type="ORG">Lebennin</name> and <name type="PERSON">Belfalas</name>, where folk are hardy and numerous. All the more do our thoughts go north to <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>; and the more glad are we for these tidings of victory that you b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">'And</name> yet' � he paused and stood up, and looked round, north, east, and south � 'the doings at <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard should warn us that we are caught now in a great net and strategy. This is no longer a bicke<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng at the <name type="ORG">ford</name>s, raiding from <name type="ORG">Ithil</name>ien and from <name type="PERSON">An�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en</name>, am<name type="PERSON">bush</name>ing and pillaging. This is a great war long-planned, and we are but <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> piece in it, whatever p<name type="GPE">ri</name>de may say. Things move in the far <name type="LOC">East</name> beyond the Inland <name type="LOC">Sea</name>, it is reported; and north in <name type="GPE">Mirkwood</name> and beyond; and south in <name type="ORG">Harad</name>. And now all realms shall be put to the test, to stand, or fall � under the <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>.</p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'Yet</name>, Master <name type="PERSON">Pereg<name type="GPE">ri</name>n</name>, we have this honour: ever we bear the brunt of the chief hatred of the Dark <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd, for that hatred comes down out of the depths of time and over the deeps of the <name type="LOC">Sea</name>. Here will the hammer-stroke fall hardest. And for that reason <name type="LOC">Mithrandir</name> came hither in such haste. For if we fall, who shall stand? And, Master <name type="PERSON">Pereg<name type="GPE">ri</name>n</name>, do you see any hope that we shall stand?'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> did not answer. He looked at the great walls, and the towers and brave banners, and the sun in the high sky, and then at the gathe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng gloom in the <name type="LOC">East</name>; and he thought of the long fingers of that <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>: of the orcs in the woods and the mountains, the treason of <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard, the birds of evil eye, and the <name type="ORG">Black</name> <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s even in the lanes of the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> � and of the winged terror, <name type="FAC">the Nazg�l.</name> He shuddered, and hope seemed to wither. And even at that moment the sun for a <name type="ORG">sec</name>ond faltered and was obscured, as though a dark wing had passed across it. Almost beyond hea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng he thought he caught, high and far up in the heavens, a cry: faint, but heart-quelling, cruel and cold. He blanched and cowered against the wall.</p>
<p><q>'What was that?'</q> asked <name type="PERSON">Beregond</name>. <q>'You also felt something?'</q></p>
<p><q>'Yes,'</q> muttered <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q><name type="DATE">'It</name> is the sign of our fall, and the shadow of doom, a Fell <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name> of the air.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Yes, the shadow of doom,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Beregond</name>. <q>'I fear that Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name> shall fall. Night comes. The very warmth of my blood seems stolen away.'</q></p>
<p>For a time they sat together with bowed heads and did not speak. Then suddenly <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> looked up and saw that the sun was still shining and the banners still streaming in the breeze. He shook himself. <q><name type="DATE">'It</name> is passed,'</q> he said. <q><name type="DATE">'No</name>, my heart will not yet despair. <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> fell and has returned and is with us. We may stand, if only on <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> leg, or at least be left still upon our knees.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Rightly said!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Beregond</name>, <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing and st<name type="GPE">ri</name>ding to and fro. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Nay</name>, though all things must come utterly to an end in time, <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> shall not pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>sh yet. Not though the walls be taken by a reckless foe that will build a <name type="ORG">hill</name> of car<name type="GPE">ri</name>on before them. There are still other fastnesses, and <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret ways of escape into the mountains. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>pe and memory shall live still in some hidden valley where the grass is green.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="PERSON">'All</name> the same, I wish it was over for good or ill.'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q>'I am no war<name type="GPE">ri</name>or at all and dislike any thought of battle; but waiting on the edge of <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> that I can't escape is worst of all. What <name type="DATE">a long <name type="DATE">day</name></name> it seems already! I should be happier, if we were not obliged to stand and watch, making no move, st<name type="GPE">ri</name>king nowhere <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>. No stroke would have been struck in <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>, I think, but for <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Ah, there you lay your finger on the sore that many feel!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Beregond</name>. <q>'But things may change when <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name> returns. He is bold, more bold than many deem; for in these <name type="DATE">day</name>s men are slow to believe that a captain can be wise and learned in the scrolls of lore and song, as he is, and yet a man of <name type="PERSON">hardihood</name> and swift judgement in the field. But such is <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name>. Less reckless and eager than <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>, but not less resolute. Yet what indeed can he do? We cannot assault the mountains of � of yonder realm. Our reach is shor<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed, and we cannot st<name type="GPE">ri</name>ke till some foe comes within it. Then our hand must be heavy!'</q> He smote the hilt of his sword.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> looked at him: tall and proud and noble, as all the men that he had yet seen in that land; and with a glitter in his eye as he thought of the battle. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Alas</name>! my own hand feels as light as a feather,'</q> he thought, but he said nothing. <q>'A pawn did <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> say? Perhaps but on the wrong chessboard.'</q></p>
<p>So they talked until the sun reached its h<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name>, and suddenly the <name type="TIME">noon</name>-bells were rung, and there was a stir in the citadel; for all save the watchmen were going to their meal.</p>
<p><q>'Will you come with me?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Beregond</name>. <q>'You may join my mess for this <name type="DATE">day</name>. I do not know to what company you will be assigned; or the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd may hold you at his own command. But you will be welcome. And it will be well to meet as many men as you may, while there is yet time.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I shall be glad to come,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q>'I am l<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>ly, to tell you the truth. I left my best f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end behind in <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>, and I have had no <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> to talk to or jest with. Perhaps I could really join your company? Are you the captain? If so, you could take me on, or speak for me?'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Nay</name>, nay,'</q> <name type="PERSON">Beregond</name> laughed, <q>'I am no captain. Neither office nor rank nor lordship have I, being but a plain man of arms of the <name type="ORDINAL">Third</name> <name type="ORG">Company</name> of the <name type="ORG">Citadel</name>. Yet, Master <name type="PERSON">Pereg<name type="GPE">ri</name>n</name>, to be only a man of arms of the <name type="ORG">Guard</name> of the <name type="FAC">Tower</name> of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> is held worthy in the <name type="LOC">City</name>, and such men have honour in the land.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="ORG">'Then</name> it is far beyond me,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q>'Take me back to our room, and if <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> is not there, I will go where you like � as your guest.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> was not in the lodging and had sent no message; so <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> went with <name type="PERSON">Beregond</name> and was made known to the men of the <name type="ORDINAL">Third</name> <name type="ORG">Company</name>. And it seemed that <name type="PERSON">Beregond</name> got as much honour from it as his guest, for <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> was very welcome. There had already been much talk in the citadel about <name type="LOC">Mithrandir</name>'s companion and his long closeting with the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd; and rumour declared that a P<name type="GPE">ri</name>nce of the <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>flings had come out of the <name type="LOC">North</name> to offer allegiance to <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> and <name type="CARDINAL">five</name> thousand swords. And some said that when the <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s came from <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> each would b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng behind him a <name type="CARDINAL">half</name>ling war<name type="GPE">ri</name>or, small maybe, but doughty.</p>
<p>Though <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> had regretfully to destroy this hopeful tale, he could not be <name type="GPE">ri</name>d of his new rank, only fitting, men thought, to <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> bef<name type="GPE">ri</name>ended by <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> and honoured by the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name>; and they thanked him for coming among them, and hung on his words and sto<name type="GPE">ri</name>es of the outlands, and gave him as much food and ale as he could wish. Indeed his only trouble was to be 'wary' according to the counsel of <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, and not to let his tongue wag freely after the manner of a hobbit among f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends.</p>
<p>At length <name type="PERSON">Beregond</name> rose. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Farewell</name> for this time!'</q> he said. <q>'I have duty now till sundown, as have all the others here, I think. But if you are l<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>ly, as you say, maybe you would like a merry guide about the <name type="LOC">City</name>. My son would go with you gladly. A good lad, I may say. If that pleases you, go down to the lowest circle and ask for <name type="ORG">the Old Guesthouse</name> in <name type="FAC">the Rath Celerdain</name>, the <name type="PERSON">Lampw<name type="GPE">ri</name>ghts</name>' Street. You will find him there with other lads that are remaining in the <name type="LOC">City</name>. There may be things worth seeing down at the Great <name type="FAC">Gate</name> ere the closing.'</q></p>
<p>He went out, and soon after all the others followed. <name type="DATE">The <name type="DATE">day</name></name> was still fine, though it was growing hazy, and it was hot for <name type="DATE">March</name>, even so far southwards. <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> felt sleepy, but the lodging seemed cheerless, and he decided to go down and explore the <name type="LOC">City</name>. He took a few morsels that he had saved to <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>fax, and they were graciously accepted, though the horse seemed to have no lack. Then he walked on down many winding ways.</p>
<p>People stared much as he passed. To his face men were gravely courteous, saluting him after the manner of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> with bowed head and hands upon the breast; but behind him he heard many calls, as those out of doors c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed to others within to come and see the P<name type="GPE">ri</name>nce of the <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>flings, the companion of <name type="LOC">Mithrandir</name>. Many used some other tongue than the Common <name type="ORG">Speech</name>, but it was not long before he learned at least what was meant by _Ernil i Phe<name type="GPE">ri</name>annath_ and knew that his title had g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> down before him into the <name type="LOC">City</name>.</p>
<p>He came at last by arched streets and many fair alleys and pavements to the lowest and widest circle, and there he was directed to the <name type="PERSON">Lampw<name type="GPE">ri</name>ghts</name>' Street, a broad way running towards the Great <name type="FAC">Gate</name>. In it he found <name type="ORG">the Old Guesthouse</name>, a large building of grey weathered st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> with <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> wings running back from the street, and between them a narrow greensward, behind which was the many-windowed house, fronted along its whole width by a pillared porch and a flight of steps down on to the grass. Boys were playing among the pillars, the only children that <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> had seen in Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name>, and he stopped to look at them. Presently <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of them caught sight of him, and with a shout he sprang across the grass and came into the street, followed by several others. There he stood in front of <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>, looking him up and down.</p>
<p><q>'Greetings!'</q> said the lad. <q>'Where do you come from? You are a stranger in the <name type="LOC">City</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I was,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>; <q>'but they say I have become a man of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'Oh</name> come!'</q> said the lad. <q><name type="ORG">'Then</name> we are all men here. But how old are you, and what is your name? I am <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> <name type="DATE">year</name>s already, and shall soon be <name type="CARDINAL">five</name> feet. I am taller than you. But then my father is a <name type="ORG">Guard</name>, <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the tallest. What is your father?'</q></p>
<p><q>'Which question shall I answer <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q><name type="CARDINAL">'My</name> father farms the lands round <name type="PERSON">Whitwell</name> near <name type="GPE">Tuckborough</name> in the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>. I am nearly <name type="CARDINAL">twenty</name>-<name type="CARDINAL">nine</name>, so I pass you there; though I am but <name type="CARDINAL">four</name> feet, and not likely to grow any more, save sideways.'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="CARDINAL">Twenty</name>-<name type="CARDINAL">nine</name>!'</q> said the lad and whistled. <q>'Why, you are quite old! As old as my uncle Iorlas. Still,'</q> he added hopefully, <q>'I wager I could stand you on your head or lay you on your back.'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="DATE">May</name>be you could, if I let you,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> with a laugh. <q><name type="PERSON">'And</name> maybe I could do the same to you: we know some wrestling t<name type="GPE">ri</name>cks in my little country. Where, let me tell you, I am considered uncommonly large and strong; and I have never allowed any<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> to stand me on my head. So if it came to a t<name type="GPE">ri</name>al and nothing else would serve, I might have to kill you. For when you are older, you will learn that folk are not always what they seem; and though you may have taken me for a soft stranger-lad and easy prey, let me warn you: I am not, I am a <name type="CARDINAL">half</name>ling, hard, bold, and wicked!'</q> <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> pulled such a g<name type="GPE">ri</name>m face that the boy stepped back a pace, but at once he returned with clenched fists and the light of battle in his eye.</p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'No</name>!'</q> <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> laughed. <q>'Don't believe what strangers say of themselves either! I am not a fighter. But it would be politer in any case for the challenger to say who he is.'</q></p>
<p>The boy drew himself up proudly. <q>'I am <name type="PERSON">Bergil</name> son of <name type="PERSON">Beregond</name> of the <name type="ORG">Guard</name>s,'</q> he said.</p>
<p><q><name type="CARDINAL">'So</name> I thought,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>, <q>'for you look like your father. I know him and he sent me to find you.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="ORG">'Then</name> why did you not say so at once?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Bergil</name>, and suddenly a look of dismay came over his face. <q>'Do not tell me that he has changed his mind, and will send me away with the maidens! But no, the last <name type="PERSON">wain</name>s have g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q>'His message is less bad than that, if not good.'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q><name type="CARDINAL">'He</name> says that if you would prefer it to standing me on my head, you might show me round the <name type="LOC">City</name> for a while and cheer my l<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>liness. I can tell you some tales of far count<name type="GPE">ri</name>es in return.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Bergil</name> clapped his hands, and laughed with relief. <q><name type="PERSON">'All</name> is well,'</q> he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed. <q><name type="WORK_OF_ART">'<name type="WORK_OF_ART">Come</name></name> then! We were soon going to the <name type="FAC">Gate</name> to look on. We will go now.'</q></p>
<p><q>'What is happening there?'</q></p>
<p><q>'The Captains of the Outlands are expected up the <name type="LOC">South</name> <name type="FAC">Road</name> ere sundown. <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Come</name> with us and you will see.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Bergil</name> proved a good comrade, the best company <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> had had since he parted from <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>, and soon they were laughing and talking gaily as they went about the streets, heedless of the many glances that men gave them. Before long they found themselves in a throng going towards the Great <name type="FAC">Gate</name>. There <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> went up much in the esteem of <name type="PERSON">Bergil</name>, for when he spoke his name and the pass-word the guard saluted him and let him pass through; and what was more, he allowed him to take his companion with him.</p>
<p><q>'That is good!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Bergil</name>. <q>'We boys are no longer allowed to pass the <name type="FAC">Gate</name> without an elder. Now we shall see better.'</q></p>
<p>Beyond the <name type="FAC">Gate</name> there was a crowd of men along the verge of the road and of the great paved space into which all the ways to Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name> ran. All eyes were turned southwards, and soon a murmur rose: <q>'There is dust away there! They are coming!'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> and <name type="PERSON">Bergil</name> edged their way forward to the front of the crowd, and waited. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>rns sounded at some distance, and the noise of chee<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng rolled towards them like a gathe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng wind. Then there was a loud trumpet-blast, and all about them people were shouting.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Forlong</name>! <name type="PERSON">Forlong</name>!'</q> <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> heard men calling. <q>'What do they say?'</q> he asked.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Forlong</name> has come,'</q> <name type="PERSON">Bergil</name> answered; <q>'old <name type="PERSON">Forlong</name> the Fat, the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd of <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ssarnach. That is where my grandsire lives. Hurrah! Here he is. Good old <name type="PERSON">Forlong</name>!'</q></p>
<p>Leading the line there came walking a big thick-limbed horse, and on it sat a man of wide shoulders and huge girth, but old and grey-bearded, yet mail-clad and black-helmed and bea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng a long heavy spear. Behind him <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ched proudly a dusty line of men, well-armed and bea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng great battle-axes; g<name type="GPE">ri</name>m-faced they were, and shorter and somewhat <name type="PERSON">swart</name>hier than any men that <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> had yet seen in <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Forlong</name>!'</q> men shouted. <q>'True heart, true f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end! <name type="PERSON">Forlong</name>!'</q> But when the men of <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ssarnach had passed they muttered: <q><name type="CARDINAL">'So</name> few! <name type="CARDINAL">Two</name> <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name>s, what are they? We hoped for <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> times the number. That will be the new tidings of the black fleet. They are spa<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng only a tithe of their strength. Still every little is a gain.'</q></p>
<p>And so the companies came and were <name type="PERSON">hai</name>led and cheered and passed through the <name type="FAC">Gate</name>, men of the Outlands <name type="PERSON">mar</name><name type="PERSON">chin</name>g to de<name type="PERSON">fen</name>d the <name type="LOC">City</name> of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> in <name type="TIME">a dark <name type="TIME">hour</name></name>; but always too few, always less than hope looked for or need asked. The men of <name type="ORG">Ring</name>l� Vale behind the son of their lord, <name type="NORP">Dervo<name type="GPE">ri</name>n</name> st<name type="GPE">ri</name>ding on foot: <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name>s. From the uplands of <name type="PERSON">Morthond</name>, the great <name type="ORG">Black</name>root Vale, tall Duinhir with his sons, <name type="PERSON">Duilin</name> and <name type="GPE">Derufin</name>, and <name type="CARDINAL">five</name> <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name> bowmen. From the <name type="ORG">Anfalas</name>, the <name type="PERSON">Langstrand</name> far away, a long line of men of many sorts, hunters and herdsmen and men of little villages, scantily equipped save for the household of <name type="PERSON">Golasgil</name> their lord. From <name type="ORG">Lamedon</name>, a few g<name type="GPE">ri</name>m <name type="ORG">hill</name>men without a captain. <name type="PERSON">Fisher</name>-folk of the <name type="ORG">Ethir</name>, some <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name> or more spared from the ships. <name type="ORG">Hirluin</name> the <name type="ORG">Fair</name> of the <name type="ORG">Green</name> <name type="ORG">Hill</name>s from <name type="PERSON">Pinnath Gelin</name> with <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name>s of gallant green-clad men. And last and proudest, <name type="PERSON">Imrahil</name>, P<name type="GPE">ri</name>nce of Dol <name type="PERSON">Amroth</name>, kinsman of the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd, with gilded banners bea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng his token of the Ship and the Silver <name type="PERSON">S<name type="PERSON">wan</name></name>, and a company of k<name type="TIME">night</name>s in full harness <name type="GPE">ri</name>ding grey horses; and behind them <name type="CARDINAL">seven</name> <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name>s of men at arms, tall as lords, grey-eyed, dark-<name type="PERSON">hai</name>red, singing as they came.</p>
<p>And that was all, <name type="CARDINAL">less than <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> <name type="CARDINAL">thousands</name></name> full told. No more would come. Their c<name type="GPE">ri</name>es and the tramp of their feet passed into the <name type="LOC">City</name> and died away. The onlookers stood silent for a while. Dust hung in the air, for the wind had died and the <name type="TIME">evening</name> was heavy. Already the closing <name type="TIME">hour</name> was drawing nigh, and the red sun had g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> behind <name type="GPE">Min<name type="PERSON">dol</name>luin</name>. <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name> came down on the <name type="LOC">City</name>.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> looked up, and it seemed to him that the sky had grown ashen-grey, as if a vast dust and smoke hung above them, and light came dully through it. But in the <name type="LOC">West</name> the dying sun had set all the fume on fire, and now <name type="GPE">Min<name type="PERSON">dol</name>luin</name> stood black against a burning smoulder flecked with embers. <q><name type="CARDINAL">'So</name> ends a fair <name type="DATE">day</name> in wrath!'</q> he said forgetful of the lad at his side.</p>
<p><q><name type="CARDINAL">'So</name> it will, if I have not returned before the sundown-bells,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Bergil</name>. <q><name type="WORK_OF_ART">'<name type="WORK_OF_ART">Come</name></name>! There goes the trumpet for the closing of the <name type="FAC">Gate</name>.'</q></p>
<p>Hand in hand they went back into the <name type="LOC">City</name>, the last to pass the <name type="FAC">Gate</name> before it was shut; and as they reached the <name type="PERSON">Lampw<name type="GPE">ri</name>ghts</name>' Street all the bells in the towers tolled solemnly. Lights sprang in many windows, and from the houses and wards of the men at arms along the walls there came the sound of song.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Farewell</name> for this time,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Bergil</name>. <q>'Take my greetings to my :father, and thank him for the company that he sent. <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Come</name> again soon, I beg. Almost I wish now that there was no war, for we might have had some merry times. We might have journeyed to <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ssarnach, to my grandsire's house; it is good to be there in <name type="DATE">Sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng</name>, the woods and fields are full of flowers. But maybe we will go thither together yet. They will never overcome our <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd, and my father is very valiant. <name type="PERSON">Farewell</name> and return!'</q></p>
<p>They parted and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> hur<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed back towards the citadel. It seemed a long way, and he grew hot and very hungry; and <name type="TIME">night</name> closed down swift and dark. Not a star p<name type="GPE">ri</name>cked the sky. He was late for the <name type="DATE">day</name>meal in the mess, and <name type="PERSON">Beregond</name> greeted him gladly, and sat him at his side to hear news of his son. After the meal <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> stayed a while, and then took his leave, for a strange gloom was on him, and now he desired very much to see <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> again.</p>
<p><q>'Can you find your way?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Beregond</name> at the door of the small hall, on the north side of the citadel, where they had sat. <q><name type="DATE">'It</name> is a black <name type="TIME">night</name>, and all the blacker since orders came that lights are to be dimmed within the <name type="LOC">City</name>, and n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> are to shine out from the walls. And I can give you news of another order: you will be summ<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>d to the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name> <name type="TIME">early to<name type="DATE">morrow</name></name>. I fear you will not be for the <name type="ORDINAL">Third</name> <name type="ORG">Company</name>. Still we may hope to meet again. <name type="PERSON">Farewell</name> and sleep in peace!'</q></p>
<p>The lodging was dark, save for a little lantern set on the table. <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> was not there. Gloom settled still more heavily on <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. He climbed on the bench and t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed to peer out of a window, but it was like looking into a pool of ink. He got down and closed the shutter and went to bed. For a while he lay and lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed for sounds of <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>'s return, and then he fell into an uneasy sleep.</p>
<p>In the <name type="TIME">night</name> he was wakened by a light, and he saw that <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> had come and was pacing to and fro in the room beyond the curtain of the alcove. There were candles on the table and rolls of parchment. He heard the wizard sigh, and mutter: <q>'When will <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name> return?'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="ORG">Hullo</name>!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>, poking his head round the curtain. <q>'I thought you had forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> all about me. I am glad to see you back. It has been <name type="DATE">a long <name type="DATE">day</name></name>.'</q></p>
<p><q>'But the <name type="TIME">night</name> will be too short,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'I have come back here, for I must have a little peace, al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. You should sleep, in a bed while you still may. At the sun<name type="GPE">ri</name>se I shall take you to the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name> again. No, when the summons comes, not at sun<name type="GPE">ri</name>se. The <name type="PRODUCT">Darkness</name> has begun. There will be no <name type="TIME">dawn</name>.'</q></p>
</chapter><chapter num="2"><heading>Chapter 2</heading>
<p>The Passing of the <name type="ORG">Grey</name> <name type="ORG">Company</name></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> was g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, and the thudding hoofs of <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>fax were lost in the <name type="TIME">night</name>, when <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> came back to <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. He had only a light bundle, for he had lost his pack at <name type="FAC">Parth Galen</name>, and all he had was a few useful things he had picked up among the wreckage of <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard. <name type="PERSON">Hasufel</name> was already saddled. <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> and <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> with their horse stood close by.</p>
<p><q><name type="CARDINAL">'So</name> <name type="CARDINAL">four</name> of the <name type="ORG">Company</name> still remain,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'We will <name type="GPE">ri</name>de on together. But we shall not go al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, as I thought. The king is now determined to set out at once. Since the coming of the winged shadow, he desires to return to the <name type="ORG">hill</name>s under cover of <name type="TIME">night</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="PERSON">'And</name> then whither?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>.</p>
<p><q>'I cannot say yet,'</q> <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> answered. <q><name type="DATE">'As</name> for the king, he will go to the muster that he commanded at <name type="ORG">Edoras</name>, <name type="CARDINAL">four</name> <name type="TIME">night</name>s from now. And there, I think, he will hear tidings of war, and the <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> will go down to Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name>. But for myself, and any that will go with me . . .'</q></p>
<p><q>'I for <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. <q><name type="PERSON">'And</name> <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> with him!'</q> said the <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Dwarf</name>.</p>
<p><q>'Well, for myself,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>, <q>'it is dark before me. I must go down also to Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name>, but I do not yet see the road. <name type="TIME">An <name type="TIME">hour</name></name> long prepared approaches.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Don't leave me behind!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'I have not been of much use yet; but I don't <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t to be laid aside, like baggage to be called for when all is over. I don't think the <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s will <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t to be bothered with me now. Though, of course, the king did say that I was to sit by him when he came to his house and tell him all about the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Yes,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>, <q>'and your road lies with him, I think, <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. But do not look for mirth at the ending. It will be long, I fear, ere Th�oden sits at ease again in <name type="GPE">Meduseld</name>. Many hopes will wither in this bitter <name type="DATE">Sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng</name>.'</q></p>
<p>Soon all were ready to depart: <name type="CARDINAL">twenty</name>-<name type="CARDINAL">four</name> horses, with <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> behind <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>, and <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> in front of <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. Presently they were <name type="GPE">ri</name>ding swiftly through the <name type="TIME">night</name>. They had not long passed the mounds at the <name type="ORG">Ford</name>s of <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>, when a <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name> galloped up from the rear of their line.</p>
<p><q><name type="CARDINAL">'My</name> lord,'</q> he said to the king, <q>'there are horsemen behind us. As we crossed the <name type="ORG">ford</name>s I thought that I heard them. Now we are sure. They are overtaking us, <name type="GPE">ri</name>ding hard.'</q></p>
<p>Th�oden at once called a halt. The <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s turned about and seized their spears. <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> dismounted and set <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> on the ground, and drawing his sword he stood by the king's stirrup. �omer and his esquire rode back to the rear. <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> felt more like unneeded baggage than ever, and he wondered, if there was a fight, what he should do. Supposing the king's small escort was trapped and overcome, but he escaped into the darkness � al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> in the wild fields of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> with no idea of where he was in all the endless miles? <q><name type="DATE">'No</name> good!'</q> he thought. He drew his sword and tigh<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed his belt.</p>
<p>The sinking moon was obscured by a great sailing cloud, but suddenly it rode out clear again. Then they all heard the sound of hoofs, and at the same moment they saw dark shapes coming swiftly on the path from the <name type="ORG">ford</name>s. The moonlight glinted here and there on the points of spears. The number of the pursuers could not be told, but they seemed no fewer than the king's escort, at the least.</p>
<p>When they were some <name type="CARDINAL">fifty</name> paces off, �omer c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed in a loud voice: <q>'<name type="PERSON">Hal</name>t! <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>t! Who <name type="GPE">ri</name>des in <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>?'</q></p>
<p>The pursuers brought their <name type="PERSON">steed</name>s to a sudden stand. A silence followed: and then in the moonlight, a horseman could be seen dismounting and walking slowly forward. His hand showed white as he held it up, palm outward, in token of peace; but the king's men g<name type="GPE">ri</name>pped their weapons. At <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> paces the man stopped. He was tall, a dark standing shadow. Then his clear voice rang out.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>? <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> did you say? That is a glad word. We seek that land in haste from long afar.'</q></p>
<p><q>'You have found it,'</q> said �omer. <q>'When you crossed the <name type="ORG">ford</name>s yonder you entered it. But it is the realm of Th�oden the <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g. N<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> <name type="GPE">ri</name>de here save by his leave. Who are you? And what is your haste?'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Hal</name>barad D�nadan, <name type="PRODUCT">Ranger</name> of the <name type="LOC">North</name> I am,'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed the man. <q>'We seek <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> son of <name type="ORG">Arathorn</name>, and we heard that he was in <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="PERSON">'And</name> you have found him also!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. Giving his reins to <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>, he ran forward and embraced the newcomer. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Hal</name>barad!'</q> he said. <q><name type="DATE">'Of</name> all joys this is the least expected!'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Merry</name> breathed a sigh of relief. He had thought that this was some last t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ck of <name type="ORG">Saruman</name>'s, to waylay the king while he had only a few men about him; but it seemed that there would be no need to die in Th�oden's de<name type="PERSON">fen</name>ce, not yet at any rate. He sheathed his sword.</p>
<p><q><name type="PERSON">'All</name> is well,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>, turning back. <q><name type="CARDINAL">'He</name>re are some of my own kin from the far land where I dwelt. But why they come, and how many they be, <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>barad shall tell us.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I have <name type="CARDINAL">thirty</name> with me,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>barad. <q>'That is all of our kindred that could be gathered in haste; but the brethren <name type="ORG">Elladan</name> and <name type="ORG">Elrohir</name> have <name type="GPE">ri</name>dden with us, desi<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng to go to the war. We rode as swiftly as we might when your summons came.'</q></p>
<p><q>'But I did not summon you,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>, <q>'save only in wish. My thoughts have of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> turned to you, and seldom more than to<name type="TIME">night</name>; yet I have sent no word. But come! All such matters must wait. You find us <name type="GPE">ri</name>ding in haste and danger. Ride with us now, if the king will give his leave.'</q></p>
<p>Th�oden was indeed glad of the news. <q><name type="DATE">'It</name> is well!'</q> he said. <q>'If these kinsmen be in any way like to yourself, my lord <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>, <name type="CARDINAL">thirty</name> such k<name type="TIME">night</name>s will be a strength that cannot be counted by heads.'</q></p>
<p>Then the <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s set out again, and <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> for a while rode with the D�nedain; and when they had spoken of tidings in the <name type="LOC">North</name> and in the <name type="LOC">South</name>, <name type="ORG">Elrohir</name> said to him:</p>
<p><q>'I b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng word to you from my father: _<name type="DATE">The <name type="DATE">day</name></name>s are short. If thou art in haste, remember <name type="WORK_OF_ART">the Paths of the Dead</name>_.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Always my <name type="DATE">day</name>s have seemed to me too short to achieve my desire,'</q> answered <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'But great indeed will be my haste ere I take that road.'</q></p>
<p><q>'That will soon be seen,'</q> said <name type="ORG">Elrohir</name>. <q>'But let us speak no more of these things upon the open road!'</q></p>
<p>And <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> said to <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>barad: <q>'What is that that you bear, kinsman?'</q> For he saw that instead of a spear he bore a tall staff, as it were a standard, but it was close-furled in a black cloth bound about with many thongs.</p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'It</name> is a gift that I b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng you from the <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> of <name type="GPE">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name>,'</q> answered <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>barad. 'She wrought it in <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret, and long was the making. But she also sends word to you: _<name type="DATE">The <name type="DATE">day</name></name>s now are short. Either our hope cometh, or all hopes end. Therefore I send thee what I have made for thee. Fare well, <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name>st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>!_'</p>
<p>And <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> said: <q><name type="DATE">'No</name>w I know what you bear. Bear it still for me a while!'</q> And he turned and looked away to the <name type="LOC">North</name> under the great stars, and then he fell silent and spoke no more while the <name type="TIME">night</name>'s journey lasted.</p>
<p><name type="TIME">The <name type="TIME">night</name></name> was old and the <name type="LOC">East</name> grey when they rode up at last from <name type="PERSON">Deep</name>ing-coomb and came back to the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>rn<name type="GPE">burg</name>. There they were to lie and rest for a b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ef while and take counsel.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Merry</name> slept until he was roused by <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> and <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. <q>'The <name type="ORG">Sun</name> is high,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. <q><name type="PERSON">'All</name> others are up and doing. <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Come</name>, Master Sluggard, and look at this place while you may!'</q></p>
<p><q>'There was a battle here <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> <name type="TIME">night</name>s ago,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>, <q>'and here <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> and I played a game that I won only by a single orc. <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Come</name> and see how it was! And there are caves, <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>, caves of wonder! Shall we visit them, <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>, do you think?'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Nay</name>! There is no time,'</q> said the <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name>. <q>'Do not spoil the wonder with haste! I have given you my word to return hither with you, if <name type="DATE">a <name type="DATE">day</name></name> of peace and freedom comes again. But it is now near to <name type="TIME">noon</name>, and at that <name type="TIME">hour</name> we eat, and then set out again, I hear.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Merry</name> got up and yawned. His <name type="TIME">few <name type="TIME">hour</name>s</name>' sleep had not been nearly enough; he was tired and rather dismal. He missed <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>, and felt that he was only a burden, while everybody was making plans for speed in a business that he did not fully understand. <q>'Where is <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>?'</q> he asked.</p>
<p><q>'In a high chamber of the <name type="PERSON">Burg</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. <q><name type="CARDINAL">'He</name> has neither rested nor slept, I think. He went thither some <name type="TIME">hour</name>s ago, saying that he must take thought, and only his kinsman, <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>barad, went with him; but some dark doubt or care sits on him.'</q></p>
<p><q>'They are a strange company, these newcomers,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Stout</name> men and lordly they are, and the <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> look almost as boys beside them; for they are g<name type="GPE">ri</name>m men of face, worn like weathered rocks for the most part, even as <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> himself; and they are silent.'</q></p>
<p><q>'But even as <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> they are courteous, if they break their silence.'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. <q><name type="PERSON">'And</name> have you <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ked the brethren <name type="ORG">Elladan</name> and <name type="ORG">Elrohir</name>? Less sombre is their gear than the others', and they are fair and gallant as <name type="ORG">Elven</name>-lords; and that is not to be wondered at in the sons of <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name> of <name type="GPE">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name>.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Why have they come? Have you heard?'</q> asked <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. He had now dressed, and he flung his grey cloak about his shoulders; and the <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> passed out together towards the ruined gate of the <name type="PERSON">Burg</name>.</p>
<p><q>'They answered a summons, as you heard,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. <q>'Word came to <name type="GPE">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name>, they say: _<name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> has need of his kindred. Let the D�nedain <name type="GPE">ri</name>de to him in <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>!_ But whence this message came they are now in doubt. <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> sent it, I would guess.'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Nay</name>, <name type="PERSON">Galad<name type="GPE">ri</name>el</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. <q>'Did she not speak through <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> of the <name type="GPE">ri</name>de of the <name type="ORG">Grey</name> <name type="ORG">Company</name> from the <name type="LOC">North</name>?'</q></p>
<p><q>'Yes, you have it,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. <q>'The <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> of the <name type="PERSON">Wood</name>! She read many hearts and desires. Now why did not we wish for some of our own kinsfolk, <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>?'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> stood before the gate and turned his b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght eyes away north and east, and his fair face was troubled. <q>'I do not think that any would come,'</q> he answered. <q>'They have no need to <name type="GPE">ri</name>de to war; war already <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ches on their own lands.'</q></p>
<p>For a while the <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> companions walked together, speaking of this and that turn of the battle, and they went down from the broken gate, and passed the mounds of <name type="DATE">the fall</name>en on the greensward beside the road, until they stood on <name type="PERSON">Helm</name>'s <name type="PERSON">Dike</name> and looked into the <name type="LOC">Coomb</name>. The Death Down already stood there, black and tall and stony, and the great trampling and sco<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng of the grass by the <name type="GPE">Huorn</name>s could be plainly seen. The <name type="PERSON">Dunlendings</name> and many men of the gar<name type="GPE">ri</name>son of the <name type="PERSON">Burg</name> were at work on the <name type="PERSON">Dike</name> or in the fields and about the battered walls behind; yet all seemed strangely quiet: a weary valley resting after a great storm. Soon they turned back and went to the mid<name type="DATE">day</name> meal in the hall of the <name type="PERSON">Burg</name>.</p>
<p>The king was already there, and as soon as they entered he called for <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> and had a seat set for him at his side. <q><name type="DATE">'It</name> is not as I would have it,'</q> said Th�oden; <q>'for this is little like my fair house in <name type="ORG">Edoras</name>. And your f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end is g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, who should also be here. But it may be long ere we sit, you and I, at the high table in <name type="GPE">Meduseld</name>; there will be no time for feasting when I return thither. But come now! Eat and d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk, and let us speak together while we may. And then you shall <name type="GPE">ri</name>de with me.'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="DATE">May</name> I?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>, surp<name type="GPE">ri</name>sed and delighted. <q>'That would be splendid!'</q> He had never felt more grateful for any kindness in words. <q>'I am afraid I am only in everybody's way,'</q> he stammered; <q>'but I should like to do anything I could, you know.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I doubt it not,'</q> said the king. <q>'I have had a good <name type="ORG">hill</name>-pony made ready for you. He will bear you as swift as any horse by the roads that we shall take. For I will <name type="GPE">ri</name>de from the <name type="PERSON">Burg</name> by mountain paths, not by the plain, and so come to <name type="ORG">Edoras</name> by way of <name type="PERSON">Dunharrow</name> where the <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name> awaits me. You shall be my esquire, if you will. Is there gear of war in this place, �omer, that my sword-t<name type="PERSON">hai</name>n could use?'</q></p>
<p><q>'There are no great weapon-hoards here, lord.'</q> answered �omer. <q>'<name type="DATE">May</name>be a light helm might be found to fit him; but we have no mail or sword for <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of his stature.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I have a sword,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>, climbing from his seat, and drawing from its black sheath his small b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght blade. Filled suddenly with love for this old man, he knelt on <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> knee, and took his hand and kissed it. <q>'<name type="DATE">May</name> I lay the sword of <name type="PERSON">Me<name type="GPE">ri</name>adoc</name> of the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> on your lap Th�oden <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g?'</q> he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed. <q>'Receive my service, if you will!'</q></p>
<p><q>'Gladly will I take it,'</q> said the king; and laying his long old hands upon the brown <name type="PERSON">hai</name>r of the hobbit; he blessed him. <q>'Rise now, <name type="PERSON">Me<name type="GPE">ri</name>adoc</name>, esquire of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> of the household of <name type="GPE">Meduseld</name>!'</q> he said. <q>'Take your sword and bear it unto good fortune!'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'As</name> a father you shall be to me,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>.</p>
<p><q>'For a little while,'</q> said Th�oden.</p>
<p>They talked then together as they ate, until presently �omer spoke. <q><name type="DATE">'It</name> is near the <name type="TIME">hour</name> that we set for our going, lord,'</q> he said. <q>'Shall I bid men sound the horns? But where is <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>? His place is empty and he has not ea<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q>'We will make ready to <name type="GPE">ri</name>de,'</q> said Th�oden; <q>'but let word be sent to the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> that the <name type="TIME">hour</name> is nigh.'</q></p>
<p>The king with his guard and <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> at his side passed down from the gate of the <name type="PERSON">Burg</name> to where the <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s were assembling on the green. Many were already mounted. It would be a great company; for the king was leaving only a small gar<name type="GPE">ri</name>son in the <name type="PERSON">Burg</name>, and all who could be spared were <name type="GPE">ri</name>ding to the <name type="GPE">weapontake</name> at <name type="ORG">Edoras</name>. <name type="CARDINAL">A thousand</name> spears had indeed already <name type="GPE">ri</name>dden away at <name type="TIME">night</name>; but still there would be some <name type="CARDINAL">five</name> <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name> more to go with the king, for the most part men from the fields and <name type="GPE">dale</name>s of <name type="LOC">West</name>fold.</p>
<p>A little apart the <name type="PRODUCT">Ranger</name>s sat, silent, in an ordered company, armed with spear and bow and sword. They were clad in cloaks of dark grey, and their hoods were cast now over helm and head. Their horses were strong and of proud bea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng, but rough-<name type="PERSON">hai</name>red; and <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> stood there without a <name type="GPE">ri</name>der, <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>'s own horse that they had brought from the <name type="LOC">North</name>; <name type="PERSON">Roheryn</name> was his name. There was no gleam of st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> or gold, nor any fair thing in all their gear and harness: nor did their <name type="GPE">ri</name>ders bear any badge or token, save only that each cloak was pinned upon the left shoulder by a brooch of silver shaped like a rayed star.</p>
<p>The king mounted his horse, <name type="PERSON">Snow</name>mane, and <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> sat beside him on his pony: <name type="PERSON">Stybba</name> was his name. Presently �omer came out from the gate, and with him was <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>, and <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>barad bea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng the great staff close-furled in black, and <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> tall men, neither young nor old So much alike were they, the sons of <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name>, that few could tell them apart: dark-<name type="PERSON">hai</name>red, grey-eyed, and their faces <name type="ORG">elven</name>-fair, clad alike in b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght mail beneath cloaks of silver-grey. Behind them walked <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> and <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. But <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> had eyes only for <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>, so startling was the change that he saw in him, as if in <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> <name type="TIME">night</name> <name type="DATE">many <name type="DATE">year</name>s</name> had fallen on his head. <name type="PERSON">G<name type="GPE">ri</name>m</name> was his face, grey-hued and weary.</p>
<p><q>'I am troubled in mind, lord,'</q> he said, standing by the king's horse. <q>'I have heard strange words, and I see new pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ls far off. I have laboured long in thought, and now I fear that I must change my purpose. Tell me, Th�oden, you <name type="GPE">ri</name>de now to <name type="PERSON">Dunharrow</name>, how long will it be ere you come there?'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'It</name> is now <name type="TIME">a full <name type="TIME">hour</name> past <name type="TIME">noon</name></name>,'</q> said �omer. <q>'Before the <name type="TIME">night</name> of the <name type="ORDINAL">third</name> <name type="DATE">day</name> from now we should come to the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>ld. The <name type="PERSON">Moon</name> will then be <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> <name type="TIME">night</name> past his full, and the muster that the king commanded will be held the <name type="DATE">day</name> after. More speed we cannot make, if the strength of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> is to be gathered.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> was silent for a moment. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Thr</name>ee <name type="DATE">day</name>s,'</q> he murmured, <q>'and the muster of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> will only be begun. But I see that it cannot now be has<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed.'</q> He looked up, and it seemed that he had made some decision; his face was less troubled. Then, by our leave, lord, I must take new counsel for myself and my kindred. We must <name type="GPE">ri</name>de our own road, and no longer in <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret. For me the time of stealth has passed. I will <name type="GPE">ri</name>de east by the swiftest way, and I will take <name type="WORK_OF_ART">the Paths of the Dead</name>.'</p>
<p><q>'<name type="WORK_OF_ART">The Paths of the Dead</name>!'</q> said Th�oden, and trembled. <q>'Why do you speak of them?'</q> �omer turned and gazed at <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>, and it seemed to <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> that the faces of the <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s that sat within hea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng turned pale at the words. <q>'If there be in truth such paths,'</q> said Th�oden, <q>'their gate is in <name type="PERSON">Dunharrow</name>; but no living man may pass it.'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Alas</name>! <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> my f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end!'</q> said �omer. <q>'I had hoped that we should <name type="GPE">ri</name>de to war together; but if you seek <name type="WORK_OF_ART">the Paths of the Dead</name>, then our parting is come, and it is little likely that we shall ever meet again under the <name type="ORG">Sun</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q>'That road I will take, n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>theless,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'But I say to you, �omer, that in battle we may yet meet again, though all the hosts of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> should stand between.'</q></p>
<p><q>'You will do as you will, my lord <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>,'</q> said Th�oden. <q><name type="DATE">'It</name> is your doom, maybe, to tread strange paths that others dare not. This parting g<name type="GPE">ri</name>eves me, and my strength is lessened by it; but now I must take the mountain-roads and delay no longer. <name type="PERSON">Farewell</name>!'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Farewell</name>, lord!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'Ride unto great renown! <name type="PERSON">Farewell</name>, <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>! I leave you in good hands, better than we hoped when we hunted the orcs to <name type="PERSON">Fangorn</name>. <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> and <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> will still hunt with me, I hope; but we shall not forget you.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="CARDINAL">'Go</name>od-bye!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. He could find no more to say. He felt very small, and he was puzzled and depressed by all these gloomy words. More than ever he missed the unquenchable cheerfulness of <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. The <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s were ready, and their horses were fidgeting; he wished they would start a<name type="GPE">ri</name>d get it over.</p>
<p>Now Th�oden spoke to �omer, and he lifted up his hand and c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed aloud, and with that word the <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s set forth. They rode over the <name type="PERSON">Dike</name> and down the <name type="LOC">Coomb</name>, and then, turning swiftly eastwards, they took a path that skirted the foot<name type="ORG">hill</name>s for <name type="QUANTITY">a mile</name> or so, until bending south it passed back among the <name type="ORG">hill</name>s and disappeared from view. <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> rode to the <name type="PERSON">Dike</name> and watched till the king's men were far down the <name type="LOC">Coomb</name>. Then he turned to <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>barad.</p>
<p><q>'There go <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> that I love, and the smallest not the least,'</q> he said. <q><name type="CARDINAL">'He</name> knows not to what end he <name type="GPE">ri</name>des; yet if he knew, he still would go on.'</q></p>
<p><q>'A little people, but of great worth are the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>-folk,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>barad. <q>'Little do they know of our long labour for the safekeeping of their borders, and yet I grudge it not.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="PERSON">'And</name> now our fates are woven together,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q><name type="PERSON">'And</name> yet, alas! here we must part. Well, I must eat a little, and then we also must has<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> away. <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Come</name>, <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> and <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>! I must speak with you as I eat.'</q></p>
<p>Together they went back into the <name type="PERSON">Burg</name>; yet for some time <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> sat silent at the table in the hall, and the others waited for him to speak. <q><name type="WORK_OF_ART">'<name type="WORK_OF_ART">Come</name></name>!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> at <name type="DATE">last.</name> <q>'Speak and be comforted, and shake off the shadow! What has happened since we came back to this g<name type="GPE">ri</name>m place in the grey <name type="TIME">morning</name>?'</q></p>
<p><q>'A struggle somewhat g<name type="GPE">ri</name>mmer for my part than the battle of the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>rn<name type="GPE">burg</name>,'</q> answered <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'I have looked in the <name type="ORG">St<name type="CARDINAL">one</name></name> of <name type="PERSON">Orthanc</name>, my f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends.'</q></p>
<p><q>'You have looked in that accursed st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of wizardry!'</q> exclaimed <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> with fear and astonishment in his face. <q>'Did you say aught to � him? Even <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> feared that encounter.'</q></p>
<p><q>'You forget to whom you speak,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> sternly, and his eyes glinted. <q>'Did I not openly proclaim my title before the doors of <name type="ORG">Edoras</name>? What do you fear that I should say to him? <name type="PERSON">Nay</name>, <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>,'</q> he said in a softer voice, and the g<name type="GPE">ri</name>mness left his face, and he looked like <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> who has laboured in sleepless pain for many <name type="TIME">night</name>s. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Nay</name>, my f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends, I and the lawful master of the <name type="ORG">St<name type="CARDINAL">one</name></name>, and I had both the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght and the strength to use it, or so I judged. The <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght cannot be doubted. The strength was enough � barely.'</q></p>
<p>He drew a deep breath. <q><name type="DATE">'It</name> was a bitter struggle, and the wea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ness is slow to pass. I spoke no word to him, and in the end I wrenched the <name type="ORG">St<name type="CARDINAL">one</name></name> to my own will. That al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> he will find hard to endure. And he beheld me. Yes, Master <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>, he saw me, but in other guise than you see me here. If that will aid him, then I have d<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> ill. But I do not think so. To know that I lived and walked the <name type="LOC">earth</name> was a blow to his heart, I deem; for he knew it not till now. The eyes in <name type="PERSON">Orthanc</name> did not see through the armour of Th�oden; but <name type="ORG">Sauron</name> has not forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> <name type="ORG">Isildur</name> and the sword of <name type="PERSON">Elen</name>dil. Now in the very <name type="TIME">hour</name> of his great designs the heir of <name type="ORG">Isildur</name> and the <name type="PRODUCT">Sword</name> are revealed; for I showed the blade re-forged to him. He is not so mighty yet that he is above fear; nay, doubt ever gnaws him.'</q></p>
<p><q>'But he wields great dominion, n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>theless,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>; <q>'and now he will st<name type="GPE">ri</name>ke more swiftly.'</q></p>
<p><q>'The hasty stroke goes oft astray,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'We must press our Enemy, and no longer wait upon him for the move. See my f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends, when I had mastered the <name type="ORG">St<name type="CARDINAL">one</name></name>, I learned many things. A grave pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>l I saw coming unlooked-for upon <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> from the <name type="LOC">South</name> that will draw off great strength from the de<name type="PERSON">fen</name>ce of Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name>. If it is not countered swiftly, I deem that the <name type="LOC">City</name> will be lost ere <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> <name type="DATE">day</name>s be g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="ORG">'Then</name> lost it must be,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. <q>'For what help is there to send thither, and how could it come there in time?'</q></p>
<p><q>'I have no help to send, therefore I must go myself,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'But there is only <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> way through the mountains that will b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng me to the coastlands before all is lost. That is <name type="WORK_OF_ART">the Paths of the Dead</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="WORK_OF_ART">The Paths of the Dead</name>!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. <q><name type="DATE">'It</name> is a fell name; and little to the liking to the <name type="ORG">Men</name> of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>, as I saw. Can the living use such a road and not pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>sh? And even if you pass that way, what will so few avail to counter the strokes of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>?'</q></p>
<p><q>'The living have never used that road since the coming of the Rohir<name type="GPE">ri</name>m,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>, <q>'for it is closed to them. But in this dark <name type="TIME">hour</name> the heir of <name type="ORG">Isildur</name> may use it, if he dare. Lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>! This is the word that the sons of <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name> b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng to me from their father in <name type="GPE">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name>, wisest in lore: _Bid <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> remember the words of the seer, and <name type="WORK_OF_ART">the Paths of the Dead</name>_.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="PERSON">'And</name> what may be the words of the seer?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>.</p>
<p>"Thus spoke <name type="ORG">Malbeth the Seer</name>, in the <name type="DATE">day</name>s of <name type="LOC">Arvedui</name>, last king at <name type="GPE">Fornost</name>,' said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>:</p>
<p>Over the land there lies a long shadow,</p>
<p>westward rea<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g wings of darkness.</p>
<p>The <name type="FAC">Tower</name> trembles; to the <name type="PERSON">tom</name>bs of kings</p>
<p>doom approaches. The Dead awaken;</p>
<p>for the <name type="TIME">hour</name> is come for the oathbreakers;</p>
<p>at the <name type="ORG">St<name type="CARDINAL">one</name></name> of <name type="PRODUCT">Erech</name> they shall stand again</p>
<p>and hear there a horn in the <name type="ORG">hill</name>s <name type="GPE">ri</name>nging.</p>
<p>Whose shall the horn be? Who shall call them</p>
<p>from the prey <name type="TIME">twilight</name>, the forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> people?</p>
<p>The heir of him to whom the oath they swore.</p>
<p>From the <name type="LOC">North</name> shall he come, need shall d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ve him:</p>
<p>he shall pass the <name type="ORG">Door</name> to <name type="WORK_OF_ART">the Paths of the Dead</name>.</p>
<p><q>'Dark ways doubtless, said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>, but no darker than these staves are to me.'</q></p>
<p><q>'If you would understand them better, then I bid you come with me,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>; <q>'for that way I now shall take. But I do not go gladly; only need d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ves me. Therefore, only of your free will would I have you come, for you will find both toil and great fear, and maybe worse.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I will go with you even on <name type="WORK_OF_ART">the Paths of the Dead</name>, and to whatever, end they may lead,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>.</p>
<p><q>'I also will come,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>, <q>'for I do not fear the Dead.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I hope that the forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> people will not have forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> how to fight,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>; <q>'for otherwise I see not why we should trouble them.'</q></p>
<p><q>'That we shall know if ever we come to <name type="PRODUCT">Erech</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. 'But the oath that they broke was to fight against <name type="ORG">Sauron</name>, and they must fight therefore, if they are to fulfil it. For at <name type="PRODUCT">Erech</name> there stands yet a black st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> that was brought, it was said, from N�menor by <name type="ORG">Isildur</name>; and it was set upon a <name type="ORG">hill</name>, and upon it the <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g of the <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s swore allegiance to him in the beginning of the realm of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>. But when <name type="ORG">Sauron</name> returned and grew in might again, <name type="ORG">Isildur</name> summ<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>d the <name type="ORG">Men</name> of the <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s to fulfil their oath, and they would not: for they had worshipped <name type="ORG">Sauron</name> in the <name type="EVENT">Dark Years</name>.</p>
<p><q><name type="ORG">'Then</name> <name type="ORG">Isildur</name> said to their king: "Thou shalt be the last king. And if the <name type="LOC">West</name> prove mightier than thy <name type="ORG">Black</name> Master, this curse I lay upon thee and thy folk: to rest never until your oath is fulfilled. For this war will <name type="DATE">last through <name type="DATE">year</name>s</name> uncounted, and you shall be summ<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>d once again ere the end." And they fled before the wrath of <name type="ORG">Isildur</name>, and did not dare to go forth to war on <name type="ORG">Sauron</name>'s part; and they hid themselves in <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret places in the mountains and had no dealings with other men, but slowly dwindled in the barren <name type="ORG">hill</name>s. And the terror of the Sleepless Dead lies about the <name type="ORG">Hill</name> of <name type="PRODUCT">Erech</name> and all places where that people lingered. But that way I must go, since there are n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> living to help me.'</q></p>
<p>He stood up. <q><name type="WORK_OF_ART">'<name type="WORK_OF_ART">Come</name></name>!'</q> he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed, and drew his sword, and it flashed in the twilit hall of the <name type="PERSON">Burg</name>. <q>'To the <name type="ORG">St<name type="CARDINAL">one</name></name> of <name type="PRODUCT">Erech</name>! I seek <name type="WORK_OF_ART">the Paths of the Dead</name>. <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Come</name> with me who will!'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> and <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> made no answer, but they rose and followed <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> from the hall. On the green there waited, still and silent, the hooded <name type="PRODUCT">Ranger</name>s. <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> and <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> mounted. <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> sprang upon <name type="PERSON">Roheryn</name>. Then <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>barad lifted a great horn, and the blast of it echoed in <name type="PERSON">Helm</name>'s <name type="PERSON">Deep</name>; and with that they leapt away, <name type="GPE">ri</name>ding down the <name type="LOC">Coomb</name> like thunder, while all the men that were left on <name type="PERSON">Dike</name> or <name type="PERSON">Burg</name> stared in amaze.</p>
<p>And while Th�oden went by slow paths in the <name type="ORG">hill</name>s, the <name type="ORG">Grey</name> <name type="ORG">Company</name> passed swiftly over the plain, and on the next <name type="DATE">day</name> in the <name type="TIME">after<name type="TIME">noon</name></name> they came to <name type="ORG">Edoras</name>; and there they halted only b<name type="GPE">ri</name>efly, ere they passed up the valley, and so came to <name type="PERSON">Dunharrow</name> as darkness fell.</p>
<p>The <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name> greeted them and was glad of their coming; for no mightier men had she seen than the D�nedain and the fair sons of <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name>; but on <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> most of all her eyes rested. And when they sat at supper with her, they talked together, and she heard of all that had passed since Th�oden rode away, concerning which only hasty tidings had yet reached her; and when she heard of the battle in <name type="PERSON">Helm</name>'s <name type="PERSON">Deep</name> and the great slaughter of their foes, and of the charge of Th�oden and his k<name type="TIME">night</name>s, then her eyes sh<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>.</p>
<p>But at last she said: <q><name type="ORG">'<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd</name>s, you are weary and shall now go to your beds with such ease as can be cont<name type="GPE">ri</name>ved in haste. But to<name type="DATE">morrow</name> fairer housing shall be found for you.'</q></p>
<p>But <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> said: <q>'<name type="PERSON">Nay</name>, lady, be not troubled for us! If we may lie here to<name type="TIME">night</name> and break our fast to<name type="DATE">morrow</name>, it will be enough. For I <name type="GPE">ri</name>de on an errand most urgent, and with the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> light of <name type="TIME">morning</name> we must go.'</q></p>
<p>She smiled on him and said: <q><name type="ORG">'Then</name> it was kindly d<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, lord, to <name type="GPE">ri</name>de so many miles out of your way to b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng tidings to <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name>, and to speak with her in her exile.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Indeed no man would count such a journey wasted,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>; <q>'and yet, lady, I could not have come hither, if it were not that the road which I must take leads me to <name type="PERSON">Dunharrow</name>.'</q></p>
<p>And she answered as <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> that likes not what is said: "Then, lord, you are astray; for out of <name type="ORG">Harrow<name type="GPE">dale</name></name> no road runs east or south; and you had best return as you came.'</p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Nay</name>, lady,'</q> said he, <q>'I am not astray; for I walked in this land ere you were born to grace it. There is a road out of this valley, and that road I shall take. <name type="PERSON">Tom</name>orrow I shall <name type="GPE">ri</name>de by <name type="WORK_OF_ART">the Paths of the Dead</name>.'</q></p>
<p>Then she stared at him as <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> that is st<name type="GPE">ri</name>cken, and her face blanched, and for long she spoke no more, while all sat silent. <q>'But, <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>,'</q> she said at last, <q>'is it then your errand to seek death? For that is all that you will find on that road. They do not suffer the living to pass.'</q></p>
<p><q>'They may suffer me to pass,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>; <q>'but at the least I will adventure it. No other road will serve.'</q></p>
<p><q>'But this is madness,'</q> she said. <q>'For here are men of renown and prowess, whom you should not take into the shadows, but should lead to war, where men are needed. I beg you to remain and <name type="GPE">ri</name>de with my brother; for then all our hearts will be gladdened, and our hope be the b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ghter.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'It</name> is not madness, lady,'</q> he answered; <q>'for I go on a path appointed. But those who follow me do so of their free will; and if they wish now to remain and <name type="GPE">ri</name>de with the Rohir<name type="GPE">ri</name>m, they may do so. But I shall take <name type="WORK_OF_ART">the Paths of the Dead</name>, al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, if needs be.'</q></p>
<p>Then they said no more, and they ate in silence; but her eyes were ever upon <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>, and the others saw that she was in great torment of mind. At length they arose, and took their leave of the <name type="PERSON">Lady</name>, and thanked her for her care, and went to their rest.</p>
<p>But as <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> came to the booth where he was to lodge with <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> and <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>, and his companions had g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> in. there came the <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name> after him and called to him. He turned and saw her as a glimmer in the <name type="TIME">night</name>, for she was clad in white; but her eyes were on fire.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>,'</q> she said, <q>'why will you go on this deadly road?'</q></p>
<p><q>'Because I must,'</q> he said. <q>'Only so can I see any hope of doing my part in the war against <name type="ORG">Sauron</name>. I do not choose paths of pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>l, <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name>. Were I to go where my heart dwells, far in the <name type="LOC">North</name> I would now be <name type="PERSON">wan</name>de<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng in the fair valley of <name type="GPE">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name>.'</q></p>
<p>For a while she was silent, as if ponde<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng what this might mean. Then suddenly she laid her hand on his arm. <q>'You are a stern lord and resolute,'</q> she said; <q>'and thus do men win renown.'</q> She paused. <q><name type="ORG">'<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd</name>.'</q> she said, <q>'if you must go, then let me <name type="GPE">ri</name>de in your following. For I am weary of skulking in the <name type="ORG">hill</name>s, and wish to face pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>l and battle.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Your duty is with your people,'</q> he answered.</p>
<p><q><name type="GPE">'Too</name> of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> have I heard of duty,'</q> she c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed. <q>'But am I not of the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>use of <name type="PERSON">Eorl</name>, a shieldmaiden and not a dry-nurse? I have waited on falte<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng feet long enough. Since they falter no longer, it seems, may I not now spend my life as I will?'</q></p>
<p><q>'Few may do that with honour,'</q> he answered. <q>'But as for you, lady: did you not accept the charge to govern the people until their lord's return? If you had not been chosen, then some <name type="PERSON">mar</name>shal or captain would have been set in the same place, and he could not <name type="GPE">ri</name>de away from his charge, were he weary of it or no.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Shall I always be chosen?'</q> she said bitterly. <q>'Shall I always be left behind when the <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s depart, to mind the house while they win renown, and find food and beds when they return?'</q></p>
<p><q>'A time may come soon,'</q> said he, <q>'when n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> will return. Then there will be need of valour without renown, for n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> shall remember the deeds that are d<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> in the last de<name type="PERSON">fen</name>ce of your homes. Yet the deeds will not be less valiant because they are unpraised.'</q></p>
<p>And she answered: <q><name type="PERSON">'All</name> your words are but to say: you are a woman, and your part is in the house. But when the men have died in battle and honour, you have leave to be burned in the house, for the men will need it no more. But I am of the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>use of <name type="PERSON">Eorl</name> and not a serving-woman. I can <name type="GPE">ri</name>de and wield blade, and I do not fear either pain or death.'</q></p>
<p><q>'What do you fear, lady?'</q> he asked.</p>
<p><q>'A cage,'</q> she said. <q>'To stay behind bars, until use and old age accept them, and all chance of doing great deeds is g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> beyond recall or desire.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="PERSON">'And</name> yet you counselled me not to adventure on the road that I had chosen, because it is pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>lous?'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="CARDINAL">'So</name> may <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> counsel another,'</q> she said. <q><name type="DATE">'Yet</name> I do not bid you flee from pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>l, but to <name type="GPE">ri</name>de to battle where your sword may win renown and victory. I would not see a thing that is high and excellent cast away needlessly.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'No</name>r would I,'</q> he said. <q>'Therefore I say to you, lady: Stay! For you have no errand to the <name type="LOC">South</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Neither have those others who go with thee. They go only because they would not be parted from thee � because they love thee.'</q> Then she turned and vanished into the <name type="TIME">night</name>.</p>
<p>When the light of <name type="DATE">day</name> was come into the sky but the sun was not yet <name type="GPE">ri</name>sen above the high <name type="GPE">ri</name>dges in the <name type="LOC">East</name>, <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> made ready to depart. His company was all mounted, and he was about to leap into the saddle, when the <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name> came to bid them farewell. She was clad as a <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name> and girt with a sword. In her hand she bore a cup, and she set it to her lips and drank a little, wishing them good speed; and then she gave the c<name type="CARDINAL">up to</name> <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>, and he drank, and he said: <q>'<name type="PERSON">Farewell</name>, <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>! I d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk to the fortunes of your <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>use, and of you, and of all your people. Say to your brother: beyond the shadows we may meet again!'</q></p>
<p>Then it seemed to <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> and <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> who were nearby that she wept, and in <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> so stern and proud that seemed the more g<name type="GPE">ri</name>evous. But she said: <q>'<name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>, wilt thou go?'</q></p>
<p><q>'I will,'</q> he said.</p>
<p><q><name type="ORG">'Then</name> wilt thou not let me <name type="GPE">ri</name>de with this company, as I have asked?'</q></p>
<p><q>'I will not, lady,'</q> he said. <q>'For that I could not grant without leave of the king and of your brother; and they will not return until to<name type="DATE">morrow</name>. But I count now <name type="TIME">every <name type="TIME">hour</name></name>, indeed every minute. <name type="PERSON">Farewell</name>!'</q></p>
<p>Then she fell on her knees, saying: <q>'I beg thee!'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Nay</name>, lady,'</q> he said, and taking her by the hand he raised her. Then he kissed her hand, and sprang into the saddle, and rode away, and did not look back; and only those who knew him well and were near to him saw the pain that he bore.</p>
<p>But <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name> stood still as a figure <name type="PERSON">carven</name> in st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, her hands clenched at her sides, and she watched them until they passed into the shadows under the black <name type="GPE">Dwimorberg</name>, the Haunted <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>, in which was the <name type="FAC">Gate</name> of the Dead. When they were lost to view, she turned, stumbling as <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> that is blind, and went back to her lodging. But n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of her folk saw this parting, for they hid themselves in fear and would not come forth until the <name type="DATE">day</name> was up, and the reckless strangers were g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>.</p>
<p>And some said: <q>'They are <name type="PERSON">Elvish</name> wights. Let them go where they belong, into the dark places, and never return. The times are evil enough.'</q></p>
<p>The light was still grey as they rode, for the sun had not yet climbed over the black <name type="GPE">ri</name>dges of the Haunted <name type="LOC">Mountain</name> before them. A dread fell on them, even as they passed between the lines of ancient st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s and so came to the <name type="PERSON">Dimholt</name>. There under the gloom of black trees that not even <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> could long endure they found a hollow place opening at the mountain's root, and <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght in their path stood a single mighty st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> like a finger of doom.</p>
<p><q><name type="CARDINAL">'My</name> blood runs c<name type="ORG">hill</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>, but the others were silent, and his voice fell dead on the dank fir-needles at his feet. The horses would not pass the threa<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, until the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ders dismounted and led them about. And so they came at last deep into the <name type="LOC">glen</name>; and there stood a sheer wall of rock, and in the wall the Dark <name type="ORG">Door</name> <name type="PERSON">gape</name>d before them like the mouth of <name type="TIME">night</name>. Signs and figures were carved above its wide arch too dim to read, and fear flowed from it like a grey vapour.</p>
<p>The company halted, and there was not a heart among them that did not quail, unless it were the heart of <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> of the <name type="ORG">Elves</name>, for whom the ghosts of <name type="ORG">Men</name> have no terror.</p>
<p><q>'This is an evil door,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>barad, <q>'and my death lies beyond it. I will dare to pass it n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>theless; but no horse will enter.'</q></p>
<p><q>'But we must go in, and therefore the horses must go too,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'For if ever we come through this darkness, many leagues lie beyond, and <name type="TIME">every <name type="TIME">hour</name></name> that is lost there will b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng the t<name type="GPE">ri</name>umph of <name type="ORG">Sauron</name> nearer. Follow me!'</q></p>
<p>Then <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> led the way, and such was the strength of his will in that <name type="TIME">hour</name> that all the D�nedain and their horses followed him. And indeed the love that the horses of the <name type="PRODUCT">Ranger</name>s bore for their <name type="GPE">ri</name>ders was so great that they were willing to face even the terror of the <name type="ORG">Door</name>, if their masters' hearts were steady as they walked beside them. But <name type="GPE">Arod</name>, the horse of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>, refused the way, and he stood sweating and trembling in a fear that was g<name type="GPE">ri</name>evous to see. Then <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> laid his hands on his eyes and sang some words that went soft in the gloom, until he suffered himself to be led, and <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> passed in. And there stood <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> the <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Dwarf</name> left all al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>.</p>
<p>His knees shook, and he was wroth with himself. <q><name type="CARDINAL">'He</name>re is a thing unheard of!'</q> he said. <q>'An <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name> will go underground and a <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Dwarf</name> dare not!'</q> With that he plunged in. But it seemed to him that he dragged his feet like lead over the threshold; and at once a blindness came upon him, even upon <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> <name type="PRODUCT">Gl�</name>in's son who had walked unafraid in many deep places of the world.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> had brought torches from <name type="PERSON">Dunharrow</name>, and now he went ahead bea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> aloft; and <name type="ORG">Elladan</name> with another went at the rear, and <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>, stumbling behind, strove to overtake him. He could see nothing but the dim flame of the torches; but if the company halted, there seemed an endless whisper of voices all about him, a murmur of words in no tongue that he had ever heard before.</p>
<p>Nothing assailed the company nor withstood their passage, and yet steadily fear grew on the <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Dwarf</name> as he went on: most of all because he knew now that there could be no turning back; all the paths behind were thronged by an unseen host that followed in the dark.</p>
<p>So time unreck<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>d passed, until <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> saw a sight that he was ever afterwards loth to recall. The road was wide, as far as he could judge, but now the company came suddenly into a great empty space, and there were no longer any walls upon either side. The dread was so heavy on him that he could hardly walk. Away to the left something glittered in the gloom as <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>'s torch drew near. Then <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> halted and went to look what it might be.</p>
<p><q>'Does he feel no fear?'</q> muttered the <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Dwarf</name>. <q>'In any other cave <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> <name type="PRODUCT">Gl�</name>in's son would have been the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> to run to the gleam of gold. But not here! Let it lie!'</q></p>
<p>N<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>theless he drew near, and saw <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> kneeling, while <name type="ORG">Elladan</name> held aloft both torches. Before him were the b<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s of a mighty man. He had been clad in mail, and still his harness lay there whole; for the cavern's air was as dry as dust, and his <name type="PERSON">hauberk</name> was gilded. His belt was of gold and garnets, and <name type="GPE">ri</name>ch with gold was the helm upon his bony head face downward on the floor. He had fallen near the far wall of the cave, as now could be seen, and before him stood a stony door closed fast: his finger-b<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s were still clawing at the cracks. A notched and broken sword lay by him, as if he had hewn at the rock in his last despair.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> did not touch him, but after gazing silently for a while he rose and sighed. <q>'Hither shall the flowers of _simbelmyn�_ come never unto world's end,'</q> he murmured. '<name type="CARDINAL">Nine</name> mounds and <name type="CARDINAL">seven</name> there are now green with grass, and through all the <name type="DATE">long <name type="DATE">year</name>s</name> he has lain at the door that he could not unlock. Whither does it lead? Why would he pass? N<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> shall ever know!</p>
<p><q>'For that is not my errand!'</q> he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed, turning back and speaking to the whispe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng darkness behind. <q>'Keep your hoards and your <name type="ORG">sec</name>rets hidden in <name type="DATE">the Accursed Years</name>! Speed only we ask. Let us pass, and then come! I summon you to the <name type="ORG">St<name type="CARDINAL">one</name></name> of <name type="PRODUCT">Erech</name>!'</q></p>
<p>There was no answer, unless it were an utter silence more dreadful than the whispers before; and then a c<name type="ORG">hill</name> blast came in which the torches flickered and went out, and could not be rekindled. Of the time that followed, <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> <name type="TIME">hour</name> or many, <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> remembered little. The others pressed on, but he was ever hindmost, pursued by a groping horror that seemed always just about to seize him; and a rumour came after him like the shadow-sound of many feet. He stumbled on until he was crawling like a beast on the ground and felt that he could endure no more: he must either find an ending and escape or run back in madness to meet the following fear.</p>
<p>Suddenly he heard the tinkle of water, a sound hard and clear as a st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> falling into a dream of dark shadow. Light grew, and lo! the company passed through another gateway, high-arched and broad, and a <name type="GPE">ri</name>ll ran out beside them; and beyond, going steeply down, was a road between sheer cliffs, knife-edged against the sky far above. So deep and narrow was that chasm that the sky was dark, and in it small stars glinted. Yet as <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> after learned it was still <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> <name type="TIME">hour</name>s ere sunset of the <name type="DATE">day</name> on which they had set out from <name type="PERSON">Dunharrow</name>; though for all that he could then tell it might have been <name type="TIME">twilight</name> in <name type="DATE">some later <name type="DATE">year</name></name>, or in some other world.</p>
<p>The <name type="ORG">Company</name> now mounted again, and <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> returned to <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. They rode in file, and <name type="TIME">evening</name> came on and a deep blue <name type="TIME">dusk</name>; and still fear pursued them. <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> turning to speak to <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> looked back and the <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Dwarf</name> saw before his face the glitter in the <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name>'s b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght eyes. Behind them rode <name type="ORG">Elladan</name>, last of the <name type="ORG">Company</name>, but not the last of those that took the downward road.</p>
<p><q>'The Dead are following,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. <q>'I see shapes of <name type="ORG">Men</name> and of horses, and pale banners like shreds of cloud, and spears like <name type="DATE">winter</name>-thickets on <name type="TIME">a misty <name type="TIME">night</name></name>. The Dead are following.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Yes, the Dead <name type="GPE">ri</name>de behind. They have been summ<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>d,'</q> said <name type="ORG">Elladan</name>.</p>
<p>The <name type="ORG">Company</name> came at last out of the ravine, as suddenly as it they had issued from a crack in a wall; and there lay the uplands of a great <name type="GPE">vale</name> before them, and the stream beside them went down with a cold voice over many falls.</p>
<p><q>'Where in <name type="LOC">Middle-<name type="LOC">earth</name></name> are we?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>; and <name type="ORG">Elladan</name> answered: <q>'We have descended from the up<name type="GPE">ri</name>sing of the <name type="PERSON">Morthond</name>, the long c<name type="ORG">hill</name> <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver that flows at last to the sea that washes the walls of Dol <name type="PERSON">Amroth</name>. You will not need to ask hereafter how comes its name: <name type="ORG">Black</name>root men call it.'</q></p>
<p>The <name type="PERSON">Morthond</name> Vale made a great bay that beat up against the sheer southern faces of the mountains. Its steep slopes were grass-grown; but all was grey in that <name type="TIME">hour</name>, for the sun had g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, and far below lights twinkled in the homes of <name type="ORG">Men</name>. The <name type="GPE">vale</name> was <name type="GPE">ri</name>ch and many folk dwelt there.</p>
<p>Then without turning <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed aloud so that all could hear: <q>'F<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends, forget your wea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ness! Ride now, <name type="GPE">ri</name>de! We must come to the <name type="ORG">St<name type="CARDINAL">one</name></name> of <name type="PRODUCT">Erech</name> ere this <name type="DATE">day</name> passes, and long still is the way.'</q> So without looking back they rode the mountain-fields, until they came to a b<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge over the growing torrent and found a road that went down into the land.</p>
<p>Lights went out in house and hamlet as they came, and doors were shut, and folk that were afield c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed in terror and ran wild like hunted deer. Ever there rose the same cry in the gathe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng <name type="TIME">night</name>: <q>'The <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g of the Dead! The <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g of the Dead is come upon us!'</q></p>
<p>Bells were <name type="GPE">ri</name>nging far below, and all men fled before the face of <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>; but the <name type="ORG">Grey</name> <name type="ORG">Company</name> in their haste rode like hunters, until their horses were stumbling with wea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ness. And thus, <name type="TIME">just ere <name type="TIME">mid<name type="TIME">night</name></name></name>, and in a darkness as black as the caverns in the mountains, they came at last to the <name type="ORG">Hill</name> of <name type="PRODUCT">Erech</name>.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ng had the terror of the Dead lain upon that <name type="ORG">hill</name> and upon the empty fields about it. For upon the top stood a black st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, round as a great globe, the h<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name> of a man, though its <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> was bu<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed in the ground. Un<name type="LOC">earth</name>ly it looked, as though it had fallen from the sky, as some believed; but those who remembered still the lore of <name type="LOC">West</name>ernesse told that it had been brought out of the ruin of N�menor and there set by <name type="ORG">Isildur</name> at his landing. N<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the people of the valley dared to approach it, nor would they dwell near; for they said that it was a trysting-place of the <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>-men, and there they would gather in times of fear, thronging round the <name type="ORG">St<name type="CARDINAL">one</name></name> and whispe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng.</p>
<p>To that <name type="ORG">St<name type="CARDINAL">one</name></name> the <name type="ORG">Company</name> came and halted in the dead of <name type="TIME">night</name>. Then <name type="ORG">Elrohir</name> gave to <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> a silver horn, and he blew upon it and it seemed to those that stood near that they heard a sound of answe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng horns, as if it was an echo in deep caves far away. No other sound they heard, and yet they were aware of a great host gathered all about the <name type="ORG">hill</name> on which they stood; and a c<name type="ORG">hill</name> wind like the breath of ghosts came down from the mountains. But <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> dismounted, and standing by the <name type="ORG">St<name type="CARDINAL">one</name></name> he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed in a great voice:</p>
<p><q>'Oathbreakers, why have ye come?'</q></p>
<p>And a voice was heard out of the <name type="TIME">night</name> that answered him, as if from far away:</p>
<p><q>'To fulfil our oath and have peace.'</q></p>
<p>Then <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> said: <q>'<name type="TIME">The <name type="TIME">hour</name></name> is come at <name type="DATE">last.</name> Now I go to <name type="NORP">Pelargir</name> upon <name type="GPE">Anduin</name>, and ye shall come after me. And when all this land is clean of the servants of <name type="ORG">Sauron</name>, I will hold the oath fulfilled, and ye shall have peace and depart for ever. For I am <name type="ORG">Elessar</name>, <name type="ORG">Isildur</name>'s heir of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>.'</q></p>
<p>And with that he bade <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>barad unfurl the great standard which he had brought; and behold! it was black, and if there was any device upon it, it was hidden in the darkness. Then there was silence, and not a whisper nor a sigh was heard again all the long <name type="TIME">night</name>. The <name type="ORG">Company</name> camped beside the <name type="ORG">St<name type="CARDINAL">one</name></name>, but they slept little, because of the dread of the <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>s that hedged them round.</p>
<p>But when the <name type="TIME">dawn</name> came, cold and pale, <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> rose at once, and he led the <name type="ORG">Company</name> forth upon the journey of greatest haste and wea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ness that any among them had known, save he al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, and only his will held them to go on. No other mortal <name type="ORG">Men</name> could have endured it, n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> but the D�nedain of the <name type="LOC">North</name>, and with them <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> the <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Dwarf</name> and <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> of the <name type="ORG">Elves</name>.</p>
<p>They passed <name type="GPE">Tarlang</name>'s Neck and came into <name type="ORG">Lamedon</name>; and the <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name> <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>st pressed behind and fear went on before them, until they came to <name type="ORG">Calembel</name> upon <name type="PERSON">Ci<name type="GPE">ri</name>l</name>, and the sun went down like blood behind <name type="PERSON">Pinnath Gelin</name> away in the <name type="LOC">West</name> behind them. The township and the <name type="ORG">ford</name>s of <name type="PERSON">Ci<name type="GPE">ri</name>l</name> they found deserted, for many men had g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> away to war, and all that were left fled to the <name type="ORG">hill</name>s at the rumour of the coming of the <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g of the Dead. But the next <name type="DATE">day</name> there came no <name type="TIME">dawn</name>, and the <name type="ORG">Grey</name> <name type="ORG">Company</name> passed on into the darkness of the Storm of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> and were lost to mortal sight; but the Dead followed them.</p>
</chapter><chapter num="3"><heading>Chapter 3</heading>
<p>The Muster of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name></p>
<p>Now all roads were running together to the <name type="LOC">East</name> to meet the coming of war and the onset of the <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>. And even as <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> stood at the Great <name type="FAC">Gate</name> of the <name type="LOC">City</name> and saw the P<name type="GPE">ri</name>nce of Dol <name type="PERSON">Amroth</name> <name type="GPE">ri</name>de in with his banners, the <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> came down out of the <name type="ORG">hill</name>s.</p>
<p>Day was <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ing. In the last rays of the sun the <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s cast long pointed shadows that went on before them. <name type="PRODUCT">Darkness</name> had already crept beneath the murmu<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng fir-woods that clothed the steep mountain-sides. The king rode now slowly at the end of the <name type="DATE">day</name>. Presently the path turned round a huge bare shoulder of rock and plunged into the gloom of soft-sighing trees. Down, down they went in a long winding file. When at last they came to the bot<name type="PERSON">tom</name> of the gorge they found that <name type="TIME">evening</name> had fallen in the deep places. The sun was g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Twilight</name> lay upon the waterfalls.</p>
<p><name type="DATE">All <name type="DATE">day</name></name> far below them a leaping stream had run down from the high pass behind, cleaving its narrow way between pine-clad walls; and now through a stony gate it flowed out and passed into a wider <name type="GPE">vale</name>. The <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s followed it, and suddenly <name type="ORG">Harrow<name type="GPE">dale</name></name> lay before them, loud with the noise of waters in the <name type="TIME">evening</name>. There the white <name type="PERSON">Snow</name>bourn, joined by the lesser stream, went rushing, fuming on the st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s, down to <name type="ORG">Edoras</name> and the green <name type="ORG">hill</name>s and the plains. Away to the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght at the head of the great <name type="GPE">dale</name> the mighty <name type="NORP">Starkhorn</name> loomed up above its vast buttresses swathed in cloud; but its jagged peak, clothed in everlasting snow, gleamed far above the world, blue-shadowed upon the <name type="LOC">East</name>, red-stained by the sunset in the <name type="LOC">West</name>.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Merry</name> looked out in wonder upon this strange country, of which he had heard many tales upon their long road. It was a skyless world, in which his eye; through dim <name type="LOC">gulf</name>s of shadowy air, saw only ever-mounting slopes, great walls of st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> behind great walls, and frowning precipices wreathed with mist. He sat for a moment <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> dreaming, lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing to the noise of water, the whisper of dark trees, the crack of st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, and the vast waiting silence that brooded behind all sound. He loved mountains, or he had loved the thought of them <name type="PERSON">mar</name><name type="PERSON">chin</name>g on the edge of sto<name type="GPE">ri</name>es brought from far away; but now he was borne down by the insupportable w<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name> of <name type="LOC">Middle-<name type="LOC">earth</name></name>. He longed to shut out the immensity in a quiet room by a fire.</p>
<p>He was very tired, for though they had <name type="GPE">ri</name>dden slowly, they had <name type="GPE">ri</name>dden with very little rest. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>ur after <name type="TIME">hour</name> for nearly <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> weary <name type="DATE">day</name>s he had jogged up and down, over passes, and through long <name type="GPE">dale</name>s, and across many streams. Sometimes where the way was broader he had <name type="GPE">ri</name>dden at the king's side, not noticing that many of the <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s smiled to see the <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> together: the hobbit on his little shaggy grey pony, and the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> on his great white horse. Then he had talked to Th�oden, telling him about his home and the doings of the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>-folk, or lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing in turn to tales of the <name type="PERSON">Mark</name> and its mighty men of old. But most of the time, especially on this last <name type="DATE">day</name>, <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> had <name type="GPE">ri</name>dden by himself just behind the king, saying nothing, and trying to understand the slow sonorous speech of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> that he heard the men behind him using. It was a language in which there seemed to be many words that he knew, though spoken more <name type="GPE">ri</name>chly and strongly than in the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>, yet he could not piece the words together. At times some <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name> would lift up his clear voice in stir<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng song, and <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> felt his heart leap, though he did not know what it was about.</p>
<p>All the same he had been l<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>ly, and never more so than now at the <name type="DATE">day</name>'s end. He wondered where in all this strange world <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> had got to; and what would become of <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> and <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> and <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. Then suddenly like a cold touch on his heart he thought of <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <q>'I am forgetting them!'</q> he said to himself reproachfully. <q><name type="PERSON">'And</name> yet they are more imp<name type="GPE">ortan</name>t than all the rest of us. And I came to help them; but now they must be <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name>s of miles away, if they are still alive.'</q> He shivered.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="ORG">Harrow<name type="GPE">dale</name></name> at last!'</q> said �omer. <q><name type="DATE">'Our</name> journey is almost at an end.'</q> They halted. The paths out of the narrow gorge fell steeply. Only a glimpse, as through a tall window, could be seen of the great valley in the gloaming below. A single small light could be seen twinkling by the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver.</p>
<p><q>'This journey is over, maybe,'</q> said Th�oden, <q>'but I have far yet to go. <name type="TIME">Last <name type="TIME">night</name></name> the moon was full, and in the <name type="TIME">morning</name> I shall <name type="GPE">ri</name>de to <name type="ORG">Edoras</name> to the gathe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng of the <name type="PERSON">Mark</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q>'But if you would take my counsel,'</q> said �omer in a low voice, <q>'you would then return hither, until the war is over, lost or won.'</q></p>
<p>Th�oden smiled. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Nay</name>, my son, for so I will call you, speak not the soft words of <name type="ORG">Worm</name>tongue in my old ears!'</q> He drew himself up and looked back at the long line of his men fading into the <name type="TIME">dusk</name> behind. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ng <name type="DATE">year</name>s in the space of <name type="DATE">day</name>s it seems since I rode west; but never will I lean on a staff again. If the war is lost, what good will be my hiding in the <name type="ORG">hill</name>s? And if it is won, what g<name type="GPE">ri</name>ef will it be, even if I fall, spending my last strength? But we will leave this now. <name type="TIME">To<name type="TIME">night</name></name> I will lie in the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>ld of <name type="PERSON">Dunharrow</name>. <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> <name type="TIME">evening</name> of peace at least is left us. Let us <name type="GPE">ri</name>de on!'</q></p>
<p>In the deepening <name type="TIME">dusk</name> they came down into the valley. Here the <name type="PERSON">Snow</name>bourn flowed near to the western walls of the <name type="GPE">dale</name>, and soon the path led them to a <name type="ORG">ford</name> where the shallow waters murmured loudly on the st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s. The <name type="ORG">ford</name> was guarded. As the king approached many men sprang up out of the shadow of the rocks; and when they saw the king they c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed with glad voices: <q>'Th�oden <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g! Th�oden <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g! The <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g of the <name type="PERSON">Mark</name> returns!'</q></p>
<p>Then <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> blew a long call on a horn. It echoed in the valley. Other horns answered it, and lights sh<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> out across the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver.</p>
<p>And suddenly there rose a great chorus of trumpets from high above, sounding from some hollow place, as it seemed, that gathered their notes into <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> voice and sent it rolling and beating on the walls of st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>.</p>
<p>So the <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g of the <name type="PERSON">Mark</name> came back victo<name type="GPE">ri</name>ous out of the <name type="LOC">West</name> to <name type="PERSON">Dunharrow</name> beneath the feet of the White <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s. There he found the remaining strength of his people already assembled; for as soon as his coming was known captains rode to meet him at the <name type="ORG">ford</name>, bea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng messages from <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. D�nhere, chieftain of the folk of <name type="ORG">Harrow<name type="GPE">dale</name></name>, was at their head.</p>
<p><q><name type="CARDINAL">'At</name> <name type="TIME">dawn</name> <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> <name type="DATE">day</name>s ago, lord,'</q> he said. <q>'<name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>fax came like a wind out of the <name type="LOC">West</name> to <name type="ORG">Edoras</name>, and <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> brought tidings of your victory to gladden our hearts. But he brought also word from you to has<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> the gathe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng of the <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s. And then came the winged <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q>'The winged <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>?'</q> said Th�oden. <q>'We saw it also, but that was in the dead of <name type="TIME">night</name> before <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> left us.'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="DATE">May</name>be, lord,'</q> said D�nhere. <q><name type="DATE">'Yet</name> the same, or another like to it, a flying darkness in the shape of a monstrous bird, passed over <name type="ORG">Edoras</name> that <name type="TIME">morning</name>, and all men were shaken with fear. For it stooped upon <name type="GPE">Meduseld</name>, and as it came low, almost to the gable, there came a cry that stopped our hearts. Then it was that <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> counselled us not to assemble in the fields, but to meet you here in the valley under the mountains. And he bade us to kindle no more lights or fires than barest need asked. So it has been d<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> spoke with great autho<name type="GPE">ri</name>ty. We trust that it is as you would wish. Naught has been seen in <name type="ORG">Harrow<name type="GPE">dale</name></name> of these evil things.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'It</name> is well,'</q> said Th�oden. <q>'I will <name type="GPE">ri</name>de now to the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>ld, and there before I go to rest I will meet the <name type="PERSON">mar</name>shals and captains. Let them come to me as soon as may be!'</q></p>
<p>The road now led eastward straight across the valley, which was at that point little more than <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> <name type="QUANTITY">a mile</name> in width. Flats and meads of rough grass, grey now in <name type="DATE">the fall</name>ing <name type="TIME">night</name>, lay all about, but in front on the far side of the <name type="GPE">dale</name> <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> saw a frowning wall, a last outlier of the great roots of the <name type="NORP">Starkhorn</name>, cloven by the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver in <name type="DATE">ages past</name>.</p>
<p>On all the level spaces there was great concourse of men. Some thronged to the roadside, <name type="PERSON">hai</name>ling the king and the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ders from the <name type="LOC">West</name> with glad c<name type="GPE">ri</name>es; but stret<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g away into the distance behind there were ordered rows of <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ts and booths, and lines of picketed horses, and great store of arms, and piled spears b<name type="GPE">ri</name>stling like thickets of new-planted trees. Now all the great assembly was falling into shadow, and yet, though the <name type="TIME">night</name>-c<name type="ORG">hill</name> blew cold from the h<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name>s no lanterns glowed, no fires were lit. Watchmen heavily cloaked paced to and fro.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Merry</name> wondered how many <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s there were. He could not guess their number in the gathe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng gloom, but it looked to him like a great army, <name type="CARDINAL">many thousand</name>s strong. While he was pee<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng from side to side the king's party came up under the looming cliff on the eastern side of the valley; and there suddenly the path began to climb, and <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> looked up in amazement. He was on a road the like of which he had never seen before, a great work of men's hands in <name type="DATE">year</name>s beyond the reach of song. Upwards it wound, coiling like a snake, bo<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng its way across the sheer slope of rock. Steep as a stair, it looped backwards and forwards as it climbed. Up it horses could walk, and <name type="PERSON">wain</name>s could be slowly hauled; but no enemy could come that way, except out of the air, if it was de<name type="PERSON">fen</name>ded from above. At each turn of the road there were great standing st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s that had been carved in the likeness of men, huge and clumsy-limbed, squatting cross-legged with their stumpy arms folded on fat bellies. Some in the wea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng of <name type="DATE">the <name type="DATE">year</name></name>s had lost all features save the dark holes of their eyes that still stared sadly at the passers-by. The <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s hardly glanced at them. The P<name type="PRODUCT">�k</name>el-men they called them, and heeded them little: no power or terror was left in them; but <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> gazed at them with wonder and a feeling almost of pity, as they loomed up mournfully in the <name type="TIME">dusk</name>.</p>
<p>After a while he looked back and found that he had already climbed some <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name>s of feet above the valley, but still far below he could dimly see a winding line of <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s crossing the <name type="ORG">ford</name> and filing along the road towards the camp prepared for them. Only the king and his guard were going up into the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>ld.</p>
<p>At last the king's company came to a sharp b<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk, and the climbing road passed into a cutting between walls of rock, and so went up a short slope and out on to a wide upland. The <name type="ORG">Fi<name type="GPE">ri</name>enfeld</name> men called it, a green mountain-field of grass and heath, high above the deep-delved courses of the <name type="PERSON">Snow</name>bourn, laid upon the lap of the great mountains behind: the <name type="NORP">Starkhorn</name> southwards, and northwards the saw-toothed mass of <name type="ORG">Irensaga</name>, between which there faced the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ders, the g<name type="GPE">ri</name>m black wall of the <name type="GPE">Dwimorberg</name>, the Haunted <name type="LOC">Mountain</name> <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing out of steep slopes of sombre pines. Dividing the upland into <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> there <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ched a double line of unshaped standing st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s that dwindled into the <name type="TIME">dusk</name> and vanished in the trees. Those who dared to follow that road came soon to the black <name type="PERSON">Dimholt</name> under <name type="GPE">Dwimorberg</name>, and the menace of the pillar of st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, and the yawning shadow of the forbidden door.</p>
<p>Such was the dark <name type="PERSON">Dunharrow</name>, the work of long-forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> men. Their name was lost and no song or legend remembered it. For what purpose they had made this place, as a town or <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret temple or a <name type="PERSON">tom</name>b of kings, n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> could say. Here they laboured in the <name type="EVENT">Dark Years</name>, before ever a ship came to the western shores, or <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> of the D�nedain was built; and now they had vanished, and only the old P<name type="PRODUCT">�k</name>el-men were left, still sitting at the turnings of the road.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Merry</name> stared at the lines of <name type="PERSON">mar</name><name type="PERSON">chin</name>g st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s: they were worn and black; some were leaning, some were fallen, some cracked or broken; they looked like rows of old and hungry teeth. He wondered what they could be, and he hoped that the king was not going to follow them into the darkness beyond. Then he saw that there were clusters of <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ts and booths on either side of the stony way; but these were not set near the trees, and seemed rather to huddle away from them towards the b<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk of the cliff. The greater number were on the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght, where the <name type="ORG">Fi<name type="GPE">ri</name>enfeld</name> was wider; and on the left there was a smaller camp, in the midst of which stood a tall pavilion. From this side a <name type="GPE">ri</name>der now came out to meet them, and they turned from the road.</p>
<p>As they drew near <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> saw that the <name type="GPE">ri</name>der was a woman with long braided <name type="PERSON">hai</name>r gleaming in the <name type="TIME">twilight</name>, yet she wore a helm and was clad to the waist like a war<name type="GPE">ri</name>or and girded with a sword.</p>
<p><q><name type="PERSON">'Hail</name>, <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd of the <name type="PERSON">Mark</name>!'</q> she c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed. <q><name type="CARDINAL">'My</name> heart is glad at your returning.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="PERSON">'And</name> you, <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name>,'</q> said Th�oden, <q>'is all well with you?'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="PERSON">'All</name> is well,'</q> she answered; yet it seemed to <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> that her voice belied her, and he would have thought that she had been weeping, if that could be believed of <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> so stern of face. <q><name type="PERSON">'All</name> is well. It was a weary road for the people to take, torn suddenly from their homes. There were hard words, for it is long since war has d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ven us from the green fields; but there have been no evil deeds. All is now ordered, as you see. And your lodging is prepared for you; for I have had full tidings of you and knew the <name type="TIME">hour</name> of your coming.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="CARDINAL">'So</name> <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> has come then,'</q> said �omer. <q>'Is he still here?'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'No</name>, he is g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name> turning away and looking at the mountains dark against the <name type="LOC">East</name> and <name type="LOC">South</name>.</p>
<p><q>'Whither did he go?'</q> asked �omer.</p>
<p><q>'I do not know,'</q> she answered. <q><name type="CARDINAL">'He</name> came at <name type="TIME">night</name>, and rode away yestermorn, ere the <name type="ORG">Sun</name> had climbed over the mountain-tops. He is g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q>'You are g<name type="GPE">ri</name>eved, daughter,'</q> said Th�oden. <q>'What has happened? Tell me, did he speak of that road?'</q> He pointed away along the darkening lines of st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s towards the <name type="GPE">Dwimorberg</name>. <q><name type="DATE">'Of</name> <name type="WORK_OF_ART">the Paths of the Dead</name>?'</q></p>
<p><q>'Yes, lord,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name>. <q><name type="PERSON">'And</name> he has passed into the shadows from which n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> have returned. I could not dissuade him. He is g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="ORG">'Then</name> our paths are sundered,'</q> said �omer. <q><name type="CARDINAL">'He</name> is lost. We must <name type="GPE">ri</name>de without him, and our hope dwindles.'</q></p>
<p>Slowly they passed through the short heath and upland grass, speaking no more, until they came to the king's pavilion. There <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> found that everything was made ready, and that he himself was not forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>. A little <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>t had been pitched for him beside the king's lodging; and there he sat al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, while men passed to and fro, going in to the king and taking counsel with him. Night came on, and the <name type="CARDINAL">half</name>-seen heads of the mountains westward were crowned with stars, but the <name type="LOC">East</name> was dark and blank. The <name type="PERSON">mar</name><name type="PERSON">chin</name>g st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s faded slowly from sight, but still beyond them, blacker than the gloom, brooded the vast crou<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g shadow of the <name type="GPE">Dwimorberg</name>.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="WORK_OF_ART">The Paths of the Dead</name>,'</q> he muttered to himself. <q>'<name type="WORK_OF_ART">The Paths of the Dead</name>? What does all this mean? They have all left me now. They have all g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> to some doom: <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> to war in the <name type="LOC">East</name>; and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> and <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> to <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>; and <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> and <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> and <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> to <name type="WORK_OF_ART">the Paths of the Dead</name>. But my turn will come soon enough, I suppose. I wonder what they are all talking about, and what the king means to do. For I must go where he goes now.'</q></p>
<p>In the midst of these gloomy thoughts he suddenly remembered that he was very hungry, and he got <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name> go and see if any<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> else in this strange camp felt the same. But at that very moment a trumpet sounded, and a man came summoning him, the king's esquire, to wait at the king's board.</p>
<p>In the inner part of the pavilion was a small space, curtained off with broidered hangings, and strewn with skins: and there at a small table sat Th�oden with �omer and <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name>, and D�nhere, lord of <name type="ORG">Harrow<name type="GPE">dale</name></name>. <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> stood beside the king's stool and waited on him till presently the old man, coming out of deep thought, turned to him and smiled.</p>
<p><q><name type="WORK_OF_ART">'<name type="WORK_OF_ART">Come</name></name>, Master <name type="PERSON">Me<name type="GPE">ri</name>adoc</name>!'</q> he said. <q>'You shall not stand. You shall sit beside me, as long as I remain in my own lands, and ligh<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> my heart with tales.'</q></p>
<p>Room was made for the hobbit at the king's left hand, but no <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> called for any tale. There was indeed little speech, and they ate and drank for the most part in silence, until at last, plucking up courage, <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> asked the question that was tormenting him.</p>
<p><q>'Twice now, lord, I have heard of <name type="WORK_OF_ART">the Paths of the Dead</name>,'</q> he said. <q>'What are they? And where has <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>, I mean the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> where has he g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>?'</q></p>
<p>The king sighed, but no <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> answered, until at last �omer spoke. <q>'We do not know, and our hearts are heavy,'</q> he said. <q>'But as for <name type="WORK_OF_ART">the Paths of the Dead</name>, you have yourself walked on their <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> steps. <name type="PERSON">Nay</name>. I speak no words of ill omen! The road that we have climbed is the approach to the <name type="ORG">Door</name>, yonder in the <name type="PERSON">Dimholt</name>. But what lies beyond no man knows.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'No</name> man knows,'</q> said Th�oden: 'yet ancient legend, now seldom spoken, has somewhat to report. If these old tales speak true that have come down from father to son in the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>use of <name type="PERSON">Eorl</name>, then the <name type="ORG">Door</name> under <name type="GPE">Dwimorberg</name> leads to a <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret way that goes beneath the mountain to some forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> end. But n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> have ever ventured in to search its <name type="ORG">sec</name>rets, since <name type="PERSON">Baldor</name>, son of <name type="ORG">Brego</name>, passed the <name type="ORG">Door</name> and was never seen among men again. A rash vow he spoke, as he drained the horn at that feast which <name type="ORG">Brego</name> made to hallow new-built <name type="GPE">Meduseld</name>, and he came never to the high seat of which he was the heir.</p>
<p><q>'Folk say that <name type="ORG">Dead <name type="ORG">Men</name></name> out of the <name type="EVENT">Dark Years</name> guard the way and will suffer no living man to come to their hidden halls; but at whiles they may themselves be seen passing out of the door like shadows and down the stony road. Then the people of <name type="ORG">Harrow<name type="GPE">dale</name></name> shut fast their doors and shroud their windows and are afraid. But the Dead come seldom forth and only at times of great unquiet and coming death.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'Yet</name> it is said in <name type="ORG">Harrow<name type="GPE">dale</name></name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name> in a low voice. <q>'that in the moonless <name type="TIME">night</name>s but little while ago a great host in strange array passed by. Whence they came n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> knew, but they went up the stony road and vanished into the <name type="ORG">hill</name>, as if they went to keep a tryst.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="ORG">'Then</name> why has <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> that way?'</q> asked <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'Don't you know anything that would explain it?'</q></p>
<p><q>'Unless he has spoken words to you as his f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end that we have not heard,'</q> said �omer, <q>'n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> now in the land of the living can tell his purpose.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Greatly changed he seemed to me since I saw him <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> in the king's house,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name>: <q>'g<name type="GPE">ri</name>mmer, older. <name type="PERSON">Fey</name> I thought him, and like <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> whom the Dead call.'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="DATE">May</name>be he was called,'</q> said Th�oden; 'and my heart tells me that I shall not see him again. Yet he is a kingly man of high destiny. And take comfort in this, daughter, since comfort you seem to need in your g<name type="GPE">ri</name>ef for this guest. It is said that when the <name type="PERSON">Eorl</name>ingas came out of the <name type="LOC">North</name> and passed at length up the <name type="PERSON">Snow</name>bourn, seeking strong places of refuge in time of need, <name type="ORG">Brego</name> and his son <name type="PERSON">Baldor</name> climbed the Stair of the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>ld and so came before the <name type="ORG">Door</name>. On the threshold sat an old man, aged beyond guess of <name type="DATE">year</name>s; tall and kingly he had been, but now he was withered as an old st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. Indeed for st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> they took him, for he moved not, and he said no word, until they sought to pass him by and enter. And then a voice came out of him, as it were out of the ground, and to their amaze it spoke in the western tongue: _The way is shut_.</p>
<p><name type="ORG">'Then</name> they halted and looked at him and saw that he lived still; but he did not look at them. _The way is shut_, his voice said again _It was made by those who are Dead, and the Dead keep it, until the time comes. The way is shut._</p>
<p><q>'_And when will that time be?_said <name type="PERSON">Baldor</name>. But no answer did he ever get. For the old man died in that <name type="TIME">hour</name> and fell upon his face; and no other tidings of the ancient dwellers in the mountains have our folk ever learned. Yet maybe at last the time foretold has come, and <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> may pass.'</q></p>
<p><q>'But how shall a man discover whether that time be come or no, save by da<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng the <name type="ORG">Door</name>?'</q> said �omer. <q><name type="PERSON">'And</name> that way I would not go though all the hosts of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> stood before me, and I were al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> and had no other refuge. <name type="PERSON">Alas</name> that a fey mood should fall on a man so <name type="ORG">greatheart</name>ed in this <name type="TIME">hour</name> of need! Are there not evil things enough abroad without seeking them under the <name type="LOC">earth</name>? War is at hand.'</q></p>
<p>He paused, for at that moment there was a noise outside, a man's voice crying the name of Th�oden, and the challenge of the guard.</p>
<p>Presently the captain of the <name type="ORG">Guard</name> thrust aside the curtain. <q>'A man is here, lord,'</q> he said, <q>'an errand-<name type="GPE">ri</name>der of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>. He wishes to come before you at once.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Let him come!'</q> said Th�oden.</p>
<p>A tall man entered, and <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> choked back a cry; for a moment it seemed to him that <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> was alive again and had returned. Then he saw that it was not so; the man was a stranger, though as like to <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> as if he were <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of his kin, tall and grey-eyed and proud. He was clad as a <name type="GPE">ri</name>der with a cloak of dark green over a coat of fine mail; on the front of his helm was wrought a small silver star. In his hand he bore a single arrow, black-feathered and barbed with steel, but the point was painted red.</p>
<p>He sank on <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> knee and presented the arrow to Th�oden. <q><name type="PERSON">'Hail</name> <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd of the Rohir<name type="GPE">ri</name>m, f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>!'</q> he said. <q>'<name type="GPE">Hirgon</name> I am, errand-<name type="GPE">ri</name>der of <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name>, who b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng you this token of war. <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> is in great need. Of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> the Rohir<name type="GPE">ri</name>m have aided us, but now the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name> asks for all your strength and all your speed; lest <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> fall at <name type="DATE">last.</name>'</q></p>
<p><q>'The <name type="ORG">Red Arrow</name>!'</q> said Th�oden, holding it, as <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> who receives a summons long expected and yet dreadful when it comes. His hand trembled. <q>'The <name type="ORG">Red Arrow</name> has not been seen in the <name type="PERSON">Mark</name> in all my <name type="DATE">year</name>s! Has it indeed come to that? And what does the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name> reckon that all my strength and all my speed may be?'</q></p>
<p><q>'That is best known to yourself, lord,'</q> said <name type="GPE">Hirgon</name>. <q>'But ere long it may well come to pass that Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name> is surrounded, and unless you have the strength to break a siege of many powers, the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name> bids me say that he judges that the strong arms of the Rohir<name type="GPE">ri</name>m would be better within his walls than without.'</q></p>
<p><q>'But he knows that we are a people who fight rather upon horseback and in the open, and that we are also a scattered people and time is needed for the gathe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng of our <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s. Is it not true, <name type="GPE">Hirgon</name>, that the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd of Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name> knows more than he sets in his message? For we are already at war, as you may have seen, and you do not find us all unprepared. <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> the <name type="ORG">Grey</name> has been among us, and even now we are muste<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng for battle in the <name type="LOC">East</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q>'What the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name> may know or guess of all these things I cannot say,'</q> answered <name type="GPE">Hirgon</name>. <q>'But indeed our case is desperate. My lord does not issue any command to you, he begs you only to remember old f<name type="GPE">ri</name>endship and oaths long spoken, and for your own good to do all that you may. It is reported to us that many kings have <name type="GPE">ri</name>dden in from the <name type="LOC">East</name> to the service of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>. From the <name type="LOC">North</name> to the field of <name type="PERSON">Dagorlad</name> there is skirmish and rumour of war. In the <name type="LOC">South</name> the <name type="ORG">Harad</name><name type="GPE">ri</name>m are moving, and fear has fallen on all our coastlands, so that little help will come to us thence. Make haste! For it is before the walls of Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name> that the doom of our time will be decided, and if the tide be not stemmed there, then it will flow over all the fair fields of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>, and even in this <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>ld among the <name type="ORG">hill</name>s there shall be no refuge.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Dark tidings,'</q> said Th�oden, 'yet not all unguessed. But say to <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name> that even if <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> itself felt no pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>l, still we would come to his aid. But we have suffered much loss in our battles with <name type="ORG">Saruman</name> the traitor, and we must still think of our frontier to the north and east, as his own tidings make clear. So great a power as the Dark <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd seems now to wield might well contain us in battle before the <name type="LOC">City</name> and yet st<name type="GPE">ri</name>ke with great force across the <name type="LOC">River</name> away beyond the <name type="FAC">Gate</name> of <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>gs.</p>
<p>'But we will speak no longer counsels of prudence. We will come. The <name type="GPE">weapontake</name> was set for the <name type="DATE">morrow</name>. When all is ordered we will set out. <name type="CARDINAL">Ten thousand</name> spears I might have sent <name type="GPE">ri</name>ding over the plain to the dismay of your foes. It will be less now, I fear; for I will not leave my strongholds all unguarded. Yet <name type="CARDINAL">six</name> <name type="CARDINAL">thousands</name> at the least shall <name type="GPE">ri</name>de behind me. For say to <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name> that in this <name type="TIME">hour</name> the <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g of the <name type="PERSON">Mark</name> himself will come down to the land of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>, though maybe he will not <name type="GPE">ri</name>de back. But it is a long road, and man and beast must reach the end with strength to fight. <name type="DATE">A <name type="DATE">week</name></name> it may be from to<name type="DATE">morrow</name>'s morn ere you hear the cry of the Sons of <name type="PERSON">Eorl</name> coming from the <name type="LOC">North</name>.</p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'<name type="DATE">A <name type="DATE">week</name></name></name>!'</q> said <name type="GPE">Hirgon</name>. <q>'If it must be so, it must. But you are like to find only ruined walls in <name type="CARDINAL">seven</name> <name type="DATE">day</name>s from now, unless other help unlooked-for comes. Still, you may at the least disturb the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s and Swarthy <name type="ORG">Men</name> from their feasting in the White <name type="FAC">Tower</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="CARDINAL">'At</name> the least we will do that,'</q> said Th�oden. 'But I myself am new-come from battle and long journey, and I will now go to rest. <name type="PERSON">Tarry</name> here this <name type="TIME">night</name>. Then you shall look on the muster of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> and <name type="GPE">ri</name>de away the gladder for the sight, and the swifter for the rest. In the <name type="TIME">morning</name> counsels are best, and <name type="TIME">night</name> changes many thoughts.</p>
<p>With that the king stood up, and they all rose. <q><name type="CARDINAL">'Go</name> now each to your rest.'</q> he said, <q>'and sleep well. And you, Master <name type="PERSON">Me<name type="GPE">ri</name>adoc</name>, I need no more to<name type="TIME">night</name>. But be ready to my call as soon as the <name type="ORG">Sun</name> is <name type="GPE">ri</name>sen.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I will be ready,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>, <q>'even if you bid me <name type="GPE">ri</name>de with you on <name type="WORK_OF_ART">the Paths of the Dead</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Speak not words of omen!'</q> said the king. <q>'For there may be more roads than <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> that could bear that name. But I did not say that I would bid you <name type="GPE">ri</name>de with me on any road. <name type="TIME">Good <name type="TIME">night</name></name>!'</q></p>
<p><q>'I won't be left behind, to be called for on return!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'I won't be left, I won't.'</q> And repeating this over and over again to himself he fell asleep at last in his <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>t.</p>
<p>He was wakened by a man shaking him. <q>'Wake up, wake up. Master <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>lbytla!'</q> he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed; and at length <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> came out of deep dreams and sat up with a start. It still seemed very dark, he thought.</p>
<p><q>'What is the matter?'</q> he asked.</p>
<p><q>'The king calls for you.'</q></p>
<p><q>'But the <name type="ORG">Sun</name> has not <name type="GPE">ri</name>sen, yet,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>.</p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'No</name>, and will not <name type="GPE">ri</name>se to<name type="DATE">day</name>, Master <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>lbytla. Nor ever again, <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> would think under this cloud. But time does not stand still, though the <name type="ORG">Sun</name> be lost. Make haste!'</q></p>
<p>Flinging on some clothes, <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> looked outside. The world was darkling. The very air seemed brown, and all things about were black and grey and shadowless; there was a great stillness. No shape of cloud could be seen, unless it were far away westward, where the furthest groping fingers of the great gloom still crawled onwards and a little light leaked through them. Overhead there hung a heavy roof, sombre and featureless, and light seemed rather to be failing than growing.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Merry</name> saw many folk standing, looking up and mutte<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng: all their faces were grey and sad, and some were afraid. With a sinking heart he made his way to the king. <name type="GPE">Hirgon</name> the <name type="GPE">ri</name>der of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> was there before him, and beside him stood now another man, like him and dressed alike, but shorter and broader. As <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> entered he was speaking to the king.</p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'It</name> comes from <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>, lord,'</q> he said. <q><name type="DATE">'It</name> began <name type="TIME">last <name type="TIME">night</name></name> at sunset. From the <name type="ORG">hill</name>s in the <name type="LOC">East</name>fold of your realm I saw it <name type="GPE">ri</name>se and creep across the sky, and <name type="TIME">all <name type="TIME">night</name></name> as I rode it came behind eating up the stars. Now the great cloud hangs over all the land between here and the <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s of <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>; and it is deepening. War has already begun.'</q></p>
<p>For a while the king sat silent. At last he spoke. <q><name type="CARDINAL">'So</name> we come to it in the end,'</q> he said: <q>'the great battle of our time, in which many things shall pass away. But at least there is no longer need for hiding. We will <name type="GPE">ri</name>de the straight way and the open road and with all our speed. The muster shall begin at once, and wait for n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> that tarry. Have you good store in Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name>? For if we must <name type="GPE">ri</name>de now in all haste, then we must <name type="GPE">ri</name>de light, with but meal and water enough to last us into battle.'</q></p>
<p><q>'We have very great store long prepared,'</q> answered <name type="GPE">Hirgon</name>. Ride now as light and as swift as you may!'</p>
<p><q><name type="ORG">'Then</name> call the heralds, �omer,'</q> said Th�oden. <q>'Let the <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s be <name type="PERSON">mar</name>shalled!'</q></p>
<p>�omer went out, and presently the trumpets rang in the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>ld and were answered by many others from below; but their voices no longer sounded clear and brave as they had seemed to <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> the <name type="TIME">night</name> before. Dull they seemed and harsh in the heavy air, braying ominously.</p>
<p>The king turned to <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'I am going to war, Master <name type="PERSON">Me<name type="GPE">ri</name>adoc</name>,'</q> he said. <q>'In a little while I shall take the road. I release you from my service, but not from my f<name type="GPE">ri</name>endship. You shall abide here, and if you will, you shall serve the <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name>, who will govern the folk in my stead.'</q></p>
<p><q>'But, but, lord,'</q> <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> stammered, <q>'I offered you my sword. I do not <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t to be parted from you like this, Th�oden <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g. And as all my f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends have g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> to the battle' I should be ashamed to stay behind.'</q></p>
<p><q>'But we <name type="GPE">ri</name>de on horses tall and swift,'</q> said Th�oden; <q>'and great though your heart be, you cannot <name type="GPE">ri</name>de on such beasts.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="ORG">'Then</name> tie me on to the back of <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, or let me hang on a stirrup, or something,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q><name type="DATE">'It</name> is a long way to run; but run I shall, if I cannot <name type="GPE">ri</name>de, even if I wear my feet off and ar<name type="GPE">ri</name>ve <name type="DATE">week</name>s too late.'</q></p>
<p>Th�oden smiled. <q>'Rather than that I would bear you with me on <name type="PERSON">Snow</name>mane,'</q> he said. <q>'But at the least you shall <name type="GPE">ri</name>de with me to <name type="ORG">Edoras</name> and look on <name type="GPE">Meduseld</name>; for that way I shall go. So far <name type="PERSON">Stybba</name> can bear you: the great race will not begin till we reach the plains.'</q></p>
<p>Then <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name> rose up. <q><name type="WORK_OF_ART">'<name type="WORK_OF_ART">Come</name></name> now, <name type="PERSON">Me<name type="GPE">ri</name>adoc</name>!'</q> she said. <q>'I will show you the gear that I have prepared fur you.'</q> They went out together. <q>'This request only did <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> make to me,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name>, as they passed among the <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ts, <q>'that you should be armed for battle. I have granted it, as I could. For my heart tells me that you will need such gear ere the end.'</q></p>
<p>Now she led <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> to a booth among the lodges of the king's guard and there an armourer brought out to her a small helm, and a round shield, and other gear.</p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'No</name> mail have we to fit you,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name>, <q>'nor any time for the forging of such a <name type="PERSON">hauberk</name>; but here is also a stout jerkin of leather, a belt, and a knife. A sword you have.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Merry</name> bowed, and the lady showed him the shield, which was like the shield that had been given to <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>, and it bore on it the device of the white horse. <q>'Take all these things,'</q> she said, <q>'and bear them to good fortune! <name type="PERSON">Farewell</name> now, Master <name type="PERSON">Me<name type="GPE">ri</name>adoc</name>! Yet maybe we shall meet again, you and I.'</q></p>
<p>So it was that amid a gathe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng gloom the <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g of the <name type="PERSON">Mark</name> made ready to lead all his <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s on the eastward road. Hearts were heavy and many quailed in the shadow. But they were a stern people, loyal to their lord, and little weeping or murmu<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng was heard, even in the camp in the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>ld where the exiles from <name type="ORG">Edoras</name> were housed, women and children and old men. Doom hung over them, but they faced it silently.</p>
<p><name type="CARDINAL">Two</name> swift <name type="TIME">hour</name>s passed, and now the king sat upon his white horse, glimme<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng in the <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> light. Proud and tall he seemed, though the <name type="PERSON">hai</name>r that flowed beneath his high helm was like snow; and many <name type="PERSON">mar</name>velled at him and took heart to see him unbent and unafraid.</p>
<p>There on the wide flats beside the noisy <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver were <name type="PERSON">mar</name>shalled in many companies well nigh <name type="CARDINAL">five</name> and <name type="CARDINAL">fifty</name> <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name>s of <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s fully armed, and many <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name>s of other men with spare horses lightly burdened. A single trumpet sounded. The king raised his hand, and then silently the host of the <name type="PERSON">Mark</name> began to move. Foremost went <name type="CARDINAL">twelve</name> of the king's household-men, <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s of renown. Then the king followed with �omer on his <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght. He had said farewell to <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name> above in the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>ld, and the memory was g<name type="GPE">ri</name>evous; but now he turned his mind to the road that lay ahead. Behind him <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> rode on <name type="PERSON">Stybba</name> with the errand <name type="GPE">ri</name>ders of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>, and behind them again <name type="CARDINAL">twelve</name> more of the king's household. They passed down the long ranks of waiting men with stern and unmoved faces. But when they had come almost to the end of the line <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> looked up glancing keenly at the hobbit. A young man, <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> thought as he returned the glance, less in h<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name> and girth than most. He caught the glint of clear grey eyes; and then he shivered, for it came suddenly to him that it was the face of <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> without hope who goes in search of death.</p>
<p>On down the grey road they went beside the <name type="PERSON">Snow</name>bourn rushing on its st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s; through the hamlets of <name type="FAC">Underharrow</name> and <name type="PERSON">Upbourn</name>, where many sad faces of women looked out from dark doors; and so without horn or harp or music of men's voices the great <name type="GPE">ri</name>de into the <name type="LOC">East</name> began with which the songs of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> were busy for many long lives of men thereafter.</p>
<p>From dark <name type="PERSON">Dunharrow</name> in the dim <name type="TIME">morning</name></p>
<p>with thane and captain rode <name type="PERSON">Thengel</name>'s son:</p>
<p>to <name type="ORG">Edoras</name> he came, the ancient halls</p>
<p>of the <name type="PERSON">Mark</name>-wardens mist-enshrouded;</p>
<p>golden timbers were in gloom mantled.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Farewell</name> he bade to his free people,</p>
<p>h<name type="LOC">earth</name> and high-seat, and the hallowed places,</p>
<p>where long he had feasted ere the light faded.</p>
<p>Forth rode the king, fear behind him,</p>
<p>fate before him. Fealty kept he;</p>
<p>oaths he had taken, all fulfilled them.</p>
<p>Forth rode Th�oden. <name type="CARDINAL">Five</name> <name type="TIME">night</name>s and <name type="DATE">day</name>s</p>
<p>east and onward rode the <name type="PERSON">Eorl</name>ingas</p>
<p>through <name type="NORP">Folde</name> and <name type="PERSON">Fen<name type="PERSON">mar</name>ch</name> and the <name type="GPE">Fi<name type="GPE">ri</name>enwood</name>,</p>
<p><name type="CARDINAL">six</name> thousand spears to <name type="ORG">Sun</name>lending,</p>
<p><name type="GPE">Mund<name type="GPE">burg</name></name> the mighty under <name type="GPE">Min<name type="PERSON">dol</name>luin</name>,</p>
<p><name type="LOC">Sea</name>-kings' city in the <name type="LOC">South</name>-kingdom</p>
<p>foe-beleaguered, fire-encircled.</p>
<p>Doom drove them on. <name type="PRODUCT">Darkness</name> took them,</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Ho</name>rse and horseman; hoofbeats afar</p>
<p>sank into silence: so the songs tell us.</p>
<p>It was indeed in deepening gloom that the king came to <name type="ORG">Edoras</name>, although it was then but <name type="TIME">noon</name> by the <name type="TIME">hour</name>. There he halted only a short while and strengthened his host by <name type="CARDINAL">some <name type="CARDINAL">three</name></name> score of <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s that came late to the <name type="GPE">weapontake</name>. Now having ea<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> he made ready to set out again, and he wished his esquire a kindly farewell. But <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> begged for the last time not to be parted from him.</p>
<p><q>'This is no journey for such <name type="PERSON">steed</name>s as <name type="PERSON">Stybba</name>, as I have told you ' said Th�oden. <name type="PERSON">'And</name> in such a battle as we think to make on the fields of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> what would you do, Master <name type="PERSON">Me<name type="GPE">ri</name>adoc</name>, sword-t<name type="PERSON">hai</name>n though you be, and greater of heart than of stature?'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'As</name> for that, who can tell?'</q> answered <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'But why, lord, did you receive me as sword-t<name type="PERSON">hai</name>n, if not to stay by your side? And I would not have it said of me in song only that I was always left behind!'</q></p>
<p><q>'I received you for your safe-keeping,'</q> answered Th�oden; <q>'and also to do as I might bid. N<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of my <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s can bear you as burden. If the battle were before my gates, maybe your deeds would be remembered by the minstrels; but it is <name type="CARDINAL">a <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name></name> leagues and <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> to <name type="GPE">Mund<name type="GPE">burg</name></name> where <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name> is lord. I will say no more.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Merry</name> bowed and went away unhappily, and stared at the lines of horsemen. Already the companies were prepa<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng to start: men were tigh<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing girths, looking to saddles, caressing their horses; some gazed uneasily at the lowe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng sky. Unnoticed a <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name> came up and spoke softly in the hobbit's ear.</p>
<p><q>'_Where will <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ts not, a way opens_, so we say,'</q> he whispered; <q>'and so I have found myself.'</q> <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> looked up and saw that it was the young <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name> whom he had noticed in the <name type="TIME">morning</name>. <q>'You wish to go whither the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd of the <name type="PERSON">Mark</name> goes: I see it in your face.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I do,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>.</p>
<p><q><name type="ORG">'Then</name> you shall go with me,'</q> said the <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>. <q>'I will bear you before me, under my cloak until we are far afield, and this darkness is yet darker. Such good will should not be denied. Say no more to any man, but come!'</q></p>
<p><q>'Thank you indeed!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'Thank you, sir, though I do not know your name.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Do you not?'</q> said the <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name> softly. <q><name type="ORG">'Then</name> call me <name type="PERSON">Dernhelm</name>.'</q></p>
<p>Thus it came to pass that when the king set out, before <name type="PERSON">Dernhelm</name> sat <name type="PERSON">Me<name type="GPE">ri</name>adoc</name> the hobbit, and the great grey <name type="PERSON">steed</name> <name type="ORG">Windfola</name> made little of the burden; for <name type="PERSON">Dernhelm</name> was less in w<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name> than many men, though lithe and well-knit in frame.</p>
<p>On into the shadow they rode. In the willow-thickets where <name type="PERSON">Snow</name>bourn flowed into <name type="ORG">Ent</name>wash, <name type="CARDINAL">twelve</name> leagues east of <name type="ORG">Edoras</name>, they camped that <name type="TIME">night</name>. And then on again through the <name type="NORP">Folde</name>; and through the <name type="PERSON">Fen<name type="PERSON">mar</name>ch</name>, where to their <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght great oakwoods climbed on the skirts of the <name type="ORG">hill</name>s under the shades of dark <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>ifi<name type="GPE">ri</name>en by the borders of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>; but away to their left the mists lay on the <name type="PERSON">mar</name>shes <name type="ORG">fed</name> by the mouths of <name type="ORG">Ent</name>wash. And as they rode rumour came of war in the <name type="LOC">North</name>. <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ne men, <name type="GPE">ri</name>ding wild, brought word of foes assailing their east-borders, of orc-hosts <name type="PERSON">mar</name><name type="PERSON">chin</name>g in the <name type="ORG">Wold</name> of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>.</p>
<p><q>'Ride on! Ride on!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed �omer. <q><name type="GPE">'Too</name> late now to turn aside. The <name type="PERSON">fen</name>s of <name type="ORG">Ent</name>wash must guard our flank. Haste now we need. Ride on!'</q></p>
<p>And so <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g Th�oden departed from his own realm, and mile by mile the long road wound away, and the beacon <name type="ORG">hill</name>s <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ched past: Calenhad, <name type="GPE">Min-<name type="PERSON">Rimmon</name></name>, Erelas, <name type="GPE">Nar<name type="PERSON">dol</name></name>. But their fires were quenched. All the lands were grey and still; and ever the shadow deepened before them, and hope <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ed in every heart.</p>

<p>The Siege of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> was roused by <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. Candles were lit in their chamber, for only a dim <name type="TIME">twilight</name> came through the windows; the air was heavy as with approa<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g thunder.</p>
<p><q>'What is the time?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> yawning.</p>
<p><q>'Past the <name type="ORG">sec</name>ond <name type="TIME">hour</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Tim</name>e to get up and make yourself presentable. You are summ<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>d to the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd of the <name type="LOC">City</name> to learn your new duties.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="PERSON">'And</name> will he provide breakfast?'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'No</name>! I have provided it: all that you will get till <name type="TIME">noon</name>. Food is now <name type="PERSON">dol</name>ed out by order.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> looked ruefully at the small loaf and (he thought) very inadequate pat of butter which was set out for him, beside a cup of thin milk. <q>'Why did you b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng me here?'</q> he said.</p>
<p><q>'You know quite well,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'To keep you out of mischief; and if you do not like being here, you can remember that you brought it on yourself.'</q> <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> said no more.</p>
<p>Before long he was walking with <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> once more down the cold cor<name type="GPE">ri</name>dor to the door of the <name type="FAC">Tower</name> <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>l. There <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name> sat in a grey gloom, like an old patient spider, <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> thought: he did not seem to have moved since the <name type="DATE">day</name> before. He beck<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>d <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> to a seat, but <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> was left for a while standing unheeded. Presently the old man turned to him:</p>
<p><q>'Well, Master <name type="PERSON">Pereg<name type="GPE">ri</name>n</name>, I hope that you used yester<name type="DATE">day</name> to your profit, and to your liking? Though I fear that the board is barer in this city than you could wish.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> had an uncomfortable feeling that most of what he had said or d<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> was somehow known to the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd of the <name type="LOC">City</name>, and much was guessed of what he thought as well. He did not answer.</p>
<p><q>'What would you do in my service?'</q></p>
<p><q>'I thought, sir, that you would tell me my duties.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I will, when I learn what you are fit for,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name>. <q>'But that I shall learn so<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>st, maybe, if I keep you beside me. The esquire of my chamber has begged leave to go to the out-gar<name type="GPE">ri</name>son, so you shall take his place for a while. You shall wait on me, bear errands, and talk to me, if war and council leave me any leisure. Can you sing?'</q></p>
<p><q>'Yes,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q>'Well, yes, well enough for my own people. But we have no songs fit for great halls and evil times, lord. We seldom sing of anything more ter<name type="GPE">ri</name>ble than wind or rain. And most of my songs are about things that make us laugh; or about food and d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk, of course.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="PERSON">'And</name> why should such songs be unfit for my halls, or for such <name type="TIME">hour</name>s as these? We who have lived long under the <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name> may surely lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> to echoes from a land untroubled by it? Then we may feel that our vigil was not fruitless, though it may have been thankless.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>'s heart sank. He did not relish the idea of singing any song of the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> to the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd of Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name>, certainly not the comic <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s that he knew best; they were too, well, rustic for such an occasion. He was however spared the ordeal for the present. He was not commanded to sing. <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name> turned to <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, asking questions about the Rohir<name type="GPE">ri</name>m and their policies, and the position of �omer, the king's nephew. <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> <name type="PERSON">mar</name>velled at the amount that the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd seemed to know about a people that lived far away, though it must, he thought, be <name type="DATE">many <name type="DATE">year</name>s</name> since <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name> himself had <name type="GPE">ri</name>dden abroad.</p>
<p>Presently <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name> waved to <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> and dismissed him again for a while. <q><name type="CARDINAL">'Go</name> to the armou<name type="GPE">ri</name>es of the <name type="ORG">Citadel</name>,'</q> he said, <q>'and get you there the livery and gear of the <name type="FAC">Tower</name>. It will be ready. It was commanded yester<name type="DATE">day</name>. Return when you are clad!'</q></p>
<p>It was as he said; and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> soon found himself arrayed in strange garments, all of black and silver. He had a small <name type="PERSON">hauberk</name>, its <name type="GPE">ri</name>ngs forged of steel, maybe, yet black as jet; and a high-crowned helm with small <name type="PERSON">raven</name>-wings on either side, set with a silver star in the centre of the circlet. Above the mail was a short surcoat of black, but broidered on the breast in silver with the token of the <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>. His old clothes were folded and put away, but he was permitted to keep the grey cloak of L�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en, though not to wear it when on duty. He looked now, had he known it, ve<name type="GPE">ri</name>ly _Ernil i Phe<name type="GPE">ri</name>annath_, the P<name type="GPE">ri</name>nce of the <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>flings, that folk had called him; but he felt uncomfortable. And the gloom began to weigh on his spi<name type="GPE">ri</name>ts.</p>
<p>It was dark and dim <name type="DATE">all <name type="DATE">day</name></name>. From the sunless <name type="TIME">dawn</name> until <name type="TIME">evening</name> the heavy shadow had deepened, and all hearts in the <name type="LOC">City</name> were oppressed. Far above a great cloud streamed slowly westward from the <name type="ORG">Black</name> Land, devou<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng light, borne upon a wind of war; but below the air was still and breathless, as if all the Vale of <name type="GPE">Anduin</name> waited for the onset of a ruinous storm.</p>
<p><name type="TIME">About the eleventh <name type="TIME">hour</name></name>, released at last for a while from service. <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> came out and went in search of food and d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk to cheer his heavy heart and make his task of waiting more supportable. In the messes he met <name type="PERSON">Beregond</name> again, who had just come from an errand over the <name type="ORG">Pelennor</name> out to the <name type="ORG">Guard</name>-towers upon the <name type="FAC">Causeway</name>. Together they strolled out to the walls; for <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> felt imp<name type="GPE">ri</name>s<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>d indoors, and stifled even in the lofty citadel. Now they sat side by side again in the embrasure looking eastward, where they had ea<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> and talked the <name type="DATE">day</name> before.</p>
<p>It was the sunset-<name type="TIME">hour</name>, but the great pall had now stretched far into the <name type="LOC">West</name>, and only as it sank at last into the <name type="LOC">Sea</name> did the <name type="ORG">Sun</name> escape to send out a b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ef farewell gleam before the <name type="TIME">night</name>, even as <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> saw it at the <name type="ORG">Cross</name>-roads tou<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g the head of <name type="DATE">the fall</name>en king. But to the fields of the <name type="ORG">Pelennor</name>, under the shadow of <name type="GPE">Min<name type="PERSON">dol</name>luin</name>, there came no gleam: they were brown and drear.</p>
<p>Already it seemed <name type="DATE">year</name>s to <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> since he had sat there before, in some <name type="CARDINAL">half</name>-forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> time when he had still been a hobbit, a light-hearted <name type="PERSON">wan</name>derer touched little by the pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ls he had passed through. Now he was <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> small soldier in a city prepa<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng for a great assault, clad in the proud but sombre manner of the <name type="FAC">Tower</name> of <name type="ORG">Guard</name>.</p>
<p>In some other time and place <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> might have been pleased with his new array, but he knew now that he was taking part in no play; he was in deadly earnest the servant of a g<name type="GPE">ri</name>m master in the greatest pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>l. The <name type="PERSON">hauberk</name> was burdensome, and the helm weighed upon his head. His cloak he had cast aside upon the seat. He turned his tired gaze away from the darkling fields below and yawned, and then he sighed.</p>
<p><q>'You are weary of this <name type="DATE">day</name>?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Beregond</name>.</p>
<p><q>'Yes,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>, <q>'very: tired out with idleness and waiting. I have kicked my heels at the door of my master's chamber for many slow <name type="TIME">hour</name>s, while he has debated with <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> and the P<name type="GPE">ri</name>nce and other great persons. And I'm not used, Master <name type="PERSON">Beregond</name>, to waiting hungry on others while they eat. It is a sore t<name type="GPE">ri</name>al for a hobbit, that. No doubt you will think I should feel the honour more deeply. But what is the good of such honour? Indeed what is the good even of food and d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk under this creeping shadow? What does it mean? The very air seems thick and brown! Do you of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> have such glooms when the wind is in the <name type="LOC">East</name>?'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Nay</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Beregond</name>, <q>'this is no weather of the world. This is some device of his malice; some broil of fume from the <name type="LOC">Mountain</name> of <name type="ORG">Fire</name> that he sends to darken hearts and counsel. And so it doth indeed. I wish the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name> would return. He would not be dismayed. But now, who knows if he will ever come back across the <name type="LOC">River</name> out of the <name type="PRODUCT">Darkness</name>?'</q></p>
<p><q>'Yes,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>, <q><name type="ORG">'<name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name></name>, too, is anxious. He was disappointed. I think, not to find <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name> here. And where has he got to himself? He left the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd's council before the <name type="TIME">noon</name>-meal, and in no good mood either, I thought. Perhaps he has some foreboding of bad news.'</q></p>
<p>Suddenly as they talked they were st<name type="GPE">ri</name>cken dumb, frozen as it were to lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s. <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> cowered down with his hands pressed to his ears; but <name type="PERSON">Beregond</name>, who had been looking out from the battlement as he spoke of <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name>, remained there, stif<name type="PERSON">fen</name>ed, sta<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng out with starting eyes. <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> knew the shudde<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng cry that he had heard: it was the same that he had heard <name type="DATE">long ago</name> in the <name type="ORG">Ma<name type="GPE">ri</name>sh</name> of the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>, but now it was grown in power and hatred, piercing the heart with a poisonous despair.</p>
<p>At last <name type="PERSON">Beregond</name> spoke with an effort. <q>'They have come!'</q> he said. <q>'Take courage and look! There are fell things below.'</q></p>
<p>Reluctantly <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> climbed on to the seat and looked out over the wall. The <name type="ORG">Pelennor</name> lay dim beneath him, fading away to the scarce guessed line of the <name type="LOC">Great <name type="LOC">River</name></name>. But now wheeling swiftly across it, like shadows of untimely <name type="TIME">night</name>, he saw in the middle airs below him <name type="CARDINAL">five</name> birdlike forms, hor<name type="GPE">ri</name>ble as car<name type="GPE">ri</name>on-fowl yet greater than eagles, cruel as death. Now they swooped near, ventu<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng almost within <name type="ORG">bowshot</name> of the walls, now they circled away.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="ORG">Black</name> <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s!'</q> muttered <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q>'<name type="ORG">Black</name> <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s of the air! But see, <name type="PERSON">Beregond</name>!'</q> he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed. <q>'They are looking for something, surely? See how they wheel and swoop, always down to that point over there! And can you see something moving on the ground? Dark little things. Yes, men on horses: <name type="CARDINAL">four</name> or <name type="CARDINAL">five</name>. Ah! I cannot stand it! <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>! <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> save us!'</q></p>
<p>Another long screech rose and fell, and he threw himself back again from the wall, panting like a hunted animal. Faint and seemingly remote through that shudde<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng cry he heard winding up from below the sound of a trumpet ending on a long high note.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Faramir</name>! The <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name>! It is his call!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Beregond</name>. <q>'Brave heart! But how can he win to the <name type="FAC">Gate</name>, if these foul hell-hawks have other weapons than fear? But look! They hold on. They will make the <name type="FAC">Gate</name>. No! the horses are running mad. <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok! the men are thrown; they are running on foot. No, <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> is still up, but he <name type="GPE">ri</name>des back to the others. That will be the Captain: he can master both beasts and men. Ah! there <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the foul things is stooping on him. Help! help! Will no <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> go out to him? <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name>!'</q></p>
<p>With that <name type="PERSON">Beregond</name> sprang away and ran off into the gloom. Ashamed of his terror, while <name type="PERSON">Beregond</name> of the <name type="ORG">Guard</name> thought <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> of the captain whom he loved, <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> got up and peered out. At that moment he caught a flash of white and silver coming from the <name type="LOC">North</name>, like a small star down on the <name type="TIME">dusk</name>y fields. It moved with the speed of an arrow and grew as it came, converging swiftly with the flight of the <name type="CARDINAL">four</name> men towards the <name type="FAC">Gate</name>. It seemed to <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> that a pale light was spread about it and the heavy shadows gave way before it; and then as it drew near he thought that he heard, like an echo in the walls, a great voice calling.</p>
<p><q><name type="ORG">'<name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name></name>!'</q> he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed. <q><name type="ORG">'<name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name></name>! He always turns up when things are darkest. Go on! Go on, White <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>! <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>!'</q> he shouted wildly, like an onlooker at a great race urging on a runner who is far beyond encouragement.</p>
<p>But now the dark swooping shadows were aware of the newcomer. <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> wheeled towards him; but it seemed to <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> that he raised his hand, and from it a shaft of white light stabbed upwards. The Nazg�l gave a long wailing cry and swerved away; and with that the <name type="CARDINAL">four</name> others wavered, and then <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing in swift spirals they passed away eastward vanishing into the lowe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng cloud above; and down on the <name type="ORG">Pelennor</name> it seemed for a while less dark.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> watched, and he saw the horseman and the White <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name> meet and halt, waiting for those on foot. <name type="ORG">Men</name> now hur<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed out to them from the <name type="LOC">City</name>; and soon they all passed from sight under the outer walls, and he knew that they were ente<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng the <name type="FAC">Gate</name>. Guessing that they would come at once to the <name type="FAC">Tower</name> and the <name type="ORG">Steward</name>, he hur<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed to the entrance of the citadel. There he was joined by many others who had watched the race and the rescue from the high walls.</p>
<p>It was not long before a clamour was heard in the streets leading up from the outer circles, and there was much chee<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng and crying of the names of <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name> and <name type="LOC">Mithrandir</name>. Presently <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> saw torches, and followed by a press of people <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> horsemen <name type="GPE">ri</name>ding slowly: <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> was in white but shining no longer, pale in the <name type="TIME">twilight</name> as if his fire was spent or veiled; the other was dark and his head was bowed. They dismounted, and as grooms took <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>fax and the other horse, they walked forward to the sentinel at the gate: <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> steadily, his grey cloak flung back, and a fire still smoulde<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng in his eyes; the other, clad all in green, slowly, swaying a little as a weary or a wounded man.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> pressed forward as they passed under the lamp beneath the gate-arch, and when he saw the pale face of <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name> he caught his breath. It was the face of <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> who has been assailed by a great fear or anguish, but has mastered it and now is quiet. Proud and grave he stood for a moment as he spoke to the guard, and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> gazing at him saw how closely he resembled his brother <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> � whom <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> had liked from the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>, admi<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng the great man's lordly but kindly manner. Yet suddenly for <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name> his heart was strangely moved with a feeling that he had not known before. Here was <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> with an air of high nobility such as <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> at times revealed, less high perhaps, yet also less incalculable and remote: <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>gs of <name type="ORG">Men</name> born into a later time, but touched with the wisdom and sadness of <name type="WORK_OF_ART">the Elder Race</name>. He knew now why <name type="PERSON">Beregond</name> spoke his name with love. He was a captain that men would follow, that he would follow, even under the shadow of the black wings.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Faramir</name>!'</q> he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed aloud with the others. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Faramir</name>!'</q> And <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name> cat<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g his strange voice among the clamour of the men of the <name type="LOC">City</name>, turned and looked down at him and was amazed.</p>
<p><q>'Whence come you?'</q> he said. <q>'A <name type="CARDINAL">half</name>ling, and in the livery of the <name type="FAC">Tower</name>! Whence...?'</q></p>
<p>But with that <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> stepped to his side and spoke. <q><name type="CARDINAL">'He</name> came with me from the land of the <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>flings,'</q> he said. <q><name type="CARDINAL">'He</name> came with me. But let us not tarry here. There is much to say and to do, and you are weary. He shall come with us. Indeed he must, for if he does not forget his new duties more easily than I do, he must at<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>d on his lord again within this <name type="TIME">hour</name>. <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Come</name>, <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>, follow us!'</q></p>
<p>So at length they came to the p<name type="GPE">ri</name>vate chamber of the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd of the <name type="LOC">City</name>. There deep seats were set about a brazier of charcoal; and wine was brought; and there <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>, hardly noticed, stood behind the c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>r of <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name> and felt his wea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ness little, so eagerly did he lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> to all that was said.</p>
<p>When <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name> had taken white bread and drunk a draught of wine, he sat upon a low c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>r at his father's left hand. Removed a little upon the other side sat <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> in a c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>r of <name type="PERSON">carven</name> wood; and he seemed at <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> to be asleep. For at the beginning <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name> spoke only of the errand upon which he had been sent out <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> <name type="DATE">day</name>s before, and he brought tidings of <name type="ORG">Ithil</name>ien and of movements of the Enemy and his allies; and he told of the fight on the road when the men of <name type="ORG">Harad</name> and their great beast were overthrown: a captain reporting to his master such matters as had of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> been heard before, small things of border-war that now seemed useless and petty, shorn of their renown.</p>
<p>Then suddenly <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name> looked at <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q>'But now we come to strange matters,'</q> he said. <q>'For this is not the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> <name type="CARDINAL">half</name>ling that I have seen walking out of northern legends into the <name type="LOC">South</name>lands.'</q></p>
<p>At that <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> sat up and g<name type="GPE">ri</name>pped the arms of his c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>r; but he said nothing, and with a look stopped the exclamation on <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>'s lips. <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name> looked at their faces and nodded his head, as though in sign that he had read much there before it was spoken. Slowly, while the others sat silent and still, <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name> told his tale, with his eyes for the most part on <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, though now and again his glance strayed to <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>, as if to refresh his memory of others that he had seen.</p>
<p>As his story was unfolded of his meeting with <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and his servant and of the events at <name type="ORG">Hen</name>neth <name type="PERSON">Ann�n</name>, <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> became aware that <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>'s hands were trembling as they clutched the <name type="PERSON">carven</name> wood. White they seemed now and very old, and as he looked at them, suddenly with a th<name type="GPE">ri</name>ll of fear <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> knew that <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> himself, was troubled, even afraid. The air of the room was close and still. At last when <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name> spoke of his parting with the travellers, and of their resolve to go to <name type="PERSON">Ci<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name> Ungol, his voice fell, and he shook his head and sighed. Then <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> sprang up.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Ci<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name> Ungol? <name type="PERSON">Morgul</name> Vale?'</q> he said. <q>'The time, <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name>, the time? When did you part with them? When would they reach that accursed valley?'</q></p>
<p><q>'I parted with them in the <name type="TIME">morning</name> <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> <name type="DATE">day</name>s ago,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name>. <q><name type="DATE">'It</name> is <name type="CARDINAL">fifteen</name> leagues thence to the <name type="GPE">vale</name> of the <name type="PERSON">Morgul</name>duin, if they went straight south; and then they would be still <name type="CARDINAL">five</name> leagues westward of the accursed <name type="FAC">Tower</name>. At swiftest they could not come there before to<name type="DATE">day</name>, and maybe they have not come there yet. Indeed I see what you fear. But the darkness is not due to their venture. It began yestereve, and all <name type="ORG">Ithil</name>ien was under shadow <name type="TIME">last <name type="TIME">night</name></name>. It is clear to me that the Enemy has long planned an assault on us, and its <name type="TIME">hour</name> had already been determined before ever the travellers left my keeping.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> paced the floor. <q>'<name type="TIME">The <name type="TIME">morning</name></name> of <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> <name type="DATE">day</name>s ago, nigh on <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> <name type="DATE">day</name>s of journey! <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w far is the place where you parted?'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="CARDINAL">'So</name>me <name type="CARDINAL">twenty</name>-<name type="CARDINAL">five</name> leagues as a bird flies,'</q> answered <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name>. <q>'But I could not come more swiftly. Yestereve I lay at Cair <name type="PERSON">Andros</name>, the long isle in the <name type="LOC">River</name> northward which we hold in de<name type="PERSON">fen</name>ce; and horses are kept on the hither bank. As the dark drew on I knew that haste was needed, so I rode thence with <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> others that could also be horsed. The rest of my company I sent south to strengthen the gar<name type="GPE">ri</name>son at the <name type="ORG">ford</name>s of <name type="NORP">Osgiliath</name>. I hope that I have not d<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> ill?'</q> He looked at his father.</p>
<p><q>'Ill?'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name>, and his eyes flashed suddenly. 'Why do you ask? The men were under your command. Or do you ask for my judgement on all your deeds? Your bea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng is lowly in my presence, yet it is long now since you turned from your own way at my counsel. See, you have spoken skilfully, as ever; but I, have I not seen your eye fixed on <name type="LOC">Mithrandir</name>, seeking whether you said well or too much? He has long had your heart in his keeping.</p>
<p><q><name type="CARDINAL">'My</name> son, your father is old but not yet dotard. I can see and hear, as was my wont; and little of what you have <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> said or left unsaid is now hidden from me. I know the answer to many <name type="GPE">ri</name>ddles. <name type="PERSON">Alas</name>, alas for <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>!'</q></p>
<p><q>'If what I have d<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> displeases you, my father,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name> quietly, <q>'I wish I had known your counsel before the burden of so w<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name>y a judgement was thrust on me.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Would that have availed to change your judgement?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name>. <q>'You would still have d<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> just so, I deem. I know you well. Ever your desire is to appear lordly and generous as a king of old, gracious, gentle. That may well befit <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of high race, if he sits in power and peace. But in desperate <name type="TIME">hour</name>s gentleness may be repaid with death.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="CARDINAL">'So</name> be it,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name>.</p>
<p><q><name type="CARDINAL">'So</name> be it!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name>. <q>'But not with your death only, <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name>: with the death also of your father, and of all your people, whom it is your part to protect now that <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> is g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Do you wish then,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name>, <q>'that our places had been exchanged?'</q></p>
<p><q>'Yes, I wish that indeed,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name>. <q>'For <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> was loyal to me and no wizard's pupil. He would have remembered his father's need, and would not have squandered what fortune gave. He would have brought me a mighty gift.'</q></p>
<p>For a moment <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name>'s restraint gave way. <q>'I would ask you, my father, to remember why it was that I, not he, was in <name type="ORG">Ithil</name>ien. On <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> occasion at least your counsel has prevailed, not <name type="DATE">long ago</name>. It was the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd of the <name type="LOC">City</name> that gave the errand to him.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Stir not the bitterness in the cup that I mixed for myself,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name>. <q>'Have I not tasted it now many <name type="TIME">night</name>s upon my tongue foreboding that worse yet lay in the dregs? As now indeed I find. Would it were not so! Would that this thing had come to me!'</q></p>
<p><q>'Comfort yourself!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'In no case would <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> have brought it to you. He is dead, and died well; may he sleep in peace! Yet you deceive yourself. He would have stretched out his hand to this thing, and taking it he would have fallen. He would have kept it for his own, and when he returned you would not have known your son.'</q></p>
<p>The face of <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name> set hard and cold. <q>'You found <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> less apt to your hand, did you not?'</q> he said softly. 'But I who was his father say that he would have brought it to me. You are wise, maybe, <name type="LOC">Mithrandir</name>, yet with all your subtleties you have not all wisdom. Counsels may be found that are neither the webs of wizards nor the haste of fools. I have in this matter more lore and wisdom than you deem. '</p>
<p><q>'What then is your wisdom?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>.</p>
<p><q>'Enough to perceive that there are <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> follies to avoid. To use this thing is pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>lous. At this <name type="TIME">hour</name>, to send it in the hands of a witless <name type="CARDINAL">half</name>ling into the land of the Enemy himself, as you have d<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, and this son of mine, that is madness.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="PERSON">'And</name> the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name> what would he have d<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>?'</q></p>
<p><q>'Neither. But most surely not for any argument would he have set this thing at a hazard beyond all but a fool's hope, <name type="GPE">ri</name>sking our utter ruin, if the Enemy should recover what he lost. <name type="PERSON">Nay</name>, it should have been kept, hidden, hidden dark and deep. Not used, I say, unless at the uttermost end of need, but set beyond his grasp, save by a victory so final that what then befell would not trouble us, being dead.'</q></p>
<p><q>'You think, as is your wont, my lord, of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> only,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q><name type="DATE">'Yet</name> there are other men and other lives, and time still to be. And for me, I pity even his slaves.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="PERSON">'And</name> where will other men look for help, if <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> falls?'</q> answered <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name>. <q>'If I had this thing now in the deep vaults of this citadel, we should not then shake with dread under this gloom, fea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng the worst, and our counsels would be undisturbed. If you do not trust me to endure the test, you do not know me yet.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'No</name>netheless I do not trust you,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'Had I d<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> so, I could have sent this thing hither to your keeping and spared myself and others much anguish. And now hea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng you speak I trust you less, no more than <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>. <name type="PERSON">Nay</name>, stay your wrath! I do not trust myself in this, and I refused this thing, even as a freely given gift. You are strong and can still in some matters govern yourself, <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name>; yet if you had received this thing, it would have overthrown you. Were it bu<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed beneath the roots of <name type="GPE">Min<name type="PERSON">dol</name>luin</name>, still it would burn your mind away, as the darkness grows, and the yet worse things follow that soon shall come upon us.'</q></p>
<p>For a moment the eyes of <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name> glowed again as he faced <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> felt once more the strain between their wills; but now almost it seemed as if their glances were like blades from eye to eye, flicke<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng as they <name type="PERSON">fen</name>ced. <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> trembled fea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng some dreadful stroke. But suddenly <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name> relaxed and grew cold again. He shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p><q>'If I had! If you had!'</q> he said. <q>'Such words and ifs are vain. It has g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> into the <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>, and only time will show what doom awaits it and us. The time will not be long. In what is left, let all who fight the Enemy in their fashion be at <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, and keep hope while they may, and after hope still the <name type="PERSON">hardihood</name> to die free.'</q> He turned to <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name>. <q>'What think you of the gar<name type="GPE">ri</name>son at <name type="NORP">Osgiliath</name>?'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'It</name> is not strong,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name>. <q>'I have sent the company of <name type="ORG">Ithil</name>ien to strengthen it, as I have said.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'No</name>t enough, I deem,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name>. <q><name type="DATE">'It</name> is there that the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> blow will fall. They will have need of some stout captain there.'</q></p>
<p><q>'There and elsewhere in many places,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name>, and sighed. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Alas</name> for my brother, whom I too loved!'</q> He rose. <q>'<name type="DATE">May</name> I have your leave, father?'</q> And then he swayed and leaned upon his father's c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>r.</p>
<p><q>'You are weary, I see,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name>. <q>'You have <name type="GPE">ri</name>dden fast and far, and under shadows of evil in the air, I am told.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Let us not speak of that!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name>.</p>
<p><q><name type="ORG">'Then</name> we will not,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name>. <q><name type="CARDINAL">'Go</name> now and rest as you may. <name type="PERSON">Tom</name>orrow's need will be sterner.'</q></p>
<p>All now took leave of the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd of the <name type="LOC">City</name> and went to rest while they still could. Outside there was a starless blackness as <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> with <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> beside him bea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng a small torch, made his way to their lodging. They did not speak until they were behind closed doors. Then at last <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> took <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>'s hand.</p>
<p><q>'Tell me,'</q> he said, <q>'is there any hope? For <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, I mean; or at least mostly for <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> put his hand on <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>'s head. <q>'There never was much hope,'</q> he answered. <q>'Just a fool's hope, as I have been told. And when I heard of <name type="PERSON">Ci<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name> Ungol���'</q> He broke off and strode to the window as if his eyes could pierce the <name type="TIME">night</name> in the <name type="LOC">East</name>. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Ci<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name> Ungol!'</q> he muttered. <q>'Why that way, I wonder?'</q> He turned. <q>'Just now, <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>, my heart almost failed me, hea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng that name. And yet in truth I believe that the news that <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name> b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ngs has some hope in it. For it seems clear that our Enemy has opened his war at last and made the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> move while <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> was still free. So now for many <name type="DATE">day</name>s he will have his eye turned this way and that, away from his own land. And yet, <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>, I feel from afar his haste and fear. He has begun so<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>r than he would. Something has happened to stir him.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> stood for a moment in thought. <q>'<name type="DATE">May</name>be,'</q> he muttered. <q>'<name type="DATE">May</name>be even your foolishness helped, my lad. Let me see: some <name type="CARDINAL">five</name> <name type="DATE">day</name>s ago now he would discover that we had thrown down <name type="ORG">Saruman</name> and had taken the <name type="ORG">St<name type="CARDINAL">one</name></name>. Still what of that? We could not use it to much purpose, or without his knowing. Ah! I wonder. <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>? His time draws near. And he is strong and stern underneath, <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>; bold, determined, able to take his own counsel and dare great <name type="GPE">ri</name>sks at need. That may be it. He may have used the <name type="ORG">St<name type="CARDINAL">one</name></name> and shown himself to the Enemy, challenging him, for this very purpose. I wonder. Well, we shall not know the answer till the <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> come, if they do not come too late. There are evil <name type="DATE">day</name>s ahead. To sleep while we may!'</q></p>
<p><q>'But,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>.</p>
<p><q>'But what?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'Only <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> _but_ will I allow to<name type="TIME">night</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="CARDINAL">'Go</name>llum,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w on <name type="LOC">earth</name> could they be going about _with_ him, even following him? And I could see that <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name> did not like the place he was taking them to any more than you do. What is wrong?'</q></p>
<p><q>'I cannot answer that now,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <name type="DATE">'Yet</name> my heart guessed that <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> would meet before the end. For good, or for evil. But of <name type="PERSON">Ci<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name> Ungol I will not speak to<name type="TIME">night</name>. Treachery, treachery I fear; treachery of that miserable creature. But so it must be. Let us remember that a traitor may betray himself and do good that he does not in<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>d. It can be so, sometimes. <name type="TIME">Good <name type="TIME">night</name></name>! '</p>
<p><name type="DATE">The next <name type="DATE">day</name></name> came with <name type="TIME">a <name type="TIME">morning</name></name> like a brown <name type="TIME">dusk</name>, and the hearts of men, lifted for a while by the return of <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name>, sank low again. The winged <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>s were not seen again that <name type="DATE">day</name>, yet ever and anon, high above the city, a faint cry would come, and many who heard it would stand st<name type="GPE">ri</name>cken with a passing dread, while the less stout-hearted quailed and wept.</p>
<p>And now <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name> was g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> again. <q>'They give him no rest,'</q> some murmured. <q>'The <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ves his son too hard, and now he must do the duty of <name type="CARDINAL">two</name>, for himself and for the <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> that will not return.'</q> And ever men looked northward, asking: <q>'Where are the <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>?'</q></p>
<p>In truth <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name> did not go by his own choosing. But the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd of the <name type="LOC">City</name> was master of his <name type="ORG">Council</name>, and he was in no mood that <name type="DATE">day</name> to bow to others. <name type="TIME">Early in the <name type="TIME">morning</name></name> the <name type="ORG">Council</name> had been summ<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>d. There all the captains judged that because of the threat in the <name type="LOC">South</name> their force was too weak to make any stroke of war on their own part, unless perchance the <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> yet should come. Meanwhile they must man the walls and wait.</p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'Yet</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name>, <q>'we should not lightly abandon the outer de<name type="PERSON">fen</name>ces, the <name type="ORG">Rammas</name> made with so great a labour. And the Enemy must pay dearly for the crossing of the <name type="LOC">River</name>. That he cannot do, in force to assail the <name type="LOC">City</name>, either north of Cair <name type="PERSON">Andros</name> because of the <name type="PERSON">mar</name>shes, or southwards towards <name type="ORG">Lebennin</name> because of the breadth of the <name type="LOC">River</name>, that needs many boats. It is at <name type="NORP">Osgiliath</name> that he will put his w<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name>, as before when <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> denied him the passage.'</q></p>
<p><q>'That was but a t<name type="GPE">ri</name>al,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name>. <q>'<name type="DATE">To<name type="DATE">day</name></name> we may make the Enemy pay <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> times our loss at the passage and yet rue the exchange. For he can af<name type="ORG">ford</name> to lose a host better than we to lose a company. And the retreat of those that we put out far afield will be pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>lous, if he wins across in force.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="PERSON">'And</name> what of Cair <name type="PERSON">Andros</name>?'</q> said the P<name type="GPE">ri</name>nce. <q>'That, too, must be held, if <name type="NORP">Osgiliath</name> is de<name type="PERSON">fen</name>ded. Let us not forget the danger on our left. The Rohir<name type="GPE">ri</name>m may come, and they may not. But <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name> has told us of great strength drawing ever to the <name type="ORG">Black</name> <name type="FAC">Gate</name>. <name type="CARDINAL">More than <name type="CARDINAL">one</name></name> host may issue from it, and st<name type="GPE">ri</name>ke for <name type="CARDINAL">more than <name type="CARDINAL">one</name></name> passage.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Much must be <name type="GPE">ri</name>sked in war,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name>. <q>'Cair <name type="PERSON">Andros</name> is manned and no more can be sent so far. But I will not yield the <name type="LOC">River</name> and the <name type="ORG">Pelennor</name> unfought � not if there is a captain here who has still the courage to do his lord's will.'</q></p>
<p>Then all were silent, but at length <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name> said: <q>'I do not oppose your will, sire. Since you are robbed of <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>, I will go and do what I can in his stead � if you command it.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I do so,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name>.</p>
<p><q><name type="ORG">'Then</name> farewell!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name>. <q>'But if I should return, think better of me!'</q></p>
<p><q>'That depends on the manner of your return,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name>.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> it was that last spoke to <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name> ere he rode east. <q>'Do not throw your live away rashly or in bitterness,'</q> he said. <q>'You will be needed here, for other things than war. Your father loves you, <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name>, and will remember it ere the end. <name type="PERSON">Farewell</name>!'</q></p>
<p>So now the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name> had g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> forth again, and had taken with him such strength of men as were willing to go or could be spared. On the walls some gazed through the gloom towards the ruined city, and they wondered what chanced there, for nothing could be seen. And others, as ever, looked north and counted the leagues to Th�oden in <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>. <q>'Will he come? Will he remember our old alliance?'</q> they said.</p>
<p><q>'Yes, he will come,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, <q>'even if he comes too late. But think! At best the <name type="ORG">Red Arrow</name> cannot have reached him <name type="CARDINAL">more than <name type="CARDINAL">two</name></name> <name type="DATE">day</name>s ago, and the miles are long from <name type="ORG">Edoras</name>.'</q></p>
<p>It was <name type="TIME">night</name> again ere news came. A man rode in haste from the <name type="ORG">ford</name>s, saying that a host had issued from Minas <name type="PERSON">Morgul</name> and was already drawing nigh to <name type="NORP">Osgiliath</name>; and it had been joined by regiments from the <name type="LOC">South</name>, <name type="ORG">Harad</name><name type="GPE">ri</name>m, cruel and tall. <q><name type="PERSON">'And</name> we have learned ' said the messenger, 'that the <name type="ORG">Black</name> Captain leads them once again, and the fear of him has passed before him over the <name type="LOC">River</name>.'</q></p>
<p>With those ill-boding words the <name type="ORDINAL">third</name> <name type="DATE">day</name> closed since <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> came to Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name>. Few went to rest, for small hope had any now that even <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name> could hold the <name type="ORG">ford</name>s for long.</p>
<p><name type="DATE">The next <name type="DATE">day</name></name>, though the darkness had reached its full and grew no deeper, it weighed heavier on men's hearts, and a great dread was on them. Ill news came soon again. The passage of <name type="GPE">Anduin</name> was won by the Enemy. <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name> was retreating to the wall of the <name type="ORG">Pelennor</name>, rallying his men to the <name type="FAC">Causeway</name> Forts; but he was <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> times outnumbered.</p>
<p><q>'If he wins back at all across the <name type="ORG">Pelennor</name>, his enemies will be on his heels,'</q> said the messenger. <q>'They have paid dear for the crossing but less dearly than we hoped. The plan has been well laid. It is now seen that in <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret they have long been building floats and barges in great numbers in <name type="LOC">East</name> <name type="NORP">Osgiliath</name>. They swarmed across like beetles. But it is the <name type="ORG">Black</name> Captain that defeats us. Few will stand and abide even the rumour of his coming. His own folk quail at him, and they would slay themselves at his bidding.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="ORG">'Then</name> I am needed there more than here,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, and rode off at once, and the glimmer of him faded soon from sight. And all that <name type="TIME">night</name> <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> and sleepless stood upon the wall and gazed eastward.</p>
<p>The bells of <name type="DATE">day</name> had scarcely rung out again, a mockery in the unligh<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed dark, when far away he saw fires sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng up, across in the dim spaces where the walls of the <name type="ORG">Pelennor</name> stood. The watchmen c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed aloud, and all men in the <name type="LOC">City</name> stood to arms. Now ever and anon there was a red flash, and slowly through the heavy air dull rumbles could be heard.</p>
<p><q>'They have taken the wall!'</q> men c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed. <q>'They are blasting breaches in it. They are coming!'</q></p>
<p><q>'Where is <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name>?'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Beregond</name> in dismay. <q>'Say not that he has fallen!'</q></p>
<p>It was <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> that brought the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> tidings. With a handful of horsemen he came in the middle <name type="TIME">morning</name>, <name type="GPE">ri</name>ding as escort to a line of <name type="PERSON">wain</name>s. They were filled with wounded men, all that could be saved from the wreck of the <name type="FAC">Causeway</name> Forts. At once he went to <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name>. The <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd of the <name type="LOC">City</name> sat now in a high chamber above the <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>l of the White <name type="FAC">Tower</name> with <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> at his side; and through the dim windows, north and south and east, he bent his dark eyes, as if to pierce the shadows of doom that <name type="GPE">ri</name>nged him round. Most to the north he looked, and would pause at whiles to lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> as if by some ancient art his ears might hear the thunder of hoofs on the plains far away.</p>
<p><q>'Is <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name> come?'</q> he asked.</p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'No</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'But he still lived when I left him. Yet he is resolved to stay with the rearguard, lest the retreat over the <name type="ORG">Pelennor</name> become a rout. He may, perhaps, hold his men together long enough, but I doubt it. He is pitted against a foe too great. For <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> has come that I feared.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'No</name>t � the Dark <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd?'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>, forgetting his place in his terror.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Denethor</name> laughed bitterly. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Nay</name>, not yet, Master <name type="PERSON">Pereg<name type="GPE">ri</name>n</name>! He will not come save only to t<name type="GPE">ri</name>umph over me when all is won. He uses others as his weapons. So do all great lords, if they are wise, Master <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>fling. Or why should I sit here in my tower and think, and watch, and wait, spending even my sons? For I can still wield a brand.'</q></p>
<p>He stood up and cast open his long black cloak, and behold! he was clad in mail beneath, and girt with a long sword, great-hilted in a sheath of black and silver. <q>'Thus have I walked, and thus now for <name type="DATE">many <name type="DATE">year</name>s</name> have I slept,'</q> he said, <q>'lest with age the body should grow soft and timid.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'Yet</name> now under the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd of <name type="FAC">Barad-d</name>�r the most fell of all his captains is already master of your outer walls,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g of Ang<name type="PERSON">mar</name> <name type="DATE">long ago</name>, <name type="PERSON">Sorcerer</name>, <name type="ORG">Ring</name>wraith, <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd of the Nazg�l, a spear of terror in the hand of <name type="ORG">Sauron</name>, shadow of despair.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="ORG">'Then</name>, <name type="LOC">Mithrandir</name>, you had a foe to match you,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name>. <q>'For myself, I have long known who is the chief captain of the hosts of the Dark <name type="FAC">Tower</name>. Is this all that you have returned to say? Or can it be that you have withdrawn because you are overmatched?'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> trembled, fea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng that <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> would be stung to sudden wrath, but his fear was needless. <q><name type="DATE">'It</name> might be so,'</q> <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> answered softly. 'But our t<name type="GPE">ri</name>al of strength is not yet come. And if words spoken of old be true, not by the hand of man shall he fall, and hidden from the <name type="PERSON">Wise</name> is the doom that awaits him. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>wever that may be, the Captain of Despair does not press forward, yet. He rules rather according to the wisdom that you have just spoken, from the rear, d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ving his slaves in madness on before.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Nay</name>, I came rather to guard the hurt men that can yet be healed; for the <name type="ORG">Rammas</name> is breached far and wide, and soon the host of <name type="PERSON">Morgul</name> will enter in at many points. And I came chiefly to say this. Soon there will be battle on the fields. A sortie must be made ready. Let it be of mounted men. In them lies our b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ef hope, for in <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> thing only is the enemy still poorly provided: he has few horsemen.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="PERSON">'And</name> we also have few. Now would the coming of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> be in the <name type="GPE">nick</name> of time,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name>.</p>
<p><q>'We are likely to see other newcomers <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'Fugitives from Cair <name type="PERSON">Andros</name> have already reached us. The isle has fallen. Another army is come from the <name type="ORG">Black</name> <name type="FAC">Gate</name>, crossing from the north-east.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="CARDINAL">'So</name>me have accused you, <name type="LOC">Mithrandir</name>, of delighting to bear ill news,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name>, <q>'but to me this is no longer news: it was known to me ere <name type="TIME">night</name>fall yester<name type="DATE">day</name>. As for the sortie, I had already given thought to it. Let us go down.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Tim</name>e passed. At length watchers on the walls could see the retreat of the out-companies. Small bands of weary and of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> wounded men came <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> with little order; some were running wildly as if pursued. Away to the eastward the distant fires flickered; and now it seemed that here and there they crept across the plain. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>uses and barns were burning. Then from many points little <name type="GPE">ri</name>vers of red flame came hurrying on, winding through the gloom, converging towards the line of the broad road that led from the <name type="LOC">City</name>-gate to <name type="NORP">Osgiliath</name>.</p>
<p><q>'The enemy,'</q> men murmured. <q>'The dike is down. Here they come pou<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng through the breaches! And they carry torches, it seems. Where are our own folk?'</q></p>
<p>It drew now to <name type="TIME">evening</name> by the <name type="TIME">hour</name>, and the light was so dim that even far-sighted men upon the <name type="ORG">Citadel</name> could discern little clearly out upon the fields, save only the burnings that ever multiplied, and the lines of fire that grew in length and speed. At last, less than <name type="QUANTITY">a mile</name> from the <name type="LOC">City</name>, a more ordered mass of men came into view, <name type="PERSON">mar</name><name type="PERSON">chin</name>g not running, still holding together.</p>
<p>The watchers held their breath. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Faramir</name> must be there,'</q> they said. <q><name type="CARDINAL">'He</name> can govern man and beast. He will make it yet.'</q></p>
<p>Now the main retreat was scarcely <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> furlongs distant. Out of the gloom behind a small company of horsemen galloped, all that was left of the rearguard. Once again they turned at bay, facing the oncoming lines of fire. Then suddenly there was a tumult of fierce c<name type="GPE">ri</name>es. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>rsemen of the enemy swept up. The lines of fire became flowing torrents, file upon file of <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s bea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng flames, and wild <name type="LOC">South</name>ron men with red banners, shouting with harsh tongues, surging up, overtaking the retreat. And with a piercing cry out of the dim sky fell the winged shadows, the Nazg�l stooping to the kill.</p>
<p>The retreat became a rout. Already men were breaking away, flying wild and witless here and there, flinging away their weapons, crying out in fear, falling to the ground.</p>
<p>And then a trumpet rang from the <name type="ORG">Citadel</name>, and <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name> at last released the sortie. Drawn up within the shadow of the <name type="FAC">Gate</name> and under the looming walls outside they had waited for his signal: all the mounted men that were left in the <name type="LOC">City</name>. Now they sprang forward, formed, quickened to a gallop, and charged with a great shout. And from the walls an answe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng shout went up; for foremost on the field rode the <name type="PERSON">s<name type="PERSON">wan</name></name>-k<name type="TIME">night</name>s of Dol <name type="PERSON">Amroth</name> with their P<name type="GPE">ri</name>nce and his blue banner at their head.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Amroth</name> for <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>!'</q> they c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Amroth</name> to <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name>!'</q></p>
<p>Like thunder they broke upon the enemy on either flank of the retreat; but <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> <name type="GPE">ri</name>der outran them all, swift as the wind in the grass: <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>fax bore him, shining, unveiled once more, a light starting from his upraised hand.</p>
<p>The Nazg�l screeched and swept away, for their Captain was not yet come to challenge the white fire of his foe. The hosts of <name type="PERSON">Morgul</name> in<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>t on their prey, taken at unawares in wild career, broke, scatte<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng like sparks in a gale. The out-companies with a great cheer turned and smote their pursuers. <name type="PERSON">Hunt</name>ers became the hunted. The retreat became an onslaught. The field was strewn with st<name type="GPE">ri</name>cken orcs and men, and a <name type="GPE">reek</name> arose of torches cast away, sputte<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng out in swirling smoke. The cavalry rode on.</p>
<p>But <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name> did not permit them to go far. Though the enemy was checked, and for the moment d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ven back, great forces were flowing in from the <name type="LOC">East</name>. Again the trumpet rang, sounding the retreat. The cavalry of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> halted. Behind their screen the out-companies re-formed. Now steadily they came <name type="PERSON">mar</name><name type="PERSON">chin</name>g back. They reached the <name type="FAC">Gate</name> of the <name type="LOC">City</name> and entered, stepping proudly: and proudly the people of the <name type="LOC">City</name> looked on them and c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed their praise, and yet they were troubled in heart. For the companies were g<name type="GPE">ri</name>evously reduced. <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name> had lost <name type="CARDINAL">a <name type="ORDINAL">third</name></name> of his men. And where was he?</p>
<p>Last of all he came. His men passed in. The mounted k<name type="TIME">night</name>s returned, and at their rear the banner of Dol <name type="PERSON">Amroth</name>, and the P<name type="GPE">ri</name>nce. And in his arms before him on his horse he bore the body of his kinsman, <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name> son of <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name>, found upon the st<name type="GPE">ri</name>cken field.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Faramir</name>! <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name>!'</q> men c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed, weeping in the streets. But he did not answer, and they bore him away up the winding road to the <name type="ORG">Citadel</name> and his father. Even as the Nazg�l had swerved aside from the onset of the White <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>, there came flying a deadly dart, and <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name>, as he held at bay a mounted champion of <name type="ORG">Harad</name>, had fallen to the <name type="LOC">earth</name>. Only the charge of Dol <name type="PERSON">Amroth</name> had saved him from the red southland swords that would have hewed him as he lay.</p>
<p>The P<name type="GPE">ri</name>nce <name type="PERSON">Imrahil</name> brought <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name> to the White <name type="FAC">Tower</name>, and he said: Your son has returned, lord, after great deeds, and he told all that he had seen. But <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name> rose and looked on the face of his son and was silent. Then he bade them make a bed in the chamber and lay <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name> upon it and depart. But he himself went up al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> into the <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret room under the summit of the <name type="FAC">Tower</name>; and many who looked up thither at that time saw a pale light that gleamed and flickered from the narrow windows for a while, and then flashed and went out. And when <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name> descended again he went to <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name> and sat beside him without speaking, but the face of the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd was grey, more deathlike than his son's.</p>
<p>So now at last the <name type="LOC">City</name> was besieged, enclosed in a <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng of foes. The <name type="ORG">Rammas</name> was broken, and all the <name type="ORG">Pelennor</name> aband<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>d to the Enemy. The last word to come from outside the walls was brought by men flying down the northward road ere the <name type="FAC">Gate</name> was shut. They were the remnant of the guard that was kept at that point where the way from <name type="PERSON">An�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en</name> and <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> ran into the townlands: <name type="PERSON">Ingold</name> led them, the same who had admitted <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> less than <name type="CARDINAL">five</name> <name type="DATE">day</name>s before, while the sun still rose and there was hope in the <name type="TIME">morning</name>.</p>
<p><q>'There is no news of the Rohir<name type="GPE">ri</name>m,'</q> he said. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> will not come now. Or if they come, it will not avail us. The new host that we had tidings of has come <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>, from over the <name type="LOC">River</name> by way of <name type="PERSON">Andros</name>, it is said. They are strong: battalions of <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s of the <name type="PRODUCT">Eye</name>, and countless companies of <name type="ORG">Men</name> of a new sort that we have not met before. Not tall, but broad and g<name type="GPE">ri</name>m, bearded like dwarves, wielding great axes. Out of some savage land in the wide <name type="LOC">East</name> they come, we deem. They hold the northward road; and many have passed on into <name type="PERSON">An�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en</name>. The Rohir<name type="GPE">ri</name>m cannot come.'</q></p>
<p>The <name type="FAC">Gate</name> was shut. <name type="TIME">All <name type="TIME">night</name></name> watchmen on the walls heard the rumour of the enemy that roamed outside, burning field and tree, and hewing any man that they found abroad, living or dead. The numbers that had already passed over the <name type="LOC">River</name> could not be guessed in the darkness, but when <name type="TIME">morning</name>, or its dim shadow, stole over the plain, it was seen that even fear by <name type="TIME">night</name> had scarcely over-counted them. The plain was dark with their <name type="PERSON">mar</name><name type="PERSON">chin</name>g companies, and as far as eyes could strain in the mirk there sprouted, like a foul fungus-growth, all about the beleaguered city great camps of <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ts, black or sombre red.</p>
<p>Busy as ants hurrying orcs were digging, digging lines of deep trenches in a huge <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng, just out of <name type="ORG">bowshot</name> from the walls; and as the trenches were made each was filled with fire, though how it was kindled or <name type="ORG">fed</name>, by art or devilry, n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> could see. <name type="DATE">All <name type="DATE">day</name></name> the labour went forward, while the men of Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name> looked on, unable to hinder it. And as each length of trench was completed, they could see great <name type="PERSON">wain</name>s approa<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g; and soon yet more companies of the enemy were swiftly setting up, each behind the cover of a trench, great engines for the casting of missiles. There were n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> upon the <name type="LOC">City</name> walls large enough to reach so far or to stay the work.</p>
<p>At <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> men laughed and did not greatly fear such devices. For the main wall of the <name type="LOC">City</name> was of great h<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name> and <name type="PERSON">mar</name>vellous thickness, built ere the power and craft of N�menor <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ed in exile; and its outward face was like to the <name type="FAC">Tower</name> of <name type="PERSON">Orthanc</name>, hard and dark and smooth, unconquerable by steel or fire, unbreakable except by some convulsion that would rend the very <name type="LOC">earth</name> on which it stood.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Nay</name>,'</q> they said, <q>'not if the Nameless <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> himself should come, not even he could enter here while we yet live.'</q> But some answered: <q>'While we yet live? <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w long? He has a weapon that has brought low many strong places since the world began. Hunger. The roads are cut. <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> will not come.'</q></p>
<p>But the engines did not waste shot upon the indomitable wall. It was no b<name type="GPE">ri</name>gand or orc-chieftain that ordered the assault upon the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>'s greatest foe. A power and mind of malice guided it. As soon as the great catapults were set, with many yells and the creaking of rope and winch, they began to throw missiles <name type="PERSON">mar</name>vellously high, so that they passed <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght above the battlement and fell thudding within the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> circle of the <name type="LOC">City</name>; and many of them by some <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret art burst into flame as they came toppling down.</p>
<p>Soon there was great pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>l of fire behind the wall, and all who could be spared were busy quelling the flames that sprang up in many places. Then among the greater casts there fell another <name type="PERSON">hai</name>l, less ruinous but more hor<name type="GPE">ri</name>ble. All about the streets and lanes behind the <name type="FAC">Gate</name> it tumbled down, small round shot that did not burn. But when men ran to learn what it might be, they c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed aloud or wept. For the enemy was flinging into the <name type="LOC">City</name> all the heads of those who had fallen fighting at <name type="NORP">Osgiliath</name>, or on the <name type="ORG">Rammas</name>, or in the fields. They were g<name type="GPE">ri</name>m to look on; for though some were crushed and shapeless, and some had been cruelly hewn, yet many had features that could be told, and it seemed that they had died in pain; and all were branded with the foul token of the Lidless <name type="PRODUCT">Eye</name>. But <name type="PERSON">mar</name>red and dishonoured as they were, it of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> chanced that thus a man would see again the face of some<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> that he had known, who had walked proudly once in arms, or tilled the fields, or <name type="GPE">ri</name>dden in upon <name type="DATE">a holi<name type="DATE">day</name></name> from the green <name type="GPE">vale</name>s in the <name type="ORG">hill</name>s.</p>
<p>In vain men shook their fists at the pitiless foes that swarmed before the <name type="FAC">Gate</name>. Curses they heeded not, nor understood the tongues of western men; crying with harsh voices like beasts and car<name type="GPE">ri</name>on-birds. But soon there were few left in Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name> who had the heart to stand up and defy the hosts of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>. For yet another weapon, swifter than hunger, the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd of the Dark <name type="FAC">Tower</name> had: dread and despair.</p>
<p>The Nazg�l came again, and as their Dark <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd now grew and put forth his strength, so their voices, which uttered only his will and his malice, were filled with evil and horror. Ever they circled above the <name type="LOC">City</name>, like vultures that expect their fill of doomed men's flesh. Out of sight and shot they flew, and yet were ever present, and their deadly voices rent the air. More unbearable they became, not less, at each new cry. At length even the stout-hearted would fling themselves to the ground as the hidden menace passed over them, or they would stand, letting their weapons fall from nerveless hands while into their minds a blackness came, and they thought no more of war, but only of hiding and of crawling, and of death.</p>
<p>Du<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng all this black <name type="DATE">day</name> <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name> lay upon his bed in the chamber of the White <name type="FAC">Tower</name>, <name type="PERSON">wan</name>de<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng in a desperate fever; dying some<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> said, and soon 'dying' all men were saying upon the walls and in the streets. And by him his father sat, and said nothing, but watched, and gave no longer any heed to the de<name type="PERSON">fen</name>ce.</p>
<p><name type="TIME">No <name type="TIME">hour</name>s</name> so dark had <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> known, not even in the clutches of the <name type="PERSON">Uruk-<name type="PERSON">hai</name></name>. It was his duty to wait upon the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd, and wait he did, forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> it seemed, standing by the door of the unlit chamber, maste<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng his own fears as best he could. And as he watched, it seemed to him that <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name> grew old before his eyes, as if something had snapped in his proud will, and his stern mind was overthrown. G<name type="GPE">ri</name>ef maybe had wrought it, and remorse. He saw tears on that once tearless face, more unbearable than wrath.</p>
<p><q>'Do not weep, lord,'</q> he stammered. <q>'Perhaps he will get well. Have you asked <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>?'</q></p>
<p><q>'Comfort me not with wizards!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name>. 'The fool's hope has failed. The Enemy has found it, and now his power waxes; he sees our very thoughts, and all we do is ruinous.</p>
<p><q>'I sent my son forth, unthanked, unblessed, out into needless pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>l, and here he lies with poison in his veins. <name type="PERSON">Nay</name>, nay, whatever may now betide in war, my line too is ending, even the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>use of the <name type="ORG">Steward</name>s has failed. Mean folk shall rule the last remnant of the <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>gs of <name type="ORG">Men</name>, lurking in the <name type="ORG">hill</name>s until all are hounded out.'</q></p>
<p><name type="ORG">Men</name> came to the door crying for the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd of the <name type="LOC">City</name>. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Nay</name>, I will not come down,'</q> he said. <q>'I must stay beside my son. He might still speak before the end. But that is near. Follow whom you will, even the <name type="ORG">Grey</name> Fool, though his hope has failed. Here I stay.'</q></p>
<p>So it was that <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> took command of the last de<name type="PERSON">fen</name>ce of the <name type="LOC">City</name> of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>. Wherever he came men's hearts would lift again, and the winged shadows pass from memory. <name type="PERSON">Tirelessly</name> he strode from <name type="ORG">Citadel</name> to <name type="FAC">Gate</name>, from north to south about the wall; and with him went the P<name type="GPE">ri</name>nce of Dol <name type="PERSON">Amroth</name> in his shining mail. For he and his k<name type="TIME">night</name>s still held themselves like lords in whom the race of N�menor ran true. <name type="ORG">Men</name> that saw them whispered saying: <q>'Belike the old tales speak well; there is <name type="PERSON">Elvish</name> blood in the veins of that folk, for the people of <name type="PERSON">Nimrodel</name> dwelt in that land once <name type="DATE">long ago</name>.'</q> And then <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> would sing amid the gloom some staves of the Lay of <name type="PERSON">Nimrodel</name>, or other songs of the Vale of <name type="GPE">Anduin</name> out of vanished <name type="DATE">year</name>s.</p>
<p>And yet � when they had g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, the shadows closed on men again, and their hearts went cold, and the valour of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> withered into ash. And so slowly they passed out of <name type="DATE">a dim <name type="DATE">day</name></name> of fears into the darkness of <name type="TIME">a desperate <name type="TIME">night</name></name>. <name type="ORG">Fire</name>s now raged unchecked in the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> circle of the <name type="LOC">City</name>, and the gar<name type="GPE">ri</name>son upon the outer wall was already in many places cut off from retreat. But the faithful who remained there at their posts were few; most had fled beyond the <name type="ORG">sec</name>ond gate.</p>
<p>Far behind the battle the <name type="LOC">River</name> had been swiftly b<name type="GPE">ri</name>dged, and <name type="DATE">all <name type="DATE">day</name></name> more force and gear of war had poured across. Now at last in the middle <name type="TIME">night</name> the assault was loosed. The vanguard passed through the trenches of fire by many devious paths that had been left between them. On they came, reckless of their loss as they approached, still bunched and herded, within the range of bowmen on the wall. But indeed there were too few now left there to do them great damage, though the light of the fires showed up many a <name type="PERSON">mar</name>k for archers of such skill as <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> once had boasted. Then perceiving that the valour of the <name type="LOC">City</name> was already bea<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> down, the hidden Captain put forth his strength. Slowly the great siege-towers built in <name type="NORP">Osgiliath</name> rolled forward through the dark.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Messenger</name>s came again to the chamber in the White <name type="FAC">Tower</name>, and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> let them enter, for they were urgent. <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name> turned his head slowly from <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name>'s face, and looked at them silently.</p>
<p><q>'The <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> circle of the <name type="LOC">City</name> is burning, lord,'</q> they said. <q>'What are your commands? You are still the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd and <name type="ORG">Steward</name>. Not all will follow <name type="LOC">Mithrandir</name>. <name type="ORG">Men</name> are flying from the walls and leaving them unmanned.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Why? Why do the fools fly?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name>. <q>'Better to burn so<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>r than late, for burn we must. Go back to your bonfire! And I? I will go now to my pyre. To my pyre! No <name type="PERSON">tom</name>b for <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name> and <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name>. No <name type="PERSON">tom</name>b! No long slow sleep of death embalmed. We will burn like heathen kings before ever a ship sailed hither from the <name type="LOC">West</name>. The <name type="LOC">West</name> has failed. Go back and burn!'</q></p>
<p>The messengers without bow or answer turned and fled.</p>
<p>Now <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name> stood up and released the fevered hand of <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name> that he had held. <q><name type="CARDINAL">'He</name> is burning, already burning,'</q> he said sadly. <q>'The house of his spi<name type="GPE">ri</name>t crumbles.'</q> Then stepping softly towards <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> he looked down at him.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Farewell</name>!'</q> he said. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Farewell</name>, <name type="PERSON">Pereg<name type="GPE">ri</name>n</name> son of <name type="PERSON">Paladin</name>! Your service has been short, and now it is drawing to an end. I release you from the little that remains. Go now, and die in what way seems best to you. And with whom you will, even that f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end whose folly brought you to this death. Send for my servants and then go. <name type="PERSON">Farewell</name>!'</q></p>
<p><q>'I will not say farewell, my lord,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> kneeling. And then suddenly hobbit-like once more, he stood up and looked the old man in the eyes. <q>'I will take your leave, sir,'</q> he said; <q>'for I <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t to see <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> very much indeed. But he is no fool; and I will not think of dying until he despairs of life. But from my word and your service I do not wish to be released while you live. And if they come at last to the <name type="ORG">Citadel</name>, I hope to be here and stand beside you and earn perhaps the arms that you have given me.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Do as you will, Master <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>fling,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name>. <q>'But my life is broken. Send for my servants!'</q> He turned back to <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name>.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> left him and called for the servants, and they came: <name type="CARDINAL">six</name> men of the household, strong and fair; yet they trembled at the summons. But in a quiet voice <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name> bade them lay warm coverlets on <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name>'s bed and take it up. And they did so, and lifting up the bed they bore it from the chamber. Slowly they paced to trouble the fevered man as little as might be, and <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name>, now bending on a staff, followed them; and last came <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>.</p>
<p>Out from the White <name type="FAC">Tower</name> they walked, as if to a funeral, out into the darkness, where the overhanging cloud was lit beneath with flickers of dull red. Softly they paced the great courtyard, and at a word from <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name> halted beside the Withered <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>.</p>
<p>All was silent, save for the rumour of war in the <name type="LOC">City</name> down below, and they heard the water d<name type="GPE">ri</name>pping sadly from the dead branches into the dark pool. Then they went on through the <name type="ORG">Citadel</name> gate, where the sentinel stared at them in wonder and dismay as they passed by. Turning westward they came at length to a door in the rearward wall of the <name type="CARDINAL">six</name>th circle. <name type="PERSON">Fen <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>llen</name> it was called, for it was kept ever shut save at times of funeral, and only the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd of the <name type="LOC">City</name> might use that way, or those who bore the token of the <name type="PERSON">tom</name>bs and <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ded the houses of the dead. Beyond it went a winding road that descended in many curves down to the narrow land under the shadow of <name type="GPE">Min<name type="PERSON">dol</name>luin</name>'s precipice where stood the mansions of the dead <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>gs and of their <name type="ORG">Steward</name>s.</p>
<p>A porter sat in a little house beside the way, and with fear in his eyes he came forth bea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng a lantern in his hand. At the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd's command he unlocked the door, and silently it swung back; and they passed through, taking the lantern from his hand. It was dark on the climbing road between ancient walls and many-pillared balusters looming in the swaying lantern-beam. Their slow feet echoed as they walked down, down, until at last they came to <name type="FAC">the Silent Street</name>, <name type="ORG">Rath D�nen</name>, between pale domes and empty halls and images of men long dead; and they entered into the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>use of the <name type="ORG">Steward</name>s and set down their burden.</p>
<p>There <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>, sta<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng uneasily about him, saw that he was in a wide vaulted chamber, draped as it were with the great shadows that the little lantern threw upon its shrouded walls. And dimly to be seen were many rows of tables, carved of <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ble; and upon each table lay a sleeping form, hands folded, head pillowed upon st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. But <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> table near at hand stood broad and bare. Upon it at a sign from <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name> they laid <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name> and his father side by side, and covered them with <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> cove<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng, and stood then with bowed heads as mourners beside a bed of death. Then <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name> spoke in a low voice.</p>
<p><q><name type="CARDINAL">'He</name>re we will wait,'</q> he said. <q>'But send not for the embalmers. B<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng us wood quick to burn, and lay it all about us, and beneath; and pour oil upon it. And when I bid you thrust in a torch. Do this and speak no more to me. <name type="PERSON">Farewell</name>!'</q></p>
<p><q>'By your leave, lord!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> and turned and fled in terror from the deathly house. <q><name type="ORG">'Poor</name> <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name>!'</q> he thought. <q>'I must find <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. Poor <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name>! Quite likely he needs medicine more than tears. Oh, where can I find <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>? In the thick of things, I suppose; and he will have no time to spare for dying men or madmen.'</q></p>
<p>At the door he turned to <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the servants who had remained on guard there. <q>'Your master is not himself,'</q> he said. <q><name type="CARDINAL">'Go</name> slow! B<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng no fire to this place while <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name> lives! Do nothing until <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> comes!'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="CARDINAL">'Who</name> is the master of Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name>?'</q> the man answered. <q>'The <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name> or the <name type="ORG">Grey</name> Wanderer?'</q></p>
<p><q>'The <name type="ORG">Grey</name> Wanderer or no <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, it would seem,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>, and he sped back and up the winding way as swiftly as his feet would carry him, past the astonished porter, out through the door, and on, till he came near the gate of the <name type="ORG">Citadel</name>. The sentinel <name type="PERSON">hai</name>led him as he went by, and he recognized the voice of <name type="PERSON">Beregond</name>.</p>
<p><q>'Whither do you run, Master <name type="PERSON">Pereg<name type="GPE">ri</name>n</name>?'</q> he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed.</p>
<p><q>'To find <name type="LOC">Mithrandir</name>,'</q> <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> answered.</p>
<p><q>'The <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd's errands are urgent and should not be hindered by me,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Beregond</name>; <q>'but tell me quickly, if you may: what goes forward? Whither has my <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>? I have just come on duty, but I heard that he passed towards the Closed <name type="ORG">Door</name>, and men were bea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name> before him.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Yes,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>, <q>'to <name type="FAC">the Silent Street</name>.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Beregond</name> bowed his head to hide his tears. <q>'They said that he was dying,'</q> he sighed, <q>'and now he is dead.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'No</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>, <q>'not yet. And even now his death might be prevented, I think. But the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd of the <name type="LOC">City</name>, <name type="PERSON">Beregond</name>, has fallen before his city is taken. He is fey and dangerous.'</q> Quickly he told of <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name>'s strange words and deeds. <q>'I must find <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> at once.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="ORG">'Then</name> you must go down to the battle.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I know. The <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd has given me leave. But, <name type="PERSON">Beregond</name>, if you can, do something to stop any dreadful thing happening.'</q></p>
<p><q>'The <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd does not permit those who wear the black and silver to leave their post for any cause, save at his own command.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Well, you must choose between orders and the life of <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q><name type="PERSON">'And</name> as for orders, I think you have a madman to deal with, not a lord. I must run. I will return if I can.'</q></p>
<p>He ran on, down, down towards the outer city. <name type="ORG">Men</name> flying back from the burning passed him, and some seeing his livery turned and shouted, but he paid no heed. At last he was through the <name type="ORDINAL">Second</name> <name type="FAC">Gate</name>, beyond which great fires leaped up between the walls. Yet it seemed strangely silent. No noise or shouts of battle or din of arms could be heard. Then suddenly there was a dreadful cry and a great shock, and a deep echoing boom. Forcing himself on against a gust of fear and horror that shook him almost to his knees. <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> turned a corner opening on the wide place behind the <name type="LOC">City</name> <name type="FAC">Gate</name>. He stopped dead. He had found <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>; but he shrank back, cowe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng into a shadow.</p>
<p>Ever since the middle <name type="TIME">night</name> the great assault had g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> on. The drums rolled. To the north and to the south company upon company of the enemy pressed to the walls. There came great beasts, like moving houses in the red and fitful light, the _m<name type="PERSON">�mak</name>il_ of the <name type="ORG">Harad</name> dragging through the lanes amid the fires huge towers and engines. Yet their Captain cared not greatly what they did or how many might be slain: their purpose was only to test the strength of the de<name type="PERSON">fen</name>ce and to keep the men of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> busy in many places. It was against the <name type="FAC">Gate</name> that he would throw his heaviest w<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name>. Very strong it might be, wrought of steel and iron, and guarded with towers and bastions of indomitable st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, yet it was the key, the weakest point in all that high and impenetrable wall.</p>
<p>The drums rolled louder. <name type="ORG">Fire</name>s leaped up. Great engines crawled across the field; and in the midst was a huge ram, great as a forest-tree <name type="CARDINAL">a <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name></name> feet in length, swinging on mighty c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>ns. <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ng had it been forging in the dark <name type="PERSON">smith</name>ies of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>, and its hideous head, founded of black steel, was shaped in the likeness of a <name type="PERSON">raven</name>ing <name type="PERSON">wolf</name>; on it spells of ruin lay. <name type="GPE">Grond</name> they named it, in memory of the <name type="PERSON">Hammer</name> of the Underworld of old. Great beasts drew it, <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s surrounded it, and behind walked mountain-trolls to wield it.</p>
<p>But about the <name type="FAC">Gate</name> resistance still was stout, and there the k<name type="TIME">night</name>s of Dol <name type="PERSON">Amroth</name> and the hardiest of the gar<name type="GPE">ri</name>son stood at bay. Shot and dart fell thick; siege-towers crashed or blazed suddenly like torches. All before the walls on either side of the <name type="FAC">Gate</name> the ground was choked with wreck and with bodies of the slain; yet still d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ven as by a madness more and more came up.</p>
<p><name type="GPE">Grond</name> crawled on. Upon its housing no fire would catch; and though now and again some great beast that hauled it would go mad and spread stamping ruin among the orcs innumerable that guarded it, their bodies were cast aside from its path and others took their place.</p>
<p><name type="GPE">Grond</name> crawled on. The drums rolled wildly. Over the <name type="ORG">hill</name>s of slain a hideous shape appeared: a horseman, tall, hooded, cloaked in black. Slowly, trampling <name type="DATE">the fall</name>en, he rode forth, heeding no longer any dart. He halted and held up a long pale sword. And as he did so a great fear fell on all, de<name type="PERSON">fen</name>der and foe alike; and the hands of men drooped to their sides, and no bow sang. For a moment all was still.</p>
<p>The drums rolled and rattled. With a vast rush <name type="GPE">Grond</name> was hurled forward by huge hands. It reached the <name type="FAC">Gate</name>. It swung. A deep boom rumbled through the <name type="LOC">City</name> like thunder running in the clouds. But the doors of iron and posts of steel withstood the stroke.</p>
<p>Then the <name type="ORG">Black</name> Captain rose in his stirrups and c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed aloud in a dreadful voice, speaking in some forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> tongue words of power and terror to rend both heart and st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Thr</name>ice he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed. <name type="PERSON">Thr</name>ice the great ram boomed. And suddenly upon the last stroke the <name type="FAC">Gate</name> of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> broke. As if st<name type="GPE">ri</name>cken by some blasting spell it burst asunder: there was a flash of sea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng lightning, and the doors tumbled in <name type="GPE">ri</name>ven fragments to the ground.</p>
<p>In rode the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd of <name type="FAC">the Nazg�l.</name> A great black shape against the fires beyond he loomed up, grown to a vast menace of despair. In rode the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd of the Nazg�l, under the archway that no enemy ever yet had passed, and all fled before his face.</p>
<p>All save <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. There waiting, silent and still in the space before the <name type="FAC">Gate</name>, sat <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> upon <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>fax: <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>fax who al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> among the free horses of the <name type="LOC">earth</name> endured the terror, unmoving, steadfast as a g<name type="PERSON">raven</name> image in <name type="ORG">Rath D�nen</name>.</p>
<p><q>'You cannot enter here,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, and the huge shadow halted. <q><name type="CARDINAL">'Go</name> back to the abyss prepared for you! Go back! Fall into the nothingness that awaits you and your Master. Go!'</q></p>
<p>The <name type="ORG">Black</name> <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name> flung back his hood, and behold! he had a kingly crown; and yet upon no head visible was it set. The red fires sh<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> between it and the mantled shoulders vast and dark. From a mouth unseen there came a deadly laughter.</p>
<p><q><name type="PERSON">'Old</name> fool!'</q> he said. <q><name type="PERSON">'Old</name> fool! This is my <name type="TIME">hour</name>. Do you not know Death when you see it? Die now and curse in vain!'</q> And with that he lifted high his sword and flames ran down the blade.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> did not move. And in that very moment, away behind in some courtyard of the <name type="LOC">City</name>, a cock crowed. <name type="PERSON">Sh<name type="GPE">ri</name>ll</name> and clear he crowed, recking nothing of wizardry or war, welcoming only the <name type="TIME">morning</name> that in the sky far above the shadows of death was coming with the <name type="TIME">dawn</name>.</p>
<p>And as if in answer there came from far away another note. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>rns, horns, horns. In dark <name type="GPE">Min<name type="PERSON">dol</name>luin</name>'s sides they dimly echoed. Great horns of the <name type="LOC">North</name> wildly blowing. <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> had come at <name type="DATE">last.</name></p>
</chapter><chapter num="5"><heading>Chapter 5</heading>
<p>The Ride of the Rohir<name type="GPE">ri</name>m</p>
<p>It was dark and <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> could see nothing as he lay on the ground rolled in a blanket; yet though the <name type="TIME">night</name> was airless and windless, all about him hidden trees were sighing softly. He lifted his head. Then he heard it again: a sound like faint drums in the wooded <name type="ORG">hill</name>s and mountain-steps. The throb would cease suddenly and then be taken up again at some other point, now nearer, now further off. He wondered if the watchmen had heard it.</p>
<p>He could not see them, but he knew that all round him were the companies of the Rohir<name type="GPE">ri</name>m. He could smell the horses in the dark, and could hear their shiftings and their soft stamping on the needle-covered ground. The host was bivouacked in the pine-woods that clustered about <name type="GPE">Eilenach</name> Beacon, a tall <name type="ORG">hill</name> standing up from the long <name type="GPE">ri</name>dges of the Dr�adan <name type="ORG">Forest</name> that lay beside the great road in <name type="LOC">East</name> <name type="PERSON">An�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en</name>.</p>
<p>Tired as he was <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> could not sleep. He had <name type="GPE">ri</name>dden now for <name type="CARDINAL">four</name> <name type="DATE">day</name>s on end, and the ever-deepening gloom had slowly weighed down his heart. He began to wonder why he had been so eager to come, when he had been given every excuse, even his lord's command, to stay behind. He wondered, too, if the old <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g knew that he had been disobeyed and was angry. Perhaps not. There seemed to be some understanding between <name type="PERSON">Dernhelm</name> and <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name>helm, the Marshal who commanded the _�ored_ in which they were <name type="GPE">ri</name>ding. He and all his men ignored <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> and pre<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ded not to hear if he spoke. He might have been just another bag that <name type="PERSON">Dernhelm</name> was carrying. <name type="PERSON">Dernhelm</name> was no comfort: he never spoke to any<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> felt small, un<name type="PERSON">wan</name>ted, and l<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>ly. Now the time was anxious, and the host was in pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>l. They were less than <name type="DATE">a <name type="DATE">day</name></name>'s <name type="GPE">ri</name>de from the out-walls of Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name> that encircled the townlands. Scouts had been sent ahead. Some had not returned. Others has<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing back had reported that the road was held in force against them. A host of the enemy was encamped upon it, <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> miles west of <name type="GPE">Amon D�n</name>, and some strength of men was already thrusting along the road and was <name type="CARDINAL">no more than <name type="CARDINAL">three</name></name> leagues away. <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s were roving in the <name type="ORG">hill</name>s and woods along the roadside. The king and �omer held council in the watches of the <name type="TIME">night</name>.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Merry</name> <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ted somebody to talk to, and he thought of <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. But that only increased his restlessness. Poor <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>, shut up in the great city of st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, l<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>ly and afraid. <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> wished he was a tall <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name> like �omer and could blow a horn or something and go galloping to his rescue. He sat up, lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing to the drums that were beating again, now nearer at hand. Presently he heard voices speaking low, and he saw dim <name type="CARDINAL">half</name>-shrouded lanterns passing through the trees. <name type="ORG">Men</name> nearby began to move uncertainly in the dark.</p>
<p>A tall figure loomed up and stumbled over him, cursing the tree-roots. He recognized the voice of the Marshal, <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name>helm.</p>
<p><q>'I am not a tree-root, Sir,'</q> he said, <q>'nor a bag, but a bruised hobbit. The least you can do in amends is to tell me what is afoot.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Anything that can keep so in this devil's mirk,'</q> answered <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name>helm. <q>'But my lord sends word that we must set ourselves in readiness: orders may come for a sudden move.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Is the enemy coming then?'</q> asked <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> anxiously. <q>'Are those their drums? I began to think I was imagining them, as no <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> else seemed to take any notice of them.'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Nay</name>, nay,'</q> said <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name>helm, <q>'the enemy is on the road not in the <name type="ORG">hill</name>s. You hear the <name type="ORG">Woses</name>, the Wild <name type="ORG">Men</name> of the <name type="PERSON">Wood</name>s: thus they talk together from afar. They still haunt Dr�adan <name type="ORG">Forest</name>, it is said. Remnants of an older time they be, living few and <name type="ORG">sec</name>retly, wild and wary as the beasts. They go not to war with <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> or the <name type="PERSON">Mark</name>; but now they are troubled by the darkness and the coming of the orcs: they fear lest the <name type="EVENT">Dark Years</name> be returning, as seems likely enough. Let us be thankful that they are not hunting us: for they use pois<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>d arrows, it is said, and they are woodcrafty beyond compare. But they have offered their services to Th�oden. Even now <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of their headmen is being taken to the king. Yonder go the lights. So much I have heard but no more. And now I must busy myself with my lord's commands. Pack yourself up, Master Bag!'</q> He vanished into the shadows.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Merry</name> did not like this talk of wild men and pois<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>d darts, but quite apart from that a great w<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name> of dread was on him. Waiting was unbearable. He longed to know what was going to happen. He got up and soon was walking wa<name type="GPE">ri</name>ly in pursuit of the last lantern before it disappeared among the trees.</p>
<p>Presently he came to an open space where a small <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>t had been set up for the king under a great tree. A large lantern, covered above, was hanging from a bough and cast a pale circle of light below. There sat Th�oden and �omer, and before them on the ground sat a strange squat shape of a man, gnarled as an old st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, and the <name type="PERSON">hai</name>rs of his scanty beard straggled on his lumpy <name type="PERSON">chin</name> like dry moss. He was short-legged and fat-armed, thick and stumpy, and clad only with grass about his waist. <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> felt that he had seen him before somewhere, and suddenly he remembered the P<name type="PRODUCT">�k</name>el-men of <name type="PERSON">Dunharrow</name>. Here was <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of those old images brought to life, or maybe a creature descended in true line through endless <name type="DATE">year</name>s from the models used by the forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> craftsmen <name type="DATE">long ago</name>.</p>
<p>There was a silence as <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> crept nearer, and then the Wild Man began to speak, in answer to some question, it seemed. His voice was deep and guttural, yet to <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>'s surp<name type="GPE">ri</name>se he spoke the Common <name type="ORG">Speech</name>, though in a halting fashion, and uncouth words were mingled with it.</p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'No</name>, father of <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>rse-men,'</q> he said, <q>'we fight not. <name type="PERSON">Hunt</name> only. Kill _gorg�n_ in woods, hate orc-folk. You hate _gorg�n_ too. We help as we can. Wild <name type="ORG">Men</name> have long ears and long eyes; know all paths. Wild <name type="ORG">Men</name> live here before <name type="ORG">St<name type="CARDINAL">one</name></name>-houses; before Tall <name type="ORG">Men</name> come up out of Water.'</q></p>
<p><q>'But our need is for aid in battle,'</q> said �omer. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w will you and your folk help us?'</q></p>
<p><q>'B<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng news,'</q> said the Wild Man. <q>'We look out from <name type="ORG">hill</name>s. We climb big mountain and look down. <name type="ORG">St<name type="CARDINAL">one</name></name>-city is shut. <name type="ORG">Fire</name> burns there outside; now inside too. You wish to come there? Then you must be quick. But _gorg�n_ and men out of far-away,'</q> he waved a short gnarled arm eastward, <q>'sit on horse-road. Very many, more than <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>rse-men.'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w do you know that?'</q> said �omer.</p>
<p>The old man's flat face and dark eyes showed nothing, but his voice was sullen with displeasure. <q>'Wild men are wild, free, but not children,'</q> he answered. <q>'I am great headman, <name type="PERSON">Gh�n</name>-bu<name type="GPE">ri</name>-<name type="PERSON">Gh�n</name>. I count many things: stars in sky, leaves on trees, men in the dark. You have a score of scores counted <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> times and <name type="CARDINAL">five</name>. They have more. Big fight, and who will win? And many more walk round walls of <name type="ORG">St<name type="CARDINAL">one</name></name>-houses.'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Alas</name>! he speaks all too shrewdly,'</q> said Th�oden. <q><name type="PERSON">'And</name> our scouts say that they have cast trenches and stakes across the road. We cannot sweep them away in sudden onset.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="PERSON">'And</name> yet we need great haste,'</q> said �omer. <q>'<name type="GPE">Mund<name type="GPE">burg</name></name> is on fire!'</q></p>
<p><q>'Let <name type="PERSON">Gh�n</name>-bu<name type="GPE">ri</name>-<name type="PERSON">Gh�n</name> finish!'</q> said the Wild Man. <q>'<name type="CARDINAL">More than <name type="CARDINAL">one</name></name> road he knows. He will lead you by road where no pits are, no _gorg�n_ walk, only Wild <name type="ORG">Men</name> and beasts. Many paths were made when <name type="ORG">St<name type="CARDINAL">one</name></name>house-folk were stronger. They carved <name type="ORG">hill</name>s as hunters carve beast-flesh. Wild <name type="ORG">Men</name> think they ate st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> for food. They went through Dr�adan to <name type="PERSON">Rimmon</name> with great <name type="PERSON">wain</name>s. They go no longer. <name type="FAC">Road</name> is forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>, but not by Wild <name type="ORG">Men</name>. Over <name type="ORG">hill</name> and behind <name type="ORG">hill</name> it lies still under grass and tree, there behind <name type="PERSON">Rimmon</name> and down to D�n, and back at the end to <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>rse-men's road. Wild <name type="ORG">Men</name> will show you that road. Then you will kill _gorg�n_ and d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ve away bad dark with b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght iron, and Wild <name type="ORG">Men</name> can go back to sleep in the wild woods.'</q></p>
<p>�omer and the king spoke together in their own tongue. At length Th�oden turned to the Wild Man. <q>'We will receive your offer,'</q> he said. <q>'For though we leave a host of foes behind, what matter? If the <name type="ORG">St<name type="CARDINAL">one</name></name>-city falls, then we shall have no returning. If it is saved, then the orc-host itself will be cut off. If you are faithful, <name type="PERSON">Gh�n</name>-bu<name type="GPE">ri</name>-<name type="PERSON">Gh�n</name>, then we will give you <name type="GPE">ri</name>ch reward, and you shall have the f<name type="GPE">ri</name>endship of the <name type="PERSON">Mark</name> for ever.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Dead men are not f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends to living men, and give them no gifts,'</q> said the Wild Man. <q>'But if you live after the <name type="PRODUCT">Darkness</name>, then leave Wild <name type="ORG">Men</name> al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> in the woods and do not hunt them like beasts any more. <name type="PERSON">Gh�n</name>-bu<name type="GPE">ri</name>-<name type="PERSON">Gh�n</name> will not lead you into trap. He will go himself with father of <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>rse-men, and if he leads you wrong, you will kill him.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="CARDINAL">'So</name> be it!'</q> said Th�oden.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w long will it take to pass by the enemy and come back to the road?'</q> asked �omer. <q>'We must go at foot-pace, if you guide us; and I doubt not the way is narrow.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Wild <name type="ORG">Men</name> go quick on feet,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gh�n</name>. <q>'Way is wide for <name type="CARDINAL">four</name> horses in <name type="ORG">St<name type="CARDINAL">one</name></name><name type="PERSON">wain</name> <name type="LOC">Valley</name> yonder,'</q> he waved his hand southwards; <q>'but narrow at beginning and at end. Wild Man could walk from here to D�n <name type="TIME">between sun<name type="GPE">ri</name>se and <name type="TIME">noon</name></name>.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="ORG">'Then</name> we must allow <name type="TIME">at least <name type="CARDINAL">seven</name> <name type="TIME">hour</name>s</name> for the leaders,'</q> said �omer; <q>'but we must reckon rather on some <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> <name type="TIME">hour</name>s for all. Things unforeseen may hinder us, and if our host is all strung out, it will be long ere it can be set in order when we issue from the <name type="ORG">hill</name>s. What is the <name type="TIME">hour</name> now?'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="CARDINAL">'Who</name> knows?'</q> said Th�oden. <q><name type="PERSON">'All</name> is <name type="TIME">night</name> now.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'It</name> is all dark, but it is not <name type="TIME">all <name type="TIME">night</name></name>.'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gh�n</name>. <q>'When <name type="ORG">Sun</name> comes we feel her, even when she is hidden. Already she climbs over <name type="LOC">East</name>-mountains. It is the opening of <name type="DATE">day</name> in the sky-fields.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="ORG">'Then</name> we must set out as soon as may be,'</q> said �omer. <q>'Even so we cannot hope to come to <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>'s aid to<name type="DATE">day</name>.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Merry</name> waited to hear no more, but slipped away to get ready for the summons to the <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ch. This was the last stage before the battle. It did not seem likely to him that many of them would survive it. But he thought of <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> and the flames in Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name> and thrust down his own dread.</p>
<p>All went well that <name type="DATE">day</name>, and no sight or sound had they of the enemy waiting to waylay them. The Wild <name type="ORG">Men</name> had put out a screen of wary hunters, so that no orc or roving spy should learn of the movements in the <name type="ORG">hill</name>s. The light was more dim than ever as they drew nearer to the beleaguered city, and the <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s passed in long files like dark shadows of men and horses. Each company was guided by a wild woodman; but old <name type="PERSON">Gh�n</name> walked beside the king. The start had been slower than was hoped, for it had taken time for the <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s, walking and leading their horses, to find paths over the thickly wooded <name type="GPE">ri</name>dges behind their camp and down into the hidden <name type="ORG">St<name type="CARDINAL">one</name></name><name type="PERSON">wain</name> <name type="LOC">Valley</name>. It was late in the <name type="TIME">after<name type="TIME">noon</name></name> when the leaders came to wide grey thickets stret<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g beyond the eastward side of <name type="GPE">Amon D�n</name>, and masking a great gap in the line of <name type="ORG">hill</name>s that from <name type="GPE">Nar<name type="PERSON">dol</name></name> to D�n ran east and west. <name type="PERSON">Thr</name>ough the gap the forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> <name type="PERSON">wain</name>-road <name type="DATE">long ago</name> had run down, back into the main horse-way from the <name type="LOC">City</name> through <name type="PERSON">An�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en</name>; but now for many lives of men trees had had their way with it, and it had vanished, broken and bu<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed under the leaves of uncounted <name type="DATE">year</name>s. But the thickets offered to the <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s their last hope of cover before they went into open battle; for beyond them lay the road and the plains of <name type="GPE">Anduin</name>, while east and southwards the slopes were bare and rocky, as the w<name type="GPE">ri</name>then <name type="ORG">hill</name>s gathered themselves together and climbed up, bastion upon bastion, into the great mass and shoulders of <name type="GPE">Min<name type="PERSON">dol</name>luin</name>.</p>
<p>The leading company was halted, and as those behind filed up out of the trough of the <name type="ORG">St<name type="CARDINAL">one</name></name><name type="PERSON">wain</name> <name type="LOC">Valley</name> they spread out and passed to camping-places under the grey trees. The king summ<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>d the captains to council. �omer sent out scouts to spy upon the road; but old <name type="PERSON">Gh�n</name> shook his head.</p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'No</name> good to send <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>rse-men,'</q> he said. <q>'Wild <name type="ORG">Men</name> have already seen all that can be seen in the bad air. They will come soon and speak to me here.'</q></p>
<p>The captains came; and then out of the trees crept wa<name type="GPE">ri</name>ly other p<name type="PRODUCT">�k</name>el-shapes so like old <name type="PERSON">Gh�n</name> that <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> could hardly tell them apart. They spoke to <name type="PERSON">Gh�n</name> in a strange throaty language.</p>
<p>Presently <name type="PERSON">Gh�n</name> turned to the king. <q>'Wild <name type="ORG">Men</name> say many things ' he said. '<name type="ORDINAL">First</name>, be wary! Still many men in camp beyond D�n, <name type="TIME">an <name type="TIME">hour</name></name>'s walk yonder,'</q> he waved his arm west towards the black beacon. <q>'But n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> to see between here and <name type="ORG">St<name type="CARDINAL">one</name></name>-folk's new walls. Many busy there. Walls stand up no longer: _gorg�n_ knock them down with <name type="LOC">earth</name>-thunder and with clubs of black iron. They are unwary and do not look about them. They think their f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends watch all roads!'</q> At that old <name type="PERSON">Gh�n</name> made a cu<name type="GPE">ri</name>ous gurgling noise, and it seemed that he was laughing.</p>
<p><q><name type="CARDINAL">'Go</name>od tidings!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed �omer. <q>'Even in this gloom hope gleams again. Our Enemy's devices oft serve us in his despite. The accursed darkness itself has been a cloak to us. And now, lusting to destroy <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> and throw it down st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> from st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, his orcs have taken away my greatest fear. The out-wall could have been held long against us. Now we can sweep through � if once we win so far.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Once again I thank you, <name type="PERSON">Gh�n</name>-bu<name type="GPE">ri</name>-<name type="PERSON">Gh�n</name> of the woods,'</q> said Th�oden. <q><name type="CARDINAL">'Go</name>od fortune go with you for tidings and for guidance!'</q></p>
<p><q>'Kill _gorg�n_! Kill orc-folk! No other words please Wild <name type="ORG">Men</name> ' answered <name type="PERSON">Gh�n</name>. 'D<name type="GPE">ri</name>ve away bad air and darkness with b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght iron!'</q></p>
<p><q>'To do these things we have <name type="GPE">ri</name>dden far,'</q> said the king, <q>'and we shall attempt them. But what we shall achieve only to<name type="DATE">morrow</name> will show.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Gh�n</name>-bu<name type="GPE">ri</name>-<name type="PERSON">Gh�n</name> squatted down and touched the <name type="LOC">earth</name> with his horny brow in token of farewell. Then he got up as if to depart. But suddenly he stood looking up like some startled woodland animal snuffling a strange air. A light came in his eyes.</p>
<p><q>'Wind is changing!'</q> he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed, and with that, in a twinkling as it seemed, he and his fellows had vanished into the glooms, never to be seen by any <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name> of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> again. Not long after far away eastward the faint drums throbbed again. Yet to no heart in all the host came any fear that the Wild <name type="ORG">Men</name> were unfaithful, strange and unlovely though they might appear.</p>
<p><q>'We need no further guidance,'</q> said <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name>helm; <q>'for there are <name type="GPE">ri</name>ders in the host who have <name type="GPE">ri</name>dden down to <name type="GPE">Mund<name type="GPE">burg</name></name> in <name type="DATE">day</name>s of peace. I for <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. When we come to the road it will veer south, and there will lie before us still <name type="CARDINAL">seven</name> leagues ere we reach the wall of the townlands. Along most of that way there is much grass on either side of the road. On that stretch the errand-<name type="GPE">ri</name>ders of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> reck<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>d to make their greatest speed. We may <name type="GPE">ri</name>de it swiftly and without great rumour.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="ORG">'Then</name> since we must look for fell deeds and the need of all our strength,'</q> said �omer, <q>'I counsel that we rest now, and set out hence by <name type="TIME">night</name>, and so time our going that we come upon the fields when to<name type="DATE">morrow</name> is as light as it will be, or when our lord gives the signal.'</q></p>
<p>To this the king assented, and the captains departed. But soon <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name>helm returned. <q>'The scouts have found naught to report beyond the grey wood, lord,'</q> he said, <q>'save <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> men only: <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> dead men and <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> dead horses.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Well?'</q> said �omer. <q>'What of it?'</q></p>
<p><q>'This, lord: they were errand-<name type="GPE">ri</name>ders of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>; <name type="GPE">Hirgon</name> was <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> maybe. At least his hand still clasped the <name type="ORG">Red Arrow</name>, but his head was hewn off. And this also: it would seem by the signs that they were fleeing _westward_ when they fell. As I read it, they found the enemy already on the out-wall, or assailing it, when they returned � and that would be <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> <name type="TIME">night</name>s ago, if they used fresh horses from the posts, as is their wont. They could not reach the <name type="LOC">City</name> and turned back.'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Alas</name>!'</q> said Th�oden. <q><name type="ORG">'Then</name> <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name> has heard no news of our <name type="GPE">ri</name>ding and will despair of our coming.'</q></p>
<p><q>'_Need brooks no delay, yet late is better than never_,'</q> said �omer. <q><name type="PERSON">'And</name> mayhap in this time shall the old saw be proved truer than ever before since men spoke with mouth.'</q></p>
<p>It was <name type="TIME">night</name>. On either side of the road the host of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> was moving silently. Now the road passing about the skirts of <name type="GPE">Min<name type="PERSON">dol</name>luin</name> turned southward. Far away and almost straight ahead there was a red glow under the black sky and the sides of the great mountain loomed dark against it. They were drawing near the <name type="ORG">Rammas</name> of the <name type="ORG">Pelennor</name>; but the <name type="DATE">day</name> was not yet come.</p>
<p>The king rode in the midst of the leading company, his household-men about him. <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name>helm's _�ored_ came next; and now <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> noticed that <name type="PERSON">Dernhelm</name> had left his place and in the darkness was moving steadily forward, until at last he was <name type="GPE">ri</name>ding just in rear of the king's guard. There came a check. <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> heard voices in front speaking softly. Out-<name type="GPE">ri</name>ders had come back who had ventured forward almost to the wall. They came to the king.</p>
<p><q>'There are great fires, lord,'</q> said <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. <q>'The <name type="LOC">City</name> is all set about with flame, and the field is full of foes. But all seem drawn off to the assault. As well as we could guess, there are few left upon the out-wall, and they are heedless, busy in destruction.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Do you remember the Wild Man's words, lord?'</q> said another. <q>'I live upon the open <name type="ORG">Wold</name> in <name type="DATE">day</name>s of peace; W�dfara is my name, and to me also the air b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ngs messages. Already the wind is turning. There comes a breath out of the <name type="LOC">South</name>; there is a sea-tang in it, faint though it be. <name type="TIME">The <name type="TIME">morning</name></name> will b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng new things. Above the <name type="GPE">reek</name> it will be <name type="TIME">dawn</name> when you pass the wall.'</q></p>
<p><q>'If you speak truly, W�dfara, then may you live beyond this <name type="DATE">day</name> in <name type="DATE">year</name>s of blessedness!'</q> said Th�oden. He turned to the men of his household who were near, and he spoke now in a clear voice so that many also of the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ders of the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> _�ored_ heard him:</p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'No</name>w is the <name type="TIME">hour</name> come, <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s of the <name type="PERSON">Mark</name>, sons of <name type="PERSON">Eorl</name>! <name type="ORG">Foes</name> and fire are before you, and your homes far behind. Yet, though you fight upon an alien field, the glory that you reap there shall be your own for ever. Oaths ye have taken: now fulfil them all, to lord and land and league of f<name type="GPE">ri</name>endship!'</q></p>
<p><name type="ORG">Men</name> clashed spear upon shield.</p>
<p><q>'�omer, my son! You lead the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> _�ored_,'</q> said Th�oden; <q>'and it shall go behind the king's banner in the centre. <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name>helm, lead your company to the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght when we pass the wall. And <name type="PERSON">G<name type="GPE">ri</name>m</name>bold shall lead his towards the left. Let the other companies behind follow these <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> that lead, as they have chance. St<name type="GPE">ri</name>ke wherever the enemy gathers. Other plans we cannot make, for we know not yet how things stand upon the field. Forth now, and fear no darkness!'</q></p>
<p>The leading company rode off as swiftly as they could, for it was still deep dark, whatever change W�dfara might <name type="PERSON">forebode</name>. <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> was <name type="GPE">ri</name>ding behind <name type="PERSON">Dernhelm</name>, clut<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g with the left hand while with the other he t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed to loosen his sword in its sheath. He felt now bitterly the truth of the old king's words: _in such a battle what would you do <name type="PERSON">Me<name type="GPE">ri</name>adoc</name>?_ Just this,<q>' he thought: 'encumber a <name type="GPE">ri</name>der, and hope at best to stay in my seat and not be pounded to death by galloping hoofs!'</q></p>
<p>It was no more than a league to where the out-walls had stood. They soon reached them; too soon for <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. Wild c<name type="GPE">ri</name>es broke out, and there was some clash of arms, but it was b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ef. The orcs busy about the walls were few and amazed, and they were quickly slain or d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ven off. Before the ruin of the north-gate in the <name type="ORG">Rammas</name> the king halted again. The <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> _�ored_ drew up behind him and about him on either side. <name type="PERSON">Dernhelm</name> kept close to the king, though <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name>helm's company was away on the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght. <name type="PERSON">G<name type="GPE">ri</name>m</name>bold's men turned aside and passed round to a great gap in the wall further eastward.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Merry</name> peered from behind <name type="PERSON">Dernhelm</name>'s back. Far away, maybe <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> miles or more, there was a great burning, but between it and the <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s lines of fire blazed in a vast crescent, at the nearest point less than a league distant. He could make out little more on the dark plain, and as yet he neither saw any hope of <name type="TIME">morning</name>, nor felt any wind, changed or unchanged.</p>
<p>Now silently the host of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> moved forward into the field of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>, pou<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng in slowly but steadily, like the <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing tide through breaches in a dike that men have thought <name type="ORG">sec</name>ure. But the mind and will of the <name type="ORG">Black</name> Captain were bent wholly on <name type="DATE">the fall</name>ing city, and as yet no tidings came to him warning that his designs held any flaw.</p>
<p>After a while the king led his men away somewhat eastward, to come between the fires of the siege and the outer fields. Still they were unchallenged, and still Th�oden gave no signal. At last he halted once again. The <name type="LOC">City</name> was now nearer. A smell of burning was in the air and a very shadow of death. The horses were uneasy. But the king sat upon <name type="PERSON">Snow</name>mane, motionless, gazing upon the agony of Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name>, as if st<name type="GPE">ri</name>cken suddenly by anguish, or by dread. He seemed to sh<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk down, cowed by age. <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> himself felt as if a great w<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name> of horror and doubt had settled on him. His heart beat slowly. <name type="PERSON">Tim</name>e seemed poised in uncertainty. They were too late! Too late was worse than never! Perhaps Th�oden would quail, bow his old head, turn, slink away to hide in the <name type="ORG">hill</name>s.</p>
<p>Then suddenly <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> felt it at last, beyond doubt: a change. Wind was in his face! Light was glimme<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng. Far, far away, in the <name type="LOC">South</name> the clouds could be dimly seen as remote grey shapes, rolling up, d<name type="GPE">ri</name>fting: <name type="TIME">morning</name> lay beyond them.</p>
<p>But at that same moment there was a flash, as if lightning had sprung from the <name type="LOC">earth</name> beneath the <name type="LOC">City</name>. For a sea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng <name type="ORG">sec</name>ond it stood dazzling far off in black and white, its topmost tower like a glitte<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng needle: and then as the darkness closed again there came rolling over the fields a great _boom_.</p>
<p>At that sound the bent shape of the king sprang suddenly erect. Tall and proud he seemed again; and <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing in his stirrups he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed in a loud voice, more clear than any there had ever heard a mortal man achieve before:</p>
<p>A<name type="GPE">ri</name>se, a<name type="GPE">ri</name>se, <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s of Th�oden!</p>
<p>Fell deeds awake: fire and slaughter!</p>
<p>spear shall be shaken, shield be splintered,</p>
<p>a sword-<name type="DATE">day</name>, <name type="DATE">a red <name type="DATE">day</name></name>, ere the sun <name type="GPE">ri</name>ses!</p>
<p>Ride now, <name type="GPE">ri</name>de now! Ride to <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>!</p>
<p>With that he seized a great horn from <name type="PERSON">Guthl</name>�f his banner-bearer, and he blew such a blast upon it that it burst asunder. And straightway all the horns in the host were lifted up in music, and the blowing of the horns of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> in that <name type="TIME">hour</name> was like a storm upon the plain and a thunder in the mountains.</p>
<p>Ride now, <name type="GPE">ri</name>de now! Ride to <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>!</p>
<p>Suddenly the king c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed to <name type="PERSON">Snow</name>mane and the horse sprang away. Behind him his banner blew in the wind, white horse upon a field of green, but he outpaced it. After him thundered the k<name type="TIME">night</name>s of his house, but he was ever before them. �omer rode there, the white horsetail on his helm floating in his speed, and the front of the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> _�ored_ roared like a breaker foaming to the shore, but Th�oden could not be overtaken. <name type="PERSON">Fey</name> he seemed, or the battle-fury of his fathers ran like new tire in his veins, and he was borne up on <name type="PERSON">Snow</name>mane like a god of old, even as <name type="ORG">Orom</name>� the Great in the battle of the <name type="NORP">Valar</name> when the world was young. His golden shield was uncovered, and lo! it sh<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> like an image of the <name type="ORG">Sun</name>, and the grass flamed into green about <name type="FAC">the white feet</name> of his <name type="PERSON">steed</name>. For <name type="TIME">morning</name> came, <name type="TIME">morning</name> and a wind from the sea; and the darkness was removed, and the hosts of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> wailed, and terror took them, and they fled, and died, and the hoofs of wrath rode over them. And then all the host of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> burst into song, and they sang as they slew, for the joy of battle was on them, and the sound of their singing that was fair and ter<name type="GPE">ri</name>ble came even to the <name type="LOC">City</name>.</p>
</chapter><chapter num="6"><heading>Chapter 6</heading>
<p>The <name type="PERSON">Battle</name> of the <name type="ORG">Pelennor</name> Fields</p>
<p>But it was no orc-chieftain or b<name type="GPE">ri</name>gand that led the assault upon <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>. The darkness was breaking too soon, before the date that his Master had set for it: fortune had betrayed him for the moment, and the world had turned against him; victory was slipping from his grasp even as he stretched out his hand to seize it. But his arm was long. He was still in command, wielding great powers. <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g, <name type="ORG">Ring</name>wraith, <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd of the Nazg�l, he had many weapons. He left the <name type="FAC">Gate</name> and vanished.</p>
<p>Th�oden <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g of the <name type="PERSON">Mark</name> had reached the road from the <name type="FAC">Gate</name> to the <name type="LOC">River</name>, and he turned towards the <name type="LOC">City</name> that was now less than <name type="QUANTITY">a mile</name> distant. He slackened his speed a little, seeking new foes, and his k<name type="TIME">night</name>s came about him, and <name type="PERSON">Dernhelm</name> was with them. Ahead nearer the walls <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name>helm's men were among the siege-engines, hewing, slaying, d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ving their foes into the fire-pits. Well nigh all the northern <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> of the <name type="ORG">Pelennor</name> was overrun, and there camps were blazing, orcs were flying towards the <name type="LOC">River</name> like herds before the hunters; and the Rohir<name type="GPE">ri</name>m went hither and thither at their will. But they had not yet overthrown the siege, nor won the <name type="FAC">Gate</name>. Many foes stood before it, and on the further <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> of the plain were other hosts still unfought. <name type="LOC">South</name>ward beyond the road lay the main force of the <name type="ORG">Harad</name><name type="GPE">ri</name>m, and there their horsemen were gathered about the standard of their chieftain. And he looked out, and in the growing light he saw the banner of the king, and that it was far ahead of the battle with few men about it. Then he was filled with a red wrath and shouted aloud, and displaying his standard, black serpent upon scarlet, he came against the white horse and the green with great press of men; and the drawing of the scimitars of the <name type="LOC">South</name>rons was like a glitter of stars.</p>
<p>Then Th�oden was aware of him, and would not wait for his onset, but crying to <name type="PERSON">Snow</name>mane he charged headlong to greet him. Great was the clash of their meeting. But the white fury of the <name type="LOC">North</name>men burned the hotter, and more skilled was their k<name type="TIME">night</name>hood with long spears and bitter. Fewer were they but they clove through the <name type="LOC">South</name>rons like a fire-bolt in a forest. Right through the press drove Th�oden <name type="PERSON">Thengel</name>'s son, and his spear was shivered as he threw down their chieftain. Out swept his sword, and he spurred to the standard, hewed staff and bearer; and the black serpent foundered. Then all that was left <name type="ORG">unslain of their cavalry</name> turned and fled far away.</p>
<p>But lo! suddenly in the midst of the glory of the king his golden shield was dimmed. The new <name type="TIME">morning</name> was blotted from the sky. Dark fell about him. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>rses reared and screamed. <name type="ORG">Men</name> cast from the saddle lay grovelling on the ground.</p>
<p><q>'To me! To me!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed Th�oden. <q>'Up <name type="PERSON">Eorl</name>ingas! Fear no darkness!'</q> But <name type="PERSON">Snow</name>mane wild with terror stood up on high, fighting with the air, and then with a great scream he crashed upon his side: a black dart had pierced him. The king fell beneath him.</p>
<p>The great shadow descended like a falling cloud. And behold! it was a winged creature: if bird, then greater than all other birds, and it was naked, and neither quill nor feather did it bear, and its vast pinions were as webs of hide between horned fingers; and it stank. A creature of an older world maybe it was, whose kind, finge<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng in forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> mountains cold beneath the <name type="PERSON">Moon</name>, outstayed their <name type="DATE">day</name>, and in hideous ey<name type="GPE">ri</name>e bred this last untimely brood, apt to evil. And the Dark <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd took it, and nursed it with fell meats, until it grew beyond the measure of all other things that fly; and he gave it to his servant to be his <name type="PERSON">steed</name>. Down, down it came, and then, folding its fingered webs, it gave a croaking cry, and settled upon the body of <name type="PERSON">Snow</name>mane, digging in its claws, stooping its long naked neck.</p>
<p>Upon it sat a shape, black-mantled, huge and threa<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing. A crown of steel he bore, but between <name type="GPE">ri</name>m and robe naught was there to see, save only a deadly gleam of eyes: the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd of <name type="FAC">the Nazg�l.</name> To the air he had returned, summoning his <name type="PERSON">steed</name> ere the darkness failed, and now he was come again, b<name type="GPE">ri</name>nging ruin, turning hope to despair, and victory to death. A great black mace he wielded.</p>
<p>But Th�oden was not utterly forsaken. The k<name type="TIME">night</name>s of his house lay slain about him, or else mastered by the madness of their <name type="PERSON">steed</name>s were borne far away. Yet <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> stood there still: <name type="PERSON">Dernhelm</name> the young, faithful beyond fear; and he wept, for he had loved his lord as a father. Right through the charge <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> had been borne unharmed behind him, until the <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name> came; and then <name type="ORG">Windfola</name> had thrown them in his terror, and now ran wild upon the plain. <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> crawled on all <name type="CARDINAL">four</name>s like a dazed beast, and such a horror was on him that he was blind and sick.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g's man! <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g's man!'</q> his heart c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed within him. <q>'You must stay by him. As a father you shall be to me, you said.'</q> But his will made no answer, and his body shook. He dared not open his eyes or look up.</p>
<p>Then out of the blackness in his mind he thought that he heard <name type="PERSON">Dernhelm</name> speaking; yet now the voice seemed strange, recalling some other voice that he had known.</p>
<p><q>'Beg<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, foul dwimmerlaik, lord of car<name type="GPE">ri</name>on! Leave the dead in peace!'</q></p>
<p>A cold voice answered: <q><name type="WORK_OF_ART">'<name type="WORK_OF_ART">Come</name></name> not between the Nazg�l and his prey! Or he will not slay thee in thy turn. He will bear thee away to the houses of lamentation, beyond all darkness, where thy flesh shall be devoured, and thy sh<name type="GPE">ri</name>velled mind be left naked to the Lidless <name type="PRODUCT">Eye</name>.'</q></p>
<p>A sword rang as it was drawn. <q>'Do what you will; but I will hinder it, if I may.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Hinder me? Thou fool. No living man may hinder me!'</q></p>
<p>Then <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> heard of all sounds in that <name type="TIME">hour</name> the strangest. It seemed that <name type="PERSON">Dernhelm</name> laughed, and the clear voice was like the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng of steel. <q>'But no living man am I! You look upon a woman. <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name> I am, �omund's daughter. You stand between me and my lord and kin. Beg<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, if you be not deathless! For living or dark undead, I will smite you, if you touch him.'</q></p>
<p>The winged creature screamed at her, but the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>wraith made no answer, and was silent, as if in sudden doubt. Very amazement for a moment conquered <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>'s fear. He opened his eyes and the blackness was lifted from them. There some paces from him sat the great beast, and all seemed dark about it, and above it loomed the Nazg�l <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd like a shadow of despair. A little to the left facing them stood she whom he had called <name type="PERSON">Dernhelm</name>. But the helm of her <name type="ORG">sec</name>recy, had fallen from her, and her b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght <name type="PERSON">hai</name>r, released from its bonds, gleamed with pale gold upon her shoulders. Her eyes grey as the sea were hard and fell, and yet tears were on her cheek. A sword was in her hand, and she raised her shield against the horror of her enemy's eyes.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">�owyn</name> it was, and <name type="PERSON">Dernhelm</name> also. For into <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>'s mind flashed the memory of the face that he saw at the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ding from <name type="PERSON">Dunharrow</name>: the face of <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> that goes seeking death, having no hope. Pity filled his heart and great wonder, and suddenly the slow-kindled courage of his race awoke. He clenched his hand. She should not die, so fair, so desperate At least she should not die al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, unaided.</p>
<p>The face of their enemy was not turned towards him, but still he hardly dared to move, dreading lest the deadly eyes should fall on him. Slowly, slowly he began to crawl aside; but the <name type="ORG">Black</name> Captain, in doubt and malice in<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>t upon the woman before him, heeded him no more than a worm in the mud.</p>
<p>Suddenly the great beast beat its hideous wings, and the wind of them was foul. Again it leaped into the air, and then swiftly fell down upon <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name>, sh<name type="GPE">ri</name>eking, st<name type="GPE">ri</name>king with beak and claw.</p>
<p>Still she did not <name type="NORP">blench</name>: maiden of the Rohir<name type="GPE">ri</name>m, child of kings, slender but as a steel-blade, fair but ter<name type="GPE">ri</name>ble. A swift stroke she dealt, skilled and deadly. The outstretched neck she clove asunder, and the hewn head fell like a st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. Backward she sprang as the huge shape crashed to ruin, vast wings outspread, crumpled on the <name type="LOC">earth</name>; and with its fall the shadow passed away. A light fell about her, and her <name type="PERSON">hai</name>r sh<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> in the sun<name type="GPE">ri</name>se.</p>
<p>Out of the wreck rose the <name type="ORG">Black</name> <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>, tall and threa<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing, towe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng above her. With a cry of hatred that stung the very ears like venom he let fall his mace. Her shield was shivered in many pieces, and her arm was broken; she stumbled to her knees. He bent over her like a cloud, and his eyes glittered; he raised his mace to kill.</p>
<p>But suddenly he too stumbled forward with a cry of bitter pain, and his stroke went wide, d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ving into the ground. <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>'s sword had stabbed him from behind, shea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng through the black mantle, and passing up beneath the <name type="PERSON">hauberk</name> had pierced the <name type="PERSON">sinew</name> behind his mighty knee.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">�owyn</name>! <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name>!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. Then totte<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng, struggling up, with her last strength she drove her sword between crown and mantle, as the great shoulders bowed before her. The sword broke sparkling into many shards. The crown rolled away with a clang. <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name> fell forward upon her fallen foe. But lo! the mantle and <name type="PERSON">hauberk</name> were empty. Shapeless they lay now on the ground, torn and tumbled; and a cry went up into the shudde<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng air, and faded to a sh<name type="GPE">ri</name>ll wailing, passing with the wind, a voice bodiless and thin that died, and was swallowed up, and was never heard again in that age of this world.</p>
<p>And there stood <name type="PERSON">Me<name type="GPE">ri</name>adoc</name> the hobbit in the midst of the slain, blinking like an owl in the <name type="DATE">day</name>light, for tears blinded him; and through a mist he looked on <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name>'s fair head, as she lay and did not move; and he looked on the face of the king, fallen in the midst of his glory, For <name type="PERSON">Snow</name>mane in his agony had rolled away from him again; yet he was the bane of his master.</p>
<p>Then <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> stooped and lifted his hand to kiss it, and lo! Th�oden opened his eyes, and they were clear, and he spoke in a quiet voice though laboured.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Farewell</name>, Master <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>lbytla!'</q> he said. <q><name type="CARDINAL">'My</name> body is broken. I go to my fathers. And even in their mighty company I shall not now be ashamed. I felled the black serpent. A g<name type="GPE">ri</name>m morn, and a glad <name type="DATE">day</name>, and a golden sunset!'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Merry</name> could not speak, but wept anew. <q>'Forgive me, lord,'</q> he said at last, <q>'if I broke your command, and yet have d<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> no more in your service than to weep at our parting.'</q></p>
<p>The old king smiled. <q>'<name type="PERSON">G<name type="GPE">ri</name>eve</name> not! It is forgiven. Great heart will not be denied. Live now in blessedness; and when you sit in peace with your pipe, think of me! For never now shall I sit with you in <name type="GPE">Meduseld</name>, as I promised, or lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> to your herb-lore.'</q> He closed his eyes, and <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> bowed beside him. Presently he spoke again. <q>'Where is �omer? For my eyes darken, and I would see him ere I go. He must be king after me. And I would send word to <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name>. She, she would not have me leave her, and now I shall not see her again, dearer than daughter.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="ORG">'<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd</name>, lord,'</q> began <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> brokenly, <q>'she is-'</q>; but at that moment there was a great clamour, and all about them horns and trumpets were blowing. <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> looked round: he had forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> the war, and all the world beside, and many <name type="TIME">hour</name>s it seemed since the king rode to his fall, though in truth it was only a little while. But now he saw that they were in danger of being caught in the very midst of the great battle that would soon be joined.</p>
<p>New forces of the enemy were has<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing up the road from the <name type="LOC">River</name>; and from under the walls came the legions of <name type="PERSON">Morgul</name>; and from the southward fields came footmen of <name type="ORG">Harad</name> with horsemen before them, and behind them rose the huge backs of the _m<name type="PERSON">�mak</name>il_ with war-towers upon them. But northward <name type="ORG">the white crest</name> of �omer led the great front of the Rohir<name type="GPE">ri</name>m which he had again gathered and <name type="PERSON">mar</name>shalled; and out of the <name type="LOC">City</name> came all the strength of men that was in it, and the silver <name type="PERSON">s<name type="PERSON">wan</name></name> of Dol <name type="PERSON">Amroth</name> was borne in the van, d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ving the enemy from the <name type="FAC">Gate</name>.</p>
<p>For a moment the thought flitted through <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>'s mind: <q>'Where is <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>? Is he not here? Could he not have saved the king and <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name>?'</q> But thereupon �omer rode up in haste, and with him came the k<name type="TIME">night</name>s of the household that still lived and had now mastered their horses. They looked in wonder at the carcase of the fell beast that lay there: and their <name type="PERSON">steed</name>s would not go near. But �omer leaped from the saddle, and g<name type="GPE">ri</name>ef and dismay fell upon him as he came to the king's side and stood there in silence.</p>
<p>Then <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the k<name type="TIME">night</name>s took the king's banner from the hand of <name type="PERSON">Guthl</name>�f the banner-bearer who lay dead, and he lifted it up. Slowly Th�oden opened his eyes. Seeing the banner he made a sign that it should be given to �omer.</p>
<p><q><name type="PERSON">'Hail</name>, <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g of the <name type="PERSON">Mark</name>!'</q> he said. <q>'Ride now to victory! Bid <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name> farewell!'</q> And so he died, and knew not that <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name> lay near him. And those who stood by wept, crying: <q>'Th�oden <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g! Th�oden <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g!'</q></p>
<p>But �omer said to them:</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Mourn</name> not overmuch! Mighty was <name type="DATE">the fall</name>en,</p>
<p>meet was his ending. When his mound is raised,</p>
<p>women then shall weep. War now calls us!</p>
<p>Yet he himself wept as he spoke. <q>'Let his k<name type="TIME">night</name>s remain here,'</q> he said; <q>'and bear his body in honour from the field, lest the battle <name type="GPE">ri</name>de over it! Yea, and all these other of the king's men that lie here.'</q> And he looked at the slain, recalling their names. Then suddenly he beheld his sister <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name> as she lay, and he knew her. He stood a moment as a man who is pierced in the midst of a cry by an arrow through the heart; and then his face went deathly white; and a cold fury rose in him, so that all speech failed him for a while. A fey mood took him.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">�owyn</name>, <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name>!'</q> he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed at last: <q>'<name type="PERSON">�owyn</name>, how come you here? What madness or devilry is this? Death, death, death! Death take us all!'</q></p>
<p>Then without taking counsel or waiting for the approach of the men of the <name type="LOC">City</name>, he spurred headlong back to the front of the great host, and blew a horn, and c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed aloud for the onset. Over the field rang his clear voice calling: <q>'Death! Ride, <name type="GPE">ri</name>de to ruin and the world's ending!'</q></p>
<p>And with that the host began to move. But the Rohir<name type="GPE">ri</name>m sang no more. _Death_ they c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed with <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> voice loud and ter<name type="GPE">ri</name>ble, and gathe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng speed like a great tide their battle swept about their fallen king and passed, roa<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng away southwards.</p>
<p>And still <name type="PERSON">Me<name type="GPE">ri</name>adoc</name> the hobbit stood there blinking through his tears and no <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> spoke to him, indeed n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> seemed to heed him. He brushed away the tears, and stooped to pick up the green shield that <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name> had given him; and he slung it at his back. Then he looked for his sword that he had let fall; for even as he struck his blow his arm was numbed, and now he could only use his left hand. And behold! there lay his weapon, but the blade was smoking like a dry branch that has been thrust in a fire; and as he watched it, it w<name type="GPE">ri</name>thed and withered and was consumed.</p>
<p>So passed the sword of the <name type="ORG">Barrow</name>-downs, work of <name type="LOC">West</name>ernesse. But glad would he have been to know its fate who wrought it slowly <name type="DATE">long ago</name> in the <name type="LOC">North</name>-kingdom when the D�nedain were young, and chief among their foes was the dread realm of Ang<name type="PERSON">mar</name> and its sorcerer king. No other blade, not though mightier hands had wielded it, would have dealt that foe a wound so bitter, cleaving the undead flesh, breaking the spell that knit his unseen <name type="PERSON">sinew</name>s to his will.</p>
<p><name type="ORG">Men</name> now raised the king, and laying cloaks upon spear-truncheons they made shift to bear him away towards the <name type="LOC">City</name>; and others lifted <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name> gently up and bore her after him. But the men of the king's household they could not yet b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng from the field; for <name type="CARDINAL">seven</name> of the king's k<name type="TIME">night</name>s had fallen there, and D�orwine their chief was among them. So they laid them apart from their foes and the fell beast and set spears about them. And afterwards when all was over men returned and made a fire there and burned the carcase of the beast; but for <name type="PERSON">Snow</name>mane they dug a grave and set up a st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> upon which was carved in the tongues of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> and the <name type="PERSON">Mark</name>:</p>
<p>Faithful servant yet master's bane</p>
<p>Lightfoot's foal, swift <name type="PERSON">Snow</name>mane.</p>
<p><name type="ORG">Green</name> and long grew the grass on <name type="PERSON">Snow</name>mane's <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>we, but ever black and bare was the ground where the beast was burned.</p>
<p>Now slowly and sadly <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> walked beside the bearers, and he gave no more heed to the battle. He was weary and full of pain, and his limbs trembled as with a c<name type="ORG">hill</name>. A great rain came out of the <name type="LOC">Sea</name>, and it seemed that all things wept for Th�oden and <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name>, quen<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g the fires in the <name type="LOC">City</name> with grey tears. It was through a mist that presently he saw the van of the men of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> approa<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g. <name type="PERSON">Imrahil</name>, P<name type="GPE">ri</name>nce of Dol <name type="PERSON">Amroth</name>, rode up and drew rein before them.</p>
<p><q>'What burden do you bear, <name type="ORG">Men</name> of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>?'</q> he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed.</p>
<p><q>'Th�oden <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g,'</q> they answered. <q><name type="CARDINAL">'He</name> is dead. But �omer <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g now <name type="GPE">ri</name>des in the battle: he with <name type="ORG">the white crest</name> in the wind.'</q></p>
<p>Then the p<name type="GPE">ri</name>nce went from his horse, and knelt by the bier in honour of the king and his great onset; and he wept. And <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing he looked then on <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name> and was amazed. <q>'Surely, here is a woman?'</q> he said. <q>'Have even the women of the Rohir<name type="GPE">ri</name>m come to war in our need?'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Nay</name>! <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> only,'</q> they answered. <q>'The <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name> is she, sister of �omer; and we knew naught of her <name type="GPE">ri</name>ding until this <name type="TIME">hour</name>, and greatly we rue it.'</q></p>
<p>Then the p<name type="GPE">ri</name>nce seeing her beauty, though her face was pale and cold, touched her hand as he bent to look more closely on her. <q>'<name type="ORG">Men</name> of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>!'</q> he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed. <q>'Are there no leeches among you? She is hurt to the death maybe, but I deem that she yet lives.'</q> And he held the b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght-burnished vambrace that was upon his arm before her cold tips, and behold! a little mist was laid on it hardly to be seen.</p>
<p><q><name type="PERSON">'Haste</name> now is needed,'</q> he said, and he sent <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> <name type="GPE">ri</name>ding back swiftly to the <name type="LOC">City</name> to b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng aid. But he bowing low to <name type="DATE">the fall</name>en, bade them farewell, and mounting rode away into battle.</p>
<p>And now the fighting waxed fu<name type="GPE">ri</name>ous on the fields of the <name type="ORG">Pelennor</name>; and the din of arms rose upon high, with the crying of men and the neighing of horses. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>rns were blown and trumpets were braying, and the _m<name type="PERSON">�mak</name>il_ were bellowing as they were goaded to war. Under the south walls of the <name type="LOC">City</name> the footmen of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> now drove against the legions of <name type="PERSON">Morgul</name> that were still gathered there in strength. But the horsemen rode eastward to the succour of �omer: H�<name type="GPE">ri</name>n the Tall <name type="ORG">Warden</name> of the Keys, and the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd of <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ssarnach, and <name type="ORG">Hirluin</name> of the <name type="ORG">Green</name> <name type="ORG">Hill</name>s, and P<name type="GPE">ri</name>nce <name type="PERSON">Imrahil</name> the fair with his k<name type="TIME">night</name>s all about him.</p>
<p>Not too soon came their aid to the Rohir<name type="GPE">ri</name>m; for fortune had turned against �omer, and his fury had betrayed him. The great wrath of his onset had utterly overthrown the front of his enemies, and great wedges of his <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s had passed clear through the ranks of the <name type="LOC">South</name>rons, discomfiting their horsemen and <name type="GPE">ri</name>ding their footmen to ruin. But wherever the _m<name type="PERSON">�mak</name>il_ came there the horses would not go, but <name type="NORP">blench</name>ed and swerved away; and the great monsters were unfought, and stood like towers of de<name type="PERSON">fen</name>ce, and the <name type="ORG">Harad</name><name type="GPE">ri</name>m rallied about them. And if the Rohir<name type="GPE">ri</name>m at their onset were th<name type="GPE">ri</name>ce outnumbered by the <name type="ORG">Harad</name><name type="GPE">ri</name>m al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, soon their case became worse; for new strength came now streaming to the field out of <name type="NORP">Osgiliath</name>. There they had been mustered for the sack of the <name type="LOC">City</name> and the rape of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>, waiting on the call of their Captain. He now was destroyed; but Gothmog the lieu<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ant of <name type="PERSON">Morgul</name> had flung them into the fray; <name type="LOC">East</name>erlings with axes, and <name type="GPE">Va<name type="GPE">ri</name>ags</name> of Khand. <name type="LOC">South</name>rons in scarlet, and out of <name type="ORG">Far <name type="ORG">Harad</name></name> black men like <name type="CARDINAL">half</name>-trolls with white eyes and red tongues. Some now has<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed up behind the Rohir<name type="GPE">ri</name>m, others held westward to hold off the forces of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> and prevent their joining with <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>.</p>
<p>It was even as the <name type="DATE">day</name> thus began to turn against <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> and their hope wavered that a new cry went up in the <name type="LOC">City</name>, it being then mid<name type="TIME">morning</name>, and a great wind blowing, and the rain flying north, and the sun shining. In that clear air watchmen on the walls saw afar a new sight of fear, and their last hope left them.</p>
<p>For <name type="GPE">Anduin</name>, from the bend at the <name type="PERSON">Harlond</name>, so flowed that from the <name type="LOC">City</name> men could look down it lengthwise for some leagues, and the far-sighted could see any ships that approached. And looking thither they c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed in dismay; for black against the glitte<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng stream they beheld a fleet borne up on the wind: <name type="ORG">dromunds</name>, and ships of great draught with many oars, and with black sails bellying in the breeze.</p>
<p><q>'The <name type="ORG">Corsairs</name> of <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Umbar</name>!'</q> men shouted. <q>'The <name type="ORG">Corsairs</name> of <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Umbar</name>! <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok! The <name type="ORG">Corsairs</name> of <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Umbar</name> are coming! So <name type="PERSON">Belfalas</name> is taken, and the <name type="ORG">Ethir</name>, and <name type="ORG">Lebennin</name> is g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. The <name type="ORG">Corsairs</name> are upon us! It is the last stroke of doom!'</q></p>
<p>And some without order, for n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> could he found to command them in the <name type="LOC">City</name>, ran to the bells and tolled the alarm; and some blew the trumpets sounding the retreat. <q>'Back to the walls!'</q> they c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed. <q>'Back to the walls! <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Come</name> back to the <name type="LOC">City</name> before all are overwhelmed!'</q> But the wind that sped the ships blew all their clamour away.</p>
<p>The Rohir<name type="GPE">ri</name>m indeed had no need of news or alarm. All too well they could see for themselves the black sails. For �omer was now scarcely <name type="QUANTITY">a mile</name> from the <name type="PERSON">Harlond</name>, and a great press of his <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> foes was between him and the haven there, while new foes came swirling behind, cutting him off from the P<name type="GPE">ri</name>nce. Now he looked to the <name type="LOC">River</name>, and hope died in his heart, and the wind that he had blessed he now called accursed. But the hosts of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> were enhear<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed, and filled with a new lust and fury they came yelling to the onset.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Stern</name> now was �omer's mood, and his mind clear again. He let blow the horns to rally all men to his banner that could come thither; for he thought to make a great shield-wall at the last, and stand, and fight there on foot till all fell, and do deeds of song on the fields of <name type="ORG">Pelennor</name>, though no man should be left in the <name type="LOC">West</name> to remember the last <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g of the <name type="PERSON">Mark</name>. So he rode to a green <name type="ORG">hill</name>ock and there set his banner, and the White <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>rse ran <name type="GPE">ri</name>ppling in the wind.</p>
<p>Out of doubt, out of dark to the <name type="DATE">day</name>'s <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing</p>
<p>I came singing in the sun, sword unsheathing.</p>
<p>To hope's end I rode and to heart's breaking:</p>
<p>Now for wrath, now for ruin and a red <name type="TIME">night</name>fall!</p>
<p>These staves he spoke, yet he laughed as he said them. For once more lust of battle was on him; and he was still unscathed, and he was young, and he was king: the lord of a fell people. And lo! even as he laughed at despair he looked out again on the black ships, and he lifted up his sword to defy them.</p>
<p>And then wonder took him, and a great joy; and he cast his sword up in the sunlight and sang as he caught it. And all eyes followed his gaze, and behold! upon the foremost ship a great standard broke, and the wind displayed it as she turned towards the <name type="PERSON">Harlond</name>. There flowered a White <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>, and that was for <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>; but <name type="CARDINAL">Seven</name> <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Stars</name> were about it, and a high crown above it, the signs of <name type="PERSON">Elen</name>dil that no lord had borne for <name type="DATE">year</name>s beyond count. And the stars flamed in the sunlight, for they were wrought of gems by <name type="PERSON">Arwen</name> daughter of <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name>; and the crown was b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght in the <name type="TIME">morning</name>, for it was wrought of <name type="PERSON">mith<name type="GPE">ri</name>l</name> and gold.</p>
<p>Thus came <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> son of <name type="ORG">Arathorn</name>, <name type="ORG">Elessar</name>, <name type="ORG">Isildur</name>'s heir, out of <name type="WORK_OF_ART">the Paths of the Dead</name>, borne upon a wind from the <name type="LOC">Sea</name> to the kingdom of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>; and the mirth of the Rohir<name type="GPE">ri</name>m was a torrent of laughter and a flashing of swords, and the joy and wonder of the <name type="LOC">City</name> was a music of trumpets and a <name type="GPE">ri</name>nging of bells. But the hosts of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> were seized with bewilderment, and a great wizardry it seemed to them that their own ships should be filled with their foes; and a black dread fell on them, knowing that the tides of fate had turned against them and their doom was at hand.</p>
<p><name type="LOC">East</name> rode the k<name type="TIME">night</name>s of Dol <name type="PERSON">Amroth</name> d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ving the enemy before them: troll-men and <name type="GPE">Va<name type="GPE">ri</name>ags</name> and orcs that hated the sunlight. <name type="LOC">South</name> strode �omer and men fled before his face, and they were caught between the hammer and the anvil. For now men leaped from the ships to the quays of the <name type="PERSON">Harlond</name> and swept north like a storm. There came <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>, and <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> wielding his axe, and <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>barad with the standard, and <name type="ORG">Elladan</name> and <name type="ORG">Elrohir</name> with stars on their brow, and the dour-handed D�nedain, <name type="PRODUCT">Ranger</name>s of the <name type="LOC">North</name>, leading a great valour of the folk of <name type="ORG">Lebennin</name> and <name type="ORG">Lamedon</name> and the fiefs of the <name type="LOC">South</name>. But before all went <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> with the <name type="PERSON">Flame</name> of the <name type="LOC">West</name>, And�<name type="GPE">ri</name>l like a new fire kindled, <name type="ORG">Narsil</name> re-forged as deadly as of old: and upon his brow was the Star of <name type="PERSON">Elen</name>dil.</p>
<p>And so at length �omer and <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> met in the midst of the battle, and they leaned on their swords and looked on <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> another and were glad.</p>
<p><q>'Thus we meet again, though all the hosts of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> lay between us,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'Did I not say so at the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>rn<name type="GPE">burg</name>?'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="CARDINAL">'So</name> you spoke,'</q> said �omer, <q>'but hope oft deceives, and I knew not then that you were a man foresighted. Yet twice blessed is help unlooked for, and never was a meeting of f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends more joyful.'</q> And they clasped hand in hand. <q><name type="DATE">'No</name>r indeed more timely,'</q> said �omer. <q>'You come n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> too soon, my f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end. Much loss and sorrow has befallen us.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="ORG">'Then</name> let us avenge it, ere we speak of it!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>, and they rode back to battle together.</p>
<p>Hard fighting and long labour they had still; for the <name type="LOC">South</name>rons were bold men and g<name type="GPE">ri</name>m, and fierce in despair; and the <name type="LOC">East</name>erlings were strong and war-hardened and asked for <name type="DATE">no quarter</name>. And so in this place and that, by burned homestead or barn, upon <name type="ORG">hill</name>ock or mound, under wall or on field, still they gathered and rallied and fought until the <name type="DATE">day</name> wore away.</p>
<p>Then the <name type="ORG">Sun</name> went at last behind <name type="GPE">Min<name type="PERSON">dol</name>luin</name> and filled all the sky with a great burning, so that the <name type="ORG">hill</name>s and the mountains were dyed as with blood; fire glowed in the <name type="LOC">River</name>, and the grass of the <name type="ORG">Pelennor</name> lay red in the <name type="TIME">night</name>fall. And in that <name type="TIME">hour</name> the great <name type="PERSON">Battle</name> of the field of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> was over; and not <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> living foe was left within the circuit of the <name type="ORG">Rammas</name>. All were slain save those who fled to die, or to drown in the red foam of the <name type="LOC">River</name>. Few ever came eastward to <name type="PERSON">Morgul</name> or <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>; and to the land of the <name type="ORG">Harad</name><name type="GPE">ri</name>m came only a tale from far off: a rumour of the wrath and terror of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> and �omer and <name type="PERSON">Imrahil</name> rode back towards the <name type="FAC">Gate</name> of the <name type="LOC">City</name>, and they were now weary beyond joy or sorrow. These <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> were unscathed, for such was their fortune and the skill and might of their arms, and few indeed had dared to abide them or look on their faces in the <name type="TIME">hour</name> of their wrath. But many others were hurt or maimed or dead upon the field. The axes hewed <name type="PERSON">Forlong</name> as he fought al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> and unhorsed; and both <name type="PERSON">Duilin</name> of <name type="PERSON">Morthond</name> and his brother were trampled to death when they assailed the _m<name type="PERSON">�mak</name>il_, leading their bowmen close to shoot at the eyes of the monsters. Neither <name type="ORG">Hirluin</name> the fair would return to <name type="PERSON">Pinnath Gelin</name>, nor <name type="PERSON">G<name type="GPE">ri</name>m</name>bold to <name type="PERSON">G<name type="GPE">ri</name>m</name>slade, nor <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>barad to the <name type="LOC">North</name>lands, dour-handed <name type="PRODUCT">Ranger</name>. No few had fallen, renowned or nameless, captain or soldier; for it was a great battle and the full count of it no tale has told. So long afterward a maker in <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> said in his song of the Mounds of <name type="GPE">Mund<name type="GPE">burg</name></name>:</p>
<p>We heard of the horns in the <name type="ORG">hill</name>s <name type="GPE">ri</name>nging,</p>
<p>the swords shining in the <name type="LOC">South</name>-kingdom.</p>
<p>Steeds went st<name type="GPE">ri</name>ding to the Stoningland</p>
<p>as wind in the <name type="TIME">morning</name>. War was kindled.</p>
<p>There Th�oden fell, <name type="GPE">Thengling</name> mighty,</p>
<p>to his golden halls and green pastures</p>
<p>in the <name type="LOC">North</name>ern fields never returning,</p>
<p>high lord of the host. <name type="PERSON">Harding</name> and <name type="PERSON">Guthl</name>�f</p>
<p>D�nhere and D�orwine, doughty <name type="PERSON">G<name type="GPE">ri</name>m</name>bold,</p>
<p><name type="GPE">Herefara</name> and <name type="GPE">Herubrand</name>, <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>rn and Fastred,</p>
<p>fought and fell there in a far country:</p>
<p>in the Mounds of <name type="GPE">Mund<name type="GPE">burg</name></name> under mould they lie</p>
<p>with their league-fellows, lords of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>.</p>
<p>Neither <name type="ORG">Hirluin</name> the <name type="ORG">Fair</name> to the <name type="ORG">hill</name>s by the sea,</p>
<p>nor <name type="PERSON">Forlong</name> the old to the flowe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng <name type="GPE">vale</name>s</p>
<p>ever, to <name type="ORG">Arnach</name>, to his own country</p>
<p>returned in t<name type="GPE">ri</name>umph; nor the tall bowmen,</p>
<p><name type="GPE">Derufin</name> and <name type="PERSON">Duilin</name>, to their dark waters,</p>
<p>meres of <name type="PERSON">Morthond</name> under mountain-shadows.</p>
<p>Death in the <name type="TIME">morning</name> and at <name type="DATE">day</name>'s ending</p>
<p>lords took and lowly. <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ng now they sleep</p>
<p>under grass in <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> by the <name type="LOC">Great <name type="LOC">River</name></name>.</p>
<p><name type="ORG">Grey</name> now as tears, gleaming silver,</p>
<p>red then it rolled, roa<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng water:</p>
<p>foam dyed with blood flamed at sunset;</p>

<p>red fell the dew in <name type="ORG">Rammas</name> Echor.</p>

<p>The Pyre of <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name></p>
<p>When the dark shadow at the <name type="FAC">Gate</name> withdrew <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> still sat motionless. But <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> rose to his feet, as if a great w<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name> had been lifted from him; and he stood lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing to the horns, and it seemed to him that they would break his heart with joy. And never in after <name type="DATE">year</name>s could he hear a horn blown in the distance without tears starting in his eyes. But now suddenly his errand returned to his memory, and he ran forward. At that moment <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> stirred and spoke to <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>fax, and was about to <name type="GPE">ri</name>de through the <name type="FAC">Gate</name>.</p>
<p><name type="ORG">'<name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name></name>, <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>! ' c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>, and <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>fax halted.</p>
<p><q>'What are you doing here?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'Is it not a law in the <name type="LOC">City</name> that those who wear the black and silver must stay in the <name type="ORG">Citadel</name>, unless their lord gives them leave?'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="CARDINAL">'He</name> has,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q><name type="CARDINAL">'He</name> sent me away. But I am f<name type="GPE">ri</name>gh<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed. Something ter<name type="GPE">ri</name>ble may happen up there. The <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd is out of his mind, I think. I am afraid he will kill himself, and kill <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name> too. Can't you do something?'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> looked through the gaping <name type="FAC">Gate</name>, and already on the fields he heard the gathe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng sound of battle. He clenched his hand. <q>'I must go ' he said. 'The <name type="ORG">Black</name> <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name> is abroad, and he will yet b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng ruin on us. I have no time.'</q></p>
<p><q>'But <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name>!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q><name type="CARDINAL">'He</name> is not dead, and they will burn him alive, if some<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> does not stop them.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Burn him alive?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'What is this tale? Be quick!'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Denethor</name> has g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> to the <name type="PERSON">Tom</name>bs,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>, <q>'and he has taken <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name>, and he says we are all to burn, and he will not wait, and they are to make a pyre and burn him on it, and <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name> as well. And he has sent men to fetch wood and oil. And I have told <name type="PERSON">Beregond</name>, but I'm afraid he won't dare to leave his post: he is on guard. And what can he do anyway?'</q> So <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> poured out his tale, rea<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g up and tou<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>'s knee with trembling hands. <q>'Can't you save <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name>?'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="DATE">May</name>be I can,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>; <q>'but if I do, then others will die, I fear. Well, I must come, since no other help can reach him. But evil and sorrow will come of this. Even in the heart of our stronghold the Enemy has power to st<name type="GPE">ri</name>ke us: for his will it is that is at work.'</q></p>
<p>Then having made up his mind he acted swiftly; and cat<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g up <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> and setting him before him, he turned <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>fax with a word. Up the climbing streets of Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name> they clattered, while the noise of war rose behind them. Everywhere men were <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing from their despair and dread, seizing their weapons, crying <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> to another: <q>'<name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> has come!'</q> Captains were shouting, companies were muste<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng; many already were <name type="PERSON">mar</name><name type="PERSON">chin</name>g down to the <name type="FAC">Gate</name>.</p>
<p>They met the P<name type="GPE">ri</name>nce <name type="PERSON">Imrahil</name>, and he called to them: <q>'Whither now, <name type="LOC">Mithrandir</name>? The Rohir<name type="GPE">ri</name>m are fighting on the fields of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>! We must gather all the strength that we can find.'</q></p>
<p><q>'You will need every man and more,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'Make all haste. I will come when I can. But I have an errand to the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name> that will not wait. Take command in the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd's absence!'</q></p>
<p>They passed on; and as they climbed and drew near to the <name type="ORG">Citadel</name> they felt the wind blowing in their faces, and they caught the glimmer of <name type="TIME">morning</name> far away, a light growing in the southern sky. But it brought little hope to them, not knowing what evil lay before them, fea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng to come too late.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="PRODUCT">Darkness</name> is passing,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, <q>'but it still lies heavy on this <name type="LOC">City</name>.'</q></p>
<p>At the gate of the <name type="ORG">Citadel</name> they found no guard. <q><name type="ORG">'Then</name> <name type="PERSON">Beregond</name> has g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> more hopefully. They turned away and has<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed along the road to the Closed <name type="ORG">Door</name>. It stood wide open, and the porter lay before it. He was slain and his key had been taken.</p>
<p><q>'Work of the Enemy!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'Such deeds he loves: f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end at war with f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end; loyalty divided in confusion of hearts.'</q> Now he dismounted and bade <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>fax return to his stable. <q>'For, my f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end,'</q> he said, <q>'you and I should have <name type="GPE">ri</name>dden to the fields <name type="DATE">long ago</name>, but other matters delay me. Yet come swiftly if I call!'</q></p>
<p>They passed the <name type="ORG">Door</name> and walked on down the steep winding road. Light was growing, and the tall columns and <name type="PERSON">carven</name> figures beside the way went slowly by like grey ghosts.</p>
<p>Suddenly the silence was broken, and they heard below them c<name type="GPE">ri</name>es and the <name type="GPE">ri</name>nging of swords: such sounds as had not been heard in the hallowed places since the building of the <name type="LOC">City</name>. At last they came to <name type="ORG">Rath D�nen</name> and has<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed towards the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>use of the <name type="ORG">Steward</name>s, looming in the <name type="TIME">twilight</name> under its great dome.</p>
<p><q>'Stay! Stay!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>nging forward to the st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> stair before the door. <q>'Stay this madness!'</q></p>
<p>For there were the servants of <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name> with swords and torches in their hands; but al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> in the porch upon the topmost step stood <name type="PERSON">Beregond</name>, clad in the black and silver of the <name type="ORG">Guard</name>; and he held the door against them. <name type="CARDINAL">Two</name> of them had already fallen to his sword, staining the hallows with their blood; and the others cursed him, calling him outlaw and traitor to his master.</p>
<p>Even as <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> ran forward, they heard from within the house of the dead the voice of <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name> crying: <q><name type="PERSON">'Haste</name>, haste! Do as I have bidden! Slay me this renegade! Or must I do so myself?'</q> Thereupon the door which <name type="PERSON">Beregond</name> held shut with his left hand was wrenched open, and there behind him stood the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd of the <name type="LOC">City</name>, tall and fell; a light like flame was in his eyes, and he held a drawn sword.</p>
<p>But <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> sprang up the steps, and the men fell back from him and covered their eyes; for his coming was like the incoming of a white light into a dark place, and he came with great anger. He lifted up his hand, and in the very stroke, the sword of <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name> flew up and left his grasp and fell behind him in the shadows of the house; and <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name> stepped backward before <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> as <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> amazed.</p>
<p><q>'What is this, my lord?'</q> said the wizard. <q>'The houses of the dead are no places for the living. And why do men fight here in the <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>lows when there is war enough before the <name type="FAC">Gate</name>? Or has our Enemy come even to <name type="ORG">Rath D�nen</name>?'</q></p>
<p><q>'Since when has the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> been answerable to thee?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name>. <q>'Or may I not command my own servants?'</q></p>
<p><q>'You may,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'But others may contest your will, when it is turned to madness and evil. Where is your son, <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name>?'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="CARDINAL">'He</name> lies within,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name>, <q>'burning, already burning. They have set a fire in his flesh. But soon all shall be burned. The <name type="LOC">West</name> has failed. It shall all go up in a great fire, and all shall be ended. Ash! Ash and smoke blown away on the wind!'</q></p>
<p>Then <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> seeing the madness that was on him feared that he had already d<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> some evil deed, and he thrust forward, with <name type="PERSON">Beregond</name> and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> behind him, while <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name> gave back until he stood beside the table within. But there they found <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name>, still dreaming in his fever, lying upon the table. <name type="PERSON">Wood</name> was piled under it, and high all about it, and all was drenched with oil, even the garments of <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name> and the coverlets; but as yet no fire had been set to the fuel. Then <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> revealed the strength that lay hid in him; even as the light of his power was hidden under his grey mantle. He leaped up on to the faggots, and raising the sick man lightly he sprang down again, and bore him towards the door. But as he did so <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name> moaned and called on his father in his dream.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Denethor</name> started as <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> waking from a trance, and the flame died in his eyes, and he wept; and he said: <q>'Do not take my son from me! He calls for me.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="CARDINAL">'He</name> calls,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, <q>'but you cannot come to him yet. For he must seek healing on the threshold of death, and maybe find it not. Whereas your part is to go out to the battle of your <name type="LOC">City</name>, where maybe death awaits you. This you know in your heart.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="CARDINAL">'He</name> will not wake again,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name>. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Battle</name> is vain. Why should we wish to live longer? Why should we not go to death side by side?'</q></p>
<p><q>'Autho<name type="GPE">ri</name>ty is not given to you, <name type="ORG">Steward</name> of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>, to order the <name type="TIME">hour</name> of your death,'</q> answered <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q><name type="PERSON">'And</name> only the heathen kings, under the domination of the Dark <name type="ORG">Power</name>, did thus, slaying themselves in p<name type="GPE">ri</name>de and despair, murde<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng their kin to ease their own death.'</q> Then passing through the door he took <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name> from the deadly house and laid him on the bier on which he had been brought, and which had now been set in the porch. <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name> followed him, and stood trembling, looking with longing on the face of his son. And for a moment, while all were silent and still, wat<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd in his throes, he wavered.</p>
<p><q><name type="WORK_OF_ART">'<name type="WORK_OF_ART">Come</name></name>!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'We are needed. There is much that you can yet do.'</q></p>
<p>Then suddenly <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name> laughed. He stood up tall and proud again, and stepping swiftly back to the table he lifted from it the pillow on which his head had lain. Then coming to the doorway he drew aside the cove<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng, and lo! he had between his hands a _palant�r_. And as he held it up, it seemed to those that looked on that the globe began to glow with an inner flame, so that the lean face of the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd was lit as with a red fire, and it seemed cut out of hard st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, sharp with black shadows, noble, proud, and ter<name type="GPE">ri</name>ble. His eyes glittered.</p>
<p><q>'P<name type="GPE">ri</name>de and despair!'</q> he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed. <q>'Didst thou think that the eyes of the White <name type="FAC">Tower</name> were blind? <name type="PERSON">Nay</name>, I have seen more than thou knowest, <name type="ORG">Grey</name> Fool. For thy hope is but ignorance. Go then and labour in healing! Go forth and fight! Vanity. For a little space you may t<name type="GPE">ri</name>umph on the field, for <name type="DATE">a <name type="DATE">day</name></name>. But against the <name type="ORG">Power</name> that now a<name type="GPE">ri</name>ses there is no victory. To this <name type="LOC">City</name> only the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> finger of its hand has yet been stretched. All the <name type="LOC">East</name> is moving. And even now the wind of thy hope cheats thee and wafts up <name type="GPE">Anduin</name> a fleet with black sails. The <name type="LOC">West</name> has failed. It is time for all to depart who would not be slaves.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Such counsels will make the Enemy's victory certain indeed,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>pe on then!'</q> laughed <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name>. 'Do I not know thee, <name type="LOC">Mithrandir</name>? Thy hope is to rule in my stead, to stand behind every thr<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, north, south, or west. I have read thy mind and its policies. Do I not know that you commanded this <name type="CARDINAL">half</name>ling here to keep silence? That you brought him hither to be a spy within my very chamber? And yet in our speech together I have learned the names and purpose of all thy companions. So! With the left hand thou wouldst use me for a little while as a shield against <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>, and with the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng up this <name type="PRODUCT">Ranger</name> of the <name type="LOC">North</name> to supplant me.</p>
<p><q>'But I say to thee, <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> <name type="LOC">Mithrandir</name>, I will not be thy tool! I am <name type="ORG">Steward</name> of the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>use of An�<name type="GPE">ri</name>on. I will not step down to be the dotard chamberlain of an upstart. Even were his claim proved to me, still he comes but of the line of <name type="ORG">Isildur</name>. I will not bow to such a <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, last of a ragged house long bereft of lordship and dignity.'</q></p>
<p><q>'What then would you have,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, <q>'if your will could have its way?'</q></p>
<p><q>'I would have things as they were in <name type="DATE">all the <name type="DATE">day</name>s</name> of my life,'</q> answered <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name>, <q>'and in the <name type="DATE">day</name>s of my longfathers before me: to be the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd of this <name type="LOC">City</name> in peace, and leave my c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>r to a son after me, who would be his own master and no wizard's pupil. But if doom denies this to me, then I will have _naught_: neither life diminished, nor love halved, nor honour abated.'</q></p>
<p><q>'To me it would not seem that a <name type="ORG">Steward</name> who faithfully surrenders his charge is diminished in love or in honour,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q><name type="PERSON">'And</name> at the least you shall not rob your son of his choice while his death is still in doubt.'</q></p>
<p>At those words <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name>'s eyes flamed again, and taking the <name type="ORG">St<name type="CARDINAL">one</name></name> under his arm he drew a knife and strode towards the bier. But <name type="PERSON">Beregond</name> sprang forward and set himself before <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name>.</p>
<p><q><name type="CARDINAL">'So</name>!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name>. <q>'Thou hadst already stolen <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> my son's love. Now thou stealest the hearts of my k<name type="TIME">night</name>s also, so that they rob me wholly of my son at the <name type="DATE">last.</name> But in this at least thou shalt not defy my will: to rule my own end.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="WORK_OF_ART">'<name type="WORK_OF_ART">Come</name></name> hither!'</q> he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed to his servants. <q><name type="WORK_OF_ART">'<name type="WORK_OF_ART">Come</name></name>, if you are not all recreant!'</q> Then <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> of them ran up the steps to him. <name type="PERSON">Swift</name>ly he snatched a torch from the hand of <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> and sprang back into the house. Before <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> could hinder him he thrust the brand amid the fuel, and at once it crackled and roared into flame.</p>
<p>Then <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name> leaped upon the table, and standing there wreathed in fire and smoke he took up the staff of his stewardship that lay at his feet and broke it on his knee. Casting the pieces into the blaze he bowed and laid himself on the table, clasping the _palant�r_ with both hands upon his breast. And it was said that ever after, if any man looked in that <name type="ORG">St<name type="CARDINAL">one</name></name>, unless he had a great strength of will to turn it to other purpose, he saw <name type="CARDINAL">only <name type="CARDINAL">two</name></name> aged hands withe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng in flame.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> in g<name type="GPE">ri</name>ef and horror turned his face away and closed the door. For a while he stood in thought, silent upon the threshold, while those outside heard the greedy roa<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng of the fire within. And then <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name> gave a great cry, and afterwards spoke no more, nor was ever again seen by mortal men.</p>
<p><q><name type="CARDINAL">'So</name> passes <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name>, son of <name type="ORG">Ecthelion</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>: Then he turned to <name type="PERSON">Beregond</name> and the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd's servants that stood there aghast. <name type="PERSON">'And</name> so pass also the <name type="DATE">day</name>s of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> that you have known; for good or evil they are ended. Ill deeds have been d<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> here; but let now all enmity that lies between you be put away, for it was cont<name type="GPE">ri</name>ved by the Enemy and works his will. You have been caught in a net of war<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng duties that you did not weave. But think, you servants of the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd, blind in your obedience, that but for the treason of <name type="PERSON">Beregond</name> <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name>, Captain of the White <name type="FAC">Tower</name>, would now also be burned.</p>
<p><q>'Bear away from this unhappy place your comrades who have fallen. And we will bear <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name>, <name type="ORG">Steward</name> of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>, to a place where he can sleep in peace, or die if that be his doom.'</q></p>
<p>Then <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> and <name type="PERSON">Beregond</name> taking up the bier bore it away towards the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>uses of Healing, while behind them walked <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> with downcast head. But the servants of the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd stood gazing as st<name type="GPE">ri</name>cken men at the house of the dead; and even as <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> came to the end of <name type="ORG">Rath D�nen</name> there was a great noise. <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>oking back they saw the dome of the house crack and smokes issue forth; and then with a rush and rumble of st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> it fell in a flurry of fire; but still unabated the flames danced and flickered among the ruins. Then in terror the servants fled and followed <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>.</p>
<p>At length they came back to the <name type="ORG">Steward</name>'s <name type="ORG">Door</name>, and <name type="PERSON">Beregond</name> looked with g<name type="GPE">ri</name>ef at the porter. <q>'This deed I shall ever rue,'</q> he said; <q>'but a madness of haste was on me, and he would not lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>, but drew sword against me.'</q> Then taking the key that he had wrested from the slain man he closed the door and locked it. <q>'This should now be given to the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name>,'</q> he said.</p>
<p><q>'The P<name type="GPE">ri</name>nce of Dol <name type="PERSON">Amroth</name> is in command in the absence of the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>; <q>'but since he is not here, I must take this on myself. I bid you keep the key and guard it, until the <name type="LOC">City</name> is set in order again.'</q></p>
<p>Now at last they passed into the high circles of the <name type="LOC">City</name>, and in the light of <name type="TIME">morning</name> they went their way towards the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>uses of Healing; and these were fair houses set apart, for the care of those who were g<name type="GPE">ri</name>evously sick, but now they were prepared for the <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ding of men hurt in battle or dying. They stood not far from the <name type="ORG">Citadel</name>-gate, in the <name type="CARDINAL">six</name>th circle, nigh to its southward wall, and about them was a garden and a greensward with trees, the only such place in the <name type="LOC">City</name>. There dwelt the few women that had been permitted to remain in Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name>, since they were skilled in healing or in the service of the healers.</p>
<p>But even as <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> and his companions came carrying the bier to the main door of the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>uses, they heard a great cry that went up from the field before the <name type="FAC">Gate</name> and <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing sh<name type="GPE">ri</name>ll and piercing into the sky passed, and died away on the wind. So ter<name type="GPE">ri</name>ble was the cry that for a moment all stood still, and yet when it had passed, suddenly their hearts were lifted up in such a hope as they had not known since the darkness came out of the <name type="LOC">East</name>; and it seemed to them that the light grew clear and the sun broke through the clouds.</p>
<p>But <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>'s face was grave and sad, and bidding <name type="PERSON">Beregond</name> and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> to take <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name> into the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>uses of Healing, he went up on to the walls nearby; and there like a figure <name type="PERSON">carven</name> in white he stood in the new sun and looked out. And he beheld with the sight that was given to him all that had befallen; and when �omer rode out from the forefront of his battle and stood beside those who lay upon the field, he sighed, and he cast his cloak about him again, and went from the walls. And <name type="PERSON">Beregond</name> and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> found him standing in thought before the door of the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>uses when they came out.</p>
<p>They looked at him, and for a while he was silent. At last he spoke. <q><name type="CARDINAL">'My</name> f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends,'</q> he said, 'and all you people of this city and of the <name type="LOC">West</name>ern lands! Things of great sorrow and renown have come to pass. Shall we weep or be glad? Beyond hope the Captain of our foes has been destroyed, and you have heard the echo of his last despair. But he has not g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> without woe and bitter loss. And that I might have averted but for the madness of <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name>. So long has the reach of our Enemy become! <name type="PERSON">Alas</name>! but now I perceive how his will was able to enter into the very heart of the <name type="LOC">City</name>.</p>
<p><q>'Though the <name type="ORG">Steward</name>s deemed that it was a <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret kept only by themselves, <name type="DATE">long ago</name> I guessed that here in the White <name type="FAC">Tower</name>, <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> at least of the <name type="CARDINAL">Seven</name> Seeing <name type="ORG">St<name type="CARDINAL">one</name></name>s was preserved. In the <name type="DATE">day</name>s of his wisdom <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name> did not presume to use it, nor to challenge <name type="ORG">Sauron</name>, knowing the limits of his own strength. But his wisdom failed; and I fear that as the pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>l of his realm grew he looked in the <name type="ORG">St<name type="CARDINAL">one</name></name> and was deceived: far too of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>, I guess, since <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> departed. He was too great to be subdued to the will of the Dark <name type="ORG">Power</name>, he saw n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>theless only those things which that <name type="ORG">Power</name> permitted him to see. The knowledge which he obtained was, doubtless, of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> of service to him; yet the vision of the great might of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> that was shown to him <name type="ORG">fed</name> the despair of his heart until it overthrew his mind.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'No</name>w I understand what seemed so strange to me!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> shudde<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng at his memo<name type="GPE">ri</name>es as he spoke. <q>'The <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd went away from the room where <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name> lay; and it was only when he returned that I <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> thought he was changed, old and broken.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'It</name> was in the very <name type="TIME">hour</name> that <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name> was brought to the <name type="FAC">Tower</name> that many of us saw a strange light in the topmost chamber,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Beregond</name>. <q>'But we have seen that light before, and it has long been rumoured in the <name type="LOC">City</name>, that the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd would at times wrestle in thought with his Enemy.'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Alas</name>! then I have guessed <name type="GPE">ri</name>ghtly,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. 'Thus the will of <name type="ORG">Sauron</name> entered into Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name>; and thus I have been delayed here. And here I shall still be forced to remain, for I shall soon have other charges, not <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name> only.</p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'No</name>w I must go down to meet those who come. I have seen a sight upon the field that is very g<name type="GPE">ri</name>evous to my heart, and greater sorrow may yet come to pass. <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Come</name> with me, <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>! But you, <name type="PERSON">Beregond</name>, should return to the <name type="ORG">Citadel</name> and tell the chief of the <name type="ORG">Guard</name> there what has befallen. It will be his duty, I fear, to withdraw you from the <name type="ORG">Guard</name>; but say to him that, if I may give him counsel, you should be sent to the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>uses of Healing, to be the guard and servant of your captain, and to be at his side when he awakes � if that shall ever be again. For by you he was saved from the fire. Go now! I shall return soon.'</q></p>
<p>With that he turned away and went with <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> down towards the lower city. And even as they has<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed on their way the wind brought a grey rain, and all the fires sank, and there arose a great smoke before them.</p>
</chapter><chapter num="8"><heading>Chapter 8</heading>
<p>The <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>uses of Healing</p>
<p>A mist was in <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>'s eyes of tears and wea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ness when they drew near the ruined <name type="FAC">Gate</name> of Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name>. He gave little heed to the wreck and slaughter that lay about all. <name type="ORG">Fire</name> and smoke and s<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ch was in the air; for many engines had been burned or cast into the fire-pits, and many of the slain also, while here and there lay many carcases of the great <name type="LOC">South</name>ron monsters, <name type="CARDINAL">half</name>-burned, or broken by st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>-cast, or shot through the eyes by the valiant archers of <name type="PERSON">Morthond</name>. The flying rain had ceased for a time, and the sun gleamed up above; but all the lower city was still wrapped in a smoulde<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng <name type="GPE">reek</name>.</p>
<p>Already men were labou<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng to clear a way through the jetsam of battle; and now out from the <name type="FAC">Gate</name> came some bea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng litters. Gently they laid <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name> upon soft pillows; but the king's body they covered with a great cloth of gold, and they bore torches about him, and their flames, pale in the sunlight, were fluttered by the wind.</p>
<p>So Th�oden and <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name> came to the <name type="LOC">City</name> of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>, and all who saw them bared their heads and bowed; and they passed through the ash and fume of the burned circle, and went on and up along the streets of st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. To <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> the ascent seemed <name type="GPE">agelong</name>, a meaningless journey in a hateful dream, going on and on to some dim ending that memory cannot seize.</p>
<p>Slowly the lights of the torches in front of him flickered and went out, and he was walking in a darkness; and he thought: <q>'This is a tunnel leading to a <name type="PERSON">tom</name>b; there we shall stay forever.'</q> But suddenly into his dream there fell a living voice.</p>
<p><q>'Well, <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>! Thank goodness I have found you!'</q></p>
<p>He looked up and the mist before his eyes cleared a little. There was <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>! They were face to face in a narrow lane, and but for themselves it was empty. He rubbed his eyes.</p>
<p><q>'Where is the king?'</q> he said. <q><name type="PERSON">'And</name> <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name>?'</q> Then he stumbled and sat down on a doorstep and began to weep again.</p>
<p><q>'They have g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> up into the <name type="ORG">Citadel</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q>'I think you must have fallen asleep on your feet and taken the wrong turning. When we found that you were not with them, <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> sent me to look for you. Poor old <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>! <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w glad I am to see you again! But you are worn out, and I won't bother you with any talk. But tell me, are you hurt, or wounded?'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'No</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'Well, no, I don't think so. But I can't use my <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght arm, <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>, not since I stabbed him. And my sword burned all away like a piece of wood.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>'s face was anxious. <q>'Well, you had better come with me as quick as you can,'</q> he said. <q>'I wish I could carry you. You aren't fit to walk any further. They shouldn't have let you walk at all; but you must forgive them. So many dreadful things have happened in the <name type="LOC">City</name>, <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>, that <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> poor hobbit coming in from the battle is easily overlooked.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'It</name>'s not always a misfortune being overlooked,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'I was overlooked just now by � no, no, I can't speak of it. Help me, <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>! It's all going dark again, and my arm is so cold.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Lean on me, <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> lad!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q><name type="WORK_OF_ART">'<name type="WORK_OF_ART">Come</name></name> now! Foot by foot. It's not far.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Are you going to bury me?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>.</p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'No</name>, indeed!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>, trying to sound cheerful, though his heart was wrung with fear and pity. <q><name type="DATE">'No</name>, we are going to the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>uses of Healing.'</q></p>
<p>They turned out of the lane that ran between tall houses and the outer wall of the <name type="CARDINAL">four</name>th circle, and they regained the main street climbing <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name> the <name type="ORG">Citadel</name>. Step by step they went, while <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> swayed and murmured as <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> in sleep.</p>
<p><q>'I'll never get him there,'</q> thought <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q>'Is there no <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> to help me? I can't leave him here.'</q> Just then to his surp<name type="GPE">ri</name>se a boy came running up behind, and as he passed he recognized <name type="PERSON">Bergil</name> <name type="PERSON">Beregond</name>'s son.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="ORG">Hullo</name>, <name type="PERSON">Bergil</name>!'</q> he called. <q>'Where are you going? Glad to see you again, and still alive!'</q></p>
<p><q>'I am running errands for the <name type="ORG">Healers</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Bergil</name>. <q>'I cannot stay.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Don't!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q>'But tell them up there that I have a sick hobbit, a _<name type="NORP">pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>an</name>_ mind you, come from the battle-field. I don't think he can walk so far. If <name type="LOC">Mithrandir</name> is there, he will be glad of the message.'</q> <name type="PERSON">Bergil</name> ran on.</p>
<p><q>'I'd better wait here,'</q> thought <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. So he let <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> sink gently down on to the pavement in a patch of sunlight, and then he sat down beside him, laying <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>'s head in his lap. He felt his body and limbs gently, and took his f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end's hands in his own. The <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght hand felt icy to the touch.</p>
<p>It was not long before <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> himself came in search of them. He stooped over <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> and caressed his brow; then he lifted him carefully. <q><name type="CARDINAL">'He</name> should have been borne in honour into this city,'</q> he said. <q><name type="CARDINAL">'He</name> has well repaid my trust; for if <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name> had not yielded to me, neither of you would have set out; and then far more g<name type="GPE">ri</name>evous would the evils of this <name type="DATE">day</name> have been.'</q> He sighed. <q><name type="PERSON">'And</name> yet here is another charge on my hands, while all the time the battle hangs in the balance.'</q></p>
<p>So at last <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name> and <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name> and <name type="PERSON">Me<name type="GPE">ri</name>adoc</name> were laid in beds in the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>uses of Healing; and there they were <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ded well. For though all lore was in these latter <name type="DATE">day</name>s fallen from its fullness of old, <name type="PERSON">the lee</name>chcraft of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> was still wise, and skilled in the healing of wound and hurt, and all such sickness as east of the <name type="LOC">Sea</name> mortal men were subject to. Save old age only. For that they had found no cure; and indeed the span of their lives had now <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ed to little more than that of other men, and those among them who passed the tale of <name type="CARDINAL">five</name> score <name type="DATE">year</name>s with vigour were grown few, save in some houses of purer blood. But now their art and knowledge were baffled; for there were many sick of a malady that would not be healed; and they called it the <name type="ORG">Black</name> <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>, for it came from <name type="FAC">the Nazg�l.</name> And those who were st<name type="GPE">ri</name>cken with it fell slowly into an ever deeper dream, and then passed to silence and a deadly cold, and so died. And it seemed to the <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ders of the sick that on the <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>fling and on the <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> this malady lay heavily. Still at whiles as the <name type="TIME">morning</name> wore away they would speak, murmu<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng in their dreams; and the watchers lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed to all that they said, hoping perhaps to learn something that would help them to understand their hurts. But soon they began to fall down into the darkness, and as the sun turned west a grey shadow crept over their faces. But <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name> burned with a fever that would not abate.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> went from <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> to the other full of care, and he was told all that the watchers could hear. And so the <name type="DATE">day</name> passed, while the great battle outside went on with shifting hopes and strange tidings; and still <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> waited and watched and did not go forth; till at last the red sunset filled all the sky, and the light through the windows fell on the grey faces of the sick. Then it seemed to those who stood by that in the glow the faces flushed softly as with health returning, but it was only a mockery of hope.</p>
<p>Then an old wife, <name type="ORG">Ioreth</name>, the eldest of the women who served in that house, looking on the fair face of <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name>, wept, for all the people loved him. And she said: <q>'<name type="PERSON">Alas</name>! if he should die. Would that there were kings in <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>, as there were once upon a time, they say! For it is said in old lore: _The hands of the king are the hands of a healer_. And so the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ghtful king could ever be known.'</q></p>
<p>And <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, who stood by, said: <q>'<name type="ORG">Men</name> may long remember your words, <name type="ORG">Ioreth</name>! For there is hope in them. <name type="DATE">May</name>be a king has indeed returned to <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>; or have you not heard the strange tidings that have come to the <name type="LOC">City</name>?'</q></p>
<p><q>'I have been too busy with this and that to heed all the crying and shouting,'</q> she answered. <q><name type="PERSON">'All</name> I hope is that those murde<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng devils do not come to this <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>use and trouble the sick.'</q></p>
<p>Then <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> went out in haste, and already the fire in the sky was burning out, and the smoulde<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng <name type="ORG">hill</name>s were fading, while ash-grey <name type="TIME">evening</name> crept over the fields.</p>
<p>Now as the sun went down <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> and �omer and <name type="PERSON">Imrahil</name> drew near the <name type="LOC">City</name> with their captains and k<name type="TIME">night</name>s; and when they came before the <name type="FAC">Gate</name> <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> said:</p>
<p><q>'Behold the <name type="ORG">Sun</name> setting in a great fire! It is a sign of the end and fall of many things, and a change in the tides of the world. But this <name type="LOC">City</name> and realm has rested in the charge of the <name type="ORG">Steward</name>s for many <name type="DATE">long <name type="DATE">year</name>s</name>, and I fear that if I enter it unbidden, then doubt and debate may a<name type="GPE">ri</name>se, which should not be while this war is fought. I will not enter in, nor make any claim, until it be seen whether we or <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> shall prevail. <name type="ORG">Men</name> shall pitch my <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ts upon the field, and here I will await the welcome of the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd of the <name type="LOC">City</name>.'</q></p>
<p>But �omer said: <q>'Already you have raised the banner of the <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>gs and displayed the tokens of <name type="PERSON">Elen</name>dil's <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>use. Will you suffer these to be challenged?'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'No</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'But I deem the time un<name type="GPE">ri</name>pe; and I have no mind for st<name type="GPE">ri</name>fe except with our Enemy and his servants.'</q></p>
<p>And the P<name type="GPE">ri</name>nce <name type="PERSON">Imrahil</name> said. Your words, lord, are wise, if <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> who is a kinsman of the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name> may counsel you in this matter. He is strong-willed and proud, but old; and his mood has been strange since his son was st<name type="GPE">ri</name>cken down. Yet I would not have you remain like a beggar at the door.'</p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'No</name>t a beggar,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'Say a captain of the <name type="PRODUCT">Ranger</name>s, who are unused to cities and houses of st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>.'</q> And he commanded that his banner should be furled; and he did off the Star of the <name type="LOC">North</name> <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>gdom and gave it to the keeping of the sons of <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name>.</p>
<p>Then the P<name type="GPE">ri</name>nce <name type="PERSON">Imrahil</name> and �omer of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> left him and passed through the <name type="LOC">City</name> and the tumult of the people, and mounted to the <name type="ORG">Citadel</name>; and they came to the <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>l of the <name type="FAC">Tower</name>, seeking the <name type="ORG">Steward</name>. But they found his c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>r empty, and before the dais lay Th�oden <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g of the <name type="PERSON">Mark</name> upon a bed of state; and <name type="CARDINAL">twelve</name> torches stood about it, and <name type="CARDINAL">twelve</name> guards, k<name type="TIME">night</name>s both of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> and <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>. And the hangings of the bed were of green and white, but upon the king was laid the great cloth of gold <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name> his breast, and upon that his unsheathed sword, and at his feet his shield, The light of the torches shimmered in his white <name type="PERSON">hai</name>r like sun in the spray of a fountain, but his face was fair and young, save that a peace lay on it beyond the reach of youth; and it seemed that he slept.</p>
<p>When they had stood silent for a time beside the king, <name type="PERSON">Imrahil</name> said: <q>'Where is the <name type="ORG">Steward</name>? And where also is <name type="LOC">Mithrandir</name>?'</q></p>
<p>And <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the guards answered: <q>'The <name type="ORG">Steward</name> of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> is in the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>uses of Healing.'</q></p>
<p>But �omer said: <q>'Where is the <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name>, my sister; for surely she should be lying beside the king, and in no less honour? Where have they bestowed her?'</q></p>
<p>And <name type="PERSON">Imrahil</name> said: <q>'But the <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name> was yet living when they bore her hither. Did you not know?'</q></p>
<p>Then hope unlooked-for came so suddenly to �omer's heart, and with it the bite of care and fear renewed, that he said no more, but turned and went swiftly from the hall; and the P<name type="GPE">ri</name>nce followed him. And when they came forth <name type="TIME">evening</name> had fallen and many stars were in the sky. And there came <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> on foot and with him <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> cloaked in grey; and they met before the doors of the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>uses of Healing. And they greeted <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> and said: <q>'We seek the <name type="ORG">Steward</name>, and men say that he is in this <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>use. Has any hurt befallen him? And the <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name>, where is she?'</q></p>
<p>And <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> answered: <q>'She lies within and is not dead, but is near death. But the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name> was wounded by an evil dart, as you have heard, and he is now the <name type="ORG">Steward</name>; for <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name> has departed, and his house is in ashes.'</q> And they were filled with g<name type="GPE">ri</name>ef and wonder at the tale that he told.</p>
<p>But <name type="PERSON">Imrahil</name> said: <q><name type="CARDINAL">'So</name> victory is shorn of gladness, and it is bitter bought, if both <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> and <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> are in <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> <name type="DATE">day</name> bereft of their lords. �omer rules the Rohir<name type="GPE">ri</name>m. Who shall rule the <name type="LOC">City</name> meanwhile? Shall we not send now for the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>?'</q></p>
<p>And the cloaked man spoke and said: <q><name type="CARDINAL">'He</name> is come.'</q> And they saw as he stepped into the light of the lantern by the door that it was <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>, wrapped in the grey cloak of L�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en above his mail, and bea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng no other token than the green st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of <name type="PERSON">Galad<name type="GPE">ri</name>el</name>. <q>'I have come because <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> begs me to do so,'</q> he said. <q>'But for the present I am but the Captain of the D�nedain of <name type="PERSON">Arnor</name>; and the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd of Dol <name type="PERSON">Amroth</name> shall rule the <name type="LOC">City</name> until <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name> awakes. But it is my counsel that <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> should rule us all in the <name type="DATE">day</name>s that follow and in our dealings with the Enemy.'</q> And they agreed upon that.</p>
<p>Then <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> said: <q>'Let us not stay at the door, for the time is urgent. Let us enter! For it is only in the coming of <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> that any hope remains for the sick that lie in the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>use. Thus spake <name type="ORG">Ioreth</name>, wise-woman of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>: _The hands of the king are the hands of a healer, and so shall the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ghtful king be known_.'</q></p>
<p>Then <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> entered <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> and the others followed. And there at the door were <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> guards in the livery of the <name type="ORG">Citadel</name>: <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> tall, but the other scarce the h<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name> of a boy; and when he saw them he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed aloud in surp<name type="GPE">ri</name>se and joy.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>! <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w splendid! Do you know, I guessed it was you in the black ships. But they were all shouting _corsairs_ and wouldn't lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> to me. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w did you do it?'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> laughed, and took the hobbit by the hand. <q>'Well met indeed!'</q> he said. <q>'But there is not time yet for travellers' tales.'</q></p>
<p>But <name type="PERSON">Imrahil</name> said to �omer: <q>'Is it thus that we speak to our kings? Yet maybe he will wear his crown in some other name!'</q></p>
<p>And <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> hea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng him, turned and said: <q>'Ve<name type="GPE">ri</name>ly, for in the high tongue of old I am _<name type="ORG">Elessar</name>_, the _<name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name>st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>_, and _Envinyatar_, the Renewer': and he lifted from his breast the green st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> that lay there. 'But <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> shall be the name of my house, if that be ever established. In the high tongue it will not sound so ill, and _Telcontar_ I will be and all the heirs of my body.'</q></p>
<p>And with that they passed into the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>use; and as they went towards the rooms where the sick were <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ded <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> told of the deeds of <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name> and <name type="PERSON">Me<name type="GPE">ri</name>adoc</name>. <q>'For,'</q> he said, <q>'long have I stood by them and at <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> they spoke much in their dreaming, before they sank into the deadly darkness. Also it is given to me to see many things far off.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> went <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> to <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name>, and then to the <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name>, and last to <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. When he had looked on the faces of the sick and seen their hurts he sighed. <q><name type="CARDINAL">'He</name>re I must put forth all such power and skill as is given to me,'</q> he said. <q>'Would that <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name> were here, for he is the eldest of all our race, and has the greater power.'</q></p>
<p>And �omer seeing that he was sorrowful and weary said: <q>'<name type="ORDINAL">First</name> you must rest, surely, and at the least eat a little?'</q></p>
<p>But <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> answered: <q>'<name type="PERSON">Nay</name>, for these <name type="CARDINAL">three</name>, and most soon for <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name>, time is running out. All speed is needed.'</q></p>
<p>Then he called to <name type="ORG">Ioreth</name> and he said: <q>'You have store in this <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>use of the herbs of healing?'</q></p>
<p><q>'Yes, lord,'</q> she answered; <q>'but not enough, I reckon, for all that will need them. But I am sure I do not know where we shall find more; for all things are amiss in these dreadful <name type="DATE">day</name>s, what with fires and burnings, and the lads that run errands so few, and all the roads blocked. Why, it is <name type="DATE">day</name>s out of count since ever a car<name type="GPE">ri</name>er came in from <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ssarnach to the <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ket! But we do our best in this <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>use with what we have, as I am sure your lordship will know.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I will judge that when I see,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q><name type="CARDINAL">'<name type="CARDINAL">One</name></name> thing also is short time for speech. Have you _athelas_?'</q></p>
<p><q>'I do not know, I am sure, lord,'</q> she answered, <q>'at least not by that name. I will go and ask of the herb-master; he knows all the old names.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'It</name> is also called _kingsfoil_,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>; <q>'and maybe you know it by that name, for so the country-folk call it in these latter <name type="DATE">day</name>s.'</q> <q><name type="DATE">'Oh</name> that!'</q> said <name type="ORG">Ioreth</name>. <q>'Well, if your lordship had named it at <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> I could have told you. No, we have n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of it, I am sure. Why, I have never heard that it had any great virtue; and indeed I have of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> said to my sisters when we came upon it growing in the woods: "kingsfoil" I said, " 'tis a strange name, and I wonder why 'tis called so; for if I were a king, I would have plants more b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght in my garden". Still it smells sweet when bruised, does it not? If sweet is the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght word: wholesome, maybe, is nearer.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="CARDINAL">'Who</name>lesome ve<name type="GPE">ri</name>ly,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q><name type="PERSON">'And</name> now, dame, if you love the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name>, run as quick as your tongue and get me kingsfoil, if there is a leaf in the <name type="LOC">City</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="PERSON">'And</name> if not,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, <q>'I will <name type="GPE">ri</name>de to <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ssarnach with <name type="ORG">Ioreth</name> behind me, and she shall take me to the woods, but not to her sisters. And <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>fax shall show her the meaning of haste.'</q></p>
<p>When <name type="ORG">Ioreth</name> was g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> bade the other women to make water hot. Then he took <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name>'s hand in his, and laid the other hand upon the sick man's brow. It was drenched with sweat; but <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name> did not move or make any sign, and seemed hardly to breathe.</p>
<p><q><name type="CARDINAL">'He</name> is nearly spent,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> turning to <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'But this comes not from the wound. See! that is healing. Had he been smit<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> by some dart of the Nazg�l, as you thought, he would have died that <name type="TIME">night</name>. This hurt was given by some <name type="LOC">South</name>ron arrow, I would guess. Who drew it forth? Was it kept?'</q></p>
<p><q>'I drew it forth,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Imrahil</name>, <q>'and staunched the wound. But I did not keep the arrow, for we had much to do. It was, as I remember, just such a dart as the <name type="LOC">South</name>rons use. Yet I believed that it came from the <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>s above, for else his fever and sickness were not to be understood; since the wound was not deep or vital. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w then do you read the matter?'</q></p>
<p><q>'Wea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ness, g<name type="GPE">ri</name>ef for his father's mood, a wound, and over all the <name type="ORG">Black</name> Breath,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q><name type="CARDINAL">'He</name> is a man of staunch will, for already he had come close under the <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name> before ever he rode to battle on the out-walls. Slowly the dark must have crept on him, even as he fought and strove to hold his outpost. Would that I could have been here so<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>r!'</q></p>
<p>Thereupon the herb-master entered. <q>'Your lordship asked for kingsfoil, as the rustics name it, he said; or _athelas_ in the noble tongue, or to those who know somewhat of the <name type="PRODUCT">Valinor</name>ean. . .'</q></p>
<p><q>'I do so,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>, <q>'and I care not whether you say now _as�a aranion_ or _kingsfoil_, so long as you have some.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Your pardon lord!'</q> said the man. 'I see you are a lore-master, not merely a captain of war. But alas! sir, we do not keep this thing in the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>uses of Healing, where only the gravely hurt or sick are <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ded. For it has no virtue that we know of, save perhaps to swee<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> a fouled air, or to d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ve away some passing heaviness. Unless, of course, you give heed to rhymes of old <name type="DATE">day</name>s which women such as our good <name type="ORG">Ioreth</name> still repeat without understanding.</p>
<p>When the black breath blows</p>
<p>and death's shadow grows</p>
<p>and all lights pass,</p>
<p>come athelas! come athelas!</p>
<p>Life to the dying</p>
<p>In the king's hand lying!</p>
<p>It is but a doggrel, I fear, garbled in the memory of old wives. Its meaning I leave to your judgement, if indeed it has any. But old folk still use an infusion of the herb for headaches.'</p>
<p><q><name type="ORG">'Then</name> in the name of the king, go and find some old man of less lore and more wisdom who keeps some in his house!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>.</p>
<p>Now <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> knelt beside <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name>, and held a hand upon his brow. And those that watched felt that some great struggle was going on. For <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>'s face grew grey with wea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ness; and ever and anon he called the name of <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name>, but each time more faintly to their hea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng, as if <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> himself was removed from them, and walked afar in some dark <name type="GPE">vale</name>, calling for <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> that was lost.</p>
<p>And at last <name type="PERSON">Bergil</name> came running in, and he bore <name type="CARDINAL">six</name> leaves in a cloth. <q><name type="DATE">'It</name> is kingsfoil, Sir,'</q> he said; <q>'but not fresh, I fear. It must have been culled <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> <name type="DATE">week</name>s ago at the least. I hope it will serve, Sir?'</q> Then looking at <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name> he burst into tears.</p>
<p>But <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> smiled. <q><name type="DATE">'It</name> will serve,'</q> he said. <q>'The worst is now over. Stay and be comforted!'</q> Then taking <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> leaves, he laid them on his hands and breathed on them, and then he crushed them, and straightway a living freshness filled the room, as if the air itself awoke and tingled, sparkling with joy. And then he cast the leaves into the bowls of steaming water that were brought to him, and at once all hearts were ligh<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed. For the fragrance that came to each was like a memory of dewy <name type="TIME">morning</name>s of unshadowed sun in some land of which the fair world in <name type="DATE">Sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng</name> is itself but a fleeting memory. But <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> stood up as <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> refreshed, and his eyes smiled as he held a bowl before <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name>'s dreaming face.</p>
<p><q>'Well now! Who would have believed it?'</q> said <name type="ORG">Ioreth</name> to a woman that stood beside her. <q>'The weed is better than I thought. It reminds me of the roses of <name type="ORG">Imloth Melui</name> when I was a lass, and no king could ask for better.'</q></p>
<p>Suddenly <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name> stirred, and he opened his eyes, and he looked on <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> who bent over him; and a light of knowledge and love was kindled in his eyes, and he spoke softly. <q><name type="CARDINAL">'My</name> lord, you called me. I come. What does the king command?'</q></p>
<p><q>'Walk no more in the shadows, but awake!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'You are weary. Rest a while, and take food, and be ready when I return.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I will, lord,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name>. <q>'For who would lie idle when the king has returned?'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Farewell</name> then for a while!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'I must go to others who need me.'</q> And he left the chamber with <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> and <name type="PERSON">Imrahil</name>; but <name type="PERSON">Beregond</name> and his son remained behind, unable to contain their joy. As he followed <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> and shut the door <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> heard <name type="ORG">Ioreth</name> exclaim:</p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g! Did you hear that? What did I say? The hands of a healer, I said.'</q> And soon the word had g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> out from the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>use that the king was indeed come among them, and after war he brought healing; and the news ran through the <name type="LOC">City</name>.</p>
<p>But <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> came to <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name>, and he said: <name type="CARDINAL">'He</name>re there is a g<name type="GPE">ri</name>evous hurt and a heavy blow. The arm that was broken has been <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ded with due skill, and it will mend in time, if she has the strength to live: It is the shield-arm that is maimed; but the chief evil comes through the sword-arm. In that there now seems no life, although it is unbroken.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Alas</name>! For she was pitted against a foe beyond the strength of her mind or body. And those who will take a weapon to such an enemy must be sterner than steel, if the very shock shall not destroy them. It was an evil doom that set her in his path. For she is a fair maiden, fairest lady of a house of queens. And yet I know not how I should speak of her. When I <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> looked on her and perceived her unhappiness, it seemed to me that I saw a white flower standing straight and proud, shapely as a lily, and yet knew that it was hard, as if wrought by elf-w<name type="GPE">ri</name>ghts out of steel. Or was it, maybe, a frost that had turned its sap to ice, and so it stood, bitter-sweet, still fair to see, but st<name type="GPE">ri</name>cken, soon to fall and die? Her malady begins far back before this <name type="DATE">day</name>, does it not, �omer?'</q></p>
<p><q>'I <name type="PERSON">mar</name>vel that you should ask me, lord,'</q> he answered. <q>'For I hold you blameless in this matter, as in all else; yet I knew not that <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name>, my sister, was touched by any frost, until she <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> looked on you. Care and dread she had, and shared with me, in the <name type="DATE">day</name>s of <name type="ORG">Worm</name>tongue and the king's bewitchment; and she <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ded the king in growing fear. But that did not b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng her to this pass!'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="CARDINAL">'My</name> f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, 'you had horses, and deeds of arms, and the free fields; but she, born in the body of a maid, had a spi<name type="GPE">ri</name>t and courage at least the match of yours. Yet she was doomed to wait upon an old man, whom she loved as a father, and watch him falling into a mean dishonoured dotage; and her part seemed to her more ignoble than that of the staff he leaned on.</p>
<p><q>'Think you that <name type="ORG">Worm</name>tongue had poison only for Th�oden's ears? _Dotard! What is the house of <name type="PERSON">Eorl</name> but a thatched barn where b<name type="GPE">ri</name>gands d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk in the <name type="GPE">reek</name>, and their brats roll on the floor among their dogs?_Have you not heard those words before? <name type="ORG">Saruman</name> spoke them, the teacher of <name type="ORG">Worm</name>tongue. Though I do not doubt that <name type="ORG">Worm</name>tongue at home wrapped their meaning in terms more cunning. My lord, if your sister's love for you, and her will still bent to her duty, had not restrained her lips; you might have heard even such things as these escape them. But who knows what she spoke to the darkness, al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, in the bitter watches of the <name type="TIME">night</name>, when all her life seemed sh<name type="GPE">ri</name>nking, and the walls of her bower closing in about her, a hutch to <name type="PERSON">trammel</name> some wild thing in?'</q></p>
<p>Then �omer was silent, and looked on his sister, as if ponde<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng anew <name type="DATE">all the <name type="DATE">day</name>s</name> of their past life together. But <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> said: 'I saw also what you saw, �omer. Few other g<name type="GPE">ri</name>efs amid the ill chances of this world have more bitterness and shame for a man's heart than to behold the love of a lady so fair and brave that cannot be returned Sorrow and pity have followed me ever since I left her desperate in <name type="PERSON">Dunharrow</name> and rode to <name type="WORK_OF_ART">the Paths of the Dead</name>; and no fear upon that way was so present as the fear for what might befall her. And yet, �omer, I say to you that she loves you more truly than me; for you she loves and knows; but in me she loves only a shadow and a thought: a hope of glory and great deeds, and lands far from the fields of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>.</p>
<p><q>'I have, maybe, the power to heal her body, and to recall her from <name type="LOC">the dark valley</name>. But to what she will awake: hope, or forgetfulness, or despair, I do not know. And if to despair, then she will die, unless other healing comes which I cannot b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng. <name type="PERSON">Alas</name>! for her deeds have set her among the queens of great renown.'</q></p>
<p>Then <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> stooped and looked in her face, and it was indeed white as a lily, cold as frost, and hard as g<name type="PERSON">raven</name> st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. But he bent and kissed her on the brow, and called her softly, saying:</p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">�owyn</name> �omund's daughter, awake! For your enemy has passed away!'</q></p>
<p>She did not stir, but now she began again to breathe deeply, so that her breast rose and fell beneath the white linen of the sheet. Once more <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> bruised <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> leaves of _athelas_ and cast them into steaming water; and he laved her brow with it, and her <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght arm lying cold and nerveless on the coverlet.</p>
<p>Then, whether <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> had indeed some forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> power of <name type="LOC">West</name>ernesse, or whether it was but his words of the <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name> that wrought on them, as the sweet influence of the herb stole about the chamber it seemed to those who stood by that a keen wind blew through the window, and it bore no scent, but was an air wholly fresh and clean and young, as if it had not before been breathed by any living thing and came new-made from <name type="LOC">snowy mountains</name> high beneath a dome of stars, or from shores of silver far away washed by seas of foam.</p>
<p><q>'Awake, <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name>, <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> again, and he took her <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght hand in his and felt it warm with life returning. <q>'Awake! The shadow is g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> and all darkness is washed clean!'</q> Then he laid her hand in �omer's and stepped away. <q>'Call her!'</q> he said, and he passed silently from the chamber.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">�owyn</name>, <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name>!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed �omer amid his tears. But she opened her eyes and said: <q>'�omer! What joy is this? For they said that you were slain. <name type="PERSON">Nay</name>, but that was only the dark voices in my dream. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w long have I been dreaming?'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'No</name>t long, my sister,'</q> said �omer. <q>'But think no more on it!'</q></p>
<p><q>' I am strangely weary,'</q> she said. <q>'I must rest a little. But tell me, what of the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd of the <name type="PERSON">Mark</name>? <name type="PERSON">Alas</name>! Do not tell me that that was a dream for I know that it was not. He is dead as he foresaw.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="CARDINAL">'He</name> is dead,'</q> said �omer, <q>'but he bade me say farewell to <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name> dearer than daughter. He lies now in great honour in the <name type="ORG">Citadel</name> of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q>'That is g<name type="GPE">ri</name>evous,'</q> she said. <q><name type="PERSON">'And</name> yet it is good beyond all that I dared hope in the dark <name type="DATE">day</name>s, when it seemed that the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>use of <name type="PERSON">Eorl</name> was sunk in honour less than any shepherd's cot. And what of the king's esquire, the <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>fling? �omer, you shall make him a k<name type="TIME">night</name> of the <name type="ORG">Ridder<name type="PERSON">mar</name>k</name>, for he is valiant!'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="CARDINAL">'He</name> lies nearby in this <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>use, and I will go to him,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'�omer shall stay here for a while. But do not speak yet of war or woe, until you are made whole again. Great gladness it is to see you wake again to health and hope, so valiant a lady!'</q></p>
<p><q>'To health?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name>. <q><name type="DATE">'It</name> may be so. At least while there is an empty saddle of some fallen <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name> that I can fill, and there are deeds to do. But to hope? I do not know.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> came to <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>'s room, and there they found <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> standing by the bed. <q><name type="ORG">'Poor</name> old <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>, and he ran to the bedside, for it seemed to him that his f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end looked worse, and a greyness was in his face, as if a w<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name> of <name type="DATE">year</name>s of sorrow lay on him; and suddenly a fear seized <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> that <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> would die.</p>
<p><q>'Do not be afraid,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'I came in time, and I have called him back. He is weary now, and g<name type="GPE">ri</name>eved, and he has taken a hurt like the <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name>, da<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng to smite that deadly thing. But these evils can be amended, so strong and gay a spi<name type="GPE">ri</name>t is in him. His g<name type="GPE">ri</name>ef he will not forget; but it will not darken his heart, it will teach him wisdom.'</q></p>
<p>Then <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> laid his hand on <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>'s head, and passing his hand gently through the brown curls, he touched the eyelids, and called him by name. And when the fragrance of _athelas_ stole through the room, like the scent of orchards, and of heather in the sunshine full of bees, suddenly <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> awoke, and he said:</p>
<p><q>'I am hungry. What is the time?'</q></p>
<p><q>'Past supper-time now,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>; <q>'though I daresay I could b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng you something, if they will let me.'</q></p>
<p><q>'They will indeed,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q><name type="PERSON">'And</name> anything else that this <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name> of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> may desire, if it can be found in Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name>, where his name is in honour.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="CARDINAL">'Go</name>od!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q><name type="ORG">'Then</name> I would like supper <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>, and after that a pipe.'</q> At that his face clouded. <q><name type="DATE">'No</name>, not a pipe. I don't think I'll smoke again.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Why not?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>.</p>
<p><q>'Well,'</q> answered <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> slowly. <q><name type="CARDINAL">'He</name> is dead. It has brought it all back to me. He said he was sorry he had never had a chance of talking herb-lore with me. Almost the last thing he ever said. I shan't ever be able to smoke again without thinking of him, and that <name type="DATE">day</name>, <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>, when he rode <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name> <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard and was so polite.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Smoke then, and think of him!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'For he was a gentle heart and a great king and kept his oaths; and he rose out of the shadows to a last fair <name type="TIME">morning</name>. Though your service to him was b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ef, it should be a memory glad and honourable to the end of your <name type="DATE">day</name>s.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Merry</name> smiled. <q>'Well then,'</q> he said, <q>'if <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> will provide what is needed, I will smoke and think. I had some of <name type="ORG">Saruman</name>'s best in my pack, but what became of it in the battle, I am sure I don't know.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Master <name type="PERSON">Me<name type="GPE">ri</name>adoc</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>, <q>'if you think that I have passed through the mountains and the realm of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> with fire and sword to b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng herbs to a careless soldier who throws away his gear, you are mistaken. If your pack has not been found, then you must send for the herb-master of this <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>use. And he will tell you that he did not know that the herb you desire had any virtues, but that it is called _westmansweed_ by the vulgar, and _galenas_ by the noble, and other names in other tongues more learned, and after adding <name type="CARDINAL">a few <name type="CARDINAL">half</name></name>-forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> rhymes that he does not understand, he will regretfully inform you that there is n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> in the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>use, and he will leave you to reflect on the history of tongues. And so now must I. For I have not slept in such a bed as this, since I rode from <name type="PERSON">Dunharrow</name>, nor ea<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> since the dark before <name type="TIME">dawn</name>.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Merry</name> seized his hand and kissed it. <q>'I am f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ghtfully sorry,'</q> he said. <q><name type="CARDINAL">'Go</name> at once! Ever since that <name type="TIME">night</name> at <name type="PERSON">Bree</name> we have been a nuisance to you. But it is the way of my people to use light words at such times and say less than they mean. We fear to say too much. It robs us of the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght words when a jest is out of place.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I know that well, or I would not deal with you in the same way ' said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. '<name type="DATE">May</name> the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> live for ever unwithered!'</q> And kissing <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> he went out, and <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> went with him.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> remained behind. <q>'Was there ever any <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> like him?'</q> he said. <q>'Except <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, of course. I think they must be related. My dear ass, your pack is lying by your bed, and you had it on your back when I met you. He saw it all the time, of course. And anyway I have some stuff of my own. <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Come</name> on now! <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ngbot<name type="PERSON">tom</name> Leaf it is. Fill up while I run and see about some food. And then let's be easy for a bit. Dear me! We <name type="PERSON">Took</name>s and <name type="ORG">Brand</name>ybucks, we can't live long on the h<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name>s.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'No</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'I can't. Not yet, at any rate. But at least, <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>, we can now see them, and honour them. It is best to love <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> what you are fitted to love, I suppose: you must start somewhere and have some roots, and the soil of the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> is deep. Still there are things deeper and higher; and not a gaffer could <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>d his garden in what he calls peace but for them, whether he knows about them or not. I am glad that I know about them, a little. But I don't know why I am talking like this. Where is that leaf? And get my pipe out of my pack, if it isn't broken.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> and <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> went now to the <name type="ORG">Warden</name> of the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>uses of Healing, and they counselled him that <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name> and <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name> should remain there and still be <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ded with care for many <name type="DATE">day</name>s.</p>
<p><q>'The <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>, <q>'will wish soon to <name type="GPE">ri</name>se and depart; but she should not be permitted to do so, if you can in any way restrain her, until <name type="DATE">at least <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> <name type="DATE">day</name>s</name> be passed.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'As</name> for <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, <q>'he must soon learn that his father is dead. But the full tale of the madness of <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name> should not be told to him, until he is quite healed and has duties to do. See that <name type="PERSON">Beregond</name> and the _<name type="NORP">pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>an</name>_ who were present do not speak to him of these things yet!'</q></p>
<p>And the other _<name type="NORP">pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>an</name>_ <name type="PERSON">Me<name type="GPE">ri</name>adoc</name> who is under my care, what of him?' said the <name type="ORG">Warden</name>.</p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'It</name> is likely that he will be fit to a<name type="GPE">ri</name>se to<name type="DATE">morrow</name>, for a short while,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'Let him do so, if he wishes. He may walk a little in the care of his f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends.'</q></p>
<p><q>'They are a re<name type="PERSON">mar</name>kable race,'</q> said the <name type="ORG">Warden</name>, nodding his head. <q>'Very tough in the fibre, I deem.'</q></p>
<p>At the doors of the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>uses many were already gathered to see <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>, and they followed after him; and when at last he had supped, men came and prayed that he would heal their kinsmen or their f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends whose lives were in pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>l through hurt or wound, or who lay under the <name type="ORG">Black</name> <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>. And <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> arose and went out, and he sent for the sons of <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name>, and together they laboured far into the <name type="TIME">night</name>. And word went through the <name type="LOC">City</name>: <q>'The <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g is come again indeed.'</q> And they named him <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name>st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, because of the green st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> that he wore, and so the name which it was foretold at his birth that he should bear was chosen for him by his own people.</p>
<p>And when he could labour no more, he cast his cloak about him, and slipped out of the <name type="LOC">City</name>, and went to his <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>t just ere <name type="TIME">dawn</name> and slept for a little. And in the <name type="TIME">morning</name> the banner of Dol <name type="PERSON">Amroth</name>, a white ship like a <name type="PERSON">s<name type="PERSON">wan</name></name> upon blue water, floated from the <name type="FAC">Tower</name>, and men looked up and wondered if the coming of the <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g had been but a dream.</p>

<p>The Last Debate</p>
<p><name type="TIME">The <name type="TIME">morning</name></name> came after the <name type="DATE">day</name> of battle, and it was fair with light clouds and the wind turning westward. <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> and <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> were early abroad, and they begged leave to go up into the <name type="LOC">City</name>; for they were eager to see <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>.</p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'It</name> is good to learn that they are still alive,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>; <q>'for they cost us great pains in our <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ch over <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>, and I would not have such pains all wasted.'</q></p>
<p>Together the <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name> and the <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Dwarf</name> entered Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name>, and folk that saw them pass <name type="PERSON">mar</name>velled to see such companions; for <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> was fair of face beyond the measure of <name type="ORG">Men</name>, and he sang an <name type="ORG">elven</name>-song in a clear voice as he walked in the <name type="TIME">morning</name>; but <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> stalked beside him, stroking his beard and sta<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng about him.</p>
<p><q>'There is some good st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>-work here,'</q> he said as he looked at the walls; <q>'but also some that is less good, and the streets could be better cont<name type="GPE">ri</name>ved. When <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> comes into his own, I shall offer him the service of st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>w<name type="GPE">ri</name>ghts of the <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>, and we will make this a town to be proud of.'</q></p>
<p><q>'They need more gardens,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. <q>'The houses are dead, and there is too little here that grows and is glad. If <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> comes into his own, the people of the <name type="PERSON">Wood</name> shall b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng him birds that sing and trees that do not die.'</q></p>
<p>At length they came to the P<name type="GPE">ri</name>nce <name type="PERSON">Imrahil</name>, and <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> looked at him and bowed low; for he saw that here indeed was <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> who had <name type="ORG">elven</name>-blood in his veins. <q><name type="PERSON">'Hail</name>, lord!'</q> he said. <q><name type="DATE">'It</name> is long since the people of <name type="PERSON">Nimrodel</name> left the woodlands of L�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en, and yet still <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> may see that not all sailed from <name type="PERSON">Amroth</name>'s haven west over water.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="CARDINAL">'So</name> it is said in the lore of my land,'</q> said the P<name type="GPE">ri</name>nce; <q>'yet never has <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the fair folk been seen there for <name type="DATE">year</name>s beyond count. And I <name type="PERSON">mar</name>vel to see <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> here now in the midst of sorrow and war. What do you seek?'</q></p>
<p><q>'I am <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the <name type="CARDINAL">Nine</name> <name type="ORG">Companions</name> who set out with <name type="LOC">Mithrandir</name> from <name type="GPE">Imlad<name type="GPE">ri</name>s</name>, said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> and with this <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Dwarf</name>, my f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end, I came with the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. But now we wish to see our f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends. <name type="PERSON">Me<name type="GPE">ri</name>adoc</name> and <name type="PERSON">Pereg<name type="GPE">ri</name>n</name>, who are in your keeping, we are told.'</q></p>
<p><q>'You will find them in the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>uses of Healing, and I will lead you thither,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Imrahil</name>.</p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'It</name> will be enough if you send <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> to guide us, lord,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. <q>'For <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> sends this message to you. He does not wish to enter the <name type="LOC">City</name> again at this time. Yet there is need for the captains to hold council at once, and he prays that you and �omer of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> will come down to his <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ts, as soon as may be. <name type="LOC">Mithrandir</name> is already there.'</q></p>
<p><q>'We will come,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Imrahil</name>; and they parted with courteous words.</p>
<p><q>'That is a fair lord and a great captain of men,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. <q>'If <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> has such men still in these <name type="DATE">day</name>s of fading, great must have been its glory in the <name type="DATE">day</name>s of its <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="PERSON">'And</name> doubtless the good st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>-work is the older and was wrought in the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> building,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. <q><name type="DATE">'It</name> is ever so with the things that <name type="ORG">Men</name> begin: there is a frost in <name type="DATE">Sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng</name>, or a blight in <name type="EVENT">Summer</name>, and they fail of their promise.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'Yet</name> seldom do they fail of their seed,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. <q><name type="PERSON">'And</name> that will lie in the dust and rot to sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng up again in times and places unlooked-for. The deeds of <name type="ORG">Men</name> will outlast us, <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="PERSON">'And</name> yet come to naught in the end but might-have-beens, I guess,'</q> said the <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Dwarf</name>.</p>
<p><q>'To that the <name type="ORG">Elves</name> know not the answer,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>.</p>
<p>With that the servant of the P<name type="GPE">ri</name>nce came and led them to the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>uses of Healing; and there they found their f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends in the garden, and their meeting was a merry <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. For a while they walked and talked, rejoicing for a b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ef space in peace and rest under the <name type="TIME">morning</name> high up in the windy circles of the <name type="LOC">City</name>. Then when <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> became weary, they went and sat upon the wall with the greensward of the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>uses of Healing behind them; and away southward before them was the <name type="GPE">Anduin</name> glitte<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng in the sun, as it flowed away, out of the sight even of <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>, into the wide flats and green haze of <name type="ORG">Lebennin</name> and <name type="LOC">South</name> <name type="ORG">Ithil</name>ien.</p>
<p>And now <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> fell silent, while the others talked, and he looked out against the sun, and as he gazed he saw white sea-birds beating up the <name type="LOC">River</name>.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok!'</q> he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed. <q>'Gulls! They are flying far inland. A wonder they are to me and a trouble to my heart. Never in all my life had I met them, until we came to <name type="NORP">Pelargir</name>, and there I heard them crying in the air as we rode to the battle of the ships. Then I stood still, forgetting war in <name type="LOC">Middle-<name type="LOC">earth</name></name>; for their wailing voices spoke to me of the <name type="LOC">Sea</name>. The <name type="LOC">Sea</name>! <name type="PERSON">Alas</name>! I have not yet beheld it. But deep in the hearts of all my kindred lies the sea-longing, which it is pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>lous to stir. <name type="PERSON">Alas</name>! for the gulls. No peace shall I have again under beech or under elm.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Say not so!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. <q>'There are countless things still to see in <name type="LOC">Middle-<name type="LOC">earth</name></name>, and great works to do. But if all the fair folk take to the <name type="GPE">Haven</name>s, it will be a duller world for those who are doomed to stay.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Dull and dreary indeed!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>: <q>'You must not go to the <name type="GPE">Haven</name>s, <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. There will always be some folk, big or little, and even a few wise dwarves like <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>, who need you. At least I hope so. Though I feel somehow that the worst of this war is still to come. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w I wish it was all over, and well over!'</q></p>
<p><q>'Don't be so gloomy!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q>'The <name type="ORG">Sun</name> is shining, and here we are together for <name type="DATE">a <name type="DATE">day</name></name> or <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> at least. I <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t to hear more about you all. <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Come</name>, <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>! You and <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> have menti<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>d your strange journey with <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> about <name type="CARDINAL">a <name type="CARDINAL">dozen</name></name> times already this <name type="TIME">morning</name>. But you haven't told me anything about it.'</q></p>
<p><q>'The <name type="ORG">Sun</name> may shine here,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>, <q>'but there are memo<name type="GPE">ri</name>es of that road that I do not wish to recall out of the darkness. Had I known what was before me, I think that not for any f<name type="GPE">ri</name>endship would I have taken <name type="WORK_OF_ART">the Paths of the Dead</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="WORK_OF_ART">The Paths of the Dead</name>?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q>'I heard <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> say that and I wondered what he could mean. Won't you tell us some more?'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'No</name>t willingly,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. <q>'For upon that road I was put to shame: <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> <name type="PRODUCT">Gl�</name>in's son, who had deemed himself more tough than <name type="ORG">Men</name>, and hardier under <name type="LOC">earth</name> than any <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name>. But neither did I prove; and I was held to the road only by the will of <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="PERSON">'And</name> by the love of him also,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. <q>'For all those who come to know him come to love him after his own fashion, even the cold maiden of the Rohir<name type="GPE">ri</name>m. It was at early morn of the <name type="DATE">day</name> ere you came there, <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>, that we left <name type="PERSON">Dunharrow</name>, and such a fear was on all the folk that n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> would look on our going, save the <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name>, who lies now hurt in the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>use below. There was g<name type="GPE">ri</name>ef at that parting, and I was g<name type="GPE">ri</name>eved to behold it.'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Alas</name>! I had heart only for myself,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Nay</name>! I will not speak of that journey.'</q></p>
<p>He fell silent; but <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> and <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> were so eager for news that at last <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> said: <q>'I will tell you enough for your peace; for I felt not the horror, and I feared not the shadows of <name type="ORG">Men</name>, powerless and frail as I deemed them.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Swift</name>ly then he told of the haunted road under the mountains, and the dark tryst at <name type="PRODUCT">Erech</name>, and the great <name type="GPE">ri</name>de thence, <name type="CARDINAL">nine</name>ty leagues and <name type="CARDINAL">three</name>, to <name type="NORP">Pelargir</name> on <name type="GPE">Anduin</name>. <q>'<name type="CARDINAL">Four</name> <name type="DATE">day</name>s and <name type="TIME">night</name>s, and on into a <name type="ORDINAL">fifth</name>, we rode from the <name type="ORG">Black</name> <name type="ORG">St<name type="CARDINAL">one</name></name>,'</q> he said. <name type="PERSON">'And</name> lo! in the darkness of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> my hope rose; for in that gloom the <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name> <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>st seemed to grow stronger and more ter<name type="GPE">ri</name>ble to look upon. Some I saw <name type="GPE">ri</name>ding, some st<name type="GPE">ri</name>ding, yet all moving with the same great speed. Silent they were, but there was a gleam in their eyes. In the uplands of <name type="ORG">Lamedon</name> they overtook our horses, and swept round us, and would have passed us by, if <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> had not forbidden them.</p>
<p><name type="CARDINAL">'At</name> his command they fell back. "Even the shades of <name type="ORG">Men</name> are obedient to his will," I thought. "They may serve his needs yet! "</p>
<p><name type="CARDINAL">'<name type="CARDINAL">One</name></name> <name type="DATE">day</name> of light we rode, and then came the <name type="DATE">day</name> without <name type="TIME">dawn</name>, and still we rode on, and <name type="PERSON">Ci<name type="GPE">ri</name>l</name> and <name type="ORG">Ring</name>l� we crossed; and on the <name type="ORDINAL">third</name> <name type="DATE">day</name> we came to <name type="LOC">Linhir</name> above the mouth of <name type="PERSON">Gilrain</name>. And there men of <name type="ORG">Lamedon</name> contested the <name type="ORG">ford</name>s with fell folk of <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Umbar</name> and <name type="ORG">Harad</name> who had sailed up the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver. But de<name type="PERSON">fen</name>ders and foes alike gave up the battle and fled when we came, crying out that the <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g of the Dead was upon them. Only <name type="ORG">Angbor</name>, <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd of <name type="ORG">Lamedon</name>, had the heart to abide us; and <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> bade him gather his folk and come behind, if they dared, when the <name type="ORG">Grey</name> <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>st had passed.</p>
<p>' "At <name type="NORP">Pelargir</name> the Heir of <name type="ORG">Isildur</name> will have need of you," he said.</p>
<p><q>'Thus we crossed over <name type="PERSON">Gilrain</name>, d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ving the allies of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> in rout before us; and then we rested a while. But soon <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> arose, saying: "<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>! already Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name> is assailed. I fear that it will fall ere we come to its aid." So we mounted again <name type="TIME">before <name type="TIME">night</name></name> had passed and went on with all the speed that our horses could endure over the plains of <name type="ORG">Lebennin</name>.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> paused and sighed, and turning his eyes southward softly he sang:</p>
<p>_Silver flow the streams from <name type="ORG">Celos</name> to Erui</p>
<p>In the green fields of <name type="ORG">Lebennin</name>!</p>
<p>Tall grows the grass there. In the wind from the <name type="LOC">Sea</name></p>
<p>The white lilies sway,</p>
<p>And the golden bells are shaken of <name type="PERSON">mallos</name> and alfi<name type="GPE">ri</name>n</p>
<p>In the green fields of <name type="ORG">Lebennin</name>,</p>
<p>In the wind from the <name type="LOC">Sea</name>!_</p>
<p>'<name type="ORG">Green</name> are those fields in the songs of my people; but they were dark then, grey wastes in the blackness before us. And over the wide land, trampling unheeded the grass and the flowers, we hunted our foes through <name type="DATE">a <name type="DATE">day</name></name> and <name type="TIME">a <name type="TIME">night</name></name>, until we came at the bitter end to the <name type="LOC">Great <name type="LOC">River</name></name> at <name type="DATE">last.</name></p>
<p><q><name type="ORG">'Then</name> I thought in my heart that we drew near to the <name type="LOC">Sea</name>; for wide was the water in the darkness, and sea-birds innumerable c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed on its, shores. <name type="PERSON">Alas</name> for the wailing of the gulls! Did not the <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> tell me to beware of them? And now I cannot forget them.'</q></p>
<p><q>'For my part I heeded them not,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>; 'for we came then at last upon battle in earnest. There at <name type="NORP">Pelargir</name> lay the main fleet of <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Umbar</name>, <name type="CARDINAL">fifty</name> great ships and smaller vessels beyond count. Many of those that we pursued had reached the havens before us, and brought their fear with them; and some of the ships had put off, seeking to escape down the <name type="LOC">River</name> or to reach the far shore; and many of the smaller craft were ablaze. But the <name type="ORG">Harad</name><name type="GPE">ri</name>m, being now d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ven to the b<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk, turned at bay, and they were fierce in despair; and they laughed when they looked on us, for they were a great army still.</p>
<p>'But <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> halted and c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed with a great voice: "Now come! By the <name type="ORG">Black</name> <name type="ORG">St<name type="CARDINAL">one</name></name> I call you! " And suddenly the <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name> <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>st that had hung back at the last came up like a grey tide, sweeping all away before it. Faint c<name type="GPE">ri</name>es I heard, and dim horns blowing, and a murmur as of countless far voices: it was like the echo of some forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> battle in the <name type="EVENT">Dark Years</name> <name type="DATE">long ago</name>. Pale swords were drawn; but I know not whether their blades would still bite, for the Dead needed no longer any weapon but fear. N<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> would withstand them.</p>
<p>'To every ship they came that was drawn up, and then they passed over the water to those that were anchored; and all the <name type="PERSON">mar</name>iners were filled with a madness of terror and leaped overboard, save the slaves c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>ned to the oars. Reckless we rode among our fleeing foes, d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ving them like leaves, until we came to the shore. And then to each of the great ships that remained <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> sent <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the D�nedain, and they comforted the captives that were aboard, and bade them put aside fear and be free.</p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'Ere</name> that dark <name type="DATE">day</name> ended n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the enemy were left to resist us all were drowned, or were flying south in the hope to find their own lands upon foot. Strange and wonderful I thought it that the designs of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> should be overthrown by such wraiths of fear and darkness. With its own weapons was it worsted!'</q></p>
<p><q>'Strange indeed,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. <q>'In that <name type="TIME">hour</name> I looked on <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> and thought how great and ter<name type="GPE">ri</name>ble a <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd he might have become in the strength of his will, had he taken the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> to himself. Not for naught does <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> fear him. But nobler is his spi<name type="GPE">ri</name>t than the understanding of <name type="ORG">Sauron</name>; for is he not of the children of L�thien? Never shall that line fail, though <name type="DATE">the <name type="DATE">year</name></name>s may lengthen beyond count.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Beyond the eyes of the <name type="ORG">Dwarves</name> are such foretellings,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. 'But mighty indeed was <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> that <name type="DATE">day</name>. <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>! all the black fleet was in his hands; and he chose the greatest ship to be his own, and he went up into it. Then he let sound a great concourse of trumpets taken from the enemy; and the <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name> <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>st withdrew to the shore. There they stood silent, hardly to be seen, save for a red gleam in their eyes that caught the glare of the ships that were burning. And <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> spoke in a loud voice to the <name type="ORG">Dead <name type="ORG">Men</name></name>, crying:</p>
<p>' "<name type="WORK_OF_ART">Hear now the words of the Heir of <name type="ORG">Isildur</name></name>! Your oath is fulfilled. Go back and trouble not the valleys ever again! Depart and be at rest! "</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">'And</name> thereupon the <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g of the Dead stood out before the host and broke his spear and cast it down. Then he bowed low and turned away; and swiftly the whole grey host drew off and vanished like a mist that is d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ven back by a sudden wind; and it seemed to me that I awoke from a dream.</p>
<p>'<name type="TIME">That <name type="TIME">night</name></name> we rested while others laboured. For there were many captives set free, and many slaves released who had been folk of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> taken in raids; and soon also there was a great gathe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng of men out of <name type="ORG">Lebennin</name> and the <name type="ORG">Ethir</name>, and <name type="ORG">Angbor</name> of <name type="ORG">Lamedon</name> came up with all the horsemen that he could muster. Now that the fear of the Dead was removed they came to aid us and to look on the Heir of <name type="ORG">Isildur</name>; for the rumour of that name had run like fire in the dark.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">'And</name> that is near the end of our tale. For du<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng that <name type="TIME">evening</name> and <name type="TIME">night</name> many ships were made ready and manned; and in the <name type="TIME">morning</name> the fleet set forth. <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ng past it now seems, yet it was but the morn of the <name type="DATE">day</name> ere yester<name type="DATE">day</name>, the <name type="CARDINAL">six</name>th since we rode from <name type="PERSON">Dunharrow</name>. But still <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> was d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ven by fear that time was too short.</p>
<p>' "It is <name type="CARDINAL">forty</name> leagues and <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> from <name type="NORP">Pelargir</name> to the landings at the <name type="PERSON">Harlond</name>," he said. "Yet to the <name type="PERSON">Harlond</name> we must come to<name type="DATE">morrow</name> or fail utterly."</p>
<p>'The oars were now wielded by free men, and manfully they laboured; yet slowly we passed up the <name type="LOC">Great <name type="LOC">River</name></name>, for we strove against its stream, and though that is not swift down in the <name type="LOC">South</name>, we had no help of wind. Heavy would my heart have been, for all our victory at the havens, if <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> had not laughed suddenly.</p>
<p>' "Up with your beard, <name type="DATE">Du<name type="GPE">ri</name>n's</name> son! " he said. "For thus is it spoken: _Oft hope is born, when all is forlorn_." But what hope he saw from afar he would not tell. When <name type="TIME">night</name> came it did but deepen the darkness, and our hearts were hot, for away in the <name type="LOC">North</name> we saw a red glow under the cloud, and <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> said: "Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name> is burning."</p>
<p><q>'But at <name type="TIME">mid<name type="TIME">night</name></name> hope was indeed born anew. <name type="LOC">Sea</name>-crafty men of the <name type="ORG">Ethir</name> gazing southward spoke of a change coming with a fresh wind from the <name type="LOC">Sea</name>. <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ng ere <name type="DATE">day</name> the masted ships hoisted sail; and our speed grew, until <name type="TIME">dawn</name> whi<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed the foam at our prows. And so it was, as you know, that we came in the <name type="ORDINAL">third</name> <name type="TIME">hour</name> of the <name type="TIME">morning</name> with a fair wind and the <name type="ORG">Sun</name> unveiled, and we unfurled the great standard in battle. It was a great <name type="DATE">day</name> and <name type="TIME">a great <name type="TIME">hour</name></name>, whatever may come after.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Follow what may, great deeds are not lessened in worth,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. <q>'Great deed was the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ding of <name type="WORK_OF_ART">the Paths of the Dead</name>, and great it shall remain, though n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> be left in <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> to sing of it in the <name type="DATE">day</name>s that are to come.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="PERSON">'And</name> that may well befall,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. <q>'For the faces of <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> and <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> are grave. Much I wonder what counsels they are taking in the <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ts there below. For my part, like <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>, I wish that with our victory the war was now over. Yet whatever is still to do, I hope to have a part in it, for the honour of the folk of the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>nely <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="PERSON">'And</name> I for the folk of the Great <name type="PERSON">Wood</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>, <q>'and for the love of the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd of the White <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>.'</q></p>
<p>Then the companions fell silent, but a while they sat there in the high place, each busy with his own thoughts, while the Captains debated.</p>
<p>When the P<name type="GPE">ri</name>nce <name type="PERSON">Imrahil</name> had parted from <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> and <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>, at once he sent for �omer; and he went down with him from the <name type="LOC">City</name>, and they came to the <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ts of <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> that were set up on the field not far from the place where <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g Th�oden had fallen. And there they took counsel together with <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> and <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> and the sons of <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name>.</p>
<p><q><name type="CARDINAL">'My</name> lords,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, 'lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> to the words of the <name type="ORG">Steward</name> of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> before he died: _You may t<name type="GPE">ri</name>umph on the fields of the <name type="ORG">Pelennor</name> for <name type="DATE">a <name type="DATE">day</name></name>, but against the <name type="ORG">Power</name> that has now a<name type="GPE">ri</name>sen there is no victory_. I do not bid you despair, as he did, but to ponder the truth in these words.</p>
<p>'The <name type="ORG">St<name type="CARDINAL">one</name></name>s of Seeing do not lie, and not even the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd of <name type="FAC">Barad-d</name>�r can make them do so. He can, maybe, by his will choose what things shall be seen by weaker minds, or cause them to mistake the meaning of what they see. N<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>theless it cannot be doubted that when <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name> saw great forces arrayed against him in <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>, and more still being gathered, he saw that which truly is.</p>
<p><q>'Hardly has our strength sufficed to beat off the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> great assault. The next will be greater. This war then is without final hope, as <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name> perceived. Victory cannot be achieved by arms, whether you sit here to endure siege after siege, or <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ch out to be overwhelmed beyond the <name type="LOC">River</name>. You have only a choice of evils; and prudence would counsel you to strengthen such strong places as you have, and there await the onset; for so shall the time before your end be made a little longer.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="ORG">'Then</name> you would have us retreat to Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name>, or Dol <name type="PERSON">Amroth</name>, or to <name type="PERSON">Dunharrow</name>, and there sit like children on sand-castles when the tide is flowing?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Imrahil</name>.</p>
<p><q>'That would be no new counsel,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. 'Have you not d<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> this and little more in <name type="DATE">all the <name type="DATE">day</name>s</name> of <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name>? But no! I said this would be prudent. I do not counsel prudence. I said victory could not be achieved by arms. I still hope for victory, but not by arms. For into the midst of all these policies comes the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> of <name type="ORG">Power</name>, the foundation of <name type="FAC">Barad-d</name>�r, and the hope of <name type="ORG">Sauron</name>.</p>
<p>'Concerning this thing, my lords, you now all know enough for the understanding of our plight, and of <name type="ORG">Sauron</name>'s. If he regains it, your valour is vain, and his victory will be swift and complete: so complete that n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> can foresee the end of it while this world lasts. If it is destroyed, then he will fall; and his fall will be so low that n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> can foresee his a<name type="GPE">ri</name>sing ever again. For he will lose the best part of the strength that was native to him in his beginning, and all that was made or begun with that power will crumble, and he will be maimed for ever, becoming a mere spi<name type="GPE">ri</name>t of malice that gnaws itself in the shadows, but cannot again grow or take shape. And so a great evil of this world will be removed.</p>
<p>'Other evils there are that may come; for <name type="ORG">Sauron</name> is himself but a servant or emissary. Yet it is not our part to master all the tides of the world, but to do what is in us for the succour of <name type="DATE">those <name type="DATE">year</name>s</name> wherein we are set, uprooting the evil in the fields that we know, so that those who live after may have clean <name type="LOC">earth</name> to till. What weather they shall have is not ours to rule.</p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'No</name>w <name type="ORG">Sauron</name> knows all this, and he knows that this precious thing which he lost has been found again; but he does not yet know where it is, or so we hope. And therefore he is now in great doubt. For if we have found this thing, there are some among us with strength enough to wield it. That too he knows. For do I not guess <name type="GPE">ri</name>ghtly, <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>, that you have shown yourself to him in the <name type="ORG">St<name type="CARDINAL">one</name></name> of <name type="PERSON">Orthanc</name>?'</q></p>
<p><q>'I did so ere I rode from the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>rn<name type="GPE">burg</name>,'</q> answered <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'I deemed that the time was <name type="GPE">ri</name>pe, and that the <name type="ORG">St<name type="CARDINAL">one</name></name> had come to me for just such a purpose. It was then <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> <name type="DATE">day</name>s since the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>-bearer went east from <name type="PERSON">Rauros</name>, and the <name type="PRODUCT">Eye</name> of <name type="ORG">Sauron</name>, I thought, should be drawn out from his own land. Too seldom has he been challenged since he returned to his <name type="FAC">Tower</name>. Though if I had foreseen how swift would be his onset in answer, maybe I should not have dared to show myself. Bare time was given me to come to your aid.'</q></p>
<p><q>'But how is this?'</q> asked �omer. <q><name type="PERSON">'All</name> is vain, you say, if he has the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>. Why should he think it not vain to assail us, if we have it?'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="CARDINAL">'He</name> is not yet sure,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, 'and he has not built up his power by waiting until his enemies are <name type="ORG">sec</name>ure, as we have d<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. Also we could not learn how to wield the full power all in <name type="DATE">a <name type="DATE">day</name></name>. Indeed it can be used only by <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> master al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, not by many; and he will look for a time of st<name type="GPE">ri</name>fe, ere <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the great among us makes himself master and puts down the others. In that time the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> might aid him, if he were sudden.</p>
<p><name type="CARDINAL">'He</name> is wat<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g. He sees much and hears much. His Nazg�l are still abroad. They passed over this field ere the sun<name type="GPE">ri</name>se, though few of the weary and sleeping were aware of them. He studies the signs: the <name type="PRODUCT">Sword</name> that robbed him of his treasure re-made; the winds of fortune turning in our favour, and the defeat unlooked-for of his <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> assault <name type="DATE">the fall</name> of his great Captain.</p>
<p>'His doubt will be growing, even as we speak here. His <name type="PRODUCT">Eye</name> is now straining towards us, blind almost to all else that is moving. So we must keep it. Therein lies all our hope. This, then, is my counsel. We have not the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>. In wisdom or great folly it has been sent away to be destroyed, lest it destroy us. Without it we cannot by force defeat his force. But we must at all costs keep his <name type="PRODUCT">Eye</name> from his true pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>l. We cannot achieve victory by arms, but by arms we can give the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>-bearer his only chance, frail though it be.</p>
<p><name type="DATE">'As</name> <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> has begun, so we must go on. We must push <name type="ORG">Sauron</name> to his last throw. We must call out his hidden strength, so that he shall empty his land. We must <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ch out to meet him at once. We must make ourselves the bait, though his jaws should close on us. He will take that bait, in hope and in greed, for he will think that in such rashness he sees the p<name type="GPE">ri</name>de of the new <name type="ORG">Ring</name>lord: and he will say: "So! he pushes out his neck too soon and too far. Let him come on, and behold I will have him in a trap from which he cannot escape. There I will crush him, and what he has taken in his insolence shall be mine again for ever."</p>
<p><q>'We must walk open-eyed into that trap, with courage, but small hope for ourselves. For, my lords, it may well prove that we ourselves shall pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>sh utterly in a black battle far from the living lands; so that even if <name type="FAC">Barad-d</name>�r be thrown down, we shall not live to see a new age. But this, I deem, is our duty. And better so than to pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>sh n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>theless � as we surely shall, if we sit here � and know as we die that no new age shall be.'</q></p>
<p>They were silent for a while. At length <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> spoke. <q><name type="DATE">'As</name> I have begun, so I will go on. We come now to the very b<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk, where hope and despair are akin. To waver is to fall. Let n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> now reject the counsels of <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, whose long labours against <name type="ORG">Sauron</name> come at last to their test. But for him all would <name type="DATE">long ago</name> have been lost. N<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>theless I do not yet claim to command any man. Let others choose as they will.'</q></p>
<p>Then said <name type="ORG">Elrohir</name>: <q>'From the <name type="LOC">North</name> we came with this purpose, and from <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name> our father we brought this very counsel. We will not turn back.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'As</name> for myself,'</q> said �omer, <q>'I have little knowledge of these deep matters; but I need it not. This I know, and it is enough, that as my f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> succoured me and my people, so I will aid him when he calls. I will go.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'As</name> for me,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Imrahil</name>, <q>'the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> I hold to be my liege-lord, whether he claim it or no. His wish is to me a command. I will go also. Yet for a while I stand in the place of the <name type="ORG">Steward</name> of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>, and it is mine to think <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> of its people. To prudence some heed must still be given. For we must prepare against all chances, good as well as evil. Now, it may be that we shall t<name type="GPE">ri</name>umph, and while there is any hope of this, <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> must be protected. I would not have us return with victory to a <name type="LOC">City</name> in ruins and a land ravaged behind us. And yet we learn from the Rohir<name type="GPE">ri</name>m that there is an army still unfought upon our northern flank.'</q></p>
<p><q>'That is true,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'I do not counsel you to leave the <name type="LOC">City</name> all unmanned. Indeed the force that we lead east need not be great enough for any assault in earnest upon <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>, so long as it be great enough to challenge battle. And it must move soon. Therefore I ask the Captains: what force could we muster and lead out in <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> <name type="DATE">day</name>s' time at the latest? And they must be hardy men that go willingly, knowing their pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>l.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="PERSON">'All</name> are weary, and very many have wounds light or g<name type="GPE">ri</name>evous,'</q> said �omer, <q>'and we have suffered much loss of our horses, and that is ill to bear. If we must <name type="GPE">ri</name>de soon, then I cannot hope to lead even <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> <name type="CARDINAL">thousands</name>, and yet leave as many for the de<name type="PERSON">fen</name>ce of the <name type="LOC">City</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q>'We have not only to reckon with those who fought on this field ' said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. 'New strength is on the way from the southern fiefs, now that the coasts have been <name type="GPE">ri</name>d. <name type="CARDINAL">Four</name> <name type="CARDINAL">thousands</name> I sent <name type="PERSON">mar</name><name type="PERSON">chin</name>g from <name type="NORP">Pelargir</name> through <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ssarnach <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> <name type="DATE">day</name>s ago; and <name type="ORG">Angbor</name> the fearless <name type="GPE">ri</name>des before them. If we set out in <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> <name type="DATE">day</name>s more, they will draw nigh ere we depart. Moreover many were bidden to follow me up the <name type="LOC">River</name> in any craft they could gather; and with this wind they will soon be at hand, indeed several ships have already come to the <name type="PERSON">Harlond</name>. I judge that we could lead out <name type="CARDINAL">seven</name> <name type="CARDINAL">thousands</name> of horse and foot, and yet leave the <name type="LOC">City</name> in better de<name type="PERSON">fen</name>ce than it was when the assault began.'</q></p>
<p><q>'The <name type="FAC">Gate</name> is destroyed,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Imrahil</name>, <q>'and where now is the skill to rebuild it and set it up anew?'</q></p>
<p><q>'In <name type="ORG">Erebor</name> in the <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>gdom of D�in there is such skill,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>; <q>'and if all our hopes do not pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>sh, then in time I will send <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> <name type="PRODUCT">Gl�</name>in's son to ask for w<name type="GPE">ri</name>ghts of the <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>. But men are better than gates, and no gate will endure against our Enemy if men desert it.'</q></p>
<p>This then was the end of the debate of the lords: that they should set forth on the <name type="ORG">sec</name>ond <name type="TIME">morning</name> from that <name type="DATE">day</name> with <name type="CARDINAL">seven</name> <name type="CARDINAL">thousands</name>, if these might be found; and the great part of this force should be on foot, because of the evil lands into which they would go. <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> should find <name type="CARDINAL">some <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> <name type="CARDINAL">thousands</name></name> of those that he had gathered to him in the <name type="LOC">South</name>; but <name type="PERSON">Imrahil</name> should find <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> and a <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> <name type="CARDINAL">thousands</name>; and �omer <name type="CARDINAL">five</name> <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name>s of the Rohir<name type="GPE">ri</name>m who were unhorsed but themselves warworthy, and he himself should lead <name type="CARDINAL">five</name> <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name>s of his best <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s on horse; and another company of <name type="CARDINAL">five</name> <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name> horse there should be, among which should <name type="GPE">ri</name>de the sons of <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name> with the D�nedain and the k<name type="TIME">night</name>s of Dol <name type="PERSON">Amroth</name>: all told <name type="CARDINAL">six</name> thousand foot and <name type="CARDINAL">a thousand</name> horse. But the main strength of the Rohir<name type="GPE">ri</name>m that remained horsed and able to fight, <name type="CARDINAL">some <name type="CARDINAL">three</name></name> thousand under the command of <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name>helm, should waylay the <name type="LOC">West</name> <name type="FAC">Road</name> against the enemy that was in <name type="PERSON">An�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en</name>. And at once swift <name type="GPE">ri</name>ders were sent out to gather what news they could northwards; and eastwards from <name type="NORP">Osgiliath</name> and the road to Minas <name type="PERSON">Morgul</name>.</p>
<p>And when they had reck<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>d up all their strength and taken thought for the journeys they should make and the roads they should choose, <name type="PERSON">Imrahil</name> suddenly laughed aloud.</p>
<p><q>'Surely,'</q> he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed, <q>'this is the greatest jest in all the history of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>: that we should <name type="GPE">ri</name>de with <name type="CARDINAL">seven</name> <name type="CARDINAL">thousands</name>, scarce as many as the vanguard of its army in the <name type="DATE">day</name>s of its power, to assail the mountains and the impenetrable gate of the <name type="ORG">Black</name> Land! So might a child threa<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> a mail-clad k<name type="TIME">night</name> with a bow of st<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng and green willow! If the Dark <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd knows so much as you say, <name type="LOC">Mithrandir</name>, will he not rather smile than fear, and with his little finger crush us like a fly that t<name type="GPE">ri</name>es to sting him?'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'No</name>, he will try to trap the fly and take the sting,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q><name type="PERSON">'And</name> there are names among us that are worth more than <name type="CARDINAL">a thousand</name> mail-clad k<name type="TIME">night</name>s apiece. No, he will not smile.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Neither shall we,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'If this be jest, then it is too bitter for laughter. <name type="PERSON">Nay</name>, it is the last move in a great jeopardy, and for <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> side or the other it will b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng the end of the game.'</q> Then he drew And�<name type="GPE">ri</name>l and held it up glitte<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng in the sun. <q>'You shall not be sheathed again until the last battle is fought;'</q> he said.</p>
</chapter><chapter num="10"><heading>Chapter 10</heading>
<p>The <name type="ORG">Black</name> <name type="FAC">Gate</name> Opens</p>
<p><name type="CARDINAL">Two</name> <name type="DATE">day</name>s later the army of the <name type="LOC">West</name> was all assembled on the <name type="ORG">Pelennor</name>. The host of <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s and <name type="LOC">East</name>erlings had turned back out of <name type="PERSON">An�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en</name>, but har<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed and scattered by the Rohir<name type="GPE">ri</name>m they had broken and fled with little fighting towards Cair <name type="PERSON">Andros</name>; and with that threat destroyed and new strength ar<name type="GPE">ri</name>ving out of the <name type="LOC">South</name> the <name type="LOC">City</name> was as well manned as might be. Scouts reported that no enemies remained upon the roads east as far as the <name type="ORG">Cross</name>-roads of the Fallen <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g. All now was ready for the last throw.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> and <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> were to <name type="GPE">ri</name>de again together in the company of <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> and <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, who went in the van with the D�nedain and the sons of <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name>. But <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> to his shame was not to go with them.</p>
<p><q>'You are not fit for such a journey,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'But do not be ashamed. If you do no more in this war, you have already earned great honour. <name type="PERSON">Pereg<name type="GPE">ri</name>n</name> shall go and represent the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>folk; and do not grudge him his chance of pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>l, for though he has d<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> as well as his fortune allowed him, he has yet to match your deed. But in truth all now are in like danger. Though it may be our part to find bitter end before the <name type="FAC">Gate</name> of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>, if we do so, then you will come also to a last stand, either here or wherever the black tide overtakes you. <name type="PERSON">Farewell</name>!'</q></p>
<p>And so despondently <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> now stood and watched the muste<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng of the army. <name type="PERSON">Bergil</name> was with him, and he also was downcast; for his father was to <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ch leading a company of the <name type="ORG">Men</name> of the <name type="LOC">City</name>: he could not rejoin the <name type="ORG">Guard</name> until his case was judged. In that same company <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> was also to go, as a soldier of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>. <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> could see him not far off, a small but up<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght figure among the tall men of Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name>.</p>
<p>At last the trumpets rang and the army began to move. Troop by troop, and company by company, they wheeled and went off eastward. And long after they had passed away out of sight down the great road to the <name type="FAC">Causeway</name>, <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> stood there. The last glint of the <name type="TIME">morning</name> sun on spear and helm twinkled and was lost, and still he remained with bowed head and heavy heart, feeling f<name type="GPE">ri</name>endless and al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. Every<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> that he cared for had g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> away into the gloom that hung over the distant eastern sky; and little hope at all was left in his heart that he would ever see any of them again.</p>
<p>As if recalled by his mood of despair, the pain in his arm returned, and he felt weak and old, and the sunlight seemed thin. He was roused by the touch of <name type="PERSON">Bergil</name>'s hand.</p>
<p><q><name type="WORK_OF_ART">'<name type="WORK_OF_ART">Come</name></name>, Master <name type="PERSON">Pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>an</name>!'</q> said the lad. <q>'You are still in pain, I see. I will help you back to the <name type="ORG">Healers</name>. But do not fear! They will come back. The <name type="ORG">Men</name> of Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name> will never be overcome. And now they have the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name>st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, and <name type="PERSON">Beregond</name> of the <name type="ORG">Guard</name> too.'</q></p>
<p>Ere <name type="TIME">noon</name> the army came to <name type="NORP">Osgiliath</name>. There all the workers and craftsmen that could be spared were busy. Some were strengthening the fer<name type="GPE">ri</name>es and boat-b<name type="GPE">ri</name>dges that the enemy had made and in part destroyed when they fled; some gathered stores and booty; and others on the eastern side across the <name type="LOC">River</name> were throwing up hasty works of de<name type="PERSON">fen</name>ce.</p>
<p>The vanguard passed on through the ruins of Old <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>, and over the wide <name type="LOC">River</name>, and on up the long straight road that in the high <name type="DATE">day</name>s had been made to run from the fair <name type="FAC">Tower</name> of the <name type="ORG">Sun</name> to the tall <name type="FAC">Tower</name> of the <name type="PERSON">Moon</name>, which now was Minas <name type="PERSON">Morgul</name> in its accursed <name type="GPE">vale</name>. <name type="CARDINAL">Five</name> miles beyond <name type="NORP">Osgiliath</name> they halted, ending their <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> <name type="DATE">day</name>'s <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ch.</p>
<p>But the horsemen pressed on and ere <name type="TIME">evening</name> they came to the <name type="ORG">Cross</name>-roads and the great <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng of trees, and all was silent. No sign of any enemy had they seen, no cry or call had been heard, no shaft had sped from rock or thicket by the way, yet ever as they went forward they felt the watchfulness of the land increase. <name type="PERSON">Tree</name> and st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, blade and leaf were lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing. The darkness had been dispelled, and far away westward sunset was on the Vale of <name type="GPE">Anduin</name>, and the white peaks of the mountains blushed in the blue air; but a shadow and a gloom brooded upon the <name type="FAC">Ephel D�ath</name>.</p>
<p>Then <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> set trumpeters at each of the <name type="CARDINAL">four</name> roads that ran into the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng of trees, and they blew a great fanfare, and the heralds c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed aloud: <q>'The <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rds of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> have returned and all this land that is theirs they take back.'</q> The hideous orc-head that was set upon the <name type="PERSON">carven</name> figure was cast down and broken in pieces, and the old king's head was raised and set in its place once more, still crowned with white and golden flowers: and men laboured to wash and pare away all the foul scrawls that orcs had put upon the st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>.</p>
<p>Now in their debate some had counselled that Minas <name type="PERSON">Morgul</name> should <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> be assailed, and if they might take it, it should be utterly destroyed. <q><name type="PERSON">'And</name>, maybe,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Imrahil</name>, <q>'the road that leads thence to the pass above will prove an easier way of assault upon the Dark <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd than his northern gate.'</q></p>
<p>But against this <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> had spoken urgently, because of the evil that dwelt in the valley, where the minds of living men would turn to madness and horror, and because also of the news that <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name> had brought. For if the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>-bearer had indeed attempted that way, then above all they should not draw the <name type="PRODUCT">Eye</name> of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> thither. So the next <name type="DATE">day</name> when the main host came up, they set a strong guard upon the <name type="ORG">Cross</name>-roads to make some de<name type="PERSON">fen</name>ce, if <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> should send a force over the <name type="PERSON">Morgul</name> Pass, or should b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng more men up from the <name type="LOC">South</name>. For that guard they chose mostly archers who knew the ways of <name type="ORG">Ithil</name>ien and would lie hid in the woods and slopes about the meeting of the ways. But <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> and <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> rode with the vanguard to the entrance of <name type="PERSON">Morgul</name> Vale and looked on the evil city.</p>
<p>It was dark and lifeless; for the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s and lesser creatures of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> that had dwelt there had been destroyed in battle, and the Nazg�l were abroad. Yet the air of the valley was heavy with fear and enmity. Then they broke the evil b<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge and set red flames in the noisome fields and departed.</p>
<p><name type="DATE">The <name type="DATE">day</name></name> after, being the <name type="ORDINAL">third</name> <name type="DATE">day</name> since they set out from Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name>, the army began its northward <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ch along the road. It was some <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name> miles by that way from the <name type="ORG">Cross</name>-roads to the <name type="GPE">Morannon</name>, and what might befall them before they came so far n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> knew They went openly but heedfully, with mounted scouts before them on the road, and others on foot upon either side, especially on the eastward flank; for there lay dark thickets, and a tumbled land of rocky <name type="ORG">ghylls</name> and crags, behind which the long g<name type="GPE">ri</name>m slopes of the <name type="FAC">Ephel D�ath</name> clambered up. The weather of the world remained fair and the wind held in the west, but nothing could waft away the glooms and the sad mists that clung about the <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s of <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>; and behind them at whiles great smokes would a<name type="GPE">ri</name>se and hover in the upper winds.</p>
<p>Ever and anon <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> let blow the trumpets, and the heralds would cry: "The <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rds of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> are come! Let all leave this land or yield them up!<q>' But <name type="PERSON">Imrahil</name> said: 'Say not _The <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rds of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>_. Say _The <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g <name type="ORG">Elessar</name>_. For that is true, even though he has not yet sat upon the thr<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>; and it will give the Enemy more thought, if the heralds use that name.'</q> And thereafter th<name type="GPE">ri</name>ce <name type="DATE">a <name type="DATE">day</name></name> the heralds proclaimed the coming of the <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g <name type="ORG">Elessar</name>. But n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> answered the challenge.</p>
<p>N<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>theless, though they <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ched in seeming peace, the hearts of all the army, from the highest to the lowest, were downcast, and with <name type="QUANTITY">every mile</name> that they went north foreboding of evil grew heavier on them. It was near the end of the <name type="ORG">sec</name>ond <name type="DATE">day</name> of their <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ch from the <name type="ORG">Cross</name>-roads that they <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> met any offer of battle. For a strong force of <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s and <name type="LOC">East</name>erlings attempted to take their leading companies in an am<name type="PERSON">bush</name>; and that was in the very place where <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name> had <name type="ORG">waylaid</name> the men of <name type="ORG">Harad</name>, and the road went in a deep cutting through an out-thrust of the eastward <name type="ORG">hill</name>s. But the Captains of the <name type="LOC">West</name> were well warned by their scouts, skilled men from <name type="ORG">Hen</name>neth <name type="PERSON">Ann�n</name> led by <name type="ORG">Mablung</name>; and so the am<name type="PERSON">bush</name> was itself trapped. For horsemen went wide about westward and came up on the flank of the enemy and from behind, and they were destroyed or d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ven east into the <name type="ORG">hill</name>s.</p>
<p>But the victory did little to enhear<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> the captains. <q><name type="DATE">'It</name> is but a feint,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>; <q>'and its chief purpose, I deem, was rather to draw us on by a false guess of our Enemy's weakness than to do us much hurt, yet.'</q> And from that <name type="TIME">evening</name> onward the Nazg�l came and followed every move of the army. They still flew high and out of sight of all save <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>, and yet their presence could be felt, as a deepening of shadow and a dimming of the sun; and though the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>wraiths did not yet stoop low upon their foes and were silent, utte<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng no cry, the dread of them could not be shaken off.</p>
<p>So time and the hopeless journey wore away. Upon the <name type="CARDINAL">four</name>th <name type="DATE">day</name> from the <name type="ORG">Cross</name>-roads and the <name type="CARDINAL">six</name>th from Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name> they came at last to the end of the living lands, and began to pass into the desolation that lay before the gates of the Pass of <name type="PERSON">Ci<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name> Gorgor; and they could descry the <name type="PERSON">mar</name>shes and the desert that stretched north and west to the <name type="ORG">Emyn Muil</name>. So desolate were those places and so deep the horror that lay on them that some of the host were unmanned, and they could neither walk nor <name type="GPE">ri</name>de further north.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> looked at them, and there was pity in his eyes rather than wrath; for these were young men from <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>, from <name type="LOC">West</name>fold far away, or husbandmen from <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ssarnach, and to them <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> had been from childhood a name of evil, and yet unreal, a legend that had no part in their simple life; and now they walked like men in a hideous dream made true, and they understood not this war nor why fate should lead them to such a pass.</p>
<p><q><name type="CARDINAL">'Go</name>!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'But keep what honour you may, and do not run! And there is a task which you may attempt and so be not wholly shamed. Take your way south-west till you come to Cair <name type="PERSON">Andros</name>, and if that is still held by enemies, as I think, then re-take it, if you can; and hold it to the last in de<name type="PERSON">fen</name>ce of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> and <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>!'</q></p>
<p>Then some being shamed by his mercy overcame their fear and went on, and the others took new hope, hea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng of a manful deed within their measure that they could turn to, and they departed. And so, since many men had already been left at the <name type="ORG">Cross</name>-roads, it was with <name type="CARDINAL">less than <name type="CARDINAL">six</name> <name type="CARDINAL">thousands</name></name> that the Captains of the <name type="LOC">West</name> came at last to challenge the <name type="ORG">Black</name> <name type="FAC">Gate</name> and the might of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>.</p>
<p>They advanced now slowly, expecting at <name type="TIME">every <name type="TIME">hour</name></name> some answer to their challenge, and they drew together, since it was but waste of men to send out scouts or small parties from the main host. At <name type="TIME">night</name>fall of the <name type="ORDINAL">fifth</name> <name type="DATE">day</name> of the <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ch from <name type="PERSON">Morgul</name> Vale they made their last camp, and set fires about it of such dead wood and heath as they could find. They passed the <name type="TIME">hour</name>s of <name type="TIME">night</name> in wakefulness and they were aware of many things <name type="CARDINAL">half</name>-seen that walked and prowled all about them, and they heard the howling of wolves. The wind had died and all the air seemed still. They could see little, for though it was cloudless and the waxing moon was <name type="CARDINAL">four</name> <name type="TIME">night</name>s old, there were smokes and fumes that rose out of the <name type="LOC">earth</name> and <name type="ORG">the white crescent</name> was shrouded in the mists of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>.</p>
<p>It grew cold. As <name type="TIME">morning</name> came the wind began to stir again, but now it came from the <name type="LOC">North</name>, and soon it freshened to a <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing breeze. All the <name type="TIME">night</name>-walkers were g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, and the land seemed empty. <name type="LOC">North</name> amid their noisome pits lay the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> of the great heaps and <name type="ORG">hill</name>s of slag and broken rock and blasted <name type="LOC">earth</name>, the vomit of the maggot-folk of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>; but south and now near loomed the great rampart of <name type="PERSON">Ci<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name> Gorgor, and the <name type="ORG">Black</name> <name type="FAC">Gate</name> amidmost, and the <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> <name type="FAC">Tower</name>s of the Teeth tall and dark upon either side. For in their last <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ch the Captains had turned away from the old road as it bent east, and avoided the pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>l of the lurking <name type="ORG">hill</name>s, and so now they were approa<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g the <name type="GPE">Morannon</name> from the north-west, even as <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> had d<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>.</p>
<p>The <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> vast iron doors of the <name type="ORG">Black</name> <name type="FAC">Gate</name> under its frowning arch were fast closed. Upon the battlement nothing could be seen. All was silent but watchful. They were come to the last end of their folly, and stood forlorn and c<name type="ORG">hill</name> in the grey light of early <name type="DATE">day</name> before towers and walls which their army could not assault with hope, not even if it had brought thither engines of great power, and the Enemy had no more force than would suffice for the manning of the gate and wall al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. Yet they knew that all the <name type="ORG">hill</name>s and rocks about the <name type="GPE">Morannon</name> were filled with hidden foes, and the shadowy defile beyond was bored and tunnelled by teeming broods of evil things. And as they stood they saw all the Nazg�l gathered together, hove<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng above the <name type="FAC">Tower</name>s of the Teeth like vultures; and they knew that they were watched. But still the Enemy made no sign.</p>
<p>No choice was left them but to play their part to its end. Therefore <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> now set the host in such array as could best be cont<name type="GPE">ri</name>ved; and they were drawn up on <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> great <name type="ORG">hill</name>s of blasted st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> and <name type="LOC">earth</name> that orcs had piled in <name type="DATE">year</name>s of labour. Before them towards <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> lay like a moat a great mire of <name type="GPE">reek</name>ing mud and foul-smelling pools. When all was ordered, the Captains rode forth towards the <name type="ORG">Black</name> <name type="FAC">Gate</name> with a great guard of horsemen and the banner and heralds and trumpeters. There was <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> as chief herald, and <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> with the sons of <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name>, and �omer of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>, and <name type="PERSON">Imrahil</name>; and <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> and <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> and <name type="PERSON">Pereg<name type="GPE">ri</name>n</name> were bidden to go also, so that all the enemies of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> should have a witness.</p>
<p>They came within cry of the <name type="GPE">Morannon</name>, and unfurled the banner, and blew upon their trumpets; and the heralds stood out and sent their voices up over the battlement of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>.</p>
<p><q><name type="WORK_OF_ART">'<name type="WORK_OF_ART">Come</name></name> forth!'</q> they c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed. <q>'Let the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd of the <name type="ORG">Black</name> Land come forth! Justice shall be d<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> upon him. For wrongfully he has made war upon <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> and wrested its lands. Therefore the <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> demands that he should at<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> for his evils, and depart then for ever. <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Come</name> forth!'</q></p>
<p>There was a long silence, and from wall and gate no cry or sound was heard in answer. But <name type="ORG">Sauron</name> had already laid his plans, and he had a mind <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> to play these mice cruelly before he struck to kill. So it was that, even as the Captains were about to turn away, the silence was broken suddenly. There came a long rolling of great drums like thunder in the mountains, and then a braying of horns that shook the very st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s and stunned men's ears. And thereupon the middle door of the <name type="ORG">Black</name> <name type="FAC">Gate</name> was thrown open with a great clang, and out of it there came an embassy from the Dark <name type="FAC">Tower</name>.</p>
<p>At its head there rode a tall and evil shape, mounted upon a black horse, if horse it was; for it was huge and hideous, and its face was a f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ghtful mask, more like a skull than a living head, and in the sockets of its eyes and in its nost<name type="GPE">ri</name>ls there burned a flame. The <name type="GPE">ri</name>der was robed all in black, and black was his lofty helm; yet this was no <name type="ORG">Ring</name>wraith but a living man. The Lieu<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ant of the <name type="FAC">Tower</name> of <name type="FAC">Barad-d</name>�r he was, and his name is remembered in no tale; for he himself had forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> it, and he said: <q>'I am the Mouth of <name type="ORG">Sauron</name>.'</q> But it is told that he was a renegade, who came of the race of those that are named the <name type="ORG">Black</name> N�men�reans; for they established their dwellings in <name type="LOC">Middle-<name type="LOC">earth</name></name> du<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng <name type="DATE">the <name type="DATE">year</name></name>s of <name type="ORG">Sauron</name>'s domination, and they worshipped him, being enamoured of evil knowledge. And he entered the service of the Dark <name type="FAC">Tower</name> when it <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> rose again, and because of his cunning he grew ever higher in the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd's favour; and he learned great sorcery, and knew much of the mind of <name type="ORG">Sauron</name>; and he was more cruel than any orc.</p>
<p>He it was that now rode out, and with him came only a small company of black-harnessed soldiery, and a single banner, black but bea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng on it in red the Evil <name type="PRODUCT">Eye</name>. Now halting a few paces before the Captains of the <name type="LOC">West</name> he looked them up and down and laughed.</p>
<p><q>'Is there any<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> in this rout with autho<name type="GPE">ri</name>ty to treat with me?'</q> he asked. <q>'Or indeed with wit to understand me? Not thou at least!'</q> he mocked, turning to <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> with scorn. <q><name type="DATE">'It</name> needs more to make a king than a piece of elvish glass, or a rabble such as this. Why, any b<name type="GPE">ri</name>gand of the <name type="ORG">hill</name>s can show as good a following!'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> said naught in answer, but he took the other's eye and held it, and for a moment they strove thus; but soon, though <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> did not stir nor move hand to weapon, the other quailed and gave back as if menaced with a blow. <q>'I am a herald and ambassador, and may not be assailed!'</q> he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed.</p>
<p><q>'Where such laws hold,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, <q>'it is also the cus<name type="PERSON">tom</name> for ambassadors to use less insolence. But no <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> has threa<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed you. You have naught to fear from us, until your errand is d<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. But unless your master has come to new wisdom, then with all his servants you will be in great pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>l.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="CARDINAL">'So</name>!'</q> said the <name type="PERSON">Messenger</name>. <q><name type="ORG">'Then</name> thou art the spokesman, old greybeard? Have we not heard of thee at whiles, and of thy <name type="PERSON">wan</name>de<name type="GPE">ri</name>ngs, ever hat<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g plots and mischief at a safe distance? But this time thou hast stuck out thy nose too far, Master <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>; and thou shalt see what comes to him who sets his foolish webs before the feet of <name type="ORG">Sauron</name> the Great. I have tokens that I was bidden to show to thee � to thee in especial, if thou shouldst dare to come.'</q> He signed to <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of his guards, and he came forward bea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng a bundle swathed in black cloths.</p>
<p>The <name type="PERSON">Messenger</name> put these aside, and there to the wonder and dismay of all the Captains he held up <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> the short sword that <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> had car<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed, and next a grey cloak with an <name type="ORG">elven</name>-brooch, and last the coat of <name type="PERSON">mith<name type="GPE">ri</name>l</name>-mail that <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> had worn wrapped in his tattered garments. A blackness came before their eyes, and it seemed to them in a moment of silence that the world stood still, but their hearts were dead and their last hope g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> who stood behind P<name type="GPE">ri</name>nce <name type="PERSON">Imrahil</name> sprang forward with a cry of g<name type="GPE">ri</name>ef.</p>
<p><q>'Silence!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> sternly, thrusting him back; but the <name type="PERSON">Messenger</name> laughed aloud.</p>
<p><q><name type="CARDINAL">'So</name> you have yet another of these imps with you!'</q> he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed. <q>'What use you find in them I cannot guess; but to send them as spies into <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> is beyond even your accus<name type="PERSON">tom</name>ed folly. Still, I thank him, for it is plain that this brat at least has seen these tokens before, and it would be vain for you to deny them now.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I do not wish to deny them,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'Indeed, I know them all and all their history, and despite your scorn, foul Mouth of <name type="ORG">Sauron</name>, you cannot say as much. But why do you b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng them here?'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="WORK_OF_ART">Dwarf</name>-coat, elf-cloak, blade of the downfallen <name type="LOC">West</name>, and spy from the little rat-land of the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>-nay; do not start! We know it well � here are the <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ks of a conspiracy. Now, maybe he that bore these things was a creature that you would not g<name type="GPE">ri</name>eve to lose, and maybe otherwise: <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> dear to you, perhaps? If so, take swift counsel with what little wit is left to you. For <name type="ORG">Sauron</name> does not love spies, and what his fate shall be depends now on your choice.'</q></p>
<p>No <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> answered him; but he saw their faces grey with fear and the horror in their eyes, and he laughed again, for it seemed to him that his sport went well. <q><name type="CARDINAL">'Go</name>od, good!'</q> he said. <q><name type="CARDINAL">'He</name> was dear to you, I see. Or else his errand was <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> that you did not wish to fail? It has. And now he shall endure the slow torment of <name type="DATE">year</name>s, as long and slow as our arts in the Great <name type="FAC">Tower</name> can cont<name type="GPE">ri</name>ve, and never be released, unless maybe when he is changed and broken, so that he may come to you, and you shall see what you have d<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. This shall surely be-unless you accept my <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd's terms.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Name the terms,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> steadily, but those nearby saw the anguish in his face, and now he seemed an old and wizened man, crushed, defeated at <name type="DATE">last.</name> They did not doubt that he would accept.</p>
<p><q>'These are the terms,'</q> said the <name type="PERSON">Messenger</name>, and smiled as he eyed them <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> by <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. <q>'The rabble of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> and its deluded allies shall withdraw at once beyond the <name type="GPE">Anduin</name>, <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> taking oaths never again to assail <name type="ORG">Sauron</name> the Great in arms, open or <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret. All lands east of <name type="GPE">Anduin</name> shall be <name type="ORG">Sauron</name>'s for ever, solely. <name type="LOC">West</name> of the <name type="GPE">Anduin</name> as far as the <name type="LOC">Misty <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s</name> and the <name type="ORG">Gap</name> of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> shall be t<name type="GPE">ri</name>butary to <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>, and men there shall bear no weapons, but shall have leave to govern their own affairs. But they shall help to rebuild <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard which they have <name type="PERSON">wan</name>tonly destroyed, and that shall be <name type="ORG">Sauron</name>'s, and there his lieu<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ant shall dwell: not <name type="ORG">Saruman</name>, but <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> more worthy of trust.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Lo</name>oking in the <name type="PERSON">Messenger</name>'s eyes they read his thought. He was to be that lieu<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ant, and gather all that remained of the <name type="LOC">West</name> under his sway; he would be their tyrant and they his slaves.</p>
<p>But <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> said: <q>'This is much to demand for the delivery of <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> servant: that your Master should receive in exchange what he must else fight many a war to gain! Or has the field of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> destroyed his hope in war, so that he falls to haggling? And if indeed we rated this p<name type="GPE">ri</name>s<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>r so high, what surety have we that <name type="ORG">Sauron</name> the Base Master of Treachery, will keep his part? Where is this p<name type="GPE">ri</name>s<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>r? Let him be brought forth and yielded to us, and then we will consider these demands.'</q></p>
<p>It seemed then to <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, in<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>t, wat<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g him as a man engaged in <name type="PERSON">fen</name>cing with a deadly foe, that for the taking of a breath the <name type="PERSON">Messenger</name> was at a loss; yet swiftly he laughed again.</p>
<p><q>'Do not bandy words in your insolence with the Mouth of <name type="ORG">Sauron</name>!'</q> he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed. <q>'Surety you crave! <name type="ORG">Sauron</name> gives n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. If you sue for his clemency you must <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> do his bidding. These are his terms. Take them or leave them!'</q></p>
<p><q>'These we will take!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> suddenly. He cast aside his cloak and a white light sh<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> forth like a sword in that black place. Before his upraised hand the foul <name type="PERSON">Messenger</name> recoiled, and <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> coming seized and took from him the tokens: coat, cloak, and sword. <q>'These we will take in memory of our f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end,'</q> he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed. <q>'But as for your terms, we reject them utterly. Get you g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, for your embassy is over and death is near to you. We did not come here to waste words in treating with <name type="ORG">Sauron</name>, faithless and accursed; still less with <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of his slaves. Beg<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>!'</q></p>
<p>Then the <name type="PERSON">Messenger</name> of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> laughed no more. His face was twisted with amazement and anger to the likeness of some wild beast that, as it crouches on its prey, is smit<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> on the muzzle with a stinging rod. Rage filled him and his mouth slavered, and shapeless sounds of fury came strangling from his throat. But he looked at the fell faces of the Captains and their deadly eyes, and fear overcame his wrath. He gave a great cry, and turned, leaped upon his <name type="PERSON">steed</name>, and with his company galloped madly back to <name type="PERSON">Ci<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name> Gorgor. But as they went his soldiers blew their horns in signal long arranged; and even before they came to the gate <name type="ORG">Sauron</name> sprang his trap.</p>
<p>Drums rolled and fires leaped up. The great doors of the <name type="ORG">Black</name> <name type="FAC">Gate</name> swung back wide. Out of it streamed a great host as swiftly as swirling waters when a sluice is lifted.</p>
<p>The Captains mounted again and rode back, and from the host of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> there went up a jee<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng yell. Dust rose smothe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng the air, as from nearby there <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ched up an army of <name type="LOC">East</name>erlings that had waited for the signal in the shadows of <name type="ORG">Ered Lithui</name> beyond the further <name type="FAC">Tower</name>. Down from the <name type="ORG">hill</name>s on either side of the <name type="GPE">Morannon</name> poured <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s innumerable. The men of the <name type="LOC">West</name> were trapped, and soon. all about the grey mounds where they stood, forces <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> times and <name type="CARDINAL">more than <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name></name> times their match would <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng them in a sea of enemies. <name type="ORG">Sauron</name> had taken the proffered bait in jaws of steel.</p>
<p>Little time was left to <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> for the orde<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng of his battle. Upon the <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> <name type="ORG">hill</name> he stood with <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, and there fair and desperate was raised the banner of the <name type="PERSON">Tree</name> and <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Stars</name>. Upon the other <name type="ORG">hill</name> hard by stood the banners of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> and Dol <name type="PERSON">Amroth</name>, White <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>rse and Silver <name type="PERSON">S<name type="PERSON">wan</name></name>. And about each <name type="ORG">hill</name> a <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng was made facing all ways, b<name type="GPE">ri</name>stling with spear and sword. But in the front towards <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> where the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> bitter assault would come there stood the sons of <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name> on the left with the D�nedain about them, and on the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght the P<name type="GPE">ri</name>nce <name type="PERSON">Imrahil</name> with the men of Dol <name type="PERSON">Amroth</name> tall and fair, and picked men of the <name type="FAC">Tower</name> of <name type="ORG">Guard</name>.</p>
<p>The wind blew, and the trumpets sang, and arrows whined; but the sun now climbing towards the <name type="LOC">South</name> was veiled in the <name type="GPE">reek</name>s of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>, and through a threa<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing haze it gleamed, remote, a sullen red, as if it were the ending of the <name type="DATE">day</name>, or the end maybe of all the world of light. And out of the gathe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng mirk the Nazg�l came with. their cold voices crying words of death; and then all hope was quenched.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> had bowed crushed with horror when he heard <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> reject the terms and doom <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> to the torment of the <name type="FAC">Tower</name>; but he had mastered himself, and now he stood beside <name type="PERSON">Beregond</name> in the front rank of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> with <name type="PERSON">Imrahil</name>'s men. For it seemed best to him to die soon and leave the bitter story of his life, since all was in ruin.</p>
<p><q>'I wish <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> was here,'</q> he heard himself saying, and quick thoughts raced through his mind, even as he watched the enemy come charging to the assault. <q>'Well, well, now at any rate I understand poor <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name> a little better. We might die together, <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> and I, and since die we must, why not? Well, as he is not here, I hope he'll find an easier end. But now I must do my best.'</q></p>
<p>He drew his sword and looked at it, and the intertwining shapes of red and gold; and the flowing characters of N�menor glinted like fire upon the blade. <q>'This was made for just such <name type="TIME">an <name type="TIME">hour</name></name>,'</q> he thought. <q>'If only I could smite that foul <name type="PERSON">Messenger</name> with it, then almost I should draw level with old <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. Well, I'll smite some of this beastly brood before the end. I wish I could see cool sunlight and green grass again!'</q></p>
<p>Then even as he thought these things the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> assault crashed into them. The orcs hindered by the mires that lay before the <name type="ORG">hill</name>s halted and poured their arrows into the de<name type="PERSON">fen</name>ding ranks. But through them there came st<name type="GPE">ri</name>ding up, roa<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng like beasts, a great company of <name type="ORG">hill</name>-trolls out of <name type="PERSON">Gorgoroth</name>. Taller and broader than <name type="ORG">Men</name> they were, and they were clad only in close-fitting mesh of horny scales, or maybe that was their hideous hide; but they bore round bucklers huge and black and wielded heavy hammers in their knotted hands. Reckless they sprang into the pools and waded across, bellowing as they came. Like a storm they broke upon the line of the men of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>, and beat upon helm and head, and arm and shield as <name type="PERSON">smith</name>s hewing the hot bending iron. At <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>'s side <name type="PERSON">Beregond</name> was stunned and overborne, and he fell; and the great troll-chief that smote him down bent over him, rea<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g out a clut<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g claw; for these fell creatures would bite the throats of those that they threw down.</p>
<p>Then <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> stabbed upwards, and the w<name type="GPE">ri</name>t<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> blade of <name type="LOC">West</name>ernesse pierced through the hide and went deep into the vitals of the troll, and his black blood came gushing out. He toppled forward and came crashing down like a falling rock, burying those beneath him. <name type="ORG">Black</name>ness and s<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ch and crushing pain came upon <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>, and his mind fell away into a great darkness.</p>
<p><q><name type="CARDINAL">'So</name> it ends as I guessed it would,'</q> his thought said, even as it fluttered away; and it laughed a little within him ere it fled, almost gay it seemed to be casting off at last all doubt and care and fear. And then even as it winged away into forgetfulness it heard voices, and they seemed to be crying in some forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> world far above:</p>
<p><q>'The <name type="PRODUCT">Eagle</name>s are coming! The <name type="PRODUCT">Eagle</name>s are coming!'</q></p>
<p>For <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> moment more <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>'s thought hovered. <q><name type="PERSON">'<name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name></name>!'</q> it said. <q>'But no! That came in his tale, long <name type="DATE">long ago</name>. This is my tale, and it is ended now. Good-bye!'</q> And his thought fled far away and his eyes saw no more.</p>

<p>The <name type="FAC">Tower</name> of <name type="PERSON">Ci<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name> Ungol</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> roused himself painfully from the ground. For a moment he wondered where he was, and then all the misery and despair returned to him. He was in the deep dark outside the under-gate of the orcs' stronghold; its brazen doors were shut. He must have fallen stunned when he hurled himself against them; but how long he had lain there he did not know. Then he had been on fire, desperate and fu<name type="GPE">ri</name>ous; now he was shive<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng and cold. He crept to the doors and pressed his ears against them.</p>
<p>Far within he could hear faintly the voices of ores clamou<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng, but soon they stopped or passed out of hea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng, and all was still. His head ached and his eyes saw phan<name type="PERSON">tom</name> lights in the darkness, but he struggled to steady himself and think. It was clear at any rate that he had no hope of getting into the orc-hold by that gate; he might wait there for <name type="DATE">day</name>s before it was opened, and he could not wait: time was desperately precious. He no longer had any doubt about his duty: he must rescue his master or pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>sh in the attempt.</p>
<p><q>'The pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>shing is more likely, and will be a lot easier anyway,'</q> he said g<name type="GPE">ri</name>mly to himself, as he sheathed <name type="PERSON">Sting</name> and turned from the brazen doors. Slowly he groped his way back in the dark along the tunnel, not da<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng to use the <name type="ORG">elven</name>-light; and as he went he t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed to fit together the events since <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and he had left the <name type="ORG">Cross</name>-roads. He wondered what the time was. Somewhere <name type="DATE">between <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> <name type="DATE">day</name></name> and the next, he supposed; but even of the <name type="DATE">day</name>s he had quite lost count. He was in a land of darkness where the <name type="DATE">day</name>s of the world seemed forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>, and where all who entered were forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> too.</p>
<p><q>'I wonder if they think of us at all,'</q> he said, <q>'and what is happening to them all away there.'</q> He waved his hand vaguely in the air before him; but he was in fact now facing southwards, as he came back to <name type="FAC">Shelob</name>'s tunnel, not west. Out westward in the world it was drawing to <name type="TIME">noon</name> upon the <name type="CARDINAL">four</name>teenth <name type="DATE">day</name> of <name type="DATE">March</name> in the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>-reckoning. And even now <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> was leading the black fleet from <name type="NORP">Pelargir</name>, and <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> was <name type="GPE">ri</name>ding with the Rohir<name type="GPE">ri</name>m down the <name type="ORG">St<name type="CARDINAL">one</name></name><name type="PERSON">wain</name> <name type="LOC">Valley</name>, while in Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name> flames were <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> watched the madness growing in the eyes of <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name>. Yet amid all their cares and fear the thoughts of their f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends turned constantly to <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. They were not forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>. But they were far beyond aid, and no thought could yet b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng any help to <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>wise <name type="LOC">Hamfast</name>'s son; he was utterly al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>.</p>
<p>He came back at last to the st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> door of the orc-passage, and still unable to discover the catch or bolt that held it, he scrambled over as before and dropped softly to the ground. Then he made his way stealthily to the outlet of <name type="FAC">Shelob</name>'s tunnel, where the rags of her great web were still blowing and swaying in the cold airs. For cold they seemed to <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> after the noisome darkness behind; but the breath of them revived him. He crept cautiously out.</p>
<p>All was ominously quiet. The light was no more than that of <name type="TIME">dusk</name> at a dark <name type="DATE">day</name>'s end. The vast vapours that arose in <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> and went streaming westward passed low overhead, a great welter of cloud and smoke now lit again beneath with a sullen glow of red.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> looked <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name>wards the orc-tower, and suddenly from its narrow windows lights stared out like small red eyes. He wondered if they were some signal. His fear of the orcs, forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> for a while in his wrath and desperation, now returned. As far as he could see, there was only <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> possible course for him to take: he must go on and try to find the main entrance to the dreadful tower; but his knees felt weak, and he found that he was trembling. Drawing his eyes down from the tower and the horns of the <name type="NORP">Cleft</name> before him, he forced his unwilling feet to obey him, and slowly, lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing with all his ears, pee<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng into the dense shadows of the rocks beside the way, he retraced his steps, past the place where <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> fell, and still the s<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ch of <name type="FAC">Shelob</name> lingered, and then on and up, until he stood again in the very cleft where he had put on the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> and seen <name type="ORG">Shagrat</name>'s company go by.</p>
<p>There he halted and sat down. For the moment he could d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ve himself no further. He felt that if once he went beyond the crown of the pass and took <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> step ve<name type="GPE">ri</name>tably down into the land of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>, that step would be irrevocable. He could never come back. Without any clear purpose he drew out the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> and put it on again. Immediately he felt the great burden of its w<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name>, and felt afresh, but now more strong and urgent than ever, the malice of the <name type="PRODUCT">Eye</name> of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>, sear<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g, trying to pierce the shadows that it had made for its own de<name type="PERSON">fen</name>ce, but which now hindered it in its unquiet and doubt.</p>
<p>As before, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> found that his hea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng was sharpened, but that to his sight the things of this world seemed thin and vague. The rocky walls of the path were pale, as if seen through a mist, but still at a distance he heard the bubbling of <name type="FAC">Shelob</name> in her misery: and harsh and clear, and very close it seemed, he heard c<name type="GPE">ri</name>es and the clash of metal. He sprang to his feet, and pressed himself against the wall beside the road. He was glad of the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>, for here was yet another company of orcs on the <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ch. Or so at <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> he thought. Then suddenly he realized that it was not so, his hea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng had deceived him: the orc-c<name type="GPE">ri</name>es came from the tower, whose topmost horn was now <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght above him, on the left hand of the <name type="NORP">Cleft</name>.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> shuddered and t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed to force himself to move. There was plainly some devilry going on. Perhaps in spite of all orders the cruelty of the orcs had mastered them, and they were tormenting <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, or even savagely hacking him to pieces. He lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed; and as he did a gleam of hope came to him. There could not be much doubt: there was fighting in the tower, the orcs must be at war among themselves, <name type="ORG">Shagrat</name> and <name type="GPE">Gorbag</name> had come to blows. Faint as was the hope that his guess brought him, it was enough to rouse him. There might be just a chance. His love for <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> rose above all other thoughts, and forgetting his pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>l he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed aloud: <q>'I'm coming, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>!'</q></p>
<p>He ran forward to the climbing path, and over it. At once the road turned left and plunged steeply down. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> had crossed into <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>.</p>
<p>He took off the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>, moved it may be by some deep premonition of danger, though to himself he thought only that he wished to see more clearly. `Better have a look at the worst,<q>' he muttered. `No good blunde<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng about in a fog!'</q></p>
<p>Hard and cruel and bitter was the land that met his gaze. Before his feet the highest <name type="GPE">ri</name>dge of the <name type="FAC">Ephel D�ath</name> fell steeply in great cliffs down into a dark trough, on the further side of which there rose another <name type="GPE">ri</name>dge, much lower, its edge notched and jagged with crags like fangs that stood out black against the red light behind them: it was the g<name type="GPE">ri</name>m Morgai, the inner <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng of the <name type="PERSON">fen</name>ces of the land. Far beyond it, but almost straight ahead, across a wide lake of darkness dotted with tiny fires, there was a great burning glow; and from it rose in huge columns a swirling smoke, dusty red at the roots, black above where it merged into the billowing canopy that roo<name type="ORG">fed</name> in all the accursed land.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> was looking at <name type="LOC">Orodruin</name>, the <name type="LOC">Mountain</name> of <name type="ORG">Fire</name>. Ever and anon the furnaces far below its ashen c<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> would grow hot and with a great surging and throbbing pour forth <name type="GPE">ri</name>vers of mol<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> rock from chasms in its sides. Some would flow blazing towards <name type="FAC">Barad-d</name>�r down great channels; some would wind their way into the stony plain, until they cooled and lay like twisted dragon-shapes vomited from the tormented <name type="LOC">earth</name>. In such <name type="TIME">an <name type="TIME">hour</name></name> of labour <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> beheld <name type="LOC">Mount Doom</name>, and the light of it, cut off by the high screen of the <name type="FAC">Ephel D�ath</name> from those who climbed up the path from the <name type="LOC">West</name>, now glared against the stark rock faces, so that they seemed to be drenched with blood.</p>
<p>In that dreadful light <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> stood aghast, for now, looking to his left, he could see the <name type="FAC">Tower</name> of <name type="PERSON">Ci<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name> Ungol in all its strength. The horn that he had seen from the other side was only its topmost turret. Its eastern face stood up in <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> great tiers from a shelf in the mountain-wall far below; its back was to a great cliff behind, from which it jutted out in pointed bastions, <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> above the other, diminishing as they rose, with sheer sides of cunning masonry that looked north-east and south-east. About the lowest tier, <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name> feet below where <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> now stood, there was a battlemented wall enclosing a narrow court. Its gate, upon the near south-eastern side, opened on a broad road, the outer parapet of which ran upon the b<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk of a precipice, until it turned southward and went winding down into the darkness to join the road that came over the <name type="PERSON">Morgul</name> Pass. Then on it went through a jagged <name type="GPE">ri</name>ft in the Morgai out into the valley of <name type="PERSON">Gorgoroth</name> and away to <name type="FAC">Barad-d</name>�r. The narrow upper way on which <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> stood leapt swiftly down by stair and steep path to meet the main road under the frowning walls close to the <name type="FAC">Tower</name>-gate.</p>
<p>As he gazed at it suddenly <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> understood, almost with a shock, that this stronghold had been built not to keep enemies out of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>, but to keep them in. It was indeed <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the works of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> <name type="DATE">long ago</name>, an eastern outpost of the de<name type="PERSON">fen</name>ces of <name type="ORG">Ithil</name>ien, made when, after <name type="ORG">the Last Alliance</name>, <name type="ORG">Men</name> of <name type="LOC">West</name>ernesse kept watch on the evil land of <name type="ORG">Sauron</name> where his creatures still lurked. But as with <name type="GPE">Narchost</name> and <name type="GPE">Carchost</name>, the <name type="FAC">Tower</name>s of the Teeth, so here too the vigilance had failed, and treachery had yielded up the <name type="FAC">Tower</name> to the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd of the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>wraiths, and now for <name type="DATE">long <name type="DATE">year</name>s</name> it had been held by evil things. Since his return to <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>, <name type="ORG">Sauron</name> had found it useful; for he had few servants but many slaves of fear, and still its chief purpose as of old was to prevent escape from <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>. Though if an enemy were so rash as to try to enter that land <name type="ORG">sec</name>retly, then it was also a last unsleeping guard against any that might pass the vigilance of <name type="PERSON">Morgul</name> and of <name type="FAC">Shelob</name>.</p>
<p>Only too clearly <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> saw how hopeless it would be for him to creep down under those many-eyed walls and pass the watchful gate. And even if he did so, he could not go far on the guarded road beyond: not even the black shadows, lying deep where the red glow could not reach, would shield him long from the <name type="TIME">night</name>-eyed orcs. But desperate as that road might be, his task was now far worse: not to avoid the gate and escape, but to enter it, al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>.</p>
<p>His thought turned to the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>, but there was no comfort there, only dread and danger. No so<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>r had he come in sight of <name type="LOC">Mount Doom</name>, burning far away, than he was aware of a change in his burden. As it drew near the great furnaces where, in the deeps of time, it had been shaped and forged, the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>'s power grew, and it became more fell, untameable save by some mighty will. As <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> stood there, even though the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> was not on him but hanging by its c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>n about his neck, he felt himself enlarged, as if he were robed in a huge distorted shadow of himself, a vast and ominous threat halted upon the walls of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>. He felt that he had from now on <name type="CARDINAL">only <name type="CARDINAL">two</name></name> choices: to forbear the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>, though it would torment him; or to claim it, and challenge the <name type="ORG">Power</name> that sat in its dark hold beyond the valley of shadows. Already the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> tempted him, gnawing at his will and reason. Wild fantasies arose in his mind; and he saw <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>wise the Strong, Hero of the Age, st<name type="GPE">ri</name>ding with a flaming sword across the darkened land, and armies flocking to his call as he <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ched to the overthrow of <name type="FAC">Barad-d</name>�r. And then all the clouds rolled away, and the white sun sh<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, and at his command the <name type="GPE">vale</name> of <name type="PERSON">Gorgoroth</name> became a garden of flowers and trees and brought forth fruit. He had only to put on the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> and claim it for his own, and all this could be.</p>
<p>In that <name type="TIME">hour</name> of t<name type="GPE">ri</name>al it was the love of his master that helped most to hold him firm; but also deep down in him lived still unconquered his plain hobbit-sense: he knew in the core of his heart that he was not large enough to bear such a burden, even if such visions were not a mere cheat to betray him. The <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> small garden of a free gardener was all his need and due, not a garden swollen to a realm; his own hands to use, not the hands of others to command.</p>
<p><q><name type="PERSON">'And</name> anyway all these notions are only a t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ck,'</q> he said to himself. <q><name type="CARDINAL">'He</name>'d spot me and cow me, before I could so much as shout out. He'd spot me, pretty quick, if I put the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> on now, in <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>. Well, all I can say is: things look as hopeless as a frost in sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng. Just when being invisible would be really useful, I can't use the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>! And if ever I get any further, it's going to be nothing but a drag and a burden every step. So what's to be d<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>?'</q></p>
<p>He was not really in any doubt. He knew that he must go down to the gate and not linger any more. With a shrug of his shoulders, as if to shake off the shadow and dismiss the phan<name type="PERSON">tom</name>s, he began slowly to descend. With each step he seemed to diminish. He had not g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> far before he had shrunk again to a very small and f<name type="GPE">ri</name>gh<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed hobbit. He was now passing under the very walls of the <name type="FAC">Tower</name>, and the c<name type="GPE">ri</name>es and sounds of fighting could be heard with his unaided ears. At the moment the noise seemed to be coming from the court behind the outer wall.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> was <name type="CARDINAL">about <name type="CARDINAL">half</name></name> way down the path when out of the dark gateway into the red glow there came <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> orcs running. They did not turn towards him. They were making for the main road; but even as they ran they stumbled and fell to the ground and lay still. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> had seen no arrows, but he guessed that the orcs had been shot down by others on the battlements or hidden in the shadow of the gate. He went on, hugging the wall on his left. <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> look upward had shown him that there was no hope of climbing it. The st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>-work rose <name type="CARDINAL">thirty</name> feet, without a crack or ledge, to overhanging courses like inverted steps. The gate was the only way.</p>
<p>He crept on; and as he went he wondered how many orcs lived in the <name type="FAC">Tower</name> with <name type="ORG">Shagrat</name>, and how many <name type="GPE">Gorbag</name> had, and what they were quarrelling about, if that was what was happening. <name type="ORG">Shagrat</name>'s company had seemed to be <name type="CARDINAL">about <name type="CARDINAL">forty</name></name>, and <name type="GPE">Gorbag</name>'s more than twice as large; but of course <name type="ORG">Shagrat</name>'s patrol had only been a part of his gar<name type="GPE">ri</name>son. Almost certainly they were quarrelling about <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, and the spoil. For a <name type="ORG">sec</name>ond <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> halted, for suddenly things seemed clear to him, almost as if he had seen them with his eyes. The <name type="PERSON">mith<name type="GPE">ri</name>l</name> coat! Of course, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> was wea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng it, and they would find it. And from what <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> had heard <name type="GPE">Gorbag</name> would covet it. But the orders of the Dark <name type="FAC">Tower</name> were at present <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s only protection, and if they were set aside, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> might be killed out of hand at any moment.</p>
<p><q><name type="WORK_OF_ART">'<name type="WORK_OF_ART">Come</name></name> on, you miserable sluggard!'</q> <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed to himself. `Now for it!' He drew <name type="PERSON">Sting</name> and ran towards the open gate. But just as he was about to pass under its great arch he felt a shock: as if he had run into some web like <name type="FAC">Shelob</name>'s, only invisible. He could see no obstacle, but something too strong for his will to overcome barred the way. He looked about, and then within the shadow of the gate he saw the <name type="CARDINAL">Two</name> <name type="PERSON">Watcher</name>s.</p>
<p>They were like great figures seated upon thr<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s. Each had <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> joined bodies, and <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> heads facing outward, and inward, and across the gateway. The heads had vulture-faces, and on their great knees were laid clawlike hands. They seemed to be carved out of huge blocks of st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, immovable, and yet they were aware: some dreadful spi<name type="GPE">ri</name>t of evil vigilance abode in them. They knew an enemy. Visible or invisible n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> could pass unheeded. They would forbid his entry, or his escape.</p>
<p>Hardening his will <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> thrust forward once again, and halted with a jerk, stagge<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng as if from a blow upon his breast and head. Then greatly da<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng, because he could think of nothing else to do, answe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng a sudden thought that came to him, he drew slowly out the phial of <name type="PERSON">Galad<name type="GPE">ri</name>el</name> and held it up. Its white light quickened swiftly, and the shadows under the dark arch fled. The monstrous <name type="PERSON">Watcher</name>s sat there cold and still, revealed in all their hideous shape. For a moment <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> caught a glitter in the black st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s of their eyes, the very malice of which made him quail; but slowly he felt their will waver and crumble into fear.</p>
<p>He sprang past them; but even as he did so, thrusting the phial back into his bosom, he was aware, as plainly as if a bar of steel had snapped to behind him, that their vigilance was renewed. And from those evil heads there came a high sh<name type="GPE">ri</name>ll cry that echoed in the towe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng walls before him. Far up above, like an answe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng signal, a harsh bell clanged a single stroke.</p>
<p><q>'That's d<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> it!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. `Now I've rung the front-door bell! Well, come on somebody!<q>' he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed. `Tell Captain <name type="ORG">Shagrat</name> that the great <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name>-war<name type="GPE">ri</name>or has called, with his elf-sword too!'</q></p>
<p>There was no answer. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> strode forward. <name type="PERSON">Sting</name> glittered blue in his hand. The courtyard lay in deep shadow, but he could see that the pavement was strewn with bodies. Right at his feet were <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> orc-archers with knives sticking in their backs. Beyond lay many more shapes; some singly as they had been hewn down or shot; others in pairs, still grappling <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> another, dead in the very throes of stabbing, throttling, biting. The st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s were slippery with dark blood.</p>
<p><name type="CARDINAL">Two</name> live<name type="GPE">ri</name>es <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> noticed, <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ked by the Red <name type="PRODUCT">Eye</name>, the other by a <name type="PERSON">Moon</name> disfigured with a ghastly face of death; but he did not stop to look more closely. Across the court a great door at the foot of the <name type="FAC">Tower</name> stood <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> open, and a red light came through; a large orc lay dead upon the threshold. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> sprang over the body and went in; and then he peered about at a loss.</p>
<p>A wide and echoing passage led back from the door towards the mountain-side. It was dimly lit with torches fla<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng in brackets on the walls, but its distant end was lost in gloom. Many doors and openings could be seen on this side and that; but it was empty save for <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> or <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> more bodies sprawling on the floor. From what he had heard of the captains' talk <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> knew that, dead or alive, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> would most likely be found in a chamber high up in the turret far above; but he might search for <name type="DATE">a <name type="DATE">day</name></name> before he found the way.</p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'It</name>'ll be near the back, I guess,'</q> <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> muttered. `The whole <name type="FAC">Tower</name> climbs backwards-like. And anyway I'd better follow these lights.'</p>
<p>He advanced down the passage, but slowly now, each step more reluctant. Terror was beginning to g<name type="GPE">ri</name>p him again. There was no sound save the rap of his feet, which seemed to grow to an echoing noise, like the slapping of great hands upon the st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s. The dead bodies: the emptiness; the dank black walls that in the torchlight seemed to d<name type="GPE">ri</name>p with blood; the fear of sudden death lurking in doorway or shadow; and behind all his mind the waiting watchful malice at the gate: it was almost more than he could screw himself to face. He would have welcomed a fight-with not too many enemies at a time � rather than this hideous brooding uncertainty. He forced himself to think of <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, lying bound or in pain or dead somewhere in this dreadful place. He went on.</p>
<p>He had passed beyond the torchlight, almost to a great arched door at the end of the passage, the inner side of the under gate, as he <name type="GPE">ri</name>ghtly guessed, when there came from high above a dreadful choking sh<name type="GPE">ri</name>ek. He stopped short. Then he heard feet coming. Some<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> was running in great haste down an echoing stairway overhead.</p>
<p>His will was too weak and slow to restrain his hand. It dragged at the c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>n and clutched the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>. But <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> did not put it on; for even as he clasped it to his breast, an orc came clatte<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng down. Leaping out of a dark opening at the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght, it ran towards him. It was no more than <name type="CARDINAL">six</name> paces from him when, lifting its head, it saw him; and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> could hear its gasping breath and see the glare in its bloodshot eyes. It stopped short aghast. For what it saw was not a small f<name type="GPE">ri</name>gh<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed hobbit trying to hold a steady sword: it saw a great silent shape, cloaked in a grey shadow, looming against the wave<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng light behind; in <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> hand it held a sword, the very light of which was a bitter pain, the other was clutched at its breast, but held concealed some nameless menace of power and doom.</p>
<p>For a moment the orc crouched, and then with a hideous yelp of fear it turned and fled back as it had come. Never was any dog more hear<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed when its enemy turned tail than <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> at this unexpected flight. With a shout he gave chase.</p>
<p>`Yes! The <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name>-war<name type="GPE">ri</name>or is loose!<q>' he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed. 'I'm coming. Just you show me the way up, or I'll skin you!'</q></p>
<p>But the orc was in its own haunts, nimble and well-<name type="ORG">fed</name>. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> was a stranger, hungry and weary. The stairs were high and steep and winding. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>'s breath began to come in gasps. The orc had soon passed out of sight, and now only faintly could be heard the slapping of its feet as it went on and up. Every now and again it gave a yell, and the echo ran along the walls. But slowly all sound of it died away.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> plodded on. He felt that he was on the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght road, and his spi<name type="GPE">ri</name>ts had <name type="GPE">ri</name>sen a good deal. He thrust the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> away and tigh<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed his belt. <name type="ORG">`Well</name>, well!<q>' he said. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>f only they all take such a dislike to me and my <name type="PERSON">Sting</name>, this may turn out better than I hoped. And anyway it looks as if <name type="ORG">Shagrat</name>, <name type="GPE">Gorbag</name>, and company have d<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> nearly all my job for me. Except for that little f<name type="GPE">ri</name>gh<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed rat, I do believe there's nobody left alive in the place!'</q></p>
<p>And with that he stopped, brought up hard, as if he had hit his head against the st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> wall. The full meaning of what he had said struck him like a blow. <name type="ORG">Nob</name>ody left alive! Whose had been that hor<name type="GPE">ri</name>ble dying sh<name type="GPE">ri</name>ek? `<name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>! Master!<q>' he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> sobbing. 'If they've killed you, what shall I do? Well, I'm coming at last, <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght to the top, to see what I must.'</q></p>
<p>Up, up he went. It was dark save for an occasional torch fla<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng at a turn, or beside some opening that led into the higher levels of the <name type="FAC">Tower</name>. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed to count the steps, but after <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name> he lost his reckoning. He was moving quietly now: for he thought that he could hear the sound of voices talking, still some way above. <name type="CARDINAL">More than <name type="CARDINAL">one</name></name> rat remained alive, it seemed.</p>
<p>All at once, when he felt that he could pump out no more breath, nor force his knees to bend again, the stair ended. He stood still. The voices were now loud and near. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> peered about. He had climbed <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght to the flat roof of the <name type="ORDINAL">third</name> and highest tier of the <name type="FAC">Tower</name>: an open space, <name type="QUANTITY">about <name type="CARDINAL">twenty</name> yards</name> across, with a low parapet. There the stair was covered by a small domed chamber in the midst of the roof, with low doors facing east and west. <name type="LOC">East</name>ward <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> could see the plain of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> vast and dark below, and the burning mountain far away. A fresh turmoil was surging in its deep wells, and the <name type="GPE">ri</name>vers of fire blazed so fiercely that even at this distance of many miles the light of them lit the tower-top with a red glare. <name type="LOC">West</name>ward the view was blocked by the base of the great turret that stood at the back of this upper court and reared its horn high above the crest of the encircling <name type="ORG">hill</name>s. Light gleamed in a window-slit. Its door was not <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> yards from where <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> stood. It was open but dark, and from just within its shadow the voices came.</p>
<p>At <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> did not lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>; he took a pace out of the eastward door and looked about. At once he saw that up here the fighting had been fiercest. All the court was choked with dead orcs or their severed and scattered heads and limbs. The place stank of death. A snarl followed by a blow and a cry sent him darting back into hiding. An orc-voice rose in anger, and he knew it again at once, harsh, brutal, cold. It was <name type="ORG">Shagrat</name> speaking, Captain of the <name type="FAC">Tower</name>.</p>
<p>`You won't go again, you say? Curse you, <name type="PERSON">Snaga</name>, you little maggot! If you think I'm so damaged that it's safe to flout me, you're mistaken <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Come</name> here, and I'll squeeze your eyes out, like I did to <name type="PERSON">Radbug</name> just now. And when some new lads come, I'll deal with you: I'll send you to <name type="FAC">Shelob</name>.'</p>
<p>`They won't come, not before you're dead anyway,<q>' answered <name type="PERSON">Snaga</name> surlily. 'I've told you twice that <name type="GPE">Gorbag</name>'s swine got to the gate <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>, and n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of ours got out. <name type="PERSON">Lagduf</name> and <name type="PERSON">Muzgash</name> ran through, but they were shot. I saw it from a window, I tell you. And they were the <name type="DATE">last.</name>'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="ORG">'Then</name> you must go. I must stay here anyway. But I'm hurt. The <name type="ORG">Black</name> Pits take that filthy rebel <name type="GPE">Gorbag</name>!'</q> <name type="ORG">Shagrat</name>'s voice trailed off into a st<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng of foul names and curses. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> gave him better than I got, but he kni<name type="ORG">fed</name> me, the dung, before I throttled him. You must go, or I'll eat you. News must get through to <name type="GPE">Lugb</name>�rz, or we'll both be for the <name type="ORG">Black</name> Pits. Yes, you too. You won't escape by skulking here.'</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`I</name>'m not going down those stairs again,<q>' growled <name type="PERSON">Snaga</name>, `be you captain or no. Nar! Keep your hands off your knife, or I'll put an arrow in your guts. You won't be a captain long when They hear about all these goings-on. I've fought for the <name type="FAC">Tower</name> against those stinking <name type="PERSON">Morgul</name>-rats, but a nice mess you <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> precious captains have made of things, fighting over the swag.'</q></p>
<p><q>'That's enough from you,'</q> snarled <name type="ORG">Shagrat</name>. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> had my orders. It was <name type="GPE">Gorbag</name> started it, trying to pinch that pretty shirt.'</p>
<p><name type="ORG">`Well</name>, you put his back up, being so high and mighty. And he had more sense than you anyway. He told you more than once that the most dangerous of these spies was still loose, and you wouldn't lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>. And you won't lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> now. <name type="GPE">Gorbag</name> was <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght, I tell you. There's a great fighter about, <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of those bloody-handed <name type="ORG">Elves</name>, or <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the filthy _tarks_.*1 He's coming here, I tell you. You heard the bell. He's got past the <name type="PERSON">Watcher</name>s, and that's _tark's_ work. He's on the stairs. And until he's off them, I'm not going down. Not if you were a Nazg�l, I wouldn't.'</p>
<p>`So that's it, is it?<q>' yelled <name type="ORG">Shagrat</name>. 'You'll do this, and you'll not do that? And when he does come, you'll bolt and leave me? No, you won't! I'll put red maggot-holes in your belly <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>.'</q></p>
<p>Out of the turret-door the smaller orc came flying. Behind him came <name type="ORG">Shagrat</name>, a large orc with long arms that, as he ran crou<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g, reached to the ground. But <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> arm hung limp and seemed to be bleeding; the other hugged a large black bundle. In the red glare <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, cowe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng behind the stair-door, caught a glimpse of his evil face as it passed: it was scored as if by rending claws and smeared with blood; slaver d<name type="GPE">ri</name>pped from its protruding fangs; the mouth snarled like an animal.</p>
<p>As far as <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> could see, <name type="ORG">Shagrat</name> hunted <name type="PERSON">Snaga</name> round the roof, until ducking and eluding him the smaller orc with a yelp darted back into the turret and disappeared. Then <name type="ORG">Shagrat</name> halted. Out of the eastward door <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> could see him now by the parapet, panting, his left claw clen<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g and unclen<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g feebly. He put the bundle on the floor and with his <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght claw drew out a long red knife and spat on it. Going to the parapet he leaned over, looking down into the outer court far below. Twice he shouted but no answer came.</p>
<p>Suddenly, as <name type="ORG">Shagrat</name> was stooped over the battlement, his back to the roof-top, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> to his amazement saw that <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the sprawling bodies was moving. It was crawling. It put out a claw and clutched the bundle. It staggered up. In its other hand it held a broad-headed spear with a short broken haft. It was poised for a stabbing thrust. But at that very moment a hiss escaped its teeth, a gasp of pain or hate. Quick as a snake <name type="ORG">Shagrat</name> slipped aside, twisted round, and drove his knife into his enemy's throat.</p>
<p><name type="ORG">`Go</name>t you, <name type="GPE">Gorbag</name>!<q>' he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed. <name type="DATE">'No</name>t quite dead, eh? Well, I'll finish my job now.'</q> He sprang on to <name type="DATE">the fall</name>en body, and stamped and trampled it in his fury, stooping now and again to stab and slash it with his knife. Satisfied at last, he threw back his head and let out a hor<name type="GPE">ri</name>ble gurgling yell of t<name type="GPE">ri</name>umph. Then he licked his knife, and put it between his teeth, and cat<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g up the bundle he came loping towards the near door of the stairs.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> had no time to think. He might have slipped out of the other door, but hardly without being seen; and he could not have played hide-and-seek with this hideous orc for long. He did what was probably the best thing he could have d<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. He sprang out to meet <name type="ORG">Shagrat</name> with a shout. He was no longer holding the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>, but it was there, a hidden power, a cowing menace to the slaves of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>; and in his hand was <name type="PERSON">Sting</name>, and its light smote the eyes of the orc like the glitter of cruel stars in the ter<name type="GPE">ri</name>ble elf-count<name type="GPE">ri</name>es, the dream of which was a cold fear to all his kind. And <name type="ORG">Shagrat</name> could not both fight and keep hold of his treasure. He stopped, growling, ba<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng his fangs. Then once more, orc-fashion, he leapt aside, and as <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> sprang at him, using the heavy bundle as both shield and weapon, he thrust it hard into his enemy's face. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> staggered, and before he could recover, <name type="ORG">Shagrat</name> darted past and down the stairs.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> ran after him, cursing, but he did not go far. Soon the thought of <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> returned to him, and he remembered that the other orc had g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> back into the turret. Here was another dreadful choice, and he had no time to ponder it. If <name type="ORG">Shagrat</name> got away, he would soon get help and come back. But if <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> pursued him, the other orc might do some hor<name type="GPE">ri</name>ble deed up there. And anyway <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> might miss <name type="ORG">Shagrat</name> or be killed by him. He turned quickly and ran back up the stairs. `Wrong again, I expect,<q>' he sighed. `But it's my job to go <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name> the top <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>, whatever happens afterwards.'</q></p>
<p>Away below <name type="ORG">Shagrat</name> went leaping down the stairs and out over the court and through the gate, bea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng his precious burden. If <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> could have seen him and known the g<name type="GPE">ri</name>ef that his escape would b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng, he might have quailed. But now his mind was set on the last stage of his search. He came cautiously to the turret-door and stepped inside. It opened into darkness. But soon his sta<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng eyes were aware of a dim light at his <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght hand. It came from an opening that led to another stairway, dark and narrow: it appeared to go winding up the turret along the inside of its round outer wall. A torch was glimme<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng from somewhere up above.</p>
<p>Softly <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> began to climb. He came to the gutte<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng torch, fixed above a door on his left that faced a window-slit looking out westward: <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the red eyes that he and <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> had seen from down below by the tunnel's mouth. Quickly <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> passed the door and hur<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed on to the <name type="ORG">sec</name>ond storey, dreading at any moment to he attacked and to feel throttling fingers seize his throat from behind. He came next to a window looking east and another torch above the door to a passage through the middle of the turret. The door was open, the passage dark save for the glimmer of the torch and the red glare from outside filte<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng through the window-slit. But here the stair stopped and climbed no further. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> crept into the passage. On either side there was a low door; both were closed and locked. There was no sound at all.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`A</name> dead end,<q>' muttered <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>; `and after all my climb! This can't be the top of the tower. But what can I do now?'</q></p>
<p>He ran back to the lower storey and t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed the door. It would not move. He ran up again, and sweat began to t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ckle down his face. He felt that even <name type="TIME">minutes</name> were precious, but <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> by <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> they escaped; and he could do nothing. He cared no longer for <name type="ORG">Shagrat</name> or <name type="PERSON">Snaga</name> or any other orc that was ever spawned. He longed only for his master, for <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> sight of his face or <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> touch of his hand.</p>
<p>At last, weary and feeling finally defeated, he sat on a step below the level of the passage-floor and bowed his head into his hands. It was quiet, hor<name type="GPE">ri</name>bly quiet. The torch, that was already burning low when he ar<name type="GPE">ri</name>ved, sputtered and went out; and he felt the darkness cover him like a tide. And then softly, to his own surp<name type="GPE">ri</name>se, there at the vain end of his long journey and his g<name type="GPE">ri</name>ef, moved by what thought in his heart he could not tell, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> began to sing.</p>
<p>His voice sounded thin and quave<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng in the cold dark tower: the voice of a forlorn and weary hobbit that no lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing orc could possibly mistake for the clear song of an <name type="ORG">Elven</name>-lord. He murmured old childish tunes out of the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>, and snatches of Mr. <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>'s rhymes that came into his mind like fleeting glimpses of the country of his home. And then suddenly new strength rose in him, and his voice rang out, while words of his own came unbidden to fit the simple tune.</p>
<p>_In western lands beneath the <name type="ORG">Sun</name></p>
<p>the flowers may <name type="GPE">ri</name>se in <name type="DATE">Sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng</name>,</p>
<p>the trees may bud, the waters run,</p>
<p>the merry finches sing.</p>
<p>Or there maybe 'tis cloudless <name type="TIME">night</name></p>
<p>and swaying beeches bear</p>
<p>the <name type="ORG">Elven</name>-stars as jewels white</p>
<p>amid their bran<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g <name type="PERSON">hai</name>r.</p>
<p>Though here at journey's end I lie</p>
<p>in darkness bu<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed deep,</p>
<p>beyond all towers strong and high,</p>
<p>beyond all mountains steep,</p>
<p>above all shadows <name type="GPE">ri</name>des the <name type="ORG">Sun</name></p>
<p>and <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Stars</name> for ever dwell:</p>
<p>I will not say the Day is d<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>,</p>
<p>nor bid the <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Stars</name> farewell._</p>
<p>`Beyond all towers strong and high,' he began again, and then he stopped short. He thought that he had heard a faint voice answe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng him. But now he could hear nothing. Yes, he could hear something, but not a voice. Footsteps were approa<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g. Now a door was being opened quietly in the passage above; the hinges creaked. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> crouched down lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing. The door closed with a dull thud; and then a snarling orc-voice rang out.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Ho</name> la! You up there, you <name type="PERSON">dung<name type="ORG">hill</name></name> rat! Stop your squeaking, or I'll come and deal with you. D'you hear?'</q></p>
<p>There was no answer.</p>
<p><q><name type="PERSON">'All</name> <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght,'</q> growled <name type="PERSON">Snaga</name>. `But I'll come and have a look at you all the same, and see what you're <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name>.'</p>
<p>The hinges creaked again, and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, now pee<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng over the corner of the passage-threshold, saw a flicker of light in an open doorway, and the dim shape of an orc coming out. He seemed to be carrying a ladder. Suddenly the answer <name type="TIME">dawn</name>ed on <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>: the topmost chamber was reached by a trap-door in the roof of the passage. <name type="PERSON">Snaga</name> thrust the ladder upwards, steadied it, and then clambered out of sight. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> heard a bolt drawn back. Then he heard the hideous voice speaking again.</p>
<p>`You lie quiet, or you'll pay for it! You've not got long to live in peace, I guess; but if you don't <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t the fun to begin <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght now, keep your trap shut, see? There's a reminder for you!' There was a sound like the crack of a whip.</p>
<p>At that rage blazed in <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>'s heart to a sudden fury. He sprang up, ran, and went up the ladder like a cat. His head came out in the middle of the floor of a large round chamber. A red lamp hung from its roof; the westward window-slit was high and dark. Something was lying on the floor by the wall under the window, but over it a black orc-shape was straddled. It raised a whip a <name type="ORG">sec</name>ond time, but the blow never fell.</p>
<p>With a cry <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> leapt across the floor, <name type="PERSON">Sting</name> in hand. The orc wheeled round, but before it could make a move <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> slashed its whip-hand from its arm. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>wling with pain and fear but desperate the orc charged head-down at him. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>'s next blow went wide, and thrown off his balance he fell backwards, clut<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g at the orc as it stumbled over him. Before he could scramble up he heard a cry and a thud. The orc in its wild haste had t<name type="GPE">ri</name>pped on the ladder-head and fallen through the open trap-door. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> gave no more thought to it. He ran to the figure huddled on the floor. It was <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.</p>
<p>He was naked, lying as if in a swoon on a heap of filthy rags: his arm was flung up, shielding his head, and across his side there ran an ugly whip-weal.</p>
<p>`<name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>! Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, my dear!<q>' c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, tears almost blinding him. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>t's <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, I've come!'</q> He <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> lifted his master and hugged him to his breast. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> opened his eyes.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`A</name>m I still dreaming?<q>' he muttered. `But the other dreams were hor<name type="GPE">ri</name>ble.'</q></p>
<p>`You're not dreaming at all, Master,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>t's real. It's me. I've come.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`I</name> can hardly believe it,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, clut<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g him. `There was an orc with a whip, and then it turns into <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>! Then I wasn't dreaming after all when I heard that singing down below, and I t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed to answer? Was it you?'</q></p>
<p><name type="DATE">'It</name> was indeed, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. I'd given up hope, almost. I couldn't find you.</p>
<p>Well, you have now, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, dear <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, and he la back in <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>'s gentle arms, closing his eyes, like a child at rest when <name type="TIME">night</name>-fears are d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ven away by some loved voice or hand.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> felt that he could sit like that in endless happiness; but it was not allowed. It was not enough for him to find his master, he had still to try and save him. He kissed <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s forehead. `<name type="WORK_OF_ART">Come</name>! Wake up Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>!' he said, trying to sound as cheerful as he had when he drew back the curtains at <name type="FAC">Bag End</name> on a <name type="DATE">summer</name>'s <name type="TIME">morning</name>.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> sighed and sat up. `Where are we? <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w did I get here?' he asked.</p>
<p><q>'There's no time for tales till we get somewhere else, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. `But you're in the top of that tower you and me saw from away down by the tunnel before the orcs got you. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w <name type="DATE">long ago</name> that was I don't know. <name type="DATE">More than <name type="DATE">a <name type="DATE">day</name></name></name>, I guess.'</p>
<p>`Only that?<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>t seems <name type="DATE">week</name>s. You must tell me all about it, if we get a chance. Something hit me, didn't it? And I fell into darkness and foul dreams, and woke and found that waking was worse. <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s were all round me. I think they had just been pou<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng some hor<name type="GPE">ri</name>ble burning d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk down my throat. My head grew clear, but I was a<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g and weary. They st<name type="GPE">ri</name>pped me of everything; and then <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> great brutes came and questi<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>d me, questi<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>d me until I thought I should go mad, standing over me, gloating, finge<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng their knives. I'll never forget their claws and eyes.'</q></p>
<p>`You won't, if you talk about them, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <name type="PERSON">'And</name> if we don't <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t to see them again, the so<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>r we get going the better. Can you walk?'</q></p>
<p>`Yes, I can walk,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, getting up slowly. 'I am not hurt <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. Only I feel very tired, and I've a pain here.'</q> He put his hand to the back of his neck above his left shoulder. He stood up, and it looked to <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> as if he was clothed in flame: his naked skin was scarlet in the light of the lamp above. Twice he paced across the floor.</p>
<p>`That's better!<q>' he said, his spi<name type="GPE">ri</name>ts <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing a little. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> didn't dare to move when I was left al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, or <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the guards came. Until the yelling and fighting began. The <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> big brutes: they quarrelled, I think. Over me and my things. I lay here ter<name type="GPE">ri</name>fied. And then all went deadly quiet, and that was worse.'</q></p>
<p>`Yes, they quarrelled, seemingly,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. There must have been <name type="CARDINAL">a couple of <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name></name> of the dirty creatures in this place. A bit of a tall order for <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> <name type="PERSON">Gamgee</name>, as you might say. But they've d<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> all the killing of themselves. That's lucky, but it's too long to make a song about, till we're out of here. Now what's to be d<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>? You can't go walking in the <name type="ORG">Black</name> Land in naught but your skin, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.'</q></p>
<p>`They've taken everything, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. `Everything I had. Do you understand? _Everything!_' He cowered on the floor again with bowed head, as his own words brought home to him the fullness of the disaster, and despair overwhelmed him. 'The quest has failed <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. Even if we get out of here, we can't escape. Only <name type="ORG">Elves</name> can escape. Away, away out of <name type="LOC">Middle-<name type="LOC">earth</name></name>, far away over the <name type="LOC">Sea</name>. If even that is wide enough to keep the <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name> out.'</q></p>
<p>`No, _not_ everything, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. And it hasn't failed, not yet. I took it, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, begging your pardon. And I've kept it safe. It's round my neck now, and a ter<name type="GPE">ri</name>ble burden it is, too.<q>' <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> fumbled for the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> and its c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>n. `But I suppose you must take it back.'</q> Now it had come to it, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> felt reluctant to give up the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> and burden his master with it again.</p>
<p>`You've got it?<q>' gasped <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. `You've got it here? <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, you're a <name type="PERSON">mar</name>vel!'</q> Then quickly and strangely his t<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> changed. `Give it to me!<q>' he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed, standing up, holding out a trembling hand. `Give it me at once! You can't have it!'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="PERSON">'All</name> <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, rather startled. <q><name type="CARDINAL">'He</name>re it is!'</q> Slowly he drew the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> out and passed the c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>n over his head. `But you're in the land of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> now, sir; and when you get out, you'll see the <name type="FAC">Fiery <name type="LOC">Mountain</name></name> and all. You'll find the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> very dangerous now, and very hard to bear. If it's too hard a job, I could share it with you, maybe?'</p>
<p>`No, no!<q>' c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, snat<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> and c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>n from <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>'s hands. `No you won't, you thief!'</q> He panted, sta<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng at <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> with eyes wide with fear and enmity. Then suddenly, clasping the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> in <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> clenched fist, he stood aghast. A mist seemed to clear from his eyes, and he passed a hand over his a<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g brow. The hideous vision had seemed so real to him, <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> bemused as he was still with wound and fear. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> had changed before his very eyes into an orc again, lee<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng and pawing at his treasure, a foul little creature with greedy eyes and slobbe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng mouth. But now the vision had passed. There was <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> kneeling before him, his face wrung with pain, as if he had been stabbed in the heart; tears welled from his eyes.</p>
<p><q>'O <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. `What have I said? What have I d<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>? Forgive me! After all you have d<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. It is the hor<name type="GPE">ri</name>ble power of the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>. I wish it had never, never, been found. But don't mind me, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. I must carry the burden to the end. It can't be altered. You can't come between me and this doom.'</p>
<p><q>'That's all <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, rubbing his sleeve across his eyes. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> understand. But I can still help, can't I? I've got to get you out of here. At once, see! But <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> you <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t some clothes and gear and then some food. The clothes will be the easiest part. As we're in <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>, we'd, best dress up <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>-fashion; and anyway there isn't no choice. It'll have to be orc-stuff for you, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, I'm afraid. And for me too. If we go together, we'd best match. Now put this round you!'</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> unclasped his grey cloak and cast it about <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s shoulders. Then unslinging his pack he laid it on the floor. He drew <name type="PERSON">Sting</name> from its sheath. Hardly a flicker was to be seen upon its blade. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> was forgetting this, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>,<q>' he said. `No, they didn't get everything! You lent me <name type="PERSON">Sting</name>, if you remember, and the <name type="PERSON">Lady</name>'s glass. I've got them both still. But lend them to me a little longer, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. I must go and see what I can find. You stay here. Walk about a bit and ease your legs. I shan't be long. I shan't have to go far.'</q></p>
<p>`Take care, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>!<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <name type="PERSON">`A</name>nd be quick! There may be orcs still alive, lurking in wait.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I've got to chance it,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. He stepped to the trap-door and slipped down the ladder. In <name type="TIME">a minute</name> his head reappeared. He threw a long knife on the floor.</p>
<p>`There's something that might be useful,<q>' he said. <name type="CARDINAL">'He</name>'s dead: the <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> that whipped you. Broke his neck, it seems, in his hurry. Now you draw up the ladder, if you can, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>; and don't you let it down till you hear me call the password. _<name type="PERSON">Elbereth</name>_ I'll call. What the <name type="ORG">Elves</name> say. No orc would say that.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> sat for a while and shivered, dreadful fears chasing <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> another through his mind. Then he got up, drew the grey <name type="ORG">elven</name>-cloak about him, and to keep his mind occupied, began to walk to and fro, prying and pee<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng into every corner of his p<name type="GPE">ri</name>son.</p>
<p>It was not very long, though fear made it seem <name type="TIME">an <name type="TIME">hour</name></name> at least, before he heard <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>'s voice calling softly from below: _<name type="PERSON">Elbereth</name>, <name type="PERSON">Elbereth</name>_. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> let down the light ladder. Up came <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, puffing, heaving a great bundle on his head. He let it fall with a thud.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`Quick</name> now. Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>!<q>' he said. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>'ve had a bit of a search to find anything small enough for the likes of us. We'll have to make do. But we must hurry. I've met nothing alive, and I've seen nothing but I'm not easy. I think this place is being watched. I can't explain it, but well: it feels to me as if <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of those foul flying <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s was about, up in the blackness where he can't be seen.'</q></p>
<p>He opened the bundle. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> looked in disgust at the con<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ts, but there was nothing for it: he had to put the things on, or go naked. There were long <name type="PERSON">hai</name>ry breeches of some unclean beast-fell, and a tunic of dirty leather. He drew them on. Over the tunic went a coat of stout <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng-mail, short for a full-sized orc, too long for <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and heavy. About it he clasped a belt, at which there hung a short sheath holding a broad-bladed stabbing-sword. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> had brought several orc-helmets. <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> of them fitted <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> well enough, a black cap with iron <name type="GPE">ri</name>m, and iron hoops covered with leather upon which the evil <name type="PRODUCT">Eye</name> was painted in red above the beaklike nose-guard.</p>
<p>`The <name type="PERSON">Morgul</name>-stuff, <name type="GPE">Gorbag</name>'s gear, was a better fit and better made,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>; `but it wouldn't do, I guess, to go carrying his tokens into <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>, not after this business here. Well, there you are, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. A perfect little orc, if I may make so bold-at least you would be, if we could cover your face with a mask, give you longer arms, and make you bow-legged. This will hide some of the tell-tales.'</q> He put a large black cloak round <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s shoulders. `Now you're ready! You can pick up a shield as we go.'</p>
<p><q>'What about you, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <name type="PERSON">`A</name>ren't we going to match?'</p>
<p><name type="ORG">`Well</name>, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, I've been thinking,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. 'I'd best not leave any of my stuff behind, and we can't destroy it. And I can't wear orc-mail over all my clothes, can I? I'll just have to cover up.'</q></p>
<p>He knelt down and carefully folded his <name type="ORG">elven</name>-cloak. It went into a surp<name type="GPE">ri</name>singly small roll. This he put into his pack that lay on the floor. Standing up, he slung it behind his back, put an orc-helm on his head, and cast another black cloak about his shoulders. `There!<q>' he said. `Now we match, near enough. And now we must be off!'</q></p>
<p><q>'I can't go all the way at a run, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> with a wry smile. <q>'I hope you've made inqui<name type="GPE">ri</name>es about inns along the road? Or have you forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> about food and d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk?'</q></p>
<p>`Save me, but so I had!<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. He whistled in dismay. 'Bless me, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, but you've g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> and made me that hungry and thirsty! I don't know when drop or morsel last passed my lips. I'd forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> it, trying to find you. But let me think! Last time I looked I'd got about enough of that <name type="PERSON">waybread</name>, and of what Captain <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name> gave us, to keep me on my legs for <name type="DATE">a couple of <name type="DATE">week</name>s</name> at a pinch. But if there's a drop left in my bottle, there's no more. That's not going to be enough for <name type="CARDINAL">two</name>, <name type="PERSON">nohow</name>. Don't ores eat, and don't they d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk? Or do they just live on foul air and poison?'</q></p>
<p>`No, they eat and d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. The <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name> that bred them can only mock, it cannot make: not real new things of its own. I don't think it gave life to the ores, it only ruined them and twisted them; and if they are to live at all, they have to live like other living creatures. Foul waters and foul meats they'll take, if they can get no better, but not poison. They've <name type="ORG">fed</name> me, and so I'm better off than you. There must be food and water somewhere in this place.<q>' `But there's no time to look for them,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>.</p>
<p><name type="ORG">`Well</name>, things are a bit better than you think,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. 'I have had a bit of luck while you were away. Indeed they did not take everything. I've found my food-bag among some rags on the floor. They've rummaged it, of course. But I guess they disliked the very look and smell of the _lembas_, worse than <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> did. It's scattered about and some of it is trampled and broken, but I've gathered it together. It's not far short of what you've got. But they've taken <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name>'s food, and they've slashed up my water-bottle.'</q></p>
<p><name type="ORG">`Well</name>, there's no more to be said,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. `We've got enough to start on. But the water's going to be a bad business. But come Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>! Off we go, or a whole lake of it won't do us any good!'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'No</name>t till you've had a mouthful, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> won't budge. Here, take this <name type="ORG">elven</name>-cake, and d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk that last drop in your bottle! The whole thing is quite hopeless, so it's no good worrying about to<name type="DATE">morrow</name>. It probably won't come.'</p>
<p>At last they started. Down the ladder they climbed, and then <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> took it and laid it in the passage beside the huddled body of <name type="DATE">the fall</name>en orc. The stair was dark, but on the roof-top the glare of the <name type="LOC">Mountain</name> could still be seen, though it was dying down now to a sullen red. They picked up <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> shields to complete their disguise and then went on.</p>
<p>Down the great stairway they plodded. The high chamber of the turret behind, where they had met again, seemed almost homely: they were out in the open again now, and terror ran along the walls. All might be dead in the <name type="FAC">Tower</name> of <name type="PERSON">Ci<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name> Ungol, but it was steeped in fear and evil still.</p>
<p>At length they came to the door upon the outer court, and they halted. Even from where they stood they felt the malice of the <name type="PERSON">Watcher</name>s beating on them, black silent shapes on either side of the gate through which the glare of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> dimly showed. As they threaded their way among the hideous bodies of the ores each step became more difficult. Before they even reached the archway they were brought to a stand. To move an inch further was a pain and wea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ness to will and limb.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> had no strength for such a battle. He sank to the ground. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> can't go on, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>,<q>' he murmured. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>'m going to faint. I don't know what's come over me.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`I</name> do, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>ld up now! It's the gate. There's some devilry there. But I got through, and I'm going to get out. It can't be more dangerous than before. Now for it!'</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> drew out the <name type="ORG">elven</name>-glass of <name type="PERSON">Galad<name type="GPE">ri</name>el</name> again. As if to do honour to his <name type="PERSON">hardihood</name>, and to grace with splendour his faithful brown hobbit-hand that had d<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> such deeds, the phial blazed forth suddenly, so that all the shadowy court was lit with a dazzling radiance like lightning; but it remained steady and did not pass.</p>
<p>'_<name type="PERSON">Gilthoniel</name>, A <name type="PERSON">Elbereth</name>!_' <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed. For, why he did not know, his thought sprang back suddenly to the <name type="ORG">Elves</name> in the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>, and the song that drove away the <name type="ORG">Black</name> <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name> in the trees.</p>
<p>'_Aiya elenion ancalima!_' c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> once again behind him.</p>
<p>The will of the <name type="PERSON">Watcher</name>s was broken with a suddenness like the snapping of a cord, and <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> stumbled forward. Then they ran. <name type="PERSON">Thr</name>ough the gate and past the great seated figures with their glitte<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng eyes. There was a crack. The keyst<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the arch crashed almost on their heels, and the wall above crumbled, and fell in ruin. Only by a <name type="PERSON">hai</name>r did they escape. A bell clanged; and from the <name type="PERSON">Watcher</name>s there went up a high and dreadful wail. Far up above in the darkness it was answered. Out of the black sky there came dropping like a bolt a winged shape, rending the clouds with a ghastly sh<name type="GPE">ri</name>ek.</p>
</chapter><chapter num="2"><heading>Chapter 2</heading>
<p>The Land of <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> had just wits enough left to thrust the phial back into his breast. <q>'Run, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>!'</q> he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed. <q><name type="DATE">'No</name>, not that way! There's a sheer drop over the wall. Follow me!'</q></p>
<p>Down the road from the gate they fled. In <name type="CARDINAL">fifty</name> paces, with a swift bend round a jutting bastion of the cliff, it took them out of sight from the <name type="FAC">Tower</name>. They had escaped for the moment. Cowe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng back against the rock they drew breath, and then they clutched at their hearts. Per<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g now on the wall beside the ruined gate the Nazg�l sent out its deadly c<name type="GPE">ri</name>es. All the cliffs echoed.</p>
<p>In terror they stumbled on. Soon the road bent sharply eastward again and exposed them for a dreadful moment to view from the <name type="FAC">Tower</name>. As they flitted across they glanced back and saw the great black shape upon the battlement; then they plunged down between high rock-walls in a cutting that fell steeply to join the <name type="PERSON">Morgul</name>-road. They came to the way-meeting. There was still no sign of orcs, nor of an answer to the cry of the Nazg�l; but they knew that the silence would not last long. At any moment now the hunt would begin.</p>
<p><q>'This won't do, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'If we were real orcs, we ought to be dashing back to the <name type="FAC">Tower</name>, not running away. The <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> enemy we meet will know us. We must get off this road somehow.'</q></p>
<p><q>'But we can't,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, <q>'not without wings.'</q></p>
<p>The eastern faces of the <name type="FAC">Ephel D�ath</name> were sheer, falling in cliff and precipice to the black trough that lay between them and the inner <name type="GPE">ri</name>dge. A short way beyond the way-meeting, after another steep incline, a flying b<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge of st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> leapt over the chasm and bore the road across into the tumbled slopes and <name type="LOC">glen</name>s of the Morgai. With a desperate spurt <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> dashed along the b<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge; but they had hardly reached its further end when they heard the hue and cry begin. Away behind them, now high above on the mountain-side, loomed the <name type="FAC">Tower</name> of <name type="PERSON">Ci<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name> Ungol, its st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s glowing dully. Suddenly its harsh bell clanged again, and then broke into a shatte<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng peal. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>rns sounded. And now from beyond the b<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge-end came answe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng c<name type="GPE">ri</name>es. Down in the dark trough, cut off from the dying glare of <name type="LOC">Orodruin</name>, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> could not see ahead, but already they heard the tramp of iron-shod feet, and upon the road there rang the swift clatter of hoofs.</p>
<p><q>'Quick, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>! Over we go!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. They scrambled on to the low parapet of the b<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge. Fortunately there was no longer any dreadful drop into the <name type="LOC">gulf</name>, for the slopes of the Morgai had already <name type="GPE">ri</name>sen almost to the level of the road; but it was too dark for them to guess the depth of <name type="DATE">the fall</name>.</p>
<p><q>'Well, here goes, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <q><name type="CARDINAL">'Go</name>od-bye!'</q></p>
<p>He let go. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> followed. And even as they fell they heard the rush of horsemen sweeping over the b<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge and the rattle of orc-feet running up behind. But <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> would have laughed, if he had dared. <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>f fea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng a breaking plunge down on to unseen rocks the hobbits landed, in a drop of no more than <name type="CARDINAL">a <name type="CARDINAL">dozen</name></name> feet, with a thud and a crunch into the last thing that they had expected: a tangle of thorny <name type="PERSON">bush</name>es. There <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> lay still, softly sucking a scratched hand.</p>
<p>When the sound of hoof and foot had passed he ventured a whisper. <q>'Bless me, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, but I didn't know as anything grew in <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>! But if I had <name type="PERSON">a'known</name>, this is just what I'd have looked for. These thorns must be a foot long by the feel of them; they've stuck through everything I've got on. Wish I'd a'put that mail-shirt on!'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>-mail doesn't keep these thorns out,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q><name type="DATE">'No</name>t even a leather jerkin is any good.'</q></p>
<p>They had a struggle to get out of the thicket. The thorns and b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ars were as tough as wire and as clinging as claws. Their cloaks were rent and tattered before they broke free at <name type="DATE">last.</name></p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'No</name>w down we go, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>,'</q> <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> whispered. <q>'Down into the valley quick, and then turn northward, as soon as ever we can.'</q></p>
<p>Day was coming again in the world outside, and far beyond the glooms of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> the <name type="ORG">Sun</name> was climbing over the eastern <name type="GPE">ri</name>m of <name type="LOC">Middle-<name type="LOC">earth</name></name>; but here all was still dark as <name type="TIME">night</name>. The <name type="LOC">Mountain</name> smouldered and its fires went out. The glare faded from the cliffs. The easterly wind that had been blowing ever since they left <name type="ORG">Ithil</name>ien now seemed dead. Slowly and painfully they clambered down, groping, stumbling, scrambling among rock and b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ar and dead wood in the blind shadows, down and down until they could go no further.</p>
<p>At length they stopped, and sat side by side, their backs against a boulder. Both were sweating. <q>'If <name type="ORG">Shagrat</name> himself was to offer me a glass of water, I'd shake his hand,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>.</p>
<p><q>'Don't say such things!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q><name type="DATE">'It</name> only makes it worse.'</q> Then he stretched himself out, dizzy and weary, and he spoke no more for a while. At last with a struggle he got up again. To his amazement he found that <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> was asleep. <q>'Wake up, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>!'</q> he said. <q><name type="WORK_OF_ART">'<name type="WORK_OF_ART">Come</name></name> on! It's time we made another effort.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> scrambled to his feet. <q>'Well I never!'</q> he said. <q>'I must have dropped off. It's a long time, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, since I had a proper sleep, and my eyes just closed down on their own.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> now led the way, northward as near as he could guess, among the st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s and boulders lying thick at the bot<name type="PERSON">tom</name> of the great ravine. But presently he stopped again.</p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'It</name>'s no good, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>,'</q> he said. <q>'I can't manage it. This mail-shirt, I mean. Not in my present state. Even my <name type="PERSON">mith<name type="GPE">ri</name>l</name>-coat seemed heavy when I was tired. This is far heavier. And what's the use of it? We shan't win through by fighting.'</q></p>
<p><q>'But we may have some to do,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <q><name type="PERSON">'And</name> there's knives and stray arrows. That <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> isn't dead, for <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> thing. I don't like to think of you with naught but a bit of leather between you and a stab in the dark.'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok here, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> dear lad,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>: <q>'I am tired, weary, I haven't a hope left. But I have to go on trying to get to the <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>, as long as I can move. The <name type="ORG">Ring</name> is enough. This extra w<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name> is killing me. It must go. But don't think I'm ungrateful. I hate to think of the foul work you must have had among the bodies to find it for me.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Don't talk about it, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. Bless you! I'd carry you on my back, if I could. Let it go then!'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> laid aside his cloak and took off the orc-mail and flung it away. He shivered a little. <q>'What I really need is something warm,'</q> he said. <q><name type="DATE">'It</name>'s g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> cold, or else I've caught a c<name type="ORG">hill</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q>'You can have my cloak, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. He unslung his pack and took out the <name type="ORG">elven</name>-cloak. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w's this, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>?'</q> he said. <q>'You wrap that orc-rag close round you, and put the belt outside it. Then this can go over all. It don't look quite orc-fashion, but it'll keep you warmer; and I daresay it'll keep you from harm better than any other gear. It was made by the <name type="PERSON">Lady</name>.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> took the cloak and fas<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed the brooch. <q>'That's better!'</q> he said. <q>'I feel much lighter. I can go on now. But this blind dark seems to be getting into my heart. As I lay in p<name type="GPE">ri</name>son, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. I t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed to remember the <name type="ORG">Brand</name>ywine, and <name type="PERSON">Wood</name>y End, and The Water running through the mill at <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbiton. But I can't see them now.'</q></p>
<p><q>'There now, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, it's you that's talking of water this time!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <q>'If only the <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> could see us or hear us, I'd say to her: Your <name type="PERSON">Lady</name>ship, all we <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t is light and water: just clean water and plain <name type="DATE">day</name>light, better than any jewels, begging your pardon. But it's a long way to L�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en.'</q> <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> sighed and waved his hand towards the h<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name>s of the <name type="FAC">Ephel D�ath</name>, now only to be guessed as a deeper blackness against the black sky.</p>
<p>They started off again. They had not g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> far when <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> paused. <q>'There's a <name type="ORG">Black</name> <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name> over us,'</q> he said. <q>'I can feel it. We had better keep still for a while.'</q></p>
<p>Crouched under a great boulder they sat facing back westward and did not speak for some time. Then <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> breathed a sigh of relief. <q><name type="DATE">'It</name>'s passed,'</q> he said. They stood up, and then they both stared in wonder. Away to their left, southward, against a sky that was turning grey, the peaks and high <name type="GPE">ri</name>dges of the great range began to appear dark and black, visible shapes. Light was growing behind them. Slowly it crept towards the <name type="LOC">North</name>. There was battle far above in the high spaces of the air. The billowing clouds of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> were being d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ven back, their edges tatte<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng as a wind out of the living world came up and swept the fumes and smokes towards the dark land of their home. Under the lifting skirts of the dreary canopy dim light leaked into <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> like pale <name type="TIME">morning</name> through the g<name type="GPE">ri</name>med window of a p<name type="GPE">ri</name>son.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok at it, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok at it! The wind's changed. Something's happening. He's not having it all his own way. His darkness is breaking up out in the world there. I wish I could see what is going on!'</q></p>
<p>It was the <name type="TIME">morning</name> of the <name type="CARDINAL">fifteen</name>th of <name type="DATE">March</name>, and over the Vale of <name type="GPE">Anduin</name> the <name type="ORG">Sun</name> was <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing above the eastern shadow, and the south-west wind was blowing. Th�oden lay dying on the <name type="ORG">Pelennor</name> Fields.</p>
<p>As <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> stood and gazed, the <name type="GPE">ri</name>m of light spread all along the line of the <name type="FAC">Ephel D�ath</name>, and then they saw a shape, moving at a great speed out of the <name type="LOC">West</name>, at <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> only a black speck against the glimme<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng st<name type="GPE">ri</name>p above the mountain-tops, but growing, until it plunged like a bolt into the dark canopy and passed high above them. As it went it sent out a long sh<name type="GPE">ri</name>ll cry, the voice of a Nazg�l; but this cry no longer held any terror for them: it was a cry of woe and dismay, ill tidings for the Dark <name type="FAC">Tower</name>. The <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd of the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>-wraiths had met his doom.</p>
<p><q>'What did I tell you? Something's happening!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>.<q>' The war's going well, said <name type="ORG">Shagrat</name>; but <name type="GPE">Gorbag</name> he wasn't so sure. And he was <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght there too. Things are looking up, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <name type="GPE">Haven</name>'t you got some hope now?'</q></p>
<p><q>'Well no, not much, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>,'</q> <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> sighed. <q>'That's away beyond the mountains. We're going east not west. And I'm so tired. And the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> is so heavy, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. And I begin to see it in my mind all the time, like a great wheel of fire.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name>'s quick spi<name type="GPE">ri</name>ts sank again at once. He looked at his master anxiously, and he took his hand. <q><name type="WORK_OF_ART">'<name type="WORK_OF_ART">Come</name></name>, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>!'</q> he said. <q>'I've got <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> thing I <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ted: a bit of light. Enough to help us, and yet I guess it's dangerous too. Try a bit further, and then we'll lie close and have a rest. But take a morsel to eat now, a bit of the <name type="ORG">Elves</name>' food; it may hear<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> you.'</q></p>
<p>Sha<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng a wafer of _lembas_, and mun<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g it as best they could with their parched mouths. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> plodded on. The light, though no more than a grey <name type="TIME">dusk</name>, was now enough for them to see that they were deep in the valley between the mountains. It sloped up gently northward, and at its bot<name type="PERSON">tom</name> went the bed of a now dry and withered stream. Beyond its stony course they saw a bea<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> path that wound its way under the feet of the westward cliffs. Had they known, they could have reached it quicker, for it was a track that left the main <name type="PERSON">Morgul</name>-road at the western b<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge-end and went down by a long stair cut in the rock to the valley's bot<name type="PERSON">tom</name>. It was used by patrols or by messengers going swiftly to lesser posts and strongholds north-away, between <name type="PERSON">Ci<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name> Ungol and the narrows of <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>mouthe, the iron jaws of <name type="PERSON">Carach Angren</name>.</p>
<p>It was pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>lous for the hobbits to use such a path, but they needed speed, and <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> felt that he could not face the toil of scrambling among the boulders or in the trackless <name type="LOC">glen</name>s of the Morgai. And he judged that northward was, maybe, the way that their hunters would least expect them to take. The road east to the plain, or the pass back westward, those they would <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> search most thoroughly. Only when he was well north of the <name type="FAC">Tower</name> did he mean to turn and seek for some way to take him east, east on the last desperate stage of his journey. So now they crossed the stony bed and took to the orc-path, and for some time they <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ched along it. The cliffs at their left were overhung, and they could not be seen from above; but the path made many bends, and at each bend they g<name type="GPE">ri</name>pped their sword-hilts and went forward cautiously.</p>
<p>The light grew no stronger, for <name type="LOC">Orodruin</name> was still bel<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g forth a great fume that, bea<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> upwards by the opposing airs, mounted higher and higher, until it reached a region above the wind and spread in an immeasurable roof, whose central pillar rose out of the shadows beyond their view. They had trudged for more than <name type="TIME">an <name type="TIME">hour</name></name> when they heard a sound that brought them to a halt. Unbelievable, but unmistakable. Water t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ckling. Out of a gully on the left, so sharp and narrow that it looked as if the black cliff had been cloven by some huge axe, water came d<name type="GPE">ri</name>pping down: the last remains, maybe, of some sweet rain gathered from sunlit seas, but ill-fated to fall at last upon the walls of the <name type="ORG">Black</name> Land and <name type="PERSON">wan</name>der fruitless down into the dust. Here it came out of the rock in a little falling streamlet, and flowed across the path, and turning south ran away swiftly to be lost among the dead st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> sprang towards it. <q>'If ever I see the <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> again, I will tell her!'</q> he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed. <q>'Light and now water!'</q> Then he stopped. <q>'Let me d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>,'</q> he said.</p>
<p><q><name type="PERSON">'All</name> <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght, but there's room enough for <name type="CARDINAL">two</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I didn't mean that,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <q>'I mean: if it's poisonous, or something that will show its badness quick, well, better me than you, master, if you understand me.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I do. But I think we'll trust our luck together, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>; or our blessing. Still, be careful now, if it's very cold!'</q></p>
<p>The water was cool but not icy, and it had an unpleasant taste, at once bitter and oily, or so they would have said at home. Here it seemed beyond all praise, and beyond fear or prudence. They drank their fill, and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> replenished his water-bottle. After that <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> felt easier, and they went on for <name type="QUANTITY">several miles</name>, until the broadening of the road and the beginnings of a rough wall along its edge warned them that they were drawing near to another orc-hold.</p>
<p><q>'This is where we turn aside, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q><name type="PERSON">'And</name> we must turn east.'</q> He sighed as he looked at the gloomy <name type="GPE">ri</name>dges across the valley. <q>'I have just about enough strength left to find some hole away up there. And then I must rest a little.'</q></p>
<p>The <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver-bed was now some way below the path. They scrambled down to it, and began to cross it. To their surp<name type="GPE">ri</name>se they came upon dark pools <name type="ORG">fed</name> by threads of water t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ckling down from some source higher up the valley. Upon its outer <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ges under the westward mountains <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> was a dying land, but it was not yet dead. And here things still grew, harsh, twisted, bitter, struggling for life. In the <name type="LOC">glen</name>s of the Morgai on the other side of the valley low scrubby trees lurked and clung, coarse grey grass-tussocks fought with the st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s, and withered mosses crawled on them; and everywhere great w<name type="GPE">ri</name>thing, tangled brambles sprawled. Some had long stabbing thorns, some hooked barbs that rent like knives. The sullen sh<name type="GPE">ri</name>velled leaves of <name type="DATE">a past <name type="DATE">year</name></name> hung on them, grating and rattling in the sad airs, but their maggot-<name type="GPE">ri</name>dden buds were only just opening. Flies, dun or grey, or black, <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ked like ores with a red eye-shaped blotch, buzzed and stung; and above the b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ar-thickets clouds of hungry midges danced and reeled.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>-gear's no good,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, waving his arms. <q>'I wish I'd got an orc's hide!'</q></p>
<p>At last <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> could go no further. They had climbed up a narrow shelving ravine, but they still had a long way to go before they could even come in sight of the last craggy <name type="GPE">ri</name>dge. <q>'I must rest now, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, and sleep if I can.'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. He looked about, but there seemed nowhere even for an animal to crawl into in this dismal country. At length, tired out, they slunk under a curtain of brambles that hung down like a mat over a low rock-face.</p>
<p>There they sat and made such a meal as they could. Keeping back the precious _lembas_ for the evil <name type="DATE">day</name>s ahead, they ate the <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> of what remained in <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>'s bag of <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name>'s provision: some d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed fruit, and a small slip of cured meat; and they sipped some water. They had drunk again from the pools in the valley, but they were very, thirsty again. There was a bitter tang in the air of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> that d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed the mouth. When <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> thought of water even his hopeful spi<name type="GPE">ri</name>t quailed. Beyond the Morgai there was the dreadful plain of <name type="PERSON">Gorgoroth</name> to cross.</p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'No</name>w you go to sleep <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>,'</q> he said. <q><name type="DATE">'It</name>'s getting dark again. I reckon this <name type="DATE">day</name> is nearly over.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> sighed and was asleep almost before the words were spoken. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> struggled with his own wea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ness, and he took <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s hand; and there he sat silent till <name type="TIME">deep <name type="TIME">night</name></name> fell. Then at last, to keep himself awake, he crawled from the hiding-place and looked out. The land seemed full of creaking and cracking and sly noises, but there was no sound of voice or of foot. Far above the <name type="FAC">Ephel D�ath</name> in the <name type="LOC">West</name> the <name type="TIME">night</name>-sky was still dim and pale. There, peeping among the cloud-wrack above a dark tor high up in the mountains, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> saw a white star twinkle for a while. The beauty of it smote his heart, as he looked up out of the forsaken land, and hope returned to him. For like a shaft, clear and cold, the thought pierced him that in the end the <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name> was only a small and passing thing: there was light and high beauty for ever beyond its reach. His song in the <name type="FAC">Tower</name> had been defiance rather than hope; for then he was thinking of himself. Now, for a moment, his own fate, and even his masters, ceased to trouble him. He crawled back into the brambles and laid himself by <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s side, and putting away all fear he cast himself into a deep untroubled sleep.</p>
<p>They woke together, hand in hand. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> was almost fresh, ready for <name type="DATE">another <name type="DATE">day</name></name>; but <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> sighed. His sleep had been uneasy, full of dreams of fire, and waking brought him no comfort. Still his sleep had not been without all healing virtue: he was stronger, more able to bear his burden <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> stage further. They did not know the time, nor how long they had slept; but after a morsel of food and a sip of water they went on up the ravine, until it ended in a sharp slope of screes and sliding st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s. There the last living things gave up their struggle; the tops of the Morgai were <name type="PERSON">grassless</name>, bare, jagged, barren as a slate.</p>
<p>After much <name type="PERSON">wan</name>de<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng and search they found a way that they could climb, and with <name type="QUANTITY">a last <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name> feet</name> of clawing scramble they were up. They came to a cleft <name type="CARDINAL">between <name type="CARDINAL">two</name></name> dark crags, and passing through found themselves on the very edge of the last <name type="PERSON">fen</name>ce of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>. Below them, at the bot<name type="PERSON">tom</name> of a fall of some <name type="CARDINAL">fifteen</name> <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name> feet, lay the inner plain stret<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g away into a formless gloom beyond their sight. The wind of the world blew now from the <name type="LOC">West</name>, and the great clouds were lifted high, floating away eastward; but still only a grey light came to the dreary fields of <name type="PERSON">Gorgoroth</name>. There smokes trailed on the ground and lurked in hollows, and fumes leaked from fissures in the <name type="LOC">earth</name>.</p>
<p>Still far away, <name type="CARDINAL">forty</name> miles at least, they saw <name type="LOC">Mount Doom</name>, its feet founded in ashen ruin, its huge c<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing to a great h<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name>, where its <name type="GPE">reek</name>ing head was swathed in cloud. Its fires were now dimmed, and it stood in smoulde<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng slumber, as threa<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing and dangerous as a sleeping beast. Behind it there hung a vast shadow, ominous as a thunder-cloud, the veils of <name type="FAC">Barad-d</name>�r that was reared far way upon a long spur of the Ashen <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s thrust down from the <name type="LOC">North</name>. The Dark <name type="ORG">Power</name> was deep in thought, and the <name type="PRODUCT">Eye</name> turned inward, ponde<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng tidings of doubt and danger: a b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght sword, and a stern and kingly face it saw, and for a while it gave little thought to other things; and all its great stronghold, gate on gate, and tower on tower, was wrapped in a brooding gloom.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> gazed out in mingled loathing and wonder on this hateful land. Between them and the smoking mountain, and about it north and south, all seemed ruinous and dead, a desert burned and choked. They wondered how the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd of this realm maintained and <name type="ORG">fed</name> his slaves and his armies. Yet armies he had. As far as their eyes could reach, along the skirts of the Morgai and away southward, there were camps, some of <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ts, some ordered like small towns. <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> of the largest of these was <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght below them. Barely <name type="QUANTITY">a mile</name> out into the plain it clustered like some huge nest of in<name type="ORG">sec</name>ts, with straight dreary streets of huts and long low drab buildings. About it the ground was busy with folk going to and fro; a wide road ran from it south-east to join the <name type="PERSON">Morgul</name>-way, and along it many lines of small black shapes were hurrying.</p>
<p><q>'I don't like the look of things at all,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <q>'Pretty hopeless, I call it � saving that where there's such a lot of folk there must be wells or water, not to mention food. And these are <name type="ORG">Men</name> not <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s, or my eyes are all wrong.'</q></p>
<p>Neither he nor <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> knew anything of the great slave-worked fields away south in this wide realm, beyond the fumes of the <name type="LOC">Mountain</name> by the dark sad waters of <name type="LOC">Lake N</name>�rnen; nor of the great roads that ran away east and south to t<name type="GPE">ri</name>butary lands, from which the soldiers of the <name type="FAC">Tower</name> brought long waggon-trains of goods and booty and fresh slaves. Here in the northward regions were the mines and forges, and the muste<name type="GPE">ri</name>ngs of long-planned war; and here the Dark <name type="ORG">Power</name>, moving its armies like pieces on the board, was gathe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng them together. Its <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> moves, the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> feelers of its strength, had been checked upon its western line, southward and northward. For the moment it withdrew them, and brought up new forces, massing them about <name type="PERSON">Ci<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name> Gorgor for an avenging stroke. And if it had also been its purpose to de<name type="PERSON">fen</name>d the <name type="LOC">Mountain</name> against all approach, it could scarcely have d<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> more.</p>
<p><q>'Well!'</q> <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> went on. <q>'Whatever they have to eat and d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk, we can't get it. There's no way down that I can see. And we couldn't cross all that open country crawling with enemies, even if we did get down.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Still we shall have to try,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q><name type="DATE">'It</name>'s no worse than I expected. I never hoped to get across. I can't see any hope of it now. But I've still got to do the best I can. At present that is to avoid being captured as long as possible. So we must still go northwards, I think, and see what it is like where the open plain is narrower.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I guess what it'll be like,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <q>'Where it's narrower the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s and <name type="ORG">Men</name> will just be packed closer. You'll see, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I dare say I shall, if we ever get so far,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and turned away.</p>
<p>They soon found that it was impossible to make their way along the crest of the Morgai, or anywhere along its higher levels, pathless as they were and scored with deep <name type="ORG">ghylls</name>. In the end they were forced to go back down the ravine that they had climbed and seek for a way along the valley. It was rough going, for they dared not cross over to the path on the westward side. After <name type="QUANTITY">a mile</name> or more they saw, huddled in a hollow at the cliff's foot, the orc-hold that they had guessed was near at hand: a wall and a cluster of st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> huts set about the dark mouth of a cave. There was no movement to be seen, but the hobbits crept by cautiously, keeping as much as they could to the thorn-brakes that grew thickly at this point along both sides of the old water-course.</p>
<p>They went <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> or <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> miles further, and the orc-hold was hidden from sight behind them; but they had hardly begun to breathe more freely again when harsh and loud they heard orc-voices. Quickly they slunk out of sight behind a brown and stunted <name type="PERSON">bush</name>. The voices drew nearer. Presently <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> orcs came into view. <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> was clad in ragged brown and was armed with a bow of horn; it was of a small breed, black-skinned, with wide and snuffling nost<name type="GPE">ri</name>ls: evidently a tracker of some kind. The other was a big fighting-orc, like those of <name type="ORG">Shagrat</name>'s company, bea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng the token of the <name type="PRODUCT">Eye</name>. He also had a bow at his back and car<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed a short broad-headed spear. As usual they were quarrelling, and being of different breeds they used the Common <name type="ORG">Speech</name> after their fashion.</p>
<p>Hardly <name type="CARDINAL">twenty</name> paces from where the hobbits lurked the small orc stopped. <q>'Nar!'</q> it snarled. <q>'I'm going home.'</q> It pointed across the valley to the orc-hold. <q><name type="DATE">'No</name> good wea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng my nose out on st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s any more. There's not a trace left, I say. I've lost the scent through giving way to you. It went up into the <name type="ORG">hill</name>s, not along the valley, I tell you.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'No</name>t much use are you, you little snufflers?'</q> said the big orc. <q>'I reckon eyes are better than your snotty noses.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="ORG">'Then</name> what have you seen with them?'</q> snarled the other. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Garn</name>! You don't even know what you're looking for.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="CARDINAL">'Who</name>se blame's that?'</q> said the soldier. <q><name type="DATE">'No</name>t mine. That comes from Higher Up. <name type="ORDINAL">First</name> they say it's a great <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name> in b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght armour, then it's a sort of small dwarf-man, then it must be a pack of rebel <name type="PERSON">Uruk-<name type="PERSON">hai</name></name>; or maybe it's all the lot together.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Ar!'</q> said the tracker. <q>'They've lost their heads, that's what it is. And some of the bosses are going to lose their skins too, I guess, if what I hear is true: <name type="FAC">Tower</name> raided and all, and <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name>s of your lads d<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> in, and p<name type="GPE">ri</name>s<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>r got away. If that's the way you fighters go on, small wonder there's bad news from the battles.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="CARDINAL">'Who</name> says there's bad news?'</q> shouted the soldier.</p>
<p><q>'Ar! Who says there isn't?'</q></p>
<p><q>'That's cursed rebel-talk, and I'll stick you, if you don't shut it down, see?'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="PERSON">'All</name> <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght, all <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght!'</q> said the tracker. <q>'I'll say no more and go on thinking. But what's the black sneak got to do with it all? That gobbler with the flapping hands?'</q></p>
<p><q>'I don't know. Nothing, maybe. But he's <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name> no good, nosing around, I'll wager. Curse him! No so<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>r had he slipped us and run off than word came he's <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ted alive, <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ted quick.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Well, I hope they get him and put him through it,'</q> growled the tracker. <q><name type="CARDINAL">'He</name> messed up the scent back there, pin<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g that cast-off mail-shirt that he found, and paddling all round the place before I could get there.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'It</name> saved his life anyhow,'</q> said the soldier. <q>'Why, before I knew he was <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ted I shot him, as neat as neat, at <name type="CARDINAL">fifty</name> paces <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght in the back; but he ran on.'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Garn</name>! You missed him,'</q> said the tracker. <q>'<name type="ORDINAL">First</name> you shoot wild, then you run too slow, and then you send for the poor trackers. I've had enough of you.'</q> He loped off.</p>
<p><q>'You come back,'</q> shouted the soldier, <q>'or I'll report you!'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="CARDINAL">'Who</name> to? Not to your precious <name type="ORG">Shagrat</name>. He won't be captain any more.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I'll give your name and number to the Nazg�l,'</q> said the soldier lowe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng his voice to a hiss. <q><name type="CARDINAL">'<name type="CARDINAL">One</name></name> of _them_'s in charge at the <name type="FAC">Tower</name> now.'</q></p>
<p>The other halted, and his voice was full of fear and rage. <q>'You cursed pea<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g sneakthief!'</q> he yelled. <q>'You can't do your job, and you can't even stick by your own folk. Go to your filthy <name type="PERSON">Sh<name type="GPE">ri</name>ekers</name>, and may they freeze the flesh off you! If the enemy doesn't get them <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>. They've d<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> in Number <name type="CARDINAL">One</name>, I've heard, and I hope it's true!'</q></p>
<p>The big orc, spear in hand, leapt after him. But the tracker, sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>nging behind a st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, put an arrow in his eye as he ran up, and he fell with a crash. The other ran off across the valley and disappeared.</p>
<p>For a while the hobbits sat in silence. At length <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> stirred. <q>'Well I call that neat as neat,'</q> he said. <q>'If this nice f<name type="GPE">ri</name>endliness would spread about in <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>, <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> our trouble would be over.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Quietly, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>,'</q> <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> whispered. <q>'There may be others about. We have evidently had a very narrow escape, and the hunt was hotter on our tracks than we guessed. But that is the spi<name type="GPE">ri</name>t of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>; and it has spread to every corner of it. <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s have always behaved like that, or so all tales say, when they are on their own. But you can't get much hope out of it. They hate us far more, altogether and all the time. If those <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> had seen us, they would have dropped all their quarrel until we were dead.'</q></p>
<p>There was another long silence. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> broke it again, but with a whisper this time. <q>'Did you hear what they said about _that gobbler_, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>? I told you <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> wasn't dead yet, didn't I?'</q></p>
<p><q>'Yes, I remember. And I wondered how you knew,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'Well come now! I think we had better not move out from here again, until it has g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> quite dark. So you shall tell me how you know, and all about what happened. If you can do it quietly.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I'll try,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, <q>'but when I think of that <name type="PERSON">Stinker</name> I get so hot I could shout.'</q></p>
<p>There the hobbits sat under the cover of the thorny <name type="PERSON">bush</name>, while the drear light of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> faded slowly into a deep and starless <name type="TIME">night</name>; and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> spoke into <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s ear all that he could find words for of <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>'s treacherous attack, the horror of <name type="FAC">Shelob</name>, and his own adventures with the orcs. When he had finished, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> said nothing but took <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>'s hand and pressed it. At length he stirred.</p>
<p><q>'Well, I suppose we must be going on again,'</q> he said. <q>'I wonder how long it will be before we really are caught and all the toiling and the slinking will be over, and in vain.'</q> He stood up. <q><name type="DATE">'It</name>'s dark, and we cannot use the <name type="PERSON">Lady</name>'s glass. Keep it safe for me, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. I have nowhere to keep it now, except in my hand, and I shall need both hands in the blind <name type="TIME">night</name>. But <name type="PERSON">Sting</name> I give to you. I have got an orc-blade, but I do not think it will be my part to st<name type="GPE">ri</name>ke any blow again.'</q></p>
<p>It was difficult and dangerous moving in the <name type="TIME">night</name> in the pathless land; but slowly and with much stumbling the <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> hobbits toiled on <name type="TIME">hour</name> by <name type="TIME">hour</name> northward along the eastern edge of the stony valley. When a grey light crept back over the western h<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name>s, long after <name type="DATE">day</name> had opened in the lands beyond, they went into hiding again and slept a little, turn by turn. In his times of waking <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> was busy with thoughts of food. At last when <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> roused himself and spoke of eating and making ready for yet another effort, he asked the question that was troubling him most.</p>
<p><q>'Begging your pardon, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>,'</q> he said, <q>'but have you any notion how far there is still to go?'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'No</name>, not any clear notion, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>,'</q> <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> answered. <q>'In <name type="GPE">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name> before I set out I was shown a map of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> that was made before the Enemy came back here; but I only remember it vaguely. I remember clearest that there was a place in the north where the western range and the northern range send out spurs that nearly meet. That must be <name type="CARDINAL">twenty</name> leagues at least from the b<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge back by the <name type="FAC">Tower</name>. It might be a good point at which to cross. But of course, if we get there, we shall be further than we were from the <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>, <name type="CARDINAL">six</name>ty miles from it, I should think. I guess that we have g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> <name type="CARDINAL">about <name type="CARDINAL">twelve</name></name> leagues north from the b<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge now. Even if all goes well, I could hardly reach the <name type="LOC">Mountain</name> in <name type="DATE">a <name type="DATE">week</name></name>. I am afraid, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, that the burden will get very heavy, and I shall go still slower as we get nearer.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> sighed. <q>'That's just as I feared,'</q> he said. <q>'Well, to say nothing of water, we've got to eat less, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, or else move a bit quicker, at any rate while we're still in this valley. <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> more bite and all the food's ended, save the <name type="ORG">Elves</name>' <name type="PERSON">waybread</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I'll try and be a bit quicker, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, drawing a deep breath. <q><name type="WORK_OF_ART">'<name type="WORK_OF_ART">Come</name></name> on then! Let's start another <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ch!'</q></p>
<p>It was not yet quite dark again. They plodded along, on into the <name type="TIME">night</name>. <name type="TIME">The <name type="TIME">hour</name></name>s passed in a weary stumbling trudge with a few b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ef halts. At the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> hint of grey light under the skirts of the canopy of shadow they hid themselves again in a dark hollow under an overhanging st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>.</p>
<p>Slowly the light grew, until it was clearer than it yet had been. A strong wind from the <name type="LOC">West</name> was now d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ving the fumes of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> from the upper airs. Before long the hobbits could make out the shape of the land for some miles about them. The trough between the mountains and the Morgai had steadily dwindled as it climbed upwards, and the inner <name type="GPE">ri</name>dge was now no more than a shelf in the steep faces of the <name type="FAC">Ephel D�ath</name>; but to the east it fell as sheerly as ever down into <name type="PERSON">Gorgoroth</name>. Ahead the water-course came to an end in broken steps of rock; for out from the main range there sprang a high barren spur, thrusting eastward like a wall. To meet it there stretched out from the grey and misty northern range of <name type="ORG">Ered Lithui</name> a long jutting arm; and between the ends there was a narrow gap: <name type="PERSON">Carach Angren</name>, the <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>mouthe, beyond which lay the deep <name type="GPE">dale</name> of <name type="PERSON">Ud�n.</name> In that <name type="GPE">dale</name> behind the <name type="GPE">Morannon</name> were the tunnels and deep armou<name type="GPE">ri</name>es that the servants of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> had made for the de<name type="PERSON">fen</name>ce of the <name type="ORG">Black</name> <name type="FAC">Gate</name> of their land; and there now their <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd was gathe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng in haste great forces to meet the onslaught of the Captains of the <name type="LOC">West</name>. Upon the out-thrust spurs forts and towers were built, and watch-fires burned; and all across the gap an <name type="LOC">earth</name>-wall had been raised, and a deep trench delved that could be crossed only by a single b<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge.</p>
<p><name type="QUANTITY">A few miles</name> north, high up in the angle where the western spur branched away from the main range, stood the old castle of <name type="GPE">Durthang</name>, now <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the many orc-holds that clustered about the <name type="GPE">dale</name> of <name type="PERSON">Ud�n.</name> A road, already visible in the growing light, came winding down from it, until only <name type="QUANTITY">a mile</name> or <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> from where the hobbits lay it turned east and ran along a shelf cut in the side of the spur, and so went down into the plain, and on to the <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>mouthe.</p>
<p>To the hobbits as they looked out it seemed that all their journey north had been useless. The plain to their <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght was dim and smoky, and they could see there neither camps nor troops moving; but all that region was under the vigilance of the forts of <name type="PERSON">Carach Angren</name>.</p>
<p><q>'We have come to a dead end, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'If we go on, we shall only come <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name> that orc-tower, but the only road to take is that road that comes down from it � unless we go back. We can't climb up westward, or climb down eastward.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="ORG">'Then</name> we must take the road, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <q>'We must take it and chance our luck, if there is any luck in <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>. We might as well give ourselves up as <name type="PERSON">wan</name>der about any more, or try to go back. Our food won't <name type="DATE">last.</name> We've got to make a dash for it!'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="PERSON">'All</name> <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'Lead me! As long as you've got any hope left. Mine is g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. But I can't dash, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. I'll just plod along after you.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Before you start any more plodding, you need sleep and food, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Come</name> and take what you can get of them!'</q></p>
<p>He gave <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> water and an additional wafer of the <name type="PERSON">waybread</name>, and he made a pillow of his cloak for his master's head. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> was too weary to debate the matter, and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> did not tell him that he had drunk the last drop of their water, and ea<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>'s share of the food as well as his own. When <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> was asleep <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> bent over him and lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed to his breathing and scanned his face. It was lined and thin, and yet in sleep it looked con<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>t and unafraid. <q>'Well, here goes, Master!'</q> <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> muttered to himself. <q>'I'll have to leave you for a bit and trust to luck. Water we must have, or we'll get no further.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> crept out, and flitting from st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> to st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> with more than hobbit-care, he went down to the water-course, and then followed it for some way as it climbed north, until he came to the rock-steps where <name type="DATE">long ago</name>, no doubt, its sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng had come gushing down in a little waterfall. All now seemed dry and silent; but refusing to despair <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> stooped and lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed, and to his delight he caught the sound of t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ckling. Clambe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng a few steps up he found a tiny stream of dark water that came out from the <name type="ORG">hill</name>-side and filled a little bare pool, from which again it spilled, and vanished then under the barren st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> tasted the water, and it seemed good enough. Then he drank deeply, refilled the bottle, and turned to go back. At that moment he caught a glimpse of a black form or shadow flitting among the rocks away near <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s hiding-place. Biting back a cry, he leapt down from the sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng and ran, jumping from st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> to st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. It was a wary creature, difficult to see, but <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> had little doubt about it: he longed to get his hands on its neck. But it heard him coming and slipped quickly away. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> thought he saw a last fleeting glimpse of it, pee<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng back over the edge of the eastward precipice, before it ducked and disappeared.</p>
<p><q>'Well, luck did not let me down,'</q> muttered <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, <q>'but that was a near thing! Isn't it enough to have orcs by the thousand without that stinking villain coming nosing round? I wish he had been shot!'</q> He sat down by <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and did not rouse him; but he did not dare to go to sleep himself. At last when he felt his eyes closing and knew that his struggle to keep awake could not go on much longer, he wakened <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> gently.</p>
<p><q>'That <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>'s about again, I'm afraid, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>,'</q> he said. <q>'Leastways, if it wasn't him, then there's <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> of him. I went away to find some water and spied him nosing round just as I turned back. I reckon it isn't safe for us both to sleep together, and begging your pardon, but I can't hold up my lids much longer.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Bless you, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'Lie down and take your proper turn! But I'd rather have <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> than orcs. At any rate he won't give us away to them � not unless he's caught himself.'</q></p>
<p><q>'But he might do a bit of robbery and murder on his own,'</q> growled <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <q>'Keep your eyes open, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>! There's a bottle full of water. D<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk up. We can fill it again when we go on.'</q> With that <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> plunged into sleep.</p>
<p>Light was fading when he woke. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> sat propped against the rock behind, but he had fallen asleep. The water-bottle was empty. There was no sign of <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>-dark had returned, and the watch-fires on the h<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name>s burned fierce and red, when the hobbits set out again on the most dangerous stage of all their journey. They went <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> to the little sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng, and then climbing wa<name type="GPE">ri</name>ly up they came to the road at the point where it swung east towards the <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>mouthe <name type="CARDINAL">twenty</name> miles away. It was not a broad road, and it had no wall or parapet along the edge and as it ran on the sheer drop from its b<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk became deeper and deeper. The hobbits could hear no movements, and after lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing for a while they set off eastward at a steady pace.</p>
<p>After doing <name type="QUANTITY">some <name type="CARDINAL">twelve</name> miles</name>, they halted. A short way back the road had bent a little northward and the stretch that they had passed over was now screened from sight. This proved disastrous. They rested for some <name type="TIME">minutes</name> and then went on; but they had not taken many steps when suddenly in the stillness of the <name type="TIME">night</name> they heard the sound that all along they had <name type="ORG">sec</name>retly dreaded: the noise of <name type="PERSON">mar</name><name type="PERSON">chin</name>g feet. It was still some way behind them, but looking back they could see the twinkle of torches coming round the bend less than <name type="QUANTITY">a mile</name> away, and they were moving fast: too fast for <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> to escape by flight along the road ahead.</p>
<p><q>'I feared it, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'We've trusted to luck, and it has failed us. We're trapped.'</q> He looked wildly up at the frowning wall, where the road-builders of old had cut the rock sheer for many fathoms above their heads. He ran to the other side and looked over the b<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk into a dark pit of gloom. <q>'We're trapped at last!'</q> he said He sank to the ground beneath the wall of rock and bowed his head.</p>
<p><q>'Seems so,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <q>'Well, we can but wait and see.'</q> And with that he sat down beside <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> under the shadow of the cliff.</p>
<p>They did not have to wait long. The orcs were going at a great pace. Those in the foremost files bore torches. On they came, red flames in the dark, swiftly growing. Now <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> too bowed his head, hoping that it would hide his face when the torches reached them; and he set their shields before their knees to hide their feet.</p>
<p><q>'If only they are in a hurry and will let a couple of tired soldiers al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> and pass on!'</q> he thought.</p>
<p>And so it seemed that they would. The leading orcs came loping along, panting, holding their heads down. They were a gang of the smaller breeds being d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ven unwilling to their Dark <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd's wars; all they cared for was to get the <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ch over and escape the whip. Beside them, running up and down the line, went <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> of the large fierce _uruks_, cracking lashes and shouting. File after file passed, and the tell-tale torchlight was already some way ahead. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> held his breath. Now more than <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> the line had g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> by. Then suddenly <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the slave-d<name type="GPE">ri</name>vers spied the <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> figures by the road-side. He flicked a whip at them and yelled: <q>'Hi, you! Get up!'</q> They did not answer, and with a shout he halted the whole company.</p>
<p><q><name type="WORK_OF_ART">'<name type="WORK_OF_ART">Come</name></name> on, you slugs!'</q> he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed. <q>'This is no time for slou<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g.'</q> He took a step towards them, and even in the gloom he recognized the devices on their shields. <q>'Deserting, eh?'</q> he snarled. <q>'Or thinking of it? All your folk should have been inside Ud�n before yester<name type="DATE">day</name> <name type="TIME">evening</name>. You know that. Up you get and fall in, or I'll have your numbers and report you.'</q></p>
<p>They struggled to their feet, and keeping bent, limping like footsore soldiers, they shuffled back towards the rear of the line. <q><name type="DATE">'No</name>, not at the rear!'</q> the slave-d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ver shouted. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Thr</name>ee files up. And stay there, or you'll know it, when I come down the line!'</q> He sent his long whip-lash cracking over their heads; then with another crack and a yell he started the company off again at a b<name type="GPE">ri</name>sk trot.</p>
<p>It was hard enough for poor <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, tired as he was; but for <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> it was a torment, and soon <name type="TIME">a <name type="TIME">night</name></name><name type="PERSON">mar</name>e. He set his teeth and t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed to stop his mind from thinking, and he struggled on. The s<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ch of the sweating orcs about him was stifling, and he began to gasp with thirst. On, on they went, and he bent all his will to draw his breath and to make his legs keep going; and yet to what evil end he toiled and endured he did not dare to think. There was no hope of falling out unseen: Now and again the orc-d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ver fell back and jeered at them.</p>
<p><q>'There now!'</q> he laughed, flicking at their legs. <q>'Where there's a whip there's a will, my slugs. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>ld up! I'd give you a nice freshener now, only you'll get as much lash as your skins will carry when you come in late to your camp. Do you good. Don't you know we're at war?'</q></p>
<p>They had g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> some miles, and the road was at last running down a long slope into the plain, when <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s strength began to give out and his will wavered. He lurched and stumbled. Desperately <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed to help him and hold him up, though he felt that he could himself hardly stay the pace much longer. At any moment now he knew that the end would come: his master would faint or fall, and all would be discovered, and their bitter efforts be in vain. <q>'I'll have that big slave-d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ving devil anyway,'</q> he thought.</p>
<p>Then just as he was putting his hand to the hilt of his sword, there came an unexpected relief. They were out on the plain now and drawing near the entrance to <name type="PERSON">Ud�n.</name> Some way in front of it, before the gate at the b<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge-end, the road from the west converged with others coming from the south, and from <name type="FAC">Barad-d</name>�r. Along all the roads troops were moving; for the Captains of the <name type="LOC">West</name> were advancing and the Dark <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd was speeding his forces north. So it chanced that several companies came together at the road-meeting, in the dark beyond the light of the watch-fires on the wall. At once there was great jostling and cursing as each troop t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed to get <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> to the gate and the ending of their <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ch. Though the d<name type="GPE">ri</name>vers yelled and plied their whips, scuffles broke out and some blades were drawn. A troop of heavy-armed _uruks_ from <name type="FAC">Barad-d</name>�r charged into the <name type="GPE">Durthang</name> line and threw them into confusion.</p>
<p>Dazed as he was with pain and wea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ness, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> woke up, grasped quickly at his chance, and threw himself to the ground, dragging <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> down with him. <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s fell over them, snarling and cursing. Slowly on hand and knee the hobbits crawled away out of the turmoil, until at last unnoticed they dropped over the further edge of the road. It had a high kerb by which troop-leaders could guide themselves in black <name type="TIME">night</name> or fog, and it was banked up some feet above the level of the open land.</p>
<p>They lay still for a while. It was too dark to seek for cover, if indeed there was any to find; but <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> felt that they ought at least to get further away from the highways and out of the range of torch-light.</p>
<p><q><name type="WORK_OF_ART">'<name type="WORK_OF_ART">Come</name></name> on, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>!'</q> he whispered. <q><name type="CARDINAL">'<name type="CARDINAL">One</name></name> more crawl, and then you can lie still.'</q></p>
<p>With a last despai<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng effort <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> raised himself on his hands, and struggled on for maybe <name type="CARDINAL">twenty</name> yards. Then he pitched down into a shallow pit that opened unexpectedly before them, and there he lay like a dead thing.</p>
</chapter><chapter num="3"><heading>Chapter 3</heading>
<p><name type="LOC">Mount Doom</name></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> put his ragged orc-cloak under his master's head, and covered them both with the grey robe of L�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en; and as he did so his thoughts went out to that fair land, and to the <name type="ORG">Elves</name>, and he hoped that the cloth woven by their hands might have some virtue to keep them hidden beyond all hope in this wilderness of fear. He heard the scuffling and c<name type="GPE">ri</name>es die down as the troops passed on through the <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>mouthe. It seemed that in the confusion and the mingling of many companies of va<name type="GPE">ri</name>ous kinds they had not been missed, not yet at any rate.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> took a sip of water, but pressed <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> to d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk, and when his master had recovered a little he gave him a whole wafer of their precious <name type="PERSON">waybread</name> and made him eat it. Then, too worn out even to feel much fear, they stretched themselves out. They slept a little in uneasy fits; for their sweat grew c<name type="ORG">hill</name> on them, and the hard st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s bit them, and they shivered. Out of the north from the <name type="ORG">Black</name> <name type="FAC">Gate</name> through <name type="PERSON">Ci<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name> Gorgor there flowed whispe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng along the ground a thin cold air.</p>
<p>In the <name type="TIME">morning</name> a grey light came again, for in the high regions the <name type="LOC">West</name> Wind still blew, but down on the st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s behind the <name type="PERSON">fen</name>ces of the <name type="ORG">Black</name> Land the air seemed almost dead, c<name type="ORG">hill</name> and yet stifling. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> looked up out of the hollow. The land all about was dreary, flat and drab-hued. On the roads nearby nothing was moving now; but <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> feared the watchful eyes on the wall of the <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>mouthe, no more than a furlong away northward. <name type="LOC">South</name>-eastward, far off like a dark standing shadow. loomed the <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>. Smokes were pou<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng from it and while those that rose into the upper air trailed away eastward, great rolling clouds floated down its sides and spread over the land. <name type="QUANTITY">A few miles</name> to the north-east the foot<name type="ORG">hill</name>s of the Ashen <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s stood like sombre grey ghosts, behind which the misty northern h<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name>s rose like a line of distant cloud hardly darker than the lowe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng sky.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed to guess the distances and to decide what way they ought to take. It looks every step of <name type="CARDINAL">fifty</name> miles,<q>' he muttered gloomily sta<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng at the threa<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing mountain, 'and that'll take <name type="DATE">a <name type="DATE">week</name></name>, if it takes <name type="DATE">a <name type="DATE">day</name></name>, with Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> as he is.'</q> He shook his head, and as he worked things out, slowly a new dark thought grew in his mind. Never for long had hope died in his staunch heart, and always until now he had taken some thought for their return. But the bitter truth came home to him at last: at best their provision would take them to their goal; and when the task was d<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, there they would come to an end, al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, houseless, foodless in the midst of a ter<name type="GPE">ri</name>ble desert. There could be no return.</p>
<p><q><name type="CARDINAL">'So</name> that was the job I felt I had to do when I started,'</q> thought <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>: <q>'to help Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> to the last step and then die with him? Well, if that is the job then I must do it. But I would dearly like to see <name type="PERSON">Bywater</name> again, and <name type="PERSON">Rosie</name> <name type="PERSON">Cotton</name> and her brothers, and the <name type="PERSON">Gaffer</name> and <name type="PERSON">Ma<name type="GPE">ri</name>gold</name> and all. I can't think somehow that <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> would have sent Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> on this errand if there hadn't a' been any hope of his ever coming back at all. Things all went wrong when he went down in <name type="GPE">Mo<name type="GPE">ri</name>a</name>. I wish he hadn't. He would have d<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> something.'</q></p>
<p>But even as hope died in <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, or seemed to die, it was turned to a new strength. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>'s plain hobbit-face grew stern, almost g<name type="GPE">ri</name>m, as the will hardened in him, and he felt through all his limbs a th<name type="GPE">ri</name>ll, as if he was turning into some creature of st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> and steel that neither despair nor wea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ness nor endless barren miles could subdue.</p>
<p>With a new sense of responsibility he brought his eyes back to the ground near at hand, studying the next move. As the light grew a little he saw to his surp<name type="GPE">ri</name>se that what from a distance had seemed wide and featureless flats were in fact all broken and tumbled. Indeed the whole surface of the plains of <name type="PERSON">Gorgoroth</name> was pocked with great holes, as if, while it was still a waste of soft mud, it had been smit<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> with a shower of bolts and huge slingst<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s. The largest of these holes were <name type="GPE">ri</name>mmed with <name type="GPE">ri</name>dges of broken rock, and broad fissures ran out from them in all directions. It was a land in which it would be possible to creep from hiding to hiding, unseen by all but the most watchful eyes: possible at least for <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> who was strong and had no need for speed. For the hungry and worn, who had far to go before life failed, it had an evil look.</p>
<p>Thinking of all these things <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> went back to his master. He had no need to rouse him. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> was lying on his back with eyes open, sta<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng at the cloudy sky. <q>'Well, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, <q>'I've been having a look round and thinking a bit. There's nothing on the roads, and we'd best be getting away while there's a chance. Can you manage it?'</q></p>
<p><q>'I can manage it,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'I must.'</q></p>
<p>Once more they started, crawling from hollow to hollow, flitting behind such cover as they could find, but moving always in a slant towards the foot<name type="ORG">hill</name>s of the northern range. But as they went the most easterly of the roads followed them, until it ran off, hugging the skirts of the mountains, away into a wall of black shadow far ahead. Neither man nor orc now moved along its flat grey stretches; for the Dark <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd had almost completed the movement of his forces, and even in the fastness of his own realm he sought the <name type="ORG">sec</name>recy of <name type="TIME">night</name>, fea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng the winds of the world that had turned against him, tea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng aside his veils, and troubled with tidings of bold spies that had passed through his <name type="PERSON">fen</name>ces.</p>
<p>The hobbits had g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> <name type="QUANTITY">a few weary miles</name> when they halted. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> seemed nearly spent. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> saw that he could not go much further in this fashion, crawling, stooping, now picking a doubtful way very slowly, now hurrying at a stumbling run.</p>
<p><q>'I'm going back on to the road while the light lasts, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>,'</q> he said. <q>'Trust to luck again! It nearly failed us last time, but it didn't quite. A steady pace for <name type="QUANTITY">a few more miles</name>, and then a rest.'</q></p>
<p>He was taking a far greater <name type="GPE">ri</name>sk than he knew; but <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> was too much occupied with his burden and with the struggle in his mind to debate, and almost too hopeless to care. They climbed on to the causeway and trudged along, down the hard cruel road that led to the Dark <name type="FAC">Tower</name> itself. But their luck held, and for the rest of that <name type="DATE">day</name> they met no living or moving thing; and when <name type="TIME">night</name> fell they vanished into the darkness of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>. All the land now brooded as at the coming of a great storm: for the Captains of the <name type="LOC">West</name> had passed the <name type="ORG">Cross</name>-roads and set flames in the deadly fields of Imlad <name type="PERSON">Morgul</name>.</p>
<p>So the desperate journey went on, as the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> went south and the banners of the kings rode north. For the hobbits each <name type="DATE">day</name>, each mile. was more bitter than the <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> before, as their strength lessened and the land became more evil. They met no enemies by <name type="DATE">day</name>. At times by <name type="TIME">night</name>, as they cowered or drowsed uneasily in some hiding beside the road, they heard c<name type="GPE">ri</name>es and the noise of many feet or the swift passing of some cruelly <name type="GPE">ri</name>dden <name type="PERSON">steed</name>. But far worse than all such pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ls was the ever-approa<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g threat that beat upon them as they went: the dreadful menace of the <name type="ORG">Power</name> that waited, brooding in deep thought and sleepless malice behind the dark veil about its <name type="PERSON">Thr</name><name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. Nearer and nearer it drew, looming blacker, like the oncoming of a wall of <name type="TIME">night</name> at the last end of the world.</p>
<p>There came at last a dreadful <name type="TIME">night</name>fall; and even as the Captains of the <name type="LOC">West</name> drew near to the end of the living lands, the <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> <name type="PERSON">wan</name>derers came to <name type="TIME">an <name type="TIME">hour</name></name> of blank despair. <name type="CARDINAL">Four</name> <name type="DATE">day</name>s had passed since they had escaped from the orcs, but the time lay behind them like an ever-darkening dream. All this last <name type="DATE">day</name> <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> had not spoken, but had walked <name type="CARDINAL">half</name>-bowed, of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> stumbling, as if his eyes no longer saw the way before his feet. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> guessed that among all their pains he bore the worst, the growing w<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name> of the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>, a burden on the body and a torment to his mind. Anxiously <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> had noted how his master's left hand would of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> be raised as if to ward on a blow, or to screen his sh<name type="GPE">ri</name>nking eyes from a dreadful <name type="PRODUCT">Eye</name> that sought to look in them. And sometimes his <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght hand would creep to his breast, clut<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g, and then slowly, as the will recovered mastery, it would be withdrawn.</p>
<p>Now as the blackness of <name type="TIME">night</name> returned <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> sat, his head between his knees, his arms hanging wea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ly to the ground where his hands lay feebly twit<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> watched him, till <name type="TIME">night</name> covered them both and hid them from <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> another. He could no longer find any words to say; and he turned to his own dark thoughts. As for himself, though weary and under a shadow of fear, he still had some strength left. The _lembas_ had a virtue without which they would <name type="DATE">long ago</name> have lain down to die. It did not satisfy desire, and at times <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>'s mind was filled with the memo<name type="GPE">ri</name>es of food, and the longing for simple bread and meats. And yet this <name type="PERSON">waybread</name> of the <name type="ORG">Elves</name> had a po<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>cy that increased as travellers relied on it al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> and did not mingle it with other foods. It <name type="ORG">fed</name> the will, and it gave strength to endure, and to master <name type="PERSON">sinew</name> and limb beyond the measure of mortal kind. But now a new decision must be made. They could not follow this road any longer; for it went on eastward into the great <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>, but the <name type="LOC">Mountain</name> now loomed upon their <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght, almost due south, and they must turn towards it. Yet still before it there stretched a wide region of fuming, barren, ash-<name type="GPE">ri</name>dden land.</p>
<p><q>'Water, water!'</q> muttered <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. He had stinted himself, and in his parched mouth his tongue seemed thick and swollen; but for all his care they now had very little left, perhaps <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> his bottle, and maybe there were still <name type="DATE">day</name>s to go. All would <name type="DATE">long ago</name> have been spent, if they had not dared to follow the orc-road. For at long intervals on that highway cisterns had been built for the use of troops sent in haste through the waterless regions. In <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> had found some water left, stale, muddied by the orcs, but still sufficient for their desperate case. Yet that was now <name type="DATE">a <name type="DATE">day</name></name> ago. There was no hope of any more.</p>
<p>At last wea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed with his cares <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> drowsed, leaving the <name type="DATE">morrow</name> till it came; he could do no more. Dream and waking mingled uneasily. He saw lights like gloating yes, and dark creeping shapes, and he heard noises as of wild beasts or the dreadful c<name type="GPE">ri</name>es of tortured things; and he would start <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name> find the world all dark and only empty blackness all about him. Once only, as he stood and stared wildly round, did it seem that, though now awake, he could still see pale lights like eyes; but soon they flickered and vanished.</p>
<p>The hateful <name type="TIME">night</name> passed slowly and reluctantly. Such <name type="DATE">day</name>light as followed was dim; for here as the <name type="LOC">Mountain</name> drew near the air was ever <name type="PERSON">mirky</name>, while out from the Dark <name type="FAC">Tower</name> there crept the veils of <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name> that <name type="ORG">Sauron</name> wove about himself. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> was lying on his back not moving. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> stood beside him, reluctant to speak, and yet knowing that the word now lay with him: he must set his master's will to work for another effort. At length, stooping and caressing <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s brow, he spoke in his ear.</p>
<p><q>'Wake up, Master!'</q> he said. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Tim</name>e for another start.'</q></p>
<p>As if roused by a sudden bell, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> rose quickly, and stood up and looked away southwards; but when his eyes beheld the <name type="LOC">Mountain</name> and the desert he quailed again.</p>
<p><q>'I can't manage it, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>,'</q> he said. <q><name type="DATE">'It</name> is such a w<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name> to carry, such a w<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name>.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> knew before he spoke, that it was vain, and that such words might do more harm than good, but in his pity he could not keep silent. <q><name type="ORG">'Then</name> let me carry it a bit for you, Master,'</q> he said. <q>'You know I would, and gladly, as long as I have any strength.'</q></p>
<p>A wild light came into <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s eyes. <q>'Stand away! Don't touch me!'</q> he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed. <q><name type="DATE">'It</name> is mine, I say. Be off!'</q> His hand strayed to his sword-hilt. But then quickly his voice changed. <q><name type="DATE">'No</name>, no, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>,'</q> he said sadly. <q>'But you must understand. It is my burden, and no <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> else can bear it. It is too late now, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> dear. You can't help me in that way again. I am almost in its power now. I could not give it up, and if you t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed to take it I should go mad.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> nodded. <q>'I understand,'</q> he said. <q>'But I've been thinking, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, there's other things we might do without. Why not ligh<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> the load a bit? We're going that way now, as straight as we can make it.'</q> He pointed to the <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>. <q><name type="DATE">'It</name>'s no good taking anything we're not sure to need.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> looked again towards the <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>. <q><name type="DATE">'No</name>,'</q> he said, <q>'we shan't need much on that road. And at its end nothing.'</q> Picking up his orc-shield he flung it away and threw his helmet after it. Then pulling off the grey cloak he undid the heavy belt and let it fall to the ground, and the sheathed sword with it. The shreds of the black cloak he tore off and scattered.</p>
<p><q>'There, I'll be an orc no more,'</q> he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed, <q>'and I'll bear no weapon fair or foul. Let them take me, if they will!'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> did likewise, and put aside his orc-gear; and he took out all the things in his pack. Somehow each of them had become dear to him, if only because he had borne them so far with so much toil. Hardest of all it was to part with his cooking-gear. Tears welled in his eyes at the thought of casting it away.</p>
<p><q>'Do you remember that bit of rabbit, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>?'</q> he said. <q><name type="PERSON">'And</name> our place under the warm bank in Captain <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name>'s country, the <name type="DATE">day</name> I saw an oliphaunt?'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'No</name>, I am afraid not, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q><name type="CARDINAL">'At</name> least, I know that such things happened, but I cannot see them. No taste of food, no feel of water, no sound of wind, no memory of tree or grass or flower, no image of moon or star are left to me. I am naked in the dark. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, and there is no veil between me and the wheel of fire. I begin to see it even with my waking eyes, and all else fades.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> went to him and kissed his hand. <q><name type="ORG">'Then</name> the so<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>r we're <name type="GPE">ri</name>d of it, the so<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>r to rest,'</q> he said haltingly, finding no better words to say. <q>'Talking won't mend nothing,'</q> he muttered to himself, as he gathered up all the things that they had chosen to cast away. He was not willing to leave them lying open in the wilderness for any eyes to see. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Stinker</name> picked up that orc-shirt, seemingly, and he isn't going to add a sword to it. His hands are bad enough when empty. And he isn't going to mess with my pans!'</q> With that he car<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed all the gear away to <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the many gaping fissures that scored the land and threw them in. The clatter of his precious pans as they fell down into the dark was like a death-knell to his heart.</p>
<p>He came back to <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, and then of his <name type="ORG">elven</name>-rope he cut a short piece to serve his master as a girdle and bind the grey cloak close about his waist. The rest he carefully coiled and put back in his pack. Beside that he kept only the remnants of their <name type="PERSON">waybread</name> and the water-bottle, and <name type="PERSON">Sting</name> still hanging by his belt; and hidden away in a pocket of his tunic next his breast the phial of <name type="PERSON">Galad<name type="GPE">ri</name>el</name> and the little box that she gave him for his own.</p>
<p>Now at last they turned their faces to the <name type="LOC">Mountain</name> and set out, thinking no more of concealment, bending their wea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ness and failing wills only to the <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> task of going on. In the dimness of its dreary <name type="DATE">day</name> few things even in that land of vigilance could have espied them, save from close at hand. Of all the slaves of the Dark <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd, only the Nazg�l could have warned him of the pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>l that crept, small but indomitable, into the very heart of his guarded realm. But the Nazg�l and their black wings were abroad on another errand: they were gathered far away, shadowing the <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ch of the Captains of the <name type="LOC">West</name>, and thither the thought of the Dark <name type="FAC">Tower</name> was turned.</p>
<p><name type="DATE">That <name type="DATE">day</name></name> it seemed to <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> that his master had found some new strength, more than could be explained by the small ligh<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing of the load that he had to carry. In the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ches they went further and faster than he had hoped. The land was rough and hostile, and yet they made much progress, and ever the <name type="LOC">Mountain</name> drew nearer. But as the <name type="DATE">day</name> wore on and all too soon the dim light began to fail, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> stooped again, and began to stagger, as if the renewed effort had squandered his remaining strength.</p>
<p>At their last halt he sank down and said: <q>'I'm thirsty, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>,'</q> and did not speak again. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> gave him a mouthful of water; only <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> more mouthful remained. He went without himself; and now as once more the <name type="TIME">night</name> of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> closed over them, through all his thoughts there came the memory of water; and every brook or stream or fount that he had ever seen, under green willow-shades or twinkling in the sun, danced and <name type="GPE">ri</name>ppled for his torment behind the blindness of his eyes. He felt the cool mud about his toes as he paddled in the Pool at <name type="PERSON">Bywater</name> with Jolly <name type="PERSON">Cotton</name> and <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> and <name type="PERSON">Nibs</name>, and their sister <name type="PERSON">Rosie</name>. <q>'But that was <name type="DATE">year</name>s ago,'</q> he sighed, <q>'and far away. The way back, if there is <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, goes past the <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>.'</q></p>
<p>He could not sleep and he held a debate with himself. <q>'Well, come now, we've d<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> better than you hoped,'</q> he said sturdily. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Began</name> well anyway. I reckon we crossed <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> the distance before we stopped. <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> more <name type="DATE">day</name> will do it.'</q> And then he paused.</p>
<p><q>'Don't be a fool, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> <name type="PERSON">Gamgee</name>,'</q> came an answer in his own voice. <q><name type="CARDINAL">'He</name> won't go <name type="DATE">another <name type="DATE">day</name></name> like that, if he moves at all. And you can't go on much longer giving him all the water and most of the food.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I can go on a good way though, and I will.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Where to?'</q></p>
<p><q>'To the <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>, of course.'</q></p>
<p><q>'But what then, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> <name type="PERSON">Gamgee</name>, what then? When you get there, what are you going to do? He won't be able to do anything for himself.'</q></p>
<p>To his dismay <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> realized that he had not got an answer to this. He had no clear idea at all. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> had not spoken much to him of his errand, and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> only knew vaguely that the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> had somehow to be put into the fire. <q>'The <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Cracks of Doom</name>,'</q> he muttered, the old name <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing to his mind. <q>'Well, if Master knows how to find them, I don't.'</q></p>
<p><q>'There you are!'</q> came the answer. <q><name type="DATE">'It</name>'s all quite useless. He said so himself. You are the fool, going on hoping and toiling. You could have lain down and g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> to sleep together <name type="DATE">day</name>s ago, if you hadn't been so dogged. But you'll die just the same, or worse. You might just as well lie down now and give it up. You'll never get to the top anyway.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I'll get there, if I leave everything but my b<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s behind,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <q><name type="PERSON">'And</name> I'll carry Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> up myself, if it breaks my back and heart. So stop arguing!'</q></p>
<p>At that moment <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> felt a tremor in the ground beneath him, and he heard or sensed a deep remote rumble as of thunder imp<name type="GPE">ri</name>s<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>d under the <name type="LOC">earth</name>. There was a b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ef red flame that flickered under the clouds and died away. The <name type="LOC">Mountain</name> too slept uneasily.</p>
<p>The last stage of their journey to <name type="LOC">Orodruin</name> came, and it was a torment greater than <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> had ever thought that he could bear. He was in pain, and so parched that he could no longer swallow even a mouthful of food. It remained dark, not only because of the smokes of the <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>: there seemed to be a storm coming up, and away to the south-east there was a shimmer of lightnings under the black skies. Worst of all, the air was full of fumes; breathing was painful and difficult, and a dizziness came on them, so that they staggered and of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> fell. And yet their wills did not yield, and they struggled on.</p>
<p>The <name type="LOC">Mountain</name> crept up ever nearer, until, if they lifted their heavy heads, it filled all their sight, looming vast before them: a huge mass of ash and slag and burned st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, out of which a sheer-sided c<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> was raised into the clouds. Before the <name type="DATE">day</name>long <name type="TIME">dusk</name> ended and true <name type="TIME">night</name> came again they had crawled and stumbled to its very feet.</p>
<p>With a gasp <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> cast himself on the ground. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> sat by him. To his surp<name type="GPE">ri</name>se he felt tired but lighter, and his head seemed clear again. No more debates disturbed his mind. He knew all the arguments of despair and would not lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> to them. His will was set, and only death would break it. He felt no longer either desire or need of sleep, but rather of watchfulness. He knew that all the hazards and pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ls were now drawing together to a point: the next <name type="DATE">day</name> would be <name type="DATE">a <name type="DATE">day</name></name> of doom, the <name type="DATE">day</name> of final effort or disaster, the last gasp.</p>
<p>But when would it come? <name type="TIME">The <name type="TIME">night</name></name> seemed endless and timeless, minute after minute falling dead and adding <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name> no passing <name type="TIME">hour</name>, b<name type="GPE">ri</name>nging no change. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> began to wonder if a <name type="ORG">sec</name>ond darkness had begun and no <name type="DATE">day</name> would ever reappear. At last he groped for <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s hand. It was cold and trembling. His master was shive<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng.</p>
<p><q>'I didn't ought to have left my blanket behind,'</q> muttered <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>; and lying down he t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed to comfort <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> with his arms and body. Then sleep took him, and the dim light of the last <name type="DATE">day</name> of their quest found them side by side. The wind had fallen the <name type="DATE">day</name> before as it shifted from the <name type="LOC">West</name>, and now it came from the <name type="LOC">North</name> and began to <name type="GPE">ri</name>se; and slowly the light of the unseen <name type="ORG">Sun</name> filtered down into the shadows where the hobbits lay.</p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'No</name>w for it! Now for the last gasp!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> as he struggled to his feet. He bent over <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, rousing him gently. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> groaned; but with a great effort of will he staggered up; and then he fell upon his knees again. He raised his eyes with difficulty to the dark slopes of <name type="LOC">Mount Doom</name> towe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng above him, and then pitifully he began to crawl forward on his hands.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> looked at him and wept in his heart, but no tears came to his dry and stinging eyes. <q>'I said I'd carry him, if it broke my back,'</q> he muttered, <q>'and I will!'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="WORK_OF_ART">'<name type="WORK_OF_ART">Come</name></name>, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>!'</q> he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed. <q>'I can't carry it for you, but I can carry you and it as well. So up you get! <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Come</name> on, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> dear! <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> will give you a <name type="GPE">ri</name>de. Just tell him where to go, and he'll go.'</q></p>
<p>As <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> clung upon his back, arms loosely about his neck, legs clasped firmly under his arms, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> staggered to his feet; and then to his amazement he felt the burden light. He had feared that he would have barely strength to lift his master al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, and beyond that he had expected to share in the dreadful dragging w<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name> of the accursed <name type="ORG">Ring</name>. But it was not so. Whether because <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> was so worn by his long pains, wound of knife, and venomous sting, and sorrow, fear, and homeless <name type="PERSON">wan</name>de<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng, or because some gift of final strength was given to him, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> lifted <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> with no more difficulty than if he were carrying a hobbit-child pig-a-back in some romp on the lawns or hayfields of the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>. He took a deep breath and started off.</p>
<p>They had reached the <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>'s foot on its northern side, and a little to the westward; there its long grey slopes, though broken, were not sheer. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> did not speak, and so <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> struggled on as best he could, having no guidance but the will to climb as high as might be before his strength gave out and his will broke. On he toiled, up and up, turning this way and that to lessen the slope, of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> stumbling forward, and at the last crawling like a snail with a heavy burden on its back. When his will could d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ve him no further, and his limbs gave way, he stopped and laid his master gently down.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> opened his eyes and drew a breath. It was easier to breathe up here above the <name type="GPE">reek</name>s that coiled and d<name type="GPE">ri</name>fted down below. <q>'Thank you, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>,'</q> he said in a cracked whisper. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w far is there to go?'</q></p>
<p><q>'I don't know,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, <q>'because I don't know where we're going.'</q></p>
<p>He looked back, and then he looked up; and he was amazed to see how far his last effort had brought him. The <name type="LOC">Mountain</name> standing ominous and al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> had looked taller than it was. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> saw now that it was less lofty than the high passes of the <name type="FAC">Ephel D�ath</name> which he and <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> had scaled. The confused and tumbled shoulders of its great base rose for maybe <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> thousand feet above the plain, and above them was reared <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> as high again its tall central c<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, like a vast oast or chimney capped with a jagged crater. But already <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> was more than <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> way up the base, and the plain of <name type="PERSON">Gorgoroth</name> was dim below him, wrapped in fume and shadow. As he looked up he would have given a shout. if his parched throat had allowed him; for amid the rugged humps and shoulders above him he saw plainly a path or road. It climbed like a <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing girdle from the west and wound snakelike about the <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>, until before it went round out of view it reached the foot of the c<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> upon its eastern side.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> could not see the course immediately above him, where it was lowest, for a steep slope went up from where he stood; but he guessed that if he could only struggle on just a little way further up, they would st<name type="GPE">ri</name>ke this path. A gleam of hope returned to him. They might conquer the <name type="LOC">Mountain</name> yet. <q>'Why, it might have been put there a-purpose!'</q> he said to himself. <q>'If it wasn't there, I'd have to say I was bea<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> in the end.'</q></p>
<p>The path was not put there for the purposes of <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. He did not know it, but he was looking at <name type="ORG">Sauron</name>'s <name type="FAC">Road</name> from <name type="FAC">Barad-d</name>�r to the <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>math Naur, the Chambers of <name type="ORG">Fire</name>. Out from the Dark <name type="FAC">Tower</name>'s huge western gate it came over a deep abyss by a vast b<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge of iron, and then passing into the plain it ran for a league <name type="CARDINAL">between <name type="CARDINAL">two</name></name> smoking chasms, and so reached a long sloping causeway that led up on to the <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>'s eastern side. Thence, turning and encircling all its wide girth from south to north, it climbed at last, high in the upper c<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, but still far from the <name type="GPE">reek</name>ing summit, to a dark entrance that gazed back east straight to the Window of the <name type="PRODUCT">Eye</name> in <name type="ORG">Sauron</name>'s shadow-mantled fortress. Of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> blocked or destroyed by the tumults of the <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>'s furnaces, always that road was repaired and cleaned again by the labours of countless orcs.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> drew a deep breath. There was a path, but how he was to get up the slope to it he did not know. <name type="ORDINAL">First</name> he must ease his a<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g back. He lay flat beside <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> for a while. Neither spoke. Slowly the light grew. Suddenly a sense of urgency which he did not understand came to <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. It was almost as if he had been called: <q><name type="DATE">'No</name>w, now, or it will be too late!'</q> He braced himself and got up. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> also seemed to have felt the call. He struggled to his knees.</p>
<p><q>'I'll crawl, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>,'</q> he gasped.</p>
<p>So foot by foot, like small grey in<name type="ORG">sec</name>ts, they crept up the slope. They came to the path and found that it was broad, paved with broken rubble and bea<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> ash. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> clambered on to it, and then moved as if by some compulsion he turned slowly to face the <name type="LOC">East</name>. Far off the shadows of <name type="ORG">Sauron</name> hung; but torn by some gust of wind out of the world, or else moved by some great disquiet within, the mantling clouds swirled, and for a moment drew aside; and then he saw, <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing black, blacker and darker than the vast shades amid which it stood, the cruel pinnacles and iron crown of the topmost tower of <name type="FAC">Barad-d</name>�r. <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> moment only it stared out, but as from some great window immeasurably high there stabbed northward a flame of red, the flicker of a piercing <name type="PRODUCT">Eye</name>; and then the shadows were furled again and the ter<name type="GPE">ri</name>ble vision was removed. The <name type="PRODUCT">Eye</name> was not turned to them: it was gazing north to where the Captains of the <name type="LOC">West</name> stood at bay, and thither all its malice was now bent, as the <name type="ORG">Power</name> moved to st<name type="GPE">ri</name>ke its deadly blow; but <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> at that dreadful glimpse fell as <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> st<name type="GPE">ri</name>cken mortally. His hand sought the c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>n about his neck.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> knelt by him. Faint, almost inaudibly, he heard <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> whispe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng: <q><name type="CARDINAL">'He</name>lp me, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>! Help me, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>! <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>ld my hand! I can't stop it.'</q> <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> took his master's hands and laid them together, palm to palm, and kissed them; and then he held them gently between his own. The thought came suddenly to him: <q><name type="CARDINAL">'He</name>'s spotted us! It's all up, or it soon will be. Now, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> <name type="PERSON">Gamgee</name>, this is the end of ends.'</q></p>
<p>Again he lifted <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and drew his hands down to his own breast. letting his master's legs dangle. Then he bowed his head and struggled off along the climbing road. It was not as easy a way to take as it had looked at <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>. By fortune the fires that had poured forth in the great turmoils when <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> stood upon <name type="PERSON">Ci<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name> Ungol had flowed down mainly on the southern and western slopes, and the road on this side was not blocked. Yet in many places it had crumbled away or was crossed by gaping rents. After climbing eastward for some time it bent back upon itself at a sharp angle and went westward fox a space. There at the bend it was cut deep through a crag of old weathered st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> once <name type="DATE">long ago</name> vomited from the <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>'s furnaces. Panting under his load <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> turned the bend; and even as he did so, out of the corner of his eye, he had a glimpse of something falling from the crag, like a small piece of black st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> that had toppled off as he passed.</p>
<p>A sudden w<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name> smote him and he crashed forward, tea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng the backs of his hands that still clasped his master's. Then he knew what had happened, for above him as he lay he heard a hated voice.</p>
<p><q>'Wicked <name type="PERSON">masster</name>!'</q> it hissed. <q>'Wicked <name type="PERSON">masster</name> cheats us; cheats Sm�agol, _<name type="PERSON">gollum</name>_. He musstn't go that way. He musstn't hurt Preciouss. Give it to Sm�agol, yess, give it to us! Give it to uss!'</q></p>
<p>With a violent heave <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> rose up. At once he drew his sword; but he could do nothing. <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> and <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> were locked together. <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> was tea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng at his master, trying to get at the c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>n and the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>. This was probably the only thing that could have roused the dying embers of <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s heart and will: an attack, an attempt to wrest his treasure from him by force. He fought back with a sudden fury that amazed <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, and <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> also. Even so things might have g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> far otherwise, if <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> himself had remained unchanged; but whatever dreadful paths, l<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>ly and hungry and waterless, he had trodden, d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ven by a devou<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng desire and a ter<name type="GPE">ri</name>ble fear, they had left g<name type="GPE">ri</name>evous <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ks on him. He was a lean, starved, haggard thing, all b<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s and tight-drawn sallow skin. A wild light flamed in his eyes, but his malice was no longer matched by his old g<name type="GPE">ri</name>ping strength. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> flung him off and rose up quive<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng.</p>
<p><q>'Down, down!'</q> he gasped, clut<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g his hand to his breast, so that beneath the cover of his leather shirt he clasped the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>. <q>'Down you creeping thing, and out of my path! Your time is at an end. You cannot betray me or slay me now.'</q></p>
<p>Then suddenly, as before under the eaves of the <name type="ORG">Emyn Muil</name>, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> saw these <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> <name type="GPE">ri</name>vals with other vision. A crou<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g shape, scarcely more than the shadow of a living thing, a creature now wholly ruined and defeated, yet filled with a hideous lust and rage; and before it stood stern, untouchable now by pity, a figure robed in white, but at its breast it held a wheel of fire. Out of the fire there spoke a commanding voice.</p>
<p><q>'Beg<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, and trouble me no more! If you touch me ever again, you shall be cast yourself into the <name type="ORG">Fire</name> of Doom.'</q></p>
<p>The crou<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g shape backed away, terror in its blinking eyes, and yet at the same time insatiable desire.</p>
<p>Then the vision passed and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> saw <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> standing, hand on breast, his breath coming in great gasps, and <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> at his feet, resting on his knees with his wide-splayed hands upon the ground.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok out!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <q><name type="CARDINAL">'He</name>'ll sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng!'</q> He stepped forward, brandishing his sword. <q>'Quick, Master!'</q> he gasped. <q><name type="CARDINAL">'Go</name> on! Go on! No time to lose. I'll deal with him. Go on!'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> looked at him as if at <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> now far away. <q>'Yes, I must go on,'</q> he said. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Farewell</name>, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>! This is the end at <name type="DATE">last.</name> On <name type="LOC">Mount Doom</name> doom shall fall. <name type="PERSON">Farewell</name>!'</q> He turned and went on, walking slowly but erect up the climbing path.</p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'No</name>w!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <q><name type="CARDINAL">'At</name> last I can deal with you!'</q> He leaped forward with drawn blade ready for battle. But <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> did not sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng. He fell flat upon the ground and whimpered.</p>
<p><q>'Don't kill us,'</q> he wept. <q>'Don't hurt us with <name type="ORG">nassty</name> cruel steel! Let us live, yes, live just a little longer. <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>st lost! We're lost. And when Precious goes we'll die, yes, die into the dust.'</q> He clawed up the ashes of the path with his long fleshless fingers. <q>'<name type="NORP">Dusst</name>!'</q> he hissed.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name>'s hand wavered. His mind was hot with wrath and the memory of evil. It would be just to slay this treacherous, murderous creature, just and many times deserved; and also it seemed the only safe thing to do. But deep in his heart there was something that restrained him: he could not st<name type="GPE">ri</name>ke this thing lying in the dust, forlorn, ruinous, utterly wretched. He himself, though only for a little while, had borne the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>, and now dimly he guessed the agony of <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>'s sh<name type="GPE">ri</name>velled mind and body, enslaved to that <name type="ORG">Ring</name>, unable to find peace or relief ever in life again. But <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> had no words to express what he felt.</p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'Oh</name>, curse you, you stinking thing!'</q> he said. <q><name type="CARDINAL">'Go</name> away! Be off! I don't trust you, not as far as I could kick you; but be off. Or I _shall_ hurt you, yes, with nasty cruel steel.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> got up on all <name type="CARDINAL">four</name>s, and backed away for several paces, and then he turned, and as <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> aimed a kick at him he fled away down the path. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> gave no more heed to him. He suddenly remembered his master. He looked up the path and could not see him. As fast as he could he trudged up the road. If he had looked back, he might have seen not far below <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> turn again, and then with a wild light of madness gla<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng in his eyes come, swiftly but wa<name type="GPE">ri</name>ly, creeping on behind, a slinking shadow among the st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s.</p>
<p>The path climbed on. Soon it bent again and. with a last eastward course passed in a cutting along the face of the c<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> and came to the dark door in the <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>'s side, the door of the <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>math Naur. Far away now <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing towards the <name type="LOC">South</name> the sun, piercing the smokes and haze, burned ominous, a dull bleared disc of red; but all <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> lay about the <name type="LOC">Mountain</name> like a dead land, silent, shadow-folded, waiting for some dreadful stroke.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> came to the gaping mouth and peered in. It was dark and hot, and a deep rumbling shook the air. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>! Master!'</q> he called. There was no answer. For a moment he stood, his heart beating with wild fears, and then he plunged in. A shadow followed him.</p>
<p>At <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> he could see nothing. In his great need he drew out once more the phial of <name type="PERSON">Galad<name type="GPE">ri</name>el</name>, but it was pale and cold in his trembling hand and threw no light into that stifling dark. He was come to the heart of the realm of <name type="ORG">Sauron</name> and the forges of his ancient might, greatest in <name type="LOC">Middle-<name type="LOC">earth</name></name>; all other powers were here subdued. <name type="PERSON">Fearfully</name> he took a few uncertain steps in the dark, and then all at once there came a flash of red that leaped upward, and smote the high black roof. Then <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> saw that he was in a long cave or tunnel that bored into the <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>'s smoking c<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. But only a short way ahead its floor and the walls on either side were cloven by a great fissure, out of which the red glare came, now leaping up, now dying down into darkness; and all the while far below there was a rumour and a trouble as of great engines throbbing and labou<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng.</p>
<p>The light sprang up again, and there on the b<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk of the chasm, at the very Crack of Doom, stood <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, black against the glare, <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>se, erect, but still as if he had been turned to st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>.</p>
<p><q>'Master!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>.</p>
<p>Then <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> stirred and spoke with a clear voice, indeed with a voice clearer and more powerful than <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> had ever heard him use, and it rose above the throb and turmoil of <name type="LOC">Mount Doom</name>, <name type="GPE">ri</name>nging in the roof and walls.</p>
<p><q>'I have come,'</q> he said. <q>'But I do not choose now to do what I came to do. I will not do this deed. The <name type="ORG">Ring</name> is mine!'</q> And suddenly, as he set it on his finger, he vanished from <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>'s sight. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> gasped, but he had no chance to cry out, for at that moment many things happened.</p>
<p>Something struck <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> violently in the back, his legs were knocked from under him and he was flung aside, st<name type="GPE">ri</name>king his head against the stony floor, as a dark shape sprang over him. He lay still and for a moment all went black.</p>
<p>And far away, as <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> put on the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> and claimed it for his own, even in <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>math Naur the very heart of his realm, the <name type="ORG">Power</name> in <name type="FAC">Barad-d</name>�r was shaken, and the <name type="FAC">Tower</name> trembled from its foundations to its proud and bitter crown. The Dark <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd was suddenly aware of him, and his <name type="PRODUCT">Eye</name> piercing all shadows looked across the plain to the door that he had made; and the magnitude of his own folly was revealed to him in a blinding flash, and all the devices of his enemies were at last laid bare. Then his wrath blazed in consuming flame, but his fear rose like a vast black smoke to choke him. For he knew his deadly pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>l and the thread upon which his doom now hung.</p>
<p>From all his policies and webs of fear and treachery, from all his stratagems and wars his mind shook free; and throughout his realm a tremor ran, his slaves quailed, and his armies halted, and his captains suddenly <name type="PERSON">steerless</name>, bereft of will, wavered and despaired. For they were forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>. The whole mind and purpose of the <name type="ORG">Power</name> that wielded them was now bent with overwhelming force upon the <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>. At his summons, wheeling with a rending cry, in a last desperate race there flew, faster than the winds, the Nazg�l the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>wraiths, and with a storm of wings they hurtled southwards to <name type="LOC">Mount Doom</name>.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> got up. He was dazed, and blood streaming from his head d<name type="GPE">ri</name>pped in his eyes. He groped forward, and then he saw a strange and ter<name type="GPE">ri</name>ble thing. <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> on the edge of the abyss was fighting like a mad thing with an unseen foe. To and fro he swayed, now so near the b<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk that almost he tumbled in, now dragging back, falling to the ground, <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing, and falling again. And all the while he hissed but spoke no words.</p>
<p>The fires below awoke in anger, the red light blazed, and all the cavern was filled with a great glare and heat. Suddenly <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> saw <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>'s long hands draw upwards to his mouth; his white fangs gleamed, and then snapped as they bit. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> gave a cry, and there he was, fallen upon his knees at the chasm's edge. But <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>, dancing like a mad thing, held aloft the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng, a finger still thrust within its circle. It sh<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> now as if ve<name type="GPE">ri</name>ly it was wrought of living fire.</p>
<p><q>'Precious, precious, precious!'</q> <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed. <q><name type="CARDINAL">'My</name> Precious! O my Precious!'</q> And with that, even as his eyes were lifted <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name> gloat on his p<name type="GPE">ri</name>ze, he stepped too far, toppled, wavered for a moment on the b<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk, and then with a sh<name type="GPE">ri</name>ek he fell. Out of the depths came his last wail _Precious_, and he was g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>.</p>
<p>There was a roar and a great confusion of noise. <name type="ORG">Fire</name>s leaped up and licked the roof. The throbbing grew to a great tumult, and the <name type="LOC">Mountain</name> shook. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> ran to <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and picked him up and car<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed him. out to the door. And there upon the dark threshold of the <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>math Naur, high above the plains of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>, such wonder and terror came on him that he stood still forgetting all else, and gazed as <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> turned to st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>.</p>
<p>A b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ef vision he had of swirling cloud, and in the midst of it towers and battlements, tall as <name type="ORG">hill</name>s, founded upon a mighty mountain-thr<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> above immeasurable pits; great courts and dungeons, eyeless p<name type="GPE">ri</name>sons sheer as cliffs, and gaping gates of steel and adamant: and then all passed. <name type="FAC">Tower</name>s fell and mountains slid; walls crumbled and melted, crashing down; vast spires of smoke and spouting steams went billowing up, up, until they toppled like an overwhelming wave, and its wild crest curled and came foaming down upon the land. And then at last over the miles between there came a rumble, <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing to a dea<name type="PERSON">fen</name>ing crash and roar; the <name type="LOC">earth</name> shook, the plain heaved and cracked, and <name type="LOC">Orodruin</name> reeled. <name type="ORG">Fire</name> belched from its <name type="GPE">ri</name>ven summit. The skies burst into thunder seared with lightning. Down like lashing whips fell a torrent of black rain. And into the heart of the storm, with a cry that pierced all other sounds, tea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng the clouds asunder, the Nazg�l came, shooting like flaming bolts, as caught in the fiery ruin of <name type="ORG">hill</name> and sky they crackled, withered, and went out.</p>
<p><q>'Well, this is the end, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> <name type="PERSON">Gamgee</name>,'</q> said a voice by his side. And there was <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, pale and worn, and yet himself again; and in his eyes there was peace now, neither strain of will, nor madness, nor any fear. His burden was taken away. There was the dear master of the sweet <name type="DATE">day</name>s in the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>.</p>
<p><q>'Master!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. and fell upon his knees. In all that ruin of the world for the moment he felt only joy, great joy. The burden was g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. His master had been saved; he was himself again, he was free. And then <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> caught sight of the maimed and bleeding hand.</p>
<p><q>'Your poor hand!'</q> he said. <q><name type="PERSON">'And</name> I have nothing to bind it with, or comfort it. I would have spared him a whole hand of mine rather. But he's g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> now beyond recall, g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> for ever.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Yes,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'But do you remember <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>'s words: _Even <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> may have something yet to do?_ But for him, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, I could not have destroyed the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>. The <name type="PRODUCT">Quest</name> would have been in vain, even at the bitter end. So let us forgive him! For the <name type="PRODUCT">Quest</name> is achieved, and now all is over. I am glad you are here with me. Here at the end of all things, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>.'</q></p>

<p>The Field of <name type="GPE">Cormallen</name></p>
<p>All about the <name type="ORG">hill</name>s the hosts of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> raged. The Captains of the <name type="LOC">West</name> were founde<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng in a gathe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng sea. The sun gleamed red, and under the wings of the Nazg�l the shadows of death fell dark upon the <name type="LOC">earth</name>. <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> stood beneath his banner, silent and stern, as <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> lost in thought of things long past or far away; but his eyes gleamed like stars that shine the b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ghter as the <name type="TIME">night</name> deepens. Upon the <name type="ORG">hill</name>-top stood <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, and he was white and cold and no shadow fell on him. The onslaught of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> broke like a wave on the beleaguered <name type="ORG">hill</name>s, voices roa<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng like a tide amid the wreck and crash of arms.</p>
<p>As if to his eyes some sudden vision had been given, <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> stirred; and he turned, looking back north where the skies were pale and clear. Then he lifted up his hands and c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed in a loud voice <name type="GPE">ri</name>nging above the din: _The <name type="PRODUCT">Eagle</name>s are coming!_ And many voices answered crying: _The <name type="PRODUCT">Eagle</name>s are coming! The <name type="PRODUCT">Eagle</name>s are coming!_ The hosts of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> looked up and wondered what this sign might mean.</p>
<p>There came <name type="PERSON">Gwaihir</name> the <name type="ORG">Windlord</name>, and <name type="PERSON">Landroval</name> his brother, greatest of all the <name type="PRODUCT">Eagle</name>s of the <name type="LOC">North</name>, mightiest of the descendants of old <name type="PERSON">Thorondor</name>, who built his ey<name type="GPE">ri</name>es in the inaccessible peaks of the Encircling <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s when <name type="LOC">Middle-<name type="LOC">earth</name></name> was young. Behind them in long swift lines came all their vassals from the northern mountains, speeding on a gathe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng wind. Straight down upon the Nazg�l they bore, stooping suddenly out of the high airs, and the rush of their wide wings as they passed over was like a gale.</p>
<p>But the Nazg�l turned and fled, and vanished into <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>'s shadows, hea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng a sudden ter<name type="GPE">ri</name>ble call out of the Dark <name type="FAC">Tower</name>; and even at that moment all the hosts of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> trembled, doubt clutched their hearts, their laughter failed, their hands shook and their limbs were loosed. The <name type="ORG">Power</name> that drove them on and filled them with hate and fury was wave<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng, its will was removed from them; and now looking in the eyes of their enemies they saw a deadly light and were afraid.</p>
<p>Then all the Captains of the <name type="LOC">West</name> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed aloud, for their hearts were filled with a new hope in the midst of darkness. Out from the beleaguered <name type="ORG">hill</name>s k<name type="TIME">night</name>s of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>, <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>, D�nedain of the <name type="LOC">North</name>, close-ser<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed companies, drove against their wave<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng foes, piercing the press with the thrust of bitter spears. But <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> lifted up his arms and called once more in a clear voice:</p>
<p><q>'Stand, <name type="ORG">Men</name> of the <name type="LOC">West</name>! Stand and wait! This is the <name type="TIME">hour</name> of doom.'</q></p>
<p>And even as he spoke the <name type="LOC">earth</name> rocked beneath their feet. Then <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing swiftly up, far above the <name type="FAC">Tower</name>s of the <name type="ORG">Black</name> <name type="FAC">Gate</name>, high above the mountains, a vast soa<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng darkness sprang into the sky, flicke<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng with fire. The <name type="LOC">earth</name> groaned and quaked. The <name type="FAC">Tower</name>s of the Teeth swayed, tottered, and fell down; the mighty rampart crumbled; the <name type="ORG">Black</name> <name type="FAC">Gate</name> was hurled in ruin; and from far away, now dim, now growing, now mounting to the clouds, there came a drumming rumble, a roar, a long echoing roll of ruinous noise.</p>
<p><q>'The realm of <name type="ORG">Sauron</name> is ended!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'The <name type="ORG">Ring</name>-bearer has fulfilled his <name type="PRODUCT">Quest</name>.'</q> And as the Captains gazed south to the Land of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>, it seemed to them that, black against the pall of cloud, there rose a huge shape of shadow, impenetrable, lightning-crowned, filling all the sky. Enormous it reared above the world, and stretched out towards them a vast threa<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing hand, ter<name type="GPE">ri</name>ble but impo<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>t: for even as it leaned over them, a great wind took it, and it was all blown away, and passed; and then a hush fell.</p>
<p>The Captains bowed their heads; and when they looked up again, behold! their enemies were flying and the power of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> was scatte<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng like dust in the wind. As when death smites the swollen brooding thing that inhabits their crawling <name type="ORG">hill</name> and holds them all in sway, ants will <name type="PERSON">wan</name>der witless and purposeless and then feebly die, so the creatures of <name type="ORG">Sauron</name>, orc or troll or beast spell-enslaved, ran hither and thither mindless; and some slew themselves, or cast themselves in pits, or fled wailing back to hide in holes and dark lightless places far from hope. But the <name type="ORG">Men</name> of Rh�n and of <name type="ORG">Harad</name>, <name type="LOC">East</name>erling and <name type="LOC">South</name>ron, saw the ruin of their war and the great majesty and glory of the Captains of the <name type="LOC">West</name>. And those that were deepest and longest in evil servitude, hating the <name type="LOC">West</name>, and yet were men proud and bold, in their turn now gathered themselves for a last stand of desperate battle. But the most part fled eastward as they could; and some cast their weapons down and sued for mercy.</p>
<p>Then <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, leaving all such matters of battle and command to <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> and the other lords, stood upon the <name type="ORG">hill</name>-top and called; and down to him came the great eagle, <name type="PERSON">Gwaihir</name> the <name type="ORG">Windlord</name>, and stood before him.</p>
<p><q>'Twice you have borne me, <name type="PERSON">Gwaihir</name> my f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Thr</name>ice shall pay for all, if you are willing. You will not find me a burden much greater than when you bore me from <name type="GPE">Zirak</name>-zigil, where my old life burned away.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I would bear you,'</q> answered <name type="PERSON">Gwaihir</name>, <q>'whither you will, even were you made of st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="ORG">'Then</name> come, and let your brother go with us, and some other of your folk who is most swift! For we have need of speed greater than any wind, outmat<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g the wings of <name type="FAC">the Nazg�l.</name>'</q></p>
<p><q>'The <name type="LOC">North</name> Wind blows, but we shall outfly it,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gwaihir</name>. And he lifted up <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> and sped away south, and with him went <name type="PERSON">Landroval</name>, and <name type="ORG">Men</name>eldor young and swift. And they passed over Ud�n and <name type="PERSON">Gorgoroth</name> and saw all the land in ruin and tumult beneath them, and before them <name type="LOC">Mount Doom</name> blazing, pou<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng out its fire.</p>
<p><q>'I am glad that you are here with me,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q><name type="CARDINAL">'He</name>re at the end of all things, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Yes, I am with you, Master,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, laying <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s wounded hand gently to his breast. <q><name type="PERSON">'And</name> you're with me. And the journey's finished. But after coming all that way I don't <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t to give up yet. It's not like me, somehow, if you understand.'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="DATE">May</name>be not, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>; <q>'but it's like things are in the world. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>pes fail. An end comes. We have only a little time to wait now. We are lost in ruin and downfall, and there is no escape.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Well, Master, we could at least go further from this dangerous place here, from <name type="WORK_OF_ART">this Crack of Doom</name>, if that's its name. Now couldn't we? <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Come</name>, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, let's go down the path at any rate!'</q></p>
<p><q>'Very well, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. If you wish to go, I'll come,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>; and they rose and went slowly down the winding road; and even as they passed towards the <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>'s quaking feet, a great smoke and steam belched from the <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>math Naur, and the side of the c<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> was <name type="GPE">ri</name>ven open, and a huge fiery vomit rolled in slow thunderous cascade down the eastern mountain-side.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> could go no further. Their last strength of mind and body was swiftly ebbing. They had reached a low ashen <name type="ORG">hill</name> piled at the <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>'s foot; but from it there was no more escape. It was an island now, not long to endure, amid the torment of <name type="LOC">Orodruin</name>. All about it the <name type="LOC">earth</name> <name type="PERSON">gape</name>d, and from deep <name type="GPE">ri</name>fts and pits smoke and fumes leaped up. Behind them the <name type="LOC">Mountain</name> was convulsed. Great rents opened in its side. Slow <name type="GPE">ri</name>vers of fire came down the long slopes towards them. Soon they would be engul<name type="ORG">fed</name>. A rain of hot ash was falling.</p>
<p>They stood now; and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> still holding his master's hand caressed it. He sighed. <q>'What a tale we have been in, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, haven't we?'</q> he said. <q>'I wish I could hear it told! Do you think they'll say: _Now comes the story of <name type="CARDINAL">Nine</name>-fingered <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> of Doom?_And then every<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> will hush, like we did, when in <name type="GPE">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name> they told us the tale of <name type="PERSON">Beren</name> <name type="CARDINAL">One</name>-hand and <name type="ORG">the Great Jewel</name>. I wish I could hear it! And I wonder how it will go on after our part.'</q></p>
<p>But even while he spoke so, to keep fear away until the very last, his eyes still strayed north, north into the eye of the wind, to where the sky far off was clear, as the cold blast, <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing to a gale, drove back the darkness and the ruin of the clouds.</p>
<p>And so it was that <name type="PERSON">Gwaihir</name> saw them with his keen far-seeing eyes, as down the wild wind he came, and da<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng the great pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>l of the skies he circled in the air: <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> small dark figures, forlorn, hand in hand upon a little <name type="ORG">hill</name>, while the world shook under them, and gasped, and <name type="GPE">ri</name>vers of fire drew near. And even as he espied them and came swooping down, he saw them fall, worn out, or choked with fumes and heat, or st<name type="GPE">ri</name>cken down by despair at last, hiding their eyes from death.</p>
<p>Side by side they lay; and down swept <name type="PERSON">Gwaihir</name>, and down came <name type="PERSON">Landroval</name> and <name type="ORG">Men</name>eldor the swift; and in a dream, not knowing what fate had befallen them, the <name type="PERSON">wan</name>derers were lifted up and borne far away out of the darkness and the fire.</p>
<p>When <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> awoke, he found that he was lying on some soft bed, but over him gently swayed wide beechen boughs, and through their young leaves sunlight glimmered, green and gold. All the air was full of a sweet mingled scent.</p>
<p>He remembered that smell: the fragrance of <name type="ORG">Ithil</name>ien. <q>'Bless me!'</q> he mused. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w long have I been asleep?'</q> For the scent had borne him back to the <name type="DATE">day</name> when he had lit his little fire under the sunny bank; and for a moment all else between was out of waking memory. He stretched and drew a deep breath. <q>'Why, what a dream I've had!'</q> he muttered. <q>'I am glad to wake!'</q> He sat up and then he saw that <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> was lying beside him, and slept peacefully, <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> hand behind his head, and the other resting upon the coverlet. It was the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght hand, and the <name type="ORDINAL">third</name> finger was missing.</p>
<p>Full memory flooded back, and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed aloud: <q><name type="DATE">'It</name> wasn't a dream! Then where are we?'</q></p>
<p>And a voice spoke softly behind: <q>'In the land of <name type="ORG">Ithil</name>ien, and in the keeping of the <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g; and he awaits you.'</q> With that <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> stood before him, robed in white, his beard now gleaming like pure snow in the twinkling of the leafy sunlight. <q>'Well, <name type="PERSON">Master <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>wise</name>, how do you feel?'</q> he said.</p>
<p>But <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> lay back, and stared with open mouth, and for a moment, between bewilderment and great joy, he could not answer. At last he gasped: <q><name type="ORG">'<name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name></name>! I thought you were dead! But then I thought I was dead myself. Is everything sad going to come untrue? What's happened to the world?'</q></p>
<p><q>'A great <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name> has departed,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, and then he laughed and the sound was like music, or like water in a parched land; and as he lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed the thought came to <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> that he had not heard laughter, the pure sound of mer<name type="GPE">ri</name>ment, for <name type="DATE">day</name>s upon <name type="DATE">day</name>s without count. It fell upon his ears like the echo of all the joys he had ever known. But he himself burst into tears. Then, as a sweet rain will pass down a wind of sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng and the sun will shine out the clearer, his tears ceased, and his laughter welled up, and laughing he sprang from his bed.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w do I feel?'</q> he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed. <q>'Well, I don't know how to say it. I feel, I feel' � he waved his arms in the air � 'I feel like sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng after <name type="DATE">winter</name>, and sun on the leaves; and like trumpets and harps and all the songs I have ever heard!'</q> He stopped and he turned towards his master. <q>'But how's Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>?'</q> he said. <q>'Isn't it a shame about his poor hand? But I hope he's all <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght otherwise. He's had a cruel time.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Yes, I am all <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght otherwise,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, sitting up and laughing in his turn. I fell asleep again waiting for you, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, you sleepyhead. I was awake <name type="TIME">early this <name type="TIME">morning</name></name>, and now it must be <name type="TIME">nearly <name type="TIME">noon</name></name>.'</p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'No</name>on?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, trying to calculate. <q><name type="DATE">'No</name>on of what <name type="DATE">day</name>?'</q></p>
<p><q>'The <name type="CARDINAL">four</name>teenth of the <name type="EVENT">New Year</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>; <q>'or if you like, the <name type="CARDINAL">eight</name>h <name type="DATE">day</name> of <name type="DATE">Ap<name type="GPE">ri</name>l</name> in the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> reckoning. But in <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> the <name type="EVENT">New Year</name> will always now begin upon the <name type="CARDINAL">twenty</name>-<name type="ORDINAL">fifth</name> of <name type="DATE">March</name> when <name type="ORG">Sauron</name> fell, and when you were brought out of the fire to the <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g. He has <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ded you, and now he awaits you. You shall eat and d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk with him. When you are ready I will lead you to him.'</q></p>
<p><q>'The <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <q>'What king, and who is he?'</q></p>
<p><q>'The <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> and <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd of the <name type="LOC">West</name>ern Lands,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> <q>'and he has taken back all his ancient realm. He will <name type="GPE">ri</name>de soon to his crowning, but he waits for you.'</q></p>
<p><q>'What shall we wear?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>; for all he could see was the old and tattered clothes that they had journeyed in, lying folded on the ground beside their beds.</p>
<p><q>'The clothes that you wore on your way to <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'Even the orc-rags that you bore in the black land; <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, shall be preserved. No silks and linens, nor any armour or heraldry could be more honourable. But later I will find some other clothes, perhaps.'</q></p>
<p>Then he held out his hands to them, and they saw that <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> sh<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> with light. <q>'What have you got there?'</q> <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed. <q>'Can it be � ?'</q></p>
<p><q>'Yes, I have brought your <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> treasures. They were found on <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> when you were rescued. The <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> <name type="PERSON">Galad<name type="GPE">ri</name>el</name>'s gifts: your glass, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, and your box, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. You will be glad to have these safe again.'</q></p>
<p>When they were washed and clad, and had ea<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> a light meal, the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbits followed <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. They stepped out of the beech-grove in which they had lain, and passed on to a long green lawn, glowing in sunshine, bordered by stately dark-leaved trees laden with scarlet blossom. Behind them they could hear the sound of falling water, and a stream ran down before them between flowe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng banks, until it came to a <name type="PERSON">greenwood</name> at the lawn's foot and passed then on under an archway of trees, through which they saw the shimmer of water far away.</p>
<p>As they came to the opening in the wood, they were surp<name type="GPE">ri</name>sed to see k<name type="TIME">night</name>s in b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght mail and tall guards in silver and black standing there, who greeted them with honour and bowed before them. And then <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> blew a long trumpet, and they went on through the aisle of trees beside the singing stream. So they came to a wide green land, and beyond it was a broad <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver in a silver haze, out of which rose a long wooded isle, and many ships lay by its shores. But on the field where they now stood a great host was drawn up, in ranks and companies glitte<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng in the sun. And as the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbits approached swords were unsheathed, and spears were shaken, and horns and trumpets sang, and men c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed with many voices and in many tongues:</p>
<p>_'<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ng live the <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>flings! Praise them with great praise!</p>
<p>Cuio i <name type="ORG">Phe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ain</name> anann! Aglar'ni Phe<name type="GPE">ri</name>annath!</p>
<p>Praise them with great praise, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>wise!</p>
<p>Daur a <name type="GPE">Berhael</name>, <name type="ORG">Conin</name> en <name type="PERSON">Ann�n</name>! Egle<name type="GPE">ri</name>o!</p>
<p>Praise them!</p>
<p>Egle<name type="GPE">ri</name>o!</p>
<p>A laita te, <name type="ORG">laita te!</name> Andave laituvalmet!</p>
<p>Praise them!</p>
<p>Cormacolindor, a laita t�<name type="GPE">ri</name>enna!</p>
<p>Praise them! The <name type="ORG">Ring</name>-bearers, praise them with great praise!'_</p>
<p>And so the red blood blushing in their faces and their eyes shining with wonder, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> went forward and saw that amidst the clamorous host were set <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> high-seats built of green turves. Behind the seat upon the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght floated, white on green, a great horse running free; upon the left was a banner, silver upon blue, a ship <name type="PERSON">s<name type="PERSON">wan</name></name>-prowed fa<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng on the sea; but behind the highest thr<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> in the midst of all a great standard was spread in the breeze, and there a white tree flowered upon a sable field beneath a shining crown and <name type="CARDINAL">seven</name> glitte<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng stars. On the thr<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> sat a mail-clad man, a great sword was laid across his knees, but he wore no helm. As they drew near he rose. And then they knew him, changed as he was, so high and glad of face, kingly, lord of <name type="ORG">Men</name>, dark-<name type="PERSON">hai</name>red with eyes of grey.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> ran to meet him, and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> followed close behind. <q>'Well, if that isn't the crown of all!'</q> he said. <q>'<name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>, or I'm still asleep!'</q></p>
<p><q>'Yes, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q><name type="DATE">'It</name> is a long way, is it not, from <name type="PERSON">Bree</name>, where you did not like the look of me? A long way for us all but yours has been the darkest road.'</q></p>
<p>And then to <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>'s surp<name type="GPE">ri</name>se and utter confusion he bowed his knee before them; and taking them by the hand, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> upon his <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> upon his left, he led them to the thr<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, and setting them upon it, he turned to the men and captains who stood by and spoke, so that his voice rang over all the host, crying:</p>
<p><q>'Praise them with great praise!'</q></p>
<p>And when the glad shout had swelled up and died away again, to <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>'s final and complete satisfaction and pure joy, a minstrel of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> stood forth, and knelt, and begged leave to sing. And behold! he said:</p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>! lords and k<name type="TIME">night</name>s and men of valour unashamed, kings and p<name type="GPE">ri</name>nces, and fair people of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>, and <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>, and ye sons of <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name>, and D�nedain of the <name type="LOC">North</name>, and <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name> and <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Dwarf</name>, and <name type="ORG">greatheart</name>s of the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>, and all free folk of the <name type="LOC">West</name>, now lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> to my lay. For I will sing to you of <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> of the <name type="CARDINAL">Nine</name> Fingers and the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> of Doom.'</q></p>
<p>And when <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> heard that he laughed aloud for sheer delight, and he stood up and c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed: <q>'O great glory and splendour! And all my wishes have come true!'</q> And then he wept.</p>
<p>And all the host laughed and wept, and in the midst of their mer<name type="GPE">ri</name>ment and tears the clear voice of the minstrel rose like silver and gold, and all men were hushed. And he sang to them, now in the <name type="ORG">Elven</name>-tongue, now in the speech of the <name type="LOC">West</name>, until their hearts, wounded with sweet words, overflowed, and their joy was like swords, and they passed in thought out to regions where pain and delight flow together and tears are the very wine of blessedness.</p>
<p>And at the last, as the <name type="ORG">Sun</name> fell from the <name type="TIME">noon</name> and the shadows of the trees lengthened, he ended. <q>'Praise them with great praise!'</q> he said and knelt. And then <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> stood up, and all the host arose, and they passed to pavilions made ready, to eat and d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk and make merry while the <name type="DATE">day</name> lasted.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> were led apart and brought to a <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>t, and there their old raiment was taken off, but folded and set aside with honour; and clean linen was given to them. Then <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> came and in his arms, to the wonder of <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, he bore the sword and the <name type="ORG">elven</name>-cloak and the <name type="PERSON">mith<name type="GPE">ri</name>l</name>-coat that had been taken from him in <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>. For <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> he brought a coat of gilded mail, and his <name type="ORG">elven</name>-cloak all healed of the soils and hurts that it had suffered; and then he laid before them <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> swords.</p>
<p><q>'I do not wish for any sword,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.</p>
<p><q><name type="TIME">'<name type="TIME">To<name type="TIME">night</name></name></name> at least you should wear <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>.</p>
<p>Then <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> took the small sword that had belonged to <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, and had been laid at his side in <name type="PERSON">Ci<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name> Ungol. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Sting</name> I gave to you <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>,'</q> he said.</p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'No</name>, master! Mr. <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> gave it to you, and it goes with his silver coat; he would not wish any<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> else to wear it now.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> gave way; and <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, as if he were their esquire, knelt and girt the sword-belts about them, and then <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing he set <name type="NORP">circlets</name> of silver upon their heads. And when they were arrayed they went to the great feast; and they sat at the <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g's table with <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, and <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g �omer of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>, and the P<name type="GPE">ri</name>nce <name type="PERSON">Imrahil</name> and all the chief captains; and there also were <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> and <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>.</p>
<p>But when, after the Standing Silence, wine was brought there came in <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> esquires to serve the kings; or so they seemed to be: <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> was clad in the silver and sable of the <name type="ORG">Guard</name>s of Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name>, and the other in white and green. But <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> wondered what such young boys were doing in an army of mighty men. Then suddenly as they drew near and he could see them plainly, he exclaimed:</p>
<p><q>'Why, look Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>! <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok here! Well, if it isn't <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. Mr. <name type="PERSON">Pereg<name type="GPE">ri</name>n</name> <name type="PERSON">Took</name> I should say, and Mr. <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>! <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w they have grown! Bless me! But I can see there's more tales to tell than ours.'</q></p>
<p><q>'There are indeed,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> turning towards him. <q><name type="PERSON">'And</name> we'll begin telling them, as soon as this feast is ended. In the meantime you can try <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. He's not so close as he used to be, though he laughs now more than he talks. For the present <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> and I are busy. We are k<name type="TIME">night</name>s of the <name type="LOC">City</name> and of the <name type="PERSON">Mark</name>, as I hope you observe.'</q></p>
<p>At last the glad <name type="DATE">day</name> ended; and when the <name type="ORG">Sun</name> was g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> and the round <name type="PERSON">Moon</name> rode slowly above the mists of <name type="GPE">Anduin</name> and flickered through the flutte<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng leaves, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> sat under the whispe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng trees amid the fragrance of fair <name type="ORG">Ithil</name>ien; and they talked deep into the <name type="TIME">night</name> with <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> and <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, and after a while <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> and <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> joined them. There <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> learned much of all that had happened to the <name type="ORG">Company</name> after their fellowship was broken on the evil <name type="DATE">day</name> at <name type="FAC">Parth Galen</name> by <name type="PERSON">Rauros</name> Falls; and still there was always more to ask and more to tell.</p>
<p><name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s, and talking trees, and leagues of grass, and galloping <name type="GPE">ri</name>ders. and glitte<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng caves, and white towers and golden halls, and battles, and tall ships sailing, all these passed before <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>'s mind until he felt bewildered. But amidst all these wonders he returned always to his astonishment at the size of <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>; and he made them stand back to back with <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and himself. He scratched his head. <q>'Can't understand it at your age!'</q> he said. <q>'But there it is: you're <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> inches taller than you ought to he, or I'm a dwarf.'</q></p>
<p><q>'That you certainly are not,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. <q>'But what did I say? Mortals cannot go d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nking ent-draughts and expect no more to come of them than of a pot of beer.'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="ORG">Ent</name>-draughts?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <q>'There you go about <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s again; but what they are beats me. Why, it will take <name type="DATE">week</name>s before we get all these things sized up!'</q></p>
<p><q>'Weeks indeed,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q><name type="PERSON">'And</name> then <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> will have to be locked up in a tower in Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name> and w<name type="GPE">ri</name>te it all down. Otherwise he will forget <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> of it, and poor old <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> will be dreadfully disappointed.'</q></p>
<p>At length <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> rose. <q>'The hands of the <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g are hands of healing, dear f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends,'</q> he said. <q>'But you went to the very b<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk of death ere he recalled you, putting forth all his power, and sent you into the sweet forgetfulness of sleep. And though you have indeed slept long and blessedly, still it is now time to sleep again.'</q></p>
<p>And not only <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> and <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> here, said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>, but you too, <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. I love you, if only because of the pains you have cost me, which I shall never forget. Nor shall I forget finding you on the <name type="ORG">hill</name> of the last battle. But for <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> the <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Dwarf</name> you would have been lost then. But at least I know now the look of a hobbit's foot, though it be all that can be seen under a heap of bodies. And when I heaved that great carcase off you, I made sure you were dead. I could have. torn out my beard. And it is only <name type="DATE">a <name type="DATE">day</name></name> yet since you were <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> up and abroad again. To bed now you go. And so shall I.'</p>
<p><q><name type="PERSON">'And</name> I,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>, 'shall walk in the woods of this fair land, which is rest enough. In <name type="DATE">day</name>s to come, if my <name type="ORG">Elven</name>-lord allows, some of our folk shall remove hither; and when we come it shall be blessed, for a while. For a while: <name type="DATE">a month</name>, a life, <name type="CARDINAL">a <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name></name> <name type="DATE">year</name>s of <name type="ORG">Men</name>. But <name type="GPE">Anduin</name> is near, and <name type="GPE">Anduin</name> leads down to the <name type="LOC">Sea</name>. To the <name type="LOC">Sea</name>!</p>
<p>_To the <name type="LOC">Sea</name>, to the <name type="LOC">Sea</name>! The white gulls are crying,</p>
<p>The wind is blowing, and the white foam is flying.</p>
<p><name type="LOC">West</name>, west away, the round sun is falling.</p>
<p><name type="ORG">Grey</name> ship, grey ship, do you hear them calling.</p>
<p>The voices of my people that have g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> before me?</p>
<p>I will leave, I will leave the woods that bore me;</p>
<p>For our <name type="DATE">day</name>s are ending and our <name type="DATE">year</name>s failing.</p>
<p>I will pass the wide waters l<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>ly sailing.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ng are the waves on the Last <name type="LOC">Shore</name> falling,</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sweet</name> are the voices in the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>st Isle calling,</p>
<p>In <name type="PRODUCT">Eress</name>�a, in <name type="ORG">Elven</name>home that no man can discover,</p>
<p>Where the leaves fall not: land of my people for ever!'_</p>
<p>And so singing <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> went away down the <name type="ORG">hill</name>.</p>
<p>Then the others also departed, and <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> went to their beds and slept. And in the <name type="TIME">morning</name> they rose again in hope and peace; and they spent many <name type="DATE">day</name>s in <name type="ORG">Ithil</name>ien. For the Field of <name type="GPE">Cormallen</name>, where the host was now encamped was near to <name type="ORG">Hen</name>neth <name type="PERSON">Ann�n</name>, and the stream that flowed from its falls could be heard in the <name type="TIME">night</name> as it rushed down through its rocky gate, and passed through the flowery meads into the tides of <name type="GPE">Anduin</name> by <name type="GPE">the Isle of</name> Cair <name type="PERSON">Andros</name>. The hobbits <name type="PERSON">wan</name>dered here and there visiting again the places that they had passed before; and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> hoped always in some shadow of the woods or <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret glade to catch, maybe, a glimpse of the great <name type="ORG">Oliphaunt</name>. And when he learned that at the siege of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> there had been a great number of these beasts but that they were all destroyed, he thought it a sad loss.</p>
<p><q>'Well, <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> can't be everywhere at once, I suppose,'</q> he said. <q>'But I missed a lot, seemingly.'</q></p>
<p>In the meanwhile the host made ready for the return to Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name>. The weary rested and the hurt were healed. For some had laboured and fought much with the remnants of the <name type="LOC">East</name>erlings and <name type="LOC">South</name>rons, until all were subdued. And, latest of all, those returned who had passed into <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> and destroyed the fortresses in the north of the land.</p>
<p>But at the last when the month of <name type="DATE">May</name> was drawing near the Captains of the <name type="LOC">West</name> set out again; and they went aboard ship with all their men, and they sailed from Cair <name type="PERSON">Andros</name> down <name type="GPE">Anduin</name> to <name type="NORP">Osgiliath</name>; and there they remained for <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> <name type="DATE">day</name>; and the <name type="DATE">day</name> after they came to the green fields of the <name type="ORG">Pelennor</name> and saw again the white towers under tall <name type="GPE">Min<name type="PERSON">dol</name>luin</name>, the <name type="LOC">City</name> of the <name type="ORG">Men</name> of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>, last memory of <name type="LOC">West</name>ernesse, that had passed through the darkness and fire to a new <name type="DATE">day</name>.</p>
<p>And there in the midst of the fields they set up their pavilions and awaited the <name type="TIME">morning</name>; for it was the Eve of <name type="DATE">May</name>, and the <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g would enter his gates with the <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing of the <name type="ORG">Sun</name>.</p>
</chapter><chapter num="5"><heading>Chapter 5</heading>
<p>The <name type="ORG">Steward</name> and the <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g</p>
<p>Over the city of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> doubt and great dread had hung. <name type="ORG">Fair</name> weather and clear sun had seemed but a mockery to men whose <name type="DATE">day</name>s held little hope, and who looked <name type="TIME">each <name type="TIME">morning</name></name> for news of doom. Their lord was dead and burned, dead lay the <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> in their citadel, and the new king that had come to them in the <name type="TIME">night</name> was g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> again to a war with powers too dark and ter<name type="GPE">ri</name>ble for any might or valour to conquer. And no news came. After the host left <name type="PERSON">Morgul</name> Vale and took the northward road beneath the shadow of the mountains no messenger had returned nor any rumour of what was passing in the brooding <name type="LOC">East</name>.</p>
<p>When the Captains were but <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> <name type="DATE">day</name>s g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, the <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name> bade the women who <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ded her to b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng her raiment, and she would not be gainsaid, but rose; and when they had clothed her and set her arm in a sling of linen, she went to the <name type="ORG">Warden</name> of the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>uses of Healing.</p>
<p><q>'Sir,'</q> she said, <q>'I am in great unrest, and I cannot lie longer in sloth.'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Lady</name>,'</q> he answered, <q>'you are not yet healed, and I was commanded to <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>d you with especial care. You should not have <name type="GPE">ri</name>sen from your bed for <name type="CARDINAL">seven</name> <name type="DATE">day</name>s yet, or so I was bidden. I beg you to go back.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I am healed,'</q> she said, <q>'healed at least in body, save my left arm only, and that is at ease. But I shall sicken anew, if there is naught that I can do. Are there no tidings of war? The women can tell me nothing.'</q></p>
<p><q>'There are no tidings,'</q> said the <name type="ORG">Warden</name>, <q>'save that the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rds have <name type="GPE">ri</name>dden to <name type="PERSON">Morgul</name> Vale; and men say that the new captain out of the <name type="LOC">North</name> is their chief. A great lord is that, and a healer; and it is a thing passing strange to me that the healing hand should also wield the sword. It is not thus in <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> now, though once it was so, if old tales be true. But for <name type="DATE">long <name type="DATE">year</name>s</name> we healers have only sought to patch the rents made by the men of swords. Though we should still have enough to do without them: the world is full enough of hurts and mischances without wars to multiply them.'</q></p>
<p>It needs but <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> foe to breed a war, not <name type="CARDINAL">two</name>, Master <name type="ORG">Warden</name>, answered <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name>. <q><name type="PERSON">'And</name> those who have not swords can still die upon them. Would you have the folk of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> gather you herbs only, when the Dark <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd gathers armies? And it is not always good to be healed in body. Nor is it always evil to die in battle, even in bitter pain. Were I permitted, in this dark <name type="TIME">hour</name> I would choose the latter.'</q></p>
<p>The <name type="ORG">Warden</name> looked at her. Tall she stood there, her eyes b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght in her white face, her hand clenched as she turned and gazed out of his window that opened to the <name type="LOC">East</name>. He sighed and shook his head. After a pause she turned to him again.</p>
<p><q>'Is there no deed to do?'</q> she said. <q><name type="CARDINAL">'Who</name> commands in this <name type="LOC">City</name>?'</q></p>
<p><q>'I do not <name type="GPE">ri</name>ghtly know,'</q> he answered. <q>'Such things are not my care. There is a <name type="PERSON">mar</name>shal over the <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>; and the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd H�<name type="GPE">ri</name>n, I am told, commands the men of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>. But the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name> is by <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght the <name type="ORG">Steward</name> of the <name type="LOC">City</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Where can I find him?'</q></p>
<p><q>'In this house, lady. He was sorely hurt, but is now set again on the way to health. But I do not know-'</q></p>
<p><q>'Will you not b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng me to him? Then you will know.'</q></p>
<p>The <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name> was walking al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> in the garden of the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>uses of Healing, and the sunlight warmed him, and he felt life run new in his veins; but his heart was heavy, and he looked out over the walls eastward. And coming, the <name type="ORG">Warden</name> spoke his name, and he turned and saw the <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name> of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>; and he was moved with pity, for he saw that she was hurt, and his clear sight perceived her sorrow and unrest.</p>
<p><q><name type="CARDINAL">'My</name> lord,'</q> said the <name type="ORG">Warden</name>, <q>'here is the <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name> of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>. She rode with the king and was sorely hurt, and dwells now in my keeping. But she is not con<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>t, and she wishes to speak to the <name type="ORG">Steward</name> of the <name type="LOC">City</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Do not misunderstand him, lord,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name>. <q><name type="DATE">'It</name> is not lack of care that g<name type="GPE">ri</name>eves me. No houses could be fairer, for those who desire to be healed. But I cannot lie in sloth, idle, caged. I looked for death in battle. But I have not died, and battle still goes on.'</q></p>
<p>At a sign from <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name>, the <name type="ORG">Warden</name> bowed and departed. <q>'What would you have me do, lady?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name>. <q>'I also am a p<name type="GPE">ri</name>s<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>r of the healers.'</q> He looked at her, and being a man whom pity deeply stirred, it seemed to him that her loveliness amid her g<name type="GPE">ri</name>ef would pierce his heart. And she looked at him and saw the grave <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>derness in his eyes, and yet knew, for she was bred among men of war, that here was <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> whom no <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name> of the <name type="PERSON">Mark</name> would outmatch in battle.</p>
<p><q>'What do you wish?'</q> he said again. <q>'If it lies in my power, I will do it.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I would have you command this <name type="ORG">Warden</name>, and bid him let me go,'</q> she said; but though her words were still proud, her heart faltered, and for the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> time she doubted herself. She guessed that this tall man, both stern and gentle, might think her merely wayward, like a child that has not the firmness of mind to go on with a dull task to the end.</p>
<p><q>'I myself am in the <name type="ORG">Warden</name>'s keeping,'</q> answered <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name>. <q><name type="DATE">'No</name>r have I yet taken up my autho<name type="GPE">ri</name>ty in the <name type="LOC">City</name>. But had I d<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> so, I should still lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> to his counsel, and should not cross his will in matters of his craft, unless in some great need.'</q></p>
<p><q>'But I do not desire healing,'</q> she said. <q>'I wish to <name type="GPE">ri</name>de to war like my brother �omer, or better like Th�oden the king, for he died and has both honour and peace.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'It</name> is too late, lady, to follow the Captains, even if you had the strength,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name>. <q>'But death in battle may come to us all yet, willing or unwilling. You will be better prepared to face it in your own manner, if while there is still time you do as the Healer commanded. You and I, we must endure with patience the <name type="TIME">hour</name>s of waiting.'</q></p>
<p>She did not answer, but as he looked at her it seemed to him that something in her sof<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed, as though a bitter frost were yielding at the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> faint presage of <name type="DATE">Sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng</name>. A tear sprang in her eye and fell down her cheek, like a glis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing rain-drop. Her proud head drooped a little. Then quietly, more as if speaking to herself than to him: <q>'But the healers would have me lie abed <name type="CARDINAL">seven</name> <name type="DATE">day</name>s yet,'</q> she said. <q><name type="PERSON">'And</name> my window does not look eastward.'</q> Her voice was now that of a maiden young and sad.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Faramir</name> smiled, though his heart was filled with pity. <q>'Your window does not look eastward?'</q> he said. <q>'That can be amended. In this I will command the <name type="ORG">Warden</name>. If you will stay in this house in our care, lady, and take your rest, then you shall walk in this garden in the sun, as you will; and you shall look east, whither all our hopes have g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. And here you will find me, walking and waiting, and also looking east. It would ease my care, if you would speak to me, or walk at whiles with me.'</q></p>
<p>Then she raised her head and looked him in the eyes again; and a colour came in her pale face. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w should I ease your care, my lord?'</q> she said. <q><name type="PERSON">'And</name> I do not desire the speech of living men.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Would you have my plain answer?'</q> he said.</p>
<p><q>'I would.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="ORG">'Then</name>, <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name> of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>, I say to you that you are beautiful. In the valleys of our <name type="ORG">hill</name>s there are flowers fair and b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght, and maidens fairer still; but neither flower nor lady have I seen till now in <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> so lovely, and so sorrowful. It may be that only a few <name type="DATE">day</name>s are left ere darkness falls upon our world, and when it comes I hope to face it steadily; but it would ease my heart, if while the <name type="ORG">Sun</name> yet shines, I could see you still. For you and I have both passed under the wings of the <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>, and the same hand drew us back.'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Alas</name>, not me, lord!'</q> she said. <q>'<name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name> lies on me still. <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok not to me for healing! I am a shieldmaiden and my hand is ungentle. But I thank you for this at least, that I need not keep to my chamber. I will walk abroad by the grace of the <name type="ORG">Steward</name> of the <name type="LOC">City</name>.'</q> And she did him a courtesy and walked back to the house. But <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name> for a long while walked al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> in the garden, and his glance now strayed rather to the house than to the eastward walls.</p>
<p>When he returned to his chamber he called for the <name type="ORG">Warden</name>, and heard all that he could tell of the <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>.</p>
<p><q>'But I doubt not, lord,'</q> said the <name type="ORG">Warden</name>, <q>'that you would learn more from the <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>fling that is with us; for he was in the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ding of the king, and with the <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> at the end, they say.'</q></p>
<p>And so <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> was sent to <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name>, and while that <name type="DATE">day</name> lasted they talked long together, and <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name> learned much, more even than <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> put into words; and he thought that he understood now something of the g<name type="GPE">ri</name>ef and unrest of <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name> of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>. And in the fair <name type="TIME">evening</name> <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name> and <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> walked in the garden, but she did not come.</p>
<p>But in the <name type="TIME">morning</name>, as <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name> came from the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>uses, he saw her, as she stood upon the walls; and she was clad all in white, and gleamed in the sun. And he called to her, and she came down, and they walked on the grass or sat under a green tree together, now in silence, now in speech. And each <name type="DATE">day</name> after they did likewise. And the <name type="ORG">Warden</name> looking from his window was glad in heart. for he was a healer. and his care was ligh<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed; and certain it was that, heavy as was the dread and foreboding of those <name type="DATE">day</name>s upon the hearts of men, still these <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> of his charges prospered and grew <name type="DATE">daily</name> in strength.</p>
<p>And so the <name type="ORDINAL">fifth</name> <name type="DATE">day</name> came since the <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name> went <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> to <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name>; and they stood now together once more upon the walls of the <name type="LOC">City</name> and looked out. No tidings had yet come, and all hearts were darkened. The weather, too, was b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght no longer. It was cold. A wind that had sprung up in the <name type="TIME">night</name> was blowing now keenly from the <name type="LOC">North</name>, and it was <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing; but the lands about looked grey and drear.</p>
<p>They were clad in warm raiment and heavy cloaks, and over all the <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name> wore a great blue mantle of the colour of deep <name type="DATE">summer</name>-<name type="TIME">night</name>, and it was set with silver stars about hem and throat. <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name> had sent for this robe and had wrapped it about her; and he thought that she looked fair and queenly indeed as she stood there at his side. The mantle was wrought for his mother, Finduilas of <name type="PERSON">Amroth</name>, who died untimely, and was to him but a memory of loveliness in far <name type="DATE">day</name>s and of his <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> g<name type="GPE">ri</name>ef; and her robe seemed to him raiment fitting for the beauty and sadness of <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name>.</p>
<p>But she now shivered beneath the starry mantle, and she looked northward, above the grey hither lands, into the eye of the cold wind where far away the sky was hard and clear.</p>
<p><q>'What do you look for, <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name>?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name>.</p>
<p><q>'Does not the <name type="ORG">Black</name> <name type="FAC">Gate</name> lie yonder?'</q> said she. <q><name type="PERSON">'And</name> must he not now be come thither? It is <name type="CARDINAL">seven</name> <name type="DATE">day</name>s since he rode away.'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="CARDINAL">Seven</name> <name type="DATE">day</name>s,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name>. <q>'But think not ill of me, if I say to you: they have brought me both a joy and a pain that I never thought to know. Joy to see you; but pain, because now the fear and doubt of this evil time are grown dark indeed. <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name>, I would not have this world end now, or lose so soon what I have found.'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>se what you have found, lord?'</q> she answered; but she looked at him gravely and her eyes were kind. <q>'I know not what in these <name type="DATE">day</name>s you have found that you could lose. But come, my f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end, let us not speak of it! Let us not speak at all! I stand upon some dreadful b<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk, and it is utterly dark in the abyss before my feet, but whether there is any light behind me I cannot tell. For I cannot turn yet. I wait for some stroke of doom.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Yes, we wait for the stroke of doom,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name>. And they said no more; and it seemed to them as they stood upon the wall that the wind died, and the light failed, and the <name type="ORG">Sun</name> was bleared, and all sounds in the <name type="LOC">City</name> or in the lands about were hushed: neither wind, nor voice, nor bird-call, nor rustle of leaf, nor their own breath could be heard; the very beating of their hearts was stilled. <name type="PERSON">Tim</name>e halted.</p>
<p>And as they stood so, their hands met and clasped, though they did not know it. And still they waited for they knew not what. Then presently it seemed to them that above the <name type="GPE">ri</name>dges of the distant mountains another vast mountain of darkness rose, towe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng up like a wave that should en<name type="LOC">gulf</name> the world, and about it lightnings flickered; and then a tremor ran through the <name type="LOC">earth</name>, and they felt the walls of the <name type="LOC">City</name> quiver. A sound like a sigh went up from all the lands about them; and their hearts beat suddenly again.</p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'It</name> reminds me of N�menor,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name>, and wondered to hear himself speak.</p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'Of</name> N�menor?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name>.</p>
<p><q>'Yes,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name>, <q>'of the land of <name type="LOC">West</name>ernesse that foundered and of the great dark wave climbing over the green lands and above the <name type="ORG">hill</name>s, and coming on, darkness unescapable. I of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> dream of it.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="ORG">'Then</name> you think that the <name type="PRODUCT">Darkness</name> is coming?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name>. <q>'<name type="PRODUCT">Darkness</name> Unescapable?'</q> And suddenly she drew close to him.</p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'No</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name>, looking into her face. <q><name type="DATE">'It</name> was but a picture in the mind. I do not know what is happening. The reason of my waking mind tells me that great evil has befallen and we stand at the end of <name type="DATE">day</name>s. But my heart says nay; and all my limbs are light, and a hope and joy are come to me that no reason can deny. <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name>, <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name>, White <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>, in this <name type="TIME">hour</name> I do not believe that any darkness will endure!'</q> And he stooped and kissed her brow.</p>
<p>And so they stood on the walls of the <name type="LOC">City</name> of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>, and a great wind rose and blew, and their <name type="PERSON">hai</name>r, <name type="PERSON">raven</name> and golden, streamed out mingling in the air. And the <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name> departed, and the <name type="ORG">Sun</name> was unveiled, and light leaped forth; and the waters of <name type="GPE">Anduin</name> sh<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> like silver, and in all the houses of the <name type="LOC">City</name> men sang for the joy that welled up in their hearts from what source they could not tell.</p>
<p>And before the <name type="ORG">Sun</name> had fallen far from the <name type="TIME">noon</name> out of the <name type="LOC">East</name> there came a great <name type="PRODUCT">Eagle</name> flying, and he bore tidings beyond hope from the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rds of the <name type="LOC">West</name>, crying:</p>
<p>_Sing now, ye people of the <name type="FAC">Tower</name> of <name type="GPE">Anor</name>,</p>
<p>for the Realm of <name type="ORG">Sauron</name> is ended for ever,</p>
<p>and the Dark <name type="FAC">Tower</name> is thrown down.</p>
<p>Sing and rejoice, ye people of the <name type="FAC">Tower</name> of <name type="ORG">Guard</name>,</p>
<p>for your watch hath not been in vain,</p>
<p>and the <name type="ORG">Black</name> <name type="FAC">Gate</name> is broken,</p>
<p>and your <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g hath passed through,</p>
<p>and he is victo<name type="GPE">ri</name>ous.</p>
<p>Sing and be glad, all ye children of the <name type="LOC">West</name>,</p>
<p>for your <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g shall come again,</p>
<p>and he shall dwell among you</p>
<p><name type="DATE">all the <name type="DATE">day</name>s</name> of your life.</p>
<p>And the <name type="PERSON">Tree</name> that was withered shall be renewed,</p>
<p>and he shall plant it in the high places,</p>
<p>and the <name type="LOC">City</name> shall be blessed.</p>
<p>Sing all ye people!_</p>
<p>And the people sang in all the ways of the <name type="LOC">City</name>.</p>
<p><name type="DATE">The <name type="DATE">day</name></name>s that followed were golden, and <name type="DATE">Sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng</name> and <name type="EVENT">Summer</name> joined and made revel together in the fields of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>. And tidings now came by swift <name type="GPE">ri</name>ders from Cair <name type="PERSON">Andros</name> of all that was d<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, and the <name type="LOC">City</name> made ready for the coming of the <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g. <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> was summ<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>d and rode away with the <name type="PERSON">wain</name>s that took store of goods to <name type="NORP">Osgiliath</name> and thence by ship to Cair <name type="PERSON">Andros</name>; but <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name> did not go, for now being healed he took upon him his autho<name type="GPE">ri</name>ty and the <name type="ORG">Steward</name>ship, although it was only for a little while, and his duty was to prepare for <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> who should replace him.</p>
<p>And <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name> did not go, though her brother sent word begging her to come to the field of <name type="GPE">Cormallen</name>. And <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name> wondered at this, but he saw her seldom, being busy with many matters; and she dwelt still in the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>uses of Healing and walked al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> in the garden, and her face grew pale again, and it seemed that in all the <name type="LOC">City</name> she only was ailing and sorrowful. And the <name type="ORG">Warden</name> of the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>uses was troubled, and he spoke to <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name>.</p>
<p>Then <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name> came and sought her, and once more they stood on the walls together; and he said to her: <q>'<name type="PERSON">�owyn</name>, why do you tarry here, and do not go to the rejoicing in <name type="GPE">Cormallen</name> beyond Cair <name type="PERSON">Andros</name>, where your brother awaits you?'</q></p>
<p>And she said: <q>'Do you not know?'</q></p>
<p>But he answered: <q>'<name type="CARDINAL">Two</name> reasons there may be, but which is true, I do not know.'</q></p>
<p>And she said: <q>'I do not wish to play at <name type="GPE">ri</name>ddles. Speak plainer!'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="ORG">'Then</name> if you will have it so, lady,'</q> he said: <q>'you do not go, because only your brother called for you, and to look on the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>, <name type="PERSON">Elen</name>dil's heir, in his t<name type="GPE">ri</name>umph would now b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng you no joy. Or because I do not go, and you desire still to be near me. And maybe for both these reasons, and you yourself cannot choose between them. <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name>, do you not love me, or will you not?'</q></p>
<p><q>'I wished to be loved by another,'</q> she answered. <q>'But I desire no man's pity.'</q></p>
<p><q>'That I know,'</q> he said. <q>'You desired to have the love of the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. Because he was high and puissant, and you wished to have renown and glory and to be lifted far above the mean things that crawl on the <name type="LOC">earth</name>. And as a great captain may to a young soldier he seemed to you admirable. For so he is, a lord among men, the greatest that now is. But when he gave you only understanding and pity, then you desired to have nothing, unless a brave death in battle. <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok at me, <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name>!'</q></p>
<p>And <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name> looked at <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name> long and steadily; and <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name> said: <q>'Do not scorn pity that is the gift of a gentle heart, <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name>! But I do not offer you my pity. For you are a lady high and valiant and have yourself won renown that shall not be forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>; and you are a lady beautiful, I deem, beyond even the words of the <name type="ORG">Elven</name>-tongue to tell. And I love you. Once I pitied your sorrow. But now, were you sorrowless, without fear or any lack, were you the blissful Queen of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>, still I would love you. <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name>, do you not love me?'</q></p>
<p>Then the heart of <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name> changed, or else at last she understood it. And suddenly her <name type="DATE">winter</name> passed, and the sun sh<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> on her.</p>
<p>I stand in Minas <name type="GPE">Anor</name>, the <name type="FAC">Tower</name> of the <name type="ORG">Sun</name>, she said; and behold the <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name> has departed! I will be a shieldmaiden no longer, nor vie with the great <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s, nor take joy only in the songs of slaying. I will be a healer, and love all things that grow and are not barren.<q>' And again she looked at <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name>. <name type="DATE">'No</name> longer do I desire to be a queen,'</q> she said.</p>
<p>Then <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name> laughed mer<name type="GPE">ri</name>ly. <q>'That is well,'</q> he said; <q>'for I am not a king. Yet I will wed with the White <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>, if it be her will. And if she will, then let us cross the <name type="LOC">River</name> and in happier <name type="DATE">day</name>s let us dwell in fair <name type="ORG">Ithil</name>ien and there make a garden. All things will grow with joy there, if the White <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> comes.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="ORG">'Then</name> must I leave my own people, man of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>?'</q> she said. <q><name type="PERSON">'And</name> would you have your proud folk say of you: There goes a lord who tamed a wild shieldmaiden of the <name type="LOC">North</name>! Was there no woman of the race of N�menor to choose?'</q></p>
<p><q>'I would,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name>. And he took her in his arms and kissed her under the sunlit sky, and he cared not that they stood high upon the walls in the sight of many. And many indeed saw them and the light that sh<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> about them as they came down from the walls and went hand in hand to the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>uses of Healing.</p>
<p>And to the <name type="ORG">Warden</name> of the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>uses <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name> said: <q><name type="CARDINAL">'He</name>re is the <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name> of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>, and now she is healed.'</q></p>
<p>And the <name type="ORG">Warden</name> said: <q><name type="ORG">'Then</name> I release her from my charge and bid her farewell, and may she suffer never hurt nor sickness again. I commend her to the care of the <name type="ORG">Steward</name> of the <name type="LOC">City</name>, until her brother returns.'</q></p>
<p>But <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name> said: <q><name type="DATE">'Yet</name> now that I have leave to depart, I would remain. For this <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>use has become to me of all dwellings the most blessed.'</q> And she remained there until <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g �omer came.</p>
<p>All things were now made ready in the <name type="LOC">City</name>; and there was great concourse of people, for the tidings had g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> out into all parts of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>, from <name type="GPE">Min-<name type="PERSON">Rimmon</name></name> even to <name type="PERSON">Pinnath Gelin</name> and the far coasts of the sea; and all that could come to the <name type="LOC">City</name> made haste to come. And the <name type="LOC">City</name> was filled again with women and fair children that returned to their homes laden with flowers; and from Dol <name type="PERSON">Amroth</name> came the harpers that harped most skilfully in all the land; and there were players upon viols and upon flutes and upon horns of silver, and clear-voiced singers from the <name type="GPE">vale</name>s of <name type="ORG">Lebennin</name>.</p>
<p>At last an <name type="TIME">evening</name> came when from the walls the pavilions could be seen upon the field, and <name type="TIME">all <name type="TIME">night</name></name> lights were burning as men watched for the <name type="TIME">dawn</name>. And when the sun rose in the clear <name type="TIME">morning</name> above the mountains in the <name type="LOC">East</name>, upon which shadows lay no more, then all the bells rang, and all the banners broke and flowed in the wind; and upon the White <name type="FAC">Tower</name> of the citadel the standard of the <name type="ORG">Steward</name>s, b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght argent like snow in the sun, bea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng no charge nor device, was raised over <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> for the last time.</p>
<p>Now the Captains of the <name type="LOC">West</name> led their host towards the <name type="LOC">City</name>, and folk saw them advance in line upon line, flashing and glinting in the sun<name type="GPE">ri</name>se and <name type="GPE">ri</name>ppling like silver. And so they came before the <name type="FAC">Gate</name>way and halted a furlong from the walls. As yet no gates had been set up again, but a bar<name type="GPE">ri</name>er was laid across the entrance to the <name type="LOC">City</name>, and there stood men at arms in silver and black with long swords drawn. Before the bar<name type="GPE">ri</name>er stood <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name> the <name type="ORG">Steward</name>, and H�<name type="GPE">ri</name>n <name type="ORG">Warden</name> of the Keys, and other captains of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>, and the <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name> of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> with <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name>helm the Marshal and many k<name type="TIME">night</name>s of the <name type="PERSON">Mark</name>; and upon either side of the <name type="FAC">Gate</name> was a great press of fair people in raiment of many colours and garlands of flowers.</p>
<p>So now there was a wide space before the walls of Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name>, and it was hemmed in upon all sides by the k<name type="TIME">night</name>s and the soldiers of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> and of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>, and by the people of the <name type="LOC">City</name> and of all parts of the land. A hush fell upon all as out from the host stepped the D�nedain in silver and grey; and before them came walking slow the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. He was clad in black mail girt with silver, and he wore a long mantle of pure white clasped at the throat with a great jewel of green that sh<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> from afar; but his head was bare save for a star upon his forehead bound by a slender fillet of silver. With him were �omer of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>, and the P<name type="GPE">ri</name>nce <name type="PERSON">Imrahil</name>, and <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> robed all in white, and <name type="CARDINAL">four</name> small figures that many men <name type="PERSON">mar</name>velled to see.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Nay</name>, cousin! they are not boys,'</q> said <name type="ORG">Ioreth</name> to her kinswoman from <name type="ORG">Imloth Melui</name>, who stood beside her. <q><name type="PERSON">'Those</name> are _Pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ain_, out of the far country of the <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>flings, where they are p<name type="GPE">ri</name>nces of great fame, it is said. I should know, for I had <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> to <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>d in the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>uses. They are small, but they are valiant. Why, cousin, <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of them went with only his esquire into the <name type="ORG">Black</name> Country and fought with the Dark <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd all by himself, and set fire to his <name type="FAC">Tower</name>, if you can believe it. At least that is the tale in the <name type="LOC">City</name>. That will be the <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> that walks with our <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name>st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. They are dear f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends, I hear. Now he is a <name type="PERSON">mar</name>vel, the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name>st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>: not too soft in his speech, mind you, but he has a golden heart, as the saying is; and he has the healing hands. The hands of the king are the hands of a healer, I said; and that was how it was all discovered. And <name type="LOC">Mithrandir</name>, he said to me: <name type="ORG">Ioreth</name>, men will long remember your words, and-'</q></p>
<p>But <name type="ORG">Ioreth</name> was not permitted to continue the instruction of her kinswoman from the country, for a single trumpet rang, and a dead silence followed. Then forth from the <name type="FAC">Gate</name> went <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name> with H�<name type="GPE">ri</name>n of the Keys, and no others, save that behind them walked <name type="CARDINAL">four</name> men in the high helms and armour of the <name type="ORG">Citadel</name>, and they bore a great casket of black _lebethron_ bound with silver.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Faramir</name> met <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> in the midst of those there assembled, and he knelt, and said: <q>'The last <name type="ORG">Steward</name> of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> begs leave to surrender his office.'</q> And he held out a white rod; but <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> took the rod and gave it back, saying: <q>'That office is not ended, and it shall be thine and thy heirs' as long as my line shall <name type="DATE">last.</name> Do now thy office!'</q></p>
<p>Then <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name> stood up and spoke in a clear voice: <q>'<name type="ORG">Men</name> of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> hear now the <name type="ORG">Steward</name> of this Realm! Behold! <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> has come to claim the kingship again at <name type="DATE">last.</name> Here is <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> son of <name type="ORG">Arathorn</name>, chieftain of the D�nedain of <name type="PERSON">Arnor</name>, Captain of the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>st of the <name type="LOC">West</name>, bearer of the Star of the <name type="LOC">North</name>, wielder of the <name type="PRODUCT">Sword</name> Reforged, victo<name type="GPE">ri</name>ous in battle, whose hands b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng healing, the <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name>st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, <name type="ORG">Elessar</name> of the line of <name type="GPE">Valandil</name>, <name type="ORG">Isildur</name>'s son, <name type="PERSON">Elen</name>dil's son of N�menor. Shall he be king and enter into the <name type="LOC">City</name> and dwell there?'</q></p>
<p>And all the host and all the people c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed _yea_ with <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> voice.</p>
<p>And <name type="ORG">Ioreth</name> said to her kinswoman: <q>'This is just a ceremony such as we have in the <name type="LOC">City</name>, cousin; for he has already entered, as I was telling you; and he said to me-'</q> And then again she was obliged to silence, for <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name> spoke again.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="ORG">Men</name> of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>, the <name type="ORG">loremaster</name>s tell that it was the cus<name type="PERSON">tom</name> of old that the king should receive the crown from his father ere he died; or if that might not be, that he should go al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> and take it from the hands of his father in the <name type="PERSON">tom</name>b where he was laid. But since things must now be d<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> otherwise, using the autho<name type="GPE">ri</name>ty of the <name type="ORG">Steward</name>, I have to<name type="DATE">day</name> brought hither from <name type="ORG">Rath D�nen</name> the crown of E�rnur the last king, whose <name type="DATE">day</name>s passed in the time of our longfathers of old.'</q></p>
<p>Then the guards stepped forward, and <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name> opened the casket, and he held up an ancient crown. It was shaped like the helms of the <name type="ORG">Guard</name>s of the <name type="ORG">Citadel</name>, save that it was loftier, and it was all white, and the wings at either side were wrought of pearl and silver in the likeness of the wings of a sea-bird, for it was the emblem of kings who came over the <name type="LOC">Sea</name>; and <name type="CARDINAL">seven</name> gems of adamant were set in the circlet, and upon its summit was set a single jewel the light of which went up like a flame.</p>
<p>Then <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> took the crown and held it up and said:</p>
<p>_Et E�rello <name type="PERSON">Endorenna ut</name>�lien. <name type="ORG">Sinome</name> <name type="PERSON">mar</name>uvan ar Hildinyar <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>n' <name type="LOC">Ambar</name>-metta!_</p>
<p>And those were the words that <name type="PERSON">Elen</name>dil spoke when he came up out of the <name type="LOC">Sea</name> on the wings of the wind: <q>'Out of the Great <name type="LOC">Sea</name> to <name type="LOC">Middle-<name type="LOC">earth</name></name> I am come. In this place will I abide, and my heirs, unto the ending of the world.'</q></p>
<p>Then to the wonder of many <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> did not put the crown upon his head, but gave it back to <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name>, and said: <q>'By the labour and valour of many I have come into my inhe<name type="GPE">ri</name>tance. In token of this I would have the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>-bearer b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng the crown to me, and let <name type="LOC">Mithrandir</name> set it upon my head, if he will; for he has been the mover of all that has been accomplished, and this is his victory.'</q></p>
<p>Then <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> came forward and took the crown from <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name> and bore it to <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>; and <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> knelt, and <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> set the White <name type="PRODUCT">Crown</name> upon his head, and said:</p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'No</name>w come the <name type="DATE">day</name>s of the <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g, and may they be blessed while the thr<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s of the <name type="NORP">Valar</name> endure!'</q></p>
<p>But when <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> arose all that beheld him gazed in silence, for it seemed to them that he was revealed to them now for the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> time. Tall as the sea-kings of old, he stood above all that were near; ancient of <name type="DATE">day</name>s he seemed and yet in the flower of manhood; and wisdom sat upon his brow, and strength and healing were in his hands, and a light was about him. And then <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed:</p>
<p><q>'Behold the <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g!'</q></p>
<p>And in that moment all the trumpets were blown, and the <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g <name type="ORG">Elessar</name> went forth and came to the bar<name type="GPE">ri</name>er, and H�<name type="GPE">ri</name>n of the Keys thrust it back; and amid the music of harp and of viol and of flute and the singing of clear voices the <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g passed through the flower-laden streets, and came to the <name type="ORG">Citadel</name>, and entered in; and the banner of the <name type="PERSON">Tree</name> and the <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Stars</name> was unfurled upon the topmost tower, and the reign of <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g <name type="ORG">Elessar</name> began, of which many songs have told.</p>
<p>In his time the <name type="LOC">City</name> was made more fair than it had ever been, even in the <name type="DATE">day</name>s of its <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> glory; and it was filled with trees and with fountains, and its gates were wrought of <name type="PERSON">mith<name type="GPE">ri</name>l</name> and steel, and its streets were paved with white <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ble; and the Folk of the <name type="LOC">Mountain</name> laboured in it, and the Folk of the <name type="PERSON">Wood</name> rejoiced to come there; and all was healed and made good, and the houses were filled with men and women and the laughter of children, and no window was blind nor any courtyard empty; and after the ending of the <name type="ORDINAL">Third</name> Age of the world into the new age it preserved the memory and the glory of <name type="DATE">the <name type="DATE">year</name></name>s that were g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>.</p>
<p>In the <name type="DATE">day</name>s that followed his crowning the <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g sat on his thr<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> in the <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>l of the <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>gs and pronounced his judgements. And embassies came from many lands and peoples, from the <name type="LOC">East</name> and the <name type="LOC">South</name>, and from the borders of <name type="GPE">Mirkwood</name>, and from <name type="GPE">Dunland</name> in the west. And the <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g pard<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>d the <name type="LOC">East</name>erlings that had given themselves up, and sent them away free, and he made peace with the peoples of <name type="ORG">Harad</name>; and the slaves of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> he released and gave to them all the lands about <name type="LOC">Lake N</name>�rnen to be their own. And there were brought before him many to receive his praise and reward for their valour; and last the captain of the <name type="ORG">Guard</name> brought to him <name type="PERSON">Beregond</name> to be judged.</p>
<p>And the <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g said to <name type="PERSON">Beregond</name>: '<name type="PERSON">Beregond</name>, by your sword blood was spilled in the <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>lows, where that is forbidden. Also you left your post without leave of <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd or of Captain. For these things, of old, death was the penalty. Now therefore I must pronounce your doom.</p>
<p><q><name type="PERSON">'All</name> penalty is remitted for your valour in battle, and still more because all that you did was for the love of the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name>. N<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>theless you must leave the <name type="ORG">Guard</name> of the <name type="ORG">Citadel</name>, and you must go forth from the <name type="LOC">City</name> of Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name>.'</q></p>
<p>Then the blood left <name type="PERSON">Beregond</name>'s face, and he was st<name type="GPE">ri</name>cken to the heart and bowed his head. But the <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g said.:</p>
<p><q><name type="CARDINAL">'So</name> it must be, for you are appointed to the White <name type="ORG">Company</name>, the <name type="ORG">Guard</name> of <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name>, P<name type="GPE">ri</name>nce of <name type="ORG">Ithil</name>ien, and you shall be its captain and dwell in <name type="PERSON">Emyn Arnen</name> in honour and peace, and in the service of him for whom you <name type="GPE">ri</name>sked all, to save him from death.'</q></p>
<p>And then <name type="PERSON">Beregond</name>, perceiving the mercy and justice of the <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g, was glad, and kneeling kissed his hand, and departed in joy and con<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>t. And <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> gave to <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name> <name type="ORG">Ithil</name>ien to be his p<name type="GPE">ri</name>ncedom, and bade him dwell in the <name type="ORG">hill</name>s of <name type="PERSON">Emyn Arnen</name> within sight of the <name type="LOC">City</name>.</p>
<p><q>'For,'</q> said he, <q>'Minas <name type="ORG">Ithil</name> in <name type="PERSON">Morgul</name> Vale shall be utterly destroyed, and though it may in time to come be made clean, no man may dwell there for many <name type="DATE">long <name type="DATE">year</name>s</name>.'</q></p>
<p>And last of all <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> greeted �omer of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>, and they embraced, and <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> said: <q>'Between us there can be no word of giving or taking, nor of reward; for we are brethren. In <name type="TIME">happy <name type="TIME">hour</name></name> did <name type="PERSON">Eorl</name> <name type="GPE">ri</name>de from the <name type="LOC">North</name>, and never has any league of peoples been more blessed, so that neither has ever failed the other, nor shall fail. Now, as you know, we have laid Th�oden the Renowned in a <name type="PERSON">tom</name>b in the <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>lows, and there he shall lie for ever among the <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>gs of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>, if you will. Or if you desire it, we will come to <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> and b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng him back to rest with his own people.'</q></p>
<p>And �omer answered: <q>'Since the <name type="DATE">day</name> when you rose before me out of the green grass of the downs I have loved you, and that love shall not fail. But now I must depart for a while to my own realm, where there is much to heal and set in order. But as for the Fallen, when all is made ready we will return for him; but here let him sleep a while.'</q></p>
<p>And <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name> said to <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name>: <q><name type="DATE">'No</name>w I must go back to my own land and look on it once again, and help my brother in his labour; but when <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> whom I long loved as father is laid at last to rest, I will return.'</q></p>
<p>So the glad <name type="DATE">day</name>s passed; and on the <name type="CARDINAL">eight</name>h <name type="DATE">day</name> of <name type="DATE">May</name> the <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> made ready, and rode off by the <name type="LOC">North</name>-way, and with them went the sons of <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name>. All the road was lined with people to do them honour and praise them, from the <name type="FAC">Gate</name> of the <name type="LOC">City</name> to the walls of the <name type="ORG">Pelennor</name>. Then all others that dwelt afar went back to their homes rejoicing; but in the <name type="LOC">City</name> there was labour of many willing hands to rebuild and renew and to remove all the scars of war and the memory of the darkness.</p>
<p>The hobbits still remained in Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name>, with <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> and <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>; for <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> was loth for the fellowship to be dissolved. <q><name type="CARDINAL">'At</name> last all such things must end,'</q> he said, <q>'but I would have you wait a little while longer: for the end of the deeds that you have shared in has not yet come. <name type="DATE">A <name type="DATE">day</name></name> draws near that I have looked for in <name type="DATE">all <name type="DATE">the <name type="DATE">year</name></name>s</name> of my manhood, and when it comes I would have my f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends beside me.'</q> But of that <name type="DATE">day</name> he would say no more.</p>
<p>In those <name type="DATE">day</name>s the <name type="ORG">Companions</name> of the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> dwelt together in a fair house with <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, and they went to and fro as they wished. And <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> said to <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>: <q>'Do you know what this <name type="DATE">day</name> is that <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> speaks of? For we are happy here, and I don't wish to go; but the <name type="DATE">day</name>s are running away, and <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> is waiting; and the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> is my home.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'As</name> for <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, <q>'he is waiting for the same <name type="DATE">day</name>, and he knows what keeps you. And as for the passing of the <name type="DATE">day</name>s, it is now only <name type="DATE">May</name> and high <name type="DATE">summer</name> is not yet in; and though all things may seem changed, as if an age of the world had g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> by, yet to the trees and the grass it is less than <name type="DATE">a <name type="DATE">year</name></name> since you set out.'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, <q>'didn't you say that <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> was less close than of old? He was weary of his labours then, I think. Now he is recove<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng.'</q></p>
<p>And <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> said: <q>'Many folk like to know beforehand what is to be set on the table; but those who have laboured to prepare the feast like to keep their <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret; for wonder makes the words of praise louder. And <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> himself waits for a sign.'</q></p>
<p>There came <name type="DATE">a <name type="DATE">day</name></name> when <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> could not be found, and the <name type="ORG">Companions</name> wondered what was going forward. But <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> took <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> out from the <name type="LOC">City</name> by <name type="TIME">night</name>, and he brought him to the southern feet of Mount <name type="GPE">Min<name type="PERSON">dol</name>luin</name>; and there they found a path made in <name type="DATE">ages past</name> that few now dared to tread. For it led up on to the mountain to a high hallow where only the kings had been wont to go. And they went up by steep ways, until they came to a high field below the snows that clad the lofty peaks, and it looked down over the precipice that stood behind the <name type="LOC">City</name>. And standing there they surveyed the lands, for the <name type="TIME">morning</name> was come; and they saw the towers of the <name type="LOC">City</name> far below them like white pencils touched by the sunlight, and all the Vale of <name type="GPE">Anduin</name> was like a garden, and the <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s of <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name> were veiled in a golden mist. Upon the <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> side their sight reached to the grey <name type="ORG">Emyn Muil</name>, and the glint of <name type="PERSON">Rauros</name> was like a star twinkling far off; and upon the other side they saw the <name type="LOC">River</name> like a <name type="GPE">ri</name>bbon laid down to <name type="NORP">Pelargir</name>, and beyond that was a light on the hem of the sky that spoke of the <name type="LOC">Sea</name>.</p>
<p>And <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> said: <q>'This is your realm, and the heart of the greater realm that shall be. The <name type="ORDINAL">Third</name> Age of the world is ended, and the new age is begun; and it is your task to order its beginning and to preserve what may be preserved. For though much has been saved, much must now pass away; and the power of the <name type="PERSON">Thr</name>ee <name type="ORG">Ring</name>s also is ended. And all the lands that you see, and those that lie round about them, shall be dwellings of <name type="ORG">Men</name>. For the time comes of the Dominion of <name type="ORG">Men</name>, and the Elder <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>dred shall fade or depart.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I know it well, dear f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>; <q>'but I would still have your counsel.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'No</name>t for long now,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'The <name type="ORDINAL">Third</name> Age was my age. I was the Enemy of <name type="ORG">Sauron</name>; and my work is finished. I shall go soon. The burden must lie now upon you and your kindred.'</q></p>
<p><q>'But I shall die,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'For I am a mortal man, and though being what I am and of the race of the <name type="LOC">West</name> unmingled, I shall have life far longer than other men, yet that is but a little while; and when those who are now in the wombs of women are born and have grown old, I too shall grow old. And who then shall govern <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> and those who look to this <name type="LOC">City</name> as to their queen, if my desire be not granted? The <name type="PERSON">Tree</name> in <name type="ORG">the Court of the Fountain</name> is still withered and barren. When shall I see a sign that it will ever be otherwise?'</q></p>
<p><q>'Turn your face from the green world, and look where all seems barren and cold!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>.</p>
<p>Then <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> turned. and there was a stony slope behind him running down from the skirts of the snow; and as he looked he was aware that al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> there in the waste a growing thing stood. And he climbed to it, and saw that out of the very edge of the snow there sprang a sapling tree <name type="CARDINAL">no more than <name type="CARDINAL">three</name></name> foot high. Already it had put forth young leaves long and shapely, dark above and silver beneath, and upon its slender crown it bore <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> small cluster of flowers whose white petals sh<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> like the sunlit snow.</p>
<p>Then <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed: <q>'_Y�! ut�vienyes!_ I have found it! <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>! here is a scion of the Eldest of <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>s! But how comes it here? For it is not itself yet <name type="CARDINAL">seven</name> <name type="DATE">year</name>s old.'</q></p>
<p>And <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> coming looked at it, and said: <q>'Ve<name type="GPE">ri</name>ly this is a sapling of the line of <name type="ORG">Nimloth</name> the fair; and that was a seedling of Galathilion, and that a fruit of Telpe<name type="GPE">ri</name>on of many names, Eldest of <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>s. Who shall say how it comes here in the appointed <name type="TIME">hour</name>? But this is an ancient hallow, and ere the kings failed or the <name type="PERSON">Tree</name> withered in the court, a fruit must have been set here. For it is said that, though the fruit of the <name type="PERSON">Tree</name> comes seldom to <name type="GPE">ri</name>peness, yet the life within may then lie sleeping through many <name type="DATE">long <name type="DATE">year</name>s</name>, and n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> can foretell the time in which it will awake. Remember this. For if ever a fruit <name type="GPE">ri</name>pens, it should be planted, lest the line die out of the world. Here it has lain. hidden on the mountain, even as the race of <name type="PERSON">Elen</name>dil lay hidden in the wastes of the <name type="LOC">North</name>. Yet the line of <name type="ORG">Nimloth</name> is older far than your line, <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g <name type="ORG">Elessar</name>.'</q></p>
<p>Then <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> laid his hand gently to the sapling, and lo! it seemed to hold only lightly to the <name type="LOC">earth</name>, and it was removed without hurt; and <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> bore it back to the <name type="ORG">Citadel</name>. Then the withered tree was uprooted, but with reverence; and they did not burn it, but laid it to rest in the silence of <name type="ORG">Rath D�nen</name>. And <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> planted the new tree in the court by the fountain, and swiftly and gladly it began to grow; and when the month of <name type="DATE">June</name> entered in it was laden with blossom.</p>
<p><q>'The sign has been given,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>, <q>'and the <name type="DATE">day</name> is not far off.'</q> And he set watchmen upon the walls.</p>
<p>It was the <name type="DATE">day</name> before <name type="DATE">Mid<name type="DATE">summer</name></name> when messengers came from <name type="PERSON">Amon Dn</name> to the <name type="LOC">City</name>, and they said that there was a <name type="GPE">ri</name>ding of fair folk out of the <name type="LOC">North</name>, and they drew near now to the walls of the <name type="ORG">Pelennor</name>. And the <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g said: <q><name type="CARDINAL">'At</name> last they have come. Let all the <name type="LOC">City</name> be made ready!'</q></p>
<p>Upon the very Eve of <name type="DATE">Mid<name type="DATE">summer</name></name>, when the sky was blue as sapphire and white stars opened in the <name type="LOC">East</name>, but the <name type="LOC">West</name> was still golden and the air was cool and fragrant, the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ders came down the <name type="LOC">North</name>-way to the gates of Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name>. <name type="ORDINAL">First</name> rode <name type="ORG">Elrohir</name> and <name type="ORG">Elladan</name> with a banner of silver, and then came <name type="PERSON">Glorfindel</name> and <name type="PRODUCT">Erestor</name> and all the household of <name type="GPE">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name>, and after them came the <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> <name type="PERSON">Galad<name type="GPE">ri</name>el</name> and <name type="EVENT">Celeborn</name>, <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd of <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>thl�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en, <name type="GPE">ri</name>ding upon white <name type="PERSON">steed</name>s and with them many fair folk of their land, grey-cloaked with white gems in their <name type="PERSON">hai</name>r; and last came Master <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name>, mighty among <name type="ORG">Elves</name> and <name type="ORG">Men</name>, bea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng the sceptre of <name type="PERSON">Ann�minas</name>, and beside him upon a <name type="ORG">grey palfrey</name> rode <name type="PERSON">Arwen</name> his daughter, <name type="ORG">Evenstar</name> of her people.</p>
<p>And <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> when he saw her come glimme<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng in the <name type="TIME">evening</name>, with stars on her brow and a sweet fragrance about her, was moved with great wonder, and he said to <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>: <q><name type="CARDINAL">'At</name> last I understand why we have waited! This is the ending. Now not <name type="DATE">day</name> only shall be beloved, but <name type="TIME">night</name> too shall be beautiful and blessed and all its fear pass away!'</q></p>
<p>Then the <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g welcomed his guests, and they alighted; and <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name> surrendered the sceptre, and laid the hand of his daughter in the hand of the <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g, and together they went up into the High <name type="LOC">City</name>, and all the stars flowered in the sky. And <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> the <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g <name type="ORG">Elessar</name> wedded <name type="PERSON">Arwen</name> <name type="ORG">Und�miel</name> in the <name type="LOC">City</name> of the <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>gs upon the <name type="DATE">day</name> of <name type="DATE">Mid<name type="DATE">summer</name></name>, and the tale of their long waiting and labours was come to fulfilment.</p>
</chapter><chapter num="6"><heading>Chapter 6</heading>
<p>Many Partings</p>
<p>When the <name type="DATE">day</name>s of rejoicing were over at last the <name type="ORG">Companions</name> thought of returning to their own homes. And <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> went to the <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g as he was sitting with the Queen <name type="PERSON">Arwen</name> by the fountain, and she sang a song of <name type="PRODUCT">Valinor</name>, while the <name type="PERSON">Tree</name> grew and blossomed. They welcomed <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and rose to greet him; and <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> said:</p>
<p><q>'I know what you have come to say, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>: you wish to return to your own home. Well, dearest f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end, the tree grows best in the land of its sires; but for you in all the lands of the <name type="LOC">West</name> there will ever be a welcome. And though your people have had little fame in the legends of the great, they will now have more renown than any wide realms that are no more.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'It</name> is true that I wish to go back to the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'But <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> I must go to <name type="GPE">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name>. For if there could be anything <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ting in a time so blessed, I missed <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>; and I was g<name type="GPE">ri</name>eved when among all the household of <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name> I saw that he was not come.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Do you wonder at that, <name type="ORG">Ring</name>-bearer?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Arwen</name>. <q>'For you know the power of that thing which is now destroyed; and all that was d<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> by that power is now passing away. But your kinsman possessed this thing longer than you. He is ancient in <name type="DATE">year</name>s now, according to his kind; and he awaits you, for he will not again make any long journey save <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="ORG">'Then</name> I beg leave to depart soon,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.</p>
<p><q>'In <name type="CARDINAL">seven</name> <name type="DATE">day</name>s we will go,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'For we shall <name type="GPE">ri</name>de with you far on the road, even as far as the country of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>. In <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> <name type="DATE">day</name>s now �omer will return hither to bear Th�oden back to rest in the <name type="PERSON">Mark</name>, and we shall <name type="GPE">ri</name>de with him to honour <name type="DATE">the fall</name>en. But now before you go I will confirm the words that <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name> spoke to you, and you are made free for ever of the realm of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>; and all your companions likewise. And if there were any gifts that I could give to match with your deeds you should have them; but whatever you desire you shall take with you, and you shall <name type="GPE">ri</name>de in honour and arrayed as p<name type="GPE">ri</name>nces of the land.'</q></p>
<p>But the Queen <name type="PERSON">Arwen</name> said: <q>'A gift I will give you. For I am the daughter of <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name>. I shall not go with him now when he departs to the <name type="GPE">Haven</name>s; for mine is the choice of L�thien, and as she so have I chosen, both the sweet and the bitter. But in my stead you shall go, <name type="ORG">Ring</name>-bearer, when the time comes, and if you then desire it. If your hurts g<name type="GPE">ri</name>eve you still and the memory of your burden is heavy, then you may pass into the <name type="LOC">West</name>, until all your wounds and wea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ness are healed. But wear this now in memory of <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name>st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> and <name type="ORG">Evenstar</name> with whom your life has been woven!'</q></p>
<p>And she took a white gem like a star that lay upon her breast hanging upon a silver c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>n, and she set the c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>n about <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s neck. <q>'When the memory of the fear and the darkness troubles you,'</q> she said, <q>'this will b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng you aid.'</q></p>
<p>In <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> <name type="DATE">day</name>s, as the <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g had said, �omer of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> came <name type="GPE">ri</name>ding to the <name type="LOC">City</name>, and with him came an _�ored_ of the fairest k<name type="TIME">night</name>s of the <name type="PERSON">Mark</name>. He was welcomed; and when they sat all at table in <name type="GPE">Merethrond</name>, the Great <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>l of Feasts, he beheld the beauty of the ladies that he saw and was filled with great wonder. And before he went to his rest he sent for <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> the <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Dwarf</name>, and he said to him: <q>'<name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> <name type="PRODUCT">Gl�</name>in's son, have you your axe ready?'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Nay</name>, lord,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>, <q>'but I can speedily fetch it, if there be need.'</q></p>
<p><q>'You shall judge,'</q> said �omer. <q>'For there are certain rash words concerning the <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> in the Golden <name type="PERSON">Wood</name> that lie still between us. And now I have seen her with my eyes.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Well, lord,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>, <q>'and what say you now?'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Alas</name>!'</q> said �omer. <q>'I will not say that she is the fairest lady that lives.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="ORG">'Then</name> I must go for my axe,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>.</p>
<p><q>'But <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> I will plead this excuse,'</q> said �omer. <q>'Had I seen her in other company, I would have said all that you could wish. But now I will put Queen <name type="PERSON">Arwen</name> <name type="ORG">Evenstar</name> <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>, and I am ready to do battle on my own part with any who deny me. Shall I call for my sword?'</q></p>
<p>Then <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> bowed low. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Nay</name>, you are excused for my part, lord,'</q> he said. <q>'You have chosen the Evening; but my love is given to the <name type="TIME">Morning</name>. And my heart <name type="PERSON">forebode</name>s that soon it will past away for ever.'</q></p>
<p>At last the <name type="DATE">day</name> of departure came, and a great and fair company made ready to <name type="GPE">ri</name>de north from the <name type="LOC">City</name>. Then the kings of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> and <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> went to the <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>lows and they came to the <name type="PERSON">tom</name>bs in <name type="ORG">Rath D�nen</name>, and they bore away <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g Th�oden upon a golden bier, and passed through the <name type="LOC">City</name> in silence. Then they laid the bier upon a great <name type="PERSON">wain</name> with <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> all about it and his banner borne before; and <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> being Th�oden's esquire rode upon the <name type="PERSON">wain</name> and kept the arms of the king.</p>
<p>For the other <name type="ORG">Companions</name> <name type="PERSON">steed</name>s were furnished according to their stature; and <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>wise rode at <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>'s side, and <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> rode upon <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>fax, and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> rode with the k<name type="TIME">night</name>s of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>; and <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> and <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> as ever rode together upon <name type="GPE">Arod</name>.</p>
<p>In that <name type="GPE">ri</name>ding went also Queen <name type="PERSON">Arwen</name>, and <name type="EVENT">Celeborn</name> and <name type="PERSON">Galad<name type="GPE">ri</name>el</name> with their folk, and <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name> and his sons; and the p<name type="GPE">ri</name>nces of Dol <name type="PERSON">Amroth</name> and of <name type="ORG">Ithil</name>ien, and many captains and k<name type="TIME">night</name>s. Never had any king of the <name type="PERSON">Mark</name> such company upon the road as went with Th�oden <name type="PERSON">Thengel</name>'s son to the land of his home.</p>
<p>Without haste and at peace they passed into <name type="PERSON">An�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en</name>, and they came to the <name type="ORG">Grey</name> <name type="PERSON">Wood</name> under <name type="PERSON">Amon Dn</name>; and there they heard a sound as of drums beating in the <name type="ORG">hill</name>s, though no living thing could be seen. Then <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> let the trumpets be blown; and heralds c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed:</p>
<p><q>'Behold the <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g <name type="ORG">Elessar</name> is come! The <name type="ORG">Forest</name> of Dr�adan he gives to <name type="PERSON">Gh�n</name>-bu<name type="GPE">ri</name>-gh�n and to his folk, to be their own for ever; and hereafter let no man enter it without their leave!'</q></p>
<p>Then the drums rolled loudly, and were silent.</p>
<p>At length after <name type="CARDINAL">fifteen</name> <name type="DATE">day</name>s of journey the <name type="PERSON">wain</name> of <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g Th�oden passed through the green fields of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> and came to <name type="ORG">Edoras</name>; and there they all rested. The Golden <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>l was arrayed with fair hangings and it was filled with light, and there was held the highest feast that it had known since the <name type="DATE">day</name>s of its building. For after <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> <name type="DATE">day</name>s the <name type="ORG">Men</name> of the <name type="PERSON">Mark</name> prepared the funeral of Th�oden; and he was laid in a house of st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> with his arms and many other fair things that he had possessed, and over him was raised a great mound, covered with green turves of grass and of white evermind. And now there were <name type="CARDINAL">eight</name> mounds on the east-side of the <name type="ORG">Barrow</name>field.</p>
<p>Then the <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s of the <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g's <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>use upon white horses rode round about the barrow and sang together a song of Th�oden <name type="PERSON">Thengel</name>'s son that <name type="PRODUCT">Gl�</name>owine his minstrel made, and he made no other song after. The slow voices of the <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s stirred the hearts even of those who did not know the speech of that people; but the words of the song brought a light to the eyes of the folk of the <name type="PERSON">Mark</name> as they heard again afar the thunder of the hooves of the <name type="LOC">North</name> and the voice of <name type="PERSON">Eorl</name> crying above the battle upon the Field of <name type="PERSON">Celebrant</name>; and the tale of the kings rolled on, and the horn of <name type="PERSON">Helm</name> was loud in the mountains, until the <name type="PRODUCT">Darkness</name> came and <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g Th�oden arose and rode through the <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name> to the fire, and died in splendour, even as the <name type="ORG">Sun</name>, returning beyond hope, gleamed upon <name type="GPE">Min<name type="PERSON">dol</name>luin</name> in the <name type="TIME">morning</name>.</p>
<p>_Out of doubt, out of dark, to the <name type="DATE">day</name>'s <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing</p>
<p>he rode singing in the sun, sword unsheathing.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Ho</name>pe he rekindled, and in hope ended;</p>
<p>over death, over dread, over doom lifted</p>
<p>out of loss, out of life, unto long glory._</p>
<p>But <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> stood at the foot of the green mound, and he wept, and when the song was ended he arose and c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed:</p>
<p><q>'Th�oden <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g, Th�oden <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g! <name type="PERSON">Farewell</name>! As a father you were to me. for a little while. <name type="PERSON">Farewell</name>!'</q></p>
<p>When the bu<name type="GPE">ri</name>al was over and the weeping of women was stilled, and Th�oden was left at last al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> in his barrow, then folk gathered to the Golden <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>l for the great feast and put away sorrow; for Th�oden had lived to full <name type="DATE">year</name>s and ended in honour no less than the greatest of his sires. And when the time came that in the cus<name type="PERSON">tom</name> of the <name type="PERSON">Mark</name> they should d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk to the memory of the kings, <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name> <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> came forth, golden as the sun and white as snow, and she bore a filled c<name type="CARDINAL">up to</name> �omer.</p>
<p>Then a minstrel and <name type="ORG">loremaster</name> stood up and named all the names of the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rds of the <name type="PERSON">Mark</name> in their order: <name type="PERSON">Eorl</name> the Young; and <name type="ORG">Brego</name> builder of the <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>l; and <name type="PERSON">Aldor</name> brother of <name type="PERSON">Baldor</name> the hapless; and Fr�a, and Fr�awine, and <name type="PERSON">Goldwine</name>, and D�or, and <name type="ORG">Gram</name>; and <name type="PERSON">Helm</name> who lay hid in <name type="PERSON">Helm</name>'s <name type="PERSON">Deep</name> when the <name type="PERSON">Mark</name> was overrun; and so ended the <name type="CARDINAL">nine</name> mounds of the west-side, for in that time the line was broken, and after came the mounds of the east-side: Fr�alaf, <name type="PERSON">Helm</name> s sister-son, and L�ofa, and <name type="PERSON">Walda</name>, and <name type="PERSON">Folca</name>, and <name type="NORP">Folcwine</name>, and <name type="PERSON">Fengel</name>, and <name type="PERSON">Thengel</name>, and Th�oden the latest. And when Th�oden was named �omer drained the cup. Then <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name> bade those that served to fill the cups, and all there assembled rose and drank to the new king, crying: <q><name type="PERSON">'Hail</name>, �omer, <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g of the <name type="PERSON">Mark</name>!'</q></p>
<p>At the last when the feast drew to an end �omer arose and said: <q><name type="DATE">'No</name>w this is the funeral feast of Th�oden the <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g; but I will speak ere we go of tidings of joy, for he would not grudge that I should do so, since he was ever a father of <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name> my sister. Hear then all my guests, fair folk of many realms, such as have never before been gathered in this hall! <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name>, <name type="ORG">Steward</name> of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>, and P<name type="GPE">ri</name>nce of <name type="ORG">Ithil</name>ien, asks that <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name> <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> should be his wife, and she grants it full willing. Therefore they shall be trothplighted before you all.'</q></p>
<p>And <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name> and <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name> stood forth and set hand in hand; and all there drank to them and were glad. <q>'Thus,'</q> said �omer, <q>'is the f<name type="GPE">ri</name>endship of the <name type="PERSON">Mark</name> and of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> bound with a new bond, and the more do I rejoice.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'No</name> niggard are you, �omer,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>, <q>'to give thus to <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> the fairest thing in your realm!'</q></p>
<p>Then <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name> looked in the eyes of <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>, and she said: <q>'Wish me joy, my liege-lord and healer!'</q></p>
<p>And he answered: <q>'I have wished thee joy ever since <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> I saw thee. It heals my heart to see thee now in bliss.'</q></p>
<p>When the feast was over, those who were to go took leave of <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g �omer. <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> and his k<name type="TIME">night</name>s, and the people of L�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en and of <name type="GPE">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name>, made ready to <name type="GPE">ri</name>de; but <name type="PERSON">Faramir</name> and <name type="PERSON">Imrahil</name> remained at <name type="ORG">Edoras</name>; and <name type="PERSON">Arwen</name> <name type="ORG">Evenstar</name> remained also, and she said farewell to her brethren. N<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> saw her last meeting with <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name> her father, for they went up into the <name type="ORG">hill</name>s and there spoke long together, and bitter was their parting that should endure beyond the ends of the world.</p>
<p>At the last before the guests set oat �omer and <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name> came to <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>, and they said: <q>'<name type="PERSON">Farewell</name> now, <name type="PERSON">Me<name type="GPE">ri</name>adoc</name> of the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> and <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>ldwine of the <name type="PERSON">Mark</name>! Ride to good fortune, and <name type="GPE">ri</name>de back soon to our welcome!'</q></p>
<p>And �omer said: <q>'<name type="PERSON">Kin</name>gs of old would have laden you with gifts that a <name type="PERSON">wain</name> could not bear for your deeds upon the fields of <name type="GPE">Mund<name type="GPE">burg</name></name>; and yet you will take naught, you say, but the arms that were given to you. This I suffer, for indeed I have no gift that is worthy; but my sister begs you to receive this small thing, as a memo<name type="GPE">ri</name>al of <name type="PERSON">Dernhelm</name> and of the horns of the <name type="PERSON">Mark</name> at the coming of the <name type="TIME">morning</name>.'</q></p>
<p>Then <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name> gave to <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> an ancient horn, small but cunningly wrought all of fair silver with a bald<name type="GPE">ri</name>c of green; and w<name type="GPE">ri</name>ghts had <name type="PERSON">eng<name type="PERSON">raven</name></name> upon it swift horsemen <name type="GPE">ri</name>ding in a line that wound about it from the tip to the mouth; and there were set runes of great virtue.</p>
<p><q>'This is an heirloom of our house,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name>. <q><name type="DATE">'It</name> was made by the <name type="ORG">Dwarves</name>, and came from the hoard of <name type="ORG">Scatha the <name type="ORG">Worm</name></name>. <name type="PERSON">Eorl</name> the Young brought it from the <name type="LOC">North</name>. He that blows it at need shall set fear in the hearts of his enemies and joy in the hearts of his f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends, and they shall hear him and come to him.'</q></p>
<p>Then <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> took the horn, for it could not be refused, and he kissed <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name>'s hand; and they embraced him, and so they parted for that time.</p>
<p>Now the guests were ready, and they drank the stirrup-cup, and with great praise and f<name type="GPE">ri</name>endship they departed, and came at length to <name type="PERSON">Helm</name>'s <name type="PERSON">Deep</name>, and there they rested <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> <name type="DATE">day</name>s. Then <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> repaid his promise to <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> and went with him to the Glitte<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng Caves; and when they returned he was silent, and would say only that <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> could find fit words to speak of them. <q><name type="PERSON">'And</name> never before has a <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Dwarf</name> claimed a victory over an <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name> in a contest of words,'</q> said he. <q><name type="DATE">'No</name>w therefore let us go to <name type="PERSON">Fangorn</name> and set the score <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght!'</q></p>
<p>From <name type="PERSON">Deep</name>ing-coomb they rode to <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard, and saw how the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s had busied themselves. All the st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>-circle had been thrown down and removed, and the land within was made into a garden filled with orchards and trees, and a stream ran through it; but in the midst of all there was a lake of clear water, and out of it the <name type="FAC">Tower</name> of <name type="PERSON">Orthanc</name> rose still, tall and impregnable, and its black rock was mirrored in the pool.</p>
<p>For a while the travellers sat where once the old gates of <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard had stood, and there were now <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> tall trees like sentinels at the beginning of a green-bordered path that ran towards <name type="PERSON">Orthanc</name>; and they looked in wonder at the work that had been d<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, but no living thing could they see far or near. But presently they heard a voice calling <name type="PERSON">_<name type="PERSON">hoom</name></name>-hom_, <name type="PERSON">_<name type="PERSON">hoom</name></name>-hom_; and there came <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard st<name type="GPE">ri</name>ding down the path to greet them with <name type="GPE">Quickbeam</name> at his side.</p>
<p><q>'Welcome to the <name type="PERSON">Tree</name><name type="PERSON">garth</name> of <name type="PERSON">Orthanc</name>!'</q> he said. <q>'I knew that you were coming, but I was at work up the valley; there is much still to be d<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. But you have not been idle either away in the south and the east, I hear; and all that I hear is good, very good.'</q> Then <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard praised all their deeds, of which he seemed to have full knowledge; and at last he stopped and looked long at <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>.</p>
<p><q>'Well, come now!'</q> he said. <q>'You have proved mightiest, and all your labours have g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> well. Where now would you be going? And why do you come here?'</q></p>
<p><q>'To see how your work goes, my f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, <q>'and to thank you for your aid in all that has been achieved.'</q></p>
<p>_'<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>om_, well, that is fair enough,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard; 'for to be sure <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s have played their part. And not only in dealing with that, <name type="PERSON">_<name type="PERSON">hoom</name></name>_, that accursed tree-slayer that dwelt here. For there was a great inrush of those, _bur�rum_, those evileyed � blackhanded � bowlegged � flinthearted � clawfingered � foulbellied � bloodthirsty, _mo<name type="GPE">ri</name>maite � sincahonda_, <name type="PERSON">_<name type="PERSON">hoom</name></name>_, well, since you are hasty folk and their full name is <name type="DATE">as long as <name type="DATE">year</name>s</name> of torment, those vermin of orcs; and they came over the <name type="LOC">River</name> and down from the <name type="LOC">North</name> and all round the wood of <name type="GPE">Laurelind</name>�<name type="GPE">renan</name>, which they could not get into, thanks to the Great <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s who are here.'</q> He bowed to the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd and <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> of L�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en.</p>
<p><q><name type="PERSON">'And</name> these same foul creatures were more than surp<name type="GPE">ri</name>sed to meet us out on the <name type="ORG">Wold</name>, for they had not heard of us before; though that might be said also of better folk. And not many will remember us, for not many escaped us alive, and the <name type="LOC">River</name> had most of those. But it was well for you, for if they had not met us, then the king of the grassland would not have <name type="GPE">ri</name>dden far, and if he had there would have been no home to return to.'</q></p>
<p><q>'We know it well,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>, <q>'and never shall it be forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> in Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name> or in <name type="ORG">Edoras</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q>'_Never_ is too long a word even for me,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard. <q><name type="DATE">'No</name>t while your kingdoms last, you mean; but they will have to last long indeed to seem long to <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s.'</q></p>
<p><q>'The New Age begins,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, <q>'and in this age it may well prove that the kingdoms of <name type="ORG">Men</name> shall outlast you, <name type="PERSON">Fangorn</name> my f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end. But now come tell me: what of the task that I set you? <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w is <name type="ORG">Saruman</name>? Is he not weary of <name type="PERSON">Orthanc</name> yet? For I do not suppose that he will think you have improved the view from his windows.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard gave <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> a long look, a most cunning look, <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> thought. <q>'Ah!'</q> he said. <q>'I thought you would come to that. Weary of <name type="PERSON">Orthanc</name>? Very weary at last; but not so weary of his tower as he was weary of my voice. _<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>om_! I gave him some long tales, or at least what might be thought long in your speech.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="ORG">'Then</name> why did he stay to lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>? Did you go into <name type="PERSON">Orthanc</name>?'</q> asked <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>.</p>
<p>_'<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>om_, no, not into <name type="PERSON">Orthanc</name>!<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard. 'But he came to his window and lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed, because he could not get news in any other way, and though he hated the news, he was greedy to have it; and I saw that he heard it all. But I added a great many things to the news that it was good for him to think of. He grew very weary. He always was hasty. That was his ruin.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I observe, my good <name type="PERSON">Fangorn</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, <q>'that with great care you say _dwelt_, _was_, _grew_. What about _is_? Is he dead?'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'No</name>, not dead, so far as I know,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard. <q>'But he is g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. Yes, he is g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> <name type="CARDINAL">seven</name> <name type="DATE">day</name>s. I let him go. There was little left of him when he crawled out, and as for that worm-creature of his, he was like a pale shadow. Now do not tell me, <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, that I promised to keep him safe; for I know it. But things have changed since then. And I kept him until he was safe, safe from doing any more harm. You should know that above all I hate the caging of live things, and I will not keep even such creatures as these caged beyond great need. A snake without fangs may crawl where he will.'</q></p>
<p><q>'You may be <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>; <q>'but this snake had still <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> tooth left, I think. He had the poison of his voice, and I guess that he persuaded you, even you <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard, knowing the soft spot in your heart. Well, he is g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, and there is no more to be said. But the <name type="FAC">Tower</name> of <name type="PERSON">Orthanc</name> now goes back to the <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g, to whom it belongs. Though maybe he will not need it.'</q></p>
<p><q>'That will be seen later,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'But I will give to <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s all this valley to do with as they will, so long as they keep a watch upon <name type="PERSON">Orthanc</name> and see that n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> enter it without my leave.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'It</name> is locked,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard. <q>'I made <name type="ORG">Saruman</name> lock it and give me the keys. <name type="GPE">Quickbeam</name> has them.'</q></p>
<p><name type="GPE">Quickbeam</name> bowed like a tree bending in the wind and handed to <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> great black keys of int<name type="GPE">ri</name>cate shape, joined by a <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng of steel. <q><name type="DATE">'No</name>w I thank you once more,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>, <q>'and I bid you farewell. <name type="DATE">May</name> your forest grow again in peace. When this valley is filled there is room and to spare west of the mountains, where once you walked <name type="DATE">long ago</name>.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard's face became sad. <q>'<name type="ORG">Forest</name>s may grow,'</q> he said. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Wood</name>s may spread. But not <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s. There are no <name type="ORG">Ent</name>ings.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'Yet</name> maybe there is now more hope in your search,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'Lands will lie open to you eastward that have long been closed.'</q></p>
<p>But <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard shook his head and said: <q><name type="DATE">'It</name> is far to go. And there are too many <name type="ORG">Men</name> there in these <name type="DATE">day</name>s. But I am forgetting my manners! Will you stay here and rest a while? And maybe there are some that would be pleased to pass through <name type="PERSON">Fangorn</name> <name type="ORG">Forest</name> and so shor<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> their road home?'</q> He looked at <name type="EVENT">Celeborn</name> and <name type="PERSON">Galad<name type="GPE">ri</name>el</name>.</p>
<p>But all save <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> said that they must now take their leave and depart, either south or west. <q><name type="WORK_OF_ART">'<name type="WORK_OF_ART">Come</name></name>, <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. <q><name type="DATE">'No</name>w by <name type="PERSON">Fangorn</name>'s leave I will visit the deep places of the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>wood and see such trees as are nowhere else to be found in <name type="LOC">Middle-<name type="LOC">earth</name></name>. You shall come with me and keep your word; and thus we will journey on together to our own lands in <name type="GPE">Mirkwood</name> and beyond.'</q> To this <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> agreed, though with no great delight, it seemed.</p>
<p><q><name type="CARDINAL">'He</name>re then at last comes the ending of the Fellowship of the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q><name type="DATE">'Yet</name> I hope that ere long you will return to my land with the help that you promised.'</q></p>
<p><q>'We will come, if our own lords allow it,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. <q>'Well, farewell. my hobbits! You should come safe to your own homes now, and I shall not be kept awake for fear of your pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>l. We will send word when we may, and some of us may yet meet at times; but I fear that we shall not all be gathered together ever again.'</q></p>
<p>Then <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard said farewell to each of them in turn, and he bowed <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> times slowly and with great reverence to <name type="EVENT">Celeborn</name> and <name type="PERSON">Galad<name type="GPE">ri</name>el</name>. <q><name type="DATE">'It</name> is long, long since we met by stock or by st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, _A vani<name type="PERSON">mar</name>_, _vanim<name type="ORG">�lion</name> nosta<name type="GPE">ri</name>!_' he said. <name type="DATE">'It</name> is sad that we should meet only thus at the ending. For the world is changing: I feel it in the water, I feel it in the <name type="LOC">earth</name>, and I smell it in the air. I do not think we shall meet again.'</q></p>
<p>And <name type="EVENT">Celeborn</name> said: <q>'I do not know, Eldest.'</q> But <name type="PERSON">Galad<name type="GPE">ri</name>el</name> said: <q><name type="DATE">'No</name>t in <name type="LOC">Middle-<name type="LOC">earth</name></name>, nor until the lands that lie under the wave are lifted up again. Then in the willow-meads of <name type="PERSON">Tasa<name type="GPE">ri</name>nan</name> we may meet in the <name type="DATE">Sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng</name>. <name type="PERSON">Farewell</name>!'</q></p>
<p>Last of all <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> said good-bye to the old <name type="ORG">Ent</name>, and he grew gayer as he looked at them. <q>'Well, my merry folk,'</q> he said, <q>'will you d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk another draught with me before you go?'</q></p>
<p><q>'Indeed we will,'</q> they said, and he took them aside into the shade of <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the trees, and there they saw that a great st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> jar had been set. And <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard filled <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> bowls, and they drank; and they saw his strange eyes looking at them over the <name type="GPE">ri</name>m of his bowl. <q>'Take care take care!'</q> he said. <q>'For you have already grown since I saw you <name type="DATE">last.</name>'</q> And they laughed and drained their bowls.</p>
<p><q>'Well, good-bye!'</q> he said. <q><name type="PERSON">'And</name> don't forget that if you hear any news of the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>wives in your land, you will send word to me.'</q> Then he waved his great hands to all the company and went off into the trees.</p>
<p>The travellers now rode with more speed, and they made their way towards the <name type="ORG">Gap</name> of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>; and <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> took leave of them at last close to that very place where <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> had looked into the <name type="ORG">St<name type="CARDINAL">one</name></name> of <name type="PERSON">Orthanc</name>. The <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbits were g<name type="GPE">ri</name>eved at this parting; for <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> had never failed them and he had been their guide through many pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ls.</p>
<p><q>'I wish we could have a <name type="ORG">St<name type="CARDINAL">one</name></name> that we could see all our f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends in,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>, <q>'and that we could speak to them from far away!'</q></p>
<p><q>'Only <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> now remains that you could use,'</q> answered <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> for you would not wish to see what the <name type="ORG">St<name type="CARDINAL">one</name></name> of Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name> would show you. But the <name type="PERSON">Palant</name>�r of <name type="PERSON">Orthanc</name> the <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g will keep, to see what is passing in his realm, and what his servants are doing. For do not forget, <name type="PERSON">Pereg<name type="GPE">ri</name>n</name> <name type="PERSON">Took</name>, that you are a k<name type="TIME">night</name> of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>, and I do not release you from your service. You are going now on leave, but I may recall you. And remember, dear f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends of the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>, that my realm lies also in the <name type="LOC">North</name>, and I shall come there <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> <name type="DATE">day</name>.'</p>
<p>Then <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> took leave of <name type="EVENT">Celeborn</name> and <name type="PERSON">Galad<name type="GPE">ri</name>el</name>; and the <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> said to him: <q>'<name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name>st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, through darkness you have come to your hope, and have now all your desire. Use well the <name type="DATE">day</name>s!'</q></p>
<p>But <name type="EVENT">Celeborn</name> said: <q>'<name type="PERSON">Kin</name>sman, farewell! <name type="DATE">May</name> your doom be other than mine, and your treasure remain with you to the end!'</q></p>
<p>With that they parted, and it was then the time of sunset; and when after a while they turned and looked back, they saw the <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g of the <name type="LOC">West</name> sitting upon his horse with his k<name type="TIME">night</name>s about him; and <name type="DATE">the fall</name>ing <name type="ORG">Sun</name> sh<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> upon them and made all their harness to gleam like red gold, and the white mantle of <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> was turned to a flame. Then <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> took the green st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> and held it up, and there came a green fire from his hand.</p>
<p>Soon the dwindling company, following the <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>, turned west and rode through the <name type="ORG">Gap</name> into the waste lands beyond, and then they turned northwards, and passed over the borders of <name type="GPE">Dunland</name>. The <name type="PERSON">Dunlendings</name> fled and hid themselves, for they were afraid of <name type="PERSON">Elvish</name> Folk, though few indeed ever came to their country; but the travellers did not heed them, for they were still a great company and were well provided with all that they needed; and they went on their way at their leisure, setting up their <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ts when they would.</p>
<p>On the <name type="CARDINAL">six</name>th <name type="DATE">day</name> since their parting from the <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g they journeyed through a wood climbing down from the <name type="ORG">hill</name>s at the feet of the <name type="LOC">Misty <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s</name> that now <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ched on their <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght hand. As they came out again into the open country at sundown they overtook an old man leaning on a staff, and he was clothed in rags of grey or dirty white, and at his heels went another beggar, slou<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g and whining.</p>
<p><q>'Well <name type="ORG">Saruman</name>!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'Where are you going?'</q></p>
<p><q>'What is that to you?'</q> he answered. <q>'Will you still order my goings, and are you not con<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>t with my ruin?'</q></p>
<p><q>'You know the answers,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>: <q>'no and no. But in any case the time of my labours now draws to an end. The <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g has taken on the burden. If you had waited at <name type="PERSON">Orthanc</name>, you would have seen him, and he would have shown you wisdom and mercy.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="ORG">'Then</name> all the more reason to have left so<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>r,'</q> said <name type="ORG">Saruman</name>; <q>'for I desire neither of him. Indeed if you wish for an answer to your <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> question, I am seeking a way out of his realm.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="ORG">'Then</name> once more you are going the wrong way,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, <q>'and I see no hope in your journey. But will you scorn our help? For we offer it to you.'</q></p>
<p><q>'To me?'</q> said <name type="ORG">Saruman</name>. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Nay</name>, pray do not smile at me! I prefer your frowns. And as for the <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> here, I do not trust her: she always hated me, and schemed for your part. I do not doubt that she has brought you this way to have the pleasure of gloating over my poverty. Had I been warned of your pursuit, I would have denied you the pleasure.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="ORG">'<name type="ORG">Saruman</name></name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Galad<name type="GPE">ri</name>el</name>, <q>'we have other errands and other cares that seem to us more urgent than hunting for you. Say rather that you are overtaken by good fortune; for now you have a last chance.'</q></p>
<p><q>'If it be truly the last, I am glad,'</q> said <name type="ORG">Saruman</name>; <q>'for I shall be spared the trouble of refusing it again. All my hopes are ruined, but I would not share yours. If you have any.'</q></p>
<p>For a moment his eyes kindled. <q><name type="CARDINAL">'Go</name>!'</q> he said. <q>'I did not spend long study on these matters for naught. You have doomed yourselves, and you know it. And it will af<name type="ORG">ford</name> me some comfort as I <name type="PERSON">wan</name>der to think that you pulled down your own house when you destroyed mine. And now, what ship will bear you back across so wide a sea?'</q> he mocked. <q><name type="DATE">'It</name> will be a grey ship, and full of ghosts.'</q> He laughed, but his voice was cracked and hideous.</p>
<p><q>'Get up, you idiot!'</q> he shouted to the other beggar, who had sat down on the ground; and he struck him with his staff. <q>'Turn about! If these fine folk are going our way, then we will take another. Get on, or I'll give you no crust for your supper!'</q></p>
<p>The beggar turned and slouched past whimpe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng: <q><name type="ORG">'Poor</name> old <name type="PERSON">Gr�ma</name>! Poor old <name type="PERSON">Gr�ma</name>! Always bea<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> and cursed. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w I hate him! I wish I could leave him!'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="ORG">'Then</name> leave him!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>.</p>
<p>But <name type="ORG">Worm</name>tongue only shot a glance of his bleared eyes full of terror at <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, and then shuffled quickly past behind <name type="ORG">Saruman</name>. As the wretched pair passed by the company they came to the hobbits, and <name type="ORG">Saruman</name> stopped and stared at them; but they looked at him with pity.</p>
<p><q><name type="CARDINAL">'So</name> you have come to gloat too, have you, my ur<name type="PERSON">chin</name>s?'</q> he said. <q>'You don't care what a beggar lacks, do you? For you have all you <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t, food and fine clothes, and the best weed for your pipes. Oh yes, I know! I know where it comes from. You would not give a pipeful to a beggar, would you?'</q></p>
<p><q>'I would, if I had any,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.</p>
<p><q>'You can have what I have got left,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>, <q>'if you will wait a moment.'</q> He got down and searched in the bag at his saddle. Then he handed to <name type="ORG">Saruman</name> a leather pouch. <q>'Take what there is,'</q> he said. <q>'You are welcome to it; it came from the flotsam of <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Mine, mine, yes and dearly bought!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="ORG">Saruman</name>, clut<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g at the pouch. <q>'This is only a repayment in token; for you took more, I'll be bound. Still, a beggar must be grateful, if a thief returns him even a morsel of his own. Well, it will serve you <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght when you come home, if you find things less good in the <name type="LOC">South</name>farthing than you would like. <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ng may your land be short of leaf!'</q></p>
<p><q>'Thank you!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'In that case I will have my pouch back, which is not yours and has journeyed far with me. Wrap the weed in a rag of your own.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="CARDINAL">'<name type="CARDINAL">One</name></name> thief deserves another,'</q> said <name type="ORG">Saruman</name>, and turned his back on <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>, and kicked <name type="ORG">Worm</name>tongue, and went away towards the wood.</p>
<p><q>'Well, I like that!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q>'Thief indeed! What of our claim for waylaying, wounding, and orc-dragging us through <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>?'</q></p>
<p><q>'Ah!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <q><name type="PERSON">'And</name> _bought_ he said. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w, I wonder? And I didn't like the sound of what he said about the <name type="LOC">South</name>farthing. It's time we got back.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I'm sure it is,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'But we can't go any quicker, if we are to see <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>. I am going to <name type="GPE">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name> <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>, whatever happens.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Yes, I think you had better do that,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'But alas for <name type="ORG">Saruman</name>! I fear nothing more can be made of him. He has withered altogether. All the same, I am not sure that <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard is <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght: I fancy he could do some mischief still in a small mean way.'</q></p>
<p>Next <name type="DATE">day</name> they went on into northern <name type="GPE">Dunland</name>, where no men now dwelt, though it was a green and pleasant country. <name type="DATE">September</name> came in with golden <name type="DATE">day</name>s and silver <name type="TIME">night</name>s, and they rode at ease until they reached the <name type="PERSON">S<name type="PERSON">wan</name></name>fleet <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver, and found the old <name type="ORG">ford</name>, east of <name type="DATE">the fall</name>s where it went down suddenly into the lowlands. Far to the west in a haze lay the meres and eyots through which it wound its way to the <name type="ORG">Grey</name>flood: there countless <name type="PERSON">s<name type="PERSON">wan</name></name>s housed in a land of reeds.</p>
<p>So they passed into <name type="ORG">Eregion</name>, and at last a fair <name type="TIME">morning</name> <name type="TIME">dawn</name>ed, shimme<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng above gleaming mists; and looking from their camp on a low <name type="ORG">hill</name> the travellers saw away in the east the <name type="ORG">Sun</name> cat<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> peaks that thrust up into the sky through floating clouds: <name type="GPE">Caradhras</name>, <name type="GPE">Celebdil</name>, and <name type="PERSON">Fanuidhol</name>. They were near to the <name type="FAC">Gate</name>s of <name type="GPE">Mo<name type="GPE">ri</name>a</name>.</p>
<p>Here now for <name type="CARDINAL">seven</name> <name type="DATE">day</name>s they tar<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed, for the time was at hand for another parting which they were loth to make. Soon <name type="EVENT">Celeborn</name> and <name type="PERSON">Galad<name type="GPE">ri</name>el</name> and their folk would turn eastward, and so pass by the <name type="GPE">Redhorn</name> <name type="FAC">Gate</name> and down the <name type="GPE">Dim<name type="GPE">ri</name>ll</name> Stair to the <name type="ORG">Silverlode</name> and to their own country. They had journeyed thus far by the west-ways, for they had much to speak of with <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name> and with <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, and here they lingered still in converse with their f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends. Of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> long after the hobbits were wrapped in sleep they would sit together under the stars, recalling the ages that were g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> and all their joys and labours in the world, or holding council, concerning the <name type="DATE">day</name>s to come. If any <name type="PERSON">wan</name>derer had chanced to pass, little would he have seen or heard, and it would have seemed to him only that he saw grey figures, carved in st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, memo<name type="GPE">ri</name>als of forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> things now lost in unpeopled lands. For they did not move or speak with mouth, looking from mind to mind; and only their shining eyes stirred and kindled as their thoughts went to and fro.</p>
<p>But at length all was said, and they parted again for a while, until it was time for the <name type="PERSON">Thr</name>ee <name type="ORG">Ring</name>s to pass away. Quickly fading into the st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s and the shadows the grey-cloaked people of L�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en rode towards the mountains; and those who were going to <name type="GPE">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name> sat on the <name type="ORG">hill</name> and watched, until there came out of the gathe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng mist a flash; and then they saw no more. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> knew that <name type="PERSON">Galad<name type="GPE">ri</name>el</name> had held aloft her <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng in token of farewell.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> turned away and sighed: <q>'I wish I was going back to L�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en!'</q></p>
<p>At last <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> <name type="TIME">evening</name> they came over the high moors, suddenly as to travellers it always seemed, to the b<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk of the deep valley of <name type="GPE">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name> and saw far below the lamps shining in <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name>'s house. And they went down and crossed the b<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge and came to the doors, and all the house was filled with light and song for joy at <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name>'s homecoming.</p>
<p><name type="ORDINAL">First</name> of all, before they had ea<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> or washed or even shed their cloaks, the hobbits went in search of <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>. They found him all al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> in his little room. It was littered with papers and pens and pencils; but <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> was sitting in a c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>r before a small b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght fire. He looked very old, but peaceful, and sleepy.</p>
<p>He opened his eyes and looked up as they came in. <q>'<name type="ORG">Hullo</name>, <name type="ORG">hullo</name>!'</q> he said. <q><name type="CARDINAL">'So</name> you've come back? And to<name type="DATE">morrow</name>'s my birth<name type="DATE">day</name>, too. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w clever of you! Do you know, I shall be <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name> and <name type="CARDINAL">twenty</name>-<name type="CARDINAL">nine</name>? And in <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> <name type="DATE">year</name> more, if I am spared, I shall equal the Old <name type="PERSON">Took</name>. I should like to beat him; but we shall see.'</q></p>
<p>After the celebration of <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>'s birth<name type="DATE">day</name> the <name type="CARDINAL">four</name> hobbits stayed in <name type="GPE">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name> for some <name type="DATE">day</name>s, and they sat much with their old f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end, who spent most of his time now in his room, except at meals. For these he was still very punctual as a rule, and he seldom failed to wake up in time for them. Sitting round the fire they told him in turn all that they could remember of their journeys and adventures. At <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> he pre<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ded to take some notes; but he of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> fell asleep; and when he woke he would say: <q>'<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w splendid! <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w wonderful! But where were we?'</q> Then they went on with the story from the point where he had begun to nod.</p>
<p>The only part that seemed really to rouse him and hold his at<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>tion was the account of the crowning and <name type="PERSON">mar</name><name type="GPE">ri</name>age of <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'I was invited to the wedding of course,'</q> he said. <q><name type="PERSON">'And</name> I have waited for it long enough. But somehow, when it came to it, I found I had so much to do here; and packing is such a bother.'</q></p>
<p>When nearly a fort<name type="TIME">night</name> had passed <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> looked out of his window and saw that there had been a frost in the <name type="TIME">night</name>, and the cobwebs were like white nets. Then suddenly he knew that he must go, and say good-bye to <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>. The weather was still calm and fair, after <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the most lovely <name type="DATE">summer</name>s that people could remember; but <name type="DATE">October</name> had come, and it must break soon and begin to rain and blow again. And there was still a very long way to go. Yet it was not really the thought of the weather that stirred him. He had a feeling that it was time he went back to the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> shared it. <name type="TIME">Only the <name type="TIME">night</name></name> before he had said:</p>
<p><q>'Well, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, we've been far and seen a deal, and yet I don't think we've found a better place than this. There's something of everything here, if you understand me: the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> and the Golden <name type="PERSON">Wood</name> and <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> and kings' houses and inns and meadows and mountains all mixed. And yet, somehow, I feel we ought to be going soon. I'm wor<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed about my gaffer, to tell you the truth.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Yes, something of everything, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, except the <name type="LOC">Sea</name>,'</q> <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> had answered; and he repeated it now to himself: <q>'Except the <name type="LOC">Sea</name>.'</q></p>
<p><name type="DATE">That <name type="DATE">day</name></name> <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> spoke to <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name>, and it was agreed that they should leave the next <name type="TIME">morning</name>. To their delight <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> said: <q>'I think I shall come too. At least as far as <name type="PERSON">Bree</name>. I <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t to see <name type="PERSON">Butterbur</name>.'</q></p>
<p>In the <name type="TIME">evening</name> they went to say good-bye to <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>. <q>'Well, if you must go, you must,'</q> he said. <q>'I am sorry. I shall miss you. It is nice just to know that you are about the place. But I am getting very sleepy.'</q> Then he gave <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> his <name type="PERSON">mith<name type="GPE">ri</name>l</name>-coat and <name type="PERSON">Sting</name>, forgetting that he had already d<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> so; and he gave him also <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> books of lore that he had made at va<name type="GPE">ri</name>ous times, w<name type="GPE">ri</name>t<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> in his spidery hand, and labelled on their red backs: _Translations from the <name type="PERSON">Elvish</name>, by <name type="PERSON">B.B.</name>_</p>
<p>To <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> he gave a little bag of gold. <q>'Almost the last drop of the <name type="ORG">Smaug</name> vintage,'</q> he said. <q>'<name type="DATE">May</name> come in useful, if you think of getting <name type="PERSON">mar</name><name type="GPE">ri</name>ed, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>.'</q> <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> blushed.</p>
<p><q>'I have nothing much to give to you young fellows,'</q> he said to <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>, <q>'except good advice.'</q> And when he had given them a fair sample of this, he added a last item in <name type="LOC">Shire</name>-fashion: <q>'Don't let your heads get too big for your hats! But if you don't finish growing up soon, you are going to find hats and clothes expensive.'</q></p>
<p><q>'But if you <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t to beat the Old <name type="PERSON">Took</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>, <q>'I don't see why we shouldn't try and beat the <name type="PERSON">Bullroarer</name>.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> laughed, and he produced out of a pocket <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> beautiful pipes with pearl mouth-pieces and bound with fine-wrought silver. <q>'Think of me when you smoke them!'</q> he said. <q>'The <name type="ORG">Elves</name> made them for me, but I don't smoke now.'</q> And then suddenly he nodded and went to sleep for a little; and when he woke up again he said: <q><name type="DATE">'No</name>w where were we? Yes, of course, giving presents. Which reminds me: what's become of my <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, that you took away?'</q></p>
<p><q>'I have lost it, <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> dear,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'I got <name type="GPE">ri</name>d of it, you know.'</q></p>
<p><q>'What a pity!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>. 'I should have liked to see it again. But no, how silly of me! That's what you went for, wasn't it: to get <name type="GPE">ri</name>d of it? But it is all so confusing, for such a lot of other things seem to have got mixed up with it: <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>'s affairs, and the White <name type="ORG">Council</name> and <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>, and the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>rsemen, and <name type="LOC">South</name>rons, and oliphaunts � did you really see <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>? � and caves and towers and golden trees, and goodness knows what besides.</p>
<p>'I evidently came back by much too straight a road from my t<name type="GPE">ri</name>p. I think <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> might have shown me round a bit. But then the auction would have been over before I got back, and I should have had even more trouble than I did. Anyway it's too late now; and really I think it's much more comfortable to sit here and hear about it all. The fire's very cosy here, and the food's very good, and there are <name type="ORG">Elves</name> when you <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t them. What more could <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t?</p>
<p>_The <name type="FAC">Road</name> goes ever on and on</p>
<p>Out from the door where it began.</p>
<p>Now far ahead the <name type="FAC">Road</name> has g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>,</p>
<p>Let others follow it who can!</p>
<p>Let them a journey new begin,</p>
<p>But I at last with weary feet</p>
<p>Will turn towards the lighted inn,</p>
<p>My <name type="TIME">evening</name>-rest and sleep to meet.'_</p>
<p>And as <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> murmured the last words his head dropped on his chest and he slept soundly.</p>
<p>The <name type="TIME">evening</name> deepened in the room, and the firelight burned b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ghter; and they looked at <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> as he slept and saw that his face was smiling. For some time they sat in silence; and then <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> looking round at the room and the shadows flicke<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng on the walls, said softly:</p>
<p><q>'I don't think, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, that he's d<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> much w<name type="GPE">ri</name>ting while we've been away. He won't ever w<name type="GPE">ri</name>te our story now.'</q></p>
<p>At that <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> opened an eye, almost as if he had heard. Then he roused himself. <q>'You see, I am getting so sleepy,'</q> he said. <q><name type="PERSON">'And</name> when I have time to w<name type="GPE">ri</name>te, I only really like w<name type="GPE">ri</name>ting poetry. I wonder, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> my dear fellow, if you would very much mind tidying things up a bit before you go? Collect all my notes and papers, and my diary too, and take them with you, if you will. You see, I haven't much time for the selection and the arrangement and all that. Get <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> to help, and when you've knocked things into shape, come back, and I'll run over it. I won't be too c<name type="GPE">ri</name>tical.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'Of</name> course I'll do it!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q><name type="PERSON">'And</name> of course I'll come back soon: it won't be dangerous any more. There is a real king now and he will soon put the roads in order.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Thank you, my dear fellow!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>. <q>'That really is a very great relief to my mind.'</q> And with that he fell fast asleep again.</p>
<p><name type="DATE">The next <name type="DATE">day</name></name> <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> and the hobbits took leave of <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> in his room, for it was cold out of doors; and then they said farewell to <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name> and all his household.</p>
<p>As <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> stood upon the threshold, <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name> wished him a fair journey, and blessed him, and he said:</p>
<p><q>'I think, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, that maybe you will not need to come back, unless you come very soon. For about this time of <name type="DATE">the <name type="DATE">year</name></name>, when the leaves are gold before they fall, look for <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> in the woods of the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>. I shall be with him.'</q></p>
<p>These words no <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> else heard, and <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> kept them to himself.</p>
</chapter><chapter num="7"><heading>Chapter 7</heading>
<p><name type="PERSON">Ho</name>meward Bound</p>
<p>At last the hobbits had their faces turned towards home. They were eager now to see the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> again; but at <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> they rode only slowly, for <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> had been ill at ease. When they came to the <name type="ORG">Ford</name> of <name type="PERSON">Bruinen</name>, he had halted, and seemed loth to <name type="GPE">ri</name>de into the stream; and they noted that for a while his eyes appeared not to see them or things about him. All that <name type="DATE">day</name> he was silent. It was the <name type="CARDINAL">six</name>th of <name type="DATE">October</name>.</p>
<p><q>'Are you in pain, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> quietly as he rode by <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s side.</p>
<p><q>'Well, yes I am,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q><name type="DATE">'It</name> is my shoulder. The wound aches, and the memory of darkness is heavy on me. It was <name type="DATE">a <name type="DATE">year</name></name> ago to<name type="DATE">day</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Alas</name>! there are some wounds that cannot be wholly cured,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>.</p>
<p><q>'I fear it may be so with mine,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'There is no real going back. Though I may come to the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>, it will not seem the same; for I shall not be the same. I am wounded with knife, sting, and tooth, and a long burden. Where shall I find rest?'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> did not answer.</p>
<p>By the end of the next <name type="DATE">day</name> the pain and unease had passed, and <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> was merry again, as merry as if he did not remember the blackness of the <name type="DATE">day</name> before. After that the journey went well, and the <name type="DATE">day</name>s went quickly by; for they rode at leisure, and of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> they lingered in the fair woodlands where the leaves were red and yellow in the <name type="DATE">autumn</name> sun. At length they came to <name type="ORG">Weathertop</name>; and it was then drawing towards <name type="TIME">evening</name> and the shadow of the <name type="ORG">hill</name> lay dark on the road. Then <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> begged them to has<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>, and he would not look towards the <name type="ORG">hill</name>, but rode through its shadow with head bowed and cloak drawn close about him. <name type="TIME">That <name type="TIME">night</name></name> the weather changed, and a wind came from the <name type="LOC">West</name> laden with rain, and it blew loud and c<name type="ORG">hill</name>, and the yellow leaves whirled like birds in the air. When they came to the <name type="PERSON">Che<name type="CARDINAL">two</name>od</name> already the boughs were almost bare, and a great curtain of rain veiled <name type="PERSON">Bree</name> <name type="ORG">Hill</name> from their sight.</p>
<p>So it was that near the end of a wild and wet <name type="TIME">evening</name> in the last <name type="DATE">day</name>s of <name type="DATE">October</name> the <name type="CARDINAL">five</name> travellers rode up the climbing road and came to the <name type="LOC">South</name>-gate of <name type="PERSON">Bree</name>. It was locked fast; and the rain blew in their faces, and in the darkening sky low clouds went hurrying by, and their hearts sank a little, for they had expected more welcome.</p>
<p>When they had called many times, at last the <name type="FAC">Gate</name>-keeper came out, and they saw that he car<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed a great cudgel. He looked at them with fear and suspicion; but when he saw that <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> was there, and that his companions were hobbits, in spite of their strange gear, then he b<name type="GPE">ri</name>gh<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed and wished them welcome.</p>
<p><q><name type="WORK_OF_ART">'<name type="WORK_OF_ART">Come</name></name> in!'</q> he said, unlocking the gate. <q>'We won't stay for news out here in the cold and the wet, a <name type="ORG">ruffian</name>ly <name type="TIME">evening</name>. But old <name type="ORG">Barley</name> will no doubt give you a welcome at _The Pony_, and there you'll hear all there is to hear.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="PERSON">'And</name> there you'll hear later all that we say, and more,'</q> laughed <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w is <name type="PERSON">Harry</name>?'</q></p>
<p>The <name type="FAC">Gate</name>-keeper scowled. <q><name type="CARDINAL">'Go</name>ne,'</q> he said. <q>'But you'd best ask <name type="PERSON">Barliman</name>. Good <name type="TIME">evening</name>!'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="CARDINAL">'Go</name>od <name type="TIME">evening</name> to you!'</q> they said, and passed through; and then they noticed that behind the hedge at the road-side a long low hut had been built, and a number of men had come out and were sta<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng at them over the <name type="PERSON">fen</name>ce. When they came to <name type="PERSON">Bill</name> <name type="PERSON">Ferny</name>'s house they saw that the hedge there was tattered and unkempt, and the windows were all boarded up.</p>
<p><q>'Do you think you killed him with that apple, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>.</p>
<p><q>'I'm not so hopeful, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <q>'But I'd like to know what became of that poor pony. He's been on my mind many a time and the wolves howling and all.'</q></p>
<p>At last they came to _<name type="PERSON">The Prancing Pony</name>_, and that at least looked outwardly unchanged; and there were lights behind the red curtains in the lower windows. They rang the bell, and <name type="ORG">Nob</name> came to the door, and opened it a crack and peeped through; and when he saw them standing under the lamp he gave a cry of surp<name type="GPE">ri</name>se.</p>
<p><q>'Mr. <name type="PERSON">Butterbur</name>! Master!'</q> he shouted. <q>'They've come back!'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'Oh</name> have they? I'll learn them,'</q> came <name type="PERSON">Butterbur</name>'s voice, and out he came with a rush, and he had a club in his hand. But when he saw who they were he stopped short, and the black scowl on his face changed to wonder and delight.</p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'No</name>b, you woolly-pated ninny!'</q> he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed. <q>'Can't you give old f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends their names? You shouldn't go sca<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng me like that, with times as they are. Well, well! And where have you come from? I never expected to see any of you folk again, and that's a fact: going off into the Wild with that <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>, and all those <name type="ORG">Black</name> <name type="ORG">Men</name> about. But I'm <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght glad to see you, and n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> more than <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Come</name> in! <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Come</name> in! The same rooms as � before? They're free. Indeed most rooms are empty these <name type="DATE">day</name>s, as I'll not hide from you, for you'll find it out soon enough. And I'll see what can be d<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> about supper, as soon as may be; but I'm short-handed at present. Hey, <name type="ORG">Nob</name> you <name type="GPE">slowcoach</name>! Tell <name type="PERSON">Bob</name>! Ah, but there I'm forgetting, <name type="PERSON">Bob</name>'s g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>: goes home to his folk at <name type="TIME">night</name>fall now. Well, take the guests' ponies to the stables, <name type="ORG">Nob</name>! And you'll be taking your horse to his stable yourself <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>; I don't doubt. A fine beast, as I said when I <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> set eyes on him. Well, come in! Make yourselves at home!'</q></p>
<p>Mr. <name type="PERSON">Butterbur</name> had at any rate not changed his manner of talking, and still seemed to live in his old breathless bustle. And yet there was hardly anybody about, and all was quiet; from the Common Room there came a low murmur of no <name type="CARDINAL">more than <name type="CARDINAL">two</name></name> or <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> voices. And seen closer in the light of <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> candles that he lit and car<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed before them the landlord's face looked rather w<name type="GPE">ri</name>nkled and careworn.</p>
<p>He led them down the passage to the parlour that they had used on that strange <name type="TIME">night</name> more than <name type="DATE">a <name type="DATE">year</name></name> ago; and they followed him, a little disquieted, for it seemed plain to them that old <name type="PERSON">Barliman</name> was putting a brave face on some trouble. Things were not what they had been. But they said nothing, and waited.</p>
<p>As they expected Mr. <name type="PERSON">Butterbur</name> came to the parlour after supper to see if all had been to their liking. As indeed it had: no change for the worse had yet come upon the beer or the victuals at _The Pony_ at any rate. <q><name type="DATE">'No</name>w I won't make so bold as to suggest you should come to the Common Room to<name type="TIME">night</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Butterbur</name>. <q>'You'll be tired; and there isn't many folk there this <name type="TIME">evening</name>, anyway. But if you could spare me <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> <name type="TIME">an <name type="TIME">hour</name></name> before you go to your beds, I would dearly like to have some talk with you, quiet-like by ourselves.'</q></p>
<p><q>'That is just what we should like, too,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'We are not tired. We have been taking things easy. We were wet, cold and hungry, but all that you have cured. <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Come</name>, sit down! And if you have any pipe-weed, we'll bless you.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Well, if you'd called for anything else, I'd have been happier,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Butterbur</name>. <q>'That's just a thing that we're short of, seeing how we've only got what we grow ourselves, and that's not enough. There's n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> to be had from the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> these <name type="DATE">day</name>s. But I'll do what I can.'</q></p>
<p>When he came back he brought them enough to last them for <name type="DATE">a <name type="DATE">day</name></name> or <name type="CARDINAL">two</name>, a wad of uncut leaf. <q><name type="CARDINAL">'So</name>uthlinch,'</q> he said, <q>'and the best we have; but not the match of <name type="LOC">South</name>farthing, as I've always said though I'm all for <name type="PERSON">Bree</name> in most matters, begging your pardon.'</q></p>
<p>They put him in a large c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>r by the wood-fire, and <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> sat on the other side of the h<name type="LOC">earth</name>, and the hobbits in low c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>rs between them; and then they talked for many times <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> <name type="TIME">an <name type="TIME">hour</name></name>, and exchanged all such news as Mr. <name type="PERSON">Butterbur</name> wished to hear or give. Most of the things which they had to tell were a mere wonder and bewilderment to their host, and far beyond his vision; and they brought forth few comments other than: <q>'You don't say; of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> repeated in defiance of the evidence of Mr. <name type="PERSON">Butterbur</name>'s own ears. 'You don't say, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Baggins</name>, or is it Mr. <name type="PERSON">Under<name type="ORG">hill</name></name>? I'm getting so mixed up. You don't say, Master <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>! Well I never! Who'd have thought it in our times!'</q></p>
<p>But he did say much on his own account. Things were far from well, he would say. Business was not even fair, it was down<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght bad. <q><name type="DATE">'No</name> <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> comes nigh <name type="PERSON">Bree</name> now from Outside,'</q> he said. <q><name type="PERSON">'And</name> the inside folks, they stay at home mostly and keep their doors barred. It all comes of those newcomers and gangrels that began coming up the <name type="ORG">Green</name>way <name type="DATE">last <name type="DATE">year</name></name>, as you may remember; but more came later. Some were just poor bodies running away from trouble; but most were bad men, full o' thievery and mischief. And there was trouble <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght here in <name type="PERSON">Bree</name>, bad trouble. Why, we had a real set-to, and there were some folk killed, killed dead! If you'll believe me.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I will indeed,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w many?'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Thr</name>ee and <name type="CARDINAL">two</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Butterbur</name>, refer<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng to the big folk and the little. 'There was poor Mat <name type="PERSON">Heather</name>toes, and Rowlie <name type="ORG">Apple</name>dore, and little <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> Pickthorn from over the <name type="ORG">Hill</name>; and <name type="PERSON">Willie Banks</name> from up-away, and <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the <name type="PERSON">Under<name type="ORG">hill</name></name>s from <name type="ORG">Staddle</name>: all good fellows, and they're missed. And <name type="PERSON">Harry</name> <name type="GPE">Goatleaf</name> that used to be on the <name type="LOC">West</name>-gate, and that <name type="PERSON">Bill</name> <name type="PERSON">Ferny</name>, they came in on the strangers' side, and they've g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> off with them; and it's my belief they let them in. On the <name type="TIME">night</name> of the fight, I mean. And that was after we showed them the gates and pushed them out: before <name type="DATE">the <name type="DATE">year</name></name>'s end, that was; and the fight was early in the <name type="EVENT">New Year</name>, after the heavy snow we had.</p>
<p><q><name type="PERSON">'And</name> now they're g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> for robbers and live outside, hiding in the woods beyond <name type="PERSON">Archet</name>, and out in the wilds north-away. It's like a bit of the bad old times tales tell of, I say. It isn't safe on the road and nobody goes far, and folk lock up early. We have to keep watchers all round the <name type="PERSON">fen</name>ce and put a lot of men on the gates at <name type="TIME">night</name>s.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Well, no <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> troubled us,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>, <q>'and we came along slowly, and kept no watch. We thought we'd left all trouble behind us.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Ah, that you haven't, Master, more's the pity,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Butterbur</name>. <q>'But it's no wonder they left you al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. They wouldn't go for armed folk, with swords and helmets and shields and all. Make them think twice, that would. And I must say it put me aback a bit when I saw you.'</q></p>
<p>Then the hobbits suddenly realized that people had looked at them with amazement not out of surp<name type="GPE">ri</name>se at their return so much as in wonder at their gear. They themselves had become so used to warfare and to <name type="GPE">ri</name>ding in well-arrayed companies that they had quite forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> that the b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght mail peeping from under their cloaks, and the helms of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> and the <name type="PERSON">Mark</name>, and the fair devices on their shields, would seem outlandish in their own country. And <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, too, was now <name type="GPE">ri</name>ding on his tall grey horse, all clad in white with a great mantle of blue and silver over all, and the long sword <name type="PERSON">Glamd<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng</name> at his side.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> laughed. <q>'Well, well,'</q> he said, <q>'if they are afraid of just <name type="CARDINAL">five</name> of us, then we have met worse enemies on our travels. But at any rate they will give you peace at <name type="TIME">night</name> while we stay.'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w long will that be?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Butterbur</name>. <q>'I'll not deny we should be glad to have you about for a bit. You see, we're not used to such troubles; and the <name type="PRODUCT">Ranger</name>s have all g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> away, folk tell me. I don't think we've <name type="GPE">ri</name>ghtly understood till now what they did for us. For there's been worse than robbers about. <name type="PRODUCT">Wolves</name> were howling round the <name type="PERSON">fen</name>ces <name type="DATE">last <name type="DATE">winter</name></name>. And there's dark shapes in the woods, dreadful things that it makes the blood run cold to think of. It's been very disturbing, if you understand me.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I expect it has,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. 'Nearly all lands have been disturbed these <name type="DATE">day</name>s, very disturbed. But cheer up, <name type="PERSON">Barliman</name>! You have been on the edge of very great troubles, and I am only glad to hear that you have not been deeper in. But better times are coming. <name type="DATE">May</name>be, better than any you remember. The <name type="PRODUCT">Ranger</name>s have returned. We came back with them. And there is a king again, <name type="PERSON">Barliman</name>. He will soon be turning his mind this way.</p>
<p><q><name type="ORG">'Then</name> the <name type="ORG">Green</name>way will be opened again, and his messengers will come north, and there will be comings and goings, and the evil things will be d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ven out of the waste-lands. Indeed the waste in time will be waste no longer, and there will be people and fields where once there was wilderness.'</q></p>
<p>Mr. <name type="PERSON">Butterbur</name> shook his head. <q>'If there's a few decent respectable folk on the roads, that won't do no harm,'</q> he said. <q>'But we don't <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t no more rabble and <name type="ORG">ruffian</name>s. And we don't <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t no outsiders at <name type="PERSON">Bree</name>, nor near <name type="PERSON">Bree</name> at all. We <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t to be let al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. I don't <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t a whole crowd o' strangers camping here and settling there and tea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng up the wild country.'</q></p>
<p><q>'You will be let al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, <name type="PERSON">Barliman</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'There is room enough for realms between <name type="PERSON">Isen</name> and <name type="ORG">Grey</name>flood, or along the shore lands south of the <name type="ORG">Brand</name>ywine, without any <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> living within many <name type="DATE">day</name>s' <name type="GPE">ri</name>de of <name type="PERSON">Bree</name>. And many folk used to dwell away north, <name type="CARDINAL">a <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name></name> miles or more from here, at the far end of the <name type="ORG">Green</name>way: on the <name type="LOC">North</name> <name type="LOC">Downs</name> or by <name type="PERSON">Lake Evendim</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Up away by Deadmen's <name type="PERSON">Dike</name>?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Butterbur</name>, looking even more dubious. <q>'That's haunted land, they say. N<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> but a robber would go there.'</q></p>
<p><q>'The <name type="PRODUCT">Ranger</name>s go there,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'Deadmen's <name type="PERSON">Dike</name>, you say. So it has been called for <name type="DATE">long <name type="DATE">year</name>s</name>; but its <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght name, <name type="PERSON">Barliman</name>, is <name type="GPE">Fornost</name> Erain, <name type="GPE">Norbury</name> of the <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>gs. And the <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g will come there again <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> <name type="DATE">day</name>; and then you'll have some fair folk <name type="GPE">ri</name>ding through.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Well, that sounds more hopeful, I'll allow,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Butterbur</name>. <q><name type="PERSON">'And</name> it will be good for business, no doubt. So long as he lets <name type="PERSON">Bree</name> al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="CARDINAL">'He</name> will,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q><name type="CARDINAL">'He</name> knows it and loves it.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Does he now?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Butterbur</name> looking puzzled. <q>'Though I'm sure I don't know why he should, sitting in his big c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>r up in his great castle, <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name>s of miles away. And d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nking wine out of <name type="FAC">a golden cup</name>, I shouldn't wonder. What's _The Pony_ to him, or mugs o' beer? Not but what my beer's good, <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. It's been uncommon good, since you came in the <name type="DATE">autumn</name> of <name type="DATE">last <name type="DATE">year</name></name> and put a good word on it. And that's been a comfort in trouble, I will say.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Ah!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <q>'But he says your beer is always good.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="CARDINAL">'He</name> says?'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'Of</name> course he does. He's <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>. The chief of the <name type="PRODUCT">Ranger</name>s. <name type="GPE">Haven</name>'t you got that into your head yet?'</q></p>
<p>It went in at last, and <name type="PERSON">Butterbur</name>'s face was a study in wonder. The eyes in his broad face grew round, and his mouth opened wide, and he gasped. <q>'<name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>!'</q> he exclaimed when he got back his breath. <q>'Him with a crown and all and <name type="FAC">a golden cup</name>! Well, what are we coming to?'</q></p>
<p><q>'Better times, for <name type="PERSON">Bree</name> at any rate,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>.</p>
<p><q>'I hope so, I'm sure,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Butterbur</name>. <q>'Well, this has been the nicest chat I've had in <name type="DATE">a month</name> of <name type="DATE">Mon<name type="DATE">day</name></name>s. And I'll not deny that I'll sleep easier to<name type="TIME">night</name> and with a lighter heart. You've given me a powerful lot to think over, but I'll put that off until to<name type="DATE">morrow</name>. I'm for bed, and I've no doubt you'll be glad of your beds too. Hey, <name type="ORG">Nob</name>!'</q> he called, going to the door. <q><name type="DATE">'No</name>b, you <name type="GPE">slowcoach</name>!'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'No</name>w!'</q> he said to himself, slapping his forehead. <q><name type="DATE">'No</name>w what does that remind me of?'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'No</name>t another letter you've forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>. I hope, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Butterbur</name>?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>.</p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'No</name>w, now, Mr. <name type="ORG">Brand</name>ybuck, don't go reminding me of that! But there, you've broken my thought. Now where was I? <name type="ORG">Nob</name>, stables, ah! that was it. I've something that belongs to you. If you recollect <name type="PERSON">Bill</name> <name type="PERSON">Ferny</name> and the horsethieving: his pony as you bought, well, it's here. <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Come</name> back all of itself, it did. But where it had been to you know better than me. It was as shaggy as an old dog and as lean as a clothes-rail, but it was alive. <name type="ORG">Nob</name>'s looked after it.'</q></p>
<p><q>'What! My <name type="PERSON">Bill</name>?'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <q>'Well, I was born lucky, whatever my gaffer may say. There's another wish come true! Where is he?'</q> <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> would not go to bed until he had visited <name type="PERSON">Bill</name> in his stable.</p>
<p>The travellers stayed in <name type="PERSON">Bree</name> all the next <name type="DATE">day</name>, and Mr. <name type="PERSON">Butterbur</name> could not complain of his business next <name type="TIME">evening</name> at any rate. <name type="ORG">Cu<name type="GPE">ri</name>osity</name> overcame all fears, and his house was crowded. For a while out of poli<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ess the hobbits visited the Common Room in the <name type="TIME">evening</name> and answered a good many questions. <name type="PERSON">Bree</name> memo<name type="GPE">ri</name>es being re<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>tive, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> was asked many times if he had w<name type="GPE">ri</name>t<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> his book.</p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'No</name>t yet,'</q> he answered. <q>'I am going home now to put my notes in order.'</q> He promised to deal with the amazing events at <name type="PERSON">Bree</name>, and so give a bit of interest to a book that appeared likely to treat mostly of the remote and less imp<name type="GPE">ortan</name>t affairs 'away south'.</p>
<p>Then <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the younger folk called for a song. But at that a hush fell, and he was frowned down, and the call was not repeated. Evidently there was no wish for any uncanny events in the Common Room again.</p>
<p>No trouble by <name type="DATE">day</name>, nor any sound by <name type="TIME">night</name>, disturbed the peace of <name type="PERSON">Bree</name> while the travellers remained there; but the next <name type="TIME">morning</name> they got up early, for as the weather was still rainy they wished to reach the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> <name type="TIME">before <name type="TIME">night</name></name>, and it was a long <name type="GPE">ri</name>de. The <name type="PERSON">Bree</name> folk were all out to see them off, and were in mer<name type="GPE">ri</name>er mood than they had been for <name type="DATE">a <name type="DATE">year</name></name>; and those who had not seen the strangers in all their gear before <name type="PERSON">gape</name>d with wonder at them: at <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> with his white beard, and the light that seemed to gleam from him, as if his blue mantle was only a cloud over sunshine; and at the <name type="CARDINAL">four</name> hobbits like <name type="GPE">ri</name>ders upon errantry out of almost forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> tales. Even those who had laughed at all the talk about the <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g began to think there might be some truth in it.</p>
<p><q>'Well, good luck on your road, and good luck to your home-coming! said Mr. <name type="PERSON">Butterbur</name>. 'I should have warned you before that all's not well in the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> neither, if what we hear is true. Funny goings on, they say. But <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> thing d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ves out another, and I was full of my own troubles. But if I may be so bold, you've come back changed from your travels, and you look now like folk as can deal with troubles out of hand. I don't doubt you'll soon set all to <name type="GPE">ri</name>ghts. Good luck to you! And the of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>er you come back the better I'll be pleased.'</q></p>
<p>They wished him farewell and rode away, and passed through the <name type="LOC">West</name>-gate and on towards the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>. <name type="PERSON">Bill</name> the pony was with them, and as before he had a good deal of baggage, but he trotted along beside <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> and seemed well con<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>t.</p>
<p><q>'I wonder what old <name type="PERSON">Barliman</name> was hinting at,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.</p>
<p><q>'I can guess some of it,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> gloomily. <q>'What I saw in the <name type="ORG">Mirror</name>: trees cut down and all, and my old gaffer turned out of the Row. I ought to have hur<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed back quicker.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="PERSON">'And</name> something's wrong with the <name type="LOC">South</name>farthing evidently,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'There's a general shortage of pipe-weed.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Whatever it is,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>, <q>'<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>tho will be at the bot<name type="PERSON">tom</name> of it: you can be sure of that.'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Deep</name> in, but not at the bot<name type="PERSON">tom</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'You have forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> <name type="ORG">Saruman</name>. He began to take an interest in the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> before <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> did.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Well, we've got you with us,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>, <q>'so things will soon be cleared up.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I am with you at present,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, 'but soon I shall not be. I am not coming to the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>. You must settle its affairs yourselves; that is what you have been trained for. Do you not yet understand? My time is over: it is no longer my task to set things to <name type="GPE">ri</name>ghts, nor to help folk to do so. And as for you, my dear f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends, you will need no help. You are grown up now. Grown indeed very high; among the great you are, and I have no longer any fear at all for any of you.</p>
<p><q>'But if you would know, I am turning aside soon. I am going to have a long talk with <name type="GPE">Bombadil</name>: such a talk as I have not had in all my time. He is a moss-gatherer, and I have been a st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> doomed to rolling. But my rolling <name type="DATE">day</name>s are ending, and now we shall have much to say to <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> another.'</q></p>
<p>In a little while they came to the point on the <name type="LOC">East</name> <name type="FAC">Road</name> where they had taken leave of <name type="GPE">Bombadil</name>; and they hoped and <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> expected to see him standing there to greet them as they went by. But there was no sign of him; and there was a grey mist on the <name type="ORG">Barrow</name>-downs southwards, and a deep veil over the Old <name type="ORG">Forest</name> far away.</p>
<p>They halted and <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> looked south wistfully. <q>'I should dearly like to see the old fellow again,'</q> he said. <q>'I wonder how he is getting on?'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'As</name> well as ever, you may be sure,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'Quite untroubled and I should guess, not much interested in anything that we have d<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> or seen, unless perhaps in our visits to the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s. There may be a time later for you to go and see him. But if I were you, I should press on now for home, or you will not come to the <name type="ORG">Brand</name>ywine <name type="FAC">B<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge</name> before the gates are locked.'</q></p>
<p><q>'But there aren't any gates,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>, <q>'not on the <name type="FAC">Road</name>; you know that quite well. There's the <name type="PERSON">Buckland</name> <name type="FAC">Gate</name>, of course; but they'll let me through that at any time.'</q></p>
<p><q>'There weren't any gates, you mean,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'I think you will find some now. And you might have more trouble even at the <name type="PERSON">Buckland</name> <name type="FAC">Gate</name> than you think. But you'll! manage all <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght. Good-bye dear f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends! Not for the last time, not yet. Good-bye!'</q></p>
<p>He turned <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>fax off the <name type="FAC">Road</name>, and the great horse leaped the green dike that here ran beside it; and then at a cry from <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> he was g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, racing towards the <name type="ORG">Barrow</name>-downs like a wind from the <name type="LOC">North</name>.</p>
<p><q>'Well here we are, just the <name type="CARDINAL">four</name> of us that started out together,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'We have left all the rest behind, <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> after another. It seems almost like a dream that has slowly faded.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'No</name>t to me,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'To me it feels more like falling asleep again.'</q></p>

<p>The Scou<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng of the <name type="LOC">Shire</name></p>
<p>It was after <name type="TIME">night</name>fall when, wet and tired, the travellers came at last to the <name type="ORG">Brand</name>ywine, and they found the way barred. At either end of the <name type="FAC">B<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge</name> there was a great spiked gate; and on the further side of the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver they could see that some new houses had been built: <name type="CARDINAL">two</name>-storeyed with narrow straight-sided windows, bare and dimly lit, all very gloomy and un-<name type="LOC">Shire</name>like.</p>
<p>They hammered on the outer gate and called, but there was at <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> no answer; and then to their surp<name type="GPE">ri</name>se some<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> blew a horn, and the lights in the windows went out. A voice shouted in the dark:</p>
<p><q><name type="CARDINAL">'Who</name>'s that? Be off! You can't come in: Can't you read the notice: _No admittance between sundown and sun<name type="GPE">ri</name>se_?'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'Of</name> course we can't read the notice in the dark.'</q> <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> shouted back. <q><name type="PERSON">'And</name> if hobbits of the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> are to be kept out in the wet on <name type="TIME">a <name type="TIME">night</name></name> like this, I'll tear down your notice when I find it.'</q></p>
<p>At that a window slammed, and a crowd of hobbits with lanterns poured out of the house on the left. They opened the further gate, and some came over the b<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge. When they saw the travellers they seemed f<name type="GPE">ri</name>gh<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed.</p>
<p><q><name type="WORK_OF_ART">'<name type="WORK_OF_ART">Come</name></name> along!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>, recognizing <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the hobbits. <q>'If you don't know me, <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>b Hayward, you ought to. I am <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> <name type="ORG">Brand</name>ybuck, and I should like to know what all this is about, and what a <name type="PERSON">Buckland</name>er like you is doing here. You used to be on the Hay <name type="FAC">Gate</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Bless me! It's Master <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>, to be sure, and all dressed up for fighting!'</q> said old <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>b. <q>'Why, they said you was dead! <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>st in the Old <name type="ORG">Forest</name> by all accounts. I'm pleased to see you alive after all!'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="ORG">'Then</name> stop gaping at me through the bars, and open the gate!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>.</p>
<p><q>'I'm sorry, Master <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>, but we have orders.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="CARDINAL">'Who</name>se orders?'</q></p>
<p><q>'The Chief's up at <name type="FAC">Bag End</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Chief? Chief? Do you mean Mr. <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>tho?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.</p>
<p><q>'I suppose so, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Baggins</name>; but we have to say just "the Chief" nowa<name type="DATE">day</name>s.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Do you indeed!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'Well, I am glad he has dropped the <name type="PERSON">Baggins</name> at any rate. But it is evidently high time that the family dealt with him and put him in his place.'</q></p>
<p>A hush fell on the hobbits beyond the gate. <q><name type="DATE">'It</name> won't do no good talking that way,'</q> said <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. <q><name type="CARDINAL">'He</name>'ll get to hear of it. And if you make so much noise, you'll wake the Chief's Big Man.'</q></p>
<p><q>'We shall wake him up in a way that will surp<name type="GPE">ri</name>se him,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'If you mean that your precious Chief has been hi<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng <name type="ORG">ruffian</name>s out of the wild, then we've not come back too soon.'</q> He sprang from his pony, and seeing the notice in the light of the lanterns, he tore it down and threw it over the gate. The hobbits backed away and made no move to open it. <q><name type="WORK_OF_ART">'<name type="WORK_OF_ART">Come</name></name> on, <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'<name type="CARDINAL">Two</name> is enough.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Merry</name> and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> climbed the gate, and the hobbits fled. Another horn sounded. Out of the bigger house on the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght a large heavy figure appeared against a light in the doorway.</p>
<p><q>'What's all this,'</q> he snarled as he came forward. <q>'<name type="FAC">Gate</name>-breaking? You clear out, or I'll break your filthy little necks!'</q> Then he stopped, for he had caught the gleam of swords.</p>
<p><q><name type="PERSON">'<name type="PERSON">Bill</name> <name type="PERSON">Ferny</name></name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>, <q>'if you don't open that gate in <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> <name type="ORG">sec</name>onds, you'll regret it. I shall set steel to you, if you don't obey. And when you have opened the gates you will go through them and never return. You are a <name type="ORG">ruffian</name> and a highway-robber.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Bill</name> <name type="PERSON">Ferny</name> flinched and shuffled to the gate and unlocked it. <q>'Give me the key!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. But the <name type="ORG">ruffian</name> flung it at his head and then darted out into the darkness. As he passed the ponies <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of them let fly with his heels and just caught him as he ran. He went off with a yelp into the <name type="TIME">night</name> and was never heard of again.</p>
<p><q>'Neat work, <name type="PERSON">Bill</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, meaning the pony.</p>
<p><q><name type="CARDINAL">'So</name> much for your Big Man,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'We'll see the Chief later. In the meantime we <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t a lodging for the <name type="TIME">night</name>, and as you seem to have pulled down the <name type="FAC">B<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge</name> Inn and built this dismal place instead, you'll have to put us up.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I am sorry, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>b, <q>'but it isn't allowed.'</q></p>
<p><q>'What isn't allowed?'</q></p>
<p>Taking in folk off-hand like and eating extra food, and all that, said <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>b.</p>
<p><q>'What's the matter with the place?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'Has it been <name type="DATE">a bad <name type="DATE">year</name></name>, or what? I thought it had been a fine <name type="DATE">summer</name> and harvest.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Well no, <name type="DATE">the <name type="DATE">year</name></name>'s been good enough,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>b. <q>'We grows a lot of food, but we don't <name type="GPE">ri</name>ghtly know what becomes of it. It's all these "gatherers" and "sharers", I reckon, going round counting and measu<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng and taking off to storage. They do more gathe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng than sha<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng, and we never see most of the stuff again.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'Oh</name> come!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> yawning. <q>'This is all too tiresome for me to<name type="TIME">night</name>. We've got food in our bags. Just give us a room to lie down in. It'll be better than many places I have seen.'</q></p>
<p>The hobbits at the gate still seemed ill at ease, evidently some rule or other was being broken; but there was no gainsaying <name type="CARDINAL">four</name> such masterful travellers, all armed, and <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> of them uncommonly large and strong-looking. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> ordered the gates to be locked again. There was some sense at any rate in keeping a guard, while <name type="ORG">ruffian</name>s were still about. Then the <name type="CARDINAL">four</name> companions went into the hobbit guard-house and made themselves as comfortable as they could. It was a bare and ugly place, with a mean little grate that would not allow a good fire. In the upper rooms were little rows of hard beds, and on every wall there was a notice and a list of Rules. <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> tore them down. There was no beer and very little food, but with what the travellers brought and shared out they all made a fair meal; and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> broke Rule <name type="CARDINAL">4</name> by putting most of next <name type="DATE">day</name>'s allo<name type="PERSON">wan</name>ce of wood on the fire.</p>
<p><q>'Well now, what about a smoke, while you tell us what has been happening in the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>?'</q> he said.</p>
<p><q>'There isn't no pipe-weed now,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>b; <q>'at least only for the Chief's men. All the stocks seem to have g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. We do hear that waggon-loads of it went away down the old road out of the <name type="LOC">South</name>farthing, over Sarn <name type="ORG">Ford</name> way. That would be the end o' <name type="DATE">last <name type="DATE">year</name></name>, after you left. But it had been going away quietly before that, in a small way. That <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>tho-'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'No</name>w you shut up, <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>b Hayward!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed several of the others. <q>'You know talk o' that sort isn't allowed. The Chief will hear of it, and we'll all be in trouble.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="CARDINAL">'He</name> wouldn't hear naught, if some of you here weren't sneaks,'</q> rejoined <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>b hotly.</p>
<p><q><name type="PERSON">'All</name> <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght, all <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. "That's quite enough. I don't <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t to hear no more. No welcome, no beer, no smoke, and a lot of rules and orc-talk instead. I hoped to have a rest, but I can see there's work and trouble ahead. Let's sleep and forget it till <name type="TIME">morning</name>!'</p>
<p>The new 'Chief' evidently had means of getting news. It was a good <name type="CARDINAL">forty</name> miles from the <name type="FAC">B<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge</name> to <name type="FAC">Bag End</name>, but some<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> made the journey in a hurry. So <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and his f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends soon discovered.</p>
<p>They had not made any definite plans, but had vaguely thought of going down to <name type="ORG">C<name type="GPE">ri</name>ckhollow</name> together <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>, and resting there a bit. But now, seeing what things were like, they decided to go straight to <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbiton. So the next <name type="DATE">day</name> they set out along the <name type="FAC">Road</name> and jogged along steadily. The wind had dropped but the sky was grey. The land looked rather sad and forlorn; but it was after all the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> of <name type="DATE">November</name> and the fag-end of <name type="DATE">Autumn</name>. Still there seemed an unusual amount of burning going on, and smoke rose from many points round about. A great cloud of it was going up far away in the direction of the <name type="PERSON">Wood</name>y End.</p>
<p>As <name type="TIME">evening</name> fell they were drawing near to <name type="ORG">Frogmorton</name>, a village <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght on the <name type="FAC">Road</name>, about <name type="CARDINAL">twenty</name>-<name type="CARDINAL">two</name> miles from the <name type="FAC">B<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge</name>. There they meant to stay the <name type="TIME">night</name>; _The Floating <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>g_ at <name type="ORG">Frogmorton</name> was a good inn. But as they came to the east end of the village they met a bar<name type="GPE">ri</name>er with a large board saying NO ROAD; and behind it stood a large band of Shir<name type="GPE">ri</name>ffs with staves in their hands and feathers in their caps, looking both imp<name type="GPE">ortan</name>t and rather scared.</p>
<p><q>'What's all this?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, feeling inclined to laugh.</p>
<p>This is what it is, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Baggins</name>, said the leader of the Shir<name type="GPE">ri</name>ffs, a <name type="CARDINAL">two</name>-feather hobbit: <q>'You're arrested for <name type="FAC">Gate</name>-breaking, and Tea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng up of Rules, and Assaulting <name type="FAC">Gate</name>-keepers, and Trespassing, and Sleeping in <name type="LOC">Shire</name>-buildings without Leave, and <name type="ORG">B<name type="GPE">ri</name>bing <name type="ORG">Guard</name>s with Food</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="PERSON">'And</name> what else?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.</p>
<p><q>'That'll do to go on with,'</q> said the Shir<name type="GPE">ri</name>ff-leader.</p>
<p><q>'I can add some more, if you like it,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <q>'Calling your Chief Names, Wishing to punch his <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Pimply Face</name>, and Thinking you Shir<name type="GPE">ri</name>ffs look a lot of <name type="PERSON">Tom</name>-fools.'</q></p>
<p><q>'There now, Mister, that'll do. It's the Chief's orders that you're to come along quiet. We're going to take you to <name type="PERSON">Bywater</name> and hand you over to the Chief's <name type="ORG">Men</name>; and when he deals with your case you can have your say. But if you don't <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t to stay in the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ckholes any longer than you need, I should cut the say short, if I was you.'</q></p>
<p>To the discomfiture of the Shir<name type="GPE">ri</name>ffs <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and his companions all roared with laughter. <q>'Don't be absurd!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'I am going where I please, and in my own time. I happen to be going to <name type="FAC">Bag End</name> on business, but if you insist on going too, well that is your affair.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Very well, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Baggins</name>,'</q> said the leader, pushing the bar<name type="GPE">ri</name>er aside. <q>'But don't forget I've arrested you.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I won't,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'Never. But I may forgive you. Now I am not going any further to<name type="DATE">day</name>, so if you'll kindly escort me to _The Floating <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>g_, I'll be obliged.'</q></p>
<p>'I can't do that, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Baggins</name>. The inn's closed. There's a Shir<name type="GPE">ri</name>ff-house at the far end of the village. I'll take you there. '</p>
<p><q><name type="PERSON">'All</name> <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q><name type="CARDINAL">'Go</name> on and we'll follow.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> had been looking the Shir<name type="GPE">ri</name>ffs up and down and had spotted <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> that he knew. <q><name type="CARDINAL">'He</name>y, come here <name type="PERSON">Robin</name> Smallburrow!'</q> he called. <q>'I <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t a word with you.'</q></p>
<p>With a sheepish glance at his leader, who looked wrathful but did not dare to interfere, <name type="PERSON">Shir<name type="GPE">ri</name>ff Smallburrow</name> fell back and walked beside <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, who got down off his pony.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok here, <name type="PERSON">Cock-robin</name>!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <q>'You're <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbiton-bred and ought to have more sense, coming a-waylaying Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and all. And what's all this about the inn being closed?'</q></p>
<p><q>'They're all closed,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Robin</name>. <q>'The Chief doesn't hold with beer. Leastways that is how it started. But now I reckon it's his <name type="ORG">Men</name> that has it all. And he doesn't hold with folk moving about; so if they will or they must, then they has to go to the Shir<name type="GPE">ri</name>ff-house and explain their business.'</q></p>
<p><q>'You ought to be ashamed of yourself having anything to do with such nonsense,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <q>'You used to like the inside of an inn better than the outside yourself. You were always popping in, on duty or off.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="PERSON">'And</name> so I would be still, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, if I could. But don't be hard on me. What can I do? You know how I went for a Shir<name type="GPE">ri</name>ff <name type="CARDINAL">seven</name> <name type="DATE">year</name>s ago, before any of this began. Gave me a chance of walking round the country and seeing folk, and hea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng the news, and knowing where the good beer was. But now it's different.'</q></p>
<p><q>'But you can give it up, stop <name type="LANGUAGE">Shir<name type="GPE">ri</name>ffing</name>, if it has stopped being a respectable job,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>.</p>
<p><q>'We're not allowed to,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Robin</name>.</p>
<p><q>'If I hear _not allowed_ much of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>er,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, <q>'I'm going to get angry.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Can't say as I'd be sorry to see it,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Robin</name> lowe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng his voice. <q>'If we all got angry together something might be d<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. But it's these <name type="ORG">Men</name>, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, the Chief's <name type="ORG">Men</name>. He sends them round everywhere, and if any of us small folk stand up for our <name type="GPE">ri</name>ghts, they drag him off to the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ckholes. They took old <name type="PERSON">Flourdumpling</name>, old Will <name type="PERSON">Whitfoot</name> the <name type="DATE">May</name>or, <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>, and they've taken a lot more. Lately it's been getting worse. Of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> they beat 'em now.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="ORG">'Then</name> why do you do their work far them?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> ang<name type="GPE">ri</name>ly. <q><name type="CARDINAL">'Who</name> sent you to <name type="ORG">Frogmorton</name>?'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'No</name> <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> did. We stay here in the big Shir<name type="GPE">ri</name>ff-house. We're the <name type="ORDINAL">First</name> <name type="LOC">East</name>farthing Troop now. There's <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name>s of Shir<name type="GPE">ri</name>ffs all told and they <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t more, with all these new rules. Most of them are in it against their will, but not all. Even in the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> there are some as like minding other folk's business and talking big. And there's worse than that: there's a few as do spy-work for the Chief and his <name type="ORG">Men</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Ah! So that's how you had news of us, is it?'</q></p>
<p><q>'That's <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght. We aren't allowed to send by it now, but they use the old <name type="ORG">Quick Post</name> service, and keep special runners at different points. <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> came in from <name type="ORG">Whitfurrows</name> <name type="TIME">last <name type="TIME">night</name></name> with a "<name type="ORG">sec</name>ret message", and another took it on from here. And a message came back this <name type="TIME">after<name type="TIME">noon</name></name> saying you was to be arrested and taken to <name type="PERSON">Bywater</name>, not direct to the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ckholes. The Chief <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ts to see you at once, evidently.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="CARDINAL">'He</name> won't be so eager when Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> has finished with him,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>.</p>
<p>The Shir<name type="GPE">ri</name>ff-house at <name type="ORG">Frogmorton</name> was as bad as the <name type="FAC">B<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge</name>-house. It had only <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> storey, but it had the same narrow windows, and it was built of ugly pale b<name type="GPE">ri</name>cks, badly laid. Inside it was damp and cheerless, and supper was served on a long bare table that had not been scrubbed for <name type="DATE">week</name>s. The food deserved no better setting. The travellers were glad to leave the place. It was <name type="CARDINAL">about <name type="CARDINAL">eight</name>een</name> miles to <name type="PERSON">Bywater</name>, and they set off at <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> o'clock in the <name type="TIME">morning</name>. They would have started earlier, only the delay so plainly annoyed the Shir<name type="GPE">ri</name>ff-leader. The west wind had shifted northward and it was turning colder, but the rain was g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>.</p>
<p>It was rather a comic cavalcade that left the village, though the few folk that came out to stare at the 'get-up' of the travellers did not seem quite sure whether laughing was allowed. <name type="CARDINAL">A <name type="CARDINAL">dozen</name></name> Shir<name type="GPE">ri</name>ffs had been told off as escort to the 'p<name type="GPE">ri</name>s<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>rs'; but <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> made them <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ch in front, while <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and his f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends rode behind. <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>, <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>, and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> sat at their ease laughing and talking and singing, while the Shir<name type="GPE">ri</name>ffs stumped along trying to look stern and imp<name type="GPE">ortan</name>t. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, however, was silent and looked rather sad and thoughtful.</p>
<p>The last person they passed was a sturdy old gaffer clipping a hedge. <q>'<name type="ORG">Hullo</name>, <name type="ORG">hullo</name>!'</q> he jeered. <q><name type="DATE">'No</name>w who's arrested who?'</q></p>
<p><name type="CARDINAL">Two</name> of the Shir<name type="GPE">ri</name>ffs immediately left the party and went towards him. <q>'Leader!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'Order your fellows back to their places at once, if you don't <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t me to deal with them!'</q></p>
<p>The <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> hobbits at a sharp word from the leader came back sulkily. <q><name type="DATE">'No</name>w get on!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>, and after that the travellers saw to it that their ponies' pace was quick enough to push the Shir<name type="GPE">ri</name>ffs along as fast as they could go. The sun came out, and in spite of the c<name type="ORG">hill</name>y wind they were soon puffing and sweating.</p>
<p>At the <name type="PERSON">Thr</name>ee-Farthing <name type="ORG">St<name type="CARDINAL">one</name></name> they gave it up. They had d<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> nearly <name type="CARDINAL">four</name>teen miles with only <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> rest at <name type="TIME">noon</name>. It was now <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> o'clock. They were hungry and very footsore and they could not stand the pace.</p>
<p><q>'Well, come along in your own time!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'We are going on.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="CARDINAL">'Go</name>od-bye, <name type="PERSON">Cock-robin</name>!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <q>'I'll wait for you outside _The <name type="ORG">Green</name> Dragon_, if you haven't forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> where that is. Don't dawdle on the way!'</q></p>
<p><q>'You're breaking arrest, that's what you're doing,'</q> said the leader ruefully, <q>'and I can't be answerable.'</q></p>
<p><q>'We shall break a good many things yet, and not ask you to answer ' said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <name type="CARDINAL">'Go</name>od luck to you!'</q></p>
<p>The travellers trotted on, and as the sun began to sink towards the White <name type="LOC">Downs</name> far away on the western ho<name type="GPE">ri</name>zon they came to <name type="PERSON">Bywater</name> by its wide pool; and there they had their <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> really painful shock. This was <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>'s own country, and they found out now that they cared about it more than any other place in the world. Many of the houses that they had known were missing. Some seemed to have been burned down. The pleasant row of old hobbit-holes in the bank on the north side of the Pool were deserted, and their little gardens that used to run down b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght to the water's edge were rank with weeds. Worse, there was a whole line of the ugly new houses all along <name type="FAC">Pool Side</name>, where the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbiton <name type="FAC">Road</name> ran close to the bank. An avenue of trees had stood there. They were all g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. And looking with dismay up the road towards <name type="FAC">Bag End</name> they saw a tall chimney of b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ck in the distance. It was pou<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng out black smoke into the <name type="TIME">evening</name> air.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> was beside himself. <q>'I'm going <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght on, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>!'</q> he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed. <q>'I'm going to see what's up. I <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t to find my gaffer.'</q></p>
<p><q>'We ought to find out <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> what we're in for, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'I guess that the "Chief" will have a gang of <name type="ORG">ruffian</name>s handy. We had better find some<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> who will tell us how things are round here.'</q></p>
<p>But in the village of <name type="PERSON">Bywater</name> all the houses and holes were shut, and no <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> greeted them. They wondered at this, but they soon discovered the reason of it. When they reached _The <name type="ORG">Green</name> Dragon_, the last house on the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbiton side, now lifeless and with broken windows, they were disturbed to see <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> <name type="CARDINAL">a <name type="CARDINAL">dozen</name></name> large ill-favoured <name type="ORG">Men</name> lounging against the inn-wall; they were squint-eyed and sallow-faced.</p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'Like</name> that f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end of <name type="PERSON">Bill</name> <name type="PERSON">Ferny</name>'s at <name type="PERSON">Bree</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>.</p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'Like</name> many that I saw at <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard,'</q> muttered <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>.</p>
<p>The <name type="ORG">ruffian</name>s had clubs in their hands and horns by their belts, but they had no other weapons, as far as could be seen. As the travellers rode up they left the wall and walked into the road, blocking the way.</p>
<p><q>'Where d'you think you're going?'</q> said <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, the largest and most evil-looking of the crew. <q>'There's no road for you any further. And where are those precious Shir<name type="GPE">ri</name>ffs?'</q></p>
<p><q>'Coming along nicely,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'A little footsore, perhaps. We promised to wait for them here.'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Garn</name>, what did I say?'</q> said the <name type="ORG">ruffian</name> to his mates. <q>'I told <name type="PERSON">Sharkey</name> it was no good trusting those little fools. Some of our chaps ought to have been sent.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="PERSON">'And</name> what difference would that have made, pray?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'We are not used to footpads in this country, but we know how to deal with them.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Footpads, eh?'</q> said the man: <q><name type="CARDINAL">'So</name> that's your t<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, is it? Change it, or we'll change it for you. You little folk are getting too <name type="WORK_OF_ART">uppish</name>. Don't you trust too much in the Boss's kind heart. <name type="PERSON">Sharkey</name>'s come now and he'll do what <name type="PERSON">Sharkey</name> says.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="PERSON">'And</name> what may that be?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> quietly.</p>
<p><q>'This country <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ts waking up and setting to <name type="GPE">ri</name>ghts,'</q> said the <name type="ORG">ruffian</name>, <q>'and <name type="PERSON">Sharkey</name>'s going to do it; and make it hard, if you d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ve him to it. You need a bigger Boss. And you'll get <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> before <name type="DATE">the <name type="DATE">year</name></name> is out, if there's any more trouble. Then you'll learn a thing or <name type="CARDINAL">two</name>, you little rat-folk.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Indeed. I am glad to hear of your plans,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'I am on my way to call on Mr. <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>tho, and he may be interested to hear of them too.'</q></p>
<p>The <name type="ORG">ruffian</name> laughed. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>tho! He knows all <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght. Don't you worry. He'll do what <name type="PERSON">Sharkey</name> says. Because if a Boss gives trouble, we can change him. See? And if little folks try to push in where they're not <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ted, we can put them out of mischief. See?'</q></p>
<p><q>'Yes, I see,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'For <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> thing, I see that you're behind the times and the news here. Much has happened since you left the <name type="LOC">South</name>. Your <name type="DATE">day</name> is over, and all other <name type="ORG">ruffian</name>s'. <name type="FAC">The Dark <name type="FAC">Tower</name></name> has fallen, and there is a <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g in <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>. And <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard has been destroyed, and your precious master is a beggar in the wilderness. I passed him on the road. The <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g's messengers will <name type="GPE">ri</name>de up the <name type="ORG">Green</name>way now not bullies from <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard.'</q></p>
<p>The man stared at him and smiled. <q>'A beggar in the wilderness!'</q> he mocked. <q><name type="DATE">'Oh</name>, is he indeed? Swagger it, swagger it, my little cock-a-whoop. But that won't stop us living in this fat little country where you have lazed long enough. And' � he snapped his fingers in <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s face � '<name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g's messengers! That for them! When I see <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, I'll take notice, perhaps.'</q></p>
<p>This was too much for <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. His thoughts went back to the Field of <name type="GPE">Cormallen</name>, and here was a squint-eyed rascal calling the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>-bearer 'little cock-a-whoop'. He cast back his cloak, flashed out his sword, and the silver and sable of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> gleamed on him as he rode forward.</p>
<p><q>'I am a messenger of the <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g,'</q> he said. <q>'You are speaking to the <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g's f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end, and <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the most renowned in all the lands of the <name type="LOC">West</name>. You are a <name type="ORG">ruffian</name> and a fool. Down on your knees in the road and ask pardon, or I will set this troll's bane in you!'</q></p>
<p>The sword glinted in the weste<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng sun. <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> drew their swords also and rode <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name> support <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>; but <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> did not move. The <name type="ORG">ruffian</name>s gave back. Sca<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng <name type="PERSON">Bree</name>land peasants, and bullying bewildered hobbits, had been their work. Fearless hobbits with b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght swords and g<name type="GPE">ri</name>m faces were a great surp<name type="GPE">ri</name>se. And there was a note in the voices of these newcomers that they had not heard before. It c<name type="ORG">hill</name>ed them with fear.</p>
<p><q><name type="CARDINAL">'Go</name>!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'If you trouble this village again, you will regret it.'</q> The <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> hobbits came on, and then the <name type="ORG">ruffian</name>s turned and fled running away up the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbiton <name type="FAC">Road</name>; but they blew their horns as they ran.</p>
<p><q>'Well, we've come back n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> too soon,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>.</p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'No</name>t <name type="DATE">a <name type="DATE">day</name></name> too soon. Perhaps too late, at any rate to save <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>tho,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'Miserable fool, but I am sorry for him.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Save <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>tho? Whatever do you mean?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q>'Destroy him I should say.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I don't think you quite understand things, <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>tho never meant things to come to this pass. He has been a wicked fool, but he's caught now. The <name type="ORG">ruffian</name>s are on top, gathe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng, robbing and bullying, and running or ruining things as they like, in his name. And not in his name even for much longer. He's a p<name type="GPE">ri</name>s<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>r in <name type="FAC">Bag End</name> now, I expect, and very f<name type="GPE">ri</name>gh<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed. We ought to try and rescue him.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Well I am staggered!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q><name type="DATE">'Of</name> all the ends to our journey that is the very last I should have thought of: to have to fight <name type="CARDINAL">half</name>-orcs and <name type="ORG">ruffian</name>s in the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> itself � to rescue <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>tho <name type="PERSON">Pimple</name>!'</q></p>
<p><q>'Fight?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'Well, I suppose it may come to that. But remember: there is to be no slaying of hobbits, not even if they have g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> over to the other side. Really g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> over, I mean; not just obeying <name type="ORG">ruffian</name>s' orders because they are f<name type="GPE">ri</name>gh<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed. No hobbit has ever killed another on purpose in the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>, and it is not to begin now. And nobody is to be killed at all, if it can be helped. Keep your tempers and hold your hands to the last possible moment!'</q></p>
<p><q>'But if there are many of these <name type="ORG">ruffian</name>s,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>, <q>'it will certainly mean fighting. You won't rescue <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>tho, or the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>, just by being shocked and sad, my dear <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'No</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q><name type="DATE">'It</name> won't be so easy sca<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng them a <name type="ORG">sec</name>ond time. They were taken by surp<name type="GPE">ri</name>se. You heard that horn-blowing? Evidently there are other <name type="ORG">ruffian</name>s near at hand. They'll be much bolder when there's more of them together. We ought to think of taking cover somewhere for the <name type="TIME">night</name>. After all we're only <name type="CARDINAL">four</name>, even if we are armed.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I've an idea,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <q>'Let's go to old <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> <name type="PERSON">Cotton</name>'s down <name type="LOC">South</name> Lane! He always was a stout fellow. And he has a lot of lads that were all f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends of mine.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'No</name>!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q><name type="DATE">'It</name>'s no good "getting under cover". That is just what people have been doing, and just what these <name type="ORG">ruffian</name>s like. They will simply come down on us in force, corner us, and then d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ve us out, or burn us in. No, we have got to do something at once.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Do what?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>.</p>
<p><q>'Raise the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <name type="DATE">'No</name>w! Wake all our people! They hate all this, you can see: all of them except perhaps <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> or <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> rascals, and a few fools that <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t to be imp<name type="GPE">ortan</name>t, but don't at all understand what is really going on. But <name type="LOC">Shire</name>-folk have been so comfortable so long they don't know what to do. They just <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t a match, though, and they'll go up in fire. The Chief's <name type="ORG">Men</name> must know that. They'll try to stamp on us and put us out quick. We've only got a very short time.</p>
<p><q><name type="ORG">'<name type="PERSON">Sam</name></name>, you can make a dash for <name type="PERSON">Cotton</name>'s farm, if you like. He's the chief person round here, and the sturdiest. <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Come</name> on! I am going to blow the horn of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>, and give them all some music they have never heard before.'</q></p>
<p>They rode back to the middle of the village. There <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> turned aside and galloped off down the lane that led south to <name type="PERSON">Cotton</name>'s. He had not g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> far when he heard a sudden clear horn-call go up <name type="GPE">ri</name>nging into the sky. Far over <name type="ORG">hill</name> and field it echoed; and so compelling was that call that <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> himself almost turned and dashed back. His pony reared and neighed.</p>
<p><q>'On, lad! On!'</q> he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed. <q>'We'll be going back soon.'</q></p>
<p>Then he heard <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> change the note, and up went the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>rn-cry of <name type="PERSON">Buckland</name>, shaking the air.</p>
<p>_Awake! Awake! Fear, <name type="ORG">Fire</name>, <name type="ORG">Foes</name>! Awake!</p>
<p><name type="ORG">Fire</name>, <name type="ORG">Foes</name>! Awake!_</p>
<p>Behind him <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> heard a hubbub of voices and a great din and slamming of doors. In front of him lights sprang out in the gloaming; dogs barked; feet came running. Before he got to the lane's end there was Farmer <name type="PERSON">Cotton</name> with <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> of his lads, Young <name type="PERSON">Tom</name>, Jolly, and <name type="PERSON">Nick</name>, hurrying towards him. They had axes in their hands, and barred the way.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Nay</name>! It's not <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of them <name type="ORG">ruffian</name>s,'</q> <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> heard the farmer say. <q><name type="DATE">'It</name>'s a hobbit by the size of it, but all dressed up queer. Hey!'</q> he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed. <q><name type="CARDINAL">'Who</name> are you, and what's all this to-do?'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'It</name>'s <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> <name type="PERSON">Gamgee</name>. I've come back.'</q></p>
<p>Farmer <name type="PERSON">Cotton</name> came up close and stared at him in the <name type="TIME">twilight</name>. <q>'Well!'</q> he exclaimed. <q>'The voice is <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght, and your face is no worse than it was, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. But I should a' passed you in the street in that gear. You've been in foreign parts, seemingly. We feared you were dead.'</q></p>
<p><q>'That I ain't!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <q><name type="DATE">'No</name>r Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. He's here and his f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends. And that's the to-do. They're raising the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>. We're going to clear out these <name type="ORG">ruffian</name>s, and their Chief too. We're starting now.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="CARDINAL">'Go</name>od, good!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed Farmer <name type="PERSON">Cotton</name>. <q><name type="CARDINAL">'So</name> it's begun at last! I've been it<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g for trouble all <name type="DATE">this <name type="DATE">year</name></name>, but folks wouldn't help. And I've had the wife and <name type="PERSON">Rosie</name> to think of. These <name type="ORG">ruffian</name>s don't stick at nothing. But come on now, lads! <name type="PERSON">Bywater</name> is up! We must be in it!'</q></p>
<p><q>'What about Mrs. <name type="PERSON">Cotton</name> and <name type="PERSON">Rosie</name>?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <q><name type="DATE">'It</name> isn't safe yet for them to be left all al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="CARDINAL">'My</name> <name type="PERSON">Nibs</name> is with them. But you can go and help him, if you have a mind,'</q> said Farmer <name type="PERSON">Cotton</name> with a g<name type="GPE">ri</name>n. Then he and his sons ran off towards the village.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> hur<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed to the house. By the large round door at the top of the steps from the wide yard stood Mrs. <name type="PERSON">Cotton</name> and <name type="PERSON">Rosie</name>, and <name type="PERSON">Nibs</name> in front of them grasping a hay-fork.</p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'It</name>'s me!'</q> shouted <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> as he trotted up. <q><name type="ORG">'<name type="PERSON">Sam</name></name> <name type="PERSON">Gamgee</name>! So don't try prodding me, <name type="PERSON">Nibs</name>. Anyway, I've a mail-shirt on me.'</q></p>
<p>He jumped down from his pony and went up the steps. They stared at him in silence. <q><name type="CARDINAL">'Go</name>od <name type="TIME">evening</name>, Mrs. <name type="PERSON">Cotton</name>!'</q> he said. <q>'<name type="ORG">Hullo</name> <name type="PERSON">Rosie</name>!'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="ORG">Hullo</name>, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Rosie</name>. <q>'Where've you been I They said you were dead; but I've been expecting you since the <name type="DATE">Sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng</name>. You haven't hur<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed have you?'</q></p>
<p><q>'Perhaps not,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> abashed. <q>'But I'm hurrying now. We're setting about the <name type="ORG">ruffian</name>s, and I've got to get back to Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. But I thought I'd have a look and see how Mrs. <name type="PERSON">Cotton</name> was keeping, and you, <name type="PERSON">Rosie</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q>'We're keeping nicely, thank you,'</q> said Mrs. <name type="PERSON">Cotton</name>. <q>'Or should be, if it weren't for these thieving <name type="ORG">ruffian</name>s.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Well, be off with you!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Rosie</name>. <q>'If you've been looking after Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> all this while, what d'you <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t to leave him for, as soon as things look dangerous?'</q></p>
<p>This was too much for <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. It needed <name type="DATE">a <name type="DATE">week</name></name>'s answer, or n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. He turned away and mounted his pony. But as he started off, <name type="PERSON">Rosie</name> ran down the steps.</p>
<p><q>'I think you look fine, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>,'</q> she said. <q><name type="CARDINAL">'Go</name> on now! But take care of yourself, and come straight back as soon as you have settled the <name type="ORG">ruffian</name>s!'</q></p>
<p>When <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> got back he found the whole village roused. Already, apart from many younger lads, more than <name type="CARDINAL">a <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name></name> sturdy hobbits were assembled with axes, and heavy hammers, and long knives, and stout staves: and a few had hunting-bows. More were still coming in from outlying farms.</p>
<p>Some of the village-folk had lit a large fire, just to enliven things, and also because it was <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the things forbidden by the Chief. It burned b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght as <name type="TIME">night</name> came on. Others at <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>'s orders were setting up bar<name type="GPE">ri</name>ers across the road at each end of the village. When the Shir<name type="GPE">ri</name>ffs came <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name> the lower <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> they were dumbfounded; but as soon as they saw how things were, most of them took off their feathers and joined in the revolt. The others slunk away.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> found <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and his f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends by the fire talking to old <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> <name type="PERSON">Cotton</name>, while an admi<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng crowd of <name type="PERSON">Bywater</name> folk stood round and stared.</p>
<p><q>'Well, what's the next move?'</q> said Farmer <name type="PERSON">Cotton</name>.</p>
<p><q>'I can't say,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, <q>'until I know more. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w many of these <name type="ORG">ruffian</name>s are there?'</q></p>
<p><q>'That's hard to tell,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Cotton</name>. <q>'They moves about and comes and goes. There's sometimes <name type="CARDINAL">fifty</name> of them in their sheds up <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbiton way; but they go out from there roving round, thieving or "gathe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng" as they call it. Still there's seldom less than a score round the Boss, as they names him. He's at <name type="FAC">Bag End</name>, or was; but he don't go outside the rounds now. No <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> s seen him at all, in fact, for <name type="DATE">a <name type="DATE">week</name></name> or <name type="CARDINAL">two</name>; but the <name type="ORG">Men</name> don't let no <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> go near.'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbiton's not their only place, is it?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>.</p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'No</name>, more's the pity,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Cotton</name>. <q>'There's a good few down south in <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ngbot<name type="PERSON">tom</name> and by Sarn <name type="ORG">Ford</name>, I hear; and some more lurking in the <name type="PERSON">Wood</name>y End; and they've sheds at <name type="FAC">Waymeet</name>. And then there's the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ckholes, as they call 'em: the old storage-tunnels at <name type="PERSON">Michel Delving</name> that they've made into p<name type="GPE">ri</name>sons for those as stand <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name> them. Still I reckon there's not above <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name> of them in the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> all told, and maybe less. We can master them, if we stick together.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Have they got any weapons?'</q> asked <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>.</p>
<p><q>'Whips, knives, and clubs, enough for their dirty work: that's all they've showed so far,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Cotton</name>. <q>'But I dare say they've got other gear, if it comes to fighting. Some have bows, anyway. They've shot <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> or <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> of our folk.'</q></p>
<p><q>'There you are, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'I knew we should have to fight. Well, they started the killing.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'No</name>t exactly,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Cotton</name>. <q>'Leastways not the shooting. <name type="PERSON">Took</name>s started that. You see our dad Mr. <name type="PERSON">Pereg<name type="GPE">ri</name>n</name>, he's never had no truck with this <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>tho, not from the beginning: said that if any<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> was going to play the chief at this time of <name type="DATE">day</name>, it would be the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght <name type="GPE">T<name type="PERSON">hai</name>n</name> of the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> and no upstart. And when <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>tho sent his <name type="ORG">Men</name> they got no change out of him. <name type="PERSON">Took</name>s are lucky, they've got those deep holes in the <name type="ORG">Green</name> <name type="ORG">Hill</name>s, <name type="LOC">the Great Smials</name> and all, and the <name type="ORG">ruffian</name>s can't come at 'em; and they won't let the <name type="ORG">ruffian</name>s come on their land. If they do, <name type="PERSON">Took</name>s hunt 'em. <name type="PERSON">Took</name>s shot <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> for prowling and robbing. After that the <name type="ORG">ruffian</name>s turned nastier. And they keep a pretty close watch on <name type="PERSON">Took</name>land. No <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> gets in nor out of it now.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="CARDINAL">'Go</name>od for the <name type="PERSON">Took</name>s!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q>'But some<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> is going to get in again, now. I am off to the Smials. Any<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> coming with me to <name type="GPE">Tuckborough</name>?'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> rode off with <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> <name type="CARDINAL">a <name type="CARDINAL">dozen</name></name> lads on ponies. <q>'See you soon!'</q> he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed. <q><name type="DATE">'It</name>'s only <name type="CARDINAL">four</name>teen miles or so over the fields. I'll b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng you back an army of <name type="PERSON">Took</name>s in the <name type="TIME">morning</name>.'</q> <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> blew a horn-call after them as they rode off into the gathe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng <name type="TIME">night</name>. The people cheered.</p>
<p><q><name type="PERSON">'All</name> the same,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> to all those who stood near, <q>'I wish for no killing; not even of the <name type="ORG">ruffian</name>s, unless it must be d<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, to prevent them from hurting hobbits.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="PERSON">'All</name> <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'But we shall be having a visit from the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbiton gang any time now, I think. They won't come just to talk things over. We'll try to deal with them neatly, but we must be prepared for the worst. Now I've got a plan.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Very good,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'You make the arrangements.'</q></p>
<p>Just then some hobbits, who had been sent out towards <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbiton, came running in. <q>'They're coming!'</q> they said. <q>'A score or more. But <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> have g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> off west across country.'</q></p>
<p><q>'To <name type="FAC">Waymeet</name>, that'll be,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Cotton</name>, <q>'to fetch more of the gang. Well, it's <name type="CARDINAL">fifteen</name> mile each way. We needn't trouble about them just yet.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Merry</name> hur<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed off to give orders. Farmer <name type="PERSON">Cotton</name> cleared the street, sending every<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> indoors, except the older hobbits who had weapons of some sort. They had not long to wait. Soon they could hear loud voices, and then the tramping of heavy feet. Presently a whole squad of the <name type="ORG">ruffian</name>s came down the road. They saw the bar<name type="GPE">ri</name>er and laughed. They did not imagine that there was anything in this little land that would stand <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name> <name type="CARDINAL">twenty</name> of their kind together.</p>
<p>The hobbits opened the bar<name type="GPE">ri</name>er and stood aside. <q>'Thank you!'</q> the <name type="ORG">Men</name> jeered. <q><name type="DATE">'No</name>w run home to bed before you're whipped.'</q> Then they <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ched along the street shouting: <q>'Put those lights out! Get indoors and stay there! Or we'll take <name type="CARDINAL">fifty</name> of you to the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ckholes for <name type="DATE">a <name type="DATE">year</name></name>. Get in! The Boss is losing his temper.'</q></p>
<p>No <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> paid any heed to their orders; but as the <name type="ORG">ruffian</name>s passed, they closed in quietly behind and followed them. When the <name type="ORG">Men</name> reached the fire there was Farmer <name type="PERSON">Cotton</name> standing all al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> warming his hands.</p>
<p><q><name type="CARDINAL">'Who</name> are you, and what d'you think you're doing?'</q> said the <name type="ORG">ruffian</name>-leader.</p>
<p>Farmer <name type="PERSON">Cotton</name> looked at him slowly. <q>'I was just going to ask you that,'</q> he said. <q>'This isn't your country, and you're not <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ted.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Well, you're <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ted anyhow,'</q> said the leader. <q>'We <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t you. Take him lads! <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ckholes for him, and give him something to keep him quiet!'</q></p>
<p>The <name type="ORG">Men</name> took <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> step forward and stopped short. There rose a roar of voices all round them, and suddenly they were aware that Farmer <name type="PERSON">Cotton</name> was not all al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. They were surrounded. In the dark on the edge of the firelight stood a <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng of hobbits that had crept up out of the shadows. There was nearly <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name> of them, all holding some weapon.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Merry</name> stepped forward. <q>'We have met before,'</q> he said to the leader, <q>'and I warned you not to come back here. I warn you again: you are standing in the light and you are covered by archers. If you lay a finger on this farmer, or on any<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> else, you will be shot at once. Lay down any weapons that you have!'</q></p>
<p>The leader looked round. He was trapped. But he was not scared, not now with a score of his fellows to back him. He knew too little of hobbits to understand his pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>l. <name type="NORP">Foolish</name>ly he decided to fight. It would be easy to break out.</p>
<p><q><name type="CARDINAL">'At</name> 'em lads!'</q> he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed. <q>'Let 'em have it!'</q></p>
<p>With a long knife in his left hand and a club in the other he made a rush at the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng, trying to burst out back towards <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbiton. He aimed a savage blow at <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> who stood in his way. He fell dead with <name type="CARDINAL">four</name> arrows in him:</p>
<p>That was enough for the others. They gave in. Their weapons were taken from them, and they were roped together, and <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ched off to an empty hut that they had built themselves, and there they were tied hand and foot, and locked up under guard. The dead leader was dragged off and bu<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed.</p>
<p><q>'Seems almost too easy after all, don't it?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Cotton</name>. <q>'I said we could master them. But we needed a call. You came back in the <name type="GPE">nick</name> o' time, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q>'There's more to be d<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> still,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'If you're <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght in your reckoning, we haven't dealt with a tithe of them yet. But it's dark now. I think the next stroke must wait until <name type="TIME">morning</name>. Then we must call on the Chief.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Why not now?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <q><name type="DATE">'It</name>'s not much <name type="TIME">more than <name type="CARDINAL">six</name> o'clock</name>. And I <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t to see my gaffer. D'you know what's come of him, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Cotton</name>?'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="CARDINAL">'He</name>'s not too well, and not too bad, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>,'</q> said the farmer. <q>'They dug up <name type="ORG">Bagshot Row</name>, and that was a sad blow to him. He's in <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of them new houses that the Chief's <name type="ORG">Men</name> used to build while they still did any work other than burning and thieving: not above <name type="QUANTITY">a mile</name> from the end of <name type="PERSON">Bywater</name>. But he comes around to me, when he gets a chance, and I see he's better <name type="ORG">fed</name> than some of the poor bodies. All against _The Rules_, of course. I'd have had him with me, but that wasn't allowed.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Thank'ee indeed, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Cotton</name>, and I'll never forget it,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <q>'But I <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t to see him. That Boss and that <name type="PERSON">Sharkey</name>, as they spoke of, they might do a mischief up there before the <name type="TIME">morning</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="PERSON">'All</name> <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Cotton</name>. <q>'Choose a lad or <name type="CARDINAL">two</name>, and go and fetch him to my house. You'll not have need to go near the old <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbiton village over Water. My Jolly here will show you.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> went off. <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> arranged for look-outs round the village and guards at the bar<name type="GPE">ri</name>ers du<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng the <name type="TIME">night</name>. Then he and <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> went off with Farmer <name type="PERSON">Cotton</name>. They sat with the family in the warm kitchen, and the <name type="PERSON">Cotton</name>s asked a few polite questions about their travels, but hardly lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed to the answers: they were far more concerned with events in the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>.</p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'It</name> all began with <name type="PERSON">Pimple</name>, as we call him,'</q> said Farmer <name type="PERSON">Cotton</name>; 'and it began as soon as you'd g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> off, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. He'd funny ideas had <name type="PERSON">Pimple</name>. Seems he <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ted to own everything himself, and then order other folk about. It soon came out that he already did own a sight more than was good for him; and he was always grabbing more, though where he got the m<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>y was a mystery: mills and malt-houses and inns, and farms, and leaf-plantations. He'd already bought <name type="PERSON">Sandyman</name>'s mill before he came to <name type="FAC">Bag End</name>, seemingly.</p>
<p><name type="DATE">'Of</name> course he started with a lot of property in the <name type="LOC">South</name>farthing which he had from his dad; and it seems he'd been selling a lot o' the best leaf, and sending it away quietly for <name type="DATE">a <name type="DATE">year</name></name> or <name type="CARDINAL">two</name>. But at the end o' <name type="DATE">last <name type="DATE">year</name></name> he began sending away loads of stuff, not only leaf. Things began to get short, and <name type="DATE">winter</name> coming on, too. Folk got angry, but he had his answer. A lot of <name type="ORG">Men</name>, <name type="ORG">ruffian</name>s mostly, came with great waggons, some to carry off the goods south-away, and others to stay. And more came. And before we knew where we were they were planted here and there all over the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>, and were felling trees and digging and building themselves sheds and houses just as they liked. At <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> goods and damage was paid for by <name type="PERSON">Pimple</name>; but soon they began lording it around and taking what they <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ted.</p>
<p><q><name type="ORG">'Then</name> there was a bit of trouble, but not enough. Old Will the <name type="DATE">May</name>or set off for <name type="FAC">Bag End</name> to protest, but he never got there. Ruffians laid hands on him and took and locked him up in a hole in <name type="PERSON">Michel Delving</name>, and there he is now. And after that, it would be soon after <name type="EVENT">New Year</name>, there wasn't no more <name type="DATE">May</name>or, and <name type="PERSON">Pimple</name> called himself Chief Shir<name type="GPE">ri</name>ff, or just Chief, and did as he liked; and if any<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> got "<name type="WORK_OF_ART">uppish</name>" as they called it, they followed Will. So things went from bad to worse. There wasn't no smoke left, save for the <name type="ORG">Men</name>; and the Chief didn't hold with beer, save for his <name type="ORG">Men</name>, and closed all the inns; and everything except Rules got shorter and shorter, unless <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> could hide a bit of <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>'s own when the <name type="ORG">ruffian</name>s went round gathe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng stuff up "for fair dist<name type="GPE">ri</name>bution": which meant they got it and we didn't, except for the leavings which you could have at the Shir<name type="GPE">ri</name>ff-houses, if you could s<name type="PERSON">tom</name>ach them. All very bad. But since <name type="PERSON">Sharkey</name> came it's been plain ruination.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="CARDINAL">'Who</name> is this <name type="PERSON">Sharkey</name>?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'I heard <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the <name type="ORG">ruffian</name>s speak of him.'</q></p>
<p><q>'The biggest <name type="ORG">ruffian</name> o' the lot, seemingly,'</q> answered <name type="PERSON">Cotton</name>. <name type="DATE">'It</name> was about last harvest, end o' <name type="DATE">September</name> maybe, that we <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> heard of him. We've never seen him, but he's up at <name type="FAC">Bag End</name>; and he's the real Chief now, I guess. All the <name type="ORG">ruffian</name>s do what he says; and what he says is mostly hack, burn, and ruin; and now it's come to killing. There's no longer even any bad sense in it. They cut down trees and let 'em lie, they burn houses and build no more.</p>
<p><q>'Take <name type="PERSON">Sandyman</name>'s mill now. <name type="PERSON">Pimple</name> knocked it down almost as soon as he came to <name type="FAC">Bag End</name>. Then he brought in a lot o' dirty-looking <name type="ORG">Men</name> to build a bigger <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> and fill it full o' wheels and outlandish contraptions. Only that fool <name type="PERSON">Ted</name> was pleased by that, and he works there cleaning wheels for the <name type="ORG">Men</name>, where his dad was the <name type="PERSON">Miller</name> and his own master. <name type="PERSON">Pimple</name>'s idea was to g<name type="GPE">ri</name>nd more and faster, or so he said. He's got other mills like it. But you've got to have g<name type="GPE">ri</name>st before you can g<name type="GPE">ri</name>nd; and there was no more for the new mill to do than for the old. But since <name type="PERSON">Sharkey</name> came they don't g<name type="GPE">ri</name>nd no more corn at all. They're always a-hamme<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng and a-letting out a smoke and a s<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ch, and there isn't no peace even at <name type="TIME">night</name> in <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbiton. And they pour out filth a purpose; they've fouled all the lower Water and it's getting down into <name type="ORG">Brand</name>ywine. If they <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t to make the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> into a desert, they're going the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght way about it. I don't believe that fool of a <name type="PERSON">Pimple</name>'s behind all this. It's <name type="PERSON">Sharkey</name>, I say.'</q></p>
<p><q>'That's <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght!'</q> put in Young <name type="PERSON">Tom</name>. 'Why, they even took <name type="PERSON">Pimple</name>'s old ma, that <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>belia, and he was fond of her, if no <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> else was. Some of the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbiton folk, they saw it. She comes down the lane with her old umbrella. Some of the <name type="ORG">ruffian</name>s were going up with a big cart.</p>
<p>' "Where be you a-going?" says she.</p>
<p>' "To <name type="FAC">Bag End</name>," says they.</p>
<p>' "What for?" says she.</p>
<p>' "To put up some sheds for <name type="PERSON">Sharkey</name>," says they.</p>
<p>' "Who said you could?" says she.</p>
<p>' "<name type="PERSON">Sharkey</name>," says they. "So get out o' the road, old hagling!"</p>
<p><q>' "I'll give you <name type="PERSON">Sharkey</name>, you dirty thieving <name type="ORG">ruffian</name>s!" says she, and ups with her umbrella and goes for the leader. near twice her size. So they took her. Dragged her off to the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ckholes, at her age too. They've took others we miss more, but there's no denying she showed more spi<name type="GPE">ri</name>t than most.'</q></p>
<p>Into the middle of this talk came <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, bursting in with his gaffer. Old <name type="PERSON">Gamgee</name> did not look much older, but he was a little deafer.</p>
<p><q><name type="CARDINAL">'Go</name>od <name type="TIME">evening</name>. Mr. <name type="PERSON">Baggins</name>!'</q> he said. <q>'Glad indeed I am to see you safe back. But I've a b<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> to pick with you, in a manner o' speaking, if I may make so bold. You didn't never ought to have a' sold <name type="FAC">Bag End</name>, as I always said. That's what started all the mischief. And while you're been trapessing in foreign parts, chasing <name type="ORG">Black</name> <name type="ORG">Men</name> up mountains from what my <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> says, though what for he don't make clear, they've been and dug up <name type="ORG">Bagshot Row</name> and ruined my taters!'</q></p>
<p><q>'I am very sorry, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Gamgee</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'But now I've come back, I'll do my best to make amends.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Well, you can't say fairer than that,'</q> said the gaffer. <q>'Mr. _<name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>_ <name type="PERSON">Baggins</name> is a real gentlehobbit, I always have said, whatever you may think of some others of the name, begging your pardon. And I hope my <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>'s behaved hisself and given satisfaction?'</q></p>
<p><q>'Perfect satisfaction, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Gamgee</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'Indeed, if you will believe it, he's now <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the most famous people in all the lands, and they are making songs about his deeds from here to the <name type="LOC">Sea</name> and beyond the <name type="LOC">Great <name type="LOC">River</name></name>.'</q> <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> blushed, but he looked gratefully at <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, for <name type="PERSON">Rosie</name>'s eyes were shining and she was smiling at him.</p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'It</name> takes a lot o' believing,'</q> said the gaffer, <q>'though I can see he's been mixing in strange company. What's come of his <name type="ORG">weskit</name>? I don't hold with wea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng ironmongery, whether it wears well or no.'</q></p>
<p>Farmer <name type="PERSON">Cotton</name>'s household and all his guests were up <name type="TIME">early next <name type="TIME">morning</name></name>. Nothing had been heard in the <name type="TIME">night</name>, but more trouble would certainly come before the <name type="DATE">day</name> was old. <q>'Seems as if n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> o' the <name type="ORG">ruffian</name>s were left up at <name type="FAC">Bag End</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Cotton</name>; <q>'but the gang from <name type="FAC">Waymeet</name> will be along any time now.'</q></p>
<p>After breakfast a messenger from the <name type="PERSON">Took</name>land rode in. He was in high spi<name type="GPE">ri</name>ts. <q>'The <name type="GPE">T<name type="PERSON">hai</name>n</name> has raised all our country,'</q> he said, <q>'and the news is going like fire all ways. The <name type="ORG">ruffian</name>s that were wat<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g our land have fled off south, those that escaped alive. The <name type="GPE">T<name type="PERSON">hai</name>n</name> has g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> after them, to hold off the big gang down that way; but he's sent Mr <name type="PERSON">Pereg<name type="GPE">ri</name>n</name> back with all the other folk he can spare.'</q></p>
<p>The next news was less good. <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>, who had been out <name type="TIME">all <name type="TIME">night</name></name>, came <name type="GPE">ri</name>ding in <name type="TIME">about <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> o'clock</name>. <q>'There's a big band <name type="CARDINAL">about <name type="CARDINAL">four</name></name> miles away,'</q> he said. <q>'They're coming along the road from <name type="FAC">Waymeet</name>, but a good many stray <name type="ORG">ruffian</name>s have joined up with them. There must be close on <name type="CARDINAL">a <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name></name> of them; and they're fire-raising as they come. Curse them!'</q></p>
<p><q>'Ah! This lot won't stay to talk, they'll kill, if they can,'</q> said Farmer <name type="PERSON">Cotton</name>. <q>'If <name type="PERSON">Took</name>s don't come so<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>r, we'd best get behind cover and shoot without arguing. There's got to be some fighting before this is settled, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.'</q></p>
<p>The <name type="PERSON">Took</name>s did come so<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>r. Before long they <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ched in, <name type="CARDINAL">a <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name></name> strong, from <name type="GPE">Tuckborough</name> and the <name type="ORG">Green</name> <name type="ORG">Hill</name>s with <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> at their head. <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> now had enough sturdy hobbitry to deal with the <name type="ORG">ruffian</name>s. Scouts reported that they were keeping close together. They knew that the countryside had <name type="GPE">ri</name>sen against them, and plainly meant to deal with the rebellion ruthlessly, at its centre in <name type="PERSON">Bywater</name>. But however g<name type="GPE">ri</name>m they, might be, they seemed to have no leader among them who understood warfare. They came on without any precautions. <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> laid his plans quickly.</p>
<p>The <name type="ORG">ruffian</name>s came tramping along the <name type="LOC">East</name> <name type="FAC">Road</name>, and without halting turned up the <name type="PERSON">Bywater</name> <name type="FAC">Road</name>, which ran for some way sloping up between high banks with low hedges on top. Round a bend, about a furlong from the main road, they met a stout bar<name type="GPE">ri</name>er of old farm-carts upturned. That halted them. At the same moment they became aware that the hedges on both sides, just above their heads, were all lined with hobbits. Behind them other hobbits now pushed out some more waggons that had been hidden in a field, and so blocked the way back. A voice spoke to them from above.</p>
<p><q>'Well, you have walked into a trap,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'Your fellows from <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbiton did the same, and <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> is dead and the rest are p<name type="GPE">ri</name>s<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>rs. Lay down your weapons! Then go back <name type="CARDINAL">twenty</name> paces and sit down. Any who try to break out will be shot.'</q></p>
<p>But the <name type="ORG">ruffian</name>s could not now be cowed so easily. A few of them obeyed, but were immediately set on by their fellows. A score or more broke back and charged the waggons. <name type="CARDINAL">Six</name> were shot, but the remainder burst out, killing <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> hobbits, and then scatte<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng across country in the direction of the <name type="PERSON">Wood</name>y End. <name type="CARDINAL">Two</name> more fell as they ran. <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> blew a loud horn-call, and there were answe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng calls from a distance.</p>
<p><q>'They won't get far,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q><name type="PERSON">'All</name> that country is alive with our hunters now.'</q></p>
<p>Behind, the trapped <name type="ORG">Men</name> in the lane, still <name type="CARDINAL">about <name type="CARDINAL">four</name></name> score, t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed to climb the bar<name type="GPE">ri</name>er and the banks, and the hobbits were obliged to shoot many of them or hew them with axes. But many of the strongest and most desperate got out on the west side, and attacked their enemies fiercely, being now more bent on killing than escaping. Several hobbits fell, and the rest were wave<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng, when <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>, who were on the east side, came across and charged the <name type="ORG">ruffian</name>s. <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> himself slew the leader, a great squint-eyed brute like a huge orc. Then he drew his forces off, encircling the last remnant of the <name type="ORG">Men</name> in a wide <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng of archers.</p>
<p>At last all was over. <name type="CARDINAL">Nearly <name type="CARDINAL">seven</name>ty</name> of the <name type="ORG">ruffian</name>s lay dead on the field, and <name type="CARDINAL">a <name type="CARDINAL">dozen</name></name> were p<name type="GPE">ri</name>s<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>rs. <name type="CARDINAL">Nine</name>teen hobbits were killed, and <name type="CARDINAL">some <name type="CARDINAL">thirty</name></name> were wounded. The dead <name type="ORG">ruffian</name>s were laden on waggons and hauled off to an old sand-pit nearby and there bu<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed: in the <name type="PERSON">Battle</name> Pit, as it was afterwards called. The fallen hobbits were laid together in a grave on the <name type="ORG">hill</name>-side, where later a great st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> was set up with a garden about it. So ended the <name type="PERSON">Battle</name> of <name type="PERSON">Bywater</name>, <name type="DATE">1<name type="CARDINAL">4</name>19</name>, the last battle fought in the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>, and the only battle since the <name type="ORG">Green</name>fields, <name type="CARDINAL">11<name type="CARDINAL">4</name>7</name>, away up in the <name type="LOC">North</name>farthing. In consequence, though it happily cost very few lives, it has a chapter to itself in the Red Book, and the names of all those who took part were made into a Roll, and learned by heart by <name type="LOC">Shire</name>-histo<name type="GPE">ri</name>ans. The very considerable <name type="GPE">ri</name>se in the fame and fortune of the <name type="PERSON">Cotton</name>s dates from this time; but at the top of the Roll in all accounts stand the names of Captains <name type="PERSON">Me<name type="GPE">ri</name>adoc</name> and <name type="PERSON">Pereg<name type="GPE">ri</name>n</name>.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> had been in the battle, but he had not drawn sword, and his chief part had been to prevent the hobbits in their wrath at their losses, from slaying those of their enemies who threw down their weapons. When the fighting was over, and the later labours were ordered, <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>, <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>, and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> joined him, and they rode back with the <name type="PERSON">Cotton</name>s. They ate a late mid<name type="DATE">day</name> meal, and then <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> said with a sigh: <q>'Well, I suppose it is time now that we dealt with the "Chief".'</q></p>
<p><q>'Yes indeed; the so<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>r the better,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q><name type="PERSON">'And</name> don't be too gentle! He's responsible for b<name type="GPE">ri</name>nging in these <name type="ORG">ruffian</name>s, and for all the evil they have d<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>.'</q></p>
<p>Farmer <name type="PERSON">Cotton</name> collected an escort of some <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> <name type="CARDINAL">dozen</name> sturdy hobbits. <q>'For it's only a guess that there is no <name type="ORG">ruffian</name>s left at <name type="FAC">Bag End</name>,'</q> he said. <q>'We don't know.'</q> Then they set out on foot. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>, and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> led the way.</p>
<p>It was <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the saddest <name type="TIME">hour</name>s in their lives. The great chimney rose up before them; and as they drew near the old village across the Water, through rows of new mean houses along each side of the road, they saw the new mill in all its frowning and dirty ugliness: a great b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ck building straddling the stream, which it fouled with a steaming and stinking overflow. All along the <name type="PERSON">Bywater</name> <name type="FAC">Road</name> every tree had been felled.</p>
<p>As they crossed the b<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge and looked up the <name type="ORG">Hill</name> they gasped. Even <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>'s vision in the <name type="ORG">Mirror</name> had not prepared him for what they saw. <name type="ORG">The Old Grange</name> on the west side had been knocked down, and its place taken by rows of tarred sheds. All the chestnuts were g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. The banks and hedgerows were broken. Great waggons were standing in disorder in a field bea<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> bare of grass. <name type="ORG">Bagshot Row</name> was a yawning sand and gravel quarry. <name type="FAC">Bag End</name> up. beyond could not be seen for a clutter of large huts.</p>
<p><q>'They've cut it down!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <q>'They've cut down the <name type="ORG">Party</name> <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>!'</q> He pointed to where the tree. had stood under which <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> had made his <name type="PERSON">Farewell</name> <name type="ORG">Speech</name>. It was lying lopped and dead in the field. As if this was the last straw <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> burst into tears.</p>
<p>A laugh put an end to them. There was a surly hobbit lounging over the low wall of the mill-yard. He was g<name type="GPE">ri</name>my-faced and black-handed. <q>'Don't 'ee like it, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>?'</q> he sneered. <q>'But you always was soft. I thought you'd g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> off in <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> o' them ships you used to prattle about, sailing, sailing. What d'you <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t to come back for? We've work to do in the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> now.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="CARDINAL">'So</name> I see,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <q><name type="DATE">'No</name> time for washing, but time for wall-propping. But see here, <name type="PERSON">Master <name type="PERSON">Sandyman</name></name>, I've a score to pay in this village, and don't you make it any longer with your jee<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng, or you'll foot a bill too big for your purse.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Ted</name> <name type="PERSON">Sandyman</name> spat over the wall: <q>'<name type="PERSON">Garn</name>!'</q> he said. <q>'You can't touch me. I'm a f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end o' the Boss's. But he'll touch you all <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght, if I have any more of your mouth.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Don't waste any more words on the fool, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'I hope there are not many more hobbits that have become like this. It would be a worse trouble than all the damage the <name type="ORG">Men</name> have d<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q>'You are dirty and insolent, <name type="PERSON">Sandyman</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q><name type="PERSON">'And</name> also very much out of your reckoning. We are just going up the <name type="ORG">Hill</name> to remove your precious Boss. We have dealt with his <name type="ORG">Men</name>.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Ted</name> <name type="PERSON">gape</name>d, for at that moment he <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> caught sight of the escort that at a sign from <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> now <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ched over the b<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge. Dashing back into the mill he ran out with a horn and blew it loudly.</p>
<p><q>'Save your breath!'</q> laughed <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'I've a better.'</q> Then lifting up his silver horn he winded it, and its clear call rang over the <name type="ORG">Hill</name>; and out of the holes and sheds and shabby houses of <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbiton the hobbits answered, and came pou<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng out, and with cheers and loud c<name type="GPE">ri</name>es they followed the company up the road to <name type="FAC">Bag End</name>.</p>
<p>At the top of the lane the party halted, and <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and his f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends went on; and they came at last to the once beloved place. The garden was full of huts and sheds, some so near the old westward windows that they cut off all their light. There were piles of refuse everywhere. The door was scarred; the bell-c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>n was dangling loose, and the bell would not <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng. Knocking brought no answer. At length they pushed and the door yielded. They went in. The place stank and was full of filth and disorder: it did not appear to have been used for some time.</p>
<p><q>'Where is that miserable <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>tho hiding?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. They had searched every room and found no living thing save rats and mice. <q>'Shall we turn on the others to search the sheds?'</q></p>
<p><q>'This is worse than <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <q>'Much worse in a way. It comes home to you, as they say; because it is home, and you remember it before it was all ruined.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Yes, this is <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'Just <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of its works. <name type="ORG">Saruman</name> was doing its work all the time, even when he thought he was working for himself. And the same with those that <name type="ORG">Saruman</name> t<name type="GPE">ri</name>cked, like <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>tho.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Merry</name> looked round in dismay and disgust. <q>'Let's get out!'</q> he said. <q>'If I had known all the mischief he had caused, I should have stuf<name type="ORG">fed</name> my pouch down <name type="ORG">Saruman</name>'s throat.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'No</name> doubt, no doubt! But you did not, and so I am able to welcome you home.'</q> There standing at the door was <name type="ORG">Saruman</name> himself, looking well-<name type="ORG">fed</name> and well-pleased; his eyes gleamed with malice and amusement.</p>
<p>A sudden light broke on <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Sharkey</name>!'</q> he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed.</p>
<p><name type="ORG">Saruman</name> laughed. <q><name type="CARDINAL">'So</name> you have heard the name, have you? All my people used to call me that in <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard, I believe. A sign of affection, possibly. But evidently you did not expect to see me here.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I did not,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. 'But I might have guessed. A little mischief in a mean way: <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> warned me that you were still capable of it.</p>
<p><q>'Quite capable,'</q> said <name type="ORG">Saruman</name>, <q>'and more than a little. You made me laugh, you hobbit-lordlings, <name type="GPE">ri</name>ding along with all those great people so <name type="ORG">sec</name>ure and so pleased with your little selves. You thought you had d<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> very well out of it all, and could now just amble back and have a nice quiet time in the country. <name type="ORG">Saruman</name>'s home could be all wrecked, and he could be turned out, but no <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> could touch yours. Oh no! <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> would look after your affairs.'</q></p>
<p><name type="ORG">Saruman</name> laughed again. <q><name type="DATE">'No</name>t he! When his tools have d<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> their task he drops them. But you must go dangling after him, dawdling and talking, and <name type="GPE">ri</name>ding round twice as far as you needed. "Well," thought I, "if they're such fools, I will get ahead of them and teach them a lesson. <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> ill turn deserves another." It would have been a sharper lesson, if only you had given me a little more time and more <name type="ORG">Men</name>. Still I have already d<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> much that you will find it hard to mend or undo in your lives. And it will be pleasant to think of that and set it against my inju<name type="GPE">ri</name>es.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Well, if that is what you find pleasure in,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, <q>'I pity you. It will be a pleasure of memory only, I fear. Go at once and never return!'</q></p>
<p>The hobbits of the villages had seen <name type="ORG">Saruman</name> come out of <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the huts, and at once they came crowding <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name> the door of <name type="FAC">Bag End</name>. When they heard <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s command, they murmured ang<name type="GPE">ri</name>ly:</p>
<p><q>'Don't let him go! Kill him! He's a villain and a murderer. Kill him!'</q></p>
<p><name type="ORG">Saruman</name> looked round at their hostile faces and smiled. <q>'Kill him!'</q> he mocked. <q>'Kill him, if you think there are enough of you, my brave hobbits!'</q> He drew himself up and stared at them darkly with his black eyes. <q>'But do not think that when I lost all my goods I lost all my power! Whoever st<name type="GPE">ri</name>kes me shall be accursed. And if my blood stains the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>, it shall wither and never again be healed.'</q></p>
<p>The hobbits recoiled. But <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> said: <q>'Do not believe him! He has lost all power, save his voice that can still daunt you and deceive you, if you let it. But I will not have him slain. It is useless to meet revenge with revenge: it will heal nothing. Go, <name type="ORG">Saruman</name>, by the speediest way!'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="ORG">Worm</name>! <name type="ORG">Worm</name>!'</q> <name type="ORG">Saruman</name> called; and out of a nearby hut came <name type="ORG">Worm</name>tongue, crawling, almost like a dog. To the road again, <name type="ORG">Worm</name>!<q>' said <name type="ORG">Saruman</name>. 'These fine fellows and lordlings are turning us ad<name type="GPE">ri</name>ft again. <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Come</name> along!'</q></p>
<p><name type="ORG">Saruman</name> turned to go, and <name type="ORG">Worm</name>tongue shuffled after him. But even as <name type="ORG">Saruman</name> passed close to <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> a knife flashed in his hand, and he stabbed swiftly. The blade turned on the hidden mail-coat and snapped. <name type="CARDINAL">A <name type="CARDINAL">dozen</name></name> hobbits, led by <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, leaped forward with a cry and flung the villain to the ground. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> drew his sword.</p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'No</name>, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'Do not kill him even now. For he has not hurt me. And in any case I do not wish him to be slain in this evil mood. He was great once, of a noble kind that we should not dare to raise our hands against. He is fallen, and his cure is beyond us; but I would still spare him, in the hope that he may find it.'</q></p>
<p><name type="ORG">Saruman</name> rose to his feet, and stared at <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. There was a strange look in his eyes of mingled wonder and respect and hatred. <q>'You have grown, <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>fling,'</q> he said. <q>'Yes, you have grown very much. You are wise, and cruel. You have robbed my revenge of sweetness, and now I must go hence in bitterness, in debt to your mercy. I hate it and you! Well, I go and I will trouble you no more. But do not expect me to wish you health and long life. You will have neither. But that is not my doing. I merely foretell.'</q></p>
<p>He walked away, and the hobbits made a lane for him to pass; but their knuckles whi<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed as they g<name type="GPE">ri</name>pped on their weapons. <name type="ORG">Worm</name>tongue hesitated, and then followed his master.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="ORG">Worm</name>tongue!'</q> called <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'You need not follow him. I know of no evil you have d<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> to me. You can have rest and food here for a while, until you are stronger and can go your own ways.'</q></p>
<p><name type="ORG">Worm</name>tongue halted and looked back at him, <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> prepared to stay. <name type="ORG">Saruman</name> turned. <q><name type="DATE">'No</name> evil?'</q> he cackled. <q><name type="DATE">'Oh</name> no! Even when he sneaks out at <name type="TIME">night</name> it is only to look at the stars. But did I hear some<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> ask where poor <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>tho is hiding? You know, don't you, <name type="ORG">Worm</name>? Will you tell them?'</q></p>
<p><name type="ORG">Worm</name>tongue cowered down and whimpered: <q><name type="DATE">'No</name>, no!'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="ORG">'Then</name> I will,'</q> said <name type="ORG">Saruman</name>. <q>'<name type="ORG">Worm</name> killed your Chief, poor little fellow, your nice little Boss. Didn't you, <name type="ORG">Worm</name>? Stabbed him in his sleep, I believe. Bu<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed him, I hope; though <name type="ORG">Worm</name> has been very hungry lately. No, <name type="ORG">Worm</name> is not really nice. You had better leave him to me.'</q></p>
<p>A look of wild hatred came into <name type="ORG">Worm</name>tongue's red eyes. <q>'You told me to; you made me do it,'</q> he hissed.</p>
<p><name type="ORG">Saruman</name> laughed. <q>'You do what <name type="PERSON">Sharkey</name> says, always, don't you, <name type="ORG">Worm</name>? Well, now he says: follow!'</q> He kicked <name type="ORG">Worm</name>tongue in the face as he grovelled, and turned and made off. But at that something snapped: suddenly <name type="ORG">Worm</name>tongue rose up, drawing a hidden knife, and then with a snarl like a dog he sprang on <name type="ORG">Saruman</name>'s back, jerked his head back, cut his throat, and with a yell ran off down the lane. Before <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> could recover or speak a word, <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> hobbit-bows t<name type="PERSON">wan</name>ged and <name type="ORG">Worm</name>tongue fell dead.</p>
<p>To the dismay of those that stood by, about the body of <name type="ORG">Saruman</name> a grey mist gathered, and <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing slowly to a great h<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name> like smoke from a fire, as a pale shrouded figure it loomed over the <name type="ORG">Hill</name>. For a moment it wavered, looking to the <name type="LOC">West</name>; but out of the <name type="LOC">West</name> came a cold wind, and it bent away, and with a sigh dissolved into nothing.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> looked down at the body with pity and horror, for as he looked it seemed that <name type="DATE">long <name type="DATE">year</name>s</name> of death were suddenly revealed in it, and it shrank, and the sh<name type="GPE">ri</name>velled face became rags of skin upon a hideous skull. Lifting up the skirt of the dirty cloak that sprawled beside it, he covered it over, and turned away.</p>
<p><q><name type="PERSON">'And</name> that's the end of that,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <q>'A nasty end, and I wish I needn't have seen it; but it's a good <name type="GPE">ri</name>ddance.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="PERSON">'And</name> the very last end of the War, I hope,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>.</p>
<p><q>'I hope so,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and sighed. <q>'The very last stroke. But to think that it should fall here, at the very door of <name type="FAC">Bag End</name>! Among all my hopes and fears at least I never expected that.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I shan't call it the end, till we've cleared up the mess,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> gloomily. <q><name type="PERSON">'And</name> that'll take a lot of time and work.'</q></p>
</chapter><chapter num="9"><heading>Chapter 9</heading>
<p>The <name type="ORG">Grey</name> <name type="GPE">Haven</name>s</p>
<p>The clea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng up certainly needed a lot of work, but it took less time than <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> had feared. <name type="DATE">The <name type="DATE">day</name></name> after the battle <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> rode to <name type="PERSON">Michel Delving</name> and released the p<name type="GPE">ri</name>s<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>rs from the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ckholes. <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> of the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> that they found was poor <name type="PERSON">Fredegar</name> <name type="PERSON">Bolger</name>, <name type="PERSON">Fatty</name> no longer. He had been taken when the <name type="ORG">ruffian</name>s smoked out a band of rebels that he led from their hidings up in the Brockenbores by the <name type="ORG">hill</name>s of Scary.</p>
<p><q>'You would have d<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> better to come with us after all, poor old <name type="PERSON">Fredegar</name>!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>, as they car<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed him out too weak to walk.</p>
<p>He opened an eye and t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed gallantly to smile. <q><name type="CARDINAL">'Who</name>'s this young giant with the loud voice?'</q> he whispered. <q><name type="DATE">'No</name>t little <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>! What's your size in hats now?'</q></p>
<p>Then there was <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>belia. Poor thing, she looked very old and thin when they rescued her from a dark and narrow cell. She insisted on hobbling out on her own feet; and she had such a welcome, and there was such clapping and chee<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng when she appeared, leaning on <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s arm but still clut<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g her umbrella, that she was quite touched, and drove away in tears. She had never in her life been popular before. But she was crushed by the news of <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>tho's murder, and she would' not return to <name type="FAC">Bag End</name>. She gave it back to <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, and went to her own people, the <name type="PERSON">Bracegirdle</name>s of <name type="GPE">Hardbottle</name>.</p>
<p>When the poor creature died next <name type="DATE">Sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng</name>-she was after all more than <name type="CARDINAL">a <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name></name> <name type="DATE">year</name>s old � <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> was surp<name type="GPE">ri</name>sed and much moved: she had left all that remained of her m<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>y and of <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>tho's for him to use in helping hobbits made homeless by the troubles. So that feud was ended.</p>
<p>Old Will <name type="PERSON">Whitfoot</name> had been in the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ckholes longer than any, and though he had perhaps been treated less harshly than some, he needed a lot of feeding up before he could look the part of <name type="DATE">May</name>or; so <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> agreed to act as his Deputy, until Mr. <name type="PERSON">Whitfoot</name> was in shape again. The only thing that he did as Deputy <name type="DATE">May</name>or was to reduce the Shir<name type="GPE">ri</name>ffs to their proper functions and numbers. The task of hunting out the last remnant of the <name type="ORG">ruffian</name>s was left to <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>, and it was soon d<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. The southern gangs, after hea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng the news of the <name type="PERSON">Battle</name> of <name type="PERSON">Bywater</name>, fled out of the land and offered little resistance to the <name type="GPE">T<name type="PERSON">hai</name>n</name>. Before <name type="EVENT">the Year's End</name> the few survivors were rounded up in the woods, and those that surrendered were shown to the borders.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the labour of repair went on apace, and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> was kept very busy. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbits can work like bees when the mood and the need comes on them. Now there were <name type="CARDINAL">thousands</name> of willing hands of all ages, from the small but nimble <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s of the hobbit lads and lasses to the well-worn and horny <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s of the gaffers and gammers. Before Yule not a b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ck was left standing of the new Shir<name type="GPE">ri</name>ff-houses or of anything that had been built by '<name type="PERSON">Sharkey</name>'s <name type="ORG">Men</name>'; but the b<name type="GPE">ri</name>cks were used to repair many an old hole, to make it snugger and d<name type="GPE">ri</name>er. Great stores of goods and food, and beer, were found that had been hidden away by the <name type="ORG">ruffian</name>s in sheds and barns and deserted holes, and especially in the tunnels at <name type="PERSON">Michel Delving</name> and in the old quar<name type="GPE">ri</name>es at Scary; so that there was a great deal better cheer that Yule than any<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> had hoped for.</p>
<p><name type="CARDINAL">One</name> of the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> things d<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> in <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbiton, before even the removal of the new mill, was the clea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng of the <name type="ORG">Hill</name> and <name type="FAC">Bag End</name>, and the restoration of <name type="ORG">Bagshot Row</name>. The front of the new sand-pit was all levelled and made into a large sheltered garden, and new holes were dug in the southward face, back into the <name type="ORG">Hill</name>, and they were lined with b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ck. The <name type="PERSON">Gaffer</name> was restored to Number <name type="PERSON">Thr</name>ee; and he said of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> and did not care who heard it:</p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'It</name>'s an ill wind as blows nobody no good, as I always say. And All's well as ends Better!'</q></p>
<p>There was some discussion of the name that the new row should be given. _<name type="PERSON">Battle</name> Gardens_ was thought of, or _Better Smials_. But after a while in sensible hobbit-fashion it was just called _New Row_. It was a purely <name type="PERSON">Bywater</name> joke to refer to it as <name type="PERSON">Sharkey</name>'s End.</p>
<p>The trees were the worst loss and damage, for at <name type="PERSON">Sharkey</name>'s bidding they had been cut down recklessly far and wide over the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>; and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> g<name type="GPE">ri</name>eved over this more than anything else. For <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> thing, this hurt would take long to heal, and only his great-grandchildren, he thought, would see the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> as it ought to be.</p>
<p>Then suddenly <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> <name type="DATE">day</name>, for he had been too busy for <name type="DATE">week</name>s to give a thought to his adventures, he remembered the gift of <name type="PERSON">Galad<name type="GPE">ri</name>el</name>. He brought the box out and showed it to the other <name type="ORG">Travellers</name> (for so they were now called by every<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>), and asked their advice.</p>
<p><q>'I wondered when you would think of it,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'Open it!'</q></p>
<p>Inside it was filled with a grey dust, soft and fine, in the middle of which was a seed, like a small nut with a silver shale. <q>'What can I do with this?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>.</p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'<name type="PERSON">Thr</name>ow</name> it in the air on <name type="DATE">a breezy <name type="DATE">day</name></name> and let it do its work!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>.</p>
<p><q>'On what?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>.</p>
<p><q>'Choose <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> spot as a nursery, and see what happens to the plants there,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>.</p>
<p><q>'But I'm sure the <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> would not like me to keep it all for my own garden, now so many folk have suffered,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>.</p>
<p><q>'Use all the wits and knowledge you have of your own, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, <q>'and then use the gift to help your work and better it. And use it spa<name type="GPE">ri</name>ngly. There is not much here, and I expect every grain has a value.'</q></p>
<p>So <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> planted saplings in all the places where specially beautiful or beloved trees had been destroyed, and he put a grain of the precious dust in the soil at the root of each. He went up and down the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> in this labour; but if he paid special at<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>tion to <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbiton and <name type="PERSON">Bywater</name> no <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> blamed him. And at the end he found that he still had a little of the dust left; so he went to the <name type="PERSON">Thr</name>ee-Farthing <name type="ORG">St<name type="CARDINAL">one</name></name>, which is as near the centre of the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> as no matter, and cast it in the air with his blessing. The little silver nut he planted in the <name type="ORG">Party</name> Field where the tree had once been; and he wondered what would come of it. All through <name type="DATE">the <name type="DATE">winter</name></name> he remained as patient as he could, and t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed to restrain himself from going round constantly to see if anything was happening.</p>
<p><name type="DATE">Sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng</name> surpassed his wildest hopes. His trees began to sprout and grow, as if time was in a hurry and wished to make <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> <name type="DATE">year</name> do for <name type="CARDINAL">twenty</name>. In the <name type="ORG">Party</name> Field a beautiful young sapling leaped up: it had silver bark and long leaves and burst into golden flowers in <name type="DATE">Ap<name type="GPE">ri</name>l</name>. It was indeed a _mallorn_, and it was the wonder of the neighbourhood. In after <name type="DATE">year</name>s, as it grew in grace and beauty, it was known far and wide and people would come long journeys to see it: the only _mallorn_ west of the <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s and east of the <name type="LOC">Sea</name>, and <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the finest in the world.</p>
<p>Altogether <name type="CARDINAL">1<name type="CARDINAL">4</name>20</name> in the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> was <name type="DATE">a <name type="PERSON">mar</name>vellous <name type="DATE">year</name></name>. Not only was there wonderful sunshine and delicious rain, in due times and perfect measure, but there seemed something more: an air of <name type="GPE">ri</name>chness and growth, and a gleam of a beauty beyond that of mortal <name type="DATE">summer</name>s that flicker and pass upon this <name type="LOC">Middle-<name type="LOC">earth</name></name>. All the children born or begot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> in <name type="DATE">that <name type="DATE">year</name></name>, and there were many, were fair to see and strong, and most of them had a <name type="GPE">ri</name>ch golden <name type="PERSON">hai</name>r that had before been rare among hobbits. The fruit was so plentiful that young hobbits very nearly bathed in strawber<name type="GPE">ri</name>es and cream; and later they sat on the lawns under the plum-trees and ate, until they had made piles of st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s like small pyramids or the heaped skulls of a conqueror, and then they moved on. And no <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> was ill, and every<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> was pleased. except those who had to mow the grass.</p>
<p>In the <name type="LOC">South</name>farthing the vines were laden, and the yield of <q>'leaf' was astonishing; and everywhere there was so much corn that at <name type="ORG">Harvest</name> every barn was stuf<name type="ORG">fed</name>. 'The <name type="LOC">North</name>farthing barley was so fine that the beer of <name type="CARDINAL">1<name type="CARDINAL">4</name>20</name> malt was long remembered and became a byword. Indeed <name type="DATE">a generation later <name type="CARDINAL">one</name></name> might hear an old gaffer in an inn, after a good pint of well-earned ale, put down his mug with a sigh: 'Ah! that was proper <name type="CARDINAL">four</name>teen-<name type="CARDINAL">twenty</name>, that was!'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> stayed at <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> at the <name type="PERSON">Cotton</name>s' with <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>; but when <name type="ORG">the New Row</name> was ready he went with the <name type="PERSON">Gaffer</name>. In addition to all his other labours he was busy directing the cleaning up and resto<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng of <name type="FAC">Bag End</name>; but he was of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> away in the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> on his forestry work. So he was not at home in early <name type="DATE">March</name> and did not know that <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> had been ill. On <name type="DATE">the <name type="CARDINAL">thirteen</name>th of that month</name> Farmer <name type="PERSON">Cotton</name> found <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> lying on his bed; he was clut<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g a white gem that hung on a c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>n about his neck and he seemed <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> in a dream.</p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'It</name> is g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> for ever,'</q> he said, <q>'and now all is dark and empty.'</q></p>
<p>But the fit passed, and when <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> got back on the <name type="CARDINAL">twenty</name>-<name type="ORDINAL">fifth</name>, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> had recovered, and he said nothing about himself. In the meanwhile <name type="FAC">Bag End</name> had been set in order, and <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> came over from <name type="ORG">C<name type="GPE">ri</name>ckhollow</name> b<name type="GPE">ri</name>nging back all the old furniture and gear, so that the old hole soon looked very much as it always had d<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>.</p>
<p>When all was at last ready <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> said: <q>'When are you going to move in and join me, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>?'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> looked a bit awkward.</p>
<p><q>'There is no need to come yet, if you don't <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t to,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'But you know the <name type="PERSON">Gaffer</name> is close at hand, and he will be very well looked after by <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Widow Rumble</name>.'</q></p>
<p>It's not that, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, and he went very red.</p>
<p><q>'Well, what is it?'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'It</name>'s <name type="PERSON">Rosie</name>, <name type="PERSON">Rose</name> <name type="PERSON">Cotton</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <q><name type="DATE">'It</name> seems she didn't like my going abroad at all, poor lass; but as I hadn't spoken, she couldn't say so. And I didn't speak, because I had a job to do <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>. But now I have spoken, and she says: "Well, you've wasted <name type="DATE">a <name type="DATE">year</name></name>, so why wait longer?" "Wasted?" I says. "I wouldn't call it that." Still I see what she means. I feel torn in <name type="CARDINAL">two</name>, as you might say.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I see,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>: <q>'you <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t to get <name type="PERSON">mar</name><name type="GPE">ri</name>ed, and yet you <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t to live with me in <name type="FAC">Bag End</name> too? But my dear <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, how easy! Get <name type="PERSON">mar</name><name type="GPE">ri</name>ed as soon as you can, and then move in with <name type="PERSON">Rosie</name>. There's room enough in <name type="FAC">Bag End</name> for as big a family as you could wish for.'</q></p>
<p>And so it was settled. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> <name type="PERSON">Gamgee</name> <name type="PERSON">mar</name><name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Rose</name> <name type="PERSON">Cotton</name> in the <name type="DATE">Sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng</name> of <name type="CARDINAL">1<name type="CARDINAL">4</name>20</name> (which was also famous for its weddings), and they came and lived at <name type="FAC">Bag End</name>. And if <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> thought himself lucky, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> knew that he was more lucky himself; for there was not a hobbit in the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> that was looked after with such care. When the labours of repair had all been planned and set going he took to a quiet life, w<name type="GPE">ri</name>ting a great deal and going through all his notes. He resigned the office of Deputy <name type="DATE">May</name>or at the Free <name type="ORG">Fair</name> that <name type="DATE">mid-<name type="DATE">summer</name></name>, and dear old Will <name type="PERSON">Whitfoot</name> had <name type="DATE">another <name type="CARDINAL">seven</name> <name type="DATE">year</name>s</name> of presiding at Banquets.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Merry</name> and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> lived together for some time at <name type="ORG">C<name type="GPE">ri</name>ckhollow</name>, and there was much coming and going between <name type="PERSON">Buckland</name> and <name type="FAC">Bag End</name>. The <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> young <name type="ORG">Travellers</name> cut a great dash in the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> with their songs and their tales and their finery, and their wonderful parties. <name type="ORG">'<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd</name>ly' folk called them, meaning nothing but good; for it warmed all hearts to see them go <name type="GPE">ri</name>ding by with their mail-shirts so b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght and their shields so splendid, laughing and singing songs of far away; and if they were now large and magnificent, they were unchanged otherwise, unless they were indeed more fairspoken and more jovial and full of mer<name type="GPE">ri</name>ment than ever before.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, however, went back to ordinary attire, except that when there was need they both wore long <name type="PERSON">grey cloaks</name>, finely woven and clasped at the throat with beautiful brooches; and Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> wore always a white jewel on a c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>n that he of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> would finger.</p>
<p>All things now went well, with hope always of becoming still better; and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> was as busy and as full of delight as even a hobbit could wish. Nothing for him <name type="PERSON">mar</name>red that whole <name type="DATE">year</name>, except for some vague anxiety about his master. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> dropped quietly out of all the doings of the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>, and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> was pained to notice how little honour he had in his own country. Few people knew or <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ted to know about his deeds and adventures; their admiration and respect were given mostly to Mr. <name type="PERSON">Me<name type="GPE">ri</name>adoc</name> and Mr. <name type="PERSON">Pereg<name type="GPE">ri</name>n</name> and (if <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> had known it) to himself. Also in the <name type="DATE">autumn</name> there appeared a shadow of old troubles.</p>
<p><name type="CARDINAL">One</name> <name type="TIME">evening</name> <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> came into the study and found his master looking very strange. He was very pale and his eyes seemed to see things far away.</p>
<p><q>'What's the matter, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>.</p>
<p><q>'I am wounded,'</q> he answered, <q>'wounded; it will never really heal.'</q></p>
<p>But then he got up, and the turn seemed to pass, and he was quite himself the next <name type="DATE">day</name>. It was not until afterwards that <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> recalled that the date was <name type="DATE">October</name> the <name type="CARDINAL">six</name>th. <name type="CARDINAL">Two</name> <name type="DATE">year</name>s before on that <name type="DATE">day</name> it was dark in the <name type="ORG">dell</name> under <name type="ORG">Weathertop</name>.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Tim</name>e went on, and <name type="CARDINAL">1<name type="CARDINAL">4</name>21</name> came in. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> was ill again in <name type="DATE">March</name>, but with a great effort he concealed it, for <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> had other things to think about. The <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> of <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> and <name type="PERSON">Rosie</name>'s children was born on the <name type="CARDINAL">twenty</name>-<name type="ORDINAL">fifth</name> of <name type="DATE">March</name>, a date that <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> noted.</p>
<p><q>'Well, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>,'</q> he said. <q>'I'm in a bit of a fix. <name type="PERSON">Rose</name> and me had settled to call him <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, with your leave; but it's not _him_, it's _her_. Though as pretty a maidchild as any <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> could hope for, taking after <name type="PERSON">Rose</name> more than me, luckily. So we don't know what to do.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Well, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, <q>'what's wrong with the old cus<name type="PERSON">tom</name>s? Choose a flower name like <name type="PERSON">Rose</name>. <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>f the maidchildren in the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> are called by such names, and what could be better?'</q></p>
<p><q>'I suppose you're <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <q>'I've heard some beautiful names on my travels, but I suppose they're a bit too grand for <name type="DATE">daily</name> wear and tear, as you might say. The <name type="PERSON">Gaffer</name>, he says: "Make it short, and then you won't have to cut it short before you can use it." But if it's to be a flower-name, then I don't trouble about the length: it must be a beautiful flower, because, you see, I think she is very beautiful, and is going to be beautifuller still.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> thought for a moment. <q>'Well, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, what about _elanor_, the sun-star, you remember the little golden flower in the grass of <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>thl�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en?'</q></p>
<p><q>'You're <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght again, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> delighted. <q>'That's what I <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ted.'</q></p>
<p>Little <name type="ORG">Elanor</name> was nearly <name type="CARDINAL">six</name> <name type="DATE">months</name> old, and <name type="CARDINAL">1<name type="CARDINAL">4</name>21</name> had passed to its <name type="DATE">autumn</name>, when <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> called <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> into the study.</p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'It</name> will be <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>'s Birth<name type="DATE">day</name> on <name type="DATE">Thurs<name type="DATE">day</name></name>, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>,'</q> he said. <q><name type="PERSON">'And</name> he will pass the Old <name type="PERSON">Took</name>. He will be <name type="CARDINAL">a <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name></name> and <name type="CARDINAL">thirty</name>-<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>!'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="CARDINAL">'So</name> he will!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <q><name type="CARDINAL">'He</name>'s a <name type="PERSON">mar</name>vel!'</q></p>
<p><q>'Well, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'I <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t you to see <name type="PERSON">Rose</name> and find out if she can spare you, so that you and I can go off together. You can't go far or for a long time now, of course,'</q> he said a little wistfully.</p>
<p><q>'Well, not very well, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'Of</name> course not. But never mind. You can see me on my way. Tell <name type="PERSON">Rose</name> that you won't be away very long, not more than a fort<name type="TIME">night</name>; and you'll come back quite safe.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I wish I could go all the way with you to <name type="GPE">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name>, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, and see Mr. <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <q><name type="PERSON">'And</name> yet the only place I really <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t to be in is here. I am that torn in <name type="CARDINAL">two</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="ORG">'Poor</name> <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>! It will feel like that, I am afraid,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'But you will be healed. You were meant to be solid and whole, and you will be.'</q></p>
<p>In the next <name type="DATE">day</name> or <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> went through his papers and his w<name type="GPE">ri</name>tings with <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, and he handed over his keys. There was a big book with plain red leather covers; its tall pages were now almost filled. At the beginning there were many leaves covered with <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>'s thin <name type="PERSON">wan</name>de<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng hand; but most of it was w<name type="GPE">ri</name>t<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> in <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s firm flowing sc<name type="GPE">ri</name>pt. It was divided into chapters but <name type="LAW">Chapter 80</name> was unfinished, and after that were some blank leaves. The title page had many titles on it, crossed out <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> after another, so:</p>
<p>_My Diary. My Unexpected Journey. There and Back Again. And What Happened After._</p>
<p>_<name type="WORK_OF_ART">Adventure</name>s of <name type="CARDINAL">Five</name> <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbits.

<p>Together with extracts from <name type="ORG">Books of <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>re</name> translated by <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> in <name type="GPE">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name>.</p>
<p><q>'Why, you have nearly finished it, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>!'</q> <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> exclaimed. <q>'Well, you have kept at it, I must say.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I have quite finished, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'The last pages are for you.'</q></p>
<p>On <name type="DATE">September</name> the <name type="CARDINAL">twenty</name>-<name type="ORDINAL">first</name> they set out together, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> on the pony that had borne him all the way from Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name>, and was now called <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>; and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> on his beloved <name type="PERSON">Bill</name>. It was a fair <name type="TIME">golden <name type="TIME">morning</name></name>, and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> did not ask where they were going: he thought he could guess.</p>
<p>They took the <name type="ORG">Stock</name> <name type="FAC">Road</name> over the <name type="ORG">hill</name>s and went towards the <name type="PERSON">Wood</name>y End, and they let their ponies walk at their leisure. They camped in the <name type="ORG">Green</name> <name type="ORG">Hill</name>s, and on <name type="DATE">September</name> the <name type="CARDINAL">twenty</name>-<name type="ORG">sec</name>ond they rode gently down into the beginning of the trees as <name type="TIME">after<name type="TIME">noon</name></name> was wea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng away.</p>
<p><q>'If that isn't the very tree you hid behind when the <name type="ORG">Black</name> <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name> <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> showed up, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> pointing to the left. <q><name type="DATE">'It</name> seems like a dream now.'</q></p>
<p>It was <name type="TIME">evening</name>, and the stars were glimme<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng in the eastern sky as they passed the ruined oak and turned and went on down the <name type="ORG">hill</name> between the hazel-thickets. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> was silent, deep in his memo<name type="GPE">ri</name>es. Presently he became aware that <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> was singing softly to himself, singing the old walking-song, but the words were not quite the same.</p>
<p>_Still round the corner there may wait</p>
<p>A new road or a <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret gate;</p>
<p>And though I oft have passed them by,</p>
<p><name type="DATE">A <name type="DATE">day</name></name> will come at last when I</p>
<p>Shall take the hidden paths that run</p>
<p><name type="LOC">West</name> of the <name type="PERSON">Moon</name>, <name type="LOC">East</name> of the <name type="ORG">Sun</name>._</p>
<p>And as if in answer, from down below, coming up the road out of the valley, voices sang:</p>
<p>_A! <name type="PERSON">Elbereth</name> <name type="PERSON">Gilthoniel</name>!</p>
<p>silivren penna m�<name type="GPE">ri</name>el</p>
<p>o <name type="ORG">menel</name> aglar elenath,</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Gilthoniel</name>, A! <name type="PERSON">Elbereth</name>!</p>
<p>We still remember, we who dwell</p>
<p>In this far land beneath the trees</p>
<p>The starlight on the <name type="LOC">West</name>ern <name type="LOC">Sea</name>s._</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> halted and sat silent in the soft shadows, until they saw a shimmer as the travellers came towards them.</p>
<p>There was <name type="PERSON">Gildor</name> and many fair <name type="ORG">Elven</name> folk; and there to <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>'s wonder rode <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name> and <name type="PERSON">Galad<name type="GPE">ri</name>el</name>. <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name> wore a mantle of grey and had a star upon his forehead, and a silver harp was in his hand, and upon his finger was a <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng of gold with a great blue st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, <name type="LOC">Vilya</name>, mightiest of the <name type="PERSON">Thr</name>ee. But <name type="PERSON">Galad<name type="GPE">ri</name>el</name> sat upon a white palfrey and was robed all in glimme<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng white, like clouds about the <name type="PERSON">Moon</name>; for she herself seemed to shine with a soft light. On her finger was <name type="PERSON">Nenya</name>, the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng wrought of _<name type="PERSON">mith<name type="GPE">ri</name>l</name>_, that bore a single white st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> flicke<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng like a frosty star. Riding slowly behind on a small grey pony, and seeming to nod in his sleep, was <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> himself.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Elrond</name> greeted them gravely and graciously, and <name type="PERSON">Galad<name type="GPE">ri</name>el</name> smiled upon them. <q>'Well, <name type="PERSON">Master <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>wise</name>,'</q> she said. <q>'I hear and see that you have used my gift well. The <name type="LOC">Shire</name> shall now be more than ever blessed and beloved.'</q> <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> bowed, but found nothing to say. He had forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> how beautiful the <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> was.</p>
<p>Then <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> woke up and opened his eyes. <q>'<name type="ORG">Hullo</name>, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>!'</q> he said. <q>'Well, I have passed the Old <name type="PERSON">Took</name> to<name type="DATE">day</name>! So that's settled. And now I think I am quite ready to go on another journey. Are you coming?'</q></p>
<p><q>'Yes, I am coming,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'The <name type="ORG">Ring</name>-bearers should go together.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Where are you going, Master?'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, though at last he understood what was happening.</p>
<p><q>'To the <name type="GPE">Haven</name>s, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.</p>
<p><q><name type="PERSON">'And</name> I can't come.'</q></p>
<p><q><name type="DATE">'No</name>, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. Not yet anyway, not further than the <name type="GPE">Haven</name>s. Though you too were a <name type="ORG">Ring</name>-bearer, if only for a little while. Your time may come. Do not be too sad, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. You cannot be always torn in <name type="CARDINAL">two</name>. You will have to be <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> and whole, for <name type="DATE">many <name type="DATE">year</name>s</name>. You have so much to enjoy and to be, and to do.'</q></p>
<p><q>'But,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, and tears started in his eyes, <q>'I thought you were going to enjoy the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>, too. for <name type="DATE">year</name>s and <name type="DATE">year</name>s, after all you have d<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>.'</q></p>
<p><name type="CARDINAL">'So</name> I thought too, once. But I have been too deeply hurt, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. I t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed to save the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>, and it has been saved, but not for me. It must of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> be so, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, when things are in danger: some <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> has to give them up, lose them, so that others may keep them. But you are my heir: all that I had and might have had I leave to you. And also you have <name type="PERSON">Rose</name>, and <name type="ORG">Elanor</name>; and <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>-lad will come, and <name type="PERSON">Rosie</name>-lass, and <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>, and Goldilocks, and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>; and perhaps more that I cannot see. Your hands and your wits will be needed everywhere. You will be the <name type="DATE">May</name>or, of course, as long as you <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t to be, and the most famous gardener in history; and you will read things out of the Red Book, and keep alive the memory of the age that is g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. so that people will remember the Great Danger and so love their beloved land all the more. And that will keep you as busy and as happy as any<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> can be, as long as your part of the Story goes on.</p>
<p><q><name type="WORK_OF_ART">'<name type="WORK_OF_ART">Come</name></name> now, <name type="GPE">ri</name>de with me!'</q></p>
<p>Then <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name> and <name type="PERSON">Galad<name type="GPE">ri</name>el</name> rode on; for the <name type="ORDINAL">Third</name> Age was over, and <name type="DATE">the Days</name> of the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>s were passed, and an end was come of the story and song of those times. With them went many <name type="ORG">Elves</name> of the High <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>dred who would no longer stay in <name type="LOC">Middle-<name type="LOC">earth</name></name>; and among them, filled with a sadness that was yet blessed and without bitterness, rode <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, and <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, and <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>, and the <name type="ORG">Elves</name> delighted to honour them.</p>
<p>Though they rode through the midst of the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> all the <name type="TIME">evening</name> and <name type="TIME">all the <name type="TIME">night</name></name>, n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> saw them pass, save the wild creatures; or here and there some <name type="PERSON">wan</name>derer in the dark who saw a swift shimmer under the trees, or a light and shadow flowing through the grass as the <name type="PERSON">Moon</name> went westward. And when they had passed from the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>, going about the south skirts of the White <name type="LOC">Downs</name>, they came to the Far <name type="LOC">Downs</name>, and to the <name type="FAC">Tower</name>s, and looked on the distant <name type="LOC">Sea</name>; and so they rode down at last to Mithlond, to the <name type="ORG">Grey</name> <name type="GPE">Haven</name>s in the long firth of <name type="ORG">Lune</name>.</p>
<p>As they came to the gates C�rdan the <name type="PERSON">Shipw<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght</name> came forth to greet them. Very tall he was, and his beard was long, and he was grey and old, save that his eyes were keen as stars; and he looked at them and bowed, and said: <q><name type="PERSON">'All</name> is now ready.'</q></p>
<p>Then C�rdan led them to the <name type="GPE">Haven</name>s, and there was a white ship lying, and upon the quay beside a great grey horse stood a figure robed all in white awaiting them. As he turned and came towards them <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> saw that <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> now wore openly upon his hand the <name type="ORDINAL">Third</name> <name type="ORG">Ring</name>, <name type="GPE">Narya</name> the Great, and the st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> upon it was red as fire. Then those who were to go were glad, for they knew that <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> also would take ship with them.</p>
<p>But <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> was now sorrowful at heart, and it seemed to him that if the parting would be bitter, more g<name type="GPE">ri</name>evous still would be the long road home al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. But even as they stood there, and the <name type="ORG">Elves</name> were going aboard, and all was being made ready to depart, up rode <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> in great haste. And amid his tears <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> laughed.</p>
<p><q>'You t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed to give us the slip once before and failed, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.'</q> he said. <q>'This time you have nearly succeeded, but you have failed again. It was not <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, though, that gave you away this time, but <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> himself!'</q></p>
<p><q>'Yes,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>; <q>'for it will be better to <name type="GPE">ri</name>de back <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> together 'than <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. Well, here at last, dear f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends, on the shores of the <name type="LOC">Sea</name> comes the end of our fellowship in <name type="LOC">Middle-<name type="LOC">earth</name></name>. Go in peace! I will not say: do not weep; for not all tears are an evil.'</q></p>
<p>Then <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> kissed <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>, and last of all <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, and went aboard; and the sails were drawn up, and the wind blew, and slowly the ship slipped away down the long grey firth; and the light of the glass of <name type="PERSON">Galad<name type="GPE">ri</name>el</name> that <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> bore glimmered and was lost. And the ship went out into the High <name type="LOC">Sea</name> and passed on into the <name type="LOC">West</name>, until at last on <name type="TIME">a <name type="TIME">night</name></name> of rain <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> smelled a sweet fragrance on the air and heard the sound of singing that came over the water. And then it seemed to him that as in his dream in the house of <name type="GPE">Bombadil</name>, the grey rain-curtain turned all to silver glass and was rolled back, and he beheld white shores and beyond them a far green country under a swift sun<name type="GPE">ri</name>se.</p>
<p>But to <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> the <name type="TIME">evening</name> deepened to darkness as he stood at the <name type="GPE">Haven</name>; and as he looked at <name type="FAC">the grey sea</name> he saw only a shadow on the waters that was soon lost in the <name type="LOC">West</name>. There still he stood far into the <name type="TIME">night</name>, hea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng only the sigh and murmur of the waves on the shores of <name type="LOC">Middle-<name type="LOC">earth</name></name>, and the sound of them sank deep into his heart. Beside him stood <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>, and they were silent.</p>
<p>At last the <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> companions turned away, and never again looking back they rode slowly homewards; and they spoke no word to <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> another until they came back to the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>. but each had great comfort in his f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends on the long grey road.</p>
<p>At last they rode over the downs and took the <name type="LOC">East</name> <name type="FAC">Road</name>, and then <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> rode on to <name type="PERSON">Buckland</name>; and already they were singing again as they went. But <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> turned to <name type="PERSON">Bywater</name>, and so came back up the <name type="ORG">Hill</name>, as <name type="DATE">day</name> was ending once more. And he went on, and there was yellow light, and fire within; and the <name type="TIME">evening</name> meal was ready, and he was expected. And <name type="PERSON">Rose</name> drew him in, and set him in his c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>r, and put little <name type="ORG">Elanor</name> upon his lap.</p>
<p>He drew a deep breath. <q>'Well, I'm back,'</q> he said.</p>
