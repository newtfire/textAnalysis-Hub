<p>The Departure of <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> sped on up the hill. Every now and again he bent to the ground. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbits go light, and their footp<name type="GPE">ri</name>nts are not easy even for a <name type="PRODUCT">Ranger</name> to read, but not far from the top a sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng crossed the path, and in the wet <name type="LOC">earth</name> he saw what he was seeking.</p>
<p><q>'I read the signs a<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght,'</q> he said to himself. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> ran to the hill-top. I wonder what he saw there? But he returned by the same way, and went down the hill again.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> hesitated. He desired to go to the high seat himself, hoping to see there something that would guide him in his perplexities; but time was pressing. Suddenly he leaped forward, and ran to the summit, across the great flag-st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s, and up the steps. Then sitting in the high seat he looked out. But the sun seemed darkened, and the world dim and remote. He turned from the <name type="LOC">North</name> back again to <name type="LOC">North</name>, and saw nothing save the distant hills, unless it were that far away he could see again a great bird like an eagle high in the air, descending slowly in wide circles down towards the <name type="LOC">earth</name>.</p>
<p>Even as he gazed his quick ears caught sounds in the woodlands below, on the west side of the <name type="LOC">River</name>. He stif<name type="PERSON">fen</name>ed. There were c<name type="GPE">ri</name>es, and among them, to his horror, he could distinguish the harsh voices of <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s. Then suddenly with a deep-throated call a great horn blew, and the blasts of it smote the hills and echoed in the hollows, <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing in a mighty shout above the roa<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng of <name type="DATE">the fall</name>s.</p>
<p><q>'The horn of <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>!'</q> he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed. <q>'He is in need!'</q> He sprang down the steps and away, leaping down the path. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Alas</name>! An ill fate is on me this <name type="DATE">day</name>, and all that I do goes amiss. Where is <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>?'</q></p>
<p>As he ran the c<name type="GPE">ri</name>es came louder, but fainter now and desperately the horn was blowing. <name type="PERSON">Fierce</name> and sh<name type="GPE">ri</name>ll rose the yells of the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s, and suddenly the horn-calls ceased. <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> raced down the last slope, but before he could reach the hill's foot, the sounds died away; and as he turned to the left and ran towards them they retreated, until at last he could hear them no more. Drawing his b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght sword and crying _<name type="PERSON">Elen</name>dil! <name type="PERSON">Elen</name>dil!_ he crashed through the trees.</p>
<p><name type="QUANTITY">A mile</name>, maybe, from <name type="FAC">Parth Galen</name> in a little glade not far from the lake he found <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>. He was sitting with his back to a great tree, as if he was resting. But <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> saw that he was pierced with many black-feathered arrows; his sword was still in his hand, but it was broken near the hilt; his horn cloven in <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> was at his side. Many <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s lay slain, piled all about him and at his feet.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> knelt beside him. <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> opened his eyes and strove to speak. At last slow words came. <q>'I t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed to take the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> from <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> ' he said. 'I am sorry. I have paid.'</q> His glance strayed to his fallen enemies; <name type="CARDINAL">twenty</name> at least lay there. <q>'They have g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>: the <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>flings: the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s have taken them. I think they are not dead. <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s bound them.'</q> He paused and his eyes closed wea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ly. After a moment he spoke again.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="LOC">Far</name>ewell, <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>! Go to Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name> and save my people! I have failed.'</q></p>
<p><q>'No!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>, taking his hand and kissing his brow. <q>'You have conquered. Few have gained such a victory. Be at peace! Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name> shall not fall!'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> smiled.</p>
<p><q>'Which way did they go? Was <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> there?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>.</p>
<p>But <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> did not speak again.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Alas</name>!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'Thus passes the heir of <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name>, <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd of the <name type="FAC">Tower</name> of <name type="ORG">Guard</name>! This is a bitter end. Now the <name type="ORG">Company</name> is all in ruin. It is I that have failed. <name type="PERSON">Vain</name> was <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>'s trust in me. What shall I do now? <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> has laid it on me to go to Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name>, and my heart desires it; but where are the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> and the <name type="ORG">Bear</name>er? <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w shall I find them and save the <name type="PRODUCT">Quest</name> from disaster?'</q></p>
<p>He knelt for a while, bent with weeping, still clasping <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>'s hand. So it was that <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> and <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> found him. They came from the western slopes of the hill, silently, creeping through the trees as if they were hunting. <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> had his axe in hand, and <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> his long knife: all his arrows were spent. When they came into the glade they halted in amazement; and then they stood a moment with heads bowed in g<name type="GPE">ri</name>ef, for it seemed to them plain what had happened.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Alas</name>!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>, coming to <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>'s side. <q>'We have hunted and slain many <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s in the woods, but we should have been of more use here. We came when we heard the horn-but too late, it seems. I fear you have taken deadly hurt.'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> is dead,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'I am unscathed, for I was not here with him. He fell de<name type="PERSON">fen</name>ding the hobbits, while I was away upon the hill.'</q></p>
<p><q>'The hobbits!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> <q>'Where are they then? Where is <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>?'</q></p>
<p><q>'I do not know,'</q> answered <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> wea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ly. <q>'Before he died <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> told me that the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s had bound them; he did not think that they were dead. I sent him to follow <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>; but I did not ask him if <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> or <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> were with him: not until it was too late. All that I have <name type="PERSON">don</name>e to<name type="DATE">day</name> has g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> amiss. What is to be <name type="PERSON">don</name>e now?'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="ORDINAL">First</name> we must <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>d <name type="DATE">the fall</name>en,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. <q>'We cannot leave him lying like car<name type="GPE">ri</name>on among these foul <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s.'</q></p>
<p><q>'But we must be swift,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. <q>'He would not wish us to linger. We must follow the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s, if there is hope that any of our <name type="ORG">Company</name> are living p<name type="GPE">ri</name>s<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>rs.'</q></p>
<p><q>'But we do not know whether the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>-bearer is with them or not ' said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. 'Are we to aban<name type="PERSON">don</name> him? Must we not seek him <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>? An evil choice is now before us!'</q></p>
<p><q>'Then let us do <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> what we must do,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. <q>'We have not the time or the tools to bury our comrade fitly, or to raise a mound over him. A cairn we might build.'</q></p>
<p><q>'The labour would be hard and long: there are no st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s that we could use nearer than the water-side,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>.</p>
<p><q>'Then let us lay him in a boat with his weapons, and the weapons of his vanquished foes,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'We will send him to the Falls of <name type="PERSON">Rauros</name> and give him to <name type="GPE">Anduin</name>. The <name type="LOC">River</name> of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> will take care at least that no evil creature dishonours his b<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s.'</q></p>
<p>Quickly they searched the bodies of the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s, gathe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng their swords and cloven helms and shields into a heap. <q>'See!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'Here we find tokens!'</q> He picked out from the pile of g<name type="GPE">ri</name>m weapons <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> knives, leaf-bladed, damasked in gold and red; and sear<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g further he found also the sheaths, black, set with small red gems. <q>'No orc-tools these!'</q> he said. <q>'They were borne by the hobbits. Doubtless the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s despoiled them, but feared to keep the knives, knowing them for what they are: work of <name type="LOC">West</name>ernesse, wound about with spells for the bane of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>. Well, now, if they still live, our f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends are weaponless. I will take these things, hoping against hope, to give them back.'</q></p>
<p><q>'And I,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>, <q>'will take all the arrows that I can find, for my quiver is empty.'</q> He searched in the pile and on the ground about and found not a few that were undamaged and longer in the shaft than such arrows as the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s were accus<name type="PERSON">tom</name>ed to use. He looked at them closely.</p>
<p>And <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> looked on the slain, and he said: <q>'Here lie many that are not folk of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>. Some are from the <name type="LOC">North</name>, from the <name type="LOC">Misty <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s</name>, if I know anything of <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s and their kinds. And here are others strange to me. Their gear is not after the manner of <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s at all!'</q></p>
<p>There were <name type="CARDINAL">four</name> goblin-soldiers of greater stature, <name type="PERSON">swart</name>, slant-eyed, with thick legs and large hands. They were armed with short broad-bladed swords, not with the curved scimitars usual with <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s: and they had bows of yew, in length and shape like the bows of <name type="ORG">Men</name>. Upon their shields they bore a strange device: a small white hand in the centre of a black field; on the front of their iron helms was set an S-rune, wrought of some white metal.</p>
<p><q>'I have not seen these tokens before,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'What do they mean?'</q></p>
<p><q>'S is for <name type="ORG">Sauron</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. <q>'That is easy to read.'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Nay</name>!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. <q>'<name type="ORG">Sauron</name> does not use the <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name>-runes.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Neither does he use his <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght name, nor permit it to be spelt or spoken,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'And he does not use white. The <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s in the service of <name type="FAC">Barad-d</name>�r use the sign of the Red <name type="PRODUCT">Eye</name>.'</q> He stood for a moment in thought. <q>'S is for <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>, I guess,'</q> he said at length. <q>'There is evil afoot in <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard, and the <name type="LOC">West</name> is no longer safe. It is as <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> feared: by some means the traitor <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> has had news of our journey. It is likely too that he knows of <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>'s fall. Pursuers from <name type="GPE">Mo<name type="GPE">ri</name>a</name> may have escaped the vigilance of L�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en, or they may have avoided that land and come to <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard by other paths. <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s travel fast. But <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> has many ways of learning news. Do you remember the birds?'</q></p>
<p><q>'Well, we have no time to ponder <name type="GPE">ri</name>ddles,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. <q>'Let us bear <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> away!'</q></p>
<p><q>'But after that we must guess the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ddles, if we are to choose our course <name type="GPE">ri</name>ghtly,'</q> answered <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="DATE">May</name>be there is no <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght choice,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>.</p>
<p>Taking his axe the <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Dwarf</name> now cut several branches. These they lashed together with bowst<name type="GPE">ri</name>ngs, and spread their cloaks upon the frame. Upon this rough bier they car<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed the body of their companion to the shore, together with such trophies of his last battle as they chose to send forth with him. It was only a short way, yet they found it no easy task, for <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> was a man both tall and strong.</p>
<p>At the water-side <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> remained, wat<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g the bier. while <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> and <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> has<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed back on foot to <name type="FAC">Parth Galen</name>. It was <name type="QUANTITY">a mile</name> or more, and it was some time before they came back, paddling <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> boats swiftly along the shore.</p>
<p><q>'There is a strange tale to tell!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. <q>'There are <name type="CARDINAL">only <name type="CARDINAL">two</name></name> boats upon the bank. We could find no trace of the other.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Have <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s been there?'</q> asked <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>.</p>
<p><q>'We saw no signs of them,'</q> answered <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. <q>'And <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s would have taken or destroyed all the boats, and the baggage as well.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I will look at the ground when we come there,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>.</p>
<p>Now they laid <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> in the middle of the boat that was to bear him away. The grey hood and <name type="ORG">elven</name>-cloak they folded and placed beneath his head. They combed his long dark <name type="PERSON">hai</name>r and arrayed it upon his shoulders. The golden belt of L�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en gleamed about his waist. His helm they set beside him, and across his lap they laid the cloven horn and the hilts and shards of his sword; beneath his feet they put the swords of his enemies. Then fas<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing the prow to the stern of the other boat, they drew him out into the water. They rowed sadly along the shore, and turning into the swift-running channel they passed the green sward of <name type="FAC">Parth Galen</name>. The steep sides of Tol <name type="ORG">Brand</name>ir were glowing: it was now mid-<name type="TIME">after<name type="TIME">noon</name></name>. As they went south the fume of <name type="PERSON">Rauros</name> rose and shimmered before them, a haze of gold. The rush and thunder of <name type="DATE">the fall</name>s shook the windless air.</p>
<p>Sorrowfully they cast loose the funeral boat: there <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> lay, restful, peaceful, gliding upon the bosom of the flowing water. The stream took him while they held their own boat back with their paddles. He floated by them, and slowly his boat departed, <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ing to a dark spot against the golden light; and then suddenly it vanished. <name type="PERSON">Rauros</name> roared on unchanging. The <name type="LOC">River</name> had taken <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> son of <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name>, and he was not seen again in Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name>, standing as he used to stand upon the White <name type="FAC">Tower</name> in the <name type="TIME">morning</name>. But in <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> in <name type="DATE">after-<name type="DATE">day</name>s</name> it long was said that the <name type="ORG">elven</name>-boat rode <name type="DATE">the fall</name>s and the foaming pool, and bore him down through <name type="NORP">Osgiliath</name>, and past the many mouths of <name type="GPE">Anduin</name>, out into the Great <name type="LOC">Sea</name> at <name type="TIME">night</name> under the stars.</p>
<p>For a while the <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> companions remained silent, gazing after him. Then <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> spoke. <q>'They will look for him from the White <name type="FAC">Tower</name>,'</q> he said, <q>'but he will not return from mountain or from sea.'</q> Then slowly he began to sing:</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Thr</name>ough <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> over <name type="PERSON">fen</name> and field where the long grass grows</p>
<p>The <name type="LOC">West</name> Wind comes walking, and about the walls it goes.</p>
<p>'What news from the <name type="LOC">West</name>, O <name type="PERSON">wan</name>de<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng wind, do you b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng to me to<name type="TIME">night</name>?</p>
<p>Have you seen <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> the Tall by moon or by starlight?'</p>
<p>'I saw him <name type="GPE">ri</name>de over <name type="CARDINAL">seven</name> streams, over waters wide and grey;</p>
<p>I saw him walk in empty lands, until he passed away</p>
<p>Into the shadows of the <name type="LOC">North</name>. I saw him then no more.</p>
<p>The <name type="LOC">North</name> Wind may have heard the horn of the son of <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name>.'</p>
<p>'O <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>! From the high walls westward I looked afar,</p>
<p>But you came not from the empty lands where no men are.'</p>
<p>Then <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> sang:</p>
<p>From the mouths of the <name type="LOC">Sea</name> the <name type="LOC">South</name> Wind flies, from the sandhills and the st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s;</p>
<p>The wailing of the gulls it bears, and at the gate it moans.</p>
<p>'What news from the <name type="LOC">South</name>, O sighing wind, do you b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng to me at eve?</p>
<p>Where now is <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> the <name type="ORG">Fair</name>? He tar<name type="GPE">ri</name>es and I g<name type="GPE">ri</name>eve.'</p>
<p>'Ask not of me where he doth dwell-so many b<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s there lie</p>
<p>On the white shores and the dark shores under the stormy sky;</p>
<p>So many have passed down <name type="GPE">Anduin</name> to find the flowing <name type="LOC">Sea</name>.</p>
<p>Ask of the <name type="LOC">North</name> Wind news of them the <name type="LOC">North</name> Wind sends to me!'</p>
<p>'O <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>! Beyond the gate the seaward road runs south,</p>
<p>But you came not with the wailing gulls from <name type="FAC">the grey sea</name>'s mouth.'</p>
<p>Then <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> sang again:</p>
<p>From the <name type="FAC">Gate</name> of <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>gs the <name type="LOC">North</name> Wind <name type="GPE">ri</name>des, and past the roa<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng falls;</p>
<p>And clear and cold about the tower its loud horn calls.</p>
<p>'What news from the <name type="LOC">North</name>, O mighty wind, do you b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng to me to<name type="DATE">day</name>?</p>
<p>What news of <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> the Bold? For he is long away.'</p>
<p>'Beneath <name type="PERSON">Amon <name type="ORG">Hen</name></name> I heard his cry. There many foes he fought.</p>
<p>His cloven shield, his broken sword, they to the water brought.</p>
<p>His head so proud, his face so fair, his limbs they laid to rest;</p>
<p>And <name type="PERSON">Rauros</name>, golden <name type="PERSON">Rauros</name>-falls, bore him upon its breast.'</p>
<p>'O <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>! The <name type="FAC">Tower</name> of <name type="ORG">Guard</name> shall ever northward gaze</p>
<p>To <name type="PERSON">Rauros</name>, golden <name type="PERSON">Rauros</name>-falls, until the end of <name type="DATE">day</name>s.'</p>
<p>So they ended. Then they turned their boat and drove it with all the speed they could against the stream back to <name type="FAC">Parth Galen</name>.</p>
<p><q>'You left the <name type="LOC">East</name> Wind to me,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>, <q>'but I will say naught of it.'</q></p>
<p><q>'That is as it should be,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'In Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name> they endure the <name type="LOC">East</name> Wind, but they do not ask it for tidings. But now <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> has taken his road. and we must make haste to choose our own.'</q></p>
<p>He surveyed the green lawn, quickly but thoroughly, stooping of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> to the <name type="LOC">earth</name>. <q>'The <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s have been on this ground,'</q> he said. <q>'Otherwise nothing can be made out for certain. All our footp<name type="GPE">ri</name>nts are here, crossing and re-crossing. I cannot tell whether any of the hobbits have come back since the search for <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> began.'</q> He returned to the bank, close to where the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ll from the sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ckled out into the <name type="LOC">River</name>. <q>'There are some clear p<name type="GPE">ri</name>nts here,'</q> he said. <q>'A hobbit waded out into the water and back; but I cannot say how <name type="DATE">long ago</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w then do you read this <name type="GPE">ri</name>ddle?'</q> asked <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> did not answer at once, but went back to the camping-place and looked at the baggage. <q>'<name type="CARDINAL">Two</name> packs are missing.'</q> he said, <q>'and <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> is certainly <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>'s: it was rather large and heavy. This then is the answer: <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> has g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> by boat, and his servant has g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> with him. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> must have returned while we were all away. I met <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> going up the hill and told him to follow me; but plainly he did not do so. He guessed his master s mind and came back here before <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> had g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. He did not find it easy to leave <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> behind!'</q></p>
<p><q>'But why should he leave us behind, and without a word?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. <q>'That was a strange deed!'</q></p>
<p><q>'And a brave deed,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Sam</name> was <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght, I think. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> did not wish to lead any f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end to death with him in <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>. But he knew that he must go himself. Something happened after he left us that overcame his fear and doubt.'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="DATE">May</name>be hunting <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s came on him and he fled,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>.</p>
<p><q>'He fled, certainly,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>, <q>'but not, I think, from <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s.'</q> What he thought was the cause of <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s sudden resolve and flight <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> did not say. The last words of <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> he long kept <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret.</p>
<p><q>'Well, so much at least is now clear,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>: <q>'<name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> is no longer on this side of the <name type="LOC">River</name>: only he can have taken the boat. And <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> is with him; only he would have taken his pack.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Our choice then,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>, <q>'is either to take the remaining boat and follow <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, or else to follow the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s on foot. There is little hope either way. We have already lost precious <name type="TIME">hour</name>s.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Let me think!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'And now may I make a <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght choice and change the evil fate of this unhappy <name type="DATE">day</name>!'</q> He stood silent for a moment. <q>'I will follow the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s,'</q> he said at last. <q>'I would have guided <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> to <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> and g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> with him to the end; but if I seek him now in the wilderness, I must aban<name type="PERSON">don</name> the captives to torment and death. My heart speaks clearly at last: the fate of the <name type="ORG">Bear</name>er is in my hands no longer. The <name type="ORG">Company</name> has played its part. Yet we that remain cannot forsake our companions while we have strength left. Come! We will go now. Leave all that can be spared behind! We will press on by <name type="DATE">day</name> and dark!'</q></p>
<p>They drew up the last boat and car<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed it to the trees. They laid beneath it such of their goods as they did not need and could not carry away. Then they left <name type="FAC">Parth Galen</name>. <name type="TIME">The <name type="TIME">after<name type="TIME">noon</name></name></name> was fading as they came back to the glade where <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> had fallen. There they picked up the trail of the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s. It needed little skill to find.</p>
<p><q>'No other folk make such a trampling,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. <q>'It seems their delight to slash and beat down growing things that are not even in their way.'</q></p>
<p><q>'But they go with a great speed for all that,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>, <q>'and they do not tire. And later we may have to search for our path in hard bare lands.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Well, after them!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. <q>'<name type="ORG">Dwarves</name> too can go swiftly, and they do not tire so<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>r than <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s. But it will be a long chase: they have a long start.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Yes,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>, <q>'we shall all need the endurance of <name type="ORG">Dwarves</name>. But come! With hope or without hope we will follow the trail of our enemies. And woe to them, if we prove the swifter! We will make such a chase as shall be accounted a <name type="PERSON">mar</name>vel among the <name type="PERSON">Thr</name>ee <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>dreds : <name type="ORG">Elves</name>. <name type="ORG">Dwarves</name>, and <name type="ORG">Men</name>. Forth the <name type="PERSON">Thr</name>ee <name type="PERSON">Hunt</name>ers!'</q></p>
<p>Like a deer he sprang away. <name type="PERSON">Thr</name>ough the trees he sped. On and on he led them, tireless and swift, now that his mind was at last made up. The woods about the lake they left behind. <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ng slopes they climbed, dark, hard-edged against the sky already red with sunset. Dusk came. They passed away, grey shadows in a stony land.</p>
</chapter><chapter num="2"><heading>Chapter 2</heading>
<p>The <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name></p>
<p>Dusk deepened. Mist lay behind them among the trees below, and brooded on the pale <name type="PERSON">mar</name>gins of the <name type="GPE">Anduin</name>, but the sky was clear. <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Stars</name> came out. The waxing moon was <name type="GPE">ri</name>ding in the <name type="LOC">West</name>, and the shadows of the rocks were black. They had come to the feet of stony hills, and their pace was slower, for the trail was no longer easy to follow. Here the highlands of the <name type="ORG">Emyn Muil</name> ran from <name type="LOC">North</name> to <name type="LOC">South</name> in <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> long tumbled <name type="GPE">ri</name>dges. The western side of each <name type="GPE">ri</name>dge was steep and difficult, but the eastward slopes were gentler, furrowed with many gullies and narrow ravines. <name type="TIME">All <name type="TIME">night</name></name> the <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> companions scrambled in this bony land, climbing to the crest of the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> and tallest <name type="GPE">ri</name>dge, and down again into the darkness of a deep winding valley on the other side.</p>
<p>There in the still cool <name type="TIME">hour</name> before <name type="TIME">dawn</name> they rested for a b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ef space. The moon had long g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> down before them, the stars glittered above them; the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> light of <name type="DATE">day</name> had not yet come over <name type="LOC">the dark hills</name> behind. For the moment <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> was at a loss: the orc-trail had descended into the valley, but there it had vanished.</p>
<p><q>'Which way would they turn, do you think?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. <q>'<name type="LOC">North</name>ward to take a straighter road to <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard, or <name type="PERSON">Fangorn</name>, if that is their aim as you guess? Or southward to st<name type="GPE">ri</name>ke the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>wash?'</q></p>
<p><q>'They will not make for the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver, whatever <name type="PERSON">mar</name>k they aim at''</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'And unless there is much amiss in <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> and the power of <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> is greatly increased; they will take the shortest way that they can find over the fields of the Rohir<name type="GPE">ri</name>m. Let us search northwards!'</q></p>
<p>The <name type="GPE">dale</name> ran like a stony trough between the <name type="GPE">ri</name>dged hills, and a t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ckling stream flowed among the boulders at the bot<name type="PERSON">tom</name>. A cliff frowned upon their <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght; to their left rose grey slopes, dim and shadowy in the late <name type="TIME">night</name>. They went on for <name type="QUANTITY">a mile</name> or more northwards. <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> was sear<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g. bent towards the ground, among the folds and gullies leading up into the western <name type="GPE">ri</name>dge. <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> was some way ahead. Suddenly the <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name> gave a cry and the others came running towards him.</p>
<p><q>'We have already overtaken some of those that we are hunting,'</q> he said. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok!'</q> He pointed, and they saw that what they had at <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> taken to be boulders lying at the foot of the slope were huddled bodies. <name type="CARDINAL">Five</name> dead <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s lay there. They had been hewn with many cruel strokes, and <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> had been beheaded. The ground was wet with their dark blood.</p>
<p><q>'Here is another <name type="GPE">ri</name>ddle!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. <q>'But it needs the light of <name type="DATE">day</name> and for that we cannot wait.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Yet however you read it, it seems not unhopeful,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. <q>'Enemies of the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s are likely to be our f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends. Do any folk dwell in these hills?'</q></p>
<p><q>'No,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'The Rohir<name type="GPE">ri</name>m seldom come here, and it is far from Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name>. It might be that some company of <name type="ORG">Men</name> were hunting here for reasons that we do not know. Yet I think not.'</q></p>
<p><q>'What do you think?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>.</p>
<p><q>'I think that the enemy brought his own enemy with him,'</q> answered <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'These are <name type="LOC">North</name>ern <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s from far away. Among the slain are n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the great <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s with the strange badges. There was a quarrel, I guess: it is no uncommon thing with these foul folk. <name type="DATE">May</name>be there was some dispute about the road.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Or about the captives,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. <q>'Let us hope that they, too, did not meet their end here.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> searched the ground in a wide circle, but no other traces of the fight could be found. They went on. Already the eastward sky was turning pale; the stars were fading, and a grey light was slowly growing. A little further north they came to a fold in which a tiny stream, falling and winding, had cut a stony path down into the valley. In it some <name type="PERSON">bush</name>es grew, and there were patches of grass upon its sides.</p>
<p><q>'At last!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'Here are the tracks that we seek! Up this water-channel: this is the way that the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s went after their debate.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Swift</name>ly now the pursuers turned and followed the new path. As if fresh from <name type="TIME">a <name type="TIME">night</name></name>'s rest they sprang from st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> to st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. At last they reached the crest of the <name type="ORG">grey hill</name>, and a sudden breeze blew in their <name type="PERSON">hai</name>r and stirred their cloaks: the chill wind of <name type="TIME">dawn</name>.</p>
<p>Turning back they saw across the <name type="LOC">River</name> the far hills kindled. Day leaped into the sky. The red <name type="GPE">ri</name>m of the sun rose over the shoulders of the dark land. Before them in the <name type="LOC">West</name> the world lay still, formless and grey; but even as they looked, the shadows of <name type="TIME">night</name> melted, the colours of the waking <name type="LOC">earth</name> returned: green flowed over the wide meads of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>; the white mists shimmered in the water<name type="GPE">vale</name>s; and far off to the left, <name type="CARDINAL">thirty</name> leagues or more, blue and purple stood the White <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s, <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing into peaks of jet, tipped with glimme<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng snows, flushed with the rose of <name type="TIME">morning</name>.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="ORG">Gondor</name>! <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. 'Would that I looked on you again in happier <name type="TIME">hour</name>! Not yet does my road lie southward to your b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght streams.</p>
<p><name type="ORG">Gondor</name>! <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>, between the <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s and the <name type="LOC">Sea</name>!</p>
<p><name type="LOC">West</name> Wind blew there; the light upon the Silver <name type="PERSON">Tree</name></p>
<p>Fell like b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght rain in gardens of the <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>gs of old.</p>
<p>O proud walls! White towers! O <name type="PERSON">winged crown</name> and thr<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of gold!</p>
<p>O <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>, <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>! Shall <name type="ORG">Men</name> behold the Silver <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>,</p>
<p>Or <name type="LOC">West</name> Wind blow again between the <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s and the <name type="LOC">Sea</name>?</p>
<p>Now let us go!' he said, drawing his eyes away from the <name type="LOC">South</name>, and looking out west and north to the way that he must tread.</p>
<p>The <name type="GPE">ri</name>dge upon which the companions stood went down steeply before their feet. Below it <name type="CARDINAL">twenty</name> fathoms or more, there was a wide and rugged shelf which ended suddenly in the b<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk of a sheer cliff: the <name type="LOC">East</name> Wall of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>. So ended the <name type="ORG">Emyn Muil</name>, and the green plains of the Rohir<name type="GPE">ri</name>m stretched away before them to the edge of sight.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>, pointing up into the pale sky above them. <q>'There is the eagle again! He is very high. He seems to be flying now away, from this land back to the <name type="LOC">North</name>. He is going with great speed. <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok!'</q></p>
<p><q>'No, not even my eyes can see him, my good <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'He must be far aloft indeed. I wonder what is his errand, if he is the same bird that I have seen before. But look! I can see something nearer at hand and more urgent; there is something moving over the plain!'</q></p>
<p><q>'Many things,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. <q>'It is a great company on foot; but I cannot say more, nor see what kind of folk they may be. They are many leagues away: <name type="CARDINAL">twelve</name>, I guess; but the flatness of the plain is hard to measure.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I think, n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>theless, that we no longer need any trail to tell us which way to go,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. <q>'Let us find a path down to the fields as quick as may be.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I doubt if you will find a path quicker than the <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> that the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s chose,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>.</p>
<p>They followed their enemies now by the clear light of <name type="DATE">day</name>. It seemed that the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s had pressed on with all possible speed. Every now and again the pursuers found things that had been dropped or cast away: food-bags, the <name type="GPE">ri</name>nds and crusts of hard grey bread. a torn black cloak, a heavy iron-nailed shoe broken on the st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s. The trail led them north along the top of the escarpment, and at length they came to a deep cleft carved in the rock by a stream that splashed noisily down. In the narrow ravine a rough path descended like a steep stair into the plain.</p>
<p>At the bot<name type="PERSON">tom</name> they came with a strange suddenness on the grass of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>. It swelled like a green sea <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name> the very foot of the <name type="ORG">Emyn Muil</name>. The falling stream vanished into a deep growth of cresses and water-plants, and they could hear it tinkling away in green tunnels, down long gentle slopes towards the <name type="PERSON">fen</name>s of <name type="ORG">Ent</name>wash Vale far away. They seemed to have left <name type="DATE">winter</name> clinging to the hills behind. Here the air was softer and warmer, and faintly scented, as if sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng was already stir<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng and the sap was flowing again in herb and leaf. <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> took a deep breath, like <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> that d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nks a great draught after long thirst in barren places.</p>
<p><q>'Ah! the green smell!'</q> he said. <q>'It is better than much sleep. Let us run!'</q></p>
<p><q>'Light feet may run swiftly here,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'More swiftly, maybe, than iron-shod <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s. Now we have a chance to lessen their lead!'</q></p>
<p>They went in single file, running like hounds on a strong scent, and an eager light was in their eyes. Nearly due west the broad swath of the <name type="PERSON">mar</name><name type="PERSON">chin</name>g <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s tramped its ugly slot; the sweet grass of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> had been bruised and blackened as they passed. Presently <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> gave a cry and turned aside. <q>'Stay!'</q> he shouted. <q>'Do not follow me yet!'</q> He ran quickly to the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght, away from the main trail; for he had seen footp<name type="GPE">ri</name>nts that went that way, bran<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g off from the others, the <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ks of small unshod feet. These, however, did not go far before they were crossed by orc-p<name type="GPE">ri</name>nts, also coming out from the main trail behind and in front, and then they curved sharply back again and were lost in the trampling. At the furthest point <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> stooped and picked up something from the grass; then he ran back.</p>
<p><q>'Yes,'</q> he said, 'they are quite plain: a hobbit's footp<name type="GPE">ri</name>nts. <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>'s I think. He is smaller than the other. And look at this! He held up a thing that glittered in the sunlight. It looked like the new-opened leaf of a beech-tree, fair and strange in that treeless plain.</p>
<p><q>'The brooch of an <name type="ORG">elven</name>-cloak!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> and <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> together.</p>
<p><q>'Not idly do the leaves of L�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en fall,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'This did not drop by chance: it was cast away as a token to any that might follow. I think <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> ran away from the trail for that purpose.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Then he at least was alive,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. <q>'And he had the use of his wits, and of his legs too. That is hear<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing. We do not pursue in vain.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Let us hope that he did not pay too dearly for his boldness,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. <q>'Come! Let us go on! The thought of those merry young folk d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ven like cattle burns my heart.'</q></p>
<p>The sun climbed to the <name type="TIME">noon</name> and then rode slowly down the sky. Light clouds came up out of the sea in the distant <name type="LOC">South</name> and were blown away upon the breeze. The sun sank. <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>s rose behind and reached out long arms from the <name type="LOC">East</name>. Still the hunters held on. <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> <name type="DATE">day</name> now had passed since <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> fell, and the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s were yet far ahead. No longer could any sight of them be seen in the level plains.</p>
<p>As <name type="TIME">night</name>shade was closing about them <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> halted. Only twice in the <name type="DATE">day</name>'s <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ch had they rested for a b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ef while, and <name type="CARDINAL">twelve</name> leagues now lay between them and the eastern wall where they had stood at <name type="TIME">dawn</name>.</p>
<p><q>'We have come at last to a hard choice,'</q> he said. <q>'Shall we rest by <name type="TIME">night</name>, or shall we go on while our will and strength hold?'</q></p>
<p><q>'Unless our enemies rest also, they will leave us far behind, if we stay to sleep.'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. <q>'Surely even <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s must pause on the <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ch?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. <q>'Seldom will <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s journey in the open under the sun. yet these have <name type="PERSON">don</name>e so,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. <q>'Certainly they will not rest by <name type="TIME">night</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q>'But if we walk by <name type="TIME">night</name>, we cannot follow their trail,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>.</p>
<p><q>'The trail is straight, and turns neither <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght nor left, as far as my eyes can see,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="DATE">May</name>be, I could lead you at guess in the darkness and hold to the line,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>; <q>'but if we strayed, or they turned aside, then when light came there might be long delay before the trail was found again.'</q></p>
<p><q>'And there is this also,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>: <q>'only by <name type="DATE">day</name> can we see if any tracks lead away. If a p<name type="GPE">ri</name>s<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>r should escape, or if <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> should be car<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed off, eastward, say, to the <name type="LOC">Great <name type="LOC">River</name></name>, towards <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>, we might pass the signs and never know it.'</q></p>
<p><q>'That is true,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'But if I read the signs back yonder <name type="GPE">ri</name>ghtly, the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s of the <name type="ORG">White Hand</name> prevailed, and the whole company is now bound for <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard. Their present course bears me out.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Yet it would be rash to be sure of their counsels,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. <q>'And what of escape? In the dark we should have passed the signs that led you to the brooch.'</q></p>
<p><q>'The <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s will be doubly on their guard since then, and the p<name type="GPE">ri</name>s<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>rs even wea<name type="GPE">ri</name>er,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. <q>'There will be no escape again, if we do not cont<name type="GPE">ri</name>ve it. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w that is to be <name type="PERSON">don</name>e cannot be guessed, but <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> we must overtake them.'</q></p>
<p><q>'And yet even I, <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Dwarf</name> of many journeys, and not the least hardy of my folk, cannot run all the way to <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard without any pause ' said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. 'My heart burns me too, and I would have started so<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>r but now I must rest a little to run the better. And if we rest, then the blind <name type="TIME">night</name> is the time to do so.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I said that it was a hard choice,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w shall we end this debate?'</q></p>
<p><q>'You are our guide,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>, <q>'and you are skilled in the chase. You shall choose.'</q></p>
<p><q>'My heart bids me go on,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. <q>'But we must hold together. I will follow your counsel.'</q></p>
<p><q>'You give the choice to an ill chooser,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'Since we passed through the <name type="PERSON">Argonath</name> my choices have g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> amiss.'</q> He fell silent gazing north and west into the gathe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng <name type="TIME">night</name> for a long while.</p>
<p><q>'We will not walk in the dark,'</q> he said at length. <q>'The pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>l of missing the trail or signs of other coming and going seems to me the greater. If the <name type="PERSON">Moon</name> gave enough light, we would use it, but alas! he sets early and is yet young and pale.'</q></p>
<p><q>'And to<name type="TIME">night</name> he is shrouded anyway,'</q> <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> murmured. <q>'Would that the <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> had given us a light, such a gift as she gave to <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>!'</q></p>
<p><q>'It will be more needed where it is bestowed,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'With him lies the true <name type="PRODUCT">Quest</name>. Ours is but a small matter in the great deeds of this time. A vain pursuit from its beginning, maybe, which no choice of mine can <name type="PERSON">mar</name> or mend. Well, I have chosen. So let us use the time as best we may!'</q></p>
<p>He cast himself on the ground and fell at once into sleep, for he had not slept since their <name type="TIME">night</name> under the shadow of Tol <name type="ORG">Brand</name>ir. Before <name type="TIME">dawn</name> was in the sky he woke and rose. <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> was still deep in slumber, but <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> was standing, gazing northwards into the darkness, thoughtful and silent as a young tree in <name type="TIME">a windless <name type="TIME">night</name></name>.</p>
<p><q>'They are far far away,'</q> he said sadly, turning to <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'I know in my heart that they have not rested this <name type="TIME">night</name>. Only an eagle could overtake them now.'</q></p>
<p><q>'N<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>theless we will still follow as we may,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <name type="PERSON">Stooping</name> he roused the <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Dwarf</name>. <q>'Come! We must go,'</q> he said. <q>'The scent is growing cold.'</q></p>
<p><q>'But it is still dark,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. <q>'Even <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> on a hill-top could not see them till the <name type="ORG">Sun</name> is up.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I fear they have passed beyond my sight from hill or plain, under moon or sun,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>.</p>
<p><q>'Where sight fails the <name type="LOC">earth</name> may b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng us rumour,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'The land must groan under their hated feet.'</q> He stretched himself upon the ground with his ear pressed against the turf. He lay there motionless, for so long a time that <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> wondered if he had swo<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>d or fallen asleep again. <name type="PERSON">Dawn</name> came glimme<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng, and slowly a grey light grew about them. At last he rose, and now his f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends could see his face: it was pale and drawn, and his look was troubled.</p>
<p><q>'The rumour of the <name type="LOC">earth</name> is dim and confused,'</q> he said. <q>'Nothing walks upon it for many miles about us. Faint and far are the feet of our enemies. But loud are the hoofs of the horses. It comes to my mind that I heard them, even as I lay on the ground in sleep, and they troubled my dreams: horses galloping, passing in the <name type="LOC">West</name>. But now they are drawing ever further from us, <name type="GPE">ri</name>ding northward. I wonder what is happening in this land!'</q></p>
<p><q>'Let us go!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>.</p>
<p>So the <name type="ORDINAL">third</name> <name type="DATE">day</name> of their pursuit began. Du<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng <name type="TIME">all its long <name type="TIME">hour</name>s</name> of cloud and fitful sun they hardly paused, now st<name type="GPE">ri</name>ding, now running, as if no wea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ness could quench the fire that burned them. They seldom spoke. Over the wide solitude they passed and their <name type="ORG">elven</name>-cloaks faded against the background of the grey-green fields; even in the cool sunlight of mid-<name type="DATE">day</name> few but elvish eyes would have <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ked them, until they were close at hand. Of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> in their hearts they thanked the <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> of L�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en for the gift of _lembas_, for they could eat of it and find new strength even as they ran.</p>
<p><name type="DATE">All <name type="DATE">day</name></name> the track of their enemies led straight on, going north-west without a break or turn. As once again the <name type="DATE">day</name> wore to its end they came to long treeless slopes, where the land rose, swelling <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name>wards a line of low humpbacked downs ahead. The orc-trail grew fainter as it bent north towards them, for the ground became harder and the grass shorter. <name type="LOC">Far</name> away to the left the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver <name type="ORG">Ent</name>wash wound, a silver thread in a green floor. No moving thing could be seen. Of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> wondered that they saw no sign of beast or man. The dwellings of the Rohir<name type="GPE">ri</name>m were for the most part many leagues away to the <name type="LOC">South</name>, under the wooded eaves of the White <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s, now hidden in mist and cloud; yet the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>rse-lords had formerly kept many herds and studs in the <name type="LOC">East</name>emnet, this easterly region of their realm, and there the herdsmen had <name type="PERSON">wan</name>dered much, living in camp and <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>t, even in <name type="DATE">winter</name>-time. But now all the land was empty, and there was silence that did not seem to be the quiet of peace.</p>
<p>At <name type="TIME">dusk</name> they halted again. Now twice <name type="CARDINAL">twelve</name> leagues they had passed over the plains of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> and the wall of the <name type="ORG">Emyn Muil</name> was lost in the shadows of the <name type="LOC">East</name>. The young moon was glimme<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng in a misty sky, but it gave small light, and the stars were veiled.</p>
<p><q>'Now do I most grudge a time of rest or any halt in our chase ' said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. 'The <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s have run before us, as if the very whips of <name type="ORG">Sauron</name> were behind them. I fear they have already reached the forest and <name type="LOC">the dark hills</name>, and even now are passing into the shadows of the trees.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> ground his teeth. <q>'This is a bitter end to our hope and to all our toil!'</q> he said.</p>
<p><q>'To hope, maybe, but not to toil,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'We shall not turn back here. Yet I am weary.'</q> He gazed back along the way that they had come towards the <name type="TIME">night</name> gathe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng in the <name type="LOC">East</name>. <q>'There is something strange at work in this land. I distrust the silence. I distrust even the pale <name type="PERSON">Moon</name>. The stars are faint; and I am weary as I have seldom been before, weary as no <name type="PRODUCT">Ranger</name> should be with a clear trail to follow. There is some will that lends speed to our foes and sets an unseen bar<name type="GPE">ri</name>er before us: a wea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ness that is in the heart more than in the limb.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Truly!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. <q>'That I have known since <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> we came down from the <name type="ORG">Emyn Muil</name>. For the will is not behind us but before us.'</q> He pointed away over the land of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> into the darkling <name type="LOC">West</name> under the sickle moon. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>!'</q> muttered <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'But he shall not turn us back! <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>t we must once more; for, see! even the <name type="PERSON">Moon</name> is falling into gathe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng cloud. But north lies our road between down and <name type="PERSON">fen</name> when <name type="DATE">day</name> returns.'</q></p>
<p>As before <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> was <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> afoot, if indeed he had ever slept. <q>'Awake! Awake!'</q> he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed. <q>'It is a red <name type="TIME">dawn</name>. Strange things await us by the eaves of the forest. Good or evil, I do not know; but we are called. Awake!'</q></p>
<p>The others sprang up, and almost at once they set off again. Slowly the downs drew near. It was still <name type="TIME">an <name type="TIME">hour</name></name> before <name type="TIME">noon</name> when they reached them: green slopes <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing to bare <name type="GPE">ri</name>dges that ran in a line straight towards the <name type="LOC">North</name>. At their feet the ground was dry and the turf short, but a long st<name type="GPE">ri</name>p of sunken land, <name type="QUANTITY">some <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> miles</name> wide, lay between them and the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver <name type="PERSON">wan</name>de<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng deep in dim thickets of reed and rush. Just to the <name type="LOC">West</name> of the southernmost slope there was a great <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng, where the turf had been torn and bea<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> by many trampling feet. From it the orc-trail ran out again, turning north along the dry skirts of the hills. <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> halted and examined the tracks closely.</p>
<p><q>'They rested here a while,'</q> he said, <q>'but even the outward trail is already old. I fear that your heart spoke truly, <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>: it is th<name type="GPE">ri</name>ce <name type="CARDINAL">twelve</name> <name type="TIME">hour</name>s, I guess, since the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s stood where we now stand. If they held to their pace, then at sundown yester<name type="DATE">day</name> they would reach the borders of <name type="PERSON">Fangorn</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I can see nothing away north or west but grass dwindling into mist,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. <q>'Could we see the forest, if we climbed the hills?'</q></p>
<p><q>'It is still far away,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'If I remember <name type="GPE">ri</name>ghtly, these downs run <name type="CARDINAL">eight</name> leagues or more to the north, and then north-west to the issuing of the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>wash there lies still a wide land. another <name type="CARDINAL">fifteen</name> leagues it may be.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Well, let us go on,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. <q>'My legs must forget the miles. They would be more willing, if my heart were less heavy.'</q></p>
<p>The sun was sinking when at last they drew near to the end of the line of downs. For many <name type="TIME">hour</name>s they had <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ched without rest. They were going slowly now, and <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>'s back was bent. <name type="ORG">St<name type="CARDINAL">one</name></name>-hard are the <name type="ORG">Dwarves</name> in labour or journey, but this endless chase began to tell on him, as all hope failed in his heart. <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> walked behind him, g<name type="GPE">ri</name>m and silent, stooping now and again to scan some p<name type="GPE">ri</name>nt or <name type="PERSON">mar</name>k upon the ground. Only <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> still stepped as lightly as ever, his feet hardly seeming to press the grass. leaving no footp<name type="GPE">ri</name>nts as he passed; but in the <name type="PERSON">waybread</name> of the <name type="ORG">Elves</name> he found all the sus<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ance that he needed, and he could sleep, if sleep it could be called by <name type="ORG">Men</name>, resting his mind in the strange paths of elvish dreams, even as he walked open-eyed in the light of this world.</p>
<p><q>'Let us go up on to <name type="ORG">this green hill</name>!'</q> he said. Wea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ly they followed him, climbing the long slope, until they came out upon the top. It was a round <name type="ORG">hill s</name>mooth and bare, standing by itself, the most northerly of the downs. The sun sank and the shadows of <name type="TIME">evening</name> fell like a curtain. They were al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> in a grey formless world without <name type="PERSON">mar</name>k or measure. Only far away north-west there was a deeper darkness against the dying light: the <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s of Mist and the forest at their feet.</p>
<p><q>'Nothing can we see to guide us here,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. <q>'Well, now we must halt again and wear the <name type="TIME">night</name> away. It is growing cold!'</q></p>
<p><q>'The wind is north from the snows,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>.</p>
<p><q>'And ere <name type="TIME">morning</name> it will be in the <name type="LOC">East</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. <q>'But rest if you must. Yet do not cast all hope away. <name type="PERSON">Tom</name>orrow is unknown. Rede oft is found at the <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing of the <name type="ORG">Sun</name>.'</q></p>
<p>'<name type="PERSON">Thr</name>ee suns already have <name type="GPE">ri</name>sen on our chase and brought no counsel ' said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>.</p>
<p><name type="TIME">The <name type="TIME">night</name></name> grew ever colder. <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> and <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> slept fitfully, and whenever they awoke they saw <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> standing beside them, or walking to and fro, singing softly to himself in his own tongue, and as he sang the white stars opened in the hard black vault above. So the <name type="TIME">night</name> passed. Together they watched the <name type="TIME">dawn</name> grow slowly in the sky, now bare and cloudless, until at last the sun<name type="GPE">ri</name>se came. It was pale and clear. The wind was in the <name type="LOC">East</name> and all the mists had rolled away; wide lands lay bleak about them in the bitter light.</p>
<p>Ahead and eastward they saw the windy uplands of the <name type="ORG">Wold</name> of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> that they had already glimpsed m<name type="DATE">any <name type="DATE">day</name></name>s ago from the <name type="LOC">Great <name type="LOC">River</name></name>. <name type="LOC">North</name>-westward stalked the dark forest of <name type="PERSON">Fangorn</name>; still <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> leagues away stood its shadowy eaves, and its further slopes faded into the distant blue. Beyond there glimmered far away, as if floating on a grey cloud, the white head of tall <name type="PERSON">Methedras</name>, the last peak of the <name type="LOC">Misty <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s</name>. Out of the forest the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>wash flowed to meet them, its stream now swift and narrow, and its banks deep-cloven. The orc-trail turned from the downs towards it.</p>
<p>Following with his keen eyes the trail to the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver, and then the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver back towards the forest, <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> saw a shadow on the distant green, a dark swift-moving blur. He cast himself upon the ground and lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed again in<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>tly. But <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> stood beside him, shading his b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght <name type="ORG">elven</name>-eyes with his long slender hand, and he saw not a shadow, nor a blur, but the small figures of horsemen, many horsemen, and the glint of <name type="TIME">morning</name> on the tips of their spears was like the twinkle of minute stars beyond the edge of mortal sight. <name type="LOC">Far</name> behind them a dark smoke rose in thin curling threads.</p>
<p>There was a silence in the empty fields, a<name type="GPE">ri</name>d <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> could hear the air moving in the grass.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>, sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>nging to his feet. <q>'Many <name type="GPE">ri</name>ders on swift <name type="PERSON">steed</name>s are coming towards us!'</q></p>
<p><q>'Yes,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>, <q>'there are <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name> and <name type="CARDINAL">five</name>. <name type="ORG">Yellow</name> is their <name type="PERSON">hai</name>r, and b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght are their spears. Their leader is very tall.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> smiled. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Keen</name> are the eyes of the <name type="ORG">Elves</name>,'</q> he said.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Nay</name>! The <name type="GPE">ri</name>ders are little more than <name type="CARDINAL">five</name> leagues distant,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="CARDINAL">Five</name> leagues or <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>; <q>'we cannot escape them in this bare land. Shall we wait for them here or go on our way?'</q></p>
<p><q>'We will wait,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'I am weary, and our hunt has failed. Or at least others were before us; for these horsemen are <name type="GPE">ri</name>ding back down the orc-trail. We may get new s from them.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Or spears,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>.</p>
<p><q>'There are <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> empty saddles, but I see no hobbits,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>.</p>
<p><q>'I did not say that we should hear good news,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'But evil or good we will await it here.'</q></p>
<p>The <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> companions now left the hill-top, where they might be an easy <name type="PERSON">mar</name>k against the pale sky, and they walked slowly down the northward slope. A little above the hill's foot they halted, and wrapping their cloaks about them, they sat huddled together upon the faded grass. The time passed slowly and heavily. The wind was thin and sear<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g. <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> was uneasy.</p>
<p><q>'What do you know of these horsemen, <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>?'</q> he said. <q>'Do we sit here waiting for sudden death?'</q></p>
<p><q>'I have been among them,'</q> answered <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'They are proud and wilful, but they are true<name type="PERSON">-he</name>arted, generous in thought and deed; bold but not cruel; wise but unlearned, w<name type="GPE">ri</name>ting no books but singing many songs, after the manner of the children of <name type="ORG">Men</name> before the <name type="EVENT">Dark Years</name>. But I do not know what has happened here of late, nor in what mind the Rohir<name type="GPE">ri</name>m may now be between the traitor <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> and the threat of <name type="ORG">Sauron</name>. They have long been the f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends of the people of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>, though they are not akin to them. It was in forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> <name type="DATE">year</name>s <name type="DATE">long ago</name> that <name type="PERSON">Eorl</name> the Young brought them out of the <name type="LOC">North</name>, and their kinship is rather with the <name type="PERSON">Bard</name>ings of <name type="ORG">Dale</name>, and with the <name type="ORG">Beorn</name>ings of the <name type="PERSON">Wood</name>, among whom may still be seen many men tall and fair, as are the <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>. At least they will not love the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s.'</q></p>
<p>'But <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> spoke of a rumour that they pay t<name type="GPE">ri</name>bute to <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> ' said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>.</p>
<p><q>'I believe it no more than did <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>,'</q> answered <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>.</p>
<p><q>'You will soon learn the truth,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. <q>'Already they approach.'</q></p>
<p>At length even <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> could hear the distant beat of galloping hoofs. The horsemen, following the trail, had turned from the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver, and were drawing near the downs. They were <name type="GPE">ri</name>ding like the wind.</p>
<p>Now the c<name type="GPE">ri</name>es of clear strong voices came <name type="GPE">ri</name>nging over the fields. Suddenly they swept up with a noise like thunder, and the foremost horseman swerved, passing by the foot of the hill, and leading the host back southward along the western skirts of the downs. After him they rode: a long line of mail-clad men. swift, shining, fell and fair to look upon.</p>
<p>Their horses were of great stature, strong and clean-limbed; their grey coats glis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed, their long tails flowed in the wind, their manes were braided on their proud necks. The <name type="ORG">Men</name> that rode them matched them well: tall and long-limbed; their <name type="PERSON">hai</name>r, flaxen-pale, flowed under their light helms, and streamed in long braids behind them; their faces were stern and keen. In their hands were tall spears of ash, painted shields were slung at their backs, long swords were at their belts, their burnished skirts of mail hung down upon their knees.</p>
<p>In pairs they galloped by, and though every now and then <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> rose in his stirrups and gazed ahead and to either side, they appeared not to perceive the <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> strangers sitting silently and wat<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g them. The host had almost passed when suddenly <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> stood up, and called in a loud voice:</p>
<p><q>'What news from the <name type="LOC">North</name>, <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>?'</q></p>
<p>With astonishing speed and skill they checked their <name type="PERSON">steed</name>s, wheeled, and came charging round. Soon the <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> companions found themselves in a <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng of horsemen moving in a running circle, up the hill-slope behind them and down, round and round them, and drawing ever inwards. <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> stood silent, and the other <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> sat without moving, wonde<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng what way things would turn.</p>
<p>Without a word or cry, suddenly, the <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s halted. A thicket of spears were pointed towards the strangers; and some of the horsemen had bows in hand, and their arrows were already fitted to the st<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng. Then <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> rode forward, a tall man, taller than all the rest; from his helm as a crest a white horsetail flowed. He advanced until the point of his spear was within a foot of <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>'s breast. <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> did not stir.</p>
<p><q>'Who are you, and what are you doing in this land?'</q> said the <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>, using the Common <name type="ORG">Speech</name> of the <name type="LOC">West</name>, in manner and t<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> like to the speech of <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>, Man of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>.</p>
<p><q>'I am called <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>,'</q> answered <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'I came out of the <name type="LOC">North</name>. I am hunting <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s.'</q></p>
<p>The <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name> leaped from his horse. Giving his spear to another who rode up and dismounted at his side, he drew his sword and stood face to face with <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>, surveying him keenly, and not without wonder. At length he spoke again.</p>
<p><q>'At <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> I thought that you yourselves were <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s,'</q> he said; <q>'but now I see that it is not so. Indeed you know little of <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s, if you go hunting them in this fashion. They were swift and well-armed, and they were many. You would have changed from hunters to prey, if ever you had overtaken them. But there is something strange about you, <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>.'</q> He bent his clear b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght eyes again upon the <name type="PRODUCT">Ranger</name>. <q>'That is no name for a Man that you give. And strange too is your raiment. Have you sprung out of the grass? <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w did you escape our sight? Are you elvish folk?'</q></p>
<p><q>'No,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'<name type="CARDINAL">One</name> only of us is an <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name>, <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> from the <name type="PERSON">Wood</name>land Realm in distant <name type="GPE">Mirkwood</name>. But we have passed through <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>thl�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en, and the gifts and favour of the <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> go with us.'</q></p>
<p>The <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name> looked at them with renewed wonder, but his eyes hardened. <q>'Then there is a <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> in the Golden <name type="PERSON">Wood</name>, as old tales tell!'</q> he said. <q>'Few escape her nets, they say. These are strange <name type="DATE">day</name>s! But if you have her favour, then you also are net-weavers and sorcerers, maybe.'</q> He turned a cold glance suddenly upon <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> and <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. <q>'Why do you not speak, silent <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s?'</q> he demanded.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> rose and planted his feet firmly apart: his hand g<name type="GPE">ri</name>pped the handle of his axe, and his dark eyes flashed. <q>'Give me your name, horse-master, and I will give you mine, and more besides,'</q> he said.</p>
<p><q>'As for that,'</q> said the <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>, sta<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng down at the <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Dwarf</name>, <q>'the stranger should declare himself <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>. Yet I am named �omer son of �omund, and am called the <name type="ORDINAL">Third</name> Marshal of <name type="ORG">Ridder<name type="PERSON">mar</name>k</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Then �omer son of �omund, <name type="ORDINAL">Third</name> Marshal of <name type="ORG">Ridder<name type="PERSON">mar</name>k</name>, let <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> the <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Dwarf</name> <name type="PRODUCT">Gl�</name>in's son warn you against foolish words. You speak evil of that which is fair beyond the reach of your thought, and only little wit can excuse you.'</q></p>
<p>�omer's eyes blazed, and the <name type="ORG">Men</name> of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> murmured ang<name type="GPE">ri</name>ly, and closed in, advancing their spears. 'I would cut off your head, beard and all, Master <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Dwarf</name>, if it stood but a little higher from the ground ' said �omer.</p>
<p><q>'He stands not al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>, bending his bow and fitting an arrow with hands that moved quicker than sight. <q>'You would die before your stroke fell.'</q></p>
<p>�omer raised his sword, and things might have g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> ill, but <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> sprang between them, and raised his hand. <q>'Your par<name type="PERSON">don</name>, �omer!'</q> he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed. <q>'When you know more you will understand why you have angered my companions. We in<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>d no evil to <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>, nor to any of its folk, neither to man nor to horse. Will you not hear our tale before you st<name type="GPE">ri</name>ke?'</q></p>
<p><q>'I will,'</q> said �omer lowe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng his blade. <q>'But <name type="PERSON">wan</name>derers in the <name type="ORG">Ridder<name type="PERSON">mar</name>k</name> would be wise to be less haughty in these <name type="DATE">day</name>s of doubt. <name type="ORDINAL">First</name> tell me your <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght name.'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="ORDINAL">First</name> tell me whom you serve,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'Are you f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end or foe of <name type="ORG">Sauron</name>, the Dark <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>?'</q></p>
<p><q>'I serve only the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd of the <name type="PERSON">Mark</name>, Th�oden <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g son of <name type="PERSON">Thengel</name>,'</q> answered �omer. <q>'We do not serve the <name type="ORG">Power</name> of the <name type="ORG">Black</name> Land far away, but neither are we yet at open war with him; and if you are fleeing from him, then you had best leave this land. There is trouble now on all our borders, and we are threa<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed; but we desire only to be free, and to live as we have lived, keeping our own, and serving no foreign lord, good or evil. We welcomed guests kindly in the better <name type="DATE">day</name>s, but in these times the unbidden stranger finds us swift and hard. Come! Who are you? Whom do _you_ serve? At whose command do you hunt <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s in our land?'</q></p>
<p><q>'I serve no man,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>; <q>'but the servants of <name type="ORG">Sauron</name> I pursue into whatever land they may go. There are few among mortal <name type="ORG">Men</name> who know more of <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s; and I do not hunt them in this fashion out of choice. The <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s whom we pursued took captive <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> of my f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends. In such need a man that has no horse will go on foot, and he will not ask for leave to follow the trail. Nor will he count the heads of the enemy save with a sword. I am not weaponless.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> threw back his cloak. The <name type="ORG">elven</name>-sheath glittered as he grasped it, and the b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght blade of And�<name type="GPE">ri</name>l sh<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> like a sudden flame as he swept it out. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Elen</name>dil!'</q> he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed. <q>'I am <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> son of <name type="ORG">Arathorn</name> and am called <name type="ORG">Elessar</name>, the <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name>st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, D�nadan, the heir of <name type="ORG">Isildur</name> <name type="PERSON">Elen</name>dil's son of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>. Here is the <name type="PRODUCT">Sword</name> that was Broken and is forged again! Will you aid me or thwart me? Choose swiftly!'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> and <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> looked at their companion in amazement, for they had not seen him in this mood before. He seemed to have grown in stature while �omer had shrunk; and in his living face they caught a b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ef vision of the power and majesty of the kings of st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. For a moment it seemed to the eyes of <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> that a white flame flickered on the brows of <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> like a shining crown.</p>
<p>�omer stepped back and a look of awe was in his face. He cast down his proud eyes. <q>'These are indeed strange <name type="DATE">day</name>s,'</q> he muttered. 'Dreams and legends sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng to life out of the grass.</p>
<p><q>'Tell me, lord,'</q> he said, <q>'what b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ngs you here? And what was the meaning of the dark words? <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ng has <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> son of <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name> been g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> seeking an answer, and the horse that we lent him came back <name type="GPE">ri</name>derless. What doom do you b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng out of the <name type="LOC">North</name>?'</q></p>
<p><q>'The doom of choice,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'You may say this to Th�oden son of <name type="PERSON">Thengel</name>: open war lies before him, with <name type="ORG">Sauron</name> or against him. N<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> may live now as they have lived, and few shall keep what they call their own. But of these great matters we will speak later. If chance allows, I will come myself to the king. Now I am in great need, and I ask for help, or at least for tidings. You heard that we are pursuing an orc-host that car<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed off our f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends. What can you tell us?'</q></p>
<p><q>'That you need not pursue them further,'</q> said �omer. <q>'The <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s are destroyed.'</q></p>
<p><q>'And our f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends?'</q></p>
<p><q>'We found n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> but <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s.'</q></p>
<p><q>'But that is strange indeed,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'Did you search the slain? Were there no bodies other than those of orc-kind? They would be small. Only children to your eyes, unshod but clad in grey.'</q></p>
<p><q>'There were no dwarves nor children,'</q> said �omer. <q>'We counted all the slain and despoiled them, and then we piled the carcases and burned them, as is our cus<name type="PERSON">tom</name>. The ashes are smoking still.'</q></p>
<p><q>'We do not speak of dwarves or children,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. <q>'Our f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends were hobbits.'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbits?'</q> said �omer. <q>'And what may they be? It is a strange name.'</q></p>
<p><q>'A strange name for a strange folk,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. <q>'But these were very dear to us. It seems that you have heard in <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> of the words that troubled Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name>. They spoke of the <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>fling. These hobbits are <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>flings.'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Hal</name>flings!'</q> laughed the <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name> that stood beside �omer. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Hal</name>flings! But they are only a little people in old songs and children's tales out of the <name type="LOC">North</name>. Do we walk in legends or on the green <name type="LOC">earth</name> in the <name type="DATE">day</name>light?'</q></p>
<p><q>'A man may do both,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'For not we but those who come after will make the legends of our time. The green <name type="LOC">earth</name>, say you? That is a mighty matter of legend, though you tread it under the light of <name type="DATE">day</name>!'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Tim</name>e is pressing,'</q> said the <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>, not heeding <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'We must has<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> south, lord. Let us leave these wild folk to their fancies. Or let us bind them and take them to the king.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Peace, �ot<name type="PERSON">hai</name>n!'</q> said �omer in his own tongue. <q>'Leave me a while. Tell the _�ored_ to assemble on the path' and make ready to <name type="GPE">ri</name>de to the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>wade.'</q></p>
<p>Mutte<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng �ot<name type="PERSON">hai</name>n retired, and spoke to the others. Soon they drew off and left �omer al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> with the <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> companions.</p>
<p><q>'All that you say is strange, <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>.'</q> he said. <q>'Yet you speak the truth, that is plain: the <name type="ORG">Men</name> of the <name type="PERSON">Mark</name> do not lie, and therefore they are not easily deceived. But you have not told all. Will you not now speak more fully of your errand, so that I may judge what to do?'</q></p>
<p><q>'I set out from <name type="GPE">Imlad<name type="GPE">ri</name>s</name>, as it is named in the rhyme, <name type="DATE">many <name type="DATE">week</name>s ago</name>,'</q> answered <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'With me went <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> of Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name>. My errand was to go to that city with the son of <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name>, to aid his folk in their war against <name type="ORG">Sauron</name>. But the <name type="ORG">Company</name> that I journeyed with had other business. Of that I cannot speak now. <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> the <name type="ORG">Grey</name> was our leader.'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>!'</q> �omer exclaimed. '<name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> <name type="ORG">Grey</name>hame is known in the <name type="PERSON">Mark</name>: but his name, I warn you, is no longer a password to the king's favour. He has been a guest in the land many times in the memory of men, coming as he will, after a season, or after <name type="DATE">many <name type="DATE">year</name>s</name>. He is ever the herald of strange events: a b<name type="GPE">ri</name>nger of evil, some now say.</p>
<p><q>'Indeed since his last coming in the <name type="DATE">summer</name> all things have g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> amiss. At that time our trouble with <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> began. Until then we counted <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> our f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end, hut <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> came then and warned us that sudden war was prepa<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng in <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard. He said that he himself had been a p<name type="GPE">ri</name>s<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>r in <name type="PERSON">Orthanc</name> and had hardly escaped, and he begged for help. But Th�oden would not lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> to him, and he went away. Speak not the name of <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> loudly in Th�oden's ears! He is wroth. For <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> took the horse that is called <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>fax, the most precious of all the king's <name type="PERSON">steed</name>s, chief of the _<name type="ORG">Mearas</name>_, which only the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd of the <name type="PERSON">Mark</name> may <name type="GPE">ri</name>de. For the sire of their race was the great horse of <name type="PERSON">Eorl</name> that knew the speech of <name type="ORG">Men</name>. <name type="CARDINAL">Seven</name> <name type="TIME">night</name>s ago <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>fax returned; but the king's anger is not less, for now the horse is wild and will let no man handle him.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Then <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>fax has found his way al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> from the far <name type="LOC">North</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>; <q>'for it was there that he and <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> parted. But alas! <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> will <name type="GPE">ri</name>de no longer. He fell into darkness in the <name type="ORG">Mines</name> of <name type="GPE">Mo<name type="GPE">ri</name>a</name> and comes not again.'</q></p>
<p><q>'That is heavy tidings,'</q> said �omer. <q>'At least to me, and to many; though not to all, as you may find, if you come to the king.'</q></p>
<p><q>'It is tidings more g<name type="GPE">ri</name>evous than any in this land can understand, though it may touch them sorely ere <name type="DATE">the <name type="DATE">year</name></name> is much older,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'But when the great fall, the less must lead. My part it has been to guide our <name type="ORG">Company</name> on the long road from <name type="GPE">Mo<name type="GPE">ri</name>a</name>. <name type="PERSON">Thr</name>ough L�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en we came � of which it were well that you should learn the truth ere you speak of it again � and thence down the leagues of the <name type="LOC">Great <name type="LOC">River</name></name> to <name type="DATE">the fall</name>s of <name type="PERSON">Rauros</name>. There <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> was slain by the same <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s whom you destroyed.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Your news is all of woe!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed �omer in dismay. <q>'Great harm is this death to Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name>, and to us all. That was a worthy man! All spoke his praise. He came seldom to the <name type="PERSON">Mark</name>, for he was ever in the wars on the <name type="LOC">East</name>-borders; but I have seen him. More like to the swift sons of <name type="PERSON">Eorl</name> than to the grave <name type="ORG">Men</name> of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> he seemed to me, and likely to prove a great captain of his people when his time came. But we have had no word of this g<name type="GPE">ri</name>ef out of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>. When did he fall?'</q></p>
<p><q>'It is now the <name type="CARDINAL">four</name>th <name type="DATE">day</name> since he was slain,'</q> answered <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>, <q>'and since the <name type="TIME">evening</name> of that <name type="DATE">day</name> we have journeyed from the shadow of Tol <name type="ORG">Brand</name>ir.'</q></p>
<p><q>'On foot?'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed �omer.</p>
<p><q>'Yes, even as you see us.'</q></p>
<p>Wide wonder came into �omer's eyes. <q>'<name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> is too poor a name, son of <name type="ORG">Arathorn</name>,'</q> he said. '<name type="PERSON">Wingfoot</name> I name you. This deed of the <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends should be sung in many a hall. <name type="CARDINAL">Forty</name> leagues and <name type="CARDINAL">five</name> you have measured ere the <name type="CARDINAL">four</name>th <name type="DATE">day</name> is ended! <name type="PERSON">Hardy</name> is the race of <name type="PERSON">Elen</name>dil!</p>
<p><q>'But now, lord, what would you have me do! I must return in haste to Th�oden. I spoke wa<name type="GPE">ri</name>ly before my men. It is true that we are not yet at open war with the <name type="ORG">Black</name> Land, and there are some, close to the king's ear, that speak c<name type="PERSON">raven</name> counsels; but war is coming. We shall not forsake our old alliance with <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>, and while they fight we shall aid them: so say I and all who hold with me. The <name type="LOC">East</name>-<name type="PERSON">mar</name>k is my charge. the ward of the <name type="ORDINAL">Third</name> Marshal, and I have removed all our herds and <name type="ORG">herdfolk</name>, withdrawing them beyond <name type="ORG">Ent</name>wash, and leaving n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> here but guards and swift scouts.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Then you do not pay t<name type="GPE">ri</name>bute to <name type="ORG">Sauron</name>?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>.</p>
<p><q>'We do not and we never have.'</q> said �omer with a flash of his eyes; 'though it comes to my ears that that lie has been told. <name type="DATE">Some <name type="DATE">year</name>s ago</name> the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd of the <name type="ORG">Black</name> Land wished to purchase horses of us at great p<name type="GPE">ri</name>ce, but we refused him. for he puts beasts to evil use. Then he sent plunde<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s, and they carry off what they can, choosing always the black horses: few of these are now left. For that reason our feud with the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s is bitter.</p>
<p>'But at this time our chief concern is with <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>. He has claimed lordship over all this land, and there has been war between us for <name type="DATE">many <name type="DATE">months</name></name>. He has taken <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s into his service, and <name type="PERSON">Wolf</name>-<name type="GPE">ri</name>ders, and evil <name type="ORG">Men</name>, and he has closed the <name type="ORG">Gap</name> against us, so that we are likely to be beset both east and west.</p>
<p><q>'It is ill dealing with such a foe: he is a wizard both cunning and dwimmer-crafty, having many guises. He walks here and there, they say, as an old man hooded and cloaked, very like to <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, as many now recall. His spies slip through every net, and his birds of ill omen are abroad in the sky. I do not know how it will all end, and my heart misgives me; for it seems to me that his f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends do not all dwell in <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard. But if you come to the king's house, you shall see for yourself. Will you not come? Do I hope in vain that you have been sent to me for a help in doubt and need?'</q></p>
<p><q>'I will come when I may,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>.</p>
<p><q>'Come now!'</q> said �omer. 'The Heir of <name type="PERSON">Elen</name>dil would be a strength indeed to the Sons of <name type="PERSON">Eorl</name> in this evil tide. There is battle even now upon the <name type="LOC">West</name>emnet, and I fear that it may go ill for us.</p>
<p>'Indeed in this <name type="GPE">ri</name>ding north I went without the king's leave, for in my absence his house is left with little guard. But scouts warned me of the orc-host coming down out of the <name type="LOC">East</name> Wall <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> <name type="TIME">night</name>s ago, and among them they reported that some bore the white badges of <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>. So suspecting what I most fear, a league between <name type="PERSON">Orthanc</name> and the Dark <name type="FAC">Tower</name>, I led forth my _�ored_, men of my own household; and we overtook the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s at <name type="TIME">night</name>fall <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> <name type="DATE">day</name>s ago, near to the borders of the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>wood. There we surrounded them, and gave battle yester<name type="DATE">day</name> at <name type="TIME">dawn</name>. <name type="CARDINAL">Fifteen</name> of my men I lost, and <name type="CARDINAL">twelve</name> horses alas! For the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s were greater in number than we counted on. Others joined them. coming out of the <name type="LOC">East</name> across the <name type="LOC">Great <name type="LOC">River</name></name>: their trail is plain to see a little north of this spot. And others, too, came out of the forest. <name type="FAC">Great <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s</name>, who also bore the <name type="ORG">White Hand</name> of <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard: that kind is stronger and more fell than all others.</p>
<p><q>'N<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>theless we put an end to them. But we have been too long away. We are needed south and west. Will you not come? There are spare horses as you see. There is work for the <name type="PRODUCT">Sword</name> to do. Yes, and we could find a use for <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>'s axe and the bow of <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>, if they will par<name type="PERSON">don</name> my rash words concerning the <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> of the <name type="PERSON">Wood</name>. I spoke only as do all men in my land, and I would gladly learn better.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I thank you for your fair words,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>, <q>'and my heart desires to come with you; but I cannot desert my f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends while hope remains.'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>pe does not remain,'</q> said �omer. <q>'You will not find your f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends on the <name type="LOC">North</name>-borders.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Yet my f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends are not behind. We found a clear token not far from the <name type="LOC">East</name> Wall that <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> at least of them was still alive there. But between the wall and the downs we have found no other trace of them, and no trail has turned aside, this way or that, unless my skill has wholly left me.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Then what do you think has become of them?'</q></p>
<p><q>'I do not know. They may have been slain and burned among the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s; but that you will say cannot be, and I do not fear it. I can only think that they were car<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed off into the forest before the battle, even before you encircled your foes, maybe. Can you swear that n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> escaped your net in such a way?'</q></p>
<p><q>'I would swear that no <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name> escaped after we sighted them,'</q> said �omer. <q>'We reached the forest-eaves before them, and if after that any living thing broke through our <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng, then it was no <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name> and had some elvish power.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Our f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends were attired even as we are,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>; <q>'and you passed us by under the full light of <name type="DATE">day</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I had forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> that,'</q> said �omer. <q>'It is hard to be sure of anything among so many <name type="PERSON">mar</name>vels. The world is all grown strange. <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name> and <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Dwarf</name> in company walk in our <name type="DATE">daily</name> fields; and folk speak with the <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> of the <name type="PERSON">Wood</name> and yet live; and the <name type="PRODUCT">Sword</name> comes back to war that was broken in the long ages ere the fathers of our fathers rode into the <name type="PERSON">Mark</name>! <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w shall a man judge what to do in such times?'</q></p>
<p><q>'As he ever has judged,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'Good and ill have not changed since yester<name type="DATE">year</name>; nor are they <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> thing among <name type="ORG">Elves</name> and <name type="ORG">Dwarves</name> : and another among <name type="ORG">Men</name>. It is a man's part to discern them, as much in the Golden <name type="PERSON">Wood</name> as in his own house.'</q></p>
<p><q>'True indeed,'</q> said �omer. <q>'But I do not doubt you, nor the deed which my heart would do. Yet I am not free to do all as I would. It is against our law to let strangers <name type="PERSON">wan</name>der at will in our land, until the king himself shall give them leave, and more st<name type="GPE">ri</name>ct is the command in these <name type="DATE">day</name>s of pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>l. I have begged you to come back willingly with me, and you will not. <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>th am I to begin a battle of <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name> against <name type="CARDINAL">three</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I do not think your law was made for such a chance,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'Nor indeed am I a stranger; for I have been in this land before, more than once, and <name type="GPE">ri</name>dden with the host of the Rohir<name type="GPE">ri</name>m, though under other name and in other guise. You I have not seen before, for you are young, but I have spoken with �omund your father, and with Th�oden son of <name type="PERSON">Thengel</name>. Never in former <name type="DATE">day</name>s would any high lord of this land have constrained a man to aban<name type="PERSON">don</name> such a quest as mine. My duty at least is clear, to go on. Come now, son of �omund, the choice must be made at last. Aid us, or at the worst let us go free. Or seek to carry out your law. If you do so there will be fewer to return to your war or to your king.'</q></p>
<p>�omer was silent for a moment, then he spoke. <q>'We both have need of haste,'</q> he said. <q>'My company chafes to be away, and <name type="TIME">every <name type="TIME">hour</name></name> lessens your hope. This is my choice. You may go; and what is more, I will lend you horses. This only I ask: when your quest is achieved, or is proved vain, return with the horses over the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>wade to <name type="GPE">Meduseld</name>, the high house in <name type="ORG">Edoras</name> where Th�oden now sits. Thus you shall prove to him that I have not misjudged. In this I place myself, and maybe my very life, in the keeping of your good faith. Do not fail.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I will not,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>.</p>
<p>There was great wonder, and many dark and doubtful glances, among his men, when �omer gave orders that the spare horses were to be lent to the strangers; but only �ot<name type="PERSON">hai</name>n dared to speak openly.</p>
<p><q>'It may be well enough for this lord of the race of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>, as he claims,'</q> he said, <q>'but who has heard of a horse of the <name type="PERSON">Mark</name> being given to a <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Dwarf</name>?'</q></p>
<p><q>'No <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. <q>'And do not trouble: no <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> will ever hear of it. I would so<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>r walk than sit on the back of any beast so great, free or begrudged.'</q></p>
<p><q>'But you must <name type="GPE">ri</name>de now, or you will hinder us,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>.</p>
<p><q>'Come, you shall sit behind me, f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>, said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. Then all will be well, and you need neither borrow a horse nor be troubled by <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>.'</q></p>
<p>A great dark-grey horse was brought to <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>, and he mounted it. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Hasufel</name> is his name,'</q> said �omer. <q>'<name type="DATE">May</name> he bear you well and to better fortune than G�rulf, his late master!'</q></p>
<p>A smaller and lighter horse, but restive and fiery, was brought to <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. <name type="GPE">Arod</name> was his name. But <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> asked them to take off saddle and rein. <q>'I need them not,'</q> he said, and leaped lightly up, and to their wonder <name type="GPE">Arod</name> was tame and willing beneath him, moving here and there with but a spoken word: such was the elvish way with all good beasts. <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> was lifted up behind his f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end. and he clung to him, not much more at ease than <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> <name type="PERSON">Gamgee</name> in a boat.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="LOC">Far</name>ewell, and may you find what you seek!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed �omer. <q>'Return with what speed you may, and let our swords hereafter shine together!'</q></p>
<p><q>'I will come,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>.</p>
<p><q>'And I will come, too,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. 'The matter of the <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> <name type="PERSON">Galad<name type="GPE">ri</name>el</name> lies still between us. I have yet to teach you gentle speech. '</p>
<p><q>'We shall see,'</q> said �omer. <q>'So many strange things have chanced that to learn the praise of a fair lady under the loving strokes of a <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Dwarf</name>'s axe will seem no great wonder. <name type="LOC">Far</name>ewell!'</q></p>
<p>With that they parted. Very swift were the horses of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>. When after a little <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> looked back, the company of �omer were already small and far away. <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> did not look back: he was wat<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g the trail as they sped on their way, bending low with his head beside the neck of <name type="PERSON">Hasufel</name>. Before long they came to the borders of the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>wash, and there they met the other trail of which �omer had spoken, coming down from the <name type="LOC">East</name> out of the <name type="ORG">Wold</name>.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> dismounted and surveyed the ground, then leaping back into the saddle, he rode away for some distance eastward, keeping to <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> side and taking care not to over<name type="GPE">ri</name>de the footp<name type="GPE">ri</name>nts. Then he again dismounted and examined the ground, going backwards and forwards on foot.</p>
<p><q>'There is little to discover,'</q> he said when he returned. <q>'The main trail is all confused with the passage of the horsemen as they came back; their outward course must have lain nearer the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver. But this eastward trail is fresh and clear. There is no sign there of any feet going the other way, back towards <name type="GPE">Anduin</name>. Now we must <name type="GPE">ri</name>de slower, and make sure that no trace or footstep branches off on either side. The <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s must have been aware from this point that they were pursued; they may have made some attempt to get their captives away before they were overtaken.'</q></p>
<p>As they rode forward the <name type="DATE">day</name> was overcast. <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>w grey clouds came over the <name type="ORG">Wold</name>. A mist shrouded the sun. Ever nearer the tree-clad slopes of <name type="PERSON">Fangorn</name> loomed, slowly darkling as the sun went west. They saw no sign of any trail to <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght or left, but here and there they passed single <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s, fallen in their tracks as they ran, with grey-feathered arrows sticking in back or throat.</p>
<p>At last as the <name type="TIME">after<name type="TIME">noon</name></name> was <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ing they came to the eaves of the forest, and in an open glade among the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> trees they found the place of the great burning: the ashes were still hot and smoking. Beside it was a great pile of helms and mail, cloven shields, and broken swords, bows and darts and other gear of war. Upon a stake in the middle was set a great goblin head; upon its shattered helm the white badge could still be seen. Further away, not far from the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver, where it came streaming out from the edge of the wood, there was a mound. It was newly raised: the raw <name type="LOC">earth</name> was covered with fresh-cut turves: about it were planted <name type="CARDINAL">fifteen</name> spears.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> and his companions searched far and wide about the field of battle, but the light faded, and <name type="TIME">evening</name> soon drew down, dim and misty. By <name type="TIME">night</name>fall they had discovered no trace of <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>.</p>
<p><q>'We can do no more,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> sadly. <q>'We have been set many <name type="GPE">ri</name>ddles since we came to Tol <name type="ORG">Brand</name>ir, but this is the hardest to unravel. I would guess that the burned b<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s of the hobbits are now mingled with the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s'. It will be hard news for <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, if he lives to hear it; and hard too for the old hobbit who waits in <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name>. <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name> was against their coming.'</q></p>
<p><q>'But <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> was not,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>.</p>
<p><q>'But <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> chose to come himself, and he was the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> to be lost ' answered <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. 'His foresight failed him.'</q></p>
<p><q>'The counsel of <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> was not founded on foreknowledge of safety, for himself or for others,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'There are some things that it is better to begin than to refuse, even though the end may be dark. But I shall not depart from this place yet. In any case we must here await the <name type="TIME">morning</name>-light.'</q></p>
<p>A little way beyond the battle-field they made their camp under a spreading tree: it looked like a chestnut, and yet it still bore many broad brown leaves of <name type="DATE">a former <name type="DATE">year</name></name>, like dry hands with long splayed fingers; they rattled mournfully in the <name type="TIME">night</name>-breeze.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> shivered. They had brought only <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> blanket apiece. <q>'Let us light a fire,'</q> he said. <q>'I care no longer for the danger. Let the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s come as thick as <name type="DATE">summer</name>-moths round a candle!'</q></p>
<p><q>'If those unhappy hobbits are astray in the woods, it might draw them hither,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>.</p>
<p><q>'And it might draw other things, neither <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name> nor <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbit,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'We are near to the mountain-<name type="PERSON">mar</name>ches of the traitor <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>. Also we are on the very edge of <name type="PERSON">Fangorn</name>, and it is pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>lous to touch the trees of that wood, it is said.'</q></p>
<p><q>'But the Rohir<name type="GPE">ri</name>m made a great burning here yester<name type="DATE">day</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>, <q>'and they felled trees for the fire, as can be seen. Yet they passed the <name type="TIME">night</name> after safely here, when their labour was ended.'</q></p>
<p><q>'They were many,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>, <q>'and they do not heed the wrath of <name type="PERSON">Fangorn</name>, for they come here seldom, and they do not go under the trees. But our paths are likely to lead us into the very forest itself. So have a care! Cut no living wood!'</q></p>
<p><q>'There is no need,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. <q>'The <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s have left chip and bough enough, and there is dead wood lying in plenty.'</q> He went off to gather fuel, and busied himself with building and kindling a fire; but <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> sat silent with his back to the great tree, deep in thought; and <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> stood al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> in the open, looking towards the profound shadow of the wood, leaning forward, as <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> who lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>s to voices calling from a distance.</p>
<p>When the <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Dwarf</name> had a small b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght blaze going, the <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> companions drew close to it and sat together, shrouding the light with their hooded forms. <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> looked up at the boughs of the tree rea<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g out above them.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok!'</q> he said. <q>'The tree is glad of the fire!'</q></p>
<p>It may have been that the dancing shadows t<name type="GPE">ri</name>cked their eyes, but certainly to each of the companions the boughs appeared to be bending this way and that so as to come above the flames, while the upper branches were stooping down; the brown leaves now stood out stiff, and rubbed together like many cold cracked hands taking comfort in the warmth.</p>
<p>There was a silence, for suddenly the dark and unknown forest, so near at hand, made itself felt as a great brooding presence, full of <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret purpose. After a while <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> spoke again.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="EVENT">Celeborn</name> warned us not to go far into <name type="PERSON">Fangorn</name>,'</q> he said. <q>'Do you know why, <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>? What are the fables of the forest that <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> had heard?'</q></p>
<p><q>'I have heard many tales in <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> and elsewhere,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>, <q>'but if it were not for the words of <name type="EVENT">Celeborn</name> I should deem them only fables that <name type="ORG">Men</name> have made as true knowledge fades. I had thought of asking you what was the truth of the matter. And if an <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name> of the <name type="PERSON">Wood</name> does not know, how shall a Man answer?'</q></p>
<p><q>'You have journeyed further than I,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. <q>'I have heard nothing of this in my own land, save only songs that tell how the <name type="PERSON">Onod<name type="GPE">ri</name>m</name>, that <name type="ORG">Men</name> call <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s, dwelt there <name type="DATE">long ago</name>; for <name type="PERSON">Fangorn</name> is old, old even as the <name type="ORG">Elves</name> would reckon it.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Yes, it is old,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>, <q>'as old as the forest by the <name type="ORG">Barrow</name>-downs, and it is far greater. <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name> says that the <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> are akin, the last strongholds of the mighty woods of the <name type="DATE">Elder Days</name>, in which the <name type="ORDINAL">First</name>born roamed while <name type="ORG">Men</name> still slept. Yet <name type="PERSON">Fangorn</name> holds some <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret of its own. What it is I do not know.'</q></p>
<p><q>'And I do not wish to know,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. <q>'Let nothing that dwells in <name type="PERSON">Fangorn</name> be troubled on my account!'</q></p>
<p>They now drew lots for the watches, and the lot for the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> watch fell to <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. The others lay down. Almost at once sleep laid hold on them. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> drowsily. <q>'Remember, it is pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>lous to cut bough or twig from a living tree in <name type="PERSON">Fangorn</name>. But do not stray far in search of dead wood. Let the fire die rather! Call me at need!'</q></p>
<p>With that he fell asleep. <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> already lay motionless, his fair hands folded upon his breast, his eyes unclosed, blending living <name type="TIME">night</name> and deep dream, as is the way with <name type="ORG">Elves</name>. <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> sat hunched by the fire, running his thumb thoughtfully along the edge of his axe. The tree rustled. There was no other sound.</p>
<p>Suddenly <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> looked up, and there just on the edge of the fire-light stood an old bent man, leaning on a staff, and wrapped in a great cloak; his wide-b<name type="GPE">ri</name>mmed hat was pulled down over his eyes. <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> sprang up, too amazed for the moment to cry out, though at once the thought flashed into his mind that <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> had caught them. Both <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> and <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>, roused by his sudden movement, sat up and stared. The old man did not speak or make, sign.</p>
<p><q>'Well, father, what can we do for you?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>, leaping to his feet. <q>'Come and be warm, if you are cold!'</q> He strode forward, but the old man was g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. There was no trace of him to be found near at hand, and they did not dare to <name type="PERSON">wan</name>der far. The moon had set and the <name type="TIME">night</name> was very dark.</p>
<p>Suddenly <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> gave a cry. <q>'The horses! The horses!'</q></p>
<p>The horses were g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. They had dragged their pickets and disappeared. For me time the <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> companions stood still and silent, troubled by this new stroke of ill fortune. They were under the eaves of <name type="PERSON">Fangorn</name>, and endless leagues lay between them and the <name type="ORG">Men</name> of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>, their only f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends in this wide and dangerous land. As they stood, it seemed to them that they heard, far off in the <name type="TIME">night</name>. the sound of horses whinnying and neighing. Then all was quiet again, except for the cold rustle of the wind.</p>
<p><q>'Well, they are g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> at last. <q>'We cannot find them or catch them; so that if they do not return of their own will, we must do without. We started on our feet, and we have those still.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Feet!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. 'But we cannot eat them as well as walk on them ' He threw some fuel on the fire and slumped down beside it.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="TIME">Only <name type="TIME">a few <name type="TIME">hour</name>s</name> ago</name> you were unwilling to sit on a horse of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>,'</q> laughed <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. <q>'You will make a <name type="GPE">ri</name>der yet.'</q></p>
<p><q>'It seems unlikely that I shall have the chance,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>.</p>
<p><q>'If you wish to know what I think,'</q> he began again after a while <q>'I think it was <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>. Who else? Remember the words of �omer: he walks about like an old man hooded and cloaked. Those were the words. He has g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> off with our horses, or scared them away, and here we are. There is more trouble coming to us, <name type="PERSON">mar</name>k my words!'</q></p>
<p><q>'I <name type="PERSON">mar</name>k them,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'But I <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ked also that this old man had a hat not a hood. Still I do not doubt that you guess <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght, and that we are in pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>l here, by <name type="TIME">night</name> or <name type="DATE">day</name>. Yet in the meantime there is nothing that we can do but rest, while we may. I will watch for a while now, <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. I have more need of thought than of sleep.'</q></p>
<p><name type="TIME">The <name type="TIME">night</name></name> passed slowly. <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> followed <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>, and <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> followed <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>, and their watches wore away. But nothing happened. The old man did not appear again, and the horses did not return.</p>
</chapter><chapter num="3"><heading>Chapter 3</heading>
<p>The Uruk-Hai</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> lay in a dark and troubled dream: it seemed that he could hear his own small voice echoing in black tunnels, calling _<name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>!_ But instead of <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name>s of hideous orc-faces g<name type="GPE">ri</name>nned at him out of the shadows, <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name>s of hideous arms grasped at him from every side. Where was <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>?</p>
<p>He woke. Cold air blew on his face. He was lying on his back. Evening was coming and the sky above was growing dim. He turned and found that the dream was little worse than the waking. His w<name type="GPE">ri</name>sts, legs, and ankles were tied with cords. Beside him <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> lay, white-faced, with a dirty rag bound across his brows. All about them sat or stood a great company of <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s.</p>
<p>Slowly in <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>'s a<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g head memory pieced itself together and became separated from dream-shadows. Of course: he and <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> had run off into the woods. What had come over them? Why had they dashed off like that, taking no notice of old <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>? They had run a long way shouting�he could not remember how far or how long; and then suddenly they had crashed <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght into a group of <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s: they were standing lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing, and they did not appear to see <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> until they were almost in their arms. Then they yelled and <name type="CARDINAL">dozen</name>s of other goblins had sprung out of the trees. <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> and he had drawn their swords, but the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s did not wish to fight, and had t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed only to lay hold of them, even when <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> had cut off several of their arms and hands. Good old <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>!</p>
<p>Then <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> had come leaping through the trees. He had made them fight. He slew many of them and the rest fled. But they had not g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> far on the way back when they were attacked again. by <name type="CARDINAL">a <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name></name> <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s at least, some of them very large, and they shot a rain of arrows: always at <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>. <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> had blown his great horn till the woods rang, and at <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s had been dismayed and had drawn back; but when no answer but the echoes came, they had attacked more fierce than ever. <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> did not remember much more. His last memo was of <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> leaning against a tree, plucking out an arrow; then darkness fell suddenly.</p>
<p><q>'I suppose I was knocked on the head,'</q> he said to himself. <q>'I wonder if poor <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> is much hurt. What has happened to <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>? Why didn't the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s kill us? Where are we, and where are we going?'</q></p>
<p>He could not answer the questions. He felt cold and sick. <q>'I wish <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> had never persuaded <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name> to let us come,'</q> he thought. <q>'What good have I been? Just a nuisance: a passenger, a piece of luggage. And now I have been stolen and I am just a piece of luggage for the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s. I hope <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> or some<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> will come and claim us! But ought I to hope for it? Won't that throw out all the plans? I wish I could get free!'</q></p>
<p>He struggled a little, quite uselessly. <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> of the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s sitting near laughed and said something to a companion in their abominable tongue. <q>'Rest while you can, little fool!'</q> he said then to <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>, in the Common <name type="ORG">Speech</name>, which he made almost as hideous as his own language. <q>'Rest while you can! We'll find a use for your legs before long. You'll wish you had got n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> before we get home.'</q></p>
<p><q>'If I had my way, you'd wish you were dead now,'</q> said the other. <q>'I'd make you squeak, you miserable rat.'</q> He stooped over <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> b<name type="GPE">ri</name>nging his yellow fangs close to his face. He had a black knife with a long jagged blade in his hand. <q>'Lie quiet, or I'll tickle you with this,'</q> he hissed. '<name type="PERSON">Don</name>'t draw at<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>tion to yourself, or I may forget my orders. Curse the <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>garders! _<name type="PRODUCT">Ugl</name><name type="PRODUCT">�k</name> u bagronk sha pushdug <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>-glob b�<name type="PERSON">bhosh</name> skai':_ he passed into a long angry speech in his own tongue that slowly died away into mutte<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng and snarling.</p>
<p>Ter<name type="GPE">ri</name>fied <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> lay still, though the pain at his w<name type="GPE">ri</name>sts and ankles was growing, and the st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s beneath him were bo<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng into his back. To take his mind off himself he lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed in<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>tly to all that he could hear. There were many voices round about, and though orc-speech sounded at all times full of hate and anger, it seemed plain that something like a quarrel had begun, and was getting hotter.</p>
<p>To <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>'s surp<name type="GPE">ri</name>se he found that much of the talk was intelligible many of the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s were using ordinary language. Apparently the members of <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> or <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> quite different t<name type="GPE">ri</name>bes were present, and they could not understand <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> another's orc-speech. There was an angry debate concerning what they were to do now: which way they were to take and what should be <name type="PERSON">don</name>e with the p<name type="GPE">ri</name>s<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>rs.</p>
<p><q>'There's no time to kill them properly,'</q> said <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. <q>'No time for play on this t<name type="GPE">ri</name>p.'</q></p>
<p><q>'That can't be helped,'</q> said another. <q>'But why not kill them quick, kill them now? They're a cursed nuisance, and we're in a hurry. Evening's coming on, and we ought to get a move on.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Orders.'</q> said <name type="CARDINAL">a <name type="ORDINAL">third</name></name> voice in a deep growl. _'Kill all but_NOT_ the <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>fings; they are to be brought back_ALIVE_ as quickly as possible_. That's my orders.'</p>
<p><q>'What are they <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ted for?'</q> asked several voices. <q>'Why alive? Do they give good sport?'</q></p>
<p><q>'No! I heard that <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of them has got something, something that's <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ted for the War, some elvish plot or other. Anyway they'll both be questi<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>d.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Is that all you know? Why <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t we search them and find out? We might find something that we could use ourselves.'</q></p>
<p><q>'That is a very interesting re<name type="PERSON">mar</name>k,'</q> sneered a voice, softer than the others but more evil. <q>'I may have to report that. The p<name type="GPE">ri</name>s<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>rs are NOT to be searched or plundered: those are _my_ orders.'</q></p>
<p><q>'And mine too,'</q> said the deep voice. <q>'_Alive and as captured; no spoiling_. That's my orders.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Not our orders!'</q> said <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the earlier voices. <q>'We have come all the way from the <name type="ORG">Mines</name> to kill, and avenge our folk. I wish to kill, and then go back north.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Then you can wish again,'</q> said the growling voice. <q>'I am <name type="PRODUCT">Ugl</name><name type="PRODUCT">�k</name>. I command. I return to <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard by the shortest road.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Is <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> the master or the Great <name type="PRODUCT">Eye</name>?'</q> said the evil voice. <q>'We should go back at once to <name type="GPE">Lugb</name>�rz.'</q></p>
<p><q>'If we could cross the <name type="LOC">Great <name type="LOC">River</name></name>, we might,'</q> said another voice. <q>'But there are not enough of us to venture down to the b<name type="GPE">ri</name>dges.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I came across,'</q> said the evil voice. <q>'A winged Nazg�l awaits us northward on the east-bank.'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="DATE">May</name>be, maybe! Then you'll fly off with our p<name type="GPE">ri</name>s<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>rs, and get all the pay and praise in <name type="GPE">Lugb</name>�rz, and leave us to foot it as best we can through the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>rse-country. No, we must stick together. These lands are dangerous: full of foul rebels and b<name type="GPE">ri</name>gands.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Aye, we must stick together,'</q> growled <name type="PRODUCT">Ugl</name><name type="PRODUCT">�k</name>. <q>'I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t trust you little swine. You've no guts outside your own sties. But for us you'd all have run away. We are the fighting <name type="PERSON">Uruk-<name type="PERSON">hai</name></name>! We slew the great war<name type="GPE">ri</name>or. We took the p<name type="GPE">ri</name>s<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>rs. We are the servants of <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> the <name type="PERSON">Wise</name>, the <name type="ORG">White Hand</name>: the Hand that gives us man's-flesh to eat. We came out of <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard, and led you here, and we shall lead you back by the way we choose. I am <name type="PRODUCT">Ugl</name><name type="PRODUCT">�k</name>. I have spoken.'</q></p>
<p><q>'You have spoken more than enough, <name type="PRODUCT">Ugl</name><name type="PRODUCT">�k</name>,'</q> sneered the evil voice. 'I wonder how they would like it in <name type="GPE">Lugb</name>�rz. They might think that <name type="PRODUCT">Ugl</name><name type="PRODUCT">�k</name>'s shoulders needed relieving of a swollen head. They might ask where his strange ideas came from. Did they come from <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>, perhaps? Who does _he_ think he is, setting up on his own with his filthy white badges? They might agree with me, with <name type="PERSON">G<name type="GPE">ri</name>shn<name type="PRODUCT">�k</name>h</name> their trusted messenger; and I <name type="PERSON">G<name type="GPE">ri</name>shn<name type="PRODUCT">�k</name>h</name> say this: <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> is a fool. and a dirty treacherous fool. But the Great <name type="PRODUCT">Eye</name> is on him.</p>
<p><q>'_Swine_ is it? <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w do you folk like being called _swine_ by the muck-rakers of a dirty little wizard? It's orc-flesh they eat, I'll warrant.'</q></p>
<p>Many loud yells in orc-speech answered him, and the <name type="GPE">ri</name>nging clash of weapons being drawn. Cautiously <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> rolled over, hoping to see what would happen. His guards had g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> to join in the fray. In the <name type="TIME">twilight</name> he saw a large black <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>, probably <name type="PRODUCT">Ugl</name><name type="PRODUCT">�k</name>, standing facing <name type="PERSON">G<name type="GPE">ri</name>shn<name type="PRODUCT">�k</name>h</name>, a short crook-legged creature, very broad and with long arms that hung almost to the ground. Round them were many smaller goblins. <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> supposed that these were the <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s from the <name type="LOC">North</name>. They had drawn their knives and swords, but hesitated to attack <name type="PRODUCT">Ugl</name><name type="PRODUCT">�k</name>.</p>
<p><name type="PRODUCT">Ugl</name><name type="PRODUCT">�k</name> shouted, and a number of other <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s of nearly his own size ran up. Then suddenly, without warning, <name type="PRODUCT">Ugl</name><name type="PRODUCT">�k</name> sprang forwards, and with <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> swift strokes swept the heads off <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> of his opp<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>nts. <name type="PERSON">G<name type="GPE">ri</name>shn<name type="PRODUCT">�k</name>h</name> stepped aside and vanished into the shadows. The others gave way, and <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> stepped backwards and fell over <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>'s prostrate form with a curse. Yet that probably saved his life, for <name type="PRODUCT">Ugl</name><name type="PRODUCT">�k</name>'s followers leaped over him and cut down another with their broad-bladed swords. It was the yellow-fanged guard. His body fell <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght on top of <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>, still clut<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g its long saw-edged knife.</p>
<p><q>'Put up your weapons!'</q> shouted <name type="PRODUCT">Ugl</name><name type="PRODUCT">�k</name>. <q>'And let's have no more nonsense! We go straight west from here, and down the stair. From there straight to the downs, then along the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver to the forest. And we <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ch <name type="DATE">day</name> and <name type="TIME">night</name>. That clear?'</q></p>
<p><q>'Now,'</q> thought <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>, <q>'if only it takes that ugly fellow a little while to get his troop under control, I've got a chance.'</q> A gleam of hope had come to him. The edge of the black knife had s<name type="GPE">nick</name>ed his arm, and then slid down to his w<name type="GPE">ri</name>st. He felt the blood t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ckling on to his hand, but he also felt the cold touch of steel against his skin.</p>
<p>The <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s were getting ready to <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ch again, but some of the <name type="LOC">North</name>erners were still unwilling, and the <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>garders slew <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> more before the rest were cowed. There was much cursing and confusion. For the moment <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> was unwatched. His legs were <name type="ORG">sec</name>urely bound, but his arms were only tied about the w<name type="GPE">ri</name>sts, and his hands were in front of him. He could move them both together, though the bonds were cruelly tight. He pushed the dead <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name> to <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> side, then hardly da<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng to breathe, he drew the knot of the w<name type="GPE">ri</name>st-cord up and down against the blade of the knife. It was sharp and the dead hand held it fast. The cord was cut! Quickly <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> took it in his fingers and knotted it again into a loose bracelet of <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> loops and slipped it over his hands. Then he lay very still.</p>
<p><q>'Pick up those p<name type="GPE">ri</name>s<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>rs!'</q> shouted <name type="PRODUCT">Ugl</name><name type="PRODUCT">�k</name>. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Don</name>'t play any t<name type="GPE">ri</name>cks with them! If they are not alive when we get back, some<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> else will die too.'</q></p>
<p>An <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name> seized <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> like a sack. put its head between his tied hands, grabbed his arms and dragged them down, until <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>'s face was crushed against its neck; then it jolted off with him. Another treated <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> in the same way. The <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>'s clawlike hand g<name type="GPE">ri</name>pped <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>'s arms like iron; the nails bit into him. He shut his eyes and slipped back into evil dreams.</p>
<p>Suddenly he was thrown on to the stony floor again. It was <name type="TIME">early <name type="TIME">night</name></name>, but the slim moon was already falling westward. They were on the edge of a cliff that seemed to look out over a sea of pale mist. There was a sound of water falling nearby.</p>
<p><q>'The scouts have come back at last,'</q> said an <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name> close at hand.</p>
<p><q>'Well, what did you discover?'</q> growled the voice of <name type="PRODUCT">Ugl</name><name type="PRODUCT">�k</name>.</p>
<p><q>'Only a single horseman, and he made off westwards. All's clear now.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Now, I daresay. But how long? You fools! You should have shot him. He'll raise the alarm. The cursed <name type="ORG">horsebreeders</name> will hear of us by <name type="TIME">morning</name>. Now we'll have to leg it double quick.'</q></p>
<p>A shadow bent over <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. It was <name type="PRODUCT">Ugl</name><name type="PRODUCT">�k</name>. <q>'Sit up!'</q> said the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>. <q>'My lads are tired of lugging you about. We have got to climb down and you must use your legs. Be helpful now. No crying out, no trying to escape. We have ways of paying for t<name type="GPE">ri</name>cks that you won't like, though they won't spoil your usefulness for the Master.'</q></p>
<p>He cut the thongs round <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>'s legs and ankles, picked him up by his <name type="PERSON">hai</name>r and stood him on his feet. <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> fell down, and <name type="PRODUCT">Ugl</name><name type="PRODUCT">�k</name> dragged him up by his <name type="PERSON">hai</name>r again. Several <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s laughed. <name type="PRODUCT">Ugl</name><name type="PRODUCT">�k</name> thrust a flask between his teeth and poured some burning liquid down his throat: he felt a hot fierce glow flow through him. The pain in his legs and ankles vanished. He could stand.</p>
<p><q>'Now for the other!'</q> said <name type="PRODUCT">Ugl</name><name type="PRODUCT">�k</name>. <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> saw him go to <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>, who was lying close by, and kick him. <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> groaned. Seizing him roughly <name type="PRODUCT">Ugl</name><name type="PRODUCT">�k</name> pulled him into a sitting position, and tore the bandage off his head. Then he smeared the wound with some dark stuff out of a small wooden box. <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed out and struggled wildly.</p>
<p>The <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s clapped and hooted. <q>'Can't take his medicine,'</q> they jeered. <q>'Doesn't know what's good for him. Ai! We shall have some fun later.'</q></p>
<p>But at the moment <name type="PRODUCT">Ugl</name><name type="PRODUCT">�k</name> was not engaged in sport. He needed speed and had to humour unwilling followers. He was healing <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> in orc-fashion; and his treatment worked swiftly. When he had forced a d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk from his flask down the hobbit's throat, cut his leg-bonds, and dragged him to his feet, <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> stood up, looking pale but g<name type="GPE">ri</name>m and defiant, and very much alive. The gash in his forehead gave him no more trouble, but he bore a brown scar to the end of his <name type="DATE">day</name>s.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="ORG">Hullo</name>, <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>!'</q> he said. <q>'So you've come on this little expedition, too? Where do we get bed and breakfast?'</q></p>
<p><q>'Now then!'</q> said <name type="PRODUCT">Ugl</name><name type="PRODUCT">�k</name>. <q>'N<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of that! <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>ld your tongues. No talk to <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> another. Any trouble will be reported at the other end, and He'll know how to pay you. You'll get bed and breakfast all <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght: more than you can s<name type="PERSON">tom</name>ach.'</q></p>
<p>The orc-band began to descend a narrow ravine leading down into the misty plain below. <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>, separated by <name type="CARDINAL">a <name type="CARDINAL">dozen</name></name> <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s or more, climbed down with them. At the bot<name type="PERSON">tom</name> they stepped on to grass, and the hearts of the hobbits rose.</p>
<p><q>'Now straight on!'</q> shouted <name type="PRODUCT">Ugl</name><name type="PRODUCT">�k</name>. <q>'<name type="LOC">West</name> and a little north. Follow <name type="PERSON">Lugdush</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q>'But what are we going to do at sun<name type="GPE">ri</name>se?'</q> said some of the <name type="LOC">North</name>erners.</p>
<p><q>'Go on running,'</q> said <name type="PRODUCT">Ugl</name><name type="PRODUCT">�k</name>. <q>'What do you think? Sit on the grass and wait for the <name type="PERSON">Whiteskins</name> to join the picnic?'</q></p>
<p><q>'But we can't run in the sunlight.'</q></p>
<p><q>'You'll run with me behind you,'</q> said <name type="PRODUCT">Ugl</name><name type="PRODUCT">�k</name>. <q>'Run! Or you'll never see your beloved holes again. By the <name type="ORG">White Hand</name>! What's the use of sending out mountain-maggots on a t<name type="GPE">ri</name>p, only <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> trained. Run, curse you! Run while <name type="TIME">night</name> lasts!'</q></p>
<p>Then the whole company began to run with the long loping st<name type="GPE">ri</name>des of <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s. They kept no order, thrusting, jostling, and cursing; yet their speed was very great. Each hobbit had a guard of <name type="CARDINAL">three</name>. <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> was far back in the line. He wondered how long he would be able to go on at this pace: he had had no food since the <name type="TIME">morning</name>. <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> of his guards had a whip. But at present the orc-liquor was still hot in him. His wits, too, were wide-awake.</p>
<p>Every now and again there came into his mind unbidden a vision of the keen face of <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> bending over a dark trail, and running, running behind. But what could even a <name type="PRODUCT">Ranger</name> see except a confused trail of orc-feet? His own little p<name type="GPE">ri</name>nts and <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>'s were overwhelmed by the trampling of the iron-shod shoes before them and behind them and about them.</p>
<p>They had g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> only <name type="QUANTITY">a mile</name> or so from the cliff when the land sloped down into a wide shallow depression, where the ground was soft and wet. Mist lay there, pale-glimme<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng in the last rays of the sickle moon. The dark shapes of the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s in front grew dim, and then were swallowed up.</p>
<p><q>'Ai! <name type="PERSON">Steady</name> now!'</q> shouted <name type="PRODUCT">Ugl</name><name type="PRODUCT">�k</name> from the rear.</p>
<p>A sudden thought leaped into <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>'s mind, and he acted on it at once. He swerved aside to the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght, and dived out of the reach of his clut<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g guard, head<name type="ORDINAL">first</name> into the mist; he landed sprawling on the grass.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Hal</name>t!'</q> yelled <name type="PRODUCT">Ugl</name><name type="PRODUCT">�k</name>.</p>
<p>There was for a moment turmoil and confusion. <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> sprang up and ran. But the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s were after him. Some suddenly loomed up <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght in front of him.</p>
<p><q>'No hope of escape!'</q> thought <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q>'But there is a hope that I have left some of my own <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ks unspoilt on the wet ground.'</q> He groped with his <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> tied hands at his throat, and unclasped the brooch of his cloak. Just as long arms and hard claws seized him. he let it fall. <q>'There I suppose it will lie until the end of time,'</q> he thought. <q>'I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t know why I did it. If the others have escaped, they've probably all g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> with <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.'</q></p>
<p>A whip-thong curled round his legs, and he stifled a cry.</p>
<p><q>'Enough!'</q> shouted <name type="PRODUCT">Ugl</name><name type="PRODUCT">�k</name> running up. <q>'He's still got to run a long way yet. Make 'em both run! Just use the whip as a reminder.'</q></p>
<p><q>'But that's not all,'</q> he snarled, turning to <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q>'I shan't forget. Payment is only put off. Leg it!'</q></p>
<p>Neither <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> nor <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> remembered much of the later part of the journey. Evil dreams and evil waking were blended into a long tunnel of misery, with hope growing ever fainter behind. They ran, and they ran, st<name type="GPE">ri</name>ving to keep up the pace set by the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s, licked every now and again with a cruel thong cunningly handled. If they halted or stumbled, they were seized and dragged for some distance.</p>
<p>The warmth of the orc-draught had g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> felt cold and sick again. Suddenly he fell face downward on the turf. Hard hands with rending nails g<name type="GPE">ri</name>pped and lifted him. He was car<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed like a sack once more, and darkness grew about him: whether the darkness of <name type="TIME">another <name type="TIME">night</name></name>, or a blindness of his eyes, he could not tell.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Dimly</name> he became aware of voices clamou<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng: it seemed that many of the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s were demanding a halt. <name type="PRODUCT">Ugl</name><name type="PRODUCT">�k</name> was shouting. He felt himself flung to the ground, and he lay as he fell, till black dreams took him. But he did not long escape from pain; soon the iron g<name type="GPE">ri</name>p of merciless hands was on him again. For a long time he was tossed and shaken, and then slowly the darkness gave way, and he came back to the waking world and found that it was <name type="TIME">morning</name>. Orders were shouted and he was thrown roughly on the grass.</p>
<p>There he lay for a while, fighting with despair. His head swam, but from the heat in his body he guessed that he had been given another draught. An <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name> stooped over him, and flung him some bread and a st<name type="GPE">ri</name>p of raw d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed flesh. He ate the stale grey bread hung<name type="GPE">ri</name>ly, but not the meat. He was famished but not yet so famished as to eat flesh flung to him by an <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>, the flesh of he dared not guess what creature.</p>
<p>He sat up and looked about. <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> was not far away. They were by the banks of a swift narrow <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver. Ahead mountains loomed: a tall peak was cat<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> rays of the sun. A dark smudge of forest lay on the lower slopes before them.</p>
<p>There was much shouting and debating among the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s; a quarrel seemed on the point of breaking out again between the <name type="LOC">North</name>erners and the <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>garders. Some were pointing back away south, and some were pointing eastward.</p>
<p><q>'Very well,'</q> said <name type="PRODUCT">Ugl</name><name type="PRODUCT">�k</name>. <q>'Leave them to me then! No killing, as I've told you before; but if you <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t to throw away what we've come all the way to get, throw it away! I'll look after it. Let the fighting <name type="PERSON">Uruk-<name type="PERSON">hai</name></name> do the work, as usual. If you're afraid of the <name type="PERSON">Whiteskins</name>, run! Run! There's the forest,'</q> he shouted, pointing ahead. <q>'Get to it! It's your best hope. Off you go! And quick, before I knock a few more heads off, to put some sense into the others.'</q></p>
<p>There was some cursing and scuffling, and then most of the <name type="LOC">North</name>erners broke away and dashed off, over <name type="CARDINAL">a <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name></name> of them, running wildly along the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver towards the mountains. The hobbits were left with the <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>garders: a g<name type="GPE">ri</name>m dark band, <name type="CARDINAL">four</name> score at least of large, <name type="PERSON">swart</name>, slant-eyed <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s with great bows and short broad-bladed swords. A few of the larger and bolder <name type="LOC">North</name>erners remained with them.</p>
<p><q>'Now we'll deal with <name type="PERSON">G<name type="GPE">ri</name>shn<name type="PRODUCT">�k</name>h</name>,'</q> said <name type="PRODUCT">Ugl</name><name type="PRODUCT">�k</name>; but some even of his own followers were looking uneasily southwards.</p>
<p><q>'I know,'</q> growled <name type="PRODUCT">Ugl</name><name type="PRODUCT">�k</name>. <q>'The cursed horse-boys have got wind of us. But that's all your fault, <name type="PERSON">Snaga</name>. You and the other scouts ought to have your ears cut off. But we are the fighters. We'll feast on horseflesh yet, or something better.'</q></p>
<p>At that moment <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> saw why some of the troop had been pointing eastward. From that direction there now came hoarse c<name type="GPE">ri</name>es, and there was <name type="PERSON">G<name type="GPE">ri</name>shn<name type="PRODUCT">�k</name>h</name> again, and at his back a couple of score of others like him: long-armed crook-legged <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s. They had a red eye painted on their shields. <name type="PRODUCT">Ugl</name><name type="PRODUCT">�k</name> stepped forward to meet them. <q>'So you've come back?'</q> he said. <q>'Thought better of it, eh?'</q></p>
<p><q>'I've returned to see that Orders are car<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed out and the p<name type="GPE">ri</name>s<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>rs safe,'</q> answered <name type="PERSON">G<name type="GPE">ri</name>shn<name type="PRODUCT">�k</name>h</name>.</p>
<p><q>'Indeed!'</q> said <name type="PRODUCT">Ugl</name><name type="PRODUCT">�k</name>. <q>'Waste of effort. I'll see that orders are car<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed out in my command. And what else did you come back for? You went in a hurry. Did you leave anything behind?'</q></p>
<p><q>'I left a fool,'</q> snarled <name type="PERSON">G<name type="GPE">ri</name>shn<name type="PRODUCT">�k</name>h</name>. <q>'But there were some stout fellows with him that are too good to lose. I knew you'd lead them into a mess. I've come to help them.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Splendid!'</q> laughed <name type="PRODUCT">Ugl</name><name type="PRODUCT">�k</name>. <q>'But unless you've got some guts for fighting, you've taken the wrong way. <name type="GPE">Lugb</name>�rz was your road. The <name type="PERSON">Whiteskins</name> are coming. What's happened to your precious Nazg�l? Has he had another mount shot under him? Now, if you'd brought him along, that might have been useful-if these Nazg�l are all they make out.'</q></p>
<p><q>'_Nazg�l, Nazg�l_,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">G<name type="GPE">ri</name>shn<name type="PRODUCT">�k</name>h</name>, shive<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng and licking his lips, as if the word had a foul taste that he savoured painfully. <q>'You speak of what is deep beyond the reach of your muddy dreams, <name type="PRODUCT">Ugl</name><name type="PRODUCT">�k</name>,'</q> he said. <q>'_Nazg�l!_Ah! All that they make out! <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> <name type="DATE">day</name> you'll wish that you had not said that. Ape!'</q> he snarled fiercely. <q>'You ought to know that they're the apple of the Great <name type="PRODUCT">Eye</name>. But the winged Nazg�l: not yet, not yet. He won't let them show themselves across the <name type="LOC">Great <name type="LOC">River</name></name> yet, not too soon. They're for <name type="EVENT">the War-and</name> other purposes.'</q></p>
<p><q>'You seem to know a lot,'</q> said <name type="PRODUCT">Ugl</name><name type="PRODUCT">�k</name>. <q>'More than is good for you, I guess. Perhaps those in <name type="GPE">Lugb</name>�rz might wonder how, and why. But in the meantime the <name type="PERSON">Uruk-<name type="PERSON">hai</name></name> of <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard can do the dirty work, as usual. <name type="PERSON">Don</name>'t stand slave<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng there! Get your rabble together! The other swine are legging it to the forest. You'd better follow. You wouldn't get back to the <name type="LOC">Great <name type="LOC">River</name></name> alive. Right off the <name type="PERSON">mar</name>k! Now! I'll be on your heels.'</q></p>
<p>The <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>garders seized <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> again and slung them on their backs. Then the troop started off. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>ur after <name type="TIME">hour</name> they ran, pausing now and again only to sling the hobbits to fresh car<name type="GPE">ri</name>ers. Either because they were quicker and hardier, or because of some plan of <name type="PERSON">G<name type="GPE">ri</name>shn<name type="PRODUCT">�k</name>h</name>'s, the <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>garders gradually passed through the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>, and <name type="PERSON">G<name type="GPE">ri</name>shn<name type="PRODUCT">�k</name>h</name>'s folk closed in behind. Soon they were gaining also on the <name type="LOC">North</name>erners ahead. The forest began to draw nearer.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> was bruised and torn, his a<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g head was grated by the filthy jowl and <name type="PERSON">hai</name>ry ear of the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name> that held him. Immediately in front were bowed backs, and tough thick legs going up and down, up and down, unresting, as if they were made of wire and horn, beating out the <name type="TIME">night</name><name type="PERSON">mar</name>e <name type="ORG">sec</name>onds of an endless time.</p>
<p>In the <name type="TIME">after<name type="TIME">noon</name></name> <name type="PRODUCT">Ugl</name><name type="PRODUCT">�k</name>'s troop overtook the <name type="LOC">North</name>erners. They were flagging in the rays of the b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght sun, <name type="DATE">winter</name> sun shining in a pale cool sky though it was; their heads were down and their tongues lolling out.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Maggot</name>s!'</q> jeered the <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>garders. <q>'You're cooked. The <name type="PERSON">Whiteskins</name> will catch you and eat you. They're coming!'</q></p>
<p>A cry from <name type="PERSON">G<name type="GPE">ri</name>shn<name type="PRODUCT">�k</name>h</name> showed that this was not mere jest. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>rsemen, <name type="GPE">ri</name>ding very swiftly, had indeed been sighted: still far behind, but gaining on the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s, gaining on them like a tide over the flats on folk straying in a quicksand.</p>
<p>The <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>garders began to run with a redoubled pace that astonished <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>, a ter<name type="GPE">ri</name>fic spurt it seemed for the end of a race. Then he saw that the sun was sinking, falling behind the <name type="LOC">Misty <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s</name>; shadows reached over the land. The soldiers of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> lifted their heads and also began to put on speed. The forest was dark and close. Already they had passed a few outlying trees. The land was beginning to slope upwards. ever more steeply; but the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s did not halt. Both <name type="PRODUCT">Ugl</name><name type="PRODUCT">�k</name> and <name type="PERSON">G<name type="GPE">ri</name>shn<name type="PRODUCT">�k</name>h</name> shouted, spur<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng them on to a last effort.</p>
<p><q>'They will make it yet. They will escape,'</q> thought <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. And then he managed to twist his neck. so as to glance back with <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> eye over his shoulder. He saw that <name type="GPE">ri</name>ders away eastward were already level with the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s, galloping over the plain. The sunset gilded their spears and helmets, and glinted in their pale flowing <name type="PERSON">hai</name>r. They were hemming the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s in, preventing them from scatte<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng, and d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ving them along the line of the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver.</p>
<p>He wondered very much what kind of folk they were. He wished now that he had learned more in <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name>, and looked more at maps and things; but in those <name type="DATE">day</name>s the plans for the journey seemed to be in more compe<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>t hands, and he had never reck<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>d with being cut off from <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, or from <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>, and even from <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. All that he could remember about <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> was that <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>'s horse, <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>fax, had come from that land. That sounded hopeful, as far as it went.</p>
<p><q>'But how will they know that we are not <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s?'</q> he thought. <q>'I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t suppose they've ever heard of hobbits down here. I suppose I ought to be glad that the beastly <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s look like being destroyed, but I would rather be saved myself.'</q> The chances were that he and <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> would be killed together with their captors, before ever the <name type="ORG">Men</name> of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> were aware of them.</p>
<p>A few of the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ders appeared to be bowmen, skilled at shooting from a running horse. Riding swiftly into range they shot arrows at the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s that straggled behind, and several of them fell; then the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ders wheeled away out of the range of the answe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng bows of their enemies, who shot wildly, not da<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng to halt. This happened many times, and on <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> occasion arrows fell among the <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>garders. <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> of them, just in front of <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>, stumbled and did not get up again.</p>
<p>Night came down without the <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s closing in for battle. Many <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s had fallen, but fully <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name> remained. In the early darkness the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s came to a hillock. The eaves of the forest were very near, probably <name type="CARDINAL">no more than <name type="CARDINAL">three</name></name> furlongs away, but they could go no further. The horsemen had encircled them. A small band disobeyed <name type="PRODUCT">Ugl</name><name type="PRODUCT">�k</name>'s command, and ran on towards the forest: <name type="CARDINAL">only <name type="CARDINAL">three</name></name> returned.</p>
<p><q>'Well, here we are,'</q> sneered <name type="PERSON">G<name type="GPE">ri</name>shn<name type="PRODUCT">�k</name>h</name>. <q>'Fine leadership! I hope the great <name type="PRODUCT">Ugl</name><name type="PRODUCT">�k</name> will lead us out again.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Put those <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>flings down!'</q> ordered <name type="PRODUCT">Ugl</name><name type="PRODUCT">�k</name>, taking no notice of <name type="PERSON">G<name type="GPE">ri</name>shn<name type="PRODUCT">�k</name>h</name>. <q>'You, <name type="PERSON">Lugdush</name>, get <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> others and stand guard over them! They're not to be killed, unless the filthy <name type="PERSON">Whiteskins</name> break through. Understand? As long as I'm alive, I <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t 'em. But they're not to cry out, and they're not to be rescued. Bind their legs!'</q></p>
<p>The last part of the order was car<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed out mercilessly. But <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> found that for the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> time he was close to <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. The <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s were making a great deal of noise, shouting and clashing their weapons, and the hobbits managed to whisper together for a while.</p>
<p><q>'I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t think much of this,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'I feel nearly <name type="PERSON">don</name>e in. <name type="PERSON">Don</name>'t think I could crawl away far, even if I was free.'</q></p>
<p><q>'_<name type="PERSON">Lembas</name>!_' whispered <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. '_<name type="PERSON">Lembas</name>:_ I've got some. Have you? I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t think they've taken anything but our swords.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Yes, I had a packet in my pocket,'</q> answered <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>, <q>'but it must be battered to crumbs. Anyway I can't put my mouth in my pocket!'</q></p>
<p><q>'You won't have to. I've-'</q>; but just then a savage kick warned <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> that the noise had died down, and the guards were watchful.</p>
<p><name type="TIME">The <name type="TIME">night</name></name> was cold and still. All round the knoll on which the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s were gathered little watch-fires sprang up, golden-red in the darkness, a complete <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng of them. They were within a long <name type="ORG">bowshot</name>. but the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ders did not show themselves against the light, and the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s wasted many arrows shooting at the fires, until <name type="PRODUCT">Ugl</name><name type="PRODUCT">�k</name> stopped them. The <name type="GPE">ri</name>ders made no sound. <name type="TIME">Later in the <name type="TIME">night</name></name> when the moon came out of the mist, then occasionally they could be seen, shadowy shapes that glinted now and again in the white light, as they moved in ceaseless patrol.</p>
<p><q>'They'll wait for the <name type="ORG">Sun</name>, curse them!'</q> growled <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the guards. <q>'Why <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t we get together and charge through? What's old <name type="PRODUCT">Ugl</name><name type="PRODUCT">�k</name> think he's doing, I should like to know?'</q></p>
<p><q>'I daresay you would,'</q> snarled <name type="PRODUCT">Ugl</name><name type="PRODUCT">�k</name> stepping up from behind. 'Meaning I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t think at all, eh? Curse you! You're as bad as the other rabble: the maggots and the apes of <name type="GPE">Lugb</name>�rz. No good trying to charge with them. They'd just squeal and bolt, and there are more than enough of these filthy horse-boys to mop up our lot on the flat.</p>
<p><q>'There's only <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> thing those maggots can do: they can see like gimlets in the dark. But these <name type="PERSON">Whiteskins</name> have better <name type="TIME">night</name>-eyes than most <name type="ORG">Men</name>, from all I've heard; and <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t forget their horses! They can see the <name type="TIME">night</name>-breeze, or so it's said. Still there's <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> thing the fine fellows <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t know: Mauh�r and his lads are in the forest, and they should turn up any time now.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PRODUCT">Ugl</name><name type="PRODUCT">�k</name>'s words were enough, apparently, to satisfy the <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>garders; but the other <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s were both dispi<name type="GPE">ri</name>ted and rebellious. They posted a few watchers, but most of them lay on the ground, resting in the pleasant darkness. It did indeed become very dark again; for the moon passed westward into thick cloud, and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> could not see anything <name type="QUANTITY">a few feet</name> away. The fires brought no light to the hillock. The <name type="GPE">ri</name>ders were not, however, con<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>t merely to wait for the <name type="TIME">dawn</name> and let their enemies rest. A sudden outcry on the east side of the knoll showed that something was wrong. It seemed that some of the <name type="ORG">Men</name> had <name type="GPE">ri</name>dden in close, slipped off their horses, crawled to the edge of the camp and killed several <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s, and then had faded away again. <name type="PRODUCT">Ugl</name><name type="PRODUCT">�k</name> dashed off to stop a stampede.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> and <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> sat up. Their guards, <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>garders, had g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> with <name type="PRODUCT">Ugl</name><name type="PRODUCT">�k</name>. But if the hobbits had any thought of escape, it was soon dashed. A long <name type="PERSON">hai</name>ry arm took each of them by the neck and drew them close together. <name type="PERSON">Dimly</name> they were aware of <name type="PERSON">G<name type="GPE">ri</name>shn<name type="PRODUCT">�k</name>h</name>'s great head and hideous face between them; his foul breath was on their cheeks. He began to paw them and feel them. <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> shuddered as hard cold fingers groped down his back.</p>
<p><q>'Well, my little <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">G<name type="GPE">ri</name>shn<name type="PRODUCT">�k</name>h</name> in a soft whisper. <q>'Enjoying your nice rest? Or not? A little awkwardly placed, perhaps: swords and whips on <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> side, and nasty spears on the other! Little people should not meddle _in affairs that are too big for them.'</q> His fingers continued to grope. There was a light like a pale but hot fire behind his eyes.</p>
<p>The thought came suddenly into <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>'s mind, as if caught direct from the urgent thought of his enemy: <q>'<name type="PERSON">G<name type="GPE">ri</name>shn<name type="PRODUCT">�k</name>h</name> knows about the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>! He's looking for it, while <name type="PRODUCT">Ugl</name><name type="PRODUCT">�k</name> is busy: he probably <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ts it for himself.'</q> Cold fear was in <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>'s heart, yet at the same time he was wonde<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng what use he could make of <name type="PERSON">G<name type="GPE">ri</name>shn<name type="PRODUCT">�k</name>h</name>'s desire.</p>
<p><q>'I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t think you will find it that way,'</q> he whispered. <q>'It isn't easy to find.'</q></p>
<p><q>'_Find it?_' said <name type="PERSON">G<name type="GPE">ri</name>shn<name type="PRODUCT">�k</name>h</name>: his fingers stopped crawling and g<name type="GPE">ri</name>pped <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>'s shoulder. 'Find what? What are you talking about, little <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>?'</q>. For a moment <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> was silent. Then suddenly in the darkness he made a noise in his throat: _<name type="PERSON">gollum</name>, <name type="PERSON">gollum</name>_. <q>'Nothing, my precious,'</q> he added.</p>
<p>The hobbits felt <name type="PERSON">G<name type="GPE">ri</name>shn<name type="PRODUCT">�k</name>h</name>'s fingers twitch. <q>'O ho!'</q> hissed the goblin softly. <q>'That's what he means, is it? O ho! Very ve-ry dangerous, my little <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Perhaps,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>, now alert and aware of <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>'s guess. <q>'Perhaps; and not only for us. Still you know your own business best. Do you <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t it, or not? And what would you give for it?'</q></p>
<p><q>'Do I <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t it? Do I <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t it?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">G<name type="GPE">ri</name>shn<name type="PRODUCT">�k</name>h</name>, as if puzzled; but his arms were trembling. <q>'What would I give for it? What do you mean?'</q></p>
<p><q>'We mean,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>, choosing his words carefully, <q>'that it's no good groping in the dark. We could save you time and trouble. But you must untie our legs <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>, or we'll do nothing, and say nothing.'</q></p>
<p><q>'My dear <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>der little fools,'</q> hissed <name type="PERSON">G<name type="GPE">ri</name>shn<name type="PRODUCT">�k</name>h</name>, <q>'everything you have, and everything you know, will be got out of you in due time: everything! You'll wish there was more that you could tell to satisfy the <name type="PRODUCT">Quest</name>i<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>r, indeed you will: quite soon. We shan't hurry the enquiry. Oh dear no! What do you think you've been kept alive for? My dear little fellows, please believe me when I say that it was not out of kindness: that's not even <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of <name type="PRODUCT">Ugl</name><name type="PRODUCT">�k</name>'s faults.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I find it quite easy to believe,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'But you haven't got your prey home yet. And it doesn't seem to be going your way, whatever happens. If we come to <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard, it won't be the great <name type="PERSON">G<name type="GPE">ri</name>shn<name type="PRODUCT">�k</name>h</name> that benefits: <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> will take all that he can find. If you <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t anything for yourself, now's the time to do a deal.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">G<name type="GPE">ri</name>shn<name type="PRODUCT">�k</name>h</name> began to lose his temper. The name of <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> seemed specially to enrage him. <name type="PERSON">Tim</name>e was passing and the disturbance was dying down. <name type="PRODUCT">Ugl</name><name type="PRODUCT">�k</name> or the <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>garders might return at <name type="TIME">any minute</name>.</p>
<p><q>'Have you got it � either of you?'</q> he snarled.</p>
<p>'_<name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>, <name type="PERSON">gollum</name>!_' said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>.</p>
<p><q>'Untie our legs!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>.</p>
<p>They felt the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>'s arms trembling violently. <q>'Curse you, you filthy little vermin!'</q> he hissed. <q>'Untie your legs? I'll untie every st<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng in your bodies. Do you think I can't search you to the b<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s? <name type="LOC">Sea</name>rch you! I'll cut you both to quive<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng shreds. I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t need the help of your legs to get you away-and have you all to myself!'</q></p>
<p>Suddenly he seized them. The strength in his long arms and shoulders was ter<name type="GPE">ri</name>fying. He tucked them <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> under each armpit, and crushed them fiercely to his sides; a great stifling hand was clapped over each of their mouths. Then he sprang forward, stooping low. Quickly and silently he went, until he came to the edge of the knoll. There, choosing a gap between the watchers, he passed like an evil shadow out into the <name type="TIME">night</name>, down the slope and away westward towards the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver that flowed out of the forest. In that direction there was a wide open space with only <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> fire.</p>
<p>After going <name type="CARDINAL">a <name type="CARDINAL">dozen</name></name> yards he halted, pee<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng and lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing. Nothing could be seen or heard. He crept slowly on, bent almost double. Then he squatted and lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed again. Then he stood up, as if to <name type="GPE">ri</name>sk a sudden dash. At that very moment the dark form of a <name type="GPE">ri</name>der loomed up <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght in front of him. A horse snorted and reared. A man called out.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">G<name type="GPE">ri</name>shn<name type="PRODUCT">�k</name>h</name> flung himself on the ground flat, dragging the hobbits under him; then he drew his sword. No doubt he meant to kill his captives, rather than allow them to escape or to be rescued; but it was his undoing. The sword rang faintly, and glinted a little in the light of the fire away to his left. An arrow came whistling out of the gloom: it was aimed with skill, or guided by fate, and it pierced his <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght hand. He dropped the sword and sh<name type="GPE">ri</name>eked. There was a quick beat of hoofs, and even as <name type="PERSON">G<name type="GPE">ri</name>shn<name type="PRODUCT">�k</name>h</name> leaped up and ran, he was <name type="GPE">ri</name>dden down and a spear passed through him. He gave a hideous shive<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng cry and lay still.</p>
<p>The hobbits remained flat on the ground, as <name type="PERSON">G<name type="GPE">ri</name>shn<name type="PRODUCT">�k</name>h</name> had left them. Another horseman came <name type="GPE">ri</name>ding swiftly to his comrade's aid. Whether because of some special keenness of sight, or because of some other sense, the horse lifted and sprang lightly over them; but its <name type="GPE">ri</name>der did not see them, lying covered in their <name type="ORG">elven</name>-cloaks, too crushed for the moment, and too afraid to move.</p>
<p>At last <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> stirred and whispered softly: <q>'So far so good: but how are _we_ to avoid being spitted?'</q></p>
<p>The answer came almost immediately. The c<name type="GPE">ri</name>es of <name type="PERSON">G<name type="GPE">ri</name>shn<name type="PRODUCT">�k</name>h</name> had roused the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s. From the yells and screeches that came from the knoll the hobbits guessed that their disappearance had been discovered: <name type="PRODUCT">Ugl</name><name type="PRODUCT">�k</name> was probably knocking off a few more heads. Then suddenly the answe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng c<name type="GPE">ri</name>es of orc-voices came from the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght, outside the circle of watch-fires, from the direction of the forest and the mountains. Mauh�r had apparently ar<name type="GPE">ri</name>ved and was attacking the besiegers. There was the sound of galloping horses. The <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s were drawing in their <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng close round the knoll, <name type="GPE">ri</name>sking the orc-arrows, so as to prevent any sortie, while a company rode off to deal with the newcomers. Suddenly <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> realized that without moving they were now outside the circle: there was nothing between them and escape.</p>
<p><q>'Now,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>, <q>'if only we had our legs and hands free, we might get away. But I can't touch the knots, and I can't bite them.'</q></p>
<p><q>'No need to try,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q>'I was going to tell you: I've managed to free my hands. These loops are only left for show. You'd better have a bit of _lembas_ <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>.'</q></p>
<p>He slipped the cords off his w<name type="GPE">ri</name>sts, and fished out a packet. The cakes were broken, but good, still in their leaf-wrappings. The hobbits each ate <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> or <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> pieces. The taste brought back to them the memory of fair faces, and laughter, and wholesome food in quiet <name type="DATE">day</name>s now far away. For a while they ate thoughtfully, sitting in the dark, heedless of the c<name type="GPE">ri</name>es and sounds of battle nearby. <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> was the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> to come back to the present.</p>
<p><q>'We must be off,'</q> he said. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Hal</name>f a moment!'</q> <name type="PERSON">G<name type="GPE">ri</name>shn<name type="PRODUCT">�k</name>h</name>'s sword was lying close at hand, but it was too heavy and clumsy for him to use; so he crawled forward, and finding the body of the goblin he drew from its sheath a long sharp knife. With this he quickly cut their bonds.</p>
<p><q>'Now for it!'</q> he said. <q>'When we've warmed up a bit, perhaps we shall be able to stand again, and walk. But in any case we had better start by crawling.'</q></p>
<p>They crawled. The turf was deep and yielding, and that helped them: but it seemed a long slow business. They gave the watch-fire a wide berth, and wormed their way forward bit by bit, until they came to the edge of the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver, gurgling away in the black shadows under its deep banks. Then they looked back.</p>
<p>The sounds had died away. Evidently Mauh�r and his 'lads' had been killed or d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ven off. The <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s had returned to their silent ominous vigil. It would not last very much longer. Already the <name type="TIME">night</name> was old. In the <name type="LOC">East</name>, which had remained unclouded, the sky was beginning to grow pale.</p>
<p><q>'We must get under cover,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>, <q>'or we shall be seen. It will not be any comfort to us, if these <name type="GPE">ri</name>ders discover that we are not <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s after we are dead.'</q> He got up and stamped his feet. <q>'Those cords have cut me like wires; but my feet are getting warm again. I could stagger on now. What about you, <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>?'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Merry</name> got up. <q>'Yes,'</q> he said, <q>'I can manage it. _<name type="PERSON">Lembas</name>_ does put heart into you! A more wholesome sort of feeling, too, than the heat of that orc-draught. I wonder what it was made of. Better not to know, I expect. Let's get a d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk of water to wash away the thought of it!'</q></p>
<p><q>'Not here, the banks are too steep,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q>'Forward now!'</q></p>
<p>They turned and walked side by side slowly along the line of the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver. Behind them the light grew in the <name type="LOC">East</name>. As they walked they compared notes, talking lightly in hobbit-fashion of the things that had happened since their capture. No lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>er would have guessed from their words that they had suffered cruelly, and been in dire pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>l, going without hope towards torment and death; or that even now, as they knew well, they had little chance of ever finding f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end or safety again.</p>
<p><q>'You seem to have been doing well, <name type="PERSON">Master <name type="PERSON">Took</name></name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. 'You will get almost a chapter in old <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>'s book, if ever I get a chance to report to him. Good work: especially guessing that <name type="PERSON">hai</name>ry villain's little game, and playing <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name> him. But I wonder if any<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> will ever pick up your trail and find that brooch. I should hate to lose mine, but I am afraid yours is g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> for good.</p>
<p><q>'I shall have to brush up my toes, if I am to get level with you. Indeed Cousin <name type="ORG">Brand</name>ybuck is going in front now. This is where he comes in. I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t suppose you have much notion where we are; but I spent my time at <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name> rather better. We are walking west along the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>wash. The butt-end of the <name type="LOC">Misty <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s</name> is in front, and <name type="PERSON">Fangorn</name> <name type="ORG">Forest</name>.'</q></p>
<p>Even as he spoke the dark edge of the forest loomed up straight before them. Night seemed to have taken refuge under its great trees, creeping away from the coming <name type="PERSON">Dawn</name>.</p>
<p><q>'Lead on, Master <name type="ORG">Brand</name>ybuck!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q>'Or lead back! We have been warned against <name type="PERSON">Fangorn</name>. But <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> so knowing will not have forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> that.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I have not,'</q> answered <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>; <q>'but the forest seems better to me, all the same, than turning back into the middle of a battle.'</q></p>
<p>He led the way in under the huge branches of the trees. Old beyond guessing, they seemed. Great trailing beards of lichen hung from them, blowing and swaying in the breeze. Out of the shadows the hobbits peeped, gazing back down the slope: little furtive figures that in the dim light looked like elf-children in the deeps of time pee<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng out of the Wild <name type="PERSON">Wood</name> in wonder at their <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> <name type="PERSON">Dawn</name>.</p>
<p><name type="LOC">Far</name> over the <name type="LOC">Great <name type="LOC">River</name></name>, and the <name type="PERSON">Brown</name> Lands, leagues upon <name type="ORG">grey leagues</name> away, the <name type="PERSON">Dawn</name> came, red as flame. <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ud rang the hunting-horns to greet it. The <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> sprang suddenly to life. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>rn answered horn again.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Merry</name> and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> heard, clear in the cold air, the neighing of war-horses, and the sudden singing of many men. The <name type="ORG">Sun</name>'s limb was lifted, an arc of fire, above the <name type="PERSON">mar</name>gin of the world. Then with a great cry the <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s charged from the <name type="LOC">East</name>; the red light gleamed on mail and spear. The <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s yelled and shot all the arrows that remained to them. The hobbits saw several horsemen fall; but their line held on up the hill and over it, and wheeled round and charged again. Most of the raiders that were left alive then broke and fled, this way and that, pursued <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> by <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> to the death. But <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> band, holding together in a black wedge, drove forward resolutely in the direction of the forest. Straight up the slope they charged towards the watchers. Now they were drawing near, and it seemed certain that they would escape: they had already hewn down <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s that barred their way.</p>
<p><q>'We have watched too long,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'There's <name type="PRODUCT">Ugl</name><name type="PRODUCT">�k</name>! I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t to meet him again.'</q> The hobbits turned and fled deep into the shadows of the wood.</p>
<p>So it was that they did not <name type="ORG">sec</name> the last stand, when <name type="PRODUCT">Ugl</name><name type="PRODUCT">�k</name> was overtaken and brought to bay at the very edge of <name type="PERSON">Fangorn</name>. There he was slain at last by �omer, the <name type="ORDINAL">Third</name> Marshal of the <name type="PERSON">Mark</name>, who dismounted and fought him sword to sword. And over the wide fields the keen-eyed <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s hunted down the few <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s that had escaped and still had strength to fly.</p>
<p>Then when they had laid their fallen comrades in a mound and had sung their praises, the <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s made a great fire and scattered the ashes of their enemies. So ended the raid, and no news of it came ever back either to <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> or to <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard; but the smoke of the burning rose high to heaven and was seen by many watchful eyes.</p>

<p><name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard</p>
<p>Meanwhile the hobbits went with as much speed as the dark and tangled forest allowed, following the line of the running stream, westward and <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name>wards the slopes of the mountains, deeper and deeper into <name type="PERSON">Fangorn</name>. Slowly their fear of the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s died away, and their pace slackened. A queer stifling feeling came over them, as if the air were too thin or too scanty for breathing.</p>
<p>At last <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> halted. <q>'We can't go on like this,'</q> he panted. <q>'I <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t some air.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Let's have a d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk at any rate,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q>'I'm parched.'</q> He clambered on to a great tree-root that wound down into the stream, and stooping drew up some water in his cupped hands. It was clear and cold, and he took many draughts. <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> followed him. The water refreshed them and seemed to cheer their hearts; for a while they sat together on the b<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk of the stream, dabbling their sore feet and legs, and pee<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng round at the trees that stood silently about them, rank upon rank, until they faded away into grey <name type="TIME">twilight</name> in every direction.</p>
<p><q>'I suppose you haven't lost us already?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>, leaning back against a great tree-trunk. <q>'We can at least follow the course of this stream, the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>wash or whatever you call it, and get out again the way we came.'</q></p>
<p><q>'We could, if our legs would do it,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>; <q>'and if we could breathe properly.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Yes, it is all very dim, and stuffy, in here,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q>'It reminds me, somehow, of the old room in <name type="EVENT">the Great Place</name> of the <name type="PERSON">Took</name>s away back in the Smials at <name type="GPE">Tuckborough</name>: a huge place, where the furniture has never been moved or changed for generations. They say the Old <name type="PERSON">Took</name> lived in <name type="DATE">it <name type="DATE">year</name> after <name type="DATE">year</name></name>, while he and the room got older and shabbier together-and it has never changed since he died, <name type="DATE">a century</name> ago. And <name type="PERSON">Old Gerontius</name> was my great-great-grandfather: that puts it back a bit. But that is nothing to the old feeling of this wood. <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok at all those weeping, trailing, beards and whiskers of lichen! And most of the trees seem to be <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> covered with ragged dry leaves that have never fallen. <name type="ORG">Untidy</name>. I can't imagine what sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng would look like here, if it ever comes; still less a sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng-cleaning.'</q></p>
<p><q>'But the <name type="ORG">Sun</name> at any rate must peep in sometimes.'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'It does not look or feel at all like <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>'s desc<name type="GPE">ri</name>ption of <name type="GPE">Mirkwood</name>. That was all dark and black, and the home of dark black things. This is just dim, and f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ghtfully tree-ish. You can't imagine _animals_ living here at all, or staying for long.'</q></p>
<p><q>'No, nor hobbits,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q>'And I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t like the thought of trying to get through it either. Nothing to eat for <name type="CARDINAL">a <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name></name> miles, I should guess. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w are our supplies?'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>w,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'We ran off with nothing but a couple of spare packets of _lembas_, and left everything else behind.'</q> They looked at what remained of the <name type="ORG">elven</name>-cakes: broken fragments for <name type="DATE">about <name type="CARDINAL">five</name> meagre <name type="DATE">day</name>s</name>, that was all. <q>'And not a wrap or a blanket,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'We shall be cold to<name type="TIME">night</name>, whichever way we go.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Well, we'd better decide on the way now,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q>'<name type="TIME">The <name type="TIME">morning</name></name> must be getting on.'</q></p>
<p>Just then they became aware of a yellow light that had appeared, some way further on into the wood: shafts of sunlight seemed suddenly to have pierced the forest-roof.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="ORG">Hullo</name>!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'The <name type="ORG">Sun</name> must have run into a cloud while we've been under these trees, and now she has run out again; or else she has climbed high enough to look down through some opening. It isn't far � let's go and investigate!'</q></p>
<p>They found it was further than they thought. The ground was <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing steeply still, and it was becoming increasingly stony. The light grew broader as they went on, and soon they saw that there was a rock-wall before them: the side of a hill, or the abrupt end of some long root thrust out by the distant mountains. No trees grew on it, and the sun was falling full on its stony face. The twigs of the trees at its foot were stretched out stiff and still, as if rea<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g out to the warmth. Where all had looked so shabby and grey before, the wood now gleamed with <name type="GPE">ri</name>ch browns, and with the smooth black-greys of bark like polished leather. The boles of the trees glowed with a soft green like young grass: <name type="DATE">early sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng</name> or a fleeting vision of it was about them.</p>
<p>In the face of the stony wall there was something like a stair: natural perhaps, and made by the weathe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng and splitting of the rock, for it was rough and uneven. High up, almost level with the tops of forest-trees, there was a shelf under a cliff. Nothing grew there but a few grasses and weeds at its edge, and <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> old stump of a tree with <name type="CARDINAL">only <name type="CARDINAL">two</name></name> bent branches left: it looked almost like the figure of some gnarled old man, standing there, blinking in the <name type="TIME">morning</name>-light.</p>
<p><q>'Up we go!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> joyfully. <q>'Now for a breath of air, and a sight of the land!'</q></p>
<p>They climbed and scrambled up the rock. If the stair had been made it was for bigger feet and longer legs than theirs. They were too eager to be surp<name type="GPE">ri</name>sed at the re<name type="PERSON">mar</name>kable way in which the cuts and sores of their captivity had healed and their vigour had returned. They came at length to the edge of the shelf almost at the feet of the old stump; then they sprang up and turned round with their backs to the hill, breathing deep, and looking out eastward. They saw that they had only come <name type="CARDINAL">some <name type="CARDINAL">three</name></name> or <name type="CARDINAL">four</name> miles into the forest: the heads of the trees <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ched down the slopes towards the plain. There, near the f<name type="GPE">ri</name>nge of the forest, tall spires of curling black smoke went up, wave<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng and floating towards them.</p>
<p><q>'The wind's changing,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'It's turned east again. It feels cool up here.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Yes,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>; <q>'I'm afraid this is only a passing gleam, and it will all go grey again. What a pity! This shaggy old forest looked so different in the sunlight. I almost felt I liked the place.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Almost felt you liked the <name type="ORG">Forest</name>! That's good! That's uncommonly kind of you,'</q> said a strange voice. <q>'Turn round and let me have a look at your faces. I almost feel that I dislike you both, but do not let us be hasty. Turn round!'</q> A large knob-knuckled hand was laid on each of their shoulders, and they were twisted round, gently but irresistibly; then <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> great arms lifted them up.</p>
<p>They found that they were looking at a most extraordinary face. It belonged to a large Man-like, almost <name type="ORG">Troll</name>-like, figure, <name type="QUANTITY">at least <name type="CARDINAL">four</name>teen foot</name> high, very sturdy, with a tall head, and hardly any neck. Whether it was clad in stuff like green and grey bark, or whether that was its hide, was difficult to say. At any rate the arms, at a short distance from the trunk, were not w<name type="GPE">ri</name>nkled, but covered with a brown smooth skin. The large feet had <name type="CARDINAL">seven</name> toes each. The lower part of the long face was covered with a sweeping <name type="PERSON">grey beard</name>, <name type="PERSON">bush</name>y, almost twiggy at the roots, thin and mossy at the ends. But at the moment the hobbits noted little but the eyes. These deep eyes were now surveying them, slow and solemn, but very penetrating. They were brown, shot with a green light. Of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> afterwards <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed to desc<name type="GPE">ri</name>be his <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> impression of them.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="CARDINAL">One</name> felt as if there was an enormous well behind them, filled up with ages of memory and long, slow, steady thinking; but their surface was sparkling with the present: like sun shimme<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng on the outer leaves of a vast tree, or on the <name type="GPE">ri</name>pples of a very deep lake. I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t know but it felt as if something that grew in the ground-asleep, you might say, or just feeling itself as something between roof-tip and leaf-tip, between deep <name type="LOC">earth</name> and sky had suddenly waked up, and was conside<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng you with the same slow care that it had given to its own inside affairs for endless <name type="DATE">year</name>s.'</q></p>
<p><q>'_Hrum, <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>om_,'</q> murmured the voice, a deep voice like a very deep woodwind instrument. <q>'Very odd indeed! Do not be hasty, that is my motto. But if I had seen you, before I heard your voices � I liked them: nice little voices; they reminded me of something I cannot remember � if I had seen you before I heard you, I should have just trodden on you, taking you for little <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s, and found out my mistake afterwards. Very odd you are, indeed. Root and twig, very odd!'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>, though still amazed, no longer felt afraid. Under those eyes he felt a cu<name type="GPE">ri</name>ous suspense, but not fear. <q>'Please.'</q> he said, <q>'who are you? And what are you?'</q></p>
<p>A queer look came into the old eyes, a kind of wa<name type="GPE">ri</name>ness; the deep wells were covered over. <q>'_Hrum_, now,'</q> answered the voice; <q>'well, I am an <name type="ORG">Ent</name>, or that's what they call me. Yes, <name type="ORG">Ent</name> is the word. _The_ <name type="ORG">Ent</name>, I am, you might say, in your manner of speaking. _<name type="PERSON">Fangorn</name>_ is my name according to some, _<name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard_ others make it. _<name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard_ will do.'</q></p>
<p><q>'An _<name type="ORG">Ent</name>_?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'What's that? But what do you call yourself? What's your real name?'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>o now!'</q> replied <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard. '<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>o! Now that would be telling! Not so hasty. And _I_ am doing the asking. You are in _my_ country. What are _you_, I wonder? I cannot place you. You do not seem to come in the old lists that I learned when I was young. But that was a long, long time ago, and they may have made new lists. Let me see! Let me see! <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w did it go?</p>
<p>Learn now the lore of Living Creatures!</p>
<p><name type="ORDINAL">First</name> name the <name type="CARDINAL">four</name>, the free peoples:</p>
<p>Eldest of all, the elf-children;</p>
<p><name type="WORK_OF_ART">Dwarf</name> the delver, dark are his houses;</p>
<p><name type="ORG">Ent</name> the <name type="LOC">earth</name>born, old as mountains;</p>

<p>Hm, hm, hm.</p>

<p><name type="PERSON">Ho</name>om, hm; <name type="PERSON">hoom</name>. hm. how did it go? Room tum, room tum, roomty toom tum. It was a long list. But anyway you do not seem to fit in anywhere!'</p>
<p><q>'We always seem to have got left out of the old lists, and the old sto<name type="GPE">ri</name>es,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'Yet we've been about for quite a long time. We're _hobbits_.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Why not make a new line?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>.</p>
<p>'<name type="PERSON">Hal</name>f-grown hobbits, the hole-dwellers.</p>
<p>Put us in amongst the <name type="CARDINAL">four</name>, next to Man (the <name type="ORG">Big People</name>) and you've got it.'</p>
<p><q>'Hm! Not bad, not bad,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard. <q>'That would do. So you live in holes, eh? It sounds very <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght and proper. Who calls you _hobbits_, though? That does not sound elvish to me. <name type="ORG">Elves</name> made all the old words: they began it.'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Nob</name>ody else calls us hobbits; we call ourselves that,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>om, hmm! Come now! Not so hasty! You call _yourselves_ hobbits? But you should not go telling just anybody. You'll be letting out your own <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght names if you're not careful.'</q></p>
<p><q>'We aren't careful about that,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'As a matter of fact I'm a <name type="ORG">Brand</name>ybuck, <name type="PERSON">Me<name type="GPE">ri</name>adoc</name> <name type="ORG">Brand</name>ybuck, though most people call me just <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q>'And I'm a <name type="PERSON">Took</name>, <name type="PERSON">Pereg<name type="GPE">ri</name>n</name> <name type="PERSON">Took</name>, but I'm generally called <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>, or even Pip.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Hm, but you _are_ hasty folk, I see,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard. <q>'I am honoured by your confidence; but you should not be too free all at once. There are <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s and <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s, you know; or there are <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s and things that look like <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s but ain't, as you might say. I'll call you <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> if you please � nice names. For I am not going to tell you my name, not yet at any rate.'</q> A queer <name type="CARDINAL">half</name>-knowing, <name type="CARDINAL">half</name>-humorous look came with a green flicker into his eyes. 'For <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> thing it would take a long while: my name is growing all the time, and I've lived a very long, long time; so _my_ name is like a story. Real names tell you the story of the things they belong to in my language, in the Old <name type="ORG">Ent</name>ish as you might say. It is a lovely language, but it takes a very long time to say anything in it, because we do not say anything in it, unless it is worth taking a long time to say, and to lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> to.</p>
<p><q>'But now,'</q> and the eyes became very b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght and <q>'present', seeming to grow smaller and almost sharp, 'what is going on? What are you doing in it all? I can see and hear (_and_ smell _and_ feel) a great deal from this, from this, from this_ a-lalla-lalla-rumba-kamanda-lind-or-bur�m�_. Excuse me: that is a part of my name for it; I do not know what the word is in the outside languages: you know, the thing we are on, where I stand and look out on fine <name type="TIME">morning</name>s, and think about the <name type="ORG">Sun</name>, and the grass beyond the wood, and the horses, and the clouds, and the unfolding of the world. What is going on? What is <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name>? And these � _bur�rum_,'</q> he made a deep rumbling noise like a discord on a great organ � <q>'these <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s, and young <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> down at <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard? I like news. But not too quick now.'</q></p>
<p><q>'There is quite a lot going on,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>: <q>'and even if we t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed to be quick, it would take a long time to tell. But you told us not to be hasty. Ought we to tell you anything so soon? Would you think it rude, if we asked what you are going to do with us, and which side you are on? And did you know <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>?'</q></p>
<p><q>'Yes, I do know him: the only wizard that really cares about trees ' said <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard. 'Do you know him?'</q></p>
<p><q>'Yes,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> sadly, <q>'we did. He was a great f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end, and he was our guide.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Then I can answer your other questions,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard. <q>'I am not going to do anything _with_ you: not if you mean by that 'do something _to_ you' without your leave. We might do some things together. I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t know about _sides_. I go my own way; but your way may go along with mine for a while. But you speak of Master <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, as if he was in a story that had come to an end.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Yes, we do,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> sadly. <q>'The story seems to be going on, but I am afraid <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> has fallen out of it.'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>o, come now!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>om, hm, ah well.'</q> He paused, looking long at the hobbits: <q>'<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>om, ah, well I do not know what to say. Come now!'</q></p>
<p><q>'If you would like to hear more. said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>, 'we will tell you. But it will take some time. Wouldn't you like to put us down? Couldn't we sit here together in the sun, while it lasts? You must be getting tired of holding us up.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Hm, _tired_? No. I am not tired. I do not easily get tired. And I do not sit down. I am not very, hm, bendable. But there, the <name type="ORG">Sun</name> _is_ going in. Let us leave this <name type="ORG">� di</name>d you say what you call it?'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="ORG">Hill</name>?'</q> suggested <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q>'Shelf? Step?'</q> suggested <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard repeated the words thoughtfully. <q>'_<name type="ORG">Hill</name>_. Yes, that was it. But it is a hasty word for a thing that has stood here ever since this part of the world was shaped. Never mind. Let us leave it, and go.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Where shall we go?'</q> asked <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>.</p>
<p><q>'To my home, or <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of my homes,'</q> answered <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard.</p>
<p><q>'Is it far?'</q></p>
<p><q>'I do not know. You might call it far, perhaps. But what does that matter?'</q></p>
<p><q>'Well, you see, we have lost all our belongings,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'We have only a little food.'</q></p>
<p><q>'O! Hm! You need not trouble about that,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard. <q>'I can give you a d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk that will keep you green and growing for a long, long while. And if we decide to part company, I can set you down outside my country at any point you choose. Let us go!'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Ho</name>lding the hobbits gently but firmly, <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> in the crook of each arm, <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard lifted up <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> large foot and then the other, and moved them to the edge of the shelf. The rootlike toes grasped the rocks. Then carefully and solemnly, he stalked down from step to step, and reached the floor of the <name type="ORG">Forest</name>.</p>
<p>At once he set off with long deliberate st<name type="GPE">ri</name>des through the trees, deeper and deeper into the wood, never far from the stream, climbing steadily <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name>wards the slopes of the mountains. Many of the trees seemed asleep, or as unaware of him as of any other creature that merely passed by; but some quivered, and some raised up their branches above his head as he approached. All the while, as he walked, he talked to himself in a long running stream of musical sounds.</p>
<p>The hobbits were silent for some time. They felt, oddly enough, safe and comfortable, and they had a great deal to think and wonder about. At last <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> ventured to speak again.</p>
<p><q>'Please, <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard,'</q> he said, <q>'could I ask you something? Why did <name type="EVENT">Celeborn</name> warn us against your forest? He told us not to <name type="GPE">ri</name>sk getting entangled in it.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Hmm, did he now?'</q> rumbled <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard. 'And I might have said much the same, if you had been going the other way. Do not <name type="GPE">ri</name>sk getting entangled in the woods of _<name type="GPE">Laurelind</name>�<name type="GPE">renan</name>_! That is what the <name type="ORG">Elves</name> used to call it, but now they make the name shorter: <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>thl�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en they call it. Perhaps they are <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght: maybe it is fading; not growing. Land of the <name type="LOC">Valley</name> of Singing Gold, that was it, once upon a time. Now it is the <name type="PERSON">Dreamflower</name>. Ah well! But it is a queer place, and not for just any <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> to venture in. I am surp<name type="GPE">ri</name>sed that you ever got out, but much more surp<name type="GPE">ri</name>sed that you ever got in: that has not happened to strangers for many <name type="DATE">a <name type="DATE">year</name></name>. It is a queer land.</p>
<p><q>'And so is this. Folk have come to g<name type="GPE">ri</name>ef here. Aye, they have, to g<name type="GPE">ri</name>ef._ <name type="GPE">Laurelind</name>�<name type="GPE">renan</name> lindelorendor malinorn�<name type="GPE">lion ornemalin_</name>,'</q> he hummed to himself. <q>'They are falling rather behind the world in there, I guess,'</q> he said 'Neither this country, nor anything else outside the Golden <name type="PERSON">Wood</name>, is what it was when <name type="EVENT">Celeborn</name> was young. Still:</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Taurelil�</name>m�a-tumbalemorna <name type="PRODUCT">Tumbaletaur</name>�a L�m�anor,_*1_</p>
<p>that is what they used to say. Things have changed, but it is still true in places.'</p>
<p><q>'What do you mean?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q>'What is true?'</q></p>
<p><q>'The trees and the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard. 'I do not understand all that goes on myself, so I cannot explain it to you. Some of us are still true <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s, and lively enough in our fashion, but many are growing sleepy, going tree-ish, as you might say. Most of the trees are just trees, of course; but many are <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> awake. Some are quite wide awake, and a few are, well, ah, well getting _<name type="ORG">Ent</name>ish_. That is going on all the time.</p>
<p><q>'When that happens to a tree, you find that some have bad hearts. Nothing to do with their wood: I do not mean that. Why, I knew some good old willows down the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>wash, g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> <name type="DATE">long ago</name>, alas! They were quite hollow, indeed they were falling all to pieces, but as quiet and sweet-spoken as a young leaf. And then there are some trees in the valleys under the mountains, sound as a bell, and bad <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght through. That sort of thing seems to spread. There used to be some very dangerous parts in this country. There are still some very black patches.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Like the Old <name type="ORG">Forest</name> away to the north, do you mean?'</q> asked <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>.</p>
<p>'Aye, aye. something like, but much worse. I do not doubt there is some shadow of the Great <name type="PRODUCT">Darkness</name> lying there still away north; and bad memo<name type="GPE">ri</name>es are handed down. But there are hollow <name type="GPE">dale</name>s in this land where the <name type="PRODUCT">Darkness</name> has never been lifted, and the trees are older than I am. Still, we do what we can. We keep off strangers and the foolhardy; and we train and we teach, we walk and we weed.</p>
<p>'We are tree<name type="PERSON">-he</name>rds, we old <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s. Few enough of us are left now. Sheep get like shepherd, and shepherds like sheep, it is said; but slowly, and neither have long in the world. It is quicker and closer with trees and <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s, and they walk down the ages together. For <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s are more like <name type="ORG">Elves</name>: less interested in themselves than <name type="ORG">Men</name> are, and better at getting inside other things. And yet again <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s are more like <name type="ORG">Men</name>, more changeable than <name type="ORG">Elves</name> are, and quicker at taking the colour of the outside, you might say. Or better than both: for they are steadier and keep their minds on things longer. 'Some of my kin look just like trees now, and need something great to rouse them; and they speak only in whispers. But some of my trees are limb-lithe, and many can talk to me. <name type="ORG">Elves</name> began it, of course, waking trees up and tea<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g them to speak and learning their tree-talk. They always wished to talk to everything, the old <name type="ORG">Elves</name> did. But then the Great <name type="PRODUCT">Darkness</name> came, and they passed away over the <name type="LOC">Sea</name>, or fled into far valleys, and hid themselves, and made songs <name type="DATE">about <name type="DATE">day</name>s</name> that would never come again. Never again. Aye, aye, there was all <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> wood once upon a time: from here to the <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s of <name type="ORG">Lune</name>, and this was just the <name type="LOC">East</name> End.</p>
<p><q>'Those were the broad <name type="DATE">day</name>s! <name type="PERSON">Tim</name>e was when I could walk and sing <name type="DATE">all <name type="DATE">day</name></name> and hear no more than the echo of my own voice in the hollow hills. The woods were like the woods of <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>thl�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en. only thicker stronger, younger. And the smell of the air! I used to spend <name type="DATE">a <name type="DATE">week</name></name> just breathing.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard fell silent, st<name type="GPE">ri</name>ding along, and yet making hardly a sound with his great feet. Then he began to hum again, and passed into a murmu<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng chant. Gradually the hobbits became aware that he was chanting to them:</p>
<p>In the willow-meads of <name type="PERSON">Tasa<name type="GPE">ri</name>nan</name> I walked in the <name type="DATE">Sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng</name>.</p>
<p>Ah! the sight and the smell of the <name type="DATE">Sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng</name> in Nan-tasa<name type="GPE">ri</name>on!</p>
<p>And I said that was good.</p>
<p>I <name type="PERSON">wan</name>dered in <name type="EVENT">Summer</name> in the elm-woods of <name type="PERSON">Ossi<name type="GPE">ri</name>and</name>.</p>
<p>Ah! the light and the music in the <name type="EVENT">Summer</name> by the <name type="CARDINAL">Seven</name> <name type="LOC">River</name>s of Ossir!</p>
<p>And I thought that was best.</p>
<p>To the beeches of <name type="GPE">Neldoreth</name> I came in the <name type="DATE">Autumn</name>.</p>
<p>Ah! the gold and the red and the sighing of leaves in the <name type="DATE">Autumn</name> in Taur-na-neldor!</p>
<p>It was more than my desire.</p>
<p>To the pine-trees upon the highland of <name type="PRODUCT">Dorthonion</name> I climbed in the <name type="DATE">Winter</name>.</p>
<p>Ah! the wind and the whi<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ess and the black branches of <name type="DATE">Winter</name> upon Orod-na-Th�n!</p>
<p>My voice went up and sang in the sky.</p>
<p>And now all those lands lie under the wave.</p>
<p>And I walk in <name type="LOC">Ambar</name>�na, in <name type="NORP">Tauremorna</name>, in <name type="PRODUCT">Aldal</name>�m�.</p>
<p>In my own land, in the country of <name type="PERSON">Fangorn</name>,</p>
<p>Where the roots are long,</p>
<p>And <name type="DATE">the <name type="DATE">year</name></name>s lie thicker than the leaves</p>
<p>In <name type="NORP">Tauremorna</name>l�m�.</p>
<p>He ended, and strode on silently, and in all the wood, as far as ear could reach, there was not a sound.</p>
<p><name type="DATE">The <name type="DATE">day</name></name> <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ed, and <name type="TIME">dusk</name> was twined about the boles of the trees. At last the hobbits saw, <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing dimly before them, a steep dark land: they had come to the feet of the mountains, and to the green roots of tall <name type="PERSON">Methedras</name>. Down the hillside the young <name type="ORG">Ent</name>wash, leaping from its sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ngs high above, ran noisily from step to step to meet them. On the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght of the stream there was a long slope, clad with grass, now grey in the <name type="TIME">twilight</name>. No trees grew there and it was open to the sky; stars were shining already in lakes between shores of cloud.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard strode up the slope, hardly slackening his pace. Suddenly before them the hobbits saw a wide opening. <name type="CARDINAL">Two</name> great trees stood there, <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> on either side, like living gate-posts; but there was no gate save their crossing and interwoven boughs. As the old <name type="ORG">Ent</name> approached, the trees lifted up their branches, and all their leaves quivered and rustled. For they were evergreen trees, and their leaves were dark and polished, and gleamed in the <name type="TIME">twilight</name>. Beyond them was a wide level space, as though the floor of a great hall had been cut in the side of the hill. On either hand the walls sloped upwards, until they were <name type="CARDINAL">fifty</name> feet high or more, and along each wall stood an aisle of trees that also increased in h<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name> as they <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ched inwards.</p>
<p>At the far end the rock-wall was sheer, but at the bot<name type="PERSON">tom</name> it had been hollowed back into a shallow bay with an arched roof: the only roof of the hall, save the branches of the trees, which at the inner end overshadowed all the ground leaving only a broad open path in the middle. A little stream escaped from the sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ngs above, and leaving the main water, fell tinkling down the sheer face of the wall, pou<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng in silver drops, like a fine curtain in front of the arched bay. The water was gathered again into a st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> basin in the floor between the trees, and thence it spilled and flowed away beside the open path, out to rejoin the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>wash in its journey through the forest.</p>
<p><q>'Hm! Here we are!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard, breaking his long silence. <q>'I have brought you <name type="CARDINAL">about <name type="CARDINAL">seven</name>ty thousand</name> ent-st<name type="GPE">ri</name>des, but what that comes to in the measurement of your land I do not know. Anyhow we are near the roots of the Last <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>. Part of the name of this place might be <name type="ORG">Wellinghall</name>, if it were turned into your language. I like it. We will stay here to<name type="TIME">night</name>.'</q> He set them down on the grass between the aisles of the trees, and they followed him towards the great arch. The hobbits now noticed that as he walked his knees hardly bent, but his legs opened in a great st<name type="GPE">ri</name>de. He planted his big toes (and they were indeed big, and very broad) on the ground <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>, before any other part of his feet.</p>
<p>For a moment <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard stood under the rain of <name type="DATE">the fall</name>ing sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng, and took a deep breath; then he laughed, and passed inside. A great st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> table stood there, but no c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>rs. At the back of the bay it was already quite dark. <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard lifted <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> great vessels and stood them on the table. They seemed to be filled with water; but he held his hands over them, and immediately they began to glow, <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> with a golden and the other with a <name type="GPE">ri</name>ch green light; and the blending of the <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> lights lit the bay; as if the sun of <name type="DATE">summer</name> was shining through a roof of young leaves. <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>oking back, the hobbits saw that the trees in the court had also begun to glow, faintly at <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>, but steadily quickening, until every leaf was edged with light: some green, some gold, some red as copper; while the tree-trunks looked like pillars moulded out of luminous st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>.</p>
<p><q>'Well, well, now we can talk again,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard. <q>'You are thirsty I expect. Perhaps you are also tired. D<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk this!'</q> He went to the back of the bay, and then they saw that several tall st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> jars stood there, with heavy lids. He removed <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the lids, and dipped in a great ladle, and with it filled <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> bowls, <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> very large bowl, and <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> smaller <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s.</p>
<p><q>'This is an ent-house,'</q> he said, <q>'and there are no seats, I fear. But you may sit on the table.'</q> Picking up the hobbits he set them on the great st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> slab, <name type="CARDINAL">six</name> feet above the ground, and there they sat dangling their legs, and d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nking in sips.</p>
<p>The d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk was like water, indeed very like the taste of the draughts they had drunk from the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>wash near, the borders of the forest, and yet there was some scent or savour in it which they could not desc<name type="GPE">ri</name>be: it was faint, but it reminded them of the smell of a distant wood borne from afar by a cool breeze at <name type="TIME">night</name>. The effect of the draught began at the toes, and rose steadily through every limb, b<name type="GPE">ri</name>nging refreshment and vigour as it coursed upwards, <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght to the tips of the <name type="PERSON">hai</name>r. Indeed the hobbits felt that the <name type="PERSON">hai</name>r on their heads was actually standing up, waving and curling and growing. As for <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard, he <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> laved his feet in the basin beyond the arch, and then he drained his bowl at <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> draught, <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> long, slow draught. The hobbits thought he would never stop.</p>
<p>At last he set the bowl down again. <q>'Ah � ah,'</q> he sighed. <q>'Hm, <name type="PERSON">hoom</name>, now we can talk easier. You can sit on the floor, and I will lie down; that will prevent this d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk from <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing to my head and sending me to sleep.'</q></p>
<p>On the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght side of the bay there was a great bed on low legs; not more than <name type="QUANTITY">a couple of feet</name> high, covered deep in d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed grass and <name type="PERSON">bracken</name>. <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard lowered himself slowly on to this (with only the slightest sign of bending at his middle), until he lay at full length, with his arms behind his head, looking up at the ceiling. upon which lights were flicke<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng, like the play of leaves in the sunshine. <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> sat beside him on pillows of grass.</p>
<p><q>'Now tell me your tale, and do not hurry!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard.</p>
<p>The hobbits began to tell him the story of their adventures ever since they left <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbiton. They followed no very clear order, for they interrupted <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> another continually, and <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> stopped the speaker, and went back to some earlier point, or jumped forward asking questions about later events. They said nothing whatever about the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>, and did not tell him why they set out or where they were going to; and he did not ask for any reasons.</p>
<p>He was immensely interested in everything: in the <name type="ORG">Black</name> <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s, in <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name>, and <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name>, in the Old <name type="ORG">Forest</name>, and <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> <name type="GPE">Bombadil</name>, in the <name type="ORG">Mines</name> of <name type="GPE">Mo<name type="GPE">ri</name>a</name>, and in <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>thl�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en and <name type="PERSON">Galad<name type="GPE">ri</name>el</name>. He made them desc<name type="GPE">ri</name>be the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> and its country over and over again. He said an odd thing at this point. <q>'You never see any, hm, any <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s round there do you?'</q> he asked. <q>'Well, not <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s, _<name type="ORG">Ent</name>wives_ I should really say.'</q></p>
<p><q>'_<name type="ORG">Ent</name>wives_?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q>'Are they like you at all?'</q></p>
<p><q>'Yes, hm, well no: I do not really know now,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard thoughtfully. <q>'But they would like your country, so I just wondered.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard was however especially interested in everything that concerned <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>; and most interested of all in <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>'s doings. The hobbits regretted very much that they knew so little about them: only a rather vague report by <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> of what <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> had told the <name type="ORG">Council</name>. But they were clear at any rate that <name type="PRODUCT">Ugl</name><name type="PRODUCT">�k</name> and his troop came from <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard, and spoke of <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> as their master.</p>
<p><q>'Hm, <name type="PERSON">hoom</name>!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard, when at last their story had wound and <name type="PERSON">wan</name>dered down to the battle of the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s and the <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>. <q>'Well, well! That is a bundle of news and no mistake. You have not told me all, no indeed, not by a long way. But I do not doubt that you are doing as <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> would wish. There is something very big going on, that I can see, and what it is maybe I shall learn in good time, or in bad time. By root and twig, but it is a strange business: up sprout a little folk that are not in the old lists, and behold the <name type="CARDINAL">Nine</name> forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s reappear to hunt them, and <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> takes them on a great journey, and <name type="PERSON">Galad<name type="GPE">ri</name>el</name> harbours them in <name type="ORG">Caras Galadhon</name>, and <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s pursue them down all the leagues of <name type="PERSON">Wilderland</name>: indeed they seem to be caught up in a great storm. I hope they weather it!'</q></p>
<p><q>'And what about yourself?'</q> asked <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>om, hm, I have not troubled about <name type="EVENT">the Great Wars</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard; <q>'they mostly concern <name type="ORG">Elves</name> and <name type="ORG">Men</name>. That is the business of <name type="ORG">Wizard</name>s: <name type="ORG">Wizard</name>s are always troubled about the future. I do not like worrying about the future. I am not altogether on anybody's _side_, because nobody is altogether on my _side_, if you understand me: nobody cares for the woods as I care for them, not even <name type="ORG">Elves</name> nowa<name type="DATE">day</name>s. Still, I take more kindly to <name type="ORG">Elves</name> than to others: it was the <name type="ORG">Elves</name> that cured us of dumbness <name type="DATE">long ago</name>, and that was a great gift that cannot be forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>, though our ways have parted since. And there are some things, of course, whose side I am altogether _not_ on; I am against them altogether: these � bur�rum' (he again made a deep rumble of disgust)'</q> � these <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s, and their masters.</p>
<p>'I used to be anxious when the shadow lay on <name type="GPE">Mirkwood</name>, but when it removed to <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>, I did not trouble for a while: <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> is a long way away. But it seems that the wind is setting <name type="LOC">East</name>, and the withe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng of all woods may be drawing near. There is naught that an old <name type="ORG">Ent</name> can do to hold back that storm: he must weather it or crack.</p>
<p><q>'But <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> now! <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> is a neighbour: I cannot overlook him. I must do something, I suppose. I have of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> wondered lately what I should do about <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Who is <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>?'</q> asked <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q>'Do you know anything about his history?'</q> <q>'<name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> is a <name type="ORG">Wizard</name>,'</q> answered <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard. 'More than that I cannot say. I do not know the history of <name type="ORG">Wizard</name>s. They appeared <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> after <name type="ORG">the Great Ships</name> came over the <name type="LOC">Sea</name>; but if they came with the Ships I never can tell. <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> was reck<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>d great among them, I believe. He gave up <name type="PERSON">wan</name>de<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng about and minding the affairs of <name type="ORG">Men</name> and <name type="ORG">Elves</name>, some time ago � you would call it a very long time ago: and he settled down at <name type="ORG">Angrenost</name>, or <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard as the <name type="ORG">Men</name> of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> call it. He was very quiet to begin with, but his fame began to grow. He was chosen to be head of the White <name type="ORG">Council</name>, they say; but that did not turn out too well. I wonder now if even then <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> was not turning to evil ways. But at any rate he used to give no trouble to his neighbours. I used to talk to him. There was a time when he was always walking about my woods. He was polite in those <name type="DATE">day</name>s, always asking my leave (at least when he met me); and always eager to lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>. I told him many things that he would never have found out by himself; but he never repaid me in like kind. I cannot remember that he ever told. me anything. And he got more and more like that; his face, as I remember it � I have not seen it for many <name type="DATE">a <name type="DATE">day</name></name> � became like windows in a st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> wall: windows with shutters inside.</p>
<p><q>'I think that I now understand what he is <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name>. He is plotting to become a <name type="ORG">Power</name>. He has a mind of metal and wheels; and he does not care for growing things, except as far as they serve him for the moment. And now it is clear that he is a black traitor. He has taken up with foul folk, with the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s. Brm, <name type="PERSON">hoom</name>! Worse than that: he has been doing something to them; something dangerous. For these <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>garders are more like wicked <name type="ORG">Men</name>. It is a <name type="PERSON">mar</name>k of evil things that came in the Great <name type="PRODUCT">Darkness</name> that they cannot abide the <name type="ORG">Sun</name>; but <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>'s <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s can endure it, even if they hate it. I wonder what he has <name type="PERSON">don</name>e? Are they <name type="ORG">Men</name> he has ruined, or has he blended the races of <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s and <name type="ORG">Men</name>? That would be a black evil!'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard rumbled for a moment, as if he were pronouncing some deep, subterranean <name type="ORG">Ent</name>ish malediction. <q>'Some time ago I began to wonder how <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s dared to pass through my woods so freely,'</q> he went on. 'Only lately did I guess that <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> was to blame, and that <name type="DATE">long ago</name> he had been spying out all the ways, and discove<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng my <name type="ORG">sec</name>rets. He and his foul folk are making havoc now. Down on the borders they are felling trees-good trees. Some of the trees they just cut down and leave to rot � orc-mischief that; but most are hewn up and car<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed off to feed the fires of <name type="PERSON">Orthanc</name>. There is always a smoke <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing from <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard these <name type="DATE">day</name>s.</p>
<p><q>'Curse him, root and branch! Many of those trees were my f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends creatures I had known from nut and acorn; many had voices of their own that are lost for ever now. And there are wastes of stump and bramble where once there were singing groves. I have been idle. I have let things slip. It must stop!'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard raised himself from his bed with a jerk, stood up, and thumped his hand on the table. The vessels of light trembled and sent up <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> jets of flame. There was a flicker like green fire in his eyes, and his beard stood out stiff as a great besom.</p>
<p><q>'I will stop it!'</q> he boomed. <q>'And you shall come with me. You may be able to help me. You will be helping your own f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends that way, too; for if <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> is not checked <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> and <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> will have an enemy behind as well as in front. Our roads go together � to <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard!'</q></p>
<p><q>'We will come with you,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'We will do what we can.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Yes!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q>'I should like to see the <name type="ORG">White Hand</name> overthrown. I should like to be there, even if I could not be of much use: I shall never forget <name type="PRODUCT">Ugl</name><name type="PRODUCT">�k</name> and the crossing of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Good! Good!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard. <q>'But I spoke hastily. We must not be hasty. I have become too hot. I must cool myself and think; for it is easier to shout _stop_! than to do it.'</q></p>
<p>He strode to the archway and stood for some time under <name type="DATE">the fall</name>ing rain of the sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng. Then he laughed and shook himself, and wherever the drops of water fell glitte<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng from him to the ground they glinted like red and green sparks. He came back and laid himself on the bed again and was silent.</p>
<p>After some time the hobbits heard him murmu<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng again. He seemed to be counting on his fingers. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Fangorn</name>, <name type="PERSON">Finglas</name>, <name type="ORG">Flad<name type="GPE">ri</name>f</name>, aye, aye,'</q> he sighed. <q>'The trouble is that there are so few of us left,'</q> he said turning towards the hobbits. <q>'<name type="CARDINAL">Only <name type="CARDINAL">three</name></name> remain of the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s that walked in the woods before the <name type="PRODUCT">Darkness</name>: only myself, <name type="PERSON">Fangorn</name>, and <name type="PERSON">Finglas</name> and <name type="ORG">Flad<name type="GPE">ri</name>f</name> � to give them their <name type="PERSON">Elvish</name> names; you may call them <name type="ORG">Leaflock</name> and <name type="ORG">Skinbark</name> if you like that better. And of us <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> <name type="ORG">Leaflock</name> and <name type="ORG">Skinbark</name> are not much use for this business. <name type="ORG">Leaflock</name> has grown sleepy, almost tree-ish, you might say: he has taken to standing by himself <name type="CARDINAL">half</name>-asleep all through the <name type="DATE">summer</name> with the deep grass of the meadows round his knees. Covered with leafy <name type="PERSON">hai</name>r he is. He used to rouse up in <name type="DATE">winter</name>; but of late he has been too drowsy to walk far even then. <name type="ORG">Skinbark</name> lived on the mountain-slopes west of <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard. That is where the worst trouble has been. He was wounded by the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s, and many of his folk and his tree<name type="PERSON">-he</name>rds have been murdered and destroyed. He has g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> up into the high places, among the birches that he loves best, and he will not come down. Still, I daresay I could get together a fair company of our younger folks � if I could make them understand the need: if I could rouse them: we are not a hasty folk. What a pity there are so few of us!'</q></p>
<p><q>'Why are there so few when you have lived in this country so long?'</q> asked <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q>'Have a great many died?'</q></p>
<p><q>'Oh, no!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard. <q>'N<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> have died from inside, as you might say. Some have fallen in the evil chances of the <name type="DATE">long <name type="DATE">year</name>s</name>, of course: and more have grown tree-ish. But there were never many of us and we have not increased. There have been no <name type="ORG">Ent</name>ings � no children, you would say, not for a ter<name type="GPE">ri</name>ble long count of <name type="DATE">year</name>s. You see, we lost the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>wives.'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w very sad!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w was it that they all died?'</q></p>
<p><q>'They did not _die_!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard. <q>'I never said _died_. We lost them, I said. We lost them and we cannot find them.'</q> He sighed. <q>'I thought most folk knew that. There were songs about the hunt of the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s for the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>wives sung among <name type="ORG">Elves</name> and <name type="ORG">Men</name> from <name type="GPE">Mirkwood</name> to <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>. They cannot be quite forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Well, I am afraid the songs have not come west over the <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s to the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'Won't you tell us some more, or sing us <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the songs?'</q></p>
<p><q>'Yes, I will indeed,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard, seeming pleased with the request. <q>'But I cannot tell it properly, only in short; and then we must end our talk: to<name type="DATE">morrow</name> we have councils to call, and work to do, and maybe a journey to begin.'</q></p>
<p><q>'It is rather a strange and sad story,'</q> he went on after a pause. 'When the world was young, and the woods were wide and wild, the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s and the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>wives � and there were <name type="ORG">Ent</name>maidens then: ah! the loveliness of <name type="PERSON">Fimbrethil</name>, of <name type="ORG">Wandlimb</name> the lightfooted, in the <name type="DATE">day</name>s of our youth! � they walked together and they housed together. But our hearts did not go on growing in the same way: the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s gave their love to things that they met in the world, and the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>wives gave their thought to other things, for the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s loved the great trees; and the wild woods, and the slopes of the high hills; and they drank of the mountain-streams, and ate only such fruit as the trees let fall in their path; and they learned of the <name type="ORG">Elves</name> and spoke with the <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>s. But the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>wives gave their minds to the lesser trees, and to the meads in the sunshine beyond the feet of the forests; and they saw the <name type="ORG">sloe</name> in the thicket, and the wild apple and the cherry blossoming in sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng, and the green herbs in the <name type="PERSON">waterlands</name> in <name type="DATE">summer</name>, and the seeding grasses in the <name type="DATE">autumn</name> fields. They did not desire to speak with these things; but they wished them to hear and obey what was said to them. The <name type="ORG">Ent</name>wives ordered them to grow according to their wishes, and bear leaf and fruit to their liking; for the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>wives desired order, and plenty, and peace (by which they meant that things should remain where they had set them). So the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>wives made gardens to live in. But we <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s went on <name type="PERSON">wan</name>de<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng, and we only came to the gardens now and again. Then when the <name type="PRODUCT">Darkness</name> came in the <name type="LOC">North</name>, the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>wives crossed the <name type="LOC">Great <name type="LOC">River</name></name>, and made new gardens, and tilled new fields, and we saw them more seldom. After the <name type="PRODUCT">Darkness</name> was overthrown the land of the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>wives blossomed <name type="GPE">ri</name>chly, and their fields were full of corn. Many men learned the crafts of the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>wives and honoured them greatly; but we were only a legend to them, a <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret in the heart of the forest. Yet here we still are, while all the gardens of the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>wives are wasted: <name type="ORG">Men</name> call them the <name type="PERSON">Brown</name> Lands now.</p>
<p>'I remember it was <name type="DATE">long ago</name> � in the time of the war between <name type="ORG">Sauron</name> and the <name type="ORG">Men</name> of the <name type="LOC">Sea</name> � desire came over me to see <name type="PERSON">Fimbrethil</name> again. Very fair she was still in my eyes, when I had last seen her, though little like the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>maiden of old. For the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>wives were bent and browned by their labour; their <name type="PERSON">hai</name>r parched by the sun to the hue of <name type="GPE">ri</name>pe corn and their cheeks like red apples. Yet their eyes were still the eyes of our own people. We crossed over <name type="GPE">Anduin</name> and came to their land: but we found a desert: it was all burned and uprooted, for war had passed over it. But the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>wives were not there. <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ng we called, and long we searched; and we asked all folk that we met which way the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>wives had g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. Some said they had never seen them; and some said that they had seen them walking away west, and some said east, and others south. But nowhere that we went could we find them. Our sorrow was very great. Yet the wild wood called, and we returned to it. For <name type="DATE">many <name type="DATE">year</name>s</name> we used to go out every now and again and look for the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>wives, walking far and wide and calling them by their beautiful names. But as time passed we went more seldom and <name type="PERSON">wan</name>dered less far. And now the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>wives are only a memory for us, and our beards are long and grey. The <name type="ORG">Elves</name> made many songs concerning the <name type="LOC">Sea</name>rch of the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s, and some of the songs passed into the tongues of <name type="ORG">Men</name>. But we made no songs about it, being con<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>t to chant their beautiful names when we thought of the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>wives. We believe that we may meet again in a time to come, and perhaps we shall find somewhere a land where we can live together and both be con<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>t. But it is <name type="PERSON">forebode</name>d that that will only be when we have both lost all that we now have. And it may well be that that time is drawing near at last. For if <name type="ORG">Sauron</name> of old destroyed the gardens, the Enemy to<name type="DATE">day</name> seems likely to wither all the woods.</p>
<p>'There was an <name type="PERSON">Elvish</name> song that spoke of this, or at least so I understand it. It used to be sung up and down the <name type="LOC">Great <name type="LOC">River</name></name>. It was never an <name type="ORG">Ent</name>ish song, <name type="PERSON">mar</name>k you: it would have been a very long song in <name type="ORG">Ent</name>ish! But we know it by heart, and hum it now and again. This is how it runs in your tongue:</p>
<p>ENT.        _When <name type="DATE">Sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng</name> unfolds the beechen leaf, and sap is in the bough;</p>
<p>When light is on the wild-wood stream, and wind is on the brow;</p>

<p>When shower and <name type="ORG">Sun</name> upon the <name type="LOC">Earth</name> with fragrance fill the air,</p>
<p>I'll linger here, and will not come, because my land is fair._</p>
<p>ENT.        _When <name type="EVENT">Summer</name> lies upon the world, and in <name type="TIME">a <name type="TIME">noon</name></name> of gold</p>

<p>I'll linger here beneath the <name type="ORG">Sun</name>, because my land is best!_</p>
<p>ENT.        _When <name type="DATE">Winter</name> comes, <name type="DATE">the <name type="DATE">winter</name></name> wild that hill and wood shall slay;</p>

<p>ENTWIFE. _When <name type="DATE">Winter</name> comes, and singing ends; when darkness falls at last;</p>
<p>When broken is the barren bough, and light and labour past;</p>
<p>I'll look for thee, and wait for thee, until we meet again:</p>
<p>Together we will take the road beneath the bitter rain!_</p>
<p>BOTH.     _Together we will take the road that leads into the <name type="LOC">West</name>,</p>
<p>And far away will find a land where both our hearts may rest.'_</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard ended his song. <q>'That is how it goes,'</q> he said. <q>'It is <name type="PERSON">Elvish</name>, of course: lighthearted, quickworded, and soon over. I daresay it is fair enough. But the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s could say more on their side, if they had time! But now I am going to stand up and take a little sleep. Where will you stand?'</q></p>
<p><q>'We usually lie down to sleep,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'We shall be all <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght where we are.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Lie down to sleep!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard. <q>'Why of course you do! Hm, <name type="PERSON">hoom</name>: I was forgetting: singing that song put me in mind of old times; almost thought that I was talking to young <name type="ORG">Ent</name>ings, I did. Well, you can lie on the bed. I am going to stand in the rain. <name type="TIME">Good <name type="TIME">night</name></name>!'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Merry</name> and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> climbed on to the bed and curled up in the soft grass and fern. It was fresh, and sweet-scented, and warm. The lights died down, and the glow of the trees faded; but outside under the arch they could see old <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard standing, motionless, with his arms raised above his head. The b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght stars peered out of the sky, and lit <name type="DATE">the fall</name>ing water as it spilled on to his fingers and head, and d<name type="GPE">ri</name>pped, d<name type="GPE">ri</name>pped, in <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name>s of silver drops on to his feet. Lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing to the tinkling of the drops the hobbits fell asleep.</p>
<p>They woke to find a cool sun shining into the great court, and on to the floor of the bay. Shreds of high cloud were overhead, running on a stiff easterly wind. <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard was not to be seen; but while <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> were bathing in the basin by the arch, they heard him humming and singing, as he came up the path between the trees.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>o, ho! Good <name type="TIME">morning</name>, <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>!'</q> he boomed, when he saw them. <q>'You sleep long. I have been many <name type="CARDINAL">a <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name></name> st<name type="GPE">ri</name>des already to<name type="DATE">day</name>. Now we will have a d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk, and go to <name type="ORG">Ent</name>moot.'</q></p>
<p>He poured them out <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> full bowls from a st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> jar; but from a different jar. The taste was not the same as it had been the <name type="TIME">night</name> before: it was <name type="LOC">earth</name>ier and <name type="GPE">ri</name>cher, more sustaining and food-like, so to speak. While the hobbits drank, sitting on the edge of the bed, and nibbling small pieces of elf-cake (more because they felt that eating was a necessary part of breakfast than because they felt hungry), <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard stood, humming in <name type="ORG">Ent</name>ish or <name type="PERSON">Elvish</name> or some strange tongue, and looking up at the sky.</p>
<p><q>'Where is <name type="ORG">Ent</name>moot?'</q> <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> ventured to ask.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>o, eh? <name type="ORG">Ent</name>moot?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard, turning round. <q>'It is not a place, it is a gathe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng of <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s � which does not of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> happen nowa<name type="DATE">day</name>s. But I have managed to make a fair number promise to come. We shall meet in the place where we have always met: <name type="PRODUCT">Derndingle</name> <name type="ORG">Men</name> call it. It is away south from here. We must be there before <name type="TIME">noon</name>.'</q></p>
<p>Before long they set off. <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard car<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed the hobbits in his arms as on the previous <name type="DATE">day</name>. At the entrance to the court he turned to the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght, stepped over the stream, and strode away southwards along the feet of great tumbled slopes where trees were scanty. Above these the hobbits saw thickets of birch and <name type="PERSON">ro<name type="PERSON">wan</name></name>, and beyond them dark climbing pinewoods. Soon <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard turned a little away from the hills and plunged into deep groves, where the trees were larger, taller, and thicker than any that the hobbits had ever seen before. For a while they felt faintly the sense of stifling which they had noticed when they <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> ventured into <name type="PERSON">Fangorn</name>, but it soon passed. <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard did not talk to them. He hummed to himself deeply and thoughtfully, but <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> caught no proper words: it sounded like _boom, boom, rumboom, boorar, boom, boom, <name type="ORG">dahrar boom boom</name>, dahrar boom_, and so on with a constant change of note and rhythm. Now and again they thought they heard an answer, a hum or a quiver of sound, that seemed to come out of the <name type="LOC">earth</name>, or from boughs above their heads, or perhaps from the boles of the trees; but <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard did not stop or turn his head to either side.</p>
<p>They had been going for a long while � <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> had t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed to keep count of the 'ent-st<name type="GPE">ri</name>des' but had failed, getting lost at <name type="CARDINAL">about <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> thousand</name> � when <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard began to slacken his pace. Suddenly he stopped, put the hobbits down, and raised his curled hands to his mouth so that they made a hollow tube; then he blew or called through them. A great <name type="PERSON">_<name type="PERSON">hoom</name></name>, hom_ rang out like a deep-throated horn in the woods, and seemed to echo from the trees. <name type="LOC">Far</name> off there came from several directions a similar <name type="PERSON">_<name type="PERSON">hoom</name></name>, hom, <name type="PERSON">hoom</name>_ that was not an echo but an answer.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard now perched <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> on his shoulders and strode on again, every now and then sending out another horn-call, and each time the answers came louder and nearer. In this way they came at last to what looked like an impenetrable wall of dark evergreen trees, trees of a kind that the hobbits had never seen before: they branched out <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght from the roots, and were densely clad in dark glossy leaves like thornless holly, and they bore many stiff up<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght flower-spikes with large shining olive-coloured buds.</p>
<p>Turning to the left and skirting this huge hedge <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard came in a few st<name type="GPE">ri</name>des to a narrow entrance. <name type="PERSON">Thr</name>ough it a worn path passed and dived suddenly down a long steep slope. The hobbits saw that they were descending into a great dingle, almost as round as a bowl, very wide and deep, crowned at the <name type="GPE">ri</name>m with the high dark evergreen hedge. It was smooth and grassclad inside, and there were no trees except <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> very tall and beautiful silver-birches that stood at the bot<name type="PERSON">tom</name> of the bowl. <name type="CARDINAL">Two</name> other paths led down into the dingle: from the west and from the east.</p>
<p>Several <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s had already ar<name type="GPE">ri</name>ved. More were coming in down the other paths, and some were now following <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard. As they drew near the hobbits gazed at them. They had expected to see a number of creatures as much like <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard as <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> hobbit is like another (at any rate to a stranger's eye); and they were very much surp<name type="GPE">ri</name>sed to see nothing of the kind. The <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s were as different from <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> another as trees from trees: some as different as <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> tree is from another of the same name but quite different growth and history; and some as different as <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> tree-kind from another, as birch from beech; oak from fir. There were a few older <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s, bearded and gnarled like hale but ancient trees (though n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> looked as ancient as <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard); and there were tall strong <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s, clean-limbed and smooth-skinned like forest-trees in their p<name type="GPE">ri</name>me; but there were no young <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s, no saplings. Altogether there were <name type="CARDINAL">about <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> <name type="CARDINAL">dozen</name></name> standing on the wide grassy floor of the dingle, and as many more were <name type="PERSON">mar</name><name type="PERSON">chin</name>g in.</p>
<p>At <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> were struck chiefly by the va<name type="GPE">ri</name>ety that they saw: the many shapes, and colours, the differences in girth; and h<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name>, and length of leg and arm; and in the number of toes and fingers (anything from <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> to <name type="CARDINAL">nine</name>). A few seemed more or less related to <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard, and reminded them of beech-trees or oaks. But there were other kinds. Some recalled the chestnut: brown-skinned <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s with large splayfingered hands, and short thick legs. Some recalled the ash: tall straight grey <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s with many-fingered hands and long legs; some the fir (the tallest <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s), and others the birch, the <name type="PERSON">ro<name type="PERSON">wan</name></name>, and the linden. But when the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s all gathered round <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard, bowing their heads slightly, murmu<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng in their slow musical voices, and looking long and in<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>tly at the strangers, then the hobbits saw that they were all of the same kindred, and all had the same eyes: not all so old or so deep as <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard's, but all with the same slow, steady, thoughtful expression, and the same green flicker.</p>
<p>As soon as the whole company was assembled, standing in a wide circle round <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard, a cu<name type="GPE">ri</name>ous and unintelligible conversation began. The <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s began to murmur slowly: <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> joined and then another, until they were all chanting together in a long <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing and falling rhythm, now louder on <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> side of the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng, now dying away there and <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing to a great boom on the other side. Though he could not catch or understand any of the words � he supposed the language was <name type="ORG">Ent</name>ish � <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> found the sound very pleasant to lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> to at <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>; but gradually his at<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>tion wavered. After a long time (and the chant showed no signs of slackening) he found himself wonde<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng, since <name type="ORG">Ent</name>ish was such an <q>'unhasty' language, whether they had yet got further than _Good <name type="TIME">Morning</name>_; and if <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard was to call the roll, how m<name type="DATE">any <name type="DATE">day</name></name>s it would take to sing all their names. 'I wonder what the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>ish is for _yes_ or _no_,'</q> he thought. He yawned.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard was immediately aware of him. <q>'_Hm, ha, hey_, my <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>!'</q> he said, and the other <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s all stopped their chant. <q>'You are a hasty folk, I was forgetting; and anyway it is wea<name type="GPE">ri</name>some lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing to a speech you do not understand. You may get down now. I have told your names to the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>moot, and they have seen you, and they have agreed that you are not <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s, and that a new line shall be put in the old lists. We have got no further yet, but that is quick work for an <name type="ORG">Ent</name>moot. You and <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> can stroll about in the dingle, if you like. There is a well of good water, if you need refreshing, away yonder in <name type="GPE">the north bank</name>. There are still some words to speak before the Moot really begins. I will come and see you again, and tell you how things are going.'</q></p>
<p>He put the hobbits down. Before they walked away, they bowed low. This feat seemed to amuse the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s very much, to judge by the t<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of their murmurs, and the flicker of their eyes; but they soon turned back to their own business. <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> climbed up the path that came in from the west, and looked through the opening in the great hedge. <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ng tree-clad slopes rose from the lip of the dingle, and away beyond them, above the fir-trees of the furthest <name type="GPE">ri</name>dge there rose, sharp and white, the peak of a high mountain. <name type="LOC">South</name>wards to their left they could see the forest falling away down into the grey distance. There far away there was a pale green glimmer that <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> guessed to be a glimpse of the plains of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>.</p>
<p><q>'I wonder where <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard is?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>.</p>
<p><q>'I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t know quite where we are,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>; <q>'but that peak is probably <name type="PERSON">Methedras</name>, and as far as I can remember the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng of <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard lies in a fork or deep cleft at the end of the mountains. It is probably down behind this great <name type="GPE">ri</name>dge. There seems to be a smoke or haze over there, left of the peak, <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t you think?'</q></p>
<p><q>'What is <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard like?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q>'I wonder what <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s can do about it anyway.'</q></p>
<p><q>'So do I,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard is a sort of <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng of rocks or hills, I think, with a flat space inside and an island or pillar of rock in the middle, called <name type="PERSON">Orthanc</name>. <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> has a tower on it. There is a gate, perhaps <name type="CARDINAL">more than <name type="CARDINAL">one</name></name>, in the encircling wall, and I believe there is a stream running through it; it comes out of the mountains, and flows on across the <name type="ORG">Gap</name> of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>. It does not seem the sort of place for <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s to tackle. But I have an odd feeling about these <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s: somehow I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t think they are quite as safe and, well funny as they seem. They seem slow, queer, and patient, almost sad; and yet I believe they _could_ be roused. If that happened, I would rather not be on the other side.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Yes!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q>'I know what you mean. There might be all the difference between an old cow sitting and thoughtfully chewing, and a bull charging; and the change might come suddenly. I wonder if <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard will rouse them. I am sure he means to try. But they <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t like being roused. <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard got roused himself <name type="TIME">last <name type="TIME">night</name></name>, and then bottled it up again.'</q></p>
<p>The hobbits turned back. The voices of the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s were still <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing and falling in their conclave. The sun had now <name type="GPE">ri</name>sen high enough to look over the high hedge: it gleamed on the tops of the birches and lit the northward side of the dingle with a cool yellow light. There they saw a little glitte<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng fountain. They walked along the <name type="GPE">ri</name>m of the great bowl at the feet of the evergreens-it was pleasant to feel cool grass about their toes again, and not to be in a hurry-and then they climbed down to the gushing water. They drank a little, a clean, cold, sharp draught, and sat down on a mossy st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, wat<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g the patches of sun on the grass and the shadows of the sailing clouds passing over the floor of the dingle. The murmur of the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s went on. It seemed a very strange and remote place, outside their world, and far from everything that had ever happened to them. A great longing came over them for the faces and voices of their companions, especially for <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, and for <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>.</p>
<p>At last there came a pause in the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>-voices; and looking up they saw <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard coming towards them. with another <name type="ORG">Ent</name> at his side.</p>
<p><q>'Hm, <name type="PERSON">hoom</name>, here I am again,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard. <q>'Are you getting weary, or feeling impatient, hmm, eh? Well, I am afraid that you must not get impatient yet. We have finished the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> stage now; but I have still got to explain things again to those that live a long way off, far from <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard, and those that I could not get round to before the Moot, and after that we shall have to decide what to do. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>wever, deciding what to do does not take <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s so long as going over all the facts and events that they have to make up their minds about. Still, it is no use denying, we shall be here a long time yet: <name type="DATE">a couple of <name type="DATE">day</name>s</name> very likely. So I have brought you a companion. He has an ent-house nearby. <name type="PERSON">Bregalad</name> is his <name type="PERSON">Elvish</name> name. He says he has already made up his mind and does not need to remain at the Moot. Hm, hm, he is the nearest thing among us to a hasty <name type="ORG">Ent</name>. You ought to get on together. Good-bye!'</q> <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard turned and left them.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Bregalad</name> stood for some time surveying the hobbits solemnly; and they looked at him, wonde<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng when he would show any signs of 'hastiness'. He was tall, and seemed to be <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the younger <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s; he had smooth shining skin on his arms and legs; his lips were ruddy, and his <name type="PERSON">hai</name>r was grey-green. He could bend and sway like a slender tree in the wind. At last he spoke, and his voice though resonant was higher and clearer than <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard's.</p>
<p><q>'Ha, hmm, my f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends, let us go for a walk!'</q> he said. <q>'I am <name type="PERSON">Bregalad</name>, that is <name type="GPE">Quickbeam</name> in your language. But it is only a <name type="GPE">nick</name>name, of course. They have called me that ever since I said _yes_ to an elder <name type="ORG">Ent</name> before he had finished his question. Also I d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk quickly, and go out while some are still wetting their beards. Come with me!'</q></p>
<p>He reached down <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> shapely arms and gave a long-fingered hand to each of the hobbits. All that <name type="DATE">day</name> they walked about in the woods with him, singing, and laughing; for <name type="GPE">Quickbeam</name> of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> laughed. He laughed if the sun came out from behind a cloud, he laughed if they came upon a stream or sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng: then he stooped and splashed his feet and head with water; he laughed sometimes at some sound or whisper in the trees. Whenever he saw a <name type="PERSON">ro<name type="PERSON">wan</name></name>-tree he halted a while with his arms stretched out, and sang, and swayed as he sang.</p>
<p>At <name type="TIME">night</name>fall he brought them to his ent-house: nothing more than a mossy st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> set upon turves under a green bank. <name type="PERSON">Ro<name type="PERSON">wan</name>-trees</name> grew in a circle about it, and there was water (as in all ent-houses), a sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng bubbling out from the bank. They talked for a while as darkness fell on the forest. Not far away the voices of the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>moot could be heard still going on; but now they seemed deeper and less leisurely, and every now and again <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> great voice would <name type="GPE">ri</name>se in a high and quickening music, while all the others died away. But beside them <name type="PERSON">Bregalad</name> spoke gently in their own tongue, almost whispe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng; and they learned that he belonged to <name type="ORG">Skinbark</name>'s people, and the country where they had lived had been ravaged. That seemed to the hobbits quite enough to explain his 'hastiness', at least in the matter of <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s.</p>
<p><q>'There were <name type="PERSON">ro<name type="PERSON">wan</name></name>-trees in my home,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Bregalad</name>, softly and sadly, '<name type="PERSON">ro<name type="PERSON">wan</name></name>-trees that took root when I was an <name type="ORG">Ent</name>ing, many <name type="DATE">many <name type="DATE">year</name>s</name> ago in the quiet of the world. The oldest were planted by the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s to try and please the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>wives; but they looked at them and smiled and said that they knew where whiter blossom and <name type="GPE">ri</name>cher fruit were growing. Yet there are no trees of all that race, the people of the <name type="PERSON">Rose</name>, that are so beautiful to me. And these trees grew and grew, till the shadow of each was like a green hall, and their red ber<name type="GPE">ri</name>es in the <name type="DATE">autumn</name> were a burden, and a beauty and a wonder. Birds used to flock there. I like birds, even when they chatter; and the <name type="PERSON">ro<name type="PERSON">wan</name></name> has enough and to spare. But the birds became unf<name type="GPE">ri</name>endly and greedy and tore at the trees, and threw the fruit down and did not eat it. Then <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s came with axes and cut down my trees. I came and called them by their long names, but they did not quiver, they did not hear or answer: they lay dead.</p>
<p>O <name type="PERSON">Orofarn�</name>, <name type="ORG">Lassemista</name>, <name type="PERSON">Carnim</name>�<name type="GPE">ri</name>�!</p>
<p>O <name type="PERSON">ro<name type="PERSON">wan</name></name> fair, upon your <name type="PERSON">hai</name>r how white the blossom lay!</p>
<p>O <name type="PERSON">ro<name type="PERSON">wan</name></name> mine, I saw you shine upon a <name type="DATE">summer</name>'s <name type="DATE">day</name>,</p>
<p>Your <name type="GPE">ri</name>nd so b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght, your leaves so light, your voice so cool and soft:</p>
<p>Upon your head how golden-red the crown you bore aloft!</p>
<p>O <name type="PERSON">ro<name type="PERSON">wan</name></name> dead, upon your head your <name type="PERSON">hai</name>r is dry and grey;</p>
<p>Your crown is spilled, your voice is stilled for ever and <name type="DATE">a <name type="DATE">day</name></name>.</p>
<p>O <name type="PERSON">Orofarn�</name>, <name type="ORG">Lassemista</name>, <name type="PERSON">Carnim</name>�<name type="GPE">ri</name>�!</p>
<p>The hobbits fell asleep to the sound of the soft singing of <name type="PERSON">Bregalad</name>, that seemed to lament in many tongues <name type="DATE">the fall</name> of trees that he had loved.</p>
<p><name type="DATE">The next <name type="DATE">day</name></name> they spent also in his company, but they did not go far from his 'house'. Most of the time they sat silent under the shelter of the bank; for the wind was colder, and the clouds closer and greyer; there was little sunshine, and in the distance the voices of the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s at the Moot still rose and fell, sometimes loud and strong, sometimes low and sad, sometimes quickening, sometimes slow and solemn as a dirge. <name type="TIME">A <name type="ORG">sec</name>ond <name type="TIME">night</name></name> came and still the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s held conclave under hurrying clouds and fitful stars.</p>
<p><name type="DATE">The <name type="ORDINAL">third</name> <name type="DATE">day</name></name> broke, bleak and windy. At sun<name type="GPE">ri</name>se the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s' voices rose to a great clamour and then died down again. As the <name type="TIME">morning</name> wore on the wind fell and the air grew heavy with expectancy. The hobbits could see that <name type="PERSON">Bregalad</name> was now lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing in<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>tly, although to them, down in the <name type="ORG">dell</name> of his ent-house, the sound of the Moot was faint.</p>
<p><name type="TIME">The <name type="TIME">after<name type="TIME">noon</name></name></name> came, and the sun, going west towards the mountains, sent out long yellow beams between the cracks and fissures of the clouds. Suddenly they were aware that everything was very quiet; the whole forest stood in lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing silence. Of course, the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>-voices had stopped. What did that mean? <name type="PERSON">Bregalad</name> was standing up erect and <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>se, looking back northwards towards <name type="PRODUCT">Derndingle</name>.</p>
<p>Then with a crash came a great <name type="GPE">ri</name>nging shout: _ra-<name type="PERSON">hoom</name>-rah!_ The trees quivered and bent as if a gust had struck them. There was another pause, and then a <name type="PERSON">mar</name><name type="PERSON">chin</name>g music began like solemn drums, and above the rolling beats and booms there welled voices singing high and strong.</p>
<p>We come, we come with roll of drum: ta-<name type="PERSON">runda runda</name> runda rom!</p>
<p>The <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s were coming: ever nearer and louder rose their song:</p>
<p>We come, we come with horn and drum: ta-r�na r�na r�na rom!_</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Bregalad</name> picked up the hobbits and strode from his house.</p>
<p>Before long they saw the <name type="PERSON">mar</name><name type="PERSON">chin</name>g line approa<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g: the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s were swinging along with great st<name type="GPE">ri</name>des down the slope towards them. <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard was at their head, and some <name type="CARDINAL">fifty</name> followers were behind him, <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> abreast, keeping step with their feet and beating time with their hands upon their flanks. As they drew near the flash and flicker of their eyes could be seen.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>om, hom! Here we come with a boom, here we come at last!'</q> called <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard when he caught sight of <name type="PERSON">Bregalad</name> and the hobbits. <q>'Come, join the Moot! We are off. We are off to <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard!'</q></p>
<p><q>'To <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard!'</q> the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed in many voices.</p>
<p><q>'To <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard!'</q></p>
<p>To <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard! Though <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard be <name type="GPE">ri</name>nged and barred with doors of st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>;</p>
<p>Though <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard be strong and hard, as cold as st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> and bare as b<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>,</p>
<p>We go, we go, we go to war, to hew the st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> and break the door;</p>
<p>For bole and bough are burning now, the furnace roars � we go to war!</p>
<p>To land of gloom with tramp of doom, with roll of drum, we come, we come;</p>
<p>To <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard with doom we come!</p>
<p>With doom we come, with doom we come!</p>
<p>So they sang as they <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ched southwards.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Bregalad</name>, his eyes shining, swung into the line beside <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard. The old <name type="ORG">Ent</name> now took the hobbits back, and set them on his shoulders again, and so they rode proudly at the head of the singing company with beating hearts and heads held high. Though they had expected something to happen eventually, they were amazed at the change that had come over the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s. It seemed now as sudden as the bursting of a flood that had long been held back by a dike.</p>
<p><q>'The <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s made up their minds rather quickly, after all, didn't they?'</q> <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> ventured to say after some time, when for a moment the singing paused, and only the beating of hands and feet was heard.</p>
<p><q>'Quickly?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>om! Yes, indeed. Quicker than I expected. Indeed I have not seen them roused like this for many an age. We <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s do not like being roused; and we never are roused unless it is clear to us that our trees and our lives are in great danger. That has not happened in this <name type="ORG">Forest</name> since the wars of <name type="ORG">Sauron</name> and the <name type="ORG">Men</name> of the <name type="LOC">Sea</name>. It is the orc-work, the <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ton hewing � _r�rum_ � without even the bad excuse of feeding the fires, that has so angered us; and the treachery of a neighbour, who should have helped us. <name type="ORG">Wizard</name>s ought to know better: they do know better. There is no curse in <name type="PERSON">Elvish</name>, <name type="ORG">Ent</name>ish, or the tongues of <name type="ORG">Men</name> bad enough for such treachery. Down with <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>!'</q></p>
<p><q>'Will you really break the doors of <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard?'</q> asked <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>, hm, well, we could, you know! You do not know, perhaps, how strong we are. <name type="DATE">May</name>be you have heard of <name type="ORG">Troll</name>s? They are mighty strong. But <name type="ORG">Troll</name>s are only counterfeits, made by the Enemy in the Great <name type="PRODUCT">Darkness</name>, in mockery of <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s, as <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s were of <name type="ORG">Elves</name>. We are stronger than <name type="ORG">Troll</name>s. We are made of the b<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s of the <name type="LOC">earth</name>. We can split st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> like the roots of trees, only quicker, far quicker, if our minds are roused! If we are not hewn down, or destroyed by fire or blast of sorcery, we could split <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard into splinters and crack its walls into rubble.'</q></p>
<p><q>'But <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> will try to stop you. won't he?'</q></p>
<p><q>'Hm, ah, yes, that is so. I have not forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> it. Indeed I have thought long about it. But, you see, many of the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s are younger than I am, by many lives of trees. They are all roused now, and their mind is all on <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> thing: breaking <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard. But they will start thinking again before long; they will cool down a little, when we take our <name type="TIME">evening</name> d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk. What a thirst we shall have! But let them <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ch now and sing! We have a long way to go, and there is time ahead for thought. It is something to have started.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ched on, singing with the others for a while. But after a time his voice died to a murmur and fell silent again. <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> could see that his old brow was w<name type="GPE">ri</name>nkled and knotted. At last he looked up, and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> could see a sad look in his eyes, sad but not unhappy. There was a light in them, as if the green flame had sunk deeper into the dark wells of his thought.</p>
<p><q>'Of course, it is likely enough, my f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends,'</q> he said slowly, <q>'likely enough that we are going to our doom: the last <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ch of the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s. But if we stayed at home and did nothing, doom would find us anyway, so<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>r or later. That thought has long been growing in our hearts; and that is why we are <name type="PERSON">mar</name><name type="PERSON">chin</name>g now. It was not a hasty resolve. Now at least the last <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ch of the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s may be worth a song. Aye,'</q> he sighed, <q>'we may help the other peoples before we pass away. Still, I should have liked to see the songs come true about the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>wives. I should dearly have liked to see <name type="PERSON">Fimbrethil</name> again. But there, my f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends, songs like trees bear fruit only in their own time and their own way: and sometimes they are withered untimely.'</q></p>
<p>The <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s went st<name type="GPE">ri</name>ding on at a great pace. They had descended into a long fold of the land that fell away southward; now they began to climb up, and up, on to the high western <name type="GPE">ri</name>dge. The woods fell away and they came to scattered groups of birch, and then to bare slopes where only a few gaunt pine-trees grew. The sun sank behind the dark hill-back in front. <name type="ORG">Grey</name> <name type="TIME">dusk</name> fell.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> looked behind. The number of the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s had grown � or what was happening? Where the dim bare slopes that they had crossed should lie, he thought he saw groves of trees. But they were moving! Could it be that the trees of <name type="PERSON">Fangorn</name> were awake, and the forest was <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing, <name type="PERSON">mar</name><name type="PERSON">chin</name>g over the hills to war? He rubbed his eyes wonde<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng if sleep and shadow had deceived him; but the great grey shapes moved steadily onward. There was a noise like wind in many branches. The <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s were drawing near the crest of the <name type="GPE">ri</name>dge now, and all song had ceased. Night fell, and there was silence: nothing was to be heard save a faint quiver of the <name type="LOC">earth</name> beneath the feet of the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s, and a rustle, the shade of a whisper as of many d<name type="GPE">ri</name>fting leaves. At last they stood upon the summit, and looked down into a dark pit: the great cleft at the end of the mountains: <name type="PERSON">Nan Curun</name>�r, the <name type="LOC">Valley</name> of <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>.</p>
<p><q>'Night lies over <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard.</p>

<p>The White <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name></p>
<p><q>'My very b<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s are chilled,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>, flapping his arms and stamping his feet. Day had come at last. At <name type="TIME">dawn</name> the companions had made such breakfast as they could; now in the growing light they were getting ready to search the ground again for signs of the hobbits.</p>
<p><q>'And do not forget that old man!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. <q>'I should be happier if I could see the p<name type="GPE">ri</name>nt of a boot.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Why would that make you happy?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>.</p>
<p><q>'Because an old man with feet that leave <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ks might be no more than he seemed,'</q> answered the <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Dwarf</name>.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="DATE">May</name>be,'</q> said the <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name>; <q>'but a heavy boot might leave no p<name type="GPE">ri</name>nt here: the grass is deep and sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ngy.'</q></p>
<p><q>'That would not baffle a <name type="PRODUCT">Ranger</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. <q>'A bent blade is enough for <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> to read. But I do not expect him to find any traces. It was an evil phan<name type="PERSON">tom</name> of <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> that we saw <name type="TIME">last <name type="TIME">night</name></name>. I am sure of it, even under the light of <name type="TIME">morning</name>. His eyes are looking out on us from <name type="PERSON">Fangorn</name> even now, maybe.'</q></p>
<p><q>'It is likely enough,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>; <q>'yet I am not sure. I am thinking of the horses. You said <name type="TIME">last <name type="TIME">night</name></name>, <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>, that they were scared away. But I did not think so. Did you hear them, <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>? Did they sound to you like beasts in terror?'</q></p>
<p><q>'No,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. <q>'I heard them clearly. But for the darkness and our own fear I should have guessed that they were beasts wild with some sudden gladness. They spoke as horses will when they meet a f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end that they have long missed.'</q></p>
<p><q>'So I thought,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>; <q>'but I cannot read the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ddle, unless they return. Come! The light is growing fast. Let us look <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> and guess later! We should begin here, near to our own camping-ground, sear<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g carefully all about, and working up the slope towards the forest. To find the hobbits is our errand, whatever we may think of our visitor in the <name type="TIME">night</name>. If they escaped by some chance, then they must have hidden in the trees, or they would have been seen. If we find nothing between here and the eaves of the wood, then we will make a last search upon the battle-field and among the ashes. But there is little hope there: the horsemen of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> did their work too well.'</q></p>
<p>For some time the companions crawled and groped upon the ground. The tree stood mournfully above them, its dry leaves now hanging limp, and rattling in the chill easterly wind. <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> moved slowly away. He came to the ashes of the watch-fire near the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver-bank, and then began to retrace the ground back towards the knoll where the battle had been fought. Suddenly he stooped and bent low with his face almost in the grass. Then he called to the others. They came running up.</p>
<p><q>'Here at last we find news!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. He lifted up a broken leaf for them to see, a large pale leaf of golden hue, now fading and turning brown. <q>'Here is a mallorn-leaf of L�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en, and there are small crumbs on it, and a few more crumbs in the grass. And see! there are some pieces of cut cord lying nearby!'</q></p>
<p><q>'And here is the knife that cut them!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. He stooped and drew out of a tussock, into which some heavy foot had trampled it, a short jagged blade. The haft from which it had been snapped was beside it. <q>'It was an orc-weapon,'</q> he said, holding it gingerly, and looking with disgust at the carved handle: it had been shaped like a hideous head with squinting eyes and lee<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng mouth.</p>
<p><q>'Well, here is the strangest <name type="GPE">ri</name>ddle that we have yet found!'</q> exclaimed <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. <q>'A bound p<name type="GPE">ri</name>s<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>r escapes both from the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s and from the surrounding horsemen. He then stops, while still in the open, and cuts his bonds with an orc-knife. But how and why? For if his legs were tied, how did he walk? And if his arms were tied, how did he use the knife? And if neither were tied, why did he cut the cords at all? Being pleased with his skill, he then sat down and quietly ate some <name type="PERSON">waybread</name>! That at least is enough to show that he was a hobbit, without the mallorn-leaf. After that, I suppose, he turned his arms into wings and flew away singing into the trees. It should be easy to find him: we only need wings ourselves!'</q></p>
<p><q>'There was sorcery here <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght enough,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. <q>'What was that old man doing? What have you to say, <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>, to the reading of <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. Can you better it?'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="DATE">May</name>be, I could,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>, smiling. <q>'There are some other signs near at hand that you have not considered. I agree that the p<name type="GPE">ri</name>s<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>r was a hobbit and must have had either legs or hands free, before he came here. I guess that it was hands, because the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ddle then becomes easier, and also because, as I read the <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ks, he was _car<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed_ to this point by an <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>. Blood was spilled there, a few paces away, orc-blood. There are deep p<name type="GPE">ri</name>nts of hoofs all about this spot, and signs that a heavy thing was dragged away. The <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name> was slain by horsemen, and later his body was hauled to the fire. But the hobbit was not seen: he was not "in the open", for it was <name type="TIME">night</name> and he still had his <name type="ORG">elven</name>-cloak. He was exhausted and hungry, and it is not to be wondered at that, when he had cut his bonds with the knife of his fallen enemy, he rested and ate a little before he crept away. But it is a comfort to know that he had some _lembas_ in his pocket, even though he ran away without gear or pack; that, perhaps, is like a hobbit. I say _he_, though I hope and guess that both <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> were here together. There is, however, nothing to show that for certain.'</q></p>
<p><q>'And how do you suppose that either of our f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends came to have a hand free?'</q> asked <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>.</p>
<p><q>'I do not know how it happened,'</q> answered <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'Nor do I know why an <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name> was carrying them away. Not to help them to escape, we may be sure. <name type="PERSON">Nay</name>, rather I think that I now begin to understand a matter that has puzzled me from the beginning: why when <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> had fallen were the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s con<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>t with the capture of <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>? They did not seek out the rest of us, nor attack our camp; but instead they went with all speed towards <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard. Did they suppose they had captured the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>-bearer and his faithful comrade? I think not. Their masters would not dare to give such plain orders to <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s, even if they knew so much themselves; they would not speak openly to them of the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>: they are not trusty servants. But I think the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s had been commanded to capture _hobbits_, alive, at all costs. An attempt was made to slip out with the precious p<name type="GPE">ri</name>s<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>rs before the battle. Treachery perhaps, likely enough with such folk; some large and bold <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name> may have been trying to escape with the p<name type="GPE">ri</name>ze al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, for his own ends. There, that is my tale. Others might be devised. But on this we may count in any case: <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> at least of our f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends escaped. It is our task to find him and help him before we return to <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>. We must not be daunted by <name type="PERSON">Fangorn</name>, since need drove him into that dark place.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I do not know which daunts me more: <name type="PERSON">Fangorn</name>, or the thought of the long road through <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> on foot,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>.</p>
<p><q>'Then let us go to the forest,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>.</p>
<p>It was not long before <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> found fresh signs. At <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> point, near the bank of the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>wash, he came upon footp<name type="GPE">ri</name>nts: hobbit-p<name type="GPE">ri</name>nts, but too light for much to be made of them. Then again beneath the bole of a great tree on the very edge of the wood more p<name type="GPE">ri</name>nts were discovered. The <name type="LOC">earth</name> was bare and dry, and did not reveal much.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="CARDINAL">One</name> hobbit at least stood here for a while and looked back; and then he turned away into the forest,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>.</p>
<p><q>'Then we must go in, too,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. <q>'But I do not like the look of this <name type="PERSON">Fangorn</name>: and we were warned against it. I wish the chase had led anywhere else!'</q></p>
<p><q>'I do not think the wood feels evil, whatever tales may say,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. He stood under the eaves of the forest, stooping forward, as if he were lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing, and pee<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng with wide eyes into the shadows. <q>'No, it is not evil; or what evil is in it is far away. I catch only the faintest echoes of dark places where the hearts of the trees are black. There is no malice near us; but there is watchfulness, and anger.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Well, it has no cause to be angry with me,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. 'I have <name type="PERSON">don</name>e it no harm. '</p>
<p><q>'That is just as well,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. <q>'But n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>theless it has suffered harm. There is something happening inside, or going to happen. Do you not feel the <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>seness? It takes my breath.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I feel the air is stuffy,'</q> said the <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Dwarf</name>. <q>'This wood is lighter than <name type="GPE">Mirkwood</name>, but it is musty and shabby.'</q></p>
<p><q>'It is old, very old,'</q> said the <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name>. <q>'So old that almost I feel young again, as I have not felt since I journeyed with you children. It is old and full of memory. I could have been happy here, if I had come in <name type="DATE">day</name>s of peace.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I dare say you could,'</q> snorted <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. <q>'You are a <name type="PERSON">Wood</name>-elf, anyway, though <name type="ORG">Elves</name> of any kind are strange folk. Yet you comfort me. Where you go, I will go. But keep your bow ready to hand, and I will keep my axe loose in my belt. Not for use on trees,'</q> he added hastily, looking up at the tree under which they stood. <q>'I do not wish to meet that old man at unawares without an argument ready to hand, that is all. Let us go!'</q></p>
<p>With that the <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> hunters plunged into the forest of <name type="PERSON">Fangorn</name>. <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> and <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> left the tracking to <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. There was little for him to see. The floor of the forest was dry and covered with a d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ft of leaves; but guessing that the fugitives would stay near the water, he returned of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> to the banks of the stream. So it was that he came upon the place where <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> had drunk and bathed their feet. There plain for all to see were the footp<name type="GPE">ri</name>nts of <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> hobbits, <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> somewhat smaller than the other.</p>
<p><q>'This is good tidings,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'Yet the <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ks are <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> <name type="DATE">day</name>s old And it seems that at this point the hobbits left the water-side.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Then what shall we do now?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. <q>'We cannot pursue them through the whole fastness of <name type="PERSON">Fangorn</name>. We have come ill supplied. If we do not find them soon, we shall be of no use to them, except to sit down beside them and show our f<name type="GPE">ri</name>endship by starving together.'</q></p>
<p><q>'If that is indeed all we can do, then we must do that,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'Let us go on.'</q></p>
<p>They came at length to the steep abrupt end of <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard's <name type="ORG">Hill</name> and looked up at the rock-wall with its rough steps leading to the high shelf. Gleams of sun were st<name type="GPE">ri</name>king through the hurrying clouds, and the forest now looked less grey and drear.</p>
<p><q>'Let us go up and look about us!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. <q>'I will feel my breath short. I should like to taste a freer air for a while.'</q></p>
<p>The companions climbed up. <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> came last, moving slowly: he was scanning the steps and ledges closely.</p>
<p><q>'I am almost sure that the hobbits have been up here,'</q> he said. <q>'But there are other <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ks, very strange <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ks, which I do not understand. I wonder if we can see anything from this ledge which will help us to guess which way they went next?'</q></p>
<p>He stood up and looked about, but he saw nothing that was of any use. The shelf faced southward and eastward; but only on the east was the view open. There he could see the heads of the trees descending in ranks towards the plain from which they had come.</p>
<p><q>'We have journeyed a long way round,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. <q>'We could have all come here safe together, if we had left the <name type="LOC">Great <name type="LOC">River</name></name> on the <name type="ORG">sec</name>ond or <name type="ORDINAL">third</name> <name type="DATE">day</name> and struck west. Few can foresee whither their road will lead them, till they come to its end.'</q></p>
<p><q>'But we did not wish to come to <name type="PERSON">Fangorn</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>.</p>
<p><q>'Yet here we are-and nicely caught in the net,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok!'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok at what?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>.</p>
<p><q>'There in the trees.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Where? I have not elf-eyes.'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Hush</name>! Speak more softly! <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> pointing. <q>'Down in the wood, back in the Way that we have just come. It is he. Cannot you see him, passing from tree to tree?'</q></p>
<p><q>'I see, I see now!'</q> hissed <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok, <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>! Did I not warn you? There is the old man. All in dirty grey rags: that is why I could not see him at <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> looked and beheld a bent figure moving slowly. It was not far away. It looked like an old beggar-man, walking wea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ly, leaning on a rough staff. His head was bowed, and he did not look towards them. In other lands they would have greeted him with kind words; but now they stood silent, each feeling a strange expectancy: something was approa<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g that held a hidden power-or menace.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> gazed with wide eyes for a while, as step by step the figure drew nearer. Then suddenly, unable to contain himself longer, he burst out: <q>'Your bow, <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>! Bend it! Get ready! It is <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>. Do not let him speak, or put a spell upon us! Shoot <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>!'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> took his bow and bent it, slowly and as if some other will resisted him. He held an arrow loosely in his hand but did not fit it to the st<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng. <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> stood silent, his face was watchful and in<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>t.</p>
<p><q>'Why are you waiting? What is the matter with you?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> in a hissing whisper.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> is <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> quietly. <q>'We may not shoot an old man so, at unawares and unchallenged, whatever fear or doubt be on us. Watch and wait!'</q></p>
<p>At that moment the old man quickened his pace and came with surp<name type="GPE">ri</name>sing speed to the foot of the rock-wall. Then suddenly he looked up, while they stood motionless looking down. There was no sound.</p>
<p>They could not see his face: he was hooded, and above the hood he wore a wide-b<name type="GPE">ri</name>mmed hat, so that all his features were over-shadowed, except for the end of his nose and his <name type="PERSON">grey beard</name>. Yet it seemed to <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> that he caught the gleam of eyes keen and b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght from within the shadow of the hooded brows.</p>
<p>At last the old man broke the silence. <q>'Well met indeed, my f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends,'</q> he said in a soft voice. <q>'I wish to speak to you. Will you come down or shall I come up?'</q> Without waiting for an answer he began to climb.</p>
<p><q>'Now!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. <q>'Stop him, <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>!'</q></p>
<p><q>'Did I not say that I wished to speak to you?'</q> said the old man. <q>'Put away that bow, Master <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name>!'</q></p>
<p>The bow and arrow fell from <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>' hands, and his arms hung loose at his sides.</p>
<p><q>'And you, Master <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Dwarf</name>, pray take your hand from your axe-haft, till I am up! You will not need such arguments.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> started and then stood still as st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, sta<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng, while the old man sprang up the rough steps as nimbly as a goat. All wea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ness seemed to have left him. As he stepped up on to the shelf there was a gleam, too b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ef for certainty, a quick glint of white, as if some garment shrouded by the grey rags had been for an instant revealed The intake of <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>'s breath could be heard as a loud hiss in the silence.</p>
<p><q>'Well met, I say again!'</q> said the old man, coming towards them. When he was <name type="QUANTITY">a few feet</name> away, he stood, stooping over his staff, with his head thrust forward, pee<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng at them from under his hood. <q>'And what may you be doing in these parts? An <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name>, a Man, and a <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Dwarf</name>. all clad in elvish fashion. No doubt there is a tale worth hea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng behind it all. Such things are not of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> seen here.'</q></p>
<p><q>'You speak as <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> that knows <name type="PERSON">Fangorn</name> well,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'Is that so?'</q></p>
<p><q>'Not well,'</q> said the old man: <q>'that would be the study of many lives. But I come here now and again.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Might we know your name, and then hear what it is that you have to say to us?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'<name type="TIME">The <name type="TIME">morning</name></name> passes, and we have an errand that will not wait.'</q></p>
<p><q>'As for what I wished to say, I have said it: What may you be doing, and what tale can you tell of yourselves? As for my name!'</q> He broke off, laughing long and softly. <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> felt a shudder run through him at the sound, a strange cold th<name type="GPE">ri</name>ll; and yet it was not fear or terror that he felt: rather it was like the sudden bite of a keen air, or the slap of a cold rain that wakes an uneasy sleeper.</p>
<p><q>'My name!'</q> said the old man again. <q>'Have you not guessed it already? You have heard it before, I think. Yes, you have heard it before. But come now, what of your tale?'</q></p>
<p>The <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> companions stood silent and made no answer.</p>
<p><q>'There are some who would begin to doubt whether your errand is fit to tell,'</q> said the old man. <q>'Happily I know something of it. You are tracking the footsteps of <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> young hobbits, I believe. Yes, hobbits. <name type="PERSON">Don</name>'t stare, as if you had never heard the strange name before. You have, and so have I. Well, they climbed up here the <name type="DATE">day</name> before yester<name type="DATE">day</name>; and they met some<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> that they did not expect. Does that comfort you? And now you would like to know where they were taken? Well, well, maybe I can give you some news about that. But why are we standing? Your errand, you see, is no longer as urgent as you thought. Let us sit down and be more at ease.'</q></p>
<p>The old man turned away and went towards a heap of fallen st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s and rock at the foot of the cliff behind. Immediately, as if a spell had been removed, the others relaxed and stirred. <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>'s hand went at once to his axe-haft. <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> drew his sword. <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> picked up his bow.</p>
<p>The old man took no notice, but stooped and sat himself on a low flat st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. Then his grey cloak drew apart, and they saw, beyond doubt, that he was clothed beneath all in white.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>, sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>nging towards him with axe in hand. <q>'speak! Tell us where you have hidden our f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends! What have you <name type="PERSON">don</name>e with them? Speak, or I will make a dint in your hat that even a wizard will find it hard to deal with!'</q></p>
<p>The old man was too quick for him. He sprang to his feet and leaped to the top of a large rock. There he stood, grown suddenly tall, towe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng above them. His hood and his grey rags were flung away. His white garments sh<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. He lifted up his staff, and <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>'s axe leaped from his grasp and fell <name type="GPE">ri</name>nging on the ground. The sword of <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>, stiff in his motionless hand, blazed with a sudden fire. <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> gave a great shout and shot an arrow high into the air: it vanished in a flash of flame.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="LOC">Mithrandir</name>!'</q> he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed. <q>'<name type="LOC">Mithrandir</name>!'</q></p>
<p><q>'Well met, I say to you again. <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>!'</q> said the old man.</p>
<p>They all gazed at him. His <name type="PERSON">hai</name>r was white as snow in the sunshine; and gleaming white was his robe; the eyes under his deep brows were b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght, piercing as the rays of the sun; power was in his hand. Between wonder, joy, and fear they stood and found no words to say.</p>
<p>At last <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> stirred. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>!'</q> he said. <q>'Beyond all hope you return to us in our need! What veil was over my sight? <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>!'</q> <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> said nothing, hut sank to his knees, shading his eyes.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>,'</q> the old man repeated, as if recalling from old memory a long disused word. <q>'Yes, that was the name. I was <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>.'</q></p>
<p>He stepped down from the rock, and picking up his grey cloak wrapped it about him: it seemed as if the sun had been shining, but now was hid in cloud again. <q>'Yes, you may still call me <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>,'</q> he said, and the voice was the voice of their old f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end and guide. <q>'Get up, my good <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>! No blame to you, and no harm <name type="PERSON">don</name>e to me. Indeed my f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends, n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of you have any weapon that could hurt me. Be merry! We meet again. At the turn of the tide. The great storm is coming, but the tide has turned.'</q></p>
<p>He laid his hand on <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>'s head, and the <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Dwarf</name> looked up and laughed suddenly. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>!'</q> he said. <q>'But you are all in white!'</q></p>
<p><q>'Yes, I am white now,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'Indeed I _am_ <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>, <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> might almost say, <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> as he should have been. But come now, tell me of yourselves! I have passed through fire and deep water, since we parted. I have forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> much that I thought I knew, and learned again much that I had forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>. I can see many things far off, but many things that are close at hand I cannot see. Tell me of yourselves!'</q></p>
<p><q>'What do you wish to know?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'All that has happened since we parted on the b<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge would be a long tale. Will you not <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> give us news of the hobbits? Did you find them, and are they safe?'</q></p>
<p><q>'No, I did not find them,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'There was a darkness over the valleys of the <name type="ORG">Emyn Muil</name>, and I did not know of their captivity, until the eagle told me.'</q></p>
<p><q>'The eagle!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. <q>'I have seen an eagle high and far off: the last time was <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> <name type="DATE">day</name>s ago, above the <name type="ORG">Emyn Muil</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Yes,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, <q>'that was <name type="PERSON">Gwaihir</name> the <name type="ORG">Windlord</name>, who rescued me from <name type="PERSON">Orthanc</name>. I sent him before me to watch the <name type="LOC">River</name> and gather tidings. His sight is keen, but he cannot see all that passes under hill and tree. Some things he has seen, and others I have seen myself. The <name type="ORG">Ring</name> now has passed beyond my help, or the help of any of the <name type="ORG">Company</name> that set out from <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name>. Very nearly it was revealed to the Enemy, but it escaped. I had some part in that: for I sat in a high place, and I strove with the Dark <name type="FAC">Tower</name>; and the <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name> passed. Then I was weary, very weary; and I walked long in dark thought.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Then you know about <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w do things go with him?'</q></p>
<p><q>'I cannot say. He was saved from a great pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>l, but many lie before him still. He resolved to go al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> to <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>, and he set out: that is all that I can say.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Not al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. <q>'We think that <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> went with him.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Did he!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, and there was a gleam in his eye and a smile on his face. <q>'Did he indeed? It is news to me, yet it does not surp<name type="GPE">ri</name>se me. Good! Very good! You ligh<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> my heart. You must tell me more. Now sit by me and tell me the tale of your journey.'</q></p>
<p>The companions sat on the ground at his feet, and <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> took up the tale. For a long while <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> said nothing, and he asked no questions. His hands were spread upon his knees, and his eyes were closed. At last when <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> spoke of the death of <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> and of his last journey upon the <name type="LOC">Great <name type="LOC">River</name></name>, the old man sighed.</p>
<p><q>'You have not said all that you know or guess, <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> my f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end,'</q> he said quietly. <q>'Poor <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>! I could not see what happened to him. It was a sore t<name type="GPE">ri</name>al for such a man: a war<name type="GPE">ri</name>or, and a lord of men. <name type="PERSON">Galad<name type="GPE">ri</name>el</name> told me that he was in pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>l. But he escaped in the end. I am glad. It was not in vain that the young hobbits came with us, if only for <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>'s sake. But that is not the only part they have to play. They were brought to <name type="PERSON">Fangorn</name>, and their coming was like <name type="DATE">the fall</name>ing of small st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s that starts an avalanche in the mountains. Even as we talk here, I hear the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> rumblings. <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> had best not be caught away from home when the dam bursts!'</q></p>
<p><q>'In <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> thing you have not changed, dear f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>: <q>'you still speak in <name type="GPE">ri</name>ddles.'</q></p>
<p><q>'What? In <name type="GPE">ri</name>ddles?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'No! For I was talking aloud to myself. A habit of the old: they choose the wisest person present to speak to; the long explanations needed by the young are wearying.'</q> He laughed, but the sound now seemed warm and kindly as a gleam of sunshine.</p>
<p><q>'I am no longer young even in the reckoning of <name type="ORG">Men</name> of the Ancient <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>uses,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'Will you not open your mind more clearly to me?'</q></p>
<p><q>'What then shall I say?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, and paused for a while in thought. 'This in b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ef is how I see things at the moment, if you wish to have a piece of my mind as plain as possible. The Enemy, of course, has long known that the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> is abroad, and that it is borne by a hobbit. He knows now the number of our <name type="ORG">Company</name> that set out from <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name>, and the kind of each of us. But he does not yet perceive our purpose clearly. He supposes that we were all going to Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name>; for that is what he would himself have <name type="PERSON">don</name>e in our place. And according to his wisdom it would have been a heavy stroke against his power. Indeed he is in great fear, not knowing what mighty <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> may suddenly appear, wielding the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>, and assailing him with war, seeking to cast him down and take his place. That we should wish to cast him down and have no <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> in his place is not a thought that occurs to his mind. That we should try to destroy the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> itself has not yet entered into his darkest dream. In which no doubt you will see our good fortune and our hope. For imagining war he has let loose war, believing that he has no time to waste; for he that st<name type="GPE">ri</name>kes the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> blow, if he st<name type="GPE">ri</name>kes it hard enough, may need to st<name type="GPE">ri</name>ke no more. So the forces that he has long been prepa<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng he is now setting in motion, so<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>r than he in<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ded. <name type="PERSON">Wise</name> fool. For if he had used all his power to guard <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>, so that n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> could enter, and bent all his guild to the hunting of the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>, then indeed hope would have faded: neither <name type="ORG">Ring</name> nor <name type="ORG">Bear</name>er could long have eluded him. But now his eye gazes abroad rather than near at home; and mostly he looks towards Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name>. Very soon now his strength will fall upon it like a storm.</p>
<p><q>'For already he knows that the messengers that he sent to waylay the <name type="ORG">Company</name> have failed again. They have not found the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>. Neither have they brought away any hobbits as hostages. Had they <name type="PERSON">don</name>e even so much as that, it would have been a heavy blow to us, and it might have been fatal. But let us not darken our hearts by imagining the t<name type="GPE">ri</name>al of their gentle loyalty in the Dark <name type="FAC">Tower</name>. For the Enemy has failed-so far. Thanks to <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>:'</q></p>
<p><q>'Then is not <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> a traitor?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>.</p>
<p><q>'Indeed yes,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. 'Doubly. And is not that strange? Nothing that we have endured of late has seemed so g<name type="GPE">ri</name>evous as the treason of <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard. Even reck<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>d as a lord and captain <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> has grown very strong. He threa<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>s the <name type="ORG">Men</name> of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> and draws off their help from Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name>, even as the main blow is approa<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g from the <name type="LOC">East</name>. Yet a treacherous weapon is ever a danger to the hand. <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> also had a mind to capture the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>, for himself, or at least to snare some hobbits for his evil purposes. So between them our enemies have cont<name type="GPE">ri</name>ved only to b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> with <name type="PERSON">mar</name>vellous speed, and in the <name type="GPE">nick</name> of time, to <name type="PERSON">Fangorn</name>, where otherwise they would never have come at all!</p>
<p><q>'Also they have filled themselves with new doubts that disturb their plans. No tidings of the battle will come to <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>, thanks to the horsemen of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>; but the Dark <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd knows that <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> hobbits were taken in the <name type="ORG">Emyn Muil</name> and borne away towards <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard against the will of his own servants. He now has <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard to fear as well as Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name>. If Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name> falls, it will go ill with <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q>'It is a pity that our f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends lie in between,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. <q>'If no land divided <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard and <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>, then they could fight while we watched and waited.'</q></p>
<p><q>'The victor would emerge stronger than either, and free from doubt,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'But <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard cannot fight <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>, unless <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> obtains the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>. That he will never do now. He does not yet know his pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>l. There is much that he does not know. He was so eager to lay his hands on his prey that he could not wait at home, and he came forth to meet and to spy on his messengers. But he came too late, for once, and the battle was over and beyond his help before he reached these parts. He did not remain here long. I look into his mind and I see his doubt. He has no woodcraft. He believes that the horsemen slew and burned all upon the field of battle; but he does not know whether the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s were b<name type="GPE">ri</name>nging any p<name type="GPE">ri</name>s<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>rs or not. And he does not know of the quarrel between his servants and the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>; nor does he know of the Winged <name type="PERSON">Messenger</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q>'The Winged <name type="PERSON">Messenger</name>!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. <q>'I shot at him with the bow of <name type="PERSON">Galad<name type="GPE">ri</name>el</name> above <name type="PERSON">Sarn Gebir</name>, and I felled him from the sky. He filled us all with fear. What new terror is this?'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="CARDINAL">One</name> that you cannot slay with arrows,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'You only slew his <name type="PERSON">steed</name>. It was a good deed; but the <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name> was soon horsed again. For he was a Nazg�l, <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the <name type="CARDINAL">Nine</name>, who <name type="GPE">ri</name>de now upon winged <name type="PERSON">steed</name>s. Soon their terror will overshadow the last armies of our f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends, cutting off the sun. But they have not yet been allowed to cross the <name type="LOC">River</name>, and <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> does not know of this new shape in which the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>wraiths have been clad. His thought is ever on the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>. Was it present in the battle? Was it found? What if Th�oden, <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd of the <name type="PERSON">Mark</name>, should come by it and learn of its power? That is the danger that he sees, and he has fled back to <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard to double and treble his assault on <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>. And all the time there is another danger, close at hand, which he does not see, busy with his fiery thoughts. He has forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Now you speak to yourself again,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> with a smile. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard is not known to me. And I have guessed part of <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>'s double treachery; yet I do not see in what way the coming of <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> hobbits to <name type="PERSON">Fangorn</name> has served, save to give us a long and fruitless chase.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Wait <name type="TIME">a minute</name>!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. <q>'There is another thing that I should like to know <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>. Was it you, <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, or <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> that we saw <name type="TIME">last <name type="TIME">night</name></name>?'</q></p>
<p><q>'You certainly did not see me,'</q> answered <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, <q>'therefore I must guess that you saw <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>. Evidently we look so much alike that your desire to make an incurable dent in my hat must be excused.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Good, good!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. <q>'I am glad that it was not you.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> laughed again. <q>'Yes, my good <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Dwarf</name>,'</q> he said, <q>'it is a comfort not to be mistaken at all points. Do I not know it only too well! But, of course, I never blamed you for your welcome of me. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w could I do so, who have so of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> counselled my f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends to suspect even their own hands when dealing with the Enemy. Bless you, <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>, son of <name type="PRODUCT">Gl�</name>in! <name type="DATE">May</name>be you will see us both together <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> <name type="DATE">day</name> and judge between us!'</q></p>
<p><q>'But the hobbits!'</q> <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> broke in. <q>'We have come far to seek them, and you seem to know where they are. Where are they now?'</q></p>
<p><q>'With <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard and the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>.</p>
<p><q>'The <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s!'</q> exclaimed <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'Then there is truth in the old legends about the dwellers in the deep forests and the giant shepherds of the trees? Are there still <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s in the world? I thought they were only a memory of <name type="DATE">ancient <name type="DATE">day</name>s</name>, if indeed they were ever more than a legend of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q>'A legend of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Nay</name>, every <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name> in <name type="PERSON">Wilderland</name> has sung songs of the old <name type="PERSON">Onod<name type="GPE">ri</name>m</name> and their long sorrow. Yet even among us they are only a memory. If I were to meet <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> still walking in this world, then indeed I should feel young again! But <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard: that is only a rende<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng of <name type="PERSON">Fangorn</name> into the Common <name type="ORG">Speech</name>; yet you seem to speak of a person. Who is this <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard?'</q></p>
<p><q>'Ah! now you are asking much,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'The little that I know of his long slow story would make a tale for which we have no time now. <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard is <name type="PERSON">Fangorn</name>, the guardian of the forest; he is the oldest of the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s, the oldest living thing that still walks beneath the <name type="ORG">Sun</name> upon this <name type="LOC">Middle-<name type="LOC">earth</name></name>. I hope indeed, <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>, that you may yet meet him. <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> have been fortunate: they met him here, even where we sit. For he came here <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> <name type="DATE">day</name>s ago and bore them away to his dwelling far off by the roots of the mountains. He of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> comes here, especially when his mind is uneasy, and rumours of the world outside trouble him. I saw him <name type="CARDINAL">four</name> <name type="DATE">day</name>s ago st<name type="GPE">ri</name>ding among the trees, and I think he saw me, for he paused; but I did not speak, for I was heavy with thought, and weary after my struggle with the <name type="PRODUCT">Eye</name> of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>; and he did not speak either, nor call my name.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Perhaps he also thought that you were <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. <q>'But you speak of him as if he was a f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end. I thought <name type="PERSON">Fangorn</name> was dangerous.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Dangerous!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'And so am I, very dangerous: more dangerous than anything you will ever meet, unless you are brought alive before the seat of the Dark <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd. And <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> is dangerous, and <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> is dangerous. You are beset with dangers, <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> son of <name type="PRODUCT">Gl�</name>in; for you are dangerous yourself, in your own fashion. Certainly the forest of <name type="PERSON">Fangorn</name> is pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>lous-not least to those that are too ready with their axes; and <name type="PERSON">Fangorn</name> himself, he is pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>lous too; yet he is wise and kindly n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>theless. But now his long slow wrath is b<name type="GPE">ri</name>mming over, and all the forest is filled with it. The coming of the hobbits and the tidings that they brought have spilled it: it will soon be running like a flood; but its tide is turned against <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> and the axes of <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard. A thing is about to happen which has not happened since the <name type="DATE">Elder Days</name>: the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s are going to wake up and find that they are strong.'</q></p>
<p><q>'What will they do?'</q> asked <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> in astonishment.</p>
<p><q>'I do not know,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'I do not think they know themselves. I wonder.'</q> He fell silent, his head bowed in thought.</p>
<p>The others looked at him. A gleam of sun through fleeting clouds fell on his hands, which lay now upturned on his lap: they seemed to be filled with light as a cup is with water. At last he looked up and gazed straight at the sun.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="TIME">The <name type="TIME">morning</name></name> is wea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng away,'</q> he said. <q>'Soon we must go.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Do we go to find our f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends and to see <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard?'</q> asked <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>.</p>
<p><q>'No,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'That is not the road that you must take. I have spoken words of hope. But only of hope. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>pe is not victory. War is upon us and all our f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends, a war in which only the use of the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> could give us surety of victory. It fills me with great sorrow and great fear: for much shall be destroyed and all may be lost. I am <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> the White, but <name type="ORG">Black</name> is mightier still.'</q></p>
<p>He rose and gazed out eastward, shading his eyes, as if he saw things far away that n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of them could see. Then he shook his head. <q>'No,'</q> he said in a soft voice, <q>'it has g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> beyond our reach. Of that at least let us be glad. We can no longer be tempted to use the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>. We must go down to face a pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>l near despair, yet that deadly pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>l is removed.'</q></p>
<p>He turned. <q>'Come, <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> son of <name type="ORG">Arathorn</name>!'</q> he said. <q>'Do not regret your choice in the valley of the <name type="ORG">Emyn Muil</name>, nor call it a vain pursuit. You chose amid doubts the path that seemed <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght: the choice was just, and it has been rewarded. For so we have met in time, who otherwise might have met too late. But the quest of your companions is over. Your next journey is <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ked by your given word. You must go to <name type="ORG">Edoras</name> and seek out Th�oden in his hall. For you are needed. The light of And�<name type="GPE">ri</name>l must now be uncovered in the battle for which it has so long waited. There is war in <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>, and worse evil: it goes ill with Th�oden.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Then are we not to see the merry young hobbits again?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>.</p>
<p><q>'I did not say so,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'Who knows? Have patience. Go where you must go, and hope! To <name type="ORG">Edoras</name>! I go thither also.'</q></p>
<p><q>'It is a long way for a man to walk, young or old,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'I fear the battle will be over long ere I come there.'</q></p>
<p><q>'We shall see, we shall see,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'Will you come now with me?'</q></p>
<p><q>'Yes, we will set out together,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'But I do not doubt that you will come there before me, if you wish.'</q> He rose and looked long at <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. The others gazed at them in silence as they stood there facing <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> another. The grey figure of the Man, <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> son of <name type="ORG">Arathorn</name>, was tall, and stern as st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, his hand upon the hilt of his sword; he looked as if some king out of the mists of the sea had stepped upon the shores of lesser men. Before him stooped the old figure, white; shining now as if with some light kindled within, bent, laden with <name type="DATE">year</name>s, but holding a power beyond the strength of kings.</p>
<p><q>'Do I not say truly, <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> at last, <q>'that you could go whithersoever you wished quicker than I? And this I also say: you are our captain and our banner. The Dark <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd has <name type="CARDINAL">Nine</name>. But we have <name type="CARDINAL">One</name>, mightier than they: the White <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>. He has passed through the fire and the abyss, and they shall fear him. We will go where he leads.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Yes, together we will follow you,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. <q>'But <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>, it would ease my heart, <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, to hear what befell you in <name type="GPE">Mo<name type="GPE">ri</name>a</name>. Will you not tell us? Can you not stay even to tell your f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends how you were delivered?'</q></p>
<p><q>'I have stayed already too long,'</q> answered <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Tim</name>e is short. But if there were <name type="DATE">a <name type="DATE">year</name></name> to spend, I would not tell you all.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Then tell us what you will, and time allows!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. <q>'Come, <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, tell us how you fared with the <name type="GPE">Balrog</name>!'</q></p>
<p><q>'Name him not!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, and for a moment it seemed that a cloud of pain passed over his face, and he sat silent, looking old as death. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ng time I fell,'</q> he said at last, slowly, as if thinking back with difficulty. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ng I fell, and he fell with me. His fire was about me. I was burned. Then we plunged into the deep water and all was dark. Cold it was as the tide of death: almost it froze my heart.'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Deep</name> is the abyss that is spanned by Du<name type="GPE">ri</name>n's <name type="FAC">B<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge</name>, and n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> has measured it,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>.</p>
<p><q>'Yet it has a bot<name type="PERSON">tom</name>, beyond light and knowledge,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. 'Thither I came at last, to the uttermost foundations of st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. He was with me still. His fire was quenched, but now he was a thing of slime, stronger than a strangling snake.</p>
<p><q>'We fought far under the living <name type="LOC">earth</name>, where time is not counted. Ever he clutched me, and ever I hewed him, till at last he fled into dark tunnels. They were not made by Du<name type="GPE">ri</name>n's folk, <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> son of <name type="PRODUCT">Gl�</name>in. <name type="LOC">Far</name>, far below the deepest delving of the <name type="ORG">Dwarves</name>, the world is gnawed by nameless things. Even <name type="ORG">Sauron</name> knows them not. They are older than he. Now I have walked there, but I will b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng no report to darken the light of <name type="DATE">day</name>. In that despair my enemy was my only hope, and I pursued him, clut<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g at his heel. Thus he brought me back at last to the <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret ways of <name type="GPE">Khaz</name>ad-d�m: too well he knew them all. Ever up now we went, until we came to <name type="PRODUCT">the Endless Stair</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ng has that been lost,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. <q>'Many have said that it was never made save in legend, but others say that it was destroyed.'</q></p>
<p><q>'It was made, and it had not been destroyed,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. 'From the lowest dungeon to the highest peak it climbed. ascending in unbroken spiral in <name type="CARDINAL">many thousand</name> steps, until it issued at last in Du<name type="GPE">ri</name>n's <name type="FAC">Tower</name> carved in the living rock of <name type="GPE">Zirak</name>-zigil, the pinnacle of the <name type="PERSON">Silvertine</name>.</p>
<p><q>'There upon <name type="GPE">Celebdil</name> was a l<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>ly window in the snow, and before it lay a narrow space, a dizzy ey<name type="GPE">ri</name>e above the mists of the world. The sun sh<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> fiercely there, but all below was wrapped in cloud. Out he sprang, and even as I came behind, he burst into new flame. There was n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> to see, or perhaps in after ages songs would still be sung of the <name type="EVENT">Battle</name> of the Peak.'</q> Suddenly <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> laughed. 'But what would they say in song? Those that looked up from afar thought that the mountain was crowned with storm. Thunder they heard, and lightning, they said, smote upon <name type="GPE">Celebdil</name>, and leaped back broken into tongues of fire. Is not that enough? A great smoke rose about us, vapour and steam. Ice fell like rain. I threw down my enemy, and he fell from the high place and broke the mountain-side where he smote it in his ruin. Then darkness took me; and I strayed out of thought and time, and I <name type="PERSON">wan</name>dered far on roads that I will not tell.</p>
<p>'Naked I was sent back � for a b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ef time, until my task is <name type="PERSON">don</name>e. And naked I lay upon the mountain-top. The tower behind was crumbled into dust, the window g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>; the ruined stair was choked with burned and broken st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. I was al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>, without escape upon the hard horn of the world. There I lay sta<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng upward, while the stars wheeled over, and each <name type="DATE">day</name> was as long as a life-age of the <name type="LOC">earth</name>. Faint to my ears came the gathered rumour of all lands: the sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>nging and the dying, the song and the weeping, and the slow everlasting groan of overburdened st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. And so at the last <name type="PERSON">Gwaihir</name> the <name type="ORG">Windlord</name> found me again, and he took me up and bore me away.</p>
<p><q>' 'Ever am I fated to be your burden, f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end at need,'</q> I said.</p>
<p><q>' 'A burden you have been,'</q> he answered, <q>'but not so now. Light as a s<name type="PERSON">wan</name>'s feather in my claw you are. The <name type="ORG">Sun</name> shines through you. Indeed I do not think you need me any more: were I to let you fall you would float upon the wind.'</q></p>
<p><q>' 'Do not let me fall!'</q> I gasped, for I felt life in me again. <q>'<name type="ORG">Bear</name> me to <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>thl�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en!'</q></p>
<p><q>' 'That indeed is the command of the <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> <name type="PERSON">Galad<name type="GPE">ri</name>el</name> who sent me to look for you,'</q> he answered.</p>
<p>'Thus it was that I came to <name type="ORG">Caras Galadhon</name> and found you but lately g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. I tar<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed there in the ageless time of that land where <name type="DATE">day</name>s b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng healing not decay. Healing I found, and I was clothed in white. Counsel I gave and counsel took. Thence by strange roads I came, and messages I b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng to some of you. To <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> I was bidden to say this:</p>
<p>Where now are the D�nedain, <name type="ORG">Elessar</name>, <name type="ORG">Elessar</name>?</p>
<p>Why do thy kinsfolk <name type="PERSON">wan</name>der afar?</p>
<p>Near is the <name type="TIME">hour</name> when the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>st should come forth,</p>
<p>And the <name type="ORG">Grey</name> <name type="ORG">Company</name> <name type="GPE">ri</name>de from the <name type="LOC">North</name>.</p>
<p>But dark is the path appointed for thee:</p>
<p>The Dead watch the road that leads to the <name type="LOC">Sea</name>.</p>
<p>To <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> she sent this word:</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> Greenleaf long under tree</p>
<p>In joy thou hast lived. Beware of the <name type="LOC">Sea</name>!</p>
<p>If thou hearest the cry of the gull on the shore,</p>
<p>Thy heart shall then rest in the forest no more.'</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> fell silent and shut his eyes.</p>
<p><q>'Then she sent me no message?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> and bent his head.</p>
<p><q>'Dark are her words,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>, <q>'and little do they mean to those that receive them.'</q></p>
<p><q>'That is no comfort,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>.</p>
<p><q>'What then?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. <q>'Would you have her speak openly to you of your death?'</q></p>
<p><q>'Yes. if she had nought else to say.'</q></p>
<p><q>'What is that?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, opening his eyes. 'Yes, I think I can guess what her words may mean. Your par<name type="PERSON">don</name>, <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>! I was ponde<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng the messages once again. But indeed she sent words to you, and neither dark nor sad.</p>
<p>' "To <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> son of <name type="PRODUCT">Gl�</name>in," she said, "give his <name type="PERSON">Lady</name>'s greeting. <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ck-bearer, wherever thou <name type="PERSON">goest</name> my thought goes with thee. But have a care to lay thine axe to the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght tree!" '</p>
<p><q>'In <name type="TIME">happy <name type="TIME">hour</name></name> you have returned to us, <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>,'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed the <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Dwarf</name>, cape<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng as he sang loudly in the strange dwarf-tongue. <q>'Come, come!'</q> he shouted, swinging his axe. <q>'Since <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>'s head is now sacred, let us find <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> that it is <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght to cleave!'</q></p>
<p><q>'That will not be far to seek,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing from his seat. <q>'Come! We have spent all the time that is allowed to a meeting of parted f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends. Now there is need of haste.'</q></p>
<p>He wrapped himself again in his old tattered cloak, and led the way. Following him they descended quickly from the high shelf and made their way back through the forest, down the bank of the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>wash. They spoke no more words, until they stood again upon the grass beyond the eaves of <name type="PERSON">Fangorn</name>. There was no sign of their horses to be seen.</p>
<p><q>'They have not returned,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. <q>'It will be a weary walk!'</q></p>
<p><q>'I shall not walk. <name type="PERSON">Tim</name>e presses,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. Then lifting up his head he gave a long whistle. So clear and piercing was the note that the others stood amazed to hear such a sound come from those old bearded lips. <name type="PERSON">Thr</name>ee times he whistled; and then faint and far off it seemed to them that they heard the whinny of a horse borne up from the plains upon the eastern wind. They waited wonde<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng. Before long there came the sound of hoofs, at <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> hardly more than a tremor of the ground perceptible only to <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> as he lay upon the grass, then growing steadily louder and clearer to a quick beat.</p>
<p><q>'There is <name type="CARDINAL">more than <name type="CARDINAL">one</name></name> horse coming,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>.</p>
<p><q>'Certainly,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'We are too great a burden for <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q>'There are <name type="CARDINAL">three</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>, gazing out over the plain. <q>'See how they run! There is <name type="PERSON">Hasufel</name>, and there is my f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end <name type="GPE">Arod</name> beside him! But there is another that st<name type="GPE">ri</name>des ahead: a very great horse. I have not seen his like before.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Nor will you again,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'That is <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>fax. He is the chief of the _<name type="ORG">Mearas</name>_, lords of horses, and not even Th�oden, <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>, has ever looked on a better. Does he not shine like silver, and run as smoothly as a swift stream? He has come for me: the horse of the White <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>. We are going to battle together.'</q></p>
<p>Even as the old wizard spoke, the great horse came st<name type="GPE">ri</name>ding up the slope towards them; his coat was glis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing and his mane flowing in the wind of his speed. The <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> others followed, now far behind. As soon as <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>fax saw <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, he checked his pace and whinnied loudly; then trotting gently forward he stooped his proud head and nuzzled his great nost<name type="GPE">ri</name>ls against the old man's neck.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> caressed him. <q>'It is a long way from <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name>, my f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end,'</q> he said; <q>'but you are wise and swift and come at need. <name type="LOC">Far</name> let us <name type="GPE">ri</name>de now together, and part not in this world again!'</q></p>
<p>Soon the other horses came up and stood quietly by, as if awaiting orders. <q>'We go at once to <name type="GPE">Meduseld</name>, the hall of your master, Th�oden,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, addressing them gravely. They bowed their heads. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Tim</name>e presses, so with your leave, my f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends, we will <name type="GPE">ri</name>de. We beg you to use all the speed that you can. <name type="PERSON">Hasufel</name> shall bear <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> and <name type="GPE">Arod</name> <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. I will set <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> before me, and by his leave <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>fax shall bear us both. We will wait now only to d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk a little.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Now I understand a part of <name type="TIME">last <name type="TIME">night</name></name>'s <name type="GPE">ri</name>ddle,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> as he sprang lightly upon <name type="GPE">Arod</name>'s back. <q>'Whether they fled at <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> in fear, or not, our horses met <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>fax, their chieftain, and greeted him with joy. Did you know that he was at hand, <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>?'</q></p>
<p><q>'Yes, I knew,'</q> said the wizard. <q>'I bent my thought upon him, bidding him to make haste; for yester<name type="DATE">day</name> he was far away in the south of this land. <name type="PERSON">Swift</name>ly may he bear me back again!'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> spoke now to <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>fax, and the horse set off at a good pace, yet not beyond the measure of the others. After a little while he turned suddenly, and choosing a place where the banks were lower, he waded the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver, and then led them away due south into a flat land, treeless and wide. The wind went like grey waves through the endless miles of grass. There was no sign of road or track, but <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>fax did not stay or falter.</p>
<p><q>'He is stee<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng a straight course now for the halls of Th�oden under the slopes of the White <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'It will be quicker so. The ground is firmer in the <name type="LOC">East</name>emnet, where the chief northward track lies, across the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver, but <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>fax knows the way through every <name type="PERSON">fen</name> and hollow.'</q></p>
<p>For many <name type="TIME">hour</name>s they rode on through the meads and <name type="GPE">ri</name>verlands. Of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> the grass was so high that it reached above the knees of the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ders, and their <name type="PERSON">steed</name>s seemed to be swimming in a grey-green sea. They came upon many hidden pools, and broad acres of sedge waving above wet and treacherous bogs; but <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>fax found the way, and the other horses followed in his swath. Slowly the sun fell from the sky down into the <name type="LOC">West</name>. <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>oking out over the great plain, far away the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ders saw it for a moment like a red fire sinking into the grass. <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>w upon the edge of sight shoulders of the mountains glinted red upon either side. A smoke seemed to <name type="GPE">ri</name>se up and darken the sun's disc to the hue of blood, as if it had kindled the grass as it passed down under the <name type="GPE">ri</name>m of <name type="LOC">earth</name>.</p>
<p><q>'There lies the <name type="ORG">Gap</name> of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'It is now almost due west of us. That way lies <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I see a great smoke,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. <q>'What may that be?'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="EVENT">Battle</name> and war!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'Ride on!'</q></p>
</chapter><chapter num="6"><heading>Chapter 6</heading>
<p>The <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g of the Golden <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>l</p>
<p>They rode on through sunset, and slow <name type="TIME">dusk</name>, and gathe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng <name type="TIME">night</name>. When at last they halted and dismounted, even <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> was stiff and weary. <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> only allowed them <name type="TIME">a few <name type="TIME">hour</name>s</name>' rest. <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> and <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> slept and <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> lay flat, stretched upon his back; but <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> stood, leaning on his staff, gazing into the darkness, east and west. All was silent, and there was no sign or sound of living thing. <name type="TIME">The <name type="TIME">night</name></name> was barred with long clouds, fleeting on a chill wind, when they arose again. Under the cold moon they went on once more, as swift as by the light of <name type="DATE">day</name>.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Ho</name>urs passed and still they rode on. <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> nodded and would have fallen from his seat, if <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> had not clutched and shaken him. <name type="PERSON">Hasufel</name> and <name type="GPE">Arod</name>, weary but proud, followed their tireless leader, a grey shadow before them hardly to he seen. The miles went by. The waxing moon sank into the cloudy <name type="LOC">West</name>.</p>
<p>A bitter chill came into the air. Slowly in the <name type="LOC">East</name> the dark faded to a cold grey. Red shafts of light leapt above the black walls of the <name type="ORG">Emyn Muil</name> far away upon their left. <name type="PERSON">Dawn</name> came clear and b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght; a wind swept across their path, rushing through the bent grasses. Suddenly <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>fax stood still and neighed. <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> pointed ahead.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok!'</q> he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed, and they lifted their tired eyes. Before them stood the mountains of the <name type="LOC">South</name>: white-tipped and streaked with black. The grass-lands rolled against the hills that clustered at their feet, and flowed up into many valleys still dim and dark, untouched by the light of <name type="TIME">dawn</name>, winding their way into the heart of the great mountains. Immediately before the travellers the widest of these <name type="LOC">glen</name>s opened like a long <name type="LOC">gulf</name> among the hills. <name type="LOC">Far</name> inward they glimpsed a tumbled mountain-mass with <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> tall peak; at the mouth of the <name type="GPE">vale</name> there stood like sentinel a l<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>ly h<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name>. <name type="QUANTITY">About its feet</name> there flowed, as a thread of silver, the stream that issued from the <name type="GPE">dale</name>; upon its brow they caught, still far away, a glint in the <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing sun, a glimmer of gold. <q>'Speak, <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'Tell us what you see there before us!'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> gazed ahead, shading his eyes from the level shafts of the new-<name type="GPE">ri</name>sen sun. <q>'I see a white stream that comes down from the snows,'</q> he said. <q>'Where it issues from the shadow of the <name type="GPE">vale</name> a green hill <name type="GPE">ri</name>ses upon the east. A dike and mighty wall and thorny <name type="PERSON">fen</name>ce encircle it. Within there <name type="GPE">ri</name>se the roofs of houses; and in the midst, set upon a green terrace, there stands aloft a great hall of <name type="ORG">Men</name>. And it seems to my eyes that it is thatched with gold. The light of it shines far over the land. Golden, too, are the posts of its doors. There men in b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght mail stand; but all else within the courts are yet asleep.'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="ORG">Edoras</name> those courts are called,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, <q>'and <name type="GPE">Meduseld</name> is that golden hall. There dwells Th�oden son of <name type="PERSON">Thengel</name>, <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g of the <name type="PERSON">Mark</name> of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>. We are come with the <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing of the <name type="DATE">day</name>. Now the road lies plain to see before us. But we must <name type="GPE">ri</name>de more wa<name type="GPE">ri</name>ly; for war is abroad, and the Rohir<name type="GPE">ri</name>m, the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>rse-lords, do not sleep, even if it seem so from afar. Draw no weapon, speak no haughty word, I counsel you all, until we are come before Th�oden's seat.'</q></p>
<p><name type="TIME">The <name type="TIME">morning</name></name> was b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght and clear about them, and birds were singing, when the travellers came to the stream. It ran down swiftly into the plain, and beyond the feet of the hills turned across their path in a wide bend, flowing away east to feed the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>wash far off in its reed-choked beds. The land was green: in the wet meads and along the grassy borders of the stream grew many willow-trees. Already in this southern land they were blushing red at their fingertips. Feeling the approach of sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng. Over the stream there was a <name type="ORG">ford</name> between low banks much trampled by the passage of horses. The travellers passed over and came upon a wide rutted track leading towards the uplands.</p>
<p>At the foot of the walled hill the way ran under the shadow of many mounds, high and green. Upon their western sides the grass was white as with a d<name type="GPE">ri</name>fted snow: small flowers sprang there like countless stars amid the turf.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w fair are the b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght eyes in the grass! <name type="PERSON">Evermind</name> they are called, _simbelmyn�_ in this land of <name type="ORG">Men</name>, for they blossom in <name type="DATE">all the seasons of <name type="DATE">the <name type="DATE">year</name></name></name>, and grow where dead men rest. Behold! we are come to the great barrows where the sires of Th�oden sleep.'</q> <q>'<name type="CARDINAL">Seven</name> mounds upon the left, and <name type="CARDINAL">nine</name> upon the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'Many long lives of men it is since <name type="FAC">the golden hall</name> was built.'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="CARDINAL">Five</name> <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name> times have the red leaves fallen in <name type="GPE">Mirkwood</name> in my home since then,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>, <q>'and but a little while does that seem to us.'</q></p>
<p><q>'But to the <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s of the <name type="PERSON">Mark</name> it seems so <name type="DATE">long ago</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>, <q>'that the raising of this house is but a memory of song, and <name type="DATE">the <name type="DATE">year</name></name>s before are lost in the mist of time. Now they call this land their home, their own, and their speech is sundered from their northern kin.'</q> Then he began to chant softly in a slow tongue unknown to the <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name> and <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Dwarf</name>; yet they lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed, for there was a strong music in it.</p>
<p><q>'That, I guess, is the language of the Rohir<name type="GPE">ri</name>m,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>; <q>'for it is like to this land itself; <name type="GPE">ri</name>ch and rolling in part, and else hard and stern as the mountains. But I cannot guess what it means, save that it is laden with the sadness of Mortal <name type="ORG">Men</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q>'It runs thus in the Common <name type="ORG">Speech</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>, 'as near as I can make it.</p>
<p>Where now the horse and the <name type="GPE">ri</name>der? Where is the horn that was blowing?</p>
<p>Where is the helm and the <name type="PERSON">hauberk</name>, and the b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght <name type="PERSON">hai</name>r flowing?</p>
<p>Where is the hand on the harpst<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng, and <name type="ORG">the red fire</name> glowing?</p>
<p>Where is the sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng and the harvest and the tall corn growing?</p>
<p>They have passed like rain on the mountain, like a wind in the meadow;</p>
<p><name type="DATE">The <name type="DATE">day</name></name>s have g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> down in the <name type="LOC">West</name> behind the hills into shadow.</p>
<p>Who shall gather the smoke of the dead wood burning,</p>
<p>Or behold the flowing <name type="DATE">year</name>s from the <name type="LOC">Sea</name> returning?</p>
<p>Thus spoke a forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> poet <name type="DATE">long ago</name> in <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>, recalling how tall and fair was <name type="PERSON">Eorl</name> the Young, who rode down out of the <name type="LOC">North</name>; and there were wings upon the feet of his <name type="PERSON">steed</name>, <name type="PERSON">Felar�f</name>, father of horses. So men still sing in the <name type="TIME">evening</name>.'</p>
<p>With these words the travellers passed the silent mounds. Following the winding way up the green shoulders of the hills, they came at last to the wide wind-swept walls and the gates of <name type="ORG">Edoras</name>.</p>
<p>There sat many men in b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght mail, who sprang at once to their feet and barred the way with spears. <q>'Stay, strangers here unknown!'</q> they c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed in the tongue of the <name type="ORG">Ridder<name type="PERSON">mar</name>k</name>, demanding the names and errand of the strangers. Wonder was in their eyes but little f<name type="GPE">ri</name>endliness; and they looked darkly upon <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>.</p>
<p><q>'Well do I understand your speech,'</q> he answered in the same language; <q>'yet few strangers do so. Why then do you not speak in the Common Tongue, as is the cus<name type="PERSON">tom</name> in the <name type="LOC">West</name>, if you wish to be answered?'</q></p>
<p><q>'It is the will of Th�oden <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g that n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> should enter his gates, save those who know our tongue and are our f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends,'</q> replied <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the guards. <q>'N<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> are welcome here in <name type="DATE">day</name>s of war but our own folk, and those that come from <name type="GPE">Mund<name type="GPE">burg</name></name> in the land of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>. Who are you that come heedless over the plain thus strangely clad, <name type="GPE">ri</name>ding horses like to our own horses? <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ng have we kept guard here, and we have watched you from afar. Never have we seen other <name type="GPE">ri</name>ders so strange, nor any horse more proud than is <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of these that bear you. He is <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> of the _<name type="ORG">Mearas</name>_, unless our eyes are cheated by some spell. Say, are you not a wizard, some spy from <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>, or phan<name type="PERSON">tom</name>s of his craft? Speak now and be swift!'</q></p>
<p><q>'We are no phan<name type="PERSON">tom</name>s,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>, <q>'nor do your eyes cheat you. For indeed these are your own horses that we <name type="GPE">ri</name>de, as you knew well are you asked, I guess. But seldom does thief <name type="GPE">ri</name>de home to the stable. Here are <name type="PERSON">Hasufel</name> and <name type="GPE">Arod</name>, that �omer, the <name type="ORDINAL">Third</name> Marshal of the <name type="PERSON">Mark</name>, lent to us, <name type="CARDINAL">only <name type="CARDINAL">two</name></name> <name type="DATE">day</name>s ago. We b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng them back now, even as we promised him. Has not �omer then returned and given warning of our coming?'</q></p>
<p>A troubled look came into the guard's eyes. <q>'Of �omer I have naught to say,'</q> he answered. <q>'If what you tell me is truth, then doubtless Th�oden will have heard of it. <name type="DATE">May</name>be your coming was not wholly unlooked-for. It is but <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> <name type="TIME">night</name>s ago that <name type="ORG">Worm</name>tongue came to us and said that by the will of Th�oden no stranger should pass these gates.'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="ORG">Worm</name>tongue?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, looking sharply at the guard. <q>'Say no more! My errand is not to <name type="ORG">Worm</name>tongue, but to the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd of the <name type="PERSON">Mark</name> himself. I am in haste. Will you not go or send to say that we are come?'</q> His eyes glinted under his deep brows as he bent his gaze upon the man.</p>
<p><q>'Yes, I will go,'</q> he answered slowly. 'But what names shall I report? And what shall I say of you? Old and weary you seem now, and yet you are fell and g<name type="GPE">ri</name>m beneath, I deem'</p>
<p><q>'Well do you see and speak,'</q> said the wizard. <q>'For I am <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. I have returned. And behold! I too b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng back a horse. Here is <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>fax the Great, whom no other hand can tame. And here beside me is <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> son of <name type="ORG">Arathorn</name>, the heir of <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>gs, and it is to <name type="GPE">Mund<name type="GPE">burg</name></name> that he goes. Here also are <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> the <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name> and <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> the <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Dwarf</name>, our comrades. Go now and say to your master that we are at his gates and would have speech with him, if he will permit us to come into his hall.'</q> <q>'Strange names you give indeed! But I will report them as you bid and learn my master's will,'</q> said the guard. <q>'Wait here a little while, and f will b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng you such answer as seems good to him. Do not hope too much! These are dark <name type="DATE">day</name>s.'</q> He went swiftly away, leaving the strangers in the watchful keeping of his comrades. After some time he returned. <q>'Follow me!'</q> he said. <q>'Th�oden gives you leave to enter; but any weapon that you bear; be it only a staff, you must leave on the threshold. The <name type="GPE">doorwardens</name> will keep them.'</q></p>
<p>The dark gates were swung open. The travellers entered, walking in file behind their guide. They found a broad path, paved with hewn st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s, now winding upward, now climbing in short flights of well-laid steps. Many houses built of wood and many dark doors they passed. Beside the way in a st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> channel a stream of clear water flowed, sparkling and chatte<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng. At length they came to the crown of the hill. There stood a high platform above a green terrace, at the foot of which a b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng gushed from a st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> carved in the likeness of a horse's head; beneath was a wide basin from which the water. spilled and <name type="ORG">fed</name> <name type="DATE">the fall</name>ing stream. Up the green terrace went a stair of st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, high and broad, and on either side of the topmost step were st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name><name type="PERSON">-he</name>wn sea, There sat other guards, with drawn swords laid upon their knees. Their golden <name type="PERSON">hai</name>r was braided on their shoulders the sun was blaz<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>d upon their green shields, their long corslets were burnished b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght, and when they rose taller they seemed than mortal men.</p>
<p><q>'There are the doors before you,'</q> said the guide. <q>'I must return now to my duty at the gate. <name type="LOC">Far</name>ewell! And may the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd of the <name type="PERSON">Mark</name> be gracious to you!'</q></p>
<p>He turned and went swiftly back down the road. The others climbed the long stair under the eyes of the tall watchmen. Silent they stood now above and spoke no word, until <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> stepped out upon the paved terrace at the stairs head. Then suddenly with clear voices they spoke a courteous greeting in their own tongue.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Hail</name>, corners from afar!' they said, and they turned the hilts of their swords towards the travellers in token of peace. Green gems flashed in the sunlight. Then <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the guards stepped forward and spoke in the Common <name type="ORG">Speech</name>.</p>
<p><q>'I am the <name type="ORG">Door</name>ward of Th�oden,'</q> he said. <q>'<name type="ORG">H�ma</name> is my name. Here I must bid you lay aside your weapons before you enter.'</q></p>
<p>Then <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> gave into his hand his silver-hafted knife, his quiver and his bow. <q>'Keep these well,'</q> he said, <q>'for they come from the Golden <name type="PERSON">Wood</name> and the <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> of <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>thl�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en gave them to me.'</q></p>
<p>Wonder came into the man's eyes, and he laid the weapons hastily by the wall, as if he feared to handle them. <q>'No man will touch them I promise you,'</q> he said.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> stood a while hesitating. <q>'It is not my will,'</q> he said, <q>'to put aside my sword or to deliver And�<name type="GPE">ri</name>l to the hand of any other man.'</q></p>
<p><q>'It is the will of Th�oden,'</q> said <name type="ORG">H�ma</name>.</p>
<p><q>'It is not clear to me that the will of Th�oden son of <name type="PERSON">Thengel</name> even though he be lord of the <name type="PERSON">Mark</name>, should prevail over the will of <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> son of <name type="ORG">Arathorn</name>, <name type="PERSON">Elen</name>dil's heir of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q>'This is the house of Th�oden, not of <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>, even were he <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> in the seat of <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name>,'</q> said <name type="ORG">H�ma</name>, stepping swiftly before the doors and bar<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng the way. His sword was now in his hand and the point towards the strangers.</p>
<p><q>'This is idle talk,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'Needless is Th�oden's demand, but it is useless to refuse. A king will have his way in his own hall, be it folly or wisdom.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Truly,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'And I would do as the master of the house bade me, were this only a <name type="ORG">woodman</name>'s cot, if I bore now any sword but And�<name type="GPE">ri</name>l.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Whatever its name may be,'</q> said <name type="ORG">H�ma</name>, <q>'here you shall lay it, if you would not fight al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> against all the men in <name type="ORG">Edoras</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Not al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>, finge<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng the blade of his axe, and looking darkly up at the guard, as if he were a young tree that <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> had a mind to fell. <q>'Not al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>!'</q></p>
<p><q>'Come, come!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'We are all f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends here. Or should be; for the laughter of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> will be our only reward, if we quarrel. My errand is pressing. Here at least is _my_ sword, goodman <name type="ORG">H�ma</name>. Keep it well. <name type="PERSON">Glamd<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng</name> it is called, for the <name type="ORG">Elves</name> made it <name type="DATE">long ago</name>. Now let me pass. Come, <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>!'</q></p>
<p>Slowly <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> unbuckled his belt and himself set his sword up<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght against the wall. <q>'Here I set it,'</q> he said; <q>'but I command you not to touch it, nor to permit any other to lay hand on it. In this elvish heath dwells the <name type="PRODUCT">Blade</name> that was Broken and has been made again. <name type="PERSON">Telchar</name> <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> wrought it in the deeps of time. Death shall come to any man that draws <name type="PERSON">Elen</name>dil's sword save <name type="PERSON">Elen</name>dil's heir.'</q></p>
<p>The guard stepped back and looked with amazement on <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. 'It seems that you are come on the wings of song out of the forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> <name type="DATE">day</name>s he said. It shall be, lord, as you command.</p>
<p><q>'Well,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>, <q>'if it has And�<name type="GPE">ri</name>l to keep it company, my axe may stay here, too, without shame'; and he laid it on the floor. 'Now then, if all is as you wish, let us go and speak with your master.'</q></p>
<p>The guard still hesitated. <q>'Your staff,'</q> he said to <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'Forgive me, but that too must be left at the doors.'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="NORP">Foolish</name>ness!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'Prudence is <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> thing, but discourtesy is another. I am old. If I may not lean on my stick as I go, then I will sit out here, until it pleases Th�oden to hobble out himself to speak with me.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> laughed. <q>'Every man has something too dear to trust to another. But would you part an old man from his support? Come, will you not let us enter?'</q></p>
<p><q>'The staff in the hand of a wizard may be more than a prop for age' said <name type="ORG">H�ma</name>. He looked hard at the ash-staff on which <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> leaned. 'Yet in doubt a man of worth will trust to his own wisdom. I believe you are f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends and folk worthy of honour, who have no evil purpose. You may go in.'</q></p>
<p>The guards now lifted the heavy bars of the doors and swung them slowly inwards grumbling on their great hinges. The travellers entered. Inside it seemed dark and warm after the clear air upon the hill. The hall was long and wide and filled with shadows and <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> lights; mighty pillars upheld its lofty roof. But here and there b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght sunbeams fell in glimme<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng shafts from the eastern windows, high under the deep eaves. <name type="PERSON">Thr</name>ough the louver in the roof, above the thin wisps of issuing smoke, the sky showed pale and blue. As their eyes changed, the travellers perceived that the floor was paved with st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s of many hues; bran<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g runes and strange devices intertwined beneath their feet. They saw now that the pillars were <name type="GPE">ri</name>chly carved, gleaming dully with gold and <name type="CARDINAL">half</name>-seen colours. Many woven cloths were hung upon the walls, and over their wide spaces <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ched figures of ancient legend, some dim with <name type="DATE">year</name>s, some darkling in the shade. But upon <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> form the sunlight fell: a young man upon a white horse. He was blowing a great horn, and his yellow <name type="PERSON">hai</name>r was flying in the wind. The horse's head was lifted, and its nost<name type="GPE">ri</name>ls were wide and red as it neighed, smelling battle afar. Foaming water, green and white, rushed and curled about its knees.</p>
<p><q>'Behold <name type="PERSON">Eorl</name> the Young!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'Thus he rode out of the <name type="LOC">North</name> to the <name type="EVENT">Battle</name> of the Field of <name type="PERSON">Celebrant</name>.'</q></p>
<p>Now the <name type="CARDINAL">four</name> companions went forward, past the clear wood-fire burning upon the long h<name type="LOC">earth</name> in the midst of the hall. Then they halted. At the far end of the house, beyond the h<name type="LOC">earth</name> and facing north towards the doors, was a dais with <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> steps; and in the middle of the dais was a great gilded c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>r. Upon it sat a man so bent with age that he seemed almost a dwarf; but his white <name type="PERSON">hai</name>r was long and thick and fell in great braids from beneath a thin golden circle set upon his brow. In the centre upon his forehead sh<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> a single white diamond. His beard was laid like snow upon his knees; but his eyes still burned with a b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght light, glinting as he gazed at the strangers. Behind his c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>r stood a woman clad in white. At his feet upon the steps sat a wizened figure of a man, with a pale wise face and heavy-lidded eyes.</p>
<p>There was a silence. The old man did not move in his c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>r. At length <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> spoke. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Hail</name>, Th�oden son of <name type="PERSON">Thengel</name>! I have returned. For behold! the storm comes, and now all f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends should gather together, lest each singly be destroyed.'</q></p>
<p>Slowly the old man rose to his feet, leaning heavily upon a short black staff with a handle of white b<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>; and now the strangers saw that, bent though he was, he was still tall and must in youth have been high and proud indeed.</p>
<p><q>'I greet you,'</q> he said, <q>'and maybe you look for welcome. But truth to tell your welcome is doubtful here, Master <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. You have ever been a herald of woe. Troubles follow you like crows, and ever the of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>er the worse. I will not deceive you: when I heard that <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>fax had come back <name type="GPE">ri</name>derless, I rejoiced at the return of the horse, but still more at the lack of the <name type="GPE">ri</name>der; and when �omer brought the tidings that you had g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> at last to your long home, I did not mourn. But news from afar is seldom sooth. Here you come again! And with you come evils worse than before, as might be expected. Why should I welcome you, <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> <name type="ORG">Stormcrow</name>? Tell me that.'</q> Slowly he sat down again in his c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>r.</p>
<p><q>'You speak justly, lord,'</q> said the pale man sitting upon the steps of the dais. <q>'It is not yet <name type="CARDINAL">five</name> <name type="DATE">day</name>s since the bitter tidings came that <name type="PERSON">Th�odred</name> your son was slain upon the <name type="LOC">West</name> <name type="DATE">March</name>es: your <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght hand, <name type="ORDINAL">Second</name> Marshal Of the <name type="PERSON">Mark</name>. In �omer there is little trust. Few men would be left to guard your walls, if he had been allowed to rule. And even now we learn from <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> that the Dark <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd is stir<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng in the <name type="LOC">East</name>. Such is the <name type="TIME">hour</name> in which this <name type="PERSON">wan</name>derer chooses to return. Why indeed should we welcome you, Master <name type="ORG">Stormcrow</name>? _L�thspell_ I name you, Ill-news; and ill news is an ill guest they say.'</q> He laughed g<name type="GPE">ri</name>mly, as he lifted his heavy lids for a moment and gazed on the strangers with dark eyes.</p>
<p><q>'You are held wise, my f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end <name type="ORG">Worm</name>tongue, and are doubtless a great support to your master,'</q> answered <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> in a soft voice. <q>'Yet in <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> ways may a man come with evil tidings. lie may be a worker of evil; or he may be such as leaves well al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, and comes only to b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng aid in time of need.'</q></p>
<p><q>'That is so,'</q> said <name type="ORG">Worm</name>tongue; <q>'but there is <name type="CARDINAL">a <name type="ORDINAL">third</name></name> kind: pickers of b<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s, meddlers in other men's sorrows, car<name type="GPE">ri</name>on-fowl that grow fat on war. What aid have you ever brought, <name type="ORG">Stormcrow</name>? And what aid do you b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng now? It was aid from us that you sought last time that you were here. Then my lord bade you Choose any horse that you would and be g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>; and to the wonder of all you took <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>fax in your insolence. My lord was sorely g<name type="GPE">ri</name>eved; yet to some it seemed that to speed you from the land the p<name type="GPE">ri</name>ce was not too great. I guess that it is likely to turn out the same once more: you will seek aid rather than render it. Do you b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng men? Do you b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng horses, swords, spears? That I would call aid; that is our present need. But who are these that follow at your tail? <name type="PERSON">Thr</name>ee ragged <name type="PERSON">wan</name>derers in grey, and you yourself the most beggar-like of the <name type="CARDINAL">four</name>!'</q></p>
<p><q>'The courtesy of your hall is somewhat lessened of late, Th�oden son of <name type="PERSON">Thengel</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'Has not the messenger from your gate reported the names of my companions? Seldom has any lord of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> received <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> such guests. Weapons they have laid at your doors that are worth many a mortal man, even the mightiest. <name type="ORG">Grey</name> is their raiment, for the <name type="ORG">Elves</name> clad them, and thus they have passed through the shadow of great pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ls to your hall.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Then it is true, as �omer reported, that you are in league with the Sorceress of the Golden <name type="PERSON">Wood</name>?'</q> said <name type="ORG">Worm</name>tongue. <q>'It is not to be wondered at: webs of deceit were ever woven in <name type="PERSON">Dwimordene</name>.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> strode a pace forward, but felt suddenly the hand of <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> clutch him by the shoulder, and he halted, standing stiff as st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>.</p>
<p>In <name type="PERSON">Dwimordene</name>, in L�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en</p>
<p>Seldom have walked the feet of <name type="ORG">Men</name>,</p>
<p>Few mortal eyes have seen the light</p>
<p>That lies there ever, long and b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Galad<name type="GPE">ri</name>el</name>! <name type="PERSON">Galad<name type="GPE">ri</name>el</name>!</p>
<p>Clear is the water of your well;</p>
<p>White is the star in your white hand;</p>
<p>Un<name type="PERSON">mar</name>red, unstained is leaf and land</p>
<p>In <name type="PERSON">Dwimordene</name>, in L�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en</p>
<p>More fair than thoughts of Mortal <name type="ORG">Men</name>.</p>
<p>Thus <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> softly sang, and then suddenly he changed. Casting his tattered cloak aside, he stood up and leaned no longer on his staff; and he spoke in a clear cold voice. <q>'The wise speak only of what they know, <name type="PERSON">Gr�ma</name> son of G�lm�d. A witless worm have you become. Therefore be silent, and keep your forked tongue behind your teeth. I have not passed through fire and death to bandy crooked words with a serving-man till the lightning falls.'</q> He raised his staff. There was a roll of thunder. The sunlight was blotted out from the eastern windows; the whole hall became suddenly dark as <name type="TIME">night</name>. The fire faded to sullen embers. Only <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> could be seen, standing white and tall before the blackened h<name type="LOC">earth</name>.</p>
<p>In the gloom they heard the hiss of <name type="ORG">Worm</name>tongue's voice: <q>'Did I not counsel you, lord, to forbid his staff? That fool, <name type="ORG">H�ma</name>, has betrayed us!'</q> There was a flash as if lightning had cloven the roof. Then all was silent. <name type="ORG">Worm</name>tongue sprawled on his face.</p>
<p><q>'Now Th�oden son of <name type="PERSON">Thengel</name>, will you hearken to me?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'Do you ask for help?'</q> He lifted his staff and pointed to a high window. There the darkness seemed to clear, and through the opening could be seen, high and far, a patch of shining sky. <q>'Not all is dark. Take courage, <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd of the <name type="PERSON">Mark</name>; for better help you will not find. No counsel have I to give to those that despair. Yet counsel I could give, and words I could speak to you. Will you hear them? They are not for all ears. I bid you come out before your doors and look abroad. Too long have you sat in shadows and trusted to twisted tales and crooked promptings.'</q></p>
<p>Slowly Th�oden left his c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>r. A faint light grew in the hall again. The woman has<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed to the king's side, taking his arm, and with falte<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng steps the old man came down from the dais and paced softly through the hall. <name type="ORG">Worm</name>tongue remained lying on the floor. They came to the doors and <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> knocked.</p>
<p><q>'Open!'</q> he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed. <q>'The <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd of the <name type="PERSON">Mark</name> comes forth!'</q></p>
<p>The doors rolled back and a keen air came whistling in. A wind was blowing on the hill. <q>'Send your guards down to the stairs foot,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'And you, lady, leave him a while with me. I will care for him.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Go, <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name> sister-daughter!'</q> said the old king. <q>'The time for fear is past.'</q></p>
<p>The woman turned and went slowly into the house. As she passed the doors she turned and looked back. Grave and thoughtful was her glance, as she looked on the king with cool pity in her eyes. Very fair was her face, and her long <name type="PERSON">hai</name>r was like a <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver of gold. Slender and tall she was in her white robe girt with silver; but strong she seemed and stern as steel, a daughter of kings. Thus <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> for the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> time in the full light of <name type="DATE">day</name> beheld <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name>, <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>, and thought her fair, fair and cold, like <name type="TIME">a <name type="TIME">morning</name></name> of pale sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng that is not yet come to womanhood. And she now was suddenly aware of him: tall heir of kings, wise with many <name type="DATE">winter</name>s, greycloaked. Hiding a power that yet she felt. For a moment still as st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> she stood, then turning swiftly she was g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>.</p>
<p><q>'Now, lord,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, <q>'look out upon your land! Breathe the free air again!'</q></p>
<p>From the porch upon the top of the high terrace they could see beyond the stream the green fields of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> fading into distant grey. Curtains of wind-blown rain were slanting down. The sky above and to the west was still dark with thunder, and lightning far away flickered among the tops of hidden hills. But the wind had shifted to the north, and already the storm that had come out of the <name type="LOC">East</name> was receding, rolling away southward to the sea. Suddenly through a rent in the clouds behind them a shaft of sun stabbed down. The falling showers gleamed like silver, and far away the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver glittered like a shimme<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng glass.</p>
<p><q>'It is not so dark here,'</q> said Th�oden.</p>
<p><q>'No,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'Nor does age lie so heavily on your shoulders as some would have you think. Cast aside your prop!'</q></p>
<p>From the king's hand the black staff fell clatte<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng on the st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s. He drew himself up, slowly, as a man that is stiff from long bending over some dull toil. Now tall and straight he stood, and his eyes were blue as he looked into the opening sky.</p>
<p><q>'Dark have been my dreams of late,'</q> he said, <q>'but I feel as <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> new-awakened. I would now that you had come before, <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. For I fear that already you have come too late, only to see the last <name type="DATE">day</name>s of my house. Not long now shall stand the high hall which <name type="ORG">Brego</name> son of <name type="PERSON">Eorl</name> built. <name type="ORG">Fire</name> shall devour the high seat. What is to be <name type="PERSON">don</name>e?'</q></p>
<p><q>'Much,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'But <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> send for �omer. Do I not guess <name type="GPE">ri</name>ghtly that you hold him p<name type="GPE">ri</name>s<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>r, by the counsel of <name type="PERSON">Gr�ma</name>, of him that all save you name the <name type="ORG">Worm</name>tongue?'</q></p>
<p><q>'It is true,'</q> said Th�oden. <q>'He had rebelled against my commands, and threa<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed death to <name type="PERSON">Gr�ma</name> in my hall.'</q></p>
<p>'A man may love you and yet not love <name type="ORG">Worm</name>tongue or his counsels' said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>.</p>
<p><q>'That may be. I will do as you ask. Call <name type="ORG">H�ma</name> to me. Since he proved untrusty as a doorward, let him become an errand-runner. The guilty shall b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng the guilty to judgement,'</q> said Th�oden, and his voice was g<name type="GPE">ri</name>m, yet he looked at <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> and smiled and as he did so many lines of care were smoothed away and did not return.</p>
<p>When <name type="ORG">H�ma</name> had been summ<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>d and had g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> led Th�oden to a st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> seat, and then sat himself before the king upon the topmost stair. <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> and his companions stood nearby.</p>
<p><q>'There is no time to tell all that you should hear,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'Yet if my hope is not cheated, a time will come ere long when I can speak more fully. Behold! you are come into a pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>l greater even than the wit of <name type="ORG">Worm</name>tongue could weave into your dreams. But see! you dream no longer. You live. <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> and <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> do not stand al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. The enemy is strong beyond our reckoning, yet we have a hope at which he has not guessed.'</q></p>
<p>Quickly now <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> spoke. His voice was low and <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret, and n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> save the king heard what he said. But ever as he spoke the light sh<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ghter in Th�oden's eye, and at the last he rose from his seat to his full h<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name>, and <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> beside him, and together they looked out from the high place towards the <name type="LOC">East</name>.</p>
<p><q>'Ve<name type="GPE">ri</name>ly,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, now in a loud voice, keen and clear, <q>'that way lies our hope, where sits our greatest fear. Doom hangs still on a thread. Yet hope there is still, if we can but stand unconquered for a little while.'</q></p>
<p>The others too now turned their eyes eastward. Over the sunde<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng leagues of land, far away they gazed to the edge of sight, and hope and fear bore their thoughts still on, beyond dark mountains to the Land of <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>. Where now was the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>-bearer? <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w thin indeed was the thread upon which doom still hung! It seemed to <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>, as he strained his farseeing eyes, that he caught a glint of white: far away perchance the sun twinkled on a pinnacle of the <name type="FAC">Tower</name> of <name type="ORG">Guard</name>. And further still, endlessly remote and yet a present threat, there was a tiny tongue of flame.</p>
<p>Slowly Th�oden sat down again, as if wea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ness still struggled to master him against the will of <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. He turned and looked at his great house. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Alas</name>!'</q> he said, <q>'that these evil <name type="DATE">day</name>s should be mine, and should come in my old age instead of that peace which I have earned. <name type="PERSON">Alas</name> for <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> the brave! The young pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>sh and the old linger, withe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng.'</q> He clutched his knees with his w<name type="GPE">ri</name>nkled hands.</p>
<p><q>'Your fingers would remember their old strength better, if they grasped a sword-hilt,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>.</p>
<p>Th�oden rose and put his hand to his side; but no sword hung at his belt. <q>'Where has <name type="PERSON">Gr�ma</name> stowed it?'</q> he muttered under his breath.</p>
<p><q>'Take this, dear lord!'</q> said a clear voice. <q>'It was ever at your service.'</q> <name type="CARDINAL">Two</name> men had come softly up the stair and stood now a few steps from the top. �omer was there. No helm was on his head, no mail was on his breast, but in his hand he held a drawn sword; and as he knelt he offered the hilt to his master.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w comes this?'</q> said Th�oden sternly. He turned towards �omer and the men looked in wonder at him, standing now proud and erect. Where was the old man whom they had left crou<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g in his c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>r or leaning on his stick?</p>
<p><q>'It is my doing, lord,'</q> said <name type="ORG">H�ma</name>, trembling. I understood that �omer was to be set free. Such joy was in my heart that maybe I have erred. Yet, since he was free again, and he a Marshal of the <name type="PERSON">Mark</name>,! brought him his sword as he bade me.'</p>
<p><q>'To lay at your feet, my lord,'</q> said �omer.</p>
<p>For a moment of silence Th�oden stood looking down at �omer as he knelt still before him. Neither moved.</p>
<p><q>'Will you not take the sword?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>.</p>
<p>Slowly Th�oden stretched forth his hand. As his fingers took the hilt, it seemed to the watchers that firmness and strength returned to his thin arm. Suddenly he lifted the blade and swung it shimme<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng and whistling in the air. Then he gave a great cry. His voice rang clear as he chanted in the tongue of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> a call to arms.</p>
<p>_A<name type="GPE">ri</name>se now, a<name type="GPE">ri</name>se, <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s of Th�oden!</p>
<p>Dire deeds awake, dark is it eastward.</p>
<p>Let horse be b<name type="GPE">ri</name>dled, horn be sounded!</p>
<p>Forth <name type="PERSON">Eorl</name>ingas!_</p>
<p>The guards, thinking that they were summ<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>d, sprang up the stair. They looked at their lord in amazement, and then as <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> man they drew their swords and laid them at his feet. <q>'Command us!'</q> they said.</p>
<p><q>'_<name type="LOC">West</name>u Th�oden h�l!_' c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed �omer. 'It is a joy to us to see you return into your own. Never again shall it be said, <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, that you come only with g<name type="GPE">ri</name>ef!'</q></p>
<p><q>'Take back your sword, �omer, sister-son!'</q> said the king. <q>'Go, <name type="ORG">H�ma</name>, and seek my own sword! <name type="PERSON">Gr�ma</name> has it in his keeping. B<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng him to me also. Now, <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, you said that you had counsel to give, if I would hear it. What is your counsel?'</q></p>
<p><q>'You have yourself already taken it,'</q> answered <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'To put your trust in �omer, rather than in a man of crooked mind. To cast aside regret and fear. To do the deed at hand. Every man that can <name type="GPE">ri</name>de should be sent west at once, as �omer counselled you: we must <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> destroy the threat of <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>, while we have time. If we fail, we fall. If we succeed � then we will face the next task. Meanwhile your people that are left, the women and the children and the old, should stay to the refuges that you have in the mountains. Were they not prepared against just such an evil <name type="DATE">day</name> as this? Let them take provision, but delay not, nor burden themselves with treasures, great or small. It is their lives that are at stake.'</q></p>
<p><q>'This counsel seems good to me now,'</q> said Th�oden. <q>'Let all my folk get ready! But you my guests-truly you said, <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, that the courtesy of my hall is lessened. You have <name type="GPE">ri</name>dden through the <name type="TIME">night</name>, and the <name type="TIME">morning</name> wears away. You have had neither sleep nor food. A guest-house shall be made ready: there you shall sleep, when you have ea<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Nay</name>, lord,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'There is no rest yet for the weary. The men of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> must <name type="GPE">ri</name>de forth to<name type="DATE">day</name>, and we will <name type="GPE">ri</name>de with them, axe, sword, and bow. We did not b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng them to rest against your wall, <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd of the <name type="PERSON">Mark</name>. And I promised �omer that my sword and his should be drawn together.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Now indeed there is hope of victory!'</q> said �omer.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>pe, yes,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'But <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard is strong. And other pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ls draw ever nearer. Do not delay, Th�oden, when we are g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. Lead your people swiftly to the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>ld of <name type="PERSON">Dunharrow</name> in the hills!'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Nay</name>, <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>!'</q> said the king. <q>'You do not know your own skill in healing. It shall not be so. I myself will go to war, to fall in the front of the battle, if it must be. Thus shall I sleep better.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Then even the defeat of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> will be glo<name type="GPE">ri</name>ous in song,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. The armed men that stood near clashed their weapons, crying: <q>'The <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd of the <name type="PERSON">Mark</name> will <name type="GPE">ri</name>de! Forth <name type="PERSON">Eorl</name>ingas!'</q></p>
<p><q>'But your people must not be both unarmed and shepherdless' said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. 'Who shall guide them and govern them in your place?'</q></p>
<p><q>'I will take thought for that ere I go,'</q> answered Th�oden. <q>'Here comes my counsellor.'</q></p>
<p>At that moment <name type="ORG">H�ma</name> came again from the hall. Behind him c<name type="GPE">ri</name>nging <name type="CARDINAL">between <name type="CARDINAL">two</name></name> other men, came <name type="PERSON">Gr�ma</name> the <name type="ORG">Worm</name>tongue. His face was very white. His eyes blinked in the sunlight. <name type="ORG">H�ma</name> knelt and presented to Th�oden a long sword in a scabbard clasped with gold and set with green gems. <q>'Here, lord, is <name type="PRODUCT">Herug<name type="GPE">ri</name>m</name>, your ancient blade,'</q> he said. <q>'It was found in his chest. <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>th was he to render up the keys. Many other things are there which men have missed.'</q></p>
<p><q>'You lie,'</q> said <name type="ORG">Worm</name>tongue. <q>'And this sword your master himself gave into my keeping.'</q></p>
<p><q>'And he now requires it of you again,'</q> said Th�oden. <q>'Does that displease you?'</q></p>
<p><q>'Assuredly not. lord,'</q> said <name type="ORG">Worm</name>tongue. <q>'I care for you and yours as best I may. But do not weary yourself, or tax too heavily your strength. Let others deal with these irksome guests. Your meat is about to be set on the board. Will you not go to it?'</q></p>
<p><q>'I will,'</q> said Th�oden. <q>'And let food for my guests be set on the board beside me. The host <name type="GPE">ri</name>des to<name type="DATE">day</name>. Send the heralds forth! Let them summon all who dwell nigh! Every man and strong lad able to bear arms, all who have horses, let them be ready in the saddle at the gate ere the <name type="ORG">sec</name>ond <name type="TIME">hour</name> from <name type="TIME">noon</name>!'</q></p>
<p><q>'Dear lord!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="ORG">Worm</name>tongue. <q>'It is as I feared. This wizard has bewitched you. Are n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> to be left to de<name type="PERSON">fen</name>d the Golden <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>l of your fathers, and all your treasure? N<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> to guard the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd of the <name type="PERSON">Mark</name>?'</q></p>
<p><q>'If this is bewitchment,'</q> said Th�oden, <q>'it seems to me more wholesome than your whispe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ngs. Your leechcraft ere long would have had me walking on all <name type="CARDINAL">four</name>s like a beast. No, not <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> shall be left, not even <name type="PERSON">Gr�ma</name>. <name type="PERSON">Gr�ma</name> shall <name type="GPE">ri</name>de too. Go! You have yet time to clean the rust from your sword.'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="ORG">Mercy</name>, lord!'</q> whined <name type="ORG">Worm</name>tongue, grovelling on the ground. <q>'Have pity on <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> worn out in your service. Send me not from your side! I at least will stand by you when all others have g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. Do not send your faithful <name type="PERSON">Gr�ma</name> away!'</q></p>
<p><q>'You have my pity,'</q> said Th�oden. <q>'And I do not send you from my side. I go myself to war with my men. I bid you come with me and prove your faith.'</q></p>
<p><name type="ORG">Worm</name>tongue looked from face to face. In his eyes was the hunted look of a beast seeking some gap in the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng of his enemies. He licked his lips with a long pale tongue. <q>'Such a resolve might be expected from a lord of the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>use of <name type="PERSON">Eorl</name>, old though he be,'</q> he said. <q>'But those who truly love him would spare his failing <name type="DATE">year</name>s. Yet I see that I come too late. Others, whom the death of my lord would perhaps g<name type="GPE">ri</name>eve less, have already persuaded him. If I cannot undo their work, hear me at least in this, lord! <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> who knows your mind and honours your commands should be left in <name type="ORG">Edoras</name>. Appoint a faithful steward. Let your counsellor <name type="PERSON">Gr�ma</name> keep all things till your return-and I pray that we may see it, though no wise man will deem it hopeful.'</q></p>
<p>�omer laughed. <q>'And if that plea does not excuse you from war, most noble <name type="ORG">Worm</name>tongue,'</q> he said, what office of less honour would you accept? To carry a sack of meal up into the mountains-if any man would trust you with it?'</p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Nay</name>, �omer, you do not fully understand the mind of Master <name type="ORG">Worm</name>tongue,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, turning his piercing glance upon him. <q>'He is bold and cunning. Even now he plays a game with pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>l and wins a throw. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>urs of my precious time he has wasted already. 'Down snake!'</q> he said suddenly in a ter<name type="GPE">ri</name>ble voice. <q>'Down on your belly! <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w long is it since <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> bought you? What was the promised p<name type="GPE">ri</name>ce? When all the men were dead, you were to pick your share of the treasure, and take the woman you desire? Too long have you watched her under your eyelids and haunted her steps.'</q></p>
<p>�omer grasped his sword. <q>'That I knew already,'</q> he muttered. <q>'For that reason I would have slain him before, forgetting the law of the hall. But there are other reasons.'</q> He stepped forward, but <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> stayed him with his hand.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">�owyn</name> is safe now,'</q> he said. <q>'But you, <name type="ORG">Worm</name>tongue, you have <name type="PERSON">don</name>e what you could for your true master. Some reward you have earned at least. Yet <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> is apt to overlook his bargains. I should advise you to go quickly and remind him, lest he forget your faithful service.'</q></p>
<p><q>'You lie,'</q> said <name type="ORG">Worm</name>tongue.</p>
<p><q>'That word comes too oft and easy from your lips,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'I do not lie. See, Th�oden, here is a snake! With safety you cannot take it with you, nor can you leave it behind. To slay it would be just. But it was not always as it now is. Once it was a man, and did you service in its fashion. Give him a horse and let him go at once, wherever he chooses. By his choice you shall judge him.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Do you hear this, <name type="ORG">Worm</name>tongue?'</q> said Th�oden. <q>'This is your choice: to <name type="GPE">ri</name>de with me to war, and let us see in battle whether you are true; or to go now, whither you will. But then, if ever we meet again, I shall not be merciful.'</q></p>
<p>Slowly <name type="ORG">Worm</name>tongue rose. He looked at them with <name type="CARDINAL">half</name>-closed eyes. Last of all he scanned Th�oden's face and opened his mouth as if to speak. Then suddenly he drew himself up. His hands worked. His eyes glittered. Such malice was in them that men stepped back from him. He bared his teeth; and then with a hissing breath he spat before the king's feet, and darting to <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> side, he fled down the stair.</p>
<p><q>'After him!'</q> said Th�oden. <q>'See that he does no harm to any, but do not hurt him or hinder him. Give him a horse, if he wishes it.'</q></p>
<p><q>'And if any will bear him,'</q> said �omer.</p>
<p><name type="CARDINAL">One</name> of the guards ran down the stair. Another went to the well at the foot of the terrace and in his helm drew water. With it he washed clean the st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s that <name type="ORG">Worm</name>tongue had defiled.</p>
<p><q>'Now my guests, come!'</q> said Th�oden. <q>'Come and take such refreshment as haste allows.'</q></p>
<p>They passed back into the great house. Already they heard below them in the town the heralds crying and the war-horns blowing. For the king was to <name type="GPE">ri</name>de forth as soon as the men of the town and those dwelling near could be armed and assembled.</p>
<p>At the king's board sat �omer and the <name type="CARDINAL">four</name> guests, and there also waiting upon the king was the lady <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name>. They ate and drank swiftly. The others were silent while Th�oden questi<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>d <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> concerning <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w far back his treachery goes, who can guess?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. 'He was not always evil. Once I do not doubt that he was the f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>; and even when his heart grew colder, he found you useful still. But for long now he has plotted your ruin, wea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng the mask of F<name type="GPE">ri</name>endship, until he was ready. In <name type="DATE">those <name type="DATE">year</name>s</name> <name type="ORG">Worm</name>tongue's task was easy, and all that you did was swiftly known in <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard; for your land was open, and strangers came and went. And ever <name type="ORG">Worm</name>tongue's whispe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng was in your ears, poisoning your thought, chilling your heart, weakening your limbs, while others watched and could do nothing, for your will was in his keeping.</p>
<p><q>'But when I escaped and warned you, then the mask was torn, for those who would see. After that <name type="ORG">Worm</name>tongue played dangerously, always seeking to delay you, to prevent your full strength being gathered. He was crafty: dulling men's wa<name type="GPE">ri</name>ness, or working on their fears, as served the occasion. Do you not remember how eagerly he urged that no man should be spared on a wildgoose chase northward, when the immediate pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>l was westward? He persuaded you to forbid �omer to pursue the raiding <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s. If �omer had not defied <name type="ORG">Worm</name>tongue's voice speaking with your mouth, those <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s would have reached <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard by now, bea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng a great p<name type="GPE">ri</name>ze. Not indeed that p<name type="GPE">ri</name>ze which <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> desires above all else, but at <name type="CARDINAL">the least <name type="CARDINAL">two</name></name> members of my <name type="ORG">Company</name>, sharers of a <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret hope, of which even to you, lord, I cannot yet speak openly. <name type="PERSON">Dare</name> you think of what they might now be suffe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng, or what <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> might now have learned to our destruction?'</q></p>
<p><q>'I owe much to �omer,'</q> said Th�oden. <q>'Faithful heart may have forward tongue.'</q> <q>'Say also,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, <q>'that to crooked eyes truth may wear a wry face.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Indeed my eyes were almost blind,'</q> said Th�oden. <q>'Most of all I owe to you, my guest. Once again you have come in time. I would give you a gift ere we go, at your own choosing. You have only to name aught that is mine. I reserve now only my sword!'</q></p>
<p><q>'Whether I came in time or not is yet to be seen,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'But as for your gift, lord, I will choose <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> that will fit my need: swift and sure. Give me <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>fax! He was only lent before, if loan we may call it. But now shall <name type="GPE">ri</name>de him into great hazard, setting silver against black: I would not <name type="GPE">ri</name>sk anything that is not my own. And already there is a bond of love between us.'</q></p>
<p><q>'You choose well,'</q> said Th�oden; <q>'and I give him now gladly. Yet it is a great gift. There is n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> like to <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>fax. In him <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the mighty <name type="PERSON">steed</name>s of old has returned. N<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> such shall return again. And to you my other guests I will offer such things as may be found in my armoury. <name type="PRODUCT">Sword</name>s you do not need, but there are helms and coats of mail of cunning work, gifts to my fathers out of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>. Choose from these ere we go, and may they serve you well!'</q></p>
<p>Now men came bea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng raiment of war from the king's hoard and they arrayed <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> and <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> in shining mail. <name type="PERSON">Helm</name>s too they chose, and round shields: their bosses were overlaid with gold and set with gems, green and red and white. <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> took no armour; and <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> needed no coat of <name type="GPE">ri</name>ngs, even if <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> had been found to match his stature, for there was no <name type="PERSON">hauberk</name> in the hoards of <name type="ORG">Edoras</name> of better make than his short corslet forged beneath the <name type="LOC">Mountain</name> in the <name type="LOC">North</name>. But he chose a cap of iron and leather that fitted well upon his round head; and a small shield he also took. It bore the running horse, white upon green, that was the emblem of the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>use of <name type="PERSON">Eorl</name>.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="DATE">May</name> it keep you well!'</q> said Th�oden. <q>'It was made for me in <name type="PERSON">Thengel</name>'s <name type="DATE">day</name>, while still I was a boy.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> bowed. <q>'I am proud, <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd of the <name type="PERSON">Mark</name>, to bear your device,'</q> he said. <q>'Indeed so<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>r would I bear a horse than be borne by <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. I love my feet better. But, maybe, I shall come yet where I can stand and fight.'</q></p>
<p><q>'It may well be so,'</q> said Th�oden.</p>
<p>The king now rose, and at once <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name> came forward bea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng wine. <q>'_<name type="PERSON">Ferthu Th�</name>oden h�l!_' she said. 'Receive now this cup and d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk in <name type="TIME">happy <name type="TIME">hour</name></name>. Health be with thee at thy going and coming!'</q></p>
<p>Th�oden drank from the cup, and she then proffered it to the guests. As she stood before <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> she paused suddenly and looked upon him, and her eyes were shining. And he looked down upon her fair face and smiled; but as he took the cup, his hand met hers, and he knew that she trembled at the touch. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Hail</name> <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> son of <name type="ORG">Arathorn</name>!'</q> she said. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Hail</name> <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>!'</q> he answered, but his face now was troubled and he did not smile.</p>
<p>When they had all drunk, the king went down the hall to the doors. There the guards awaited him, and heralds stood, and all the lords and chiefs were gathered together that remained in <name type="ORG">Edoras</name> or dwelt nearby.</p>
<p><q>'Behold! I go forth, and it seems like to be my last <name type="GPE">ri</name>ding,'</q> said Th�oden. <q>'I have no child. <name type="PERSON">Th�odred</name> my son is slain. I name �omer my sister-son to be my heir. If neither of us return, then choose a new lord as you will. But to some <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> I must now entrust my people that I leave behind, to rule them in my place. Which of you will stay?'</q></p>
<p>No man spoke.</p>
<p><q>'Is there n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> whom you would name? In whom do my people trust?'</q></p>
<p><q>'In the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>use of <name type="PERSON">Eorl</name>,'</q> answered <name type="ORG">H�ma</name>.</p>
<p><q>'But �omer I cannot spare, nor would he stay,'</q> said the king; <q>'and he is the last of that <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>use.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I said not �omer,'</q> answered <name type="ORG">H�ma</name>. <q>'And he is not the last. There is <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name>, daughter of �omund, his sister. She is fearless and high<name type="PERSON">-he</name>arted. All love her. Let her be as lord to the <name type="PERSON">Eorl</name>ingas, while we are g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q>'It shall be so,'</q> said Th�oden. <q>'Let the heralds announce to the folk that the <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name> will lead them!'</q></p>
<p>Then the king sat upon a seat before his doors, and <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name> knelt before him and received from him a sword and a fair corslet. <q>'<name type="LOC">Far</name>ewell sister-daughter!'</q> he said. <q>'Dark is the <name type="TIME">hour</name>, yet maybe we shall return to the Golden <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>l. But in <name type="PERSON">Dunharrow</name> the people may long de<name type="PERSON">fen</name>d themselves, and if the battle go ill, thither will come all who escape.'</q> <q>'Speak not so!'</q> she answered. <q>'A <name type="DATE">year</name> shall I endure for every <name type="DATE">day</name> that passes until your return.'</q> But as she spoke her eyes went to <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> who stood nearby.</p>
<p><q>'The king shall come again,'</q> he said. <q>'Fear not! Not <name type="LOC">West</name> but <name type="LOC">East</name> does our doom await us.'</q></p>
<p>The king now went down the stair with <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> beside him. The others followed. <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> looked back as they passed towards the gate. Al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name> stood before the doors of the house at the stair's head; the sword was set up<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght before her, and her hands were laid upon the hilt. She was clad now in mail and sh<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> like silver in the sun.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> walked with <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. his axe on his shoulder. <q>'Well, at last we set off!'</q> he said. <q>'<name type="ORG">Men</name> need many words before deeds. My axe is restless in my hands. Though I doubt not that these Rohir<name type="GPE">ri</name>m are fell-handed when they come to it. N<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>theless this is not the warfare that suits me. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w shall I come to the battle? I wish I could walk and not bump like a sack at <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>'s <name type="PERSON">saddlebow</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q>'A safer seat than many, I guess,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. <q>'Yet doubtless <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> will gladly put you down on your feet when blows begin; or <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>fax himself. An axe is no weapon for a <name type="GPE">ri</name>der.'</q></p>
<p><q>'And a <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Dwarf</name> is no horseman. It is orc-necks I would hew, not shave the scalps of <name type="ORG">Men</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>, patting the haft of his axe.</p>
<p>At the gate they found a great host of men, old and young, all ready in the saddle. <name type="CARDINAL">More than <name type="CARDINAL">a thousand</name></name> were there mustered. Their spears were like a sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>nging wood. <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>udly and joyously they shouted as Th�oden came forth. Some held in readiness the king's horse, <name type="PERSON">Snow</name>mane, and others held the horses of <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> and <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> stood ill at ease, frowning, but �omer came <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name> him, leading his horse.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Hail</name>, <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> <name type="PRODUCT">Gl�</name>in's son!'</q> he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed. <q>'I have not had time to learn gentle speech under your rod, as you promised. But shall we not put aside our quarrel? At least I will speak no evil again of the <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> of the <name type="PERSON">Wood</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I will forget my wrath for a while, �omer son of �omund,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>; <q>'but if ever you chance to see the <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> <name type="PERSON">Galad<name type="GPE">ri</name>el</name> with your eyes, then you shall acknowledge her the fairest of ladies, or our f<name type="GPE">ri</name>endship will end.'</q> <q>'So be it!'</q> said �omer. <q>'But until that time par<name type="PERSON">don</name> me, and in token of par<name type="PERSON">don</name> <name type="GPE">ri</name>de with me, I beg. <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> will be at the head with the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd of the <name type="PERSON">Mark</name>; but <name type="ORG">Fire</name>foot, my horse, will bear us both, if you will.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I thank you indeed,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> greatly pleased. <q>'I will gladly go with you, if <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>, my comrade, may <name type="GPE">ri</name>de beside us.'</q></p>
<p><q>'It shall he so,'</q> said �omer. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> upon my left, and <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> upon my <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght, and n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> will dare to stand before us!'</q></p>
<p><q>'Where is <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>fax?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>.</p>
<p><q>'Running wild over the grass,'</q> they answered. <q>'He will let no man handle him. There he goes, away down by the <name type="ORG">ford</name>, like a shadow among the willows.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> whistled and called aloud the horse's name, and far away he tossed his head and neighed, and turning sped towards the host like an arrow.</p>
<p><q>'Were the breath of the <name type="LOC">West</name> Wind to take a body visible, even so would it appear,'</q> said �omer, as the great horse ran up, until he stood before the wizard.</p>
<p><q>'The gift seems already to be given,'</q> said Th�oden. <q>'But hearken all! Here now I name my guest, <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> <name type="ORG">Grey</name>hame, wisest of counsellors; most welcome of <name type="PERSON">wan</name>derers, a lord of the <name type="PERSON">Mark</name>, a chieftain of the <name type="PERSON">Eorl</name>ingas while our kin shall last; and I give to him <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>fax, p<name type="GPE">ri</name>nce of horses.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I thank you, Th�oden <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. Then suddenly he threw back his grey cloak, and cast aside his hat, and leaped to horseback. He wore no helm nor mail. His snowy <name type="PERSON">hai</name>r flew free in the wind, his white robes sh<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> dazzling in the sun.</p>
<p><q>'Behold the White <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>, and all took up the words.</p>
<p><q>'Our <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g and the White <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>!'</q> they shouted. <q>'Forth <name type="PERSON">Eorl</name>ingas!'</q></p>
<p>The trumpets sounded. The horses reared and neighed. Spear clashed on shield. Then the king raised his hand, and with a rush like the sudden onset of a great wind the last host of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> rode thunde<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng into the <name type="LOC">West</name>. <name type="LOC">Far</name> over the plain <name type="PERSON">�owyn</name> saw the glitter of their spears, as she stood still, al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> before the doors of the silent house.</p>
</chapter><chapter num="7"><heading>Chapter 7</heading>
<p><name type="PERSON">Helm</name>'s <name type="PERSON">Deep</name></p>
<p>The sun was already weste<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng as they rode from <name type="ORG">Edoras</name>, and the light of it was in their eyes, turning all the rolling fields of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> to a golden haze. There was a bea<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> way, north-westward along the foot-hills of the White <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s, and this they followed, up and down in a green country, crossing small swift streams by many <name type="ORG">ford</name>s. <name type="LOC">Far</name> ahead and to their <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght the <name type="LOC">Misty <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s</name> loomed; ever darker and taller they grew as the miles went by. The sun went slowly down before them. Evening came behind.</p>
<p>The host rode on. Need drove them. Fea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng to come too late, they rode with all the speed they could, pausing seldom. <name type="PERSON">Swift</name> and endu<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng were the <name type="PERSON">steed</name>s of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>, but there were many leagues to go. <name type="CARDINAL">Forty</name> leagues and more it was, as a bird flies, from <name type="ORG">Edoras</name> to the <name type="ORG">ford</name>s of the <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>, where they hoped to find the king's men that held back the hosts of <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>.</p>
<p>Night closed about them. At last they halted to make their camp. They had <name type="GPE">ri</name>dden for some <name type="CARDINAL">five</name> <name type="TIME">hour</name>s and were far out upon the western plain, yet more than <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> their journey lay still before them. In a great circle, under the starry sky and the waxing moon, they now made their bivouac. They lit no fires, for they were uncertain of events; but they set a <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng of mounted guards about them, and scouts rode out far ahead, passing like shadows in the folds of the land. The slow <name type="TIME">night</name> passed without tidings or alarm. At <name type="TIME">dawn</name> the horns sounded, and within <name type="TIME">an <name type="TIME">hour</name></name> they took the road again.</p>
<p>There were no clouds overhead yet, but a heaviness was in the air; it was hot for <name type="DATE">the season of <name type="DATE">the <name type="DATE">year</name></name></name>. The <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing sun was hazy, and behind it, following it slowly up the sky, there was a growing darkness, as of a great storm moving out of the <name type="LOC">East</name>. And away in the <name type="LOC">North</name>-west there seemed to be another darkness brooding <name type="QUANTITY">about the feet</name> of the <name type="LOC">Misty <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s</name>, a shadow that crept down slowly from the <name type="ORG">Wizard</name>'s Vale.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> dropped back to where <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> rode beside �omer. <q>'You have the keen eyes of your fair kindred, <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>,'</q> he said; <q>'and they can tell a sparrow from a finch a league off. Tell me, can you <name type="ORG">sec</name> anything away yonder towards <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard?'</q></p>
<p><q>'Many miles lie between,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>, gazing thither and shading his eyes with his long hand. <q>'I can see a darkness. There are shapes moving in it, great shapes far away upon the bank of the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver; but what they are I cannot tell. It is not mist or cloud that defeats my eyes: there is a veiling shadow that some power lays upon the land, and it <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ches slowly down stream. It is as if the <name type="TIME">twilight</name> under endless trees were flowing downwards from the hills.'</q></p>
<p><q>'And behind us comes a very storm of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'It will be a black <name type="TIME">night</name>.'</q></p>
<p>As the <name type="ORG">sec</name>ond <name type="DATE">day</name> of their <name type="GPE">ri</name>ding drew on, the heaviness in the air increased. In the <name type="TIME">after<name type="TIME">noon</name></name> the dark clouds began to overtake them: a sombre canopy with great billowing edges flecked with dazzling light. The sun went down, blood-red in a smoking haze. The spears of the <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s were tipped with fire as the last shafts of light kindled the steep faces of the peaks of <name type="PERSON">Thr</name>ihyrne: now very near they stood on the northernmost arm of the White <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s, <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> jagged horns sta<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng at the sunset. In the last red glow men in the vanguard saw a black speck, a horseman <name type="GPE">ri</name>ding back towards them. They halted awaiting him.</p>
<p>He came, a weary man with dinted helm and cloven shield. Slowly he climbed from his horse and stood there a while gasping. At length he spoke. <q>'Is �omer here?'</q> he asked. 'You come at last, but too late, and with too little strength. Things have g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> evilly since <name type="PERSON">Th�odred</name> fell. We were d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ven back yester<name type="DATE">day</name> over the <name type="PERSON">Isen</name> with great loss; many pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>shed at the crossing. Then at <name type="TIME">night</name> fresh forces came over the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver against our camp. All <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard must be emptied; and <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> has armed the wild <name type="ORG">hillmen</name> and herd-folk of <name type="GPE">Dunland</name> beyond the <name type="GPE">ri</name>vers, and these also he loosed upon us. We were overmastered. The shield-wall was broken. <name type="ORG">Erkenbrand</name> of <name type="LOC">West</name>fold has drawn off those men he could gather towards his fastness in <name type="PERSON">Helm</name>'s <name type="PERSON">Deep</name>. The rest are scattered.</p>
<p><q>'Where is �omer? Tell him there is no hope ahead. He should return to <name type="ORG">Edoras</name> before the wolves of <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard come there.'</q> Th�oden had sat silent, hidden from the man's sight behind his guards; now he urged his horse forward. <q>'Come, stand before me, <name type="PERSON">Ceorl</name>!'</q> he said. <q>'I am here. The last host of the <name type="PERSON">Eorl</name>ingas has <name type="GPE">ri</name>dden forth. It will not return without battle.'</q></p>
<p>The man's face ligh<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed with joy and wonder. He drew himself up. Then he knelt, offe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng his notched sword to the king. <q>'Command me, lord!'</q> he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed. <q>'And par<name type="PERSON">don</name> me! I thought-'</q></p>
<p><q>'You thought I remained in <name type="GPE">Meduseld</name> bent like an old tree under <name type="DATE">winter</name> snow. So it was when you rode to war. But a west wind has shaken the boughs,'</q> said Th�oden. <q>'Give this man a fresh horse! Let us <name type="GPE">ri</name>de to the help of <name type="ORG">Erkenbrand</name>!'</q></p>
<p>While Th�oden was speaking, <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> rode a short way ahead, and he sat there al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, gazing north to <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard and west to the setting sun. Now he came back.</p>
<p><q>'Ride, Th�oden!'</q> he said. <q>'Ride to <name type="PERSON">Helm</name>'s <name type="PERSON">Deep</name>! Go not to the <name type="ORG">Ford</name>s of <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>, and do not tarry in the plain! I must leave you for a while. <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>fax must bear me now on a swift errand.'</q> Turning to <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> and �omer and the men of the king's household, he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed: <q>'Keep well the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd of the <name type="PERSON">Mark</name>, till I return. Await me at <name type="PERSON">Helm</name>'s <name type="FAC">Gate</name>! <name type="LOC">Far</name>ewell!'</q></p>
<p>He spoke a word to <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>fax, and like an arrow from the bow the great horse sprang away. Even as they looked he was g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>: a flash of silver in the sunset, a wind over the grass, a shadow that fled and passed from sight. <name type="PERSON">Snow</name>mane snorted and reared, eager to follow; but only a swift bird on the wing could have overtaken him.</p>
<p><q>'What does that mean?'</q> said <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the guard to <name type="ORG">H�ma</name>.</p>
<p><q>'That <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> <name type="ORG">Grey</name>hame has need of haste,'</q> answered <name type="ORG">H�ma</name>. <q>'Ever he goes and comes unlooked-for:'</q></p>
<p>'<name type="ORG">Worm</name>tongue, were he here, would not find it hard to explain '<name type="PERSON">Said</name> the other.</p>
<p><q>'True enough,'</q> said <name type="ORG">H�ma</name>; <q>'but for myself, I will wait until I see <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> again.'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="DATE">May</name>be you will wait long,'</q> said the other.</p>
<p>The host turned away now from the road to the <name type="ORG">Ford</name>s of <name type="PERSON">Isen</name> and bent their course southward. Night fell, and still they rode on. The hills drew near, but the tall peaks of <name type="PERSON">Thr</name>ihyrne were already dim against the darkening sky. Still some miles away, on the far side of the <name type="LOC">West</name>fold Vale, lay a green coomb, a great bay in the mountains, out of which a gorge opened in the hills. <name type="ORG">Men</name> of that land called it <name type="PERSON">Helm</name>'s <name type="PERSON">Deep</name>, after a hero of old wars who had made his refuge there. Ever steeper and narrower it wound inward from the north under the shadow of the <name type="PERSON">Thr</name>ihyrne, till the crow-haunted cliffs rose like mighty towers on either side, shutting out the light.</p>
<p>At <name type="PERSON">Helm</name>'s <name type="FAC">Gate</name>, before the mouth of the <name type="PERSON">Deep</name>, there was a heel of rock thrust outward by the northern cliff. There upon its spur stood high walls of ancient st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, and within them was a lofty tower. <name type="ORG">Men</name> said that in the far-off <name type="DATE">day</name>s of the glory of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> the sea-kings had built here this fastness with the hands of <name type="ORG">giants</name>. The <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>rn<name type="GPE">burg</name> it was called, for a trumpet sounded upon the tower echoed in the <name type="PERSON">Deep</name> behind, as if armies long-forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> were issuing to war from caves beneath the hills. A wall, too, the men of old had made from the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>rn<name type="GPE">burg</name> to the southern cliff, bar<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng the entrance to the gorge. Beneath it by a wide culvert the <name type="PERSON">Deep</name>ing-stream passed out. <name type="QUANTITY">About the feet</name> of the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>rnrock it wound, and flowed then in a gully through the midst of a wide green gore, sloping gently down from <name type="PERSON">Helm</name>'s <name type="FAC">Gate</name> to <name type="PERSON">Helm</name>'s <name type="PERSON">Dike</name>. Thence it fell into the <name type="PERSON">Deep</name>ing-coomb and out into the <name type="LOC">West</name>fold Vale. There in the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>rn<name type="GPE">burg</name> at <name type="PERSON">Helm</name>'s <name type="FAC">Gate</name> <name type="ORG">Erkenbrand</name>, master of <name type="LOC">West</name>fold on the borders of the <name type="PERSON">Mark</name>, now dwelt. As the <name type="DATE">day</name>s darkened with threat of war, being wise, he had repaired the wall and made the fastness strong.</p>
<p>The <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s were still in the low valley before the mouth of the <name type="LOC">Coomb</name>, when c<name type="GPE">ri</name>es and hornblasts were heard from their scouts that went in front. Out of the darkness arrows whistled. <name type="PERSON">Swift</name>ly a scout rode back and reported that <name type="PERSON">wolf</name>-<name type="GPE">ri</name>ders were abroad in the valley, and that a host of <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s and wild men were hurrying southward from the <name type="ORG">Ford</name>s of <name type="PERSON">Isen</name> and seemed to be making for <name type="PERSON">Helm</name>'s <name type="PERSON">Deep</name>.</p>
<p><q>'We have found many of our folk lying slain as they fled thither,'</q> said the scout. <q>'And we have met scattered companies, going this way and that, leaderless. What has become of <name type="ORG">Erkenbrand</name> n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> seem to know. It is likely that he will be overtaken ere he can reach <name type="PERSON">Helm</name>'s <name type="FAC">Gate</name>, if he has not already pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>shed.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Has aught been seen of <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>?'</q> asked Th�oden.</p>
<p><q>'Yes, lord. Many have seen an old man in white upon a horse, passing hither and thither over the plains like wind in the grass. Some thought he was <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>. It is said that he went away ere <name type="TIME">night</name>fall towards <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard. Some say also that <name type="ORG">Worm</name>tongue was seen earlier, going northward with a company of <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s.'</q></p>
<p><q>'It will go ill with <name type="ORG">Worm</name>tongue, if <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> comes upon him said Th�oden. 'N<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>theless I miss now both my counsellors, the old and the new. But in this need we have no better choice than to go on, as <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> said, to <name type="PERSON">Helm</name>'s <name type="FAC">Gate</name>, whether <name type="ORG">Erkenbrand</name> be there or no. Is it known how great is the host that comes from the <name type="LOC">North</name>?'</q></p>
<p><q>'It is very great,'</q> said the scout. <q>'He that flies counts every foeman twice, yet I have spoken to stouthearted men, and I do not doubt that the main strength of the enemy is many times as great as all that we have here.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Then let us be swift,'</q> said �omer. 'Let us d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ve through such foes as are already between us and the fastness. There are caves in <name type="PERSON">Helm</name>'s <name type="PERSON">Deep</name> where <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name>s may lie hid; and <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret ways lead thence up on to the hills.</p>
<p><q>'Trust not to <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret ways,'</q> said the king. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> has long spied out this land. Still in that place our de<name type="PERSON">fen</name>ce may last long. Let us go!'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> and <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> went now with �omer in the van. On through the dark <name type="TIME">night</name> they rode, ever slower as the darkness deepened and their way climbed southward, higher and higher into the dim folds about the mountains' feet. They found few of the enemy before them. Here and there they came upon roving bands of <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s; but they fled ere the <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s could take or slay them.</p>
<p><q>'It will not be long I fear,'</q> said �omer, <q>'ere the coming of the king's host will be known to the leader of our enemies, <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> or whatever captain he has sent forth.'</q></p>
<p>The rumour of war grew behind them. Now they could hear, borne over the dark, the sound of harsh singing. They had climbed far up into the <name type="PERSON">Deep</name>ing-coomb when they looked back. Then they saw torches countless points of fiery light upon the black fields behind, scattered like red flowers, or winding up from the lowlands in long flicke<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng lines. Here and there a larger blaze leapt up.</p>
<p><q>'It is a great host and follows us hard,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>.</p>
<p><q>'They b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng fire,'</q> said Th�oden, <q>'and they are burning as they come, <name type="GPE">ri</name>ck, cot, and tree. This was a <name type="GPE">ri</name>ch <name type="GPE">vale</name> and had many homesteads. <name type="PERSON">Alas</name> for my folk!'</q></p>
<p><q>'Would that <name type="DATE">day</name> was here and we might <name type="GPE">ri</name>de down upon them like a storm out of the mountains!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'It g<name type="GPE">ri</name>eves me to fly before them.'</q></p>
<p><q>'We need not fly much further,'</q> said �omer. <q>'Not far ahead now lies <name type="PERSON">Helm</name>'s <name type="PERSON">Dike</name>, an ancient trench and rampart scored across the coomb, <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> furlongs below <name type="PERSON">Helm</name>'s <name type="FAC">Gate</name>. There we can turn and give battle.'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Nay</name>, we are too few to de<name type="PERSON">fen</name>d the <name type="PERSON">Dike</name>,'</q> said Th�oden. <q>'It is <name type="QUANTITY">a mile</name> long or more, and the breach in it is wide.'</q></p>
<p><q>'At the breach our rearguard must stand, if we are pressed,'</q> said �omer.</p>
<p>There was neither star nor moon when the <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s came to the breach in the <name type="PERSON">Dike</name>, where the stream from above passed out, and the road beside it ran down from the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>rn<name type="GPE">burg</name>. The rampart loomed suddenly before them, a high shadow beyond a dark pit. As they rode up a sentinel challenged them.</p>
<p><q>'The <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd of the <name type="PERSON">Mark</name> <name type="GPE">ri</name>des to <name type="PERSON">Helm</name>'s <name type="FAC">Gate</name>,'</q> �omer answered. <q>'I, �omer son of �omund, speak.'</q></p>
<p><q>'This is good tidings beyond hope,'</q> said the sentinel. <q>'Has<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>! The enemy is on your heels.'</q></p>
<p>The host passed through the breach and halted on the sloping sward above. They now learned to their joy that <name type="ORG">Erkenbrand</name> had left many men to hold <name type="PERSON">Helm</name>'s <name type="FAC">Gate</name>, and more had since escaped thither.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="DATE">May</name>be, we have <name type="CARDINAL">a thousand</name> fit to fight on foot,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gamling</name>, an old man, the leader of those that watched the <name type="PERSON">Dike</name>. <q>'But most of them have seen too many <name type="DATE">winter</name>s, as I have, or too few, as my son's son here. What news of <name type="ORG">Erkenbrand</name>? Word came yester<name type="DATE">day</name> that he was retreating hither with all that is left of the best <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s of <name type="LOC">West</name>fold. But he has not come.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I fear that he will not come now,'</q> said �omer. <q>'Our scouts have gained no news of him, and the enemy fills all the valley behind us.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I would that he had escaped,'</q> said Th�oden. <q>'He was a mighty man. In him lived again the valour of <name type="PERSON">Helm</name> the <name type="PERSON">Hammer</name>hand. But we cannot await him here. We must draw all our forces now behind the walls. Are you well stored? We b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng little provision, for we rode forth to open battle, not to a siege.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Behind us in the caves of the <name type="PERSON">Deep</name> are <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> parts of the folk of <name type="LOC">West</name>fold, old and young, children and women,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gamling</name>. <q>'But great store of food, and many beasts and their fodder, have also been gathered there.'</q></p>
<p><q>'That is well,'</q> said �omer. <q>'They are burning or despoiling all that is left in the <name type="GPE">vale</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q>'If they come to bargain for our goods at <name type="PERSON">Helm</name>'s <name type="FAC">Gate</name>, they will pay a high p<name type="GPE">ri</name>ce,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gamling</name>.</p>
<p>The king and his <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s passed on. Before the causeway that crossed the stream they dismounted. In a long file they led their horses up the ramp and passed within the gates of the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>rn<name type="GPE">burg</name>. There they were welcomed again with joy and renewed hope; for now there were men enough to man both the <name type="GPE">burg</name> and the bar<name type="GPE">ri</name>er wall.</p>
<p>Quickly �omer set his men in readiness. The king and the men of his household were in the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>rn<name type="GPE">burg</name>, and there also were many of the <name type="LOC">West</name>fold-men. But on the <name type="PERSON">Deep</name>ing Wall and its tower, and behind it, �omer arrayed most of the strength that he had, for here the de<name type="PERSON">fen</name>ce seemed more doubtful, if the assault were determined and in great force. The horses were led far up the <name type="PERSON">Deep</name> under such guard as could be spared.</p>
<p>The <name type="PERSON">Deep</name>ing Wall was <name type="CARDINAL">twenty</name> feet high, and so thick that <name type="CARDINAL">four</name> men could walk abreast along the top, sheltered by a parapet over which only a tall man could look. Here and there were clefts in the st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> through which men could shoot. This battlement could be reached by a stair running down from a door in the outer court of the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>rn<name type="GPE">burg</name>; <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> flights of steps led also up on to the wall from the <name type="PERSON">Deep</name> behind; but in front it was smooth, and the great st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s of it were set with such skill that no foothold could be found at their joints, and at the top they hung over like a sea-delved cliff.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> stood leaning against the breas<name type="CARDINAL">two</name>rk upon the wall. <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> sat above on the parapet, finge<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng his bow, and pee<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng out into the gloom.</p>
<p><q>'This is more to my liking,'</q> said the dwarf, stamping on the st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s. <q>'Ever my heart <name type="GPE">ri</name>ses as we draw near the mountains. There is good rock here. This country has tough b<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s. I felt them in my feet as we came up from the dike. Give me <name type="DATE">a <name type="DATE">year</name></name> and <name type="CARDINAL">a <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name></name> of my kin and I would make this a place that armies would break upon like water.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I do not doubt it,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. <q>'But you are a dwarf, and dwarves are strange folk. I do not like this place, and I shall like it no more by the light of <name type="DATE">day</name>. But you comfort me, <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>, and I am glad to have you standing nigh with your stout legs and your hard axe. I wish there were more of your kin among us. But even more would I give for <name type="CARDINAL">a <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name></name> good archers of <name type="GPE">Mirkwood</name>. We shall need them. The Rohir<name type="GPE">ri</name>m have good bowmen after their fashion, but there are too few here, too few.'</q></p>
<p><q>'It is dark for archery,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. <q>'Indeed it is time for sleep. Sleep! I feel the need of it, as never I thought any dwarf could. Riding is ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng work. Yet my axe is restless in my hand. Give me a row of orc-necks and room to swing and all wea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ness will fall from me!'</q></p>
<p>A slow time passed. <name type="LOC">Far</name> down in the valley scattered fires still burned. The hosts of <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard were advancing in silence now. Their torches could be seen winding up the coomb in many lines.</p>
<p>Suddenly from the <name type="PERSON">Dike</name> yells and screams, and the fierce battle-c<name type="GPE">ri</name>es of men broke out. Flaming brands appeared over the b<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk and clustered thickly at the breach. Then they scattered and vanished. <name type="ORG">Men</name> came galloping back over the field and up the ramp to the gate of the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>rn<name type="GPE">burg</name>. The rearguard of the <name type="LOC">West</name>folders had been d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ven in.</p>
<p><q>'The enemy is at hand!'</q> they said. <q>'We loosed every arrow that we had, and filled the <name type="PERSON">Dike</name> with <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s. But it will not halt them long. Already they are scaling the bank at many points, thick as <name type="PERSON">mar</name><name type="PERSON">chin</name>g ants. But we have taught them not to carry torches.'</q></p>
<p>It was now past <name type="TIME">mid<name type="TIME">night</name></name>. The sky was utterly dark, and the stillness of the heavy air <name type="PERSON">forebode</name>d storm. Suddenly the clouds were seared by a blinding flash. Branched lightning smote down upon <name type="LOC">the eastward hills</name>. For a sta<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng moment the watchers on the walls saw all the space between them and the <name type="PERSON">Dike</name> lit with white light: it was boiling and crawling with black shapes. some squat and broad, some tall and g<name type="GPE">ri</name>m, with high helms and sable shields. <name type="CARDINAL">Hundreds</name> and <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name>s more were pou<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng over the <name type="PERSON">Dike</name> and through the breach. The dark tide flowed <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name> the walls from cliff to cliff. Thunder rolled in the valley. Rain came lashing down.</p>
<p>Arrows thick as the rain came whistling over the battlements, and fell clinking and glancing on the st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s. Some found a <name type="PERSON">mar</name>k. The assault on <name type="PERSON">Helm</name>'s <name type="PERSON">Deep</name> had begun, but no sound or challenge was heard within; no answe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng arrows came.</p>
<p>The assailing hosts halted, foiled by the silent menace of rock and wall. Ever and again the lightning tore aside the darkness. Then the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s screamed, waving spear and sword, and shooting a cloud of arrows at any that stood revealed upon the battlements; and the men of the <name type="PERSON">Mark</name> amazed looked out, as it seemed to them, upon a great field of dark corn, tossed by a tempest of war, and every ear glinted with barbed light.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Brazen</name> trumpets sounded. The enemy surged forward, some against the <name type="PERSON">Deep</name>ing Wall, other towards the causeway and the ramp that led <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name> the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>rn<name type="GPE">burg</name>-gates. There the hugest <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s were mustered, and the wild men of the <name type="GPE">Dunland</name> fells. A moment they hesitated and then on they came. The lightning flashed, and blaz<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>d upon every helm and shield the ghastly hand of <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard was seen: They reached the summit of the rock; they drove towards the gates.</p>
<p>Then at last an answer came: a storm of arrows met them, and a <name type="PERSON">hai</name>l of st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s. They wavered, broke, and fled back; and then charged again, broke and charged again; and each time, like the incoming sea, they halted at a higher point. Again trumpets rang, and a press of roa<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng men leaped forth. They held their great shields above them like a roof, while in their midst they bore <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> trunks of mighty trees. Behind them orc-archers crowded, sending a <name type="PERSON">hai</name>l of darts against the bowmen on the walls. They gained the gates. The trees, swung by strong arms, smote the timbers with a rending boom. If any man fell, crushed by a st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> hurtling from above, <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> others sprang to take his place. Again and again the great rams swung and crashed.</p>
<p>�omer and <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> stood together on the <name type="PERSON">Deep</name>ing Wall. They heard the roar of voices and the thudding of the rams; and then in a sudden flash of light they beheld the pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>l of the gates.</p>
<p><q>'Come!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'This is the <name type="TIME">hour</name> when we draw swords together!'</q></p>
<p>Running like fire, they sped along the wall, and up the steps, and passed into the outer court upon the Rock. As they ran they gathered a handful of stout swordsmen. There was a small postern-door that opened in an angle of the <name type="GPE">burg</name>-wall on the west, where the cliff stretched out to meet it. On that side a narrow path ran round towards the great gate, between the wall and the sheer b<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk of the Rock. Together �omer and <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> sprang through the door, their men close behind. The swords flashed from the sheath as <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>.</p>
<p><q>'G�<name type="PERSON">thwin</name>�!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed �omer. <q>'G�<name type="PERSON">thwin</name>� for the <name type="PERSON">Mark</name>!'</q></p>
<p><q>'And�<name type="GPE">ri</name>l!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'And�<name type="GPE">ri</name>l for the D�nedain!'</q></p>
<p>Charging from the side, they hurled themselves upon the wild men. And�<name type="GPE">ri</name>l rose and fell, gleaming with white fire. A shout went up from wall and tower: <q>'And�<name type="GPE">ri</name>l! And�<name type="GPE">ri</name>l goes to war. The <name type="PRODUCT">Blade</name> that was Broken shines again!'</q></p>
<p>Dismayed the rammers let fall the trees and turned to fight; but the wall of their shields was broken as by a lightning-stroke, and they were swept away, hewn down, or cast over the Rock into the stony stream below. The orc-archers shot wildly and then fled.</p>
<p>For a moment �omer and <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> halted before the gates. The thunder was rumbling in the distance now. The lightning flickered still, far off among the mountains in the <name type="LOC">South</name>. A keen wind was blowing from the <name type="LOC">North</name> again. The clouds were torn and d<name type="GPE">ri</name>fting, and stars peeped out; and above the hills of the <name type="LOC">Coomb</name>-side the weste<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng moon rode, glimme<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng yellow in the storm-wrack.</p>
<p><q>'We did not come too soon,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>, looking at the gates. Their great hinges and iron bars were wrenched and bent; many of their timbers were cracked.</p>
<p><q>'Yet we cannot stay here beyond the walls to de<name type="PERSON">fen</name>d them,'</q> said �omer. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok!'</q> He pointed to the causeway. Already a great press of <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s and <name type="ORG">Men</name> were gathe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng again beyond the stream. Arrows whined, and skipped on the st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s about them. <q>'Come! We must get back and see what we can do to pile st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> and beam across the gates within. Come now!'</q></p>
<p>They turned and ran. At that moment some <name type="CARDINAL">dozen</name> <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s that had lain motionless among the slain leaped to their feet, and came silently and swiftly behind. <name type="CARDINAL">Two</name> flung themselves to the ground at �omer's heels, t<name type="GPE">ri</name>pped him, and in a moment they were on top of him. But a small dark figure that n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> had observed sprang out of the shadows and gave a hoarse shout:_ <name type="PERSON">Baruk <name type="GPE">Khaz</name></name>�d! <name type="GPE">Khaz</name>�d ai-m�nu!_ An axe swung and swept back. <name type="CARDINAL">Two</name> <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s fell headless. The rest fled.</p>
<p>�omer struggled to his feet, even as <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> ran back to his aid.</p>
<p>The postern was closed again, the iron door was barred and piled inside with st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s. When all were safe within, �omer turned: <q>'I thank you, <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> son of <name type="PRODUCT">Gl�</name>in!'</q> he said. <q>'I did not know that you were with us in the sortie. But oft the unbidden guest proves the best company. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w came you there?'</q></p>
<p><q>'I followed you to shake off sleep,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>; <q>'but I looked on the <name type="ORG">hillmen</name> and they seemed over large for me, so I sat beside a st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> to see your sword-play.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I shall not find it easy to repay you,'</q> said �omer.</p>
<p><q>'There may be many a chance ere the <name type="TIME">night</name> is over,'</q> laughed the <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Dwarf</name>. <q>'But I am con<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>t. Till now I have hewn naught but wood since I left <name type="GPE">Mo<name type="GPE">ri</name>a</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="CARDINAL">Two</name>!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>, patting his axe. He had returned to his place on the wall.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="CARDINAL">Two</name>?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. <q>'I have <name type="PERSON">don</name>e better, though now I must grope for spent arrows; all mine are g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. Yet I make my tale <name type="CARDINAL">twenty</name> at the least. But that is only a few leaves in a forest.'</q></p>
<p>The sky now was quickly clea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng and the sinking moon was shining b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ghtly. But the light brought little hope to the <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s of the <name type="PERSON">Mark</name>. The enemy before them seemed to have grown rather than diminished, still more were pressing up from the valley through the breach. The sortie upon the Rock gained only a b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ef respite. The assault on the gates was redoubled. Against the <name type="PERSON">Deep</name>ing Wall the hosts of <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard roared like a sea. <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s and <name type="ORG">hillmen</name> swarmed about its feet from end to end. Ropes with grappling hooks were hurled over the parapet faster than men could cut them or fling them back. <name type="CARDINAL">Hundreds</name> of long ladders were lifted up. Many were cast down in ruin, but many more replaced them, and <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s sprang up them like apes in the dark forests of the <name type="LOC">South</name>. Before the wall's foot the dead and broken were piled like shingle in a storm; ever higher rose the hideous mounds, and still the enemy came on.</p>
<p>The men of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> grew weary. All their arrows were spent, and every shaft was shot; their swords were notched, and their shields were <name type="GPE">ri</name>ven. <name type="PERSON">Thr</name>ee times <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> and �omer rallied them, and <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> times And�<name type="GPE">ri</name>l flamed in a desperate charge that drove the enemy from the wall.</p>
<p>Then a clamour arose in the <name type="PERSON">Deep</name> behind. <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s had crept like rats through the culvert through which the stream flowed out. There they had gathered in the shadow of the cliffs, until the assault above was hottest and nearly all the men of the de<name type="PERSON">fen</name>ce had rushed to the wall's top. Then they sprang out. Already some had passed into the jaws of the <name type="PERSON">Deep</name> and were among the horses, fighting with the guards.</p>
<p>Down from the wall leapt <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> with a fierce cry that echoed in the cliffs. <q>'<name type="GPE">Khaz</name>�d! <name type="GPE">Khaz</name>�d!'</q> He soon had work enough.</p>
<p><q>'Ai-oi!'</q> he shouted. 'The <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s are behind the wall. Ai-oi! Come, <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>! There are enough for us both. _<name type="GPE">Khaz</name>�d ai-m�nu!_'</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Gamling</name> the Old looked down from the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>rn<name type="GPE">burg</name>, hea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng the great voice of the dwarf above all the tumult. <q>'The <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s are in the <name type="PERSON">Deep</name>!'</q> he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed. '<name type="PERSON">Helm</name>! <name type="PERSON">Helm</name>! <name type="GPE">Forth <name type="PERSON">Helm</name>ingas</name>. he shouted as he leaped down the stair from the Rock with many men of <name type="LOC">West</name>fold at his back.</p>
<p>Their onset was fierce and sudden, and the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s gave way before them. Ere long they were hemmed in in the narrows of the gorge, and all were slain or d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ven sh<name type="GPE">ri</name>eking into the chasm of the <name type="PERSON">Deep</name> to fall before the guardians of the hidden caves.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="CARDINAL">Twenty</name>-<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. He hewed a <name type="CARDINAL">two</name>-handed stroke and laid the last <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name> before his feet. <q>'Now my count passes Master <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> again.'</q></p>
<p><q>'We must stop this rat-hole,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gamling</name>. <q>'<name type="ORG">Dwarves</name> are said to be cunning folk with st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. Lend us your aid, master!'</q></p>
<p><q>'We do not shape st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> with battle-axes, nor with our finger-nails,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. <q>'But I will help as I may.'</q></p>
<p>They gathered such small boulders and broken st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s as they could find to hand, and under <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>'s direction the <name type="LOC">West</name>fold-men blocked up the inner end of the culvert, until only a narrow outlet remained. Then the <name type="PERSON">Deep</name>ing-stream, swollen by the rain, churned and fretted in its choked path, and spread slowly in cold pools from cliff to cliff.</p>
<p><q>'It will be d<name type="GPE">ri</name>er above,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. <q>'<name type="LAW">Come, <name type="PERSON">Gamling</name></name>, let us see how things go on the wall!'</q></p>
<p>He climbed up and found <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> beside <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> and �omer. The elf was whetting his long knife. There was for a while a lull in the assault, since the attempt to break in through the culvert had been foiled.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="CARDINAL">Twenty</name>-<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>.</p>
<p><q>'Good!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. <q>'But my count is now <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> <name type="CARDINAL">dozen</name>. It has been knife-work up here.'</q></p>
<p>�omer and <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> leant wea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ly on their swords. Away on the left the crash and clamour of the battle on the Rock rose loud again. But the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>rn<name type="GPE">burg</name> still held fast, like an island in the sea. Its gates lay in ruin; but over the bar<name type="GPE">ri</name>cade of beams and st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s within no enemy as yet had passed.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> looked at the pale stars, and at the moon, now sloping behind the western hills that enclosed the valley. <q>'This is <name type="TIME">a <name type="TIME">night</name></name> <name type="DATE">as long as <name type="DATE">year</name>s</name>,'</q> he said. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w long will the <name type="DATE">day</name> tarry?'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Dawn</name> is not far off,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gamling</name>, who had now climbed up beside him. <q>'But <name type="TIME">dawn</name> will not help us, I fear.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Yet <name type="TIME">dawn</name> is ever the hope of men,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>.</p>
<p><q>'But these creatures of <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard, these <name type="CARDINAL">half</name>-orcs and goblin-men that the foul craft of <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> has bred, they will not quail at the sun,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gamling</name>. <q>'And neither will the wild men of the hills. Do you not hear their voices?'</q></p>
<p><q>'I hear them,'</q> said �omer; <q>'but they are only the scream of birds and the bellowing of beasts to my ears.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Yet there are many that cry in the <name type="GPE">Dunland</name> tongue,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gamling</name>. <q>'I know that tongue. It is an ancient speech of men, and once was spoken in many western valleys of the <name type="PERSON">Mark</name>. <name type="PERSON">Hark</name>! They hate us, and they are glad; for our doom seems certain to them. 'The king the king!'</q> they cry. <q>'We will take their king. Death to the <name type="ORG">Forgoil</name>! Death to the <name type="GPE">Strawheads</name>! Death to the robbers of the <name type="LOC">North</name>!'</q> Such names they have for us. Not in <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> <name type="CARDINAL">a thousand</name> <name type="DATE">year</name>s have they forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> their g<name type="GPE">ri</name>evance that the lords of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> gave the <name type="PERSON">Mark</name> to <name type="PERSON">Eorl</name> the Young and made alliance with him. That old hatred <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> has inflamed. They are fierce folk when roused. They will not give way now for <name type="TIME">dusk</name> or <name type="TIME">dawn</name>, until Th�oden is taken, or they themselves are slain.'</p>
<p><q>'N<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>theless <name type="DATE">day</name> will b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng hope to me,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'Is it not said that no foe has ever taken the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>rn<name type="GPE">burg</name>, if men de<name type="PERSON">fen</name>ded it?'</q></p>
<p><q>'So the minstrels say,'</q> said �omer.</p>
<p><q>'Then let us de<name type="PERSON">fen</name>d it, and hope!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>.</p>
<p>Even as they spoke there came a blare of trumpets. Then there was a crash and a flash of flame and smoke. The waters of the <name type="PERSON">Deep</name>ing-stream poured out hissing and foaming: they were choked no longer, a gaping hole was blasted in the wall. A host of dark shapes poured in.</p>
<p><q>'Devilry of <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. 'They have crept in the culvert again, while we talked, and they have lit the fire of <name type="PERSON">Orthanc</name> beneath our feet. _<name type="PERSON">Elen</name>dil, <name type="PERSON">Elen</name>dil!_' he shouted, as he leaped down into the breach; but even as he did so <name type="CARDINAL">a <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name></name> ladders were raised against the battlements. Over the wall and under the wall the last assault came sweeping like a dark wave upon a hill of sand. The de<name type="PERSON">fen</name>ce was swept away. Some of the <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s were d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ven back, further and further into the <name type="PERSON">Deep</name>, falling and fighting as they gave way, step by step, towards the caves. Others cut their way back towards the citadel.</p>
<p>A broad stairway, climbed from the <name type="PERSON">Deep</name> <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name> the Rock and the rear-gate of the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>rn<name type="GPE">burg</name>. Near the bot<name type="PERSON">tom</name> stood <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. In his hand still And�<name type="GPE">ri</name>l gleamed, and the terror of the sword for a while held back the enemy, as <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> by <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> all who could gain the stair passed <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name>wards the gate. Behind on the upper steps knelt <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. His bow was bent, but <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> gleaned arrow was all that he had left, and he peered out now, ready to shoot the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name> that should dare to approach the stair.</p>
<p><q>'All who can have now got safe within, <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>,'</q> he called. <q>'Come back!'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> turned and sped up the stair; but as he ran he stumbled in his wea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ness. At once his enemies leapt forward. Up came the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s, yelling, with their long arms stretched out to seize him. The foremost fell with <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>' last arrow in his throat. but the rest sprang over him. Then a great boulder, cast from the outer wall above, crashed down upon the stair, and hurled them back into the <name type="PERSON">Deep</name>. <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> gained the door, and swiftly it clanged to behind him.</p>
<p><q>'Things go ill, my f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends,'</q> he said, wiping the sweat from his brow with his arm.</p>
<p><q>'Ill enough,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>, <q>'but not yet hopeless, while we have you with us. Where is <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>?'</q></p>
<p><q>'I do not know.'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'I last saw him fighting on the ground behind the wall, but the enemy swept us apart.'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Alas</name>! That is evil news,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>.</p>
<p><q>'He is stout and strong,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'Let us hope that he will escape back to the caves. There he would be safe for a while. Safer than we. Such a refuge would be to the liking of a dwarf.'</q></p>
<p><q>'That must be my hope''</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. <q>'But I wish that he had come this way. I desired to tell Master <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> that my tale is now <name type="CARDINAL">thirty</name>-<name type="CARDINAL">nine</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q>'If he wins back to the caves, he will pass your count again,'</q> laughed <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'Never did I see an axe so wielded.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I must go and seek some arrows,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. <q>'Would that this <name type="TIME">night</name> would end, and I could have better light for shooting.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> now passed into the citadel. There to his dismay he learned that �omer had not reached the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>rn<name type="GPE">burg</name>.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Nay</name>, he did not come to the Rock,'</q> said <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the <name type="LOC">West</name>fold-men, <q>'I last saw him gathe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng men about him and fighting in the mouth of the <name type="PERSON">Deep</name>. <name type="PERSON">Gamling</name> was with him, and the dwarf; but I could not come to them.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> strode on through the inner court, and mounted to a high chamber in the tower. There stood the king, dark against a narrow window, looking out upon the <name type="GPE">vale</name>.</p>
<p><q>'What is the news, <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>?'</q> he said.</p>
<p><q>'The <name type="PERSON">Deep</name>ing Wall is taken, lord, and all the de<name type="PERSON">fen</name>ce swept away; but many have escaped hither to the Rock.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Is �omer here?'</q></p>
<p><q>'No, lord. But many of your men retreated into the <name type="PERSON">Deep</name>; and some say that �omer was amongst them. In the narrows they may hold back the enemy and come within the caves. What hope they may have then I do not know.'</q></p>
<p><q>'More than we. Good provision, it is said. And the air is wholesome there because of the outlets through fissures in the rock far above. N<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> can force an entrance against determined men. They may hold out long.'</q></p>
<p><q>'But the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s have brought a devilry from <name type="PERSON">Orthanc</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'They have a blasting fire, and with it they took the Wall. If they cannot come in the caves, they may seal up those that are inside. But now we must turn all our thoughts to our own de<name type="PERSON">fen</name>ce.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I fret in this p<name type="GPE">ri</name>son,'</q> said Th�oden. <q>'If I could have set a spear in rest, <name type="GPE">ri</name>ding before my men upon the field, maybe I could have felt again the joy of battle, and so ended. But I serve little purpose here.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Here at least you are guarded in the strongest fastness of the <name type="PERSON">Mark</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'More hope we have to de<name type="PERSON">fen</name>d you in the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>rn<name type="GPE">burg</name> than in <name type="ORG">Edoras</name>, or even at <name type="PERSON">Dunharrow</name> in the mountains.'</q></p>
<p><q>'It is said that the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>rn<name type="GPE">burg</name> has never fallen to assault,'</q> said Th�oden; <q>'but now my heart is doubtful. The world changes, and all that once was strong now proves unsure. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w shall any tower withstand such numbers and such reckless hate? Had I known that the strength of <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard was grown so great, maybe I should not so rashly have <name type="GPE">ri</name>dden forth to meet it, for all the arts of <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. His counsel seems not now so good as it did under the <name type="TIME">morning</name> sun.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Do not judge the counsel of <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, until all is over, lord,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>.</p>
<p><q>'The end will not be long,'</q> said the king. <q>'But I will not end here, taken like an old badger in a trap. <name type="PERSON">Snow</name>mane and <name type="PERSON">Hasufel</name> and the horses of my guard are in the inner court. When <name type="TIME">dawn</name> comes, I will bid men sound <name type="PERSON">Helm</name>'s horn, and I will <name type="GPE">ri</name>de forth. Will you <name type="GPE">ri</name>de with me then, son of <name type="ORG">Arathorn</name>? <name type="DATE">May</name>be we shall cleave a road, or make such an end as will be worth a song-if any be left to sing of us hereafter.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I will <name type="GPE">ri</name>de with you,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>.</p>
<p>Taking his leave, he returned to the walls, and passed round all their circuit, enhear<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing the men, and lending aid wherever the assault was hot. <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> went with him. Blasts of fire leaped up from below shaking the st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s. Grappling-hooks were hurled, and ladders raised. Again and again the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s gained the summit of the outer wall, and again the de<name type="PERSON">fen</name>ders cast them down.</p>
<p>At last <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> stood above the great gates, heedless of the darts of the enemy. As he looked forth he saw the eastern sky grow pale. Then he raised his empty hand, palm outward in token of parley.</p>
<p>The <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s yelled and jeered. <q>'Come down! Come down!'</q> they c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed. <q>'If you wish to speak to us, come down! B<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng out your king! We are the fighting <name type="PERSON">Uruk-<name type="PERSON">hai</name></name>. We will fetch him from his hole, if he does not come. B<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng out your skulking king!'</q></p>
<p><q>'The king stays or comes at his own will,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>.</p>
<p><q>'Then what are you doing here?'</q> they answered. <q>'Why do you look out? Do you wish to see the greatness of our army? We are the fighting <name type="PERSON">Uruk-<name type="PERSON">hai</name></name>.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I looked out to see the <name type="TIME">dawn</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>.</p>
<p><q>'What of the <name type="TIME">dawn</name>?'</q> they jeered. <q>'We are the <name type="PERSON">Uruk-<name type="PERSON">hai</name></name>: we do not stop the fight for <name type="TIME">night</name> or <name type="DATE">day</name>, for fair weather or for storm. We come to kill, by sun or moon. What of the <name type="TIME">dawn</name>?'</q></p>
<p><q>'N<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> knows what the new <name type="DATE">day</name> shall b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng him,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'Get you g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, ere it turn to your evil.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Get down or we will shoot you from the wall,'</q> they c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed. <q>'This is no parley. You have nothing to say.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I have still this to say,'</q> answered <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'No enemy has yet taken the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>rn<name type="GPE">burg</name>. Depart, or not <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of you will be spared. Not <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> will be left alive to take back tidings to the <name type="LOC">North</name>. You do not know your pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>l.'</q></p>
<p>So great a power and royalty was revealed in <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>, as he stood there al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> above the ruined gates before the host of his enemies, that many of the wild men paused, and looked back over their shoulders to the valley, and some looked up doubtfully at the sky. But the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s laughed with loud voices; and a <name type="PERSON">hai</name>l of darts and arrows whistled over the wall, as <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> leaped down.</p>
<p>There was a roar and a blast of fire. The archway of the gate above which he had stood a moment before crumbled and crashed in smoke and dust. The bar<name type="GPE">ri</name>cade was scattered as if by a thunderbolt. <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> ran to the king's tower.</p>
<p>But even as the gate fell, and the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s about it yelled, prepa<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng to charge, a murmur arose behind them. like a wind in the distance, and it grew to a clamour of many voices crying strange news in the <name type="TIME">dawn</name>. The <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s upon the Rock, hea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng the rumour of dismay, wavered and looked back. And then, sudden and ter<name type="GPE">ri</name>ble, from the tower above, the sound of the great horn of <name type="PERSON">Helm</name> rang out.</p>
<p>All that heard that sound trembled. Many of the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s cast themselves on their faces and covered their ears with their claws. Back from the <name type="PERSON">Deep</name> the echoes came, blast upon blast, as if on every cliff and hill a mighty herald stood. But on the walls men looked up, lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing with wonder; for the echoes did not die. Ever the horn-blasts wound on among the hills; nearer now and louder they answered <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> to another, blowing fierce and free.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Helm</name>! <name type="PERSON">Helm</name>!'</q> the <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s shouted. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Helm</name> is a<name type="GPE">ri</name>sen and comes back to war. <name type="PERSON">Helm</name> for Th�oden <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g!'</q></p>
<p>And with that shout the king came. His horse was white as snow, golden was his shield, and his spear was long. At his <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght hand was <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>, <name type="PERSON">Elen</name>dil's heir, behind him rode the lords of the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>use of <name type="PERSON">Eorl</name> the Young. Light sprang in the sky. Night departed.</p>
<p><q>'Forth <name type="PERSON">Eorl</name>ingas!'</q> With a cry and a great noise they charged. Down from the gates they roared, over the causeway they swept, and they drove through the hosts of <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard as a wind among grass. Behind them from the <name type="PERSON">Deep</name> came the stern c<name type="GPE">ri</name>es of' men issuing from the caves, d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ving forth the enemy. Out poured all the men that were left upon the Rock. And ever the sound of blowing horns echoed in the hills.</p>
<p>On they rode, the king and his companions. Captains and champions fell or fled before them. Neither orc nor man withstood them. Their backs were to the swords and spears of the <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s and their faces to the valley. They c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed and wailed, for fear and great wonder had come upon them with the <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing of the <name type="DATE">day</name>.</p>
<p>So <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g Th�oden rode from <name type="PERSON">Helm</name>'s <name type="FAC">Gate</name> and clove his path to the great <name type="PERSON">Dike</name>. There the company halted. Light grew b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght about them. <name type="PERSON">Shafts</name> of the sun flared above the eastern hills and glimmered on their spears. But they sat silent on their horses, and they gazed down upon the <name type="PERSON">Deep</name>ing-coomb.</p>
<p>The land had changed. Where before the green <name type="GPE">dale</name> had lain, its grassy slopes lapping the ever-mounting hills, there now a forest loomed. Great trees, bare and silent, stood, rank on rank, with tangled bough and hoary head; their twisted roots were bu<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed in the long green grass. <name type="PRODUCT">Darkness</name> was under them. Between the <name type="PERSON">Dike</name> and the eaves of that nameless wood <name type="CARDINAL">only <name type="CARDINAL">two</name></name> open furlongs lay. There now cowered the proud hosts of <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>, in terror of the king and in terror of the trees. They streamed down from <name type="PERSON">Helm</name>'s <name type="FAC">Gate</name> until all above the <name type="PERSON">Dike</name> was empty of them, but below it they were packed like swarming flies. <name type="PERSON">Vain</name>ly they crawled and clambered about the walls of the coomb. seeking to escape. Upon the east too sheer and stony was the valley's side; upon the left, from the west, their final doom approached.</p>
<p>There suddenly upon a <name type="GPE">ri</name>dge appeared a <name type="GPE">ri</name>der, clad in white, shining in the <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing sun. Over the low hills the horns were sounding. Behind him, has<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing down the long slopes, were <name type="CARDINAL">a thousand</name> men on foot; their swords were in their hands. Amid them strode a man tall and strong. His shield was red. As he came to the valley's b<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk, he set to his lips a great black horn and blew a <name type="GPE">ri</name>nging blast.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="ORG">Erkenbrand</name>!'</q> the <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s shouted. <q>'<name type="ORG">Erkenbrand</name>!'</q></p>
<p><q>'Behold the White <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> is come again!'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="LOC">Mithrandir</name>, <name type="LOC">Mithrandir</name>!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. <q>'This is wizardry indeed! Come! I would look on this forest, ere the spell changes.'</q></p>
<p>The hosts of <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard roared, swaying this way and that, turning from fear to fear. Again the horn sounded from the tower. Down through the breach of the <name type="PERSON">Dike</name> charged the king's company. Down from the hills leaped <name type="ORG">Erkenbrand</name>, lord of <name type="LOC">West</name>fold. Down leaped <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>fax, like a deer that runs surefooted in the mountains. The White <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name> was upon them, and the terror of his coming filled the enemy with madness. The wild men fell on their faces before him. The <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s reeled and screamed and cast aside both sword and spear. Like a black smoke d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ven by a mounting wind they fled. Wailing they passed under the waiting shadow of the trees; and from that shadow n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> ever came again.</p>
</chapter><chapter num="8"><heading>Chapter 8</heading>
<p>The <name type="FAC">Road</name> to <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard</p>
<p>So it was that in the light of a fair <name type="TIME">morning</name> <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g Th�oden and <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> the White <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name> met again upon the green grass beside the <name type="PERSON">Deep</name>ing-stream. There was also <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> son of <name type="ORG">Arathorn</name>, and <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> the <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name>, and <name type="ORG">Erkenbrand</name> of <name type="LOC">West</name>fold, and the lords of the Golden <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>use. About them were gathered the Rohir<name type="GPE">ri</name>m, the <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s of the <name type="PERSON">Mark</name>: wonder overcame their joy in victory, and their eyes were turned towards the wood.</p>
<p>Suddenly there was a great shout, and down from the <name type="PERSON">Dike</name> came those who had been d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ven back into the <name type="PERSON">Deep</name>. There came <name type="PERSON">Gamling</name> the Old, and �omer son of �omund, and beside them walked <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> the dwarf. He had no helm, and about his head was a linen band stained with blood; but his voice was loud and strong.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="CARDINAL">Forty</name>-<name type="CARDINAL">two</name>, Master <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>!'</q> he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Alas</name>! My axe is notched: the <name type="CARDINAL">forty</name>-<name type="ORG">sec</name>ond had an iron collar on his neck. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w is it with you?'</q></p>
<p><q>'You have passed my score by <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>,'</q> answered <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. <q>'But I do not grudge you the game, so glad am I to see you on your legs!'</q></p>
<p><q>'Welcome, �omer, sister-son!'</q> said Th�oden. <q>'Now that I see you safe, I am glad indeed.'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Hail</name>, <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd of the <name type="PERSON">Mark</name>!'</q> said �omer. <q>'The dark <name type="TIME">night</name> has passed and <name type="DATE">day</name> has come again. But the <name type="DATE">day</name> has brought strange tidings.'</q> He turned and gazed in wonder, <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> at the wood and then at <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'Once more you come in the <name type="TIME">hour</name> of need, unlooked-for,'</q> he said.</p>
<p><q>'Unlooked-for?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'I said that I would return and meet you here.'</q></p>
<p><q>'But you did not name the <name type="TIME">hour</name>, nor foretell the manner of your coming. Strange help you b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng. You are mighty in wizardry, <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> the White!'</q></p>
<p><q>'That may be. But if so, I have not shown it yet. I have but given good counsel in pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>l, and made use of the speed of <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>fax. Your own valour has <name type="PERSON">don</name>e more, and the stout legs of the <name type="LOC">West</name>fold-men <name type="PERSON">mar</name><name type="PERSON">chin</name>g through the <name type="TIME">night</name>.'</q></p>
<p>Then they all gazed at <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> with still greater wonder. Some glanced darkly at the wood, and passed their hands over their brows, as if they thought their eyes saw otherwise than his.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> laughed long and mer<name type="GPE">ri</name>ly. <q>'The trees?'</q> he said. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Nay</name>, I see the wood as plainly as do you. But that is no deed of mine. It is a thing beyond the counsel of the wise. Better than my design, and better even than my hope the event has proved.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Then if not yours, whose is the wizardry?'</q> said Th�oden. <q>'Not <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>'s, that is plain. Is there some mightier sage, of whom we have yet to learn?'</q></p>
<p><q>'It is not wizardry, but a power far older,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>: 'a power that walked the <name type="LOC">earth</name>, ere elf sang or hammer rang.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Ere iron</name> was found or tree was hewn,</p>
<p>When young was mountain under moon;</p>
<p>Ere <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng was made, or wrought was woe,</p>
<p>It walked the forests <name type="DATE">long ago</name>.'</p>
<p><q>'And what may be the answer to your <name type="GPE">ri</name>ddle?'</q> said Th�oden.</p>
<p>'If you would learn that, you should come with me to <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard ' answered <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>.</p>
<p><q>'To <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard?'</q> they c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed.</p>
<p><q>'Yes,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'I shall return to <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard, and those who will may come with me. There we may see strange things.'</q></p>
<p><q>'But there are not men enough in the <name type="PERSON">Mark</name>, not if they were all gathered together and healed of wounds and wea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ness, to assault the stronghold of <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>,'</q> said Th�oden.</p>
<p><q>'Nevertheless to <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard I go,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'I shall not stay there long. My way lies now eastward. <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok for me in <name type="ORG">Edoras</name>, ere the <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ing of the moon!'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Nay</name>!'</q> said Th�oden. <q>'In the dark <name type="TIME">hour</name> before <name type="TIME">dawn</name> I doubted, but we will not part now. I will come with you, if that is your counsel.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I wish to speak with <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>, as soon as may be now,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, <q>'and since he has <name type="PERSON">don</name>e you great injury, it would be fitting if you were there. But how soon and how swiftly will you <name type="GPE">ri</name>de?'</q></p>
<p><q>'My men are weary with battle,'</q> said the <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g; <q>'and I am weary also. For I have <name type="GPE">ri</name>dden far and slept little. <name type="PERSON">Alas</name>! My old age is not feigned nor due only to the whispe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ngs of <name type="ORG">Worm</name>tongue. It is an ill that no leech can wholly cure, not even <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Then let all who are to <name type="GPE">ri</name>de with me rest now,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'We will journey under the shadow of <name type="TIME">evening</name>. It is as well; for it is my counsel that all our comings and goings should be as <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret as may be, henceforth. But do not command many men to go with you, Th�oden. We go to a parley not to a fight.'</q></p>
<p>The <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g then chose men that were unhurt and had swift horses, and he sent them forth with tidings of the victory into every <name type="GPE">vale</name> of the <name type="PERSON">Mark</name>; and they bore his summons also, bidding all men, young and old, to come in haste to <name type="ORG">Edoras</name>. There the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd of the <name type="PERSON">Mark</name> would hold an assembly of all that could bear arms, on the <name type="ORG">sec</name>ond <name type="DATE">day</name> after <name type="TIME">the full moon</name>. To <name type="GPE">ri</name>de with him to <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard the <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g chose �omer and <name type="CARDINAL">twenty</name> men of his household. With <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> would go <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>, and <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>, and <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. In spite of his hurt the dwarf would not stay behind.</p>
<p><q>'It was only a feeble blow and the cap turned it;'</q> he said. <q>'It would take more than such an orc-scratch to keep me back.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I will <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>d it, while you rest,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>.</p>
<p>The king now returned to the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>rn<name type="GPE">burg</name>, and slept, such a sleep of quiet as he had not known for <name type="DATE">many <name type="DATE">year</name>s</name>, and the remainder of his chosen company rested also. But the others, all that were not hurt or wounded, began a great labour; for many had fallen in the battle and lay dead upon the field or in the <name type="PERSON">Deep</name>.</p>
<p>No <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s remained alive; their bodies were uncounted. But a great many of the <name type="ORG">hillmen</name> had given themselves up; and they were afraid, and c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed for mercy.</p>
<p>The <name type="ORG">Men</name> of the <name type="PERSON">Mark</name> took their weapons from them, and set them to work.</p>
<p><q>'Help now to repair the evil in which you have joined,'</q> said <name type="ORG">Erkenbrand</name>; <q>'and afterwards you shall take an oath never again to pass the <name type="ORG">Ford</name>s of <name type="PERSON">Isen</name> in arms, nor to <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ch with the enemies of <name type="ORG">Men</name>; and then you shall go free back to your land. For you have been deluded by <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>. Many of you have got death as the reward of your trust in him; but had you conquered, little better would your wages have been.'</q></p>
<p>The men of <name type="GPE">Dunland</name> were amazed, for <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> had told them that the men of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> were cruel and burned their captives alive.</p>
<p>In the midst of the field before the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>rn<name type="GPE">burg</name> <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> mounds were raised, and beneath them were laid all the <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s of the <name type="PERSON">Mark</name> who fell in the de<name type="PERSON">fen</name>ce, those of the <name type="LOC">East</name> <name type="ORG">Dale</name>s upon <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> side, and those of <name type="LOC">West</name>fold upon the other. In a_ grave al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> under the shadow of the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>rn<name type="GPE">burg</name> lay <name type="ORG">H�ma</name>, captain of the <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g's guard. He fell before the <name type="FAC">Gate</name>.</p>
<p>The <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s were piled in great heaps, away from the mounds of <name type="ORG">Men</name>, not far from the eaves of the forest. And the people were troubled in their minds; for the heaps of car<name type="GPE">ri</name>on were too great for bu<name type="GPE">ri</name>al or for burning. They had little wood for fi<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng, and n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> would have dared to take an axe to the strange trees, even if <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> had not warned them to hurt neither bark nor bough at their great pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>l.</p>
<p><q>'Let the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s lie,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'<name type="TIME">The <name type="TIME">morning</name></name> may b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng new counsel.'</q></p>
<p>In the <name type="TIME">after<name type="TIME">noon</name></name> the <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g's company prepared to depart. The work of bu<name type="GPE">ri</name>al was then but beginning; and Th�oden mourned for the loss of <name type="ORG">H�ma</name>, his captain, and cast the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> <name type="LOC">earth</name> upon his grave. <q>'Great injury indeed has <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> <name type="PERSON">don</name>e to me and all this land,'</q> he said; <q>'and I will remember it, when we meet.'</q></p>
<p>The sun was already drawing near the hills upon the west of the <name type="LOC">Coomb</name>, when at last Th�oden and <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> and their companions rode down from the <name type="PERSON">Dike</name>. Behind them were gathered a great host, both of the <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s and of the people of <name type="LOC">West</name>fold, old and young, women and children, who had come out from the caves. A song of victory they sang with clear voices; and then they fell silent, wonde<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng what would chance, for their eyes were on the trees and they feared them.</p>
<p>The <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s came to the wood, and they halted; horse and man, they were unwilling to pass in. The trees were grey and menacing, and a shadow or a mist was about them. The ends of their long sweeping boughs hung down like sear<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g fingers, their roots stood up from the ground like the limbs of strange monsters, and dark caverns opened beneath them. But <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> went forward, leading the company, and where the road from the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>rn<name type="GPE">burg</name> met the trees they saw now an opening like an arched gate under mighty boughs; and through it <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> passed, and they followed him. Then to their amazement they found that the road ran on, and the <name type="PERSON">Deep</name>ing-stream beside it; and the sky was open above and full of golden light. But on either side the great aisles of the wood were already wrapped in <name type="TIME">dusk</name>, stret<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g away into impenetrable shadows; and there they heard the creaking and groaning of boughs, and far c<name type="GPE">ri</name>es, and a rumour of wordless voices, murmu<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng ang<name type="GPE">ri</name>ly. No <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name> or other living creature could be seen.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> and <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> were now <name type="GPE">ri</name>ding together upon <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> horse; and they kept close beside <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, for <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> was afraid of the wood.</p>
<p><q>'It is hot in here,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> to <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'I feel a great wrath about me. Do you not feel the air throb in your ears?'</q></p>
<p><q>'Yes,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>.</p>
<p><q>'What has become of the miserable <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>.</p>
<p><q>'That, I think, no <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> will ever know,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>.</p>
<p>They rode in silence for a while; but <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> was ever glancing from side to side, and would of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> have halted to lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> to the sounds of the wood, if <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> had allowed it.</p>
<p><q>'These are the strangest trees that ever I saw,'</q> he said; <q>'and I have seen many an oak grow from acorn to ruinous age. I wish that there were leisure now to walk among them: they have voices, and in time I might come to understand their thought.'</q></p>
<p><q>'No, no!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. <q>'Let us leave them! I guess their thought already: hatred of all that go on <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> legs; and their speech is of crushing and strangling.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Not of all that go on <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> legs,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. <q>'There I think you are wrong. It is <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s that they hate. For they do not belong here and know little of <name type="ORG">Elves</name> and <name type="ORG">Men</name>. <name type="LOC">Far</name> away are the valleys where they sprang. From the deep <name type="GPE">dale</name>s of <name type="PERSON">Fangorn</name>, <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>, that is whence they come, I guess.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Then that is the most pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>lous wood in <name type="LOC">Middle-<name type="LOC">earth</name></name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. <q>'I should be grateful for the part they have played, but I do not love them. You may think them wonderful, but I have seen a greater wonder in this land, more beautiful than any grove or glade that ever grew: my heart is still full of it. 'Strange are the ways of <name type="ORG">Men</name>, <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>! Here they have <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the <name type="PERSON">mar</name>vels of the <name type="LOC">North</name>ern World, and what do they say of it? Caves, they say! Caves! <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>les to fly to in time of war, to store fodder in! My good <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>, do you know that the caverns of <name type="PERSON">Helm</name>'s <name type="PERSON">Deep</name> are vast and beautiful? There would be an endless <name type="ORG">pilg<name type="GPE">ri</name>m</name>age of <name type="ORG">Dwarves</name>, merely to gaze at them, if such things were known to be. Aye indeed, they would pay pure gold for a b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ef glance!'</q></p>
<p><q>'And I would give gold to be excused,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>; <q>'and double to be let out, if I strayed in!'</q></p>
<p><q>'You have not seen, so I forgive your jest,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. 'But you speak like a fool. Do you think those halls are fair, where your <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g dwells under the hill in <name type="GPE">Mirkwood</name>, and <name type="ORG">Dwarves</name> helped in their making <name type="DATE">long ago</name>? They are but hovels compared with the caverns I have seen here: immeasurable halls, filled with an everlasting music of water that tinkles into pools, as fair as Kheled-z�ram in the starlight.</p>
<p><q>'And, <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>, when the torches are kindled and men walk on the sandy floors under the echoing domes, ah! then, <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>, gems and crystals and veins of precious ore glint in the polished walls; and the light glows through folded <name type="PERSON">mar</name>bles, shell-like, translucent as the living hands of Queen <name type="PERSON">Galad<name type="GPE">ri</name>el</name>. There are columns of white and saffron and <name type="TIME">dawn</name>-rose, <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>, fluted and twisted into dreamlike forms; they sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng up from many-coloured floors to meet the glis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing pendants of the roof: wings, ropes, curtains fine as frozen clouds; spears, banners, pinnacles of suspended palaces! Still lakes mirror them: a glimme<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng world looks up from dark pools covered with clear glass; cities. such as the mind of Du<name type="GPE">ri</name>n could scarce have imagined in his sleep, stretch on through avenues and pillared courts, on into the dark recesses where no light can come. And plink! a silver drop falls, and the round w<name type="GPE">ri</name>nkles in the glass make all the towers bend and waver like weeds and corals in a grotto of the sea. Then <name type="TIME">evening</name> comes: they fade and twinkle out; the torches pass on into another chamber and another dream. There is chamber after chamber, <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>; hall opening out of hall, dome after dome, stair beyond stair; and still the winding paths lead on into the mountains' heart. Caves! The Caverns of <name type="PERSON">Helm</name>'s <name type="PERSON">Deep</name>! Happy was the chance that drove me there! It makes me weep to leave them.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Then I will wish you this fortune for your comfort, <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>,'</q> said the <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name>, <q>'that you may come safe from war and return to see them again. But do not tell all your kindred! There seems little left for them to do, from your account. <name type="DATE">May</name>be the men of this land are wise to say little: <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> family of busy dwarves with hammer and chisel might <name type="PERSON">mar</name> more than they made.'</q></p>
<p><q>'No, you do not understand,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. <q>'No dwarf could be unmoved by such loveliness. N<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of Du<name type="GPE">ri</name>n's race would mine those caves for st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s or ore, not if diamonds and gold could be got there. Do you cut down groves of blossoming trees in the sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng-time for firewood? We would <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>d these glades of flowe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, not quarry them. With cautious skill, tap by tap � a small chip of rock and no more, perhaps, in a whole anxious <name type="DATE">day</name> � so we could work, and as <name type="DATE">the <name type="DATE">year</name></name>s went by, we should open up new ways, and display far chambers that are still dark, glimpsed only as a void beyond fissures in the rock. And lights, <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>! We should make lights, such lamps as once sh<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> in <name type="GPE">Khaz</name>ad-d�m; and when we wished we would d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ve away the <name type="TIME">night</name> that has lain there since the hills were made; and when we desired rest, we would let the <name type="TIME">night</name> return.'</q></p>
<p><q>'You move me, <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. <q>'I have never heard you speak like this before. Almost you make me regret that I have not seen these caves. Come! Let us make this bargain-if we both return safe out of the pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ls that await us, we will journey for a while together. You shall visit <name type="PERSON">Fangorn</name> with me, and then I will come with you to see <name type="PERSON">Helm</name>'s <name type="PERSON">Deep</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q>'That would not be the way of return that I should choose,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. <q>'But I will endure <name type="PERSON">Fangorn</name>, if I have your promise to come back to the caves and share their wonder with me.'</q></p>
<p><q>'You have my promise,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. <q>'But alas! Now we must leave behind both cave and wood for a while: See! We are coming to the end of the trees. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w far is it to <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard, <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>?'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="CARDINAL">About <name type="CARDINAL">fifteen</name></name> leagues, as the crows of <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> make it.'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>: <q>'<name type="CARDINAL">five</name> from the mouth of <name type="PERSON">Deep</name>ing-coomb to the <name type="ORG">Ford</name>s: and <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> more from there to the gates of <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard. But we shall not <name type="GPE">ri</name>de all the way this <name type="TIME">night</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q>'And when we come there, what shall we see?'</q> asked <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. <q>'You may know, but I cannot guess.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I do not know myself for certain,'</q> answered the wizard. <q>'I was there at <name type="TIME">night</name>fall yester<name type="DATE">day</name>, but much may have happened since. Yet I think that you will not say that the journey was in vain � not though the Glitte<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng Caves of <name type="GPE">Aglar</name>ond be left behind.'</q></p>
<p>At last the company passed through the trees, and found that they had come to the bot<name type="PERSON">tom</name> of the <name type="LOC">Coomb</name>, where the road from <name type="PERSON">Helm</name>'s <name type="PERSON">Deep</name> branched, going <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> way east to <name type="ORG">Edoras</name>, and the other north to the <name type="ORG">Ford</name>s of <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>. As they rode from under the eaves of the wood, <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> halted and looked back with regret. Then he gave a sudden cry.</p>
<p><q>'There are eyes!'</q> he said. <q>'<name type="PRODUCT">Eye</name>s looking out from the shadows of the boughs! I never saw such eyes before.'</q></p>
<p>The others, surp<name type="GPE">ri</name>sed by his cry, halted and turned; but <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> started to <name type="GPE">ri</name>de back.</p>
<p><q>'No, no!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. <q>'Do as you please in your madness, but let me <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> get down from this horse! I wish to see no eyes!'</q> <q>'Stay, <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> Greenleaf!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'Do not go back into the wood, not yet! Now is not your time.'</q></p>
<p>Even as he spoke, there came forward out of the trees <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> strange shapes. As tall as trolls they were, <name type="CARDINAL">twelve</name> feet or more in h<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name>; their strong bodies, stout as young trees, seemed to be clad with raiment or with hide of close-fitting grey and brown. Their limbs were long, and their hands had many fingers; their <name type="PERSON">hai</name>r was stiff, and their beards grey-green as moss. They gazed out with solemn eyes, but they were not looking at the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ders: their eyes were bent northwards. Suddenly they lifted their long hands to their mouths, and sent forth <name type="GPE">ri</name>nging calls, clear as notes of a horn, but more musical and va<name type="GPE">ri</name>ous. The calls were answered; and turning again, the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ders saw other creatures of the same kind approa<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g, st<name type="GPE">ri</name>ding through the grass. They came swiftly from the <name type="LOC">North</name>, walking like wading herons in their gait, but not in their speed; for their legs in their long paces beat quicker than the heron's wings. The <name type="GPE">ri</name>ders c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed aloud in wonder, and some set their hands upon their sword-hilts.</p>
<p><q>'You need no weapons,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'These are but herdsmen. They are not enemies, indeed they are not concerned with us at all.'</q></p>
<p>So it seemed to be; for as he spoke the tall creatures, without a glance at the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ders, strode into the wood and vanished.</p>
<p><q>'Herdsmen!'</q> said Th�oden. <q>'Where are their flocks? What are they, <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>? For it is plain that to you, at any rate, they are not strange.'</q></p>
<p><q>'They are the shepherds of the trees,'</q> answered <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'Is it so long since you lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed to tales by the fireside? There are children in your land who, out of the twisted threads of story, could pick the answer to your question. You have seen <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s, O <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g, <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s out of <name type="PERSON">Fangorn</name> <name type="ORG">Forest</name>, which in your tongue you call the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>wood. Did you think that the name was given only in idle fancy? <name type="PERSON">Nay</name>, Th�oden, it is otherwise: to them you are but the passing tale; <name type="DATE">all <name type="DATE">the <name type="DATE">year</name></name>s</name> from <name type="PERSON">Eorl</name> the Young to Th�oden the Old are of little count to them; and all the deeds of your house but a small matter.'</q></p>
<p>The king was silent. <q>'<name type="ORG">Ent</name>s!'</q> he said at length. <q>'Out of the shadows of legend I begin a little to understand the <name type="PERSON">mar</name>vel of the trees, I think. I have lived to see strange <name type="DATE">day</name>s. <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ng we have <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ded our beasts and our fields, built our houses, wrought our tools, or <name type="GPE">ri</name>dden away to help in the wars of Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name>. And that we called the life of <name type="ORG">Men</name>, the way of the world. We cared little for what lay beyond the borders of our land. Songs we have that tell of these things, but we are forgetting them, tea<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g them only to children, as a careless cus<name type="PERSON">tom</name>. And now the songs have come down among us out of strange places, and walk visible under the <name type="ORG">Sun</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q>'You should be glad, Th�oden <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'For not only the little life of <name type="ORG">Men</name> is now endangered, but the life also of those things which you have deemed the matter of legend. You are not without allies, even if you know them not.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Yet also I should be sad,'</q> said Th�oden. <q>'For however the fortune of war shall go, may it not so end that much that was fair and wonderful shall pass for ever out of <name type="LOC">Middle-<name type="LOC">earth</name></name>?'</q></p>
<p><q>'It may,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'The evil of <name type="ORG">Sauron</name> cannot be wholly cured, nor made as if it had not been. But to such <name type="DATE">day</name>s we are doomed. Let us now go on with the journey we have begun!'</q></p>
<p>The company turned then away from the <name type="LOC">Coomb</name> and from the wood and took the road towards the <name type="ORG">Ford</name>s. <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> followed reluctantly. The sun had set, already it had sunk behind the <name type="GPE">ri</name>m of the world; but as they rode out from the shadow of the hills and looked west to the <name type="ORG">Gap</name> of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> the sky was still red, and a burning light was under the floating clouds. Dark against it there wheeled and flew many black-winged birds. Some passed overhead with mournful c<name type="GPE">ri</name>es, returning to their homes among the rocks.</p>
<p><q>'The car<name type="GPE">ri</name>on-fowl have been busy about the battle-field,'</q> said �omer.</p>
<p>They rode now at an easy pace and dark came down upon the plains about them. The slow moon mounted, now waxing towards the full, and in its cold silver light the swelling grass-lands rose and fell like a wide grey sea. They had <name type="GPE">ri</name>dden for some <name type="CARDINAL">four</name> <name type="TIME">hour</name>s from the bran<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g of the roads when they drew near to the <name type="ORG">Ford</name>s. <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ng slopes ran swiftly down to where the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver spread in stony shoals between high grassy terraces. <name type="PERSON">Borne</name> upon the wind they heard the howling of wolves. Their hearts were heavy, remembe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng the many men that had fallen in battle in this place.</p>
<p>The road dipped between <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing turf-banks, carving its way through the terraces to the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver's edge, and up again upon the further side. There were <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> lines of flat stepping-st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s across the stream, and between them <name type="ORG">ford</name>s for horses, that went from either b<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk to a bare eyot in the midst. The <name type="GPE">ri</name>ders looked down upon the crossings, and it seemed strange to them; for the <name type="ORG">Ford</name>s had ever been a place full of the rush and chatter of water upon st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s; but now they were silent. The beds of the stream were almost dry, a bare waste of shingles and grey sand.</p>
<p><q>'This is become a dreary place,'</q> said �omer. <q>'What sickness has befallen the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver? Many fair things <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> has destroyed: has he devoured the sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ngs of <name type="PERSON">Isen</name> too?'</q> <q>'So it would seem,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Alas</name>!'</q> said Th�oden. <q>'Must we pass this way, where the car<name type="GPE">ri</name>on-beasts devour so many good <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s of the <name type="PERSON">Mark</name>?'</q></p>
<p><q>'This is our way,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'G<name type="GPE">ri</name>evous is <name type="DATE">the fall</name> of your men; but you shall see that at least the wolves of the mountains do not devour them. It is with their f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends, the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s, that they hold their feast: such indeed is the f<name type="GPE">ri</name>endship of their kind. Come!'</q></p>
<p>They rode down to the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver, and as they came the wolves ceased their howling and slunk away. Fear fell on them seeing <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> in the moon, and <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>fax his horse shining like silver. The <name type="GPE">ri</name>ders passed over to the islet, and glitte<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng eyes watched them <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ly from the shadows of the banks.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'F<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends have laboured here.'</q></p>
<p>And they saw that in the midst of the eyot a mound was piled, <name type="GPE">ri</name>nged with st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s, and set about with many spears.</p>
<p><q>'Here lie all the <name type="ORG">Men</name> of the <name type="PERSON">Mark</name> that fell near this place,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>.</p>
<p><q>'Here let them rest!'</q> said �omer. <q>'And when their spears have rotted and rusted, long still may their mound stand and guard the <name type="ORG">Ford</name>s of <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>!'</q></p>
<p><q>'Is this your work also, <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, my f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end?'</q> said Th�oden. <q>'You accomplished much in an <name type="TIME">evening</name> and <name type="TIME">a <name type="TIME">night</name></name>!'</q></p>
<p><q>'With the help of <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>fax � and others,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'I rode fast and far. But here beside the mound I will say this for your comfort: many fell in the battles of the <name type="ORG">Ford</name>s, but fewer than rumour made them. More were scattered than were slain; I gathered together all that I could find. Some men I sent with <name type="PERSON">G<name type="GPE">ri</name>m</name>bold of <name type="LOC">West</name>fold to join <name type="ORG">Erkenbrand</name>. Some I set to make this bu<name type="GPE">ri</name>al. They have now followed your <name type="PERSON">mar</name>shal, <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name>helm. I sent him with many <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s to <name type="ORG">Edoras</name>. <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> I knew had despatched his full strength against you, and his servants had turned aside from all other errands and g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> to <name type="PERSON">Helm</name>'s <name type="PERSON">Deep</name>: the lands seemed empty of enemies; yet I feared that <name type="PERSON">wolf</name>-<name type="GPE">ri</name>ders and plunderers might <name type="GPE">ri</name>de n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>theless to <name type="GPE">Meduseld</name>, while it was unde<name type="PERSON">fen</name>ded. But now I think you need not fear: you will find your house to welcome your return.'</q></p>
<p><q>'And glad shall I be to see it again,'</q> said Th�oden, <q>'though b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ef now, I doubt not, shall be my abiding there.'</q></p>
<p>With that the company said farewell to the island and the mound, and passed over the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver, and climbed the further bank. Then they rode on, glad to have left the mournful <name type="ORG">Ford</name>s. As they went the howling of the wolves broke out anew.</p>
<p>There was an ancient highway that ran down from <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard to the crossings. For some way it took its course beside the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver, bending with it east and then north; but at the last it turned away and went straight towards the gates of <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard; and these were under the mountain-side in the west of the valley, <name type="CARDINAL">six</name>teen miles or more from its mouth. This road they followed but they did not <name type="GPE">ri</name>de upon it; for the ground beside it was firm and level, covered for many miles about with short sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>nging turf. They rode now more swiftly, and by <name type="TIME">mid<name type="TIME">night</name></name> the <name type="ORG">Ford</name>s were nearly <name type="CARDINAL">five</name> leagues behind. Then they halted, ending their <name type="TIME">night</name>'s journey, for the <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g was weary. They were come to the feet of the <name type="LOC">Misty <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s</name>, and the long arms of <name type="PERSON">Nan Curun</name>�r stretched down to meet them. Dark lay the <name type="GPE">vale</name> before them, for the moon had passed into the <name type="LOC">West</name>, and its light was hidden by the hills. But out of the deep shadow of the <name type="GPE">dale</name> rose a vast spire of smoke and vapour; as it mounted, it caught the rays of the sinking moon, and spread in shimme<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng billows, black and silver, over the starry sky.</p>
<p><q>'What do you think of that, <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>?'</q> asked <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'<name type="CARDINAL">One</name> would say that all the <name type="ORG">Wizard</name>'s Vale was burning.'</q></p>
<p><q>'There is ever a fume above that valley in these <name type="DATE">day</name>s,'</q> said �omer: <q>'but I have never seen aught like this before. These are steams rather than smokes. <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> is brewing some devilry to greet us. <name type="DATE">May</name>be he is boiling all the waters of <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>, and that is why the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver runs dry.'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="DATE">May</name>be he is,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Tom</name>orrow we shall learn what he is doing. Now let us rest for a while, if we can.'</q></p>
<p>They camped beside the bed of the <name type="PERSON">Isen</name> <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver; it was still silent and empty. Some of them slept a little. But <name type="TIME">late in the <name type="TIME">night</name></name> the watchmen c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed out, and all awoke. The moon was g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Stars</name> were shining above; but over the ground there crept a darkness blacker than the <name type="TIME">night</name>. On both sides of the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver it rolled towards them, going northward.</p>
<p><q>'Stay where you are!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'Draw no weapons! Wait! and it will pass you by!'</q></p>
<p>A mist gathered about them. Above them a few stars still glimmered faintly; but on either side there arose walls of impenetrable gloom; they were in a narrow lane between moving towers of shadow. Voices they heard, whispe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ngs and groanings and an endless rustling sigh; the <name type="LOC">earth</name> shook under them. <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ng it seemed to them that they sat and were afraid; but at last the darkness and the rumour passed, and vanished between the mountain's arms.</p>
<p>Away south upon the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>rn<name type="GPE">burg</name>, in the middle <name type="TIME">night</name> men heard a great noise, as a wind in the valley, and the ground trembled; and all were afraid and no <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> ventured to go forth. But in the <name type="TIME">morning</name> they went out and were amazed; for the slain <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s were g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, and the trees also. <name type="LOC">Far</name> down into the valley of the <name type="PERSON">Deep</name> the grass was crushed and trampled brown, as if giant herdsmen had pastured great droves of cattle there; but <name type="QUANTITY">a mile</name> below the <name type="PERSON">Dike</name> a huge pit had been delved in the <name type="LOC">earth</name>, and over it st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s were piled into a hill. <name type="ORG">Men</name> believed that the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s whom they had slain were bu<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed there; but whether those who had fled into the wood were with them, n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> could say, for no man ever set foot upon that hill. The Death Down it was afterwards called, and no grass would grow there. But the strange trees were never seen in <name type="PERSON">Deep</name>ing-coomb again; they had returned at <name type="TIME">night</name>, and had g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> far away to the dark <name type="GPE">dale</name>s of <name type="PERSON">Fangorn</name>. Thus they were revenged upon the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s.</p>
<p>The king and his company slept no more that <name type="TIME">night</name>; but they saw and heard no other strange thing, save <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>: the voice of the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver beside them suddenly awoke. There was a rush of water hurrying down among the st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s; and when it had passed, the <name type="PERSON">Isen</name> flowed and bubbled in its bed again, as it had ever <name type="PERSON">don</name>e.</p>
<p>At <name type="TIME">dawn</name> they made ready to go on. The light came grey and pale, and they did not see the <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing of the sun. The air above was heavy with fog, and a <name type="GPE">reek</name> lay on the land about them. They went slowly, <name type="GPE">ri</name>ding now upon the highway. It was broad and hard, and well-<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ded. <name type="PERSON">Dimly</name> through the mists they could descry the long arm of the mountains <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing on their left. They had passed into <name type="PERSON">Nan Curun</name>�r, the <name type="ORG">Wizard</name>'s Vale. That was a sheltered valley, open only to the <name type="LOC">South</name>. Once it had been fair and green, and through it the <name type="PERSON">Isen</name> flowed, already deep and strong before it found the plains; for it was <name type="ORG">fed</name> by many sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ngs and lesser streams among the rain-washed hills. and all about it there had lain a pleasant, fertile land.</p>
<p>It was not so now. Beneath the walls of <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard there still were acres tilled by the slaves of <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>; but most of the valley had become a wilderness of weeds and thorns. Brambles trailed upon the ground, or clambe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng over <name type="PERSON">bush</name> and bank, made shaggy caves where small beasts housed. No trees grew there; but among the rank grasses could still be seen the burned and axe<name type="PERSON">-he</name>wn stumps of ancient groves. It was a sad country, silent now but for the stony noise of quick waters. Smokes and steams d<name type="GPE">ri</name>fted in sullen clouds and lurked in the hollows. The <name type="GPE">ri</name>ders did not speak. Many doubted in their hearts, wonde<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng to what dismal end their journey led.</p>
<p>After they had <name type="GPE">ri</name>dden for some miles, the highway became a wide street, paved with great flat st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s, squared and laid with skill; no blade of grass was seen in any joint. <name type="PERSON">Deep</name> gutters, filled with t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ckling water. ran down on either side. Suddenly a tall pillar loomed up before them. It was black; and set upon it was a great st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, carved and painted in the likeness of a long <name type="ORG">White Hand</name>. Its finger pointed north. Not far now they knew that the gates of <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard must stand, and their hearts were heavy; but their eyes could not pierce the mists ahead.</p>
<p>Beneath the mountain's arm within the <name type="ORG">Wizard</name>'s Vale through <name type="DATE">year</name>s uncounted had stood that ancient place that <name type="ORG">Men</name> called <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard. Partly it was shaped in the making of the mountains, but mighty works the <name type="ORG">Men</name> of <name type="LOC">West</name>ernesse had wrought there of old; and <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> had dwelt there long and had not been idle.</p>
<p>This was its fashion, while <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> was at his h<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name>, accounted by many the chief of <name type="ORG">Wizard</name>s. A great <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng-wall of st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, like towe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng cliffs, stood out from the shelter of the mountain-side, from which it ran and then returned again. <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> entrance only was there made in it, a great arch delved in the southern wall. Here through the black rock a long tunnel had been hewn, closed at either end with mighty doors of iron. They were so wrought and poised upon their huge hinges, posts of steel d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ven into the living st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, that when unbarred they could be moved with a light thrust of the arms, noiselessly. <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> who passed in and came at length out of the echoing tunnel, beheld a plain, a great circle, somewhat hollowed like a vast shallow bowl: <name type="QUANTITY">a mile</name> it measured from <name type="GPE">ri</name>m to <name type="GPE">ri</name>m. Once it had been green and filled with avenues, and groves of fruitful trees, watered by streams that flowed from the mountains to a lake. But no green thing grew there in the latter <name type="DATE">day</name>s of <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>. The roads were paved with st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>-flags, dark and hard; and beside their borders instead of trees there <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ched long lines of pillars, some of <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ble, some of copper and of iron. joined by heavy c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>ns.</p>
<p>Many houses there were, chambers, halls, and passages, cut and tunnelled back into the walls upon their inner side, so that all the open circle was overlooked by countless windows and dark doors. <name type="CARDINAL">Thousands</name> could dwell there, workers, servants, slaves, and war<name type="GPE">ri</name>ors with great store of arms; wolves were <name type="ORG">fed</name> and stabled in deep dens beneath. The plain, too, was bored and delved. <name type="PERSON">Shafts</name> were d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ven deep into the ground; their upper ends were covered by low mounds and domes of st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, so that in the moonlight the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> of <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard looked like a graveyard of unquiet dead. For the ground trembled. The shafts ran down by many slopes and spiral stairs to caverns far under; there <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> had treasu<name type="GPE">ri</name>es, store-houses, armou<name type="GPE">ri</name>es, smithies, and great furnaces. Iron wheels revolved there endlessly, and hammers thudded. At <name type="TIME">night</name> plumes of vapour steamed from the vents, lit from beneath with red light, or blue, or venomous green.</p>
<p>To the centre all the roads ran between their c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>ns. There stood a tower of <name type="PERSON">mar</name>vellous shape. It was fashi<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>d by the builders of old, who smoothed the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> of <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard, and yet it seemed a thing not made by the craft of <name type="ORG">Men</name>, but <name type="GPE">ri</name>ven from the b<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s of the <name type="LOC">earth</name> in the ancient torment of the hills. A peak and isle of rock it was. black and gleaming hard: <name type="CARDINAL">four</name> mighty piers of many-sided st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> were welded into <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, but near the summit they opened into gaping horns. their pinnacles sharp as the points of spears, keen-edged as knives. Between them was a narrow space, and there upon a floor of polished st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, w<name type="GPE">ri</name>t<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> with strange signs, a man might stand <name type="CARDINAL">five</name> <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name> feet above the plain. This was <name type="PERSON">Orthanc</name>, the citadel of <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>, the name of which had (by design or chance) a <name type="CARDINAL">two</name>fold meaning; for in the <name type="PERSON">Elvish</name> speech _orthanc_ signifies <name type="PERSON">Mount Fang</name>, but in the language of the <name type="PERSON">Mark</name> of old <name type="WORK_OF_ART">the Cunning Mind</name>.</p>
<p>A strong place and wonderful was <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard, and long it had been beautiful; and there great lords had dwelt, the wardens of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> upon the <name type="LOC">West</name>, and wise men that watched the stars. But <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> had slowly shaped it to his shifting purposes, and made it better. as he thought, being deceived-for all those arts and subtle devices, for which he forsook his former wisdom, and which fondly he imagined were his own. came but from <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>; so that what he made was naught, only a little copy, a child's model or a slave's flattery, of that vast fortress. armoury, p<name type="GPE">ri</name>son, furnace of great power, <name type="FAC">Barad-d</name>�r, the Dark <name type="FAC">Tower</name>, which suffered no <name type="GPE">ri</name>val, and laughed at flattery, biding its time, <name type="ORG">sec</name>ure in its p<name type="GPE">ri</name>de and its immeasurable strength.</p>
<p>This was the stronghold of <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>, as fame reported it; for within living memory the men of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> had not passed its gates, save perhaps a few, such as <name type="ORG">Worm</name>tongue, who came in <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret and told no man what they saw.</p>
<p>Now <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> rode to the great pillar of the Hand, and passed it: and as he did so the <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s saw to their wonder that the Hand appeared no longer white. It was stained as with d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed blood; and looking closer they perceived that its nails were red. Unheeding <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> rode on into the mist, and reluctantly they followed him. All about them now, as if there had been a sudden flood. wide pools of water lay beside the road, filling the hollows. and <name type="GPE">ri</name>lls went t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ckling down among the st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s.</p>
<p>At last <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> halted and beck<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>d to them; and they came, and saw that beyond him the mists had cleared, and a pale sunlight sh<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. <name type="TIME">The <name type="TIME">hour</name></name> of <name type="TIME">noon</name> had passed. They were come to the doors of <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard.</p>
<p>But the doors lay hurled and twisted on the ground. And all about, st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, cracked and splintered into countless jagged shards, was scattered far and wide, or piled in ruinous heaps. The great arch still stood, but it opened now upon a roofless chasm: the tunnel was laid bare. and through the cliff-like walls on either side great rents and breaches had been torn; their towers were bea<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> into dust. If the Great <name type="LOC">Sea</name> had <name type="GPE">ri</name>sen in wrath and fallen on the hills with storm. it could have worked no greater ruin.</p>
<p>The <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng beyond was filled with steaming water: a bubbling cauldron, in which there heaved and floated a wreckage of beams and spars, chests and casks and broken gear. Twisted and leaning pillars reared their splintered stems above the flood. but all the roads were drowned. <name type="LOC">Far</name> off, it seemed, <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> veiled in winding cloud, there loomed the island rock. Still dark and tall, unbroken by the storm, the tower of <name type="PERSON">Orthanc</name> stood. Pale waters lapped about its feet.</p>
<p>The king and all his company sat silent on their horses, <name type="PERSON">mar</name>velling, perceiving that the power of <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> was overthrown; but how they could not guess. And now they turned their eyes towards the archway and the ruined gates. There they saw close beside them a great rubble<name type="PERSON">-he</name>ap; and suddenly they were aware of <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> small figures lying on it at their ease, grey-clad, hardly to be seen among the st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s. There were bottles and bowls and platters laid beside them, as if they had just ea<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> well, and now rested from their labour. <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> seemed asleep; the other, with crossed legs and arms behind his head, leaned back against a broken rock and sent from his mouth long wisps and little <name type="GPE">ri</name>ngs of thin blue smoke.</p>
<p>For a moment Th�oden and �omer and all his men stared at them in wonder. Amid all the wreck of <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard this seemed to them the strangest sight. But before the king could speak, the small smoke-breathing figure became suddenly aware of them, as they sat there silent on the edge of the mist. He sprang to his feet. A young man he looked, or like <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, though not much more than <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> a man in h<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name>; his head of brown curling <name type="PERSON">hai</name>r was uncovered, but he was clad in a travel-stained cloak of the same hue and shape as the companions of <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> had worn when they rode to <name type="ORG">Edoras</name>. He bowed very low. putting his hand upon his breast. Then, seeming not to observe the wizard and his f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends, he turned to �omer and the king.</p>
<p><q>'Welcome, my lords, to <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard!'</q> he said. <q>'We are the <name type="GPE">doorwardens</name>. <name type="PERSON">Me<name type="GPE">ri</name>adoc</name>, son of <name type="PERSON">Saradoc</name> is my name; and my companion, who, alas! is overcome with wea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ness' � here he gave the other a dig with his foot � 'is <name type="PERSON">Pereg<name type="GPE">ri</name>n</name>, son of <name type="PERSON">Paladin</name>, of the house of <name type="PERSON">Took</name>. <name type="LOC">Far</name> in the <name type="LOC">North</name> is our home. The <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> is within; but at the moment he is closeted with <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> <name type="ORG">Worm</name>tongue, or doubtless he would be here to welcome such honourable guests.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Doubtless he would!'</q> laughed <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'And was it <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> that ordered you to guard his damaged doors, and watch for the ar<name type="GPE">ri</name>val of guests, when your at<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>tion could be spared from plate and bottle?'</q></p>
<p><q>'No, good sir, the matter escaped him,'</q> answered <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> gravely <q>'He has been much occupied. Our orders came from <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard, who has taken over the management of <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard. He commanded me to welcome the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> with fitting words. I have <name type="PERSON">don</name>e my best.'</q></p>
<p><q>'And what about your companions? What about <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> and me?'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>, unable to contain himself longer. <q>'You rascals, you woolly-footed and wool-pated truants! A fine hunt you have led us! <name type="CARDINAL">Two</name> <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name> leagues, through <name type="PERSON">fen</name> and forest, battle and death, to rescue you! And here we find you feasting and idling-and smoking! Smoking! Where did you come by the weed, you villains? <name type="PERSON">Hammer</name> and tongs! I am so torn between rage and joy, that if I do not burst. it will be a <name type="PERSON">mar</name>vel!'</q></p>
<p><q>'You speak for me, <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>,'</q> laughed <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. <q>'Though I would so<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>r learn how they came by the wine.'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="CARDINAL">One</name> thing you have not found in your hunting, and that's b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ghter wits,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>, opening an eye. <q>'Here you find us sitting on a field of victory, amid the plunder of armies, and you wonder how we came by a few well-earned comforts!'</q></p>
<p><q>'Well-earned?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. <q>'I cannot believe that!'</q></p>
<p>The <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s laughed. <q>'It cannot be doubted that we witness the meeting of dear f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends,'</q> said Th�oden. <q>'So these are the lost <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s of your company, <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>? <name type="DATE">The <name type="DATE">day</name></name>s are fated to be filled with <name type="PERSON">mar</name>vels. Already I have seen many since I left my house; and now here before my eyes stand yet another of the folk of legend. Are not these the <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>flings, that some among us call the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>lbytlan?'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbits, if you please, lord,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbits?'</q> said Th�oden. <q>'Your tongue is strangely changed; but the name sounds not unfitting so. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbits! No report that I have heard does justice to the truth.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Merry</name> bowed; and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> got up and bowed low. <q>'You are gracious, lord; or I hope that I may so take your words,'</q> he said. <q>'And here is another <name type="PERSON">mar</name>vel! I have <name type="PERSON">wan</name>dered in many lands, since I left my home, and never till now have I found people that knew any story concerning hobbits.'</q></p>
<p><q>'My people came out of the <name type="LOC">North</name> <name type="DATE">long ago</name>,'</q> said Th�oden. <q>'But I will not deceive you: we know no tales about hobbits. All that is said among us is that far away, over many hills and <name type="GPE">ri</name>vers, live the <name type="CARDINAL">half</name>ling folk that dwell in holes in sand-dunes. But there are no legends of their deeds. for it is said that they do little, and avoid the sight of men, being able to vanish in a twinkling: and they can change their voices to resemble the piping of birds. But it seems that more could be said.'</q></p>
<p><q>'It could indeed, lord,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>.</p>
<p><q>'For <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> thing,'</q> said Th�oden, <q>'I had not heard that they spouted smoke from their mouths.'</q></p>
<p><q>'That is not surp<name type="GPE">ri</name>sing,'</q> answered <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>; <q>'for it is an art which we have not practised for more than a few generations. It was Tobold <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>rnblower, of <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ngbot<name type="PERSON">tom</name> in the <name type="LOC">South</name>farthing, who <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> grew the true pipe-weed in his gardens, about <name type="DATE">the <name type="DATE">year</name></name> 1070 according to our reckoning. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w old <name type="PERSON">Toby</name> came by the plant...'</q></p>
<p><q>'You do not know your danger, Th�oden,'</q> interrupted <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'These hobbits will sit on the edge of ruin and discuss the pleasures of the table, or the small doings of their fathers, grandfathers, and great-grandfathers, and remoter cousins to the <name type="ORDINAL">ninth</name> degree, if you encourage them with undue patience. Some other time would be more fitting for the history of smoking. Where is <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard, <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>?'</q></p>
<p><q>'Away on the north side, I believe. He went to get a d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk-of clean water. Most of the other <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s are with him, still busy at their work � over there.'</q> <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> waved his hand towards the steaming lake; and as they looked, they heard a distant rumbling and rattling, as if an avalanche was falling from the mountain-side. <name type="LOC">Far</name> away came a <name type="PERSON">_<name type="PERSON">hoom</name></name>-hom_, as of horns blowing t<name type="GPE">ri</name>umphantly.</p>
<p><q>'And is <name type="PERSON">Orthanc</name> then left unguarded?'</q> asked <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>.</p>
<p><q>'There is the water,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'But <name type="GPE">Quickbeam</name> and some others are wat<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g it. Not all those posts and pillars in the plain are of <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>'s planting. <name type="GPE">Quickbeam</name>, I think, is by the rock, near the foot of the stair.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Yes, a tall grey <name type="ORG">Ent</name> is there,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>, <q>'but his arms are at his sides, and he stands as still as a door-tree.'</q></p>
<p><q>'It is past <name type="TIME">noon</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, <q>'and we at any rate have not ea<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> since <name type="TIME">early <name type="TIME">morning</name></name>. Yet I wish to see <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard as soon as may be. Did he leave me no message, or has plate and bottle d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ven it from your mind?'</q></p>
<p><q>'He left a message,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>, <q>'and I was coming to it, but I have been hindered by many other questions. I was to say that, if the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd of the <name type="PERSON">Mark</name> and <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> will <name type="GPE">ri</name>de to the northern wall they will find <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard there, and he will welcome them. I may add that they will also find food of the best there, it was discovered and selected by your humble servants.'</q> He bowed.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> laughed. <q>'That is better!'</q> he said. <q>'Well, Th�oden. will you <name type="GPE">ri</name>de with me to find <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard? We must go round about, but it is not far. When you see <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard, you will learn much. For <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard is <name type="PERSON">Fangorn</name>, and the eldest and chief of the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s, and when you speak with him you will hear the speech of the oldest of all living things.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I will come with you,'</q> said Th�oden. <q>'<name type="LOC">Far</name>ewell, my hobbits! <name type="DATE">May</name> we meet again in my house! There you shall sit beside me and tell me all that your hearts desire: the deeds of your grandsires, as far as you can reckon them; and we will speak also of <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Tobold the Old</name> and his herb-lore. <name type="LOC">Far</name>ewell!'</q></p>
<p>The hobbits bowed low. <q>'So that is the <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> in an undert<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. <q>'A fine old fellow. Very polite.'</q></p>
</chapter><chapter num="9"><heading>Chapter 9</heading>
<p>Flotsam and Jetsam</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> and the <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g's company rode away, turning eastward to make the circuit of the ruined walls of <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard. But <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>, <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>, and <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> remained behind. Leaving <name type="GPE">Arod</name> and <name type="PERSON">Hasufel</name> to stray in search of grass, they came and sat beside the hobbits.</p>
<p><q>'Well, well! The hunt is over, and we meet again at last, where n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of us ever thought to come,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>.</p>
<p><q>'And now that the great <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s have g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> to discuss high matters,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>, <q>'the hunters can perhaps learn the answers to their own small <name type="GPE">ri</name>ddles. We tracked you as far as the forest, but there are still many things that I should like to know the truth of.'</q></p>
<p><q>'And there is a great deal, too, that we <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t to know about you ' said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. 'We have learnt a few things through <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard, the Old <name type="ORG">Ent</name>, but that is not nearly enough.'</q></p>
<p><q>'All in good time,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. <q>'We were the hunters, and you should give an account of yourselves to us <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Or <name type="ORG">sec</name>ond,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. <q>'It would go better after a meal. I have a sore head; and it is past mid-<name type="DATE">day</name>. You truants might make amends by finding us some of the plunder that you spoke of. Food and d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk would pay off some of my score against you.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Then you shall have it,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q>'Will you have it here, or in more comfort in what's left of <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>'s guard-house � over there under the arch? We had to picnic out here, so as to keep an eye on the road.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Less than an eye!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. <q>'But I will not go into any orc-house nor touch <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s' meat or anything that they have mauled.'</q></p>
<p><q>'We wouldn't ask you to,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'We have had enough of <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s ourselves to last a life-time. But there were many other folk in <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard. <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> kept enough wisdom not to trust his <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s. He had <name type="ORG">Men</name> to guard his gates: some of his most faithful servants, I suppose. Anyway they were favoured and got good provisions.'</q></p>
<p><q>'And pipe-weed?'</q> asked <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>.</p>
<p><q>'No, I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t think so,'</q> <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> laughed. <q>'But that is another story, which can wait until after lunch.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Well let us go and have lunch then!'</q> said the <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Dwarf</name>.</p>
<p>The hobbits led the way; and they passed under the arch and came to a wide door upon the left, at the top of a stair. It opened direct into a large chamber, with other smaller doors at the far end, and a h<name type="LOC">earth</name> and chimney at <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> side. The chamber was hewn out of the st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>; and it must once have been dark, for its windows looked out only into the tunnel. But light came in now through the broken roof. On the h<name type="LOC">earth</name> wood was burning.</p>
<p><q>'I lit a bit of fire,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q>'It cheered us up in the fogs. There were few faggots about, and most of the wood we could find was wet. But there is a great draught in the chimney: it seems to wind away up through the rock, and fortunately it has not been blocked. A fire is handy. I will make you some toast. The bread is <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> or <name type="CARDINAL">four</name> <name type="DATE">day</name>s old, I am afraid.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> and his companions sat themselves down at <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> end of a long table, and the hobbits disappeared through <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the inner doors. <q>'Store-room in there, and above the woods, luckily,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>, as they came back laden with dishes, bowls, cups, knives, and food of va<name type="GPE">ri</name>ous sorts.</p>
<p><q>'And you need not turn up your nose at the provender, Master <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'This is not orc-stuff, but man-food, as <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard calls it. Will you have wine or beer? There's a barrel inside there � very passable. And this is <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>-rate salted pork. Or I can cut you some rashers of bacon and broil them, if you like. I am sorry there is no green stuff: the delive<name type="GPE">ri</name>es have been rather interrupted in the last few <name type="DATE">day</name>s! I cannot offer you anything to follow but butter and h<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>y for your bread. Are you con<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>t?'</q></p>
<p><q>'Indeed yes,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. <q>'The score is much reduced.'</q></p>
<p>The <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> were soon busy with their meal; and the <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> hobbits, unabashed, set to a <name type="ORG">sec</name>ond time. <q>'We must keep our guests company,'</q> they said.</p>
<p><q>'You are full of courtesy this <name type="TIME">morning</name>,'</q> laughed <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. <q>'But maybe. if we had not ar<name type="GPE">ri</name>ved, you would already have been keeping <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> another company again.'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="DATE">May</name>be; and why not?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q>'We had foul fare with the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s, and little enough for <name type="DATE">day</name>s before that. It seems a long while since we could eat to heart's con<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>t.'</q></p>
<p><q>'It does not seem to have <name type="PERSON">don</name>e you any harm,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'Indeed you look in the bloom of health.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Aye, you do indeed,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>, looking them up and down over the top of his cup. <q>'Why, your <name type="PERSON">hai</name>r is twice as thick and curly as when we parted; and I would swear that you have both grown somewhat, if that is possible for hobbits of your age. This <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard at any rate has not starved you.'</q></p>
<p><q>'He has not,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'But <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s only d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk, and d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk is not enough for con<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>t. <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard's draughts may be nou<name type="GPE">ri</name>shing, but <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> feels the need of something solid. And even _lembas_ is n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> the worse for a change.'</q></p>
<p><q>'You have drunk of the waters of the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s, have you?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. <q>'Ah, then I think it is likely that <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>'s eyes do not deceive him. Strange songs have been sung of the draughts of <name type="PERSON">Fangorn</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Many strange tales have been told about that land,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'I have never entered it. Come, tell me more about it, and about the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s!'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="ORG">Ent</name>s,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>, <q>'<name type="ORG">Ent</name>s are � well <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s are all different for on thing. But their eyes now, their eyes are very odd.'</q> He t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed a few fumbling words that trailed off into silence. <q>'Oh, well,'</q> he went on, <q>'you have seen some at a distance, already-they saw you at any rate, and reported that you were on the way-and you will see many others, I expect, before you leave here. You must form your own ideas.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Now, now!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. <q>'We are beginning the story in the middle. I should like a tale in the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght order, starting with that strange <name type="DATE">day</name> when our fellowship was broken.'</q></p>
<p><q>'You shall have it, if there is time,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'But <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>-if you have finished eating-you shall fill your pipes and light up. And then for a little while we can pre<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>d that we are all back safe at <name type="PERSON">Bree</name> again, or in <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name>.'</q></p>
<p>He produced a small leather bag full of tobacco. <q>'We have heaps of it,'</q> he said; <q>'and you can all pack as much as you wish, when we go. We did some salvage-work this <name type="TIME">morning</name>, <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> and I. There are lots of things floating about. It was <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> who found <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> small barrels, washed up out of some cellar or store-house, I suppose. When we opened them, we found they were filled with this: as fine a pipe-weed as you could wish for, and quite unspoilt.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> took some and rubbed it in his palms and snif<name type="ORG">fed</name> it. <q>'It feels good, and it smells good,'</q> he said.</p>
<p><q>'It is good!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'My dear <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>, it is <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ngbot<name type="PERSON">tom</name> Leaf! There were the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>rnblower brand<name type="PERSON">mar</name>ks on the barrels, as plain as plain. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w it came here, I can't imagine. For <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>'s p<name type="GPE">ri</name>vate use. I fancy. I never knew that it went so far abroad. But it comes in handy now?'</q></p>
<p><q>'It would,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>, <q>'if I had a pipe to go with it. <name type="PERSON">Alas</name>, I lost mine in <name type="GPE">Mo<name type="GPE">ri</name>a</name>, or before. Is there no pipe in all your plunder?'</q></p>
<p><q>'No, I am afraid not,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'We have not found any, not even here in the guardrooms. <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> kept this dainty to himself. it seems. And I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t think it would be any use knocking on the doors of <name type="PERSON">Orthanc</name> to beg a pipe of him! We shall have to share pipes. as good f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends must at a pinch.'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Hal</name>f a moment!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. Putting his hand inside the breast of his jacket he pulled out a little soft wallet on a st<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng. <q>'I keep a treasure or <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> near my skin, as precious as <name type="ORG">Ring</name>s to me. Here's <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>: my old wooden pipe. And here's another: an unused <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. I have car<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed it a long way,, though I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t know why. I never really expected to find any pipe-weed on the journey, when my own ran out. But now it comes in useful after all.'</q> He held up a small pipe with a wide flat<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed bowl, and handed it to <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. <q>'Does that settle the score between us?'</q> he said. <q>'Settle it!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. <q>'Most noble hobbit, it leaves me deep in your debt.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Well, I am going back into the open air, to see what the wind and sky are doing!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>.</p>
<p><q>'We will come with you,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>.</p>
<p>They went out and seated themselves upon the piled st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s before the gateway. They could see far down into the valley now; the mists were lifting and floating away upon the breeze.</p>
<p><q>'Now let us take our ease here for a little!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'We will sit on the edge of ruin and talk, as <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> says, while he is busy elsewhere. I feel a wea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ness such as I have seldom felt before.'</q> He wrapped his grey cloak about him, hiding his mail-shirt, and stretched out his long legs. Then he lay back and sent from his lips a thin stream of smoke.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q>'<name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> the <name type="PRODUCT">Ranger</name> has come back!'</q></p>
<p><q>'He has never been away,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'I am <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> and D�nadan too, and I belong both to <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> and the <name type="LOC">North</name>.'</q></p>
<p>They smoked in silence for a while, and the sun sh<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> on them; slanting into the valley from among white clouds high in the <name type="LOC">West</name>. <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> lay still, looking up at the sun and sky with steady eyes, and singing softly to himself. At last he sat up. <q>'Come now!'</q> he said. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Tim</name>e wears on, and the mists are blowing away, or would if you strange folk did not wreathe yourselves in smoke. What of the tale?'</q></p>
<p><q>'Well, my tale begins with waking up in the dark and finding myself all strung-up in an orc-camp,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q>'Let me see, what is to<name type="DATE">day</name>?'</q></p>
<p><q>'The <name type="ORDINAL">fifth</name> of <name type="DATE">March</name> in the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>-reckoning,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> made some calculations on his fingers. <q>'<name type="DATE">Only <name type="CARDINAL">nine</name> <name type="DATE">day</name>s ago</name>!'</q> he said.*1 <q>'It seems <name type="DATE">a <name type="DATE">year</name></name> since we were caught. Well, though <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> of it was like a bad dream, I reckon that <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> very hor<name type="GPE">ri</name>ble <name type="DATE">day</name>s followed. <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> will correct me, if I forget anything imp<name type="GPE">ortan</name>t: I am not going into details: the whips and the filth and s<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ch and all that; it does not bear remembe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng.'</q> With that he plunged into an account of <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>'s last fight and the orc-<name type="PERSON">mar</name>ch from <name type="ORG">Emyn Muil</name> to the <name type="ORG">Forest</name>. The others nodded as the va<name type="GPE">ri</name>ous points were fitted in with their guesses.</p>
<p><q>'Here are some treasures that you let fall,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'You will be glad to have them back.'</q> He loosened his belt from under his cloak and took from it the <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> sheathed knives.</p>
<p><q>'Well!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'I never expected to see those again! I <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ked a few orcs with mine; but <name type="PRODUCT">Ugl</name><name type="PRODUCT">�k</name> took them from us. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w he glared! At <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> I thought he was going to stab me, but he threw the things away as if they burned him.'</q></p>
<p><q>'And here also is your brooch, <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'I have kept it safe, for it is a very precious thing.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I know,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q>'It was a wrench to let it go; but what else could I do?'</q></p>
<p><q>'Nothing else,'</q> answered <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'<name type="CARDINAL">One</name> who cannot cast away a treasure at need is in fetters. You did <name type="GPE">ri</name>ghtly.'</q></p>
<p><q>'The cutting of the bands on your w<name type="GPE">ri</name>sts, that was s<name type="PERSON">mar</name>t work!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. <q>'Luck served you there; but you seized your chance with both hands, <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> might say.'</q></p>
<p><q>'And set us a pretty <name type="GPE">ri</name>ddle,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. <q>'I wondered if you had grown wings!'</q></p>
<p><q>'Unfortunately not,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q>'But you did not know about <name type="PERSON">G<name type="GPE">ri</name>shn<name type="PRODUCT">�k</name>h</name>.'</q> He shuddered and said no more, leaving <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> to tell of those last hor<name type="GPE">ri</name>ble moments: the pawing hands, the hot breath, and the dreadful strength of <name type="PERSON">G<name type="GPE">ri</name>shn<name type="PRODUCT">�k</name>h</name>'s <name type="PERSON">hai</name>ry arms.</p>
<p><q>'All this about the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s of <name type="FAC">Barad-d</name>�r, <name type="GPE">Lugb</name>�rz as they call it, makes me uneasy,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'The Dark <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd already knew too much and his servants also; and <name type="PERSON">G<name type="GPE">ri</name>shn<name type="PRODUCT">�k</name>h</name> evidently sent some message across the <name type="LOC">River</name> after the quarrel. The Red <name type="PRODUCT">Eye</name> will be looking towards <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard. But <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> at any rate is in a cleft stick of his own cutting.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Yes, whichever side wins, his outlook is poor,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'Things began to go all wrong for him from the moment his <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s set foot in <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q>'We caught a glimpse of the old villain, or so <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> hints,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. <q>'On the edge of the <name type="ORG">Forest</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q>'When was that?'</q> asked <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="CARDINAL">Five</name> <name type="TIME">night</name>s ago,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>.</p>
<p><q>'Let me see,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>: <q>'<name type="CARDINAL">five</name> <name type="TIME">night</name>s ago-now we come to a part of the story you know nothing about. We met <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard that <name type="TIME">morning</name> after the battle; and that <name type="TIME">night</name> we were at <name type="ORG">Wellinghall</name>, <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of his ent-houses. <name type="TIME">The next <name type="TIME">morning</name></name> we went to <name type="ORG">Ent</name>moot, a gathe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng of <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s, that is, and the queerest thing I have ever seen in my life. It lasted all that <name type="DATE">day</name> and the next; and we spent the <name type="TIME">night</name>s with an <name type="ORG">Ent</name> called <name type="GPE">Quickbeam</name>. And then late in the <name type="TIME">after<name type="TIME">noon</name></name> in the <name type="ORDINAL">third</name> <name type="DATE">day</name> of their moot, the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s suddenly blew up. It was amazing. The <name type="ORG">Forest</name> had felt as <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>se as if a thunderstorm was brewing inside it: then all at once it exploded. I wish you could have heard their song as they <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ched.'</q></p>
<p><q>'If <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> had heard it, he would be <name type="CARDINAL">a <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name></name> miles away by now, even if he had had to run on his own legs,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>.</p>
<p>'Though <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard be strong and hard, as cold as st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> and bare as b<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>,</p>
<p>We go, we go, we go to war, to hew the st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> and break the door!</p>
<p>There was very much more. A great deal of the song had no words, and was like a music of horns and drums. It was very exciting. But I thought it was only <name type="PERSON">mar</name><name type="PERSON">chin</name>g music and no more, just a song � until I got here. I know better now.'</p>
<p><q>'We came down over the last <name type="GPE">ri</name>dge into <name type="PERSON">Nan Curun</name>�r, after <name type="TIME">night</name> had fallen,'</q> <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> continued. 'It was then that I <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> had the feeling that the <name type="ORG">Forest</name> itself was moving behind us. I thought I was dreaming an entish dream, but <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> had noticed it too. We were both f<name type="GPE">ri</name>gh<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed; but we did not find out more about it until later.</p>
<p>'It was the <name type="GPE">Huorn</name>s, or so the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s call them in "short language". <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard won't say much about them, but I think they are <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s that have become almost like trees, at least to look at. They stand here and there in the wood or under its eaves, silent, wat<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g endlessly over the trees; but deep in the darkest <name type="GPE">dale</name>s there are <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name>s and <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name>s of them, I believe.</p>
<p>'There is a great power in them, and they seem able to wrap themselves in shadow: it is difficult to see them moving. But they do. They can move very quickly, if they are angry. You stand still looking at the weather, maybe, or lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing to the rustling of the wind, and then suddenly you find that you are in the middle of a wood with great groping trees all around you. They still have voices, and can speak with the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s � that is why they are called <name type="GPE">Huorn</name>s, <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard says � but they have become queer and wild. Dangerous. I should be ter<name type="GPE">ri</name>fied of meeting them, if there were no true <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s about to look after them.</p>
<p>'Well, in the <name type="TIME">early <name type="TIME">night</name></name> we crept down a long ravine into the upper end of the <name type="ORG">Wizard</name>'s Vale, the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s with all their rustling <name type="GPE">Huorn</name>s behind. We could not see them, of course, but the whole air was full of creaking. It was very dark, a cloudy <name type="TIME">night</name>. They moved at a great speed as soon as they had left the hills, and made a noise like a rushing wind. The <name type="PERSON">Moon</name> did not appear through the clouds, and not long after <name type="TIME">mid<name type="TIME">night</name></name> there was a tall wood all round the north side of <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard. There was no sign of enemies nor of any challenge. There was a light gleaming from a high window in the tower, that was all.</p>
<p>'<name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard and a few more <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s crept on, <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght round to within sight of the great gates. <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> and I were with him. We were sitting on <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard's shoulders, and I could feel the quive<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>seness in him. But even when they are roused, <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s can be very cautious and patient. They stood still as carved st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s, breathing and lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing.</p>
<p><q>'Then all at once there was a tremendous stir. Trumpets blared and the walls of <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard echoed. We thought that we had been discovered, and that battle was going to begin. But nothing of the sort. All <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>'s people were <name type="PERSON">mar</name><name type="PERSON">chin</name>g away. I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t know much about this war, or about the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>rsemen of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>, but <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> seems to have meant to finish off the king and all his men with <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> final blow. He emptied <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard. I saw the enemy go: endless lines of <name type="PERSON">mar</name><name type="PERSON">chin</name>g <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s; and troops of them mounted on great wolves. And there were battalions of <name type="ORG">Men</name>, too. Many of them car<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed torches, and in the flare I could see their faces. Most of them were ordinary men, rather tall and dark-<name type="PERSON">hai</name>red, and g<name type="GPE">ri</name>m but not particularly evil-looking. But there were some others that were hor<name type="GPE">ri</name>ble: man-high, but with goblin-faces, sallow, lee<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng, squint-eyed. Do you know, they reminded me at once of that <name type="LOC">South</name>erner at <name type="PERSON">Bree</name>: only he was not so obviously orc-like as most of these were.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I thought of him too,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'We had many of these <name type="CARDINAL">half</name>-orcs to deal with at <name type="PERSON">Helm</name>'s <name type="PERSON">Deep</name>. It seems plain now that that <name type="LOC">South</name>erner was a spy of <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>'s; but whether he was working with the <name type="ORG">Black</name> <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s, or for <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, I do not know. It is difficult with these evil folk to know when they are in league, and when they are cheating <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> another.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Well, of all sorts together, there must have been <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> thousand at the very least,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'They took <name type="TIME">an <name type="TIME">hour</name></name> to pass out of the gates. Some went off down the highway to the <name type="ORG">Ford</name>s, and some turned away : and went eastward. A b<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge has been built down there, about <name type="QUANTITY">a mile</name> away, where the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver runs in a very deep channel. You could see it now, if you stood up. They were all singing with harsh voices, and laughing, making a hideous din. I thought things looked very black for <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>. But <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard did not move. He said: 'My business is with <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard to<name type="TIME">night</name>, with rock and st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>.'</q></p>
<p>'But, though I could not see what was happening in the dark, I believe that <name type="GPE">Huorn</name>s began to move south, as soon as the gates were shut again. Their business was with <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s I think. They were far down the valley in the <name type="TIME">morning</name>; or any rate there was a shadow there that <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> couldn't see through.</p>
<p>'As soon as <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> had sent off all his army, our turn came. <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard put us down, and went <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name> the gates, and began hamme<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng on the doors, and calling for <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>. There was no answer, except arrows and st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s from the walls. But arrows are no use against <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s. They hurt them, of course, and infu<name type="GPE">ri</name>ate them: like stinging flies. But an <name type="ORG">Ent</name> can be stuck as full of orc-arrows as a pin-cushion, and take no se<name type="GPE">ri</name>ous harm. They cannot be pois<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>d, for <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> thing; and their skin seems to be very thick, and tougher than bark. It takes a very heavy axe-stroke to wound them se<name type="GPE">ri</name>ously. They <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t like axes. But there would have to be a great many axe-men to <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> <name type="ORG">Ent</name>: a man that hacks once at an <name type="ORG">Ent</name> never gets a chance of a <name type="ORG">sec</name>ond blow. A punch from an <name type="ORG">Ent</name>-fist crumples up iron like thin tin.</p>
<p>'When <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard had got a few arrows in him, he began to warm up, to get positively "hasty", as he would say. He let out a great <name type="PERSON">_<name type="PERSON">hoom</name></name>-hom_, and <name type="CARDINAL">a <name type="CARDINAL">dozen</name></name> more <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s came st<name type="GPE">ri</name>ding up. An angry <name type="ORG">Ent</name> is ter<name type="GPE">ri</name>fying. Their fingers, and their toes, just freeze on to rock; and they tear it up like bread-crust. It was like wat<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g the work of great tree-roots in <name type="CARDINAL">a <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name></name> <name type="DATE">year</name>s, all packed into <name type="TIME">a few moments</name>.</p>
<p><q>'They pushed, pulled, tore, shook, and hammered; and _clang-bang_, _crash-crack_, in <name type="CARDINAL">five</name> <name type="TIME">minutes</name> they had these huge gates just lying in ruin; and some were already beginning to eat into the walls, like rabbits in a sand-pit. I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t know what <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> thought was happening; but anyway he did not know how to deal with it. His wizardry may have been falling off lately, of course; but anyway I think he has not much g<name type="GPE">ri</name>t, not much plain courage al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> in a tight place without a lot of slaves and ma<name type="PERSON">chin</name>es and things, if you know what I mean. Very different from old <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. I wonder if his fame was not all along mainly due to his cleverness in settling at <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard.'</q></p>
<p><q>'No,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'Once he was as great as his fame made him. His knowledge was deep, his thought was subtle, and his hands <name type="PERSON">mar</name>vellously skilled; and he had a power over the minds of others. The wise he could persuade, and the smaller folk he could daunt. That power he certainly still keeps. There are not many in <name type="LOC">Middle-<name type="LOC">earth</name></name> that I should say were safe, if they were left al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> to talk with him, even now when he has suffered a defeat. <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name>, and <name type="PERSON">Galad<name type="GPE">ri</name>el</name>, perhaps, now that his wickedness has been laid bare, but very few others.'</q></p>
<p><q>'The <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s are safe,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. 'He seems at <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> time to have got round them, but never again. And anyway he did not understand them; and he made the great mistake of leaving them out of his calculations. He had no plan for them, and there was no time to make any, once they had set to work. As soon as our attack began, the few remaining rats in <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard started bolting through every hole that the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s made. The <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s let the <name type="ORG">Men</name> go, after they had questi<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>d them, <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> or <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> <name type="CARDINAL">dozen</name> only down at this end. I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t think many orc-folk, of any size, escaped. Not from the <name type="GPE">Huorn</name>s: there was a wood full of them all round <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard by that time, as well as those that had g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> down the valley.</p>
<p>'When the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s had reduced a large part of the southern walls to rubbish, and what was left of his people had bolted and deserted him, <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> fled in a panic. He seems to have been at the gates when we ar<name type="GPE">ri</name>ved: I expect he came to watch his splendid army <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ch out. When the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s broke their way in, he left in a hurry. They did not spot him at <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>. But the <name type="TIME">night</name> had opened out, and there was a great light of stars, quite enough for <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s to see by, and suddenly <name type="GPE">Quickbeam</name> gave a cry "The tree-killer, the tree-killer!" <name type="GPE">Quickbeam</name> is a gentle creature, but he hates <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> all the more fiercely for that: his people suffered cruelly from orc-axes. He leapt down the path from the inner gate, and he can move like a wind when he is roused. There was a pale figure hurrying away in and out of the shadows of the pillars, and it had nearly reached the stairs to the tower-door. But it was a near thing. <name type="GPE">Quickbeam</name> was so hot after him, that he was within a step or <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> of being caught and strangled when he slipped in through the door.</p>
<p>'When <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> was safe back in <name type="PERSON">Orthanc</name>, it was not long before he set some of his precious ma<name type="PERSON">chin</name>ery to work. By that time there were many <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s inside <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard: some had followed <name type="GPE">Quickbeam</name>, and others had burst in from the north and east; they were roaming about and doing a great deal of damage. Suddenly up came fires and foul fumes: the vents and shafts all over the plain began to spout and belch. Several of the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s got scorched and blistered. <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> of them, Beechb<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> I think he was called, a very tall handsome <name type="ORG">Ent</name>, got caught in a spray of some liquid fire and burned like a torch: a hor<name type="GPE">ri</name>ble sight.</p>
<p>'That sent them mad. I thought that they had been really roused before; but I was wrong. I saw what it was like at last. It was stagge<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng. They roared and boomed and trumpeted, until st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s began to crack and fall at the mere noise of them. <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> and I lay on the ground and stuf<name type="ORG">fed</name> our cloaks into our ears. Round and round the rock of <name type="PERSON">Orthanc</name> the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s went st<name type="GPE">ri</name>ding and storming like a howling gale, breaking pillars, hurling avalanches of boulders down the shafts, tossing up huge slabs of st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> into the air like leaves. The tower was in the middle of a spinning whirlwind. I saw iron posts and blocks of masonry go rocketing up <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name>s of feet, and smash against the windows of <name type="PERSON">Orthanc</name>. But <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard kept his head. He had not had any burns, luckily. He did not <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t his folk to hurt themselves in their fury, and he did not <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> to escape out of some hole in the confusion. Many of the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s were hurling themselves against the <name type="PERSON">Orthanc</name>-rock; but that defeated them. It is very smooth and hard. Some wizardry is in it, perhaps, older and stronger than <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>'s. Anyway they could not get a g<name type="GPE">ri</name>p on it, or make a crack in it; and they were bruising and wounding themselves against it. 'So <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard went out into the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng and shouted. His enormous voice rose above all the din. There was a dead silence, suddenly. In it we heard a sh<name type="GPE">ri</name>ll laugh from a high window in the tower. That had a queer effect on the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s. They had been boiling over; now they became cold, g<name type="GPE">ri</name>m as ice, and quiet. They left the plain and gathered round <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard, standing quite still. He spoke to them for a little in their own language; I think he was telling them of a plan he had made in his old head long before. Then they just faded silently away in the grey light. Day was <name type="TIME">dawn</name>ing by that time.</p>
<p>'They set a watch on the tower, I believe, but the watchers were so well hidden in shadows and kept so still, that I could not see them. The others went away north. All that <name type="DATE">day</name> they were busy, out of sight. Most of the time we were left al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. It was a dreary <name type="DATE">day</name>; and we <name type="PERSON">wan</name>dered about a bit, though we kept out of the view of the windows of <name type="PERSON">Orthanc</name>, as much as we could: they stared at us so threa<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ingly. A good deal of the time we spent looking for something to eat. And also we sat and talked, wonde<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng what was happening away south in <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>, and what had become of all the rest of our <name type="ORG">Company</name>. Every now and then we could hear in the distance the rattle and fall of st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, and thudding noises echoing in the hills.</p>
<p>'In the <name type="TIME">after<name type="TIME">noon</name></name> we walked round the circle, and went to have a look at what was going on. There was a great shadowy wood of <name type="GPE">Huorn</name>s at the head of the valley, and another round the northern wall. We did not dare to go in. But there was a rending, tea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng noise of work going on inside. <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s and <name type="GPE">Huorn</name>s were digging great pits and trenches, and making great pools and dams, gathe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng all the waters of the <name type="PERSON">Isen</name> and every other sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng and stream that they could find. We left them to it.</p>
<p>'At <name type="TIME">dusk</name> <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard came back to the gate. He was humming and booming to himself, and seemed pleased. He stood and stretched his great arms and legs and breathed deep. I asked him if he was tired.</p>
<p>' "Tired?" he said, "tired? Well no, not tired, but stiff. I need a good draught of <name type="ORG">Ent</name>wash. We have worked hard; we have <name type="PERSON">don</name>e more st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>-cracking and <name type="LOC">earth</name>-gnawing to<name type="DATE">day</name> than we have <name type="PERSON">don</name>e in many a long <name type="DATE">year</name> before. But it is nearly finished. When <name type="TIME">night</name> falls do not linger near this gate or in the old tunnel! Water may come through-and it will be foul water for a while, until all the filth of <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> is washed away. Then <name type="PERSON">Isen</name> can run clean again." He began to pull down a bit more of the walls, in a leisurely sort of way, just to amuse himself.</p>
<p>'We were just wonde<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng where it would be safe to lie and get some sleep, when the most amazing thing of all happened. There was the sound of a <name type="GPE">ri</name>der coming swiftly up the road. <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> and I lay quiet, and <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard hid himself in the shadows under the arch. Suddenly a great horse came st<name type="GPE">ri</name>ding up, like a flash of silver. It was already dark. but I could see the <name type="GPE">ri</name>der's face clearly: it seemed to shine, and all his clothes were white. I just sat up, sta<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng, with my mouth open. I t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed to call out, and couldn't.</p>
<p><q>'There was no need. He halted just by us and looked down at us. '<name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>!'</q> I said at last. but my voice was only a whisper. Did he say: "<name type="ORG">Hullo</name>, <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>! This is a pleasant surp<name type="GPE">ri</name>se!"? No, indeed! He said: "Get up, you <name type="PERSON">tom</name>-fool of a <name type="PERSON">Took</name>! Where, in the name of wonder, in all this ruin is <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard? I <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t him. Quick!"</p>
<p>'<name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard heard his voice and came out of the shadows at once; and there was a strange meeting. I was surp<name type="GPE">ri</name>sed, because neither of them seemed surp<name type="GPE">ri</name>sed at all. <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> obviously expected to find <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard here; and <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard might almost have been loite<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng about near the gates on purpose to meet him. Yet we had told the old <name type="ORG">Ent</name> all about <name type="GPE">Mo<name type="GPE">ri</name>a</name>. But then I remembered a queer look he gave us at the time. I can only suppose that he had seen <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> or had some news of him, but would not say anything in a hurry. "<name type="PERSON">Don</name>'t be hasty" is his motto; but nobody, not even <name type="ORG">Elves</name>, will say much about <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>'s movements when he is not there.</p>
<p>'"<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>om! <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>!" said <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard. "I am glad you have come. <name type="PERSON">Wood</name> and water, stock and st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, I can master; but there is a <name type="ORG">Wizard</name> to manage here."</p>
<p>'"<name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard," said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. "I need your help. You have <name type="PERSON">don</name>e much, but I need more. I have about <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> thousand <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s to manage."</p>
<p>'Then those <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> went off and had a council together in some corner. It must have seemed very hasty to <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard, for <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> was in a tremendous hurry, and was already talking at a great pace, before they passed out of hea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng. They were only away a matter of <name type="TIME">minutes</name>, perhaps <name type="CARDINAL">a quarter</name> of <name type="TIME">an <name type="TIME">hour</name></name>. Then <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> came back to us, and he seemed relieved, almost merry. He did say he was glad to see us, then.</p>
<p>'"But <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>," I c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed, "where have you been? And have you seen the others?"</p>
<p>'"Wherever I have been, I am back," he answered in the genuine <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> manner. "Yes, I have seen some of the others. But news must wait. This is a pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>lous <name type="TIME">night</name>, and I must <name type="GPE">ri</name>de fast. But the <name type="TIME">dawn</name> may be b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ghter; and if so, we shall meet again. Take care of yourselves, and keep away from <name type="PERSON">Orthanc</name>! Good-bye!"</p>
<p>'<name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard was very thoughtful after <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> had g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. He had evidently learnt a lot in a short time and was digesting it. He looked at us and said: "Hm, well, I find you are not such hasty folk as I thought. You said much less than you might, and not more than you should. Hm, this is a bundle of news and no mistake! Well, now <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard must get busy again."</p>
<p>'Before he went, we got a little news out of him; and it did not cheer us up at all. But for the moment we thought more about you <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> than about <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, or about poor <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>. For we gathered that there was a great battle going on, or soon would be, and that you were in it, and might never come out of it.</p>
<p>'"<name type="GPE">Huorn</name>s will help," said <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard. Then he went away and we did not see him again until this <name type="TIME">morning</name>.</p>
<p>'It was <name type="TIME">deep <name type="TIME">night</name></name>. We lay on top of a pile of st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, and could see nothing beyond it. Mist or shadows blotted out everything like a great blanket all round us. The air seemed hot and heavy; and it was full of rustlings, creakings, and a murmur like voices passing. I think that <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name>s more of the <name type="GPE">Huorn</name>s must have been passing by to help in the battle. Later there was a great rumble of thunder away south, and flashes of lightning far away across <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>. Every now and then we could see mountain-peaks, miles and miles away, stab out suddenly, black and white, and then vanish. And behind us there were noises like thunder in hills, but different. At times the whole valley echoed.</p>
<p>'It must have been <name type="TIME">about <name type="TIME">mid<name type="TIME">night</name></name></name> when the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s broke the dams and poured all the gathered waters through a gap in the northern wall, down into <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard. The <name type="GPE">Huorn</name>-dark had passed, and the thunder had rolled away. The <name type="PERSON">Moon</name> was sinking behind the western mountains.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard began to fill up with black creeping streams and pools. They glittered in the last light of the <name type="PERSON">Moon</name>, as they spread over the plain. Every now and then the waters found their way down into some shaft or spouthole. Great white steams hissed up. Smoke rose in billows. There were explosions and gusts of fire. <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> great coil of vapour went whirling up, twisting round and round <name type="PERSON">Orthanc</name>, until it looked like a tall peak of cloud, fiery underneath and moonlit above. And still more water poured in, until at last <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard looked like a huge flat saucepan, all steaming and bubbling.'</q></p>
<p><q>'We saw a cloud of smoke and steam from the south <name type="TIME">last <name type="TIME">night</name></name> when we came to the mouth of <name type="PERSON">Nan Curun</name>�r,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'We feared that <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> was brewing some new devilry for us.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Not he!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. 'He was probably choking and not laughing any more. By the <name type="TIME">morning</name>, yester<name type="DATE">day</name> <name type="TIME">morning</name>, the water had sunk down into all the holes, and there was a dense fog. We took refuge in that guardroom over there; and we had rather a f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght. The lake began to overflow and pour out through the old tunnel, and the water was rapidly <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing up the steps. We thought we were going to get caught like <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s in a hole; but we found a winding stair at the back of the store-room that brought us out on top of the arch. It was a squeeze to get out, as the passages had been cracked and <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> blocked with fallen st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> near the top. There we sat high up above the floods and watched the drowning of <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard. The <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s kept on pou<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng in more water, till all the fires were quenched and every cave filled. The fogs slowly gathered together and steamed up into a huge umbrella of cloud: it must have been <name type="QUANTITY">a mile</name> high. In the <name type="TIME">evening</name> there was a great rainbow over the eastern hills; and then the sunset was blotted out by a thick d<name type="GPE">ri</name>zzle on the mountain-sides. It all went very quiet. A few wolves howled mournfully, far away. The <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s stopped the inflow in the <name type="TIME">night</name>, and sent the <name type="PERSON">Isen</name> back into its old course. And that was the end of it all.</p>
<p><q>'Since then the water has been sinking again. There must be outlets somewhere from the caves underneath, I think. If <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> peeps out of any of his windows, it must look an untidy, dreary mess. We felt very l<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>ly. Not even a visible <name type="ORG">Ent</name> to talk to in all the ruin; and no news. We spent the <name type="TIME">night</name> up on top there above the arch, and it was cold and damp and we did not sleep. We had a feeling that anything might happen at <name type="TIME">any minute</name>. <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> is still in his tower. There was a noise in the <name type="TIME">night</name> like a wind coming up the valley. I think the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s and <name type="GPE">Huorn</name>s that had been away came back then; but where they have all g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> to now, I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t know. It was a misty, moisty <name type="TIME">morning</name> when we climbed down and looked round again, and nobody was about. And that is about all there is to tell. It seems almost peaceful now after all the turmoil. And safer too, somehow, since <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> came back. I could sleep!'</q></p>
<p>They all fell silent for a while. <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> re-filled his pipe. <q>'There is <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> thing I wonder about,'</q> he said as he lit it with his flint and tinder: <q>'<name type="ORG">Worm</name>tongue. You told Th�oden he was with <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w did he get there?'</q></p>
<p><q>'Oh yes, I forgot about him,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. 'He did not get here till this <name type="TIME">morning</name>. We had just lit the fire and had some breakfast when <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard appeared again. We heard him <name type="PERSON">hoom</name>ing and calling our names outside.</p>
<p><q>'"I have just come round to see how you are fa<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng, my lads,'</q> he said; 'and to give you some news. <name type="GPE">Huorn</name>s have come back. All's well; aye very well indeed!" he laughed, and slapped his thighs. "No more <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s in <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard, no more axes! And there will be folk coming up from the <name type="LOC">South</name> before the <name type="DATE">day</name> is old; some that you may be glad to see."</p>
<p>'He had hardly said that, when we heard the sound of hoofs on the road. We rushed out before the gates, and I stood and stared, <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> expecting to see <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> and <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> come <name type="GPE">ri</name>ding up at the head of an army. But out of the mist there rode a man on an old tired horse; and he looked a queer twisted sort of creature himself. There was no <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> else. When he came. out of the mist and suddenly saw all the ruin and wreckage in front of him, he sat and <name type="PERSON">gape</name>d, and his face went almost green. He was so bewildered that he did not seem to notice us at <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>. When he did, he gave a cry, and t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed to turn his horse round and <name type="GPE">ri</name>de off. But <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard took <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> st<name type="GPE">ri</name>des, put out a long arm, and lifted him out of the saddle. His horse bolted in terror, and he grovelled on the ground. He said he was <name type="PERSON">Gr�ma</name>, f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end and counsellor of the king, and had been sent with imp<name type="GPE">ortan</name>t messages from Th�oden to <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>.</p>
<p>'"No <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> else would dare to <name type="GPE">ri</name>de through the open land, so full of foul <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s," he said, "so I was sent. And I have had a pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>lous journey, and I am hungry and weary. I fled far north out of my way, pursued by wolves."</p>
<p>'I caught the sidelong looks he gave to <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard, and I said to myself "liar". <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard looked at him in his long slow way for several <name type="TIME">minutes</name>, till the wretched man was squirming on the floor. Then at last he said: "Ha, hm, I was expecting you, Master <name type="ORG">Worm</name>tongue." The man started at that name. "<name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> got here <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>. So I know as much about you as I need, and I know what to do with you. Put all the rats in <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> trap, said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>; and I will. I am the master of <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard now, but <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> is locked in his tower; and you can go there and give him all the messages that you can think of."</p>
<p>'"Let me go, let me go!" said <name type="ORG">Worm</name>tongue. "I know the way."</p>
<p>'"You knew the way, I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t doubt," said <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard. "But things have changed here a little. Go and see!"</p>
<p>'He let <name type="ORG">Worm</name>tongue go, and he limped off through the arch with us close behind, until he came inside the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng and could see all the floods that lay between him and <name type="PERSON">Orthanc</name>. Then he turned to us.</p>
<p>'"Let me go away!" he whined. "Let me go away! My messages are useless now."</p>
<p>'"They are indeed," said <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard. "But you have <name type="CARDINAL">only <name type="CARDINAL">two</name></name> choices: to stay with me until <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> and your master ar<name type="GPE">ri</name>ve; or to cross the water. Which will you have?"</p>
<p>'The man shivered at the mention of his master, and put a foot into the water; but he drew back. "I cannot swim," he said.</p>
<p>'"The water is not deep," said <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard. "It is dirty, but that will not harm you, Master <name type="ORG">Worm</name>tongue. In you go now!"</p>
<p>'With that the wretch floundered off into the flood. It rose up nearly to his neck before he got too far away for me to see him. The last I saw of him was clinging to some old barrel or piece of wood. But <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard waded after him, and watched his progress.</p>
<p><q>'"Well, he has g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> in," he said when he returned. "I saw him crawling up the steps like a draggled rat. There is some<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> in the tower still: a hand came out and pulled him in. So there he is, and I hope the welcome is to his liking. Now I must go and wash myself clean of the slime. I'll be away up on the north side, if any<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ts to see me. There is no clean water down here fit for an <name type="ORG">Ent</name> to d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk. or to bathe in. So I will ask you <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> lads to keep a watch at the gate for the folk that are coming. There'll be the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd of the Fields of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>, <name type="PERSON">mar</name>k you! You must welcome him as well as you know how: his men have fought a great fight with the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s. <name type="DATE">May</name>be, you know the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght fashion of <name type="ORG">Men</name>'s words for such a lord, better than <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s. There have been many lords in the green fields in my time, and I have never learned their speech or their names. They will be <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ting man-food, and you know all about that, I guess. So find what you think is fit for a king to eat, if you can." And that is the end of the story. Though I should like to know who this <name type="ORG">Worm</name>tongue is. Was he really the king's counsellor?'</q></p>
<p><q>'He was,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>; <q>'and also <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>'s spy and servant in <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>. Fate has not been kinder to him than he deserves. The sight of the ruin of all that he thought so strong and magnificent must have been almost punishment enough. But I fear that worse awaits him.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Yes, I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t suppose <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard sent him to <name type="PERSON">Orthanc</name> out of kindness,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. 'He seemed rather g<name type="GPE">ri</name>mly delighted with the business and was laughing to himself when he went to get his bathe and d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk. We spent a busy time after that, sear<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g the flotsam, and rummaging about. We found <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> or <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> store-rooms in different places nearby, above the flood-level. But <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard sent some <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s down, and they car<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed off a great deal of the stuff.</p>
<p>'"We <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t man-food for <name type="CARDINAL">twenty</name>-<name type="CARDINAL">five</name>," the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s said, so you can see that somebody had counted your company carefully before you ar<name type="GPE">ri</name>ved. You <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> were evidently meant to go with the great people. But you would not have fared any better. We kept as good as we sent, I promise you. Better, because we sent no d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk.</p>
<p>'"What about d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk?" I said to the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s.</p>
<p><q>'"There is water of <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>," they said, "and that is good enough for <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s and <name type="ORG">Men</name>." But I hope that the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s may have found time to brew some of their draughts from the mountain-sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ngs, and we shall see <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>'s beard curling when he returns. After the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s had g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, we felt tired, and hungry. But we did not grumble � our labours had been well rewarded. It was through our search for man-food that <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> discovered the p<name type="GPE">ri</name>ze of all the flotsam, those <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>rnblower barrels. "Pipe-weed is better after food," said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>; that is how the situation arose.'</q></p>
<p><q>'We understand it all perfectly now,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>.</p>
<p><q>'All except <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> thing,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>: <q>'leaf from the <name type="LOC">South</name>farthing in <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard. The more I consider it, the more cu<name type="GPE">ri</name>ous I find it. I have never been in <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard, but I have journeyed in this land, and I know well the empty count<name type="GPE">ri</name>es that lie between <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> and the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>. Neither goods nor folk have passed that way for many a long <name type="DATE">year</name>, not openly. <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> had <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret dealings with some<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> in the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>, I guess. <name type="ORG">Worm</name>tongues may be found in other houses than <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g Th�oden's. Was there a date on the barrels?'</q></p>
<p><q>'Yes,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q>'It was the <name type="CARDINAL">1<name type="CARDINAL">4</name>17</name> crop, that is <name type="DATE">last <name type="DATE">year</name></name>'s; no, <name type="DATE">the <name type="DATE">year</name></name> before, of course, now: <name type="DATE">a good <name type="DATE">year</name></name>.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Ah well, whatever evil was afoot is over now, I hope; or else it is beyond our reach at present,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'Yet I think I shall mention it to <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, small matter though it may seem among his great affairs.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I wonder what he is doing,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'<name type="TIME">The <name type="TIME">after<name type="TIME">noon</name></name></name> is getting on. Let us go and look round! You can enter <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard now at any rate, <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>, if you <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t to. But it is not a very cheerful sight.'</q></p>

<p>The Voice of <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name></p>
<p>They passed through the ruined tunnel and stood upon a heap of st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s, gazing at the dark rock of <name type="PERSON">Orthanc</name>, and its many windows, a menace still in the desolation that lay all about it. The waters had now nearly all subsided. Here and there gloomy pools remained, covered with scum and wreckage; but most of the wide circle was bare again, a wilderness of slime and tumbled rock, pitted with blackened holes, and dotted with posts and pillars leaning drunkenly this way and that. At the <name type="GPE">ri</name>m of the shattered bowl there lay vast mounds and slopes, like the shingles cast up by a great storm; and beyond them the green and tangled valley ran up into the long ravine between the dark arms of the mountains. Across the waste they saw <name type="GPE">ri</name>ders picking their way; they were coming from the north side, and already they were drawing near to <name type="PERSON">Orthanc</name>.</p>
<p><q>'There is <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, and Th�oden and his men!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. <q>'Let us go and meet them!'</q></p>
<p><q>'Walk wa<name type="GPE">ri</name>ly!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'There are loose slabs that may tilt up and throw you down into a pit, if you <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t take care.'</q></p>
<p>They followed what was left of the road from the gates to <name type="PERSON">Orthanc</name>, going slowly, for the flag-st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s were cracked and slimed. The <name type="GPE">ri</name>ders, seeing them approach, halted under the shadow of the rock and waited for them. <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> rode forward to meet them.</p>
<p><q>'Well, <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard and I have had some interesting discussions, and made a few plans,'</q> he said; <q>'and we have all had some much-needed rest. Now we must be going on again. I hope you companions have all rested, too, and refreshed yourselves?'</q></p>
<p><q>'We have,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'But our discussions began and ended in smoke. Still we feel less ill-disposed towards <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> than we did.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Do you indeed?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'Well, I do not. I have now a last task to do before I go: I must pay <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> a farewell visit. Dangerous, and probably useless; but it must be <name type="PERSON">don</name>e. Those of you who wish may come with me � but beware! And do not jest! This is not the time for it.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I will come,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. <q>'I wish to see him and learn if he really looks like you.'</q></p>
<p><q>'And how will you learn that, Master <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Dwarf</name>?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> could look like me in your eyes, if it suited his purpose with you. And are you yet wise enough to detect all his counterfeits? Well, we shall see, perhaps. He may be shy of showing himself before many different eyes together. But I have ordered all the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s to remove themselves from sight, so perhaps we shall persuade him to come out.'</q></p>
<p><q>'What's the danger?'</q> asked <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q>'Will he shoot at us, and pour fire out of the windows; or can he put a spell on us from a distance?'</q></p>
<p><q>'The last is most likely, if you <name type="GPE">ri</name>de to his door with a light heart,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'But there is no knowing what he can do, or may choose to try. A wild beast cornered is not safe to approach. And <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> has powers you do not guess. Beware of his voice!'</q></p>
<p>They came now to the foot of <name type="PERSON">Orthanc</name>. It was black, and the rock gleamed as if it were wet. The many faces of the st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> had sharp edges as though they had been newly chiselled. A few sco<name type="GPE">ri</name>ngs. and small flake-like splinters near the base, were all the <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ks that it bore of the fury of the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s.</p>
<p>On the eastern side, in the angle of <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> piers, there was a great door, high above the ground; and over it was a shuttered window, opening upon a balcony hedged with iron bars. Up to the threshold of the door there mounted a flight of <name type="CARDINAL">twenty</name>-<name type="CARDINAL">seven</name> broad stairs, hewn by some unknown art of the same black st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. This was the only entrance to the tower; but many tall windows were cut with deep embrasures in the climbing walls: far up they peered like little eyes in the sheer faces of the horns.</p>
<p>At the foot of the stairs <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> and the king dismounted. <q>'I will go up,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'I have been in <name type="PERSON">Orthanc</name> and I know my pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>l.'</q></p>
<p><q>'And I too will go up,'</q> said the king. <q>'I am old, and fear no pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>l any more. I wish to speak with the enemy who has <name type="PERSON">don</name>e me so much wrong. �omer shall come with me, and see that my aged feet do not falter.'</q></p>
<p><q>'As you will,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> shall come with me. Let the others await us at the foot of the stairs. They will hear and see enough, if there is anything to hear or see.'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Nay</name>!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> and I wish for a closer view. We al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> here represent our kindred. We also will come behind.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Come then!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, and with that he climbed the steps, and Th�oden went beside him.</p>
<p>The <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> sat uneasily upon their horses, on either side of the stair, and looked up darkly at the great tower, fea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng what might befall their lord. <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> sat on the bot<name type="PERSON">tom</name> step, feeling both unimp<name type="GPE">ortan</name>t and unsafe.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Hal</name>f a sticky mile from here to the gate!'</q> muttered <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q>'I wish I could slip off back to the guardroom unnoticed! What did we come for? We are not <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ted.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> stood before the door of <name type="PERSON">Orthanc</name> and beat on it with his staff. It rang with a hollow sound. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>, <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>!'</q> he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed in a loud commanding voice. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> come forth!'</q></p>
<p>For some time there was no answer. At last the window above the door was unbarred, hut no figure could be seen at its dark opening.</p>
<p><q>'Who is it?'</q> said a voice. <q>'What do you wish?'</q></p>
<p>Th�oden started. <q>'I know that voice,'</q> he said, <q>'and I curse the <name type="DATE">day</name> when I <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed to it.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Go and fetch <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>, since you have become his footman, <name type="PERSON">Gr�ma</name> <name type="ORG">Worm</name>tongue!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'And do not waste our time!'</q></p>
<p>The window closed. They waited. Suddenly another voice spoke, low and melodious, its very sound an enchantment. Those who lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed unwa<name type="GPE">ri</name>ly to that voice could seldom report the words that they heard; and if they did, they wondered, for little power remained in them. Mostly they remembered only that it was a delight to hear the voice speaking, all that it said seemed wise and reasonable, and desire awoke in them by swift agreement to seem wise themselves. When others spoke they seemed harsh and uncouth by contrast; and if they gainsaid the voice, anger was kindled in the hearts of those under the spell. Fur some the spell lasted only while the voice spoke to them, and when it spake to another they smiled, as men do who see through a juggler's t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ck while others <name type="PERSON">gape</name> at it. For many the sound of the voice al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> was enough to hold them enthralled; but for those whom it conquered the spell endured when they were far away. and ever they heard that soft voice whispe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng and urging them. But n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> were unmoved; n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> rejected its pleas and its commands without an effort of mind and will, so long as its master had control of it.</p>
<p><q>'Well?'</q> it said now with gentle question. <q>'Why must you disturb my rest? Will you give me no peace at all by <name type="TIME">night</name> or <name type="DATE">day</name>?'</q> Its t<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> was that of a kindly heart agg<name type="GPE">ri</name>eved by inju<name type="GPE">ri</name>es undeserved.</p>
<p>They looked up, astonished, for they had heard no sound of his coming; and they saw a figure standing at the rail, looking down upon them: an old man, swathed in a great cloak, the colour of which was not easy to tell, for it changed if they moved their eyes or if he stirred. His face was long, with a high forehead, he had deep darkling eyes, hard to fathom, though the look that they now bore was grave and benevolent, and a little weary. His <name type="PERSON">hai</name>r and beard were white, but strands of black still showed about his lips and ears.</p>
<p><q>'Like, and yet unlike,'</q> muttered <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>.</p>
<p><q>'But come now,'</q> said the soft voice. <q>'<name type="CARDINAL">Two</name> at least of you I know by name. <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> I know too well to have much hope that he seeks help or counsel here. But you, Th�oden <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd of the <name type="PERSON">Mark</name> of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> are declared by your noble devices, and still more by the fair coun<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ance of the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>use of <name type="PERSON">Eorl</name>. O worthy son of <name type="PERSON">Thengel</name> the <name type="PERSON">Thr</name>ice-renowned! Why have you not come before, and as a f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end? Much have I desired to see you, mightiest king of western lands, and especially in <name type="DATE">these latter <name type="DATE">year</name>s</name>, to save you from the unwise and evil counsels that beset you! Is it yet too late? Despite the inju<name type="GPE">ri</name>es that have been <name type="PERSON">don</name>e to me, in which the men of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>, alas! have had some part, still I would save you, and deliver you from the ruin that draws nigh inevitably, if you <name type="GPE">ri</name>de upon this road which you have taken. Indeed I al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> can aid you now.'</q></p>
<p>Th�oden opened his mouth as if to speak, but he said nothing. He looked up at the face of <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> with its dark solemn eyes bent down upon him, and then to <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> at his side; and he seemed to hesitate. <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> made no sign; but stood silent as st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, as <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> waiting patiently for some call that has not yet come. The <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s stirred at <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>, murmu<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng with approval of the words of <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>; and then they too were silent, as men spell-bound. It seemed to them that <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> had never spoken so fair and fittingly to their lord. Rough and proud now seemed all his dealings with Th�oden. And over their hearts crept a shadow, the fear of a great danger: the end of the <name type="PERSON">Mark</name> in a darkness to which <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> was d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ving them, while <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> stood beside a door of escape, holding it <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> open so that a ray of light came through. There was a heavy silence.</p>
<p>It was <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> the dwarf who broke in suddenly. <q>'The words of this wizard stand on their heads,'</q> he growled, g<name type="GPE">ri</name>pping the handle of his axe. <q>'In the language of <name type="PERSON">Orthanc</name> help means ruin, and saving means slaying, that is plain. But we do not come here to beg.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Peace!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>, and for a fleeting moment his voice was less suave, and a light flickered in his eyes and was g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. <q>'I do not speak to you yet, <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> <name type="PRODUCT">Gl�</name>in's son,'</q> he said. '<name type="LOC">Far</name> away is your home and small concern of yours are the troubles of this land. But it was not by design of your own that you became embroiled in them, and so I will not blame such part as you have played-a valiant <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, I doubt not. But I pray you, allow me <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> to speak with the <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>, my neighbour, and once my f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end.</p>
<p><q>'What have you to say, Th�oden <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g? Will you have peace with me, and all the aid that my knowledge, founded in <name type="DATE">long <name type="DATE">year</name>s</name>, can b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng? Shall we make our counsels together against evil <name type="DATE">day</name>s, and repair our inju<name type="GPE">ri</name>es with such good will that our estates shall both come to fairer flower than ever before?'</q></p>
<p>Still Th�oden did not answer. Whether he strove with anger or doubt n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> could say. �omer spoke.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd, hear me!'</q> he said. <q>'Now we feel the pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>l that we were warned of. Have we <name type="GPE">ri</name>dden forth to victory, only to stand at last amazed by an old liar with h<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>y on his forked tongue? So would the trapped <name type="PERSON">wolf</name> speak to the hounds, if he could. What aid can he give to you, forsooth? All he desires is to escape from his plight. But will you parley with this dealer in treachery and murder? Remember <name type="PERSON">Th�odred</name> at the <name type="ORG">Ford</name>s, and the grave of <name type="ORG">H�ma</name> in <name type="PERSON">Helm</name>'s <name type="PERSON">Deep</name>!'</q></p>
<p><q>'If we speak of pois<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>d tongues what shall we say of yours, young serpent?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>, and the flash of his anger was now plain to see. <q>'But come, �omer, �omund's son!'</q> he went on in his soft voice again. To every man h part. Valour in arms is yours, and you win high honour thereby. Slay whom your lord names as enemies, and be con<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>t. Meddle not in policies which you do not understand. But maybe. if you become a king, you Will find that he must choose his f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends with care. The f<name type="GPE">ri</name>endship of <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> and the power of <name type="PERSON">Orthanc</name> cannot be lightly thrown aside, whatever g<name type="GPE">ri</name>evances, real or fancied, may lie behind. You have won a battle but not a war and that with help on which you cannot count again. You may find the <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name> of the <name type="PERSON">Wood</name> at your own door next: it is wayward, and senseless, and has no love for <name type="ORG">Men</name>.</p>
<p>'But my lord of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>, am I to be called a murderer, because valiant men have fallen in battle? If you go to war, needlessly, for I did not desire it, then men will be slain. But if I am a murderer on that account, then all the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>use of <name type="PERSON">Eorl</name> is stained with murder; for they have fought many wars, and assailed many who defied them. Yet with some they have afterwards made peace, n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> the worse for being politic. I say, Th�oden <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g: shall we have peace and f<name type="GPE">ri</name>endship, you and I? It is ours to command '</p>
<p><q>'We will have peace,'</q> said Th�oden at last thickly and with an effort. Several of the <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed out gladly. Th�oden held up his hand. <q>'Yes, we will have peace,'</q> he said, now in a clear voice, <q>'we will have peace, when you and all your works have pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>shed � and the works of your dark master to whom you would deliver us. You are a liar. <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>, and a corrupter of men's hearts. You hold out your hand to me, and I perceive only a finger of the claw of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>. <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Cruel</name> and cold! Even if your war on me was just as it was not, for were you <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> times as wise you would have no <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght to rule me and mine for your own profit as you desired � even so, what will you say of your torches in <name type="LOC">West</name>fold and the children that lie dead there? And they hewed <name type="ORG">H�ma</name>'s body before the gates of the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>rn<name type="GPE">burg</name>, after he was dead. When you hang from a gibbet at your window for the sport of your own crows, I will have peace with you and <name type="PERSON">Orthanc</name>. So much for the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>use of <name type="PERSON">Eorl</name>. A lesser son of great sires am I, but I do not need to lick your fingers. Turn elsewhither. But I fear your voice has lost its charm.'</q></p>
<p>The <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s gazed up at Th�oden like men startled out of a dream. Harsh as an old <name type="PERSON">raven</name>'s their master's voice sounded in their ears after the music of <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>. But <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> for a while was beside himself with wrath. He leaned over the rail as if he would smite the <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g with his staff. To some suddenly it seemed that they saw a snake coiling itself to st<name type="GPE">ri</name>ke.</p>
<p><q>'Gibbets and crows!'</q> he hissed, and they shuddered at the hideous change. <q>'Dotard! What is the house of <name type="PERSON">Eorl</name> but a thatched barn where b<name type="GPE">ri</name>gands d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk in the <name type="GPE">reek</name>, and their brats roll on the floor among the dogs? Too long have they escaped the gibbet themselves. But the noose comes, slow in the drawing, tight and hard in the end. Hang if you will!'</q> Now his voice changed, as he slowly mastered himself. 'I know not why I have had the patience to speak to you. For I need you not, nor your little band of gallopers, as swift to fly as to advance, Th�oden <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>rsemaster. <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ng ago I offered you a state beyond your me<name type="GPE">ri</name>t and your wit. I have offered it again, so that those whom you mislead may clearly see the choice of roads. You give me brag and abuse. So be it. Go back to your huts!</p>
<p><q>'But you, <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>! For you at least I am g<name type="GPE">ri</name>eved, feeling for your shame. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w comes it that you can endure such company? For you are proud, <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>-and not without reason, having a noble mind and eyes that look both deep and far. Even now will you not lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> to my counsel?'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> stirred, and looked up. <q>'What have you to say that you did not say at our last meeting?'</q> he asked. <q>'Or, perhaps, you have things to unsay?'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> paused. <q>'Unsay?'</q> he mused, as if puzzled. <q>'Unsay? I endeavoured to advise you for your own good, but you scarcely lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed. You are proud and do not love advice, having indeed a store of your own wisdom. But on that occasion you erred, I think, misconstruing my in<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>tions wilfully. I fear that in my eagerness to persuade you, I lost patience. And indeed I regret it. For I bore you no ill-will; and even now I bear n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, though you return to me in the company of the violent and the ignorant. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w should I? Are we not both members of a high and ancient order, most excellent in <name type="LOC">Middle-<name type="LOC">earth</name></name>? Our f<name type="GPE">ri</name>endship would profit us both alike. Much we could still accomplish together, to heal the disorders of the world. Let us understand <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> another, and dismiss from thought these lesser folk! Let them wait on our decisions! For the common good I am willing to redress the past, and to receive you. Will you not consult with me? Will you not come up?'</q></p>
<p>So great was the power that <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> exerted in this last effort that n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> that stood within hea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng were unmoved. But now the spell was wholly different. They heard the gentle remonstrance of a kindly king with an er<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng but much-loved minister. But they were shut out, lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing at a door to words not meant for them: ill-mannered children or stupid servants overhea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng the elusive discourse of their elders, and wonde<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng how it would affect their lot. Of loftier mould these <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> were made: reverend and wise. It was inevitable that they should make alliance. <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> would ascend into the tower, to discuss deep things beyond their comprehension in the high chambers of <name type="PERSON">Orthanc</name>. The door would be closed, and they would be left outside, dismissed to await allotted work or punishment. Even in the mind of Th�oden the thought took shape, like a shadow of doubt: <q>'He will betray us; he will go � we shall be lost.'</q></p>
<p>Then <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> laughed. The fantasy vanished like a puff of smoke.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>, <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> still laughing. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>, you missed your path in life. You should have been the king's jester and earned your bread, and st<name type="GPE">ri</name>pes too, by mimicking his counsellors. Ah me!'</q> he paused, getting the better of his mirth. <q>'Understand <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> another? I fear I am beyond your comprehension. But you, <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>, I understand now too well. I keep a clearer memory of your arguments, and deeds, than you suppose. When last I visited you, you were the jailor of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>, and there I was to be sent. <name type="PERSON">Nay</name>, the guest who has escaped from the roof, will think twice before he comes back in by the door. <name type="PERSON">Nay</name>, I do not think I will come up. But lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>, <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>, for the last time! Will you not come down? <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard has proved less strong than your hope and fancy made it. So may other things in which you still have trust. Would it not be well to leave it for a while? To turn to new things, perhaps? Think well, <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>! Will you not come down?'</q></p>
<p>A shadow passed over <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>'s face; then it went deathly white. Before he could conceal it, they saw through the mask the anguish of a mind in doubt, loathing to stay and dreading to leave its refuge. For a <name type="ORG">sec</name>ond he hesitated, and no <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> breathed. Then he spoke, and his voice was sh<name type="GPE">ri</name>ll and cold. P<name type="GPE">ri</name>de and hate were conque<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng him.</p>
<p><q>'Will I come down?'</q> he mocked. <q>'Does an unarmed man come down to speak with robbers out of doors? I can hear you w ell enough here. I am no fool, and I do not trust you, <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. They do not stand openly on my stairs, but I know where the wild wood-demons are lurking, at your command.'</q></p>
<p><q>'The treacherous are ever distrustful,'</q> answered <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> wea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ly. <q>'But you need not fear for your skin. I do not wish to kill you, or hurt you, as you would know, if you really understood me. And I have the power to protect you. I am giving you a last chance. You can leave <name type="PERSON">Orthanc</name>, free � if you choose.'</q></p>
<p><q>'That sounds well,'</q> sneered <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>. <q>'Very much in the manner of <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> the <name type="ORG">Grey</name>: so condescending, and so very kind. I do not doubt that you would find <name type="PERSON">Orthanc</name> commodious, and my departure convenient. But why should I wish to leave? And what do you mean by 'free'? There are conditions, I presume?'</q></p>
<p><q>'Reasons for leaving you can see from your windows.'</q> answered <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'Others will occur to your thought. Your servants are destroyed and scattered; your neighbours you have made your enemies; and you have cheated your new master. or t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed to do so. When his eye turns hither, it will be the red eye of wrath. But when I say 'free', I mean 'free': free from bond, of c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>n or command: to go where you will, even, even to <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>, <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>, if you desire. But you will <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> surrender to me the Key of <name type="PERSON">Orthanc</name>, and your staff. They shall be pledges of your conduct, to be returned later, if you me<name type="GPE">ri</name>t them.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>'s face grew livid, twisted with rage, and a red light was kindled in his eyes. He laughed wildly. <q>'Later!'</q> he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed, and his voice rose to a scream. <q>'Later! Yes, when you also have the Keys of <name type="FAC">Barad-d</name>�r itself, I suppose; and the crowns of <name type="CARDINAL">seven</name> kings. and the rods of the <name type="CARDINAL">Five</name> <name type="ORG">Wizard</name>s, and have purchased yourself a pair of boots many sizes larger than those that you wear now. A modest plan. Hardly <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> in which my help is needed! I have other things to do. Do not be a fool. If you wish to treat with me, while you have a chance, go away, and come back when you are sober! And leave behind these cut-throats and small rag-tag that dangle at your tail! Good <name type="DATE">day</name>!'</q> He turned and left the balcony.</p>
<p><q>'Come back, <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> in a commanding voice. To the amazement of the others, <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> turned again. and as if dragged against his will, he came slowly back to the iron rail, leaning on it, breathing hard. His face was lined and shrunken. His hand clutched his heavy black staff like a claw.</p>
<p><q>'I did not give you leave to go,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> sternly. <q>'I have not finished. You have become a fool, <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>, and yet pitiable. You might still have turned away from folly and evil, and have been of service. But you choose to stay and gnaw the ends of your old plots. Stay then! But I warn you. you will not easily come out again. Not unless the dark hands of the <name type="LOC">East</name> stretch out to take you. <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>!'</q> he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed, and his voice grew in power and autho<name type="GPE">ri</name>ty. <q>'Behold, I am not <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> the <name type="ORG">Grey</name>, whom you betrayed. I am <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> the White, who has returned from death. You have no colour now, and I cast you from the order and from the <name type="ORG">Council</name>.'</q></p>
<p>He raised his hand, and spoke slowly in a clear cold voice. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>, your staff is broken.'</q> There was a crack, and the staff split asunder in <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>'s hand, and the head of it fell down at <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>'s feet. <q>'Go!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. With a cry <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> fell back and crawled away. At that moment a heavy shining thing came hurtling down from above. It glanced off the iron rail, even as <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> left it, and passing close to <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>'s head, it smote the stair on which he stood. The rail rang and snapped. The stair cracked and splintered in glitte<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng sparks. But the ball was unharmed: it rolled on down the steps, a globe of crystal, dark, but glowing with a heart of fire. As it bounded away towards a pool <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> ran after it and picked it up.</p>
<p><q>'The murderous rogue!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed �omer. But <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> was unmoved. No, that was not thrown by <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>, he said; nor even at his bidding, I think. It came from a window far above. A parting shot from Master <name type="ORG">Worm</name>tongue, I fancy, but ill aimed.'</p>
<p><q>'The aim was poor, maybe, because he could not make up his mind which he hated more, you or <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>.</p>
<p><q>'That may be so,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. 'Small comfort will those <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> have in their companionship: they will gnaw <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> another with words. But the punishment is just. If <name type="ORG">Worm</name>tongue ever comes out of <name type="PERSON">Orthanc</name> alive, it will be more than he deserves.</p>
<p><q>'Here, my lad, I'll take that! I did not ask you to handle it,'</q> he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed, turning sharply and seeing <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> coming up the steps, slowly, as if he were bea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng a great w<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name>. He went down to meet him and hastily took the dark globe from the hobbit, wrapping it in the folds of his cloak. <q>'I will take care of this,'</q> he said. <q>'It is not a thing, I guess, that <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> would have chosen to cast away.'</q></p>
<p><q>'But he may have other things to cast,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. <q>'If that is the end of the debate, let us go out of st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>'s throw, at least!'</q></p>
<p><q>'It is the end,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'Let us go.'</q></p>
<p>They turned their backs on the doors of <name type="PERSON">Orthanc</name>, and went down. The <name type="GPE">ri</name>ders <name type="PERSON">hai</name>led the king with joy, and saluted <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. The spell of <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> was broken: they had seen him come at call, and crawl away, dismissed.</p>
<p><q>'Well, that is <name type="PERSON">don</name>e,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'Now I must find <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard and tell him how things have g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q>'He will have guessed, surely?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'Were they likely to end any other way?'</q></p>
<p><q>'Not likely,'</q> answered <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, <q>'though they came to the balance of a <name type="PERSON">hai</name>r. But I had reasons for trying; some merciful and some less so. <name type="ORDINAL">First</name> <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> was shown that the power of his voice was <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ing. He cannot be both tyrant and counsellor. When the plot is <name type="GPE">ri</name>pe it remains no longer <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret. Yet he fell into the trap, and t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed to deal with his victims piece-meal, while others lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed. Then I gave him a last choice and a fair <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>: to renounce both <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> and his p<name type="GPE">ri</name>vate schemes, and make amends by helping us in our need. He knows our need, n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> better. Great service he could have rendered. But he has chosen to withhold it, and keep the power of <name type="PERSON">Orthanc</name>. He will not serve, only command. He lives now in terror of the shadow of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>, and yet he still dreams of <name type="GPE">ri</name>ding the storm. Unhappy fool! He will be devoured, if the power of the <name type="LOC">East</name> stretches out its arms to <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard. We cannot destroy <name type="PERSON">Orthanc</name> from without, but <name type="ORG">Sauron</name> � who knows what he can do?'</q></p>
<p><q>'And what if <name type="ORG">Sauron</name> does not conquer? What will you do to him?'</q> asked <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>.</p>
<p><q>'I? Nothing!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'I will do nothing to him. I do not wish for mastery. What will become of him? I cannot say. I g<name type="GPE">ri</name>eve that so much that was good now festers in the tower. Still for us things have not g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> badly. Strange are the turns of fortune! Of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> does hatred hurt itself! I guess that, even if we had entered in, we could have found few treasures in <name type="PERSON">Orthanc</name> more precious than the thing which <name type="ORG">Worm</name>tongue threw down at us.'</q></p>
<p>A sh<name type="GPE">ri</name>ll sh<name type="GPE">ri</name>ek; suddenly cut off, came from an open window high above.</p>
<p><q>'It seems that <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> thinks so too,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'Let us leave them!'</q></p>
<p>They returned now to the ruins of the gate. Hardly had they passed out under the arch, when, from among the shadows of the piled st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s where they had stood, <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard and <name type="CARDINAL">a <name type="CARDINAL">dozen</name></name> other <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s came st<name type="GPE">ri</name>ding up. <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>, <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> and <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> gazed at them in wonder.</p>
<p><q>'Here are <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> of my companions, <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'I have spoken of them, but you have not yet seen them.'</q> He named them <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> by <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>.</p>
<p>The Old <name type="ORG">Ent</name> looked at them long and sear<name type="PERSON">chin</name>gly, and spoke to them in turn. Last he turned to <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. <q>'So you have come all the way from <name type="GPE">Mirkwood</name>, my good <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name>? A very great forest it used to be!'</q></p>
<p><q>'And still is,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. <q>'But not so great that we who dwell there ever tire of seeing new trees. I should dearly love to journey in <name type="PERSON">Fangorn</name>'s <name type="PERSON">Wood</name>. I scarcely passed beyond the eaves of it, and I did not wish to turn back.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard's eyes gleamed with pleasure. <q>'I hope you may have your wish, ere the hills be much older,'</q> he said.</p>
<p><q>'I will come, if I have the fortune,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. <q>'I have made a bargain with my f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end that, if all goes well, we will visit <name type="PERSON">Fangorn</name> together � by your leave.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Any <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name> that comes with you will be welcome,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard.</p>
<p><q>'The f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end I speak of is not an <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>; <q>'I mean <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>, <name type="PRODUCT">Gl�</name>in's son here.'</q> <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> bowed low, and the axe slipped from his belt and clattered on the ground.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>om, hm! Ah now,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard, looking dark-eyed at him. <q>'A dwarf and an axe-bearer! <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>om! I have good will to <name type="ORG">Elves</name>; but you ask much. This is a strange f<name type="GPE">ri</name>endship!'</q> <q>'Strange it may seem,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>; <q>'but while <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> lives I shall not come to <name type="PERSON">Fangorn</name> al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. His axe is not for trees, but for orc-necks, O <name type="PERSON">Fangorn</name>, Master of <name type="PERSON">Fangorn</name>'s <name type="PERSON">Wood</name>. <name type="CARDINAL">Forty</name>-<name type="CARDINAL">two</name> he hewed in the battle.'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>o! Come now!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard. <q>'That is a better story! Well, well, things will go as they will; and there is no need to hurry to meet them. But now we must part for a while. Day is drawing to an end, yet <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> says you must go ere <name type="TIME">night</name>fall, and the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd of the <name type="PERSON">Mark</name> is eager for his own house.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Yes, we must go, and go now,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'I fear that I must take your gatekeepers from you. But you will manage well enough without them.'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="DATE">May</name>be I shall,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard. 'But I shall miss them. We have become f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends in so short a while that I think I must be getting hasty � growing backwards towards youth, perhaps. But there, they are the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> new thing under <name type="ORG">Sun</name> or <name type="PERSON">Moon</name> that I have seen for many a long, long <name type="DATE">day</name>. I shall not forget them. I have put their names into the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ng List. <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s will remember it.</p>
<p>_<name type="ORG">Ent</name>s the <name type="LOC">earth</name>born, old as mountains,</p>
<p>the wide-walkers, water d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nking;</p>
<p>and hungry as hunters, the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbit children,</p>
<p>the laughing-folk, the little people,_</p>
<p>they shall remain f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends as long as leaves are renewed. <name type="LOC">Far</name>e you well! But if you hear news up in your pleasant land, in the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>, send me word! You know what I mean: word or sight of the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>wives. Come yourselves if you can!'</p>
<p><q>'We will!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> together, and they turned away hastily. <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard looked at them, and was silent for a while, shaking his head thoughtfully. Then he turned to <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>.</p>
<p><q>'So <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> would not leave?'</q> he said. <q>'I did not think he would. His heart is as rot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> as a black <name type="GPE">Huorn</name>'s. Still, if I were overcome and all my trees destroyed, I would not come while I had <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> dark hole left to hide in.'</q></p>
<p><q>'No,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'But you have not plotted to cover all the world with your trees and choke all other living things. But there it is, <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> remains to nurse his hatred and weave again such webs as he can. He has the Key of <name type="PERSON">Orthanc</name>. But he must not be allowed to escape.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Indeed no! <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s will see to that,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> shall not set foot beyond the rock, without my leave. <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s will watch over him.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Good!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'That is what I hoped. Now I can go and turn to other matters with <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> care the less. But you must be wary. The waters have g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> down. It will not be enough to put sentinels round the tower, I fear. I do not doubt that there were deep ways delved under <name type="PERSON">Orthanc</name>, and that <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> hopes to go and come un<name type="PERSON">mar</name>ked, before long. If you will undertake the labour, I beg you to pour in the waters again; and do so, until <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard remains a standing pool, or you discover the outlets. When all the underground places are drowned, and the outlets blocked, then <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> must stay upstairs and look out of the windows.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Leave it to the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard. <q>'We shall search the valley from head to foot and peer under every pebble. <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>s are coming back to live here, old trees, wild trees. The Watchwood we will call it. Not a squirrel will go here, but I shall know of it. Leave it to <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s! Until <name type="CARDINAL">seven</name> times <name type="DATE">the <name type="DATE">year</name></name>s in which he tormented us have passed, we shall not tire of wat<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g him.'</q></p>

<p>The <name type="PERSON">Palant</name>�r</p>
<p>The sun was sinking behind the long western arm of the mountains when <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> and his companions, and the king with his <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s, set out again from <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard. <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> took <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> behind him, and <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> took <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <name type="CARDINAL">Two</name> of the king's men went on ahead, <name type="GPE">ri</name>ding swiftly, and passed soon out of sight down into the valley. The others followed at an easy pace.</p>
<p><name type="ORG">Ent</name>s in a solemn row stood like statues at the gate, with their long arms uplifted, but they made no sound. <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> looked back, when they had passed some way down the winding road. <name type="ORG">Sun</name>light was still shining in the sky, but long shadows reached over <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard: grey ruins falling into darkness. <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>beard stood al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> there now, like the distant stump of an old tree: the hobbits thought of their <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> meeting, upon the sunny ledge far away on the borders of <name type="PERSON">Fangorn</name>.</p>
<p>They came to the pillar of the <name type="ORG">White Hand</name>. The pillar was still standing, but the g<name type="PERSON">raven</name> hand had been thrown down and broken into small pieces. Right in the middle of the road the long forefinger lay, white in the <name type="TIME">dusk</name>, its red nail darkening to black.</p>
<p><q>'The <name type="ORG">Ent</name>s pay at<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>tion to every detail!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>.</p>
<p>They rode on, and <name type="TIME">evening</name> deepened in the valley.</p>
<p><q>'Are we <name type="GPE">ri</name>ding far to<name type="TIME">night</name>, <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>?'</q> asked <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> after a while. <q>'I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t know how you feel with small rag-tag dangling behind you; but the rag-tag is tired and will be glad to stop dangling and lie down.'</q></p>
<p><q>'So you heard that?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Don</name>'t let it rankle! Be thankful no longer words were aimed at you. He had his eyes on you. If it is any comfort to your p<name type="GPE">ri</name>de, I should say that, at the moment, you and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> are more in his thoughts than all the rest of us. Who you are; how you came there, and why; what you know; whether you were captured, and if so, how you escaped when all the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>shed � it is with those little <name type="GPE">ri</name>ddles that the great mind of <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> is troubled. A sneer from him, <name type="PERSON">Me<name type="GPE">ri</name>adoc</name>, is a compliment, if you feel honoured by his concern.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Thank you!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'But it is a greater honour to dangle at your tail, <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. For <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> thing, in that position <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> has a chance of putting a question a <name type="ORG">sec</name>ond time. Are we <name type="GPE">ri</name>ding far to<name type="TIME">night</name>?'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> laughed. 'A most unquenchable hobbit! All <name type="ORG">Wizard</name>s should have a hobbit or <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> in their care � to teach them the meaning of the word, and to correct them. I beg your par<name type="PERSON">don</name>. But I have given thought even to these simple matters. We will <name type="GPE">ri</name>de for <name type="TIME">a few <name type="TIME">hour</name>s</name>, gently, until we come to the end of the valley. <name type="PERSON">Tom</name>orrow we must <name type="GPE">ri</name>de faster.</p>
<p><q>'When we came, we meant to go straight from <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard back to the king's house at <name type="ORG">Edoras</name> over the plains, a <name type="GPE">ri</name>de of some <name type="DATE">day</name>s. But we have taken thought and changed the plan. <name type="PERSON">Messenger</name>s have g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> ahead to <name type="PERSON">Helm</name>'s <name type="PERSON">Deep</name>, to warn them that the king is returning to<name type="DATE">morrow</name>. He will <name type="GPE">ri</name>de from there with many men to <name type="PERSON">Dunharrow</name> by paths among the hills. From now on no <name type="CARDINAL">more than <name type="CARDINAL">two</name></name> or <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> together are to go openly over the land, by <name type="DATE">day</name> or <name type="TIME">night</name>, when it can be avoided.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Nothing or a double helping is your way!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'I am afraid I was not looking beyond to<name type="TIME">night</name>'s bed. Where and what are <name type="PERSON">Helm</name>'s <name type="PERSON">Deep</name> and all the rest of it? I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t know anything about this country.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Then you'd best learn something, if you wish to understand what is happening. But not just now, and not from me: I have too many pressing things to think about.'</q></p>
<p><q>'All <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght, I'll tackle <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> by the camp-fire: he's less testy. But why all this <name type="ORG">sec</name>recy? I thought we'd won the battle!'</q></p>
<p>Yes, we have won, but only the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> victor and that in itself increases our danger. There was some link between <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard and <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>, which I have not yet fathomed. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w they exchanged news I am not sure; but they did so. The <name type="PRODUCT">Eye</name> of <name type="FAC">Barad-d</name>�r will be looking impatiently towards the <name type="ORG">Wizard</name>'s Vale, I think; and towards <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>. The less it sees the better.'</p>
<p>The road passed slowly, winding down the valley. Now further, and now nearer <name type="PERSON">Isen</name> flowed in its stony bed. Night came down from the mountains. All the mists were g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. A chill wind blew. The moon, now waxing round, filled the eastern sky with a pale cold sheen. The shoulders of the mountain to their <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght sloped down to bare hills. The wide plains opened grey before them.</p>
<p>At last they halted. Then they turned aside, leaving the highway and taking to the sweet upland turf again. Going westward <name type="QUANTITY">a mile</name> or so they came to a <name type="GPE">dale</name>. It opened southward, leaning back into the slope of round <name type="PERSON">Dol Baran</name>, the last hill of the northern ranges, greenfooted, crowned with heather. The sides of the <name type="LOC">glen</name> were shaggy with <name type="DATE">last <name type="DATE">year</name></name>'s <name type="PERSON">bracken</name>, among which the tight-curled fronds of sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng were just thrusting through the sweet-scented <name type="LOC">earth</name>. <name type="ORG">Thorn<name type="PERSON">bush</name>es</name> grew thick upon the low banks, and under them they made their camp, <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> <name type="TIME">hour</name>s or so before the middle of the <name type="TIME">night</name>. They lit a fire in a hollow, down among the roots of a spreading hawthorn, tall as a tree, w<name type="GPE">ri</name>then with age; but hale in every limb. Buds were swelling at each twig's tip.</p>
<p><name type="ORG">Guard</name>s were set, <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> at a watch. The rest, after they had supped, wrapped themselves in a cloak and blanket and slept. The hobbits lay in a corner by themselves upon a pile of old <name type="PERSON">bracken</name>. <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> was sleepy, but <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> now seemed cu<name type="GPE">ri</name>ously restless. The <name type="PERSON">bracken</name> cracked and rustled, as he twisted and turned.</p>
<p><q>'What's the matter?'</q> asked <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'Are you lying on an ant-hill?'</q></p>
<p><q>'No,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>, <q>'but I'm not comfortable. I wonder how long it is since I slept in a bed?'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Merry</name> yawned. <q>'Work it out on your fingers!'</q> he said. <q>'But you must know how long it is since we left L�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Oh, that!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q>'I mean a real bed in a bedroom.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Well, <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name> then,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'But I could sleep anywhere to<name type="TIME">night</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q>'You had the luck, <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> softly, after a long pause. <q>'You were <name type="GPE">ri</name>ding with <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Well, what of it?'</q></p>
<p><q>'Did you get any news, any information out of him?'</q></p>
<p><q>'Yes, a good deal. More than usual. But you heard it all or most of it: you were close by, and we were talking no <name type="ORG">sec</name>rets. But you can go with him to<name type="DATE">morrow</name>, if you think you can get more out of him-and if he'll have you.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Can I? Good! But he's close, isn't he? Not changed at all.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Oh yes, he is!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>, waking up a little, and beginning to wonder what was bothe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng his companion. <q>'He has grown, or something. He can be both kinder and more alarming, mer<name type="GPE">ri</name>er and more solemn than before, I think. He has changed; but we have not had a chance to see how much, yet. But think of the last part of that business with <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>! Remember <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> was once <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>'s supe<name type="GPE">ri</name>or: head of the <name type="ORG">Council</name>, whatever that may be exactly. He was <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> the White. <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> is the White now. <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> came when he was told, and his rod was taken; and then he was just told to go, and he went!'</q></p>
<p><q>'Well, if <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> has changed at all, then he's closer than ever that's all,'</q> <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> argued. <q>'That-glass ball, now. He seemed mighty pleased with it. He knows or guesses something about it. But does he tell us what? No, not a word. Yet I picked it up, and I saved it from rolling into a pool. _Here, I'll take that, my lad_ � that's all. I wonder what it is? It felt so very heavy.'</q> <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>'s voice fell very low as if he was talking to himself.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="ORG">Hullo</name>!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'So that's what is bothe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng you? Now, <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> my lad, <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t forget <name type="PERSON">Gildor</name>'s saying � the <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> used to quote:_ Do not meddle in the at <name type="ORG">Fair</name>s of <name type="ORG">Wizard</name>s, for they are subtle and quick to anger_.'</q></p>
<p><q>'But our whole life for <name type="DATE">months</name> has been <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> long meddling in the affairs of <name type="ORG">Wizard</name>s,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q>'I should like a bit of information as well as danger. I should like a look at that ball.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Go to sleep!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'You'll get information enough, so<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>r or later. My dear <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>, no <name type="PERSON">Took</name> ever beat a <name type="ORG">Brand</name>ybuck for inquisitiveness; but is this the time, I ask you?'</q></p>
<p><q>'All <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght! What's the harm in my telling you what I should like: a look at that st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>? I know I can't have it, with old <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> sitting on it, like a hen on an egg. But it doesn't help much to get no more from you than a _you-can't-have-it so-go-to-sleep_!'</q></p>
<p><q>'Well, what else could I say?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'I'm sorry, <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>, but you really must wait till the <name type="TIME">morning</name>. I'll be as cu<name type="GPE">ri</name>ous as you like after breakfast, and I'll help in any way I can at wizard-wheedling. But I can't keep awake any longer. If I yawn any more, I shall split at the ears. <name type="TIME">Good <name type="TIME">night</name></name>!'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> said no more. He lay still now, but sleep remained far away; and it was not encouraged by the sound of <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> breathing softly, asleep in <name type="TIME">a few <name type="TIME">minutes</name></name> after saying good <name type="TIME">night</name>. 'The thought of the dark globe seemed to grow stronger as all grew quiet. <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> felt again its w<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name> in his hands, and saw again the myste<name type="GPE">ri</name>ous red depths into which he had looked for a moment. He tossed and turned and t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed to think of something else.</p>
<p>At last he could stand it no longer. He got up and looked round. It was chilly, and he wrapped his cloak about him. The moon was shining cold and white, down into the <name type="ORG">dell</name>, and the shadows of the <name type="PERSON">bush</name>es were black. All about lay sleeping shapes. The <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> guards were not in view: they were up on the hill, perhaps, or hidden in the <name type="PERSON">bracken</name>. D<name type="GPE">ri</name>ven by some impulse that he did not understand, <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> walked softly to where <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> lay. He looked down at him. The wizard seemed asleep, but with lids not fully closed: there was a glitter of eyes under his long lashes. <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> stepped back hastily. But <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> made no sign; and drawn forward once more, <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> against his will, the hobbit crept up again from behind the wizard's head. He was rolled in a blanket, with his cloak spread over the top; and close beside him, between his <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght side and his bent arm, there was a hummock, something round wrapped in a dark cloth; his hand seemed only just to have slipped off it to the ground.</p>
<p>Hardly breathing, <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> crept nearer, foot by foot. At last he knelt down. Then he put his hands out stealthily, and slowly lifted the lump up: it did not seem quite so heavy as he had expected. <q>'Only some bundle of oddments, perhaps, after all,'</q> he thought with a strange sense of relief; but he did not put the bundle down again. He stood for a moment clasping it. Then an idea came into his mind. He tiptoed away, found a large st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, and came back.</p>
<p>Quickly now he drew off the cloth, wrapped the st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> in it and kneeling down, laid it back by the wizard's hand. Then at last he looked at the thing that he had uncovered. There it was: a smooth globe of crystal, now dark and dead, lying bare before his knees. <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> lifted it, covered it hur<name type="GPE">ri</name>edly in his own cloak, and <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> turned to go back to his bed. At that moment <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> moved in his sleep, and muttered some words: they seemed to be in a strange tongue; his hand groped out and clasped the wrapped st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, then he sighed and did not move again.</p>
<p><q>'You idiotic fool!'</q> <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> muttered to himself. <q>'You're going to get yourself into f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ghtful trouble. Put it back quick!'</q> But he found now that his knees quaked, and he did not dare to go near enough to the wizard to reach the bundle. <q>'I'll never get it back now without waking him,'</q> he thought, <q>'not till I'm a bit calmer. So I may as well have a look <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>. Not just here though!'</q> He stole away, and sat down on a green hillock not far from his bed. The moon looked in over the edge of the <name type="ORG">dell</name>.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> sat with his knees drawn up and the ball between them. He bent low over it, looking like a greedy child stooping over a bowl of food, in a corner away from others. He drew his cloak aside and gazed at it. The air seemed still and <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>se about him. At <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> the globe was dark, black as jet, with the moonlight gleaming on its surface. Then there came a faint glow and stir in the heart of it, and it held his eyes, so that now he could not look away. Soon all the inside seemed on fire; the ball was spinning, or the lights within were revolving. Suddenly the lights went out. He gave a gasp and struggled; but he remained bent, clasping the ball with both hands. Closer and closer he bent, and then became <name type="GPE">ri</name>gid; his lips moved soundlessly for a while. Then with a strangled cry he fell back and lay still.</p>
<p>The cry was piercing. The guards leapt down from the banks. All the camp was soon <name type="GPE">astir</name>.</p>
<p><q>'So this is the thief!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <name type="PERSON">Hastily</name> he cast his cloak over the globe where it lay. <q>'But you, <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>! This is a g<name type="GPE">ri</name>evous turn to things!'</q> He knelt by <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>'s body: the hobbit was lying on his back <name type="GPE">ri</name>gid, with unseeing eyes sta<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng up at the sky. <q>'The devilry! What mischief has he <name type="PERSON">don</name>e-to himself, and to all of us?'</q> The wizard's face was drawn and haggard.</p>
<p>He took <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>'s hand and bent over his face, lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing for his breath; then he laid his hands on his brow. The hobbit shuddered. His eyes closed. He c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed out; and sat up. sta<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng in bewilderment at all the faces round him, pale in the moonlight.</p>
<p><q>'It is not for you, <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>!'</q> he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed in a sh<name type="GPE">ri</name>ll and t<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>less voice sh<name type="GPE">ri</name>nking away from <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'I will send for it at once. Do you understand? Say just that!'</q> Then he struggled to get up and escape but <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> held him gently and firmly.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Pereg<name type="GPE">ri</name>n</name> <name type="PERSON">Took</name>!'</q> he said. <q>'Come back!'</q></p>
<p>The hobbit relaxed and fell back, clinging to the wizard's hand. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>!'</q> he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>! Forgive me!'</q></p>
<p><q>'Forgive you?'</q> said the wizard. <q>'Tell me <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> what you have <name type="PERSON">don</name>e!'</q></p>
<p><q>'I, I took the ball and looked at it,'</q> stammered <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>; <q>'and I saw things that f<name type="GPE">ri</name>gh<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed me. And I <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ted to go away, but I couldn't. And then he came and questi<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>d me; and he looked at me, and, and that is all I remember.'</q></p>
<p><q>'That won't do,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> sternly. <q>'What did you see, and what did you say?'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> shut his eyes and shivered, but said nothing. They all stared at him in silence, except <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> who turned away. But <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>'s face was still hard. <q>'Speak!'</q> he said.</p>
<p>In a low hesitating voice <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> began again, and slowly his words grew clearer and stronger. <q>'I saw a dark sky, and tall battlements,'</q> he said. 'And tiny stars. It seemed very far away and <name type="DATE">long ago</name>, yet hard and clear. Then the stars went in and out-they were cut off by things with wings. Very big, I think, really; but in the glass they looked like bats wheeling round the tower. I thought there were <name type="CARDINAL">nine</name> of them. <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> began to fly straight towards me, getting bigger and bigger. It had a hor<name type="GPE">ri</name>ble � no, no! I can't say.</p>
<p>'I t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed to get away, because I thought it would fly out; but when it had covered all the globe, it disappeared. Then _he_ came. He did not speak so that I could hear words. He just looked, and I understood.</p>
<p>'"So you have come back? Why have you neglected to report for so long?"</p>
<p>'I did not answer. He said: "Who are you?" I still did not answer, but it hurt me hor<name type="GPE">ri</name>bly; and he pressed me, so I said: "A hobbit."</p>
<p>'Then suddenly he seemed to see me, and he laughed at me. It was cruel. It was like being stabbed with knives. I struggled. But he said: "Wait a moment! We shall meet again soon. Tell <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> that this dainty is not for him. I will send for it at once. Do you understand? Say just that!"</p>
<p><q>'Then he gloated over me. I felt I was falling to pieces. No, no! I can't say any more. I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t remember anything else.'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok at me!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> looked up straight into his eyes. The wizard held his gaze for a moment in silence. Then his face grew gentler, and the shadow of a smile appeared. He laid his hand softly on <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>'s head.</p>
<p><q>'All <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght!'</q> he said. <q>'Say no more! You have taken no harm. There is no lie in your eyes, as I feared. But he did not speak long with you. A fool, but an h<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>st fool, you remain, <name type="PERSON">Pereg<name type="GPE">ri</name>n</name> <name type="PERSON">Took</name>. <name type="PERSON">Wise</name>r <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s might have <name type="PERSON">don</name>e worse in such a pass. But <name type="PERSON">mar</name>k this! You have been saved, and all your f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends too, mainly by good fortune, as it is called. You cannot count on it a <name type="ORG">sec</name>ond time. If he had questi<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>d you, then and there, almost certainly you would have told all that you know, to the ruin of us all. But he was too eager. He did not <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t information only: he <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ted you, quickly, so that he could deal with you in the Dark <name type="FAC">Tower</name>, slowly. <name type="PERSON">Don</name>'t shudder! If you will meddle in the affairs of <name type="ORG">Wizard</name>s, you must be prepared to think of such things. But come! I forgive you. Be comforted! Things have not turned out as evilly as they might.'</q></p>
<p>He lifted <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> gently and car<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed him back to his bed. <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> followed, and sat down beside him. Lie there and rest, if you can, <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>!<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. 'Trust me. If you feel an itch in your palms again, tell me of it! Such things can be cured. But anyway, my dear hobbit, <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t put a lump of rock under my elbow again! Now, I will leave you <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> together for a while.'</q></p>
<p>With that <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> returned to the others, who were still standing by the <name type="PERSON">Orthanc</name>-st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> in troubled thought. <q>'Pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>l comes in the <name type="TIME">night</name> when least expected,'</q> he said. <q>'We have had a narrow escape!'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w is the hobbit, <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>?'</q> asked <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>.</p>
<p><q>'I think all will be well now,'</q> answered <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'He was not held long, and hobbits have an amazing power of recovery. The memory, or the horror of it, will probably fade quickly. Too quickly, perhaps. Will you, <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>, take the <name type="PERSON">Orthanc</name>-st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> and guard it? It is a dangerous charge.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Dangerous indeed, but not to all,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'There is <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> who may claim it by <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght. For this assuredly is the _palant�r_ of <name type="PERSON">Orthanc</name> from the treasury of <name type="PERSON">Elen</name>dil, set here by the <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>gs of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>. Now my <name type="TIME">hour</name> draws near. I will take it.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> looked at <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>, and then, to the surp<name type="GPE">ri</name>se of the others, he lifted the covered <name type="ORG">St<name type="CARDINAL">one</name></name>, and bowed as he presented it.</p>
<p><q>'Receive it, lord!'</q> he said: <q>'in earnest of other things that shall be given back. But if I may counsel you in the use of your own, do not use it � yet! Be wary!'</q></p>
<p><q>'When have I been hasty or unwary, who have waited and prepared for so many <name type="DATE">long <name type="DATE">year</name>s</name>?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>.</p>
<p><q>'Never yet. Do not then stumble at the end of the road,'</q> answered <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'But at the least keep this thing <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret. You, and all others that stand here! The hobbit, <name type="PERSON">Pereg<name type="GPE">ri</name>n</name>, above all should not know where it is bestowed. The evil fit may come on him again. For alas! he has handled it and looked in it, as should never have happened. He ought never to have touched it in <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard, and there I should have been quicker. But my mind was bent on <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>, and I did not at once guess the nature of the <name type="ORG">St<name type="CARDINAL">one</name></name>. Then I was weary, and as I lay ponde<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng it, sleep overcame me. Now I know!'</q></p>
<p><q>'Yes, there can be no doubt,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'At last we know the link' between <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard and <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>, and how it worked. Much is explained.'</q> <q>'Strange powers have our enemies, and strange weaknesses!'</q> said Th�oden. <q>'But it has long been said: _oft evil will shall evil <name type="PERSON">mar</name>_.'</q></p>
<p><q>'That many times is seen,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'But at this time we have been strangely fortunate. <name type="DATE">May</name>be, I have been saved by this hobbit from a grave blunder. I had considered whether or not to probe this <name type="ORG">St<name type="CARDINAL">one</name></name> myself to find its uses. Had I <name type="PERSON">don</name>e so, I should have been revealed to him myself. I am not ready for such a t<name type="GPE">ri</name>al, if indeed I shall ever be so: But even if I found the power to withdraw myself, it would be disastrous for him to see me, yet � until the <name type="TIME">hour</name> comes when <name type="ORG">sec</name>recy will avail no longer.'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="TIME">That <name type="TIME">hour</name></name> is now come, I think,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>.</p>
<p><q>'Not yet,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'There remains a short while of doubt which we must use. The Enemy, it is clear, thought that the <name type="ORG">St<name type="CARDINAL">one</name></name> was in <name type="PERSON">Orthanc</name> � why should he not? And that therefore the hobbit was captive there, d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ven to look in the glass for his torment by <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>. That dark mind will be filled now with the voice and face of the hobbit and with expectation: it may take some time before he learns his error. We must snatch that time. We have been too leisurely. We must move. The neighbourhood of <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard is no place now to linger in. I will <name type="GPE">ri</name>de ahead at once with <name type="PERSON">Pereg<name type="GPE">ri</name>n</name> <name type="PERSON">Took</name>. It will be better for him than lying in the dark while others sleep.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I will keep �omer and <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s,'</q> said the king. <q>'They shall <name type="GPE">ri</name>de with me at early <name type="DATE">day</name>. The rest may go with <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> and <name type="GPE">ri</name>de as soon as they have a mind.'</q></p>
<p><q>'As you will,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'But make all the speed you may to the cover of the hills, to <name type="PERSON">Helm</name>'s <name type="PERSON">Deep</name>!'</q></p>
<p>At that moment a shadow fell over them. The b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght moonlight seemed to be suddenly cut off. Several of the <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed out, and crouched, holding their arms above their heads, as if to ward off a blow from above: a blind fear and a deadly cold fell on them. Cowe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng they looked up. A vast winged shape passed over the moon like a black cloud. It wheeled and went north, flying at a speed greater than any wind of <name type="LOC">Middle-<name type="LOC">earth</name></name>. The stars fainted before it. It was g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>.</p>
<p>They stood up, <name type="GPE">ri</name>gid as st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s. <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> was gazing up, his arms out and downwards, stiff, his hands clenched.</p>
<p><q>'Nazg�l!'</q> he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed. <q>'The messenger of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>. The storm is coming. The Nazg�l have crossed the <name type="LOC">River</name>! Ride, <name type="GPE">ri</name>de! Wait not for the <name type="TIME">dawn</name>! Let not the swift wait for the slow! Ride!'</q></p>
<p>He sprang away, calling <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>fax as he ran. <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> followed him. Going to <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>, <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> picked him up in his arms. <q>'You shall come with me this time,'</q> he said. <q>'<name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>fax shall show you his paces.'</q> Then he ran to the place where he had slept. <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>fax stood there already. Slinging the small bag which was all his luggage across his shoulders, the wizard leapt upon the horse's back. <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> lifted <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> and set him in <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>'s arms, ,wrapped in cloak and blanket.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="LOC">Far</name>ewell! Follow fast!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'Away, <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>fax!'</q></p>
<p>The great horse tossed his head. His flowing tail flicked in the moonlight. Then he leapt forward, spurning the <name type="LOC">earth</name>, and was g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> like the north wind from the mountains.</p>
<p><q>'A beautiful, restful <name type="TIME">night</name>!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> to <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'Some folk have wonderful luck. He did not <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t to sleep, and he <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ted to <name type="GPE">ri</name>de with <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> � and there he goes! Instead of being turned into a st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> himself to stand here for ever as a warning.'</q></p>
<p><q>'If you had been the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> to lift the <name type="PERSON">Orthanc</name>-st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, and not he, how would it be now?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'You might have <name type="PERSON">don</name>e worse. Who can say? But now it is your luck to come with me, I fear. At once. Go and get ready, and b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng anything that <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> left behind. Make haste!'</q></p>
<p>Over the plains <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>fax was flying, needing no urging and no guidance. <name type="TIME">Less than <name type="TIME">an <name type="TIME">hour</name></name></name> had passed, and they had reached the <name type="ORG">Ford</name>s of <name type="PERSON">Isen</name> and crossed them. The Mound of the <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s and its cold spears lay grey behind them.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> was recove<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng. He was warm, but the wind in his face was keen and refreshing. He was with <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. The horror of the st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> and of the hideous shadow over the moon was fading, things left behind in the mists of the mountains or in a passing dream. He drew a deep breath.</p>
<p><q>'I did not know you rode bare-back, <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>,'</q> he said. <q>'You haven't a saddle or a b<name type="GPE">ri</name>dle!'</q></p>
<p><q>'I do not <name type="GPE">ri</name>de elf-fashion, except on <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>fax,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'But <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>fax will have no harness. You do not <name type="GPE">ri</name>de <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>fax: he is willing to carry you-or not. If he is willing, that is enough. It is then his business to see that you remain on his back, unless you jump off into the air.'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w fast is he going?'</q> asked <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q>'Fast by the wind, but very smooth. And how light his footfalls are!'</q></p>
<p><q>'He is running now as fast as the swiftest horse could gallop,'</q> answered <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>; <q>'but that is not fast for him. The land is <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing a little here, and is more broken than it was beyond the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver. But see how the White <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s are drawing near under the stars! Yonder are the <name type="PERSON">Thr</name>ihyrne peaks like black spears. It will not be long before we reach the bran<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g roads and come to the <name type="PERSON">Deep</name>ing-coomb, where the battle was fought <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> <name type="TIME">night</name>s ago.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> was silent again for a while. He heard <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> singing softly to himself, murmu<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ef snatches of rhyme in many tongues, as the miles ran under them. At last the wizard passed into a song of which the hobbit caught the words: a few lines came clear to his ears through the rushing of the wind:</p>
<p>_Tall ships and tall kings</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Thr</name>ee times <name type="CARDINAL">three</name>,</p>
<p>What brought they from the foundered land</p>
<p>Over the flowing sea?</p>
<p><name type="CARDINAL">Seven</name> stars and <name type="CARDINAL">seven</name> st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s</p>
<p>And <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> white tree.</p>
<p><q>'What are you saying, <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>?'</q> asked <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>.</p>
<p><q>'I was just running over some of the Rhymes of <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>re in my mind ' answered the wizard. '<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbits, I suppose, have forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> them, even those that they ever knew.'</q></p>
<p><q>'No, not all,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q>'And we have many of our own, which wouldn't interest you, perhaps. But I have never heard this <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. What is it about � the <name type="CARDINAL">seven</name> stars and <name type="CARDINAL">seven</name> st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s?'</q></p>
<p><q>'About the _palant�<name type="GPE">ri</name>_ of the <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>gs of Old,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>.</p>
<p><q>'And what are they?'</q></p>
<p><q>'The name meant _that which looks far away_. The <name type="PERSON">Orthanc</name>-st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> was <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Then it was not made, not made' � <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> hesitated � 'by the Enemy?'</q></p>
<p><q>'No,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'Nor by <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>. It is beyond his art, and beyond <name type="ORG">Sauron</name>'s too. The _palant�<name type="GPE">ri</name>_ came from beyond <name type="LOC">West</name>ernesse from <name type="PERSON">Elda<name type="PERSON">mar</name></name>. The <name type="PERSON">Noldor</name> made them. F�anor himself, maybe, wrought them, in <name type="DATE">day</name>s so <name type="DATE">long ago</name> that the time cannot be measured in <name type="DATE">year</name>s. But there is nothing that <name type="ORG">Sauron</name> cannot turn to evil uses. <name type="PERSON">Alas</name> for <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>! It was his downfall, as I now perceive. Pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>lous to us all are the devices of an art deeper than we possess ourselves. Yet he must bear the blame. Fool! to keep it <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret, for his own profit. No word did he ever speak of it to any of the <name type="ORG">Council</name>. We had not yet given thought to the fate of the _palant�<name type="GPE">ri</name>_ of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> in its ruinous wars. By <name type="ORG">Men</name> they were almost forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>. Even in <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> they were a <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret known only to a few; in <name type="PERSON">Arnor</name> they were remembered only in a rhyme of lore among the D�nedain.'</q></p>
<p><q>'What did the <name type="ORG">Men</name> of old use them for?'</q> asked <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>, delighted and astonished at getting answers to so many questions, and wonde<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng how long it would last.</p>
<p><q>'To see far off, and to converse in thought with <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> another,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. 'In that way they long guarded and united the realm of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>. They set up <name type="ORG">St<name type="CARDINAL">one</name></name>s at Minas <name type="GPE">Anor</name>, and at Minas <name type="ORG">Ithil</name>, and at <name type="PERSON">Orthanc</name> in the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng of <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard. The chief and master of these was under the Dome of <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Stars</name> at <name type="NORP">Osgiliath</name> before its ruin. The <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> others were far away in the <name type="LOC">North</name>. In the house of <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name> it is told that they were at <name type="PERSON">Ann�minas</name>, and Amon S�l, and <name type="PERSON">Elen</name>dil's <name type="ORG">St<name type="CARDINAL">one</name></name> was on the <name type="FAC">Tower</name> <name type="ORG">Hill</name>s that look towards Mithlond in the Gulf of <name type="ORG">Lune</name> where the grey ships lie.</p>
<p>'Each _palant�r_ replied to each, but all those in <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> were ever open to the view of <name type="NORP">Osgiliath</name>. Now it appears that, as the rock of <name type="PERSON">Orthanc</name> has withstood the storms of time, so there the _palant�r_ of that tower has remained. But al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> it could do nothing but see small images of things far off and <name type="DATE">day</name>s remote. Very useful, no doubt, that was to <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>; yet it seems that he was not con<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>t. Further and further abroad he gazed, until he cast his gaze upon <name type="FAC">Barad-d</name>�r. Then he was caught!</p>
<p>'Who knows where the lost <name type="ORG">St<name type="CARDINAL">one</name></name>s of <name type="PERSON">Arnor</name> and <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> now lie bu<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed, or drowned deep? But <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. at least <name type="ORG">Sauron</name> must have obtained and mastered to his purposes. I guess that it was the <name type="ORG">Ithil</name>-st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, for he took Minas <name type="ORG">Ithil</name> <name type="DATE">long ago</name> and turned it into an evil place: Minas <name type="PERSON">Morgul</name>, it has become.</p>
<p><q>'Easy it is now to guess how quickly the roving eye of <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> was trapped and held; and how ever since he has been persuaded from afar, and daunted when persuasion would not serve. The biter bit, the hawk under the eagle's foot, the spider in a steel web! <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w long, I wonder, has he been constrained to come of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> to his glass for inspection and instruction, and the <name type="PERSON">Orthanc</name>-st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> so bent towards <name type="FAC">Barad-d</name>�r that, if any save a will of adamant now looks into it, it will bear his mind and sight swiftly thither? And how it draws <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> to itself! Have I not felt it? Even now my heart desires to test my will upon it, to see if I could not wrench it from him and turn it where I would-to look across the wide seas of water and of time to Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>on the <name type="ORG">Fair</name>, and perceive the unimaginable hand and mind of F�anor at their work, while both the White <name type="PERSON">Tree</name> and the Golden were in flower!'</q> He sighed and fell silent.</p>
<p><q>'I wish I had known all this before,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q>'I had no notion of what I was doing.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Oh yes, you had,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'You knew you were behaving wrongly and foolishly; and you told yourself so, though you did not lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>. I did not tell you all this before, because it is only by musing on all that has happened that I have at last understood, even as we <name type="GPE">ri</name>de together. But if I had spoken so<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>r, it would not have lessened your desire, or made it easier to resist. On the contrary! No, the burned hand teaches best. After that advice about fire goes to the heart.'</q></p>
<p><q>'It does,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q>'If all the <name type="CARDINAL">seven</name> st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s were laid out before me now, I should shut my eyes and put my hands in my pockets.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Good!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'That is what I hoped.'</q></p>
<p><q>'But I should like to know-'</q> <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> began.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="ORG">Mercy</name>!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'If the giving of information is to be the cure of your inquisitiveness, I shall spend all the rest of my <name type="DATE">day</name>s in answe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng you. What more do you <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t to know?'</q></p>
<p><q>'The names of all the stars, and of all living things, and the whole history of <name type="LOC">Middle-<name type="LOC">earth</name></name> and Over<name type="PERSON">-he</name>aven and of the <name type="ORG">Sun</name>de<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng <name type="LOC">Sea</name>s ' laughed <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. 'Of course! What less? But I am not in a hurry to<name type="TIME">night</name>. At the moment I was just wonde<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng about the black shadow. I heard you shout "messenger of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>". What was it? What could it do at <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard?'</q></p>
<p><q>'It was a <name type="ORG">Black</name> <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name> on wings, a Nazg�l,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'It could have taken you away to the Dark <name type="FAC">Tower</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q>'But it was not coming for me, was it?'</q> faltered <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. 'I mean, it didn't know that I had... '</p>
<p><q>'Of course not,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. 'It is <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name> leagues or more in straight flight from <name type="FAC">Barad-d</name>�r to <name type="PERSON">Orthanc</name>, and even a Nazg�l would take <name type="TIME">a few <name type="TIME">hour</name>s</name> to fly between them. But <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> certainly looked in the <name type="ORG">St<name type="CARDINAL">one</name></name> since the orc-raid, and more of his <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret thought, I do not doubt, has been read than he in<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ded. A messenger has been sent to find out what he is doing. And after what has happened to<name type="TIME">night</name> another will come, I think, and swiftly. So <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> will come to the last pinch of the vice that he has put his hand in. He has no captive to send. He has no <name type="ORG">St<name type="CARDINAL">one</name></name> to see with, and cannot answer the summons. <name type="ORG">Sauron</name> will only believe that he is withholding the captive and refusing to use the <name type="ORG">St<name type="CARDINAL">one</name></name>. It will not help <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> to tell the truth to the messenger. For <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard may be ruined, yet he is still safe in <name type="PERSON">Orthanc</name>. So whether he will or no, he will appear a rebel. Yet he rejected us, so as to avoid that very thing! What he will do in such a plight, I cannot guess. He has power still, I think, while in <name type="PERSON">Orthanc</name>, to resist the <name type="CARDINAL">Nine</name> <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s. He may try to do so. He may try to trap the Nazg�l, or at least to slay the thing on which it now <name type="GPE">ri</name>des the air. In that case let <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> look to its horses!</p>
<p><q>'But I cannot tell how it will fall out, well or ill for us. It may be that the counsels of the Enemy will be confused, or hindered by his wrath with <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>. It may be that he will learn that I was there and stood upon the stairs of <name type="PERSON">Orthanc</name>-with hobbits at my tail. Or that an heir of <name type="PERSON">Elen</name>dil lives and stood beside me. If <name type="ORG">Worm</name>tongue was not deceived by the armour of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>, he would remember <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> and the title that he claimed. That is what I fear. And so we fly � not from danger but into greater danger. Every st<name type="GPE">ri</name>de of <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>fax bears you nearer to the Land of <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>, <name type="PERSON">Pereg<name type="GPE">ri</name>n</name> <name type="PERSON">Took</name>.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> made no answer, but clutched his cloak, as if a sudden chill had struck him. <name type="ORG">Grey</name> land passed under them.</p>
<p><q>'See now!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'The <name type="LOC">West</name>fold <name type="GPE">dale</name>s are opening before us. Here we come back to the eastward road. The dark shadow yonder is the mouth of the <name type="PERSON">Deep</name>ing-coomb. That way lies <name type="GPE">Aglar</name>ond and the Glitte<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng Caves. Do not ask me about them. Ask <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>, if you meet again, and for the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> time you may get an answer longer than you wish. You will not see the caves yourself, not on this journey. Soon they will be far behind.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I thought you were going to stop at <name type="PERSON">Helm</name>'s <name type="PERSON">Deep</name>!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q>'Where are you going then?'</q></p>
<p><q>'To Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name>, before the seas of war surround it.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Oh! And how far is that?'</q></p>
<p><q>'Leagues upon leagues,'</q> answered <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. '<name type="PERSON">Thr</name>ice as far as the dwellings of <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g Th�oden, and they are more than <name type="CARDINAL">a <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name></name> miles east from here, as the messengers of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> fly. <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>fax must run a longer road. Which will prove the swifter?</p>
<p>'We shall <name type="GPE">ri</name>de now till <name type="DATE">day</name>break, and that is some <name type="TIME">hour</name>s away. Then even <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>fax must rest, in some hollow of the hills: at <name type="ORG">Edoras</name>, I hope. Sleep, if you can! You may see the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> glimmer of <name type="TIME">dawn</name> upon the golden roof of the house of <name type="PERSON">Eorl</name>. And in <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> <name type="DATE">day</name>s thence you shall see the purple shadow of Mount <name type="GPE">Min<name type="PERSON">dol</name>luin</name> and the walls of the tower of <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name> white in the <name type="TIME">morning</name>.</p>
<p><q>'Away now, <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>fax! Run, <name type="ORG">greatheart</name>, run as you have never run before! Now we are come to the lands where you were foaled and every st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> you know. Run now! <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>pe is in speed!'</q></p>
<p><name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>fax tossed his head and c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed aloud, as if a trumpet had summ<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>d him to battle. Then he sprang forward. <name type="ORG">Fire</name> flew from his feet; <name type="TIME">night</name> rushed over him.</p>
<p>As he fell slowly into sleep, <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> had a strange feeling: he and <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> were still as st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, seated upon the statue of a running horse, while the world rolled away beneath his feet with a great noise of wind.</p>

<p><name type="ORG">The Taming of Sm</name>�agol</p>
<p><q>'Well, master, we're in a fix and no mistake,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> <name type="PERSON">Gamgee</name>. He stood despondently with hunched shoulders beside <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, and peered out with puckered eyes into the gloom.</p>
<p>It was the <name type="ORDINAL">third</name> <name type="TIME">evening</name> since they had fled from the <name type="ORG">Company</name>, as far as they could tell: they had almost lost count of the <name type="TIME">hour</name>s du<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng which they had climbed and laboured among the barren slopes and st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s of the <name type="ORG">Emyn Muil</name>, sometimes retracing their steps because they could find no way forward, sometimes discove<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng that they had <name type="PERSON">wan</name>dered in a circle back to where they had been <name type="TIME">hour</name>s before. Yet on the whole they had worked steadily eastward, keeping as near as they could find a way to the outer edge of this strange twisted knot of hills. But always they found its outward faces sheer, high and impassable, frowning over the plain below; beyond its tumbled skirts lay livid feste<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng <name type="PERSON">mar</name>shes where nothing moved and not even a bird was to be seen.</p>
<p>The hobbits stood now on the b<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk of a tall cliff, bare and bleak, its feet wrapped in mist; and behind them rose the broken highlands crowned with d<name type="GPE">ri</name>fting cloud. A chill wind` blew from the <name type="LOC">East</name>. Night was gathe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng over the shapeless lands before them; the sickly green of them was fading to a sullen brown. <name type="LOC">Far</name> away to the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght the <name type="GPE">Anduin</name>, that had gleamed fitfully in sun-breaks du<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng the <name type="DATE">day</name>, was now hidden in shadow. But their eyes did not look beyond the <name type="LOC">River</name>, back to <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>, to their f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends, to the lands of <name type="ORG">Men</name>. <name type="LOC">South</name> and east they stared to where, at the edge of the on<name type="TIME">coming <name type="TIME">night</name></name>, a dark line hung, like distant mountains of motionless smoke. Every now and again a tiny red gleam far away flickered upwards on the <name type="GPE">ri</name>m of <name type="LOC">earth</name> and sky.</p>
<p>`What a fix! <q>' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. `That's the <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> place in all the lands we've ever heard of that we <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t to see any closer; and that's the <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> place we're trying to get to! And that's just where we can't get, <name type="PERSON">nohow</name>. We've come the wrong way altogether, seemingly. We can't get down; and if we did get down, we'd find all that green land a nasty bog, I'll warrant. Phew! Can you smell it?'</q> He snif<name type="ORG">fed</name> at the wind.</p>
<p><q>'Yes, I can smell it,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, but he did not move, and his eyes remained fixed, sta<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng out towards the dark line and the flicke<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng flame. `<name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>! <q>' he muttered under his breath. 'If I must go there I wish I could come there quickly and make an end! ' He shuddered. The wind was chilly and yet heavy with an odour of cold decay. <name type="ORG">`Well</name>,'</q> he said, at last withdrawing his eyes, `we cannot stay here <name type="TIME">all <name type="TIME">night</name></name>, fix or no fix. We must find a more sheltered spot, and camp once more; and perhaps <name type="DATE">another <name type="DATE">day</name></name> will show us a path.'</p>
<p><q>'Or another and another and another,'</q> muttered <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. `Or maybe no <name type="DATE">day</name>. We've come the wrong way.'</p>
<p><q>'I wonder,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'It's my doom, I think, to go to that <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name> yonder, so that a way will be found. But will good or evil show it to me? What hope we had was in speed. Delay plays into the Enemy's hands-and here I am: delayed. Is it the will of the Dark <name type="FAC">Tower</name> that steers us? All my choices have proved ill. I should have left the <name type="ORG">Company</name> long before, and come down from the <name type="LOC">North</name>, east of the <name type="LOC">River</name> and of the <name type="ORG">Emyn Muil</name>, and so over the hard of <name type="EVENT">Battle</name> <name type="LOC">Plain</name> to the passes of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>. But now it isn't possible for you and me al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> to find a way back, and the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s are prowling on <name type="GPE">the east bank</name>. <name type="DATE">Every <name type="DATE">day</name></name> that passes is <name type="DATE">a precious <name type="DATE">day</name></name> lost. I am tired, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t know what is to be <name type="PERSON">don</name>e. What food have we got left?'</q></p>
<p><q>'Only those, what d'you call 'em, _lembas_, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. A fair supply. But they are better than naught, by a long bite. I never thought, though, when I <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> set tooth in them, that I should ever come to wish for a change. But I do now: a bit of plain bread, and a mug � aye, <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> a mug � of beer would go down proper. I've lugged my cooking-gear all the way from the last camp, and what use has it been? Naught to make a fire with, for a start; and naught to cook, not even grass!'</q></p>
<p>They turned away and went down into a stony hollow. The weste<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng sun was caught into clouds, and <name type="TIME">night</name> came swiftly. They slept as well as they could for the cold, turn and turn about, in a nook among great jagged pinnacles of weathered rock; at least they were sheltered from the easterly wind.</p>
<p>`Did you see them again, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>?' asked <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, as they sat, stiff and chilled, mun<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g wafers of _lembas_, in the cold grey of <name type="TIME">early <name type="TIME">morning</name></name>.</p>
<p><q>'No,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>'ve heard nothing, and seen nothing, for <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> <name type="TIME">night</name>s now.'</p>
<p>`Nor me,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. `Grrr! Those eyes did give me a turn! But perhaps we've shaken him off at last, the miserable slinker. <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>! I'll give him _<name type="PERSON">gollum</name>_ in his throat, if ever I get my hands on his neck.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I hope you'll never need to,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t know how he followed us; but it may be that he's lost us again, as you say. In this dry bleak land we can't leave many footp<name type="GPE">ri</name>nts, nor much scent, even for his snuffling nose.'</p>
<p><q>'I hope that's the way of it,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <q>'I wish we could be <name type="GPE">ri</name>d of him for good!'</q></p>
<p><q>'So do I,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>; <q>'but he's not my chief trouble. I wish we could get away from these hills! I hate them. I feel all naked on the east side, stuck up here with nothing but the dead flats between me and that <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name> yonder. There's an <name type="PRODUCT">Eye</name> in it. Come on! We've got to get down to<name type="DATE">day</name> somehow.'</q></p>
<p>But that <name type="DATE">day</name> wore on, and when <name type="TIME">after<name type="TIME">noon</name></name> faded towards <name type="TIME">evening</name> they were still scrambling along the <name type="GPE">ri</name>dge and had found no way of escape.</p>
<p>Sometimes in the silence of that barren country they fancied that they heard faint sounds behind them, a st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> falling, or the imagined step of flapping feet on the rock. But if they halted and stood still lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing, they heard no more, nothing but the wind sighing over the edges of the st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s � yet even that reminded them of breath softly hissing through sharp teeth.</p>
<p>All that <name type="DATE">day</name> the outer <name type="GPE">ri</name>dge of the <name type="ORG">Emyn Muil</name> had been bending gradually northward, as they struggled on. Along its b<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk there now stretched a wide tumbled flat of scored and weathered rock, cut every now and again by trench-like gullies that sloped steeply down to deep notches in the cliff-face. To find a path in these clefts, which were becoming deeper and more frequent, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> were d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ven to their left, well away from the edge, and they did not notice that for <name type="QUANTITY">several miles</name> they had been going slowly but steadily downhill: the cliff-top was sinking towards the level of the lowlands.</p>
<p>At last they were brought to a halt. The <name type="GPE">ri</name>dge took a sharper bend northward and was gashed by a deeper ravine. On the further side it reared up again, many fathoms at a single leap: a great grey cliff loomed before them, cut sheer down as if by a knife stroke. They could go no further forwards, and must turn now either west or east. But west would lead them only into more labour and delay, back towards the heart of the hills; east would take them to the outer precipice.</p>
<p>`There's nothing for it but to scramble down this gully, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. `Let's see what it leads to!'</q></p>
<p><q>'A nasty drop, I'll bet,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>.</p>
<p>The cleft was longer and deeper than it seemed. Some way down they found a few gnarled and stunted trees, the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> they had seen for <name type="DATE">day</name>s: twisted birch for the most part, with here and there a fir-tree. Many were dead and gaunt, bit<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> to the core by the eastern winds. Once in milder <name type="DATE">day</name>s there must have been a fair thicket in the ravine, but now, after some <name type="CARDINAL">fifty</name> yards, the trees came to an end, though old broken stumps straggled on almost to the cliff's b<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk. The bot<name type="PERSON">tom</name> of the gully, which lay along the edge of a rock-fault, was rough with broken st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> and slanted steeply down. When they came at last to the end of it, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> stooped and leaned out.</p>
<p>`<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok!<q>' he said. `We must have come down a long way, or else the cliff has sunk. It's much lower here than it was, and it looks easier too.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> knelt beside him and peered reluctantly over the edge. Then he glanced up at the great cliff <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing up, away on their left. `Easier! <q>' he grunted. <name type="ORG">`Well</name>, I suppose it's always easier getting down than up. Those as can't fly can jump!'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`I</name>t would be a big jump still,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <name type="PERSON">`A</name>bout, well' � he stood for a moment measu<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng it with his eyes � `<name type="CARDINAL">about <name type="CARDINAL">eight</name>een</name> fathoms I should guess. Not more.'</q></p>
<p><q>'And that's enough! ' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. `Ugh! <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w I do hate looking down from a h<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name>! But looking's better than climbing.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`A</name>ll the same,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, <name type="PERSON">`I</name> think we could climb here; and I think we shall have to try. See � the rock is quite different from what it was <name type="QUANTITY">a few miles</name> back. It has slipped and cracked.'</q></p>
<p>The outer fall was indeed no longer sheer, but sloped outwards a little. It looked like a great rampart or sea-wall whose foundations had shifted, so that its courses were all twisted and disordered, leaving great fissures and long slanting edges that were in places almost as wide as stairs.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`A</name>nd if we're going to try and get down, we had better try at once. It's getting dark early. I think there's a storm coming.'</p>
<p>The smoky blur of the mountains in the <name type="LOC">East</name> was lost in a deeper blackness that was already rea<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g out westwards with long arms. There was a distant mutter of thunder borne on the <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing breeze. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> snif<name type="ORG">fed</name> the air and looked up doubtfully at the sky. He strapped his belt outside his cloak and tigh<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed it, and settled his light pack on his back; then he stepped towards the edge. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>'m going to try it,' he said.</p>
<p>`Very good! <q>' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> gloomily. `But I'm going <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q>'You? ' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. `What's made you change your mind about climbing?'</q></p>
<p><q>'I haven't changed my mind. But it's only sense: put the <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> lowest as is most likely to slip. I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t to come down atop of you and knock you off no sense in killing <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> with <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> fall.'</q></p>
<p>Before <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> could stop him, he sat down, swung his legs over the b<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk, and twisted round, scrabbling with his toes for a foothold. It is doubtful if he ever did anything braver in cold blood, or more unwise.</p>
<p><q>'No, no! <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, you old ass! ' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. `You'll kill yourself for certain going over like that without even a look to see what to make for. Come back! ' He took <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> under the armpits and hauled him up again. 'Now, wait a bit and be patient! ' he said. Then he lay on the ground, leaning out and looking down: but the light seemed to be fading quickly, although the sun had not yet set. 'I think we could manage this,'</q> he said presently. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> could at any rate; and you could too. if you kept your head and followed me carefully.'</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`I</name> <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t know how you can be so sure,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. `Why! You can't see to the bot<name type="PERSON">tom</name> in this light. What if you comes to a place where there's nowhere to put your feet or your hands?'</q></p>
<p><q>'Climb back, I suppose,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.</p>
<p><q>'Easy said,'</q> objected <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <q>'Better wait till <name type="TIME">morning</name> and more light.'</q></p>
<p>`No! Not if I can help it,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> with a sudden strange vehemence. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> grudge <name type="TIME">every <name type="TIME">hour</name></name>, every minute. I'm going down to try it out. <name type="PERSON">Don</name>'t you follow till I come back or call!'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">G<name type="GPE">ri</name>p</name>ping the stony lip of <name type="DATE">the fall</name> with his fingers he let himself gently down, until when his arms were almost at full stretch, his toes found a ledge. <q>'On_ e step down! ' he said. 'And this ledge broadens out to the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght. I could stand there without a hold. I'll-'</q> his words were cut short.</p>
<p>The hurrying darkness, now gathe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng great speed, rushed up from the <name type="LOC">East</name> and swallowed the sky. There was a dry splitting crack of thunder <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght overhead. <name type="LOC">Sea</name><name type="GPE">ri</name>ng lightning smote down into the hills. Then came a blast of savage wind, and with it, mingling with its roar, there came a high sh<name type="GPE">ri</name>ll sh<name type="GPE">ri</name>ek. The hobbits had heard just such a cry far away in the <name type="ORG">Ma<name type="GPE">ri</name>sh</name> as they fled from <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbiton, and even there in the woods of the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> it had frozen their blood. Out here in the waste its terror was far greater: it pierced them with cold blades of horror and despair, stopping heart and breath. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> fell flat on his face. Involunta<name type="GPE">ri</name>ly <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> loosed his hold and put his hands over his head and ears. He swayed, slipped, and slithered downwards with a wailing cry.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> heard him and crawled with an effort to the edge. <q>'Master, master! ' he called. 'Master!'</q>.</p>
<p>He heard no answer. He found he was shaking all over, but he gathered his breath, and once again he shouted: <q>'Master!'</q> The wind seemed to blow his voice back into his throat, but as it passed, roa<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng up the gully and away over the hills, a faint answe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng cry came to his ears:</p>
<p><q>'All <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght, all <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght! I'm here. But I can't see.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> was calling with a weak voice. ,He was not actually very far away. He had slid and not fallen, and had come up with a jolt to his feet on a wider ledge not many yards lower down. Fortunately the rock-face at this point leaned well back and the wind had pressed him against the cliff, so that he had not toppled over. He steadied himself a little, laying his face against the cold st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, feeling his heart pounding. But either the darkness had grown complete, or else his eyes had lost their sight. All was black about him. He wondered if he had been struck blind. He took a deep breath.</p>
<p>`Come back! Come back! ' he heard <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>'s voice out of the blackness above.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`I</name> can't,<q>' he said. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> can't see. I can't find any hold. I can't move yet.'</q></p>
<p>`What can I do, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>? What can I do? ' shouted <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, leaning out dangerously far. Why could not his master see? It was dim, certainly, but not as dark as all that. He could see <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> below him, a grey forlorn figure splayed against the cliff. But he was far out of the reach of any helping hand.</p>
<p>There was another crack of thunder; and then the rain came. In a blinding sheet, mingled with <name type="PERSON">hai</name>l, it drove against the cliff, bitter cold.</p>
<p><q>'I'm coming down to you,'</q> shouted <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, though how he hoped to help in that way he could not have said.</p>
<p>`No, no! wait! <q>' <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> called back, more strongly now. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> shall be better soon. I feel better already. Wait! You can't do anything without a rope.'</q></p>
<p><name type="TIME">`Rope</name>!<q>' c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, talking wildly to himself in his excitement and relief. <name type="ORG">`Well</name>, if I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t deserve to be hung on the end of <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> as a warning to numbskulls! You're nowt but a <name type="GPE">ninnyhammer</name>, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> <name type="PERSON">Gamgee</name>: that's what the <name type="PERSON">Gaffer</name> said to me of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> enough, it being a word of his. Rope!'</q></p>
<p>`Stop chatte<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng!' c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, now recovered enough to feel both amused and annoyed. 'Never mind your <name type="PERSON">Gaffer</name>! Are you trying to tell yourself you've got some rope in your pocket? If so, out with it!</p>
<p>`Yes, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, in my pack and all. Car<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed it <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name>s of miles and I'd clean forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> it!'</p>
<p>`Then get busy and let an end down!'</p>
<p>Quickly <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> unslung his pack and rummaged in it. There indeed at the bot<name type="PERSON">tom</name> was a coil of the silken-grey rope made by the folk of L�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en. He cast an end to his master. The darkness seemed to lift from <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s eyes, or else his sight was returning. He could see the grey line as it came dangling down, and he thought it had a faint silver sheen. Now that he had some point in the darkness to fix his eyes on, he felt less giddy. Leaning his w<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name> forward, he made the end fast round his waist, and then he grasped the line with both hands.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> stepped back and braced his feet against a stump a yard or <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> from the edge. <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>f hauled, <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> scrambling. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> came up and threw himself on the ground.</p>
<p>Thunder growled and rumbled in the distance, and the rain was still falling heavily. The hobbits crawled away back into the gully; but they did not find much shelter there. <name type="PERSON">Rills</name> of water began to run down; soon they grew to a spate that splashed and fumed on the st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s, and spouted out over the cliff like the gutters of a vast roof.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`I</name> should have been <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> drowned down there, or washed clean off,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. 'What a piece of luck you had that rope!'</q></p>
<p>`Better luck if I'd thought of it so<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>r,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. '<name type="DATE">May</name>be you remember them putting the ropes in the boats, as we started off: in the elvish country. I took a fancy to it, and I stowed a coil in my pack. <name type="DATE">Years ago</name>, it seems. "It may be a help in many needs," he said: <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>dir, or <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of those folk. And he spoke <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`A</name> pity I didn't think of b<name type="GPE">ri</name>nging another length,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>; `but I left the <name type="ORG">Company</name> in such a hurry and confusion. If only we had enough we could use it to get down. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w long is your rope, I wonder?'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> paid it out slowly, measu<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng it with his arms: <q>'<name type="CARDINAL">Five</name>, <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>, <name type="CARDINAL">twenty</name>, <name type="CARDINAL">thirty</name> ells, more or less,'</q> he said.</p>
<p><q>'Who'd have thought it!'</q> <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> exclaimed.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`A</name>h! Who would? <q>' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. `<name type="ORG">Elves</name> are wonderful folk. It looks a bit thin, but it's tough; and soft as milk to the hand. Packs close too, and as light as light. Wonderful folk to be sure!'</q></p>
<p>`<name type="CARDINAL">Thirty</name> ells! <q>' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> conside<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng. 'I believe it would be enough. If the storm passes <name type="TIME">before <name type="TIME">night</name></name>fall, I'm going to try it.'</q></p>
<p>`The rain's nearly given over already,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>; 'but <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t you go doing anything <name type="GPE">ri</name>sky in the dim again, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>! And I haven't got over that sh<name type="GPE">ri</name>ek on the wind yet, if you have. Like a <name type="ORG">Black</name> <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name> it sounded-but <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> up in the air, if they can fly. I'm thinking we'd best lay up in this crack till <name type="TIME">night</name>'s over.'</q></p>
<p><q>'And I'm thinking that I won't spend a moment longer than I need stuck up on this edge with the eyes of the Dark Country looking over the <name type="PERSON">mar</name>shes,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.</p>
<p>With that he stood up and went down to the bot<name type="PERSON">tom</name> of the gully again. He looked out. Clear sky was growing in the <name type="LOC">East</name> once more. The skirts of the storm were lifting, ragged and wet, and the main battle had passed to spread its great wings over the <name type="ORG">Emyn Muil</name>; upon which the dark thought of <name type="ORG">Sauron</name> brooded for a while. Thence it turned, smiting the Vale of <name type="GPE">Anduin</name> with <name type="PERSON">hai</name>l and lightning, and casting its shadow upon Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name> with threat of war. Then, lowe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng in the mountains, and gathe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng its great spires, it rolled on slowly over <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> and the skirts of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>, until far away the <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s on the plain saw its black towers moving behind the sun, as they rode into the <name type="LOC">West</name>. But here, over the desert and the <name type="GPE">reek</name>ing <name type="PERSON">mar</name>shes the deep blue sky of <name type="TIME">evening</name> opened once more, and a few pallid stars appeared, like small white holes in the canopy above <name type="LOC">the crescent moon</name>.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`I</name>t's good to be able to see again,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, breathing deep. <name type="PERSON">`Do</name> you know, I thought for a bit that I had lost my sight? From the lightning or something else worse. I could see nothing, nothing at all, until the grey rope came down. It seemed to shimmer somehow.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`I</name>t does look sort of silver in the dark,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. `Never noticed it before, though I can't remember as I've ever had it out since I <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> stowed it. But if you're so set on climbing, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, how are you going to use it? <name type="CARDINAL">Thirty</name> ells, or say, <name type="CARDINAL">about <name type="CARDINAL">eight</name>een</name> fathom: that's no more than your guess at the h<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name> of the cliff.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> thought for a while. `Make it fast to that stump, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>! <q>' he said. `Then I think you shall have your wish this time and go <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>. I'll lower you, and you need do no more than use your feet and hands to <name type="PERSON">fen</name>d yourself off the rock. Though, if you put your w<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name> on some of the ledges and give me a rest, it will help. When you're down, I'll follow. I feel quite myself again now.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Very well,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> heavily. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>f it must be, let's get it over! ' He took up the rope and made it fast over the stump nearest to the b<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk; then the other end he tied about his own waist. Reluctantly he turned and prepared to go over the edge a <name type="ORG">sec</name>ond time.</p>
<p>It did not, however, turn out <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> as bad as he had expected. The rope seemed to give him confidence, though he shut his eyes more than once when he looked down between his feet. There was <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> awkward spot, where there was no ledge and the wall was sheer and even undercut for a short space; there he slipped and swung out on the silver line. But <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> lowered him slowly and steadily, and it was over at last. His chief fear had been that the rope-length would give out while he was still high up, but there was still a good bight in <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s hands, when <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> came to the bot<name type="PERSON">tom</name> and called up: <name type="PERSON">`I</name>'m down! ' His voice came up clearly from below, but <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> could not see him; his grey <name type="ORG">elven</name>-cloak had melted into the <name type="TIME">twilight</name>.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> took rather more time to follow him. He had the rope about his waist and it was fast above, and he had shor<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed it so that it would pull him up before he reached the ground; still he did not <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t to <name type="GPE">ri</name>sk a fall, and he had not quite <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>'s faith in this slender grey line. He found <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> places, all the same, where he had to trust wholly to it: smooth surfaces where there was no hold even for his strong hobbit fingers and the ledges were far apart. But at last he too was down.</p>
<p><name type="ORG">`Well</name>!<q>' he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed. `We've <name type="PERSON">don</name>e it! We've escaped from the <name type="ORG">Emyn Muil</name>! And now what next, I wonder? <name type="DATE">May</name>be we shall soon be sighing for good hard rock under foot again.'</q></p>
<p>But <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> did not answer: he was sta<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng back up the cliff. `<name type="ORG">Ninnyhammers</name>! <q>' he said. `Noodles! My beautiful rope! There it is tied to a stump, and we're at the bot<name type="PERSON">tom</name>. Just as nice a little stair for that slinking <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> as we could leave. Better put up a signpost to say which way we've g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>! I thought it seemed a bit too easy.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`I</name>f you can think of any way we could have both used the rope and yet brought it down with us, then you can pass on to me <name type="GPE">ninnyhammer</name>, or any other name your <name type="PERSON">Gaffer</name> gave you,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. `Climb up and untie it and let yourself down, if you <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t to!'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> scratched his head. `No, I can't think how, begging your par<name type="PERSON">don</name>,<q>' he said. `But I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t like leaving it, and that's a fact.'</q> He stroked the rope's end and shook it gently. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>t goes hard parting with anything I brought out of the <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name>-country. Made by <name type="PERSON">Galad<name type="GPE">ri</name>el</name> herself, too, maybe. <name type="PERSON">Galad<name type="GPE">ri</name>el</name>,' he murmured nodding his head mournfully. He looked up and gave <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> last pull to the rope as if in farewell.</p>
<p>To the complete surp<name type="GPE">ri</name>se of both the hobbits it came loose. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> fell over, and the long grey coils slithered silently down on top of him. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> laughed. `Who tied the rope? <q>' he said. <name type="PERSON">`A</name> good thing it held as long as it did! To think that I trusted all my w<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name> to your knot!'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> did not laugh. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> may not be much good at climbing, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>,<q>' he said in injured t<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s, `but I do know something about rope and about knots. It's in the family, as you might say. Why, my grand-dad, and my uncle <name type="PERSON">Andy</name> after him, him that was the <name type="PERSON">Gaffer</name>'s eldest brother he had a rope-walk over by <name type="ORG">Tighfield</name> many <name type="DATE">a <name type="DATE">year</name></name>. And I put as fast a hitch over the stump as any <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> could have <name type="PERSON">don</name>e, in the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> or out of it.'</q></p>
<p>`Then the rope must have broken � frayed on the rock-edge, I expect,' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`I</name> bet it didn't! <q>' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> in an even more injured voice. He stooped and examined the ends. `Nor it hasn't neither. Not a strand!'</q></p>
<p><q>'Then I'm afraid it must have been the knot,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> shook his head and did not answer. He was passing the rope through his fingers thoughtfully. `Have it your own way, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>,<q>' he said at last, `but I think the rope came off itself � when I called.'</q> He coiled it up and stowed it lovingly in his pack.</p>
<p><q>'It certainly came,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, `and that's the chief thing. But now we've got to think of our next move. Night will be on us soon. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w beautiful the stars are, and the <name type="PERSON">Moon</name>!'</p>
<p><q>'They do cheer the heart, <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t they? ' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> looking up. '<name type="PERSON">Elvish</name> they are. somehow. And the <name type="PERSON">Moon</name>'s growing. We haven't seen him for <name type="TIME">a <name type="TIME">night</name></name> or <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> in this cloudy weather. He's beginning to give quite a light.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Yes,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>; `but he won't be full for some <name type="DATE">day</name>s. I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t think we'll try the <name type="PERSON">mar</name>shes by the light of <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> a moon.'</p>
<p>Under the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> shadows of <name type="TIME">night</name> they started out on the next stage of their journey. After a while <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> turned and looked back at the way they had come. The mouth of the gully was a black notch in the dim cliff. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>'m glad we've got the rope,<q>' he said. 'We've set a little puzzle for that footpad, anyhow. He can try his nasty flappy feet on those ledges!'</q></p>
<p>They picked their steps away from the skirts of the cliff, among a wilderness of boulders and rough st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s, wet and slippery with the heavy rain. The ground still fell away sharply. They had not g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> very far when they came upon a great fissure that yawned suddenly black before their feet. It was not wide, but it was too wide to jump across in the dim light. They thought they could hear water gurgling in its depths. It curved away on their left northward, back towards the hills. and so barred their road in that direction, at any rate while darkness lasted.</p>
<p><q>'We had better try a way back southwards along the line of the cliff, I think,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. `We might find some nook there, or even a cave or something.'</p>
<p><q>'I suppose so,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'I'm tired. and I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t think I can scramble among st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s much longer to<name type="TIME">night</name> � though I grudge the delay. I wish there was a clear path in front of us: then I'd go on till my legs gave way.'</q></p>
<p>They did not find the going any easier at the broken feet of the <name type="ORG">Emyn Muil</name>. Nor did <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> find any nook or hollow to shelter in: only bare stony slopes frowned over by the cliff, which now rose again, higher and more sheer as they went back. In the end, worn out, they just cast themselves on the ground under <name type="PERSON">the lee</name> of a boulder lying not far from the foot of the precipice. There for some time they sat huddled mournfully together in the cold stony <name type="TIME">night</name>, while sleep crept upon them in spite of all they could do to hold it off. The moon now rode high and clear. Its thin white light lit up the faces of the rocks and drenched the cold frowning walls of the cliff, turning all the wide looming darkness into a chill pale grey scored with black shadows.</p>
<p><q>'Well! ' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, standing up and drawing his cloak more closely round him. `You sleep for a bit <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> and take my blanket. I'll walk up and down on sentry for a while.'</q> Suddenly he stif<name type="PERSON">fen</name>ed, and stooping he g<name type="GPE">ri</name>pped <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> by the arm. `What's that? <q>' he whispered. `<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok over there on the cliff!'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> looked and breathed in sharply through his teeth. `Ssss!<q>' he said. 'That's what it is. It's that <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>! Snakes and adders! And to think that I thought that we'd puzzle him with our bit of a climb! <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok at him! Like a nasty crawling spider on a wall.'</q></p>
<p>Down the face of a precipice, sheer and almost smooth it seemed in the pale moonlight, a small black shape was moving with its thin limbs splayed out. <name type="DATE">May</name>be its soft clinging hands and toes were finding crevices and holds that no hobbit could ever have seen or used, but it looked as if it was just creeping down on sticky pads, like some large prowling thing of in<name type="ORG">sec</name>t-kind. And it was coming down head <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>, as if it was smelling its way. Now and again it lifted its head slowly, turning it <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght back on its long skinny neck, and the hobbits caught a glimpse of <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> small pale gleaming lights, its eyes that blinked at the moon for a moment and then were quickly lidded again.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`Do</name> you think he can see us? ' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`I</name> <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t know,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> quietly, `but I think not. It is hard even for f<name type="GPE">ri</name>endly eyes to see these <name type="ORG">elven</name>-cloaks: I cannot see you in the shadow even at a few paces. And I've heard that he doesn't like <name type="ORG">Sun</name> or <name type="PERSON">Moon</name>.'</q></p>
<p>`Then why is he coming down just here? ' asked <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>.</p>
<p><q>'Quietly, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>! ' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <name type="PERSON">`He</name> can smell us, perhaps. And he can hear as keen as <name type="ORG">Elves</name>, I believe. I think he has heard something now: our voices probably. We did a lot of shouting away back there; and we were talking far too loudly until <name type="TIME">a minute</name> ago.'</q></p>
<p><name type="ORG">`Well</name>, I'm sick of him,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <name type="PERSON">`He</name>'s come once too of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> for me and I'm going to have a word with him, if I can. I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t suppose we could give him the slip now anyway.'</q> Drawing his grey hood well over his face, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> crept stealthily towards the cliff.</p>
<p>`Careful!<q>' whispered <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> coming behind. `<name type="PERSON">Don</name>'t alarm him! He's much more dangerous than he looks.'</q></p>
<p>The black crawling shape was now <name type="CARDINAL">three</name>-quarters of the way down, and perhaps <name type="CARDINAL">fifty</name> feet or less above the cliff's foot. Crou<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>-still in the shadow of a large boulder the hobbits watched him. He seemed to have come to a difficult passage or to be troubled about something. They could hear him snuffling, and now and again there was a harsh hiss of breath that sounded like a curse. He lifted his head, and they thought they heard him spit. Then he moved on again. Now they could hear his voice creaking and whistling.</p>
<p>`<name type="PERSON">Ach</name>, sss! Cautious, my precious! More haste less speed. We musstn't <name type="GPE">ri</name>ssk our neck, musst we, precious? No, precious � _<name type="PERSON">gollum</name>_!<q>' He lifted his head again, blinked at the moon, and quickly shut his eyes. `We hate it,'</q> he hissed. `<name type="ORG">Nassty</name>, <name type="ORG">nassty</name> shivery light it is � sss � it spies on us, precious � it hurts our eyes.'</p>
<p>He was getting lower now and the hisses became sharper and clearer. <q>'Where iss it, where iss it: my Precious, my Precious? It's ours, it is, and we <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ts it. The thieves, the thieves, the filthy little thieves. Where are they with my Precious? Curse them! We hates them.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`I</name>t doesn't sound as if he knew we were here, does it? ' whispered <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <name type="PERSON">`A</name>nd what's his Precious? Does he mean the'</p>
<p>`Hsh! <q>' breathed <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. 'He's getting near now, near enough to hear a whisper.'</q></p>
<p>Indeed <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> had suddenly paused again, and his large head on its scrawny neck was lolling from side to side as if he was lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing. His pale eyes were <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> unlidded. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> restrained himself, though his fingers were twit<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g. His eyes, filled with anger and disgust, were fixed on the wretched creature as he now began to move again, still whispe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng and hissing to himself.</p>
<p>At last he was no more than <name type="CARDINAL">a <name type="CARDINAL">dozen</name></name> feet from the ground, <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght above their heads. From that point there was a sheer drop, for the cliff was slightly undercut, and even <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> could not find a hold of any kind. He seemed to be trying to twist round, so as to go legs <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>, when suddenly with a sh<name type="GPE">ri</name>ll whistling sh<name type="GPE">ri</name>ek he fell. As he did so, he curled his legs and arms up round him, like a spider whose descending thread is snapped.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> was out of his hiding in a flash and crossed the space between him and the cliff foot in a couple of leaps. Before <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> could get up, he was on top of him. But he found <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> more than he bargained for, even taken like that, suddenly, off his guard after a fall. Before <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> could get a hold, long legs and arms were wound round him pinning his arms, and a clinging g<name type="GPE">ri</name>p, soft but hor<name type="GPE">ri</name>bly strong, was squeezing him like slowly tigh<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing cords; clammy fingers were feeling for his throat. Then sharp teeth bit into his shoulder. All he could do was to butt his hard round head sideways into the creature's face. <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> hissed and spat, but he did not let go.</p>
<p>Things would have g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> ill with <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, if he had been al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. But <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> sprang up, and drew <name type="PERSON">Sting</name> from its sheath. With his left hand he drew back <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>'s head by his thin lank <name type="PERSON">hai</name>r, stret<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g his long neck, and forcing his pale venomous eyes to stare up at the sky.</p>
<p>`Let go! <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>,<q>' he said. `This is <name type="PERSON">Sting</name>. You have seen it before once upon a time. Let go, or you'll feel it this time! I'll cut your throat.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> collapsed and went as loose as wet st<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> got up, finge<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng his shoulder. His eyes smouldered with anger, but he could not avenge himself: his miserable enemy lay grovelling on the st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s whimpe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng.</p>
<p>`<name type="PERSON">Don</name>'t hurt us! <name type="PERSON">Don</name>'t let them hurt us, precious! They won't hurt us will they, nice little hobbitses? We didn't mean no harm, but they jumps on us like cats on poor mices, they did, precious. And we're so l<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>ly, _<name type="PERSON">gollum</name>_. We'll be nice to them, very nice, if they'll be nice to us, won't we, yes, yess.'</p>
<p><name type="ORG">`Well</name>, what's to be <name type="PERSON">don</name>e with it? <q>' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. `Tie it up, so as it can't come sneaking after us no more, I say.'</q></p>
<p>`But that would kill us, kill us,<q>' whimpered <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>. `<name type="WORK_OF_ART">Cruel</name> little hobbitses. Tie us up in the cold hard lands and leave us, _<name type="PERSON">gollum</name>_, _<name type="PERSON">gollum</name>_.'</q> Sobs welled up in his gobbling throat.</p>
<p>`No,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>f we kill him, we must kill him out<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght. But we can't do that, not as things are. Poor wretch! He has <name type="PERSON">don</name>e us no harm.'</q></p>
<p>`Oh hasn't he! <q>' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> rubbing his shoulder. <name type="PERSON">`A</name>nyway he meant to, _and_ he means to, I'll warrant. <name type="PERSON">Thr</name>ottle us in our sleep, that's his plan.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I daresay,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. `But what he means to do is another matter.' He paused for a while in thought. <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> lay still, but stopped whimpe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> stood glowe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng over him.</p>
<p>It seemed to <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> then that he heard, quite plainly but far off, voices out of the past:</p>
<p>_What a pity <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> did not stub the vile creature, when he had a chance!_</p>
<p>_Pity? It was Pity that stayed his hand. Pity, and <name type="ORG">Mercy</name>: not to st<name type="GPE">ri</name>ke without need._</p>
<p>_I do not feel any pity for <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>. He deserves death._</p>
<p>_Deserves death! I daresay he does. Many that live deserve death. And some die that deserve life. Can you give that to them? Then be not too eager to deal out death in the name of justice, fea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng for your own safety. Even the wise cannot see all ends._</p>
<p>`Very well,<q>' he answered aloud, lowe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng his sword. 'But still I am afraid. And yet, as you see, I will not touch the creature. For now that I see him, I do pity him.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> stared at his master, who seemed to be speaking to some <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> who was not there. <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> lifted his head.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Yess</name>, wretched we are, precious,'</q> he whined. <q>'Misery misery! <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbits won't kill us, nice hobbits.'</q></p>
<p><q>'No, we won't,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. `But we won't let you go, either. You're full of wickedness and mischief, <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>. You will have to come with us, that's all, while we keep an eye on you. But you must help us, if you can. <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> good turn deserves another.'</p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Yess</name>, yes indeed,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> sitting up. '<name type="GPE">Nice</name> hobbits! We will come with them. Find them safe paths in the dark, yes we will. And where are they going in these cold hard lands, we wonders, yes we wonders? ' He looked up at them, and a faint light of cunning and eagerness flickered for a <name type="ORG">sec</name>ond in his pale blinking eyes.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> scowled at him, and sucked his teeth; but he seemed to sense that there was something odd about his master's mood and that the matter was beyond argument. All the same he was amazed at <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s reply.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> looked straight into <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>'s eyes which flinched and twisted away. `You know that, or you guess well enough, Sm�agol,<q>' he said. quietly and sternly. `We are going to <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>, of course. And you know the way there, I believe.'</q></p>
<p>`<name type="PERSON">Ach</name>! sss! <q>' said <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>, cove<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng his ears with his hands, as if such frankness, and the open speaking of the names, hurt him. `We guessed, yes we guessed,'</q> he whispered; `and we didn't <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t them to go, did we? No, precious, not the nice hobbits. Ashes, ashes, and dust, and thirst there is; and pits, pits, pits, and <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s, <name type="CARDINAL">thousands</name> of <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>ses. <name type="GPE">Nice</name> hobbits mustn't go to � sss � those places.'</p>
<p>`So you have been there? <q>' <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> insisted. <name type="PERSON">`A</name>nd you're being drawn back there, aren't you?'</q></p>
<p>`<name type="PERSON">Yess</name>. <name type="PERSON">Yess</name>. No! <q>' sh<name type="GPE">ri</name>eked <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>. `Once, by accident it was, wasn't it, precious? Yes, by accident. But we won't go back, no, no!'</q> Then suddenly his voice and language changed, and he sobbed in his throat, and spoke but not to them. `Leave me al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, _<name type="PERSON">gollum</name>_! You hurt me. O my poor hands, _<name type="PERSON">gollum</name>_! I, we, I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t to come back. I can't find it. I am tired. I, we can't find it, _<name type="PERSON">gollum</name>_, _<name type="PERSON">gollum</name>_, no, nowhere. They're always awake. <name type="ORG">Dwarves</name>, <name type="ORG">Men</name>, and <name type="ORG">Elves</name>, ter<name type="GPE">ri</name>ble <name type="ORG">Elves</name> with b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght eyes. I can't find it. <name type="PERSON">Ach</name>! <q>' He got up and clenched his long hand into a bony fleshless knot, shaking it towards the <name type="LOC">East</name>. 'We won't! ' he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed. 'Not for you.'</q> Then he collapsed again. <q>'_<name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>_, _<name type="PERSON">gollum</name>_,'</q> he whimpered with his face to the ground. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Don</name>'t look at us! Go away! Go to sleep!'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`He</name> will not go away or go to sleep at your command, Sm�agol,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. `But if you really wish to be free of him again. then you must help me. And that I fear means finding us a path towards him. But you need not go all the way, not beyond the gates of his land.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> sat up again and looked at him under his eyelids. <q>'He's over there,'</q> he cackled. <name type="PERSON">`A</name>lways there. <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s will take you all the way. Easy to find <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s east of the <name type="LOC">River</name>. <name type="PERSON">Don</name>'t ask Sm�agol. Poor, poor Sm�agol, he went away <name type="DATE">long ago</name>. They took his Precious, and he's lost now.'</p>
<p>`Perhaps we'll find him again, if you come with us,' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.</p>
<p><q>'No, no, never! He's lost his Precious,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>.</p>
<p>'Get up! ' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> stood up and backed away against the cliff.</p>
<p>`Now! <q>' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. 'Can you find a path easier by <name type="DATE">day</name> or by <name type="TIME">night</name>? We're tired; but if you choose the <name type="TIME">night</name>, we'll start to<name type="TIME">night</name>.'</q></p>
<p>`The big lights hurt our eyes, they do,<q>' <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> whined. `Not under <name type="WORK_OF_ART">the White Face</name>, not yet. It will go behind the hills soon, yess. Rest a bit <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>, nice hobbits!'</q></p>
<p>`Then sit down,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, `and <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t move!'</q></p>
<p>The hobbits seated themselves beside him, <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> on either side. with their backs to the stony wall, resting their legs. There was no need for any arrangement by word: they knew that they must not sleep for a moment. Slowly the moon went by. <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>s fell down from the hills, and all grew dark before them. The stars grew thick and b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght in the sky above. No <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> stirred. <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> sat with his legs drawn up, knees under <name type="PERSON">chin</name>, flat hands and feet splayed on the ground, his eyes closed; but he seemed <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>se, as if thinking or lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> looked across at <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. Their eyes met and they understood. They relaxed, leaning their heads back, and shutting their eyes or seeming to. Soon the sound of their soft breathing could be heard. <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>'s hands twitched a little. Hardly perceptibly his head moved to the left and the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght, and <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> eye and then the other opened a slit. The hobbits made no sign.</p>
<p>Suddenly, with startling agility and speed, straight off the ground with a jump like a grasshopper or a frog. <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> bounded forward into the darkness. But that was just what <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> had expected. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> was on him before he had g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> paces after his sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> coming behind grabbed his leg and threw him.</p>
<p><q>'Your rope might prove useful again, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>.'</q> he said.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> got out the rope. <q>'And where were you off to in the cold hard lands, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>?'</q> he growled. <q>'We wonders. aye, we wonders. To find some of your orc-f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends, I warrant. You nasty treacherous creature. It's round your neck this rope ought to go, and a tight noose too.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> lay quiet and t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed no further t<name type="GPE">ri</name>cks. He did not answer <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, but gave him a swift venomous look.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`A</name>ll we need is something to keep a hold on him,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. 'We <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t him to walk, so it's no good tying his legs-or his arms. he seems to use them nearly as much. Tie <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> end to his ankle, and keep a g<name type="GPE">ri</name>p on the other end.'</q></p>
<p>He stood over <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>, while <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> tied the knot. The result surp<name type="GPE">ri</name>sed them both. <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> began to scream, a thin, tea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng sound, very hor<name type="GPE">ri</name>ble to hear. He w<name type="GPE">ri</name>thed, and t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed to get his mouth to his ankle and bite the rope. He kept on screaming.</p>
<p>At last <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> was convinced that he really was in pain; but it could not be from the knot. He examined it and found that it was not too tight, indeed hardly tight enough. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> was gentler than his words. <q>'What's the matter with you? ' he said. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>f you will try to run away. you must be tied; but we <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t wish to hurt you.'</q></p>
<p><q>'It hurts us, it hurts us,'</q> hissed <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>t freezes, it bites! <name type="ORG">Elves</name> twisted it, curse them! Nasty cruel hobbits! That's why we t<name type="GPE">ri</name>es to escape, of course it is, precious. We guessed they were cruel hobbits. They visits <name type="ORG">Elves</name>, fierce <name type="ORG">Elves</name> with b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght eyes. Take it off us! It hurts us.'</p>
<p>`No, I will not take it off you,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, `not unless' � he paused a moment in thought � `not unless there is any promise you can make that I can trust.'</q></p>
<p><q>'We will swear to do what he <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ts, yes, yess, said <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>, still twisting and grabbling at his ankle. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>t hurts us.'</q></p>
<p>`Swear? ' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.</p>
<p><q>'Sm�agol,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> suddenly and clearly, opening his eyes wide and sta<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng at <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> with a strange light. <q>'Sm�agol will swear on the Precious.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> drew himself up, and again <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> was startled by his words and his stern voice. 'On the Precious? <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w dare you? ' he said. 'Think!</p>
<p><name type="CARDINAL">One</name> <name type="ORG">Ring</name> to rule them all and in the <name type="PRODUCT">Darkness</name> bind them.</p>
<p>Would you commit your promise to that, Sm�agol? It will hold you. But it is more treacherous than you are. It may twist your words. Beware!'</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> cowered. 'On the Precious. on the Precious! ' he repeated.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`A</name>nd what would you swear? ' asked <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.</p>
<p>`To be very very good,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>. Then crawling to <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s feet he grovelled before him, whispe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng hoarsely: a shudder ran over him, as if the words shook his very b<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s with fear. 'Sm�agol will swear never, never, to let Him have it. Never! Sm�agol will save it. But he must swear on the Precious.'</q></p>
<p><q>'No! not on it,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, looking down at him with stern pity. <q>'All you wish is to see it and touch it, if you can, though you know it would d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ve you mad. Not on it. Swear by it, if you will. For you know where it is. Yes, you know, Sm�agol. It is before you.'</q></p>
<p>For a moment it appeared to <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> that his master had grown and <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> had shrunk: a tall stern shadow, a mighty lord who hid his b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ghtness in grey cloud, and at his feet a little whining dog. Yet the <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> were in some way akin and not alien: they could reach <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> another's minds. <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> raised himself and began pawing at <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, fawning at his knees.</p>
<p><q>'Down! down! ' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. `Now speak your promise!'</q></p>
<p>`We promises, yes I promise!<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>. 'I will serve the master of the Precious. Good master, good Sm�agol, _<name type="PERSON">gollum</name>_, _<name type="PERSON">gollum</name>_!'</q> Suddenly he began to weep and bite at his ankle again.</p>
<p><q>'Take the rope off, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.</p>
<p>Reluctantly <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> obeyed. At once <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> got up and began prancing about, like a whipped cur whose master has patted it. From that moment a change, which lasted for some time, came over him. He spoke with less hissing and whining, and he spoke to his companions direct, not to his precious self. He would c<name type="GPE">ri</name>nge and flinch, if they stepped near him or made any sudden movement, and he avoided the touch of their <name type="ORG">elven</name>-cloaks; but he was f<name type="GPE">ri</name>endly, and indeed pitifully anxious to please. He would cackle with laughter and caper, if any jest was made, or even if <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> spoke kindly to him, and weep if <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> rebuked him. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> said little to him of any sort. He suspected him more deeply than ever, and if possible liked the new <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>, the Sm�agol, less than the old.</p>
<p><q>'Well, <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>, or whatever it is we're to call you,'</q> he said. <q>'now for it! The <name type="PERSON">Moon</name>'s g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. and the <name type="TIME">night</name>'s going. We'd better start.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Yes, yes,'</q> agreed <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>, skipping about. <q>'Off we go! There's only <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> way across between the <name type="LOC">North</name>-end and the <name type="LOC">South</name>-end. I found it, I did. <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t use it, <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t know it. <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t cross the <name type="LOC">Marshes</name>, they go round for miles and miles. Very lucky you came this way. Very lucky you found Sm�agol, yes. Follow Sm�agol!'</q></p>
<p>He took a few steps away and looked back inqui<name type="GPE">ri</name>ngly, like a dog inviting them for a walk. <q>'Wait a bit, <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. `Not too far ahead now! I'm going to be at your tail, and I've got the rope handy.'</p>
<p><q>'No, no! ' said <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>. 'Sm�agol promised.'</q></p>
<p>In the deep of <name type="TIME">night</name> under hard clear stars they set off. <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> led them back northward for a while along the way they had come; then he slanted to the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght away from the steep edge of the <name type="ORG">Emyn Muil</name>, down the broken stony slopes towards the vast <name type="PERSON">fen</name>s below. They faded swiftly and softly into the darkness. Over all the leagues of waste before the gates of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> there was a black silence.</p>
</chapter><chapter num="2"><heading>Chapter 2</heading>
<p>The Passage of the <name type="LOC">Marshes</name></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> moved quickly, with his head and neck thrust forward, of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> using his hands as well as his feet. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> were hard put to it to keep up with him; but he seemed no longer to have any thought of escaping, and if they fell behind, he would turn and wait for them. After a time he brought them to the b<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk of the narrow gully that they had struck before; but they were now further from the hills.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`He</name>re it is!<q>' he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed. 'There is a way down inside, yes. Now we follows it � out, out away over there.'</q> He pointed south and east towards the <name type="PERSON">mar</name>shes. The <name type="GPE">reek</name> of them came to their nost<name type="GPE">ri</name>ls, heavy and foul even in the cool <name type="TIME">night</name> air. .</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> cast up and down along the b<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk, and at length he called to them. <name type="PERSON">`He</name>re! We can get down here. Sm�agol went this way once: I went this way, hiding from <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s.'</p>
<p>He led the way, and following him the hobbits climbed down into the gloom. It was not difficult, for the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ft was at this point only some <name type="CARDINAL">fifteen</name> feet deep and about <name type="CARDINAL">a <name type="CARDINAL">dozen</name></name> across. There was running water at the bot<name type="PERSON">tom</name>: it was in fact the bed of <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the many small <name type="GPE">ri</name>vers that t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ckled down from the hills to feed the stagnant pools and mires beyond. <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> turned to the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght, southward more or less, and splashed along with his feet in the shallow stony stream. He seemed greatly delighted to feel the water, and chuckled to himself, sometimes even croaking in a sort of song.</p>
<p>The cold hard lands,</p>
<p>they bites our hands,</p>
<p>they gnaws our feet.</p>
<p>The rocks and st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s</p>
<p>are like old b<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s</p>
<p>all bare of meat.</p>
<p>But stream and pool</p>
<p>is wet and cool:</p>
<p>so nice for feet!</p>
<p>And now we wish -</p>
<p><q>'Ha! ha! What does we wish?'</q> he said, looking sidelong at the hobbits. <q>'We'll tell you.'</q> he croaked. <name type="PERSON">`He</name> guessed it <name type="DATE">long ago</name>, <name type="PERSON">Baggins</name> guessed it.' A glint came into his eyes, and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> cat<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g the gleam in the darkness thought it far from pleasant.</p>
<p>Alive without breath;</p>
<p>as cold as death;</p>
<p>never thirsting, ever d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nking;</p>
<p>clad in mail, never clinking.</p>
<p>Drowns on dry land,</p>
<p>thinks an island</p>
<p>is a mountain;</p>
<p>thinks a fountain</p>
<p>is a puff of air.</p>
<p>So sleek, so fair!</p>
<p>What a joy to meet!</p>
<p>We only wish</p>
<p>to catch a fish,</p>
<p>so juicy-sweet!</p>
<p>These words only made more pressing to <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>'s mind a problem that had been troubling him from the moment when he understood that hir master was going to adopt <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> as a guide: the problem of food. It did not occur to him that his master might also have thought of it. hut he supposed <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> had. Indeed how had <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> kept himself in all his l<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>ly <name type="PERSON">wan</name>de<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng? <q>'Not too well,'</q> thought <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <q>'He looks fair famished. Not too dainty to try what hobbit tastes like if there ain't no fish, I'll wager � supposing as he could catch us napping. Well, he won't: not <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> <name type="PERSON">Gamgee</name> for <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>.'</q></p>
<p>They stumbled along in the dark winding gully for a long time, or so it seemed to the tired feet of <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. The gully turned eastward, and as they went on it broadened and got gradually shallower. At last the sky above grew faint with the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> grey of <name type="TIME">morning</name>. <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> had shown no signs of ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng, but now he looked up and halted.</p>
<p>`Day is near,<q>' he whispered, as if Day was something that might overhear him and sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng on him. `Sm�agol will stay here: I will stay here, and the <name type="ORG">Yellow</name> Face won't see me.'</q></p>
<p>`We should be glad to see the <name type="ORG">Sun</name>;<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, `but we will stay here: we are too tired to go any further at present.'</q></p>
<p>`You are not wise to be glad of the <name type="ORG">Yellow</name> Face,' said <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>t shows you up. <name type="GPE">Nice</name> sensible hobbits stay with Sm�agol. <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s and nasty things are about. They can see a long way. Stay and hide with me! '</p>
<p>The <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> of them settled down to rest at the foot of the rocky wall of the gully. It was not much more than a tall man's h<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name> now, and at its base there were wide flat shelves of dry st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>; the water ran in a channel on the other side. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> sat on <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the flats, resting their backs. <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> paddled and scrabbled in the stream.</p>
<p>`We must take a little food,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <name type="PERSON">`A</name>re you hungry, Sm�agol? We have very little to share, but we will spare you what we can.'</q></p>
<p>At the word _hungry_ a greenish light was kindled in <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>'s pale eyes, and they seemed to protrude further than ever from his thin sickly face. For a moment he relapsed into his old <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>-manner. <q>'We are famisshed, yes famisshed we are. precious,'</q> he said. `What is it they eats? Have they nice fisshes? ' His tongue lolled out between his sharp yellow teeth. licking his colourless lips.</p>
<p>`No, we have got no fish,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. `We have only got this' � he held up a wafer of _lembas_ � 'and water, if the water here is fit to d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk.'</q></p>
<p>`<name type="PERSON">Yess</name>, yess, nice water,' said <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>. `D<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk it, d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk it, while we can! But what is it they've got, precious? Is it crunchable? Is it tasty? '</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> broke off a portion of a wafer and handed it to him on its leaf-wrapping. <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> snif<name type="ORG">fed</name> at the leaf and his face changed: a spasm of disgust came over it, and a hint of his old malice. `Sm�agol smells it! <q>' he said. `Leaves out of the elf-country, gah! They stinks. He climbed in those trees, and he couldn't wash the smell off his hands, my nice hands.'</q> Dropping the leaf, he took a corner of the _lembas_ and nibbled it. He spat, and a fit of coughing shook him.</p>
<p>`<name type="PERSON">Ach</name>! No! ' he spluttered. `You try to choke poor Sm�agol. Dust and ashes, he can't eat that. He must starve. But Sm�agol doesn't mind. <name type="GPE">Nice</name> hobbits! Sm�agol has promised. He will starve. He can't eat hobbits' food. He will starve. Poor thin Sm�agol! '</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`I</name>'m sorry,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>; `but I can't help you, I'm afraid. I think this food would do you good, if you would try. But perhaps you can't even try, not yet anyway.'</q></p>
<p>The hobbits munched their _lembas_ in silence. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> thought that it tasted far better, somehow, than it had for a good while: <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>'s behaviour had made him at<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>d to its flavour again. But he did not feel comfortable. <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> watched every morsel from hand to mouth, like an expectant dog by a diner's c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>r. Only when they had finished and were prepa<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng to rest, was he apparently convinced that they had no hidden dainties that he could share in. Then he went and sat by himself a few paces away and whimpered a little.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok here! ' <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> whispered to <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, not too softly: he did not really care whether <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> heard him or not. `We've got to get some sleep; but not both together with that hungry villain nigh, promise or no promise. Sm�agol or <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>, he won't change his habits in a hurry, I'll warrant. You go to sleep, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, and I'll call you when I can't keep my eyelids propped up. Turn and about, same as before, while he's loose.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Perhaps you're <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> speaking openly. <q>'There _is_ a change in him, but just what kind of a change and how deep, I'm not sure yet. Se<name type="GPE">ri</name>ously though, I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t think there is any need for fear � at present. Still watch if you wish. Give me <name type="TIME">about <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> <name type="TIME">hour</name>s</name>, not more, and then call me.'</q></p>
<p>So tired was <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> that his head fell forward on his breast and he slept. almost as soon as he had spoken the words. <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> seemed no longer to have any fears. He curled up and went quickly to sleep, quite unconcerned. Presently his breath was hissing softly through his clenched teeth, hut he lay still as st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. After a while, fea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng that he would drop off himself, if he sat lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing to his <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> companions breathing, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> got up and gently prodded <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>. His hands uncurled and twitched, but he made no other movement. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> bent down and said _fissh_ close to his ear, but there was no response, not even a catch in <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>'s breathing.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> scratched his head. `Must really be asleep,<q>' he muttered. <name type="PERSON">`A</name>nd if I was like <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>, he wouldn't wake up never again.'</q> He restrained the thoughts of his sword and the rope that sprang to his mind, and went and sat down by his master.</p>
<p>When he woke up the sky above was dim, not lighter but darker than when they had breakfasted. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> leapt to his feet. Not least from his own feeling of vigour and hunger, he suddenly understood that he had slept the <name type="DATE">day</name>light away, <name type="CARDINAL">nine</name> <name type="TIME">hour</name>s at least. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> was still fast asleep, lying now stretched on his side. <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> was not to be seen. Va<name type="GPE">ri</name>ous reproachful names for himself came to <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>'s mind, drawn from the <name type="PERSON">Gaffer</name>'s large paternal word-hoard; then it also occurred to him that his master had been <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght: there had for the present been nothing to guard against. They were at any rate both alive and unthrottled.</p>
<p>'Poor wretch! ' he said <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> remorsefully. 'Now I wonder where he's got to? '</p>
<p>'Not far, not far! ' said a voice above him. He looked up and saw the shape of <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>'s large head and ears against the <name type="TIME">evening</name> sky.</p>
<p>'Here, what are you doing? ' c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, his suspicions coming back as soon as he saw that shape.</p>
<p>`Sm�agol is hungry,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>. `Be back soon.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Come back now!'</q> shouted <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <q>'Hi! Come back!'</q> But <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> had vanished.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> woke at the sound of <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>'s shout and sat up, rubbing his eyes. <q>'<name type="ORG">Hullo</name>!'</q> he said. <q>'Anything wrong? What's the time?'</q></p>
<p><q>'I dunno,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <q>'After sundown, I reckon. And he's g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> off. Says he's hungry.'</q></p>
<p>`<name type="PERSON">Don</name>'t worry!<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. `There's no help for it. But he'll come back, you'll see. The promise will hold yet a while. And he won't leave his Precious, anyway.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> made light of it when he learned that they had slept soundly for <name type="TIME">hour</name>s with <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>, and a very hungry <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> too, loose beside them. `<name type="PERSON">Don</name>'t think of any of your <name type="PERSON">Gaffer</name>'s hard names,<q>' he said. 'You were worn out, and it has turned out well: we are now both rested. And we have a hard road ahead, the worst road of all.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`A</name>bout the food,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. '<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w long's it going to take us to do this job? And when it's <name type="PERSON">don</name>e, what are we going to do then? This <name type="PERSON">waybread</name> keeps you on your legs in a wonderful way, though it doesn't satisfy the innards proper, as you might say: not to my feeling anyhow, meaning no disrespect to them as made it. But you have to eat some of it every <name type="DATE">day</name>, and it doesn't grow. I reckon we've got enough to last, say, <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> <name type="DATE">week</name>s or so, and that with a tight belt and a light tooth, mind you. We've been a bit free with it so far.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`I</name> <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t know how long we shall take to � to finish,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. `We were miserably delayed in the hills. But <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>wise <name type="PERSON">Gamgee</name>, my dear hobbit � indeed, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> my dearest hobbit, f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end of f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends � I do not think we need give thought to what comes after that. To _do the job_ as you put it � what hope is there that we ever shall? And if we do, who knows what will come of that? If the <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> goes into the <name type="ORG">Fire</name>, and we are at hand? I ask you, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, are we ever likely to need bread again? I think not. If we can nurse our limbs to b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng us to <name type="LOC">Mount Doom</name>, that is all we can do. More than I can, I begin to feel.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> nodded silently. He took his master's hand and bent over it. He did not kiss it, though his tears fell on it. Then he turned away, drew his sleeve over his nose, and got up, and stamped about, trying to whistle, and saying between the efforts: <q>'Where's that dratted creature?'</q></p>
<p>It was actually not long before <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> returned; but he came so quietly that they did not hear him till he stood before them. His fingers and face were soiled with black mud. He was still chewing and slave<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng. What he was chewing, they did not ask or like to think.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="ORG">Worm</name>s or beetles or something slimy out of holes,'</q> thought <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. '<name type="ORG">Brr</name>! The nasty creature; the poor wretch! '</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> said nothing to them, until he had drunk deeply and washed himself in the stream. Then he came <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name> them, licking his lips. <q>'Better now,'</q> he said. <name type="PERSON">`A</name>re we rested? Ready to go on? <name type="GPE">Nice</name> hobbits, they sleep beautifully. Trust Sm�agol now? Very, very good.'</p>
<p>The next stage of their journey was much the same as the last. As they went on the gully became ever shallower and the slope of its floor more gradual. Its bot<name type="PERSON">tom</name> was less stony and more <name type="LOC">earth</name>y, and slowly its sides dwindled to mere banks. It began to wind and <name type="PERSON">wan</name>der. <name type="TIME">That <name type="TIME">night</name></name> drew to its end, but clouds were now over moon and star, and they knew of the coming of <name type="DATE">day</name> only by the slow spreading of the thin grey light.</p>
<p>In a chill <name type="TIME">hour</name> they came to the end of the water-course. The banks became moss-grown mounds. Over the last shelf of rotting st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> the stream gurgled and fell down into a brown bog and was lost. Dry reeds hissed and rattled though they could feel no wind.</p>
<p>On either side and in front wide <name type="PERSON">fen</name>s and mires now lay, stret<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g away southward and eastward into the dim <name type="CARDINAL">half</name>-light. Mists curled and smoked from dark and noisome pools. The <name type="GPE">reek</name> of them hung stifling in the still air. <name type="LOC">Far</name> away, now almost due south, the mountain-walls of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> loomed, like a black bar of rugged clouds floating above a dangerous fog-bound sea.</p>
<p>The hobbits were now wholly in the hands of <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>. They did now know, and could not guess in that misty light. that they were in fact only just within the northern borders of the <name type="PERSON">mar</name>shes. the main expanse of which lay south of them. They could, if they had known the lands, with some delay have retraced their steps a little, and then turning east have come round over hard roads to the bare plain of <name type="PERSON">Dagorlad</name>: the field of the ancient battle before the gates of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>. Not that there was great hope in such a course. On that stony plain there was no cover, and across it ran the highways of the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s and the soldiers of the Enemy. Not even the cloaks of L�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en would have concealed them there.</p>
<p>'<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w do we shape our course now, Sm�agol? ' asked <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. 'Must we cross these evil-smelling <name type="PERSON">fen</name>s? '</p>
<p>`No need, no need at all,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>. 'Not if hobbits <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t to reach the dark mountains and go to see Him very quick. Back a little, and round a little' � his skinny arm waved north and east � `and you can come on hard cold roads to the very gates of His country. <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ts of His people will be there looking out for guests, very pleased to take them straight to Him, O yes. His <name type="PRODUCT">Eye</name> watches that way all the time. It caught Sm�agol there, <name type="DATE">long ago</name>.'</q> <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> shuddered. <q>'But Sm�agol has used his eyes since then, yes, yes: I've used eyes and feet and nose since then. I know other ways. More difficult, not so quick; but better, if we <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t Him to see. Follow Sm�agol! He can take you through the <name type="PERSON">mar</name>shes, through the mists. nice thick mists. Follow Sm�agol very carefully, and you may go a long way. quite a long way, before He catches you, yes perhaps.'</q></p>
<p>It was already <name type="DATE">day</name>, a windless and sullen <name type="TIME">morning</name>, and the <name type="PERSON">mar</name>sh-<name type="GPE">reek</name>s lay in heavy banks. No sun pierced the low clouded sky, and <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> seemed anxious to continue the journey at once. So after a b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ef rest they set out again and were soon lost in a shadowy silent world, cut off from all view of the lands about, either the hills that they had left or the mountains that they sought. They went slowly in single file: <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> seemed the most weary of the <name type="CARDINAL">three</name>, and slow though they went. he of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> lagged. The hobbits soon found that what had looked like <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> vast <name type="PERSON">fen</name> was really an endless ne<name type="CARDINAL">two</name>rk of pools, and soft mires. and winding <name type="CARDINAL">half</name>-strangled water-courses. Among these a cunning eye and foot could thread a <name type="PERSON">wan</name>de<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng path. <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> certainly had that cunning, and needed all of it. His head on its long neck was ever turning this way and that, while he snif<name type="ORG">fed</name> and muttered all the time to himself. Sometimes he would hold up his hand and halt them, while he went forward a little, crou<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g, testing the ground with fingers or toes. or merely lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing with <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> ear pressed to the <name type="LOC">earth</name>.</p>
<p>It was dreary and wea<name type="GPE">ri</name>some. Cold clammy <name type="DATE">winter</name> still held sway in this forsaken country. The only green was the scum of livid weed on the dark greasy surfaces of the sullen waters. Dead grasses and rotting reeds loomed up in the mists like ragged shadows of long-forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> <name type="DATE">summer</name>s.</p>
<p>As the <name type="DATE">day</name> wore on the light increased a little, and the mists lifted, growing thinner and more transparent. <name type="LOC">Far</name> above the rot and vapours of the world the <name type="ORG">Sun</name> was <name type="GPE">ri</name>ding high and golden now in a serene country with floors of dazzling foam, but only a passing ghost of her could they see below, bleared, pale, giving no colour and no warmth. But even at this faint reminder of her presence <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> scowled and flinched. He halted their journey, and they rested, squatting like little hunted animals, in the borders of a great brown reed-thicket. There was a deep silence, only scraped on its surfaces by the faint quiver of empty seed-plumes, and broken grass-blades trembling in small air-movements that they could not feel.</p>
<p>'Not a bird! ' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> mournfully.</p>
<p>`No, no birds,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>. `<name type="GPE">Nice</name> birds! ' He licked his teeth. 'No birds here. There are snakeses, wormses, things in the pools. <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ts of things, lots of nasty things. No birds,'</q> he ended sadly. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> looked at him with distaste.</p>
<p>So passed the <name type="ORDINAL">third</name> <name type="DATE">day</name> of their journey with <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>. Before the shadows of <name type="TIME">evening</name> were long in happier lands, they went on again, always on and on with only b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ef halts. These they made not so much for rest as to help <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>; for now even he had to go forward with great care, and he was sometimes at a loss for a while. They had come to the very midst of the Dead <name type="LOC">Marshes</name>, and it was dark.</p>
<p>They walked slowly, stooping, keeping close in line, following at<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>tively every move that <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> made. The <name type="PERSON">fen</name>s grew more wet, opening into wide stagnant meres, among which it grew more and more difficult to find the firmer places where feet could tread without sinking into gurgling mud. The travellers were light, or maybe n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of them would ever have found a way through.</p>
<p>Presently it grew altogether dark: the air itself seemed black and heavy to breathe. When lights appeared <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> rubbed his eyes: he thought his head was going queer. He <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> saw <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> with the corner of his left eye, a wisp of pale sheen that faded away; but others appeared soon after: some like dimly shining smoke, some like misty flames flicke<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng slowly above unseen candles; here and there they twisted like ghostly sheets unfurled by hidden hands. But neither of his companions spoke a word.</p>
<p>At last <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> could bear it no longer. `What's all this, <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>? ' he said in a whisper. `These lights? They're all round us now. Are we trapped? Who are they? '</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> looked up. A dark water was before him, and he was crawling on the ground, this way and that, doubtful of the way. <q>'Yes, they are all round us,'</q> he whispered. 'The t<name type="GPE">ri</name>cksy lights. Candles of corpses, yes, yes. <name type="PERSON">Don</name>'t you heed them! <name type="PERSON">Don</name>'t look! <name type="PERSON">Don</name>'t follow them! Where's the master? '</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> looked back and found that <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> had lagged again. He could not see him. He went some paces back into the darkness, not da<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng to move far, or to call in more than a hoarse whisper. Suddenly he stumbled against <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, who was standing lost in thought, looking at the pale lights. His hands hung stiff at his sides; water and slime were d<name type="GPE">ri</name>pping from them.</p>
<p>`Come, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>! ' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. '<name type="PERSON">Don</name>'t look at them! <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> says we mustn't. Let's keep up with him and get out of this cursed place as quick as we can � if we can! '</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`A</name>ll <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght,' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, as if returning out of a dream. 'I'm coming. Go on! '</p>
<p>Hurrying forward again, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> t<name type="GPE">ri</name>pped, cat<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g his foot in some old root or tussock. He fell and came heavily on his hands, which sank deep into sticky ooze, so that his face was brought close to the surface of the dark mere. There was a faint hiss, a noisome smell went up, the lights flickered and danced and swirled. For a moment the water below him looked like some window, glazed with g<name type="GPE">ri</name>my glass, through which he was pee<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng. Wren<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g his hands out of the bog, he sprang back with a cry. <q>'There are dead things, dead faces in the water,'</q> he said with horror. 'Dead faces! '</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> laughed. <q>'The Dead <name type="LOC">Marshes</name>, yes, yes: that is their names,'</q> he cackled. `You should not look in when the candles are lit.'</p>
<p>`Who are they? What are they? ' asked <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> shudde<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng, turning to <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, who was now behind him.</p>
<p><q>'I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t know,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> in a dreamlike voice. <q>'But I have seen them too. In the pools when the candles were lit. They lie in all the pools, pale faces, deep deep under the dark water. I saw them: g<name type="GPE">ri</name>m faces and evil, and noble faces and sad. Many faces proud and fair, and weeds in their silver <name type="PERSON">hai</name>r. But all foul, all rotting, all dead. A fell light is in them.'</q> <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> hid his eyes in his hands. <q>'I know not who they are; but I thought I saw there <name type="ORG">Men</name> and <name type="ORG">Elves</name>, and <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s beside them.'</q></p>
<p>`Yes, yes,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>. <name type="PERSON">`A</name>ll dead, all rot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>. <name type="ORG">Elves</name> and <name type="ORG">Men</name> and <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s. The Dead <name type="LOC">Marshes</name>. There was a great battle <name type="DATE">long ago</name>, yes, so they told him when Sm�agol was young, when I was young before the Precious came. It was a great battle. Tall <name type="ORG">Men</name> with long swords, and ter<name type="GPE">ri</name>ble <name type="ORG">Elves</name>, and <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>ses sh<name type="GPE">ri</name>eking. They fought on the plain for <name type="DATE">day</name>s and <name type="DATE">months</name> at the <name type="ORG">Black</name> <name type="FAC">Gate</name>s. But the <name type="LOC">Marshes</name> have grown since then, swallowed up the graves; always creeping, creeping.'</q></p>
<p><q>'But that is an age and more ago,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. 'The Dead can't be really there! Is it some devilry hatched in the Dark Land? '</p>
<p>`Who knows? Sm�agol doesn't know,<q>' answered <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>. 'You cannot reach them, you cannot touch them. We t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed once, <name type="ORG">.yes</name>, precious. I t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed once; but you cannot reach them. Only shapes to see, perhaps, not to touch. No precious! All dead.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> looked darkly at him and shuddered again, thinking that he guessed why Sm�agol had t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed to touch them. <name type="ORG">`Well</name>, I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t to see them,' he said. 'Never again! Can't we get on and get away? '</p>
<p>`Yes, yes,' said <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>. `But slowly, very slowly. Very carefully! Or hobbits go down to join the Dead <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s and light little candles. Follow Sm�agol! <name type="PERSON">Don</name>'t look at lights! '</p>
<p>He crawled away to the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght, seeking for a path round the mere. They came close behind, stooping, of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> using their hands even as he did. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Thr</name>ee precious little <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>s in a row we shall be, if this goes on much longer,'</q> thought <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>.</p>
<p>At last they came to the end of the black mere, and they crossed it, pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>lously, crawling or hopping from <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> treacherous island tussock to another. Of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> they floundered, stepping or falling hands-<name type="ORDINAL">first</name> into waters as noisome as a cesspool, till they were slimed and fouled almost <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name> their necks and stank in <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> another's nost<name type="GPE">ri</name>ls.</p>
<p>It was <name type="TIME">late in the <name type="TIME">night</name></name> when at length they reached firmer ground again. <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> hissed and whispered to himself, but it appeared that he was pleased: in some myste<name type="GPE">ri</name>ous way, by some blended sense of feel, and smell, and uncanny memory for shapes in the dark, he seemed to know just where he was again, and to be sure of his road ahead.</p>
<p>`Now on we go! <q>' he said. '<name type="GPE">Nice</name> hobbits! Brave hobbits! Very very weary, of course; so we are, my precious, all of us. But we must take master away from the wicked lights, yes, yes, we must.'</q> With these words he started off again, almost at a trot, down what appeared to be a long lane between high reeds, and they stumbled after him as quickly as they could. But in a little while he stopped suddenly and snif<name type="ORG">fed</name> the air doubtfully, hissing as if he was troubled or displeased again.</p>
<p><q>'What is it? ' growled <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, misinterpreting the signs. `What's the need to sniff? The stink nearly knocks me down with my nose held. You stink, and master stinks; the whole place stinks.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Yes, yes, and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> stinks! ' answered <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>. `Poor Sm�agol smells it, but good Sm�agol bears it. Helps nice master. But that's no matter. The air's moving, change is coming. Sm�agol wonders; he's not happy.'</q></p>
<p>He went on again, but his uneasiness grew, and every now and again he stood <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name> his full h<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name>, craning his neck eastward and southward. For some time the hobbits could not hear or feel what was troubling him. Then suddenly all <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> halted, stif<name type="PERSON">fen</name>ing and lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing. To <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> it seemed that they heard, far away, a long wailing cry, high and thin and cruel. They shivered. At the same moment the stir<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng of the air became perceptible to them; and it grew very cold. As they stood straining their ears, they heard a noise like a wind coming in the distance. The misty lights wavered, dimmed, and went out.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> would not move. He stood shaking and gibbe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng to himself, until with a rush the wind came upon them, hissing and snarling over the <name type="PERSON">mar</name>shes. <name type="TIME">The <name type="TIME">night</name></name> became less dark, light enough for them to see, or <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> see, shapeless d<name type="GPE">ri</name>fts of fog, curling and twisting as it rolled over them and passed them. <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>oking up they saw the clouds breaking and shredding; and then high in the south the moon glimmered out, <name type="GPE">ri</name>ding in the flying wrack.</p>
<p>For a moment the sight of it gladdened the hearts of the hobbits; but <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> cowered down, mutte<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng curses on <name type="WORK_OF_ART">the White Face</name>. Then <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> sta<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng at the sky, breathing deeply of the fresher air, saw it come: a small cloud flying from the accursed hills; a black shadow loosed from <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>; a vast shape winged and ominous. It scudded across the moon, and with a deadly cry went away westward, outrunning the wind in its fell speed.</p>
<p>They fell forward, grovelling heedlessly on the cold <name type="LOC">earth</name>. But the shadow of horror wheeled and returned, passing lower now, <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght above them, sweeping the <name type="PERSON">fen</name>-<name type="GPE">reek</name> with its ghastly wings. And then it was g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, flying back to <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> with the speed of the wrath of <name type="ORG">Sauron</name>; and behind it the wind roared away, leaving the Dead <name type="LOC">Marshes</name> bare and bleak. The naked waste, as far as the eye could pierce, even to the distant menace of the mountains, was dappled with the fitful moonlight.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> got up, rubbing their eyes, like children wakened from an evil dream to find the familiar <name type="TIME">night</name> still over the world. But <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> lay on the ground as if he had been stunned. They roused him with difficulty, and for some time he would not lift his face, but knelt forward on his elbows, cove<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng the back of his head with his large flat hands.</p>
<p>`<name type="NORP">Wraiths</name>!' he wailed. `<name type="NORP">Wraiths</name> on wings! The Precious is their master. They see everything, everything. Nothing can hide from them. Curse <name type="WORK_OF_ART">the White Face</name>! And they tell Him everything. He sees, He knows. <name type="PERSON">Ach</name>, _<name type="PERSON">gollum</name>_, _<name type="PERSON">gollum</name>_, _<name type="PERSON">gollum</name>_! ' It was not until the moon had sunk, weste<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng far beyond Tol <name type="ORG">Brand</name>ir, that he would get up or make a move.</p>
<p>From that time on <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> thought that he sensed a change in <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> again. He was more fawning and would-be f<name type="GPE">ri</name>endly; but <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> surp<name type="GPE">ri</name>sed some strange looks in his eyes at times, especially towards <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>; and he went back more and more into his old manner of speaking. And <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> had another growing anxiety. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> seemed to be weary, weary to the point of exhaustion. He said nothing. indeed he hardly spoke at all; and he did not complain, but he walked like <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> who car<name type="GPE">ri</name>es a load, the w<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name> of which is ever increasing; and he dragged along, slower and slower, so that <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> had of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> to beg <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> to wait and not to leave their master behind.</p>
<p>In fact with every step towards the gates of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> felt the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> on its c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>n about his neck grow more burdensome. He was now beginning to feel it as an actual w<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name> dragging him <name type="LOC">earth</name>wards. But far more he was troubled by the <name type="PRODUCT">Eye</name>: so he called it to himself. It was that more than the drag of the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> that made him cower and stoop as he walked. The <name type="PRODUCT">Eye</name>: that hor<name type="GPE">ri</name>ble growing sense of a hostile will that strove with great power to pierce all shadows of cloud, and <name type="LOC">earth</name>, and flesh, and to see you: to pin you under its deadly gaze, naked, immovable. So thin, so frail and thin, the veils were become that still warded it off. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> knew just where the present habitation and heart of that will now was: as certainly as a man can tell the direction of the sun with his eyes shut. He was facing it, and its po<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>cy beat upon his brow.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> probably felt something of the same sort. But what went on in his wretched heart between the pressure of the <name type="PRODUCT">Eye</name>, and the lust of the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> that was so near, and his grovelling promise made <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> in the fear of cold iron, the hobbits did not guess: <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> gave no thought to it. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>'s mind was occupied mostly with his master hardly noticing the dark cloud that had fallen on his own heart. He put <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> in front of him now, and kept a watchful eye on every movement of his, supporting him if he stumbled, and trying to encourage him with clumsy words.</p>
<p>When <name type="DATE">day</name> came at last the hobbits were surp<name type="GPE">ri</name>sed to see how much closer the ominous mountains had already drawn. The air was now clearer and colder, and though still far off, the walls of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> were no longer a cloudy menace on the edge of sight, but as g<name type="GPE">ri</name>m black towers they frowned across a dismal waste. The <name type="PERSON">mar</name>shes were at an end, dying away into dead peats and wide flats of dry cracked mud. The land ahead rose in long shallow slopes, barren and pitiless, towards the desert that lay at <name type="ORG">Sauron</name>'s gate.</p>
<p>While the grey light lasted, they cowered under a black st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> like worms, sh<name type="GPE">ri</name>nking, lest the winged terror should pass and spy them with its cruel eyes. The remainder of that journey was a shadow of growing fear in which memory could find nothing to rest upon. For <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> more <name type="TIME">night</name>s they struggled on through the weary pathless land. The air, as it seemed to them, grew harsh, and filled with a bitter <name type="GPE">reek</name> that caught their breath and parched their mouths.</p>
<p>At last, on the <name type="ORDINAL">fifth</name> <name type="TIME">morning</name> since they took the road with <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>, they halted once more. Before them dark in the <name type="TIME">dawn</name> the great mountains reached <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name> roofs of smoke and cloud. Out from their feet were flung huge buttresses and broken hills that were now at the nearest scarce <name type="CARDINAL">a <name type="CARDINAL">dozen</name></name> miles away. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> looked round in horror. Dreadful as the Dead <name type="LOC">Marshes</name> had been, and the a<name type="GPE">ri</name>d moors of the <name type="NORP">Noman</name>-lands, more loathsome far was the country that the crawling <name type="DATE">day</name> now slowly unveiled to his sh<name type="GPE">ri</name>nking eyes. Even to the Mere of Dead Faces some haggard phan<name type="PERSON">tom</name> of green sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng would come; but here neither sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng nor <name type="DATE">summer</name> would ever come again. Here nothing lived, not even the leprous growths that feed on rot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ness. The gasping pools were choked with ash and crawling muds, sickly white and grey, as if the mountains had vomited the filth of their entrails upon the lands about. High mounds of crushed and powdered rock, great c<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s of <name type="LOC">earth</name> fire-blasted and poison-stained, stood like an obscene graveyard in endless rows, slowly revealed in the reluctant light.</p>
<p>They had come to the desolation that lay before <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>: the lasting monument to the dark labour of its slaves that should endure when all their purposes were made void; a land defiled, diseased beyond all healing � unless the Great <name type="LOC">Sea</name> should enter in and wash it with oblivion. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> feel sick,' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> did not speak.</p>
<p>For a while they stood there, like men on the edge of a sleep where <name type="TIME">night</name><name type="PERSON">mar</name>e lurks, holding it off, though they know that they can only come to <name type="TIME">morning</name> through the shadows. The light broadened and hardened. The gasping pits and poisonous mounds grew hideously clear. The sun was up, walking among clouds and long flags of smoke, but even the sunlight was defiled. The hobbits had no welcome for that light; unf<name type="GPE">ri</name>endly it seemed, revealing them in their helplessness � little squeaking ghosts that <name type="PERSON">wan</name>dered among the ash<name type="PERSON">-he</name>aps of the Dark <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd.</p>
<p>Too weary to go further they sought for some place where they could rest. For a while they sat without speaking under the shadow of a mound of slag; but foul fumes leaked out of it, cat<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g their throats and choking them. <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> was the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> to get up. Splutte<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng and cursing he rose, and without a word or a glance at the hobbits he crawled away on all <name type="CARDINAL">four</name>s. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> crawled after him, until they came to a wide almost circular pit, high-banked upon the west. It was cold and dead, and a foul sump of oily many-coloured ooze lay at its bot<name type="PERSON">tom</name>. In this evil hole they cowered, hoping in its shadow to escape the at<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>tion of the <name type="PRODUCT">Eye</name>.</p>
<p><name type="DATE">The <name type="DATE">day</name></name> passed slowly. A great thirst troubled them, but they drank only a few drops from their bottles-last filled in the gully, which now as they looked back in thought seemed to them a place of peace and beauty. The hobbits took it in turn to watch. At <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>, tired as they were, neither of them could sleep at all; but as the sun far away was climbing down into slow moving cloud, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> dozed. It was <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s turn to bc on guard. He lay back on the slope of the pit, but that did not ease the sense of burden that was on him. He looked up at the smoke-streaked sky and saw strange phan<name type="PERSON">tom</name>s, dark <name type="GPE">ri</name>ding shapes, and faces out of the past. He lost count of time, hove<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng between sleep and waking, until forgetfulness came over him.</p>
<p>Suddenly <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> woke up thinking that he heard his master calling. It was <name type="TIME">evening</name>. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> could not have called, for he had fallen asleep, and had slid down nearly to the bot<name type="PERSON">tom</name> of the pit. <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> was by him. For a moment <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> thought that he was trying to rouse <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>; then he saw that it was not so. <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> was talking to himself. Sm�agol was holding a debate with some other thought that used the same voice but made it squeak and hiss. A pale light and a green light alternated in his eyes as he spoke.</p>
<p>`Sm�agol promised,' said the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> thought.</p>
<p>`Yes, yes, my precious,<q>' came the answer, 'we promised: to save our Precious, not to let Him have it � never. But it's going to Him yes, nearer every step. What's the hobbit going to do with it, we wonders, yes we wonders.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`I</name> <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t know. I can't help it. Master's got it. Sm�agol promised to help the master.'</p>
<p>`Yes, yes, to help the master: the master of the Precious. But if we was master, then we could help ourselfs, yes, and still keep promises.'</p>
<p>`But Sm�agol said he would be very very good. <name type="GPE">Nice</name> hobbit! He took cruel rope off Sm�agol's leg. He speaks nicely to me.'</p>
<p><q>'Very very good, eh, my precious? Let's be good, good as fish, sweet <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, but to ourselfs. Not hurt the nice hobbit, of course, no, no.'</q></p>
<p>`But the Precious holds the promise,' the voice of Sm�agol objected.</p>
<p>`Then take it,<q>' said the other, `and let's hold it ourselfs! Then we shall be master, _<name type="PERSON">gollum</name>_! Make the other hobbit, the nasty suspicious hobbit, make him crawl, yes, _<name type="PERSON">gollum</name>_!'</q></p>
<p>`But not the nice hobbit? '</p>
<p>`Oh no, not if it doesn't please us. Still he's a <name type="PERSON">Baggins</name>, my precious, yes, a <name type="PERSON">Baggins</name>. A <name type="PERSON">Baggins</name> stole it. He found it and he said nothing, nothing. We hates <name type="PERSON">Baggins</name>es.'</p>
<p><q>'No, not this <name type="PERSON">Baggins</name>.'</q></p>
<p>'Yes, every <name type="PERSON">Baggins</name>. All peoples that keep the Precious. We must have it! '</p>
<p>`But He'll see, He'll know. He'll take it from us! '</p>
<p><q>'He sees. He knows. He heard us make silly promises � against His orders, yes. Must take it. The <name type="NORP">Wraiths</name> are sear<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g. Must take it.'</q></p>
<p>'Not for Him! '</p>
<p>'No, sweet <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. See, my precious: if we has it, then we can escape, even from Him, eh? Perhaps we grows very strong, stronger than <name type="NORP">Wraiths</name>. <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd Sm�agol? <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> the Great? _The_ <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>! Eat fish every <name type="DATE">day</name>, <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> times <name type="DATE">a <name type="DATE">day</name></name>; fresh from the sea. Most Precious <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>! Must have it. We <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ts it, we <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ts it, we <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ts it! '</p>
<p><q>'But there's <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> of them. They'll wake too quick and kill us,'</q> whined Sm�agol in a last effort. `Not now. Not yet.'</p>
<p><q>'We <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ts it! But' � and here there was a long pause, as if a new thought had wakened. `Not yet, eh? Perhaps not. She might help. She might, yes.'</q></p>
<p>`No, no! Not that way! ' wailed Sm�agol.</p>
<p>`Yes! We <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ts it! We <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ts it! '</p>
<p>Each time that the <name type="ORG">sec</name>ond thought spoke, <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>'s long hand crept out slowly, pawing towards <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, and then was drawn back with a jerk as Sm�agol spoke again. Finally both arms, with long fingers flexed and twit<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g, clawed towards his neck.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> had lain still, fascinated by this debate, but wat<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g every move that <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> made from under his <name type="CARDINAL">half</name>-closed eye-lids. To his simple mind ordinary hunger, the desire to eat hobbits, had seemed the chief danger in <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>. He realized now that it was not so: <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> was feeling the ter<name type="GPE">ri</name>ble call of the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>. The Dark <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd was _He_, of course; but <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> wondered who _She_ was. <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> of the nasty f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends the little wretch had made in his <name type="PERSON">wan</name>de<name type="GPE">ri</name>ngs, he supposed. Then he forgot the point, for things had plainly g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> far enough, and were getting dangerous. A great heaviness was in all his limbs, but he roused himself with an effort and sat up. Something warned him to be careful and not to reveal that he had overheard the debate. He let out a loud sigh and gave a huge yawn.</p>
<p>`What's the time? ' he said sleepily.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> sent out a long hiss through his teeth. He stood up for a moment, <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>se and menacing; and then he collapsed, falling forward on to all <name type="CARDINAL">four</name>s and crawling up the bank of the pit. <q>'<name type="GPE">Nice</name> hobbits! <name type="GPE">Nice</name> <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>! ' he said. 'Sleepy heads, yes, sleepy heads! Leave good Sm�agol to watch! But it's <name type="TIME">evening</name>. Dusk is creeping. <name type="PERSON">Tim</name>e to go.'</q></p>
<p>`High time! <q>' thought <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. 'And time we parted, too.'</q> Yet it crossed his mind to wonder if indeed <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> was not now as dangerous turned loose as kept with them. <q>'Curse him! I wish he was choked!'</q> he muttered. He stumbled down the bank and roused his master.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> felt refreshed. He had been dreaming. The dark shadow had passed, and a fair vision had visited him in this land of disease. Nothing remained of it in his memory, yet because of it he felt glad and lighter of heart. His burden was less heavy on him. <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> welcomed him with dog-like delight. He chuckled and chattered, cracking his long fingers, and pawing at <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s knees. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> smiled at him.</p>
<p><q>'Come! ' he said. `You have guided us well and faithfully. This is the last stage. B<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng us to the <name type="FAC">Gate</name>, and then I will not ask you to go further. B<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng us to the <name type="FAC">Gate</name>, and you may go where you wish � only not to our enemies.'</q></p>
<p><q>'To the <name type="FAC">Gate</name>, eh?'</q> <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> squeaked, seeming surp<name type="GPE">ri</name>sed and f<name type="GPE">ri</name>gh<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed. <q>'To the <name type="FAC">Gate</name>, master says! Yes, he says so. And good Sm�agol does what he asks, O yes. But when we gets closer, we'll see perhaps we'll see then. It won't look nice at all. O no! O no!'</q></p>
<p>'Go on with you! ' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. `Let's get it over! '</p>
<p>In <name type="DATE">the fall</name>ing <name type="TIME">dusk</name> they scrambled out of the pit and slowly threaded their way through the dead land. They had not g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> far before they felt once more the fear that had fallen on them when the winged shape swept over the <name type="PERSON">mar</name>shes. They halted, cowe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng on the evil-smelling ground; but they saw nothing in the gloomy <name type="TIME">evening</name> sky above, and soon the menace passed, high overhead, going maybe on some swift errand from <name type="FAC">Barad-d</name>�r. After a while <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> got up and crept forward again, mutte<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng and shaking.</p>
<p><name type="TIME">About <name type="TIME">an <name type="TIME">hour</name></name></name> after <name type="TIME">mid<name type="TIME">night</name></name> the fear fell on them <name type="CARDINAL">a <name type="ORDINAL">third</name></name> time, but it now seemed more remote, as if it were passing far above the clouds, rushing with ter<name type="GPE">ri</name>ble speed into the <name type="LOC">West</name>. <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>, however, was helpless with terror, and was convinced that they were being hunted, that their approach was known.</p>
<p>`<name type="PERSON">Thr</name>ee times! ' he whimpered. '<name type="PERSON">Thr</name>ee times is a threat. They feel us here, they feel the Precious. The Precious is their master. We cannot go any further this way, no. It's no use, no use! '</p>
<p>Pleading and kind words were no longer of any avail. It was not until <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> commanded him ang<name type="GPE">ri</name>ly and laid a hand on his sword-hilt that <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> would get up again. Then at last he rose with a snarl, and went before them like a bea<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> dog.</p>
<p>So they stumbled on through the weary end of the <name type="TIME">night</name>, and until the coming of <name type="DATE">another <name type="DATE">day</name></name> of fear they walked in silence with bowed heads, seeing nothing, and hea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng nothing but the wind hissing in their ears.</p>
</chapter><chapter num="3"><heading>Chapter 3</heading>
<p>The <name type="ORG">Black</name> <name type="FAC">Gate</name> is Closed</p>
<p>Before the next <name type="DATE">day</name> <name type="TIME">dawn</name>ed their journey to <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> was over. The <name type="PERSON">mar</name>shes and the desert were behind them. Before them, darkling against a pallid sky, the great mountains reared their threa<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing heads.</p>
<p>Upon the west of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ched the gloomy range of <name type="FAC">Ephel D�ath</name>, the <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s of <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>, and upon the north the broken peaks and barren <name type="GPE">ri</name>dges of <name type="ORG">Ered Lithui</name>, grey as ash. But as these ranges approached <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> another, being indeed but parts of <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> great wall about the mournful plains of <name type="PERSON">Lithlad</name> and of <name type="PERSON">Gorgoroth</name>, and the bitter inland sea of N�rnen amidmost, they swung out long arms northward; and between these arms there was a deep defile. This was <name type="PERSON">Ci<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name> Gorgor, <name type="WORK_OF_ART">the Haunted Pass</name>, the entrance to the land of the Enemy. High cliffs lowered upon either side, and thrust forward from its mouth were <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> sheer hills, black-b<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>d and bare. Upon them stood the Teeth of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>, <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> towers strong and tall. In <name type="DATE">day</name>s long past they were built by the <name type="ORG">Men</name> of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> in their p<name type="GPE">ri</name>de and power, after the overthrow of <name type="ORG">Sauron</name> and his flight, lest he should seek to return to his old realm. But the strength of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> failed, and men slept, and for <name type="DATE">long <name type="DATE">year</name>s</name> the towers stood empty. Then <name type="ORG">Sauron</name> returned. Now the watch-towers, which had fallen into decay, were repaired, and filled with arms, and gar<name type="GPE">ri</name>s<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>d with ceaseless vigilance. Stony-faced they were, with dark window-holes sta<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng north and east and west, and each window was full of sleepless eyes.</p>
<p>Across the mouth of the pass, from cliff to cliff, the Dark <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd had built a rampart of st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. In it there was a single gate of iron, and upon its battlement sentinels paced unceasingly. Beneath the hills on either side the rock was bored into <name type="CARDINAL">a <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name></name> caves and maggot-holes: there a host of orcs lurked, ready at a signal to issue forth like black ants going to war. N<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> could pass the Teeth of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> and not feel their bite, unless they were summ<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>d by <name type="ORG">Sauron</name>, or knew the <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret passwords that would open the <name type="GPE">Morannon</name>, the black gate of his land.</p>
<p>The <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> hobbits gazed at the towers and the wall in despair. Even from a distance they could see in the dim light the movement of the black guards upon the wall, and the patrols before the gate. They lay now pee<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng over the edge of a rocky hollow beneath the out-stretched shadow of the northmost buttress of <name type="FAC">Ephel D�ath</name>. Winging the heavy air in a straight flight a crow, maybe, would have flown but a furlong from their hiding-place to the black summit of the nearer tower. A faint smoke curled above it, as if fire smouldered in the hill beneath.</p>
<p>Day came, and <name type="DATE">the fall</name>ow sun blinked over the lifeless <name type="GPE">ri</name>dges of <name type="ORG">Ered Lithui</name>. Then suddenly the cry of brazen-throated trumpets was heard: from the watch-towers they blared, and far away from hidden holds and outposts in the hills came answe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng calls; and further still, remote but deep and ominous, there echoed in the hollow land beyond the mighty horns and drums of <name type="FAC">Barad-d</name>�r. Another dreadful <name type="DATE">day</name> of fear and toil had come to <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>; and the <name type="TIME">night</name>-guards were summ<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>d to their dungeons and deep halls, and the <name type="DATE">day</name>-guards, evil-eyed and fell, were <name type="PERSON">mar</name><name type="PERSON">chin</name>g to their posts. Steel gleamed dimly on the battlement.</p>
<p><name type="ORG">`Well</name>, here we are! ' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <name type="PERSON">`He</name>re's the <name type="FAC">Gate</name>, and it looks to me as if that's about as far as we are ever going to get. My word, but the <name type="PERSON">Gaffer</name> would have a thing or <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> to say, if he saw me now! Of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> said I'd come to a bad end, if I didn't watch my step, he did. But now I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t suppose I'll ever see the old fellow again. He'll miss his chance of _I told'ee so, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>_: more's the pity. He could go on telling me as long as he'd got breath, if only I could see his old face again. But I'd have to get a wash <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>, or he wouldn't know me.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`I</name> suppose it's no good asking "what way do we go now?" We can't go no further-unless we <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t to ask the orcs for a lift.'</p>
<p>`No, no! ' said <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>. `No use. We can't go further. Sm�agol said so. He said: we'll go to the <name type="FAC">Gate</name>, and then we'll see. And we do see. O yes. my precious, we do see. Sm�agol knew hobbits could not go this way. O yes. Sm�agol knew '</p>
<p>'Then what the plague did you b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng us here for? ' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, not feeling in the mood to be just or reasonable.</p>
<p>`Master said so. Master says: B<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng us to the <name type="FAC">Gate</name>. So good Sm�agol does so. Master said so, wise master.'</p>
<p><q>'I did,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. His face was g<name type="GPE">ri</name>m and set. but resolute. He was filthy, haggard, and pinched with wea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ness, but he cowered no longer, and his eyes were clear. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> said so, because I purpose to enter <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>, and I know no other way. Therefore I shall go this way. I do not ask any<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> to go with me.'</p>
<p>`No, no, master! ' wailed <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>; pawing at him, and seeming in great distress. `No use that way! No use! <name type="PERSON">Don</name>'t take the Precious to Him! He'll eat us all, if He gets it, eat all the world. Keep it, nice master, and be kind to Sm�agol. <name type="PERSON">Don</name>'t let Him have it. Or go away. go to nice places, and give it back to little Sm�agol. Yes, yes, master: give it back, eh? Sm�agol will keep it safe; he will do lots of good, especially to nice hobbits. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbits go home. <name type="PERSON">Don</name>'t go to the <name type="FAC">Gate</name>! '</p>
<p><q>'I am commanded to go to the land of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>, and therefore I shall go,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'If there is only <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> way, then I must take it. What comes after must come.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> said nothing. The look on <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s face was enough for him he knew that words of his were useless. And after all he never had any real hope in the affair from the beginning; but being a cheerful hobbit he had not needed hope, as long as despair could be postp<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>d. Now they were come to the bitter end. But he had stuck to his master all the way; that was what he had chiefly come for, and he would still stick to him. His master would not go to <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> would go with him-and at any rate they would get <name type="GPE">ri</name>d of <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>, however, did not in<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>d to be got <name type="GPE">ri</name>d of, yet. He knelt at <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s feet, w<name type="GPE">ri</name>nging his hands and squeaking. 'Not this way, master! ' he pleaded, 'There is another way. O yes indeed there is. Another way. darker, more difficult to find, more <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret. But Sm�agol knows it. Let Sm�agol show you! '</p>
<p>'Another way! ' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> doubtfully, looking down at <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> with sear<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g eyes.</p>
<p>'<name type="PERSON">Yess</name>! <name type="PERSON">Yess</name> indeed! There _was_ another way. Sm�agol found it. Let's go and see if it's still there! '</p>
<p>`You have not spoken of this before.'</p>
<p>`No. Master did not ask. Master did not say what he meant to do. He does not tell poor Sm�agol. He says: Sm�agol, take me to the <name type="FAC">Gate</name> � and then good bye! Sm�agol can run away and be good. But now he says: I purpose to enter <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> this way. So Sm�agol is very afraid. He does not <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t to lose nice master. And he promised, master made him promise, to save the Precious. But master is going to take it to Him, straight to the <name type="ORG">Black</name> Hand, if master will go this way. So Sm�agol must save them both, and he thinks of another way that there was, once upon a time. <name type="GPE">Nice</name> master. Sm�agol very good, always helps.'</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> frowned. If he could have bored holes in <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> with his eyes, he would have <name type="PERSON">don</name>e. His mind was full of doubt. To all appearances <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> was genuinely distressed and anxious to help <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. But <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, remembe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng the overheard debate, found it hard to believe that the long submerged Sm�agol had come out on top: that voice at any rate had not had the last word in the debate. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>'s guess was that the Sm�agol and <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> halves (or what in his own mind he called <name type="ORG">Slinker</name> and <name type="PRODUCT">Stinker</name>) had made a truce and a temporary alliance: neither <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ted the Enemy to get the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>; both wished to keep <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> from capture, and under their eye, as long as possible � at any rate as long as <name type="PRODUCT">Stinker</name> still had a chance of laying hands on his 'Precious'. Whether there really was another way into <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> doubted.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`A</name>nd it's a good thing neither <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> of the old villain <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t know what master means to do,<q>' he thought. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>f he knew that Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> is trying to put an end to his Precious for good and all, there'd be trouble pretty quick, I bet. Anyhow old <name type="PRODUCT">Stinker</name> is so f<name type="GPE">ri</name>gh<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed of the Enemy � and he's under orders of some kind from him, or was � that he'd give us away rather than be caught helping us; and rather than let his Precious be melted, maybe. At least that's my idea. And I hope the master will think it out carefully. He's as wise as any, but he's soft<name type="PERSON">-he</name>arted, that's what he is. It's beyond any <name type="PERSON">Gamgee</name> to guess what he'll do next.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> did not answer <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> at once. While these doubts were passing through <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>'s slow but shrewd mind, he stood gazing out towards the dark cliff of <name type="PERSON">Ci<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name> Gorgor. The hollow in which they had taken refuge was delved in the side of a low hill, at some little h<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name> above a long trenchlike valley that lay between it and the outer buttresses of the mountains. In the midst of the valley stood the black foundations of the western watch-tower. By <name type="TIME">morning</name>-light the roads that converged upon the <name type="FAC">Gate</name> of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> could now be clearly seen, pale and dusty; <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> winding back northwards; another dwindling eastwards into the mists that clung <name type="QUANTITY">about the feet</name> of <name type="ORG">Ered Lithui</name>; and <name type="CARDINAL">a <name type="ORDINAL">third</name></name> that ran towards him. As it bent sharply round the tower, it entered a narrow defile and passed not far below the hollow where he stood. <name type="LOC">West</name>ward, to his <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght, it turned, skirting the shoulders of the mountains, and went off southwards into the deep shadows that mantled all the western sides of <name type="FAC">Ephel D�ath</name>; beyond his sight it journeyed on into the narrow land between the mountains and the <name type="LOC">Great <name type="LOC">River</name></name>.</p>
<p>As he gazed <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> became aware that there was a great stir and movement on the plain. It seemed as if whole armies were on the <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ch, though for the most part they were hidden by the <name type="GPE">reek</name>s and fumes d<name type="GPE">ri</name>fting from the <name type="PERSON">fen</name>s and wastes beyond. But here and there he caught the gleam of spears and helmets; and over the levels beside the roads horsemen could be seen <name type="GPE">ri</name>ding in many companies. He remembered his vision from afar upon <name type="PERSON">Amon <name type="ORG">Hen</name></name>, so few <name type="DATE">day</name>s before, though now it seemed <name type="DATE">many <name type="DATE">year</name>s</name> ago. Then he knew that the hope that had for <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> wild moment stirred in his heart was vain. The trumpets had not rung in challenge but in greeting. This was no assault upon the Dark <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd by the men of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>, <name type="GPE">ri</name>sen like avenging ghosts from the graves of valour long passed away. These were <name type="ORG">Men</name> of other race, out of the wide <name type="LOC">East</name>lands, gathe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng to the summons of their <name type="FAC">Overlord</name>; armies that had encamped before his <name type="FAC">Gate</name> by <name type="TIME">night</name> and now <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ched in to swell his mounting power. As if suddenly made fully aware of the pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>l of their position, al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, in the growing light of <name type="DATE">day</name>, so near to this vast menace, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> quickly drew his frail grey hood close upon his head, and stepped down into the <name type="ORG">dell</name>. Then he turned to <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>.</p>
<p>`Sm�agol,<q>' he said, <name type="PERSON">`I</name> will trust you once more. Indeed it seems that I must do so, and that it is my fate to receive help from you. where I least looked for it, and your fate to help me whom you long pursued with evil purpose. So far you have deserved well of me and have kept your promise truly. Truly, I say and mean,'</q> he added with a glance at <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, <q>'for twice now we have been in your power, and you have <name type="PERSON">don</name>e no harm to us. Nor have you t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed to take from me what you once sought. <name type="DATE">May</name> the <name type="ORDINAL">third</name> time prove the best! But I warn you, Sm�agol, you are in danger.'</q></p>
<p>`Yes, yes, master! <q>' said <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>. `Dreadful danger! Sm�agol's b<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s shake to think of it. but he doesn't run away. He must help nice master.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I did not mean the danger that we all share,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'I mean a danger to yourself al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. You swore a promise by what you call the Precious. Remember that! It will hold you to it; but it will seek a way to twist it to your own undoing. Already you are being twisted. You revealed yourself to me just now, foolishly_. Give it back to Sm�agol_ you said. Do not say that again! Do not let that thought grow in you! You will never get it back. But the desire of it may betray you to a bitter end. You will never get it back. In the last need, Sm�agol, I should put on the Precious; and the Precious mastered you <name type="DATE">long ago</name>. If I, wea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng it, were to command you, you would obey, even if it were to leap from a precipice or to cast yourself into the fire. And such would be my command. So have a care, Sm�agol!'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> looked at his master with approval, but also with surp<name type="GPE">ri</name>se: there was a look in his face and a t<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> in his voice that he had not known before. It had always been a notion of his that the kindness of dear Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> was of such a high degree that it must imply a fair measure of blindness. Of course, he also firmly held the incompatible belief that Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> was the wisest person in the world (with the possible exception of Old Mr. <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> and of <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>). <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> in his own way, and with much more excuse as his acquaintance was much b<name type="GPE">ri</name>efer, may have _made a similar mistake, confusing kindness and blindness. At any rate this speech abashed and ter<name type="GPE">ri</name>fied him. He grovelled on the ground and could speak no clear words but _nice master_.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> waited patiently for a while, then he spoke again less sternly. `Come now, <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> or Sm�agol if you wish, tell me of this other way, and show me, if you can, what hope there is in it, enough to justify me in turning aside from my plain path. I am in haste.'</p>
<p>But <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> was in a pitiable state, and <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s threat had quite unnerved him. It was not easy to get any clear account out of him, amid his mumblings and squeakings, and the frequent interruptions in which he crawled on the floor and begged them both to be kind to `poor little Sm�agol'. After a while he grew a little calmer, and <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> gathered bit by bit that, if a traveller followed the road that turned west of <name type="FAC">Ephel D�ath</name>, he would come in time to a crossing in a circle of dark trees. On the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght a road went down to <name type="NORP">Osgiliath</name> and the b<name type="GPE">ri</name>dges of the <name type="GPE">Anduin</name>; in the middle the road went on southwards.</p>
<p>`On, on, on,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>. `We never went that way, but they say it goes <name type="CARDINAL">a <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name></name> leagues, until you can see <name type="EVENT">the Great Water</name> that is never still. There are lots of fishes there, and big birds eat fishes: nice birds: but we never went there, alas no! we never had a chance. And further still there are more lands, they say, but the <name type="ORG">Yellow</name> Face is very hot there, and there are seldom any clouds, and the men are fierce and have dark faces. We do not <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t to see that land.'</q></p>
<p>`No! ' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. `But do not <name type="PERSON">wan</name>der from your road. What of the <name type="ORDINAL">third</name> turning? '</p>
<p>`O yes, O yes, there is <name type="CARDINAL">a <name type="ORDINAL">third</name></name> way,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>. `That is the road to the left. At once it begins to climb up, up, winding and climbing back towards the tall shadows. When it turns round the black rock, you'll see it. suddenly you'll see it above you, and you'll <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t to hide.'</q></p>
<p>`See it, see it? What will you see? '</p>
<p>`The old fortress, very old, very hor<name type="GPE">ri</name>ble now. We used to hear tales from the <name type="LOC">South</name>, when Sm�agol was young, <name type="DATE">long ago</name>. O yes. we used to tell lots of tales in the <name type="TIME">evening</name>, sitting by the banks of the <name type="LOC">Great <name type="LOC">River</name></name>, in the willow-lands, when the <name type="LOC">River</name> was younger too, _<name type="PERSON">gollum</name>_, _<name type="PERSON">gollum</name>_.' He began to weep and mutter. The hobbits waited patiently.</p>
<p>`Tales out of the <name type="LOC">South</name>,<q>' <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> went on again, `about the tall <name type="ORG">Men</name> with the shining eyes, and their houses like hills of st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, and the silver crown of their <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g and his White <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>: wonderful tales. They built very tall towers, and <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> they raised was silver-white, and in it there was a st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> like the <name type="PERSON">Moon</name>, and round it were great white walls. O yes, there were many tales about the <name type="FAC">Tower</name> of the <name type="PERSON">Moon</name>.'</q></p>
<p>`That would be Minas <name type="ORG">Ithil</name> that <name type="ORG">Isildur</name> the son of <name type="PERSON">Elen</name>dil built <q>' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>t was <name type="ORG">Isildur</name> who cut off the finger of the Enemy.'</q></p>
<p>`Yes, He has only <name type="CARDINAL">four</name> on the <name type="ORG">Black</name> Hand, but they are enough,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> shudde<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng. 'And He hated <name type="ORG">Isildur</name>'s city.'</q></p>
<p>'What does he not hate? ' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. 'But what has the <name type="FAC">Tower</name> of the <name type="PERSON">Moon</name> to do with us? '</p>
<p><q>'Well, master, there it was and there it is: the tall tower and the white houses and the wall; but not nice now, not beautiful. He conquered it <name type="DATE">long ago</name>. It is a very ter<name type="GPE">ri</name>ble place now. <name type="ORG">Travellers</name> shiver when they see it, they creep out of sight, they avoid its shadow. But master will have to go that way. That is the only other way, For the mountains are lower there, and the old road goes up and up, until it reaches a dark pass at the top, and then it goes down, down, again � to <name type="PERSON">Gorgoroth</name>.'</q> His voice sank to a whisper and he shuddered.</p>
<p>`But how will that help us? ' asked <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. `Surely the Enemy knows all about his own mountains, and that road will be guarded as close as this? The tower isn't empty, is it? '</p>
<p>`O no, not empty! <q>' whispered <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>t seems empty, but it isn't, O no! Very dreadful things live there. <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s. yes always <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s; but worse things, worse things live there too. The road climbs <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght under the shadow of the walls and passes the gate. Nothing moves on the road that they <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t know about. The things inside know: the Silent <name type="PERSON">Watcher</name>s.'</q></p>
<p>`So that's your advice is it,' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, 'that we should go another long <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ch south, to find ourselves in the same fix or a worse <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, when we get there, if we ever do? '</p>
<p>`No, no indeed,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>. `<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbits must see, must try to understand. He does not expect attack that way. His <name type="PRODUCT">Eye</name> is all round, but it at<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ds more to some places than to others. He can't see everything all at once, not yet. You see, He has conquered all the country west of the <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>y <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s down to the <name type="LOC">River</name>, and He holds the b<name type="GPE">ri</name>dges now. He thinks no <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> can come to the <name type="PERSON">Moon</name>tower without fighting big battle at the b<name type="GPE">ri</name>dges, or getting lots of boats which they cannot hide and He will know about.'</q></p>
<p><q>'You seem to know a lot about what He's doing and thinking,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. `Have you been talking to Him lately? Or just hobnobbing with <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s? '</p>
<p><q>'Not nice hobbit, not sensible,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>, giving <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> an angry glance and turning to <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'Sm�agol has talked to <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s, yes of course, before he met master, and to many peoples: he has walked very far. And what he says now many peoples are saying. It's here in the <name type="LOC">North</name> that the big danger is for Him, and for us. He will come out of the <name type="ORG">Black</name> <name type="FAC">Gate</name> <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> <name type="DATE">day</name>, <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> <name type="DATE">day</name> soon. That is the only way big armies can come. But away down west He is not afraid, and there are the Silent <name type="PERSON">Watcher</name>s.'</q></p>
<p>`Just so! <q>' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, not to be put off. <name type="PERSON">`A</name>nd so we are to walk up and knock at their gate and ask if we're on the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght road for <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>? Or are they too silent to answer? It's not. sense. We might as well do it here, and save ourselves a long tramp.'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Don</name>'t make jokes about it,'</q> hissed <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>t isn't funny, O no! Not amusing. It's nut sense to try and get into <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> at all. But if master says _I must go_ or _I will go_, then he must try some way. But he must not go to the ter<name type="GPE">ri</name>ble city, O no, of course not. That is where Sm�agol helps. nice Sm�agol. though no <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> tells him what it is all about. Sm�agol helps again. He found it. He knows it.'</p>
<p>'What did you find? ' asked <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> crouched down and his voice sank to a whisper again. <q>'A little path leading up into the mountains: and then a stair, a narrow stair, O yes, very long and narrow. And then more stairs. And then' � his voice sank even lower � `a tunnel, a dark tunnel; and at last a little cleft, and a path high above the main pass. It was that way that Sm�agol got out of the darkness. But it was <name type="DATE">year</name>s ago. The path may have vanished now; but perhaps not, perhaps not.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`I</name> <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t like the sound of it at all,' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. `Sounds too easy at any rate in the telling. If that path is still there, it'll be guarded too. Wasn't it guarded, <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>? ' As he said this, he caught or fancied he caught a green gleam in <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>'s eye. <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> muttered but did not reply.</p>
<p><q>'Is it not guarded? ' asked <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> sternly. <name type="PERSON">`A</name>nd did you _escape_ out of the darkness, Sm�agol? Were you not rather permitted to depart upon an errand? That at least is w hat <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> thought, who found you by the Dead <name type="LOC">Marshes</name> <name type="DATE">some <name type="DATE">year</name>s</name> ago.'</q></p>
<p><q>'It's a lie! ' hissed <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>, and an evil light came into his eyes at the naming of <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <name type="PERSON">`He</name> lied on me, yes he did. I did escape, all by my poor self. Indeed I was told to seek for the Precious; and I have searched and searched, of course I have. But not for the <name type="ORG">Black</name> <name type="CARDINAL">One</name>. The Precious was ours, it was mine I tell you. I did escape.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> felt a strange certainty that in this matter <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> was for once not so far from the truth as might be suspected; that he had somehow found a way out of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>, and at least believed that it was by his own cunning. For <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> thing, he noted that <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> used I, and that seemed usually to be a sign, on its rare appearances. that some remnants of old truth and since<name type="GPE">ri</name>ty were for the moment on top. But even if <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> could be trusted on this point, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> did not forget the wiles of the Enemy. The 'escape' may have been allowed or arranged, and well known in the Dark <name type="FAC">Tower</name>. And in any case <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> was plainly keeping a good deal back.</p>
<p><q>'I ask you again,'</q> he said: `is not this <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret way guarded? '</p>
<p>But the name of <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> had put <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> into a sullen mood. He had all the injured air of a liar suspected when for once he has told the truth. or part of it. He did not answer.</p>
<p>'Is it not guarded? ' <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> repeated.</p>
<p>`Yes, yes, perhaps. No safe places in this country,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> sulkily. 'No safe places. But master must try it or go home. . No other way.'</q> They could not get him to say more. The name of the pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>lous place and the high pass he could not tell, or would not.</p>
<p>Its name was <name type="PERSON">Ci<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name> Ungol, a name of dreadful rumour. <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> could perhaps have told them that name and its significance: <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> would have warned them. But they were al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, and <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> was far away, and <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> stood amid the ruin of <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard and strove with <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>, delayed by treason. Yet even as he spoke his last words to <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>, and the _palant�r_ crashed in fire upon the steps of <name type="PERSON">Orthanc</name>. his thought was ever upon <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>wise, over the long leagues his mind sought for them in hope and pity.</p>
<p><name type="DATE">May</name>be <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> felt it, not knowing it, as he had upon <name type="PERSON">Amon <name type="ORG">Hen</name></name>, even though he believed that <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> was g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> for ever into the shadow in <name type="GPE">Mo<name type="GPE">ri</name>a</name> far away. He sat upon the ground for a long while, silent, his head bowed, st<name type="GPE">ri</name>ving to recall all that <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> had said to him. But for this choice he could recall no counsel. Indeed <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>'s guidance had been taken from them too soon, too soon, while the Dark Land was still very far away. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w they should enter it at the last <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> had not said. Perhaps he could not say. Into the stronghold of the Enemy in the <name type="LOC">North</name>, into <name type="PERSON">Dol Guldur</name>, he had once ventured. But into <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>, to the <name type="LOC">Mountain</name> of <name type="ORG">Fire</name> and to <name type="FAC">Barad-d</name>�r, since the Dark <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd rose in power again, had he ever journeyed there? <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> did not think so. And here he was a little <name type="CARDINAL">half</name>ling from the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>, a simple hobbit of the quiet countryside expected to find a way where the great <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s could not go, or dared not go. It was an evil fate. But he had taken it on himself in his own sitting-room in the far-off sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng of another <name type="DATE">year</name>, so remote now that it was like a chapter in a story of the world's youth, when the <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>s of Silver and Gold were still in bloom. This was an evil choice. Which way should he choose? And if both led to terror and death, what good lay in choice?</p>
<p><name type="DATE">The <name type="DATE">day</name></name> drew on. A deep silence fell upon the little grey hollow where they lay, so near to the borders of the land of fear: a silence that could be felt, as if it were a thick veil that cut them off from all the world about them. Above them was a dome of pale sky barred with fleeting smoke, but it seemed high and far away. as if seen through great deeps of air heavy with brooding thought.</p>
<p>Not even an eagle poised against the sun would have <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ked the hobbits sitting there, under the w<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name> of doom, silent, : not moving, shrouded in their thin <name type="PERSON">grey cloaks</name>. For a moment he might have paused to consider <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>, a tiny figure sprawling on the ground: there perhaps lay the famished skeleton of some child of <name type="ORG">Men</name>, its ragged garment still clinging to it, its long arms and legs almost b<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>-white and b<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>-thin: no flesh worth a peck.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s head was bowed over his knees, but <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> leaned back, with hands behind his head, sta<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng out of his hood at the empty sky. At least for a long while it was empty. Then presently <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> thought he saw a dark bird-like figure wheel into the circle of his sight, and hover, and then wheel away again. <name type="CARDINAL">Two</name> more followed, and then a <name type="CARDINAL">four</name>th. They were very small to look at, yet he knew, somehow, that they were huge, with a vast stretch of pinion, flying at a great h<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name>. He covered his eyes and bent forward, cowe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng. The same warning fear was on him as he had felt in the presence of the <name type="ORG">Black</name> <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s, the helpless horror that had come with the cry in the wind and the shadow on the moon, though now it was not so crushing or compelling: the menace was more remote. But menace it was. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> felt it too. His thought was broken. He stirred and shivered, but he did not look up. <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> huddled himself together like a cornered spider. The winged shapes wheeled, and stooped swiftly down, speeding back to <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> took a deep breath. `The <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s are about again, up in the air,' he said in a hoarse whisper. 'I saw them. Do you think they could see us? They were very high up. And if they are <name type="ORG">Black</name> <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s same as before, then they can't see much by <name type="DATE">day</name>light, can they? '</p>
<p><q>'No, perhaps not,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. `But their <name type="PERSON">steed</name>s could see. And these winged creatures that they <name type="GPE">ri</name>de on now, they can probably see more than any other creature. They are like great car<name type="GPE">ri</name>on birds. They are looking for something: the Enemy is on the watch, I fear.'</p>
<p>The feeling of dread passed, but the enfolding silence was broken. For some time they had been cut off from the world, as if in an invisible island; now they were laid bare again, pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>l had returned. But still <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> did not speak to <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> or make his choice. His eyes were closed, as if he were dreaming, or looking inward into his heart and memory. At last he stirred and stood up, and it seemed that he was about to speak and to decide. But `hark!<q>' he said. `What is that?'</q></p>
<p>A new fear was upon them. They heard singing and hoarse shouting. At <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> it seemed a long way off, but it drew nearer: it was coming towards them. It leaped into all their minds that the <name type="ORG">Black</name> Wings had spied them and had sent armed soldiers to seize them: no speed seemed too great for these ter<name type="GPE">ri</name>ble servants of <name type="ORG">Sauron</name>. They crouched, lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing. The voices and the clink of weapons and harness were very close. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> loosened their small swords in their sheaths. Flight was impossible.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> rose slowly and crawled in<name type="ORG">sec</name>t-like to the lip of the hollow. Very cautiously he raised himself inch by inch, until he could peer over it <name type="CARDINAL">between <name type="CARDINAL">two</name></name> broken points of st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. He remained there without moving for some time, making no sound. Presently the voices began to recede again, and then they slowly faded away. <name type="LOC">Far</name> off a horn blew on the ramparts of the <name type="GPE">Morannon</name>. Then quietly <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> drew back and slipped down into the hollow.</p>
<p><q>'More <name type="ORG">Men</name> going to <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>,'</q> he said in a low voice. `Dark faces. We have not seen <name type="ORG">Men</name> like these before, no, Sm�agol has not. They are fierce. They have black eyes, and long black <name type="PERSON">hai</name>r, and gold <name type="GPE">ri</name>ngs in their ears; yes, lots of beautiful gold. And some have red paint on their cheeks, and red cloaks; and their flags are red, and the tips of their spears; and they have round shields, yellow and black with big spikes. Not nice; very cruel wicked <name type="ORG">Men</name> they look. Almost as bad as <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s, and much bigger. Sm�agol thinks they have come out of the <name type="LOC">South</name> beyond the <name type="LOC">Great <name type="LOC">River</name></name>'s end: they came up that road. They have passed on to the <name type="ORG">Black</name> <name type="FAC">Gate</name>; but more may follow. Always more people coming to <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>. <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> <name type="DATE">day</name> all the peoples will be inside.'</p>
<p>`Were there any oliphaunts?' asked <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, forgetting his fear in his eagerness for news of strange places.</p>
<p>`No, no oliphaunts. What are oliphaunts? ' said <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> stood up, putting his hands behind his back (as he always did when 'speaking poetry'), and began:</p>
<p><name type="ORG">Grey</name> as a mouse,</p>
<p>Big as a house.</p>
<p>Nose like a snake,</p>
<p>I make the <name type="LOC">earth</name> shake,</p>
<p>As I tramp through the grass;</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Tree</name>s crack as I pass.</p>
<p>With horns in my mouth</p>
<p>I walk in the <name type="LOC">South</name>,</p>
<p>Flapping big ears.</p>
<p>Beyond count of <name type="DATE">year</name>s</p>
<p>I stump round and round,</p>
<p>Never lie on the ground,</p>
<p>Not even to die.</p>
<p><name type="ORG">Oliphaunt</name> am I,</p>
<p>Biggest of all,</p>
<p>Huge, old, and tall.</p>
<p>If ever you'd met me</p>
<p>You wouldn't forget me.</p>
<p>If you never do,</p>
<p>You won't think I'm true;</p>
<p>But old <name type="ORG">Oliphaunt</name> am I,</p>
<p>And I never lie.</p>
<p><q>'That,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, when he had finished reciting, `that's a rhyme we have in the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>. Nonsense maybe, and maybe not. But we have our tales too, and news out of the <name type="LOC">South</name>, you know. In the old <name type="DATE">day</name>s hobbits used to go on their travels now and again. Not that many ever came back, and not that all they said was believed: _news from <name type="PERSON">Bree</name>_, and not _sure as <name type="LOC">Shire</name>talk_, as the sayings go. But I've heard tales of the big folk down away in the <name type="ORG">Sun</name>lands. <name type="GPE">Swertings</name> we call <q>'em in our tales; and they <name type="GPE">ri</name>de on oliphaunts, 'tis said, when they fight. They put houses and towers on the oliphauntses backs and all, and the oliphaunts throw rocks and trees at <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> another. So when you said "<name type="ORG">Men</name> out of the <name type="LOC">South</name>, all in red and gold;" I said "were there any oliphaunts? " For if there was, I was going to take a look, <name type="GPE">ri</name>sk or no. But now I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t suppose I'll ever see an oliphaunt. <name type="DATE">May</name>be there ain't no such a beast.'</q> He sighed.</p>
<p>`No, no oliphaunts,' said <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> again. 'Sm�agol has not heard of them. He does not <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t to see them. He does not <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t them to be. Sm�agol <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ts to go away from here and hide somewhere safer. Sm�agol <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ts master to go. <name type="GPE">Nice</name> master, won't he come with Sm�agol? '</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> stood up. He had laughed in the midst of all his cares when <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> trotted out the old fireside rhyme of _<name type="ORG">Oliphaunt</name>_, and the laugh had released him from hesitation. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> wish we had <name type="CARDINAL">a thousand</name> oliphaunts with <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> on a white <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> at their head,<q>' he said. `Then we'd break a way into this evil land, perhaps. But we've not; just our own tired legs, that's all. Well, Sm�agol, the <name type="ORDINAL">third</name> turn may turn the best. I will come with you.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Good master, wise master, nice master!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> in delight, patting <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s knees. <name type="ORG">`Go</name>od master! Then rest now, nice hobbits, under the shadow of the st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s, close under the st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s! Rest and lie quiet, till the <name type="ORG">Yellow</name> Face goes away. Then we can go quickly. Soft and quick as shadows we must be!'</p>
</chapter><chapter num="<name type="CARDINAL">4</name>"><heading>Chapter <name type="CARDINAL">4</name></heading>
<p>Of Herbs and Stewed Rabbit</p>
<p>For the few <name type="TIME">hour</name>s of <name type="DATE">day</name>light that were left they rested, shifting into the shade as the sun moved, until at last the shadow of the western <name type="GPE">ri</name>m of their <name type="ORG">dell</name> grew long, and darkness filled all the hollow. Then they ate a little, and drank spa<name type="GPE">ri</name>ngly. <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> ate nothing, but he accepted water gladly.</p>
<p>`Soon get more now,<q>' he said, licking his lips. <name type="ORG">`Go</name>od water runs down in streams to the <name type="LOC">Great <name type="LOC">River</name></name>, nice water in the lands we are going to. Sm�agol will get food there too, perhaps. He's very hungry, yes, _<name type="PERSON">gollum</name>_!'</q> He set his <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> large flat hands on his shrunken belly, and a pale green light came into his eyes.</p>
<p><name type="TIME">The <name type="TIME">dusk</name></name> was deep when at length they set out, creeping over the westward <name type="GPE">ri</name>m of the <name type="ORG">dell</name>, and fading like ghosts into the broken country on the borders of the road: The moon was now <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> <name type="TIME">night</name>s from the full, but it did not climb over the mountains until nearly <name type="TIME">mid<name type="TIME">night</name></name>, and the <name type="TIME">early <name type="TIME">night</name></name> was very dark. A single red light burned high up in the <name type="FAC">Tower</name>s of the Teeth, but otherwise no sign could be seen or heard of the sleepless watch on the <name type="GPE">Morannon</name>.</p>
<p>For many miles the red eye seemed to stare at them as they fled, stumbling through a barren stony country. They did not dare to take the road, but they kept it on their left, following its line as well as they could at a little distance. At last, when <name type="TIME">night</name> was growing old and they were already weary, for they had taken only <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> short rest, the eye dwindled to a small fiery point and then vanished: they had turned the dark northern shoulder of the lower mountains and were heading southwards.</p>
<p>With hearts strangely ligh<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed they now rested again, but not for long. They were not going quick enough for <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>. By his reckoning it was <name type="CARDINAL">nearly <name type="CARDINAL">thirty</name></name> leagues from the <name type="GPE">Morannon</name> to the cross-roads above <name type="NORP">Osgiliath</name>, and he hoped to cover that distance in <name type="CARDINAL">four</name> journeys. So soon they struggled on once more, until the <name type="TIME">dawn</name> began to spread slowly in the wide grey solitude. They had then walked <name type="CARDINAL">almost <name type="CARDINAL">eight</name></name> leagues; and the hobbits could not have g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> any further, even if they had dared.</p>
<p>The growing light revealed to them a land already, less barren and ruinous. The mountains still loomed up ominously on their left, but near at hand they could see the southward road, now bea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng away from the black roots of the hills and slanting westwards. Beyond it were slopes covered with sombre trees like dark clouds. but all about them lay a tumbled heathland, grown with ling and broom and cornel, and other shrubs that they did not know. Here and there they saw knots of tall pine-trees. The hearts of the hobbits rose again a little in spite of wea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ness: the air was fresh and fragrant, and it reminded them of the uplands of the <name type="LOC">North</name>farthing far away. It seemed good to be rep<name type="GPE">ri</name>eved, to walk in a land that had only been for <name type="DATE">a few <name type="DATE">year</name>s</name> under the dominion of the Dark <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd and was not yet fallen wholly into decay. But they did not forget their danger, nor the <name type="ORG">Black</name> <name type="FAC">Gate</name> that was still all too near, hidden though it was behind the gloomy h<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name>s. They looked about for a hiding-place where they could shelter from evil eyes while the light lasted.</p>
<p><name type="DATE">The <name type="DATE">day</name></name> passed uneasily. They lay deep in the heather and counted out the slow <name type="TIME">hour</name>s, in which there seemed little change; for they were still under the shadows of the <name type="FAC">Ephel D�ath</name>, and the sun was veiled. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> slept at times, deeply and peacefully, either trusting <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> or too tired to trouble about him; but <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> found it difficult to do more than doze, even when <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> was plainly fast asleep, whiffling and twit<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g in his <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret dreams. Hunger, perhaps, more than mistrust kept him wakeful: he had begun to long for a good homely meal, `something hot out of the pot'.</p>
<p>As soon as the land faded into a formless grey under <name type="TIME">coming <name type="TIME">night</name></name>, they started out again. In a little while <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> led them down on to the southward road; and after that they went on more quickly, though the danger was greater. Their ears were strained for the sound of hoof or foot on the road ahead, or following them from behind; but the <name type="TIME">night</name> passed, and they heard no sound of walker or <name type="GPE">ri</name>der.</p>
<p>The road had been made in a long lost time: and for perhaps <name type="CARDINAL">thirty</name> miles below the <name type="GPE">Morannon</name> it had been newly repaired, but as it went south the wild encroached upon it. The handiwork of <name type="ORG">Men</name> of old could still be seen in its straight sure flight and level course: now and again it cut its way through hillside slopes, or leaped over a stream upon a wide shapely arch of endu<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng masonry; but at last all signs of st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>work faded, save for a broken pillar here and there, pee<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng out of <name type="PERSON">bush</name>es at the side, or old paving-st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s still lurking amid weeds and moss. <name type="PERSON">Heather</name> and trees and <name type="PERSON">bracken</name> scrambled down and overhung the banks, or sprawled out over the surface. It dwindled at last to a country cart-road little used; but it did not wind: it held on its own sure course and guided them by the swiftest way.</p>
<p>So they passed into the northern <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ches of that land that <name type="ORG">Men</name> once called <name type="ORG">Ithil</name>ien, a fair country of climbing woods and swift-falling streams. <name type="TIME">The <name type="TIME">night</name></name> became fine under star and round moon, and it seemed to the hobbits that the fragrance of the air grew as they went forward; and from the blowing and mutte<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng of <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> it seemed that he noticed it too, and did not relish it. At the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> signs of <name type="DATE">day</name> they halted again. They had come to the end of a long cutting, deep, and sheer-sided in the middle, by which the road clove its way through a stony <name type="GPE">ri</name>dge. Now they climbed up the westward bank and looked abroad.</p>
<p>Day was opening in the sky, and they saw that the mountains were now much further off, receding eastward in a long curve that was lost in the distance. Before them, as they turned west, gentle slopes ran down into dim hazes far below. All about them were small woods of resinous trees, fir and cedar and <name type="FAC">cypress</name>. and other kinds unknown in the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>, with wide glades among them; and everywhere there was a wealth of sweet-smelling herbs and shrubs. The long journey from <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name> had brought them far south of their own land, but not until now in this more sheltered region had the hobbits felt the change of clime. Here <name type="DATE">Sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng</name> was already busy about them: fronds pierced moss and mould, larches were green-fingered, small flowers were opening in the turf, birds were singing. <name type="ORG">Ithil</name>ien, the garden of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> now desolate kept still a dishevelled dryad loveliness.</p>
<p><name type="LOC">South</name> and west it looked towards the warm lower <name type="GPE">vale</name>s of <name type="GPE">Anduin</name>, shielded from the east by the <name type="FAC">Ephel D�ath</name> and yet not under the mountain-shadow, protected from the north by the <name type="ORG">Emyn Muil</name>, open to the southern airs and the moist winds from the <name type="LOC">Sea</name> far away. Many great trees grew there, planted <name type="DATE">long ago</name>, falling into un<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ded age amid a <name type="GPE">ri</name>ot of careless descendants; and groves and thickets there were of ta<name type="PERSON">mar</name>isk and pungent terebinth, of olive and of bay; and there were junipers and myrtles; and thymes that grew in <name type="PERSON">bush</name>es, or with their woody creeping stems mantled in deep tapest<name type="GPE">ri</name>es the hidden st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s; sages of many kinds putting forth blue flowers, or red, or pale green; and <name type="PERSON">mar</name>jorams and new-sprouting parsleys, and many herbs of forms and scents beyond the garden-lore of <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. The grots and rocky walls were already starred with <name type="ORG">saxifrages</name> and st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>crops. <name type="PERSON">P<name type="GPE">ri</name>meroles</name> and anem<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s were awake in the filbert-brakes; and asphodel and many lily-flowers nodded their <name type="CARDINAL">half</name>-opened heads in the grass: deep green grass beside the pools, where falling streams halted in cool hollows on their journey down to <name type="GPE">Anduin</name>.</p>
<p>The travellers turned their backs on the road and went downhill. As they walked, brushing their way through <name type="PERSON">bush</name> and herb, sweet odours rose about them. <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> coughed and retched; but the hobbits breathed deep, and suddenly <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> laughed, for heart's ease not for jest. They followed a stream that went quickly down before them. Presently it brought them to a small clear lake in a shallow <name type="ORG">dell</name>: it lay in the broken ruins of an ancient st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> basin, the <name type="PERSON">carven</name> <name type="GPE">ri</name>m of which was almost wholly covered with mosses and rose-brambles; i<name type="GPE">ri</name>s-swords stood in ranks about it. and water-lily leaves floated on its dark gently-<name type="GPE">ri</name>ppling surface; but it was deep and fresh, and spilled ever softly out over a stony lip at the far end.</p>
<p>Here they washed themselves and drank their fill at the in-falling freshet. Then they sought for a resting-place, and a hiding-place: for this land, fair-seeming still, was n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>theless now ter<name type="GPE">ri</name>tory of the Enemy. They had not come very far from the road, and yet even in so short a space they had seen scars of the old wars, and the newer wounds made by the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s and other foul servants of the Dark <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd: a pit of uncovered filth and refuse; trees hewn down <name type="PERSON">wan</name>tonly and left to die, with evil runes or the fell sign of the <name type="PRODUCT">Eye</name> cut in rude strokes on their bark.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> scrambling below the outfall of the lake. smelling and tou<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g the unfamiliar plants and trees, forgetful for the moment of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>, was reminded suddenly of their ever-present pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>l. He stumbled on a <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng still scorched by fire, and in the midst of it he found a pile of charred and broken b<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s and skulls. The swift growth of the wild with b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ar and eglantine and trailing clematis was already drawing a veil over this place of dreadful feast and slaughter; but it was not ancient. He hur<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed back to his companions, but he said nothing: the b<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s were best left in peace and not pawed and routed by <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>.</p>
<p>`Let's find a place to lie up in,<q>' he said. 'Not lower down. Higher up for me.'</q></p>
<p>A little way back above the lake they found a deep brown bed of <name type="DATE">last <name type="DATE">year</name></name>'s fern. Beyond it was a thicket of dark-leaved bay-trees climbing up a steep bank that was crowned with old cedars. Here they decided to rest and pass the <name type="DATE">day</name>, which already promised to be b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght and warm. <name type="DATE">A good <name type="DATE">day</name></name> for strolling on their way along the groves and glades of <name type="ORG">Ithil</name>ien; but though <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s may shun the sunlight. there were too many places here where they could lie hid and watch; and other evil eyes were abroad: <name type="ORG">Sauron</name> had many servants. <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>, in any case, would not move under the <name type="ORG">Yellow</name>. Face. Soon it would look over the dark <name type="GPE">ri</name>dges of the <name type="FAC">Ephel D�ath</name>, and he would faint and cower in the light and heat.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> had been giving earnest thought to food as they <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ched. Now that the despair of the impassable <name type="FAC">Gate</name> was behind him, he did not feel so inclined as his master to take no thought for their livelihood beyond the end of their errand; and anyway it seemed wiser to him to save the <name type="PERSON">waybread</name> of the <name type="ORG">Elves</name> for worse times ahead. <name type="CARDINAL">Six</name> <name type="DATE">day</name>s or more had passed since he reck<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>d that they had only a bare supply for <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> <name type="DATE">week</name>s.</p>
<p>'If we reach the <name type="ORG">Fire</name> in that time, we'll be lucky at this rate! ' he thought. <name type="PERSON">`A</name>nd we might be <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ting to get back. We might! '</p>
<p>Besides, at the end of a long <name type="TIME">night</name>-<name type="PERSON">mar</name>ch, and after bathing and d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nking, he felt even more hungry than usual. A supper, or a breakfast, by the fire in the old kitchen at <name type="ORG">Bagshot Row</name> was what he really <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ted. An idea struck him and he turned to <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>. <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> had just begun to sneak off on his own, and he was crawling away on all <name type="CARDINAL">four</name>s through the fern.</p>
<p>`Hi! <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>! ' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. `Where are you going? <name type="PERSON">Hunt</name>ing? Well see here, old noser, you <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t like our food, and I'd not be sorry for a change myself. Your new motto's _always ready to help_. Could you find anything fit for a hungry hobbit? '</p>
<p>`Yes, perhaps, yes,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>. `Sm�agol always helps, if they asks � if they asks nicely.'</q></p>
<p>`Right!<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> <name type="PERSON">`I</name> does ask. And if that isn't nice enough, I begs.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> disappeared. He was away some time, and <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> after a few mouthfuls of _lembas_ settled deep into the brown fern and went to sleep. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> looked at him. The early <name type="DATE">day</name>light was only just creeping down into the shadows under the trees, but he saw his master's face very clearly, and his hands, too, lying at rest on the ground beside him. He was reminded suddenly of <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> as he had lain, asleep in the house of <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name>, after his deadly wound. Then as he had kept watch <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> had noticed that at times a light seemed to be shining faintly within; but now the light was even clearer and stronger. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s face was peaceful, the <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ks of fear and care had left it; but it looked old, old and beautiful, as if the chiselling of <name type="DATE">the shaping <name type="DATE">year</name>s</name> was now revealed in many fine lines that had before been hidden, though the identity of the face was not changed. Not that <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> <name type="PERSON">Gamgee</name> put it that way to himself. He shook his head, as if finding words useless, and murmured: <name type="PERSON">`I</name> love him. He's like that, and sometimes it shines through, somehow. But I love him, whether or no.'</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> returned quietly and peered over <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>'s shoulder. <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>oking at <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, he shut his eyes and crawled away without a sound. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> came to him a moment later and found him chewing something and mutte<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng to himself. On the ground beside him lay <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> small rabbits, which he was beginning to eye greedily.</p>
<p><q>'Sm�agol always helps,'</q> he said. <name type="PERSON">`He</name> has brought rabbits, nice rabbits. But master has g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> to sleep, and perhaps <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ts to sleep. Doesn't <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t rabbits now? Sm�agol t<name type="GPE">ri</name>es to help, but he can't catch things all in <name type="TIME">a minute</name>.'</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, however, had no objection to rabbit at all, and said so. At least not to cooked rabbit. All hobbits, of course, can cook, for they begin to learn the art before their letters (which many never reach): but <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> was a good cook, even by hobbit reckoning, and he had <name type="PERSON">don</name>e a good deal of the camp-cooking on their travels, when there was a chance. He still hopefully car<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed some of his gear in his pack: a small tinder-box, <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> small shallow pans, the smaller fitting into the larger; inside them a wooden spoon, a short <name type="CARDINAL">two</name>-pronged fork and some skewers were stowed; and hidden at the bot<name type="PERSON">tom</name> of the pack in a flat wooden box a dwindling treasure, some salt. But he needed a fire, and other things besides. He thought for a bit, while he took out his knife, cleaned and whetted it, and began to dress the rabbits. He was not going to leave <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> asleep even for <name type="TIME">a few <name type="TIME">minutes</name></name>.</p>
<p><q>'Now, <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>,'</q> he said, 'I've another job for you. Go and fill these pans with water, and b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng 'em back! '</p>
<p><q>'Sm�agol will fetch water, yes,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>. <q>'But what does the hobbit <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t all that water for? He has drunk, he has washed.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Never you mind,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>f you can't guess, you'll soon find out. And the so<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>r you fetch the water, the so<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>r you'll learn. <name type="PERSON">Don</name>'t you damage <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of my pans, or I'll carve you into mincemeat.'</p>
<p>While <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> was away <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> took another look at <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. He was still sleeping quietly, but <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> was now struck most by the leanness of his face and hands. <q>'Too thin and drawn he is,'</q> he muttered. <q>'Not <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght for a hobbit. If I can get these <name type="PERSON">c<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>y</name>s cooked, I'm going to wake him up.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> gathered a pile of the d<name type="GPE">ri</name>est fern, and then scrambled up the bank collecting a bundle of twigs and broken wood; <name type="DATE">the fall</name>en branch of a cedar at the top gave him a good supply. He cut out some turves at the foot of the bank just outside the fern-brake, and made a shallow hole and laid his fuel in it. Being handy with flint and tinder he soon had a small blaze going. It made little or no smoke but gave off an aromatic scent. He was just stooping over his fire, shielding it and building it up with heavier wood, when <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> returned, carrying the pans carefully and grumbling to himself.</p>
<p>He set the pans down, and then suddenly saw what <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> was doing. He gave a thin hissing sh<name type="GPE">ri</name>ek, and seemed to be both f<name type="GPE">ri</name>gh<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed and angry. `<name type="PERSON">Ach</name>! Sss � no!<q>' he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed. `No! <name type="PERSON">Silly</name> hobbits, foolish, yes foolish! They mustn't do it!'</q></p>
<p>`Mustn't do what?' asked <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> in surp<name type="GPE">ri</name>se.</p>
<p>`Not make the <name type="ORG">nassty</name> red tongues,<q>' hissed <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>. `<name type="ORG">Fire</name>, fire! It's dangerous, yes it is. It burns, it kills. And it will b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng enemies, yes it will.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t think so,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. `<name type="PERSON">Don</name>'t see why it should, if you <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t put wet stuff on it and make a smother. But if it does, it does. I'm going to <name type="GPE">ri</name>sk it, anyhow. I'm going to stew these <name type="PERSON">c<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>y</name>s.'</p>
<p><q>'Stew the rabbits!'</q> squealed <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> in dismay. `Spoil beautiful meat Sm�agol saved for you, poor hungry Sm�agol! What for? What for, silly hobbit? They are young, they are <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>der, they are nice. Eat them, eat them!' He clawed at the nearest rabbit, already skinned and lying by the fire.</p>
<p>`Now, now! <q>' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. `Each to his own fashion. Our bread chokes you, and raw <name type="PERSON">c<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>y</name> chokes me. If you give me a <name type="PERSON">c<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>y</name>, the <name type="PERSON">c<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>y</name>'s mine, see, to cook, if I have a mind. And I have. You <name type="PERSON">needn</name>'t watch me. Go and catch another and eat it as you fancy � somewhere p<name type="GPE">ri</name>vate and out o' my sight. Then you won't see the fire, and I shan't see you, and we'll both be the happier. I'll see the fire <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t smoke, if that's any comfort to you.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> withdrew grumbling, and crawled into the fern. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> busied himself with his pans. `What a hobbit needs with <name type="PERSON">c<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>y</name>,<q>' he said to himself, `is some herbs and roots, especially taters � not to mention bread. Herbs we can manage, seemingly.'</q></p>
<p>`<name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>!<q>' he called softly. `<name type="ORDINAL">Third</name> time pays for all. I <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t some herbs.'</q> <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>'s head peeped out of the fern, but his looks were neither helpful nor f<name type="GPE">ri</name>endly. <name type="PERSON">`A</name> few bay-leaves, some thyme and sage, will do � before the water boils,' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>.</p>
<p>`No! ' said <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>. `Sm�agol is not pleased. And Sm�agol doesn't like smelly leaves. He doesn't eat grasses or roots, no precious, not till he's starving or very sick, poor Sm�agol. '</p>
<p>`Sm�agol'll get into real true hot water, when this water boils, if he <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t do as he's asked,<q>' growled <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. `<name type="PERSON">Sam</name>'ll put his head in it, yes precious. And I'd make him look for turnips and carrots, and taters too, if it was the time o' <name type="DATE">the <name type="DATE">year</name></name>. I'll bet there's all sorts of good things running wild in this country. I'd give a lot for <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> <name type="CARDINAL">a <name type="CARDINAL">dozen</name></name> taters.'</q></p>
<p>`Sm�agol won't go, O no precious, not this time,' hissed <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>. <name type="PERSON">`He</name>'s f<name type="GPE">ri</name>gh<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed, and he's very tired, and this hobbit's not nice, not nice at all. Sm�agol won't grub for roots and carrotses and � taters. What's taters, precious, eh, what's taters?</p>
<p>`Po-ta-toes,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. 'The <name type="PERSON">Gaffer</name>'s delight, and rare good ballast for an empty belly. But you won't find any, so you <name type="PERSON">needn</name>'t look. But be good Sm�agol and fetch me the herbs, and I'll think better of you. What's more, if you turn over a new leaf, and keep it turned, I'll cook you some taters <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of these <name type="DATE">day</name>s. I will: f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed fish and chips served by S. <name type="PERSON">Gamgee</name>. You couldn't say no to that.'</q></p>
<p>`Yes, yes we could. Spoiling nice fish, scor<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g it. Give me fish _now_, and keep <name type="ORG">nassty</name> chips! '</p>
<p>`Oh you're hopeless,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. 'Go to sleep!'</q></p>
<p>In the end he had to find what he <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ted for himself; but he did not have to go far, not out of sight of the place where his master lay, still sleeping. For a while <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> sat musing, and <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ding the fire till the water boiled. <name type="DATE">The <name type="DATE">day</name></name>light grew and the air became warm; the dew faded off turf and leaf. Soon the rabbits cut up lay simme<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng in their pans with the bunched herbs. Almost <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> fell asleep as the time went by. He let them stew for close on <name type="TIME">an <name type="TIME">hour</name></name>, testing them now and again with his fork, and tasting the broth.</p>
<p>When he thought all was ready he lifted the pans off the fire, and crept along to <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> opened his eyes as <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> stood over him, and then he wakened from his dreaming: another gentle, unrecoverable dream of peace.</p>
<p>`<name type="ORG">Hullo</name>, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>! ' he said. `Not resting? Is anything wrong? What is the time? '</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`A</name>bout <name type="TIME">a couple of <name type="TIME">hour</name>s</name> after <name type="DATE">day</name>break,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, `and nigh on <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> past <name type="CARDINAL">eight</name> by <name type="LOC">Shire</name> clocks, maybe. But nothing's wrong. Though it ain't quite what I'd call <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght: no stock, no onions, no taters. I've got a bit of a stew for you, and some broth, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. Do you good. You'll have to sup it in your mug; or straight from the pan, when it's cooled a bit. I haven't brought no bowls, nor nothing proper.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> yawned and stretched. <q>'You should have been resting <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>,'</q> he said. 'And lighting a fire was dangerous in these parts. But I do feel hungry. Hmm! Can I smell it from here? What have you stewed? '</p>
<p><q>'A present from Sm�agol,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>: `a brace o' young <name type="PERSON">c<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>y</name>s; though I fancy <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>'s regretting them now. But there's nought to go with them but a few herbs.'</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> and his master sat just within the fern-brake and ate their stew from the pans, sha<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng the old fork and spoon. They allowed themselves <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> a piece of the <name type="PERSON">Elvish</name> <name type="PERSON">waybread</name> each. It seemed a feast.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Wheew</name>! <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>! ' <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> called and whistled softly. 'Come on! Still time to change your mind. There's some left, if you <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t to try stewed <name type="PERSON">c<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>y</name>.'</q> There was no answer.</p>
<p>`Oh well, I suppose he's g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> off to find something for himself. We'll finish it,' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`A</name>nd then you must take some sleep,' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.</p>
<p>`<name type="PERSON">Don</name>'t you drop off, while I'm nodding, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t feel too sure of him. There's a good deal of <name type="PRODUCT">Stinker</name>-the bad <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>, if you understand me-in him still, and it's getting stronger again. Not but what I think he'd try to throttle me <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> now. We <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t see eye to eye, and he's not pleased with <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, O no precious, not pleased at all.'</p>
<p>They finished, and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> went off to the stream to <name type="GPE">ri</name>nse his gear. As he stood <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name> return, he looked back up the slope. At that moment he saw the sun <name type="GPE">ri</name>se out of the <name type="GPE">reek</name>, or haze, or dark shadow, or whatever it was, that lay ever to the east, and it sent its golden beams down upon the trees and glades about him. Then he noticed a thin spiral of blue-grey, smoke, plain to see as it caught the sunlight, <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing from a thicket above him. With a shock he realized that this was the smoke from his little cooking-fire, which he had neglected to put out.</p>
<p>`That won't do! Never thought it would show like that! ' he muttered, and he started to hurry back. Suddenly he halted and lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed. Had he heard a whistle or not? Or was it the call of some strange bird? If it was a whistle, it did not come from <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s direction. There it went again from another place! <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> began to run as well as he could uphill.</p>
<p>He found that a small brand, burning away to its outer end, had kindled some fern at the edge of the fire, and the fern blazing up had set the turves smoulde<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng. <name type="PERSON">Hastily</name> he stamped out what was left of the fire, scattered the ashes, and laid the turves on the hole. Then he crept back to <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.</p>
<p>'Did you hear a whistle, and what sounded like an answer? ' he asked. `<name type="TIME">A few <name type="TIME">minutes</name></name> back. I hope it was only a bird, but it didn't sound quite like that: more like somebody mimicking a bird-call, I thought. And I'm afraid my bit of fire's been smoking. Now if I've g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> and brought trouble, I'll never forgive myself. Nor won't have a chance, maybe! '</p>
<p>`<name type="PERSON">Hush</name>! <q>' whispered <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> thought I heard voices.'</q></p>
<p>The <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> hobbits trussed their small packs, put them on ready for flight, and then crawled deeper into the fern. There they crouched lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing.</p>
<p>There was no doubt of the voices. They were speaking low and furtively, but they were near, and coming nearer. Then quite suddenly <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> spoke clearly close at hand.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`He</name>re! Here is where the smoke came from! <q>' it said. `'Twill be nigh at hand. In the fern, no doubt. We shall have it like a <name type="PERSON">c<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>y</name> in a trap. Then we shall learn what kind of thing it is.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`A</name>ye, and what it knows! ' said a <name type="ORG">sec</name>ond voice.</p>
<p>At once <name type="CARDINAL">four</name> men came st<name type="GPE">ri</name>ding through the fern from different directions. Since flight and hiding were no longer possible, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> sprang to their feet, putting back to back and whipping out their small swords.</p>
<p>If they were astonished at what they saw, their captors were even more astonished. <name type="CARDINAL">Four</name> tall <name type="ORG">Men</name> stood there. <name type="CARDINAL">Two</name> had spears in their hands with broad b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght heads. <name type="CARDINAL">Two</name> had great bows, almost of their own h<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name>, and great quivers of long green-feathered arrows. All had swords at their sides, and were clad in green and brown of va<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed hues, as if the better to walk unseen in the glades of <name type="ORG">Ithil</name>ien. Green gauntlets covered their hands, and their faces were hooded and masked with green, except for their eyes, which were very keen and b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght. At once <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> thought of <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>, for these <name type="ORG">Men</name> were like him in stature and bea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng, and in their manner of speech.</p>
<p>`We have not found what we sought,' said <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. `But what have we found? '</p>
<p><q>'Not <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s,'</q> said another, releasing the hilt of his sword, which he had seized when he saw the glitter of <name type="PERSON">Sting</name> in <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s hand.</p>
<p>`<name type="ORG">Elves</name>? ' said <name type="CARDINAL">a <name type="ORDINAL">third</name></name>, doubtfully.</p>
<p>`<name type="PERSON">Nay</name>! Not <name type="ORG">Elves</name>,<q>' said the <name type="CARDINAL">four</name>th, the tallest, and as it appeared the chief among them. `<name type="ORG">Elves</name> do not walk in <name type="ORG">Ithil</name>ien in these <name type="DATE">day</name>s. And <name type="ORG">Elves</name> are wondrous fair to look upon, or so 'tis said.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Meaning we're not, I take you,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. `Thank you kindly. And when you've finished discussing us, perhaps you'll say who you are, and why you can't let <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> tired travellers rest.'</p>
<p>The tall green man laughed g<name type="GPE">ri</name>mly. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> am <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir, Captain of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>,<q>' he said. `But there are no travellers in this land: only the servants of the Dark <name type="FAC">Tower</name>, or of the White.'</q></p>
<p>`But we are neither,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <name type="PERSON">`A</name>nd travellers we are, whatever Captain <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir may say.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Then make haste to declare yourselves and your errand,'</q> said <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir. 'We have a work to do, and this is no time or place for <name type="GPE">ri</name>ddling or parleying. Come! Where is the <name type="ORDINAL">third</name> of your company? '</p>
<p>`The <name type="ORDINAL">third</name>? '</p>
<p><q>'Yes, the skulking fellow that we saw with his nose in the pool down yonder. He had an ill-favoured look. Some spying breed of <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>, I guess, or a creature of theirs. But he gave us the slip by some fox-t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ck.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I do not know where he is,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'He is only a chance companion met upon our road; and I am not answerable for him. If you come on him, spare him. B<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng him or send him to us. He is only a wretched gangrel creature, but I have him under my care for a while. But as for us, we are <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbits of the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>, far to the <name type="LOC">North</name> and <name type="LOC">West</name>, beyond many <name type="GPE">ri</name>vers. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> son of <name type="ORG">Drogo</name> is my name, and with me is <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>wise son of <name type="LOC">Hamfast</name>, a worthy hobbit in my service. We have come by long ways � out of <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name>, or <name type="GPE">Imlad<name type="GPE">ri</name>s</name> as some call it.'</q> Here <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir started and grew in<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>t. <q>'<name type="CARDINAL">Seven</name> companions we had: <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> we lost at <name type="GPE">Mo<name type="GPE">ri</name>a</name>, the others we left at <name type="FAC">Parth Galen</name> above <name type="PERSON">Rauros</name>: <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> of my kin; a <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Dwarf</name> there was also, and an <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name>, and <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> <name type="ORG">Men</name>. They were <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>; and <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>, who said that he came out of Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name>, a city in the <name type="LOC">South</name>.'</q></p>
<p>'<name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>! ' all the <name type="CARDINAL">four</name> men exclaimed.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> son of the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name>?'</q> said <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir, and a strange stern look came into his face. <q>'You came with him? That is news indeed, if it be true. Know, little strangers, that <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> son of <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name> was <name type="PERSON">High <name type="PERSON">Warden</name></name> of the White <name type="FAC">Tower</name>, and our Captain-General: sorely do we miss him. Who are you then, and what had you to do with him? Be swift, for the <name type="ORG">Sun</name> is climbing!'</q></p>
<p>'Are the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ddling words known to you that <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> brought to <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name>? ' <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> replied.</p>
<p>Seek for the <name type="PRODUCT">Sword</name> that was Broken.</p>
<p>In <name type="GPE">Imlad<name type="GPE">ri</name>s</name> it dwells.</p>
<p><q>'The words are known indeed,'</q> said <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir in astonishment. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>t is some token of your truth that you also know them.'</p>
<p>`<name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> whom I named is the bearer of the <name type="PRODUCT">Sword</name> that was Broken,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. 'And we are the <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>flings that the rhyme spoke of.'</q></p>
<p>`That I see,' said <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir thoughtfully. `Or I see that it might be so. And what is <name type="ORG">Isildur</name>'s Bane? '</p>
<p>`That is hidden,<q>' answered <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <name type="PERSON">`Do</name>ubtless it will be made clear in time.'</q></p>
<p>`We must learn more of this,<q>' said <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir, `and know what b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ngs you so far east under the shadow of yonder-,'</q> he pointed and said no name. <q>'But not now. We have business in hand. You are in pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>l. and you would not have g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> far by field or road this <name type="DATE">day</name>. There will be hard handstrokes nigh at hand ere the <name type="DATE">day</name> is full. Then death, or swift flight bark to <name type="GPE">Anduin</name>. I will leave <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> to guard you, for your good and for mine. <name type="PERSON">Wise</name> man trusts not to chance-meeting on the road in this land. If I return, I will speak more with you.'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="LOC">Far</name>ewell!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, bowing low. `Think what you will, I am a f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end of all enemies of the <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> Enemy. We would go with you, if we <name type="CARDINAL">half</name>ling folk could hope to serve you, such doughty men and strong as you seem, and if my errand permitted it. <name type="DATE">May</name> the light shine on your swords!'</p>
<p><q>'The <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>flings are courteous folk, whatever else they be,'</q> said <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir. `<name type="LOC">Far</name>ewell!'</p>
<p>The hobbits sat down again, but they said nothing to <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> another of their thoughts and doubts. Close by, just under the dappling shadow of the dark bay-trees, <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> men remained on guard. They took off their masks now and again to cool them, as the <name type="DATE">day</name><name type="PERSON">-he</name>at grew, and <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> saw that they were goodly men, pale-skinned, dark of <name type="PERSON">hai</name>r, with grey eyes and faces sad and proud. They spoke together in soft voices, at <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> using the Common <name type="ORG">Speech</name>, but after the manner of older <name type="DATE">day</name>s, and then changing to another language of their own. To his amazement, as he lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> became aware that it was the <name type="ORG">Elven</name>-tongue that they spoke, or <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> but little different; and he looked at them with wonder, for he knew then that they must be D�nedain of the <name type="LOC">South</name>, men of the line of the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rds of <name type="LOC">West</name>ernesse.</p>
<p>After a while he spoke to them; but they were slow and cautious in answe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng. They named themselves <name type="ORG">Mablung</name> and <name type="PERSON">Damrod</name>, soldiers of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>, and they were <name type="PRODUCT">Ranger</name>s of <name type="ORG">Ithil</name>ien; for they were descended from folk who lived in <name type="ORG">Ithil</name>ien at <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> time, before it was overrun. From such men the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name> chose his forayers, who crossed the <name type="GPE">Anduin</name> <name type="ORG">sec</name>retly (how or where, they would not say) to harry the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s and other enemies that roamed between the <name type="FAC">Ephel D�ath</name> and the <name type="LOC">River</name>.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`I</name>t is close on <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> leagues hence to the east-shore of <name type="GPE">Anduin</name>,' said <name type="ORG">Mablung</name>, 'and we seldom come so far afield. But we have a new errand on this journey: we come to am<name type="PERSON">bush</name> the <name type="ORG">Men</name> of <name type="ORG">Harad</name>. Curse them! '</p>
<p><q>'Aye, curse the <name type="LOC">South</name>rons! ' said <name type="PERSON">Damrod</name>. ` '<name type="ORG">Tis</name> said that there were dealings of old between <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> and the kingdoms of the <name type="ORG">Harad</name> in the <name type="LOC">Far</name> <name type="LOC">South</name>; though there was never f<name type="GPE">ri</name>endship. In those <name type="DATE">day</name>s our bounds were away south beyond the mouths of <name type="GPE">Anduin</name>, and <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Umbar</name>, the nearest of their realms, acknowledged our sway. But that is long since. '<name type="ORG">Tis</name> many lives of <name type="ORG">Men</name> since any passed to or fro between us. Now of late we have learned that the Enemy has been among them, and they are g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> over to Him, or back to Him-they were ever ready to His will-as have so many also in the <name type="LOC">East</name>. I doubt not that the <name type="DATE">day</name>s of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> are numbered, and the walls of Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name> are doomed, so great is His strength and malice.'</q></p>
<p>`But still we will not sit idle and let Him do all as He would,<q>' said <name type="ORG">Mablung</name>. `These cursed <name type="LOC">South</name>rons come now <name type="PERSON">mar</name><name type="PERSON">chin</name>g up the ancient roads to swell the hosts of the Dark <name type="FAC">Tower</name>. Yea, up the very roads that craft of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> made. And they go ever more heedlessly, we learn, thinking that the power of their new master is great enough, so that the mere shadow of His hills will protect them. We come to teach them another lesson. Great strength of them was reported to us some <name type="DATE">day</name>s ago, <name type="PERSON">mar</name><name type="PERSON">chin</name>g north. <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> of their regiments is due by our reckoning to pass by, some time ere <name type="TIME">noon</name>-up on the road above, where it passes through the cloven way. The road may pass, but they shall not! Not while <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir is Captain. He leads now in all pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>lous ventures. But his life is charmed, or fate spares him for some other end.'</q></p>
<p>Their talk died down into a lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing silence. All seemed still and watchful. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, crouched by the edge of the fern-brake, peered out. With his keen hobbit-eyes he saw that many more <name type="ORG">Men</name> were about. He could see them stealing up the slopes, singly or in long files, keeping always to the shade of grove or thicket, or crawling, hardly visible in their brown and green raiment, through grass and brake. All were hooded and masked, and had gauntlets on their hands, and were armed like <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir and his companions. Before long they had all passed and vanished. The sun rose till it neared the <name type="LOC">South</name>. The shadows shrank.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`I</name> wonder where that dratted <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> is? <q>' thought <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, as he crawled back into deeper shade. <name type="PERSON">`He</name> stands a fair chance of being spitted for an <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>, or of being roasted by the <name type="ORG">Yellow</name> Face. But I fancy he'll look after himself.'</q> He lay down beside <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and began to doze.</p>
<p>He woke, thinking that he had heard horns blowing. He sat up. It was now high <name type="TIME">noon</name>. The guards stood alert and <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>se in the shadow of the trees. Suddenly the horns rang out louder and beyond mistake from above, over the top of the slope. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> thought that he heard c<name type="GPE">ri</name>es and wild shouting also, but the sound was faint, as if it came out of some distant cave. Then presently the noise of fighting broke out near at hand, just above their hiding-place. He could hear plainly the <name type="GPE">ri</name>nging grate of steel on steel, the clang of sword on iron cap, the dull beat of blade on shield; men were yelling and screaming, and <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> clear loud voice was calling _<name type="ORG">Gondor</name>_! _<name type="ORG">Gondor</name>_!</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`I</name>t sounds like <name type="CARDINAL">a <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name></name> blacksmiths all smithying together,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> to <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. 'They're as near as I <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t them now.'</q></p>
<p>But the noise grew closer. `They are coming!<q>' c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Damrod</name>. `See! Some of the <name type="LOC">South</name>rons have broken from the trap and are flying from the road. There they go! Our men after them, and the Captain leading.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, eager to see more, went now and joined the guards. He scrambled a little way up into <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the larger of the bay-trees. For a moment he caught a glimpse of <name type="PERSON">swart</name>hy men in red running down the slope some way off with green-clad war<name type="GPE">ri</name>ors leaping after them, hewing them down as they fled. Arrows were thick in the air. Then suddenly straight over the <name type="GPE">ri</name>m of their shelte<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng bank, a man fell, crashing through the slender trees, nearly on top of them. He came to rest in the fern <name type="QUANTITY">a few feet</name> away, face downward, green arrow-feathers sticking from his neck below a golden collar. His scarlet robes were tattered, his corslet of overlapping brazen plates was rent and hewn, his black plaits of <name type="PERSON">hai</name>r braided with gold were drenched with blood. His brown hand still clutched the hilt of a broken sword.</p>
<p>It was <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>'s <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> view of a battle of <name type="ORG">Men</name> against <name type="ORG">Men</name>, and he did not like it much. He was glad that he could not see the dead face. He wondered what the man's name was and where he came from; and if he was really evil of heart, or what lies or threats had led him on the long <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ch from his home; and if he would not really rather have stayed there in peace-all in a flash of thought which was quickly d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ven from his mind. For just as <name type="ORG">Mablung</name> stepped towards <name type="DATE">the fall</name>en body, there was a new noise. Great crying and shouting. Amidst it <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> heard a sh<name type="GPE">ri</name>ll bellowing or trumpeting. And then a great thudding and bumping. like huge rams dinning on the ground.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Ware</name>! <name type="PERSON">Ware</name>!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Damrod</name> to his companion. <q>'<name type="DATE">May</name> the <name type="NORP">Valar</name> turn him aside! M<name type="PERSON">�mak</name>! M<name type="PERSON">�mak</name>!'</q></p>
<p>To his astonishment and terror, and lasting delight, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> saw a vast shape crash out of the trees and come caree<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng down the slope. Big as a house, much bigger than a house, it looked to him, a grey-clad moving hill. Fear and wonder, maybe, enlarged him in the hobbit's eyes, but <name type="PRODUCT">the M<name type="PERSON">�mak</name></name> of <name type="ORG">Harad</name> was indeed a beast of vast bulk, and the like of him does not walk now in <name type="LOC">Middle-<name type="LOC">earth</name></name>; his kin that live still in latter <name type="DATE">day</name>s are but memo<name type="GPE">ri</name>es of his girth and majesty. On he came, straight towards the watchers, and then swerved aside in the <name type="GPE">nick</name> of time, passing only <name type="QUANTITY">a few yards</name> away, rocking the ground beneath their feet: his great legs like trees, enormous sail-like ears spread out, long snout upraised like a huge serpent about to st<name type="GPE">ri</name>ke. his small red eyes raging. His upturned hornlike tusks were bound with bands of gold and d<name type="GPE">ri</name>pped with blood. His trappings of scarlet and gold flapped about him in wild tatters. The ruins of what seemed a very war-tower lay upon his heaving back, smashed in his fu<name type="GPE">ri</name>ous passage through the woods; and high upon his neck still desperately clung a tiny figure-the body of a mighty war<name type="GPE">ri</name>or, a giant among the <name type="GPE">Swertings</name>.</p>
<p>On the great beast thundered, blunde<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng in blind wrath through pool and thicket. Arrows skipped and snapped harmlessly about the t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ple hide of his flanks. <name type="ORG">Men</name> of both sides fled before him, but many he overtook and crushed to the ground. Soon he was lost to view, still trumpeting and stamping far away. What became of him <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> never heard: whether he escaped to roam the wild for a time, until he pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>shed far from his home or was trapped in some deep pit; or whether he raged on until he plunged in the <name type="LOC">Great <name type="LOC">River</name></name> and was swallowed up.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> drew a deep breath. <q>'An <name type="ORG">Oliphaunt</name> it was!'</q> he said. `So there are <name type="ORG">Oliphaunt</name>s, and I have seen <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. What a life! But no <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> at home will ever believe me. Well, if that's over, I'll have a bit of sleep.'</p>
<p><q>'Sleep while you may,'</q> said <name type="ORG">Mablung</name>. `But the Captain will return, if he is unhurt; and when he comes we shall depart swiftly. We shall be pursued as soon as news of our deed reaches the Enemy, and that will not be long.'</p>
<p><name type="ORG">`Go</name> quietly when you must!<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. `No need to disturb my sleep. I was walking <name type="TIME">all <name type="TIME">night</name></name>.'</q></p>
<p><name type="ORG">Mablung</name> laughed. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> do not think the Captain will leave you here, <name type="PERSON">Master <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>wise</name>,<q>' he said. 'But you shall see.'</q></p>

<p>The Window on the <name type="LOC">West</name></p>
<p>It seemed to <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> that he had only dozed for <name type="TIME">a few <name type="TIME">minutes</name></name> when he awoke to find that it was late <name type="TIME">after<name type="TIME">noon</name></name> and <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir had come back. He had brought many men with him; indeed all the survivors of the foray were now gathered on the slope nearby, <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> or <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name> strong. They sat in a wide semicircle, between the arms of which <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir was seated on the ground, while <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> stood before him. It looked strangely like the t<name type="GPE">ri</name>al of a p<name type="GPE">ri</name>s<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>r.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> crept out from the fern, but no <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> paid any at<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>tion to him, and he placed himself at the end of the rows of men, where he could see and hear all that was going on. He watched and lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed in<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>tly, ready to dash to his master's aid if needed. He could see <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir's face, which was now unmasked: it was stern and commanding, and a keen wit lay behind his sear<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g glance. Doubt was in the grey eyes that gazed steadily at <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> soon became aware that the Captain was not satisfied with <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s account of himself at several points: what part he had to play in the <name type="ORG">Company</name> that set out from <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name>; why he had left <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>; and where he was now going. In particular he returned of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> to <name type="ORG">Isildur</name>'s Bane. <name type="LOC">Plain</name>ly he saw that <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> was concealing from him some matter of great imp<name type="GPE">ortan</name>ce.</p>
<p><q>'But it was at the coming of the <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>fling that <name type="ORG">Isildur</name>'s Bane should waken, or so <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> must read the words,'</q> he insisted. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>f then you are the <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>fling that was named, doubtless you brought this thing, whatever it may be, to the <name type="ORG">Council</name> of which you speak, and there <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> saw it. Do you deny it? '</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> made no answer. 'So! ' said <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> wish then to learn from you more of it; for what concerns <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> concerns me. An orc-arrow slew <name type="ORG">Isildur</name>, so far as old tales tell. But orc-arrows are plenty, and the sight of <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> would not be taken as a sign of Doom by <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>. Had you this thing in keeping? It is hidden, you say; but is not that because you choose to hide it? '</p>
<p><q>'No, not because I choose,'</q> answered <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>t does not belong to me. It does not belong to any mortal, great or small; though if any could claim it, it would be <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> son of <name type="ORG">Arathorn</name>, whom I named, the leader of our <name type="ORG">Company</name> from <name type="GPE">Mo<name type="GPE">ri</name>a</name> to <name type="PERSON">Rauros</name>.'</p>
<p>'Why so, and not <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>, p<name type="GPE">ri</name>nce of the <name type="LOC">City</name> that the sons of <name type="PERSON">Elen</name>dil founded? '</p>
<p><q>'Because <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> is descended in direct lineage, father to father, from <name type="ORG">Isildur</name> <name type="PERSON">Elen</name>dil's son himself. And the sword that he bears was <name type="PERSON">Elen</name>dil's sword.'</q></p>
<p>A murmur of astonishment ran through all the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng of men. Some c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed aloud: 'The sword of <name type="PERSON">Elen</name>dil! The sword of <name type="PERSON">Elen</name>dil comes to Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name>! Great tidings! ' But <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir's face was unmoved.</p>
<p>`<name type="DATE">May</name>be,<q>' he said. `But so great a claim will need to be established and clear proofs will be required, should this <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> ever come to Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name>. He had not come, nor any of your <name type="ORG">Company</name>, when I set out <name type="CARDINAL">six</name> <name type="DATE">day</name>s ago.'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> was satisfied of that claim,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>ndeed, if <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> were here, he would answer all your questions. And since he was already at <name type="PERSON">Rauros</name> m<name type="DATE">any <name type="DATE">day</name></name>s back, and in<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ded then to go straight to your city, if you return, you may soon learn the answers there. My part in the <name type="ORG">Company</name> was known to him, as to all the others. for it was appointed to me by <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name> of <name type="GPE">Imlad<name type="GPE">ri</name>s</name> himself before the whole <name type="ORG">Council</name>. On that errand I came into this country, but it is not mine to reveal to any outside the <name type="ORG">Company</name>. Yet those who claim to oppose the Enemy would do well not to hinder it.'</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s t<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> was proud, whatever he felt, and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> approved of it; but it did not appease <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir.</p>
<p>`So!<q>' he said. `You bid me mind my own affairs, and get me back home, and let you be. <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> will tell all, when he comes. When he comes, say you! Were you a f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end of <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>?'</q></p>
<p>Vividly before <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s mind came the memory of <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>'s assault upon him, and for a moment he hesitated. <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir's eyes wat<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g him grew harder. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> was a valiant member of our <name type="ORG">Company</name> ' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> at length. 'Yes, I was his f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end, for my part.'</q></p>
<p><name type="LOC">Far</name>amir smiled g<name type="GPE">ri</name>mly. `Then you would g<name type="GPE">ri</name>eve to learn that <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> is dead? '</p>
<p><q>'I would g<name type="GPE">ri</name>eve indeed,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. Then cat<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g the look in <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir's eyes, he faltered. <q>'Dead?'</q> he said. <name type="PERSON">`Do</name> you mean that he is dead, and that you knew it? You have been trying to trap me in words, playing with me? Or are you now trying to snare me with a falsehood?'</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`I</name> would not snare even an orc with a falsehood,' said <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir.</p>
<p>`<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w then did he die, and how do you know of it? Since you say that n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the <name type="ORG">Company</name> had reached the city when you left.'</p>
<p><q>'As to the manner of his death, I had hoped that his f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end and companion would tell me how it was.'</q></p>
<p>`But he was alive and strong when we parted. And he lives still for all that I know. Though surely there are many pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ls in the world.'</p>
<p>`Many indeed,<q>' said <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir, `and treachery not the least.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> had been getting more and more impatient and angry at this conversation. These last words were more than he could bear, and bursting into the middle of the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng, he strode <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name> his master's side.</p>
<p><q>'Begging your par<name type="PERSON">don</name>, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>,'</q> he said, `but this has g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> on long enough. He's no <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght to talk to you so. After all you've g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> through, as much for his good and all these great <name type="ORG">Men</name> as for any<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> else.</p>
<p><q>'See here, Captain! ' He planted himself squarely in front of <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir his hands on his hips, and a look on his face as if he was addressing a young hobbit who had offered him what he called `sauce' when questi<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>d about visits to the orchard. There was some murmu<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng, but also some g<name type="GPE">ri</name>ns on the faces of the men looking on: the sight of their Captain sitting on the ground and eye to eye with a young hobbit, legs well apart, b<name type="GPE">ri</name>stling with wrath, was <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> beyond their expe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ence. `See here! ' he said. `What are you d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ving at? Let's come to the point before all the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> come down on us! If you think my master murdered this <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> and then ran away, you've got no sense; but say it, and have <name type="PERSON">don</name>e! And then let us know what you mean to do about it. But it's a pity that folk as talk about fighting the Enemy can't let others do their bit in their own way without interfe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng. He'd be mighty pleased, if he could see you now. Think he'd got a new f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end, he would.'</q></p>
<p>`Patience!' said <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir, but without anger. <name type="PERSON">`Do</name> not speak before your master, whose wit is greater than yours. And I do not need any to teach me of our pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>l. Even so, I spare a b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ef time, in order to judge justly in a hard matter. Were I as hasty as you, I might have slain you <name type="DATE">long ago</name>. For I am commanded to slay all whom I find in this land without the leave of the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>. But I do not slay man or beast needlessly, and not gladly even when it is needed. Neither do I talk in vain. So be comforted. Sit by your master, and be silent! '</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> sat down heavily with a red face. <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir turned to <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> again: <q>'You asked how do I know that the son of <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name> is dead. Tidings of death have many wings. _Night oft b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ngs news to near kindred_, 'tis said. <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> was my brother.'</q></p>
<p>A shadow of sorrow passed over his face. <name type="PERSON">`Do</name> you remember aught of special <name type="PERSON">mar</name>k that the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> bore with him among his gear?'</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> thought for a moment, fea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng some further trap, and wonde<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng how this debate would turn in the end. He had hardly saved the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> from the proud grasp of <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>, and how he would fare now among so many men, warlike and strong, he did not know. Yet he felt in his heart that <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir, though he was much like his brother in looks, was a man less self-regarding, both sterner and wiser. <q>'I remember that <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> bore a horn,'</q> he said at last.</p>
<p>`You remember well, and as <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> who has in truth seen him,' said <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir. `Then maybe you can see it in your mind's eye: a great horn of the wild ox of the <name type="LOC">East</name>, bound with silver, and w<name type="GPE">ri</name>t<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> with ancient characters. That horn the eldest son of our house has borne for many generations; and it is said that if it be blown at need anywhere within the bounds of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>, as the realm was of old, its voice will not pass unheeded.</p>
<p>'<name type="CARDINAL">Five</name> <name type="DATE">day</name>s ere I set out on this venture, eleven <name type="DATE">day</name>s ago at <name type="TIME">about this <name type="TIME">hour</name> of the <name type="DATE">day</name></name>, I heard the blowing of that horn: from the northward it seemed, but dim, as if it were but an echo in the mind. A boding of ill we thought it, my father and I, for no tidings had we heard of <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> since he went away, and no watcher on our borders had seen him pass. And on the <name type="ORDINAL">third</name> <name type="TIME">night</name> after another and a stranger thing befell me.</p>
<p>'I sat at <name type="TIME">night</name> by the waters of <name type="GPE">Anduin</name>, in the grey dark under the young pale moon, wat<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g the ever-moving stream; and the sad reeds were rustling. So do we ever watch the shores nigh <name type="NORP">Osgiliath</name>, which our enemies now partly hold, and issue from it to harry our lands. But that <name type="TIME">night</name> all the world slept at the <name type="TIME">mid<name type="TIME">night</name></name> <name type="TIME">hour</name>. Then I saw, or it seemed that I saw, a boat floating on the water, glimme<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng grey, a small boat of a strange fashion with a high prow. and there was n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> to row or steer it.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`A</name>n awe fell on me, for a pale light was round it. But I rose and went to the bank, and began to walk out into the stream, for I was drawn towards it. Then the boat turned towards me, and stayed its pace, and floated slowly by within my hand's reach, yet I durst not handle it. It waded deep, as if it were heavily burdened, and it seemed to me as it passed under my gaze that it was almost filled with clear water, from which came the light; and lapped in the water a war<name type="GPE">ri</name>or lay asleep.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`A</name> broken sword was on his knee. I saw many wounds on him. It was <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>, my brother, dead. I knew his gear, his sword, his beloved face. <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> thing only I missed: his horn. <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> thing only I knew not: a fair belt, as it were of linked golden leaves, about his waist. _<name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>!_ I c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed_. Where is thy horn? Whither <name type="PERSON">goest</name> thou? O <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>!_ But he was g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. The boat turned into the stream and passed glimme<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng on into the <name type="TIME">night</name>. Dreamlike it was. and yet no dream, for there was no waking. And I do not doubt that he is dead and has passed down the <name type="LOC">River</name> to the <name type="LOC">Sea</name>.'</p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Alas</name>!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'That was indeed <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> as I knew him. For the golden belt was given to him in <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>thl�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en by the <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> <name type="PERSON">Galad<name type="GPE">ri</name>el</name>. She it was that clothed us as you see us, in <name type="ORG">elven</name>-grey. This brooch is of the same workmanship.'</q> He touched the green and silver leaf that fas<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed his cloak beneath his throat.</p>
<p><name type="LOC">Far</name>amir looked closely at it. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>t is beautiful,<q>' he said. 'Yes, 'tis work of the same craft. So then you passed through the Land of L�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en? <name type="GPE">Laurelind</name>�<name type="GPE">renan</name> it was named of old, but long now it has lain beyond the knowledge of <name type="ORG">Men</name>,'</q> he added softly, regarding <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> with a new wonder in his eyes. `Much that was strange about you I begin now to understand. Will you not tell me more? For it is a bitter thought that <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> died, within sight of the land of his home.'</p>
<p><q>'No more can I say than I have said,'</q> answered <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. `Though your tale fills me with foreboding. A vision it was that you saw, I think, and no more, some shadow of evil fortune that has been or will be. Unless indeed it is some lying t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ck of the Enemy. I have seen the faces of fair war<name type="GPE">ri</name>ors of old laid in sleep beneath the pools of the Dead <name type="LOC">Marshes</name>, or seeming so by his foul arts.'</p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Nay</name>, it was not so,'</q> said <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir. <q>'For his works fill the heart with loathing; but my heart was filled with g<name type="GPE">ri</name>ef and pity.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`Yet</name> how could such a thing have happened in truth? ' asked <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. 'For no boat could have been car<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed over the stony hills from Tol <name type="ORG">Brand</name>ir; and <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> purposed to go home across the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>wash and the fields of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>. And yet how could any vessel <name type="GPE">ri</name>de the foam of the great falls and not founder in the boiling pools, though laden with water? '</p>
<p><q>'I know not,'</q> said <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir. 'But whence came the boat? '</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`From</name> L�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. 'In <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> such boats we rowed down <name type="GPE">Anduin</name> to the Falls. They also were of <name type="ORG">elven</name>-work.'</q></p>
<p><q>'You passed through the Hidden Land,'</q> said <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir, `but it seems that you little understood its power. If <name type="ORG">Men</name> have dealings with the Mistress of Magic who dwells in the Golden <name type="PERSON">Wood</name>, then they may look for strange things to follow. For it is pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>lous for mortal man to walk out of the world of this <name type="ORG">Sun</name>, and few of old came thence unchanged, 'tis said.</p>
<p>`_<name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>, O <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>!_' he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed. `_What did she say to you, the <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> that dies not? What did she see? What woke in your heart then? Why went you ever to <name type="GPE">Laurelind</name>�<name type="GPE">renan</name>, and came not by your own road, upon the horses of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> <name type="GPE">ri</name>ding home in the <name type="TIME">morning</name>?_'</p>
<p>Then turning again to <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, he spoke in a quiet voice once more. 'To those questions I guess that you could make some answer, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> son of <name type="ORG">Drogo</name>. But not here or now. maybe. But lest you still should think my tale a vision, I will tell you this. The horn of <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> at least returned in truth, and not in seeming. The horn came, but it was cloven in <name type="CARDINAL">two</name>, as it were by axe or sword. The shards came severally to shore: <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> was found among the reeds where watchers of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> lay, northwards below the infalls of the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>wash; the other was found spinning on the flood by <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> who had an errand in the water. Strange chances, but murder will out, 'tis said.</p>
<p>'And now the horn of the elder son lies in <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> pieces upon the lap of <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name>, sitting in his high c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>r, waiting for news. And you can tell me nothing of the cleaving of the horn? '</p>
<p><q>'No, I did not know of it,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. `But the <name type="DATE">day</name> when you heard it blowing, if your reckoning is true, was the <name type="DATE">day</name> when we parted, when I and my servant left the <name type="ORG">Company</name>. And now your tale fills me with dread. For if <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> was then in pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>l and was slain, I must fear that all my companions pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>shed too. And they were my kindred and my f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`Will</name> you not put aside your doubt of me and let me go? I am weary, and full of g<name type="GPE">ri</name>ef, and afraid. But I have a deed to do, or to attempt, before I too am slain. And the more need of haste, if we <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> <name type="CARDINAL">half</name>lings are all that remain of our fellowship.</p>
<p><q>'Go back, <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir, valiant Captain of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>, and de<name type="PERSON">fen</name>d your city while you may, and let me go where my doom takes me.'</q></p>
<p>`For me there is no comfort in our speech together,' said <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir; `but you surely draw from it more dread than need be. Unless the people of L�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en themselves came to him, who arrayed <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> as for a funeral? Not <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s or servants of the Nameless. Some of your <name type="ORG">Company</name>, I guess, live still.</p>
<p>`But whatever befell on the <name type="LOC">North</name> <name type="DATE">March</name>, you, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, I doubt no longer. If hard <name type="DATE">day</name>s have made me any judge of <name type="ORG">Men</name>'s words and faces, then I may make a guess at <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>flings! Though,<q>' and now he smiled, `there is something strange about you, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, an elvish air, maybe. But more lies upon our words together than I thought at <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>. I should now take you back to Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name> to answer there to <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name>, and my life will justly be forfeit, if I now choose a course that proves ill for my city. So I will not decide in haste what is to be <name type="PERSON">don</name>e. Yet we must move hence without more delay.'</q></p>
<p>He sprang to his feet and issued some orders. At once the men who were gathered round him broke up into small groups, and went off this way and that, vanishing quickly into the shadows of the rocks and trees. Soon only <name type="ORG">Mablung</name> and <name type="PERSON">Damrod</name> remained.</p>
<p><q>'Now you, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>wise, will come with me and my guards,'</q> said <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir. `You cannot go along the road southwards, if that was your purpose. It will be unsafe for some <name type="DATE">day</name>s, and always more closely watched after this affray than it has been yet. And you cannot, I think, go far to<name type="DATE">day</name> in any case, for you are weary. And so are we. We are going now to a <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret place we have, somewhat <name type="QUANTITY">less than <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> miles</name> from here. The <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s and spies of the Enemy have not found it yet, and if they did, we could hold it long even against many. There we may lie up and rest for a while, and you with us. In the <name type="TIME">morning</name> I will decide what is best for me to do, and for you.'</p>
<p>There was nothing for <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> to do but to fall in with this request, or order. It seemed in any case a wise course for the moment, since this foray of the men of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> had made a journey in <name type="ORG">Ithil</name>ien more dangerous than ever.</p>
<p>They set out at once: <name type="ORG">Mablung</name> and <name type="PERSON">Damrod</name> a little ahead, and <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir with <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> behind. Skirting the hither side of the pool where the hobbits had bathed, they crossed the stream, climbed a long bank, and passed into green-shadowed woodlands that <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ched ever downwards and westwards. While they walked, as swiftly as the hobbits could go, they talked in hushed voices.</p>
<p><q>'I broke off our speech together,'</q> said <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir, <q>'not only because time pressed, as <name type="PERSON">Master <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>wise</name> had reminded me, but also because we were drawing near to matters that were better not debated openly before many men. It was for that reason that I turned rather to the matter of my brother and let be _<name type="ORG">Isildur</name>'s Bane_. You were not wholly frank with me, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`I</name> told no lies, and of the truth all I could,' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`I</name> do not blame you,<q>' said <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir. 'You spoke with skill in a hard place, and wisely, it seemed to me. But I learned or guessed more from you than your words said. You were not f<name type="GPE">ri</name>endly with <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>, or you did not part in f<name type="GPE">ri</name>endship. You, and <name type="PERSON">Master <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>wise</name>, too, I guess have some g<name type="GPE">ri</name>evance. Now I loved him dearly, and would gladly avenge his death, yet I knew him well. _<name type="ORG">Isildur</name>'s Bane_ � I would hazard that _<name type="ORG">Isildur</name>'s Bane_ lay between you and was a cause of con<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>tion in your <name type="ORG">Company</name>. Clearly it is a mighty heirloom of some sort, and such things do not breed peace among con<name type="ORG">fed</name>erates, not if aught may be learned from ancient tales. Do I not hit near the <name type="PERSON">mar</name>k?'</q></p>
<p>`Near,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, 'but not in the gold. There was no con<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>tion in our <name type="ORG">Company</name>, though there was doubt: doubt which way we should take from the <name type="ORG">Emyn Muil</name>. But be that as it may, ancient tales teach us also the pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>l of rash words concerning such things as � heirlooms.'</q></p>
<p>'Ah, then it is as I thought: your trouble was with <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. He wished this thing brought to Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name>. <name type="PERSON">Alas</name>! it is a crooked fate that seals your lips who saw him last, and holds from me that which I long to know: what was in his heart and thought in <name type="TIME">his latest <name type="TIME">hour</name>s</name>. Whether he erred or no, of this I am sure: he died well, achieving some good thing. His face was more beautiful even than in life.</p>
<p>`But, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, I pressed you hard at <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> about _<name type="ORG">Isildur</name>'s Bane_. Forgive me! It was unwise in such <name type="TIME">an <name type="TIME">hour</name></name> and place. I had not had time for thought. We had had a hard fight, and there was more than enough to fill my mind. But even as I spoke with you, I drew nearer to the <name type="PERSON">mar</name>k, and so deliberately shot wider. For you must know that much is still preserved of ancient lore among the Rulers of the city that is not spread abroad. We of my house are not of the line of <name type="PERSON">Elen</name>dil. though the blood of N�menor is in us. For we reckon back our line to <name type="GPE">Mardil</name>, the good steward, who ruled in the king's stead when he went away to war. And that was <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g E�rnur, last of the line of An�<name type="GPE">ri</name>on, and childless, and he came never back. And the stewards have governed the city since that <name type="DATE">day</name>, though it was many generations of <name type="ORG">Men</name> ago.</p>
<p>'And this I remember of <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> as a boy, when we together learned the tale of our sires and the history of our city, that always it displeased him that his father was not king. "<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w many <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name>s of <name type="DATE">year</name>s needs it to make a steward a king, if the king returns not? " he asked. "<name type="DATE">Few <name type="DATE">year</name>s</name>, maybe, in other places of less royalty," my father answered. "In <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> thousand <name type="DATE">year</name>s would not suffice." <name type="PERSON">Alas</name>! poor <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>. Does that not tell you something of him? '</p>
<p><q>'It does,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <name type="PERSON">`Yet</name> always he treated <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> with honour.'</p>
<p><q>'I doubt it not,'</q> said <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>f he were satisfied of <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>'s claim as you say, he would greatly reverence him. But the pinch has not yet come. They had not yet reached Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name> or become <name type="GPE">ri</name>vals in her wars.</p>
<p>`But I stray. We in the house of <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name> know much ancient lore by long tradition, and there are moreover in our treasu<name type="GPE">ri</name>es many things preserved: books and tablets w<name type="GPE">ri</name>t on withered parchments, yea, and on st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, and on leaves of silver and of gold, in divers characters. Some n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> can now read; and for the rest, few ever unlock them. I can read a little in them, for I have had tea<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g. It was these records that brought the <name type="ORG">Grey</name> Pilg<name type="GPE">ri</name>m to us. I <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> saw him when I was a child, and he has been twice or th<name type="GPE">ri</name>ce since then.'</p>
<p><q>'The <name type="ORG">Grey</name> Pilg<name type="GPE">ri</name>m? ' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. 'Had he a name?'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="LOC">Mithrandir</name> we called him in elf-fashion,'</q> said <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir, 'and he was con<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>t. _Many are my names in many count<name type="GPE">ri</name>es_, he said. _<name type="LOC">Mithrandir</name> among the <name type="ORG">Elves</name>, Thark�n to the <name type="ORG">Dwarves</name>; Ol�<name type="GPE">ri</name>n I was in my youth in the <name type="LOC">West</name> that is forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>, in the <name type="LOC">South</name> Inc�nus, in the <name type="LOC">North</name> <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>; to the <name type="LOC">East</name> I go not._'</p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'I thought it was he. <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> the <name type="ORG">Grey</name> dearest of counsellors. Leader of our <name type="ORG">Company</name>. He was lost in <name type="GPE">Mo<name type="GPE">ri</name>a</name>.'</q></p>
<p>'<name type="LOC">Mithrandir</name> was lost! ' said <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir. 'An evil fate seems to have pursued your fellowship. It is hard indeed to believe that <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of so great wisdom, and of power � for many wonderful things he did among us � could pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>sh, and so much lore be taken from the world. Are you sure of this, and that he did not just leave you and depart where he would? '</p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Alas</name>! yes,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> saw him fall into the abyss.'</p>
<p><q>'I see that there is some great tale of dread in this.'</q> said <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir `which perhaps you may tell me in the <name type="TIME">evening</name>-time. This <name type="LOC">Mithrandir</name> was, I now guess, more than a lore-master: a great mover of the deeds that are <name type="PERSON">don</name>e in our time. Had he been among us to consult concerning the hard words of our dream, he could have made them clear to us without need of messenger. Yet, maybe, he would not have <name type="PERSON">don</name>e so, and the journey of <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> was doomed. <name type="LOC">Mithrandir</name> never spoke to us of what was to be, nor did he reveal his purposes. He got leave of <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name>, how I do not know, to look at the <name type="ORG">sec</name>rets of our treasury, and I learned a little of him, when he would teach (and that was seldom). Ever he would search and would question us above all else concerning the Great <name type="EVENT">Battle</name> that was fought upon <name type="PERSON">Dagorlad</name> in the beginning of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>, when He whom we do not name was overthrown. And he was eager for sto<name type="GPE">ri</name>es of <name type="ORG">Isildur</name>, though of him we had less to tell; for nothing certain was ever known among us of his end.'</p>
<p>Now <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir's voice sank to a whisper. 'But this much I learned or guessed, and I have kept it ever <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret in my heart since: that <name type="ORG">Isildur</name> took somewhat from the hand of the Unnamed, ere he went away from <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>, never to be seen among mortal men again. Here I thought was the answer to <name type="LOC">Mithrandir</name>'s questioning. But it seemed then a matter that concerned only the seekers after ancient learning. Nor when the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ddling words of our dream were debated among us, did I think of _<name type="ORG">Isildur</name>'s Bane_ as being this same thing. For <name type="ORG">Isildur</name> was am<name type="PERSON">bush</name>ed and slain by orc-arrows, according to the only legend that we knew, and <name type="LOC">Mithrandir</name> had never told me more.</p>
<p>`What in truth this Thing is I cannot yet guess; but some heirloom of power and pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>l it must be. A fell weapon, perchance, devised by the Dark <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd. If it were a thing that gave advantage in battle. I can well believe that <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>, the proud and fearless, of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> rash, ever anxious for the victory of Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name> (and his own glory therein), might desire such a thing and be allured by it. <name type="PERSON">Alas</name> that ever he went on that errand! I should have been chosen by my father and the elders but he put himself forward. as being the older and the hardier (both true), and he would not be stayed.</p>
<p><q>'But fear no more! I would not take this thing, if it lay by the highway. Not were Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name> falling in ruin and I al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> could save her, so, using the weapon of the Dark <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd for her good and my glory. No. I do not wish for such t<name type="GPE">ri</name>umphs, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> son of <name type="ORG">Drogo</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Neither did the <name type="ORG">Council</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'Nor do I. I would have nothing to do with such matters.'</q></p>
<p>`For myself,' said <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir, 'I would see the White <name type="PERSON">Tree</name> in flower again in the courts of the kings, and the Silver <name type="PRODUCT">Crown</name> return, and Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name> in peace: Minas <name type="GPE">Anor</name> again as of old, full of light, high and fair, beautiful as a queen among other queens: not a mistress of many slaves, nay, not even a kind mistress of willing slaves. War must be, while we de<name type="PERSON">fen</name>d our lives against a destroyer who would devour all; but I do not love the b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght sword for its sharpness, nor the arrow for its swiftness, nor the war<name type="GPE">ri</name>or for his glory. I love only that which they de<name type="PERSON">fen</name>d: the city of the <name type="ORG">Men</name> of N�menor; and I would have her loved for her memory, her ancientry, her beauty, and her present wisdom. Not feared, save as men may fear the dignity of a man, old and wise.</p>
<p><q>'So fear me not! I do not ask you to tell me more. I do not even ask you to tell me whether I now speak nearer the <name type="PERSON">mar</name>k. But if you will trust me, it may be that I can advise you in your present quest, whatever that be-yes, and even aid you.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> made no answer. Almost he yielded to the desire for help and counsel, to tell this grave young man, whose words seemed so wise and fair, all that was in his mind. But something held him back. His heart was heavy with fear and sorrow: if he and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> were indeed, as seemed likely, all that was now left of the <name type="CARDINAL">Nine</name> Walkers, then he was in sole command of the <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret of their errand. Better mistrust undeserved than rash words. And the memory of <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>, of the dreadful change that the lure of the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> had worked in him, was very present to his mind, when he looked at <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir and lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed to his voice: unlike they were, and yet also much akin.</p>
<p>They walked on in silence for a while, passing like grey and green shadows under the old trees, their feet making no sound; above them many birds sang, and the sun glis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed on the polished roof of dark leaves in the evergreen woods of <name type="ORG">Ithil</name>ien.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> had taken no part in the conversation, though he had lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed; and at the same time he had at<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ded with his keen hobbit ears to all the soft woodland noises about them. <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> thing he had noted, that in all the talk the name of <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> had not once come up. He was glad, though he felt that it was too much to hope that he would never hear it again. He soon became aware also that though they walked al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, there were many men close at hand: not only <name type="PERSON">Damrod</name> and <name type="ORG">Mablung</name> flitting in and out of the shadows ahead, but others on either side, all making their swift <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret way to some appointed place.</p>
<p>Once, looking suddenly back, as if some p<name type="GPE">ri</name>ckle of the skin told him that he was watched from behind, he thought he caught a b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ef glimpse of a small dark shape slipping behind a tree-trunk. He opened his mouth to speak and shut it again. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>'m not sure of it,<q>' he said to himself, 'and why should I remind them of the old villain, if they choose to forget him? I wish I could!'</q></p>
<p>So they passed on, until the woodlands grew thinner and the land began to fall more steeply. Then they turned aside again, to the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght, and came quickly to a small <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver in a narrow gorge: it was the same stream that t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ckled far above out of the round pool, now grown to a swift torrent, leaping down over many st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s in a deep-cloven bed, overhung with <name type="GPE">ilex</name> and dark box-woods. <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>oking west they could see, below them in a haze of light, lowlands and broad meads, and glinting far off in the weste<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng sun the wide waters of the <name type="GPE">Anduin</name>.</p>
<p><q>'Here, alas! I must do you a discourtesy,'</q> said <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir. "I hope you will par<name type="PERSON">don</name> it to <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> who has so far made his orders give way to courtesy as not to slay you or to bind you. But it is a command that no stranger, not even <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> that fights with us, shall see the path we now go with open eyes. I must blindfold you.'</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`A</name>s you will,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. 'Even the <name type="ORG">Elves</name> do likewise at need, and blindfolded we crossed the borders of fair <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>thl�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en. <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> the dwarf took it ill, but the hobbits endured it.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`I</name>t is to no place so fair that I shall lead you,<q>' said <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir. 'But I am glad that you will take this willingly and not by force.'</q></p>
<p>He called softly and immediately <name type="ORG">Mablung</name> and <name type="PERSON">Damrod</name> stepped out of the trees and came back to him. <q>'Blindfold these guests,'</q> said <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir. `Securely, but not so as to discomfort them. Do not tie their hands. They will give their word not to try and see. I could trust them to shut their eyes of their own accord, but eyes will blink, if the feet stumble. Lead them so that they do not falter.'</p>
<p>With green scarves the <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> guards now bound up the hobbits' eyes and drew their hoods down almost to their mouths; then quickly they took each <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> by the hand and went on their way. All that <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> knew of <name type="QUANTITY">this last mile</name> of the road they learned from guessing in the dark. After a little they found that they were on a path descending steeply; soon it grew so narrow that they went in single file, brushing a stony wall on either side; their guards steered them from behind with hands laid firmly on their shoulders. Now and again they came to rough places and were lifted from their feet for a while, and then set down again. Always the noise of the running water was on their <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght hand, and it grew nearer and louder. At length they were halted. Quickly <name type="ORG">Mablung</name> and <name type="PERSON">Damrod</name> turned them about, several times, and they lost all sense of direction. They climbed upwards a little: it seemed cold and the noise of the stream had become faint. Then they were picked up and car<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed down, down many steps, and round a corner. Suddenly they heard the water again, loud now, rushing and splashing. All round them it seemed, and they felt a fine rain on their hands and cheeks. At last they were set on their feet once more. For a moment they stood so, <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> fearful, blindfold, not knowing where they were; and no <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> spoke.</p>
<p>Then came the voice of <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir close behind. `Let them see! ' he said. The scarves were removed and their hoods drawn back, and they blinked and gasped.</p>
<p>They stood on a wet floor of polished st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, the doorstep, as it were, of a rough<name type="PERSON">-he</name>wn gate of rock opening dark behind them. But in front a thin veil of water was hung, so near that <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> could have put an outstretched arm into it. It faced westward. The level shafts of the setting sun behind beat upon it, and the red light was broken into many flicke<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng beams of ever-changing colour. It was as if they stood at the window of some <name type="ORG">elven</name>-tower, curtained with threaded jewels of silver and gold, and ruby, sapphire and amethyst, all kindled with an unconsuming fire.</p>
<p><q>'At least by good chance we came at the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght <name type="TIME">hour</name> to reward you for your patience,'</q> said <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir. `This is the Window of the <name type="ORG">Sun</name>set, <name type="ORG">Hen</name>neth <name type="PERSON">Ann�n</name>, fairest of all <name type="DATE">the fall</name>s of <name type="ORG">Ithil</name>ien, land of many fountains. Few strangers have ever seen it. But there is no kingly hall behind to match it. <name type="ORG">Ent</name>er now and see! '</p>
<p>Even as he spoke the sun sank, and the fire faded in the flowing water. They turned and passed under the low forbidding arch. At once they found themselves in a rock-chamber, wide and rough, with an uneven stooping roof. A few torches were kindled and cast a dim light on the glis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing walls. Many men were already there. Others were still coming in by <name type="CARDINAL">two</name>s and <name type="CARDINAL">three</name>s through a dark narrow door on <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> side. As their eyes grew accus<name type="PERSON">tom</name>ed to the gloom the hobbits saw that the cave was larger than they had guessed and was filled with great store of arms and victuals.</p>
<p><q>'Well, here is our refuge,'</q> said <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir. `Not a place of great ease but here you may pass the <name type="TIME">night</name> in peace. It is dry at least, and there is food, though no fire. At <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> time the water flowed down through this cave and out of the arch, but its course was changed further up the gorge, by workmen of old, and the stream sent down in a fall of doubled h<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name> over the rocks far above. All the ways into this grot were then sealed against the entry of water or aught else, all save <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. There are now but <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> ways out: that passage yonder by which you entered blindfold, and through the Window-curtain into a deep bowl filled with knives of st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. Now rest a while, until the <name type="TIME">evening</name> meal is set.'</p>
<p>The hobbits were taken to a corner and given a low bed to lie on, if they wished. Meanwhile men busied themselves about the cave, quietly and in orderly quickness. Light tables were taken from the walls and set up on trestles and laden with gear. This was plain and unadorned for the most part, but all well and fairly, made: round platters, bowls and dishes of glazed brown clay or turned box-wood, smooth and clean. Here and there was a cup or basin of polished bronze; and a goblet of plain silver was set by the Captain's seat in the middle of the inmost table.</p>
<p><name type="LOC">Far</name>amir went about among the men, questioning each as he came in, in a soft voice. Some came back from the pursuit of the <name type="LOC">South</name>rons; others, left behind as scouts near the road, came in latest. All the <name type="LOC">South</name>rons had been accounted for, save only the great m<name type="PERSON">�mak</name>: what happened to him n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> could say. Of the enemy no movement could be seen; not even an orc-spy was abroad.</p>
<p><q>'You saw and heard nothing, <name type="GPE">Anborn</name>?'</q> <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir asked of the latest comer.</p>
<p><name type="ORG">`Well</name>, no, lord,<q>' said the man. `No <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name> at least. But I saw, or thought I saw, something a little strange. It was getting deep <name type="TIME">dusk</name>, when the eyes make things greater than they should be. So perhaps it may have been no more than a squirrel.'</q> <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> p<name type="GPE">ri</name>cked up his ears at this. <q>'Yet if so, it was a black squirrel, and I saw no tail. 'Twas like a shadow on the ground, and it whisked behind a tree-trunk when I drew nigh and went up aloft as swift as any squirrel could. You will not have us slay wild beasts for no purpose, and it seemed no more, so I t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed no arrow. It was too dark for sure shooting anyway, and the creature was g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> into the gloom of the leaves in a twinkling. But I stayed for a while, for it seemed strange, and then I has<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed back. I thought I heard the thing hiss at me from high above as I turned away. A large squirrel, maybe. Perhaps under the shadow of the Unnamed some of the beasts of <name type="GPE">Mirkwood</name> are <name type="PERSON">wan</name>de<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng hither to our woods. They have black squirrels there, 'tis said.'</q></p>
<p>`Perhaps,<q>' said <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir. `But that would be an ill omen, if it were so. We do not <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t the escapes of <name type="GPE">Mirkwood</name> in <name type="ORG">Ithil</name>ien.'</q> <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> fancied that he gave a swift glance towards the hobbits as he spoke; but <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> said nothing. For a while he and <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> lay back and watched the torchlight, and the men moving to and fro speaking in hushed voices. Then suddenly <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> fell asleep.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> struggled with himself, arguing this way and that. <name type="PERSON">`He</name> may be all <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght,<q>' he thought, 'and then he may not. <name type="ORG">Fair</name> speech may hide a foul heart.'</q> He yawned. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> could sleep for <name type="DATE">a <name type="DATE">week</name></name>, and I'd be better for it. And what can I do, if I do keep awake, me all al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, and all these great <name type="ORG">Men</name> about? Nothing, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> <name type="PERSON">Gamgee</name>; but you've got to keep awake all the same.' And somehow he managed it. The light faded from the cave door, and the grey veil of falling water grew dim and was lost in gathe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng shadow. Always the sound of the water went on, never changing its note, <name type="TIME">morning</name> or <name type="TIME">evening</name> or <name type="TIME">night</name>. It murmured and whispered of sleep. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> stuck his knuckles in his eyes.</p>
<p>Now more torches were being lit. A cask of wine was broached. Storage barrels were being opened. <name type="ORG">Men</name> were fet<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g water from <name type="DATE">the fall</name>. Some were laving their hands in basins. A wide copper bowl and a white cloth were brought to <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir and he washed.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`Wake</name> our guests,<q>' he said, `and take them water. It is time to eat.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> sat up and yawned and stretched. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, not used to being waited on, looked with some surp<name type="GPE">ri</name>se at the tall man who bowed, holding a basin of water before him.</p>
<p><q>'Put it on the ground, master, if you please! ' he said. 'Easier for me and you.'</q> Then to the astonishment and amusement of the <name type="ORG">Men</name> he plunged his head into the cold water and splashed his neck and ears.</p>
<p>'Is it the cus<name type="PERSON">tom</name> in your land to wash the head before supper? ' said the man who waited on the hobbits.</p>
<p>`No, before breakfast,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. `But if you're short of sleep cold water on the neck's like rain on a wilted lettuce. There! Now I can keep awake long enough to eat a bit.'</q></p>
<p>They were led then to seats beside <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir: barrels covered with pelts and high enough above the benches of the <name type="ORG">Men</name> for their convenience. Before they ate, <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir and all his men turned and faced west in a moment of silence. <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir signed to <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> that they should do likewise.</p>
<p><q>'So we always do.'</q> he said, as they sat down: `we look towards N�menor that was, and beyond to <name type="ORG">Elven</name>home that is, and to that which is beyond <name type="ORG">Elven</name>home and will ever be. Have you no such cus<name type="PERSON">tom</name> at meat? '</p>
<p>`No,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, feeling strangely rustic and untutored. `But if we are guests, we bow to our host, and after we have ea<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> we <name type="GPE">ri</name>se and thank him.'</q></p>
<p><q>'That we do also,'</q> said <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir.</p>
<p>After so long journeying and camping, and <name type="DATE">day</name>s spent in the l<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>ly wild, the <name type="TIME">evening</name> meal seemed a feast to the hobbits: to d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk pale yellow wine, cool and fragrant, and eat bread and butter, and salted meats, and d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed fruits, and good red cheese, with clean hands and clean knives and plates. Neither <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> nor <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> refused anything that was offered, nor a <name type="ORG">sec</name>ond, nor indeed <name type="CARDINAL">a <name type="ORDINAL">third</name></name> helping. The wine coursed in their veins and tired limbs, and they felt glad and easy of heart as they had not <name type="PERSON">don</name>e since they left the land of L�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en.</p>
<p>When all was <name type="PERSON">don</name>e <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir led them to a recess at the back of the cave, partly screened by curtains; and a c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>r and <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> stools were brought there. A little <name type="LOC">earth</name>enware lamp burned in a niche.</p>
<p>`You may soon desire to sleep,<q>' he said, 'and especially good <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>wise, who would not close his eyes before he ate � whether for fear of blunting the edge of a noble hunger, or for fear of me, I do not know. But it is not good to sleep too soon after meat, and that following a fast. Let us talk a while. On your journey from <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name> there must have been many things to tell. And you, too, would perhaps wish to learn something of us and the lands where you now are. Tell me of <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> my brother, and of old <name type="LOC">Mithrandir</name>, and of the fair people of <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>thl�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> no longer felt sleepy and he was willing to talk. But though the food and wine had put him at his ease, he had not lost all his caution. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> was beaming and humming to himself, but when <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> spoke he was at <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> con<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>t to lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>, only occasionally ventu<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng to make an exclamation of agreement.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> told many tales, yet always he steered the matter away from the quest of the <name type="ORG">Company</name> and from the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>, enlarging rather on the valiant part <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> had played in all their adventures. with the wolves of the wild, in the snows under <name type="GPE">Caradhras</name>, and in the mines of <name type="GPE">Mo<name type="GPE">ri</name>a</name> where <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> fell. <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir was most moved by the story of the fight on the b<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`I</name>t must have irked <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> to run from <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s,<q>' he said, `or even from the fell thing you name, the <name type="GPE">Balrog</name> � even though he was the last to leave.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`He</name> was the last,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, 'but <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> was forced to lead us. He al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> knew the way after <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>'s fall. But had there not been us lesser folk to care for, I do not think that either he or <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> would have fled.'</q></p>
<p>`<name type="DATE">May</name>be, it would have been better had <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> fallen there with <name type="LOC">Mithrandir</name>,<q>' said <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir, `and not g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> on to the fate that waited above <name type="DATE">the fall</name>s of <name type="PERSON">Rauros</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="DATE">May</name>be. But tell me now of your own fortunes,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, turning the matter aside once again. `For I would learn more of Minas <name type="ORG">Ithil</name> and <name type="NORP">Osgiliath</name>, and Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name> the long-endu<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng. What hope have you for that city in your long war? '</p>
<p>'What hope have we? ' said <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir. 'It is long since we had any hope. The sword of <name type="PERSON">Elen</name>dil, if it returns indeed, may rekindle it, but I do not think that it will do more than put off the evil <name type="DATE">day</name>, unless other help unlooked-for also comes, from <name type="ORG">Elves</name> or <name type="ORG">Men</name>. For the Enemy increases and we decrease. We are a failing people, a sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ngless <name type="DATE">autumn</name>.</p>
<p>`The <name type="ORG">Men</name> of N�menor were settled far and wide on the shores and seaward regions of <name type="LOC">the Great Lands</name>, but for the most part they fell into evils and follies. Many became enamoured of the <name type="PRODUCT">Darkness</name> and the black arts; some were given over wholly to idleness and ease, and some fought among themselves, until they were conquered in their weakness by the wild men.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`I</name>t is not said that evil arts were ever practised in <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>, or that the Nameless <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> was ever named in honour there; and the old wisdom and beauty brought out of the <name type="LOC">West</name> remained long in the realm of the sons of <name type="PERSON">Elen</name>dil the <name type="ORG">Fair</name>, and they linger there still. Yet even so it was <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> that brought about its own decay, falling by degrees into dotage, and thinking that the Enemy was asleep, who was only banished not destroyed.</p>
<p>'Death was ever present, because the <name type="ORG">N�menoreans</name> still, as they had in their old kingdom, and so lost it, hungered after endless life unchanging. <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>gs made <name type="PERSON">tom</name>bs more splendid than houses of the living. and counted old names in the rolls of their descent dearer than the names of sons. <name type="PERSON">Childless lords</name> sat in aged halls musing on heraldry; in <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret chambers withered men compounded strong elixirs, or in high cold towers asked questions of the stars. And the last king of the line of An�<name type="GPE">ri</name>on had no heir.</p>
<p>`But the stewards were wiser and more fortunate. <name type="PERSON">Wise</name>r, for they recruited the strength of our people from the sturdy folk of the sea-coast, and from the hardy mountaineers of <name type="ORG">Ered Nimrais</name>. And they made a truce with the proud peoples of the <name type="LOC">North</name>, who of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> had assailed us, men of fierce valour, but our kin from afar off, unlike the wild <name type="LOC">East</name>erlings or the cruel <name type="ORG">Harad</name><name type="GPE">ri</name>m.</p>
<p>'So it came to pass in the <name type="DATE">day</name>s of Ci<name type="GPE">ri</name>on the Twelfth <name type="ORG">Steward</name> (and my father is the sit and twentieth) that they rode to our aid and at the great Field of <name type="PERSON">Celebrant</name> they destroyed our enemies that had seized our northern provinces. These are the Rohir<name type="GPE">ri</name>m, as we name them, masters of horses, and we ceded to them the fields of <name type="ORG">Calenardhon</name> that are since called <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>; for that province had long been sparsely peopled. And they became our allies, and have ever proved true to us, aiding us at need, and guarding our northern <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ches and the <name type="ORG">Gap</name> of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>.</p>
<p>`Of our lore and manners they have learned what they would, and their lords speak our speech at need; yet for the most part they hold by the ways of their own fathers and to their own memo<name type="GPE">ri</name>es, and they speak among themselves their own <name type="LOC">North</name> tongue. And we love them: tall men and fair women, valiant both alike, golden-<name type="PERSON">hai</name>red, b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght-eyed, and strong; they remind us of the youth of <name type="ORG">Men</name>, as they were in the <name type="DATE">Elder Days</name>. Indeed it is said by our lore-masters that they have from of old this affinity with us that they are come from those same <name type="PERSON">Thr</name>ee <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>uses of <name type="ORG">Men</name> as were the <name type="ORG">N�menoreans</name> in their beginning not from <name type="ORG">Hador</name> the Golden<name type="PERSON">hai</name>red, the <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name>-f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end, maybe, yet from such of his sons and people as went not over <name type="LOC">Sea</name> into the <name type="LOC">West</name>, refusing the call.</p>
<p>'For so we reckon <name type="ORG">Men</name> in our lore, calling them the High, or <name type="ORG">Men</name> of the <name type="LOC">West</name>, which were <name type="ORG">N�menoreans</name>; and <name type="ORG">the Middle Peoples</name>, <name type="ORG">Men</name> of the <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Twilight</name>, such as are the Rohir<name type="GPE">ri</name>m and their kin that dwell still far in the <name type="LOC">North</name>; and the Wild, the <name type="ORG">Men</name> of <name type="PRODUCT">Darkness</name>.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`Yet</name> now, if the Rohir<name type="GPE">ri</name>m are grown in some ways more like to us, enhanced in arts and gentleness, we too have become more like to them, and can scarce claim any longer the title High. We are become Middle <name type="ORG">Men</name>, of the <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Twilight</name>, but with memory of other things. For as the Rohir<name type="GPE">ri</name>m do, we now love war and valour as things good in themselves, both a sport and an end; and though we still hold that a war<name type="GPE">ri</name>or should have more skills and knowledge than only the craft of weapons and slaying, we esteem a war<name type="GPE">ri</name>or, n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>theless, above men of other crafts. Such is the need of our <name type="DATE">day</name>s. So even was my brother, <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>: a man of prowess, and for that he was accounted the best man in <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>. And very valiant indeed he was: no heir of Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name> has for <name type="DATE">long <name type="DATE">year</name>s</name> been so hardy in toil, so onward into battle, or blown a mightier note on the Great <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>rn.' <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir sighed and fell silent for a while.</p>
<p>`You <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t say much in all your tales about the <name type="ORG">Elves</name>, sir,' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, suddenly plucking up courage. He had noted that <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir seemed to refer to <name type="ORG">Elves</name> with reverence, and this even more than his courtesy, and his food and wine, had won <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>'s respect and quieted his suspicions.</p>
<p>`No indeed, <name type="PERSON">Master <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>wise</name>,' said <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir, `for I am not learned in <name type="ORG">Elven</name>-lore. But there you touch upon another point in which we have changed, declining from N�menor to <name type="LOC">Middle-<name type="LOC">earth</name></name>. For as you may know, if <name type="LOC">Mithrandir</name> was your companion and you have spoken with <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name>, the Edain, the Fathers of the <name type="ORG">N�menoreans</name>, fought beside the <name type="ORG">Elves</name> in the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> wars, and were rewarded by the gift of the kingdom in the midst of the <name type="LOC">Sea</name>, within sight of <name type="ORG">Elven</name>home. But in <name type="LOC">Middle-<name type="LOC">earth</name></name> <name type="ORG">Men</name> and <name type="ORG">Elves</name> became estranged in the <name type="DATE">day</name>s of darkness, by the arts of the Enemy, and by the slow changes of time in which each kind walked further down their sundered roads. <name type="ORG">Men</name> now fear and misdoubt the <name type="ORG">Elves</name>, and yet know little of them. And we of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> grow like other <name type="ORG">Men</name>, like the men of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>; for even they, who are the foes of the Dark <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd, shun the <name type="ORG">Elves</name> and speak of the Golden <name type="PERSON">Wood</name> with dread.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`Yet</name> there are among us still some who have dealings with the <name type="ORG">Elves</name> when they may, and ever and anon <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> will go in <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret to L�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en, seldom to return. Not I. For I deem it pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>lous now for mortal man wilfully to seek out the Elder People. Yet I envy you that have spoken with the White <name type="PERSON">Lady</name>.'</p>
<p>`The <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> of L�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en! <name type="PERSON">Galad<name type="GPE">ri</name>el</name>!<q>' c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. `You should see her indeed you should, sir. I am only a hobbit, and gardening's my job at home, sir, if you understand me, and I'm not much good at poetry � not at making it: a bit of a comic rhyme, perhaps. now and again, you know, but not real poetry � so I can't tell you what I mean. It ought to be sung. You'd have to get <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>, <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> that is, or old Mr. <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>, for that. But I wish I could make a song about her. Beautiful she is, sir! <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>vely! Sometimes like a great tree in flower, sometimes like a white daffadowndilly, small and slender like. Hard as di'monds, soft as moonlight. Warm as sunlight, cold as frost in the stars. Proud and far-off as a snow-mountain, and as merry as any lass I ever saw with daisies in her <name type="PERSON">hai</name>r in sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ngtime. But that's a lot o' nonsense, and all wide of my <name type="PERSON">mar</name>k.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Then she must be lovely indeed,'</q> said <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir. `<name type="NORP">Pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>lously</name> fair.'</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`I</name> <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t know about _pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>lous_,' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>t st<name type="GPE">ri</name>kes me that folk takes their pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>l with them into L�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en, and finds it there because they've brought it. But perhaps you could call her pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>lous, because she's so strong in herself. You, you could dash yourself to pieces on her, like a ship on a rock; or drownd yourself, like a hobbit in a <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver. But neither rock nor <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver would be to blame. Now <name type="PERSON">Boro �</name> ' He stopped and went red in the face.</p>
<p>`Yes? _Now <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>_you would say? ' said <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir. `What would you say? He took his pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>l with him? '</p>
<p>`Yes sir, begging your par<name type="PERSON">don</name>, and a fine man as your brother was if I may say so. But you've been warm on the scent all along. Now I watched <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> and lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed to him, from <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name> all down the road � looking after my master, as you'll understand, and not meaning any harm to <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> � and it's my opinion that in L�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en he <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> saw clearly what I guessed so<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>r: what he <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ted. From the moment he <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> saw it he <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ted the Enemy's <name type="ORG">Ring</name>! '</p>
<p>`<name type="PERSON">Sam</name>! ' c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> aghast. He had fallen deep into his own thoughts for a while, and came out of them suddenly and too late.</p>
<p>'Save me! ' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> turning white, and then flushing scarlet. `There I go again! _When ever you open your big mouth you put your foot in it the <name type="PERSON">Gaffer</name> used to say to me_, and <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght enough. O dear, O dear!</p>
<p>`Now look here, sir! <q>' He turned, facing <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name> <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir with all the courage that he could muster. `<name type="PERSON">Don</name>'t you go taking advantage of my master because his servant's no better than a fool. You've spoken very handsome all along, put me off my guard, talking of <name type="ORG">Elves</name> and all. But _handsome is as handsome does_ we say. Now's a chance to show your quality.'</q></p>
<p><q>'So it seems,'</q> said <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir, slowly and very softly, with a strange smile. `So that is the answer to all the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ddles! The <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> <name type="ORG">Ring</name> that was thought to have pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>shed from the world. And <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed to take it by force? And you escaped? And ran all the way � to me! And here in the wild I have you: <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> <name type="CARDINAL">half</name>lings, and a host of men at my call, and the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> of <name type="ORG">Ring</name>s. A pretty stroke of fortune! A chance for <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir, Captain of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>, to show his quality! Ha!' He stood up, very tall and stern, his grey eyes glinting.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> sprang from their stools and set themselves side by side with their backs to the wall, fumbling for their sword-hilts. There was a silence. All the men in the cave stopped talking and looked towards them in wonder. But <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir sat down again in his c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>r and began to laugh quietly, and then suddenly became grave again.</p>
<p>'<name type="PERSON">Alas</name> for <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>! It was too sore a t<name type="GPE">ri</name>al! ' he said. `<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w you have increased my sorrow, you <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> strange <name type="PERSON">wan</name>derers from a far country, bea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng the pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>l of <name type="ORG">Men</name>! But you are less judges of <name type="ORG">Men</name> than I of <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>flings. We are truth-speakers, we men of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>. We boast seldom, and then perform, or die in the attempt._ Not if I found it on the highway would I take it_ I said. Even if I were such a man as to desire this thing, and even though I knew not clearly what this thing was when I spoke, still I should take those words as a vow, and be held by them.</p>
<p><q>'But I am not such a man. Or I am wise enough to know that there are some pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ls from which a man must flee. Sit at peace! And be comforted, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>wise. If you seem to have stumbled, think that it was fated to be so. Your heart is shrewd as well as faithful, and saw clearer than your eyes. For strange though it may seem, it was safe to declare this to me. It may even help the master that you love. It shall turn to his good, if it is in my power. So be comforted. But do not even name this thing again aloud. Once is enough.'</q></p>
<p>The hobbits came back to their seats and sat very quiet. <name type="ORG">Men</name> turned back to their d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk and their talk, perceiving that their captain had had some jest or other with the little guests, and that it was over.</p>
<p><q>'Well, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, now at last we understand <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> another,'</q> said <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir. <q>'If you took this thing on yourself, unwilling, at others' asking, then you have pity and honour from me. And I <name type="PERSON">mar</name>vel at you: to keep it hid and not to use it. You are a new people and a new world to me. Are all your kin of like sort? Your land must be a realm of peace and con<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>t, and there must gardeners be in high honour.'</q></p>
<p>`Not all is well there,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, `but certainly gardeners are honoured.'</q></p>
<p>`But folk must grow weary there, even in their gardens, as do all things under the <name type="ORG">Sun</name> of this world. And you are far from home and wayworn. No more to<name type="TIME">night</name>. Sleep, both of you � in peace, if you can. Fear not! I do not wish to see it, or touch it, or know more of it than I know (which is enough), lest pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>l perchance waylay me and I fall lower in the test than <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> son of <name type="ORG">Drogo</name>. Go now to rest � but <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> tell me only, if you will, whither you wish to go, and what to do. For I must watch, and wait, and think. <name type="PERSON">Tim</name>e passes. In the <name type="TIME">morning</name> we must each go swiftly on the ways appointed to us.'</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> had felt himself trembling as the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> shock of fear passed. Now a great wea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ness came down on him like a cloud. He could dissemble and resist no longer.</p>
<p><q>'I was going to find a way into <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>,'</q> he said faintly. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> was going to <name type="PERSON">Gorgoroth</name>. I must find the <name type="LOC">Mountain</name> of <name type="ORG">Fire</name> and cast the thing into the <name type="LOC">gulf</name> of Doom. <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> said so. I do not think I shall ever get there.'</p>
<p><name type="LOC">Far</name>amir stared at him for a moment in grave astonishment. Then suddenly he caught him as he swayed, and lifting him gently, car<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed him to the bed and laid him there, and covered him warmly. At once he fell into a deep sleep.</p>
<p>Another bed was set beside him for his servant. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> hesitated for a moment, then bowing very low: `<name type="TIME">Good <name type="TIME">night</name></name>, Captain, my lord,<q>' he said. `You took the chance, sir.'</q></p>
<p>`Did I so?' said <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir.</p>
<p>`Yes sir, and showed your quality: the very highest.'</p>
<p><name type="LOC">Far</name>amir smiled. <q>'A pert servant, <name type="PERSON">Master <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>wise</name>. But nay: the praise of the praiseworthy is above all rewards. Yet there was naught in this to praise. I had no lure or desire to do other than I have <name type="PERSON">don</name>e.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`A</name>h well, sir,' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, `you said my master had an elvish air and that was good and true. But I can say this: you have an air too, sir, that reminds me of, of � well, <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, of wizards.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="DATE">May</name>be,'</q> said <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir. `<name type="DATE">May</name>be you discern from far away the air of N�menor. <name type="TIME">Good <name type="TIME">night</name></name>!'</p>

<p>The Forbidden Pool</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> woke to find <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir bending over him. For a <name type="ORG">sec</name>ond old fears seized him and he sat up and shrank away.</p>
<p>`There is nothing to fear,' said <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir.</p>
<p>'Is it <name type="TIME">morning</name> already? ' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> yawning.</p>
<p>`Not yet, but <name type="TIME">night</name> is drawing to an end, and <name type="TIME">the full moon</name> is setting. Will you come and see it? Also there is a matter on which I desire your counsel. I am sorry to rouse you from sleep, but will you come? '</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`I</name> will,' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing and shive<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng a little as he left the warm blanket and pelts. It seemed cold in the fireless cave. The noise of the water was loud in the stillness. He put on his cloak and followed <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, waking suddenly by some instinct of watchfulness, saw <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> his master's empty bed and leapt to his feet. Then he saw <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> dark figures, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and a man, framed against the archway, which was now filled with a pale white light. He hur<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed after them, past rows of men sleeping on mattresses along the wall. As he went by the cave-mouth he saw that the Curtain was now become a dazzling veil of silk and pearls and silver thread: melting icicles of moonlight. But he did not pause to admire it, and turning aside he followed his master through the narrow doorway in the wall of the cave.</p>
<p>They went <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> along a black passage, then up many wet steps, and so came to a small flat landing cut in the st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> and lit by the pale sky, gleaming high above through a long deep shaft. From here <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> flights of steps led: <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> going on, as it seemed, up on to the high bank of the stream; the other turning away to the left. This they followed. It wound its way up like a turret-stair.</p>
<p>At last they came out of the stony darkness and looked about. They were on a wide flat rock without rail or parapet. At their <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght, eastwards, the torrent fell, splashing over many terraces, and then, pou<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng down a steep race, it filled a smooth<name type="PERSON">-he</name>wn channel with a dark force of water flecked with foam, and curling and rushing almost at their feet it plunged sheer over the edge that yawned upon their left. A man stood there, near the b<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk, silent, gazing down.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> turned to watch the sleek necks of the water as they curved and dived. Then he lifted his eyes and gazed far away. The world was quiet and cold, as if <name type="TIME">dawn</name> were near. <name type="LOC">Far</name> off in the <name type="LOC">West</name> <name type="TIME">the full moon</name> was sinking, round and white. Pale mists shimmered in the great <name type="GPE">vale</name> below: a wide <name type="LOC">gulf</name> of silver fume, beneath which rolled the cool <name type="TIME">night</name>-waters of the <name type="GPE">Anduin</name>. A black darkness loomed beyond, and in it glinted, here and there, cold, sharp, remote, white as the teeth of ghosts, the peaks of <name type="ORG">Ered Nimrais</name>, the White <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s of the Realm of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>, tipped with everlasting snow.</p>
<p>For a while <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> stood there on the high st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, and a shiver ran through him, wonde<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng if anywhere in the vastness of the <name type="TIME">night</name>-lands his old companions walked or slept, or lay dead shrouded in mist. Why was he brought here out of forgetful sleep?</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> was eager for an answer to the same question and could not refrain himself from mutte<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng, for his master's ear al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> as he thought: 'It's a fine view, no doubt, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, but chilly to the heart, not to mention the b<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s! What's going on? '</p>
<p><name type="LOC">Far</name>amir heard and answered. `<name type="PERSON">Moon</name>set over <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>. <name type="ORG">Fair</name> <name type="ORG">Ithil</name> as he goes from <name type="LOC">Middle-<name type="LOC">earth</name></name>, glances upon the white locks of old <name type="GPE">Min<name type="PERSON">dol</name>luin</name>. It is worth a few shivers. But that is not what I brought you to see-though as for you, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>wise, you were not brought, and do but pay the penalty of your watchfulness. A draught of wine shall amend it. Come, look now! '</p>
<p>He stepped up beside the silent sentinel on the dark edge. and <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> followed. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> hung back. He already felt in<name type="ORG">sec</name>ure enough on this high wet platform. <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir and <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> looked down. <name type="LOC">Far</name> below them they saw the white waters pour into a foaming bowl, and then swirl darkly about a deep oval basin in the rocks. until they found their way out again through a narrow gate, and flowed away, fuming and chatte<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng, into calmer and more level reaches. The moonlight still slanted down to <name type="DATE">the fall</name>'s foot and gleamed on the <name type="GPE">ri</name>pples of the basin. Presently <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> was aware of a small dark thing on the near bank, but even as he looked at it, it dived and vanished just beyond the boil and bubble of <name type="DATE">the fall</name>, cleaving the black water as neatly as an arrow or an edgewise st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>.</p>
<p><name type="LOC">Far</name>amir turned to the man at his side. `Now what would you say that it is, <name type="GPE">Anborn</name>? A squirrel, or a kingfisher? Are there black kingfishers in the <name type="TIME">night</name>-pools of <name type="GPE">Mirkwood</name>? '</p>
<p>`<q>'<name type="ORG">Tis</name> not a bird, whatever else it be,'</q> answered <name type="GPE">Anborn</name>. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>t has <name type="CARDINAL">four</name> limbs and dives manwise; a pretty mastery of the craft it shows, too. What is it at? Seeking a way up behind the Curtain to our hidings? It seems we are discovered at last. I have my bow here, and I have posted other archers, nigh as good <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ksmen as myself, on either bank. We wait only for your command to shoot, Captain.'</p>
<p>`Shall we shoot? ' said <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir, turning quickly to <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> did not answer for a moment. Then `No! <q>' he said. `No! I beg you not to.'</q> If <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> had dared, he would have said `Yes,' quicker and louder. He could not see, but he guessed well enough from their words what they were looking at.</p>
<p><q>'You know, then, what this thing is? ' said <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir. `Come, now you have seen, tell me why it should be spared. In all our words together you have not once spoken of your gangrel companion, and I let him be for the time. He could wait till he was caught and brought before me. I sent my keenest huntsmen to seek him, but he slipped them, and they had no sight of him till now, save <name type="GPE">Anborn</name> here, once at <name type="TIME">dusk</name> yester<name type="TIME">evening</name>. But now he has <name type="PERSON">don</name>e worse trespass than only to go <name type="PERSON">c<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>y</name>-sna<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng in the uplands: he has dared to come to <name type="ORG">Hen</name>neth <name type="PERSON">Ann�n</name>, and his life is forfeit. I <name type="PERSON">mar</name>vel at the creature: so <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret and so sly as he is, to come sporting in the pool before our very window. Does he think that men sleep without watch <name type="TIME">all <name type="TIME">night</name></name>? Why does he so?'</q></p>
<p><q>'There are <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> answers, I think,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. `For <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> thing, he knows little of <name type="ORG">Men</name>, and sly though he is, your refuge is so hidden that perhaps he does not know that <name type="ORG">Men</name> are concealed here. For another, I think he is allured here by a maste<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng desire, stronger than his caution.'</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`He</name> is lured here, you say? ' said <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir in a low voice. `Can he, does he then know of your burden? '</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`I</name>ndeed yes. He bore it himself for <name type="DATE">many <name type="DATE">year</name>s</name>.'</p>
<p>'_He_ bore it? ' said <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir, breathing sharply in his wonder. `This matter winds itself ever in new <name type="GPE">ri</name>ddles. Then he is pursuing it? '</p>
<p><q>'<name type="DATE">May</name>be. It is precious to him. But I did not speak of that.'</q></p>
<p>`What then does the creature seek? '</p>
<p>`Fish,' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. `<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok! '</p>
<p>They peered down at the dark pool. A little black head appeared at the far end of the basin, just out of the deep shadow of the rocks. There was a b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ef silver glint, and a swirl of tiny <name type="GPE">ri</name>pples. It swam to the side, and then with <name type="PERSON">mar</name>vellous agility a froglike figure climbed out of the water and up the bank. At once it sat down and began to gnaw at the small silver thing that glittered as it turned: the last rays of the moon were now falling behind the stony wall at the pool's end.</p>
<p><name type="LOC">Far</name>amir laughed softly. `Fish! <q>' he said. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>t is a less pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>lous hunger. Or maybe not: fish from the pool of <name type="ORG">Hen</name>neth <name type="PERSON">Ann�n</name> may cost him all he has to give.'</q></p>
<p>`Now I have him at the arrow-point,<q>' said <name type="GPE">Anborn</name>. `Shall I not shoot, Captain? For coming unbidden to this place death is our law.'</q></p>
<p>`Wait, <name type="GPE">Anborn</name>,' said <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir. `This is a harder matter than it seems. What have you to say now, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>? Why should we spare? '</p>
<p>`The creature is wretched and hungry,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, `and unaware of his danger. And <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, your <name type="LOC">Mithrandir</name>, he would have bidden you not to slay him for that reason, and for others. He forbade the <name type="ORG">Elves</name> to do so. I do not know clearly why, and of what I guess I cannot speak openly out here. But this creature is in some way bound up with my errand. Until you found us and took us, he was my guide.'</q></p>
<p>`Your guide! ' said <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir. `The matter becomes ever stranger. I would do much for you, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, but this I cannot grant: to let this sly <name type="PERSON">wan</name>derer go free at his own will from here, to join you later if it please him, or to be caught by <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s and tell all he knows under threat of pain. He must be slain or taken. Slain, if he be not taken very swiftly. But how can this slippery thing of many guises be caught, save by a feathered shaft? '</p>
<p>`Let me go down quietly to him,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. `You may keep your bows bent, and shoot me at least, if I fail. I shall not run away.'</q></p>
<p><name type="ORG">`Go</name> then and be swift! <q>' said <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>f he comes off alive, he should be your faithful servant for the rest of his unhappy <name type="DATE">day</name>s. Lead <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> down to the bank, <name type="GPE">Anborn</name>, and go softly. The thing has a nose and ears. Give me your bow.'</q></p>
<p><name type="GPE">Anborn</name> grunted and led the way down the winding stair to the landing, and then up the other stair, until at last they came to a narrow opening shrouded with thick <name type="PERSON">bush</name>es. Passing silently through, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> found himself on the top of the southern bank above the pool. It was now dark and <name type="DATE">the fall</name>s were pale and grey, reflecting only the linge<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng moonlight of the western sky. He could not see <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>. He went forward a short way and <name type="GPE">Anborn</name> came softly behind him.</p>
<p><name type="ORG">`Go</name> on! <q>' he breathed in <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s ear. `Have a care to your <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght. If you fall in the pool, then no <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> but your fishing f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end can help you. And forget not that there are bowmen near at hand, though you may not see them.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> crept forward, using his hands <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>-like to feel his way and to steady himself. The rocks were for the most part flat and smooth but slippery. He halted lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing. At <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> he could hear no sound but the unceasing rush of <name type="DATE">the fall</name> behind him. Then presently he heard, not far ahead, a hissing murmur.</p>
<p>'<name type="ORG">Fissh</name>, nice fissh. White Face has vanished, my precious, at last, yes. Now we can eat fish in peace. No, not in peace, precious. For Precious is lost; yes, lost. Dirty hobbits, nasty hobbits. G<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> and left us, _<name type="PERSON">gollum</name>_; and Precious is g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. Only poor Sm�agol all al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. No Precious. Nasty <name type="ORG">Men</name>, they'll take it, steal my Precious. Thieves. We hates them. <name type="ORG">Fissh</name>, nice fissh: Makes us strong. Makes eyes b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght, fingers tight, yes. <name type="PERSON">Thr</name>ottle them, precious. <name type="PERSON">Thr</name>ottle them all, yes, if we gets chances. <name type="GPE">Nice</name> fissh. <name type="GPE">Nice</name> fissh! '</p>
<p>So it went on, almost as unceasing as the waterfall, only interrupted by a faint noise of slave<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng and gurgling. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> shivered, lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing with pity and disgust. He wished it would stop, and that he never need hear that voice again. <name type="GPE">Anborn</name> was not far behind. He could creep back and ask him to get the huntsmen to shoot. They would probably get close enough, while <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> was gorging and off his guard. Only <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> true shot, and <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> would be <name type="GPE">ri</name>d of the miserable voice for ever. But no, <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> had a claim on him now. The servant has a claim on the master for service, even service in fear. They would have foundered in the Dead <name type="LOC">Marshes</name> but for <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> knew, too, somehow, quite clearly that <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> would not have wished it.</p>
<p>`Sm�agol! ' he said softly.</p>
<p>`<name type="ORG">Fissh</name>, nice fissh,' said the voice.</p>
<p>`Sm�agol! ' he said, a little louder. The voice stopped.</p>
<p>`Sm�agol, Master has come to look for you. Master is here. Come, Sm�agol! ' There was no answer but a soft hiss, as of <name type="ORG">intaken</name> breath.</p>
<p><q>'Come, Sm�agol! ' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. `We are in danger. <name type="ORG">Men</name> will kill you, if they find you here. Come quickly, if you wish to escape death. Come to Master!'</q></p>
<p><q>'No!'</q> said the voice. `Not nice Master. Leaves poor Sm�agol and goes with new f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends. Master can wait. Sm�agol hasn't finished.'</p>
<p>`There's no time,' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. `B<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng fish with you. Come! '</p>
<p>`No! Must finish fish.'</p>
<p>'Sm�agol! ' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> desperately. 'Precious will be angry. I shall take Precious, and I shall say: make him swallow the b<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s and choke. Never taste fish again. Come, Precious is waiting! '</p>
<p>There was a sharp hiss. Presently out of the darkness <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> came crawling on all <name type="CARDINAL">four</name>s, like an er<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng dog called to heel. He had a <name type="CARDINAL">half</name>-ea<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> fish in his mouth and another in his hand. He came close to <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, almost nose to nose, and snif<name type="ORG">fed</name> at him. His pale eyes were shining. Then he took the fish out of his mouth and stood up.</p>
<p>`<name type="GPE">Nice</name> Master! ' he whispered. `<name type="GPE">Nice</name> hobbit, come back to poor Sm�agol. Good Sm�agol comes. Now let's go, go quickly, yes. <name type="PERSON">Thr</name>ough the trees, while the Faces are dark. Yes, come let's go! '</p>
<p>`Yes, we'll go soon,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. `But not at once. I will go with you as I promised. I promise again. But not now. You are not safe yet. I will save you, but you must trust me.'</q></p>
<p>`We must trust Master? <q>' said <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> doubtfully. 'Why? Why not go at once? Where is the other <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, the cross rude hobbit? Where is he?'</q></p>
<p><q>'Away up there,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, pointing to the waterfall. <q>'I am not going without him. We must go back to him.'</q> His heart sank. This was too much like t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ckery. He did not really fear that <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir would allow <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> to be killed, but he would probably make him p<name type="GPE">ri</name>s<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>r and bind him; and certainly what <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> did would seem a treachery to the poor treacherous creature. It would probably be impossible ever to make him understand or believe that <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> had saved his life in the only way he could. What else could he do? � to keep faith, as near as might be, with both sides. `Come!' he said. `Or the Precious will be angry. We are going back now, up the stream. Go on, go on, you go in front! '</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> crawled along close to the b<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk for a little way, snuffling and suspicious. Presently he stopped and raised his head. `Something's there! <q>' he said. `Not a hobbit.'</q> Suddenly he turned back. A green light was flicke<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng in his bulging eyes. `<name type="PERSON">Masster</name>, <name type="PERSON">masster</name>!<q>' he hissed. 'Wicked! <name type="PERSON">T<name type="GPE">ri</name>cksy</name>! False!'</q> He spat and stretched out his long arms with white snapping fingers.</p>
<p>At that moment the great black shape of <name type="GPE">Anborn</name> loomed up behind him and came down on him. A large strong hand took him in the nape of the neck and pinned him. He twisted round like lightning, all wet and slimy as he was, w<name type="GPE">ri</name>ggling like an eel, biting and scrat<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g like a cat. But <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> more men came up out of the shadows.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>ld still! ' said <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. `Or we'll stick you as full of pins as a hedgehog. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>ld still!'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> went limp, and began to whine and weep. They tied him, n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> too gently.</p>
<p>`Easy, easy! ' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <name type="PERSON">`He</name> has no strength to match you. <name type="PERSON">Don</name>'t hurt him, if you can help it. He'll be quieter, if you <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t. Sm�agol! They won't hurt you. I'll go with you, and you shall come to no harm. Not unless they kill me too. Trust Master! '</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> turned and spat at him. The men picked him up, put a hood over his eyes, and car<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed him off.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> followed them, feeling very wretched. They went through the opening behind the <name type="PERSON">bush</name>es. and back, down the stairs and passages, into the cave. <name type="CARDINAL">Two</name> or <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> torches had been lit. <name type="ORG">Men</name> were stir<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> was there, and he gave a queer look at the limp bundle that the men car<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed. <name type="ORG">`Go</name>t him?' he said to <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.</p>
<p><q>'Yes. Well no, I didn't get him. He came to me, because he trusted me at <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>, I'm afraid. I did not <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t him tied up like this. I hope it will be all <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght; but I hate the whole business.'</q></p>
<p>`So do I,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <name type="PERSON">`A</name>nd nothing will ever be all <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght where that piece of misery is.'</q></p>
<p>A man came and beck<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>d to the hobbits, and took them to the recess at the back of the cave. <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir was sitting there in his c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>r, and the lamp had been rekindled in its niche above his head. He signed to them to sit down on the stools beside him. `B<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng wine for the guests,<q>' he said. <name type="PERSON">`A</name>nd b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng the p<name type="GPE">ri</name>s<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>r to me.'</q></p>
<p>The wine was brought, and then <name type="GPE">Anborn</name> came carrying <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>. He removed the cover from <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>'s head and set him on his feet standing behind him to support him. <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> blinked, hooding the malice of his eyes with their heavy pale lids. A very miserable creature he looked, d<name type="GPE">ri</name>pping and dank, smelling of fish (he still clutched <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> in his hand); his sparse locks were hanging like rank weed over his bony brows, his nose was snivelling.</p>
<p>`<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ose us! <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ose us! <q>' he said. `The cord hurts us, yes it does, it hurts us, and we've <name type="PERSON">don</name>e nothing.'</q></p>
<p>`Nothing? <q>' said <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir, looking at the wretched creature with a keen glance, but without any expression in his face either of anger, or pity, or wonder. 'Nothing? Have you never <name type="PERSON">don</name>e anything worthy of binding or of worse punishment? <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>wever, that is not for me to judge, happily. But to<name type="TIME">night</name> you have come where it is death to come. The fish of this pool are dearly bought.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> dropped the fish from his hand. `<name type="PERSON">Don</name>'t <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t fish,' he said.</p>
<p><q>'The p<name type="GPE">ri</name>ce is not set on the fish,'</q> said <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir. `Only to come here and look on the pool bears the penalty of death. I have spared you so far at the prayer of <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> here, who says that of him at least you have deserved some thanks. But you must also satisfy me. What is your name? Whence do you come? And whither do you go? What is your business? '</p>
<p>`We are lost, lost,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>. 'No name, no business, no Precious, nothing. Only empty. Only hungry; yes, we are hungry. A few little fishes, nasty bony little fishes, for a poor creature, and they say death. So wise they are; so just, so very just.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Not very wise,'</q> said <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir. 'But just: yes perhaps, as just as our little wisdom allows. <name type="PERSON">Unloose</name> him <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>! ' <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir took a small nail-knife from his belt and handed it to <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> misunderstanding the gesture, squealed and fell down.</p>
<p><q>'Now, Sm�agol! ' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. 'You must trust me. I will not desert you. Answer truthfully, if you can. It will do you good not harm.'</q> He cut the cords on <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>'s w<name type="GPE">ri</name>sts and ankles and raised him to his feet.</p>
<p>'Come hither! ' said <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir. `<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok at me! Do you know the name of this place? Have you been here before? '</p>
<p>Slowly <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> raised his eyes and looked unwillingly into <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir's. All light went out of them, and they stared bleak and pale for a moment into the clear unwave<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng eyes of the man of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>. There was a still silence. Then <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> dropped his head and shrank down, until he was squatting on the floor, shive<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng. <q>'We doesn't know and we doesn't <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t to know,'</q> he whimpered. `Never came here; never come again.'</p>
<p>`There are locked doors and closed windows in your mind, and dark rooms behind them,<q>' said <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir. `But in this I judge that you speak the truth. It is well for you. What oath will you swear never to return; and never to lead any living creature hither by word or sign?'</q></p>
<p>`Master knows,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> with a sidelong glance at <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. `Yes, he knows. We will promise Master, if he saves us. We'll promise to It, yes.'</q> He crawled to <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s feet. <q>'Save us, nice Master! ' he whined. `Sm�agol promises to Precious, promises faithfully. Never come again, never speak, no never! No, precious, no!'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`A</name>re you satisfied? ' said <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir.</p>
<p>`Yes,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. 'At least, you must either accept this promise or carry out your law. You will get no more. But I promised that if he came to me, he should not be harmed. And I would not be proved faithless.'</q></p>
<p><name type="LOC">Far</name>amir sat for a moment in thought. `Very good,' he said at last. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> surrender you to your master, to <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> son of <name type="ORG">Drogo</name>. Let him declare what he will do with you! '</p>
<p><q>'But, <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> bowing, `you have not yet declared your will concerning the said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, and until that is made known, he cannot shape his plans for himself or his companions. Your judgement was postp<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>d until the <name type="TIME">morning</name>; but that is now at hand.'</p>
<p>`Then I will declare my doom,' said <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir. <name type="PERSON">`A</name>s for you, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, in so far as lies in me under higher autho<name type="GPE">ri</name>ty, I declare you free in the realm of, <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> to the furthest of its ancient bounds; save only that neither you nor any that go with you have leave to come to this place unbidden. This doom shall stand for <name type="DATE">a <name type="DATE">year</name></name> and <name type="DATE">a <name type="DATE">day</name></name>, and then cease, unless you shall before that term come to Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name> and present yourself to the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd and <name type="ORG">Steward</name> of the <name type="LOC">City</name>. Then I will entreat him to confirm what I have <name type="PERSON">don</name>e and to make it lifelong. In the meantime, whomsoever you take under your protection shall be under my protection and under the shield of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>. Are you answered? '</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> bowed low. <q>'I am answered,'</q> he said, `and I place myself at your service, if that is of any worth to <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> so high and honourable.'</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`I</name>t is of great worth,' said <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir. 'And now, do you take this creature, this Sm�agol, under your protection? '</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`I</name> do take Sm�agol under my protection,' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> sighed audibly; and not at the courtesies, of which, as any hobbit would, he thoroughly approved. Indeed in the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> such a matter would have required a great many more words and bows.</p>
<p><q>'Then I say to you,'</q> said <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir, turning to <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>, 'you are under doom of death; but while you walk with <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> you are safe for our part. Yet if ever you be found by any man of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> astray without him, the doom shall fall. And may death find you swiftly, within <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> or without, if you do not well serve him. Now answer me: whither would you go? You were his guide, he says. Whither were you leading him? ' <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> made no reply.</p>
<p>`This I will not have <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret,' said <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir. <name type="PERSON">`A</name>nswer me, or I will reverse my judgement! ' Still <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> did not answer.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`I</name> will answer for him,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <name type="PERSON">`He</name> brought me to the <name type="ORG">Black</name> <name type="FAC">Gate</name>, as I asked; but it was impassable.'</q></p>
<p>`There is no open gate into <name type="WORK_OF_ART">the Nameless Land</name>,' said <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir.</p>
<p>`Seeing this, we turned aside and came by the <name type="LOC">South</name>ward road <q>' <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> continued; 'for he said that there is, or there may be, a path near to Minas <name type="ORG">Ithil</name>.'</q></p>
<p>`Minas <name type="PERSON">Morgul</name>,' said <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`I</name> do not know clearly,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>; `but the path climbs, I think, up into the mountains on the northern side of that <name type="GPE">vale</name> where the old city stands. It goes <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name> a high cleft and so down to � that which is beyond.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`Do</name> you know the name of that high pass? ' said <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir.</p>
<p><q>'No,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.</p>
<p><q>'It is called <name type="PERSON">Ci<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name> Ungol.'</q> <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> hissed sharply and began mutte<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng to himself. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>s not that its name? ' said <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir turning to him.</p>
<p>`No! <q>' said <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>, and then he squealed, as if something had stabbed him. 'Yes, yes, we heard the name once. But what does the name matter to us? Master says he must get in. So we must try some way. There is no other way to try, no.'</q></p>
<p>'No other way? ' said <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir. `<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w do you know that? And who has explored all the confines of that dark realm? ' He looked long and thoughtfully at <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>. Presently he spoke again. `Take this creature away, <name type="GPE">Anborn</name>. Treat him gently, but watch him. And do not you, Sm�agol, try to dive into <name type="DATE">the fall</name>s. The rocks have such teeth there as would slay you before your time. Leave us now and take your fish! '</p>
<p><name type="GPE">Anborn</name> went out and <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> went c<name type="GPE">ri</name>nging before him. The curtain was drawn across the recess.</p>
<p>`<name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, I think you do very unwisely in this,<q>' said <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> do not think you should go with this creature. It is wicked.'</q></p>
<p><q>'No, not altogether wicked,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.</p>
<p><q>'Not wholly, perhaps,'</q> said <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir; <q>'but malice eats it like a canker, and the evil is growing. He will lead you to no good. If you will part with him, I will give him safe-conduct and guidance to any point on the borders of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> that he may name.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`He</name> would not take it,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. 'He would follow after me as he long has <name type="PERSON">don</name>e. And I have promised many times to take him under my protection and to go where he led. You would not ask me to break faith with him?'</q></p>
<p><q>'No,'</q> said <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir. `But my heart would. For it seems less evil to counsel another man to break troth than to do so <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>self, especially if <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> sees a f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end bound unwitting to his own harm. But no � if he will go with you, you must now endure him. But I do not think you are holden to go to <name type="PERSON">Ci<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name> Ungol, of which he has told you less than he knows. That much I perceived clearly in his mind. Do not go to <name type="PERSON">Ci<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name> Ungol!'</p>
<p>`Where then shall I go? ' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. `Back to the <name type="ORG">Black</name> <name type="FAC">Gate</name> and deliver myself <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name> the guard? What do you know against this place that makes its name so dreadful? '</p>
<p>`Nothing certain,' said <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir. 'We of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> do not ever pass east of the <name type="FAC">Road</name> in these <name type="DATE">day</name>s, and n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of us younger men has ever <name type="PERSON">don</name>e so, nor has any of us set foot upon the <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s of <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>. Of them we know only old report and the rumour of <name type="DATE">byg<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> <name type="DATE">day</name>s</name>. But there is some dark terror that dwells in the passes above Minas <name type="PERSON">Morgul</name>. If <name type="PERSON">Ci<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name> Ungol is named, old men and masters of lore will blanch and fall silent.</p>
<p>,The valley of Minas <name type="PERSON">Morgul</name> passed into evil very <name type="DATE">long ago</name>, and it was a menace and a dread while the banished Enemy dwelt yet far away, and <name type="ORG">Ithil</name>ien was still for the most part in our keeping. As you know, that city was once a strong place, proud and fair, Minas <name type="ORG">Ithil</name>, the twin sister of our own city. But it was taken by fell men whom the Enemy in his <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> strength had dominated, and who <name type="PERSON">wan</name>dered homeless and masterless after his fall. It is said that their lords were men of N�menor who had fallen into dark wickedness; to them the Enemy had given <name type="GPE">ri</name>ngs of power, and he had devoured them: living ghosts they were become, ter<name type="GPE">ri</name>ble and evil. After his going they took Minas <name type="ORG">Ithil</name> and dwelt there, and they filled it, and all the valley about, with decay: it seemed empty and was not so, for a shapeless fear lived within the ruined walls. <name type="CARDINAL">Nine</name> <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rds there were, and after the return of their Master, which they aided and prepared in <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret, they grew strong again. Then the <name type="CARDINAL">Nine</name> <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s issued forth from the gates of horror, and we could not withstand them. Do not approach their citadel. You will be espied. It is a place of sleepless malice, full of lidless eyes. Do not go that way! '</p>
<p>'But where else will you direct me? ' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. 'You cannot yourself, you say, guide me to the mountains, nor over them. But over the mountains I am bound, by solemn undertaking to the <name type="ORG">Council</name>, to find a way or pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>sh in the seeking. And if I turn back, refusing the road in its bitter end, where then shall I go among <name type="ORG">Elves</name> or <name type="ORG">Men</name>? Would you have me come to <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> with this Thing, the Thing that drove your brother mad with desire? What spell would it work in Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name>? Shall there be <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> cities of Minas <name type="PERSON">Morgul</name>, g<name type="GPE">ri</name>nning at each other across a dead land filled with rot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ness? '</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`I</name> would not have it so,' said <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir.</p>
<p>`Then what would you have me do? '</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`I</name> know not. Only I would not have you go to death or to torment. And I do not think that <name type="LOC">Mithrandir</name> would have chosen this way.'</p>
<p><q>'Yet since he is g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, I must take such paths as I can find. And there is no time for long sear<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`I</name>t is a hard doom and a hopeless errand,<q>' said <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir. 'But at the least, remember my warning: beware of this guide, Sm�agol. He has <name type="PERSON">don</name>e murder before now. I read it in him.'</q> He sighed.</p>
<p><name type="ORG">`Well</name>, so we meet and part, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> son of <name type="ORG">Drogo</name>. You have no need of soft words: I do not hope to see you again on <name type="DATE">any other <name type="DATE">day</name></name> under this <name type="ORG">Sun</name>. But you shall go now with my blessing upon you, and upon all your people. Rest a little while food is prepared for you.</p>
<p>'I would gladly learn how this creeping Sm�agol became possessed of the Thing of which we speak, and how he lost it, but I will not trouble you now. If ever beyond hope you return to the lands of the living and we retell our tales, sitting by a wall in the sun, laughing at old g<name type="GPE">ri</name>ef, you shall tell me then. Until that time, or some other time beyond the vision of the Seeing-st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s of N�menor, farewell! '</p>
<p>He rose and bowed low to <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, and drawing the curtain passed out into the cave.</p>

<p>Journey to the <name type="ORG">Cross</name>-roads</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> returned to their beds and lay there in silence resting for a little, while men bestirred themselves and the business of the <name type="DATE">day</name> began. After a while water was brought to them, and then they were led to a table where food was set for <name type="CARDINAL">three</name>. <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir broke his fast with them. He had not slept since the battle on the <name type="DATE">day</name> before, yet he did not look weary.</p>
<p>When they had finished they stood up. `<name type="DATE">May</name> no hunger trouble you on the road,<q>' said <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir. `You have little provision, but some small store of food fit for travellers I have ordered to be stowed in your packs. You will have no lack of water as you walk in <name type="ORG">Ithil</name>ien, but do not d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk of any stream that flows from Imlad <name type="PERSON">Morgul</name>, the <name type="LOC">Valley</name> of Living Death. This also I must tell you. My scouts and watchers have all returned, even some that have crept within sight of the <name type="GPE">Morannon</name>. They all find a strange thing. The land is empty. Nothing is on the road, and no sound of foot, or horn, or bowst<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng is anywhere to be heard. A waiting silence broods above <name type="WORK_OF_ART">the Nameless Land</name>. I do not know what this por<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ds. But the time draws swiftly to some great conclusion. Storm is coming. Has<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> while you may! If you are ready, let us go. The <name type="ORG">Sun</name> will soon <name type="GPE">ri</name>se above the shadow.'</q></p>
<p>The hobbits' packs were brought to them (a little heavier than they had been), and also <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> stout staves of polished wood, shod with iron, and with <name type="PERSON">carven</name> heads through which ran plaited leathern thongs.</p>
<p><q>'I have no fitting gifts to give you at our parting,'</q> said <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir; `but take these staves. They may be of service to those who walk or climb in the wild. The men of the White <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s use them; though these have been cut down to your h<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name> and newly shod. They are made of the fair tree _lebethron_, beloved of the woodw<name type="GPE">ri</name>ghts of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>, and a virtue has been set upon them of finding and returning. <name type="DATE">May</name> that virtue not wholly fail under the <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name> into which you go!'</p>
<p>The hobbits bowed low. `Most gracious host,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, 'it was said to me by <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name> <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>f<name type="ORG">elven</name> that I should find f<name type="GPE">ri</name>endship upon the way, <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret and unlooked for. Certainly I looked for no such f<name type="GPE">ri</name>endship as you have shown. To have found it turns evil to great good.'</q></p>
<p>Now they made ready to depart. <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> was brought out of some corner or hiding-hole, and he seemed better pleased with himself than he had been, though he kept close to <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and avoided the glance of <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir.</p>
<p><q>'Your guide must be blindfolded,'</q> said <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir, <q>'but you and your servant <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>wise I release from this, if you wish.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> squealed, and squirmed, and clutched at <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, when they came to bind his eyes; and <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> said: <q>'Blindfold us all <name type="CARDINAL">three</name>, and cover up my eyes <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>, and then perhaps he will see that no harm is meant.'</q> This was <name type="PERSON">don</name>e, and they were led from the cave of <name type="ORG">Hen</name>neth <name type="PERSON">Ann�n</name>. After they had passed the passages and stairs they felt the cool <name type="TIME">morning</name> air, fresh and sweet, about them. Still blind they went on for some little time, up and then gently down. At last the voice of <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir ordered them to be uncovered.</p>
<p>They stood under the boughs of the woods again. No noise of <name type="DATE">the fall</name>s could be heard, for a long southward slope lay now between them and the ravine in which the stream flowed. To the west they could see light through the trees, as if the world came there to a sudden end, at a b<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk looking out only on to sky.</p>
<p><q>'Here is the last parting of our ways,'</q> said <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir. <q>'If you take my counsel, you will not turn eastward yet. Go straight on, for thus you will have the cover of the woodland for many miles. On your west is an edge where the land falls into the great <name type="GPE">vale</name>s, sometimes suddenly and sheer, sometimes in long hillsides. Keep near to this edge and the skirts of the forest. In the beginning of your journey you may walk under <name type="DATE">day</name>light, I think. The land dreams in a false peace, and for a while all evil is withdrawn. <name type="LOC">Far</name>e you well, while you may!'</q></p>
<p>He embraced the hobbits then, after the manner of his people, stooping, and placing his hands upon their shoulders, and kissing their foreheads. <q>'Go with the good will of all good men!'</q> he said.</p>
<p>They bowed to the ground. Then he turned and without looking back he left them and went to his <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> guards that stood at a little distance away. They <name type="PERSON">mar</name>velled to see with what speed these green-clad men now moved, vanishing almost in the twinkling of an eye. The forest where <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir had stood seemed empty and drear, as if a dream had passed.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> sighed and turned back southward. As if to <name type="PERSON">mar</name>k his disregard of all such courtesy, <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> was scrabbling in the mould at the foot of a tree. `Hungry again already?<q>' thought <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <name type="ORG">`Well</name>, now for it again!'</q></p>
<p>'Have they g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> at last? ' said <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>. `<name type="ORG">Nassty</name> wicked <name type="ORG">Men</name>! Sm�agol's neck still hurts him, yes it does. Let's go! '</p>
<p>`Yes, let us go,' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. `But if you can only speak ill of those who showed you mercy, keep silent! '</p>
<p>`<name type="GPE">Nice</name> Master! ' said <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>. `Sm�agol was only joking. Always forgives, he does, yes, yes, even nice Master's little t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ckses. Oh yes, nice Master, nice Sm�agol! '</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> did not answer. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>isting their packs and taking their staves in hand, they passed on into the woods of <name type="ORG">Ithil</name>ien.</p>
<p>Twice that <name type="DATE">day</name> they rested and took a little of the food provided by <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir: d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed fruits and salted meat, enough for m<name type="DATE">any <name type="DATE">day</name></name>s; and bread enough to last while it was still fresh. <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> ate nothing.</p>
<p>The sun rose and passed overhead unseen, and began to sink, and the light through the trees to the west grew golden; and always they walked in cool green shadow, and all about them was silence. The birds seemed all to have flown away or to have fallen dumb.</p>
<p><name type="PRODUCT">Darkness</name> came early to the silent woods, and before <name type="DATE">the fall</name> of <name type="TIME">night</name> they halted, weary, for they had walked <name type="CARDINAL">seven</name> leagues or more from <name type="ORG">Hen</name>neth <name type="PERSON">Ann�n</name>. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> lay and slept away the <name type="TIME">night</name> on the deep mould beneath an ancient tree. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> beside him was more uneasy: he woke many times, but there was never a sign of <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>, who had slipped off as soon as the others had settled to rest. Whether he had slept by himself in some hole nearby, or had <name type="PERSON">wan</name>dered restlessly prowling through the <name type="TIME">night</name>, he did not say; but he returned with the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> glimmer of light, and roused his companions.</p>
<p>`Must get up, yes they must!<q>' he said. '<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ng ways to go still, south and east. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbits must make haste!'</q></p>
<p><name type="DATE">That <name type="DATE">day</name></name> passed much as the <name type="DATE">day</name> before had g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, except that the silence seemed deeper; the air grew heavy, and it began to be stifling under the trees. It felt as if thunder was brewing. <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> paused, sniffing the air, and then he would mutter to himself and urge them to greater speed.</p>
<p>As the <name type="ORDINAL">third</name> stage of their <name type="DATE">day</name>'s <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ch drew on and <name type="TIME">after<name type="TIME">noon</name></name> <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ed, the forest opened out, and the trees became larger and more scattered. Great <name type="GPE">ilex</name>es of huge girth stood dark and solemn in wide glades with here and there among them hoary ash-trees. and giant oaks just putting out their brown-green buds. About them lay long launds of green grass dappled with celandine and anem<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s, white and blue, now folded for sleep; and there were acres populous with the leaves of woodland hyacinths: already their sleek bell-stems were thrusting through the mould. No living creature, beast or bird, was to be seen, but in these open places <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> grew afraid, and they walked now with caution, flitting from <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> long shadow to another.</p>
<p>Light was fading fast when they came to the forest-end. There they sat under an old gnarled oak that sent its roots twisting like snakes down a steep crumbling bank. A deep dim valley lay before them. On its further side the woods gathered again, blue and grey under the sullen <name type="TIME">evening</name>, and <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ched on southwards. To the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght the <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> glowed, remote in the <name type="LOC">West</name>, under a fire-flecked sky. To the left lay darkness: the towe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng walls of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>; and out of that darkness the long valley came, falling steeply in an ever-widening trough towards the <name type="GPE">Anduin</name>. At its bot<name type="PERSON">tom</name> ran a hurrying stream: <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> could hear its stony voice coming up through the silence; and beside it on the hither side a road went winding down like a pale <name type="GPE">ri</name>bbon, down into chill grey mists that no gleam of sunset touched. There it seemed to <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> that he desc<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed far off, floating as it were on a shadowy sea, the high dim tops and broken pinnacles of old towers forlorn and dark.</p>
<p>He turned to <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>. <name type="PERSON">`Do</name> you know where we are? ' he said.</p>
<p><q>'Yes, Master. Dangerous places. This is the road from the <name type="FAC">Tower</name> of the <name type="PERSON">Moon</name>, Master, down to the ruined city by the shores of the <name type="LOC">River</name>. The ruined city, yes, very nasty place, full of enemies. We shouldn't have taken <name type="ORG">Men</name>'s advice. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbits have come a long way out of the path. Must go east now, away up there.'</q> He waved his skinny arm towards the darkling mountains. <name type="PERSON">`A</name>nd we can't use this road. Oh no! <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Cruel</name> peoples come this way, down from the <name type="FAC">Tower</name>.'</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> looked down on to the road. At any rate nothing was moving on it now. It appeared l<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>ly and forsaken, running down to empty ruins in the mist. But there was an evil feeling in the air, as if things might indeed be passing up and down that eyes could not see. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> shuddered as he looked again at the distant pinnacles now dwindling into <name type="TIME">night</name>, and the sound of the water seemed cold and cruel: the voice of <name type="PERSON">Morgul</name>duin, the polluted stream that flowed from the <name type="LOC">Valley</name> of the <name type="NORP">Wraiths</name>.</p>
<p>'What shall we do? ' he said. 'We have walked long and far. Shall we look for some place in the woods behind where we can lie hidden? '</p>
<p><q>'No good hiding in the dark,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>. <q>'It's in <name type="DATE">day</name> that hobbits must hide now, yes in <name type="DATE">day</name>.'</q></p>
<p>`Oh come! <q>' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. 'We must rest for a bit, even if we get up again in the middle of the <name type="TIME">night</name>. There'll still be <name type="TIME">hour</name>s of dark then time enough for you to take us a long <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ch, if you know the way.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> reluctantly agreed to this, and he turned back towards the trees, working eastward for a while along the straggling edges of the wood. He would not rest on the ground so near the evil road, and after some debate they all climbed up into the crotch of a large holm-oak, whose thick branches sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>nging together from the trunk made a good hiding-place and a fairly comfortable refuge. Night fell and it grew altogether dark under the canopy of the tree. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> drank a little water and ate some bread and d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed fruit, but <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> at once curled up and went to sleep. The hobbits did not shut their eyes.</p>
<p>It must have been <name type="TIME">a little after <name type="TIME">mid<name type="TIME">night</name></name></name> when <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> woke up: suddenly they were aware of his pale eyes unlidded gleaming at them. He lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed and snif<name type="ORG">fed</name>, which seemed, as they had noticed before, his usual method of discove<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng the time of <name type="TIME">night</name>.</p>
<p><q>'Are we rested? Have we had beautiful sleep?'</q> he said. <q>'Let's go!'</q></p>
<p><q>'We aren't, and we haven't,'</q> growled <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <q>'But we'll go if we must.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> dropped at once from the branches of the tree on to all <name type="CARDINAL">four</name>s, and the hobbits followed more slowly.</p>
<p>As soon as they were down they went on again with <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> leading, eastwards, up the dark sloping land. They could see little, for the <name type="TIME">night</name> was now so deep that they were hardly aware of the stems of trees before they stumbled against them. The ground became more broken and walking was more difficult, but <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> seemed in no way troubled. He led them through thickets and wastes of brambles; sometimes round the lip of a deep cleft or dark pit, sometimes down into black <name type="PERSON">bush</name>-shrouded hollows and out again; but if ever they went a little downward, always the further slope was longer and steeper. They were climbing steadily. At their <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> halt they looked back, and they could dimly perceive the roofs of the forest they had left behind lying like a vast dense shadow, <name type="TIME">a darker <name type="TIME">night</name></name> under the dark blank sky. There seemed to be a great blackness looming slowly out of the <name type="LOC">East</name>, eating up the faint blurred stars. Later the sinking moon escaped from the pursuing cloud, but it was <name type="GPE">ri</name>nged all about with a sickly yellow glare.</p>
<p>At last <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> turned to the hobbits. <q>'Day soon,'</q> he said. '<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbits must hurry. Not safe to stay in the open in these places. Make haste! '</p>
<p>He quickened his pace, and they followed him wea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ly. Soon they began to climb up on to a great hog-back of land. For the most part it was covered with a thick growth of gorse and <name type="PERSON">whortleberry</name>, and low tough thorns, though here and there clea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ngs opened, the scars of recent fires. The gorse-<name type="PERSON">bush</name>es became more frequent as they got nearer the top; very old and tall they were, gaunt and leggy below but thick above, and already putting out yellow flowers that glimmered in the gloom and gave a faint sweet scent. So tall were the spiny thickets that the hobbits could walk up<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght under them, passing through long dry aisles carpeted with a deep p<name type="GPE">ri</name>ckly mould.</p>
<p>On the further edge of this broad hill-back they stayed their <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ch and crawled for hiding underneath a tangled knot of thorns. Their twisted boughs, stooping to the ground, were over<name type="GPE">ri</name>dden by a clambe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng maze of old b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ars. <name type="PERSON">Deep</name> inside there was a hollow hall, raftered with dead branch and bramble, and roo<name type="ORG">fed</name> with the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> leaves and shoots of sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng. There they lay for a while, too tired yet to eat; and pee<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng out through the holes in the covert they watched for the slow growth of <name type="DATE">day</name>.</p>
<p>But no <name type="DATE">day</name> came, only a dead brown <name type="TIME">twilight</name>. In the <name type="LOC">East</name> there was a dull red glare under the lowe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng cloud: it was not the red of <name type="TIME">dawn</name>. Across the tumbled lands between, the mountains of the <name type="FAC">Ephel D�ath</name> frowned at them, black and shapeless below where <name type="TIME">night</name> lay thick and did not pass away, above with jagged tops and edges outlined hard and menacing against the fiery glow. Away to their <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght a great shoulder of the mountains stood out, dark and black amid the shadows, thrusting westward.</p>
<p>`Which way do we go from here?<q>' asked <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>s that the opening of-of the <name type="PERSON">Morgul</name> <name type="LOC">Valley</name>, away over there beyond that black mass?'</q></p>
<p>`Need we think about it yet?<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, `Surely we're not going to move any more to<name type="DATE">day</name>, if <name type="DATE">day</name> it is?'</q></p>
<p>`Perhaps not, perhaps not,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>. `But we must go soon, to the <name type="ORG">Cross</name>-roads. Yes, to the <name type="ORG">Cross</name>-roads. That's the way over there yes, Master.'</q></p>
<p>The red glare over <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> died away. The <name type="TIME">twilight</name> deepened as great vapours rose in the <name type="LOC">East</name> and crawled above them. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> took a little food and then lay down, but <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> was restless. He would not eat any of their food, but he drank a little water and then crawled about under the <name type="PERSON">bush</name>es, sniffing and mutte<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng. Then. suddenly he disappeared.</p>
<p>`Off hunting, I suppose,' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> and yawned. It was his turn to sleep <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>, and he was soon deep in a dream. He thought he was back in the <name type="FAC">Bag End</name> garden looking for something; but he had a heavy pack on his back, which made him stoop. It all seemed very weedy and rank somehow, and thorns and <name type="PERSON">bracken</name> were invading the beds down near the bot<name type="PERSON">tom</name> hedge.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`A</name> job of work for me, I can see; but I'm so tired,<q>' he kept on saying. Presently he remembered what he was looking for. `My pipe!'</q> he said, and with that he woke up.</p>
<p>`<name type="PERSON">Silly</name>!<q>' he said to himself, as he opened his eyes and wondered why he was lying down under the hedge. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>t's in your pack all the time!'</q> Then he realized, <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> that the pipe might be in his pack but he had no leaf, and next that he was <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name>s of miles from <name type="FAC">Bag End</name>. He sat up. It seemed to be almost dark. Why had his master let him sleep on out of turn, <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght on till <name type="TIME">evening</name>?</p>
<p>`<name type="GPE">Haven</name>'t you had no sleep, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>?<q>' he said. 'What's the time? Seems to be getting late!'</q></p>
<p><q>'No it isn't,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. `But the <name type="DATE">day</name> is getting darker instead of lighter: darker and darker. As far as I can tell, it isn't mid<name type="DATE">day</name> yet, and you've only slept for <name type="TIME">about <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> <name type="TIME">hour</name>s</name>.'</p>
<p><q>'I wonder what's up,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <q>'Is there a storm coming? If so it's going to be the worst there ever was. We shall wish we were down a deep hole, not just stuck under a hedge.'</q> He lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed. `What's that? Thunder, or drums, or what is it? '</p>
<p><q>'I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t know,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>t's been going on for a good while now. Sometimes the ground seems to tremble, sometimes it seems to be the heavy air throbbing in your ears.'</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> looked round. `Where's <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>? <q>' he said. 'Hasn't he come back yet?'</q></p>
<p>`No,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. `There's not been a sign or sound of him.'</q></p>
<p><name type="ORG">`Well</name>, I can't abide him,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>n fact, I've never taken anything on a journey that I'd have been less sorry to lose on the way. But it would be just like him, after coming all these miles, to go and get lost now, just when we shall need him most � that is, if he's ever going to be any use, which I doubt.'</q></p>
<p>`You forget the <name type="LOC">Marshes</name>,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> hope nothing has happened to him.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`A</name>nd I hope he's <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name> no t<name type="GPE">ri</name>cks. And anyway I hope he doesn't fall into other hands, as you might say. Because if he does, we shall soon be in for trouble.'</p>
<p>At that moment a rolling and rumbling noise was heard again, louder now and deeper. The ground seemed to quiver under their feet. <q>'I think we are in for trouble anyhow,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>'m afraid our journey is drawing to an end.'</p>
<p><q>'<name type="DATE">May</name>be,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>; `but _where there's life there's hope_, as my <name type="PERSON">Gaffer</name> used to say; _and need of vittles_, as he mostways used to add. You have a bite, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, and then a bit of sleep.'</p>
<p><name type="TIME">The <name type="TIME">after<name type="TIME">noon</name></name></name>, as <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> supposed it must be called, wore on. <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>oking out from the covert he could see only a dun, shadowless world, fading slowly into a featureless, colourless gloom. It felt stifling but not warm. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> slept unquietly, turning and tossing, and sometimes murmu<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng. Twice <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> thought he heard him speaking <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>'s name. The time seemed to drag interminably. Suddenly <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> heard a hiss behind him, and there was <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> on all <name type="CARDINAL">four</name>s, pee<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng at them with gleaming eyes.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`Wake</name> up, wake up! Wake up, <name type="GPE">sleepies</name>!<q>' he whispered. <name type="PERSON">`Wake</name> up! No time to lose. We must go, yes, we must go at once. No time to lose!'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> stared at him suspiciously: he seemed f<name type="GPE">ri</name>gh<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed or excited. <name type="ORG">`Go</name> now? What's your little game? It isn't time yet. It can't be tea-time even, leastways not in decent places where there is tea-time.'</p>
<p>`<name type="PERSON">Silly</name>! ' hissed <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>. `We're not in decent places. <name type="PERSON">Tim</name>e's running short, yes, running fast. No time to lose. We must go. Wake up. Master, wake u He clawed at <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>; and <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, startled out of sleep, sat up suddenly and seized him by the arm. <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> tore himself loose and backed away.</p>
<p><q>'They mustn't be silly,'</q> he hissed. `We must go. No time to lose!' And nothing more could they get out of him. Where he had been, and what he thought was brewing to make him in such a hurry, he would not say. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> was filled with deep suspicion, and showed it; but <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> gave no sign of what was passing in his mind. He sighed, hoisted his pack, and prepared to go out into the ever-gathe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng darkness.</p>
<p>Very stealthily <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> led them down the hillside, keeping under cover wherever it was possible, and running, almost bent to the ground, across any open space; but the light was now so dim that even a keen-eyed beast of the wild could scarcely have seen the hobbits, hooded, in their <name type="PERSON">grey cloaks</name>, nor heard them, walking as wa<name type="GPE">ri</name>ly as the little people can. Without the crack of a twig or the rustle of a leaf they passed and vanished.</p>
<p>For <name type="TIME">about <name type="TIME">an <name type="TIME">hour</name></name></name> they went on, silently, in single file, oppressed by the gloom and by the absolute stillness of the land, broken only now and again by the faint rumbling as of thunder far away or drum-beats in some hollow of the hills. Down from their hiding-place they went, and then turning south they steered as straight a course as <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> could find across a long broken slope that leaned <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name>wards the mountains. Presently, not far ahead, looming up like a black wall, they saw a belt of trees. As they drew nearer they became aware that these were of vast size, very ancient it seemed, and still towe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng high, though their tops were gaunt and broken, as if tempest and lightning-blast had swept across them, but had failed to kill them or to shake their fathomless roots.</p>
<p><q>'The <name type="ORG">Cross</name>-roads, yes,'</q> whispered <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>, the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> words that had been spoken since they left their hiding-place. <q>'We must go that way.'</q> Turning eastward now, he led them up the slope; and then suddenly there it was before them: the <name type="LOC">South</name>ward <name type="FAC">Road</name>, winding its way about the outer feet of the mountains, until presently it plunged into the great <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng of trees.</p>
<p><q>'This is the only way,'</q> whispered <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>. 'No paths beyond the road. No paths. We must go to the <name type="ORG">Cross</name>-roads. But make haste! Be silent! '</p>
<p>As furtively as scouts within the campment of their enemies, they crept down on to the road, and stole along its westward edge under the stony bank, grey as the st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s themselves, and soft-footed as hunting cats. At length they reached the trees, and found that they stood in a great roofless <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng, open in the middle to the sombre sky; and the spaces between their immense boles were like the great dark arches of some ruined hall. In the very centre <name type="CARDINAL">four</name> ways met. Behind them lay the road to the <name type="GPE">Morannon</name>; before them it ran out again upon its long journey south; to their <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght the road from old <name type="NORP">Osgiliath</name> came climbing up, and crossing, passed out eastward into darkness: the <name type="CARDINAL">four</name>th way, the road they were to take.</p>
<p>Standing there for a moment filled with dread <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> became aware that a light was shining; he saw it glowing on <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>'s face beside him. Turning towards it, he saw, beyond an arch of boughs, the road to <name type="NORP">Osgiliath</name> running almost as straight as a stretched <name type="GPE">ri</name>bbon down, down, into the <name type="LOC">West</name>. There, far away, beyond sad <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> now overwhelmed in shade, the <name type="ORG">Sun</name> was sinking, finding at last the hem of the great slow-rolling pall of cloud, and falling in an ominous fire towards the yet unsullied <name type="LOC">Sea</name>. The b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ef glow fell upon a huge sitting figure, still and solemn as the great st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> kings of <name type="PERSON">Argonath</name>. <name type="DATE">The <name type="DATE">year</name>s</name> had gnawed it, and violent hands had maimed it. Its head was g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, and in its place was set in mockery a round rough<name type="PERSON">-he</name>wn st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, rudely painted by savage hands in the likeness of a g<name type="GPE">ri</name>nning face with <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> large red eye in the midst of its forehead. Upon its knees and mighty c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>r, and all about the pedestal, were idle scrawls mixed with the foul symbols that the maggot-folk of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> used.</p>
<p>Suddenly, caught by the level beams, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> saw the old king's head: it was lying rolled away by the roadside. `<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>!<q>' he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed, startled into speech. `<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok! The king has got a crown again!'</q></p>
<p>The eyes were hollow and the <name type="PERSON">carven</name> beard was broken, but about the high stern forehead there was a coronal of silver and gold. A trailing plant with flowers like small white stars had bound itself across the brows as if in reverence for <name type="DATE">the fall</name>en king, and in the crevices of his stony <name type="PERSON">hai</name>r yellow st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>crop gleamed.</p>
<p><q>'They cannot conquer for ever!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. And then suddenly the b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ef glimpse was g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. The <name type="ORG">Sun</name> dipped and vanished, and as if at the shutte<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng of a lamp, black <name type="TIME">night</name> fell.</p>
</chapter><chapter num="8"><heading>Chapter 8</heading>
<p>The Stairs of <name type="PERSON">Ci<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name> Ungol</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> was tugging at <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s cloak and hissing with fear and impatience. `We must go,<q>' he said. `We mustn't stand here. Make haste!'</q></p>
<p>Reluctantly <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> turned his back on the <name type="LOC">West</name> and followed as his guide led him, out into the darkness of the <name type="LOC">East</name>. They left the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng of trees and crept along the road towards the mountains. This road, too, ran straight for a while, but soon it began to bend away southwards, until it came <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght under the great shoulder of rock that they had seen from the distance. <name type="ORG">Black</name> and forbidding it loomed above them, darker than the dark sky behind. Crawling under its shadow the road went on, and rounding it sprang east again and began to climb steeply.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> were plodding along with heavy hearts, no longer able to care greatly about their pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>l. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s head was bowed; his burden was dragging him down again. As soon as the great <name type="ORG">Cross</name>-roads had been passed, the w<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name> of it, almost forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> in <name type="ORG">Ithil</name>ien, had begun to grow once more. Now, feeling the way become steep before his feet, he looked wea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ly up; and then he saw it, even as <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> had said that he would: the city of the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>wraiths. He cowered against the stony bank.</p>
<p>A long-tilted valley, a deep <name type="LOC">gulf</name> of shadow, ran back far into the mountains. Upon the further side, some way within the valley's arms high on a rocky seat upon the black knees of the <name type="FAC">Ephel D�ath</name>, stood the walls and tower of Minas <name type="PERSON">Morgul</name>. All was dark about it, <name type="LOC">earth</name> and sky, but it was lit with light. Not the imp<name type="GPE">ri</name>s<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>d moonlight welling through the <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ble walls of Minas <name type="ORG">Ithil</name> <name type="DATE">long ago</name>, <name type="FAC">Tower</name> of the <name type="PERSON">Moon</name>, fair and radiant in the hollow of the hills. Paler indeed than the moon ailing in some slow eclipse was the light of it now, wave<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng and blowing like a noisome exhalation of decay, a corpse-light, a light that illuminated nothing. In the walls and tower windows showed, like countless black holes looking inward into emptiness; but the topmost course of the tower revolved slowly, <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> way and then another, a huge ghostly head lee<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng into the <name type="TIME">night</name>. For a moment the <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> companions stood there, sh<name type="GPE">ri</name>nking, sta<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng up with unwilling eyes. <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> was the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> to recover. Again he pulled at their cloaks urgently, but he spoke no word. Almost he dragged them forward. Every step was reluctant, and time seemed to slow its pace. so that between the raising of a foot and the setting of it down <name type="TIME">minutes</name> of loathing passed.</p>
<p>So they came slowly to the white b<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge. Here the road, gleaming faintly, passed over the stream in the midst of the valley, and went on, winding deviously <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name>wards the city's gate: a black mouth opening in the outer circle of the northward walls. Wide flats lay on either bank, shadowy meads filled with pale white flowers. Luminous these were too, beautiful and yet hor<name type="GPE">ri</name>ble of shape, like the demented forms in an uneasy dream; and they gave forth a faint sickening charnel-smell; an odour of rot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ness filled the air. From mead to mead the b<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge sprang. Figures stood there at its head, <name type="PERSON">carven</name> with cunning in forms human and bestial, but all corrupt and loathsome. The water flowing beneath was silent, and it steamed, but the vapour that rose from it, curling and twisting about the b<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge, was deadly cold. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> felt his senses reeling and his mind darkening. Then suddenly, as if some force were at work other than his own will, he began to hurry, totte<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng forward, his groping hands held out, his head lolling from side to side. Both <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> and <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> ran after him. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> caught his master in his arms, as he stumbled and almost fell, <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght on the threshold of the b<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge.</p>
<p>`Not that way! No, not that way! ' whispered <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>, but the breath between his teeth seemed to tear the heavy stillness like a whistle, and he cowered to the ground in terror.</p>
<p>`<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>ld up, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>! <q>' muttered <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> in <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s ear. 'Come back! Not that way. <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> says not, and for once I agree with him.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> passed his hand over his brow and wrenched his eyes away from the city on the hill. The luminous tower fascinated him, and he fought the desire that was on him to run up the gleaming road towards its gate. At last with an effort he turned back, and as he did so, he felt the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> resisting him, dragging at the c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>n about his neck; and his eyes too, as he looked away, seemed for the moment to have been blinded. The darkness before him was impenetrable.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>, crawling on the ground like a f<name type="GPE">ri</name>gh<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed animal, was already vanishing into the gloom. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, supporting and guiding his stumbling master, followed after him as quickly as he could. Not far from the near bank of the stream there was a gap in the st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>-wall beside the road. <name type="PERSON">Thr</name>ough this they passed, and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> saw that they were on a narrow path that gleamed faintly at <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>, as the main road did, until climbing above the meads of deadly flowers it faded and went dark, winding its crooked way up into the northern sides of the valley.</p>
<p>Along this path the hobbits trudged, side by side, unable to see <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> in front of them, except when he turned back to beckon them on. Then his eyes sh<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> with a green-white light, reflecting the noisome <name type="PERSON">Morgul</name>-sheen perhaps, or kindled by some answe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng mood within. Of that deadly gleam and of the dark eyeholes <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> were always conscious, ever glancing fearfully over their shoulders, and ever dragging their eyes back to find the darkening path. Slowly they laboured on. As they rose above the s<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ch and vapours of the poisonous stream their breath became easier and their heads clearer; but now their limbs were deadly tired, as if they had walked <name type="TIME">all <name type="TIME">night</name></name> under a burden, or had been swimming long against a heavy tide of water. At last they could go no further without a halt.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> stopped and sat down on a st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. They had now climbed <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name> the top of a great hump of bare rock. Ahead of them there was a bay in the valley-side, and round the head of this the path went on, no more than a wide ledge with a chasm on the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght; across the sheer southward face of the mountain it crawled upwards, until it disappeared into the blackness above.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`I</name> must rest a while, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>,<q>' whispered <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>t's heavy on me, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> lad, very heavy. I wonder how far I can carry it? Anyway I must rest before we venture on to that.'</q> He pointed to the narrow way ahead.</p>
<p>`Sssh! ssh! ' hissed <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> hurrying back to them. `Sssh! ' His fingers were on his lips and he shook his head urgently. Tugging at <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s sleeve, he pointed towards the path; but <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> would not move.</p>
<p>`Not yet,<q>' he said, 'not yet.'</q> Wea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ness and more than wea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ness oppressed him; it seemed as if a heavy spell was laid on his mind and body. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> must rest,' he muttered.</p>
<p>At this <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>'s fear and agitation became so great that he spoke again, hissing behind his hand, as if to keep the sound from unseen lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ers in the air. `Not here, no. Not rest here. Fools! <name type="PRODUCT">Eye</name>s can see us. When they come to the b<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge they will see us. Come away! Climb, climb! Come! '</p>
<p>`Come, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <name type="PERSON">`He</name>'s <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght, again. We can't stay here.'</q></p>
<p><q>'All <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> in a remote voice, as of <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> speaking <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> asleep. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> will try.' Wea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ly he got to his feet.</p>
<p>But it was too late. At that moment the rock quivered and trembled beneath them. The great rumbling noise, louder than ever before, rolled in the ground and echoed in the mountains. Then with sea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng suddenness there came a great red flash. <name type="LOC">Far</name> beyond the eastern mountains it leapt into the sky and splashed the lowe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng clouds with c<name type="GPE">ri</name>mson. In that valley of shadow and cold deathly light it seemed unbearably violent and fierce. Peaks of st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> and <name type="GPE">ri</name>dges like notched knives sprang out in sta<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng black against the uprushing flame in <name type="PERSON">Gorgoroth</name>. Then came a great crack of thunder.</p>
<p>And Minas <name type="PERSON">Morgul</name> answered. There was a flare of livid lightnings: forks of blue flame sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>nging up from the tower and from the encircling hills into the sullen clouds. The <name type="LOC">earth</name> groaned; and out of the city there came a cry. <name type="PERSON">Mingled</name> with harsh high voices as of birds of prey, and the sh<name type="GPE">ri</name>ll neighing of horses wild with rage and fear, there came a rending screech, shive<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng, <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing swiftly to a piercing pitch beyond the range of hea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng. The hobbits wheeled round towards it, and cast themselves down, holding their hands upon their ears.</p>
<p>As the ter<name type="GPE">ri</name>ble cry ended, falling back through a long sickening wail to silence, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> slowly raised his head. Across the narrow valley, now almost on a level with his eyes, the walls of the evil city stood, and its cavernous gate, shaped like an open mouth with gleaming teeth, was gaping wide. And out of the gate an army came.</p>
<p>All that host was clad in sable, dark as the <name type="TIME">night</name>. Against the <name type="PERSON">wan</name> walls and the luminous pavement of the road <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> could see them, small black figures in rank upon rank, <name type="PERSON">mar</name><name type="PERSON">chin</name>g swiftly and silently, passing outwards in an endless stream. Before them went a great cavalry of horsemen moving like ordered shadows, and at their head was <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> greater than all the rest: a <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>, all black, save that on his hooded head he had a helm like a crown that flickered with a pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>lous light. Now he was drawing near the b<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge below, and <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s sta<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng eyes followed him, unable to wink or to withdraw. Surely there was the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd of the <name type="CARDINAL">Nine</name> <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s returned to <name type="LOC">earth</name> to lead his ghastly host to battle? Here, yes here indeed was the haggard king whose cold hand had smit<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> down the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>-bearer with his deadly knife. The old wound throbbed with pain and a great c<name type="ORG">hill s</name>pread towards <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s heart.</p>
<p>Even as these thoughts pierced him with dread and held him bound as with a spell, the <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name> halted suddenly, <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght before the entrance of the b<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge, and behind him all the host stood still. There was a pause, a dead silence. <name type="DATE">May</name>be it was the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> that called to the Wraith-lord, and for a moment he was troubled, sensing some other power within his valley. This way and that turned the dark head helmed and crowned with fear, sweeping the shadows with its unseen eyes. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> waited, like a bird at the approach of a snake, unable to move. And as he waited, he felt, more urgent than ever before, the command that he should put on the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>. But great as the pressure was, he felt no inclination now to yield to it. He knew that the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> would only betray him, and that he had not, even if he put it on, the power to face the <name type="PERSON">Morgul</name>-king-not yet. There was no longer any answer to that command in his own will, dismayed by terror though it was, and he felt only the beating upon him of a great power from outside. It took his hand, and as <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> watched with his mind, not willing it but in suspense (as if he looked on some old story far away), it moved the hand inch by inch towards the c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>n upon his neck. Then his own will stirred; slowly it forced the hand back. and set it to find another thing, a thing lying hidden near his breast. Cold and hard it seemed as his g<name type="GPE">ri</name>p closed on it: the phial of <name type="PERSON">Galad<name type="GPE">ri</name>el</name>, so long treasured, and almost forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> till that <name type="TIME">hour</name>. As he touched it, for a while all thought of the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> was banished from his mind. He sighed and bent his head.</p>
<p>At that moment the Wraith-king turned and spurred his horse and rode across the b<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge, and all his dark host followed him. <name type="DATE">May</name>be the <name type="ORG">elven</name>-hoods defied his unseen eyes, and the mind of his small enemy; being strengthened, had turned aside his thought. But he was in haste. Already the <name type="TIME">hour</name> had struck, and at his great Master's bidding he must <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ch with war into the <name type="LOC">West</name>.</p>
<p>Soon he had passed, like a shadow into shadow, down the winding road, and behind him still the black ranks crossed the b<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge. So great an army had never issued from that <name type="GPE">vale</name> since the <name type="DATE">day</name>s of <name type="ORG">Isildur</name>'s might; no host so fell and strong in arms had yet assailed the <name type="ORG">ford</name>s of <name type="GPE">Anduin</name>; and yet it was but <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> and not the greatest of the hosts that <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> now sent forth.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> stirred. And suddenly his heart went out to <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir. <q>'The storm has burst at last,'</q> he thought. `This great array of spears and swords is going to <name type="NORP">Osgiliath</name>. Will <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir get across in time? He guessed it, but did he know the <name type="TIME">hour</name>? And who can now hold the <name type="ORG">ford</name>s when the <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g of the <name type="CARDINAL">Nine</name> <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s comes? And other armies will come. I am too late. All is lost. I tar<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed on the way. All is lost. Even if my errand is performed, no <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> will ever know. There will be no <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> I can tell. It will be in vain.' Overcome with weakness he wept. And still the host of <name type="PERSON">Morgul</name> crossed the b<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge.</p>
<p>Then at a great distance, as if it came out of memo<name type="GPE">ri</name>es of the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>, some sunlit <name type="TIME">early <name type="TIME">morning</name></name>, when the <name type="DATE">day</name> called and doors were opening, he heard <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>'s voice speaking. <name type="PERSON">`Wake</name> up, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>! Wake up! <q>' Had the voice added: `Your breakfast is ready,'</q> he would hardly have been surp<name type="GPE">ri</name>sed. Certainly <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> was urgent. <name type="PERSON">`Wake</name> up, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>! They're g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>,' he said.</p>
<p>There was a dull clang. The gates of Minas <name type="PERSON">Morgul</name> had closed. The last rank of spears had vanished down the road. The tower still g<name type="GPE">ri</name>nned across the valley, but the light was fading in it. The whole city was falling back into a dark brooding shade, and silence. Yet still it was filled with watchfulness.</p>
<p>'Wake up, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>! They're g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, and we'd better go too. There's something still alive in that place, something with eyes, or a seeing mind, if you take me; and the longer we stay in <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> spot, the so<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>r it will get on to us. Come on, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>! '</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> raised his head, and then stood up. Despair had not left him, but the weakness had passed. He even smiled g<name type="GPE">ri</name>mly, feeling now as clearly as a moment before he had felt the opposite, that what he had to do, he had to do, if he could, and that whether <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir or <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> or <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name> or <name type="PERSON">Galad<name type="GPE">ri</name>el</name> or <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> or any<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> else ever knew about it was beside the purpose. He took his staff in <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> hand and the phial in his other. When he saw that the clear light was already welling through his fingers, he thrust it into his bosom and held it against his heart. Then turning from the city of <name type="PERSON">Morgul</name>, now no more than a grey glimmer across a dark <name type="LOC">gulf</name>, he prepared to take the upward road.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>, it seemed, had crawled off along the ledge into the darkness beyond, when the gates of Minas <name type="PERSON">Morgul</name> opened, leaving the hobbits where they lay. He now came creeping back, his teeth chatte<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng and his fingers snapping. `<name type="NORP">Foolish</name>! <name type="PERSON">Silly</name>! ' he hissed. `Make haste! They mustn't think danger has passed. It hasn't. Make haste! '</p>
<p>They did not answer, but they followed him on to the climbing ledge. It was little to the liking of either of them, not even after facing so many other pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ls; but it did not last long. Soon the path reached a rounded angle where the mountain-side swelled out again, and there it suddenly entered a narrow opening in the rock. They had come to the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> stair that <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> had spoken of. The darkness was almost complete, and they could see nothing much beyond their hands' stretch; but <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>'s eyes sh<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> pale, <name type="QUANTITY">several feet</name> above, as he turned back towards them.</p>
<p>`Careful! ' he whispered. `Steps. <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ts of steps. Must be careful! '</p>
<p>Care was certainly needed. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> at <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> felt easier, having now a wall on either side, but the stairway was almost as steep as a ladder, and as they climbed up and up, they became more and more aware of the long black fall behind them. And the steps were narrow, spaced unevenly, and of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> treacherous: they were worn and smooth at the edges, and some were broken, and some cracked as foot was set upon them. The hobbits struggled on, until at last they were clinging with desperate fingers to the steps ahead, and forcing their a<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g knees to bend and straigh<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>; and ever as the stair cut its way deeper into the sheer mountain the rocky walls rose higher and higher above their heads.</p>
<p>At length, just as they felt that they could endure no more, they saw <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>'s eyes pee<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng down at them again. `We're up,<q>' he whispered. '<name type="ORDINAL">First</name> stair's past. Clever hobbits to climb so high, very clever hobbits. Just a few more little steps and that's all, yes.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Dizzy</name> and very tired <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, and <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> following him, crawled up the last step, and sat down rubbing their legs and knees. They were in a deep dark passage that seemed still to go up before them, though at a gentler slope and without steps. <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> did not let them rest long.</p>
<p><q>'There's another stair still,'</q> he said. `Much longer stair. Rest when we get to the top of next stair. Not yet.'</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> groaned. '<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>nger, did you say? ' he asked.</p>
<p><q>'Yes, yess, longer,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>. `But not so difficult. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbits have climbed the Straight Stair. Next comes <name type="ORG">the Winding Stair</name>.'</p>
<p>'And what after that? ' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>.</p>
<p>`We shall see,' said <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> softly. `O yes, we shall see! '</p>
<p><q>'I thought you said there was a tunnel,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>sn't there a tunnel or something to go through? '</p>
<p><q>'O yes, there's a tunnel,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>. `But hobbits can rest before they try that. If they get through that, they'll be nearly at the top. Very nearly, if they get through. O yes! '</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> shivered. The climb had made him sweat, but now he felt cold and clammy, and there was a chill draught in the dark passage, blowing down from the invisible h<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name>s above. He got up and shook himself. <name type="ORG">`Well</name>, let's go on! <q>' he said. `This is no place to sit in.'</q></p>
<p>The passage seemed to go on for miles, and always the chill air flowed over them, <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing as they went on to a bitter wind. The mountains seemed to be trying with their deadly breath to daunt them, to turn them back from the <name type="ORG">sec</name>rets of the high places, or to blow them away into the darkness behind. They only knew that they had come to the end, when suddenly they felt no wall at their <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght hand. They could see very little. Great black shapeless masses and deep grey shadows loomed above them and about them, but now and again a dull red light flickered up under the lowe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng clouds, and for a moment they were aware of tall peaks, in front and on either side, like pillars holding up a vast sagging roof. They seemed to have climbed up many <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name>s of feet, on to a wide shelf. A cliff was on their left and a chasm on their <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> led the way close under the cliff. For the present they were no longer climbing, but the ground was now more broken and dangerous in the dark, and there were blocks and lumps of fallen st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> in the way. Their going was slow and cautious. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w many <name type="TIME">hour</name>s had passed since they had entered the <name type="PERSON">Morgul</name> Vale neither <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> nor <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> could any longer guess. <name type="TIME">The <name type="TIME">night</name></name> seemed endless.</p>
<p>At length they were once more aware of a wall looming up, and once more a stairway opened before them. Again they halted, and again they began to climb. It was a long and weary ascent; but this stairway did not delve into the mountain-side. Here the huge cliff face sloped backwards, and the path like a snake wound to and fro across it. At <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> point it crawled sideways <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght to the edge of the dark chasm, and <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> glancing down saw below him as a vast deep pit the great ravine at the head of the <name type="PERSON">Morgul</name> <name type="LOC">Valley</name>. Down in its depths glimmered like a glow-worm thread the wraith-road from the dead city to <name type="FAC">the Nameless Pass</name>. He turned hastily away.</p>
<p>Still on and up the stairway bent and crawled, until at last with a final flight, short and straight, it climbed out again on to another level. The path had veered away from the main pass in the great ravine, and it now followed its own pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>lous course at the bot<name type="PERSON">tom</name> of a lesser cleft among the higher regions of the <name type="FAC">Ephel D�ath</name>. <name type="PERSON">Dimly</name> the hobbits could discern tall piers and jagged pinnacles of st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> on either side, between which were great crevices and fissures blacker than the <name type="TIME">night</name>, where forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> <name type="DATE">winter</name>s had gnawed and carved the sunless st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. And now the red light in the sky seemed stronger; though they could not tell whether a dreadful <name type="TIME">morning</name> were indeed coming to this place of shadow, or whether they saw only the flame of some great violence of <name type="ORG">Sauron</name> in the torment of <name type="PERSON">Gorgoroth</name> beyond. Still far ahead, and still high above, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, looking up, saw, as he guessed, the very crown of this bitter road. Against the sullen redness of the eastern sky a cleft was outlined in the topmost <name type="GPE">ri</name>dge, narrow, deep-cloven <name type="CARDINAL">between <name type="CARDINAL">two</name></name> black shoulders; and on either shoulder was a horn of st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>.</p>
<p>He paused and looked more at<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>tively. The horn upon the left was tall and slender; and in it burned a red light, or else the red light in the land beyond was shining through a hole. He saw now: it was a black tower poised above the outer pass. He touched <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>'s arm and pointed.</p>
<p><q>'I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t like the look of that! ' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. `So this <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret way of yours is guarded after all,'</q> he growled, turning to <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>. 'As you knew all along, I suppose? '</p>
<p><q>'All ways are watched, yes,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>. `Of course they are. But hobbits must try some way. This may be least watched. Perhaps they've all g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> away to big battle, perhaps! '</p>
<p><q>'Perhaps,'</q> grunted <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <q>'Well, it still seems a long way off, and a long way up before we get there. And there's still the tunnel. I think you ought to rest now, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t know what time of <name type="DATE">day</name> or <name type="TIME">night</name> it is, but we've kept going for <name type="TIME">hour</name>s and <name type="TIME">hour</name>s.'</q></p>
<p>`Yes, we must rest,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. 'Let us find some corner out of the wind, and gather our strength-for the last lap.'</q> For so he felt it to be. The terrors of the land beyond, and the deed to be <name type="PERSON">don</name>e there, seemed remote, too far off yet to trouble him. All his mind was bent on getting through or over this impenetrable wall and guard. If once he could do that impossible thing, then somehow the errand would be accomplished, or so it seemed to him in that dark <name type="TIME">hour</name> of wea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ness, still labou<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng in the stony shadows under <name type="PERSON">Ci<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name> Ungol.</p>
<p>In a dark crevice <name type="CARDINAL">between <name type="CARDINAL">two</name></name> great piers of rock they sat down: <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> a little way within. and <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> crouched upon the ground near the opening. There the hobbits took what they expected would be their last meal before they went down into <name type="WORK_OF_ART">the Nameless Land</name>, maybe the last meal they would ever eat together. Some of the food of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> they ate, and wafers of the <name type="PERSON">waybread</name> of the <name type="ORG">Elves</name>. and they drank a little. But of their water they were spa<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng and took only enough to mois<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> their dry mouths.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`I</name> wonder when we'll find water again? ' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. 'But I suppose even over there they d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk? <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk, <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t they? '</p>
<p><q>'Yes, they d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'But do not let us speak of that. Such d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk is not for us.'</q></p>
<p>`Then all the more need to fill our bottles,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. `But there isn't any water up here: not a sound or a t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ckle have I heard. And anyway <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir said we were not to d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk any water in <name type="PERSON">Morgul</name>.'</q></p>
<p><q>'No water flowing out of Imlad <name type="PERSON">Morgul</name>, were his words,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. `We are not in that valley now, and if we came on a sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng it would be flowing into it and not out of it.'</p>
<p><q>'I wouldn't trust it,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, <q>'not till I was dying of thirst. There's a wicked feeling about this place.'</q> He snif<name type="ORG">fed</name>. <q>'And a smell, I fancy. Do you notice it? A queer kind of a smell, stuffy. I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t like it.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t like anything here at all.'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, `step or st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, breath or b<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. <name type="LOC">Earth</name>, air and water all seem accursed. But so our path is laid.'</p>
<p><q>'Yes, that's so,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <name type="PERSON">`A</name>nd we shouldn't be here at all, if we'd known more about it before we started. But I suppose it's of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> that way. The brave things in the old tales and songs, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>: adventures, as I used to call them. I used to think that they were things the wonderful folk of the sto<name type="GPE">ri</name>es went out and looked for, because they <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ted them, because they were exciting and life was a bit dull, a kind of a sport, as you might say. But that's not the way of it with the tales that really mattered, or the <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s that stay in the mind. Folk seem to have been just landed in them, usually � their paths were laid that way, as you put it. But I expect they had lots of chances, like us, of turning back, only they didn't. And if they had, we shouldn't know, because they'd have been forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>. We hear about those as just went on � and not all to a good end, mind you; at least not to what folk inside a story and not outside it call a good end. You know, coming home, and finding things all <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght, though not quite the same � like old Mr <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>. But those aren't always the best tales to hear, though they may be the best tales to get landed in! I wonder what sort of a tale we've fallen into? '</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`I</name> wonder,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. 'But I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t know. And that's the way of a real tale. Take any <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> that you're fond of. You may know, or guess, what kind of a tale it is, happy-ending or sad-ending, but the people in it <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t know. And you <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t them to.'</q></p>
<p>'No, sir, of course not. <name type="PERSON">Beren</name> now, he never thought he was going to get that <name type="PERSON">Sil<name type="PERSON">mar</name>il</name> from the Iron <name type="PRODUCT">Crown</name> in <name type="PERSON">Thangorod<name type="GPE">ri</name>m</name>, and yet he did, and that was a worse place and a blacker danger than ours. But that's a long tale, of course, and goes on past the happiness and into g<name type="GPE">ri</name>ef and beyond it � and the <name type="PERSON">Sil<name type="PERSON">mar</name>il</name> went on and came to E�rendil. And why, sir, I never thought of that before! We've got � you've got some of the light of it in that star-glass that the <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> gave you! Why, to think of it, we're in the same tale still! It's going on. <name type="PERSON">Don</name>'t the great tales never end? '</p>
<p><q>'No, they never end as tales,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. `But the people in them come, and go when their part's ended. Our part will end later � or so<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>r.'</p>
<p><q>'And then we can have some rest and some sleep,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. He laughed g<name type="GPE">ri</name>mly. <q>'And I mean just that, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. I mean plain ordinary rest, and sleep, and waking <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name> <name type="TIME">a <name type="TIME">morning</name></name>'s work in the garden. I'm afraid that's all I'm hoping for all the time. All the big imp<name type="GPE">ortan</name>t plans are not for my sort. Still, I wonder if we shall ever be put into songs or tales. We're in <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, or course; but I mean: put into words, you know, told by the fireside, or read out of a great big book with red and black letters, <name type="DATE">year</name>s and <name type="DATE">year</name>s afterwards. And people will say: "Let's hear about <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>! " And they'll say: "Yes, that's <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of my favou<name type="GPE">ri</name>te sto<name type="GPE">ri</name>es. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> was very brave. wasn't he, dad?" "Yes, my boy, the famousest of the hobbits, and that's saying a lot."'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`I</name>t's saying a lot too much,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, and he laughed, a long clear laugh from his heart. Such a sound had not been heard in those places since <name type="ORG">Sauron</name> came to <name type="LOC">Middle-<name type="LOC">earth</name></name>. To <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> suddenly it seemed as if all the st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s were lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing and the tall rocks leaning over them. But <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> did not heed them; he laughed again. 'Why, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>,'</q> he said, 'to hear you somehow makes me as merry as if the story was already w<name type="GPE">ri</name>t<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>. But you've left out <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the chief characters: <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>wise the stouthearted. "I <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t to hear more about <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, dad. Why didn't they put in more of his talk, dad? That's what I like, it makes me laugh. And <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> wouldn't have got far without <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, would he, dad? " '</p>
<p>`Now, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>,' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, 'you shouldn't make fun. I was se<name type="GPE">ri</name>ous. '</p>
<p>`So was I,' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, 'and so I am. We're going on a bit too fast. You and I, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, are still stuck in the worst places of the story, and it is all too likely that some will say at this point: "Shut the book now, dad; we <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t to read any more." '</p>
<p>`<name type="DATE">May</name>be,' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, 'but I wouldn't be <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> to say that. Things <name type="PERSON">don</name>e and over and made into part of the great tales are different. Why, even <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> might be good in a tale, better than he is to have by you, anyway. And he used to like tales himself once, by his own account. I wonder if he thinks he's the hero or the villain?</p>
<p>`<name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>!<q>' he called. `Would you like to be the hero � now where's he got to again?'</q></p>
<p>There was no sign of him at the mouth of their shelter nor in the shadows near. He had refused their food, though he had, as usual, accepted a mouthful of water; and then he had seemed to curl up for a sleep: They had supposed that <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> at any rate of his objects in his long absence the <name type="DATE">day</name> before had been to hunt for food to his own liking; and now he had evidently slipped off again while they talked. But what for this time?</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`I</name> <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t like his sneaking off without saying,' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. 'And least of all now. He can't be looking for food up here, not unless there's some kind of rock he fancies. Why, there isn't even a bit of moss! '</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`I</name>t's no good worrying about him now,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. `We couldn't have got so far, not even within sight of the pass, without him, and so we'll have to put up with his ways. If he's false, he's false.'</q></p>
<p><q>'All the same, I'd rather have him under my eye,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <q>'All the more so, if he's false. Do you remember he never would say if this pass was guarded or no? And now we see a tower there � and it may be deserted, and it may not. Do you think he's g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> to fetch them, <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s or whatever they are?'</q></p>
<p>`No, I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t think so,<q>' answered <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. 'Even if he's <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name> some wickedness, and I suppose that's not unlikely, I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t think it's that: not to fetch <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s, or any servants of the Enemy. Why wait till now, and go through all the labour of the climb, and come so near the land he fears? He could probably have betrayed us to <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s many times since we met him. No, if it's anything, it will be some little p<name type="GPE">ri</name>vate t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ck of his own-that he thinks is quite <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret.'</q></p>
<p><name type="ORG">`Well</name>, I suppose you're <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. 'Not that it comforts me mightily. I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t make no mistake: I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t doubt he'd hand _me_ over to <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s as gladly as kiss his hand. But I was forgetting � his Precious. No, I suppose the whole time it's been _The Precious for poor Sm�agol_. That's the <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> idea in all his little schemes, if he has any. But how b<name type="GPE">ri</name>nging us up here will help him in that is more than I can guess.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Very likely he can't guess himself,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <name type="PERSON">`A</name>nd I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t think he's got just <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> plain scheme in his muddled head. I think he really is in part trying to save the Precious from the Enemy. as long as he can. For that would be the last disaster for himself too. if the Enemy got it. And in the other part, perhaps, he's just biding his time and waiting on chance.'</p>
<p><q>'Yes, <name type="ORG">Slinker</name> and <name type="PRODUCT">Stinker</name>, as I've said before,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <q>'But the nearer they get to the Enemy's land the more like <name type="PRODUCT">Stinker</name> <name type="ORG">Slinker</name> will get. <name type="PERSON">Mark</name> my words: if ever we get to the pass, he won't let us really take the precious thing over the border without making some kind of trouble.'</q></p>
<p>`We haven't got there yet,' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.</p>
<p><q>'No, but we'd better keep our eyes skinned till we do. If we're caught napping, <name type="PRODUCT">Stinker</name> will come out on top pretty quick. Not but what it would be safe for you to have a wink now, master. Safe, if you lay close to me. I'd be dearly glad to see you have a sleep. I'd keep watch over you; and anyway, if you lay near, with my arm round you, no <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> could come pawing you without your <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> knowing it.'</q></p>
<p>`Sleep!<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and sighed, as if out of a desert he had seen a mirage of cool green. 'Yes, even here I could sleep.'</q></p>
<p>`Sleep then, master! Lay your head in my lap.'</p>
<p>And so <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> found them <name type="TIME">hour</name>s later, when he returned, crawling and creeping down the path out of the gloom ahead. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> sat propped against the st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, his head dropping sideways and his breathing heavy. In his lap lay <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s head, drowned deep in sleep; upon his white forehead lay <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>'s brown hands, and the other lay softly upon his master's breast. Peace was in both their faces.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> looked at them. A strange expression passed over his lean hungry face. The gleam faded from his eyes, and they went dim and grey, old and tired. A spasm of pain seemed to twist him, and he turned away, pee<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng back <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name>wards the pass, shaking his head, as if engaged in some inte<name type="GPE">ri</name>or debate. Then he came back, and slowly putting out a trembling hand, very cautiously he touched <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s knee � but almost the touch was a caress. For a fleeting moment, could <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the sleepers have seen him, they would have thought that they beheld an old weary hobbit, shrunken by <name type="DATE">the <name type="DATE">year</name></name>s that had car<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed him far beyond his time, beyond f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends and kin, and the fields and streams of youth, an old starved pitiable thing.</p>
<p>But at that touch <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> stirred and c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed out softly in his sleep, and immediately <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> was wide awake. The <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> thing he saw was <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> � `pawing at master,' as he thought.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`He</name>y you!<q>' he said roughly. `What are you <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name>?'</q></p>
<p><q>'Nothing, nothing,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> softly. `<name type="GPE">Nice</name> Master!'</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`I</name> daresay,' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. 'But where have you been to � sneaking off and sneaking back, you old villain? '</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> withdrew himself, and a green glint flickered under his heavy lids. Almost spider-like he looked now, crouched back on his bent limbs, with his protruding eyes. The fleeting moment had passed, beyond recall. `Sneaking, sneaking!<q>' he hissed. '<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbits always so polite, yes. O nice hobbits! Sm�agol b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ngs them up <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret ways that nobody else could find. Tired he is, thirsty he is, yes thirsty; and he guides them and he searches for paths, and they say _sneak, sneak_. Very nice f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends, O yes my precious, very nice.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> felt a bit remorseful, though not more trustful. <q>'Sorry.'</q> he said. 'I'm sorry, but you startled me out of my sleep. And I shouldn't have been sleeping, and that made me a bit sharp. But Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. he's that tired, I asked him to have a wink; and well, that's how it is. Sorry. But where _have_ you been to? '</p>
<p>`Sneaking,' said <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>, and the green glint did not leave his eyes.</p>
<p><q>'O very well,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, `have it your own way! I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t suppose it's so far from the truth. And now we'd better all be sneaking along together. What's the time? Is it to<name type="DATE">day</name> or to<name type="DATE">morrow</name>? '</p>
<p><q>'It's to<name type="DATE">morrow</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>, <q>'or this was to<name type="DATE">morrow</name> when hobbits went to sleep. Very foolish, very dangerous-if poor Sm�agol wasn't sneaking about to watch.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`I</name> think we shall get tired of that word soon,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. 'But never mind. I'll wake master up.'</q> Gently he smoothed the <name type="PERSON">hai</name>r back from <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s brow, and bending down spoke softly to him.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`Wake</name> up, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>! Wake up! '</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> stirred and opened his eyes, and smiled, seeing <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>'s face bending over him. `Calling me early aren't you, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>?' he said. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>t's dark still! '</p>
<p><q>'Yes it's always dark here,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. `But <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>'s come back Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, and he says it's to<name type="DATE">morrow</name>. So we must be walking on. The last lap.'</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> drew a deep breath and sat up. `The last lap! ' he said. '<name type="ORG">Hullo</name>, Sm�agol! Found any food? Have you had any rest? '</p>
<p>`No food, no rest, nothing for Sm�agol,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>. <name type="PERSON">`He</name>'s a sneak.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> clicked his tongue, but restrained himself.</p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Don</name>'t take names to yourself, Sm�agol,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'It's unwise whether they are true or false.'</q></p>
<p>`Sm�agol has to take what's given him,<q>' answered <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>. 'He was given that name by kind <name type="PERSON">Master <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>wise</name>, the hobbit that knows so much.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> looked at <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <q>'Yes sir,'</q> he said. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> did use the word, waking up out of my sleep sudden and all and finding him at hand. I said I was sorry, but I soon shan't be.'</p>
<p><q>'Come, let it pass then,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'But now we seem to have come to the point, you and I, Sm�agol. Tell me. Can we find the rest of the way by ourselves? We're in sight of the pass, of a way in, and if we can find it now, then I suppose our agreement can be said to be over. You have <name type="PERSON">don</name>e what you promised, and you're free: free to go back to food and rest, wherever you wish to go, except to servants of the Enemy. And <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> <name type="DATE">day</name> I may reward you, I or those that remember me.'</q></p>
<p>`No, no, not yet,<q>' <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> whined. `O no! They can't find the way themselves, can they? O no indeed. There's the tunnel coming. Sm�agol must go on. No rest. No food. Not yet.'</q></p>

<p><name type="FAC">Shelob</name>'s Lair</p>
<p>It may indeed have been <name type="DATE">day</name>time now, as <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> said, but the hobbits could see little difference, unless, perhaps, the heavy sky above was less utterly black, more like a great roof of smoke; while instead of the darkness of <name type="TIME">deep <name type="TIME">night</name></name>, which lingered still in cracks and holes, a grey blur<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng shadow shrouded the stony world about them. They passed on, <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> in front and the hobbits now side by side, up the long ravine between the piers and columns of torn and weathered rock, standing like huge unshapen statues on either hand. There was no sound. Some way ahead, <name type="QUANTITY">a mile</name> or so, perhaps, was a great grey wall, a last huge upthrusting mass of mountain-st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. Darker it loomed, and steadily it rose as they approached, until it towered up high above them, shutting out the view of all that lay beyond. <name type="PERSON">Deep</name> shadow lay before its feet. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> snif<name type="ORG">fed</name> the air.</p>
<p>`Ugh! That smell!<q>' he said. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>t's getting stronger and stronger.'</q></p>
<p>Presently they were under the shadow, and there in the midst of it they saw the opening of a cave. `This is the way in,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> softly. `This is the entrance to the tunnel.'</q> He did not speak its name: <name type="PERSON">Torech Ungol</name>, <name type="FAC">Shelob</name>'s Lair. Out of it came a s<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ch, not the sickly odour of decay in the meads of <name type="PERSON">Morgul</name>, but a foul <name type="GPE">reek</name>, as if filth unnameable were piled and hoarded in the dark within.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`I</name>s this the only way, Sm�agol? ' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.</p>
<p><q>'Yes, yes,'</q> he answered. <q>'Yes, we must go this way now.'</q></p>
<p><q>'D'you mean to say you've been through this hole?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. `Phew! But perhaps you <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t mind bad smells.'</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>'s eyes glinted. <name type="PERSON">`He</name> doesn't know what we minds, does he precious? No, he doesn't. But Sm�agol can bear things. Yes. He's been through. O yes, <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght through. It's the only way.'</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`A</name>nd what makes the smell, I wonder,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>t's like � well, I wouldn't like to say. Some beastly hole of the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s, I'll warrant, with <name type="CARDINAL">a <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name></name> <name type="DATE">year</name>s of their filth in it.'</q></p>
<p><q>'Well,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, <q>'<name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s or no, if it's the only way, we must take it.'</q></p>
<p>Drawing a deep breath they passed inside. In a few steps they were in utter and impenetrable dark. Not since the lightless passages of <name type="GPE">Mo<name type="GPE">ri</name>a</name> had <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> or <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> known such darkness, and if possible here it was deeper and denser. There, there were airs moving, and echoes, and a sense of space. Here the air was still, stagnant, heavy, and sound fell dead. They walked as it were in a black vapour wrought of ve<name type="GPE">ri</name>table darkness itself that, as it was breathed, brought blindness not only to the eyes but to the mind, so that even the memory of colours and of forms and of any light faded out of thought. Night always had been, and always would be, and <name type="TIME">night</name> was all.</p>
<p>But for a while they could still feel, and indeed the senses of their feet and fingers at <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> seemed sharpened almost painfully. The walls felt, to their surp<name type="GPE">ri</name>se, smooth, and the floor, save for a step now and again, was straight and even, going ever up at the same stiff slope. The tunnel was high and wide, so wide that, though the hobbits walked abreast, only tou<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g the side-walls with their outstretched hands, they were separated, cut off al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> in the darkness.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> had g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> in <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> and seemed to be only a few steps ahead. While they were still able to give heed to such things, they could hear his breath hissing and gasping just in front of them. But after a time their senses became duller, both touch and hea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng seemed to grow numb, and they kept on, groping, walking, on and on, mainly by the force of the will with which they had entered, will to go through and desire to come at last to the high gate beyond.</p>
<p>Before they had g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> very far, perhaps, but time and distance soon passed out of his reckoning, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> on the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght, feeling the wall, was aware that there was an opening at the side: for a moment he caught a faint breath of some air less heavy, and then they passed it by.</p>
<p><q>'There's <name type="CARDINAL">more than <name type="CARDINAL">one</name></name> passage here,'</q> he whispered with an effort: it seemed hard to make his breath give any sound. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>t's as orc-like a place as ever there could be! '</p>
<p>After that, <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> he on the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght, and then <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> on the left, passed <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> or <name type="CARDINAL">four</name> such openings, some wider, some smaller; but there was as yet no doubt of the main way, for it was straight, and did not turn, and still went steadily up. But how long was it, how much more of this would they have to endure, or could they endure? The breathlessness of the air was growing as they climbed; and now they seemed of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> in the blind dark to sense some resistance thicker than the foul air. As they thrust forward they felt things brush against their heads, or against their hands, long <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>tacles, or hanging growths perhaps: they could not tell what they were. And still the s<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ch grew. It grew, until almost it seemed to them that smell was the only clear sense left to them. and that was for their torment. <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> <name type="TIME">hour</name>, <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> <name type="TIME">hour</name>s, <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> <name type="TIME">hour</name>s: how many had they passed in this lightless hole? <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>urs-<name type="DATE">day</name>s, <name type="DATE">week</name>s rather. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> left the tunnel-side and shrank towards <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, and their hands met and clasped. and so together they still went on.</p>
<p>At length <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, groping along the left-hand wall, came suddenly to a void. Almost he fell sideways into the emptiness. Here was some opening in the rock far wider than any they had yet passed; and out of it came a <name type="GPE">reek</name> so foul, and a sense of lurking malice so in<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>se, that <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> reeled. And at that moment <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> too lurched and fell forwards.</p>
<p>Fighting off both the sickness and the fear, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> g<name type="GPE">ri</name>pped <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>'s hand. `Up! ' he said in a hoarse breath without voice. 'It all comes from here, the s<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ch and the pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>l. Now for it! Quick! '</p>
<p>Calling up his remaining strength and resolution, he dragged <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> to his feet, and forced his own limbs to move. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> stumbled beside him. <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> step, <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> steps, <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> steps-at last <name type="CARDINAL">six</name> steps. <name type="DATE">May</name>be they had passed the dreadful unseen opening, but whether that was so or not, suddenly it was easier to move, as if some hostile will for the moment had released them. They struggled on, still hand in hand.</p>
<p>But almost at once they came to a new difficulty. The tunnel forked, or so it seemed, and in the dark they could not tell which was the wider way, or which kept nearer to the straight. Which should they take, the left, or the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght? They knew of nothing to guide them, yet a false choice would almost certainly be fatal.</p>
<p>`Which way has <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>? ' panted <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. 'And why didn't he wait? '</p>
<p>`Sm�agol! ' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, trying to call. 'Sm�agol! ' But his voice croaked, and the name fell dead almost as it left his lips. There was no answer, not an echo, not even a tremor of the air.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`He</name>'s really g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> this time, I fancy,<q>' muttered <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> guess this is just exactly where he meant to b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng us. <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>! If ever I lay hands on you again, you'll be sorry for it.'</q></p>
<p>Presently, groping and fumbling in the dark, they found that the opening on the left was blocked: either it was a blind, or else some great st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> had fallen in the passage. <q>'This can't be the way,'</q> <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> whispered. <q>'Right or wrong, we must take the other.'</q></p>
<p><q>'And quick! ' <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> panted. 'There's something worse than <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> about. I can feel something looking at us.'</q></p>
<p>They had not g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> more than <name type="QUANTITY">a few yards</name> when from behind them came a sound, startling and hor<name type="GPE">ri</name>ble in the heavy padded silence: a gurgling, bubbling noise, and a long venomous hiss. They wheeled round, but nothing could be seen. Still as st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s they stood, sta<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng, waiting for they did not know what.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`I</name>t's a trap!<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, and he laid his hand upon the hilt of his sword; and as he did so, he thought of the darkness of the barrow whence it came. 'I wish old <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> was near us now!'</q> he thought. Then as he stood, darkness about him and a blackness of despair and anger in his heart. it seemed to him that he saw a light: a light in his mind, almost unbearably b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght at <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>, as a sun-ray to the eyes of <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> long hidden in a windowless pit. Then the light became colour: green, gold, silver, white. <name type="LOC">Far</name> off, as in a little picture drawn by <name type="ORG">elven</name>-fingers he saw the <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> <name type="PERSON">Galad<name type="GPE">ri</name>el</name> standing on the grass in L�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en, and gifts were in her hands. _And you, <name type="ORG">Ring</name>-bearer_, he heard her say, remote but clear_, for you I have prepared this_.</p>
<p>The bubbling hiss drew nearer, and there was a creaking as of some great jointed thing that moved with slow purpose in the dark. A <name type="GPE">reek</name> came on before it. <q>'Master, master!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, and the life and urgency came back into his voice. <q>'The <name type="PERSON">Lady</name>'s gift! The star-glass! A light to you in dark places, she said it was to be. The star-glass!'</q></p>
<p>`The star-glass?<q>' muttered <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, as <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> answe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng out of sleep, hardly comprehending. `Why yes! Why had I forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> it? _A light when all other lights go out!_ And now indeed light al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> can help us.'</q></p>
<p>Slowly his hand went to his bosom, and slowly he held aloft the <name type="ORG">Phial</name> of <name type="PERSON">Galad<name type="GPE">ri</name>el</name>. For a moment it glimmered, faint as a <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing star struggling in heavy <name type="LOC">earth</name>ward mists, and then as its power waxed, and hope grew in <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s mind, it began to burn, and kindled to a silver flame, <name type="TIME">a minute</name> heart of dazzling light, as though E�rendil had himself come down from the high sunset paths with the last <name type="PERSON">Sil<name type="PERSON">mar</name>il</name> upon his brow. The darkness receded from it until it seemed to shine in the centre of a globe of airy crystal, and the hand that held it sparkled with white fire.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> gazed in wonder at this <name type="PERSON">mar</name>vellous gift that he had so long car<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed, not guessing its full worth and po<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>cy. Seldom had he remembered it on the road, until they came to <name type="PERSON">Morgul</name> Vale, and never had he used it for fear of its revealing light. _<name type="GPE">Aiya</name> E�rendil <name type="PERSON">Elen</name>ion Ancalima!_ he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed, and knew not what he had spoken; for it seemed that another voice spoke through his, clear, untroubled by the foul air of the pit.</p>
<p>But other po<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>cies there are in <name type="LOC">Middle-<name type="LOC">earth</name></name>, powers of <name type="TIME">night</name>, and they are old and strong. And She that walked in the darkness had heard the <name type="ORG">Elves</name> cry that cry far back in the deeps of time, and she had not heeded it, and it did not daunt her now. Even as <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> spoke he felt a great malice bent upon him, and a deadly regard conside<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng him. Not far down the tunnel, between them and the opening where they had reeled and stumbled, he was aware of eyes growing visible, <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> great clusters of many-windowed eyes � the coming menace was unmasked at last. The radiance of the star-glass was broken and thrown back from their thousand facets, but behind the glitter a pale deadly fire began steadily to glow within, a flame kindled in some deep pit of evil thought. Monstrous and abominable eyes they were, bestial and yet filled with purpose and with hideous delight, gloating over their prey trapped beyond all hope of escape.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, horror-st<name type="GPE">ri</name>cken, began slowly to back away, their own gaze held by the dreadful stare of those baleful eyes; but as they backed so the eyes advanced. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s hand wavered, and slowly the <name type="ORG">Phial</name> drooped. Then suddenly, released from the holding spell to run a little while in vain panic for the amusement of the eyes, they both turned and fled together; but even as they ran <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> looked back and saw with terror that at once the eyes came leaping up behind. The s<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ch of death was like a cloud about him.</p>
<p><q>'Stand! stand! ' he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed desperately. `Running is no use.'</q></p>
<p>Slowly the eyes crept nearer.</p>
<p>`<name type="PERSON">Galad<name type="GPE">ri</name>el</name>! ' he called, and gathe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng his courage he lifted up the <name type="ORG">Phial</name> once more. The eyes halted. For a moment their regard relaxed, as if some hint of doubt troubled them. Then <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s heart flamed within him, and without thinking what he did, whether it was folly or despair or courage, he took the <name type="ORG">Phial</name> in his left hand, and with his <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght hand drew his sword. <name type="PERSON">Sting</name> flashed out, and the sharp <name type="ORG">elven</name>-blade sparkled in the silver light, but at its edges a blue fire flicked. Then holding the star aloft and the b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght sword advanced, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, hobbit of the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>, walked steadily down to meet the eyes.</p>
<p>They wavered. Doubt came into them as the light approached. <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> by <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> they dimmed, and slowly they drew back. No b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ghtness so deadly had ever afflicted them before. From sun and moon and star they had been safe underground, but now a star had descended into the very <name type="LOC">earth</name>. Still it approached, and the eyes began to quail. <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> by <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> they all went dark; they turned away, and a great bulk, beyond the light's reach, heaved its huge shadow in between. They were g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>.</p>
<p><q>'Master, master!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. He was close behind, his own sword drawn and ready. <q>'<name type="WORK_OF_ART">Stars</name> and glory! But the <name type="ORG">Elves</name> would make a song of that, if ever they heard of it! And may I live to tell them and hear them sing. But <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t go on, master. <name type="PERSON">Don</name>'t go down to that den! Now's our only chance. Now let's get out of this foul hole!'</q></p>
<p>And so back they turned once more, <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> walking and then running; for as they went the floor of the tunnel rose steeply, and with every st<name type="GPE">ri</name>de they climbed higher above the s<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ches of the unseen lair, and strength returned to limb and heart. But still the hatred of the <name type="PERSON">Watcher</name> lurked behind them, blind for a while, perhaps, but undefeated, still bent on death. And now there came a flow of air to meet them, cold and thin. The opening, the tunnel's end, at last it was before them. Panting, <name type="DATE">year</name>ning for a roofless place, they flung themselves forward, and then in amazement they staggered, tumbling back. The outlet was blocked with some bar<name type="GPE">ri</name>er, but not of st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>: soft and a little yielding it seemed, and yet strong and impervious; air filtered through, hut not a glimmer of any light. Once more they charged and were hurled back.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Ho</name>lding aloft the <name type="ORG">Phial</name> <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> looked and before him he saw a greyness which the radiance of the star-glass did not pierce and did not illuminate, as if it were a shadow that being cast by no light, no light could dissipate. Across the width and h<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name> of the tunnel a vast web was spun, orderly as the web of some huge spider, but denser-woven and far greater, and each thread was as thick as rope.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> laughed g<name type="GPE">ri</name>mly. `Cobwebs! ' he said. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>s that all? Cobwebs! But what a spider! Have at 'em, down with 'em! '</p>
<p>In a fury he hewed at them with his sword, but the thread that he struck did not break. It gave a little and then sprang back like a plucked bowst<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng, turning the blade and tossing up both sword and arm. <name type="PERSON">Thr</name>ee times <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> struck with all his force, and at last <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> single cord of all the countless cords snapped and twisted, curling and whipping through the air. <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> end of it lashed <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>'s hand, and he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed out in pain, starting back and drawing his hand across his mouth.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`I</name>t will take <name type="DATE">day</name>s to clear the road like this,' he said. `What's to be <name type="PERSON">don</name>e? Have those eyes come back? '</p>
<p>`No, not to be seen,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. `But I still feel that they are looking at me, or thinking about me: making some other plan, perhaps. If this light were lowered, or if it failed, they would quickly come again.'</q></p>
<p>`Trapped in the end! ' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> bitterly, his anger <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing again above wea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ness and despair. `<name type="PERSON">Gnats</name> in a net. <name type="DATE">May</name> the curse of <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir bite that <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> and bite him quick! '</p>
<p><q>'That would not help us now,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. `Come! Let us see what <name type="PERSON">Sting</name> can do. It is an <name type="ORG">elven</name>-blade. There were webs of horror in the dark ravines of Bele<name type="GPE">ri</name>and where it was forged. But you must be the guard and hold back the eyes. Here, take the star-glass. Do not be afraid. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>ld it up and watch!'</p>
<p>Then <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> stepped <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name> the great grey net, and hewed it with a wide sweeping stroke, drawing the bitter edge swiftly across a ladder of close-strung cords, and at once sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>nging away. The blue-gleaming blade shore through them like a scythe through grass, and they leaped and w<name type="GPE">ri</name>thed and then hung loose. A great rent was made.</p>
<p>Stroke after stroke he dealt, until at last all the web within his reach was shattered, and the upper portion blew and swayed like a loose veil in the incoming wind. The trap was broken.</p>
<p>`Come! ' c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. `On! On! ' Wild joy at their escape from the very mouth of despair suddenly filled all his mind. His head whirled as with a draught of po<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>t wine. He sprang out, shouting as he came.</p>
<p>It seemed light in that dark land to his eyes that had passed through the den of <name type="TIME">night</name>. The great smokes had <name type="GPE">ri</name>sen and grown thinner, and the last <name type="TIME">hour</name>s of a sombre <name type="DATE">day</name> were passing; the red glare of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> had died away in sullen gloom. Yet it seemed to <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> that he looked upon <name type="TIME">a <name type="TIME">morning</name></name> of sudden hope. Almost he had reached the summit of the wall. Only a little higher now. The <name type="NORP">Cleft</name>, <name type="PERSON">Ci<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name> Ungol, was before him, a dim notch in the black <name type="GPE">ri</name>dge, and the horns of rock darkling in the sky on either side. A short race, a sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>nter's course and he would be through!</p>
<p>`The pass, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>! ' he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed, not heeding the sh<name type="GPE">ri</name>llness of his voice, that released from the choking airs of the tunnel rang out now high and wild. 'The pass! Run, run, and we'll be through-through before any <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> can stop us! '</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> came up behind as fast as he could urge his legs; but glad as he was to be free, he was uneasy, and as he ran, he kept on glancing back at the dark arch of the tunnel, fea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng to see eyes, or some shape beyond his imagining, sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng out in pursuit. Too little did he or his master know of the craft of <name type="FAC">Shelob</name>. She had many exits from her lair.</p>
<p>There <name type="GPE">agelong</name> she had dwelt, an evil thing in spider-form, even such as once of old had lived in the Land of the <name type="ORG">Elves</name> in the <name type="LOC">West</name> that is now under the <name type="LOC">Sea</name>, such as <name type="PERSON">Beren</name> fought in the <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s of Terror in <name type="PERSON">Do<name type="GPE">ri</name>ath</name>, and so came to L�thien upon the green sward amid the hemlocks in the moonlight <name type="DATE">long ago</name>. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w <name type="FAC">Shelob</name> came there, flying from ruin, no tale tells, for out of the <name type="EVENT">Dark Years</name> few tales have come. But still she was there, who was there before <name type="ORG">Sauron</name>, and before the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of <name type="FAC">Barad-d</name>�r; and she served n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> but herself, d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nking the blood of <name type="ORG">Elves</name> and <name type="ORG">Men</name>, bloated and grown fat with endless brooding on her feasts, weaving webs of shadow; for all living things were her food, and her vomit darkness. <name type="LOC">Far</name> and wide her lesser broods, bastards of the miserable mates, her own offsp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng, that she slew, spread from <name type="LOC">glen</name> to <name type="LOC">glen</name>, from the <name type="FAC">Ephel D�ath</name> to the eastern hills, to <name type="PERSON">Dol Guldur</name> and the fastnesses of <name type="GPE">Mirkwood</name>. But n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> could <name type="GPE">ri</name>val her, <name type="FAC">Shelob</name> the Great, last child of <name type="ORG">Ungoliant</name> to trouble the unhappy world.</p>
<p>Already, <name type="DATE">year</name>s before, <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> had beheld her, Sm�agol who p<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed into all dark holes, and in past <name type="DATE">day</name>s he had bowed and worshipped her, and the darkness of her evil will walked through all the ways of his wea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ness beside him, cutting him off from light and from regret. And he had promised to b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng her food. But her lust was not his lust. Little she knew of or cared for towers, or <name type="GPE">ri</name>ngs, or anything devised by mind or hand, who only desired death for all others, mind and body, and for herself a glut of life. al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, swollen till the mountains could no longer hold her up and the darkness could not contain her.</p>
<p>But that desire was yet far away, and long now had she been hungry, lurking in her den, while the power of <name type="ORG">Sauron</name> grew, and light and living things forsook his borders; and the city in the valley was dead, and no <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name> or Man came near, only the unhappy <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s. Poor food and wary. But she must eat, and however busily they delved new winding passages from the pass and from their tower, ever she found some way to snare them. But she lusted for sweeter meat. And <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> had brought it to her.</p>
<p>`We'll see, we'll see,' he said of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> to himself, when the evil mood was on him, as he walked the dangerous road from <name type="ORG">Emyn Muil</name> to <name type="PERSON">Morgul</name> Vale, 'we'll see. It may well be, O yes, it may well be that when She throws away the b<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s and the empty garments, we shall find it, we shall get it, the Precious, a reward for poor Sm�agol who b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ngs nice food. And we'll save the Precious, as we promised. O yes. And when we've got it safe, then She'll know it, O yes, then we'll pay Her back, my precious. Then we'll pay every<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> back! '</p>
<p>So he thought in an inner chamber of his cunning, which he still hoped to hide from her, even when he had come to her again and had bowed low before her while his companions slept.</p>
<p>And as for <name type="ORG">Sauron</name>: he knew where she lurked. It pleased him that she should dwell there hungry but unabated in malice, a more sure watch upon that ancient path into his land than any other that his skill could have devised. And <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s, they were useful slaves, but he had them in plenty. If now and again <name type="FAC">Shelob</name> caught them to stay her appetite, she was welcome: he could spare them. And sometimes as a man may cast a dainty to his cat (_his cat_ he calls her, but she owns him not) <name type="ORG">Sauron</name> would send her p<name type="GPE">ri</name>s<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>rs that he had no better uses for: he would have them d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ven to her hole, and report brought back to him of the play she made.</p>
<p>So they both lived, delighting in their own devices, and feared no assault, nor wrath, nor any end of their wickedness. Never yet had any fly escaped from <name type="FAC">Shelob</name>'s webs, and the greater now was her rage and hunger.</p>
<p>But nothing of this evil which they had stirred up against them did poor <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> know, except that a fear was growing on him, a menace which he could not see; and such a w<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name> did it become that it was a burden to him to run, and his feet seemed leaden.</p>
<p>Dread was round him, and enemies before him in the pass, and his master was in a fey mood running heedlessly to meet them. Turning his eyes away from the shadow behind and the deep gloom beneath the cliff upon his left, he looked ahead, and he saw <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> things that increased his dismay. He saw that the sword which <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> still held unsheathed was glitte<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng with blue flame; and he saw that though the sky behind was now dark. still the window in the tower was glowing red.</p>
<p>`<name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s! <q>' he muttered. `We'll never rush it like this. There's <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s about, and worse than <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s.'</q> Then returning quickly to his long habit of <name type="ORG">sec</name>recy, he closed his hand about the precious <name type="ORG">Phial</name> which he still bore. Red with his own living blood his hand sh<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> for a moment, and then he thrust the revealing light deep into a pocket near his breast and drew his <name type="ORG">elven</name>-cloak about him. Now he t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed to quicken his pace. His master was gaining on him; already he was <name type="CARDINAL">some <name type="CARDINAL">twenty</name></name> st<name type="GPE">ri</name>des ahead, flitting on like a shadow; soon he would be lost to sight in that grey world.</p>
<p>Hardly had <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> hidden the light of the star-glass when she came. A little way ahead and to his left he saw suddenly, issuing from a black hole of shadow under the cliff, the most loathly shape that he had ever beheld, hor<name type="GPE">ri</name>ble beyond the horror of an evil dream. Most like a spider she was, but huger than the great hunting beasts, and more ter<name type="GPE">ri</name>ble than they because of the evil purpose in her remorseless eyes. Those same eyes that he had thought daunted and defeated, there they were lit with a fell light again, cluste<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng in her out-thrust head. Great horns she had, and behind her short stalk-like neck was her huge swollen body, a vast bloated bag, swaying and sagging between her legs; its great bulk was black, blotched with livid <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ks, but the belly underneath was pale and luminous and gave forth a s<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ch. Her legs were bent, with great knobbed joints high above her back, and <name type="PERSON">hai</name>rs that stuck out like steel spines, and at each leg's end there was a claw.</p>
<p>As soon as she had squeezed her soft squel<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g body and its folded limbs out of the upper exit from her lair, she moved with a hor<name type="GPE">ri</name>ble speed, now running on her creaking legs, now making a sudden bound. She was between <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> and his master. Either she did not see <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, or she avoided him for the moment as the bearer of the light` and fixed all her in<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>t upon <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> prey, upon <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, bereft of his <name type="ORG">Phial</name>, running heedless up the path, unaware yet of his pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>l. <name type="PERSON">Swift</name>ly he ran, but <name type="FAC">Shelob</name> was swifter; in a few leaps she would have him.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> gasped and gathered all his remaining breath to shout. '<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok out behind! ' he yelled. '<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok out master! I'm' � but suddenly his cry was stifled.</p>
<p>A long clammy hand went over his mouth and another caught him by the neck, while something wrapped itself about his leg. Taken off his guard he toppled backwards into the arms of his attacker.</p>
<p><name type="ORG">`Go</name>t him! <q>' hissed <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> in his ear. <name type="PERSON">`A</name>t last, my precious, we've got him, yes, the <name type="ORG">nassty</name> hobbit. We takes this <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. She'll get the other. O yes, <name type="FAC">Shelob</name> will get him, not Sm�agol: he promised; he won't hurt Master at all. But he's got you, you <name type="ORG">nassty</name> filthy little sneak!'</q> He spat on <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>'s neck.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Fury</name> at the treachery, and desperation at the delay when his master was in deadly pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>l, gave to <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> a sudden violence and strength that was far beyond anything that <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> had expected from this slow stupid hobbit, as he thought him. Not <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> himself could have twisted more quickly or more fiercely. His hold on <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>'s mouth slipped, and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> ducked and lunged forward again, trying to tear away from the g<name type="GPE">ri</name>p on his neck. His sword was still in his hand, and on his left arm, hanging by its thong, was <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir's staff. Desperately he t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed to turn and stab his enemy. But <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> was too quick. His long <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght arm shot out, and he grabbed <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>'s w<name type="GPE">ri</name>st: his fingers were like a vice; slowly and relentlessly he bent the hand down and forward, till with a cry of pain <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> released the sword and it fell to the ground; and all the while <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>'s other hand was tigh<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing on <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>'s throat.</p>
<p>Then <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> played his last t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ck. With all his strength he pulled away and got his feet firmly planted; then suddenly he drove his legs against the ground and with his whole force hurled himself backwards.</p>
<p>Not expecting even this simple t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ck from <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> fell over with <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> on top, and he received the w<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name> of the sturdy hobbit in his s<name type="PERSON">tom</name>ach. A sharp hiss came out of him, and for a <name type="ORG">sec</name>ond his hand upon <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>'s throat loosened; but his fingers still g<name type="GPE">ri</name>pped the sword-hand. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> tore himself forward and away, and stood up, and then quickly he wheeled away to his <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght, pivoted on the w<name type="GPE">ri</name>st held by <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>. Laying hold of the staff with his left hand, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> swung it up, and down it came with a whistling crack on <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>'s outstretched arm, just below the elbow.</p>
<p>With a squeal <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> let go. Then <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> waded in; not waiting to change the staff from left to <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght he dealt another savage blow. Quick as a snake <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> slithered aside. and the stroke aimed at his head fell across his back. The staff cracked and broke. That was enough for him. Grabbing from behind was an old game of his, and seldom had he failed in it. But this time, misled by spite, he had made the mistake of speaking and gloating before he had both hands on his victim's neck. Everything had g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> wrong with his beautiful plan, since that hor<name type="GPE">ri</name>ble light had so unexpectedly appeared in the darkness. And now he was face to face with a fu<name type="GPE">ri</name>ous enemy, little less than his own size. This fight was not for him. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> swept up his sword from the ground and raised it. <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> squealed, and sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>nging aside on to all <name type="CARDINAL">four</name>s, he jumped away in <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> big bound like a frog. Before <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> could reach him, he was off, running with amazing speed back towards the tunnel.</p>
<p><name type="PRODUCT">Sword</name> in hand <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> went after him. For the moment he had forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> everything else but the red fury in his brain and the desire to kill <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>. But before he could overtake him, <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> was g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. Then as the dark hole stood before him and the s<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ch came out to meet him, like a clap of thunder the thought of <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and the monster smote upon <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>'s mind. He spun round, and rushed wildly up the path, calling and calling his master's name. He was too late. So far <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>'s plot had succeeded.</p>
</chapter><chapter num="10"><heading>Chapter 10</heading>
<p>The Choices of <name type="PERSON">Master <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>wise</name></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> was lying face upward on the ground and the monster was bending over him, so in<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>t upon her victim that she took no heed of <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> and his c<name type="GPE">ri</name>es, until he was close at hand. As he rushed up he saw that <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> was already bound in cords, wound about him from ankle to shoulder, and the monster with her great forelegs was beginning <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> to lift, <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> to drag his body away.</p>
<p>On the near side of him lay, gleaming on the ground, his <name type="ORG">elven</name>-blade, where it had fallen useless from his grasp. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> did not wait to wonder what was to be <name type="PERSON">don</name>e, or whether he was brave, or loyal, or filled with rage. He sprang forward with a yell, and seized his master's sword in his left hand. Then he charged. No onslaught more fierce was ever seen in the savage world of beasts; where some desperate small creature armed with little teeth al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, will sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng upon a tower of horn and hide that stands above its fallen mate.</p>
<p>Disturbed as if out of some gloating dream by his small yell she turned slowly the dreadful malice of her glance upon him. But almost before she was aware that a fury was upon her greater than any she had known in <name type="DATE">countless <name type="DATE">year</name>s</name>, the shining sword bit upon her foot and shore away the claw. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> sprang in, inside the arches of her legs, and with a quick upthrust of his other hand stabbed at the clustered eyes upon her lowered head. <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> great eye went dark.</p>
<p>Now the miserable creature was <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght under her, for the moment out of the reach of her sting and of her claws. Her vast belly was above him with its put<name type="GPE">ri</name>d light, and the s<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ch of it almost smote him down. Still his fury held for <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> more blow, and before she could sink upon him, smothe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng him and all his little impudence of courage, he slashed the b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght <name type="ORG">elven</name>-blade across her with desperate strength.</p>
<p>But <name type="FAC">Shelob</name> was not as dragons are, no softer spot had she save only her eyes. Knobbed and pitted with corruption was her age-old hide, but ever thickened from within with layer on layer of evil growth. The blade scored it with a dreadful gash, but those hideous folds could not be pierced by any strength of men, not though <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name> or <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Dwarf</name> should forge the steel or the hand of <name type="PERSON">Beren</name> or of T�<name type="GPE">ri</name>n wield it. She yielded to the stroke, and then heaved up the great bag of her belly high above <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>'s head. Poison frothed and bubbled from the wound. Now splaying her legs she drove her huge bulk down on him again. Too soon. For <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> still stood upon his feet, and dropping his own sword, with both hands he held the <name type="ORG">elven</name>-blade point upwards, <name type="PERSON">fen</name>ding off that ghastly roof; and so <name type="FAC">Shelob</name>, with the d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ving force of her own cruel will, with strength greater than any war<name type="GPE">ri</name>or's hand, thrust herself upon a bitter spike. <name type="PERSON">Deep</name>, deep it p<name type="GPE">ri</name>cked, as <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> was crushed slowly to the ground.</p>
<p>No such anguish had <name type="FAC">Shelob</name> ever known, or dreamed of knowing, in all her long world of wickedness. Not the doughtiest soldier of old <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>, nor the most savage <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name> entrapped, had ever thus endured her, or set blade to her beloved flesh. A shudder went through her. Heaving up again, wren<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g away from the pain, she bent her w<name type="GPE">ri</name>thing limbs beneath her and sprang backwards in a convulsive leap.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> had fallen to his knees by <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s head, his senses reeling in the foul s<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ch, his <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> hands still g<name type="GPE">ri</name>pping the hilt of the sword. <name type="PERSON">Thr</name>ough the mist before his eyes he was aware dimly of <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s face and stubbornly he fought to master himself and to drag himself out of the swoon that was upon him. Slowly he raised his head and saw her, only a few paces away, eyeing him, her beak drabbling a spittle of venom, and a green ooze t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ckling from below her wounded eye. There she crouched, her shudde<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng belly splayed upon the ground, the great bows of her legs quive<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng, as she gathered herself for another sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng-this time to crush and sting to death: no little bite of poison to still the struggling of her meat; this time to slay and then to rend.</p>
<p>Even as <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> himself crouched, looking at her, seeing his death in her eyes, a thought came to him, as if some remote voice had spoken. and he fumbled in his breast with his left hand, and found what he sought: cold and hard and solid it seemed to his touch in a phan<name type="PERSON">tom</name> world of horror, the <name type="ORG">Phial</name> of <name type="PERSON">Galad<name type="GPE">ri</name>el</name>.</p>
<p>'<name type="PERSON">Galad<name type="GPE">ri</name>el</name>! ' he said faintly, and then he heard voices far off but clear: the crying of the <name type="ORG">Elves</name> as they walked under the stars in the beloved shadows of the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>, and the music of the <name type="ORG">Elves</name> as it came through his sleep in the <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>l of <name type="ORG">Fire</name> in the house of <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name>.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Gilthoniel</name> A <name type="PERSON">Elbereth</name>!</p>
<p>And then his tongue was loosed and his voice c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed in a language which he did not know:</p>
<p>A <name type="PERSON">Elbereth</name> <name type="PERSON">Gilthoniel</name></p>
<p>o <name type="ORG">menel</name> <name type="ORG">palan-di<name type="GPE">ri</name>el</name>,</p>
<p><name type="ORG">le nallon</name> s<name type="ORG">� di</name>'nguruthos!</p>
<p>A <name type="PERSON">tiro nin</name>, Fanuilos!</p>
<p>And with that he staggered to his feet and was <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>wise the hobbit, <name type="LOC">Hamfast</name>'s son, again.</p>
<p>`Now come, you filth!<q>' he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed. `You've hurt my master, you brute, and you'll pay for it. We're going on; but we'll settle with you <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>. Come on, and taste it again!'</q></p>
<p>As if his indomitable spi<name type="GPE">ri</name>t had set its po<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>cy in motion, the glass blazed suddenly like a white torch in his hand. It flamed like a star that leaping from the firmament sears the dark air with intolerable light. No such terror out of heaven had ever burned in <name type="FAC">Shelob</name>'s face before. The beams of it entered into her wounded head and scored it with unbearable pain, and the dreadful infection of light spread from eye to eye. She fell back beating the air with her forelegs, her sight blasted by inner lightnings, her mind in agony. Then turning her maimed head away, she rolled aside and began to crawl, claw by claw, towards the opening in the dark cliff behind.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> came on. He was reeling like a drunken man, but he came on. And <name type="FAC">Shelob</name> cowed at last, shrunken in defeat, jerked and quivered as she t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed to has<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> from him. She reached the hole, and squeezing down, leaving a trail of green-yellow slime, she slipped in, even as <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> hewed a last stroke at her dragging legs. Then he fell to the ground.</p>
<p><name type="FAC">Shelob</name> was g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>; and whether she lay long in her lair, nursing her malice and her misery, and in slow <name type="DATE">year</name>s of darkness healed herself from within, rebuilding her clustered eyes, until with hunger like death she spun once more her dreadful snares in the <name type="LOC">glen</name>s of the <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s of <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>, this tale does not tell.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> was left al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. Wea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ly, as the <name type="TIME">evening</name> of <name type="WORK_OF_ART">the Nameless Land</name> fell upon the place of battle, he crawled back to his master.</p>
<p><q>'Master, dear master,'</q> he said, but <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> did not speak. As he had run forward, eager, rejoicing to be free, <name type="FAC">Shelob</name> with hideous speed had come behind and with <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> swift stroke had stung him in the neck. He lay now pale, and heard no voice. and did not move.</p>
<p>`Master, dear master! ' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, and through a long silence waited. lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing in vain.</p>
<p>Then as quickly as he could he cut away the binding cords and laid his head upon <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s breast and to his mouth, but no stir of life could he find, nor feel the faintest flutter of the heart. Of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> he cha<name type="ORG">fed</name> his master's hands and feet, and touched his brow, but all were cold.</p>
<p>`<name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>! <q>' he called. '<name type="PERSON">Don</name>'t leave me here al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>! It's your <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> calling. <name type="PERSON">Don</name>'t go where I can't follow! Wake up, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>! O wake up, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, me dear, me dear. Wake up!'</q></p>
<p>Then anger surged over hint, and he ran about his master's body in a rage, stabbing the air, and smiting the st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s, and shouting challenges. Presently he came back, and bending looked at <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s face, pale beneath him in the <name type="TIME">dusk</name>. And suddenly he saw that he was in the picture that was revealed to him in the mirror of <name type="PERSON">Galad<name type="GPE">ri</name>el</name> in L�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en: <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> with a pale face lying fast asleep under a great dark cliff. Or fast asleep he had thought then. <name type="PERSON">`He</name>'s dead! ' he said. 'Not asleep, dead! ' And as he said it, as if the words had set the venom to its work again. it seemed to him that the hue of the face grew livid green.</p>
<p>And then black despair came down on him, and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> bowed to the ground, and drew his grey hood over his head, and <name type="TIME">night</name> came into his heart, and he knew no more.</p>
<p>When at last the blackness passed, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> looked up and shadows were about him; but for how m<name type="TIME">any minute</name>s or <name type="TIME">hour</name>s the world had g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> dragging on he could not tell. He was still in the same place, and still his master lay beside him dead. The mountains had not crumbled nor the <name type="LOC">earth</name> fallen into ruin.</p>
<p>'What shall I do, what shall I do? ' he said. `Did I come all this way with him for nothing? ' And then he remembered his own voice speaking words that at the time he did not understand himself, at the beginning of their journey: _I have something to do before the end. I must see it through, sir, if you understand_.</p>
<p>`But what can I do? Not leave Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> dead, unbu<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed on the top of the mountains, and go home? Or go on? Go on?<q>' he repeated, and for a moment doubt and fear shook him. <name type="ORG">`Go</name> on? Is that what I've got to do? And leave him?'</q></p>
<p>Then at last he began to weep; and going to <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> he composed his body, and folded his cold hands upon his breast, and wrapped his cloak about him; and he laid his own sword at <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> side, and the staff that <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir had given at the other.</p>
<p><q>'If I'm to go on,'</q> he said, `then I must take your sword, by your leave, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, but I'll put this <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> to lie by you, as it lay by the old king in the barrow; and you've got your beautiful <name type="PERSON">mith<name type="GPE">ri</name>l</name> coat from old Mr. <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>. And your star-glass, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, you did lend it to me and I'll need it, for I'll be always in the dark now. It's too good for me, and the <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> gave it to you, but maybe she'd understand. Do _you_ understand, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>? I've got to go on.'</p>
<p>But he could not go, not yet. He knelt and held <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s hand and could not release it. And time went by and still he knelt, holding his master's hand, and in his heart keeping a debate.</p>
<p>Now he t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed to find strength to tear himself away and go on a l<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>ly journey � for vengeance. If once he could go, his anger would bear him down all the roads of the world, pursuing, until he had him at last: <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>. Then <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> would die in a corner. But that was not what he had set out to do. It would not be worth while to leave his master for that. It would not b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng him back. Nothing would. They had better both be dead together. And that too would be a l<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>ly journey.</p>
<p>He looked on the b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght point of the sword. He thought of the places behind where there was a black b<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk and an empty fall into nothingness. There was no escape that way. That was to do nothing, not even to g<name type="GPE">ri</name>eve. That was not what he had set out to do. 'What am I to do then? ' he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed again, and now he seemed plainly to know the hard answer: _see it through_. Another l<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>ly journey, and the worst.</p>
<p>`What? Me, al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, go to <name type="WORK_OF_ART">the Crack of Doom</name> and all? <q>' He quailed still, but the resolve grew. `What? _Me_ take the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> from _him_? The <name type="ORG">Council</name> gave it to him.'</q></p>
<p>But the answer came at once: <name type="PERSON">`A</name>nd the <name type="ORG">Council</name> gave him companions, so that the errand should not fail. And you are the last of all the <name type="ORG">Company</name>. The errand must not fail.'</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`I</name> wish I wasn't the last,<q>' he groaned. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> wish old <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> was hare or somebody. Why am I left all al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> to make up my mind? I'm sure to go wrong. And it's not for me to go taking the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>, putting myself forward.'</q></p>
<p><q>'But you haven't put yourself forward; you've been put forward. And as for not being the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght and proper person, why, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> wasn't as you might say, nor Mr. <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>. They didn't choose themselves.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`A</name>h well, I must make up my own mind. I will make it up. But I'll be sure to go wrong: that'd be <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> <name type="PERSON">Gamgee</name> all over.</p>
<p><q>'Let me see now: if we're found here, or Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s found, and that Thing's on him, well, the Enemy will get it. And that's the end of all of us, of <name type="PERSON">Lo</name><name type="GPE">ri</name>en, and <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name>, and the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> and all. And there s no time to lose, or it'll be the end anyway. The war's begun, and more than likely things are all going the Enemy's way already. No chance to go back with It and get advice or permission. No, it's sit here till they come and kill me over master's body, and gets It: or take It and go.'</q> He drew a deep breath. 'Then take It, it is! '</p>
<p>He stooped. Very gently he undid the clasp at the neck and slipped his hand inside <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s tunic; then with his other hand raising the head, he kissed the cold forehead, and softly drew the c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>n over it. And then the head lay quietly back again in rest. No change came over the still face, and by that more than by all other tokens <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> was convinced at last that <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> had died and laid aside the <name type="PRODUCT">Quest</name>.</p>
<p><name type="ORG">`Go</name>od-bye, master, my dear! ' he murmured. 'Forgive your <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. He'll come back to this spot when the job's <name type="PERSON">don</name>e � if he manages it. And then he'll not leave you again. Rest you quiet till I come; and may no foul creature come anigh you! And if the <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> could hear me and give me <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> wish, I would wish to come back and find you again. Good-bye! '</p>
<p>And then he bent his own neck and put the c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>n upon it, and at once his head was bowed to the ground with the w<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name> of the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>, as if a great st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> had been strung on him. But slowly, as if the w<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name> became less, or new strength grew in him, he raised his head, and then with a great effort got to his feet and found that he could walk and bear his burden. And for a moment he lifted up the <name type="ORG">Phial</name> and looked down at his master, and the light burned gently now with the soft radiance of the <name type="TIME">evening</name>-star in <name type="DATE">summer</name>, and in that light <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s face was fair of hue again, pale but beautiful with an elvish beauty, as of <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> who has long passed the shadows. And with the bitter comfort of that last sight <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> turned and hid the light and stumbled on into the growing dark.</p>
<p>He had not far to go. The tunnel was some way behind; the <name type="NORP">Cleft</name> <name type="CARDINAL">a couple of <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name></name> yards ahead, or less. The path was visible in the <name type="TIME">dusk</name>` a deep rut worn in ages of passage, running now gently up in a long trough with cliffs on either side. The trough narrowed rapidly. Soon <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> came to a long flight of broad shallow steps. Now the orc-tower was <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght above him, frowning black, and in it the red eye glowed. Now he was hidden in the dark shadow under it. He was coming to the top of the steps and was in the <name type="NORP">Cleft</name> at last.</p>
<p><q>'I've made up my mind,'</q> he kept saying to himself. But he had not. Though he had <name type="PERSON">don</name>e his best to think it out, what he was doing was altogether against the grain of his nature. `Have I got it wrong? ' he muttered. `What ought I to have <name type="PERSON">don</name>e? '</p>
<p>As the sheer sides of the <name type="NORP">Cleft</name> closed about him, before he reached the actual summit, before he looked at last on the path descending into <name type="WORK_OF_ART">the Nameless Land</name>. he turned. For a moment, motionless in intolerable doubt, he looked back. He could still see, like a small blot in the gathe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng gloom, the mouth of the tunnel; and he thought he could see or guess where <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> lay. He fancied there was a glimmer on the ground down there, or perhaps it was some t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ck of his tears, as he peered out at that high stony place where all his life had fallen in ruin.</p>
<p><q>'If only I could have my wish, my <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> wish,'</q> he sighed, `to go back and find him! ' Then at last he turned to the road in front and took a few steps: the heaviest and the most reluctant he had ever taken.</p>
<p>Only a few steps; and now only a few more and he would be going down and would never see that high place again. And then suddenly he heard c<name type="GPE">ri</name>es and voices. He stood still as st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>-voices. They were behind him and before him. A noise of tramping feet and harsh shouts: <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s were coming <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name> the <name type="NORP">Cleft</name> from the far side, from some entry to the tower, perhaps. Tramping feet and shouts behind. He wheeled round. He saw small red lights, torches, winking away below there as they issued from the tunnel. At last the hunt was up. The red eye of the tower had not been blind. He was caught.</p>
<p>Now the flicker of approa<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g torches and the clink of steel ahead was very near. In <name type="TIME">a minute</name> they would reach the top and be on him. He had taken too long in making up his mind, and now it was no good. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w could he escape, or save himself, or save the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>? The <name type="ORG">Ring</name>. He was not aware of any thought or decision. He simply found himself drawing out the c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>n and taking the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> in his hand. The head of the orc-company appeared in the <name type="NORP">Cleft</name> <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght before him. Then he put it on.</p>
<p>The world changed, and a single moment of time was filled with <name type="TIME">an <name type="TIME">hour</name></name> of thought. At once he was aware that hea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng was sharpened while sight was dimmed, but otherwise than in <name type="FAC">Shelob</name>'s lair. All things about him now were not dark but vague; while he himself was there in a grey hazy world, al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, like a small black solid rock and the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>, weighing down his left hand, was like an orb of hot gold. He did not feel invisible at all, but hor<name type="GPE">ri</name>bly and uniquely visible; and he knew that somewhere an <name type="PRODUCT">Eye</name> was sear<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g for him.</p>
<p>He heard the crack of st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, and the murmur of water far off in <name type="PERSON">Morgul</name> Vale; and down away under the rock the bubbling misery of <name type="FAC">Shelob</name>, groping, lost in some blind passage; and voices in the dungeons of the tower; and the c<name type="GPE">ri</name>es of the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s as they came out of the tunnel; and dea<name type="PERSON">fen</name>ing, roa<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng in his ears, the crash of the feet and the rending clamour of the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s before him. He shrank against the cliff. But they <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ched up like a phan<name type="PERSON">tom</name> company, grey distorted figures in a mist, only dreams of fear with pale flames in their hands. And they passed him by. He cowered, trying to creep away into some cranny and to hide.</p>
<p>He lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed. The <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s from the tunnel and the others <name type="PERSON">mar</name><name type="PERSON">chin</name>g down had sighted <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> another, and both parties were now hurrying and shouting. He heard them both clearly, and he understood what they said. Perhaps the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> gave understanding of tongues, or simply understanding, especially of the servants of <name type="ORG">Sauron</name> its maker, so that if he gave heed, he understood and translated the thought to himself. Certainly the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> had grown greatly in power as it approached the places of its forging; but <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> thing it did not confer, and that was courage. At present <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> still thought only of hiding, of lying low till all was quiet again; and he lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed anxiously. He could not tell how near the voices were, the words seemed almost in his ears.</p>
<p>'<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>la! <name type="GPE">Gorbag</name>! What are you doing up here? Had enough of war already? '</p>
<p>'Orders, you lubber. And what are you doing, <name type="ORG">Shagrat</name>? Tired of lurking up there? Thinking of coming down to fight? '</p>
<p>'Orders to you. I'm in command of this pass. So speak civil. What's your report? '</p>
<p><q>'Nothing.'</q></p>
<p>`Hai! <name type="PERSON">hai</name>! <name type="PERSON">yoi</name>!' A yell broke into the exchanges of the leaders. The <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s lower down had suddenly seen something. They began to run. So did the others.</p>
<p>`Hai! <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>la! Here's something! Lying <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght in the road. A spy, a spy! ' There was a hoot of snarling horns and a babel of baying voices.</p>
<p>With a dreadful stroke <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> was wakened from his cowe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng mood. They had seen his master. What would they do? He had heard tales of the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s to make the blood run cold. It could not be borne. He sprang up. He flung the <name type="PRODUCT">Quest</name> and all his decisions away, and fear and doubt with them. He knew now where his place was and had been: at his master's side, though what he could do there was not clear. Back he ran down the steps, down the path towards <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.</p>
<p>`<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w many are there?<q>' he thought. `<name type="CARDINAL">Thirty</name> or <name type="CARDINAL">forty</name> from the tower at least, and a lot more than that from down below, I guess. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w many can I kill before they get me? They'll see the flame of the sword, as soon as I draw it, and they'll get me so<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>r or later. I wonder if any song will ever mention it: <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>wise fell in <name type="PRODUCT">the High Pass</name> and made a wall of bodies round his master. No, no song. Of course not, for the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>'ll be found, and there'll be no more songs. I can't help it. My place is by Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. They must understand that � <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name> and the <name type="ORG">Council</name>, and the great <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rds and Ladies with all their wisdom. Their plans have g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> wrong. I can't be their <name type="ORG">Ring</name>-bearer. Not without Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.'</q></p>
<p>But the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s were out of his dim sight now. He had had no time to consider himself, but now he realized that he was weary, weary almost to exhaustion: his legs would not carry him as he wished. He was too slow. The path seemed miles long. Where had they all got to in the mist?</p>
<p>There they were again! A good way ahead still. A cluster of figures round something lying on the ground; a few seemed to be darting this way and that, bent like dogs on a trail. He t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed to make a spurt.</p>
<p><q>'Come on, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>! ' he said, `or you'll be too late again.'</q> He loosened the sword in its sheath. In <name type="TIME">a minute</name> he would draw it, and then-</p>
<p>There was a wild clamour, hooting and laughing, as something was lifted from the ground. 'Ya hoi! <name type="PERSON">Ya har<name type="GPE">ri</name> hoi</name>! Up! Up! '</p>
<p>Then a voice shouted: `Now off! The quick way. Back to the <name type="ORG">Undergate</name>! She'll not trouble us to<name type="TIME">night</name> by all the signs.' The whole band of orc-figures began to move. <name type="CARDINAL">Four</name> in the middle were carrying a body high on their shoulders. `Ya hoi! '</p>
<p>They had taken <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s body. They were off. He could not catch them up. Still he laboured on. The <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s reached the tunnel and were passing in. Those with the burden went <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>, and behind them there was a good deal of struggling and jostling. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> came on. He drew the sword, a flicker of blue in his wave<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng hand, but they did not see it. Even as he came panting up, the last of them vanished into the black hole.</p>
<p>For a moment he stood, gasping, clut<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g his breast. Then he drew his sleeve across his face, wiping away the g<name type="GPE">ri</name>me, and sweat, and tears. 'Curse the filth! ' he said, and sprang after them into the darkness.</p>
<p>It no longer seemed very dark to him in the tunnel, rather it was as if he had stepped out of a thin mist into a heavier fog. His wea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ness was growing but his will hardened all the more. He thought he could see the light of torches a little way ahead, but try as he would, he could not catch them up. <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s go fast in tunnels, and this tunnel they knew well.; for in spite of <name type="FAC">Shelob</name> they were forced to use it of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> as the swiftest way from the Dead <name type="LOC">City</name> over the mountains. In what far-off time the main tunnel and the great round pit had been made, where <name type="FAC">Shelob</name> had taken up her abode in <name type="DATE">ages past</name>. they did not know: but many byways they had themselves delved about in on either side, so as to escape the lair in their goings to and fro on the business of their masters. <name type="TIME">To<name type="TIME">night</name></name> they did not in<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>d to go far down. but were has<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing to find a side-passage that led back to their watch-tower on the cliff. Most of them were gleeful, delighted with what they had found and seen, and as they ran they gabbled and yammered after the fashion of their kind. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> heard the noise of their harsh voices, flat and hard in the dead air, and he could distinguish <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> voices from among all the rest: they were louder, and nearer to him. The captains of the <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> parties seemed to be b<name type="GPE">ri</name>nging up the rear, debating as they went.</p>
<p><q>'Can't you stop your rabble making such a racket, <name type="ORG">Shagrat</name>? ' grunted the <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. `We <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t <name type="FAC">Shelob</name> on us.'</q></p>
<p><name type="ORG">`Go</name> on, <name type="GPE">Gorbag</name>! Yours are making more than <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> the noise,<q>' said the other. `But let the lads play! No need to worry about <name type="FAC">Shelob</name> for a bit, I reckon. She's sat on a nail, it seems, and we shan't cry about that. Didn't you see: a nasty mess all the way back to that cursed crack of hers? If we've stopped it once, we've stopped it <name type="CARDINAL">a <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name></name> times. So let 'em laugh. And we've struck a bit of luck at last: got something that <name type="GPE">Lugb</name>�rz <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ts.'</q></p>
<p>'<name type="GPE">Lugb</name>�rz <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ts it, eh? What is it, d'you think? <name type="PERSON">Elvish</name> it looked to me, but undersized. What's the danger in a thing like that? '</p>
<p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Don</name>'t know till we've had a look.'</q></p>
<p><q>'<name type="ORG">Oho</name>! So they haven't told you what to expect? They <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t tell us all they know, do they? Not by <name type="CARDINAL">half</name>. But they can make mistakes, even the Top <name type="CARDINAL">One</name>s can.'</q></p>
<p>`Sh, <name type="GPE">Gorbag</name>!<q>' <name type="ORG">Shagrat</name>'s voice was lowered, so that even with his strangely sharpened hea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> could only just catch what was said. 'They may, but they've got eyes and ears everywhere; some among my lot, as like as not. But there's no doubt about it, they're troubled about something. The Nazg�l down below are, by your account; and <name type="GPE">Lugb</name>�rz is too. Something nearly slipped.'</q></p>
<p>`Nearly, you say! ' said <name type="GPE">Gorbag</name>.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`A</name>ll <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght,<q>' said <name type="ORG">Shagrat</name>, `but we'll talk of that later: Wait till we get to the Under-way. There's a place there where we can talk a bit, while the lads go on.'</q></p>
<p>Shortly afterwards <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> saw the torches disappear. Then there was a rumbling noise, and just as he hur<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed up, a bump. As far as he could guess the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s had turned and g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> into the very opening which <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and he had t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed and found blocked. It was still blocked.</p>
<p>There seemed to be a great st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> in the way, but the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s had got through somehow, for he could hear their voices on the other side. They were still running along, deeper and deeper into the mountain, back towards the tower. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> felt desperate. They were carrying off his master's body for some foul purpose and he could not follow. He thrust and pushed at the block, and he threw himself against it, but it did not yield. Then not far inside, or so he thought, he heard the <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> captains' voices talking again. He stood still lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing for a little hoping perhaps to learn something useful. Perhaps <name type="GPE">Gorbag</name>, who seemed to belong to Minas <name type="PERSON">Morgul</name>, would come out, and he could then slip in.</p>
<p>`No, I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t know,<q>' said <name type="GPE">Gorbag</name>'s voice. `The messages go through quicker than anything could fly, as a rule. But I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t enquire how it's <name type="PERSON">don</name>e. Safest not to. Grr! Those Nazg�l give me the creeps. And they skin the body off you as soon as look at you, and leave you all cold in the dark on the other side. But He likes 'em; they're His favou<name type="GPE">ri</name>tes nowa<name type="DATE">day</name>s, so it's no use grumbling. I tell you, it's no game serving down in the city.'</q></p>
<p>`You should try being up here with <name type="FAC">Shelob</name> for company,' said <name type="ORG">Shagrat</name>.</p>
<p><q>'I'd like to try somewhere where there's n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of 'em. But the war's on now, and when that's over things may be easier.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`I</name>t's going well, they say.'</p>
<p><q>'They would.'</q> grunted <name type="GPE">Gorbag</name>. `We'll see. But anyway, if it does go well, there should be a lot more room. What d'you say? � if we get a chance, you and me'll slip off and set up somewhere on our own with a few trusty lads, somewhere where there's good loot nice and handy, and no big bosses.'</p>
<p><q>'Ah! ' said <name type="ORG">Shagrat</name>. `Like old times.'</q></p>
<p>`Yes,<q>' said <name type="GPE">Gorbag</name>. 'But <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t count on it. I'm not easy in my mind. As I said, the Big Bosses, ay,'</q> his voice sank almost to a whisper, `ay, even the Biggest, can make mistakes. Something nearly slipped you say. I say, something _has_ slipped. And we've got to look out. Always the poor Uruks to put slips <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght, and small thanks. But <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t forget: the enemies <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t love us any more than they love Him, and if they get topsides on Him, we're <name type="PERSON">don</name>e too. But see here: when were you ordered out? '</p>
<p>`<name type="TIME">About <name type="TIME">an <name type="TIME">hour</name></name></name> ago, just before you saw us. A message came: _Nazg�l uneasy. Spies feared on Stairs. Double vigilance. Patrol to head of Stairs_. I came at once.'</p>
<p><q>'Bad business,'</q> said <name type="GPE">Gorbag</name>. `See here � our Silent <name type="PERSON">Watcher</name>s were uneasy <name type="CARDINAL">more than <name type="CARDINAL">two</name></name> <name type="DATE">day</name>s ago. that I know. But my patrol wasn't ordered out for <name type="DATE">another <name type="DATE">day</name></name>, nor any message sent to <name type="GPE">Lugb</name>�rz either: owing to <name type="ORG">the Great Signal</name> going up, and <name type="PRODUCT">the High Nazg�l</name> going off to the war, and all that. And then they couldn't get <name type="GPE">Lugb</name>�rz to pay at<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>tion for a good while, I'm told.'</p>
<p>`The <name type="PRODUCT">Eye</name> was busy elsewhere, I suppose,<q>' said <name type="ORG">Shagrat</name>. `Big things going on away west, they say.'</q></p>
<p><q>'I daresay,'</q> growled <name type="GPE">Gorbag</name>. `But in the meantime enemies have got up the Stairs. And what were you <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name>? You're supposed to keep watch, aren't you, special orders or no? What are you for?'</p>
<p>`That's enough! <name type="PERSON">Don</name>'t try and teach me my job. We were awake all <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght. We knew there were funny things going on.'</p>
<p>`Very funny! '</p>
<p>`Yes, very funny: lights and shouting and all. But <name type="FAC">Shelob</name> was on the go. My lads saw her and her Sneak.'</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`He</name>r Sneak? What's that? '</p>
<p>`You must have seen him: little thin black fellow; like a spider himself, or perhaps more like a starved frog. He's been here before. Came _out_ of <name type="GPE">Lugb</name>�rz the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> time, <name type="DATE">year</name>s ago, and we had word from High Up to let him pass. He's been up the Stairs once or twice since then, but we've left him al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>: seems to have some understanding with Her <name type="PERSON">Lady</name>ship. I suppose he's no good to eat: she wouldn't worry about words from High Up. But a fine guard you keep in the valley: he was up here <name type="DATE">a <name type="DATE">day</name></name> before all this racket. <name type="TIME">Early <name type="TIME">last <name type="TIME">night</name></name></name> we saw him. Anyway my lads reported that Her <name type="PERSON">Lady</name>ship was having some fun, and that seemed good enough for me, until the message came. I thought her Sneak had brought her a toy. or that you'd perhaps sent her a present, a p<name type="GPE">ri</name>s<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>r of war or something. I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t interfere when she's playing. Nothing gets by <name type="FAC">Shelob</name> when she's on the hunt.'</p>
<p>'Nothing, say you! Didn't you use your eyes back there? I tell you I'm not easy in my mind. Whatever came up the Stairs, _did_ get by. It cut her web and got clean out of the hole. That's something to think about! '</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`A</name>h well, but she got him in the end, didn't she? '</p>
<p>`_Got_ him? Got _who_? This little fellow? But if he was the only <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> then she'd have had him off to her larder long before, and there he'd be now. And if <name type="GPE">Lugb</name>�rz <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ted him, _you'd_ have to go and get him. <name type="GPE">Nice</name> for you. But there was <name type="CARDINAL">more than <name type="CARDINAL">one</name></name>.'</p>
<p>At this point <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> began to lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> more at<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>tively and pressed his ear against the st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>.</p>
<p>'Who cut the cords she'd put round him, <name type="ORG">Shagrat</name>? <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>e <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> as cut the web. Didn't you see that? And who stuck a pin into Her <name type="PERSON">Lady</name>ship? <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>e <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, I reckon. And where is he? Where is he, <name type="ORG">Shagrat</name>? '</p>
<p><name type="ORG">Shagrat</name> made no reply.</p>
<p>`You may well put your thinking cap on, if you've got <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. It's no laughing matter. No <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, no <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> has ever stuck a pin in <name type="FAC">Shelob</name> before, as you should know well enough. There's no g<name type="GPE">ri</name>ef in that; but think-there's some<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> loose hereabouts as is more dangerous than any other damned rebel that ever walked since the bad old times, since <name type="EVENT">the Great Siege</name>. Something _has_ slipped.'</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`A</name>nd what is it then? ' growled <name type="ORG">Shagrat</name>.</p>
<p>`By all the signs, Captain <name type="ORG">Shagrat</name>, I'd say there's a large war<name type="GPE">ri</name>or loose, <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name> most likely, with an elf-sword anyway, and an axe as well maybe: and he's loose in your bounds, too, and you've never spotted him. Very funny indeed! ' <name type="GPE">Gorbag</name> spat. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> smiled g<name type="GPE">ri</name>mly at this desc<name type="GPE">ri</name>ption of himself.</p>
<p><q>'Ah well, you always did take a gloomy view.'</q> said <name type="ORG">Shagrat</name>. <q>'You can read the signs how you like, but there may be other ways to explain them. Anyhow. I've got watchers at every point, and I'm going to deal with <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> thing at a time. When I've had a look at the fellow we _have_ caught, then I'll begin to worry about something else.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`I</name>t's my guess you won't find much in that little fellow,<q>' said <name type="GPE">Gorbag</name>. 'He may have had nothing to do with the real mischief. The big fellow with the sharp sword doesn't seem to have thought him worth much anyhow � just left him lying: regular elvish t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ck.'</q></p>
<p>`We'll see. Come on now! We've talked enough. Let's go and have a look at the p<name type="GPE">ri</name>s<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>r!</p>
<p>`What are you going to do with him? <name type="PERSON">Don</name>'t forget I spotted him <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>. If there's any game, me and my lads must be in it.'</p>
<p><q>'Now, now,'</q> growled <name type="ORG">Shagrat</name>. <q>'I have my orders. And it's more than my belly's worth, or yours, to break 'em. _Any_ trespasser found by the guard is to be held at the tower. P<name type="GPE">ri</name>s<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>r is to be st<name type="GPE">ri</name>pped. Full desc<name type="GPE">ri</name>ption of every article, garment, weapon, letter, <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng. or t<name type="GPE">ri</name>nket is to be sent to <name type="GPE">Lugb</name>�rz at once, and to <name type="GPE">Lugb</name>�rz _only_. And the p<name type="GPE">ri</name>s<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>r is to be kept safe and intact, under pain of death for every member of the guard, until He sends or comes Himself. That's plain enough, and that's what I'm going to do.'</q></p>
<p>'St<name type="GPE">ri</name>pped, eh? ' said <name type="GPE">Gorbag</name>. 'What, teeth, nails, <name type="PERSON">hai</name>r, and all? '</p>
<p>`No, n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of that. He's for <name type="GPE">Lugb</name>�rz, I tell you. He's <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ted safe and whole.'</p>
<p><q>'You'll find that difficult,'</q> laughed <name type="GPE">Gorbag</name>. <q>'He's nothing but car<name type="GPE">ri</name>on now. What <name type="GPE">Lugb</name>�rz will do with such stuff I can't guess. He might as well go in the pot.'</q></p>
<p><q>'You fool,'</q> snarled <name type="ORG">Shagrat</name>. 'You've been talking very clever, but there's a lot you <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t know, though most other folk do. You'll be for the pot or for <name type="FAC">Shelob</name>, if you <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t take care. Car<name type="GPE">ri</name>on! Is that all you know of Her <name type="PERSON">Lady</name>ship? When she binds with cords, she's after meat. She doesn't eat dead meat, nor suck cold blood. This fellow isn't dead! '</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> reeled, clut<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g at the st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. He felt as if the whole dark world was turning upside down. So great was the shock that he almost swo<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>d, but even as he fought to keep a hold on his senses, deep inside him he was aware of the comment: 'You fool, he isn't dead, and your heart knew it. <name type="PERSON">Don</name>'t trust your head, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>wise, it is not the best part of you. The trouble with you is that you never really had any hope. Now what is to be <name type="PERSON">don</name>e? ' Fur the moment nothing, but to prop himself against the unmoving st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> and lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>, lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> to the vile orc-voices.</p>
<p>`<name type="PERSON">Garn</name>!<q>' said <name type="ORG">Shagrat</name>. 'She's got <name type="CARDINAL">more than <name type="CARDINAL">one</name></name> poison. When she's hunting, she just gives 'em a dab in the neck and they go as limp as b<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>d fish, and then she has her way with them. D'you remember old <name type="PERSON">Ufthak</name>? We lost him for <name type="DATE">day</name>s. Then we found him in a corner; hanging up he was, but he was wide awake and gla<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w we laughed! She'd forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> him, maybe, but we didn't touch him-no good interfe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng with Her. <name type="PERSON">Nar �</name> this little filth, he'll wake up, in <name type="TIME">a few <name type="TIME">hour</name>s</name>; and beyond feeling a bit sick for a hit, he'll be all <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght. Or would be, if <name type="GPE">Lugb</name>�rz would let him al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. And of course, beyond wonde<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng where he is and what's happened to him.'</q></p>
<p><q>'And what's going to happen to him,'</q> laughed <name type="GPE">Gorbag</name>. <q>'We can tell him a few sto<name type="GPE">ri</name>es at any rate, if we can't do anything else. I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t suppose he's ever been in lovely <name type="GPE">Lugb</name>�rz, so he may like to know what to expect. This is going to be more funny than I thought. Let's go!'</q></p>
<p>`There's going to be no fun, I tell you,<q>' said <name type="ORG">Shagrat</name>. 'And he's got to be kept safe, or we're all as good as dead.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`A</name>ll <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght! But if I were you, I'd catch the big <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> that's loose, before you send in any report to <name type="GPE">Lugb</name>�rz. It won't sound too pretty to say you've caught the kit<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> and let the cat escape.'</p>
<p>The voices began to move away. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> heard the sound of feet receding. He was recove<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng from his shock, and now a wild fury was on him. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> got it all wrong! ' he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> knew I would. Now they've got him, the devils! the filth! Never leave your master, never, never: that was my <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght rule. And I knew it in my heart. <name type="DATE">May</name> I be forgiven! Now I've got to get back to him. Somehow, somehow! '</p>
<p>He drew his sword again and beat on the st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> with the hilt, but it only gave out a dull sound. The sword, however, blazed so b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ghtly now that he could see dimly in its light. To his surp<name type="GPE">ri</name>se he noticed that the great block was shaped like a heavy door, and was less than twice his own h<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name>. Above it was a dark blank space between the top and the low arch of the opening. It was probably only meant to be a stop against the intrusion of <name type="FAC">Shelob</name>, fas<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed on the inside with some latch or bolt beyond the reach of her cunning. With his remaining strength <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> leaped and caught the top, scrambled up, and dropped; and then he ran madly, sword blazing in hand, round a bend and up a winding tunnel.</p>
<p>The news that his master was still alive roused him to a last effort beyond thought of wea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ness. He could not see anything ahead. for this new passage twisted and turned constantly; but he thought he was cat<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g the <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s up: their voices were growing nearer again. Now they seemed quite close.</p>
<p>`That's what I'm going to do,<q>' said <name type="ORG">Shagrat</name> in angry t<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s. 'Put him <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght up in the top chamber.'</q></p>
<p>`What for? ' growled <name type="GPE">Gorbag</name>. `<name type="GPE">Haven</name>'t you any lock-ups down below? '</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`He</name>'s going out of harm's way, I tell you,<q>' answered <name type="ORG">Shagrat</name>. 'See? He's precious. I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t trust all my lads, and n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of yours; nor you neither, when you're mad for fun. He's going where I <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t him, and where you won't come, if you <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t keep civil. Up to the top, I say. He'll be safe there.'</q></p>
<p><name type="PERSON">`Will</name> he?<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. 'You're forgetting the great big elvish war<name type="GPE">ri</name>or that's loose!'</q> And with that he raced round the last corner, only to find that by some t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ck of the tunnel, or of the hea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng which the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> gave him, he had misjudged the distance.</p>
<p>The <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> orc-figures were still some way ahead. He could see them now, black and squat against a red glare. The passage ran straight at last, up an incline; and at the end, wide open, were great double doors, leading probably to deep chambers far below the high horn of the tower. Already the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s with their burden had passed inside. <name type="GPE">Gorbag</name> and <name type="ORG">Shagrat</name> were drawing near the gate.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> heard a burst of hoarse singing, bla<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng of horns and banging of gongs, a hideous clamour. <name type="GPE">Gorbag</name> and <name type="ORG">Shagrat</name> were already on the threshold.</p>
<p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> yelled and brandished <name type="PERSON">Sting</name>, but his little voice was drowned in the tumult. No <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> heeded him.</p>
<p>The great doors slammed to. Boom. The bars of iron fell into place inside. Clang. The gate was shut. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> hurled himself against the bolted brazen plates and fell senseless to the ground. He was out in the darkness. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> was alive but taken by the Enemy.</p>
<p>_Here ends the <name type="ORG">sec</name>ond part of the history of <name type="EVENT">the War of the</name> <name type="ORG">Ring</name>._</p>
<p>_The <name type="ORDINAL">third</name> part tells of the last de<name type="PERSON">fen</name>ce against the <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>, and the end of the mission of the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>-bearer in_ THE RETURN OF THE KING.</p>
