        <heading>FOREWORD</heading>
        <p>This tale grew in the telling, until it became a history of the Great War of the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> and
            included many glimpses of the yet more ancient history that preceded it. It was begun
            soon after _The <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbit_ was w<name type="GPE">ri</name>t<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> and before its publication in 1937; but I did not go
            on with this sequel, for I wished <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> to complete and set in order the mythology and
            legends of the <name type="DATE">Elder Days</name>, which had then been taking shape for <name type="DATE">some <name type="DATE">year</name>s</name>. I desired to
            do this for my own satisfaction, and I had little hope that other people would be
            interested in this work, especially since it was p<name type="GPE">ri</name><name type="PERSON">mar</name>ily linguistic in inspiration and
            was begun in order to provide the necessary background of 'history' for <name type="PERSON">Elvish</name>
            tongues.</p>
        <p>When those whose advice and opinion I sought corrected _little hope_ to _no hope,_ I went
            back to the sequel, encouraged by requests from readers for more information concerning
            hobbits and their adventures. But the story was drawn irresistibly towards the older
            world, and became an account, as it were, of its end and passing away before its
            beginning and middle had been told. The process had begun in the w<name type="GPE">ri</name>ting of _The
            <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbit,_ in which there were already some references to the older matter: <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name>,
            <name type="PERSON">Gon<name type="PERSON">dol</name>in</name>, the High-elves, and the orcs, as well as glimpses that had a<name type="GPE">ri</name>sen unbidden of
            things higher or deeper or darker than its surface: Du<name type="GPE">ri</name>n, <name type="GPE">Mo<name type="GPE">ri</name>a</name>, <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, the
            <name type="ORG">Necromancer</name>, the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>. The discovery of the significance of these glimpses and of their
            relation to the ancient histo<name type="GPE">ri</name>es revealed the <name type="ORDINAL">Third</name> Age and its culmination in the War
            of the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>.</p>
        <p>Those who had asked for more information about hobbits eventually got it, but they had to
            wait a long time; for the composition of _The <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd of the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>s_ went on at intervals
            du<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng <name type="DATE">the <name type="DATE">year</name></name>s 1936 to 19<name type="CARDINAL">4</name>9, a pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>od in which I had many duties that I did not
            neglect, and many other interests as a learner and teacher that of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> absorbed me. The
            delay was, of course, also increased by the outbreak of war in 1939, by the end of which
            <name type="DATE">year</name> the tale had not yet reached the end of Book <name type="CARDINAL">One</name>. In spite of the darkness of the
            next <name type="CARDINAL">five</name> <name type="DATE">year</name>s I found that the story could not now be wholly aban<name type="PERSON">don</name>ed, and I plodded
            on, mostly by <name type="TIME">night</name>, till I stood by <name type="PERSON">Balin</name>'s <name type="PERSON">tom</name>b in <name type="GPE">Mo<name type="GPE">ri</name>a</name>. There I halted for a long
            while. It was almost <name type="DATE">a <name type="DATE">year</name></name> later when I went on and so came to <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>thl�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en and the Great
            <name type="LOC">River</name> late in 19<name type="CARDINAL">4</name>1. In <name type="DATE">the next <name type="DATE">year</name></name> I wrote the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> drafts of the matter that now
            stands as Book <name type="PERSON">Thr</name>ee, and the beginnings of chapters I and III of Book <name type="CARDINAL">Five</name>; and there
            as the beacons flared in <name type="PERSON">An�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en</name> and Th�oden came to <name type="ORG">Harrow<name type="GPE">dale</name></name> I stopped. Foresight had
            failed and there was no time for thought.</p>
        <p>It was du<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng 19<name type="CARDINAL">4</name><name type="CARDINAL">4</name> that, leaving the loose ends and perplexities of a war which it was my
            task to conduct, or at least to report, 1 forced myself to tackle the journey of <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>
            to <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>. These chapters, eventually to become Book <name type="CARDINAL">Four</name>, were w<name type="GPE">ri</name>t<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> and sent out as
            a se<name type="GPE">ri</name>al to my son, Ch<name type="GPE">ri</name>stopher, then in <name type="LOC">South</name> Af<name type="GPE">ri</name>ca with the RAF. N<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>theless it took
            another <name type="CARDINAL">five</name> <name type="DATE">year</name>s before the tale was brought to its present end; in that time I
            changed my house, my c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>r, and my college, and the <name type="DATE">day</name>s though less dark were no less
            labo<name type="GPE">ri</name>ous. Then when the 'end' had at last been reached the whole story had to be
            revised, and indeed largely re-w<name type="GPE">ri</name>t<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> backwards. And it had to be typed, and re-typed:
            by me; the cost of professional typing by the <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>-fingered was beyond my means.</p>
        <p>_The <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd of the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>s_ has been read by many people since it finally appeared in p<name type="GPE">ri</name>nt;
            and I should like to say something here with reference to the many opinions or guesses
            that I have received or have read concerning the motives and meaning of the tale. The
            p<name type="GPE">ri</name>me motive was the desire of a tale-teller to try his hand at a really long story that
            would hold the at<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>tion of readers, amuse them, delight them, and at times maybe excite
            them or deeply move them. As a guide I had only my own feelings for what is appealing or
            moving, and for many the guide was inevitably of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> at fault. Some who have read the
            book, or at any rate have reviewed it, have found it bo<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng, absurd, or contemptible;
            and I have no cause to complain, since I have similar opinions of their works, or of the
            kinds of w<name type="GPE">ri</name>ting that they evidently prefer. But even from the points of view of many
            who have enjoyed my story there is much that fails to please. It is perhaps not possible
            in a long tale to please everybody at all points, nor to displease everybody at the same
            points; for I find from the letters that I have received that the passages or chapters
            that are to some a blemish are all by others specially approved. The most c<name type="GPE">ri</name>tical
            reader of all, myself, now finds many defects, minor and major, but being fortunately
            under no obligation either to review the book or to w<name type="GPE">ri</name>te it again, he will pass over
            these in silence, except <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> that has been noted by others: the book is too short.</p>
        <p>As for any inner meaning or 'message', it has in the in<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>tion of the author n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. It is
            neither allego<name type="GPE">ri</name>cal nor topical. As the story grew it put down roots (into the past) and
            threw out unexpected branches: but its main theme was settled from the outset by the
            inevitable choice of the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> as the link between it and _The <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbit._ The crucial
            chapter, "The <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name> of the Past', is <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the oldest parts of the tale. It was
            w<name type="GPE">ri</name>t<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> long before the foreshadow of 1939 had yet become a threat of inevitable
            disaster, and from that point the story would have developed along essentially the same
            lines, if that disaster had been averted. Its sources are things long before in mind, or
            in some cases already w<name type="GPE">ri</name>t<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>, and little or nothing in it was modified by the war that
            began in 1939 or its sequels.</p>
        <p>The real war does not resemble the legendary war in its process or its conclusion. If it
            had inspired or directed the development of the legend, then certainly the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> would
            have been seized and used against <name type="ORG">Sauron</name>; he would not have been annihilated but
            enslaved, and <name type="FAC">Barad-d</name>�r would not have been destroyed but occupied. <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>, failing to
            get possession of the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>, would m the confusion and treache<name type="GPE">ri</name>es of the time have found
            in <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> the missing links in his own researches into <name type="ORG">Ring</name>-lore, and before long he
            would have made a Great <name type="ORG">Ring</name> of his own with which to challenge the self-styled Ruler of
            <name type="LOC">Middle-<name type="LOC">earth</name></name>. In that conflict both sides would have held hobbits in hatred and
            contempt: they would not long have survived even as slaves.</p>
        <p>Other arrangements could be devised according to the tastes or views of those who like
            allegory or topical reference. But I cordially dislike allegory in all its
            manifestations, and always have <name type="PERSON">don</name>e so since I grew old and wary enough to detect its
            presence. I much prefer history, true or feigned, with its va<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed applicability to the
            thought and expe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ence of readers. I think that many confuse 'applicability' with
            'allegory'; but the <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> resides in the freedom of the reader, and the other in the
            purposed domination of the author.</p>
        <p>An author cannot of course remain wholly unaffected by his expe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ence, but the ways in
            which a story-germ uses the soil of expe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ence are extremely complex, and attempts to
            define the process are at best guesses from evidence that is inadequate and ambiguous.
            It is also false, though naturally attractive, when the lives of an author and c<name type="GPE">ri</name>tic
            have overlapped, to suppose that the movements of thought or the events of times common
            to both were necessa<name type="GPE">ri</name>ly the most powerful influences. <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> has indeed personally to come
            under the shadow of war to feel fully its oppression; but as <name type="DATE">the <name type="DATE">year</name></name>s go by it seems
            now of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> that to be caught in youth by 191<name type="CARDINAL">4</name> was no less hideous an expe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ence
            than to be involved in 1939 and the following <name type="DATE">year</name>s. By 1918 all but <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of my close
            f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends were dead. Or to take a less g<name type="GPE">ri</name>evous matter: it has been supposed by some that
            'The Scou<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng of the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>' reflects the situation in England at the time when I was
            finishing my tale. It does not. It is an essential part of the plot, foreseen from the
            outset, though in the event modified by the character of <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> as developed in the
            story without, need I say, any allego<name type="GPE">ri</name>cal significance or contemporary political
            reference whatsoever. It has indeed some basis in expe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ence, though slender (for the
            economic situation was entirely different), and much further back. The country in which
            I lived in childhood was being shabbily destroyed before I was <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>, in <name type="DATE">day</name>s when
            motor-cars were rare objects (I had never seen <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>) and men were still building suburban
            railways. Recently I saw in a paper a picture of the last decrepitude of the once
            th<name type="GPE">ri</name>ving corn-mill beside its pool that <name type="DATE">long ago</name> seemed to me so imp<name type="GPE">ortan</name>t. I never
            liked the looks of the Young <name type="ORG">miller</name>, but his father, the Old <name type="ORG">miller</name>, had a black beard,
            and he was not named <name type="PERSON">Sandyman</name>.</p>
        <p>_The <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd of the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>s_ is now issued in a new edition, and the opportunity has been
            taken of revising it. A number of errors and inconsis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>cies that still remained in the
            text have been corrected, and an attempt has been made to provide information on a few
            points which at<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>tive readers have raised. I have considered all their comments and
            enqui<name type="GPE">ri</name>es, and if some seem to have been passed over that may be because I have failed
            to keep my notes in order; but many enqui<name type="GPE">ri</name>es could only be answered by additional
            appendices, or indeed by the production of an accessory volume containing much of the
            mate<name type="GPE">ri</name>al that I did not include in the o<name type="GPE">ri</name>ginal edition, in particular more detailed
            linguistic information. In the meantime this edition offers this Foreword, an addition
            to the Prologue, some notes, and an index of the names of persons and places. This index
            is in in<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>tion complete in items but not in references, since for the present purpose
            it has been necessary to reduce its bulk. A complete index, making full use of the
            mate<name type="GPE">ri</name>al prepared for me by Mrs. N. Smith, belongs rather to the accessory volume.</p>
        <heading>PROLOGUE</heading>
        <p>This book is largely concerned with <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbits, and from its pages a reader may discover
            much of their character and a little of their history. Further information will also be
            found in the selection from the Red Book of <name type="LOC">West</name><name type="PERSON">mar</name>ch that has already been published,
            under the title of _The <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbit_. That story was de<name type="GPE">ri</name>ved from the earlier chapters of the
            Red Book, composed by <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> himself, the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbit to become famous in the world at
            large, and called by him _There and Back Again,_ since they told of his journey into the
            <name type="LOC">East</name> and his return: an adventure which later involved all the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbits in the great
            events of that Age that are here related.</p>
        <p>Many, however, may wish to know more about this re<name type="PERSON">mar</name>kable people from the outset, while
            some may not possess the earlier book. For such readers a few notes on the more
            imp<name type="GPE">ortan</name>t points are here collected from <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbit-lore, and the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> adventure is b<name type="GPE">ri</name>efly
            recalled.</p>
        <p><name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbits are an unobtrusive but very ancient people, more numerous formerly than they are
            to<name type="DATE">day</name>; for they love peace and quiet and good tilled <name type="LOC">earth</name>: a well-ordered and
            well-farmed countryside was their favou<name type="GPE">ri</name>te haunt. They do not and did not understand or
            like ma<name type="PERSON">chin</name>es more complicated than a forge-bellows, a water-mill, or a hand-loom,
            though they were skilful with tools. Even in <name type="DATE">ancient <name type="DATE">day</name>s</name> they were, as a rule, shy of
            'the Big Folk', as they call us, and now they avoid us with dismay and are becoming hard
            to find. They are quick of hea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng and sharp-eyed, and though they are inclined to be
            fat and do not hurry unnecessa<name type="GPE">ri</name>ly, they are n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>theless nimble and deft in their
            movements. They possessed from the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> the art of disappea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng swiftly and silently,
            when large folk whom they do not wish to meet come blunde<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng by; and this an they have
            developed until to <name type="ORG">Men</name> it may seem magical. But <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbits have never, in fact, studied
            magic of any kind, and their elusiveness is due solely to a professional skill that
            heredity and practice, and a close f<name type="GPE">ri</name>endship with the <name type="LOC">earth</name>, have rendered inimitable
            by bigger and clumsier races.</p>
        <p>For they are a little people, smaller than <name type="ORG">Dwarves</name>: less tout and stocky, that is, even
            when they are not actually much shorter. Their h<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name> is va<name type="GPE">ri</name>able, ranging <name type="CARDINAL">between <name type="CARDINAL">two</name></name>
            and <name type="CARDINAL">four</name> feet of our measure. They seldom now reach <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> feet; but they hive dwindled,
            they say, and in <name type="DATE">ancient <name type="DATE">day</name>s</name> they were taller. According to the Red Book, Bandobras
            <name type="PERSON">Took</name> (<name type="PERSON">Bullroarer</name>), son of <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>g<name type="GPE">ri</name>m the <name type="ORDINAL">Second</name>, was <name type="CARDINAL">four</name> foot <name type="CARDINAL">five</name> and able to <name type="GPE">ri</name>de a
            horse. He was surpassed in all <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbit records only by <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> famous characters of old; but
            that cu<name type="GPE">ri</name>ous matter is dealt with in this book.</p>
        <p>As for the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbits of the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>, with whom these tales are concerned, in the <name type="DATE">day</name>s of
            their peace and prospe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ty they were a merry folk. They dressed in b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght colours, being
            notably fond of yellow and green; but they seldom wore shoes, since their feet had tough
            leathery soles and were clad in a thick curling <name type="PERSON">hai</name>r, much like the <name type="PERSON">hai</name>r of their heads,
            which was commonly brown. Thus, the only craft little practised among them was
            shoe-making; but they had long and skilful fingers and could make many other useful and
            comely things. Their faces were as a rule good-natured rather than beautiful, broad,
            b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght-eyed, red-cheeked, with mouths apt to laughter, and to eating and d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nking. And
            laugh they did, and eat, and d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk, of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> and heartily, being fond of simple jests at
            all times, and of <name type="CARDINAL">six</name> meals <name type="DATE">a <name type="DATE">day</name></name> (when they could get them). They were hospitable and
            delighted in parties, and in presents, which they gave away freely and eagerly
            accepted.</p>
        <p>It is plain indeed that in spite of later estrangement <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbits are relatives of ours: far
            nearer to us than <name type="ORG">Elves</name>, or even than <name type="ORG">Dwarves</name>. Of old they spoke the languages of <name type="ORG">Men</name>,
            after their own fashion, and liked and disliked much the same things as <name type="ORG">Men</name> did. But
            what exactly our relationship is can no longer be discovered. The beginning of <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbits
            lies far back in the <name type="DATE">Elder Days</name> that are now lost and forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>. Only the <name type="ORG">Elves</name> still
            preserve any records of that vanished time, and their traditions are concerned almost
            entirely with their own history, in which <name type="ORG">Men</name> appear seldom and <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbits are not
            menti<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>d at all. Yet it is clear that <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbits had, in fact, lived quietly in
            <name type="LOC">Middle-<name type="LOC">earth</name></name> for many <name type="DATE">long <name type="DATE">year</name>s</name> before other folk became even aware of them. And the
            world being after all full of strange creatures beyond count, these little people seemed
            of very little imp<name type="GPE">ortan</name>ce. But in the <name type="DATE">day</name>s of <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>, and of <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> his heir, they
            suddenly became, by no wish of their own, both imp<name type="GPE">ortan</name>t and renowned, and troubled the
            counsels of the <name type="PERSON">Wise</name> and the Great.</p>
        <p>Those <name type="DATE">day</name>s, the <name type="ORDINAL">Third</name> Age of <name type="LOC">Middle-<name type="LOC">earth</name></name>, are now long past, and the shape of all lands
            has been changed; but the regions in which <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbits then lived were doubtless the same as
            those in which they still linger: the <name type="LOC">North</name>-<name type="LOC">West</name> of the Old World, east of the <name type="LOC">Sea</name>. Of
            their o<name type="GPE">ri</name>ginal home the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbits in <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>'s time preserved no knowledge. A love of
            learning (other than genealogical lore) was far from general among them, but there
            remained still a few in the older families who studied their own books, and even
            gathered reports of old times and distant lands from <name type="ORG">Elves</name>, <name type="ORG">Dwarves</name>, and <name type="ORG">Men</name>. Their own
            records began only after the settlement of the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>, and their most ancient legends
            hardly looked further back than their Wande<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng Days. It is clear, n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>theless, from
            these legends, and from the evidence of their peculiar words and cus<name type="PERSON">tom</name>s, that like many
            other folk <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbits had in the distant past moved westward. Their earliest tales seem to
            glimpse a time when they dwelt in the upper <name type="GPE">vale</name>s of <name type="GPE">Anduin</name>, between the eaves of
            Greenwood the Great and the <name type="LOC">Misty <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s</name>. Why they later undertook the hard and
            pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>lous crossing of the mountains into <name type="ORG">E<name type="GPE">ri</name>ador</name> is no longer certain. Their own accounts
            speak of the multiplying of <name type="ORG">Men</name> in the land, and of a shadow that fell on the forest, so
            that it became darkened and its new name was <name type="GPE">Mirkwood</name>.</p>
        <p>Before the crossing of the mountains the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbits had already become divided into <name type="CARDINAL">three</name>
            somewhat different breeds: Harfoots, <name type="ORG">Stoors</name>, and Fallohides. The Harfoots were browner
            of skin, smaller, and shorter, and they were beardless and bootless; their hands and
            feet were neat and nimble; and they preferred highlands and hillsides. The <name type="ORG">Stoors</name> were
            broader, heavier in build; their feet and hands were larger, and they preferred flat
            lands and <name type="GPE">ri</name>versides. The Fallohides were fairer of skin and also of <name type="PERSON">hai</name>r, and they were
            taller and slimmer than the others; they were lovers of trees and of woodlands.</p>
        <p>The Harfoots had much to do with <name type="ORG">Dwarves</name> in ancient times, and long lived in the
            foothills of the mountains. They moved westward early, and roamed over <name type="ORG">E<name type="GPE">ri</name>ador</name> as far as
            <name type="ORG">Weathertop</name> while the others were still in the <name type="PERSON">Wilderland</name>. They were the most normal and
            representative va<name type="GPE">ri</name>ety of <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbit, and far the most numerous. They were the most inclined
            to settle in <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> place, and longest preserved their ancestral habit of living in tunnels
            and holes.</p>
        <p>The <name type="ORG">Stoors</name> lingered long by the banks of the <name type="LOC">Great <name type="LOC">River</name></name> <name type="GPE">Anduin</name>, and were less shy of
            <name type="ORG">Men</name>. They came west after the Harfoots and followed the course of the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>udwater
            southwards; and there many of them long dwelt between <name type="ORG">Tharbad</name> and the borders of <name type="GPE">Dunland</name>
            before they moved north again.</p>
        <p>The Fallohides, the least numerous, were a northerly branch. They were more f<name type="GPE">ri</name>endly with
            <name type="ORG">Elves</name> than the other <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbits were, and had more skill in language and song than in
            handicrafts; and of old they preferred hunting to tilling. They crossed the mountains
            north of <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name> and came down the <name type="LOC">River</name> <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>arwell. In <name type="ORG">E<name type="GPE">ri</name>ador</name> they soon mingled with
            the other kinds that had preceded them, but being somewhat bolder and more adventurous,
            they were of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> found as leaders or chieftains among clans of Harfoots or <name type="ORG">Stoors</name>. Even
            in <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>'s time the strong Fallohidish strain could still be noted among the greater
            families, such as the <name type="PERSON">Took</name>s and the Masters of <name type="PERSON">Buckland</name>.</p>
        <p>In the westlands of <name type="ORG">E<name type="GPE">ri</name>ador</name>, between the <name type="LOC">Misty <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s</name> and the <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s of <name type="ORG">Lune</name>, the
            <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbits found both <name type="ORG">Men</name> and <name type="ORG">Elves</name>. Indeed, a remnant still dwelt there of the D�nedain,
            the kings of <name type="ORG">Men</name> that came over the <name type="LOC">Sea</name> out of <name type="LOC">West</name>ernesse; but they were dwindling fast
            and the lands of their <name type="LOC">North</name> <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>gdom were falling far and wide into waste. There was
            room and to spare for incomers, and ere long the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbits began to settle in ordered
            communities. Most of their earlier settlements had long disappeared and been forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>
            in <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>'s time; but <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> to become imp<name type="GPE">ortan</name>t still endured, though reduced
            in size; this was at <name type="PERSON">Bree</name> and in the <name type="PERSON">Che<name type="CARDINAL">two</name>od</name> that lay round about, some <name type="CARDINAL">forty</name> miles
            east of the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>.</p>
        <p>It was in these early <name type="DATE">day</name>s, doubtless, that the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbits learned their letters and began
            to w<name type="GPE">ri</name>te after the manner of the D�nedain, who had in their turn long before learned the
            art from the <name type="ORG">Elves</name>. And in those <name type="DATE">day</name>s also they forgot whatever languages they had used
            before, and spoke ever after the Common <name type="ORG">Speech</name>, the <name type="LOC">West</name>ron as it was named, that was
            current through all the lands of the kings from <name type="PERSON">Arnor</name> to <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>, and about all the
            coasts of the <name type="LOC">Sea</name> from <name type="PERSON">Belfalas</name> to <name type="ORG">Lune</name>. Yet they kept a few words of their own, as well
            as their own names of <name type="DATE">months</name> and <name type="DATE">day</name>s, and a great store of personal names out of the
            past.</p>
        <p>About this time legend among the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbits <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> becomes history with a reckoning of <name type="DATE">year</name>s.
            For it was in the <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> thousand <name type="CARDINAL">six</name> <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name> and <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> <name type="DATE">year</name> of the <name type="ORDINAL">Third</name> Age that the
            Fallohide brothers, <name type="DATE">March</name>o and Blanco, set out from <name type="PERSON">Bree</name>; and having obtained permission
            from the high king at <name type="GPE">Fornost</name>, they crossed the brown <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver Baranduin with a great
            following of <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbits. They passed over the <name type="FAC">B<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge</name> of <name type="ORG">St<name type="CARDINAL">one</name></name>bows, that had been built in
            the <name type="DATE">day</name>s of the power of the <name type="LOC">North</name> <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>gdom, and they took ail the land beyond to dwell
            in, between the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver and the <name type="LOC">Far</name> <name type="LOC">Downs</name>. All that was demanded of them was that they
            should keep the Great <name type="FAC">B<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge</name> in repair, and all other b<name type="GPE">ri</name>dges and roads, speed the
            king's messengers, and acknowledge his lordship.</p>
        <p>Thus began the _<name type="LOC">Shire</name>-reckoning,_ for <name type="DATE">the <name type="DATE">year</name></name> of the crossing of the <name type="ORG">Brand</name>ywine (as the
            <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbits turned the name) became Year <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> of the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>, and all later dates were reck<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>d
            from it. At once the western <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbits fell in love with their new land, and they remained
            there, and soon passed once more out of the history of <name type="ORG">Men</name> and of <name type="ORG">Elves</name>. While there was
            still a king they were in name his subjects, but they were, in fact, ruled by their own
            chieftains and meddled not at all with events in the world outside. To the last battle
            at <name type="GPE">Fornost</name> with the Witch-lord of Ang<name type="PERSON">mar</name> they sent some bowmen to the aid of the king,
            or so they maintained, though no tales of <name type="ORG">Men</name> record it. But in that war the <name type="LOC">North</name>
            <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>gdom ended; and then the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbits took the land for their own, and they chose from
            their own chiefs a <name type="GPE">T<name type="PERSON">hai</name>n</name> to hold the autho<name type="GPE">ri</name>ty of the king that was g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. There for a
            thousand <name type="DATE">year</name>s they were little troubled by wars, and they prospered and multiplied
            after the Dark Plague (S.R. 37) until the disaster of the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ng <name type="DATE">Winter</name> and the famine
            that followed it. Many <name type="CARDINAL">thousands</name> then pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>shed, but <name type="DATE">the Days</name> of D<name type="LOC">earth</name> (1158-60) were at
            the time of this tale long past and the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbits had again become accus<name type="PERSON">tom</name>ed to plenty.
            The land was <name type="GPE">ri</name>ch and kindly, and though it had long been deserted when they entered it,
            it had before been well tilled, and there the king had once had many farms, cornlands,
            vineyards, and woods.</p>
        <p><name type="CARDINAL">Forty</name> leagues it stretched from the <name type="LOC">Far</name> <name type="LOC">Downs</name> to the <name type="ORG">Brand</name>ywine <name type="FAC">B<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge</name>, and <name type="CARDINAL">fifty</name> from
            the northern moors to the <name type="PERSON">mar</name>shes in the south. The <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbits named it the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>, as the
            region of the autho<name type="GPE">ri</name>ty of their <name type="GPE">T<name type="PERSON">hai</name>n</name>, and a dist<name type="GPE">ri</name>ct of well-ordered business; and
            there in that pleasant comer of the world they plied their well-ordered business of
            living, and they heeded less and less the world outside where dark things moved, until
            they came to think that peace and plenty were the rule in <name type="LOC">Middle-<name type="LOC">earth</name></name> and the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght of
            all sensible folk. They forgot or ignored what little they had ever known of the
            <name type="ORG">Guard</name>ians, and of the labours of those that made possible the long peace of the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>.
            They were, in fact, sheltered, but they had ceased to remember it.</p>
        <p>At no time had <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbits of any kind been warlike, and they had never fought among
            themselves. In olden <name type="DATE">day</name>s they had, of course, been of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> obliged to fight to maintain
            themselves in a hard world; but in <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>'s time that was very ancient history. The last
            battle, before this story opens, and indeed the only <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> that had ever been fought
            within the borders of the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>, was beyond living memory: the <name type="EVENT">Battle</name> of <name type="GPE">Greenfields</name>,
            S.R. <name type="CARDINAL">11<name type="CARDINAL">4</name>7</name>, in which Bandobras <name type="PERSON">Took</name> routed an invasion of <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s. Even the weathers had
            grown milder, and the wolves that had once come <name type="PERSON">raven</name>ing out of the <name type="LOC">North</name> in bitter
            white <name type="DATE">winter</name>s were now only a grandfather's tale. So, though there was still some store
            of weapons in the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>, these were used mostly as trophies, hanging above h<name type="LOC">earth</name>s or on
            walls, or gathered into the museum at <name type="PERSON">Michel Delving</name>. The Mathom-house it was called;
            for anything that <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbits had no immediate use for, but were unwilling to throw away,
            they called a _mathom_. Their dwellings were apt to become rather crowded with mathoms,
            and many of the presents that passed from hand to hand were of that son.</p>
        <p>N<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>theless, ease and peace had left this people still cu<name type="GPE">ri</name>ously tough. They were, if it
            came to it, difficult to daunt or to kill; and they were, perhaps, so unwearyingly fond
            of good things not least because they could, when put to it, do without them, and could
            survive rough handling by g<name type="GPE">ri</name>ef, foe, or weather in a way that astonished those who did
            not know them well and looked no further than their bellies and their well-<name type="ORG">fed</name> faces.
            Though slow to quarrel, and for sport killing nothing that lived, they were doughty at
            bay, and at need could still handle arms. They shot well with the bow, for they were
            keen-eyed and sure at the <name type="PERSON">mar</name>k. Not only with bows and arrows. If any <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbit stooped for
            a st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, it was well to get quickly under cover, as all trespassing beasts knew very
            well.</p>
        <p>All <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbits had o<name type="GPE">ri</name>ginally lived in holes in the ground, or so they believed, and in such
            dwellings they still felt most at home; but in the course of time they had been obliged
            to adopt other forms of abode. Actually in the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> in <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>'s <name type="DATE">day</name>s it was, as a rule,
            only the <name type="GPE">ri</name>chest and the poorest <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbits that maintained the old cus<name type="PERSON">tom</name>. The poorest
            went on living in burrows of the most p<name type="GPE">ri</name>mitive kind, mere holes indeed, with only <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>
            window or n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>; while the well-to-do still constructed more luxu<name type="GPE">ri</name>ous versions of the
            simple diggings of old. But suitable sites for these large and ramifying tunnels (or
            _smials_ as they called them) were not everywhere to be found; and in the flats and the
            low-lying dist<name type="GPE">ri</name>cts the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbits, as they multiplied, began to build above ground.
            Indeed, even in the hilly regions and the older villages, such as <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbiton or
            <name type="GPE">Tuckborough</name>, or in the chief township of the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>, <name type="PERSON">Michel Delving</name> on the White <name type="LOC">Downs</name>,
            there were now many houses of wood, b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ck, or st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. These were specially favoured by
            <name type="ORG">miller</name>s, smiths, ropers, and cartw<name type="GPE">ri</name>ghts, and others of that sort; for even when they
            had holes to live in. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbits had long been accus<name type="PERSON">tom</name>ed to build sheds and workshops.</p>
        <p>The habit of building farmhouses and barns was said to have begun among the inhabitants
            of the <name type="ORG">Ma<name type="GPE">ri</name>sh</name> down by the <name type="ORG">Brand</name>ywine. The <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbits of that quarter, the <name type="LOC">East</name>farthing,
            were rather large and heavy-legged, and they wore dwarf-boots in muddy weather. But they
            were well known to be <name type="ORG">Stoors</name> in a large part of their blood, as indeed was shown by the
            down that many grew on their <name type="PERSON">chin</name>s. No Harfoot or Fallohide had any trace of a beard.
            Indeed, the folk of the <name type="ORG">Ma<name type="GPE">ri</name>sh</name>, and of <name type="PERSON">Buckland</name>, east of the <name type="LOC">River</name>, which they
            afterwards occupied, came for the most part later into the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> up from south-away; and
            they still had many peculiar names and strange words not found elsewhere in the
            <name type="LOC">Shire</name>.</p>
        <p>It is probable that the craft of building, as many other crafts beside, was de<name type="GPE">ri</name>ved from
            the D�nedain. But the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbits may have learned it direct from the <name type="ORG">Elves</name>, the teachers of
            <name type="ORG">Men</name> in their youth. For the <name type="ORG">Elves</name> of the High <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>dred had not yet forsaken <name type="LOC">Middle-<name type="LOC">earth</name></name>,
            and they dwelt still at that time at the <name type="ORG">Grey</name> <name type="GPE">Haven</name>s away to the west, and in other
            places within reach of the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>. <name type="PERSON">Thr</name>ee <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name>-towers of immemo<name type="GPE">ri</name>al age were still to be
            seen on the <name type="FAC">Tower</name> <name type="ORG">Hill</name>s beyond the western <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ches. They sh<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> far off in the moonlight.
            The tallest was furthest away, standing al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> upon a green mound. The <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbits of the
            <name type="LOC">West</name>farthing said that <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> could see the <name type="LOC">Sea</name> from the lop of that tower; but no <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbit
            had ever been known to climb it. Indeed, few <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbits had ever seen or sailed upon the
            <name type="LOC">Sea</name>, and fewer still had ever returned to report it. Most <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbits regarded even <name type="GPE">ri</name>vers
            and small boats with deep misgivings, and not many of them could swim. And as the <name type="DATE">day</name>s
            of the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> lengthened they spoke less and less with the <name type="ORG">Elves</name>, and grew afraid of
            them, and distrustful of those that had dealings with them; and the <name type="LOC">Sea</name> became a word of
            fear among them, and a token of death, and they turned their faces away from the hills
            in the west.</p>
        <p>The craft of building may have come from <name type="ORG">Elves</name> or <name type="ORG">Men</name>, but the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbits used it in their
            own fashion. They did not go in for towers. Their houses were usually long, low, and
            comfortable. The oldest kind were, indeed, no more than built imitations of _smials,_
            thatched with dry grass or straw, or roo<name type="ORG">fed</name> with turves, and having walls somewhat
            bulged. That stage, however, belonged to the early <name type="DATE">day</name>s of the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>, and
            hobbit-building had long since been altered, improved by devices, learned from <name type="ORG">Dwarves</name>,
            or discovered by themselves. A preference for round windows, and even round doors, was
            the chief remaining peculia<name type="GPE">ri</name>ty of hobbit-architecture.</p>
        <p>The houses and the holes of <name type="LOC">Shire</name>-hobbits were of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> large, and inhabited by large
            families. (<name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> and <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> <name type="PERSON">Baggins</name> were as bachelors very exceptional, as they were also
            in many other ways, such as their f<name type="GPE">ri</name>endship with the <name type="ORG">Elves</name>.) Sometimes, as in the case
            of the <name type="PERSON">Took</name>s of Great Smials, or the <name type="ORG">Brand</name>ybucks of <name type="ORG">Brand</name>y <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>l, many generations of
            relatives lived in (comparative) peace together in <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> ancestral and many-tunnelled
            mansion. All <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbits were, in any case, clannish and reck<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>d up their relationships
            with great care. They drew long and elaborate family-trees with innumerable branches. In
            dealing with <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbits it is imp<name type="GPE">ortan</name>t to remember who is related to whom, and in what
            degree. It would be impossible in this book to set out a family-tree that included even
            the more imp<name type="GPE">ortan</name>t members of the more imp<name type="GPE">ortan</name>t families at the time which these tales
            tell of. The genealogical trees at the end of the Red Book of <name type="LOC">West</name><name type="PERSON">mar</name>ch are a small book
            in themselves, and all but <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbits would find them exceedingly dull. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbits delighted
            in such things, if they were accurate: they liked to have books filled with things that
            they already knew, set out fair and square with no contradictions.</p>
        <p>There is another astonishing thing about <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbits of old that must be menti<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>d, an
            astonishing habit: they imbibed or inhaled, through pipes of clay or wood, the smoke of
            the burning leaves of a herb, which they called _pipe-weed_ or _leaf,_ a va<name type="GPE">ri</name>ety
            probably of _Nicotiana._ A great deal of mystery surrounds the o<name type="GPE">ri</name>gin of this peculiar
            cus<name type="PERSON">tom</name>, or 'art' as the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbits preferred to call it. All that could be discovered about
            it in antiquity was put together by <name type="PERSON">Me<name type="GPE">ri</name>adoc</name> <name type="ORG">Brand</name>ybuck (later Master of <name type="PERSON">Buckland</name>), and
            since he and the tobacco of the <name type="LOC">South</name>farthing play a part in the history that follows,
            his re<name type="PERSON">mar</name>ks in the introduction to his _Herblore of the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>_ may be quoted.</p>
        <p><q>'This,'</q> he says, 'is the <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> art that we can certainly claim to be our own
            invention. When <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbits <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> began to smoke is not known, all the legends and family
            histo<name type="GPE">ri</name>es take it for granted; for ages folk in the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> smoked va<name type="GPE">ri</name>ous herbs, some
            fouler, some sweeter. But all accounts agree that Tobold <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>rnblower of <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ngbot<name type="PERSON">tom</name> in the
            <name type="LOC">South</name>farthing <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> grew the true pipe-weed in his gardens in the <name type="DATE">day</name>s of <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>g<name type="GPE">ri</name>m the
            <name type="ORDINAL">Second</name>, about <name type="DATE">the <name type="DATE">year</name></name> 1070 of <name type="LOC">Shire</name>-reckoning. The best home-grown still comes from
            that dist<name type="GPE">ri</name>ct, especially the va<name type="GPE">ri</name>eties now known as <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ngbot<name type="PERSON">tom</name> Leaf, Old <name type="PERSON">Toby</name>, and
            <name type="LOC">South</name>ern Star.</p>
        <p>'<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w Old <name type="PERSON">Toby</name> came by the plant is not recorded, for to his dying <name type="DATE">day</name> he would not tell.
            He knew much about herbs, but he was no traveller. It is said that in his youth he went
            of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> to <name type="PERSON">Bree</name>, though he certainly never went further from the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> than that. It is
            thus quite possible that he learned of this plant in <name type="PERSON">Bree</name>, where now, at any rate, it
            grows well on the south slopes of the hill. The <name type="PERSON">Bree</name>-hobbits claim to have been the
            <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> actual smokers of the pipe-weed. They claim, of course, to have <name type="PERSON">don</name>e everything
            before the people of the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>, whom they refer to as "colonists"; but in this case
            their claim is, I think, likely to be true. And certainly it was from <name type="PERSON">Bree</name> that the art
            of smoking the genuine weed spread in the recent centu<name type="GPE">ri</name>es among <name type="ORG">Dwarves</name> and such other
            folk, <name type="PRODUCT">Ranger</name>s, <name type="ORG">Wizard</name>s, or <name type="PERSON">wan</name>derers, as still passed to and fro through that ancient
            road-meeting. The home and centre of the an is thus to be found in the old inn of <name type="PERSON">Bree</name>,
            _<name type="PERSON">The Prancing Pony</name>,_ that has been kept by the family of <name type="PERSON">Butterbur</name> from time beyond
            record.</p>
        <p>
            <q>'All the same, observations that I have made on my own many journeys south have
                convinced me that the weed itself is not native to our parts of the world, but came
                northward from the lower <name type="GPE">Anduin</name>, whither it was, I suspect, o<name type="GPE">ri</name>ginally brought over
                <name type="LOC">Sea</name> by the <name type="ORG">Men</name> of <name type="LOC">West</name>ernesse. It grows abundantly in <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>, and there is <name type="GPE">ri</name>cher
                and larger than in the <name type="LOC">North</name>, where it is never found wild, and flou<name type="GPE">ri</name>shes only in
                warm sheltered places like <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ngbot<name type="PERSON">tom</name>. The <name type="ORG">Men</name> of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> call it _sweet galenas,_
                and esteem it only for the fragrance of its flowers. From that land it must have

                put it into pipes. Not even the <name type="ORG">Wizard</name>s <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> thought of that before we did. Though
                <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> <name type="ORG">Wizard</name> that I knew took up the art <name type="DATE">long ago</name>, and became as skilful in it as in
                all other things that he put his mind to.'</q>
        </p>
        <p>The <name type="LOC">Shire</name> was divided into <name type="CARDINAL">four</name> quarters, the <name type="LOC">Far</name>things already referred to. <name type="LOC">North</name>,
            <name type="LOC">South</name>, <name type="LOC">East</name>, and <name type="LOC">West</name>; and these again each into a number of folklands, which still bore
            the names of some of the old leading families, although by the time of this history
            these names were no longer found only in their proper folklands. Nearly all <name type="PERSON">Took</name>s still
            lived in the <name type="PERSON">Took</name>land, but that was not true of many other families, such as the
            <name type="PERSON">Baggins</name>es or the <name type="PERSON">Boffin</name>s. Outside the <name type="LOC">Far</name>things were the <name type="LOC">East</name> and <name type="LOC">West</name> <name type="DATE">March</name>es: the
            <name type="PERSON">Buckland</name> (see beginning of Chapter V, Book I); and the <name type="LOC">West</name><name type="PERSON">mar</name>ch added to the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> in
            S.R. 1<name type="CARDINAL">4</name>62.</p>
        <p>The <name type="LOC">Shire</name> at this time had hardly any 'government'. Families for the most part managed
            their own affairs. Growing food and eating it occupied most of their time. In other
            matters they were, as a rule, generous and not greedy, but con<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ted and moderate, so
            that estates, farms, workshops, and small trades <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ded to remain unchanged for
            generations.</p>
        <p>There remained, of course, the ancient tradition concerning the high king at <name type="GPE">Fornost</name>, or
            <name type="GPE">Norbury</name> as they called it, away north of the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>. But there had been no king for
            nearly <name type="CARDINAL">a thousand</name> <name type="DATE">year</name>s, and even the ruins of <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>gs' <name type="GPE">Norbury</name> were covered with grass.
            Yet the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbits still said of wild folk and wicked things (such as trolls) that they had
            not heard of the king. For they att<name type="GPE">ri</name>buted to the king of old all their essential laws;
            and usually they kept the laws of free will, because they were The Rules (as they said),
            both ancient and just.</p>
        <p>It is true that the <name type="PERSON">Took</name> family had long been pre-eminent; for the office of <name type="GPE">T<name type="PERSON">hai</name>n</name> had
            passed to them (from the Oldbucks) some centu<name type="GPE">ri</name>es before, and the chief <name type="PERSON">Took</name> had borne
            that title ever since. The <name type="GPE">T<name type="PERSON">hai</name>n</name> was the master of the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>-moot, and captain of the
            <name type="LOC">Shire</name>-muster and the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbitry-in-arms, but as muster and moot were only held in times of
            emergency, which no longer occurred, the <name type="GPE">T<name type="PERSON">hai</name>n</name>ship had ceased to be more than a nominal
            dignity. The <name type="PERSON">Took</name> family was still, indeed, accorded a special respect, for it remained
            both numerous and exceedingly wealthy, and was liable to produce in every generation
            strong characters of peculiar habits and even adventurous temperament. The latter
            qualities, however, were now rather tolerated (in the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ch) than generally approved. The
            cus<name type="PERSON">tom</name> endured, n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>theless, of refer<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng to the head of the family as The <name type="PERSON">Took</name>, and of
            adding to his name, if required, a number: such as <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>g<name type="GPE">ri</name>m the <name type="ORDINAL">Second</name>, for
            instance.</p>
        <p>The only real official in the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> at this date was the <name type="DATE">May</name>or of <name type="PERSON">Michel Delving</name> (or of
            the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>), who was elected every <name type="CARDINAL">seven</name> <name type="DATE">year</name>s at the Free <name type="ORG">Fair</name> on the White <name type="LOC">Downs</name> at the
            Lithe, that is at <name type="DATE">Mid<name type="DATE">summer</name></name>. As mayor almost his only duty was to preside at banquets,
            given on the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>-holi<name type="DATE">day</name>s, which occurred at frequent intervals. But the offices of
            Postmaster and <name type="ORDINAL">First</name> Shir<name type="GPE">ri</name>ff were attached to the mayoralty, so that he managed both
            the <name type="PERSON">Messenger</name> Service and the Watch. These were the only <name type="LOC">Shire</name>-services, and the
            <name type="PERSON">Messenger</name>s were the most numerous, and much the busier of the <name type="CARDINAL">two</name>. By no means all
            <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbits were lettered, but those who were wrote constantly to all their f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends (and a
            selection of their relations) who lived further off than an <name type="TIME">after<name type="TIME">noon</name></name>'s walk.</p>
        <p>The Shir<name type="GPE">ri</name>ffs was the name that the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbits gave to their police, or the nearest
            equi<name type="GPE">vale</name>nt that they possessed. They had, of course, no uniforms (such things being
            quite unknown), only a feather in their caps; and they were in practice rather haywards
            than policemen, more concerned with the strayings of beasts than of people. There were
            in all the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> only <name type="CARDINAL">twelve</name> of them, <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> in each <name type="LOC">Far</name>thing, for Inside Work. A rather
            larger body, varying at need, was employed to 'beat the bounds', and to see that
            <name type="ORG">Outsiders</name> of any kind, great or small, did not make themselves a nuisance.</p>
        <p>At the time when this story begins the <name type="PERSON">Bounders</name>, as they were called, had been greatly
            increased. There were many reports and complaints of strange persons and creatures
            prowling about the borders, or over them: the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> sign that all was not quite as it
            should be, and always had been except in tales and legends of <name type="DATE">long ago</name>. Few heeded the
            sign, and not even <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> yet had any notion of what it por<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ded. <name type="CARDINAL">Six</name>ty <name type="DATE">year</name>s had passed
            since he set out on his memorable journey, and he was old even for <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbits, who reached
            <name type="CARDINAL">a <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name></name> as of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> as not; but much evidently still remained of the considerable wealth
            that he had brought back. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w much or how little he revealed to no <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, not even to
            <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> his favou<name type="GPE">ri</name>te 'nephew'. And he still kept <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng that he bad found.</p>
        <p>As is told in The <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbit, there came <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> <name type="DATE">day</name> to <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>'s door the great <name type="ORG">Wizard</name>, <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>
            the <name type="ORG">Grey</name>, and <name type="CARDINAL">thirteen</name> dwarves with him: n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> other, indeed, than <name type="PERSON">Tho<name type="GPE">ri</name>n</name> Oakenshield,
            descendant of kings, and his <name type="CARDINAL">twelve</name> companions in exile. With them he set out, to his
            own lasting astonishment, on <name type="TIME">a <name type="TIME">morning</name></name> of <name type="DATE">Ap<name type="GPE">ri</name>l</name>, it being then <name type="DATE">the <name type="DATE">year</name></name> 13<name type="CARDINAL">4</name>1
            <name type="LOC">Shire</name>-reckoning, on a quest of great treasure, the dwarf-hoards of the <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>gs under the
            <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>, beneath Erebor in <name type="ORG">Dale</name>, far off in the <name type="LOC">East</name>. The quest was successful, and the
            Dragon that guarded the hoard was destroyed. Yet, though before all was won the <name type="EVENT">Battle</name>
            of <name type="CARDINAL">Five</name> Armies was fought, and <name type="PERSON">Tho<name type="GPE">ri</name>n</name> was slain, and many deeds of renown were <name type="PERSON">don</name>e, the
            matter would scarcely have concerned later history, or earned more than a note in the
            long annals of the <name type="ORDINAL">Third</name> Age, but for an 'accident' by the way. The party was assailed
            by <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s in a high pass of the <name type="LOC">Misty <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s</name> as they went towards <name type="PERSON">Wilderland</name>; and so it
            happened that <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> was lost for a while in the black orc-mines deep under the
            mountains, and there, as he groped in vain in the dark, he put his hand on a <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng, lying
            on the floor of a tunnel. He put it in his pocket. It seemed then like mere luck.</p>
        <p>Trying to find his way out. <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> went on down to the roots of the mountains, until he
            could go no further. At the bot<name type="PERSON">tom</name> of the tunnel lay a cold lake far from the light, and
            on an island of rock in the water lived <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>. He was a loathsome little creature: he
            paddled a small boat with his large flat feet, pee<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng with pale luminous eyes and
            cat<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g blind fish with his long fingers, and eating them raw. He ate any living thing,
            even orc, if he could catch it and strangle it without a struggle. He possessed a <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret
            treasure that had come to him long <name type="DATE">ages ago</name>, when he still lived in the light: a <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng of
            gold that made its wearer invisible. It was the <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> thing he loved, his 'precious', and
            he talked to it, even when it was not with him. For he kept it hidden safe in a hole on
            his island, except when he was hunting or spying on the ores of the mines.</p>
        <p><name type="DATE">May</name>be he would have attacked <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> at once, if the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng had been on him when they met;
            but it was not, and the hobbit held in his hand an <name type="PERSON">Elvish</name> knife, which served him as a
            sword. So to gain time <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> challenged <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> to the <name type="PERSON">Riddle</name>-game, saying that if he
            asked a <name type="GPE">ri</name>ddle which <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> could not guess, then he would kill him and eat him; but if
            <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> defeated him, then he would do as <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> wished: he would lead him to a way out of
            the tunnels.</p>
        <p>Since he was lost in the dark without hope, and could neither go on nor back. <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>
            accepted the challenge; and they asked <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> another many <name type="GPE">ri</name>ddles. In the end <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> won
            the game, more by luck (as it seemed) than by wits; for he was stumped at last for a
            <name type="GPE">ri</name>ddle to ask, and c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed out, as his hand came upon the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng he lad picked up and
            forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>: _What haw I got in my pocket?_ This <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> failed to answer, though he
            demanded <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> guesses.</p>
        <p>The Autho<name type="GPE">ri</name>ties, it is true, differ whether this last question was a mere 'question' and
            not a '<name type="GPE">ri</name>ddle' according to the st<name type="GPE">ri</name>ct rules of the Game; but all agree that, after
            accepting it and trying to guess the answer, <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> was bound by his promise. And <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>
            pressed him to keep his word; for the thought came to him that this slimy creature might
            prove false, even though such promises were held sacred, and of old all but the
            wickedest things feared to break them. But after ages al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> in the dark <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>'s heart
            was black, and treachery was in it. He slipped away, and returned to the island, of
            which <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> knew nothing, not far off in the dark water. There, he thought, lay his
            <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng. He was hungry now, and angry, and once his 'precious' was with him he would not
            fear any weapon at all.</p>
        <p>But the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng was not on the island; he had lost it, it was g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. His screech sent a
            shiver down <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>'s back, though he did not yet understand what had happened. But <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>
            had at last leaped to a guess, too late. _What has it got in its pocketses?_ he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed.
            The light in his eyes was like a green flame as he sped back to murder the hobbit and
            recover his 'precious'. Just in time <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> saw his pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>l, and he fled blindly up the
            passage away from the water; and once more he was saved by his luck. For just as he ran
            he put his hand in his pocket, and the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng slipped quietly on to his finger. So it was
            that <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> passed him without seeing him, and went to guard the way out, lest the
            'thief' should escape. Wa<name type="GPE">ri</name>ly <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> followed him, as he went along, cursing, and talking
            to himself about his 'precious'; from which talk at last even <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> guessed the truth,
            and hope came to him in the darkness: he himself had found the <name type="PERSON">mar</name>vellous <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng and a
            chance of escape from the orcs and from <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>.</p>
        <p>At length they came to a halt before an unseen opening that led to the lower gates of the
            mines, on the eastward side of the mountains. There <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> crouched at bay, smelling and
            lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing; and <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> was tempted to slay him with his sword. But pity stayed him, and
            though he kept the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng, in which his only hope lay, he would not use it to help him
            kill the wretched creature at a disadvantage. In the end, gathe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng his courage, he
            leaped over <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> in the dark, and fled away down the passage, pursued by his enemy's
            c<name type="GPE">ri</name>es of hate and despair: _Thief, thief! <name type="PERSON">Baggins</name>! We hates it for ever!_</p>
        <p>Now it is a cu<name type="GPE">ri</name>ous fact that this is not the story as <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> told it to his
            companions. To them his account was that <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> had promised to give him a _present,_ if
            he won the game; but when <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> went to fetch it from his island he found the treasure
            was g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>: a magic <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng, which had been given to him <name type="DATE">long ago</name> on his birth<name type="DATE">day</name>. <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>
            guessed that this was the very <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng that he had found, and as he had won the game, it
            was already his by <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght. But being in a tight place, he said nothing about it, and made
            <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> show him the way out, as a reward instead of a present. This account <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> set
            down in his memoirs, and he seems never to have altered it himself, not even after the
            <name type="ORG">Council</name> of <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name>. Evidently it still appeared in the o<name type="GPE">ri</name>ginal Red Book, as it did in
            several of the copies and abstracts. But many copies contain the true account (as an
            alternative), de<name type="GPE">ri</name>ved no doubt from notes by <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> or <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>wise, both of whom learned the
            truth, though they seem to have been unwilling to delete anything actually w<name type="GPE">ri</name>t<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> by
            the old hobbit himself.</p>
        <p><name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, however, disbelieved <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>'s <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> story, as soon as he heard it, and he
            continued to be very cu<name type="GPE">ri</name>ous about the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng. Eventually he got the true tale out of
            <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> after much questioning, which for a while strained their f<name type="GPE">ri</name>endship; but the
            wizard seemed to think the truth imp<name type="GPE">ortan</name>t. Though he did not say so to <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>, he also
            thought it imp<name type="GPE">ortan</name>t, and disturbing, to find that the good hobbit had not told the
            truth from the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>: quite contrary to his habit. The idea of a 'present' was not mere
            hobbitlike invention, all the same. It was suggested to <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>, as he confessed, by
            <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>'s talk that he overheard; for <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> did, in fact, call the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng his 'birth<name type="DATE">day</name>
            present', many times. That also <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> thought strange and suspicious; but he did not
            discover the truth in this point for many more <name type="DATE">year</name>s, as will be seen in this book.</p>
        <p>Of <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>'s later adventures little more need be said here. With the help of the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng he
            escaped from the orc-guards at the gate and rejoined his companions. He used the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng
            many times on his quest, chiefly for the help of his f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends; but he kept it <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret from
            them as long as he could. After his return to his home he never spoke of it again to
            any<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, save <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> and <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>; and no <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> else in the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> knew of its exis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ce, or
            so he believed. Only to <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> did he show the account of his Journey that he was
            w<name type="GPE">ri</name>ting.</p>
        <p>His sword, <name type="PERSON">Sting</name>, <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> hung over his fireplace, and his coat of <name type="PERSON">mar</name>vellous mail, the
            gift of the <name type="ORG">Dwarves</name> from the Dragon-hoard, he lent to a museum, to the <name type="PERSON">Michel Delving</name>
            Mathom-house in fact. But he kept in a drawer at <name type="FAC">Bag End</name> the old cloak and hood that he
            had worn on his travels; and the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng, <name type="ORG">sec</name>ured by a fine c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>n, remained in his
            pocket.</p>
        <p>He returned to his home at <name type="FAC">Bag End</name> on <name type="DATE">June</name> the 22nd in his <name type="CARDINAL">fifty</name>-<name type="ORG">sec</name>ond <name type="DATE">year</name> (S.R. 13<name type="CARDINAL">4</name>2),
            and nothing very notable occurred in the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> until Mr. <name type="PERSON">Baggins</name> began the preparations
            for the celebration of his <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name>-and-eleventh birth<name type="DATE">day</name> (S.R. 1<name type="CARDINAL">4</name>01). At this point this
            History begins.</p>
        <p>At the end of the <name type="ORDINAL">Third</name> Age the part played by the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbits in the great events that led
            to the inclusion of the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> in the Reunited <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>gdom awakened among them a more
            widespread interest in their own history; and many of their traditions, <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name> that time
            still mainly oral, were collected and W<name type="GPE">ri</name>t<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> down. The greater families were also
            concerned with events in the <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>gdom at large, and many of their members studied its
            ancient histo<name type="GPE">ri</name>es and legends. By the end of the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> century of the <name type="CARDINAL">Four</name>th Age there
            were already to be found in the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> several libra<name type="GPE">ri</name>es that contained many histo<name type="GPE">ri</name>cal
            books and records.</p>
        <p>The largest of these collections were probably at Undertowers, at Great Smials, and at
            <name type="ORG">Brand</name>y <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>l. This account of the end of the <name type="ORDINAL">Third</name> Age is drawn mainly from the Red Book
            of <name type="LOC">West</name><name type="PERSON">mar</name>ch. That most imp<name type="GPE">ortan</name>t source for the history of <name type="EVENT">the War of the</name> <name type="ORG">Ring</name> was so
            called because it was long preserved at Undertowers, the home of the <name type="ORG">Fair</name>bairns, <name type="PERSON">Warden</name>s
            of the <name type="LOC">West</name><name type="PERSON">mar</name>ch. It was in o<name type="GPE">ri</name>gin <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>'s p<name type="GPE">ri</name>vate diary, which he took with him to
            <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name>. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> brought it back to the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>, together with many loose leaves of notes,
            and du<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng S.R. <name type="CARDINAL">1<name type="CARDINAL">4</name>20</name>-1 he nearly filled its pages with his account of the War. But
            annexed to it and preserved with it, probably m a single red case, were the <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> large
            volumes, bound in red leather, that <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> gave to him as a parting gift. To these <name type="CARDINAL">four</name>
            volumes there was added in <name type="LOC">West</name><name type="PERSON">mar</name>ch a <name type="ORDINAL">fifth</name> containing commenta<name type="GPE">ri</name>es, genealogies, and
            va<name type="GPE">ri</name>ous other matter concerning the hobbit members of the Fellowship.</p>
        <p>The o<name type="GPE">ri</name>ginal Red Book has not been preserved, but many copies were made, especially of
            the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> volume, for the use of the descendants of the children of <name type="PERSON">Master <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>wise</name>. The
            most imp<name type="GPE">ortan</name>t copy, however, has a different history. It was kept at Great Smials, but
            it was w<name type="GPE">ri</name>t<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> in Condor, probably at the request of the great-grandson of <name type="PERSON">Pereg<name type="GPE">ri</name>n</name>, and
            completed in S.R. 1592 (F.A. 172). Its southern sc<name type="GPE">ri</name>be appended this note: Findegil,
            <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g's W<name type="GPE">ri</name>ter, finished this work in IV 172. It is an exact copy in all details of the
            <name type="GPE">T<name type="PERSON">hai</name>n</name>'s Book m Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name>. That book was a copy, made at the request of <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g <name type="ORG">Elessar</name>,
            of the Red Book of the <name type="PERSON">Pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>an</name>nath, and was brought to him by the <name type="GPE">T<name type="PERSON">hai</name>n</name> <name type="PERSON">Pereg<name type="GPE">ri</name>n</name> when he
            retired to <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> in IV 6<name type="CARDINAL">4</name>.</p>
        <p>The <name type="GPE">T<name type="PERSON">hai</name>n</name>'s Book was thus the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> copy made of the Red Book and contained much that was
            later omitted or lost. In Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name> it received much annotation, and many
            corrections, especially of names, words, and quotations in the <name type="PERSON">Elvish</name> languages; and
            there was added to it an abbreviated version of those parts of _The Tale of <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> and
            <name type="PERSON">Arwen</name>_ which lie outside the account of the War. The full tale is stated to have been
            w<name type="GPE">ri</name>t<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> by <name type="LOC">Barahir</name>, grandson of the <name type="ORG">Steward</name> <name type="LOC">Far</name>amir, some time after the passing of the
            <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g. But the chief imp<name type="GPE">ortan</name>ce of Findegil's copy is that it al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> contains the whole of
            <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>'s 'Translations from the <name type="PERSON">Elvish</name>'. These <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> volumes were found to be a work of
            great skill and learning in which, between 1<name type="CARDINAL">4</name>03 and 1<name type="CARDINAL">4</name>18, he had used all the sources
            available to him in <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name>, both living and w<name type="GPE">ri</name>t<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>. But since they were little used
            by <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, being almost entirely concerned with the <name type="DATE">Elder Days</name>, no more is said of them
            here.</p>
        <p>Since <name type="PERSON">Me<name type="GPE">ri</name>adoc</name> and <name type="PERSON">Pereg<name type="GPE">ri</name>n</name> became the heads of their great families, and at the same
            time kept up their connexions with <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> and <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>, the libra<name type="GPE">ri</name>es at <name type="ORG">Bucklebury</name> and
            <name type="GPE">Tuckborough</name> contained much that did not appear in the Red Book. In <name type="ORG">Brand</name>y <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>l there
            were many works dealing with <name type="ORG">E<name type="GPE">ri</name>ador</name> and the history of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>. Some of these were
            composed or begun by <name type="PERSON">Me<name type="GPE">ri</name>adoc</name> himself, though in the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> he was chiefly remembered for
            his _Herblore of the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>,_ and for his _Reckoning of Years_ m which he discussed the
            relation of the calendars of the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> and <name type="PERSON">Bree</name> to those of <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name>, <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>, and
            <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>. He also wrote a short treatise on _Old Words and Names in the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>,_ having
            special interest in discove<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng the kinship with the language of the Rohir<name type="GPE">ri</name>m of such
            'shire-words' as _mathom_ and old elements in place names.</p>
        <p>At Great Smials the books were of less interest to <name type="LOC">Shire</name>-folk, though more imp<name type="GPE">ortan</name>t for
            larger history. N<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of them was w<name type="GPE">ri</name>t<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> by <name type="PERSON">Pereg<name type="GPE">ri</name>n</name>, but he and his successors
            collected many manusc<name type="GPE">ri</name>pts w<name type="GPE">ri</name>t<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> by sc<name type="GPE">ri</name>bes of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>: mainly copies or sum<name type="PERSON">mar</name>ies of
            histo<name type="GPE">ri</name>es or legends relating to <name type="PERSON">Elen</name>dil and his heirs. Only here in the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> were to
            be found ex<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>sive mate<name type="GPE">ri</name>als for the history of N�menor and the a<name type="GPE">ri</name>sing of <name type="ORG">Sauron</name>. It
            was probably at Great Smials that _The Tale of Years_ was put together, with the
            assistance of mate<name type="GPE">ri</name>al collected by <name type="PERSON">Me<name type="GPE">ri</name>adoc</name>. Though the dates given are of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>
            conjectural, especially for the <name type="ORDINAL">Second</name> Age, they deserve at<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>tion. It is probable that
            <name type="PERSON">Me<name type="GPE">ri</name>adoc</name> obtained assistance and information from <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name>, which he visited more than
            once. There, though <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name> had departed, his sons long remained, together with some of
            the High-<name type="ORG">elven</name> folk. It is said that <name type="EVENT">Celeborn</name> went to dwell there after the departure of
            <name type="PERSON">Galad<name type="GPE">ri</name>el</name>; but there is no record of the <name type="DATE">day</name> when at last he sought the <name type="ORG">Grey</name> <name type="GPE">Haven</name>s, and
            with him went the last living memory of the <name type="DATE">Elder Days</name> in <name type="LOC">Middle-<name type="LOC">earth</name></name>.</p>

            <p>A <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ng-expected <name type="ORG">Party</name></p>
            <p>When Mr. <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> <name type="PERSON">Baggins</name> of <name type="FAC">Bag End</name> announced that he would shortly be celebrating his
                <name type="DATE">eleventy-<name type="ORDINAL">first</name></name> birth<name type="DATE">day</name> with a party of special magnificence, there was much talk
                and excitement in <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbiton.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> was very <name type="GPE">ri</name>ch and very peculiar, and had been the wonder of the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> for <name type="CARDINAL">six</name>ty
                <name type="DATE">year</name>s, ever since his re<name type="PERSON">mar</name>kable disappearance and unexpected return. The <name type="GPE">ri</name>ches he
                had brought back from his travels had now become a local legend, and it was
                popularly believed, whatever the old folk might say, that the <name type="ORG">Hill</name> at <name type="FAC">Bag End</name> was
                full of tunnels stuf<name type="ORG">fed</name> with treasure. And if that was not enough for fame, there
                was also his prolonged vigour to <name type="PERSON">mar</name>vel at. <name type="PERSON">Tim</name>e wore on, but it seemed to have
                little effect on Mr. <name type="PERSON">Baggins</name>. At <name type="CARDINAL">nine</name>ty he was much the same as at <name type="CARDINAL">fifty</name>. At
                <name type="CARDINAL">nine</name>ty-<name type="CARDINAL">nine</name> they began to call him _well_-preserved, but _unchanged_ would have been
                nearer the <name type="PERSON">mar</name>k. There were some that shook their heads and thought this was too
                much of a good thing; it seemed unfair that any<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> should possess (apparently)
                perpetual youth as well as (reputedly) inexhaustible wealth.</p>
            <p><q>'It will have to be paid for,'</q> they said. <q>'It isn't natural, and trouble
                    will come of it!'</q></p>
            <p>But so far trouble had not come; and as Mr. <name type="PERSON">Baggins</name> was generous with his m<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>y, most
                people were willing to forgive him his oddities and his good fortune. He remained on
                visiting terms with his relatives (except, of course, the Sackville-<name type="PERSON">Baggins</name>es), and
                he had many devoted admirers among the hobbits of poor and unimp<name type="GPE">ortan</name>t families. But
                he had no close f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends, until some of his younger cousins began to grow up.</p>
            <p>The eldest of these, and <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>'s favou<name type="GPE">ri</name>te, was young <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> <name type="PERSON">Baggins</name>. When <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> was
                <name type="CARDINAL">nine</name>ty-<name type="CARDINAL">nine</name>, he adopted <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> as his heir, and brought him to live at <name type="FAC">Bag End</name>; and
                the hopes of the Sackville-<name type="PERSON">Baggins</name>es were finally dashed. <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> and <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> happened
                to have the same birth<name type="DATE">day</name>, <name type="DATE">September</name> 22nd. <q>'You had better come and live here,
                    <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> my lad,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> <name type="DATE">day</name>; <q>'and then we can celebrate our
                    birth<name type="DATE">day</name>-parties comfortably together.'</q> At that time <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> was still in his
                _tweens,_ as the hobbits called the irresponsible twenties between childhood and
                coming of age at <name type="CARDINAL">thirty</name>-<name type="CARDINAL">three</name>.</p>
            <p><name type="DATE">Twelve more <name type="DATE">year</name>s</name> passed. <name type="DATE">Each <name type="DATE">year</name></name> the <name type="PERSON">Baggins</name>es had given very lively combined
                birth<name type="DATE">day</name>-parties at <name type="FAC">Bag End</name>; but now it was understood that something quite
                exceptional was being planned for that <name type="DATE">autumn</name>. <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> was going to be _<name type="CARDINAL">eleventy-<name type="CARDINAL">one</name></name>,_
                <name type="CARDINAL">111</name>, a rather cu<name type="GPE">ri</name>ous number and a very respectable age for a hobbit (the Old <name type="PERSON">Took</name>
                himself had only reached <name type="CARDINAL">130</name>); and <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> was going to be _<name type="CARDINAL">thirty</name>-<name type="CARDINAL">three</name>,_ <name type="CARDINAL">33</name>) an
                imp<name type="GPE">ortan</name>t number: the date of his 'coming of age'.</p>
            <p>Tongues began to wag in <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbiton and <name type="PERSON">Bywater</name>; and rumour of the coming event
                travelled all over the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>. The history and character of Mr. <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> <name type="PERSON">Baggins</name> became
                once again the chief topic of conversation; and the older folk suddenly found their
                reminiscences in welcome demand.</p>
            <p>No <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> had a more at<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>tive audience than old Ham <name type="PERSON">Gamgee</name>, commonly known as the
                <name type="PERSON">Gaffer</name>. He held forth at _The Ivy <name type="PERSON">Bush</name>_, a small inn on the <name type="PERSON">Bywater</name> road; and he
                spoke with some autho<name type="GPE">ri</name>ty, for he had <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ded the garden at <name type="FAC">Bag End</name> for <name type="CARDINAL">forty</name> <name type="DATE">year</name>s,
                and had helped old <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>lman in the same job before that. Now that he was himself
                growing old and stiff in the joints, the job was mainly car<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed on by his youngest
                son, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> <name type="PERSON">Gamgee</name>. Both father and son were on very f<name type="GPE">ri</name>endly terms with <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> and
                <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. They lived on the <name type="ORG">Hill</name> itself, in Number 3 <name type="ORG">Bagshot Row</name> just below Bag
                End.</p>
            <p><q>'A very nice well-spoken gentlehobbit is Mr. <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>, as I've always said,'</q> the
                <name type="PERSON">Gaffer</name> declared. With perfect truth: for <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> was very polite to him, calling him
                'Master <name type="LOC">Hamfast</name>', and consulting him constantly upon the growing of vegetables � in
                the matter of 'roots', especially potatoes, the <name type="PERSON">Gaffer</name> was recognized as the leading
                autho<name type="GPE">ri</name>ty by all in the neighbourhood (including himself).</p>
            <p><q>'But what about this <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> that lives with him?'</q> asked <name type="PERSON">Old Noakes</name> of <name type="PERSON">Bywater</name>.
                    <q>'<name type="PERSON">Baggins</name> is his name, but he's more than <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> a <name type="ORG">Brand</name>ybuck, they say. It
                    beats me why any <name type="PERSON">Baggins</name> of <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbiton should go looking for a wife away there in
                    <name type="PERSON">Buckland</name>, where folks are so queer.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'And no wonder they're queer,'</q> put in <name type="PERSON">Daddy <name type="CARDINAL">Two</name>foot</name> (the <name type="PERSON">Gaffer</name>'s next-door
                neighbour), <q>'if they live on the wrong side of the <name type="ORG">Brand</name>ywine <name type="LOC">River</name>, and <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght
                    agin the Old <name type="ORG">Forest</name>. That's a dark bad place, if <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> the tales be
                true.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'You're <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght, Dad!'</q> said the <name type="PERSON">Gaffer</name>. <q>'Not that the <name type="ORG">Brand</name>ybucks of
                    Buck-land live _in_ the Old <name type="ORG">Forest</name>; but they're a queer breed, seemingly. They
                    fool about with boats on that big <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver � and that isn't natural. Small wonder
                    that trouble came of it, I say. But be that as it may, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> is as nice a
                    young hobbit as you could wish to meet. Very much like Mr. <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>, and in more
                    than looks. After all his father was a <name type="PERSON">Baggins</name>. A decent respectable hobbit was
                    Mr. <name type="ORG">Drogo</name> <name type="PERSON">Baggins</name>; there was never much to tell of him, till he was
                    drownded.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'<name type="GPE">Drownded</name>?'</q> said several voices. They had heard this and other darker rumours
                before, of course; but hobbits have a passion for family history, and they were
                ready to hear it again. <q>'Well, so they say,'</q> said the <name type="PERSON">Gaffer</name>. 'You see: Mr.
                <name type="ORG">Drogo</name>, he <name type="PERSON">mar</name><name type="GPE">ri</name>ed poor Miss P<name type="GPE">ri</name>mula <name type="ORG">Brand</name>ybuck. She was our Mr. <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>'s <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> cousin
                on the mother's side (her mother being the youngest of the Old <name type="PERSON">Took</name>'s daughters);
                and Mr. <name type="ORG">Drogo</name> was his <name type="ORG">sec</name>ond cousin. So Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> is his <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> _and_ <name type="ORG">sec</name>ond cousin,
                once removed either way, as the saying is, if you follow me. And Mr. <name type="ORG">Drogo</name> was
                staying at <name type="ORG">Brand</name>y <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>l with his father-in-law, old Master <name type="PERSON">Gorbadoc</name>, as he of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> did
                after his <name type="PERSON">mar</name><name type="GPE">ri</name>age (him being partial to his vittles, and old <name type="PERSON">Gorbadoc</name> keeping a
                mighty generous table); and he went out _boating_on the <name type="ORG">Brand</name>ywine <name type="LOC">River</name>; and he and
                his wife were drownded, and poor Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> only a child and all. '</p>
            <p><q>'I've heard they went on the water after dinner in the moonlight,'</q> said Old
                Noakes; <q>'and it was <name type="ORG">Drogo</name>'s w<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name> as sunk the boat.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'And _I_ heard she pushed him in, and he pulled her in after him,'</q> said
                <name type="PERSON">Sandyman</name>, the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbiton <name type="ORG">miller</name>.</p>
            <p><q>'You shouldn't lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> to all you hear, <name type="PERSON">Sandyman</name>,'</q> said the <name type="PERSON">Gaffer</name>, who did not
                much like the <name type="ORG">miller</name>. 'There isn't no call to go talking of pushing and pulling.
                Boats are quite t<name type="GPE">ri</name>cky enough for those that sit still without looking further for
                the cause of trouble. Anyway: there was this Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> left an orphan and stranded,
                as you might say, among those queer <name type="PERSON">Buckland</name>ers, being brought up anyhow in <name type="ORG">Brand</name>y
                <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>l. A regular warren, by all accounts. Old Master <name type="PERSON">Gorbadoc</name> never had fewer than a
                couple of <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name> relations in the place. Mr. <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> never did a kinder deed than
                when he brought the lad back to live among decent folk.</p>
            <p>
                <q>'But I reckon it was a nasty shock for those Sackville-<name type="PERSON">Baggins</name>es. They thought
                    they were going to get <name type="FAC">Bag End</name>, that time when he went off and was thought to be
                    dead. And then he comes back and orders them off; and he goes on living and
                    living, and never looking <name type="DATE">a <name type="DATE">day</name></name> older, bless him! And suddenly he produces an
                    heir, and has all the papers made out proper. The Sackville-<name type="PERSON">Baggins</name>es won't
                    never see the inside of <name type="FAC">Bag End</name> now, or it is to be hoped not.'</q>
            </p>
            <p><q>'There's a tidy bit of m<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>y tucked away up there, I hear tell,'</q> said a
                stranger, a visitor on business from <name type="PERSON">Michel Delving</name> in the <name type="LOC">West</name>farthing. 'All the
                top of your hill is full of tunnels packed with chests of gold and silver,
                _and_jools, by what I've heard. '</p>
            <p><q>'Then you've heard more than I can speak to,'</q> answered the <name type="PERSON">Gaffer</name>. I know
                nothing about _jools._ Mr. <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> is free with his m<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>y, and there seems no lack of
                it; but I know of no tunnel-making. I saw Mr. <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> when he came back, a matter of
                <name type="CARDINAL">six</name>ty <name type="DATE">year</name>s ago, when I was a lad. I'd not long come prentice to old <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>lman (him
                being my dad's cousin), but he had me up at <name type="FAC">Bag End</name> helping him to keep folks from
                trampling and trapessing all over the garden while the sale was on. And in the
                middle of it all Mr. <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> comes up the <name type="ORG">Hill</name> with a pony and some mighty big bags
                and a couple of chests. I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t doubt they were mostly full of treasure he had
                picked up in foreign parts, where there be mountains of gold, they say; but there
                wasn't enough to fill tunnels. But my lad <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> will know more about that. He's in and
                out of <name type="FAC">Bag End</name>. Crazy about sto<name type="GPE">ri</name>es of the old <name type="DATE">day</name>s he is, and he lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>s to all Mr.
                <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>'s tales. Mr. <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> has learned him his letters � meaning no harm, <name type="PERSON">mar</name>k you,
                and I hope no harm will come of it.</p>
            <p>_'<name type="ORG">Elves</name> and Dragons'_ I says to him. <q>'_Cabbages and potatoes are better for me and
                    you. <name type="PERSON">Don</name>'t go getting mixed up in the business of your betters, or you'll land
                    in trouble too big for you,'</q>_I says to him. And I might say it to others,'
                he added with a look at the stranger and the <name type="ORG">miller</name>.</p>
            <p>But the <name type="PERSON">Gaffer</name> did not convince his audience. The legend of <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>'s wealth was now
                too firmly fixed in the minds of the younger generation of hobbits.</p>
            <p><q>'Ah, but he has likely enough been adding to what he brought at <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>,'</q> argued
                the <name type="ORG">miller</name>, voicing common opinion. <q>'He's of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> away from home. And look at the
                    outlandish folk that visit him: dwarves coming at <name type="TIME">night</name>, and that old <name type="PERSON">wan</name>de<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng
                    conjuror, <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, and all. You can say what you like, <name type="PERSON">Gaffer</name>, but <name type="FAC">Bag End</name>'s a
                    queer place, and its folk are queerer.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'And you can say _what you_ like, about what you know no more of than you do of
                    boating, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Sandyman</name>,'</q> retorted the <name type="PERSON">Gaffer</name>, disliking the <name type="ORG">miller</name> even more
                than usual. If that's being queer, then we could do with a bit more queerness in
                these parts. There's some not far away that wouldn't offer a pint of beer to a
                f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end, if they lived in a hole with golden walls. But they do things proper at Bag
                End. Our <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> says that _every<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>'s_ going to be invited to the party, and there's
                going to be presents, <name type="PERSON">mar</name>k you, presents for all � <name type="DATE">this very month</name> as is.'</p>
            <p><name type="DATE">That very month</name> was <name type="DATE">September</name>, and as fine as you could ask. <name type="DATE">A <name type="DATE">day</name></name> or <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> later a
                rumour (probably started by the knowledgeable <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>) was spread about that there were
                going to be fireworks � fireworks, what is more, such as had not been seen in the
                <name type="LOC">Shire</name> for nigh on <name type="DATE">a century</name>, not indeed since the Old <name type="PERSON">Took</name> died.</p>
            <p>Days passed and <name type="DATE">The Day</name> drew nearer. An odd-looking waggon laden with odd-looking
                packages rolled into <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbiton <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> <name type="TIME">evening</name> and toiled up the <name type="ORG">Hill</name> to <name type="FAC">Bag End</name>. The
                startled hobbits peered out of lamplit doors to <name type="PERSON">gape</name> at it. It was d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ven by
                outlandish folk, singing strange songs: dwarves with long beards and deep hoods. A
                few of them remained at <name type="FAC">Bag End</name>. At the end of the <name type="ORG">sec</name>ond <name type="DATE">week</name> in <name type="DATE">September</name> a cart
                came in through <name type="PERSON">Bywater</name> from the direction of the <name type="ORG">Brand</name>ywine <name type="FAC">B<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge</name> in broad
                <name type="DATE">day</name>light. An old man was d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ving it all al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. He wore a tall pointed blue hat, a
                long grey cloak, and a silver scarf. He had a long white beard and <name type="PERSON">bush</name>y eyebrows
                that stuck out beyond the b<name type="GPE">ri</name>m of his hat. Small hobbit-children ran after the cart
                all through <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbiton and <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght up the hill. It had a cargo of fireworks, as they
                <name type="GPE">ri</name>ghtly guessed. At <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>'s front door the old man began to unload: there were great
                bundles of fireworks of all sorts and shapes, each labelled with a large red G and
                the elf-rune, .</p>
            <p>That was <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>'s <name type="PERSON">mar</name>k, of course, and the old man was <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> the <name type="ORG">Wizard</name>, whose
                fame in the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> was due mainly to his skill with fires, smokes, and lights. His
                real business was far more difficult and dangerous, but the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>-folk knew nothing
                about it. To them he was just <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the <q>'attractions' at the <name type="ORG">Party</name>. <name type="ORG">Hen</name>ce the
                    excitement of the hobbit-children. 'G for Grand!'</q> they shouted, and the old
                man smiled. They knew him by sight, though he only appeared in <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbiton occasionally
                and never stopped long; but neither they nor any but the oldest of their elders had
                seen <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of his firework displays � they now belonged to the legendary past.</p>
            <p>When the old man, helped by <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> and some dwarves, had finished unloading. <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>
                gave <name type="MONEY">a few pennies</name> away; but not a single squib or cracker was forthcoming, to the
                disappointment of the onlookers.</p>
            <p><q>'Run away now!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'You will get plenty when the time
                    comes.'</q> Then he disappeared inside with <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>, and the door was shut. The
                young hobbits stared at the door in vain for a while, and then made off, feeling
                that the <name type="DATE">day</name> of the party would never come.</p>
            <p>Inside <name type="FAC">Bag End</name>, <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> and <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> were sitting at the open window of a small room
                looking out west on to the garden. <name type="TIME">The late <name type="TIME">after<name type="TIME">noon</name></name></name> was b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght and peaceful. The
                flowers glowed red and golden: snap-dragons and sun-flowers, and nasturtiums
                trailing all over the turf walls and peeping in at the round windows.</p>
            <p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght your garden looks!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>.</p>
            <p><q>'Yes,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>. I am very fond indeed of it, and of all the dear old <name type="LOC">Shire</name>;
                but I think I need <name type="DATE">a holi<name type="DATE">day</name></name>.'</p>
            <p>
                <q>'You mean to go on with your plan then?'</q>
            </p>
            <p>
                <q>'I do. I made up my mind <name type="DATE">months</name> ago, and I haven't changed it.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>
                <q>'Very well. It is no good saying any more. <name type="FAC">Stick</name> to your plan � your whole plan,
                    mind � and I hope it will turn out for the best, for you, and for all of
                    us.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>
                <q>'I hope so. Anyway I mean to enjoy myself on <name type="DATE">Thurs<name type="DATE">day</name></name>, and have my little
                    joke.'</q>
            </p>
            <p><q>'Who will laugh, I wonder?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, shaking his head.</p>
            <p><q>'We shall see,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>.</p>
            <p><name type="DATE">The next <name type="DATE">day</name></name> more carts rolled up the <name type="ORG">Hill</name>, and still more carts. There might have
                been some grumbling about 'dealing locally', but that very <name type="DATE">week</name> orders began to pour
                out of <name type="FAC">Bag End</name> for every kind of provision, commodity, or luxury that could be
                obtained in <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbiton or <name type="PERSON">Bywater</name> or anywhere in the neighbourhood. People became
                enthusiastic; and they began to tick off the <name type="DATE">day</name>s on the calendar; and they watched
                eagerly for the postman, hoping for invitations.</p>
            <p>Before long the invitations began pou<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng out, and the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbiton post-office was
                blocked, and the <name type="PERSON">Bywater</name> post-office was snowed under, and voluntary assistant
                postmen were called for. There was a constant stream of them going up the <name type="ORG">Hill</name>,
                carrying <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name>s of polite va<name type="GPE">ri</name>ations on _Thank you, I shall certainly come._</p>
            <p>A notice appeared on the gate at <name type="FAC">Bag End</name>: NO ADMITTANCE EXCEPT <name type="ORG">ON PARTY</name> BUSINESS.
                Even those who had, or pre<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ded to have <name type="ORG">Party</name> Business were seldom allowed inside.
                <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> was busy: w<name type="GPE">ri</name>ting invitations, ticking off answers, packing up presents, and
                making some p<name type="GPE">ri</name>vate preparations of his own. From the time of <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>'s ar<name type="GPE">ri</name>val he
                remained hidden from view.</p>
            <p><name type="CARDINAL">One</name> <name type="TIME">morning</name> the hobbits woke to find the large field, south of <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>'s front door,
                covered with ropes and poles for <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ts and pavilions. A special entrance was cut
                into the bank leading to the road, and wide steps and a large white gate were built
                there. The <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> hobbit-families of <name type="ORG">Bagshot Row</name>, adjoining the field, were in<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>sely
                interested and generally envied. Old <name type="PERSON">Gaffer</name> <name type="PERSON">Gamgee</name> stopped even pre<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ding to work
                in his garden.</p>
            <p>The <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ts began to go up. There was a specially large pavilion, so big that the tree
                that grew in the field was <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght inside it, and stood proudly near <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> end, at the
                head of the chief table. Lanterns were hung on all its branches. More promising
                still (to the hobbits' mind): an enormous open-air kitchen was erected in the north
                corner of the field. A draught of cooks, from every inn and eating-house for miles
                around, ar<name type="GPE">ri</name>ved to supplement the dwarves and other odd folk that were quartered at
                <name type="FAC">Bag End</name>. Excitement rose to its h<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name>.</p>
            <p>Then the weather clouded over. That was on Wednes<name type="DATE">day</name> the eve of the <name type="ORG">Party</name>. Anxiety
                was in<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>se. Then <name type="DATE">Thurs<name type="DATE">day</name></name>, <name type="DATE">September</name> the 22nd, actually <name type="TIME">dawn</name>ed. The sun got up, the
                clouds vanished, flags were unfurled and the fun began.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> <name type="PERSON">Baggins</name> called it a _party,_ but it was really a va<name type="GPE">ri</name>ety of entertainments
                rolled into <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. Practically everybody living near was invited. A very few were
                overlooked by accident, but as they turned up all the same, that did not matter.
                Many people from other parts of the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> were also asked; and there were even a few
                from outside the borders. <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> met the guests (and additions) at the new white gate
                in person. He gave away presents to all and sundry � the latter were those who went
                out again by a back way and came in again by the gate. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbits give presents to
                other people on their own birth<name type="DATE">day</name>s. Not very expensive <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s, as a rule, and not so
                lavishly as on this occasion; but it was not a bad system. Actually in <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbiton and
                <name type="PERSON">Bywater</name> every <name type="DATE">day</name> in <name type="DATE">the <name type="DATE">year</name></name> it was somebody's birth<name type="DATE">day</name>, so that every hobbit in
                those parts had a fair chance of <name type="CARDINAL">at least <name type="CARDINAL">one</name></name> present at least once <name type="DATE">a <name type="DATE">week</name></name>. But they
                never got tired of them.</p>
            <p>On this occasion the presents were unusually good. The hobbit-children were so
                excited that for a while they almost forgot about eating. There were toys the like
                of which they had never seen before, all beautiful and some obviously magical. Many
                of them had indeed been ordered <name type="DATE">a <name type="DATE">year</name></name> before, and had come all the way from the
                <name type="LOC">Mountain</name> and from <name type="ORG">Dale</name>, and were of real dwarf-make.</p>
            <p>When every guest had been welcomed and was finally inside the gate, there were songs,
                dances, music, games, and, of course, food and d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk. There were <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> official
                meals: lunch, tea, and dinner (or supper). But lunch and tea were <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ked chiefly by
                the fact that at those times all the guests were sitting down and eating together.
                At other times there were merely lots of people eating and d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nking � continuously
                from <name type="CARDINAL">elevenses</name> until <name type="CARDINAL">six</name>-<name type="CARDINAL">thirty</name>, when the fireworks started.</p>
            <p>The fireworks were by <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>: they were not only brought by him, but designed and
                made by him; and the special effects, set pieces, and flights of rockets were let
                off by him. But there was also a generous dist<name type="GPE">ri</name>bution of squibs, crackers,
                <name type="PERSON">backarappers</name>, sparklers, torches, dwarf-candles, elf-fountains, goblin-barkers and
                thunder-claps. They were all superb. The art of <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> improved with age.</p>
            <p>There were rockets like a flight of scintillating birds singing with sweet voices.
                There were green trees with trunks of dark smoke: their leaves opened like a whole
                sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng unfolding in a moment, and their shining branches dropped glowing flowers
                down upon the astonished hobbits, disappea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng with a sweet scent just before they
                touched their upturned faces. There were fountains of butterflies that flew
                glitte<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng into the trees; there were pillars of coloured fires that rose and turned
                into eagles, or sailing ships, or a phalanx of flying <name type="NORP">s<name type="PERSON">wan</name>s</name>; there was a red
                thunderstorm and a shower of yellow rain; there was a forest of silver spears that
                sprang suddenly into the air with a yell like an embattled army, and came down again
                into the Water with a hiss like <name type="CARDINAL">a <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name></name> hot snakes. And there was also <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> last
                surp<name type="GPE">ri</name>se, in honour of <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>, and it startled the hobbits exceedingly, as <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>
                in<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ded. The lights went out. A great smoke went up. It shaped itself like a
                mountain seen in the distance, and began to glow at the summit. It spouted green and
                scarlet flames. Out flew a red-golden dragon � not life-size, but ter<name type="GPE">ri</name>bly
                life-like: fire came from his jaws, his eyes glared down; there was a roar, and he
                whizzed <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> times over the heads of the crowd. They all ducked, and many fell flat
                on their faces. The dragon passed like an express train, turned a somersault, and
                burst over <name type="PERSON">Bywater</name> with a dea<name type="PERSON">fen</name>ing explosion.</p>
            <p><q>'That is the signal for supper!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>. The pain and alarm vanished at
                once, and the prostrate hobbits leaped to their feet. There was a splendid supper
                for every<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>; for every<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, that is, except those invited to the special family
                dinner-party. This was held in the great pavilion with the tree. The invitations
                were limited to <name type="CARDINAL">twelve</name> <name type="CARDINAL">dozen</name> (a number also called by the hobbits <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> Gross, though
                the word was not considered proper to use of people); and the guests were selected
                from all the families to which <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> and <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> were related, with the addition of a
                few special unrelated f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends (such as <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>). Many young hobbits were included,
                and present by parental permission; for hobbits were easy-going with their children
                in the matter of sitting up late, especially when there was a chance of getting them
                a free meal. B<name type="GPE">ri</name>nging up young hobbits took a lot of provender.</p>
            <p>There were many <name type="PERSON">Baggins</name>es and <name type="PERSON">Boffin</name>s, and also many <name type="PERSON">Took</name>s and <name type="ORG">Brand</name>ybucks; there
                were va<name type="GPE">ri</name>ous <name type="PERSON">Grubb</name>s (relations of <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> <name type="PERSON">Baggins</name>' grandmother), and va<name type="GPE">ri</name>ous <name type="ORG">Chubb</name>s
                (connexions of his <name type="PERSON">Took</name> grandfather); and a selection of <name type="GPE">Burrowses</name>, <name type="PERSON">Bolger</name>s,
                <name type="PERSON">Bracegirdle</name>s, <name type="GPE">Brockhouses</name>, <name type="ORG">Goodbodies, <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>rnblowers and <name type="PERSON">Proudfoot</name>s</name>. Some of these
                were only very distantly connected with <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>, and some of them had hardly ever been
                in <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbiton before, as they lived in remote corners of the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>. The
                Sackville-<name type="PERSON">Baggins</name>es were not forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>. <name type="ORG">Otho</name> and his wife <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>belia were present. They
                disliked <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> and detested <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, but so magnificent was the invitation card,
                w<name type="GPE">ri</name>t<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> in golden ink, that they had felt it was impossible to refuse. Besides,
                their cousin, <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>, had been specializing in food for <name type="DATE">many <name type="DATE">year</name>s</name> and his table had
                a high reputation.</p>
            <p>All the <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name> and <name type="CARDINAL">forty</name>-<name type="CARDINAL">four</name> guests expected a pleasant feast; though they
                rather dreaded the after-dinner speech of their host (an inevitable item). He was
                liable to drag in bits of what he called poetry; and sometimes, after a glass or
                <name type="CARDINAL">two</name>, would allude to the absurd adventures of his myste<name type="GPE">ri</name>ous journey. The guests
                were not disappointed: they had a _very_ pleasant feast, in fact an engrossing
                entertainment: <name type="GPE">ri</name>ch, abundant, va<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed, and prolonged. The purchase of provisions
                fell almost to nothing throughout the dist<name type="GPE">ri</name>ct in the ensuing <name type="DATE">week</name>s; but as <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>'s
                cate<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng had depleted the stocks of most stores, cellars and warehouses for miles
                around, that did not matter much.</p>
            <p>After the feast (more or less) came the <name type="ORG">Speech</name>. Most of the company were, however,
                now in a tolerant mood, at that delightful stage which they called 'filling up the
                corners'. They were sipping their favou<name type="GPE">ri</name>te d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nks, and nibbling at their favou<name type="GPE">ri</name>te
                dainties, and their fears were forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>. They were prepared to lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> to anything,
                and to cheer at every full stop.</p>
            <p>_My dear People,_ began <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>, <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing in his place. <q>'Hear! Hear! Hear!'</q> they
                shouted, and kept on repeating it in chorus, seeming reluctant to follow their own
                advice. <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> left his place and went and stood on a c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>r under the illuminated
                tree. The light of the lanterns fell on his beaming face; the golden buttons sh<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>
                on his embroidered silk waistcoat. They could all see him standing, waving <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> hand
                in the air, the other was in his trouser-pocket.</p>
            <p>_My dear <name type="PERSON">Baggins</name>es and <name type="PERSON">Boffin</name>s,_ he began again; _and my dear <name type="PERSON">Took</name>s and <name type="ORG">Brand</name>ybucks,
                and <name type="PERSON">Grubb</name>s, and <name type="ORG">Chubb</name>s, and <name type="GPE">Burrowses</name>, and <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>rnblowers, and <name type="PERSON">Bolger</name>s, <name type="PERSON">Bracegirdle</name>s,
                Goodbodies, <name type="GPE">Brockhouses</name> and <name type="PERSON">Proudfoot</name>s._ <q>'ProudFEET!'</q> shouted an elderly
                hobbit from the back of the pavilion. His name, of course, was <name type="PERSON">Proudfoot</name>, and well
                me<name type="GPE">ri</name>ted; his feet were large, exceptionally furry, and both were on the table.</p>
            <p>_<name type="PERSON">Proudfoot</name>s,_ repeated <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>. _Also my good Sackville-<name type="PERSON">Baggins</name>es that I welcome back
                at last to <name type="FAC">Bag End</name>. <name type="DATE">To<name type="DATE">day</name></name> is my <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name> and eleventh birth<name type="DATE">day</name>: I am <name type="CARDINAL">eleventy-<name type="CARDINAL">one</name></name>
                to<name type="DATE">day</name>!_ <q>'Hurray! Hurray! Many Happy Returns!'</q> they shouted, and they hammered
                joyously on the tables. <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> was doing splendidly. This was the sort of stuff they
                liked: short and obvious.</p>
            <p>_I hope you are all enjoying yourselves as much as I am._ Dea<name type="PERSON">fen</name>ing cheers. C<name type="GPE">ri</name>es of
                _Yes_ (and _No)._ Noises of trumpets and horns, pipes and flutes, and other musical
                instruments. There were, as has been said, many young hobbits present. <name type="CARDINAL">Hundreds</name> of
                musical crackers had been pulled. Most of them bore the <name type="PERSON">mar</name>k DALE on them; which did
                not convey much to most of the hobbits, but they all agreed they were <name type="PERSON">mar</name>vellous
                crackers. They contained instruments, small, but of perfect make and enchanting
                t<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s. Indeed, in <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> corner some of the young <name type="PERSON">Took</name>s and <name type="ORG">Brand</name>ybucks, supposing
                Uncle <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> to have finished (since he had plainly said all that was necessary), now
                got up an impromptu orchestra, and began a merry dance-tune. Master <name type="PERSON">Everard <name type="PERSON">Took</name></name> and
                Miss Melilot <name type="ORG">Brand</name>ybuck got on a table and with bells in their hands began to dance
                the <name type="DATE">Sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng</name>le-<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng: a pretty dance, but rather vigorous.</p>
            <p>But <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> had not finished. Seizing a horn from a youngster near by, he blew <name type="CARDINAL">three</name>
                loud hoots. The noise subsided. _I shall not keep you long,_ he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed. Cheers from
                all the assembly. _I have called you all together for a Purpose._ Something in the
                way that he said this made an impression. There was almost silence, and <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> or <name type="CARDINAL">two</name>
                of the <name type="PERSON">Took</name>s p<name type="GPE">ri</name>cked up their ears.</p>
            <p>_Indeed, for <name type="PERSON">Thr</name>ee Purposes! <name type="ORDINAL">First</name> of all, to tell you that I am immensely fond of
                you all, and that <name type="CARDINAL">eleventy-<name type="CARDINAL">one</name></name> <name type="DATE">year</name>s is too short a time to live among such
                excellent and admirable hobbits._ Tremendous outburst of approval.</p>
            <p>_I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t know <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> of you <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> as well as I should like; and I like less than <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> of
                you <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> as well as you deserve._ This was unexpected and rather difficult. There
                was some scattered clapping, but most of them were trying to work it out and see if
                it came to a compliment.</p>
            <p>_<name type="ORDINAL">Second</name>ly, to celebrate my birth<name type="DATE">day</name>._ Cheers again. _I should say: OUR birth<name type="DATE">day</name>. For
                it is, of course, also the birth<name type="DATE">day</name> of my heir and nephew, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. He comes of age
                and into his inhe<name type="GPE">ri</name>tance to<name type="DATE">day</name>._ Some perfunctory clapping by the elders; and some
                loud shouts of <q>'<name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>! <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>! Jolly old <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>,'</q> from the juniors. The
                Sackville-<name type="PERSON">Baggins</name>es scowled, and wondered what was meant by <q>'coming into his
                    inhe<name type="GPE">ri</name>tance'. _Together we score <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name> and <name type="CARDINAL">forty</name>-<name type="CARDINAL">four</name>. Your numbers were
                    chosen to fit this re<name type="PERSON">mar</name>kable total: <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> Gross, if I may use the expression._ No
                    cheers. This was <name type="GPE">ri</name>diculous. Many of his guests, and especially the
                    Sackville-<name type="PERSON">Baggins</name>es, were insulted, feeling sure they had only been asked to
                    fill up the required number, like goods in a package. '<name type="CARDINAL">One</name> Gross, indeed! Vulgar
                    expression.'</q></p>
            <p>_It is also, if I may be allowed to refer to ancient history, the anniversary of my
                ar<name type="GPE">ri</name>val by barrel at <name type="GPE">Esgaroth</name> on the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ng Lake; though the fact that it was_ my
                _birth<name type="DATE">day</name> slipped my memory on that occasion. I was only <name type="CARDINAL">fifty</name>-<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> then, and
                birth<name type="DATE">day</name>s did not seem so imp<name type="GPE">ortan</name>t. The banquet was very splendid, however, though
                I had a bad cold at the time, I remember, and could only say 'thag you very buch'. I
                now repeat it more correctly: Thank you very much for coming to my little party._
                Obstinate silence. They all feared that a song or some poetry was now imminent; and
                they were getting bored. Why couldn't he stop talking and let them d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk his health?
                But <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> did not sing or recite. He paused for a moment.</p>
            <p>_<name type="ORDINAL">Third</name>ly and finally,_ he said, _I wish to make an ANNOUNCEMENT_. He spoke this last
                word so loudly and suddenly that every<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> sat up who still could. _I regret to
                announce that � though, as I said, <name type="CARDINAL">eleventy-<name type="CARDINAL">one</name></name> <name type="DATE">year</name>s is far too short a time to
                spend among you � this is the END. I am going. I am leaving NOW. GOOD-BYE!_</p>
            <p>He stepped down and vanished. There was a blinding flash of light, and the guests all
                blinked. When they opened their eyes <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> was nowhere to be seen. <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name> and
                <name type="CARDINAL">forty</name>-<name type="CARDINAL">four</name> flabbergasted hobbits sat back speechless. Old <name type="PERSON">Odo <name type="PERSON">Proudfoot</name></name> removed his
                feet from the table and stamped. Then there was a dead silence, until suddenly,
                after several deep breaths, every <name type="PERSON">Baggins</name>, <name type="PERSON">Boffin</name>, <name type="PERSON">Took</name>, <name type="ORG">Brand</name>ybuck, <name type="PERSON">Grubb</name>, <name type="ORG">Chubb</name>,
                Burrows, <name type="PERSON">Bolger</name>, <name type="PERSON">Bracegirdle</name>, Brockhouse, Goodbody, <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>rnblower, and <name type="PERSON">Proudfoot</name> began
                to talk at once.</p>
            <p>It was generally agreed that the joke was in very bad taste, and more food and d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk
                were needed to cure the guests of shock and annoyance. <q>'He's mad. I always said
                    so,'</q> was probably the most popular comment. Even the <name type="PERSON">Took</name>s (with a few
                exceptions) thought <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>'s behaviour was absurd. For the moment most of them took
                it for granted that his disappearance was nothing more than a <name type="GPE">ri</name>diculous prank.</p>
            <p>But old <name type="PERSON">Rory</name> <name type="ORG">Brand</name>ybuck was not so sure. Neither age nor an enormous dinner had
                clouded his wits, and he said to his daughter-in-law, <name type="PERSON">Esmeralda</name>: <q>'There's
                    something fishy in this, my dear! I believe that mad <name type="PERSON">Baggins</name> is off again. <name type="PERSON">Silly</name>
                    old fool. But why worry? He hasn't taken the vittles with him.'</q> He called
                loudly to <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> to send the wine round again.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> was the only <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> present who had said nothing. For some time he had sat silent
                beside <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>'s empty c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>r, and ignored all re<name type="PERSON">mar</name>ks and questions. He had enjoyed
                the joke, of course, even though he had been in the know. He had difficulty in
                keeping from laughter at the indignant surp<name type="GPE">ri</name>se of the guests. But at the same time
                he felt deeply troubled: he realized suddenly that he loved the old hobbit dearly.
                Most of the guests went on eating and d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nking and discussing <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> <name type="PERSON">Baggins</name>'
                oddities, past and present; but the Sackville-<name type="PERSON">Baggins</name>es had already departed in
                wrath. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> did not <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t to have any more to do with the party. He gave orders for
                more wine to be served; then he got up and drained his own glass silently to the
                health of <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>, and slipped out of the pavilion.</p>
            <p>As for <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> <name type="PERSON">Baggins</name>, even while he was making his speech, he had been finge<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng the
                golden <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng in his pocket: his magic <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng that he had kept <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret for so <name type="DATE">many <name type="DATE">year</name>s</name>.
                As he stepped down he slipped it on his finger, and he was never seen by any hobbit
                in <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbiton again.</p>
            <p>He walked b<name type="GPE">ri</name>skly back to his hole, and stood for a moment lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing with a smile to
                the din in the pavilion and to the sounds of merrymaking in other parts of the
                field. Then he went in. He took off his party clothes, folded up and wrapped in
                tissue-paper his embroidered silk waistcoat, and put it away. Then he put on quickly
                some old untidy garments, and fas<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed round his waist a worn leather belt. On it he
                hung a short sword in a battered black-leather scabbard. From a locked drawer,
                smelling of moth-balls, he took out an old cloak and hood. They had been locked up
                as if they were very precious, but they were so patched and weatherstained that
                their o<name type="GPE">ri</name>ginal colour could hardly be guessed: it might have been dark green. They
                were rather too large for him. He then went into his study, and from a large
                strong-box took out a bundle wrapped in old cloths, and a leather-bound manusc<name type="GPE">ri</name>pt;
                and also a large bulky envelope. The book and bundle he stuf<name type="ORG">fed</name> into the top of a
                heavy bag that was standing there, already nearly full. Into the envelope he slipped
                his golden <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng, and its fine c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>n, and then sealed it, and addressed it to <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.
                At <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> he put it on the mantelpiece, but suddenly he removed it and stuck it in
                his pocket. At that moment the door opened and <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> came quickly in.</p>
            <p><q>'<name type="ORG">Hullo</name>!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>. <q>'I wondered if you would turn up.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'I am glad to find you visible,'</q> replied the wizard, sitting down in a c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>r,
                    <q>'I <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ted to catch you and have a few final words. I suppose you feel that
                    everything has g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> off splendidly and according to plan?'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Yes, I do,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>. "Though that flash was surp<name type="GPE">ri</name>sing: it quite startled
                me, let al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> the others. A little addition of your own, I suppose?'</p>
            <p>It was. You have wisely kept that <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret all these <name type="DATE">year</name>s, and it seemed to me
                necessary to give your guests something else that would seem to explain your sudden
                vanishment.'</p>
            <p><q>'And would spoil my joke. You are an interfe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng old busybody,'</q> laughed <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>,
                    <q>'but I expect you know best, as usual.'</q></p>
            <p>
                <q>'I do � when I know anything. But I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t feel too sure about this whole affair.
                    It has now come to the final point. You have had your joke, and alarmed or
                    of<name type="PERSON">fen</name>ded most of your relations, and given the whole <name type="LOC">Shire</name> something to talk
                    about for <name type="CARDINAL">nine</name> <name type="DATE">day</name>s, or <name type="CARDINAL">nine</name>ty-<name type="CARDINAL">nine</name> more likely. Are you going any further?'</q>
            </p>
            <p>'Yes, I am. I feel I need <name type="DATE">a holi<name type="DATE">day</name></name>, a very long holi<name type="DATE">day</name>, as I have told you before.
                Probably a permanent holi<name type="DATE">day</name>: I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t expect I shall return. In fact, I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t mean
                to, and I have made all arrangements.</p>
            <p><q>'I am old, <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t look it, but I am beginning to feel it in my heart of
                    hearts. _Well-preserved_ indeed!'</q> he snorted. <q>'Why, I feel all thin, sort
                    of _stretched,_ if you know what I mean: like butter that has been scraped over
                    too much bread. That can't be <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght. I need a change, or something.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> looked cu<name type="GPE">ri</name>ously and closely at him. <q>'No, it does not seem <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght,'</q> he
                said thoughtfully. <q>'No, after all I believe your plan is probably the
                best.'</q></p>
            <p>'Well, I've made up my mind, anyway. I <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t to see mountains again, <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>,
                _mountains,_ and then find somewhere where I can _rest._ In peace and quiet, without
                a lot of relatives prying around, and a st<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng of confounded visitors hanging on the
                bell. I might find somewhere where I can finish my book. I have thought of a nice
                ending for it: _and he lived happily ever after to the end of his <name type="DATE">day</name>s. '_</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> laughed. I hope he will. But nobody will read the book, however it ends.'</p>
            <p>
                <q>'Oh, they may, in <name type="DATE">year</name>s to come. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> has read some already, as far as it has
                    g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. You'll keep an eye on <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, won't you?'</q>
            </p>
            <p>
                <q>'Yes, I will � <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> eyes, as of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> as I can spare them.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>
                <q>'He would come with me, of course, if I asked him. In fact he offered to once,
                    just before the party. But he does not really <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t to, yet. I <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t to see the
                    wild country again before I die, and the <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s; but he is still in love with
                    the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>, with woods and fields and little <name type="GPE">ri</name>vers. He ought to be comfortable
                    here. I am leaving everything to him, of course, except a few oddments. I hope
                    he will be happy, when he gets used to being on his own. It's time he was his
                    own master now.'</q>
            </p>
            <p><q>'Everything?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'The <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng as well? You agreed to that, you
                    remember.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Well, er, yes, I suppose so,'</q> stammered <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>.</p>
            <p>
                <q>'Where is it?'</q>
            </p>
            <p><q>'In an envelope, if you must know,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> impatiently. <q>'There on the
                    mantelpiece. Well, no! Here it is in my pocket!'</q> He hesitated. <q>'Isn't
                    that odd now?'</q> he said softly to himself. <q>'Yet after all, why not? Why
                    shouldn't it stay there?'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> looked again very hard at <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>, and there was a gleam in his eyes. <q>'I
                    think, <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>,'</q> he said quietly, <q>'I should leave it behind. <name type="PERSON">Don</name>'t you <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t
                    to?'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Well yes � and no. Now it comes to it, I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t like parting with it at all, I may
                    say. And I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t really see why I should. Why do you <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t me to?'</q> he asked,
                and a cu<name type="GPE">ri</name>ous change came over his voice. It was sharp with suspicion and annoyance.
                    <q>'You are always badge<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng me about my <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng; but you have never bothered me
                    about the other things that I got on my journey.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'No, but I had to badger you,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'I <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ted the truth. It was
                    imp<name type="GPE">ortan</name>t. Magic <name type="GPE">ri</name>ngs are � well, magical; and they are rare and cu<name type="GPE">ri</name>ous. I was
                    professionally interested in your <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng, you may say; and I still am. I should
                    like to know where it is, if you go <name type="PERSON">wan</name>de<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng again. Also I think _you_have had
                    it quite long enough. You won't need it any more. <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>, unless I am quite
                    mistaken.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> flushed, and there was an angry light in his eyes. His kindly face grew hard.
                    <q>'Why not?'</q> he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed. <q>'And what business is it of yours, anyway, to
                    know what I do with my own things? It is my own. I found it. It came to
                me.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Yes, yes,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'But there is no need to get angry.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'If I am it is your fault,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>. <q>'It is mine, I tell you. My own. My
                    precious. Yes, my precious.'</q></p>
            <p>The wizard's face remained grave and at<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>tive, and only a flicker in his deep eyes
                showed that he was startled and indeed alarmed. <q>'It has been called that
                    before,'</q> he said, <q>'but not by you.'</q></p>
            <p>
                <q>'But I say it now. And why not? Even if <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> said the same once. It's not his
                    now, but mine. And I shall keep it, I say.'</q>
            </p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> stood up. He spoke sternly. <q>'You will be a fool if you do. <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>,'</q> he
                said. <q>'You make that clearer with every word you say. It has got far too much
                    hold on you. Let it go! And then you can go yourself, and be free.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'I'll do as I choose and go as I please,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> obstinately.</p>
            <p>'Now, now, my dear hobbit! ' said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. 'All your long life we have been f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends,
                and you owe me something. Come! Do as you promised: give it up! '</p>
            <p><q>'Well, if you <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t my <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng yourself, say so!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>. <q>'But you won't
                    get it. I won't give my precious away, I tell you.'</q> His hand strayed to the
                hilt of his small sword.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>'s eyes flashed. It will be my turn to get angry soon,<q>' he said. If you say
                    that again, I shall. Then you will see <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> the <name type="ORG">Grey</name> uncloaked.'</q> He took
                a step towards the hobbit, and he seemed to grow tall and menacing; his shadow
                filled the little room.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> backed away to the wall, breathing hard, his hand clut<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g at his pocket. They
                stood for a while facing <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> another, and the air of the room tingled. <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>'s
                eyes remained bent on the hobbit. Slowly his hands relaxed, and he began to
                tremble.</p>
            <p><q>'I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t know what has come over you, <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>,'</q> he said. <q>'You have never
                    been like this before. What is it all about? It is mine isn't it? I found it,
                    and <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> would have killed me, if I hadn't kept it. I'm not a thief, whatever
                    he said.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'I have never called you <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>,'</q> <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> answered. <q>'And I am not <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> either.
                    I am not trying to rob you, but to help you. I wish you would trust me, as you
                    used.'</q> He turned away, and the shadow passed. He seemed to dwindle again to
                an old grey man, bent and troubled.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> drew his hand over his eyes. I am sorry,<q>' he said. 'But I felt so queer. And
                    yet it would be a relief in a way not to be bothered with it any more. It has
                    been so growing on my mind lately. Sometimes I have felt it was like an eye
                    looking at me. And I am always <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ting to put it on and disappear, <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t you
                    know; or wonde<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng if it is safe, and pulling it out to make sure. I t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed
                    locking it up, but I found I couldn't rest without it in my pocket. I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t know
                    why. And I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t seem able to make up my mind.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Then trust mine,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'It is quite made up. Go away and leave it
                    behind. Stop possessing it. Give it to <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, and I will look after
                him.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> stood for a moment <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>se and undecided. Presently he sighed. <q>'All
                    <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght,'</q> he said with an effort. I will.<q>' Then he shrugged his shoulders,
                    and smiled rather ruefully. 'After all that's what this party business was all
                    about, really: to give away lots of birth<name type="DATE">day</name> presents, and somehow make it
                    easier to give it away at the same time. It hasn't made it any easier in the
                    end, but it would be a pity to waste all my preparations. It would quite spoil
                    the joke.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Indeed it would take away the only point I ever saw in the affair,'</q> said
                <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>.</p>
            <p><q>'Very well,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>, <q>'it goes to <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> with all the rest.'</q> He drew
                a deep breath. <q>'And now I really must be starting, or somebody else will catch
                    me. I have said good-bye, and I couldn't bear to do it all over again.'</q> He
                picked up his bag and moved to the door.</p>
            <p><q>'You have still got the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng in your pocket,'</q> said the wizard. <q>'Well, so I
                    have!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>. <q>'And my will and all the other documents too. You had
                    better take it and deliver it for me. That will be safest.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'No, <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t give the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng to me,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'Put it on the mantelpiece.
                    It will be safe enough there, till <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> comes. I shall wait for him.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> took out the envelope, but just as he was about to set it by the clock, his
                hand jerked back, and the packet fell on the floor. Before he could pick it up, the
                wizard stooped and seized it and set it in its place. A spasm of anger passed
                swiftly over the hobbit's face again. Suddenly it gave way to a look of relief and a
                laugh. <q>'Well, that's that,'</q> he said. <q>'Now I'm off!'</q></p>
            <p>They went out into the hall. <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> chose his favou<name type="GPE">ri</name>te stick from the stand; then he
                whistled. <name type="PERSON">Thr</name>ee dwarves came out of different rooms where they had been busy.</p>
            <p><q>'Is everything ready?'</q> asked <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>. <q>'Everything packed and
                labelled?'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Everything,'</q> they answered.</p>
            <p><q>'Well, let's start then!'</q> He stepped out of the front-door.</p>
            <p>It was <name type="TIME">a fine <name type="TIME">night</name></name>, and the black sky was dotted with stars. He looked up, sniffing
                the air. <q>'What fun! What fun to be off again, off on the <name type="FAC">Road</name> with dwarves! This
                    is what I have really been longing for, for <name type="DATE">year</name>s! Good-bye! ' he said, looking
                    at his old home and bowing to the door. 'Good-bye, <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>!'</q></p>
            <p>
                <q>'Good-bye, for the present, <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>. Take care of yourself! You are old enough, and
                    perhaps wise enough.'</q>
            </p>
            <p><q>'Take care! I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t care. <name type="PERSON">Don</name>'t you worry about me! I am as happy now as I have
                    ever been, and that is saying a great deal. But the time has come. I am being
                    swept off my feet at last,'</q> he added, and then in a low voice, as if to
                himself, he sang softly in the dark:</p>
            <p>The <name type="FAC">Road</name> goes ever on and on</p>
            <p>Down from the door where it began.</p>
            <p>Now far ahead the <name type="FAC">Road</name> has g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>,</p>
            <p>And I must follow, if I can,</p>
            <p>Pursuing it with eager feet,</p>
            <p>Until it joins some larger way</p>
            <p>Where many paths and errands meet.</p>
            <p>And whither then? I cannot say.</p>
            <p>He paused, silent for a moment. Then without another word he turned away from the
                lights and voices in the fields and <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ts, and followed by his <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> companions went
                round into his garden, and trotted down the long sloping path. He jumped over a low
                place in the hedge at the bot<name type="PERSON">tom</name>, and took to the meadows, passing into the <name type="TIME">night</name>
                like a rustle of wind in the grass.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> remained for a while sta<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng after him into the darkness. <q>'Goodbye, my
                    dear <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> � until our next meeting!'</q> he said softly and went back
                indoors.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> came in soon afterwards, and found him sitting in the dark, deep in thought.
                    <q>'Has he g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>?'</q> he asked.</p>
            <p><q>'Yes,'</q> answered <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, <q>'he has g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> at last.'</q></p>
            <p><q>' I wish � I mean, I hoped until this <name type="TIME">evening</name> that it was only a joke,'</q> said
                <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'But I knew in my heart that he really meant to go. He always used to joke
                    about se<name type="GPE">ri</name>ous things. I wish I had come back so<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>r, just to see him
                off.'</q></p>
            <p>I think really he preferred slipping off quietly in the end,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. '<name type="PERSON">Don</name>'t
                    be too troubled. He'll be all <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght � now. He left a packet for you. There it
                    is!'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> took the envelope from the mantelpiece, and glanced at it, but did not open
                it.</p>
            <p><q>'You'll find his will and all the other documents in there, I think,'</q> said the
                wizard. <q>'You are the master of <name type="FAC">Bag End</name> now. And also, I fancy, you'll find a
                    golden <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'The <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng!'</q> exclaimed <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'Has he left me that? I wonder why. Still, it
                    may be useful.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'It may, and it may not,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'I should not make use of it, if I
                    were you. But keep it <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret, and keep it safe! Now I am going to bed.'</q></p>
            <p>As master of <name type="FAC">Bag End</name> <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> felt it his painful duty to say good-bye to the guests.
                Rumours of strange events had by now spread all over the field, but <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> would only
                say _no doubt everything will be cleared up in the <name type="TIME">morning</name>_. <name type="TIME">About <name type="TIME">mid<name type="TIME">night</name></name></name>
                car<name type="GPE">ri</name>ages came for the imp<name type="GPE">ortan</name>t folk. <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> by <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> they rolled away, filled with full
                but very unsatisfied hobbits. Gardeners came by arrangement, and removed in
                wheel-barrows those that had inadver<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>tly remained behind.</p>
            <p>Night slowly passed. The sun rose. The hobbits rose rather later. <name type="TIME">Morning</name> went on.
                People came and began (by orders) to clear away the pavilions and the tables and the
                c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>rs, and the spoons and knives and bottles and plates, and the lanterns, and the
                flowe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng shrubs in boxes, and the crumbs and cracker-paper, the forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> bags and
                gloves and handkerchiefs, and the unea<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> food (a very small item). Then a number of
                other people came (without orders): <name type="PERSON">Baggins</name>es, and <name type="PERSON">Boffin</name>s, and <name type="PERSON">Bolger</name>s, and <name type="PERSON">Took</name>s,
                and other guests that lived or were staying near. By mid-<name type="DATE">day</name>, when even the best-<name type="ORG">fed</name>
                were out and about again, there was a large crowd at <name type="FAC">Bag End</name>, uninvited but not
                unexpected.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> was waiting on the step, smiling, but looking rather tired and wor<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed. He
                welcomed all the callers, but he had not much more to say than before. His reply to
                all inqui<name type="GPE">ri</name>es was simply this: <q>'Mr. <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> <name type="PERSON">Baggins</name> has g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> away; as far as I
                    know, for good.'</q> Some of the visitors he invited to come inside, as <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>
                had left 'messages' for them.</p>
            <p>Inside in the hall there was piled a large assortment of packages and parcels and
                small articles of furniture. On every item there was a label tied. There were
                several labels of this sort:</p>
            <p>_For <name type="ORG">ADELARD TOOK</name>, for his VERY OWN, from <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>,_ on an umbrella. <name type="ORG">Adelard</name> had car<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed
                off many unlabelled <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s.</p>
            <p>_For <name type="ORG">DORA</name> BAGGINS in memory of a LONG correspondence, with love from <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>,_ on a
                large waste-paper basket. <name type="PERSON">Dora</name> was <name type="ORG">Drogo</name>'s sister and the eldest surviving female
                relative of <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> and <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>; she was <name type="CARDINAL">nine</name>ty-<name type="CARDINAL">nine</name>, and had w<name type="GPE">ri</name>t<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> reams of good
                advice for more than <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> <name type="DATE">a century</name>.</p>
            <p>_For MILO <name type="WORK_OF_ART">BURROWS</name>, hoping it will be useful, from <name type="PERSON">B.B.</name>,_ on a gold pen and
                ink-bottle. <name type="PERSON">Milo</name> never answered letters.</p>
            <p>_For ANGELICA'S use, from Uncle <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>,_ on a round convex mirror. She was a young
                <name type="PERSON">Baggins</name>, and too obviously considered her face shapely.</p>
            <p>_For the collection of <name type="EVENT">HUGO</name> <name type="ORG">BRACEGIRDLE</name>, from a cont<name type="GPE">ri</name>butor,_ on an (empty)
                book-case. <name type="EVENT">Hugo</name> was a great borrower of books, and worse than usual at returning
                them.</p>
            <p>_For LOBELIA <name type="PERSON">SACKVILLE</name>-BAGGINS, as a PRESENT,_ on a case of silver spoons. <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>
                believed that she had acquired a good many of his spoons, while he was away on his
                former journey. <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>belia knew that quite well. When she ar<name type="GPE">ri</name>ved later in the <name type="DATE">day</name>, she
                took the point at once, but she also took the spoons.</p>
            <p>This is only a small selection of the assembled presents. <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>'s residence had got
                rather cluttered up with things in the course of his long life. It was a <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>dency of
                hobbit-holes to get cluttered up: for which the cus<name type="PERSON">tom</name> of giving so many
                birth<name type="DATE">day</name>-presents was largely responsible. Not, of course, that the
                birth<name type="DATE">day</name>-presents were always _new,_ there were <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> or <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> old _mathoms_ of
                forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> uses that had circulated all around the dist<name type="GPE">ri</name>ct; but <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> had usually
                given new presents, and kept those that he received. The old hole was now being
                cleared a little.</p>
            <p>Every <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the va<name type="GPE">ri</name>ous parting gifts had labels, w<name type="GPE">ri</name>t<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> out personally by <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>,
                and several had some point, or some joke. But, of course, most of the things were
                given where they would be <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ted and welcome. The poorer hobbits, and especially
                those of <name type="ORG">Bagshot Row</name>, did very well. Old <name type="PERSON">Gaffer</name> <name type="PERSON">Gamgee</name> got <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> sacks of potatoes, a
                new spade, a woollen waistcoat, and a bottle of ointment for creaking joints. Old
                <name type="PERSON">Rory</name> <name type="ORG">Brand</name>ybuck, in return for much hospitality, got <name type="CARDINAL">a <name type="CARDINAL">dozen</name></name> bottles of Old
                Winyards: a strong red wine from the <name type="LOC">South</name>farthing, and now quite mature, as it had
                been laid down by <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>'s father. <name type="PERSON">Rory</name> quite forgave <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>, and voted him a capital
                fellow after the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> bottle.</p>
            <p>There was plenty of everything left for <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. And, of course, all the chief
                treasures, as well as the books, pictures, and more than enough furniture, were left
                in his possession. There was, however, no sign nor mention of m<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>y or jewellery:
                not a penny-piece or a glass bead was given away.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> had a very trying time that <name type="TIME">after<name type="TIME">noon</name></name>. A false rumour that the whole household
                was being dist<name type="GPE">ri</name>buted free spread like wildfire; and before long the place was
                packed with people who had no business there, but could not be kept out. Labels got
                torn off and mixed, and quarrels broke out. Some people t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed to do swaps and deals
                in the hall; and others t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed to make _off_ with minor items not addressed to them,
                or with anything that seemed un<name type="PERSON">wan</name>ted or unwatched. The road to the gate was blocked
                with barrows and handcarts.</p>
            <p>In the middle of the commotion the Sackville-<name type="PERSON">Baggins</name>es ar<name type="GPE">ri</name>ved. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> had retired for
                a while and left his f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> <name type="ORG">Brand</name>ybuck to keep an eye on things. When <name type="ORG">Otho</name>
                loudly demanded to see <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> bowed politely.</p>
            <p><q>'He is indisposed,'</q> he said. <q>'He is resting.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Hiding, you mean,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>belia. <q>'Anyway we <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t to see him and we mean to
                    see him. Just go and tell him so!'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Merry</name> left them a long while in the hall, and they had time to discover their parting
                gift of spoons. It did not improve their tempers. Eventually they were shown into
                the study. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> was sitting at a table with a lot of papers in front of him. He
                looked indisposed � to see Sackville-<name type="PERSON">Baggins</name>es at any rate; and he stood up,
                fidgeting with something in his pocket. But he spoke quite politely.</p>
            <p>The Sackville-<name type="PERSON">Baggins</name>es were rather of<name type="PERSON">fen</name>sive. They began by offe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng him bad
                bargain-p<name type="GPE">ri</name>ces (as between f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends) for va<name type="GPE">ri</name>ous valuable and unlabelled things. When
                <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> replied that only the things specially directed by <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> were being given
                away, they said the whole affair was very fishy.</p>
            <p><q>'Only <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> thing is clear to me,'</q> said <name type="ORG">Otho</name>, <q>'and that is that you are doing
                    exceedingly well out of it. I insist on seeing the will.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="ORG">Otho</name> would have been <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>'s heir, but for the adoption of <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. He read the will
                carefully and snorted. It was, unfortunately, very clear and correct (according to
                the legal cus<name type="PERSON">tom</name>s of hobbits, which demand among other things <name type="CARDINAL">seven</name> signatures of
                witnesses in red ink).</p>
            <p><q>'Foiled again!'</q> he said to his wife. <q>'And after waiting _<name type="CARDINAL">six</name>ty_ <name type="DATE">year</name>s.
                    Spoons? Fiddlesticks!'</q> He snapped his fingers under <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s nose and slumped
                off. But <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>belia was not so easily got <name type="GPE">ri</name>d of. A little later <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> came out of the
                study to see how things were going on and found her still about the place,
                investigating nooks and comers and tapping the floors. He escorted her firmly off
                the premises, after he had relieved her of several small (but rather valuable)
                articles that had somehow fallen inside her umbrella. Her face looked as if she was
                in the throes of thinking out a really crushing parting re<name type="PERSON">mar</name>k; but all she found to
                say, turning round on the step, was:</p>
            <p>
                <q>'You'll live to regret it, young fellow! Why didn't you go too? You <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t belong
                    here; you're no <name type="PERSON">Baggins</name> � you � you're a <name type="ORG">Brand</name>ybuck!'</q>
            </p>
            <p><q>'Did you hear that, <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>? That was an insult, if you like,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> as he
                shut the door on her.</p>
            <p><q>'It was a compliment,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> <name type="ORG">Brand</name>ybuck, <q>'and so, of course, not
                    true.'</q></p>
            <p>Then they went round the hole, and evicted <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> young hobbits (<name type="CARDINAL">two</name> <name type="PERSON">Boffin</name>s and a
                <name type="PERSON">Bolger</name>) who were knocking holes in the walls of <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the cellars. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> also had a
                tussle with young <name type="PERSON">Sancho</name> <name type="PERSON">Proudfoot</name> (old <name type="PERSON">Odo <name type="PERSON">Proudfoot</name></name>'s grandson), who had begun an
                excavation in the larger pantry, where he thought there was an echo. The legend of
                <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>'s gold excited both cu<name type="GPE">ri</name>osity and hope; for legendary gold (myste<name type="GPE">ri</name>ously
                obtained, if not positively ill-got<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>), is, as every <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> knows, any <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>'s for the
                finding � unless the search is interrupted.</p>
            <p>When he had overcome <name type="PERSON">Sancho</name> and pushed him out, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> collapsed on a c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>r in the
                hall. It's time to close the shop, <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>,<q>' he said. '<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ck the door, and <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t
                    open it to any<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> to<name type="DATE">day</name>, not even if they b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng a batte<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng ram.'</q> Then he
                went to revive himself with a belated cup of tea.</p>
            <p>He had hardly sat down, when there came a soft knock at the front-door. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>belia
                    again most likely,'</q> he thought. <q>'She must have thought of something
                    really nasty, and have come back again to say it. It can wait.'</q></p>
            <p>He went on with his tea. The knock was repeated, much louder, but he took no notice.
                Suddenly the wizard's head appeared at the window.</p>
            <p><q>'If you <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t let me in, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, I shall blow your door <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght down your hole and
                    out through the hill,'</q> he said.</p>
            <p><q>'My dear <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>! <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>f <name type="TIME">a minute</name>!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, running out of the room to the
                door. <q>'Come in! Come in! I thought it was <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>belia.'</q></p>
            <p>
                <q>'Then I forgive you. But I saw her some time ago, d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ving a pony-trap towards
                    <name type="PERSON">Bywater</name> with a face that would have curdled new milk.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>
                <q>'She had already nearly curdled me. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>nestly, I nearly t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed on <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>'s <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng. I
                    longed to disappear.'</q>
            </p>
            <p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Don</name>'t do that!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, sitting down. <q>'Do be careful of that <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng,
                    <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>! In fact, it is partly about that that I have come to say a last
                    word.'</q></p>
            <p>
                <q>'Well, what about it?'</q>
            </p>
            <p>
                <q>'What do you know already?'</q>
            </p>
            <p>
                <q>'Only what <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> told me. I have heard his story: how he found it, and how he
                    used it: on his journey, I mean.'</q>
            </p>
            <p><q>'Which story, I wonder,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>.</p>
            <p><q>'Oh, not what he told the dwarves and put in his book,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'He
                    told me the true story soon after I came to live here. He said you had pestered
                    him till he told you, so I had better know too. "No <name type="ORG">sec</name>rets between us, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>,"
                    he said; "but they are not to go any further. It's mine anyway."'</q></p>
            <p><q>'That's interesting,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'Well, what did you think of it
                    all?'</q></p>
            <p>
                <q>'If you mean, inventing all that about a "present", well, I thought the true
                    story much more likely, and I couldn't see the point of alte<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng it at all. It
                    was very unlike <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> to do so, anyway; and I thought it rather odd.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>
                <q>'So did I. But odd things may happen to people that have such treasures � if they
                    use them. Let it be a warning to you to be very careful with it. It may have
                    other powers than just making you vanish when you wish to.'</q>
            </p>
            <p><q>'I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t understand,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.</p>
            <p><q>'Neither do I,'</q> answered the wizard. <q>'I have merely begun to wonder about
                    the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng, especially since <name type="TIME">last <name type="TIME">night</name></name>. No need to worry. But if you take my
                    advice you will use it very seldom, or not at all. At least I beg you not to use
                    it in any way that will cause talk or rouse suspicion. I say again: keep it
                    safe, and keep it <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret!'</q></p>
            <p>
                <q>'You are very myste<name type="GPE">ri</name>ous! What are you afraid of?'</q>
            </p>
            <p><q>'I am not certain, so I will say no more. I may be able to tell you something when
                    I come back. I am going off at once: so this is good-bye for the present.'</q>
                He got up.</p>
            <p><q>'At once!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'Why, I thought you were staying on for at least a
                    <name type="DATE">week</name>. I was looking forward to your help.'</q></p>
            <p>
                <q>'I did mean to � but I have had to change my mind. I may be away for a good
                    while; but I'll come and see you again, as soon as I can. Expect me when you see
                    me! I shall slip in quietly. I shan't of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> be visiting the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> openly again.
                    I find that I have become rather unpopular. They say I am a nuisance and a
                    disturber of the peace. Some people are actually accusing me of spi<name type="GPE">ri</name>ting <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>
                    away, or worse. If you <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t to know, there is supposed to be a plot between you
                    and me to get hold of his wealth.'</q>
            </p>
            <p><q>'Some people!'</q> exclaimed <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'You mean <name type="ORG">Otho</name> and <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>belia. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w abominable!
                    I would give them <name type="FAC">Bag End</name> and everything else, if I could get <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> back and go
                    off tramping in the country with him. I love the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>. But I begin to wish,
                    somehow, that I had g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> too. I wonder if I shall ever see him again.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'So do I,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'And I wonder many other things. Good-bye now!
                    Take care of yourself! <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok out for me, especially at unlikely times!
                    Good-bye!'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> saw him to the door. He gave a final wave of his hand, and walked off at a
                surp<name type="GPE">ri</name>sing pace; but <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> thought the old wizard looked unusually bent, almost as
                if he was carrying a great w<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name>. The <name type="TIME">evening</name> was closing in, and his cloaked
                figure quickly vanished into the <name type="TIME">twilight</name>. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> did not see him again for a long
                time.</p>

            <heading>Chapter 2</heading>
            <p>The <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name> of the Past</p>
            <p>The talk did not die down in <name type="CARDINAL">nine</name> or even <name type="CARDINAL">nine</name>ty-<name type="CARDINAL">nine</name> <name type="DATE">day</name>s. The <name type="ORG">sec</name>ond disappearance
                of Mr. <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> <name type="PERSON">Baggins</name> was discussed in <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbiton, and indeed all over the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>, for a
                <name type="DATE">year</name> and <name type="DATE">a <name type="DATE">day</name></name>, and was remembered much longer than that. It became a fireside-story
                for young hobbits; and eventually Mad <name type="PERSON">Baggins</name>, who used to vanish with a bang and a
                flash and reappear with bags of jewels and gold, became a favou<name type="GPE">ri</name>te character of
                legend and lived on long after all the true events were forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>.</p>
            <p>But in the meantime, the general opinion in the neighbourhood was that <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>, who had
                always been rather cracked, had at last g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> quite mad, and had run off into the
                <name type="ORG">Blue</name>. There he had undoubtedly fallen into a pool or a <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver and come to a tragic,
                but hardly an untimely, end. The blame was mostly laid on <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>.</p>
            <p><q>'If only that dratted wizard will leave young <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, perhaps he'll settle
                    down and grow some hobbit-sense,'</q> they said. And to all appearance the
                wizard did leave <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, and he did settle down, but the growth of hobbit-sense
                was not very noticeable. Indeed, he at once began to carry on <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>'s reputation for
                oddity. He refused to go into mourning; and <name type="DATE">the next <name type="DATE">year</name></name> he gave a party in honour
                of <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>'s <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name>-and-twelfth birth<name type="DATE">day</name>, which he called <name type="CARDINAL">Hundred-w<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name> Feast</name>. But
                that was short of the <name type="PERSON">mar</name>k, for <name type="CARDINAL">twenty</name> guests were invited and there were several
                meals at which it snowed food and rained d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk, as hobbits say.</p>
            <p>Some people were rather shocked; but <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> kept up the cus<name type="PERSON">tom</name> of giving <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>'s
                <name type="DATE">Birth<name type="DATE">day</name> <name type="ORG">Party</name></name> <name type="DATE">year</name> after <name type="DATE">year</name> until they got used to it. He said that he did not
                think <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> was dead. When they asked: <q>'Where is he then?'</q> he shrugged his
                shoulders.</p>
            <p>He lived al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, as <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> had <name type="PERSON">don</name>e; but he had a good many f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends, especially among
                the younger hobbits (mostly descendants of the Old <name type="PERSON">Took</name>) who had as children been
                fond of <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> and of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> in and out of <name type="FAC">Bag End</name>. <name type="PERSON">Folco</name> <name type="PERSON">Boffin</name> and <name type="PERSON">Fredegar</name> <name type="PERSON">Bolger</name> were
                <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> of these; but his closest f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends were <name type="PERSON">Pereg<name type="GPE">ri</name>n</name> <name type="PERSON">Took</name> (usually called <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>),
                and <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> <name type="ORG">Brand</name>ybuck (his real name was <name type="PERSON">Me<name type="GPE">ri</name>adoc</name>, but that was seldom remembered).
                <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> went tramping all over the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> with them; but more of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> he <name type="PERSON">wan</name>dered by
                himself, and to the amazement of sensible folk he was sometimes seen far from home
                walking in the hills and woods under the starlight. <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> suspected that
                he visited the <name type="ORG">Elves</name> at times, as <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> had <name type="PERSON">don</name>e.</p>
            <p>As time went on, people began to notice that <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> also showed signs of good
                    <q>'preservation': outwardly he retained the appearance of a robust and
                    energetic hobbit just out of his tweens. 'Some folk have all the luck,'</q> they
                said; but it was not until <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> approached the usually more sober age of <name type="CARDINAL">fifty</name> that
                they began to think it queer.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> himself, after the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> shock, found that being his own master and _the_ Mr.
                <name type="PERSON">Baggins</name> of <name type="FAC">Bag End</name> was rather pleasant. For <name type="DATE">some <name type="DATE">year</name>s</name> he was quite happy and did
                not worry much about the future. But <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> unknown to himself the regret that he had
                not g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> with <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> was steadily growing. He found himself wonde<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng at times,
                especially in the <name type="DATE">autumn</name>, about the wild lands, and strange visions of mountains
                that he had never seen came into his dreams. He began to say to himself: <q>'Perhaps
                    I shall cross the <name type="LOC">River</name> myself <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> <name type="DATE">day</name>.'</q> To which the other <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> of his mind
                always replied: <q>'Not yet.'</q></p>
            <p>So it went on, until his forties were running out, and his <name type="ORDINAL">fiftieth</name> birth<name type="DATE">day</name> was
                drawing near: <name type="CARDINAL">fifty</name> was a number that he felt was somehow significant (or ominous);
                it was at any rate at that age that adventure had suddenly befallen <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>
                began to feel restless, and the old paths seemed too well-trodden. He looked at
                maps, and wondered what lay beyond their edges: maps made in the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> showed mostly
                white spaces beyond its borders. He took to <name type="PERSON">wan</name>de<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng further afield and more of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>
                by himself; and <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> and his other f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends watched him anxiously. Of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> he was seen
                walking and talking with the strange wayfarers that began at this time to appear in
                the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>.</p>
            <p>There were rumours of strange things happening in the world outside; and as <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>
                had not at that time appeared or sent any message for <name type="DATE">several <name type="DATE">year</name>s</name>, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> gathered
                all the news he could. <name type="ORG">Elves</name>, who seldom walked in the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>, could now be seen
                passing westward through the woods in the <name type="TIME">evening</name>, passing and not returning; but
                they were leaving <name type="LOC">Middle-<name type="LOC">earth</name></name> and were no longer concerned with its troubles. There
                were, however, dwarves on the road in unusual numbers. The ancient <name type="LOC">East</name>-<name type="LOC">West</name> <name type="FAC">Road</name>
                ran through the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> to its end at the <name type="ORG">Grey</name> <name type="GPE">Haven</name>s, and dwarves had always used it
                on their way to their mines in the <name type="ORG">Blue</name> <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s. They were the hobbits' chief
                source of news from distant parts � if they <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ted any: as a rule dwarves said
                little and hobbits asked no more. But now <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> met strange dwarves of far
                count<name type="GPE">ri</name>es, seeking refuge in the <name type="LOC">West</name>. They were troubled, and some spoke in
                whispers of the Enemy and of the Land of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>.</p>
            <p>That name the hobbits only knew in legends of the dark past, like a shadow in the
                background of their memo<name type="GPE">ri</name>es; but it was ominous and disquieting. It seemed that the
                evil power in <name type="GPE">Mirkwood</name> had been d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ven out by the White <name type="ORG">Council</name> only to reappear in
                greater strength in the old strongholds of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>. <name type="FAC">The Dark <name type="FAC">Tower</name></name> had been rebuilt,
                it was said. From there the power was spreading far and wide, and away far east and
                south there were wars and growing fear. <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s were multiplying again in the
                mountains. <name type="ORG">Troll</name>s were abroad, no longer dull-witted, but cunning and armed with
                dreadful weapons. And there were murmured hints of creatures more ter<name type="GPE">ri</name>ble than all
                these, but they had no name.</p>
            <p>Little of all this, of course, reached the ears of ordinary hobbits. But even the
                deafest and most stay-at-home began to hear queer tales; and those whose business
                took them to the borders saw strange things. The conversation in _The Green Dragon_
                at <name type="PERSON">Bywater</name>, <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> <name type="TIME">evening</name> in the sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng of <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s <name type="ORDINAL">fiftieth</name> <name type="DATE">year</name>, showed that even in
                the comfortable heart of the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> rumours had been heard, though most hobbits still
                laughed at them.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> <name type="PERSON">Gamgee</name> was sitting in <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> corner near the fire, and opposite him was <name type="PERSON">Ted</name>
                <name type="PERSON">Sandyman</name>, the <name type="ORG">miller</name>'s son; and there were va<name type="GPE">ri</name>ous other rustic hobbits lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing to
                their talk.</p>
            <p><q>'Queer things you do hear these <name type="DATE">day</name>s, to be sure,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>.</p>
            <p><q>'Ah,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Ted</name>, <q>'you do, if you lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>. But I can hear fireside-tales and
                    children's sto<name type="GPE">ri</name>es at home, if I <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t to.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'No doubt you can,'</q> retorted <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, <q>'and I daresay there's more truth in some
                    of them than you reckon. Who invented the sto<name type="GPE">ri</name>es anyway? Take dragons
                now.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'No thank 'ee,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Ted</name>, <q>'I won't. I heard tell of them when I was a
                    youngster, but there's no call to believe in them now. There's only <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> Dragon
                    in <name type="PERSON">Bywater</name>, and that's Green,'</q> he said, getting a general laugh.</p>
            <p><q>'All <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, laughing with the rest. <q>'But what about these
                    <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>-men, these <name type="ORG">giants</name>, as you might call them? They do say that <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> bigger than
                    a tree was seen up away beyond the <name type="LOC">North</name> Moors not long back.'</q></p>
            <p>
                <q>'Who's _they_?'</q>
            </p>
            <p>
                <q>'My cousin <name type="PERSON">Hal</name> for <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. He works for Mr. <name type="PERSON">Boffin</name> at Overhill and goes <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name> the
                    <name type="LOC">North</name>farthing for the hunting. He _saw_ <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>
                <q>'Says he did, perhaps. Your <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>'s always saying he's seen things; and maybe he
                    sees things that ain't there.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>
                <q>'But this <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> was as big as an elm tree, and walking � walking <name type="CARDINAL">seven</name> yards to a
                    st<name type="GPE">ri</name>de, if it was an inch.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>
                <q>'Then I bet it wasn't an inch. What he saw _was_ an elm tree, as like as
                    not.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>
                <q>'But this <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> was _walking,_ I tell you; and there ain't no elm tree on the <name type="LOC">North</name>
                    Moors.'</q>
            </p>
            <p><q>'Then <name type="PERSON">Hal</name> can't have seen <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Ted</name>. There was some laughing and
                clapping: the audience seemed to think that <name type="PERSON">Ted</name> had scored a point.</p>
            <p><q>'All the same,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, 'you can't deny that others besides our <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>fast have
                seen queer folk crossing the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> � crossing it, mind you: there are more that are
                turned back at the borders. The <name type="PERSON">Bounders</name> have never been so busy before.</p>
            <p><q>'And I've heard tell that <name type="ORG">Elves</name> are moving west. They do say they are going to the
                    harbours, out away beyond the White <name type="FAC">Tower</name>s.'</q> <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> waved his arm vaguely:
                neither he nor any of them knew how far it was to the <name type="LOC">Sea</name>, past the old towers
                beyond the western borders of the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>. But it was an old tradition that away over
                there stood the <name type="ORG">Grey</name> <name type="GPE">Haven</name>s, from which at times <name type="ORG">elven</name>-ships set sail, never to
                return.</p>
            <p><q>'They are sailing, sailing, sailing over the <name type="LOC">Sea</name>, they are going into the <name type="LOC">West</name> and
                    leaving us,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> chanting the words, shaking his head sadly and
                solemnly. But <name type="PERSON">Ted</name> laughed.</p>
            <p>
                <q>'Well, that isn't anything new, if you believe the old tales. And I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t see
                    what it matters to me or you. Let them sail! But I warrant you haven't seen them
                    doing it; nor any <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> else in the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>.'</q>
            </p>
            <p><q>'Well I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t know,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> thoughtfully. He believed he had once seen an
                <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name> in the woods, and still hoped to see more <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> <name type="DATE">day</name>. Of all the legends that he
                had heard in his early <name type="DATE">year</name>s such fragments of tales and <name type="CARDINAL">half</name>-remembered sto<name type="GPE">ri</name>es
                about the <name type="ORG">Elves</name> as the hobbits knew, had always moved him most deeply. <q>'There are
                    some, even in these parts, as know the <name type="ORG">Fair</name> Folk and get news of them,'</q> he
                said. <q>'There's Mr. <name type="PERSON">Baggins</name> now, that I work for. He told me that they were
                    sailing and he knows a bit about <name type="ORG">Elves</name>. And old Mr. <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> knew more: many's the
                    talk I had with him when I was a little lad.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Oh, they're both cracked,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Ted</name>. <q>'<name type="PRODUCT">Leastways</name> old <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> was cracked, and
                    <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s cracking. If that's where you get your news from, you'll never <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t for
                    moonshine. Well, f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends, I'm off home. Your good health!'</q> He drained his
                mug and went out noisily.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> sat silent and said no more. He had a good deal to think about. For <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> thing,
                there was a lot to do up in the <name type="FAC">Bag End</name> garden, and he would have a busy <name type="DATE">day</name>
                to<name type="DATE">morrow</name>, if the weather cleared. The grass was growing fast. But <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> had more on
                his mind than gardening. After a while he sighed, and got up and went out.</p>
            <p>It was early <name type="DATE">Ap<name type="GPE">ri</name>l</name> and the sky was now clea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng after heavy rain. The sun was down,
                and a cool pale <name type="TIME">evening</name> was quietly fading into <name type="TIME">night</name>. He walked home under the
                early stars through <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbiton and up the <name type="ORG">Hill</name>, whistling softly and thoughtfully.</p>
            <p>It was just at this time that <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> reappeared after his long absence. For <name type="CARDINAL">three</name>
                <name type="DATE">year</name>s after the <name type="ORG">Party</name> he had been away. Then he paid <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> a b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ef visit, and after
                taking a good look at him he went off again. Du<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng <name type="DATE">the next <name type="DATE">year</name></name> or <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> he had
                turned up fairly of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>, coming unexpectedly after <name type="TIME">dusk</name>, and going off without
                warning before sun<name type="GPE">ri</name>se. He would not discuss his own business and journeys, and
                seemed chiefly interested in small news about <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s health and doings.</p>
            <p>Then suddenly his visits had ceased. It was over <name type="CARDINAL">nine</name> <name type="DATE">year</name>s since <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> had seen or
                heard of him, and he had begun to think that the wizard would never return and had
                given up all interest in hobbits. But that <name type="TIME">evening</name>, as <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> was walking home and
                <name type="TIME">twilight</name> was fading, there came the once familiar tap on the study window.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> welcomed his old f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end with surp<name type="GPE">ri</name>se and great delight. They looked hard at
                <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> another.</p>
            <p><q>'Ah well eh?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'You look the same as ever, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>!'</q></p>
            <p><q>'So do you,'</q> <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> replied; but <name type="ORG">sec</name>retly he thought that <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> looked older
                and more careworn. He pressed him for news of himself and of the wide world, and
                soon they were deep in talk, and they stayed up far into the <name type="TIME">night</name>.</p>
            <p><name type="TIME">Next <name type="TIME">morning</name></name> after a late breakfast, the wizard was sitting with <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> by the open
                window of the study. A b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght fire was on the h<name type="LOC">earth</name>, but the sun was warm, and the
                wind was in the <name type="LOC">South</name>. Everything looked fresh, and the new green of <name type="DATE">Sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng</name> was
                shimme<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng in the fields and on the tips of the trees' fingers.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> was thinking of a sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng, nearly <name type="CARDINAL">eight</name>y <name type="DATE">year</name>s before, when <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> had run out
                of <name type="FAC">Bag End</name> without a handkerchief. His <name type="PERSON">hai</name>r was perhaps whiter than it had been
                then, and his beard and eyebrows were perhaps longer, and his face more lined with
                care and wisdom; but his eyes were as b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght as ever, and he smoked and blew
                smoke-<name type="GPE">ri</name>ngs with the same vigour and delight.</p>
            <p>He was smoking now in silence, for <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> was sitting still, deep in thought. Even in
                the light of <name type="TIME">morning</name> he felt the dark shadow of the tidings that <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> had
                brought. At last he broke the silence.</p>
            <p><q>'<name type="TIME">Last <name type="TIME">night</name></name> you began to tell me strange things about my <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng, <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>,'</q> he
                said. <q>'And then you stopped, because you said that such matters were best left
                    until <name type="DATE">day</name>light. <name type="PERSON">Don</name>'t you think you had better finish now? You say the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng is
                    dangerous, far more dangerous than I guess. In what way?'</q></p>
            <p><q>'In many ways,'</q> answered the wizard. It is far more powerful than I ever dared
                to think at <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>, so powerful that in the end it would utterly overcome any<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of
                mortal race who possessed it. It would possess him.</p>
            <p>'In <name type="ORG">Eregion</name> <name type="DATE">long ago</name> many <name type="ORG">Elven</name>-<name type="GPE">ri</name>ngs were made, magic <name type="GPE">ri</name>ngs as you call them, and
                they were, of course, of va<name type="GPE">ri</name>ous kinds: some more po<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>t and some less. The lesser
                <name type="GPE">ri</name>ngs were only essays in the craft before it was full-grown, and to the
                <name type="ORG">Elven</name>-smiths they were but t<name type="GPE">ri</name>fles � yet still to my mind dangerous for mortals. But
                the Great <name type="ORG">Ring</name>s, the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>s of <name type="ORG">Power</name>, they were pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>lous.</p>
            <p>
                <q>'A mortal, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, who keeps <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the Great <name type="ORG">Ring</name>s, does not die, but he does not
                    grow or obtain more life, he merely continues, until at <name type="TIME">last every minute</name> is a
                    wea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ness. And if he of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> uses the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> to make himself invisible, he_ fades:_
                    he becomes in the end invisible permanently, and walks in the <name type="TIME">twilight</name> under the
                    eye of the dark power that rules the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>s. Yes, so<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>r or later � later, if he
                    is strong or well-meaning to begin with, but neither strength nor good purpose
                    will last � so<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>r or later the dark power will devour him.'</q>
            </p>
            <p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w ter<name type="GPE">ri</name>fying!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. There was another long silence. The sound of <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>
                <name type="PERSON">Gamgee</name> cutting the lawn came in from the garden.</p>
            <p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w long have you known this?'</q> asked <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> at length. <q>'And how much did
                    <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> know?'</q></p>
            <p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> knew no more than he told you, I am sure,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'He would
                    certainly never have passed on to you anything that he thought would be a
                    danger, even though I promised to look after you. He thought the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng was very
                    beautiful, and very useful at need; and if anything was wrong or queer, it was
                    himself. He said that it was "growing on his mind", and he was always worrying
                    about it; but he did not suspect that the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng itself was to blame. Though he
                    had found out that the thing needed looking after; it did not seem always of the
                    same size or w<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name>; it shrank or expanded in an odd way, and might suddenly
                    slip off a finger where it had been tight.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Yes, he warned me of that in his last letter,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, <q>'so I have
                    always kept it on its c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>n.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Very wise,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'But as for his long life, <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> never connected
                    it with the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng at all. He took all the credit for that to himself, and he was
                    very proud of it. Though he was getting restless and uneasy. _Thin and
                    stretched_ he said. A sign that the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng was getting control.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w long have you known all this?'</q> asked <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> again.</p>
            <p><q>'Known?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. 'I have known much that only the <name type="PERSON">Wise</name> know, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. But
                if you mean "known about _this_ <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng", well, I still do not _know,_<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> might say.
                There is a last test to make. But I no longer doubt my guess.</p>
            <p><q>'When did I <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> begin to guess?'</q> he mused, sear<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g back in memory. <q>'Let
                    me see � it was in <name type="DATE">the <name type="DATE">year</name></name> that the White <name type="ORG">Council</name> drove the dark power from
                    <name type="GPE">Mirkwood</name>, just before the <name type="EVENT">Battle</name> of <name type="CARDINAL">Five</name> Armies, that <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> found his <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng. A
                    shadow fell on my heart then, though I did not know yet what I feared. I
                    wondered of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> how <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> came by a Great <name type="ORG">Ring</name>, as plainly it was � that at
                    least was clear from the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>. Then I heard <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>'s strange story of how he had
                    "won" it, and I could not believe it. When I at last got the truth out of him, I
                    saw at once that he had been trying to put his claim to the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng beyond doubt.
                    Much like <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> with his "birth<name type="DATE">day</name> present". The lies were too much alike for
                    my comfort. Clearly the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng had an unwholesome power that set to work on its
                    keeper at once. That was the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> real warning I had that all was not well. I
                    told <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> that such <name type="GPE">ri</name>ngs were better left unused; but he resented it,
                    and soon got angry. There was little else that I could do. I could not take it
                    from him without doing greater harm; and I had no <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght to do so anyway. I could
                    only watch and wait. I might perhaps have consulted <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> the White, but
                    something always held me back.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Who is he?'</q> asked <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. I have never heard of him before.'</p>
            <p><q>'<name type="DATE">May</name>be not,'</q> answered <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. '<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbits are, or were, no concern of his. Yet
                he is great among the <name type="PERSON">Wise</name>. He is the chief of my order and the head of the <name type="ORG">Council</name>.
                His knowledge is deep, but his p<name type="GPE">ri</name>de has grown with it, and he takes ill any
                meddling. The lore of the <name type="ORG">Elven</name>-<name type="GPE">ri</name>ngs, great and small, is his province. He has long
                studied it, seeking the lost <name type="ORG">sec</name>rets of their making; but when the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>s were
                debated in the <name type="ORG">Council</name>, all that he would reveal to us of his <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng-lore told against
                my fears. So my doubt slept � but uneasily. Still I watched and I waited.</p>
            <p>'And all seemed well with <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>. And <name type="DATE">the <name type="DATE">year</name></name>s passed. Yes, they passed, and they
                seemed not to touch him. He showed no signs of age. The shadow fell on me again. But
                I said to myself: "After all he comes of a long-lived family on his mother's side.
                There is time yet. Wait!"</p>
            <p>
                <q>'And I waited. Until that <name type="TIME">night</name> when he left this house. He said and did things
                    then that filled me with a fear that no words of <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> could allay. I knew at
                    last that something dark and deadly was at work. And I have spent most of the
                    <name type="DATE">year</name>s since then in finding out the truth of it.'</q>
            </p>
            <p><q>'There wasn't any permanent harm <name type="PERSON">don</name>e, was there?'</q> asked <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> anxiously.
                    <q>'He would get all <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght in time, wouldn't he? Be able to rest in peace, I
                    mean?'</q></p>
            <p><q>'He felt better at once,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. 'But there is only <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> <name type="ORG">Power</name> in this
                world that knows all about the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>s and their effects; and as far as I know there
                is no <name type="ORG">Power</name> in the world that knows all about hobbits. Among the <name type="PERSON">Wise</name> I am the only
                <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> that goes in for hobbit-lore: an obscure branch of knowledge, but full of
                surp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ses. Soft as butter they can be, and yet sometimes as tough as old tree-roots.
                I think it likely that some would resist the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>s far longer than most of the <name type="PERSON">Wise</name>
                would believe. I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t think you need worry about <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>.</p>
            <p>'Of course, he possessed the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng for <name type="DATE">many <name type="DATE">year</name>s</name>, and used it, so it might take a
                long while for the influence to wear off � before it was safe for him to see it
                again, for instance. Otherwise, he might live on for <name type="DATE">year</name>s, quite happily: just stop
                as he was when he parted with it. For he gave it up in the end of his own accord: an
                imp<name type="GPE">ortan</name>t point. No, I was not troubled about dear <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> any more, once he had let
                the thing go. It is for _you_ that I feel responsible.</p>
            <p>
                <q>'Ever since <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> left I have been deeply concerned about you, and about all
                    these charming, absurd, helpless hobbits. It would be a g<name type="GPE">ri</name>evous blow to the
                    world, if the Dark <name type="ORG">Power</name> overcame the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>; if all your kind, jolly, stupid
                    <name type="PERSON">Bolger</name>s, <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>rnblowers, <name type="PERSON">Boffin</name>s, <name type="PERSON">Bracegirdle</name>s, and the rest, not to mention the
                    <name type="GPE">ri</name>diculous <name type="PERSON">Baggins</name>es, became enslaved.'</q>
            </p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> shuddered. <q>'But why should we be?'</q> he asked. <q>'And why should he <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t
                    such slaves?'</q></p>
            <p><q>'To tell you the truth,'</q> replied <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, <q>'I believe that hitherto �
                    _hitherto,_<name type="PERSON">mar</name>k you � he has entirely overlooked the exis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ce of hobbits. You
                    should be thankful. But your safety has passed. He does not need you � he has
                    many more useful servants � but he won't forget you again. And hobbits as
                    miserable slaves would please him far more than hobbits happy and free. There is
                    such a thing as malice and revenge.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Revenge?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'Revenge for what? I still <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t understand what all
                    this has to do with <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> and myself, and our <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'It has everything to do with it,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'You do not know the real
                    pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>l yet; but you shall. I was not sure of it myself when I was last here; but
                    the time has come to speak. Give me the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng for a moment.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> took it from his breeches-pocket, where it was clasped to a c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>n that hung
                from his belt. He unfas<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed it and handed it slowly to the wizard. It felt suddenly
                very heavy, as if either it or <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> himself was in some way reluctant for <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>
                to touch it.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> held it up. It looked to be made of pure and solid gold. <q>'Can you see any
                    <name type="PERSON">mar</name>kings on it?'</q> he asked.</p>
            <p><q>'No,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'There are n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. It is quite plain, and it never shows a
                    scratch or sign of wear.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Well then, look!'</q> To <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s astonishment and distress the wizard threw it
                suddenly into the middle of a glowing corner of the fire. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> gave a cry and
                groped for the tongs; but <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> held him back.</p>
            <p><q>'Wait!'</q> he said in a commanding voice, giving <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> a quick look from under
                his b<name type="GPE">ri</name>stling brows.</p>
            <p>No apparent change came over the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng. After a while <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> got up, closed the
                shutters outside the window, and drew the curtains. The room became dark and silent,
                though the clack of <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>'s shears, now nearer to the windows, could still be heard
                faintly from the garden. For a moment the wizard stood looking at the fire; then he
                stooped and removed the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng to the h<name type="LOC">earth</name> with the tongs, and at once picked it up.
                <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> gasped.</p>
            <p>It is quite cool,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. 'Take it!'</q> <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> received it on his sh<name type="GPE">ri</name>nking
                palm: it seemed to have become thicker and heavier than ever.</p>
            <p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>ld it up!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'And look closely!'</q></p>
            <p>As <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> did so, he now saw fine lines, finer than the finest pen-strokes, running
                along the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng, outside and inside: lines of fire that seemed to form the letters of
                a flowing sc<name type="GPE">ri</name>pt. They sh<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> piercingly b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght, and yet remote, as if out of a great
                depth.</p>
            <p><q>'I cannot read the fiery letters,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> in a quave<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng voice.</p>
            <p><q>'No,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, 'but I can. The letters are <name type="PERSON">Elvish</name>, of an ancient mode,
                but the language is that of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>, which I will not utter here. But this in the
                Common Tongue is what is said, close enough:</p>
            <p>_<name type="CARDINAL">One</name> <name type="ORG">Ring</name> to rule them all, <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> <name type="ORG">Ring</name> to find them,</p>
            <p><name type="CARDINAL">One</name> <name type="ORG">Ring</name> to b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng them all and in the darkness bind them._</p>
            <p>It is <name type="CARDINAL">only <name type="CARDINAL">two</name></name> lines of a verse long known in <name type="ORG">Elven</name>-lore:</p>
            <p>_<name type="PERSON">Thr</name>ee <name type="ORG">Ring</name>s for the <name type="ORG">Elven</name>-kings under the sky,</p>

            <p><name type="CARDINAL">Nine</name> for Mortal <name type="ORG">Men</name> doomed to die,</p>
            <p><name type="CARDINAL">One</name> for the Dark <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd on his dark thr<name type="CARDINAL">one</name></p>
            <p>In the Land of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> where the <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>s lie.</p>
            <p><name type="CARDINAL">One</name> <name type="ORG">Ring</name> to rule them all. <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> <name type="ORG">Ring</name> to find them,</p>

            <p>In the Land of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> where the <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>s lie.'_</p>
            <p>He paused, and then said slowly in a deep voice: <q>'This is the Master-<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng, the <name type="CARDINAL">One</name>
                    <name type="ORG">Ring</name> to rule them all. This is the <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> <name type="ORG">Ring</name> that he lost many <name type="DATE">ages ago</name>, to the
                    great weakening of his power. He greatly desires it � but he must _not_ get
                    it.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> sat silent and motionless. Fear seemed to stretch out a vast hand, like a dark
                cloud <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing in the <name type="LOC">East</name> and looming <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name> en<name type="LOC">gulf</name> him. <q>'This <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng!'</q> he
                stammered. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w, how on <name type="LOC">earth</name> did it come to me?'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Ah!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. 'That is a very long story. The beginnings lie back in the
                <name type="ORG">Black</name> Years, which only the lore-masters now remember. If I were to tell you all
                that tale, we should still be sitting here when <name type="DATE">Sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng</name> had passed into <name type="DATE">Winter</name>.</p>
            <p>
                <q>'But <name type="TIME">last <name type="TIME">night</name></name> I told you of <name type="ORG">Sauron</name> the Great, the Dark <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd. The rumours that
                    you have heard are true: he has indeed a<name type="GPE">ri</name>sen again and left his hold in
                    <name type="GPE">Mirkwood</name> and returned to his ancient fastness in the Dark <name type="FAC">Tower</name> of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>. That
                    name even you hobbits have heard of, like a shadow on the borders of old
                    sto<name type="GPE">ri</name>es. Always after a defeat and a respite, the <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name> takes another shape and
                    grows again.'</q>
            </p>
            <p><q>'I wish it need not have happened in my time,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.</p>
            <p><q>'So do I,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, 'and so do all who live to see such times. But that
                is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is
                given, us. And already, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, our time is beginning to look black. The Enemy is
                fast becoming very strong. His plans are far from <name type="GPE">ri</name>pe, I think, but they are
                <name type="GPE">ri</name>pening. We shall be hard put to it. We should be very hard put to it, even if it
                were not for this dreadful chance.</p>
            <p>'The Enemy still lacks <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> thing to give him strength and knowledge to beat down all
                resistance, break the last de<name type="PERSON">fen</name>ces, and cover all the lands in a <name type="ORG">sec</name>ond darkness.
                He lacks the <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> <name type="ORG">Ring</name>.</p>
            <p>'The <name type="PERSON">Thr</name>ee, fairest of all, the <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name>-lords hid from him, and his hand never touched
                them or sullied them. <name type="CARDINAL">Seven</name> the <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Dwarf</name>-kings possessed, but <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> he has recovered,
                and the others the dragons have consumed. <name type="CARDINAL">Nine</name> he gave to Mortal <name type="ORG">Men</name>, proud and
                great, and so ensnared them. <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ng ago they fell under the dominion of the <name type="CARDINAL">One</name>, and
                they became <name type="ORG">Ring</name>wraiths, shadows under his great <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>, his most ter<name type="GPE">ri</name>ble servants.
                <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ng ago. It is many <name type="DATE">a <name type="DATE">year</name></name> since the <name type="CARDINAL">Nine</name> walked abroad. Yet who knows? As the
                <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name> grows once more, they too may walk again. But come! We will not speak of such
                things even in the <name type="TIME">morning</name> of the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>.</p>
            <p>'So it is now: the <name type="CARDINAL">Nine</name> he has gathered to himself; the <name type="CARDINAL">Seven</name> also, or else they are
                destroyed. The <name type="PERSON">Thr</name>ee are hidden still. But that no longer troubles him. He only
                needs the <name type="CARDINAL">One</name>; for he made that <name type="ORG">Ring</name> himself, it is his, and he let a great part of
                his own former power pass into it, so that he could rule all the others. If he
                recovers it, then he will command them all again, wherever they be, even the <name type="PERSON">Thr</name>ee,
                and all that has been wrought with them will be laid bare, and he will be stronger
                than ever.</p>
            <p>
                <q>'And this is the dreadful chance, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. He believed that the <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> had pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>shed;
                    that the <name type="ORG">Elves</name> had destroyed it, as should have been <name type="PERSON">don</name>e. But he knows now that
                    it has _not_ pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>shed, that it has been found. So he is seeking it, seeking it,
                    and all his thought is bent on it. It is his great hope and our great fear.'</q>
            </p>
            <p><q>'Why, why wasn't it destroyed?'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'And how did the Enemy ever
                    come to lose it, if he was so strong, and it was so precious to him?'</q> He
                clutched the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> in his hand, as if he saw already dark fingers stret<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g out to
                seize it.</p>
            <p><q>'It was taken from him,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. 'The strength of the <name type="ORG">Elves</name> to resist
                him was greater <name type="DATE">long ago</name>; and not all <name type="ORG">Men</name> were estranged from them. The <name type="ORG">Men</name> of
                <name type="LOC">West</name>ernesse came to their aid. That is a chapter of ancient history which it might
                be good to recall; for there was sorrow then too, and gathe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng dark, but great
                valour, and great deeds that were not wholly vain. <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> <name type="DATE">day</name>, perhaps, I will tell you
                all the tale, or you shall hear it told in full by <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> who knows it best.</p>
            <p>'But for the moment, since most of all you need to know how this thing came to you,
                and that will be tale enough, this is all that I will say. It was <name type="PERSON">Gil-galad</name>,
                <name type="ORG">Elven</name>-king and <name type="PERSON">Elen</name>dil of <name type="LOC">West</name>ernesse who overthrew <name type="ORG">Sauron</name>, though they themselves
                pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>shed in the deed; and <name type="ORG">Isildur</name> <name type="PERSON">Elen</name>dil's son cut the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> from <name type="ORG">Sauron</name>'s hand and
                took it for his own. Then <name type="ORG">Sauron</name> was vanquished and his spi<name type="GPE">ri</name>t fled and was hidden
                for <name type="DATE">long <name type="DATE">year</name>s</name>, until his shadow took shape again in <name type="GPE">Mirkwood</name>.</p>
            <p>
                <q>'But the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> was lost. It fell into the <name type="LOC">Great <name type="LOC">River</name></name>, <name type="GPE">Anduin</name>, and vanished. For
                    <name type="ORG">Isildur</name> was <name type="PERSON">mar</name><name type="PERSON">chin</name>g north along <name type="GPE">the east bank</name>s of the <name type="LOC">River</name>, and near the

                    folk were slain. He leaped into the waters, but the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> slipped from his finger
                    as he swam, and then the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s saw him and killed him with arrows.'</q>
            </p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> paused. <q>'And there in the dark pools amid the <name type="PERSON">Gladden Fields</name>,'</q> he
                said, 'the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> passed out of knowledge and legend; and even so much of its history
                is known now only to a few, and the <name type="ORG">Council</name> of the <name type="PERSON">Wise</name> could discover no more. But
                at last I can carry on the story, I think.</p>
            <p>'<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ng after, but still very <name type="DATE">long ago</name>, there lived by the banks of the <name type="LOC">Great <name type="LOC">River</name></name> on
                the edge of <name type="PERSON">Wilderland</name> a clever-handed and quiet-footed little people. I guess they
                were of hobbit-kind; akin to the fathers of the fathers of the <name type="ORG">Stoors</name>, for they
                loved the <name type="LOC">River</name>, and of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> swam in it, or made little boats of reeds. There was
                among them a family of high repute, for it was large and wealthier than most, and it
                was ruled by a grandmother of the folk, stern and wise in old lore, such as they
                had. The most inquisitive and cu<name type="GPE">ri</name>ous-minded of that family was called Sm�agol. He
                was interested in roots and beginnings; he dived into deep pools; he burrowed under
                trees and growing plants; he tunnelled into green mounds; and he ceased to look up
                at the hill-tops, or the leaves on trees, or the flowers opening in the air: his
                head and his eyes were downward.</p>
            <p>'He had a f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end called D�agol, of similar sort, sharper-eyed but not so quick and
                strong. On a time they took a boat and went down to the <name type="PERSON">Gladden Fields</name>, where there
                were great beds of i<name type="GPE">ri</name>s and flowe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng reeds. There Sm�agol got out and went nosing
                about the banks but Deal sat in the boat and fished. Suddenly a great fish took his
                hook, and before he knew where he was, he was dragged out and down into the water,
                to the bot<name type="PERSON">tom</name>. Then he let go of his line, for he thought he saw something shining
                in the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver-bed; and holding his breath he grabbed at it.</p>
            <p>'Then up he came splutte<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng, with weeds in his <name type="PERSON">hai</name>r and a handful of mud; and he
                swam to the bank. And behold! when he washed the mud away, there in his hand lay a
                beautiful golden <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng; and it sh<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> and glittered in the sun, so that his heart was
                glad. But Sm�agol had been wat<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g him from behind a tree, and as Deal gloated over
                the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng, Sm�agol came softly up behind.</p>
            <p>'"Give us that, Deal, my love," said Sm�agol, over his f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end's shoulder.</p>
            <p>'"Why?" said Deal.</p>
            <p>' "Because it's my birth<name type="DATE">day</name>, my love, and I <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ts it," said Sm�agol.</p>
            <p>'"I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t care," said Deal. "I have given you a present already, more than I could
                af<name type="ORG">ford</name>. I found this, and I'm going to keep it."</p>
            <p>' "Oh, are you indeed, my love," said Sm�agol; and he caught Deal by the throat and
                strangled him, because the gold looked so b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght and beautiful. Then he put the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng
                on his finger.</p>
            <p>'No <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> ever found out what had become of Deal; he was murdered far from home, and
                his body was cunningly hidden. But Sm�agol returned al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>; and he found that n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of
                his family could see him, when he was wea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng. He was very pleased with his
                discovery and he concealed it; and he used it to find out <name type="ORG">sec</name>rets, and he put his
                knowledge to crooked and malicious uses. He became sharp-eyed and keen-eared for all
                that was hurtful. The <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng had given him power according to his stature. It is not
                to be wondered at that he became very unpopular and was shunned (when visible) by
                all his relations. They kicked him, and he bit their feet. He took to thieving, and
                going about mutte<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng to himself, and gurgling in his throat. So they called him
                _<name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>,_ and cursed him, and told him to go far away; and his grandmother, desi<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng
                peace, expelled him from the family and turned him out of her hole.</p>
            <p>'He <name type="PERSON">wan</name>dered in l<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>liness, weeping a little for the hardness of the world, and he
                journeyed up the <name type="LOC">River</name>, till he came to a stream that flowed down from the
                mountains, and he went that way. He caught fish in deep pools with invisible fingers
                and ate them raw. <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> <name type="DATE">day</name> it was very hot, and as he was bending over a pool, he
                felt a burning on the back of his head) and a dazzling light from the water pained
                his wet eyes. He wondered at it, for he had almost forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> about the <name type="ORG">Sun</name>. Then for
                the last time he looked up and shook his fist at her.</p>
            <p>'But as he lowered his eyes, he saw far above the tops of the <name type="LOC">Misty <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s</name>, out of
                which the stream came. And he thought suddenly: "It would be cool and shady under
                those mountains. The <name type="ORG">Sun</name> could not watch me there. The roots of those mountains must
                be roots indeed; there must be great <name type="ORG">sec</name>rets bu<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed there which have not been
                discovered since the beginning."</p>
            <p>
                <q>'So he journeyed by <name type="TIME">night</name> up into the highlands, and he found a little cave out
                    of which the dark stream ran; and he wormed his way like a maggot into the heart
                    of the hills, and vanished out of all knowledge. The <name type="ORG">Ring</name> went into the shadows
                    with him, and even the maker, when his power had begun to grow again, could
                    learn nothing of it.'</q>
            </p>
            <p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>? Do you mean that this is the very
                    <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>-creature that <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> met? <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w loathsome!'</q></p>
            <p><q>'I think it is a sad story,'</q> said the wizard, <q>'and it might have happened
                    to others, even to some hobbits that I have known.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'I can't believe that <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> was connected with hobbits, however distantly,'</q>
                said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> with some heat. <q>'What an abominable notion!'</q></p>
            <p><q>'It is true all the same,'</q> replied <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'About their o<name type="GPE">ri</name>gins, at any
                    rate, I know more than hobbits do themselves. And even <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>'s story suggests
                    the kinship. There was a great deal in the background of their minds and
                    memo<name type="GPE">ri</name>es that was very similar. They understood <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> another re<name type="PERSON">mar</name>kably well,
                    very much better than a hobbit would understand, say, a <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Dwarf</name>, or an <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>, or
                    even an <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name>. Think of the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ddles they both knew, for <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> thing.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Yes,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'Though other folks besides hobbits ask <name type="GPE">ri</name>ddles, and of
                    much the same sort. And hobbits <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t cheat. <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> meant to cheat all the time.
                    He was just trying to put poor <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> off his guard. And I daresay it amused his
                    wickedness to start a game which might end in providing him with an easy victim,
                    but if he lost would not hurt him.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Only too true, I fear,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. 'But there was something else in it, I
                think, which you <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t see yet. Even <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> was not wholly ruined. He had proved
                tougher than even <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the <name type="PERSON">Wise</name> would have guessed -as a hobbit might. There was a
                little corner of his mind that was still his own, and light came through it, as
                through a <name type="PERSON">chin</name>k in the dark: light out of the past. It was actually pleasant, I
                think, to hear a kindly voice again, b<name type="GPE">ri</name>nging up memo<name type="GPE">ri</name>es of wind, and trees, and
                sun on the grass, and such forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> things.</p>
            <p><q>'But that, of course, would only make the evil part of him ang<name type="GPE">ri</name>er in the end �
                    unless it could be conquered. Unless it could be cured.'</q> <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> sighed.
                '<name type="PERSON">Alas</name>! there is little hope of that for him. Yet not no hope. No, not though he
                possessed the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> so long, almost as far back as he can remember. For it was long
                since he had worn it much: in the black darkness it was seldom needed. Certainly he
                had never "faded". He is thin and tough still. But the thing was eating up his mind,
                of course, and the torment had become almost unbearable.</p>
            <p>
                <q>'All the "great <name type="ORG">sec</name>rets" under the mountains had turned out to be just empty
                    <name type="TIME">night</name>: there was nothing more to find out, nothing worth doing, only nasty
                    furtive eating and resentful remembe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng. He was altogether wretched. He hated
                    the dark, and he hated light more: he hated everything, and the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> most of
                    all.'</q>
            </p>
            <p><q>'What do you mean?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'Surely the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> was his precious and the
                    only thing he cared for? But if he hated it, why didn't he get <name type="GPE">ri</name>d of it, or go
                    away and leave it?'</q></p>
            <p><q>'You ought to begin to understand, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, after all you have heard,'</q> said
                <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. 'He hated it and loved it, as he hated and loved himself. He could not get
                <name type="GPE">ri</name>d of it. He had no will left in the matter.</p>
            <p><q>'A <name type="ORG">Ring</name> of <name type="ORG">Power</name> looks after itself, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. _It_ may slip off treacherously, but
                    its keeper never aban<name type="PERSON">don</name>s it. At most he plays with the idea of handing it on to
                    some<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> else's care � and that only at an early stage, when it <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> begins to
                    g<name type="GPE">ri</name>p. But as far as I know <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> in history has ever g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> beyond playing,
                    and really <name type="PERSON">don</name>e it. He needed all my help, too. And even so he would never have
                    just forsaken it, or cast it aside. It was not <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, but the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>
                    itself that decided things. The <name type="ORG">Ring</name> left _him.'</q>_</p>
            <p><q>'What, just in time to meet <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'Wouldn't an <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name> have
                    suited it better?'</q></p>
            <p><q>'It is no laughing matter,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. 'Not for you. It was the strangest
                event in the whole history of the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> so far: <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>'s ar<name type="GPE">ri</name>val just at that time,
                and putting his hand on it, blindly, in the dark.</p>
            <p>'There was <name type="CARDINAL">more than <name type="CARDINAL">one</name></name> power at work, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. The <name type="ORG">Ring</name> was trying to get back to its
                master. It had slipped from <name type="ORG">Isildur</name>'s hand and betrayed him; then when a chance came
                it caught poor Deal, and he was murdered; and after that <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>, and it had devoured
                him. It could make no further use of him: he was too small and mean; and as long as
                it stayed with him he would never leave his deep pool again. So now, when its master
                was awake once more and sending out his dark thought from <name type="GPE">Mirkwood</name>, it aban<name type="PERSON">don</name>ed
                <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>. Only to be picked up by the most unlikely person imaginable: <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> from the

            <p>
                <q>'Behind that there was something else at work, beyond any design of the
                    <name type="ORG">Ring</name>-maker. I can put it no plainer than by saying that <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> was _meant_to find
                    the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>, and _not_ by its maker. In which case you also were _meant_to have it.
                    And that maybe an encouraging thought.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>It is not,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. "Though I am not sure that I understand you. But how have
                    you learned all this about the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>, and about <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>? Do you really know it
                    all, or are you just guessing still?'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> looked at <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, and his eyes glinted. I knew much and I have learned
                    much,<q>' he answered. 'But I am not going to give an account of all my doings
                    to _you._ The history of <name type="PERSON">Elen</name>dil and <name type="ORG">Isildur</name> and the <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> <name type="ORG">Ring</name> is known to all
                    the <name type="PERSON">Wise</name>. Your <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng is shown to be that <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> <name type="ORG">Ring</name> by the fire-w<name type="GPE">ri</name>ting al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>,
                    apart from any other evidence.'</q>
                <q>'And when did you discover that?'</q> asked <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, interrupting. <q>'Just now in
                    this room, of course,'</q> answered the wizard sharply. <q>'But I expected to
                    find it. I have come back from dark journeys and long search to make that final
                    test. It is the last proof, and all is now only too clear. Making out <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>'s
                    part, and fitting it into the gap in the history, required some thought. I may
                    have started with guesses about <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>, but I am not guessing now. I know. I
                    have seen him.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'You have seen <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>?'</q> exclaimed <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> in amazement.</p>
            <p>
                <q>'Yes. The obvious thing to do, of course, if <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> could. I t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="DATE">long ago</name>; but I
                    have managed it at last.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>
                <q>'Then what happened after <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> escaped from him? Do you know that?'</q>
            </p>
            <p>'Not so clearly. What I have told you is what <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> was willing to tell � though
                not, of course, in the way I have reported it. <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> is a liar, and you have to
                sift his words. For instance, he called the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> his "birth<name type="DATE">day</name> present", and he
                stuck to that. He said it came from his grandmother, who had lots of beautiful
                things of that kind. A <name type="GPE">ri</name>diculous story. I have no doubt that Sm�agol's grandmother
                was a mat<name type="GPE">ri</name>arch, a great person in her way, but to talk of her possessing many
                <name type="ORG">Elven</name>-<name type="GPE">ri</name>ngs was absurd, and as for giving them away, it was a lie. But a lie with a
                grain of truth.</p>
            <p>'The murder of Deal haunted <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>, and he had made up a de<name type="PERSON">fen</name>ce, repeating it to his
                "precious" over and over again, as he gnawed b<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s in the dark, until he almost
                believed it. It _was_ his birth<name type="DATE">day</name>. Deal ought to have given the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng to him. It had
                previously turned up just so as to be a present. It _was_ his birth<name type="DATE">day</name> present, and
                so on, and on.</p>
            <p>I endured him as long as I could, but the truth was desperately imp<name type="GPE">ortan</name>t, and in the
                end I had to be harsh. I put the fear of fire on him, and wrung the true story out
                of him, bit by bit, together with much snivelling and snarling. He thought he was
                misunderstood and ill-used. But when he had at last told me his history, as far as
                the end of the <name type="PERSON">Riddle</name>-game and <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>'s escape, he would not say any more, except in
                dark hints. Some other fear was on him greater than mine. He muttered that he was
                going to gel his own back. People would see if he would stand being kicked, and
                d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ven into a hole and then _robbed._ <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> had good f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends now, good f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends and
                very strong. They would help him. <name type="PERSON">Baggins</name> would pay for it. That was his chief
                thought. He hated <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> and cursed his name. What is more, he knew where he came
                from.'</p>
            <p><q>'But how did he find that out?'</q> asked <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.</p>
            <p>'Well, as for the name, <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> very foolishly told <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> himself; and after that it
                would not be difficult to discover his country, once <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> came out. Oh yes, he
                came out. His longing for the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> proved stronger than his fear of the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s, or
                even of the light. After <name type="DATE">a <name type="DATE">year</name></name> or <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> he left the mountains. You see, though still
                bound by desire of it, the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> was no longer devou<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng him; he began to revive a
                little. He felt old, ter<name type="GPE">ri</name>bly old, yet less timid, and he was mortally hungry.</p>
            <p>
                <q>'Light, light of <name type="ORG">Sun</name> and <name type="PERSON">Moon</name>, he still feared and hated, and he always will, I
                    think; but he was cunning. He found he could hide from <name type="DATE">day</name>light and moonshine,
                    and make his way swiftly and softly by dead of <name type="TIME">night</name> with his pale cold eyes,
                    and catch small f<name type="GPE">ri</name>gh<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed or unwary things. He grew stronger and bolder with
                    new food and new air. He found his way into <name type="GPE">Mirkwood</name>, as <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> would expect.'</q>
            </p>
            <p><q>'Is that where you found him?'</q> asked <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.</p>
            <p><q>'I saw him there,'</q> answered <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, 'but before that he had <name type="PERSON">wan</name>dered far,
                following <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>'s trail. It was difficult to learn anything from him for certain,
                for his talk was constantly interrupted by curses and threats. "What had it got in
                its pocketses?" he said. "It wouldn't say, no precious. Little cheat. Not a fair
                question. It cheated <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>, it did. It broke the rules. We ought to have squeezed
                it, yes precious. And we will, precious!"</p>
            <p>
                <q>'That is a sample of his talk. I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t suppose you <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t any more. I had weary
                    <name type="DATE">day</name>s of it. But from hints dropped among the snarls I even gathered that his
                    padding feet had taken him at last to <name type="GPE">Esgaroth</name>, and even to the streets of <name type="ORG">Dale</name>,
                    lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing <name type="ORG">sec</name>retly and pee<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng. Well, the news of the great events went far and
                    wide in <name type="PERSON">Wilderland</name>, and many had heard <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>'s name and knew where he came from.
                    We had made no <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret of our return journey to his home in the <name type="LOC">West</name>. <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>'s
                    sharp ears would soon learn what he <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ted.'</q>
            </p>
            <p><q>'Then why didn't he track <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> further?'</q> asked <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'Why didn't he come
                    to the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>?'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Ah,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, 'now we come to it. I think <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed to. He set out
                and came back westward, as far as the <name type="LOC">Great <name type="LOC">River</name></name>. But then he turned aside. He was
                not daunted by the distance, I am sure. No, something else drew him away. So my
                f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends think, those that hunted him for me.</p>
            <p>'The <name type="PERSON">Wood</name>-elves tracked him <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>, an easy task for them, for his trail was still
                fresh then. <name type="PERSON">Thr</name>ough <name type="GPE">Mirkwood</name> and back again it led them, though they never caught
                him. The wood was full of the rumour of him, dreadful tales even among beasts and
                birds. The <name type="PERSON">Wood</name>men said that there was some new terror abroad, a ghost that drank
                blood. It climbed trees to find nests; it crept into holes to find the young; it
                slipped through windows to find cradles.</p>
            <p>'But at the western edge of <name type="GPE">Mirkwood</name> the trail turned away. It <name type="PERSON">wan</name>dered off
                southwards and passed out of the <name type="PERSON">Wood</name>-elves' ken, and was lost. And then I made a
                great mistake. Yes, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, and not the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>; though I fear it may prove the worst.
                I let the matter be. I let him go; for I had much else to think of at that time, and
                I still trusted the lore of <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>.</p>
            <p>'Well, that was <name type="DATE">year</name>s ago. I have paid for it since with many dark and dangerous
                <name type="DATE">day</name>s. The trail was long cold when I took it up again, after <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> left here. And my
                search would have been in vain, but for the help that I had from a f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end: <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>,
                the greatest traveller and huntsman of this age of the world. Together we sought for
                <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> down the whole length of <name type="PERSON">Wilderland</name>, without hope, and without success. But
                at last, when I had given up the chase and turned to other parts, <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> was found.
                My f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end returned out of the great pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ls b<name type="GPE">ri</name>nging the miserable creature with
                him.</p>
            <p>
                <q>'What he had been doing he would not say. He only wept and called us cruel, with
                    many a _<name type="PERSON">gollum</name>_ in his throat; and when we pressed him he whined and c<name type="GPE">ri</name>nged,
                    and rubbed his long hands, licking his fingers as if they pained him, as if he
                    remembered some old torture. But I am afraid there is no possible doubt: he had
                    made his slow, sneaking way, step by step, mile by mile, south, down at last to
                    the Land of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>A heavy silence fell in the room. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> could hear his heart beating. Even outside
                everything seemed still. No sound of <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>'s shears could now be heard.</p>
            <p><q>'Yes, to <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. '<name type="PERSON">Alas</name>! <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> draws all wicked things, and the
                Dark <name type="ORG">Power</name> was bending all its will to gather them there. The <name type="ORG">Ring</name> of the Enemy
                would leave its <name type="PERSON">mar</name>k, too, leave him open to the summons. And all folk were
                whispe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng then of the new <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name> in the <name type="LOC">South</name>, and its hatred of the <name type="LOC">West</name>. There
                were his fine new f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends, who would help him in his revenge!</p>
            <p>'Wretched fool! In that land he would learn much, too much for his comfort. And
                so<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>r or later as he lurked and p<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed on the borders he would be caught, and taken
                � for examination. That was the way of it, I fear. When he was found he had already
                been there long, and was on his way back. On some errand of mischief. But that does
                not matter much now. His worst mischief was <name type="PERSON">don</name>e.</p>
            <p>'Yes, alas! through him the Enemy has learned that the <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> has been found again. He
                knows where <name type="ORG">Isildur</name> fell. He knows where <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> found his <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng. He knows that it is
                a Great <name type="ORG">Ring</name>, for it gave long life. He knows that it is not <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the <name type="PERSON">Thr</name>ee, for
                they have never been lost, and they endure no evil. He knows that it is not <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of
                the <name type="CARDINAL">Seven</name>, or the <name type="CARDINAL">Nine</name>, for they are accounted for. He knows that it is the <name type="CARDINAL">One</name>. And
                he has at last heard, I think, of _hobbits_ and the _<name type="LOC">Shire</name>._</p>
            <p>
                <q>'The <name type="LOC">Shire</name> � he may be seeking for it now, if he has not already found out where
                    it lies. Indeed, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, I fear that he may even think that the long-unnoticed
                    name of _<name type="PERSON">Baggins</name>_ has become imp<name type="GPE">ortan</name>t.'</q>
            </p>
            <p><q>'But this is ter<name type="GPE">ri</name>ble!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'<name type="LOC">Far</name> worse than the worst that I
                    imagined from your hints and warnings. O <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, best of f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends, what am I to
                    do? For now I am really afraid. What am I to do? What a pity that <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> did not
                    stab that vile creature, when he had a chance!'</q></p>
            <p>
                <q>'Pity? It was Pity that stayed his hand. Pity, and <name type="ORG">Mercy</name>: not to st<name type="GPE">ri</name>ke without
                    need. And he has been well rewarded, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. Be sure that he took so little hurt
                    from the evil, and escaped in the end, because he began his ownership of the
                    <name type="ORG">Ring</name> so. With Pity.'</q>
            </p>
            <p><q>'I am sorry,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'But I am f<name type="GPE">ri</name>gh<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed; and I do not feel any pity
                    for <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'You have not seen him,'</q> <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> broke in.</p>
            <p><q>'No, and I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t to,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. I can't understand you. Do you mean to
                say that you, and the <name type="ORG">Elves</name>, have let him live on after all those hor<name type="GPE">ri</name>ble deeds?
                Now at any rate he is as bad as an <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>, and just an enemy. He deserves death.'</p>
            <p>
                <q>'Deserves it! I daresay he does. Many that live deserve death. And some that die
                    deserve life. Can you give it to them? Then do not be too eager to deal out
                    death in judgement. For even the very wise cannot see all ends. I have not much
                    hope that <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> can be cured before he dies, but there is a chance of it. And
                    he is bound up with the fate of the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>. My heart tells me that he has some
                    part to play yet, for good or ill, before the end; and when that comes, the pity
                    of <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> may rule the fate of many � yours not least. In any case we did not
                    kill him: he is very old and very wretched. The <name type="PERSON">Wood</name>-elves have him in p<name type="GPE">ri</name>son,
                    but they treat him with such kindness as they can find in their wise
                    hearts.'</q>
            </p>
            <p><q>'All the same,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, <q>'even if <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> could not kill <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>, I wish he
                    had not kept the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>. I wish he had never found it, and that I had not got it!
                    Why did you let me keep it? Why didn't you make me throw it away, or, or destroy
                    it?'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Let you? Make you?'</q> said the wizard. '<name type="GPE">Haven</name>'t you been lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing to all that
                I have said? You are not thinking of what you are saying. But as for throwing it
                away, that was obviously wrong. These <name type="ORG">Ring</name>s have a way of being found. In evil hands
                it might have <name type="PERSON">don</name>e great evil. Worst of all, it might have fallen into the hands of
                the Enemy. Indeed it certainly would; for this is the <name type="CARDINAL">One</name>, and he is exerting all
                his power to find it or draw it to himself.</p>
            <p>
                <q>'Of course, my dear <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, it was dangerous for you; and that has troubled me
                    deeply. But there was so much at stake that I had to take some <name type="GPE">ri</name>sk � though
                    even when I was far away there has never been <name type="DATE">a <name type="DATE">day</name></name> when the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> has not been
                    guarded by watchful eyes. As long as you never used it, I did not think that the
                    <name type="ORG">Ring</name> would have any lasting effect on you, not for evil, not at any rate for a
                    very long time. And you must remember that <name type="CARDINAL">nine</name> <name type="DATE">year</name>s ago, when I last saw you,
                    I still knew little for certain.'</q>
            </p>
            <p><q>'But why not destroy it, as you say should have been <name type="PERSON">don</name>e <name type="DATE">long ago</name>?'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed
                <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> again. If you had warned me, or even sent me a message, I would have <name type="PERSON">don</name>e away
                with it.'</p>
            <p>
                <q>'Would you? <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w would you do that? Have you ever t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed?'</q>
            </p>
            <p>
                <q>'No. But I suppose <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> could hammer it or melt it.'</q>
            </p>
            <p><q>'Try!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'Try now!'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> drew the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> out of his pocket again and looked at it. It now appeared plain
                and smooth, without <name type="PERSON">mar</name>k or device that he could see. The gold looked very fair and
                pure, and <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> thought how <name type="GPE">ri</name>ch and beautiful was its colour, how perfect was its
                roundness. It was an admirable thing and altogether precious. When he took it out he
                had in<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ded to fling it from him into the very hottest part of the fire. But he
                found now that he could not do so, not without a great struggle. He weighed the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>
                in his hand, hesitating, and forcing himself to remember all that <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> had told
                him; and then with an effort of will he made a movement, as if to cast it away � but
                he found that he had put it back in his pocket.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> laughed g<name type="GPE">ri</name>mly. 'You see? Already you too, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, cannot easily let it go,
                nor will to damage it. And I could not "make" you � except by force, which would
                break your mind. But as for breaking the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>, force is useless. Even if you took it
                and struck it with a heavy sledge-hammer, it would make no dint in it. It cannot be
                unmade by your hands, or by mine.</p>
            <p>
                <q>'Your small fire, of course, would not melt even ordinary gold. This <name type="ORG">Ring</name> has
                    already passed through it unscathed, and even unheated. But there is no smith's
                    forge in this <name type="LOC">Shire</name> that could change it at all. Not even the anvils and
                    furnaces of the <name type="ORG">Dwarves</name> could do that. It has been said that dragon-fire could
                    melt and consume the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>s of <name type="ORG">Power</name>, but there is not now any dragon left on
                    <name type="LOC">earth</name> in which the old fire is hot enough; nor was there ever any dragon, not
                    even <name type="ORG">Ancalagon the <name type="ORG">Black</name></name>, who could have harmed the <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> <name type="ORG">Ring</name>, the Ruling <name type="ORG">Ring</name>,
                    for that was made by <name type="ORG">Sauron</name> himself. There is only <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> way: to find the Cracks
                    of Doom in the depths of <name type="LOC">Orodruin</name>, the <name type="ORG">Fire</name>-mountain, and cast the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> in
                    there, if you really wish to destroy it, to put it beyond the grasp of the Enemy
                    for ever.'</q>
            </p>
            <p><q>'I do really wish to destroy it!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'Or, well, to have it
                    destroyed. I am not made for pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>lous quests. I wish I had never seen the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>!
                    Why did it come to me? Why was I chosen?'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Such questions cannot be answered,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'You may be sure that it
                    was not for any me<name type="GPE">ri</name>t that others do not possess: not for power or wisdom, at
                    any rate. But you have been chosen, and you must therefore use such strength and
                    heart and wits as you have.'</q></p>
            <p>
                <q>'But I have so little of any of these things! You are wise and powerful. Will you
                    not take the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>?'</q>

            <p><q>'No!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>nging to his feet. <q>'With that power I should have
                    power too great and ter<name type="GPE">ri</name>ble. And over me the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> would gain a power still
                    greater and more deadly.'</q> His eyes flashed and his face was lit as by a fire
                within. <q>'Do not tempt me! For I do not wish to become like the Dark <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd himself.
                    Yet the way of the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> to my heart is by pity, pity for weakness and the desire
                    of strength to do good. Do not tempt me! I dare not take it, not even to keep it
                    safe, unused. The wish to wield it would be too great, for my strength. I shall
                    have such need of it. Great pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ls lie before me.'</q></p>
            <p>He went to the window and drew aside the curtains and the shutters. <name type="ORG">Sun</name>light streamed
                back again into the room. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> passed along the path outside whistling. <q>'And
                    now,'</q> said the wizard, turning back to <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, <q>'the decision lies with
                    you. But I will always help you.'</q> He laid his hand on <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s shoulder.
                    <q>'I will help you bear this burden, as long as It is yours to bear. But we
                    must do something, soon. The Enemy is moving.'</q></p>
            <p>There was a long silence. <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> sat down again and puf<name type="ORG">fed</name> at his pipe, as if lost
                in thought. His eyes seemed closed, but under the lids he was wat<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>
                in<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>tly. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> gazed fixedly at the red embers on the h<name type="LOC">earth</name>, until they filled all
                his vision, and he seemed to be looking down into profound wells of fire. He was
                thinking of the fabled <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Cracks of Doom</name> and the terror of the <name type="FAC">Fiery <name type="LOC">Mountain</name></name>.</p>
            <p><q>'Well!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> at last. <q>'What are you thinking about? Have you
                    decided what to do?'</q></p>
            <p><q>'No!'</q> answered <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, coming back to himself out of darkness, and finding to
                his surp<name type="GPE">ri</name>se that it was not dark, and that out of the window he could see the
                sunlit garden. <q>'Or perhaps, yes. As far as I understand what you have said, I
                    suppose I must keep the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> and guard it, at least for the present, whatever it
                    may do to me.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Whatever it may do, it will be slow, slow to evil, if you keep it with that
                    purpose,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>.</p>
            <p><q>'I hope so,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'But I hope that you may find some other better
                    keeper soon. But in the meanwhile it seems that I am a danger, a danger to all
                    that live near me. I cannot keep the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> and stay here. I ought to leave Bag
                    End, leave the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>, leave everything and go away.'</q> He sighed.</p>
            <p>'I should like to save the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>, if I could � though there have been times when I
                thought the inhabitants too stupid and dull for words, and have felt that an
                <name type="LOC">earth</name>quake or an invasion of dragons might be good for them. But I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t feel like
                that now. I feel that as long as the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> lies behind, safe and comfortable, I
                shall find <name type="PERSON">wan</name>de<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng more bearable: I shall know that somewhere there is a firm
                foothold, even if my feet cannot stand there again.</p>
            <p>
                <q>'Of course, I have sometimes thought of going away, but I imagined that as a kind
                    of holi<name type="DATE">day</name>, a se<name type="GPE">ri</name>es of adventures like <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>'s or better, ending in peace. But
                    this would mean exile, a flight from danger into danger, drawing it after me.
                    And I suppose I must go al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, if I am to do that and save the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>. But I feel
                    very small, and very uprooted, and well � desperate. The Enemy is so strong and
                    ter<name type="GPE">ri</name>ble.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>He did not tell <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, but as he was speaking a great desire to follow <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> flamed
                up in his heart � to follow <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>, and even perhaps to find him again. It was so
                strong that it overcame his fear: he could almost have run out there and then down
                the road without his hat, as <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> had <name type="PERSON">don</name>e on <name type="TIME">a similar <name type="TIME">morning</name></name> <name type="DATE">long ago</name>.</p>
            <p><q>'My dear <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>!'</q> exclaimed <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. '<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbits really are amazing creatures, as
                I have said before. You can learn all that there is to know about their ways in a
                month, and yet after <name type="CARDINAL">a <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name></name> <name type="DATE">year</name>s they can still surp<name type="GPE">ri</name>se you at a pinch. I
                hardly expected to get such an answer, not even from you. But <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> made no mistake
                in choosing his heir, though he little thought how imp<name type="GPE">ortan</name>t it would prove. I am
                afraid you are <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght. The <name type="ORG">Ring</name> will not be able to stay hidden in the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> much
                longer; and for your own sake, as well as for others, you will have to go, and leave
                the name of <name type="PERSON">Baggins</name> behind you. That name will not be safe to have, outside the
                <name type="LOC">Shire</name> or in the Wild. I will give you a travelling name now. When you go, go as Mr.
                <name type="PERSON">Underhill</name>.</p>
            <p>
                <q>'But I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t think you need go al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. Not if you know of any<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> you can trust,
                    and who would be willing to go by your side � and that you would be willing to
                    take into unknown pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ls. But if you look for a companion, be careful in
                    choosing! And be careful of what you say, even to your closest f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends! The
                    enemy has many spies and many ways of hea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>Suddenly he stopped as if lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> became aware that all was very quiet,
                inside and outside. <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> crept to <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> side of the window. Then with a dart he
                sprang to the sill, and thrust a long arm out and downwards. There was a squawk, and
                up came <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> <name type="PERSON">Gamgee</name>'s curly head hauled by <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> ear.</p>
            <p><q>'Well, well, bless my beard!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Sam</name> <name type="PERSON">Gamgee</name> is it? Now what may
                    you be doing?'</q></p>
            <p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>r bless you, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, sir!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <q>'Nothing! <name type="PRODUCT">Leastways</name> I was just
                    t<name type="GPE">ri</name>mming the grass-border under the window, if you follow me.'</q> He picked up
                his shears and exhibited them as evidence.</p>
            <p><q>'I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> g<name type="GPE">ri</name>mly. It is some time since I last heard the sound
                of your shears. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w long have you been eavesdropping?'</p>
            <p>
                <q>'Eavesdropping, sir? I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t follow you, begging your par<name type="PERSON">don</name>. There ain't no
                    eaves at <name type="FAC">Bag End</name>, and that's a fact.'</q>
            </p>
            <p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Don</name>'t be a fool! What have you heard, and why did you lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>?'</q> <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>'s eyes
                flashed and his brows stuck out like b<name type="GPE">ri</name>stles.</p>
            <p><q>'Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, sir!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> quaking. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Don</name>'t let him hurt me, sir! <name type="PERSON">Don</name>'t let
                    him turn me into anything unnatural! My old dad would take on so. I meant no
                    harm, on my honour, sir!'</q></p>
            <p><q>'He won't hurt you,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, hardly able to keep from laughing, although
                he was himself startled and rather puzzled. <q>'He knows, as well as I do, that you
                    mean no harm. But just you up and answer his questions straight away!'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Well, sir,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> dithe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng a little. <q>'I heard a deal that I didn't
                    <name type="GPE">ri</name>ghtly understand, about an enemy, and <name type="GPE">ri</name>ngs, and Mr. <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>, sir, and dragons,
                    and a fiery mountain, and � and <name type="ORG">Elves</name>, sir. I lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed because I couldn't help
                    myself, if you know what I mean. <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>r bless me, sir, but I do love tales of that
                    sort. And I believe them too, whatever <name type="PERSON">Ted</name> may say. <name type="ORG">Elves</name>, sir! I would dearly
                    love to see _them._ Couldn't you take me to see <name type="ORG">Elves</name>, sir, when you
                go?'</q></p>
            <p>Suddenly <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> laughed. <q>'Come inside!'</q> he shouted, and putting out both his
                arms he lifted the astonished <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, shears, grass-clippings and all, <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght through
                the window and stood him on the floor. <q>'Take you to see <name type="ORG">Elves</name>, eh?'</q> he said,
                eyeing <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> closely, but with a smile flicke<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng on his face. <q>'So you heard that
                    Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> is going away?'</q></p>
            <p>
                <q>'I did, sir. And that's why I choked: which you heard seemingly. I t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed not to,
                    sir, but it burst out of me: I was so upset.'</q>
            </p>
            <p><q>'It can't be helped, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> sadly. He had suddenly realized that
                flying from the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> would mean more painful partings than merely saying farewell
                to the familiar comforts of <name type="FAC">Bag End</name>. <q>'I shall have to go. But' � and here he
                    looked hard at <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> � 'if you really care about me, you will keep that _dead_
                    <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret. See? If you <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t, if you even breathe a word of what you've heard here,
                    then I hope <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> will turn you into a spotted toad and fill the garden full
                    of grass-snakes.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> fell on his knees, trembling. <q>'Get up, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. I have thought
                of something better than that. Something to shut your mouth, and punish you properly
                for lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing. You shall go away with Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>!'</p>
            <p><q>'Me, sir!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>nging up like a dog invited for a walk. <q>'Me go
                    and see <name type="ORG">Elves</name> and all! <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>oray!'</q> he shouted, and then burst into tears.</p>

            <p><q>'You ought to go quietly, and you ought to go soon,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <name type="CARDINAL">Two</name> or
                <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> <name type="DATE">week</name>s had passed, and still <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> made no sign of getting ready to go.</p>
            <p><q>'I know. But it is difficult to do both,'</q> he objected. If I just vanish like
                <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>, the tale will be all over the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> in no time.'</p>
            <p><q>'Of course you mustn't vanish!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'That wouldn't do at all! I
                    said _soon,_ not _instantly._ If you can think of any way of slipping out of the
                    <name type="LOC">Shire</name> without its being generally known, it will be worth a little delay. But
                    you must not delay too long.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'What about the <name type="DATE">autumn</name>, on or after Our Birth<name type="DATE">day</name>?'</q> asked <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'I think I
                    could probably make some arrangements by then.'</q></p>
            <p>To tell the truth, he was very reluctant to start, now that it had come to the point.
                <name type="FAC">Bag End</name> seemed a more desirable residence than it had for <name type="DATE">year</name>s, and he <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ted to
                savour as much as he could of his last <name type="DATE">summer</name> in the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>. When <name type="DATE">autumn</name> came, he
                knew that part at least of his heart would think more kindly of journeying, as it
                always did at that season. He had indeed p<name type="GPE">ri</name>vately made up his mind to leave on his
                <name type="ORDINAL">fiftieth</name> birth<name type="DATE">day</name>: <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>'s <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name> and <name type="CARDINAL">twenty</name>-<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name>h. It seemed somehow the
                proper <name type="DATE">day</name> on which to set out and follow him. Following <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> was uppermost in his
                mind, and the <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> thing that made the thought of leaving bearable. He thought as
                little as possible about the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>, and where it might lead him in the end. But he
                did not tell all his thoughts to <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. What the wizard guessed was always
                difficult to tell.</p>
            <p>He looked at <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and smiled. <q>'Very well,'</q> he said. <q>'I think that will do
                    � but it must not be any later. I am getting very anxious. In the mean-while, do
                    take care, and <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t let out any hint of where you are going! And see that <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>
                    <name type="PERSON">Gamgee</name> does not talk. If he does, I really shall turn him into a toad.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'As for _where I_ am going,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, <q>'it would be difficult to give
                    that away, for I have no clear idea myself, yet.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Don</name>'t be absurd!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'I am not warning you against leaving an
                    address at the post-office! But you are leaving the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> � and that should not
                    be known, until you are far away. And you must go, or at least set out, either
                    <name type="LOC">North</name>, <name type="LOC">South</name>, <name type="LOC">West</name> or <name type="LOC">East</name> � and the direction should certainly not be
                    known.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'I have been so taken up with the thoughts of leaving <name type="FAC">Bag End</name>, and of saying
                    farewell, that I have never even considered the direction,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.
                    <q>'For where am I to go? And by what shall I steer? What is to be my quest?
                    <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> went to find a treasure, there and back again; but I go to lose <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, and
                    not return, as far as I can see.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'But you cannot see very far,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'Neither can I. It may be your
                    task to find the <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Cracks of Doom</name>; but that quest may be for others: I do not
                    know. At any rate you are not ready for that long road yet.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'No indeed!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'But in the meantime what course am I to
                    lake?'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Towards danger; but not too rashly, nor too straight,'</q> answered the wizard.
                    <q>'If you <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t my advice, make for <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name>. That journey should not prove too
                    pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>lous, though the <name type="FAC">Road</name> is less easy than it was, and it will grow worse as
                    <name type="DATE">the <name type="DATE">year</name></name> fails.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'<name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name>!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'Very good: I will go east, and I will make for
                    <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name>. I will take <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> to visit the <name type="ORG">Elves</name>; he will be delighted.'</q> He
                spoke lightly; but his heart was moved suddenly with a desire to see the house of
                <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name> <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>f<name type="ORG">elven</name>, and breathe the air of that deep valley where many of the <name type="ORG">Fair</name>
                Folk still dwelt in peace.</p>
            <p><name type="CARDINAL">One</name> <name type="DATE">summer</name>'s <name type="TIME">evening</name> an astonishing piece of news reached the _Ivy <name type="PERSON">Bush</name>_ and _Green
                Dragon._ <name type="ORG">Giants</name> and other por<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ts on the borders of the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> were forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> for
                more imp<name type="GPE">ortan</name>t matters: Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> was selling <name type="FAC">Bag End</name>, indeed he had already sold it
                � to the Sackville-<name type="PERSON">Baggins</name>es!</p>
            <p><q>'For a nice bit, loo,'</q> said some. <q>'At a bargain p<name type="GPE">ri</name>ce,'</q> said others,
                    <q>'and that's more likely when Mistress <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>belia's the buyer.'</q> (<name type="ORG">Otho</name> had
                died <name type="DATE">some <name type="DATE">year</name>s</name> before, at the <name type="GPE">ri</name>pe but disappointed age of 102.)</p>
            <p>Just why Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> was selling his beautiful hole was even more debatable than the
                p<name type="GPE">ri</name>ce. A few held the theory � supported by the nods and hints of Mr. <name type="PERSON">Baggins</name>
                himself � that <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s m<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>y was running out: he was going to leave <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbiton and
                live in a quiet way on the proceeds of the sale down in <name type="PERSON">Buckland</name> among his
                <name type="ORG">Brand</name>ybuck relations. <q>'As far from the Sackville-<name type="PERSON">Baggins</name>es as may be,'</q> some
                added. But so firmly fixed had the notion of the immeasurable wealth of the
                <name type="PERSON">Baggins</name>es of <name type="FAC">Bag End</name> become that most found this hard to believe, harder than any
                other reason or unreason that their fancy could suggest: to most it suggested a dark
                and yet unrevealed plot by <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. Though he kept himself very quiet and did not go
                about by <name type="DATE">day</name>, it was well known that he was 'hiding up in the <name type="FAC">Bag End</name>'. But however
                a removal might fit in with the designs of his wizardry, there was no doubt about
                the fact: <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> <name type="PERSON">Baggins</name> was going back to <name type="PERSON">Buckland</name>.</p>
            <p><q>'Yes, I shall be moving this <name type="DATE">autumn</name>,'</q> he said. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Merry</name> <name type="ORG">Brand</name>ybuck is looking
                    out for a nice little hole for me, or perhaps a small house.'</q></p>
            <p>As a matter of fact with <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>'s help he had already chosen and bought a little house
                at <name type="ORG">C<name type="GPE">ri</name>ckhollow</name> in the country beyond <name type="ORG">Bucklebury</name>. To all but <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> he pre<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ded he was
                going to settle down there permanently. The decision to set out eastwards had
                suggested the idea to him; for <name type="PERSON">Buckland</name> was on the eastern borders of the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>, and
                as he had lived there in childhood his going back would at least seem credible.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> stayed in the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> for over <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> <name type="DATE">months</name>. Then <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> <name type="TIME">evening</name>, at the end of
                <name type="DATE">June</name>, soon after <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s plan had been finally arranged, he suddenly announced that
                he was going off again next <name type="TIME">morning</name>. <q>'Only for a short while, I hope,'</q> he
                said. <q>'But I am going down beyond the southern borders to get some news, if I
                    can. I have been idle longer than I should.'</q></p>
            <p>He spoke lightly, but it seemed to <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> that he looked rather wor<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed. <q>'Has
                    anything happened?'</q> he asked.</p>
            <p><q>'Well no; but I have heard something that has made me anxious and needs looking
                    into. If I think it necessary after all for you to get off at once, I shall come
                    back immediately, or at least send word. In the meanwhile stick to your plan;
                    but be more careful than ever, especially of the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>. Let me impress on you
                    once more: _<name type="PERSON">don</name>'t use it!'</q>_</p>
            <p>He went off at <name type="TIME">dawn</name>. <q>'I may be back <name type="DATE">any <name type="DATE">day</name></name>,'</q> he said. <q>'At the very latest
                    I shall come back for the farewell party. I think after all you may need my
                    company on the <name type="FAC">Road</name>.'</q></p>
            <p>At <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> was a good deal disturbed, and wondered of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> what <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> could have
                heard; but his uneasiness wore off, and in the fine weather he forgot his troubles
                for a while. The <name type="LOC">Shire</name> had seldom seen so fair a <name type="DATE">summer</name>, or so <name type="GPE">ri</name>ch an <name type="DATE">autumn</name>: the
                trees were laden with apples, h<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>y was d<name type="GPE">ri</name>pping in the combs, and the corn was tall
                and full.</p>
            <p><name type="DATE">Autumn</name> was well under way before <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> began to worry about <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> again. <name type="DATE">September</name>
                was passing and there was still no news of him. The Birth<name type="DATE">day</name>, and the removal, drew
                nearer, and still he did not come, or send word. <name type="FAC">Bag End</name> began to be busy. Some of
                <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends came to stay and help him with the packing: there was <name type="PERSON">Fredegar</name>
                <name type="PERSON">Bolger</name> and <name type="PERSON">Folco</name> <name type="PERSON">Boffin</name>, and of course his special f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> <name type="PERSON">Took</name> and <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>
                <name type="ORG">Brand</name>ybuck. Between them they turned the whole place upside-down.</p>
            <p>On <name type="DATE">September</name> 20th <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> covered carts went off laden to <name type="PERSON">Buckland</name>, conveying the
                furniture and goods that <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> had not sold to his new home, by way of the
                <name type="ORG">Brand</name>ywine <name type="FAC">B<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge</name>. <name type="DATE">The next <name type="DATE">day</name></name> <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> became really anxious, and kept a constant
                look-out for <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <name type="DATE">Thurs<name type="DATE">day</name></name>, his birth<name type="DATE">day</name> <name type="TIME">morning</name>, <name type="TIME">dawn</name>ed as fair and clear as it
                had <name type="DATE">long ago</name> for <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>'s great party. Still <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> did not appear. In the <name type="TIME">evening</name>
                <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> gave his farewell feast: it was quite small, just a dinner for himself and his
                <name type="CARDINAL">four</name> helpers; but he was troubled and fell in no mood for it. The thought that he
                would so soon have to part with his young f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends weighed on his heart. He wondered
                how he would break it to them.</p>
            <p>The <name type="CARDINAL">four</name> younger hobbits were, however, in high spi<name type="GPE">ri</name>ts, and the party soon became
                very cheerful in spite of <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>'s absence. The dining-room was bare except for a
                table and c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>rs, but the food was good, and there was good wine: <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s wine had
                not been included in the sale to the Sackville-<name type="PERSON">Baggins</name>es.</p>
            <p><q>'Whatever happens to the rest of my stuff, when the <name type="WORK_OF_ART">S.-B.s</name> get their claws on it,
                    at any rate I have found a good home for this!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, as he drained
                his glass. It was the last drop of <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Old Winyards</name>.</p>
            <p>When they had sung many songs, and talked of many things they had <name type="PERSON">don</name>e together, they
                toasted <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>'s birth<name type="DATE">day</name>, and they drank his health and <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s together according
                to <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s cus<name type="PERSON">tom</name>. Then they went out for a sniff of air, and glimpse of the stars,
                and then they went to bed. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s party was over, and <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> had not come.</p>
            <p><name type="TIME">The next <name type="TIME">morning</name></name> they were busy packing another cart with the remainder of the
                luggage. <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> took charge of this, and drove off with <name type="PERSON">Fatty</name> (that is <name type="PERSON">Fredegar</name>
                <name type="PERSON">Bolger</name>). <q>'Some<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> must get there and warm the house before you ar<name type="GPE">ri</name>ve,'</q> said
                <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'Well, see you later � the <name type="DATE">day</name> after to<name type="DATE">morrow</name>, if you <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t go to sleep on
                    the way!'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Folco</name> went home after lunch, but <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> remained behind. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> was restless and
                anxious, lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing in vain for a sound of <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. He decided to wait until
                <name type="TIME">night</name>fall. After that, if <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ted him urgently, he would go to <name type="ORG">C<name type="GPE">ri</name>ckhollow</name>,
                and might even get there <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>. For <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> was going on foot. His plan � for pleasure
                and a last look at the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> as much as any other reason � was to walk from <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbiton
                to <name type="ORG">Bucklebury</name> <name type="FAC">Ferry</name>, taking it fairly easy.</p>
            <p><q>'I shall get myself a bit into training, too,'</q> he said, looking at himself in
                a dusty mirror in the <name type="CARDINAL">half</name>-empty hall. He had not <name type="PERSON">don</name>e any strenuous walking for a
                long time, and the reflection looked rather flabby, he thought.</p>
            <p>After lunch, the Sackville-<name type="PERSON">Baggins</name>es, <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>belia and her sandy-<name type="PERSON">hai</name>red son, <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>tho, turned
                up, much to <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s annoyance. <q>'Ours at last!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>belia, as she stepped
                inside. It was not polite; nor st<name type="GPE">ri</name>ctly true, for the sale of <name type="FAC">Bag End</name> did not take
                effect until <name type="TIME">mid<name type="TIME">night</name></name>. But <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>belia can perhaps be forgiven: she had been obliged to
                wait <name type="DATE">about <name type="CARDINAL">seven</name>ty-<name type="CARDINAL">seven</name> <name type="DATE">year</name>s</name> longer for <name type="FAC">Bag End</name> than she once hoped, and she was
                now <name type="CARDINAL">a <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name></name> <name type="DATE">year</name>s old. Anyway, she had come to see that nothing she had paid for
                had been car<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed off; and she <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ted the keys. It took a long while to satisfy her,
                as she had brought a complete inventory with her and went <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght through it. In the
                end she departed with <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>tho and the spare key and the promise that the other key
                would be left at the <name type="PERSON">Gamgee</name>s' in <name type="ORG">Bagshot Row</name>. She snorted, and showed plainly that
                she thought the <name type="PERSON">Gamgee</name>s capable of plunde<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng the hole du<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng the <name type="TIME">night</name>. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> did
                not offer her any tea.</p>
            <p>He took his own tea with <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> <name type="PERSON">Gamgee</name> in the kitchen. It had been officially
                announced that <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> was coming to <name type="PERSON">Buckland</name> 'to do for Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and look after his
                bit of garden'; an arrangement that was approved by the <name type="PERSON">Gaffer</name>, though it did not
                console him for the prospect of having <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>belia as a neighbour.</p>
            <p><q>'Our last meal at <name type="FAC">Bag End</name>!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, pushing back his c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>r. They left the
                washing up for <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>belia. <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> strapped up their <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> packs and piled them
                in the porch. <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> went out for a last stroll in the garden. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> disappeared.</p>
            <p>The sun went down. <name type="FAC">Bag End</name> seemed sad and gloomy and dishevelled. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> <name type="PERSON">wan</name>dered
                round the familiar rooms, and saw the light of the sunset fade on the walls, and
                shadows creep out of the corners. It grew slowly dark indoors. He went out and
                walked down to the gate at the bot<name type="PERSON">tom</name> of the path, and then on a short way down the
                <name type="ORG">Hill</name> <name type="FAC">Road</name>. He <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> expected to see <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> come st<name type="GPE">ri</name>ding up through the <name type="TIME">dusk</name>.</p>
            <p>The sky was clear and the stars were growing b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght. <q>'It's going to be a fine
                    <name type="TIME">night</name>,'</q> he said aloud. <q>'That's good for a beginning. I feel like walking.
                    I can't bear any more hanging about. I am going to start, and <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> must
                    follow me.'</q> He turned to go back, and then slopped, for he heard voices,
                just round the corner by the end of <name type="ORG">Bagshot Row</name>. <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> voice was certainly the old
                <name type="PERSON">Gaffer</name>'s; the other was strange, and somehow unpleasant. He could not make out what
                it said, but he heard the <name type="PERSON">Gaffer</name>'s answers, which were rather sh<name type="GPE">ri</name>ll. The old man
                seemed put out.</p>
            <p>
                <q>'No, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Baggins</name> has g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> away. Went this <name type="TIME">morning</name>, and my <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> went with him:
                    anyway all his stuff went. Yes, sold out and g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, I tell'ee. Why? Why's n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of
                    my business, or yours. Where to? That ain't no <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret. He's moved to <name type="ORG">Bucklebury</name>
                    or some such place, away down yonder. Yes it is � a tidy way. I've never been so
                    far myself; they're queer folks in <name type="PERSON">Buckland</name>. No, I can't give no message. Good
                    <name type="TIME">night</name> to you!'</q>
            </p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Footsteps</name> went away down the <name type="ORG">Hill</name>. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> wondered vaguely why the fact that they did
                not come on up the <name type="ORG">Hill</name> seemed a great relief. <q>'I am sick of questions and
                    cu<name type="GPE">ri</name>osity about my doings, I suppose,'</q> he thought. <q>'What an inquisitive
                    lot they all are!'</q> He had <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> a mind to go and ask the <name type="PERSON">Gaffer</name> who the
                inquirer was; but he thought better (or worse) of it, and turned and walked quickly
                back to <name type="FAC">Bag End</name>.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> was sitting on his pack in the porch. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> was not there. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> stepped inside
                the dark door. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Sam</name>!'</q> he called. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Sam</name>! <name type="PERSON">Tim</name>e!'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Coming, sir!'</q> came the answer from far within, followed soon by <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> himself,
                wiping his mouth. He had been saying farewell to the beer-barrel in the cellar.</p>
            <p><q>'All aboard, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.</p>
            <p>
                <q>'Yes, sir. I'll last for a bit now, sir.'</q>
            </p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> shut and locked the round door, and gave the key to <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <q>'Run down with this
                    to your home, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>!'</q> he said. <q>'Then cut along the Row and meet us as quick
                    as you can at the gate in the lane beyond the meadows. We are not going through
                    the village to<name type="TIME">night</name>. Too many ears p<name type="GPE">ri</name>cking and eyes prying.'</q> <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> ran off at
                full speed.</p>
            <p><q>'Well, now we're off at last!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. They shouldered their packs and
                took up their sticks, and walked round the corner to the west side of <name type="FAC">Bag End</name>.
                    <q>'Good-bye!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, looking at the dark blank windows. He waved his
                hand, and then turned and (following <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>, if he had known it) hur<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed after
                <name type="PERSON">Pereg<name type="GPE">ri</name>n</name> down the garden-path. They jumped over the low place in the hedge at the
                bot<name type="PERSON">tom</name> and took to the fields, passing into the darkness like a rustle in the
                grasses.</p>
            <p>At the bot<name type="PERSON">tom</name> of the <name type="ORG">Hill</name> on its western side they came to the gate opening on to a
                narrow lane. There they halted and adjusted the straps of their packs. Presently <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>
                appeared, trotting quickly and breathing hard; his heavy pack was hoisted high on
                his shoulders, and he had put on his head a tall shapeless fell bag, which he called
                a hat. In the gloom he looked very much like a dwarf.</p>
            <p><q>'I am sure you have given me all the heaviest stuff,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'I pity
                    snails, and all that carry their homes on their backs.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'I could take a lot more yet, sir. My packet is quite light,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> stoutly
                and untruthfully.</p>
            <p><q>'No, you <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q>'It is good for him. He's got nothing
                    except what he ordered us to pack. He's been slack lately, and he'll feel the
                    w<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name> less when he's walked off some of his own.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Be kind to a poor old hobbit!'</q> laughed <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'I shall be as thin as a
                    willow-<name type="PERSON">wan</name>d, I'm sure, before I get to <name type="PERSON">Buckland</name>. But I was talking nonsense. I
                    suspect you have taken more than your share, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, and I shall look into it at
                    our next packing.'</q> He picked up his stick again. <q>'Well, we all like
                    walking in the dark,'</q> he said, <q>'so let's put some miles behind us before
                    bed.'</q></p>
            <p>For a short way they followed the lane westwards. Then leaving it they turned left
                and took quietly to the fields again. They went in single file along hedgerows and
                the borders of coppices, and <name type="TIME">night</name> fell dark about them. In their dark cloaks they
                were as invisible as if they all had magic <name type="GPE">ri</name>ngs. Since they were all hobbits, and
                were trying to be silent, they made no noise that even hobbits would hear. Even the
                wild things in the fields and woods hardly noticed their passing.</p>
            <p>After some time they crossed the Water, west of <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbiton, by a narrow plank-b<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge.
                The stream was there no more than a winding black <name type="GPE">ri</name>bbon, bordered with leaning
                alder-trees. <name type="QUANTITY">A mile</name> or <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> further south they hastily crossed the great road from
                the <name type="ORG">Brand</name>ywine <name type="FAC">B<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge</name>; they were now in the <name type="PERSON">Took</name>land and bending south-eastwards
                they made for the Green <name type="ORG">Hill</name> Country. As they began to climb its <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> slopes they
                looked back and saw the lamps in <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbiton far off twinkling in the gentle valley of
                the Water. Soon it disappeared in the folds of the darkened land, and was followed
                by <name type="PERSON">Bywater</name> beside its grey pool. When the light of the last farm was far behind,
                peeping among the trees, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> turned and waved a hand in farewell.</p>
            <p><q>'I wonder if I shall ever look down into that valley again,'</q> he said
                quietly.</p>
            <p>When they had walked for <name type="TIME">about <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> <name type="TIME">hour</name>s</name> they rested. <name type="TIME">The <name type="TIME">night</name></name> was clear, cool,
                and starry, but smoke-like wisps of mist were creeping up the hill-sides from the
                streams and deep meadows. Thin-clad birches, swaying in a light wind above their
                heads, made a black net against the pale sky. They ate a very frugal supper (for
                hobbits), and then went on again. Soon they struck a narrow road, that went rolling
                up and down, fading grey into the darkness ahead: the road to <name type="PERSON">Wood</name>hall, and <name type="ORG">Stock</name>,
                and the <name type="ORG">Bucklebury</name> <name type="FAC">Ferry</name>. It climbed away from the main road in the Water-valley,
                and wound over the skirts of the Green <name type="ORG">Hill</name>s towards <name type="PERSON">Wood</name>y-End, a wild corner of the
                <name type="LOC">East</name>farthing.</p>
            <p>After a while they plunged into a deeply cloven track between tall trees that rustled
                their dry leaves in the <name type="TIME">night</name>. It was very dark. At <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> they talked, or hummed a
                tune softly together, being now far away from inquisitive ears. Then they <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ched on
                in silence, and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> began to lag behind. At last, as they began to climb a steep
                slope, he stopped and yawned.</p>
            <p><q>'I am so sleepy,'</q> he said, <q>'that soon I shall fall down on the road. Are
                    you going to sleep on your legs? It is nearly <name type="TIME">mid<name type="TIME">night</name></name>.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'I thought you liked walking in the dark,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'But there is no
                    great hurry. <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> expects us some time the <name type="DATE">day</name> after to<name type="DATE">morrow</name>; but that leaves
                    us nearly <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> <name type="DATE">day</name>s more. We'll halt at the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> likely spot.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'The wind's in the <name type="LOC">West</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <q>'If we get to the other side of this
                    hill, we shall find a spot that is sheltered and snug enough, sir. There is a
                    dry fir-wood just ahead, if I remember <name type="GPE">ri</name>ghtly.'</q> <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> knew the land well
                within <name type="CARDINAL">twenty</name> miles of <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbiton, but that was the limit of his geography.</p>
            <p>Just over the top of the hill they came on the patch of fir-wood. Leaving the road
                they went into the deep resin-scented darkness of the trees, and gathered dead
                sticks and c<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s to make a fire. Soon they had a merry crackle of flame at the foot
                of a large fir-tree and they sat round it for a while, until they began to nod.
                Then, each in an angle of the great tree's roots, they curled up in their cloaks and
                blankets, and were soon fast asleep. They set no watch; even <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> feared no danger
                yet, for they were still in the heart of the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>. A few creatures came and looked
                at them when the fire had died away. A fox passing through the wood on business of
                his own stopped several <name type="TIME">minutes</name> and snif<name type="ORG">fed</name>.</p>
            <p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbits!'</q> he thought. <q>'Well, what next? I have heard of strange doings in
                    this land, but I have seldom heard of a hobbit sleeping out of doors under a
                    tree. <name type="PERSON">Thr</name>ee of them! There's something mighty queer behind this.'</q> He was
                quite <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght, but he never found out any more about it.</p>
            <p><name type="TIME">The <name type="TIME">morning</name></name> came, pale and clammy. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> woke up <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>, and found that a tree-root
                had made a hole in his back, and that his neck was stiff.</p>
            <p><q>'Walking for pleasure! Why didn't I d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ve?'</q> he thought, as he usually did at
                the beginning of an expedition. <q>'And all my beautiful feather beds are sold to
                    the Sackville-<name type="PERSON">Baggins</name>es! These tree-roots would do them good.'</q> He stretched.
                    <q>'Wake up, hobbits!'</q> he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed. It's a beautiful <name type="TIME">morning</name>.'</p>
            <p><q>'What's beautiful about it?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>, pee<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng over the edge of his blanket
                with <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> eye. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Sam</name>! Gel breakfast ready for <name type="CARDINAL">half</name>-past <name type="CARDINAL">nine</name>! Have you got the
                    bath-water hot?'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> jumped up, looking rather bleary. <q>'No, sir, I haven't, sir!'</q> he said.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> st<name type="GPE">ri</name>pped the blankets from <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> and rolled him over, and then walked off to
                the edge of the wood. Away eastward the sun was <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing red out of the mists that lay
                thick on the world. Touched with gold and red the <name type="DATE">autumn</name> trees seemed to be sailing
                rootless in a shadowy sea. A little below him to the left the road ran down steeply
                into a hollow and disappeared.</p>
            <p>When he returned <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> had got a good fire going. <q>'Water!'</q> shouted
                <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q>'Where's the water?'</q></p>
            <p><q>'I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t keep water in my pockets,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'We thought you had g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> to
                    find some,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>, busy setting out the food, and cups. <q>'You had
                    better go now.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'You can come too,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, <q>'and b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng all the water-bottles.'</q>
                There was a stream at the foot of the hill. They filled their bottles and the small
                camping kettle at a little fall where the water fell <name type="QUANTITY">a few feet</name> over an outcrop of
                <name type="ORG">grey st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name></name>. It was icy cold; and they spluttered and puf<name type="ORG">fed</name> as they bathed their
                faces and hands.</p>
            <p>When their breakfast was over, and their packs all trussed up again, it was after <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>
                o'clock, and the <name type="DATE">day</name> was beginning to turn fine and hot. They went down the slope,
                and across the stream where it dived under the road, and up the next slope, and up
                and down another shoulder of the hills; and by that time their cloaks, blankets,
                water, food, and other gear already seemed a heavy burden.</p>
            <p><name type="DATE">The <name type="DATE">day</name></name>'s <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ch promised to be warm and ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng work. After some miles, however, the
                road ceased to roll up and down: it climbed to the top of a steep bank in a weary
                zig-zagging sort of way, and then prepared to go down for the last time. In front of
                them they saw the lower lands dotted with small clumps of trees that melted away in
                the distance to a brown woodland haze. They were looking across the <name type="PERSON">Wood</name>y End
                towards the <name type="ORG">Brand</name>ywine <name type="LOC">River</name>. The road wound away before them like a piece of
                st<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng.</p>
            <p><q>'The road goes on for ever,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>; <q>'but I can't without a rest. It
                    is high time for lunch.'</q> He sat down on the bank at the side of the road and
                looked away east into the haze, beyond which lay the <name type="LOC">River</name>, and the end of the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>
                in which he had spent all his life. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> stood by him. His round eyes were wide open
                � for he was looking across lands he had never seen to a new ho<name type="GPE">ri</name>zon.</p>
            <p><q>'Do <name type="ORG">Elves</name> live in those woods?'</q> he asked.</p>
            <p><q>'Not that I ever heard,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> was silent. He too was gazing
                eastward along the road, as if he had never seen it before. Suddenly he spoke, aloud
                but as if to himself, saying slowly:</p>
            <p>The <name type="FAC">Road</name> goes ever on and on</p>
            <p>Down from the door where it began.</p>
            <p>Now far ahead the <name type="FAC">Road</name> has g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>,</p>
            <p>And I must follow, if I can,</p>
            <p>Pursuing it with weary feet,</p>
            <p>Until it joins some larger way,</p>
            <p>Where many paths and errands meet.</p>
            <p>And whither then? I cannot say.</p>
            <p><q>'That sounds like a bit of old <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>'s rhyming,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q>'Or is it <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>
                    of your imitations? It does not sound altogether encouraging.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t know,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. It came to me then, as if I was making it up; but
                I may have heard it <name type="DATE">long ago</name>. Certainly it reminds me very much of <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> in the last
                <name type="DATE">year</name>s, before he went away. He used of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> to say there was only <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> <name type="FAC">Road</name>; that it
                was like a great <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver: its sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ngs were at every doorstep, and every path was its
                t<name type="GPE">ri</name>butary. "It's a dangerous business, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, going out of your door," he used to
                say. "You step into the <name type="FAC">Road</name>, and if you <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t keep your feet, there is no knowing
                where you might be swept off to. Do you realize that this is the very path that goes
                through <name type="GPE">Mirkwood</name>, and that if you let it, it might take you to the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>nely <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>
                or even further and to worse places?" He used to say that on the path outside the
                front door at <name type="FAC">Bag End</name>, especially after he had been out for a long walk.'</p>
            <p><q>'Well, the <name type="FAC">Road</name> won't sweep me anywhere for <name type="TIME">an <name type="TIME">hour</name></name> at least,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>,
                unslinging his pack. The others followed his example, putting their packs against
                the bank and their legs out into the road. After a rest they had a good lunch, and
                then more rest.</p>
            <p>The sun was beginning to get low and the light of <name type="TIME">after<name type="TIME">noon</name></name> was on the land as they
                went down the hill. So far they had not met a soul on the road. This way was not
                much used, being hardly fit for carts, and there was little traffic to the <name type="PERSON">Wood</name>y
                End. They had been jogging along again for <name type="TIME">an <name type="TIME">hour</name></name> or more when <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> stopped a moment
                as if lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing. They were now on level ground, and the road after much winding lay
                straight ahead through grass-land sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>nkled with tall trees, outliers of the
                approa<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g woods.</p>
            <p><q>'I can hear a pony or a horse coming along the road behind,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>.</p>
            <p>They looked back, but the turn of the road prevented them from seeing far. <q>'I
                    wonder if that is <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> coming after us,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>; but even as he said
                it, he had a feeling that it was not so, and a sudden desire to hide from the view
                of the <name type="GPE">ri</name>der came over him.</p>
            <p><q>'It may not matter much,'</q> he said apologetically, <q>'but I would rather not
                    be seen on the road � by any<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. I am sick of my doings being noticed and
                    discussed. And if it is <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>,'</q> he added as an afterthought, <q>'we can
                    give him a little surp<name type="GPE">ri</name>se, to pay him out for being so late. Let's get out of
                    sight!'</q></p>
            <p>The other <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> ran quickly to the left and down into a little hollow not far from the
                road. There they lay flat. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> hesitated for a <name type="ORG">sec</name>ond: cu<name type="GPE">ri</name>osity or some other
                feeling was struggling with his desire to hide. The sound of hoofs drew nearer. Just
                in time he threw himself down in a patch of long grass behind a tree that
                overshadowed the road. Then he lifted his head and peered cautiously above <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of
                the great roots.</p>
            <p>Round the corner came a black horse, no hobbit-pony but a full-sized horse; and on it
                sat a large man, who seemed to crouch in the saddle, wrapped in a great black cloak
                and hood, so that only his boots in the high stirrups showed below; his face was
                shadowed and invisible.</p>
            <p>When it reached the tree and was level with <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> the horse stopped. The <name type="GPE">ri</name>ding
                figure sat quite still with its head bowed, as if lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing. From inside the hood
                came a noise as of some<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> sniffing to catch an elusive scent; the head turned from
                side to side of the road.</p>
            <p>A sudden unreasoning fear of discovery laid hold of <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, and he thought of his
                <name type="ORG">Ring</name>. He hardly dared to breathe, and yet the desire to get it out of his pocket
                became so strong that he began slowly to move his hand. He felt that he had only to
                slip it on, and then he would be safe. The advice of <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> seemed absurd. <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>
                had used the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>. <q>'And I am still in the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>,'</q> he thought, as his hand
                touched the c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>n on which it hung. At that moment the <name type="GPE">ri</name>der sat up, and shook the
                reins. The horse stepped forward, walking slowly at <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>, and then breaking into a
                quick trot.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> crawled to the edge of the road and watched the <name type="GPE">ri</name>der, until he dwindled into
                the distance. He could not be quite sure, but it seemed to him that suddenly, before
                it passed out of sight, the horse turned aside and went into the trees on the
                <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght.</p>
            <p><q>'Well, I call that very queer, and indeed disturbing,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> to himself,
                as he walked towards his companions. <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> had remained flat in the grass,
                and had seen nothing; so <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> desc<name type="GPE">ri</name>bed the <name type="GPE">ri</name>der and his strange behaviour.</p>
            <p>
                <q>'I can't say why, but I felt certain he was looking or _smelling_ for me; and
                    also I felt certain that I did not <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t him to discover me. I've never seen or
                    fell anything like it in the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> before.'</q>
            </p>
            <p><q>'But what has <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the <name type="ORG">Big People</name> got to do with us?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q>'And
                    what is he doing in this part of the world?'</q></p>
            <p><q>'There are some <name type="ORG">Men</name> about,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'Down in the <name type="LOC">South</name>farthing they
                    have had trouble with <name type="ORG">Big People</name>, I believe. But I have never heard of anything
                    like this <name type="GPE">ri</name>der. I wonder where he comes from.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Begging your par<name type="PERSON">don</name>,'</q> put in <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> suddenly, <q>'I know where he comes from.
                    It's from <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbiton that this here black <name type="GPE">ri</name>der comes, unless there's more than
                    <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. And I know where he's going to.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'What do you mean?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> sharply, looking at him in astonishment.
                    <q>'Why didn't you speak up before?'</q></p>
            <p>'I have only just remembered, sir. It was like this: when I got back to our hole
                yester<name type="DATE">day</name> <name type="TIME">evening</name> with the key, my dad, he says to me: _Hello, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>!_ he says. _I
                thought you were away with Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> this <name type="TIME">morning</name>. There's been a strange cus<name type="PERSON">tom</name>er
                asking for Mr. <name type="PERSON">Baggins</name> of <name type="FAC">Bag End</name>, and he's only just g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. I've sent him on to
                <name type="ORG">Bucklebury</name>. Not that I liked the sound of him. He seemed mighty put out, when I told
                him Mr. <name type="PERSON">Baggins</name> had left his old home for good. Hissed at me, he did. It gave me
                quite a shudder. What sort of a fellow was he?_ says I to the <name type="PERSON">Gaffer</name>. _I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t
                know,_ says he; _but he wasn't a hobbit. He was tall and black-like, and he stooped
                aver me. I reckon it was <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the Big Folk from foreign parts. He spoke
                funny._</p>
            <p>
                <q>'I couldn't stay to hear more, sir, since you were waiting; and I didn't give
                    much heed to it myself. The <name type="PERSON">Gaffer</name> is getting old, and more than a bit blind,
                    and it must have been near dark when this fellow come up the <name type="ORG">Hill</name> and found him
                    taking the air at the end of our Row. I hope he hasn't <name type="PERSON">don</name>e no harm, sir, nor
                    me.'</q>
            </p>
            <p><q>'The <name type="PERSON">Gaffer</name> can't be blamed anyway,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'As a matter of fact I
                    heard him talking to a stranger, who seemed to be inqui<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng for me, and I nearly
                    went and asked him who it was. I wish I had, or you had told me about it before.
                    I might have been more careful on the road.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Still, there may be no connexion between this <name type="GPE">ri</name>der and the <name type="PERSON">Gaffer</name>'s
                    stranger,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q>'We left <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbiton <name type="ORG">sec</name>retly enough, and I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t
                    see how he could have followed us.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'What about the _smelling,_ sir?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <q>'And the <name type="PERSON">Gaffer</name> said he was a
                    black chap.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'I wish I had waited for <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>,'</q> <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> muttered. <q>'But perhaps it would
                    only have made matters worse.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Then you know or guess something about this <name type="GPE">ri</name>der?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>, who had
                caught the muttered words.</p>
            <p><q>'I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t know, and I would rather not guess,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'All <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght,
                    cousin <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>! You can keep your <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret for the present, if you <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t to be
                    myste<name type="GPE">ri</name>ous. In the meanwhile what are we to do? I should like a bite and a sup,
                    but somehow I think we had better move on from here. Your talk of sniffing
                    <name type="GPE">ri</name>ders with invisible noses has unsettled me.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Yes, I think we will move on now,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>; <q>'but not on the road -in
                    case that <name type="GPE">ri</name>der comes back, or another follows him. We ought to do a good step
                    more to<name type="DATE">day</name>. <name type="PERSON">Buckland</name> is still miles away.'</q></p>
            <p>The shadows of the trees were long and thin on the grass, as they started off again.
                They now kept a st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>'s throw to the left of the road, and kept out of sight of it
                as much as they could. But this hindered them; for the grass was thick and tussocky,
                and the ground uneven, and the trees began to draw together into thickets.</p>
            <p>The sun had g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> down red behind the hills at their backs, and <name type="TIME">evening</name> was coming on
                before they came back to the road at the end of the long level over which it had run
                straight for some miles. At that point it bent left and went down into the lowlands
                of the <name type="ORG">Yale</name> making for <name type="ORG">Stock</name>; but a lane branched <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght, winding through a wood of
                ancient oak-trees on its way to <name type="PERSON">Wood</name>hall. <q>'That is the way for us,'</q> said
                <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.</p>
            <p>Not far from the road-meeting they came on the huge hulk of a tree: it was still
                alive and had leaves on the small branches that it had put out round the broken
                stumps of its long-fallen limbs; but it was hollow, and could be entered by a great
                crack on the side away from the road. The hobbits crept inside, and sat there upon a
                floor of old leaves and decayed wood. They rested and had a light meal, talking
                quietly and lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing from time to time.</p>
            <p><name type="WORK_OF_ART">Twilight</name> was about them as they crept back to the lane. The <name type="LOC">West</name> wind was sighing in
                the branches. Leaves were whispe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng. Soon the road began to fall gently but
                steadily into the <name type="TIME">dusk</name>. A star came out above the trees in the darkening <name type="LOC">East</name> before
                them. They went abreast and in step, to keep up their spi<name type="GPE">ri</name>ts. After a time, as the
                stars grew thicker and b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ghter, the feeling of disquiet left them, and they no
                longer lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed for the sound of hoofs. They began to hum softly, as hobbits have a
                way of doing as they walk along, especially when they are drawing near to home at
                <name type="TIME">night</name>. With most hobbits it is a supper-song or a bed-song; but these hobbits hummed
                a walking-song (though not, of course, without any mention of supper and bed). <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>
                <name type="PERSON">Baggins</name> had made the words, to a tune that was as old as the hills, and taught it to
                <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> as they walked in the lanes of the Water-valley and talked about
                <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Adventure</name>.</p>
            <p>Upon the h<name type="LOC">earth</name> the fire is red,</p>
            <p>Beneath the roof there is a bed;</p>
            <p>But not yet weary are our feet,</p>

            <p>Until the stars are all alight.</p>
            <p>Then world behind and home ahead,</p>

            <p>Mist and <name type="TIME">twilight</name>, cloud and shade,</p>
            <p>Away shall fade! Away shall fade!</p>
            <p><name type="ORG">Fire</name> and lamp, and meat and bread,</p>
            <p>And then to bed! And then to bed!</p>
            <p>The song ended. <q>'And _now_ to bed! And _now_ to bed!'</q> sang <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> in a high
                voice.</p>
            <p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Hush</name>!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'I think I hear hoofs again.'</q></p>
            <p>They slopped suddenly and stood as silent as tree-shadows, lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing. There was a
                sound of hoofs in the lane, some way behind, but coming slow and clear down the
                wind. Quickly and quietly they slipped off the path, and ran into the deeper shade
                under the oak-trees.</p>
            <p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Don</name>'t let us go too far!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t to be seen, but I <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t
                    to see if it is another <name type="ORG">Black</name> <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Very well!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q>'But <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t forget the sniffing!'</q></p>
            <p>The hoofs drew nearer. They had no time to find any hiding-place better than the
                general darkness under the trees; <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> crouched behind a large tree-bole,
                while <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> crept back <name type="QUANTITY">a few yards</name> towards the lane. It showed grey and pale, a line
                of fading light through the wood. Above it the stars were thick in the dim sky, but
                there was no moon.</p>
            <p>The sound of hoofs stopped. As <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> watched he saw something dark pass across the
                lighter space <name type="CARDINAL">between <name type="CARDINAL">two</name></name> trees, and then halt. It looked like the black shade of a
                horse led by a smaller black shadow. The black shadow stood close to the point where
                they had left the path, and it swayed from side to side. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> thought he heard the
                sound of snuffling. The shadow bent to the ground, and then began to crawl towards
                him.</p>
            <p>Once more the desire to slip on the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> came over <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>; but this time it was
                stronger than before. So strong that, almost before he realized what he was doing,
                his hand was groping in his pocket. But at that moment there came a sound like
                mingled song and laughter. Clear voices rose and fell in the starlit air. The black
                shadow straigh<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed up and retreated. It climbed on to the shadowy horse and seemed
                to vanish across the lane into the darkness on the other side. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> breathed
                again.</p>
            <p><q>'<name type="ORG">Elves</name>!'</q> exclaimed <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> in a hoarse whisper. <q>'<name type="ORG">Elves</name>, sir!'</q> He would have
                burst out of the trees and dashed off towards the voices, if they had not pulled him
                back.</p>
            <p><q>'Yes, it is <name type="ORG">Elves</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'<name type="CARDINAL">One</name> can meet them sometimes in the <name type="PERSON">Wood</name>y
                    End. They <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t live in the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>, but they <name type="PERSON">wan</name>der into it in <name type="DATE">Sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng</name> and <name type="DATE">Autumn</name>,
                    out of their own lands away beyond the <name type="FAC">Tower</name> <name type="ORG">Hill</name>s. I am thankful that they do!
                    You did not see, but that <name type="ORG">Black</name> <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name> stopped just here and was actually
                    crawling towards us when the song began. As soon as he heard the voices he
                    slipped away.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'What about the <name type="ORG">Elves</name>?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, too excited to trouble about the <name type="GPE">ri</name>der.
                    <q>'Can't we go and see them?'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>! They are coming this way,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'We have only to wait.'</q>
                The singing drew nearer. <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> clear voice rose now above the others. It was singing
                in the fair <name type="ORG">elven</name>-tongue, of which <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> knew only a little, and the others knew
                nothing. Yet the sound blending with the melody seemed to shape itself in their
                thought into words which they only partly understood. This was the song as <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>
                heard it:</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Snow</name>-white! <name type="PERSON">Snow</name>-white! O <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> clear!</p>
            <p>O Queen beyond the <name type="LOC">West</name>ern <name type="LOC">Sea</name>s!</p>
            <p>O Light to us that <name type="PERSON">wan</name>der here</p>
            <p>Amid the world of woven trees!</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Gilthoniel</name>! O <name type="PERSON">Elbereth</name>!</p>
            <p>Clear are thy eyes and b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght thy breath!</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Snow</name>-white! <name type="PERSON">Snow</name>-white! We sing to thee</p>
            <p>In a far land beyond the <name type="LOC">Sea</name>.</p>
            <p>O stars that in the <name type="ORG">Sun</name>less Year</p>
            <p>With shining hand by her were sawn,</p>
            <p>In windy fields now b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght and clear</p>
            <p>We see your silver blossom blown!</p>
            <p>O <name type="PERSON">Elbereth</name>! <name type="PERSON">Gilthoniel</name>!</p>
            <p>We still remember, we who dwell</p>
            <p>In this far land beneath the trees,</p>
            <p>Thy starlight on the <name type="LOC">West</name>ern <name type="LOC">Sea</name>s.</p>
            <p>The song ended. <q>'These are High <name type="ORG">Elves</name>! They spoke the name of <name type="PERSON">Elbereth</name>!'</q> said
                <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> in amazement, <q>'Few of that fairest folk are ever seen in the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>. Not
                    many now remain in <name type="LOC">Middle-<name type="LOC">earth</name></name>, east of the Great <name type="LOC">Sea</name>. This is indeed a strange
                    chance!'</q></p>
            <p>The hobbits sat in shadow by the wayside. Before long the <name type="ORG">Elves</name> came down the lane
                towards the valley. They passed slowly, and the hobbits could see the starlight
                glimme<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng on their <name type="PERSON">hai</name>r and in their eyes. They bore no lights, yet as they walked
                a shimmer, like the light of the moon above the <name type="GPE">ri</name>m of the hills before it <name type="GPE">ri</name>ses,
                seemed to fall about their feet. They were now silent, and as the last <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name> passed he
                turned and looked towards the hobbits and laughed.</p>
            <p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Hail</name>, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>!'</q> he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed. <q>'You are abroad late. Or are you perhaps
                    lost?'</q> Then he called aloud to the others, and all the company stopped and
                gathered round.</p>
            <p><q>'This is indeed wonderful!'</q> they said. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Thr</name>ee hobbits in a wood at <name type="TIME">night</name>!
                    We have not seen such a thing since <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> went away. What is the meaning of
                    it?'</q></p>
            <p><q>'The meaning of it, fair people,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, <q>'is simply that we seem to be
                    going the same way as you are. I like walking under the stars. But I would
                    welcome your company.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'But we have no need of other company, and hobbits are so dull,'</q> they laughed.
                    <q>'And how do you know that we go the same way as you, for you do not know
                    whither we are going?'</q></p>
            <p><q>'And how do you know my name?'</q> asked <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> in return.</p>
            <p><q>'We know many things,'</q> they said. <q>'We have seen you of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> before with
                    <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>, though you may not have seen us.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Who are you, and who is your lord?'</q> asked <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.</p>
            <p><q>'I am <name type="PERSON">Gildor</name>,'</q> answered their leader, the <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name> who had <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> <name type="PERSON">hai</name>led him.
                    <q>'<name type="PERSON">Gildor</name> Inglo<name type="GPE">ri</name>on of the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>use of <name type="PERSON">Finrod</name>. We are <name type="ORG">Exiles</name>, and most of our
                    kindred have <name type="DATE">long ago</name> departed and we too are now only tarrying here a while,
                    ere we return over the Great <name type="LOC">Sea</name>. But some of our kinsfolk dwell still in peace
                    in <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name>. Come now, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, tell us what you are doing? For we see that there
                    is some shadow of fear upon you.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'O <name type="PERSON">Wise</name> People!'</q> interrupted <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> eagerly. <q>'Tell us about the <name type="ORG">Black</name>
                    <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s!'</q></p>
            <p><q>'<name type="ORG">Black</name> <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s?'</q> they said in low voices. <q>'Why do you ask about <name type="ORG">Black</name>
                    <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s?'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Because <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> <name type="ORG">Black</name> <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s have overtaken us to<name type="DATE">day</name>, or <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> has <name type="PERSON">don</name>e so twice,'</q>
                said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>; <q>'only a little while ago he slipped away as you drew near.'</q></p>
            <p>The <name type="ORG">Elves</name> did not answer at once, but spoke together softly in their own tongue. At
                length <name type="PERSON">Gildor</name> turned to the hobbits. <q>'We will not speak of this here,'</q> he
                said. <q>'We think you had best come now with us. It is not our cus<name type="PERSON">tom</name>, but for this
                    time we will lake you on our road, and you shall lodge with us to<name type="TIME">night</name>, if you
                    will.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'O <name type="ORG">Fair</name> Folk! This is good fortune beyond my hope,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> was
                speechless. <q>'I thank you indeed, <name type="PERSON">Gildor</name> Inglo<name type="GPE">ri</name>on,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> bowing. _'<name type="PERSON">Elen</name>
                s�la l�menn' omentielvo,_ a star shines on the <name type="TIME">hour</name> of our meeting,' he added in the
                high-<name type="ORG">elven</name> speech.</p>
            <p><q>'Be careful, f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Gildor</name> laughing. <q>'Speak no <name type="ORG">sec</name>rets! Here is a
                    scholar in the Ancient Tongue. <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> was a good master. <name type="PERSON">Hail</name>, <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name>-f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end!'</q>
                he said, bowing to <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'Come now with your f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends and join our company! You
                    had best walk in the middle so that you may not stray. You may be weary before
                    we halt.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Why? Where are you going?'</q> asked <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.</p>
            <p>
                <q>'For to<name type="TIME">night</name> we go to the woods on the hills above <name type="PERSON">Wood</name>hall. It is some miles,
                    but you shall have rest at the end of it, and it will shor<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> your journey
                    to<name type="DATE">morrow</name>.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>They now <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ched on again in silence, and passed like shadows and faint lights: for
                <name type="ORG">Elves</name> (even more than hobbits) could walk when they wished without sound or
                footfall. <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> soon began to feel sleepy, and staggered once or twice; but each
                time a tall <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name> at his side put out his arm and saved him from a fall. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> walked
                along at <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s side, as if in a dream, with an expression on his face <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> of fear
                and <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> of astonished joy.</p>
            <p>The woods on either side became denser; the trees were now younger and thicker; and
                as the lane went lower, running down into a fold of the hills, there were many deep
                brakes of hazel on the <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing slopes at either hand. At last the <name type="ORG">Elves</name> turned aside
                from the path. A green <name type="GPE">ri</name>de lay almost unseen through the thickets on the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght; and
                this they followed as it wound away back up the wooded slopes on to the top of a
                shoulder of the hills that stood out into the lower land of the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver-valley.
                Suddenly they came out of the shadow of the trees, and before them lay a wide space
                of grass, grey under the <name type="TIME">night</name>. On <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> sides the woods pressed upon it; but
                eastward the ground fell steeply and the tops of the dark trees, growing at the
                bot<name type="PERSON">tom</name> of the slope, were below their feet. Beyond, the low lands lay dim and flat
                under the stars. Nearer at hand a few lights twinkled in the village of
                <name type="PERSON">Wood</name>hall.</p>
            <p>The <name type="ORG">Elves</name> sat on the grass and spoke together in soft voices; they seemed to take no
                further notice of the hobbits. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and his companions wrapped themselves in cloaks
                and blankets, and drowsiness stole over them. <name type="TIME">The <name type="TIME">night</name></name> grew on, and the lights in
                the valley went out. <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> fell asleep, pillowed on a green hillock.</p>
            <p>Away high in the <name type="LOC">East</name> swung <name type="PRODUCT">Remmirath</name>, the Netted <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Stars</name>, and slowly above the mists
                red <name type="PERSON">Borgil</name> rose, glowing like a jewel of fire. Then by some shift of airs all the
                mist was drawn away like a veil, and there leaned up, as he climbed over the <name type="GPE">ri</name>m of
                the world, the <name type="PRODUCT">Sword</name>sman of the <name type="PRODUCT">Sky</name>, <name type="ORG">Men</name>elvagor with his shining belt. The <name type="ORG">Elves</name> all
                burst into song. Suddenly under the trees a fire sprang up with a red light.</p>
            <p><q>'Come!'</q> the <name type="ORG">Elves</name> called to the hobbits. <q>'Come! Now is the time for speech
                    and mer<name type="GPE">ri</name>ment!'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> sat up and rubbed his eyes. He shivered. <q>'There is a fire in the hall, and
                    food for hungry guests,'</q> said an <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name> standing before him.</p>
            <p>At the south end of the greensward there was an opening. There the green floor ran on
                into the wood, and formed a wide space like a hall, roo<name type="ORG">fed</name> by the boughs of trees.
                Their great trunks ran like pillars down each side. In the middle there was a
                wood-fire blazing, and upon the tree-pillars torches with lights of gold and silver
                were burning steadily. The <name type="ORG">Elves</name> sat round the fire upon the grass or upon the sawn
                <name type="GPE">ri</name>ngs of old trunks. Some went to and fro bea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng cups and pou<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk; others
                brought food on heaped plates and dishes.</p>
            <p><q>'This is poor fare,'</q> they said to the hobbits; <q>'for we are lodging in the
                    <name type="PERSON">greenwood</name> far from our halls. If ever you are our guests at home, we will treat
                    you better.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'It seems to me good enough for a birth<name type="DATE">day</name>-party,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> afterwards recalled little of either food or d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk, for his mind was filled
                with the light upon the elf-faces, and the sound of voices so va<name type="GPE">ri</name>ous and so
                beautiful that he felt in a waking dream. But he remembered that there was bread,
                surpassing the savour of a fair white loaf to <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> who is starving; and fruits sweet
                as wildber<name type="GPE">ri</name>es and <name type="GPE">ri</name>cher than the <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ded fruits of gardens; he drained a cup that
                was filled with a fragrant draught, cool as a clear fountain, golden as a <name type="DATE">summer</name>
                <name type="TIME">after<name type="TIME">noon</name></name>.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> could never desc<name type="GPE">ri</name>be in words, nor picture clearly to himself, what he felt or
                thought that <name type="TIME">night</name>, though it remained in his memory as <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the chief events of
                his life. The nearest he ever got was to say: <q>'Well, sir, if I could grow apples
                    like that, I would call myself a gardener. But it was the singing that went to
                    my heart, if you know what I mean.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> sat, eating, d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nking, and talking with delight; but his mind was chiefly on
                the words spoken. He knew a little of the elf-speech and lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed eagerly. Now and
                again he spoke to those that served him and thanked them in their own language. They
                smiled at him and said laughing: <q>'Here is a jewel among hobbits!'</q></p>
            <p>After a while <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> fell fast asleep, and was lifted up and borne away to a bower
                under the trees; there he was laid upon a soft bed and slept the rest of the <name type="TIME">night</name>
                away. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> refused to leave his master. When <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> had g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, he came and sat curled
                up at <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s feet, where at last he nodded and closed his eyes. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> remained long
                awake, talking with <name type="PERSON">Gildor</name>.</p>
            <p>They spoke of many things, old and new, and <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> questi<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>d <name type="PERSON">Gildor</name> much about
                happenings in the wide world outside the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>. The tidings were mostly sad and
                ominous: of gathe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng darkness, the wars of <name type="ORG">Men</name>, and the flight of the <name type="ORG">Elves</name>. At
                last <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> asked the question that was nearest to his heart:</p>
            <p>
                <q>'Tell me, <name type="PERSON">Gildor</name>, have you ever seen <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> since he left us?'</q>
            </p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Gildor</name> smiled. <q>'Yes,'</q> he answered. <q>'Twice. He said farewell to us on this
                    very spot. But I saw him once again, far from here.'</q> He would say no more
                about <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>, and <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> fell silent.</p>
            <p><q>'You do not ask me or tell me much that concerns yourself, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>,'</q> said
                <name type="PERSON">Gildor</name>. <q>'But I already know a little, and I can read more in your face and in the
                    thought behind your questions. You are leaving the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>, and yet you doubt that
                    you will find what you seek, or accomplish what you in<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>d, or that you will
                    ever return. Is not that so?'</q></p>
            <p><q>'It is,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>; <q>'but I thought my going was a <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret known only to
                    <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> and my faithful <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>.'</q> He looked down at <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, who was sno<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng
                gently.</p>
            <p><q>'The <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret will not reach the Enemy from us,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gildor</name>.</p>
            <p><q>'The Enemy?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'Then you know why I am leaving the
                <name type="LOC">Shire</name>?'</q></p>
            <p><q>'I do not know for what reason the Enemy is pursuing you,'</q> answered <name type="PERSON">Gildor</name>;
                    <q>'but I perceive that he is � strange indeed though that seems to me. And I
                    warn you that pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>l is now both before you and behind you, and upon either
                    side.'</q></p>
            <p>
                <q>'You mean the <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s? I feared that they were servants of the Enemy. What _are_
                    the <name type="ORG">Black</name> <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s?'</q>
            </p>
            <p>
                <q>'Has <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> told you nothing?'</q>
            </p>
            <p>
                <q>'Nothing about such creatures.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>
                <q>'Then I think it is not for me to say more � lest terror should keep you from
                    your journey. For it seems to me that you have set out only just in time, if
                    indeed you are in time. You must now make haste, and neither stay nor turn back;
                    for the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> is no longer any protection to you.'</q>
            </p>
            <p><q>'I cannot imagine what information could be more ter<name type="GPE">ri</name>fying than your hints and
                    warnings,'</q> exclaimed <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'I knew that danger lay ahead, of course; but
                    I did not expect to meet it in our own <name type="LOC">Shire</name>. Can't a hobbit walk from the Water
                    to the <name type="LOC">River</name> in peace?'</q></p>
            <p><q>'But it is not your own <name type="LOC">Shire</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gildor</name>. <q>'Others dwelt here before
                    hobbits were; and others will dwell here again when hobbits are no more. The
                    wide world is all about you: you can <name type="PERSON">fen</name>ce yourselves in, but you cannot for
                    ever <name type="PERSON">fen</name>ce it out.'</q></p>
            <p>
                <q>'I know � and yet it has always seemed so safe and familiar. What can I do now?
                    My plan was to leave the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> <name type="ORG">sec</name>retly, and make my way to <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name>; but now
                    my footsteps are dogged, before ever I get to <name type="PERSON">Buckland</name>.'</q>
            </p>
            <p><q>'I think you should still follow that plan,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gildor</name>. <q>'I do not think
                    the <name type="FAC">Road</name> will prove too hard for your courage. But if you desire clearer
                    counsel, you should ask <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. I do not know the reason for your flight, and
                    therefore I do not know by what means your pursuers will assail you. These
                    things <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> must know. I suppose that you will see him before you leave the
                    <name type="LOC">Shire</name>?'</q></p>
            <p>
                <q>'I hope so. But that is another thing that makes me anxious. I have been
                    expecting <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> for m<name type="DATE">any <name type="DATE">day</name></name>s. He was to have come to <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbiton at the latest
                    <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> <name type="TIME">night</name>s ago; but he has never appeared. Now I am wonde<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng what can have
                    happened. Should I wait for him?'</q>
            </p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Gildor</name> was silent for a moment. <q>'I do not like this news,'</q> he said at last.
                    <q>'That <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> should be late, does not bode well. But it is said: _Do not
                    meddle in the affairs of <name type="ORG">Wizard</name>s, for they are subtle and quick to anger._ The
                    choice is yours: to go or wait.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'And it is also said,'</q> answered <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>: <q>'Go _not to the <name type="ORG">Elves</name> for counsel,
                    for they will say both no and yes.'</q>_</p>
            <p><q>'Is it indeed?'</q> laughed <name type="PERSON">Gildor</name>. <q>'<name type="ORG">Elves</name> seldom give unguarded advice, for
                    advice is a dangerous gift, even from the wise to the wise, and all courses may
                    run ill. But what would you? You have not told me all concerning yourself; and
                    how then shall I choose better than you? But if you demand advice, I will for
                    f<name type="GPE">ri</name>endship's sake give it. I think you should now go at once, without delay; and
                    if <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> does not come before you set out, then I also advise this: do not go
                    al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. Take such f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends as are trusty and willing. Now you should be grateful,
                    for I do not give this counsel gladly. The <name type="ORG">Elves</name> have their own labours and
                    their own sorrows, and they are little concerned with the ways of hobbits, or of
                    any other creatures upon <name type="LOC">earth</name>. Our paths cross theirs seldom, by chance or
                    purpose. In this meeting there may be more than chance; but the purpose is not
                    clear to me, and I fear to say too much.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'I am deeply grateful,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>; <q>'but I wish you would tell me plainly
                    what the <name type="ORG">Black</name> <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s are. If I take your advice I may not see <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> for a
                    long while, and I ought to know what is the danger that pursues me.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Is it not enough to know that they are servants of the Enemy?'</q> answered
                <name type="PERSON">Gildor</name>. <q>'Flee them! Speak no words to them! They are deadly. Ask no more of me!
                    But my heart forbodes that, ere all is ended, you, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> son of <name type="ORG">Drogo</name>, will know
                    more of these fell things than <name type="PERSON">Gildor</name> Inglo<name type="GPE">ri</name>on. <name type="DATE">May</name> <name type="PERSON">Elbereth</name> protect
                you!'</q></p>
            <p><q>'But where shall I find courage?'</q> asked <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'That is what I chiefly
                    need.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'<name type="ORG">Courage</name> is found in unlikely places,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gildor</name>. <q>'Be of good hope! Sleep
                    now! In the <name type="TIME">morning</name> we shall have g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>; but we will send our messages through
                    the lands. <name type="ORG">The Wande<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng Companies</name> shall know of your journey, and those that
                    have power for good shall be on the watch. I name you <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name>-f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end; and may the
                    stars shine upon the end of your road! Seldom have we had such delight in
                    strangers, and it is fair to hear words of the Ancient <name type="ORG">Speech</name> from the lips of
                    other <name type="PERSON">wan</name>derers in the world.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> felt sleep coming upon him, even as <name type="PERSON">Gildor</name> finished speaking. <q>'I will sleep
                    now,'</q> he said; and the <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name> led him to a bower beside <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>, and he threw
                himself upon a bed and fell at once into a dreamless slumber.</p>

            <p>A Short Cut to Mushrooms</p>
            <p>In the <name type="TIME">morning</name> <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> woke refreshed. He was lying in a bower made by a living tree
                with branches laced and drooping to the ground; his bed was of fern and grass, deep
                and soft and strangely fragrant. The sun was shining through the flutte<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng leaves,
                which were still green upon the tree. He jumped up and went out.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> was sitting on the grass near the edge of the wood. <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> was standing studying
                the sky and weather. There was no sign of the <name type="ORG">Elves</name>.</p>
            <p><q>'They have left us fruit and d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk, and bread,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q>'Come and have
                    your breakfast. The bread tastes almost as good as it did <name type="TIME">last <name type="TIME">night</name></name>. I did not
                    <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t to leave you any, but <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> insisted.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> sat down beside <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> and began to eat. <q>'What is the plan for to<name type="DATE">day</name>?'</q>
                asked <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>.</p>
            <p><q>'To walk to <name type="ORG">Bucklebury</name> as quickly as possible,'</q> answered <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, and gave his
                at<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>tion to the food.</p>
            <p><q>'Do you think we shall see anything of those <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s?'</q> asked <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> cheerfully.
                Under the <name type="TIME">morning</name> sun the prospect of seeing a whole troop of them did not seem very
                alarming to him.</p>
            <p><q>'Yes, probably,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, not liking the reminder. <q>'But I hope to get
                    across the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver without their seeing us.'</q></p>
            <p>
                <q>'Did you find out anything about them from <name type="PERSON">Gildor</name>?'</q>
            </p>
            <p><q>'Not much � only hints and <name type="GPE">ri</name>ddles,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> evasively. <q>'Did you ask
                    about the sniffing?'</q></p>
            <p><q>'We didn't discuss it,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> with his mouth full.</p>
            <p>
                <q>'You should have. I am sure it is very imp<name type="GPE">ortan</name>t.'</q>
            </p>
            <p><q>'In that case I am sure <name type="PERSON">Gildor</name> would have refused to explain it,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>
                sharply. <q>'And now leave me in peace for a bit! I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t to answer a st<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng of
                    questions while I am eating. I <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t to think!'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Good heavens!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q>'At breakfast?'</q> He walked away towards the
                edge of the green.</p>
            <p>From <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s mind the b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght <name type="TIME">morning</name> � treacherously b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght, he thought � had not
                banished the fear of pursuit; and he pondered the words of <name type="PERSON">Gildor</name>. The merry voice
                of <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> came to him. He was running on the green turf and singing.</p>
            <p><q>'No! I could not!'</q> he said to himself. <q>'It is <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> thing to take my young
                    f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends walking over the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> with me, until we are hungry and weary, and food
                    and bed are sweet. To take them into exile, where hunger and wea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ness may have
                    no cure, is quite another � even if they are willing to come. The inhe<name type="GPE">ri</name>tance is
                    mine al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t think I ought even to take <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>.'</q> He looked at <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>
                <name type="PERSON">Gamgee</name>, and discovered that <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> was wat<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g him.</p>
            <p><q>'Well, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>!'</q> he said. <q>'What about it? I am leaving the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> as soon as
                    ever I can � in fact I have made up my mind now not even to wait <name type="DATE">a <name type="DATE">day</name></name> at
                    <name type="ORG">C<name type="GPE">ri</name>ckhollow</name>, if it can be helped.'</q></p>
            <p>
                <q>'Very good, sir!'</q>
            </p>
            <p>
                <q>'You still mean to come with me?'</q>
            </p>
            <p>
                <q>'I do.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>
                <q>'It is going to be very dangerous, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. 'It is already dangerous. Most likely
                    neither of us will come back.'</q>
            </p>
            <p><q>'If you <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t come back, sir, then I shan't, that's certain,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>.
                _'<name type="PERSON">Don</name>'t you leave him!_ they said to me. _Leave him!_ I said. _I never mean to. I am
                going with him, if he climbs to the <name type="PERSON">Moon</name>, and if any of those <name type="ORG">Black</name> Rulers try to
                stop him, they'll have <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> <name type="PERSON">Gamgee</name> to reckon with,_ I said. They laughed.'</p>
            <p>
                <q>'Who are _they,_ and what are you talking about?'</q>
            </p>
            <p>
                <q>'The <name type="ORG">Elves</name>, sir. We had some talk <name type="TIME">last <name type="TIME">night</name></name>; and they seemed to know you were
                    going away, so I didn't see the use of denying it. Wonderful folk, <name type="ORG">Elves</name>, sir!
                    Wonderful!'</q>
            </p>
            <p><q>'They are,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'Do you like them still, now you have had a closer
                    view?'</q></p>
            <p><q>'They seem a bit above my likes and dislikes, so to speak,'</q> answered <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>
                slowly. <q>'It <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t seem to matter what I think about them. They are quite
                    different from what I expected � so old and young, and so gay and sad, as it
                    were.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> looked at <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> rather startled, <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> expecting to see some outward sign of the
                odd change that seemed to have come over him. It did not sound like the voice of the
                old <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> <name type="PERSON">Gamgee</name> that he thought he knew. But it looked like the old <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> <name type="PERSON">Gamgee</name>
                sitting there, except that his face was unusually thoughtful.</p>
            <p><q>'Do you feel any need to leave the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> now � now that your wish to see them has
                    come true already?'</q> he asked.</p>
            <p>
                <q>'Yes, sir. I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t know how to say it, but after <name type="TIME">last <name type="TIME">night</name></name> I feel different. I
                    seem to see ahead, in a kind of way. I know we are going to take a very long
                    road, into darkness; but I know I can't turn back. It isn't to see <name type="ORG">Elves</name> now,
                    nor dragons, nor mountains, that I <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t � I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t <name type="GPE">ri</name>ghtly know what I <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t: but
                    I have something to do before the end, and it lies ahead, not in the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>. I
                    must see it through, sir, if you understand me.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>
                <q>'I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t altogether. But I understand that <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> chose me a good companion. I
                    am con<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>t. We will go together.'</q>
            </p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> finished his breakfast in silence. Then standing up he looked over the land
                ahead, and called to <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>.</p>
            <p><q>'All ready to start?'</q> he said as <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> ran up. <q>'We must be getting off at
                    once. We slept late; and there are a good many miles to go.'</q></p>
            <p>_'You_ slept late, you mean,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. 'I was up long before; and we are only
                    waiting for you to finish eating and thinking.'</q></p>
            <p>
                <q>'I have finished both now. And I am going to make for <name type="ORG">Bucklebury</name> <name type="FAC">Ferry</name> as quickly
                    as possible. I am not going out of the way, back to the road we left <name type="TIME">last <name type="TIME">night</name></name>:
                    I am going to cut straight across country from here.'</q>
            </p>
            <p><q>'Then you are going to fly,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q>'You won't cut straight on foot
                    anywhere in this country.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'We can cut straighter than the road anyway,'</q> answered <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'The <name type="FAC">Ferry</name> is
                    east from <name type="PERSON">Wood</name>hall; but the hard road curves away to the left -you can see a
                    bend of it away north over there. It goes round the north end of the <name type="ORG">Ma<name type="GPE">ri</name>sh</name> so
                    as to st<name type="GPE">ri</name>ke the causeway from the <name type="FAC">B<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge</name> above <name type="ORG">Stock</name>. But that is miles out of
                    the way. We could save <name type="CARDINAL">a quarter</name> of the distance if we made a line for the <name type="FAC">Ferry</name>
                    from where we stand.'</q></p>
            <p>_'Short cuts make long delays,<q>'_ argued <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. 'The country is rough round here,
                    and there are bogs and all kinds of difficulties down in the <name type="ORG">Ma<name type="GPE">ri</name>sh</name> -I know the
                    land in these parts. And if you are worrying about <name type="ORG">Black</name> <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s, I can't see
                    that it is any worse meeting them on a road than in a wood or a field.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'It is less easy to find people in the woods and fields,'</q> answered <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.
                    <q>'And if you are supposed to be on the road, there is some chance that you
                    will be looked for on the road and not off it.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'All <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q>'I will follow you into every bog and ditch. But
                    it is hard! I had counted on passing the _Golden Perch_ at <name type="ORG">Stock</name> before sundown.
                    The best beer in the <name type="LOC">East</name>farthing, or used to be: it is a long time since I
                    tasted it.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'That settles it!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'Short cuts make delays, but inns make
                    longer <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s. At all costs we must keep you away from the _Golden Perch_. We <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t
                    to get to <name type="ORG">Bucklebury</name> before dark. What do you say, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>?'</q></p>
            <p><q>'I will go along with you, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> (in spite of p<name type="GPE">ri</name>vate misgiving
                and a deep regret for the best beer in the <name type="LOC">East</name>farthing).</p>
            <p><q>'Then if we are going to toil through bog and b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ar, let's go now!'</q> said
                <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>.</p>
            <p>It was already nearly as hot as it had been the <name type="DATE">day</name> before; but clouds were beginning
                to come up from the <name type="LOC">West</name>. It looked likely to turn to rain. The hobbits scrambled
                down a steep green bank and plunged into the thick trees below. Their course had
                been chosen to leave <name type="PERSON">Wood</name>hall to their left, and to cut slanting through the woods
                that clustered along the eastern side of the hills, until they reached the flats
                beyond. Then they could make straight for the <name type="FAC">Ferry</name> over country that was open,
                except for a few ditches and <name type="PERSON">fen</name>ces. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> reck<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>d they had <name type="CARDINAL">eight</name>een miles to go in
                a straight line.</p>
            <p>He soon found that the thicket was closer and more tangled than it had appeared.
                There were no paths in the undergrowth, and they did not get on very fast. When they
                had struggled to the bot<name type="PERSON">tom</name> of the bank, they found a stream running down from the
                hills behind in a deeply dug bed with steep slippery sides overhung with brambles.
                Most inconveniently it cut across the line they had chosen. They could not jump over
                it, nor indeed get across it at all without getting wet, scratched, and muddy. They
                halted, wonde<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng what to do. <q>'<name type="ORDINAL">First</name> check!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>, smiling g<name type="GPE">ri</name>mly.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> <name type="PERSON">Gamgee</name> looked back. <name type="PERSON">Thr</name>ough an opening in the trees he caught a glimpse of the
                top of <name type="ORG">the green bank</name> from which they had climbed down.</p>
            <p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok!'</q> he said, clut<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> by the arm. They all looked, and on the edge
                high above them they saw against the sky a horse standing. Beside it stooped a black
                figure.</p>
            <p>They at once gave up any idea of going back. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> led the way, and plunged quickly
                into the thick <name type="PERSON">bush</name>es beside the stream. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Whew</name>!'</q> he said to <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q>'We
                    were both <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght! The short cut has g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> crooked already; but we got under cover
                    only just in time. You've got sharp ears, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>: can you hear anything
                    coming?'</q></p>
            <p>They stood still, almost holding their breath as they lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed; but there was no
                sound of pursuit. <q>'I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t fancy he would try b<name type="GPE">ri</name>nging his horse down that
                    bank,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <q>'But I guess he knows we came down it. We had better be
                    going on.'</q></p>
            <p>Going on was not altogether easy. They had packs to carry, and the <name type="PERSON">bush</name>es and
                brambles were reluctant to let them through. They were cut off from the wind by the
                <name type="GPE">ri</name>dge behind, and the air was still and stuffy. When they forced their way at last
                into more open ground, they were hot and tired and very scratched, and they were
                also no longer certain of the direction in which they were going. The banks of the
                stream sank, as it reached the levels and became broader and shallower, <name type="PERSON">wan</name>de<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng
                off towards the <name type="ORG">Ma<name type="GPE">ri</name>sh</name> and the <name type="LOC">River</name>.</p>
            <p><q>'Why, this is the <name type="ORG">Stock</name>-brook!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q>'If we are going to try and
                    get back on to our course, we must cross at once and bear <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght.'</q></p>
            <p>They waded the stream, and hur<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed over a wide open space, rush-grown and treeless,
                on the further side. Beyond that they came again to a belt of trees: tall oaks, for
                the most part, with here and there an elm tree or an ash. The ground was fairly
                level, and there was little undergrowth; but the trees were loo close for them to
                see far ahead. The leaves blew upwards in sudden gusts of wind, and spots of rain
                began to fall from the overcast sky. Then the wind died away and the rain came
                streaming down. They trudged along as fast as they could, over patches of grass, and
                through thick d<name type="GPE">ri</name>fts of old leaves; and all about them the rain pattered and
                t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ckled. They did not talk, but kept glancing back, and from side to side.</p>
            <p>After <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> <name type="TIME">an <name type="TIME">hour</name></name> <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> said: <q>'I hope we have not turned too much towards the
                    south, and are not walking longwise through this wood! It is not a very broad
                    belt -I should have said no more than <name type="QUANTITY">a mile</name> at the widest � and we ought to
                    have been through it by now.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'It is no good our starting to go in zig-zags,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'That won't
                    mend matters. Let us keep on as we are going! I am not sure that I <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t to come
                    out into the open yet.'</q></p>
            <p>They went on for perhaps <name type="QUANTITY">another couple of miles</name>. Then the sun gleamed out of ragged
                clouds again and the rain lessened. It was now past mid-<name type="DATE">day</name>, and they felt it was
                high time for lunch. They halted under an elm tree: its leaves though fast turning
                yellow were still thick, and the ground at its feel was fairly dry and sheltered.
                When they came to make their meal, they found that the <name type="ORG">Elves</name> had filled their
                bottles with a clear d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk, pale golden in colour: it had the scent of a h<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>y made
                of many flowers, and was wonderfully refreshing. Very soon they were laughing, and
                snapping their fingers at rain, and at <name type="ORG">Black</name> <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s. The last few miles, they felt,
                would soon be behind them.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> propped his back against the tree-trunk, and closed his eyes. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>
                sat near, and they began to hum, and then to sing softly:</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Ho</name>! <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>! <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>! to the bottle I go</p>
            <p>To heal my heart and drown my woe.</p>
            <p>Rain may fall and wind may blow,</p>
            <p>And many miles be still to go,</p>
            <p>But under a tall tree I will lie,</p>
            <p>And let the clouds go sailing by.</p>
            <p>_<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>! <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>! <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>!_ they began again louder. They stopped short suddenly. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> sprang to
                his feet. A long-drawn wail came down the wind, like the cry of some evil and l<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>ly
                creature. It rose and fell, and ended on a high piercing note. Even as they sat and
                stood, as if suddenly frozen, it was answered by another cry, fainter and further
                off, but no less chilling to the blood. There was then a silence, broken only by the
                sound of the wind in the leaves.</p>
            <p><q>'And what do you think that was?'</q> <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> asked at last, trying to speak
                lightly, but quave<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng a little. <q>'If it was a bird, it was <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> that I never heard
                    in the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> before.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'It was not bird or beast,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'It was a call, or a signal � there
                    were words in that cry, though I could not catch them. But no hobbit has such a
                    voice.'</q></p>
            <p>No more was said about it. They were all thinking of the <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s, but no <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> spoke of
                them. They were now reluctant either to stay or go on; but so<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>r or later they had
                got to get across the open country to the <name type="FAC">Ferry</name>, and it was best to go so<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>r and in
                <name type="DATE">day</name>light. In <name type="TIME">a few moments</name> they had shouldered their packs again and were off.</p>
            <p>Before long the wood came to a sudden end. Wide grass-lands stretched before them.
                They now saw that they had, in fact, turned too much to the south. Away over the
                flats they could glimpse the low hill of <name type="ORG">Bucklebury</name> across the <name type="LOC">River</name>, but it was now
                to their left. Creeping cautiously out from the edge of the trees, they set off
                across the open as quickly as they could.</p>
            <p>At <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> they felt afraid, away from the shelter of the wood. <name type="LOC">Far</name> back behind them
                stood the high place where they had breakfasted. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> expected to see the
                small distant figure of a horseman on the <name type="GPE">ri</name>dge dark against the sky; but there was
                no sign of <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. The sun escaping from the breaking clouds, as it sank towards the
                hills they had left, was now shining b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ghtly again. Their fear left them, though
                they still felt uneasy. But the land became steadily more tame and well-ordered.
                Soon they came into well-<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ded fields and meadows: there were hedges and gates and
                dikes for drainage. Everything seemed quiet and peaceful, just an ordinary corner of
                the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>. Their spi<name type="GPE">ri</name>ts rose with every step. The line of the <name type="LOC">River</name> grew nearer;
                and the <name type="ORG">Black</name> <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s began to seem like phan<name type="PERSON">tom</name>s of the woods now left far
                behind.</p>
            <p>They passed along the edge of a huge turnip-field, and came to a stout gate. Beyond
                it a rutted lane ran between low well-laid hedges towards a distant clump of trees.
                <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> stopped.</p>
            <p><q>'I know these fields and this gate!'</q> he said. <q>'This is <name type="GPE">Bamfurlong</name>, old
                    <name type="LOC">Far</name>mer <name type="PERSON">Maggot</name>'s land. That's his farm away there in the trees.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'<name type="CARDINAL">One</name> trouble after another!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, looking nearly as much alarmed as if
                <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> had declared the lane was the slot leading to a dragon's den. The others
                looked at him in surp<name type="GPE">ri</name>se.</p>
            <p><q>'What's wrong with old <name type="PERSON">Maggot</name>?'</q> asked <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q>'He's a good f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end to all
                    the <name type="ORG">Brand</name>y bucks. Of course he's a terror to trespassers, and keeps ferocious
                    dogs � but after all, folk down here are near the border and have to be more on
                    their guard.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'I know,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'But all the same,'</q> he added with a shamefaced
                laugh, <q>'I am ter<name type="GPE">ri</name>fied of him and his dogs. I have avoided his farm for <name type="DATE">year</name>s and
                    <name type="DATE">year</name>s. He caught me several times trespassing after mushrooms, when I was a
                    youngster at <name type="ORG">Brand</name>y <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>l. On the last occasion he beat me, and then took me and
                    showed me to his dogs. "See, lads," he said, "next time this young varmint sets
                    foot on my land, you can eat him. Now see him off!" They chased me all the way
                    to the <name type="FAC">Ferry</name>. I have never got over the f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght � though I daresay the beasts
                    knew their business and would not really have touched me.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> laughed. <q>'Well, it's time you made it up. Especially if you are coming back
                    to live in <name type="PERSON">Buckland</name>. Old <name type="PERSON">Maggot</name> is really a stout fellow � if you leave his
                    mushrooms al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. Let's get into the lane and then we shan't be trespassing. If
                    we meet him, I'll do the talking. He is a f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end of <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>'s, and I used to come
                    here with him a good deal at <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> time.'</q></p>
            <p>They went along the lane, until they saw the thatched roofs of a large house and
                farm-buildings peeping out among the trees ahead. The <name type="PERSON">Maggot</name>s, and the Puddifoots of
                <name type="ORG">Stock</name>, and most of the inhabitants of the <name type="ORG">Ma<name type="GPE">ri</name>sh</name>, were house-dwellers; and this farm
                was stoutly built of b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ck and had a high wall all round it. There was a wide wooden
                gate opening out of the wall into the lane.</p>
            <p>Suddenly as they drew nearer a ter<name type="GPE">ri</name>fic baying and barking broke out, and a loud
                voice was heard shouting: <q>'<name type="PERSON">G<name type="GPE">ri</name>p</name>! Fang! <name type="PERSON">Wolf</name>! Come on, lads!'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> stopped dead, but <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> walked on a few paces. The gate opened and
                <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> huge dogs came pelting out into the lane, and dashed towards the travellers,
                barking fiercely. They took no notice of <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>; but <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> shrank against the wall,
                while <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> wolvish-looking dogs snif<name type="ORG">fed</name> at him suspiciously, and snarled if he moved.
                The largest and most ferocious of the <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> halted in front of <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, b<name type="GPE">ri</name>stling and
                growling.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Thr</name>ough the gate there now appeared a broad thick-set hobbit with a round red face.
                    <q>'<name type="PERSON">Hal</name>lo! <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>lo! And who may you be, and what may you be <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ting?'</q> he
                asked.</p>
            <p><q>'Good <name type="TIME">after<name type="TIME">noon</name></name>, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Maggot</name>!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>.</p>
            <p>The farmer looked at him closely. <q>'Well, if it isn't Master <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> � Mr. <name type="PERSON">Pereg<name type="GPE">ri</name>n</name>
                    <name type="PERSON">Took</name>, I should say!'</q> he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed, changing from a scowl to a g<name type="GPE">ri</name>n. <q>'It's a
                    long time since I saw you round here. It's lucky for you that I know you. I was
                    just going out to set my dogs on any strangers. There are some funny things
                    going on to<name type="DATE">day</name>. Of course, we do get queer folk <name type="PERSON">wan</name>de<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng in these parts at
                    times. Too near the <name type="LOC">River</name>,'</q> he said, shaking his head. <q>'But this fellow
                    was the most outlandish I have ever set eyes on. He won't cross my land without
                    leave a <name type="ORG">sec</name>ond time, not if I can stop it.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'What fellow do you mean?'</q> asked <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>.</p>
            <p><q>'Then you haven't seen him?'</q> said the farmer. <q>'He went up the lane towards
                    the causeway not a long while back. He was a funny cus<name type="PERSON">tom</name>er and asking funny
                    questions. But perhaps you'll come along inside, and we'll pass the news more
                    comfortable. I've a drop of good ale on tap, if you and your f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends are
                    willing, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Took</name>.'</q></p>
            <p>It seemed plain that the farmer would tell them more, if allowed to do it in his own
                time and fashion, so they all accepted the invitation. <q>'What about the dogs?'</q>
                asked <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> anxiously.</p>
            <p>The farmer laughed. <q>'They won't harm you � not unless I tell 'em to. Here, <name type="PERSON">G<name type="GPE">ri</name>p</name>!
                    Fang! <name type="PERSON">Heel</name>!'</q> he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Heel</name>, <name type="PERSON">Wolf</name>!'</q> To the relief of <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>,
                the dogs walked away and let them go free.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> introduced the other <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> to the farmer. <q>'Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> <name type="PERSON">Baggins</name>,'</q> he said.
                    <q>'You may not remember him, but he used to live at <name type="ORG">Brand</name>y <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>l.'</q> At the
                name <name type="PERSON">Baggins</name> the farmer started, and gave <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> a sharp glance. For a moment <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>
                thought that the memory of stolen mushrooms had been aroused, and that the dogs
                would be told to see him off. But <name type="LOC">Far</name>mer <name type="PERSON">Maggot</name> took him by the arm.</p>
            <p><q>'Well, if that isn't queerer than ever?'</q> he exclaimed. <q>'Mr. <name type="PERSON">Baggins</name> is it?
                    Come inside! We must have a talk.'</q></p>
            <p>They went into the farmer's kitchen, and sat by the wide fire-place. Mrs. <name type="PERSON">Maggot</name>
                brought out beer in a huge jug, and filled <name type="CARDINAL">four</name> large mugs. It was a good brew, and
                <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> found himself more than compensated for missing the _Golden Perch._ <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>
                sipped his beer suspiciously. He had a natural mistrust of the inhabitants of other
                parts of the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>; and also he was not disposed to be quick f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends with any<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> who
                had bea<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> his master, however <name type="DATE">long ago</name>.</p>
            <p>After a few re<name type="PERSON">mar</name>ks about the weather and the ag<name type="GPE">ri</name>cultural prospects (which were no
                worse than usual), <name type="LOC">Far</name>mer <name type="PERSON">Maggot</name> put down his mug and looked at them all in
                turn.</p>
            <p><q>'Now, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Pereg<name type="GPE">ri</name>n</name>,'</q> he said, <q>'where might you be coming from, and where
                    might you be going to? Were you coming to visit' me? For, if so, you had g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>
                    past my gate without my seeing you.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Well, no,'</q> answered <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q>'To tell you the truth, since you have guessed
                    it, we got into the lane from the other end: we had come over your fields. But
                    that was quite by accident. We lost our way in the woods, back near <name type="PERSON">Wood</name>hall,
                    trying to take a short cut to the <name type="FAC">Ferry</name>.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'If you were in a hurry, the road would have served you better,'</q> said the
                farmer. <q>'But I wasn't worrying about that. You have leave to walk over my land,
                    if you have a mind, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Pereg<name type="GPE">ri</name>n</name>. And you, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Baggins</name> � though I daresay you
                    still like mushrooms.'</q> He laughed. <q>'Ah yes, I recognized the name. I
                    recollect the time when young <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> <name type="PERSON">Baggins</name> was <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the worst young rascals
                    of <name type="PERSON">Buckland</name>. But it wasn't mushrooms I was thinking of. I had just heard the
                    name <name type="PERSON">Baggins</name> before you turned up. What do you think that funny cus<name type="PERSON">tom</name>er asked
                    me?'</q></p>
            <p>They waited anxiously for him to go on. <q>'Well,'</q> the farmer continued,
                approa<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g his point with slow relish, 'he came <name type="GPE">ri</name>ding on a big black horse in at
                the gate, which happened to be open, and <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name> my door. All black he was
                himself, too, and cloaked and hooded up, as if he did not <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t to be known. "Now
                what in the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> can he <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t?" I thought to myself. We <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t see many of the Big
                Folk over the border; and anyway I had never heard of any like this black
                fellow.</p>
            <p>' "<name type="DATE">Good-<name type="DATE">day</name></name> to you!" I says, going out to him. "This lane <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t lead anywhere, and
                wherever you may be going, your quickest way will be back to the road." I didn't
                like the looks of him; and when <name type="PERSON">G<name type="GPE">ri</name>p</name> came out, he took <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> sniff and let out a yelp
                as if he had been slung: he put down his tail and bolted off howling. The black
                fellow sat quite still.</p>
            <p>' "I come from yonder," he said, slow and stiff-like, pointing back west, over _my_
                fields, if you please. "Have you seen _<name type="PERSON">Baggins</name>?"_ he asked in a queer voice, and
                bent down towards me. I could not see any face, for his hood fell down so low; and I
                felt a sort of shiver down my back. But I did not see why he should come <name type="GPE">ri</name>ding over
                my land so bold.</p>
            <p>' "Be off!" I said. "There are no <name type="PERSON">Baggins</name>es here. You're in the wrong part of the
                <name type="LOC">Shire</name>. You had better go back west to <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbiton � but you can go by road this
                time."</p>
            <p>' "<name type="PERSON">Baggins</name> has left," he answered in a whisper. "He is coming. He is not far away. I
                wish to find him. If he passes will you tell me? I will come back with gold."</p>
            <p>' "No you won't," I said. "You'll go back where you belong, double quick. I give you
                <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> minute before I call all my dogs."</p>
            <p>
                <q>'He gave a sort of hiss. It might have been laughing, and it might not. Then he
                    spurred his great horse <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght at me, and I jumped out of the way only just in
                    time. I called the dogs, but he swung off, and rode through the gate and up the
                    lane towards the causeway like a bolt of thunder. What do you think of
                    that?'</q>
            </p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> sat for a moment looking at the fire, but his only thought was how on <name type="LOC">earth</name>
                would they reach the <name type="FAC">Ferry</name>. <q>'I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t know what to think,'</q> he said at
                last.</p>
            <p><q>'Then I'll tell you what to think,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Maggot</name>. <q>'You should never have
                    g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> mixing yourself up with <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbiton folk, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. Folk are queer up
                    there.'</q> <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> stirred in his c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>r, and looked at the farmer with an
                unf<name type="GPE">ri</name>endly eye. <q>'But you were always a reckless lad. When I heard you had left
                    the <name type="ORG">Brand</name>ybucks and g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> off to that old Mr. <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>, I said that you were going
                    to find trouble. <name type="PERSON">Mark</name> my words, this all comes of those strange doings of Mr.
                    <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>'s. His m<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>y was got in some strange fashion in foreign parts, they say.
                    <name type="DATE">May</name>be there is some that <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t to know what has become of the gold and jewels
                    that he bu<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed in the hill of <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbiton, as I hear?'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> said nothing: the shrewd guesses of the farmer were rather disconcerting.</p>
            <p><q>'Well, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>,'</q> <name type="PERSON">Maggot</name> went on, <q>'I'm glad that you've had the sense to
                    come back to <name type="PERSON">Buckland</name>. My advice is: stay there! And <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t get mixed up with
                    these outlandish folk. You'll have f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends in these parts. If any of these black
                    fellows come after you again, I'll deal with them. I'll say you're dead, or have
                    left the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>, or anything you like. And that might be true enough; for as like
                    as not it is old Mr. <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> they <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t news of.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'<name type="DATE">May</name>be you're <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, avoiding the farmer's eye and sta<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng at the
                fire.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Maggot</name> looked at him thoughtfully. <q>'Well, I see you have ideas of your own,'</q>
                he said. <q>'It is as plain as my nose that no accident brought you and that <name type="GPE">ri</name>der
                    here on the same <name type="TIME">after<name type="TIME">noon</name></name>; and maybe my news was no great news to you, after
                    all. I am not asking you to tell me anything you have a mind to keep to
                    yourself; but I see you are in some kind of trouble. Perhaps you are thinking it
                    won't be too easy to get to the <name type="FAC">Ferry</name> without being caught?'</q></p>
            <p><q>'I was thinking so,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'But we have got to try and get there; and
                    it won't be <name type="PERSON">don</name>e by sitting and thinking. So I am afraid we must be going. Thank
                    you very much indeed for your kindness! I've been in terror of you and your dogs
                    for <name type="DATE">over <name type="CARDINAL">thirty</name> <name type="DATE">year</name>s</name>, <name type="LOC">Far</name>mer <name type="PERSON">Maggot</name>, though you may laugh to hear it. It's a
                    pity: for I've missed a good f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end. And now I'm sorry to leave so soon. But
                    I'll come back, perhaps, <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> <name type="DATE">day</name> � if I get a chance.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'You'll be welcome when you come,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Maggot</name>. <q>'But now I've a notion.
                    It's near sundown already, and we are going to have our supper; for we mostly go
                    to bed soon after the <name type="ORG">Sun</name>. If you and Mr. <name type="PERSON">Pereg<name type="GPE">ri</name>n</name> and all could stay and have a
                    bite with us, we would be pleased!'</q></p>
            <p><q>'And so should we!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'But we must be going at once, I'm afraid.
                    Even now it will be dark before we can reach the <name type="FAC">Ferry</name>.'</q></p>
            <p>
                <q>'Ah! but wait <name type="TIME">a minute</name>! I was going to say: after a bit of supper, I'll gel out a
                    small waggon, and I'll d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ve you all to the <name type="FAC">Ferry</name>. That will save you a good
                    step, and it might also save you trouble of another sort.'</q>
            </p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> now accepted the invitation gratefully, to the relief of <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. The
                sun was already behind the western hills, and the light was failing. <name type="CARDINAL">Two</name> of <name type="PERSON">Maggot</name>'s
                sons and his <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> daughters came in, and a generous supper was laid on the large
                table. The kitchen was lit with candles and the fire was mended. Mrs. <name type="PERSON">Maggot</name> hustled
                in and out. <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> or <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> other hobbits belonging to the farm-household came in. In a
                short while <name type="CARDINAL">four</name>teen sat down to eat. There was beer in plenty, and a mighty dish of
                mushrooms and bacon, besides much other solid farmhouse fare. The dogs lay by the
                fire and gnawed <name type="GPE">ri</name>nds and cracked b<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s.</p>
            <p>When they had finished, the farmer and his sons went out with a lantern and got the
                waggon ready. It was dark in the yard, when the guests came out. They threw their
                packs on board and climbed in. The farmer sat in the d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ving-seat, and whipped up
                his <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> stout ponies. His wife stood in the light of the open door.</p>
            <p><q>'You be careful of yourself. <name type="PERSON">Maggot</name>!'</q> she called. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Don</name>'t go arguing with
                    any foreigners, and come straight back!'</q></p>
            <p><q>'I will!'</q> said he, and drove out of the gate. There was now no breath of wind
                stir<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng; the <name type="TIME">night</name> was still and quiet, and a chill was in the air. They went
                without lights and took it slowly. After <name type="QUANTITY">a mile</name> or <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> the lane came to an end,
                crossing a deep dike, and climbing a short slope up on to the high-banked
                causeway.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Maggot</name> got down and took a good look either way, north and south, but nothing could
                be seen in the darkness, and there was not a sound in the still air. Thin strands of
                <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver-mist were hanging above the dikes, and crawling over the fields.</p>
            <p><q>'It's going to be thick,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Maggot</name>; <q>'but I'll not light my lantern till
                    I turn for home. We'll hear anything on the road long before we meet it
                    to<name type="TIME">night</name>.'</q></p>
            <p>It was <name type="CARDINAL">five</name> miles or more from <name type="PERSON">Maggot</name>'s lane to the <name type="FAC">Ferry</name>. The hobbits wrapped
                themselves up, but their ears were strained for any sound above the creak of the
                wheels and the slow _clop_ of the ponies' hoofs. The waggon seemed slower than a
                snail to <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. Beside him <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> was nodding towards sleep; but <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> was sta<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng
                forwards into the <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing fog.</p>
            <p>They reached the entrance to the <name type="FAC">Ferry</name> lane at last. It was <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ked by <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> tall white
                posts that suddenly loomed up on their <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght. <name type="LOC">Far</name>mer <name type="PERSON">Maggot</name> drew in his ponies and
                the waggon creaked to a halt. They were just beginning lo scramble out, when
                suddenly they heard what they had all been dreading: hoofs on the road ahead. The
                sound was coming towards them.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Maggot</name> jumped down and stood holding the ponies' heads, and pee<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng forward into the
                gloom. _Clip-clop, clip-clop_ came the approa<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g <name type="GPE">ri</name>der. The fall of the hoofs
                sounded loud in the still, foggy air.</p>
            <p><q>'You'd better be hidden, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> anxiously. <q>'You get down in
                    the waggon and cover up with blankets, and we'll send this <name type="GPE">ri</name>der to the
                    <name type="GPE">ri</name>ghtabouts!'</q> He climbed out and went to the farmer's side. <name type="ORG">Black</name> <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s
                would have to <name type="GPE">ri</name>de over him to get near the waggon.</p>
            <p>_Clop-clop, clop-clop._ The <name type="GPE">ri</name>der was nearly on them.</p>
            <p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Hal</name>lo there!'</q> called <name type="LOC">Far</name>mer <name type="PERSON">Maggot</name>. The advancing hoofs stopped short. They
                thought they could dimly guess a dark cloaked shape in the mist, a yard or <name type="CARDINAL">two</name>
                ahead. <q>'Now then!'</q> said the farmer, throwing the reins to <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> and st<name type="GPE">ri</name>ding
                forward. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Don</name>'t you come a step nearer! What do you <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t, and where are you
                    going?'</q></p>
            <p><q>'I <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t Mr. <name type="PERSON">Baggins</name>. Have you seen him?'</q> said a muffled voice � but the voice
                was the voice of <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> <name type="ORG">Brand</name>ybuck. A dark lantern was uncovered, and its light fell
                on the astonished face of the farmer.</p>
            <p><q>'Mr. <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>!'</q> he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed.</p>
            <p><q>'Yes, of course! Who did you think it was?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> coming forward. As he
                came out of the mist and their fears subsided, he seemed suddenly to diminish to
                ordinary hobbit-size. He was <name type="GPE">ri</name>ding a pony, and a scarf was swathed round his neck
                and over his <name type="PERSON">chin</name> to keep out the fog.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> sprang out of the waggon to greet him. <q>'So there you are at last!'</q> said
                <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'I was beginning to wonder if you would turn up at all to<name type="DATE">day</name>, and I was
                    just going back to supper. When it grew foggy I came across and rode <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name>wards
                    <name type="ORG">Stock</name> to see if you had fallen in any ditches. But I'm blest if I know which way
                    you have come. Where did you find them, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Maggot</name>? In your duck-pond?'</q></p>
            <p><q>'No, I caught 'em trespassing,'</q> said the farmer, <q>'and nearly set my dogs on
                    'em; but they'll tell you all the story, I've no doubt. Now, if you'll excuse
                    me, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> and Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and all, I'd best be turning for home. Mrs. <name type="PERSON">Maggot</name>
                    will be wor<name type="GPE">ri</name>ting with the <name type="TIME">night</name> getting thick.'</q></p>
            <p>He backed the waggon into the lane and turned it. <q>'Well, good <name type="TIME">night</name> to you
                    all,'</q> he said. <q>'It's been <name type="DATE">a queer <name type="DATE">day</name></name>, and no mistake. But all's well as
                    ends well; though perhaps we should not say that until we reach our own doors.
                    I'll not deny that I'll be glad now when I do.'</q> He lit his lanterns, and got
                up. Suddenly he produced a large basket from under the seat. <q>'I was nearly
                    forgetting,'</q> he said. <q>'Mrs. <name type="PERSON">Maggot</name> put this up for Mr. <name type="PERSON">Baggins</name>, with her
                    compliments.'</q> He handed it down and moved off, followed by a chorus of
                thanks and good-<name type="TIME">night</name>s.</p>
            <p>They watched the pale <name type="GPE">ri</name>ngs of light round his lanterns as they dwindled into the
                foggy <name type="TIME">night</name>. Suddenly <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> laughed: from the covered basket he held, the scent of
                mushrooms was <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing.</p>

            <p>A Conspiracy Unmasked</p>
            <p><q>'Now we had better get home ourselves,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. There's something funny
                about all this, I see; but it must wait till we get in.'</p>
            <p>They turned down the <name type="FAC">Ferry</name> lane, which was straight and well-kept and edged with
                large white-washed st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s. In <name type="CARDINAL">a <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name></name> yards or so it brought them to the
                <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver-bank, where there was a broad wooden landing-stage. A large flat ferry-boat
                was moored beside it. The white bollards near the water's edge glimmered in the
                light of <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> lamps on high posts. Behind them the mists in the flat fields were now
                above the hedges; but the water before them was dark, with only a few curling wisps
                like steam among the reeds by the bank. There seemed to be less fog on the further
                side.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Merry</name> led the pony over a gangway on to the ferry, and the others followed. <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>
                then pushed slowly off with a long pole. The <name type="ORG">Brand</name>ywine flowed slow and broad before
                them. On the other side the bank was steep, and up it a winding path climbed from
                the further landing. Lamps were twinkling there. Behind loomed up the <name type="PERSON">Buck <name type="ORG">Hill</name></name>; and
                out of it, through stray shrouds of mist, sh<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> many round windows, yellow and red.
                They were the windows of <name type="ORG">Brand</name>y <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>l, the ancient home of the <name type="ORG">Brand</name>ybucks.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ng ago <name type="PERSON">Gorhendad Oldbuck</name>, head of the Oldbuck family, <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the oldest in the
                <name type="ORG">Ma<name type="GPE">ri</name>sh</name> or indeed in the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>, had crossed the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver, which was the o<name type="GPE">ri</name>ginal
                boundary of the land eastwards. He built (and excavated) <name type="ORG">Brand</name>y <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>l, changed his
                name to <name type="ORG">Brand</name>ybuck, and settled down to become master of what was virtually a small
                independent country. His family grew and grew, and after his <name type="DATE">day</name>s continued to grow,
                until <name type="ORG">Brand</name>y <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>l occupied the whole of the low hill, and had <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> large
                front-doors, many side-doors, and about <name type="CARDINAL">a <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name></name> windows. The <name type="ORG">Brand</name>ybucks and their
                numerous dependants then began to burrow, and later to build, all round about. That
                was the o<name type="GPE">ri</name>gin of <name type="PERSON">Buckland</name>, a thickly inhabited st<name type="GPE">ri</name>p between the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver and the Old
                <name type="ORG">Forest</name>, a sort of colony from the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>. Its chief village was <name type="ORG">Bucklebury</name>,
                cluste<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng in the banks and slopes behind <name type="ORG">Brand</name>y <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>l.</p>
            <p>The people in the <name type="ORG">Ma<name type="GPE">ri</name>sh</name> were f<name type="GPE">ri</name>endly with the <name type="PERSON">Buckland</name>ers, and the autho<name type="GPE">ri</name>ty of the
                Master of the <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>l (as the head of the <name type="ORG">Brand</name>ybuck family was called) was still
                acknowledged by the farmers between <name type="ORG">Stock</name> and Rushey. But most of the folk of the
                old <name type="LOC">Shire</name> regarded the <name type="PERSON">Buckland</name>ers as peculiar, <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> foreigners as it were. Though,
                as a matter of fact, they were not very different from the other hobbits of the <name type="CARDINAL">Four</name>
                <name type="LOC">Far</name>things. Except in <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> point: they were fond of boats, and some of them could
                swim.</p>
            <p>Their land was o<name type="GPE">ri</name>ginally unprotected from the <name type="LOC">East</name>; but on that side they had built
                a hedge: <name type="PRODUCT">the High Hay</name>. It had been planted many generations ago, and was now thick
                and tail, for it was constantly <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ded. It ran all the way from <name type="ORG">Brand</name>ywine <name type="FAC">B<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge</name>,
                in a big loop curving away from the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver, to <name type="LOC">Haysend</name> (where the <name type="ORG">Withywindle</name> flowed
                out of the <name type="ORG">Forest</name> into the <name type="ORG">Brand</name>ywine): well over <name type="CARDINAL">twenty</name> miles from end to end. But,
                of course, it was not a complete protection. The <name type="ORG">Forest</name> drew close to the hedge in
                many places. The <name type="PERSON">Buckland</name>ers kept their doors locked after dark, and that also was
                not usual in the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>.</p>
            <p>The ferry-boat moved slowly across the water. The <name type="PERSON">Buckland</name> shore drew nearer. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> was
                the only member of the party who had not been over the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver before. He had a
                strange feeling as the slow gurgling stream slipped by: his old life lay behind in
                the mists, dark adventure lay in front. He scratched his head, and for a moment had
                a passing wish that Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> could have g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> on living quietly at <name type="FAC">Bag End</name>.</p>
            <p>The <name type="CARDINAL">four</name> hobbits stepped off the ferry. <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> was tying it up, and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> was already
                leading the pony up the path, when <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> (who had been looking back, as if to take
                farewell of the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>) said in a hoarse whisper:</p>
            <p>
                <q>'<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok back, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>! Do you see anything?'</q>
            </p>
            <p>On the far stage, under the distant lamps, they could just make out a figure: it
                looked like a dark black bundle left behind. But as they looked it seemed to move
                and sway this way and that, as if sear<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g the ground. It then crawled, or went
                crou<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g, back into the gloom beyond the lamps.</p>
            <p><q>'What in the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> is that?'</q> exclaimed <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>.</p>
            <p><q>'Something that is following us,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'But <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t ask any more now!
                    Let's get away at once!'</q> They hur<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed up the path to the top of the bank,
                but when they looked back the far shore was shrouded in mist, and nothing could be
                seen.</p>
            <p><q>'Thank goodness you <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t keep any boats on the west-bank!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.
                    <q>'Can horses cross the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver?'</q></p>
            <p><q>'They can go <name type="CARDINAL">twenty</name> miles north to <name type="ORG">Brand</name>ywine <name type="FAC">B<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge</name> � or they might swim,'</q>
                answered <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'Though I never heard of any horse swimming the <name type="ORG">Brand</name>ywine. But
                    what have horses to do with it?'</q> I'll tell you later. Let's get indoors and
                then we can talk.'</p>
            <p>
                <q>'All <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght! You and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> know your way; so I'll just <name type="GPE">ri</name>de on and tell <name type="PERSON">Fatty</name>
                    <name type="PERSON">Bolger</name> that you are coming. We'll see about supper and things.'</q>
            </p>
            <p><q>'We had our supper early with <name type="LOC">Far</name>mer <name type="PERSON">Maggot</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>; <q>'but we could do
                    with another.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'You shall have it! Give me that basket!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>, and rode ahead into the
                darkness.</p>
            <p>It was some distance from the <name type="ORG">Brand</name>ywine to <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s new house at <name type="ORG">C<name type="GPE">ri</name>ckhollow</name>. They
                passed <name type="PERSON">Buck <name type="ORG">Hill</name></name> and <name type="ORG">Brand</name>y <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>l on their left, and on the outskirts of <name type="ORG">Bucklebury</name>
                struck the main road of <name type="PERSON">Buckland</name> that ran south from the <name type="FAC">B<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge</name>. <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>f <name type="QUANTITY">a mile</name>
                northward along this they came to a lane opening on their <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght. This they followed
                for <name type="QUANTITY">a couple of miles</name> as it climbed up and down into the country.</p>
            <p>At last they came to a narrow gate in a thick hedge. Nothing could be seen of the
                house in the dark: it stood back from the lane in the middle of a wide circle of
                lawn surrounded by a belt of low trees inside the outer hedge. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> had chosen it,
                because it stood in an out-of-the-way corner of the country, and there were no other
                dwellings close by. You could get in and out without being noticed. It had been
                built a long while before by the <name type="ORG">Brand</name>ybucks, for the use of guests, or members of
                the family that wished to escape from the crowded life of <name type="ORG">Brand</name>y <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>l for a time. It
                was an old-fashi<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>d count<name type="GPE">ri</name>fied house, as much like a hobbit-hole as possible: it
                was long and low, with no upper storey; and it had a roof of turf, round windows,
                and a large round door.</p>
            <p>As they walked lip the green path from the gate no light was visible; the windows
                were dark and shuttered. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> knocked on the door, and <name type="PERSON">Fatty</name> <name type="PERSON">Bolger</name> opened it. A
                f<name type="GPE">ri</name>endly light streamed out. They slipped in quickly and shut themselves and the
                light inside. They were in a wide hall with doors on either side; in front of them a
                passage ran back down the middle of the house.</p>
            <p><q>'Well, what do you think of it?'</q> asked <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> coming up the passage. <q>'We
                    have <name type="PERSON">don</name>e our best in a short time to make it look like home. After all <name type="PERSON">Fatty</name>
                    and I only got here with the last cart-load yester<name type="DATE">day</name>.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> looked round. It did look like home. Many of his own favou<name type="GPE">ri</name>te things � or
                <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>'s things (they reminded him sharply of him in their new selling) � were
                arranged as nearly as possible as they had been at <name type="FAC">Bag End</name>. It was a pleasant,
                comfortable, welcoming place; and he found himself wishing that he was really coming
                here to settle down in quiet retirement. It seemed unfair to have put his f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends to
                all this trouble; and he wondered again how he was going to break the news to them
                that he must leave them so soon, indeed at once. Yet that would have to be <name type="PERSON">don</name>e that
                very <name type="TIME">night</name>, before they all went to bed.</p>
            <p><q>'It's delightful!'</q> he said with an effort. <q>'I hardly feel that I have moved
                    at all.'</q></p>
            <p>The travellers hung up their cloaks, and piled their packs on the floor. <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> led
                them down the passage and threw open a door at the far end. <name type="ORG">Fire</name>light came out, and
                a puff of steam.</p>
            <p><q>'A bath!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q>'O blessed <name type="PERSON">Me<name type="GPE">ri</name>adoc</name>!'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Which order shall we go in?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'Eldest <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>, or quickest <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>?
                    You'll be last either way, Master <name type="PERSON">Pereg<name type="GPE">ri</name>n</name>.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Trust me to arrange things better than that!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'We can't begin
                    life at <name type="ORG">C<name type="GPE">ri</name>ckhollow</name> with a quarrel over baths. In that room there are _<name type="CARDINAL">three</name>_
                    tubs, and a copper full of boiling water. There are also towels, mats and soap.
                    Get inside, and be quick!'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Merry</name> and <name type="PERSON">Fatty</name> went into the kitchen on the other side of the passage, and busied
                themselves with the final preparations for a late supper. Snatches of competing
                songs came from the bathroom mixed with the sound of splashing and wallowing. The
                voice of <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> was suddenly lifted up above the others in <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>'s favou<name type="GPE">ri</name>te
                bath-songs.</p>
            <p>Sing hey! for the bath at close of <name type="DATE">day</name></p>
            <p>that washes the weary mud away!</p>
            <p>A loon is he that will not sing:</p>
            <p>O! Water <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>t is a noble thing!</p>
            <p>O! <name type="PERSON">Sweet</name> is the sound of falling rain,</p>
            <p>and the brook that leaps from hill to plain;</p>
            <p>but better than rain or <name type="GPE">ri</name>ppling streams</p>
            <p>is Water <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>t that smokes and steams.</p>
            <p>O! Water cold we may pour at need</p>
            <p>down a thirsty throat and be glad indeed;</p>
            <p>but better is Beer, if d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk we lack,</p>
            <p>and Water <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>t poured down the back.</p>
            <p>O! Water is fair that leaps on high</p>
            <p>in a fountain white beneath the sky;</p>
            <p>but never did fountain sound so sweet</p>
            <p>as splashing <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>t Water with my feet!</p>
            <p>There was a ter<name type="GPE">ri</name>fic splash, and a shout of _Whoa!_ from <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. It appeared that a
                lot of <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>'s bath had imitated a fountain and leaped on high.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Merry</name> went to the door: <q>'What about supper and beer in the throat?'</q> he called.
                <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> came out drying his <name type="PERSON">hai</name>r.</p>
            <p><q>'There's so much water in the air that I'm coming into the kitchen to finish,'</q>
                he said.</p>
            <p><q>'<name type="ORG">Lawks</name>!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>, looking in. The st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> floor was swimming. <q>'You ought
                    to mop all that up before you get anything to eat. <name type="PERSON">Pereg<name type="GPE">ri</name>n</name>,'</q> he said.
                    <q>'Hurry up, or we shan't wait for you.'</q></p>
            <p>They had supper in the kitchen on a table near the fire. <q>'I suppose you <name type="CARDINAL">three</name>
                    won't <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t mushrooms again?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Fredegar</name> without much hope.</p>
            <p><q>'Yes we shall!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>.</p>
            <p><q>'They're mine!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'Given to _me_ by Mrs. <name type="PERSON">Maggot</name>, a queen among
                    farmers' wives. Take your greedy hands away, and I'll serve them.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbits have a passion for mushrooms, surpassing even the greediest likings of Big
                People. A fact which partly explains young <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s long expeditions to the renowned
                fields of the <name type="ORG">Ma<name type="GPE">ri</name>sh</name>, and the wrath of the injured <name type="PERSON">Maggot</name>. On this occasion there
                was plenty for all, even according to hobbit standards. There were also many other
                things to follow, and when they had finished even <name type="PERSON">Fatty</name> <name type="PERSON">Bolger</name> heaved a sigh of
                con<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>t. They pushed back the table, and drew c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>rs round the fire.</p>
            <p><q>'We'll clear up later,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'Now tell me all about it! I guess that
                    you have been having adventures, which was not quite fair without me. I <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t a
                    full account; and most of all I <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t to know what was the matter with old
                    <name type="PERSON">Maggot</name>, and why he spoke to me like that. He sounded almost as if he was
                    _scared,_ if that is possible.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'We have all been scared,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> after a pause, in which <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> stared at
                the fire and did not speak. <q>'You would have been, too, if you had been chased for
                    <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> <name type="DATE">day</name>s by <name type="ORG">Black</name> <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s.'</q></p>
            <p>
                <q>'And what are they?'</q>
            </p>
            <p><q>'<name type="ORG">Black</name> figures <name type="GPE">ri</name>ding on black horses,'</q> answered <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q>'If <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> won't
                    talk, I will tell you the whole tale from the beginning.'</q> He then gave a
                full account of their journey from the time when they left <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbiton. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> gave
                va<name type="GPE">ri</name>ous supporting nods and exclamations. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> remained silent.</p>
            <p><q>'I should think you were making it all up,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>, <q>'if I had not seen
                    that black shape on the landing-stage � and heard the queer sound in <name type="PERSON">Maggot</name>'s
                    voice. What do you make of it all, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>?'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Cousin <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> has been very close,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q>'But the time has come for
                    him to open out. So far we have been given nothing more to go on than <name type="LOC">Far</name>mer
                    <name type="PERSON">Maggot</name>'s guess that it has something to do with old <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>'s treasure.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'That was only a guess,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> hastily. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Maggot</name> does not
                    _know_anything.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Old <name type="PERSON">Maggot</name> is a shrewd fellow,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'A lot goes on behind his
                    round face that does not come out in his talk. I've heard that he used to go
                    into the Old <name type="ORG">Forest</name> at <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> time, and he has the reputation of knowing a good
                    many strange things. But you can at least tell us, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, whether you think his
                    guess good or bad.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'I _think,'</q>_ answered <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> slowly, <q>'that it was a good guess, as far as it
                    goes. There _is a_ connexion with <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>'s old adventures, and the <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s are
                    looking, or perhaps <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> ought to say _sear<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g,_ for him or for me. I also
                    fear, if you <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t to know, that it is no joke at all; and that I am not safe
                    here or anywhere else.'</q> He looked round at the windows and walls, as if he
                was afraid they would suddenly give way. The others looked at him in silence, and
                exchanged meaning glances among themselves.</p>
            <p><q>'It's coming out in <name type="TIME">a minute</name>,'</q> whispered <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> to <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> nodded.</p>
            <p><q>'Well!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> at last, sitting up and straigh<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing his back, as if he
                had made a decision. <q>'I can't keep it dark any longer. I have got something to
                    tell you all. But I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t know quite how to begin.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'I think I could help you,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> quietly, <q>'by telling you some of it
                    myself.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'What do you mean?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, looking at him anxiously. <q>'Just this, my
                    dear old <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>: you are miserable, because you <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t know how to say good-bye.
                    You meant to leave the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>, of course. But danger has come on you so<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>r than
                    you expected, and now you are making up your mind to go at once. And you <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t
                    <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t to. We are very sorry for you.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> opened his mouth and shut it again. His look of surp<name type="GPE">ri</name>se was so comical that
                they laughed. <q>'Dear old <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q>'Did you really think you had
                    thrown dust in all our eyes? You have not been nearly careful or clever enough
                    for that! You have obviously been planning to go and saying farewell to all your
                    haunts all <name type="DATE">this <name type="DATE">year</name></name> since <name type="DATE">Ap<name type="GPE">ri</name>l</name>. We have constantly heard you mutte<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng: "Shall
                    I ever look down into that valley again, I wonder", and things like that. And
                    pre<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ding that you had come to the end of your m<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>y, and actually selling your
                    beloved <name type="FAC">Bag End</name> to those Sackville-<name type="PERSON">Baggins</name>es! And all those close talks with
                    <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Good heavens!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'I thought I had been both careful and clever.
                    I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t know what <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> would say. Is all the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> discussing my departure
                    then?'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Oh no!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Don</name>'t worry about that! The <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret won't keep for
                    long, of course; but at present it is, I think, only known to us conspirators.
                    After all, you must remember that we know you well, and are of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> with you. We
                    can usually guess what you are thinking. I knew <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>, too. To tell you the
                    truth, I had been wat<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g you rather closely ever since he left. I thought you
                    would go after him so<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>r or later; indeed I expected you to go so<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>r, and
                    lately we have been very anxious. We have been ter<name type="GPE">ri</name>fied that you might give us
                    the slip, and go off suddenly, all on your own like he did. Ever since this
                    sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng we have kept our eyes open, and <name type="PERSON">don</name>e a good deal of planning on our own
                    account. You are not going to escape so easily!'</q></p>
            <p><q>'But I must go,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'It cannot be helped, dear f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends. It is
                    wretched for us all, but it is no use your trying to keep me. Since you have
                    guessed so much, please help me and do not hinder me!'</q></p>
            <p><q>'You do not understand!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q>'You must go � and therefore we must,
                    too. <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> and I are coming with you. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> is an excellent fellow, and would jump
                    down a dragon's throat to save you, if he did not t<name type="GPE">ri</name>p over his own feet; but
                    you will need <name type="CARDINAL">more than <name type="CARDINAL">one</name></name> companion in your dangerous adventure.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'My dear and most beloved hobbits!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> deeply moved. <q>'But I could
                    not allow it. I decided that <name type="DATE">long ago</name>, too. You speak of danger, but you do not
                    understand. This is no treasure-hunt, no there-and-back journey. I am flying
                    from deadly pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>l into deadly pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>l.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Of course we understand,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> firmly. <q>'That is why we have decided
                    to come. We know the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> is no laughing-matter; but we are going to do our best
                    to help you against the Enemy.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'The <name type="ORG">Ring</name>!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, now completely amazed.</p>
            <p><q>'Yes, the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'My dear old hobbit, you <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t allow for the
                    inquisitiveness of f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends. I have known about the exis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ce of the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> for
                    <name type="DATE">year</name>s � before <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> went away, in fact; but since he obviously regarded it as
                    <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret, I kept the knowledge in my head, until we formed our conspiracy. I did
                    not know <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>, of course, as well as I know you; I was too young, and he was
                    also more careful � but he was not careful enough. If you <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t to know how I
                    <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> found out, I will tell you.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Go on!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> faintly.</p>
            <p>'It was the Sackville-<name type="PERSON">Baggins</name>es that were his downfall, as you might expect. <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> <name type="DATE">day</name>,
                <name type="DATE">a <name type="DATE">year</name></name> before the <name type="ORG">Party</name>, I happened to be walking along the road, when I saw <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>
                ahead. Suddenly in the distance the <name type="WORK_OF_ART">S.-B.s</name> appeared, coming towards us. <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> slowed
                down, and then hey presto! he vanished. I was so startled that I hardly had the wits
                to hide myself in a more ordinary fashion; but I got through the hedge and walked
                along the field inside. I was peeping through into the road, after the <name type="WORK_OF_ART">S.-B.s</name> had
                passed, and was looking straight at <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> when he suddenly reappeared. I caught a
                glint of gold as he put something back in his trouser-pocket.</p>
            <p>
                <q>'After that I kept my eyes open. In fact, I confess that I spied. But you must
                    admit that it was very int<name type="GPE">ri</name>guing, and I was only in my teens. I must be the
                    only <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> in the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>, besides you <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, that has ever seen the old fellow's
                    <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret book.'</q>
            </p>
            <p><q>'You have read his book!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'Good heavens above! Is nothing
                    safe?'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Not too safe, I should say,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'But I have only had <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> rapid
                    glance, and that was difficult to get. He never left the book about. I wonder
                    what became of it. I should like another look. Have you got it, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>?'</q></p>
            <p>
                <q>'No. It was not at <name type="FAC">Bag End</name>. He must have taken it away.'</q>
            </p>
            <p><q>'Well, as I was saying,'</q> <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> proceeded, <q>'I kept my knowledge to myself,
                    till this <name type="DATE">Sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng</name> when things got se<name type="GPE">ri</name>ous. Then we formed our conspiracy; and as
                    we were se<name type="GPE">ri</name>ous, too, and meant business, we have not been too scrupulous. You
                    are not a very easy nut to crack, and <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> is worse. But if you <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t to be
                    introduced to our chief investigator, I can produce him.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Where is he?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, looking round, as if he expected a masked and
                sinister figure to come out of a cupboard.</p>
            <p><q>'Step forward, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>; and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> stood up with a face scarlet <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name>
                the ears. <q>'Here's our collector of information! And he collected a lot, I can
                    tell you, before he was finally caught. After which, I may say, he seemed to
                    regard himself as on parole, and d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed up.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Sam</name>!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, feeling that amazement could go no further, and quite
                unable to decide whether he felt angry, amused, relieved, or merely foolish.</p>
            <p><q>'Yes, sir!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <q>'Begging your par<name type="PERSON">don</name>, sir! But I meant no wrong to
                    you, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, nor to Mr. <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> for that matter. _He_ has some sense, mind
                    you; and when you said _go al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>,_ he said _no! lake some<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> as you can
                    trust.'</q>_</p>
            <p><q>'But it does not seem that I can trust any<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> looked at him
                unhappily. <q>'It all depends on what you <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t,'</q> put in <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'You can trust
                    us to stick to you through thick and thin � to the bitter end. And you can trust
                    us to keep any <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret of yours � closer than you keep it yourself. But you
                    cannot trust us to let you face trouble al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, and go off without a word. We are
                    your f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. Anyway: there it is. We know most of what <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> has told
                    you. We know a good deal about the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>. We are hor<name type="GPE">ri</name>bly afraid � but we are
                    coming with you; or following you like hounds.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'And after all, sir,'</q> added <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, <q>'you did ought to take the <name type="ORG">Elves</name>' advice.
                    <name type="PERSON">Gildor</name> said you should take them as was willing, and you can't deny it.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t deny it,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, looking at <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, who was now g<name type="GPE">ri</name>nning. 'I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t
                deny it, but I'll never believe you are sleeping again, whether you snore or not. I
                shall kick you hard to make sure.</p>
            <p><q>'You are a set of deceitful scoundrels!'</q> he said, turning to the others.
                    <q>'But bless you!'</q> he laughed, getting up and waving his arms, <q>'I give
                    in. I will take <name type="PERSON">Gildor</name>'s advice. If the danger were not so dark, I should dance
                    for joy. Even so, I cannot help feeling happy; happier than I have felt for a
                    long time. I had dreaded this <name type="TIME">evening</name>.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Good! That's settled. <name type="PERSON">Thr</name>ee cheers for Captain <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and company!'</q> they
                shouted; and they danced round him. <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> began a song, which they had
                apparently got ready for the occasion.</p>
            <p>It was made on the model of the dwarf-song that started <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> on his adventure long
                ago, and went to the same tune:</p>
            <p><name type="LOC">Far</name>ewell we call to h<name type="LOC">earth</name> and hall!</p>
            <p>Though wind may blow and rain may fall,</p>
            <p>We must away ere break of <name type="DATE">day</name></p>
            <p><name type="LOC">Far</name> over wood and mountain tall.</p>
            <p>To <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name>, where <name type="ORG">Elves</name> yet dwell</p>
            <p>In glades beneath the misty fell,</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Thr</name>ough moor and waste we <name type="GPE">ri</name>de in haste,</p>
            <p>And whither then we cannot tell.</p>
            <p>With foes ahead, behind us dread,</p>
            <p>Beneath the sky shall be our bed,</p>
            <p>Until at last our toil be passed,</p>
            <p>Our journey <name type="PERSON">don</name>e, our errand sped.</p>
            <p>We must away! We must away!</p>
            <p>We <name type="GPE">ri</name>de before the break of <name type="DATE">day</name>!</p>
            <p><q>'Very good!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'But in that case there are a lot of things to do
                    before we go to bed � under a roof, for to<name type="TIME">night</name> at any rate.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Oh! That was poetry!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q>'Do you really mean to start before the
                    break of <name type="DATE">day</name>?'</q></p>
            <p><q>'I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t know,'</q> answered <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'I fear those <name type="ORG">Black</name> <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s, and I am sure
                    it is unsafe to stay in <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> place long, especially in a place to which it is
                    known I was going. Also <name type="PERSON">Gildor</name> advised me not to wait. But I should very much
                    like to see <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. I could see that even <name type="PERSON">Gildor</name> was disturbed when he heard
                    that <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> had never appeared. It really depends on <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> things. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w soon could
                    the <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s get to <name type="ORG">Bucklebury</name>? And how soon could we get off? It will take a good
                    deal of preparation.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'The answer to the <name type="ORG">sec</name>ond question,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>, <q>'is that we could get off
                    in <name type="TIME">an <name type="TIME">hour</name></name>. I have prepared practically everything. There are <name type="CARDINAL">six</name> ponies in a
                    stable across the fields; stores and tackle are all packed, except for a few
                    extra clothes, and the pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>shable food.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'It seems to have been a very efficient conspiracy,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'But what
                    about the <name type="ORG">Black</name> <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s? Would it be safe to wait <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> <name type="DATE">day</name> for <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>?'</q></p>
            <p><q>'That all depends on what you think the <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s would do, if they found you
                    here,'</q> answered <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'They _could_ have reached here by now, of course,
                    if they were not stopped at the <name type="LOC">North</name>-gate, where the <name type="ORG">Hedge</name> runs down to the
                    <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver-bank, just this side of the <name type="FAC">B<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge</name>. The gate-guards would not let them
                    through by <name type="TIME">night</name>, though they might break through. Even in the <name type="DATE">day</name>light they
                    would try to keep them out, I think, at any rate until they got a message
                    through to the Master of the <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>l � for they would not like the look of the
                    <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s, and would certainly be f<name type="GPE">ri</name>gh<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed by them. But, of course, <name type="PERSON">Buckland</name>
                    cannot resist a determined attack for long. And it is possible that in the
                    <name type="TIME">morning</name> even a <name type="ORG">Black</name> <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name> that rode up and asked for Mr. <name type="PERSON">Baggins</name> would be let
                    through. It is pretty generally known that you are coming back to live at
                    <name type="ORG">C<name type="GPE">ri</name>ckhollow</name>.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> sat for a while in thought. <q>'I have made up my mind,'</q> he said finally.
                    <q>'I am starting to<name type="DATE">morrow</name>, as soon as it is light. But I am not going by road:
                    it would be safer to wait here than that. If I go through the <name type="LOC">North</name>-gate my
                    departure from <name type="PERSON">Buckland</name> will be known at once, instead of being <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret for
                    several <name type="DATE">day</name>s at least, as it might be. And what is more, the <name type="FAC">B<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge</name> and the <name type="LOC">East</name>
                    <name type="FAC">Road</name> near the borders will certainly be watched, whether any <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name> gets into
                    <name type="PERSON">Buckland</name> or not. We <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t know how many there are; but there are <name type="CARDINAL">at least <name type="CARDINAL">two</name></name>,
                    and possibly more. The only thing to do is to go off in a quite unexpected
                    direction.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'But that can only mean going into the Old <name type="ORG">Forest</name>!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Fredegar</name> hor<name type="GPE">ri</name>fied.
                    <q>'You can't be thinking of doing that. It is quite as dangerous as <name type="ORG">Black</name>
                    <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Not quite,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. It sounds very desperate, but I believe <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> is
                <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght. It is the only way of getting off without being followed at once. With luck
                we might gel a considerable start.'</p>
            <p><q>'But you won't have any luck in the Old <name type="ORG">Forest</name>,'</q> objected <name type="PERSON">Fredegar</name>. <q>'No <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>
                    ever has luck in there. You'll gel lost. People <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t go in there.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Oh yes they do!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'The <name type="ORG">Brand</name>ybucks go in � occasionally when
                    the fit takes them. We have a p<name type="GPE">ri</name>vate entrance. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> went in once, <name type="DATE">long ago</name>. I
                    have been in several times: usually in <name type="DATE">day</name>light, of course, when the trees are
                    sleepy and fairly quiet.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Well, do as you think best!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Fredegar</name>. <q>'I am more afraid of the Old
                    <name type="ORG">Forest</name> than of anything I know about: the sto<name type="GPE">ri</name>es about it are <name type="TIME">a <name type="TIME">night</name></name><name type="PERSON">mar</name>e; but
                    my vote hardly counts, as I am not going on the journey. Still, I am very glad
                    some<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> is stopping behind, who can tell <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> what you have <name type="PERSON">don</name>e, when he
                    turns up, as I am sure he will before long.'</q></p>
            <p>Fond as he was of <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, <name type="PERSON">Fatty</name> <name type="PERSON">Bolger</name> had no desire to leave the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>, nor to see
                what lay outside it. His family came from the <name type="LOC">East</name>farthing, from <name type="ORG">Budge<name type="ORG">ford</name></name> in
                <name type="FAC">B<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge</name>fields in fact, but he had never been over the <name type="ORG">Brand</name>ywine <name type="FAC">B<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge</name>. His task,
                according to the o<name type="GPE">ri</name>ginal plans of the conspirators, was to stay behind and deal
                with inquisitive folk, and to keep up as long as possible the pre<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ce that Mr.
                <name type="PERSON">Baggins</name> was still living at <name type="ORG">C<name type="GPE">ri</name>ckhollow</name>. He had even brought along some old clothes
                of <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s to help him in playing the part. They little thought how dangerous that
                part might prove.</p>
            <p><q>'Excellent!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, when he understood the plan. <q>'We could not have
                    left any message behind for <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> otherwise. I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t know whether these <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s
                    can read or not, of course, but I should not have dared to <name type="GPE">ri</name>sk a w<name type="GPE">ri</name>t<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>
                    message, in case they got in and searched the house. But if <name type="PERSON">Fatty</name> is willing to
                    hold the fort, and I can be sure of <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> knowing the way we have g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, that
                    decides me. I am going into the Old <name type="ORG">Forest</name> <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> thing to<name type="DATE">morrow</name>.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Well, that's that,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q>'On the whole I would rather have our job
                    than <name type="PERSON">Fatty</name>'s � waiting here till <name type="ORG">Black</name> <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s come.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'You wait till you are well inside the <name type="ORG">Forest</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Fredegar</name>. <q>'You'll wish
                    you were back here with me before this time to<name type="DATE">morrow</name>.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'It's no good arguing about it any more,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'We have still got to
                    tidy up and put the finishing touches to the packing, before we get to bed. I
                    shall call you all before the break of <name type="DATE">day</name>.'</q></p>
            <p>When at last he had got to bed, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> could not sleep for some time. His legs ached.
                He. was glad that he was <name type="GPE">ri</name>ding in the <name type="TIME">morning</name>. Eventually he fell into a vague
                dream, in which he seemed to be looking out of a high window over a dark sea of
                tangled trees. Down below among the roots there was the sound of creatures crawling
                and snuffling. He felt sure they would smell him out so<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>r or later.</p>
            <p>Then he heard a noise in the distance. At <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> he thought it was a great wind coming
                over the leaves of the forest. Then he knew that it was not leaves, but the sound of
                the <name type="LOC">Sea</name> far-off; a sound he had never heard in waking life, though it had of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>
                troubled his dreams. Suddenly he found he was out in the open. There were no trees
                after all. He was on a dark heath, and there was a strange salt smell in the air.
                <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>oking up he saw before him a tall white tower, standing al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> on a high <name type="GPE">ri</name>dge. A
                great desire came over him to climb the tower and see the <name type="LOC">Sea</name>. He started to
                struggle up the <name type="GPE">ri</name>dge towards the tower: but suddenly a light came in the sky, and
                there was a noise of thunder.</p>

            <p>The Old <name type="ORG">Forest</name></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> woke suddenly. It was still dark in the room. <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> was standing there with a
                candle in <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> hand, and banging on the door with the other. <q>'All <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght! What is
                    it?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, still shaken and bewildered.</p>
            <p><q>'What is it!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'It is time to get up. It is <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> past <name type="CARDINAL">four</name> and
                    very foggy. Come on! <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> is already getting breakfast ready. Even <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> is up.
                    I am just going to saddle the ponies, and fetch the <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> that is to be the
                    baggage-car<name type="GPE">ri</name>er. Wake that sluggard <name type="PERSON">Fatty</name>! At least he must get up and see us
                    off.'</q></p>
            <p>Soon after <name type="CARDINAL">six</name> o'clock the <name type="CARDINAL">five</name> hobbits were ready to start. <name type="PERSON">Fatty</name> <name type="PERSON">Bolger</name> was still
                yawning. They stole quietly out of the house. <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> went in front leading a laden
                pony, and took his way along a path that went through a spinney behind the house,
                and then cut across several fields. The leaves of trees were glis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing, and every
                twig was d<name type="GPE">ri</name>pping; the grass was grey with cold dew. Everything was still, and
                far-away noises seemed near and clear: fowls chatte<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng in a yard, some<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> closing a
                door of a distant house.</p>
            <p>In their shed they found the ponies; sturdy little beasts of the kind loved by
                hobbits, not speedy, but good for <name type="DATE">a long <name type="DATE">day</name></name>'s work. They mounted, and soon they
                were <name type="GPE">ri</name>ding off into the mist, which seemed to open reluctantly before them and
                close forbiddingly behind them. After <name type="GPE">ri</name>ding for <name type="TIME">about <name type="TIME">an <name type="TIME">hour</name></name></name>, slowly and without
                talking, they saw the <name type="ORG">Hedge</name> looming suddenly ahead. It was tall and netted over with
                silver cobwebs. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w are you going to get through this?'</q> asked <name type="PERSON">Fredegar</name>.
                    <q>'Follow me!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>, <q>'and you will see.'</q> He turned to the left
                along the <name type="ORG">Hedge</name>, and soon they came to a point where it bent inwards, running along
                the lip of a hollow. A cutting had been made, at some distance from the <name type="ORG">Hedge</name>, and
                went sloping gently down into the ground. It had walls of b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ck at the sides, which
                rose steadily, until suddenly they arched over and formed a tunnel that dived deep
                under the <name type="ORG">Hedge</name> and came out in the hollow on the other side.</p>
            <p>Here <name type="PERSON">Fatty</name> <name type="PERSON">Bolger</name> halted. <q>'Good-bye, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>!'</q> he said. <q>'I wish you were not
                    going into the <name type="ORG">Forest</name>. I only hope you will not need rescuing before the <name type="DATE">day</name> is
                    out. But good luck to you � to<name type="DATE">day</name> and every <name type="DATE">day</name>!'</q></p>
            <p><q>'If there are no worse things ahead than the Old <name type="ORG">Forest</name>, I shall be lucky,'</q>
                said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'Tell <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> to hurry along the <name type="LOC">East</name> <name type="FAC">Road</name>: we shall soon be back on
                    it and going as fast as we can.'</q>
                <q>'Good-bye!'</q> they c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed, and rode down the slope and disappeared from
                <name type="PERSON">Fredegar</name>'s sight into the tunnel.</p>
            <p>It was dark and damp. At the far end it was closed by a gate of thick-set iron bars.
                <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> got down and unlocked the gate, and when they had all passed through he pushed
                it to again. It shut with a clang, and the lock clicked. The sound was ominous.</p>
            <p><q>'There!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'You have left the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>, and are now outside, and on
                    the edge of the Old <name type="ORG">Forest</name>.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Are the sto<name type="GPE">ri</name>es about it true?'</q> asked <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>.</p>
            <p><q>'I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t know what sto<name type="GPE">ri</name>es you mean,'</q> <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> answered. <q>'If you mean the old
                    bogey-sto<name type="GPE">ri</name>es <name type="PERSON">Fatty</name>'s nurses used to tell him, about goblins and wolves and
                    things of that sort, I should say no. At any rate I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t believe them. But the
                    <name type="ORG">Forest</name> _is_ queer. Everything in it is very much more alive, more aware of what
                    is going on, so to speak, than things are in the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>. And the trees do not
                    like strangers. They watch you. They are usually con<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>t merely to watch you, as
                    long as <name type="DATE">day</name>light lasts, and <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t do much. Occasionally the most unf<name type="GPE">ri</name>endly <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s
                    may drop a branch, or stick a root out, or grasp at you with a long trailer. But
                    at <name type="TIME">night</name> things can be most alarming, or so I am told. I have only once or twice
                    been in here after dark, and then only near the hedge. I thought all the trees
                    were whispe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng to each other, passing news and plots along in an unintelligible
                    language; and the branches swayed and groped without any wind. They do say the
                    trees do actually move, and can surround strangers and hem them in. In fact long
                    ago they attacked the <name type="ORG">Hedge</name>: they came and planted themselves <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght by it, and
                    leaned over it. But the hobbits came and cut down <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name>s of trees, and made a
                    great bonfire in the <name type="ORG">Forest</name>, and burned all the ground in a long st<name type="GPE">ri</name>p east of
                    the <name type="ORG">Hedge</name>. After that the trees gave up the attack, but they became very
                    unf<name type="GPE">ri</name>endly. There is still a wide bare space not far inside where the bonfire
                    was made.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Is it only the trees that are dangerous?'</q> asked <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>.</p>
            <p><q>'There are va<name type="GPE">ri</name>ous queer things living deep in the <name type="ORG">Forest</name>, and on the far
                    side,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>, <q>'or at least I have heard so; but I have never seen
                    any of them. But something makes paths. Whenever <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> comes inside <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> finds open
                    tracks; but they seem to shift and change from time to time in a queer fashion.
                    Not far from this tunnel there is, or was for a long time, the beginning of
                    quite a broad path leading to <name type="FAC">the Bonfire Glade</name>, and then on more or less in our
                    direction, east and a little north. That is the path I am going to try and
                    find.'</q></p>
            <p>The hobbits now left the tunnel-gate and rode across the wide hollow. On the far side
                was a faint path leading up on to the floor of the <name type="ORG">Forest</name>, <name type="CARDINAL">a <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name></name> yards and more
                beyond the <name type="ORG">Hedge</name>; but it vanished as soon as it brought them under the trees.
                <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>oking back they could see the dark line of the <name type="ORG">Hedge</name> through the stems of trees
                that were already thick about them. <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>oking ahead they could see only tree-trunks of
                innumerable sizes and shapes: straight or bent, twisted, leaning, squat or slender,
                smooth or gnarled and branched; and all the stems were green or grey with moss and
                slimy, shaggy growths.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Merry</name> al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> seemed fairly cheerful. <q>'You had better lead on and find that
                    path,'</q> <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> said to him. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Don</name>'t let us lose <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> another, or forget which
                    way the <name type="ORG">Hedge</name> lies!'</q></p>
            <p>They picked a way among the trees, and their ponies plodded along, carefully avoiding
                the many w<name type="GPE">ri</name>thing and interlacing roots. There was no undergrowth. The ground was
                <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing steadily, and as they went forward it seemed that the trees became taller,
                darker, and thicker. There was no sound, except an occasional d<name type="GPE">ri</name>p of moisture
                falling through the still leaves. For the moment there was no whispe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng or movement
                among the branches; but they all got an uncomfortable feeling that they were being
                watched with disapproval, deepening to dislike and even enmity. The feeling steadily
                grew, until they found themselves looking up quickly, or glancing back over their
                shoulders, as if they expected a sudden blow.</p>
            <p>There was not as yet any sign of a path, and the trees seemed constantly to bar their
                way. <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> suddenly felt that he could not bear it any longer, and without warning
                let out a shout. <q>'Oi! Oi!'</q> he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed. <q>'I am not going to do anything. Just
                    let me pass through, will you!'</q></p>
            <p>The others halted startled; but the cry fell as if muffled by a heavy curtain. There
                was no echo or answer though the wood seemed to become more crowded and more
                watchful than before.</p>
            <p><q>'I should not shout, if I were you,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. It does more harm than
                good.'</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> began to wonder if it were possible to find a way through, and if he had been
                <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght to make the others come into this abominable wood. <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> was looking from side
                to side, and seemed already uncertain which way to go. <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> noticed it. <q>'It has
                    not taken you long to lose us,'</q> he said. But at that moment <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> gave a
                whistle of relief and pointed ahead.</p>
            <p><q>'Well, well!'</q> he said. <q>'These trees _do_ shift. There is <name type="FAC">the Bonfire Glade</name>
                    in front of us (or I hope so), but the path to it seems to have moved
                away!'</q></p>
            <p>The light grew clearer as they went forward. Suddenly they came out of the trees and
                found themselves in a wide circular space. There was sky above them, blue and clear
                to their surp<name type="GPE">ri</name>se, for down under the <name type="ORG">Forest</name>-roof they had not been able to see the
                <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing <name type="TIME">morning</name> and the lifting of the mist. The sun was not, however, high enough
                yet to shine down into the clea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng, though its light was on the tree-tops. The
                leaves were all thicker and greener about the edges of the glade, enclosing it with
                an almost solid wall. No tree grew there, only rough grass and many tall plants:
                stalky and faded hemlocks and wood-parsley, fire-weed seeding into fluffy ashes, and
                rampant nettles and thistles. A dreary place: but it seemed a charming and cheerful
                garden after the close <name type="ORG">Forest</name>.</p>
            <p>The hobbits felt encouraged, and looked up hopefully at the broadening <name type="DATE">day</name>light in
                the sky. At the far side of the glade there was a break in the wall of trees, and a
                clear path beyond it. They could see it running on into the wood, wide in places and
                open above, though every now and again the trees drew in and overshadowed it with
                their dark boughs. Up this path they rode. They were still climbing gently, but they
                now went much quicker, and with better heart; for it seemed to them that the <name type="ORG">Forest</name>
                had relented, and was going to let them pass unhindered after all.</p>
            <p>But after a while the air began to get hot and stuffy. The trees drew close again on
                either side, and they could no longer see far ahead. Now stronger than ever they
                felt again the ill will of the wood pressing on them. So silent was it that <name type="DATE">the fall</name>
                of their ponies' hoofs, rustling on dead leaves and occasionally stumbling on hidden
                roots, seemed to thud in their ears. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed to sing a song to encourage them,
                but his voice sank to a murmur.</p>
            <p>O! Wanderers in the shadowed land</p>
            <p>despair not! For though dark they stand,</p>
            <p>all woods there be must end at last,</p>
            <p>and see the open sun go past:</p>
            <p>the setting sun, the <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing sun,</p>
            <p>the <name type="DATE">day</name>'s end, or the <name type="DATE">day</name> begun.</p>
            <p>For east or west all woods must fail ...</p>
            <p>_Fail -_ even as he said the word his voice faded into silence. The air seemed heavy
                and the making of words wea<name type="GPE">ri</name>some. Just behind them a large branch fell from an old
                overhanging tree with a crash into the path. The trees seemed to close in before
                them.</p>
            <p><q>'They do not like all that about ending and failing,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'I should
                    not sing any more at present. Wait till we do get to the edge, and then we'll
                    turn and give them a rousing chorus!'</q></p>
            <p>He spoke cheerfully, and if he felt any great anxiety, he did not show it. The others
                did not answer. They were depressed. A heavy w<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name> was settling steadily on <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s
                heart, and he regretted now with every step forward that he had ever thought of
                challenging the menace of the trees. He was, indeed, just about to stop and propose
                going back (if that was still possible), when things took a new turn. The path
                stopped climbing, and became for a while nearly level. The dark trees drew aside,
                and ahead they could see the path going almost straight forward. Before them, but
                some distance off, there stood a green hill-top, treeless, <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing like a bald head
                out of the encircling wood. The path seemed to be making directly for it.</p>
            <p>They now hur<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed forward again, delighted with the thought of climbing out for a
                while above the roof of the <name type="ORG">Forest</name>. The path dipped, and then again began to climb
                upwards, leading them at last to the foot of the steep hillside. There it left the
                trees and faded into the turf. The wood stood all round the hill like thick <name type="PERSON">hai</name>r
                that ended sharply in a circle round a shaven crown.</p>
            <p>The hobbits led their ponies up, winding round and round until they reached the top.
                There they stood and gazed about them. The air was gleaming and sunlit, but hazy;
                and they could not see to any great distance. Near at hand the mist was now almost
                g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>; though here and there it lay in hollows of the wood, and to the south of them,
                out of a deep fold cutting <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght across the <name type="ORG">Forest</name>, the fog still rose like steam or
                wisps of white smoke.</p>
            <p><q>'That,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>, pointing with his hand, <q>'that is the line of the
                    <name type="ORG">Withywindle</name>. It comes down out of the <name type="LOC">Downs</name> and flows south-west through the
                    midst of the <name type="ORG">Forest</name> to join the <name type="ORG">Brand</name>ywine below <name type="LOC">Haysend</name>. We <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t to go
                    _that_ way! <name type="LOC">The <name type="ORG">Withywindle</name> valley</name> is said to be the queerest part of the whole
                    wood � the centre from which all the queerness comes, as it were.'</q></p>
            <p>The others looked in the direction that <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> pointed out, but they could see little
                but mists over the damp and deep-cut valley; and beyond it the southern <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> of the
                <name type="ORG">Forest</name> faded from view.</p>
            <p>The sun on the hill-lop was now getting hot. It must have been about eleven o'clock;
                but the <name type="DATE">autumn</name> haze still prevented them from seeing much in other directions. In
                the west they could not make out either the line of the <name type="ORG">Hedge</name> or the valley of the
                <name type="ORG">Brand</name>ywine beyond it. <name type="LOC">North</name>ward, where they looked most hopefully, they could see
                nothing that might be the line of the great <name type="LOC">East</name> <name type="FAC">Road</name>, for which they were making.
                They were on an island in a sea of trees, and the ho<name type="GPE">ri</name>zon was veiled.</p>
            <p>On the south-eastern side the ground fell very steeply, as if the slopes of the hill
                were continued far down under the trees, like island-shores that really are the
                sides of a mountain <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing out of deep waters. They sat on the green edge and looked
                out over the woods below them, while they ate their mid-<name type="DATE">day</name> meal. As the sun rose
                and passed <name type="TIME">noon</name> they glimpsed far off in the east the grey-green lines of the <name type="LOC">Downs</name>
                that lay beyond the Old <name type="ORG">Forest</name> on that side. That cheered them greatly; for it was
                good to see a sight of anything beyond the wood's borders, though they did not mean
                to go that way, if they could help it: the <name type="ORG">Barrow</name>-downs had as sinister a reputation
                in hobbit-legend as the <name type="ORG">Forest</name> itself.</p>
            <p>At length they made up their minds to go on again. The path that had brought them to
                the hill reappeared on the northward side; but they had not followed it far before
                they became aware that it was bending steadily to the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght. Soon it began to
                descend rapidly and they guessed that it must actually be heading towards the
                <name type="ORG">Withywindle</name> valley: not at all the direction they wished lo take. After some
                discussion they decided to leave this misleading path and st<name type="GPE">ri</name>ke northward; for
                although they had not been able to see it from the hill-top, the <name type="FAC">Road</name> must lie that
                way, and it could not be many miles off. Also northward, and to the left of the
                path, the land seemed lo be d<name type="GPE">ri</name>er and more open, climbing <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name> slopes where the
                trees were thinner, and pines and firs replaced the oaks and ashes and other strange
                and nameless trees of the denser wood.</p>
            <p>At <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> their choice seemed to be good: they got along at a fair speed, though
                whenever they got a glimpse of the sun in an open glade they seemed unaccountably to
                have veered eastwards. But after a time the trees began to close in again, just
                where they had appeared from a distance to be thinner and less tangled. Then deep
                folds in the ground were discovered unexpectedly, like the ruts of great
                giant-wheels or wide moats and sunken roads long disused and choked with brambles.
                These lay usually <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght across their line of <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ch, and could only be crossed by
                scrambling down and out again, which was troublesome and difficult with their
                ponies. Each time they climbed down they found the hollow filled with thick <name type="PERSON">bush</name>es
                and matted undergrowth, which somehow would not yield to the left, but only gave way
                when they turned to the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght; and they had to go some distance along the bot<name type="PERSON">tom</name>
                before they could find a way up the further bank. Each time they clambered out, the
                trees seemed deeper and darker; and always to the left and upwards it was most
                difficult to find a way, and they were forced to the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght and downwards.</p>
            <p>After <name type="TIME">an <name type="TIME">hour</name></name> or <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> they had lost all clear sense of direction, though they knew
                well enough that they had long ceased to go northward at all. They were being headed
                off, and were simply following a course chosen for them � eastwards and southwards,
                into the heart of the <name type="ORG">Forest</name> and not out of it.</p>
            <p><name type="TIME">The <name type="TIME">after<name type="TIME">noon</name></name></name> was wea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng away when they scrambled and stumbled into a fold that was
                wider and deeper than any they had yet met. It was so sleep and overhung that it
                proved impossible to climb out of it again, either forwards or backwards, without
                leaving their ponies and their baggage behind. All they could do was to follow the
                fold � downwards. The ground grew soft, and in places boggy; sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ngs appeared in the
                banks, and soon they found themselves following a brook that t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ckled and babbled
                through a weedy bed. Then the ground began to fall rapidly, and the brook growing
                strong and noisy, flowed and leaped swiftly downhill. They were in a deep dim-lit
                gully over-arched by trees high above them.</p>
            <p>After stumbling along for some way along the stream, they came quite suddenly out of
                the gloom. As if through a gate they saw the sunlight before them. Coming to the
                opening they found that they had made their way down through a cleft in a high sleep
                bank, almost a cliff. At its feet was a wide space of grass and reeds; and in the
                distance could be glimpsed another bank almost as steep. A golden <name type="TIME">after<name type="TIME">noon</name></name> of late
                sunshine lay warm and drowsy upon the hidden land between. In the midst of it there
                wound lazily a dark <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver of brown water, bordered with ancient willows, arched over
                with willows, blocked with fallen willows, and flecked with <name type="CARDINAL">thousands</name> of faded
                willow-leaves. The air was thick with them, flutte<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng yellow from the branches; for
                there was a warm and gentle breeze blowing softly in the valley, and the reeds were
                rustling, and the willow-boughs were creaking.</p>
            <p><q>'Well, now I have at least some notion of where we are!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'We
                    have come almost in the opposite direction to which we in<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ded. This is the
                    <name type="LOC">River</name> <name type="ORG">Withywindle</name>! I will go on and explore.'</q></p>
            <p>He passed out into the sunshine and disappeared into the long grasses. After a while
                he reappeared, and reported that there was fairly solid ground between the
                cliff-foot and the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver; in some places firm turf went down to the water's edge.
                    <q>'What's more,'</q> he said, <q>'there seems to be something like a footpath
                    winding along on this side of the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver. If we turn left and follow it, we shall
                    be bound to come out on the east side of the <name type="ORG">Forest</name> eventually.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'I dare say!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q>'That is, if the track goes on so far, and does
                    not simply lead us into a bog and leave us there. Who made the track, do you
                    suppose, and why? I am sure it was not for our benefit. I am getting very
                    suspicious of this <name type="ORG">Forest</name> and everything in it, and I begin to believe all the
                    sto<name type="GPE">ri</name>es about it. And have you any idea how far eastward we should have to
                    go?'</q></p>
            <p><q>'No,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>, <q>'I haven't. I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t know in the least how far down the
                    <name type="ORG">Withywindle</name> we are, or who could possibly come here of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> enough to make a path
                    along it. But there is no other way out that I can see or think of.'</q></p>
            <p>There being nothing else for it, they filed out, and <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> led them to the path that
                he had discovered. Everywhere the reeds and grasses were lush and tall, in places
                far above their heads; but once found, the path was easy to follow, as it turned and
                twisted, picking out the sounder ground among the bogs and pools. Here and there it
                passed over other <name type="GPE">ri</name>lls, running down gullies into the <name type="ORG">Withywindle</name> out of the higher
                forest-lands, and at these points there were tree-trunks or bundles of brushwood
                laid carefully across.</p>
            <p>The hobbits began to feel very hot. There were armies of flies of all kinds buzzing
                round their ears, and the <name type="TIME">after<name type="TIME">noon</name></name> sun was burning on their backs. At last they
                came suddenly into a thin shade; great grey branches reached across the path. Each
                step forward became more reluctant than the last. Sleepiness seemed to be creeping
                out of the ground and up their legs, and falling softly out of the air upon their
                heads and eyes.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> felt his <name type="PERSON">chin</name> go down and his head nod. Just in front of him <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> fell
                forward on to his knees. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> halted. <q>'It's no good,'</q> he heard <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> saying.
                    <q>'Can't go another step without rest. Must have nap. It's cool under the
                    willows. Less flies!'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> did not like the sound of this. <q>'Come on!'</q> he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed. <q>'We can't have a
                    nap yet. We must get clear of the <name type="ORG">Forest</name> <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>.'</q> But the others were too far
                g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> to care. Beside them <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> stood yawning and blinking stupidly.</p>
            <p>Suddenly <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> himself felt sleep overwhelming him. His head swam. There now seemed
                hardly a sound in the air. The flies had stopped buzzing. Only a gentle noise on the
                edge of hea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng, a soft flutte<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng as of a song <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> whispered, seemed to stir in
                the boughs above. He lifted his heavy eyes and saw leaning over him a huge
                willow-tree, old and hoary. Enormous it looked, its sprawling branches going up like
                rea<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g arms with many long-fingered hands, its knotted and twisted trunk gaping in
                wide fissures that creaked faintly as the boughs moved. The leaves flutte<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng
                against the b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght sky dazzled him, and he toppled over, lying where he fell upon
                the grass.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Merry</name> and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> dragged themselves forward and lay down with their backs to the
                willow-trunk. Behind them the great cracks <name type="PERSON">gape</name>d wide to receive them as the tree
                swayed and creaked. They looked up at the grey and yellow leaves, moving softly
                against the light, and singing. They shut their eyes, and then it seemed that they
                could almost hear words, cool words, saying something about water and sleep. They
                gave themselves <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name> the spell and fell fast asleep at the foot of the great grey
                willow.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> lay for a while fighting with the sleep that was overpowe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng him; then with an
                effort he struggled to his feel again. He felt a compelling desire for cool water.
                    <q>'Wait for me, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>,'</q> he stammered. <q>'Must bathe feet <name type="TIME">a minute</name>.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Hal</name>f in a dream he <name type="PERSON">wan</name>dered forward to the <name type="GPE">ri</name>verward side of the tree, where great
                winding roots grew out into the stream, like gnarled drag<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>ts straining down to
                d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk. He straddled <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of these, and paddled his hot feel in the cool brown water;
                and there he too suddenly fell asleep with his back against the tree.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> sat down and scratched his head, and yawned like a cavern. He was wor<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed. The
                <name type="TIME">after<name type="TIME">noon</name></name> was getting late, and he thought this sudden sleepiness uncanny.
                    <q>'There's more behind this than sun and warm air,'</q> he muttered to himself.
                    <q>'I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t like this great big tree. I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t trust it. <name type="PERSON">Hark</name> at it singing about
                    sleep now! This won't do at all!'</q></p>
            <p>He pulled himself to his feet, and staggered off to see what had become of the
                ponies. He found that <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> had <name type="PERSON">wan</name>dered on a good way along the path; and he had just
                caught them and brought them back towards the others, when he heard <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> noises; <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>
                loud, and the other soft but very clear. <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> was the splash of something heavy
                falling into the water; the other was a noise like the s<name type="GPE">nick</name> of a lock when a door
                quietly closes fast.</p>
            <p>He rushed back to the bank. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> was in the water close to the edge, and a great
                tree-root seemed to be over him and holding him down, but he was not struggling. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>
                g<name type="GPE">ri</name>pped him by the jacket, and dragged him from under the root; and then with
                difficulty hauled him on to the bank. Almost at once he woke, and coughed and
                spluttered.</p>
            <p><q>'Do you know, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>,'</q> he said at length, <q>'the beastly tree _threw_ me in! I
                    felt it. The big root just twisted round and tipped me in!'</q></p>
            <p><q>'You were dreaming I expect, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <q>'You shouldn't sit in
                    such a place, if you feel sleepy.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'What about the others?'</q> <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> asked. <q>'I wonder what sort of dreams they
                    are having.'</q></p>
            <p>They went round to the other side of the tree, and then <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> understood the click that
                he had heard. <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> had vanished. The crack by which he had laid himself had closed
                together, so that not a <name type="PERSON">chin</name>k could be seen. <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> was trapped: another crack had
                closed about his waist; his legs lay outside, but the rest of him was inside a dark
                opening, the edges of which g<name type="GPE">ri</name>pped like a pair of pincers.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> beat <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> upon the tree-trunk where <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> had lain. They then
                struggled frantically to pull open the jaws of the crack that held poor <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. It
                was quite useless.</p>
            <p><q>'What a foul thing to happen!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> wildly. <q>'Why did we ever come
                    into this dreadful <name type="ORG">Forest</name>? I wish we were all back at <name type="ORG">C<name type="GPE">ri</name>ckhollow</name>!'</q> He
                kicked the tree with all his strength, heedless of his own feet. A hardly
                perceptible shiver ran through the stem and up into the branches; the leaves rustled
                and whispered, but with a sound now of faint and far-off laughter.</p>
            <p><q>'I suppose we haven't got an axe among our luggage, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>?'</q> asked <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>.</p>
            <p><q>'I brought a little hatchet for chopping firewood,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'That
                    wouldn't be much use.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Wait <name type="TIME">a minute</name>!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, struck by an idea suggested by firewood. <q>'We
                    might do something with fire!'</q></p>
            <p><q>'We might,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> doubtfully. <q>'We might succeed in roasting <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>
                    alive inside.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'We might try to hurt or f<name type="GPE">ri</name>gh<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> this tree to begin with,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> fiercely.
                    <q>'If it <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t let them go, I'll have it down, if I have to gnaw it.'</q> He
                ran to the ponies and before long came back with <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> tinder-boxes and a hatchet.</p>
            <p>Quickly they gathered dry grass and leaves, and bits of bark; and made a pile of
                broken twigs and chopped sticks. These they heaped against the trunk on the far side
                of the tree from the p<name type="GPE">ri</name>s<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>rs. As soon as <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> had struck a spark into the tinder,
                it kindled the dry grass and a flurry of flame and smoke went up. The twigs
                crackled. Little fingers of fire licked against the dry scored <name type="GPE">ri</name>nd of the ancient
                tree and scorched it. A tremor ran through the whole willow. The leaves seemed to
                hiss above their heads with a sound of pain and anger. A loud scream came from
                <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>, and from far inside the tree they heard <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> give a muffled yell.</p>
            <p><q>'Put it out! Put it out!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'He'll squeeze me in <name type="CARDINAL">two</name>, if you
                    <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t. He says so!'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Who? What?'</q> shouted <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, rushing round to the other side of the tree.</p>
            <p><q>'Put it out! Put it out!'</q> begged <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. The branches of the willow began to
                sway violently. There was a sound as of a wind <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing and spreading outwards to the
                branches of all the other trees round about, as though they had dropped a st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> into
                the quiet slumber of the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver-valley and set up <name type="GPE">ri</name>pples of anger that ran out over
                the whole <name type="ORG">Forest</name>. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> kicked at the little fire and stamped out the sparks. But
                <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, without any clear idea of why he did so, or what he hoped for, ran along the
                path crying _help! help! help!_It seemed to him that he could hardly hear the sound
                of his own sh<name type="GPE">ri</name>ll voice: it was blown away from him by the willow-wind and drowned
                in a clamour of leaves, as soon as the words left his mouth. He felt desperate: lost
                and witless.</p>
            <p>Suddenly he slopped. There was an answer, or so he thought; but it seemed to come
                from behind him, away down the path further back in the <name type="ORG">Forest</name>. He turned round and
                lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed, and soon there could be no doubt: some<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> was singing a song; a deep glad
                voice was singing carelessly and happily, but it was singing nonsense:</p>
            <p>Hey <name type="PERSON">dol</name>! merry <name type="PERSON">dol</name>! <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng a <name type="PERSON">don</name>g dillo!</p>
            <p><name type="ORG">Ring</name> a <name type="PERSON">don</name>g! hop along! fal lal the willow!</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Tom</name> Bom, jolly <name type="PERSON">Tom</name>, <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> <name type="GPE">Bombadil</name>lo!</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Hal</name>f hopeful and <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> afraid of some new danger, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> now both stood still.
                Suddenly out of a long st<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng of nonsense-words (or so they seemed) the voice rose
                up loud and clear and burst into this song:</p>
            <p>Hey! Come merry dot! <name type="PERSON">derry <name type="PERSON">dol</name></name>! My darling!</p>
            <p>Light goes the weather-wind and the feathered starling.</p>
            <p>Down along under <name type="ORG">Hill</name>, shining in the sunlight,</p>
            <p>Waiting on the doorstep for the cold starlight,</p>
            <p>There my pretty lady is. <name type="LOC">River</name>-woman's daughter,</p>
            <p>Slender as the willow-<name type="PERSON">wan</name>d, clearer than the water.</p>
            <p>Old <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> <name type="GPE">Bombadil</name> water-lilies b<name type="GPE">ri</name>nging</p>
            <p>Comes hopping home again. Can you hear him singing?</p>
            <p>Hey! Come merry <name type="PERSON">dol</name>! deny <name type="PERSON">dol</name>! and merry-o,</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Goldberry</name>, <name type="PERSON">Goldberry</name>, merry yellow berry-o!</p>
            <p>Poor old <name type="PERSON">Willow</name>-man, you tuck your roots away!</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Tom</name>'s in a hurry now. Evening will follow <name type="DATE">day</name>.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Tom</name>'s going home again water-lilies b<name type="GPE">ri</name>nging.</p>
            <p>Hey! Come <name type="PERSON">derry <name type="PERSON">dol</name></name>! Can you hear me singing?</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> stood as if enchanted. The wind puf<name type="ORG">fed</name> out. The leaves hung silently
                again on stiff branches. There was another burst of song, and then suddenly, hopping
                and dancing along the path, there appeared above the reeds an old battered hat with
                a tall crown and a long blue feather stuck in the band. With another hop and a bound
                there came into view a man, or so it seemed. At any rate he was too large and heavy
                for a hobbit, if not quite tall enough for <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the <name type="ORG">Big People</name>, though he made
                noise enough for <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, slumping along with great yellow boots on his thick legs, and
                charging through grass and rushes like a cow going down to d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk. He had a blue coat
                and a long brown beard; his eyes were blue and b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght, and his face was red as a
                <name type="GPE">ri</name>pe apple, but creased into <name type="CARDINAL">a <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name></name> w<name type="GPE">ri</name>nkles of laughter. In his hands he car<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed
                on a large leaf as on a tray a small pile of white water-lilies.</p>
            <p><q>'Help!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> running towards him with their hands stretched
                out.</p>
            <p><q>'Whoa! Whoa! steady there!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed the old man, holding up <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> hand, and they
                stopped short, as if they had been struck stiff. <q>'Now, my little fellows, where
                    be you a-going to, puffing like a bellows? What's the matter here then? Do you
                    know who I am? I'm <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> <name type="GPE">Bombadil</name>. Tell me what's your trouble! <name type="PERSON">Tom</name>'s in a hurry
                    now. <name type="PERSON">Don</name>'t you crush my lilies!'</q></p>
            <p><q>'My f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends are caught in the willow-tree,'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> breathlessly.</p>
            <p><q>'Master <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>'s being squeezed in a crack!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>.</p>
            <p><q>'What?'</q> shouted <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> <name type="GPE">Bombadil</name>, leaping up in the air. <q>'<name type="WORK_OF_ART">Old Man <name type="PERSON">Willow</name></name>?
                    Naught worse than that, eh? That can soon be mended. I know the tune for him.
                    Old grey <name type="PERSON">Willow</name>-man! I'll freeze his <name type="PERSON">mar</name>row cold, if he <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t behave himself.
                    I'll sing his roots off. I'll sing a wind up and blow leaf and branch away. Old
                    Man <name type="PERSON">Willow</name>!'</q> Setting down his lilies carefully on the grass, he ran to the
                tree. There he saw <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>'s feet still sticking out � the rest had already been drawn
                further inside. <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> put his mouth to the crack and began singing into it in a low
                voice. They could not catch the words, but evidently <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> was aroused. His legs
                began to kick. <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> sprang away, and breaking off a hanging branch smote the side of
                the willow with it. <q>'You let them out again, <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Old Man <name type="PERSON">Willow</name></name>!'</q> he said.
                    <q>'What be you a-thinking of? You should not be waking. Eat <name type="LOC">earth</name>! Dig deep!
                    D<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk water! Go to sleep! <name type="GPE">Bombadil</name> is talking!'</q> He then seized <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>'s feet
                and drew him out of the suddenly widening crack.</p>
            <p>There was a tea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng creak and the other crack split open, and out of it <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>
                sprang, as if he had been kicked. Then with a loud snap both cracks closed fast
                again. A shudder ran through the tree from root to tip, and complete silence
                fell.</p>
            <p><q>'Thank you!'</q> said the hobbits, <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> after the other.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Tom</name> <name type="GPE">Bombadil</name> burst out laughing. <q>'Well, my little fellows!'</q> said he, stooping
                so that he peered into their faces. <q>'You shall come home with me! The table is
                    all laden with yellow cream, h<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>ycomb, and white bread and butter. <name type="PERSON">Goldberry</name> is
                    waiting. <name type="PERSON">Tim</name>e enough for questions around the supper table. You follow after me
                    as quick as you are able!'</q> With that he picked up his lilies, and then with
                a beckoning wave of his hand went hopping and dancing along the path eastward, still
                singing loudly and nonsensically.</p>
            <p>Too surp<name type="GPE">ri</name>sed and too relieved to talk, the hobbits followed after him as fast as
                they could. But that was not fast enough. <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> soon disappeared in front of them, and
                the noise of his singing got fainter and further away. Suddenly his voice came
                floating back to them in a loud halloo!</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Ho</name>p along, my little f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends, up the <name type="ORG">Withywindle</name>!</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Tom</name>'s going on ahead candles for to kindle.</p>
            <p>Down west sinks the <name type="ORG">Sun</name>: soon you will be groping.</p>
            <p>When the <name type="TIME">night</name>-shadows fall, then the door will open,</p>
            <p>Out of the window-panes light will twinkle yellow.</p>
            <p>Fear no alder black! <name type="PERSON">Heed</name> no hoary willow!</p>
            <p>Fear neither root nor bough! <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> goes on before you.</p>
            <p>Hey now! merry dot! We'll be waiting for you!</p>
            <p>After that the hobbits heard no more. Almost at once the sun seemed to sink into the
                trees behind them. They thought of the slanting light of <name type="TIME">evening</name> glitte<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng on the
                <name type="ORG">Brand</name>ywine <name type="LOC">River</name>, and the windows of <name type="ORG">Bucklebury</name> beginning to gleam with <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name>s of
                lights. Great shadows fell across them; trunks and branches of trees hung dark and
                threa<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing over the path. White mists began to <name type="GPE">ri</name>se and curl on the surface of the
                <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver and stray about the roots of the trees upon its borders. Out of the very
                ground at their feet a shadowy steam arose and mingled with the swiftly falling
                <name type="TIME">dusk</name>.</p>
            <p>It became difficult to follow the path, and they were very tired. Their legs seemed
                leaden. Strange furtive noises ran among the <name type="PERSON">bush</name>es and reeds on either side of
                them; and if they looked <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name> the pale sky, they caught sight of queer gnarled and
                knobbly faces that gloomed dark against the <name type="TIME">twilight</name>, and leered down at them from
                the high bank and the edges of the wood. They began to feel that all this country
                was unreal, and that they were stumbling through an ominous dream that led to no
                awakening.</p>
            <p>Just as they felt their feet slowing down to a standstill, they noticed that the
                ground was gently <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing. The water began to murmur. In the darkness they caught the
                white glimmer of foam, where the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver flowed over a short fall. Then suddenly the
                trees came to an end and the mists were left behind. They stepped out from the
                <name type="ORG">Forest</name>, and found a wide sweep of grass welling up before them. The <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver, now small
                and swift, was leaping mer<name type="GPE">ri</name>ly down to meet them, glinting here and there in the
                light of the stars, which were already shining in the sky.</p>
            <p>The grass under their feet was smooth and short, as if it had been mown or shaven.
                The eaves of the <name type="ORG">Forest</name> behind were clipped, and t<name type="GPE">ri</name>m as a hedge. The path was now
                plain before them, well-<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ded and bordered with st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. It wound up on to the top of
                a grassy knoll, now grey under the pale starry <name type="TIME">night</name>; and there, still high above
                them on a further slope, they saw the twinkling lights of a house. Down again the
                path went, and then up again, up a long smooth hillside of turf, towards the light.
                Suddenly a wide yellow beam flowed out b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ghtly from a door that was opened. There
                was <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> <name type="GPE">Bombadil</name>'s house before them, up, down, under hill. Behind it a steep
                shoulder of the land lay grey and bare, and beyond that the dark shapes of the
                <name type="ORG">Barrow</name>-downs stalked away into the eastern <name type="TIME">night</name>.</p>
            <p>They all hur<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed forward, hobbits and ponies. Already <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> their wea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ness and all
                their fears had fallen from them. _Hey! Come merry <name type="PERSON">dol</name>!_ rolled out the song to
                greet them.</p>
            <p>Hey! Come <name type="PERSON">derry <name type="PERSON">dol</name></name>! <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>p along, my hearties!</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbits! Ponies all! We are fond of parties.</p>
            <p>Now let the fun begin! Let us sing together!</p>
            <p>Then another clear voice, as young and as ancient as <name type="DATE">Sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng</name>, like the song of a glad
                water flowing down into the <name type="TIME">night</name> from <name type="TIME">a b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght <name type="TIME">morning</name></name> in the hills, came falling
                like silver to meet them:</p>
            <p>Now let the song begin! Let us sing together</p>
            <p>Of sun, stars, moon and mist, rain and cloudy weather,</p>
            <p>Light on the budding leaf, dew on the feather,</p>
            <p>Wind on the open hill, bells on the heather,</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Reeds</name> by the shady pool, lilies on the water:</p>
            <p>Old <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> <name type="GPE">Bombadil</name> and the <name type="LOC">River</name>-daughter!</p>
            <p>And with that song the hobbits stood upon the threshold, and a golden light was all
                about them.</p>

            <p>In the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>use of <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> <name type="GPE">Bombadil</name></p>
            <p>The <name type="CARDINAL">four</name> hobbits stepped over the wide st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> threshold, and stood still, blinking.
                They were in a long low room, filled with the light of lamps swinging from the beams
                of the roof; and on the table of dark polished wood stood many candles, tall and
                yellow, burning b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ghtly.</p>
            <p>In a c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>r, at the far side of the room facing the outer door, sat a woman. Her long
                yellow <name type="PERSON">hai</name>r <name type="GPE">ri</name>ppled down her shoulders; her gown was green, green as young reeds,
                shot with silver like beads of dew; and her belt was of gold, shaped like a c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>n of
                flag-lilies set with the pale-blue eyes of forget-me-nots. About her feel in wide
                vessels of green and brown <name type="LOC">earth</name>enware, white water-lilies were floating, so that
                she seemed to be enthr<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>d in the midst of a pool.</p>
            <p><q>'<name type="ORG">Ent</name>er, good guests!'</q> she said, and as she spoke they knew that it was her
                clear voice they had heard singing. They came a few timid steps further into the
                room, and began to bow low, feeling strangely surp<name type="GPE">ri</name>sed and awkward, like folk that,
                knocking at a cottage door to beg for a d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk of water, have been answered by a fair
                young elf-queen clad in living flowers. But before they could say anything, she
                sprang lightly up and over the lily-bowls, and ran laughing towards them; and as she
                ran her gown rustled softly like the wind in the flowe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng borders of a <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver.</p>
            <p><q>'Come dear folk!'</q> she said, taking <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> by the hand. <q>'Laugh and be merry!
                    I am <name type="PERSON">Goldberry</name>, daughter of the <name type="LOC">River</name>.'</q> Then lightly she passed them and
                closing the door she turned her back to it, with her white arms spread out across
                it. <q>'Let us shut out the <name type="TIME">night</name>!'</q> she said. <q>'For you are still afraid,
                    perhaps, of mist and tree-shadows and deep water, and untame things. Fear
                    nothing! For to<name type="TIME">night</name> you are under the roof of <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> <name type="GPE">Bombadil</name>.'</q></p>
            <p>The hobbits looked at her in wonder; and she looked at each of them and smiled.
                    <q>'<name type="ORG">Fair</name> lady <name type="PERSON">Goldberry</name>!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> at last, feeling his heart moved with a
                joy that he did not understand. He stood as he had at times stood enchanted by fair
                <name type="ORG">elven</name>-voices; but the spell that was now laid upon him was different: less keen and
                lofty was the delight, but deeper and nearer to mortal heart; <name type="PERSON">mar</name>vellous and yet not
                strange. <q>'<name type="ORG">Fair</name> lady <name type="PERSON">Goldberry</name>!'</q> he said again. 'Now the joy that was hidden
                in the songs we heard is made plain to me.</p>
            <p>O slender as a willow-<name type="PERSON">wan</name>d! O clearer than clear water!</p>
            <p>O reed by the living pool! <name type="ORG">Fair</name> <name type="LOC">River</name>-daughter!</p>
            <p>O sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng-time and <name type="DATE">summer</name>-time, and sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng again after!</p>
            <p>O wind on the waterfall, and the leaves' laughter!'</p>
            <p>Suddenly he stopped and stammered, overcome with surp<name type="GPE">ri</name>se to hear himself saying such
                things. But <name type="PERSON">Goldberry</name> laughed.</p>
            <p><q>'Welcome!'</q> she said. <q>'I had not heard that folk of the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> were so
                    sweet-tongued. But I see you are an elf-f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end; the light in your eyes and the
                    <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng in your voice tells it. This is a merry meeting! Sit now, and wait for the
                    Master of the house! He will not be long. He is <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ding your tired
                beasts.'</q></p>
            <p>The hobbits sat down gladly in low rush-seated c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>rs, while <name type="PERSON">Goldberry</name> busied herself
                about the table; and their eyes followed her, for the slender grace of her movement
                filled them with quiet delight. From somewhere behind the house came the sound of
                singing. Every now and again they caught, among many a _<name type="PERSON">derry <name type="PERSON">dol</name></name>_ and a _merry <name type="PERSON">dol</name>_
                and a _<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng a ding dillo_ the repeated words:</p>
            <p>Old <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> <name type="GPE">Bombadil</name> is a merry fellow;</p>
            <p>B<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght blue his jacket is, and his boots are yellow.</p>
            <p><q>'<name type="ORG">Fair</name> lady!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> again after a while. <q>'Tell me, if my asking does
                    not seem foolish, who is <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> <name type="GPE">Bombadil</name>?'</q></p>
            <p><q>'He is,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Goldberry</name>, staying her swift movements and smiling.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> looked at her questioningly. <q>'He is, as you have seen him,'</q> she said in
                answer to his look. <q>'He is the Master of wood, water, and hill.'</q></p>
            <p>
                <q>'Then all this strange land belongs to him?'</q>
            </p>
            <p><q>'No indeed!'</q> she answered, and her smile faded. <q>'That would indeed be a
                    burden,'</q> she added in a low voice, as if to herself. <q>'The trees and the
                    grasses and all things growing or living in the land belong each to themselves.
                    <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> <name type="GPE">Bombadil</name> is the Master. No <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> has ever caught old <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> walking in the
                    forest, wading in the water, leaping on the hill-tops under light and shadow. He
                    has no fear. <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> <name type="GPE">Bombadil</name> is master.'</q></p>
            <p>A door opened and in came <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> <name type="GPE">Bombadil</name>. He had now no hat and his thick brown <name type="PERSON">hai</name>r
                was crowned with <name type="DATE">autumn</name> leaves. He laughed, and going to <name type="PERSON">Goldberry</name>, took her
                hand.</p>
            <p><q>'Here's my pretty lady!'</q> he said, bowing to the hobbits. <q>'Here's my
                    <name type="PERSON">Goldberry</name> clothed all in silver-green with flowers in her girdle! Is the table
                    laden? I see yellow cream and h<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>ycomb, and white bread, and butter; milk,
                    cheese, and green herbs and <name type="GPE">ri</name>pe ber<name type="GPE">ri</name>es gathered. Is that enough for us? Is the
                    supper ready?'</q></p>
            <p><q>'It is,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Goldberry</name>; <q>'but the guests perhaps are not?'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Tom</name> clapped his hands and c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed: <q>'<name type="PERSON">Tom</name>, <name type="PERSON">Tom</name>! your guests are tired, and you had
                    near forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>! Come now, my merry f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends, and <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> will refresh you! You shall
                    clean g<name type="GPE">ri</name>my hands, and wash your weary faces; cast off your muddy cloaks and
                    comb out your tangles!'</q></p>
            <p>He opened the door, and they followed him down a short passage and round a sharp
                turn. They came to a low room with a sloping roof (a penthouse, it seemed, built on
                to the north end of the house). Its walls were of clean st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, but they were mostly
                covered with green hanging mats and yellow curtains. The floor was flagged, and
                strewn with fresh green rushes. There were <name type="CARDINAL">four</name> deep mattresses, each piled with
                white blankets, laid on the floor along <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> side. Against the opposite wall was a
                long bench laden with wide <name type="LOC">earth</name>enware basins, and beside it stood brown ewers
                filled with water, some cold, some steaming hot. There were soft green slippers set
                ready beside each bed.</p>
            <p>Before long, washed and refreshed, the hobbits were seated at the table, <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> on each
                side, while at either end sat <name type="PERSON">Goldberry</name> and the Master. It was a long and merry
                meal. Though the hobbits ate, as only famished hobbits can eat, there was no lack.
                The d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk in their d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nking-bowls seemed to be clear cold water, yet it went to
                their hearts like wine and set free their voices. The guests became suddenly aware
                that they were singing mer<name type="GPE">ri</name>ly, as if it was easier and more natural than
                talking.</p>
            <p>At last <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> and <name type="PERSON">Goldberry</name> rose and cleared the table swiftly. The guests were
                commanded to sit quiet, and were set in c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>rs, each with a footstool to his tired
                feet. There was a fire in the wide h<name type="LOC">earth</name> before them, and it was burning with a
                sweet smell, as if it were built of apple-wood. When everything was set in order,
                all the lights in the room were put out, except <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> lamp and a pair of candles at
                each end of the chimney-shelf. Then <name type="PERSON">Goldberry</name> came and stood before them, holding a
                candle; and she wished them each a good <name type="TIME">night</name> and deep sleep.</p>
            <p><q>'Have peace now,'</q> she said, <q>'until the <name type="TIME">morning</name>! <name type="PERSON">Heed</name> no <name type="TIME">night</name>ly noises! For
                    nothing passes door and window here save moonlight and starlight and the wind
                    off the hill-top. <name type="TIME">Good <name type="TIME">night</name></name>!'</q> She passed out of the room with a glimmer and
                a rustle. The sound of her footsteps was like a stream falling gently away downhill
                over cool st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s in the quiet of <name type="TIME">night</name>.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Tom</name> sat on a while beside them in silence, while each of them t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed to muster the
                courage to ask <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the many questions he had meant to ask at supper. Sleep
                gathered on their eyelids. At last <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> spoke:</p>
            <p>
                <q>'Did you hear me calling, Master, or was it just chance that brought you at that
                    moment?'</q>
            </p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Tom</name> stirred like a man shaken out of a pleasant dream. <q>'Eh, what?'</q> said he.
                    <q>'Did I hear you calling? <name type="PERSON">Nay</name>, I did not hear: I was busy singing. Just chance
                    brought me then, if chance you call it. It was no plan of mine, though I was
                    waiting for you. We heard news of you, and learned that you were <name type="PERSON">wan</name>de<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng. We
                    guessed you'd come ere long down to the water: all paths lead that way, down to
                    <name type="ORG">Withywindle</name>. Old grey <name type="PERSON">Willow</name>-man, he's a mighty singer; and it's hard for little
                    folk to escape his cunning mazes. But <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> had an errand there, that he dared not
                    hinder.'</q> <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> nodded as if sleep was taking him again; but he went on in a
                soft singing voice:</p>
            <p>I had an errand there: gathe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng water-lilies,</p>
            <p>green leaves and lilies white to please my pretty lady,</p>
            <p>the last ere <name type="DATE">the <name type="DATE">year</name></name>'s end to keep them from <name type="DATE">the <name type="DATE">winter</name></name>,</p>
            <p>to flower by her pretty feet tilt the snows are melted.</p>
            <p><name type="DATE">Each <name type="DATE">year</name></name> at <name type="DATE">summer</name>'s end I go to find them for her,</p>
            <p>in a wide pool, deep and clear, far down <name type="ORG">Withywindle</name>;</p>
            <p>there they open <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> in sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng and there they linger latest.</p>
            <p>By that pool <name type="DATE">long ago</name> I found the <name type="LOC">River</name>-daughter,</p>
            <p>fair young <name type="PERSON">Goldberry</name> sitting in the rushes.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Sweet</name> was her singing then, and her heart was beating!</p>
            <p>He opened his eyes and looked at them with a sudden glint of blue:</p>
            <p>And that proved well for you � for now I shall no longer</p>
            <p>go down deep again along the forest-water,</p>
            <p>not while <name type="DATE">the <name type="DATE">year</name></name> is old. Nor shall I be passing</p>
            <p><name type="WORK_OF_ART">Old Man <name type="PERSON">Willow</name></name>'s house this side of sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng-time,</p>
            <p>not till the merry sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng, when the <name type="LOC">River</name>-daughter</p>
            <p>dances down the withy-path to bathe in the water.</p>
            <p>He fell silent again; but <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> could not help asking <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> more question: the <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> he
                most desired to have answered. <q>'Tell us, Master,'</q> he said, <q>'about the
                    <name type="PERSON">Willow</name>-man. What is he? I have never heard of him before.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'No, <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> together, sitting suddenly up<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght. <q>'Not
                    now! Not until the <name type="TIME">morning</name>!'</q></p>
            <p><q>'That is <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght!'</q> said the old man. <q>'Now is the time for resting. Some
                    things are ill to hear when the world's in shadow. Sleep till the <name type="TIME">morning</name>-light,
                    rest on the pillow! <name type="PERSON">Heed</name> no <name type="TIME">night</name>ly noise! Fear no grey willow!'</q> And with
                that he took down the lamp and blew it out, and grasping a candle in either hand he
                led them out of the room.</p>
            <p>Their mattresses and pillows were soft as down, and the blankets were of white wool.
                They had hardly laid themselves on the deep beds and drawn the light covers over
                them before they were asleep.</p>
            <p>In the dead <name type="TIME">night</name>, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> lay in a dream without light. Then he saw the young moon
                <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing; under its thin light there loomed before him a black wall of rock, pierced
                by a dark arch like a great gate. It seemed to <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> that he was lifted up, and
                passing over he saw that the rock-wall was a circle of hills, and that within it was
                a plain, and in the midst of the plain stood a pinnacle of st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, like a vast tower
                but not made by hands. On its top stood the figure of a man. The moon as it rose
                seemed to hang for a moment above his head and glis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed in his white <name type="PERSON">hai</name>r as the
                wind stirred it. Up from the dark plain below came the crying of fell voices, and
                the howling of many wolves. Suddenly a shadow, like the shape of great wings, passed
                across the moon. The figure lifted his arms and a light flashed from the staff that
                he wielded. A mighty eagle swept down and bore him away. The voices wailed and the
                wolves yammered. There was a noise like a strong wind blowing, and on it was borne
                the sound of hoofs, galloping, galloping, galloping from the <name type="LOC">East</name>. <q>'<name type="ORG">Black</name>
                    <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s!'</q> thought <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> as he wakened, with the sound of the hoofs still
                echoing in his mind. He wondered if he would ever again have the courage to leave
                the safety of these st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> walls. He lay motionless, still lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing; but all was now
                silent, and at last he turned and fell asleep again or <name type="PERSON">wan</name>dered into some other
                unremembered dream.</p>
            <p>At his side <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> lay dreaming pleasantly; but a change came over his dreams and he
                turned and groaned. Suddenly he woke, or thought he had waked, and yet still heard
                in the darkness the sound that had disturbed his dream: _tip-tap, squeak_: the noise
                was like branches fretting in the wind, twig-fingers scraping wall and window:
                _creak, creak, creak._ He wondered if there were willow-trees close to the house;
                and then suddenly he had a dreadful feeling that he was not in an ordinary house at
                all, but inside the willow and lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing to that hor<name type="GPE">ri</name>ble dry creaking voice
                laughing at him again. He sat up, and felt the soft pillows yield to his hands, and
                he lay down again relieved. He seemed to hear the echo of words in his ears:
                    <q>'Fear nothing! Have peace until the <name type="TIME">morning</name>! <name type="PERSON">Heed</name> no <name type="TIME">night</name>ly noises!'</q>
                Then he went to sleep again.</p>
            <p>It was the sound of water that <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> heard falling into his quiet sleep: water
                streaming down gently, and then spreading, spreading irresistibly all round the
                house into a dark shoreless pool. It gurgled under the walls, and was <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing slowly
                but surely. <q>'I shall be drowned!'</q> he thought. It will find its way in, and
                then I shall drown.<q>' He felt that he was lying in a soft slimy bog, and sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>nging
                    up he set his fool on the corner of a cold hard flagst<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. Then he remembered
                    where he was and lay down again. He seemed to hear or remember hea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng: 'Nothing
                    passes doors or windows save moonlight and starlight and the wind off the
                    hill-top.'</q> A little breath of sweet air moved the curtain. He breathed deep
                and fell asleep again.</p>
            <p>As far as he could remember, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> slept through the <name type="TIME">night</name> in deep con<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>t, if logs are
                con<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ted.</p>
            <p>They woke up, all <name type="CARDINAL">four</name> at once, in the <name type="TIME">morning</name> light. <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> was moving about the room
                whistling like a starling. When he heard them stir he clapped his hands, and c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed:
                    <q>'Hey! Come merry <name type="PERSON">dol</name>! <name type="PERSON">derry <name type="PERSON">dol</name></name>! My hearties!'</q> He drew back the yellow
                curtains, and the hobbits saw that these had covered the windows, at either end of
                the room, <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> looking east and the other looking west.</p>
            <p>They leapt up refreshed. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> ran to the eastern window, and found himself looking
                into a kitchen-garden grey with dew. He had <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> expected to see turf <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name>
                the walls, turf all pocked with hoof-p<name type="GPE">ri</name>nts. Actually his view was screened by a
                tall line of beans on poles; but above and far beyond them the grey top of the hill
                loomed up against the sun<name type="GPE">ri</name>se. It was <name type="TIME">a pale <name type="TIME">morning</name></name>: in the <name type="LOC">East</name>, behind long
                clouds like lines of soiled wool stained red at the edges, lay glimme<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng deeps of
                yellow. The sky spoke of rain to come; but the light was broadening quickly, and the
                red flowers on the beans began to glow against the wet green leaves.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> looked out of the western window, down into a pool of mist. The <name type="ORG">Forest</name> was
                hidden under a fog. It was like looking down on to a sloping cloud-roof from above.
                There was a fold or channel where the mist was broken into many plumes and billows;
                the valley of the <name type="ORG">Withywindle</name>. The stream ran down the hill on the left and vanished
                into the white shadows. Near at hand was a flower-garden and a clipped hedge
                silver-netted, and beyond that grey shaven grass pale with dew-drops. There was no
                willow-tree to be seen.</p>
            <p><q>'Good <name type="TIME">morning</name>, merry f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Tom</name>, opening the eastern window wide. A
                cool air flowed in; it had a rainy smell. <q>'<name type="ORG">Sun</name> won't show her face much to<name type="DATE">day</name>.
                    I'm thinking. I have been walking wide, leaping on the hilltops, since the grey
                    <name type="TIME">dawn</name> began, nosing wind and weather, wet grass underfoot, wet sky above me. I
                    wakened <name type="PERSON">Goldberry</name> singing under window; but nought wakes hobbit-folk in the
                    <name type="TIME">early <name type="TIME">morning</name></name>. In the <name type="TIME">night</name> little folk wake up in the darkness, and sleep after
                    light has come! <name type="ORG">Ring</name> a ding dillo! Wake now, my merry f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends! Forget the
                    <name type="TIME">night</name>ly noises! <name type="ORG">Ring</name> a ding dillo del! <name type="PERSON">derry del</name>, my hearties! If you come soon
                    you'll find breakfast on the table. If you come late you'll get grass and
                    rain-water!'</q></p>
            <p>Needless to say � not that <name type="PERSON">Tom</name>'s threat sounded very se<name type="GPE">ri</name>ous � the hobbits came soon,
                and left the table late and only when it was beginning lo look rather empty. Neither
                <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> nor <name type="PERSON">Goldberry</name> were there. <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> could be heard about the house, clatte<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng in the
                kitchen, and up and down the stairs, and singing here and there outside. The room
                looked westward over the mist-clouded valley, and the window was open. Water d<name type="GPE">ri</name>pped
                down from the thatched eaves above. Before they had finished breakfast the clouds
                had joined into an unbroken roof, and a straight grey rain came softly and steadily
                down. Behind its deep curtain the <name type="ORG">Forest</name> was completely veiled.</p>
            <p>As they looked out of the window there came falling gently as if it was flowing down
                the rain out of the sky, the clear voice of <name type="PERSON">Goldberry</name> singing up above them. They
                could hear few words, but it seemed plain to them that the song was a rain-song, as
                sweet as showers on dry hills, that told the tale of a <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver from the sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng in the
                highlands to the <name type="LOC">Sea</name> far below. The hobbits lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed with delight; and <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> was
                glad in his heart, and blessed the kindly weather, because it delayed them from
                departing. The thought of going had been heavy upon him from the moment he awoke;
                but he guessed now that they would not go further that <name type="DATE">day</name>.</p>
            <p>The upper wind settled in the <name type="LOC">West</name> and deeper and wetter clouds rolled <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name> spill
                their laden rain on the bare heads of the <name type="LOC">Downs</name>. Nothing could be seen all round the
                house but falling water. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> stood near the open door and watched the white chalky
                path turn into a little <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver of milk and go bubbling away down into the valley. <name type="PERSON">Tom</name>
                <name type="GPE">Bombadil</name> came trotting round the corner of the house, waving his arms as if he was
                warding off the rain � and indeed when he sprang over the threshold he seemed quite
                dry, except for his boots. These he took off and put in the chimney-corner. Then he
                sat in the largest c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>r and called the hobbits to gather round him.</p>
            <p><q>'This is <name type="PERSON">Goldberry</name>'s washing <name type="DATE">day</name>,'</q> he said, <q>'and her <name type="DATE">autumn</name>-cleaning. Too
                    wet for hobbit-folk � let them rest while they are able! It's a good <name type="DATE">day</name> for
                    long tales, for questions and for answers, so <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> will start the
                talking.'</q></p>
            <p>He then told them many re<name type="PERSON">mar</name>kable sto<name type="GPE">ri</name>es, sometimes <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> as if speaking to himself,
                sometimes looking at them suddenly with a b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght blue eye under his deep brows.
                Of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> his voice would turn to song, and he would get out of his c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>r and dance
                about. He told them tales of bees and flowers, the ways of trees, and the strange
                creatures of the <name type="ORG">Forest</name>, about the evil things and good things, things f<name type="GPE">ri</name>endly and
                things unf<name type="GPE">ri</name>endly, cruel things and kind things, and <name type="ORG">sec</name>rets hidden under
                brambles.</p>
            <p>As they lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed, they began to understand the lives of the <name type="ORG">Forest</name>, apart from
                themselves, indeed to feel themselves as the strangers where all other things were
                at home. Moving constantly in and out of his talk was <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Old Man <name type="PERSON">Willow</name></name>, and <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>
                learned now enough to con<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>t him, indeed more than enough, for it was not
                comfortable lore. <name type="PERSON">Tom</name>'s words laid bare the hearts of trees and their thoughts,
                which were of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> dark and strange, and filled with a hatred of things that go free
                upon the <name type="LOC">earth</name>, gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning: destroyers and
                usurpers. It was not called the Old <name type="ORG">Forest</name> without reason, for it was indeed
                ancient, a survivor of vast forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> woods; and in it there lived yet, ageing no
                quicker than the hills, the fathers of the fathers of trees, remembe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng times when
                they were lords. <name type="DATE">The <name type="DATE">countless <name type="DATE">year</name>s</name></name> had filled them with p<name type="GPE">ri</name>de and rooted wisdom,
                and with malice. But n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> were more dangerous than the Great <name type="PERSON">Willow</name>: his heart was
                rot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>, but his strength was green; and he was cunning, and a master of winds, and
                his song and thought ran through the woods on both sides of the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver. His grey
                thirsty spi<name type="GPE">ri</name>t drew power out of the <name type="LOC">earth</name> and spread like fine root-threads in the
                ground, and invisible twig-fingers in the air, till it had under its dominion nearly
                all the trees of the <name type="ORG">Forest</name> from the <name type="ORG">Hedge</name> to the <name type="LOC">Downs</name>.</p>
            <p>Suddenly <name type="PERSON">Tom</name>'s talk left the woods and went leaping up the young stream, over
                bubbling waterfalls, over pebbles and worn rocks, and among small flowers in close
                grass and wet crannies, <name type="PERSON">wan</name>de<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng at last up on to the <name type="LOC">Downs</name>. They heard of the
                Great <name type="ORG">Barrow</name>s, and the green mounds, and the st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>-<name type="GPE">ri</name>ngs upon the hills and in the
                hollows among the hills. Sheep were bleating in flocks. Green walls and white walls
                rose. There were fortresses on the h<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name>s. <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>gs of little kingdoms fought
                together, and the young <name type="ORG">Sun</name> sh<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> like fire on the red metal of their new and greedy
                swords. There was victory and defeat; and towers fell, fortresses were burned, and
                flames went up into the sky. Gold was piled on the biers of dead kings and queens;
                and mounds covered them, and the st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> doors were shut; and the grass grew over all.
                Sheep walked for a while biting the grass, but soon the hills were empty again. A
                shadow came out of dark places far away, and the b<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s were stirred in the mounds.
                <name type="ORG">Barrow</name>-wights walked in the hollow places with a clink of <name type="GPE">ri</name>ngs on cold fingers, and
                gold c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>ns in the wind.' <name type="ORG">St<name type="CARDINAL">one</name></name> <name type="GPE">ri</name>ngs g<name type="GPE">ri</name>nned out of the ground like broken teeth in
                the moonlight.</p>
            <p>The hobbits shuddered. Even in the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> the rumour of the <name type="ORG">Barrow</name>-wights of the
                <name type="ORG">Barrow</name>-downs beyond the <name type="ORG">Forest</name> had been heard. But it was not a tale that any hobbit
                liked to lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> to, even by a comfortable fireside far away. These <name type="CARDINAL">four</name> now suddenly
                remembered what the joy of this house had d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ven from their minds: the house of <name type="PERSON">Tom</name>
                <name type="GPE">Bombadil</name> nestled under the very shoulder of those dreaded hills. They lost the
                thread of his tale and shifted uneasily, looking aside at <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> another.</p>
            <p>When they caught his words again they found that he had now <name type="PERSON">wan</name>dered into strange
                regions beyond their memory and beyond their waking thought, into limes when the
                world was wider, and the seas flowed straight to the western <name type="LOC">Shore</name>; and still on and
                back <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> went singing out into ancient starlight, when only the <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name>-sires were
                awake. Then suddenly he slopped, and they saw that he nodded as if he was falling
                asleep. The hobbits sat still before him, enchanted; and it seemed as if, under the
                spell of his words, the wind had g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, and the clouds had d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed up, and the <name type="DATE">day</name> had
                been withdrawn, and darkness had come from <name type="LOC">East</name> and <name type="LOC">West</name>, and all the sky was filled
                with the light of white stars.</p>
            <p>Whether the <name type="TIME">morning</name> and <name type="TIME">evening</name> of <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> <name type="DATE">day</name> or of m<name type="DATE">any <name type="DATE">day</name></name>s had passed <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> could not
                tell. He did not feel either hungry or tired, only filled with wonder. The stars
                sh<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> through the window and the silence of the heavens seemed to be round him. He
                spoke at last out of his wonder and a sudden fear of that silence:</p>
            <p><q>'Who are you, Master?'</q> he asked.</p>
            <p><q>'Eh, what?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> sitting up, and his eyes glinting in the gloom. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Don</name>'t
                    you know my name yet? That's the only answer. Tell me, who are you, al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>,
                    yourself and nameless? But you are young and I am old. Eldest, that's what I am.
                    <name type="PERSON">Mark</name> my words, my f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends: <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> was here before the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver and the trees; <name type="PERSON">Tom</name>
                    remembers the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> raindrop and the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> acorn. He made paths before the Big
                    People, and saw the little People ar<name type="GPE">ri</name>ving. He was here before the <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>gs and the
                    graves and the <name type="ORG">Barrow</name>-wights. When the <name type="ORG">Elves</name> passed westward, <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> was here
                    already, before the seas were bent. He knew the dark under the stars when it was
                    fearless � before the Dark <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd came from Outside.'</q></p>
            <p>A shadow seemed to pass by the window, and the hobbits glanced hastily through the
                panes. When they turned again, <name type="PERSON">Goldberry</name> stood in the door behind, framed in light.
                She held a candle, shielding its flame from the draught with her hand; and the light
                flowed through it, like sunlight through a white shell.</p>
            <p><q>'The rain has ended,'</q> she said; <q>'and new waters are running downhill, under
                    the stars. Let us now laugh and be glad!'</q></p>
            <p><q>'And let us have food and d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Tom</name>. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ng tales are thirsty. And
                    long lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing's hungry work, <name type="TIME">morning</name>, <name type="TIME">noon</name>, and <name type="TIME">evening</name>!'</q> With that he
                jumped out of his c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>r, and with a bound took a candle from the chimney-shelf and
                lit it in the flame that <name type="PERSON">Goldberry</name> held; then he danced about the table. Suddenly he
                hopped through the door and disappeared.</p>
            <p>Quickly he returned, bea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng a large and laden tray. Then <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> and <name type="PERSON">Goldberry</name> set the
                table; and the hobbits sat <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> in wonder and <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> in laughter: so fair was the
                grace of <name type="PERSON">Goldberry</name> and so merry and odd the cape<name type="GPE">ri</name>ngs of <name type="PERSON">Tom</name>. Yet in some fashion
                they seemed to weave a single dance, neither hinde<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng the other, in and out of the
                room, and round about the table; and with great speed food and vessels and lights
                were set in order. The boards blazed with candles, white and yellow. <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> bowed to
                his guests. <q>'Supper is ready,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Goldberry</name>; and now the hobbits saw that
                she was clothed all in silver with a white girdle, and her shoes were like fishes'
                mail. But <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> was all in clean blue, blue as rain-washed forget-me-nots, and he had
                green stockings.</p>
            <p>It was a supper even better than before. The hobbits under the spell of <name type="PERSON">Tom</name>'s words
                may have missed <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> meal or many, but when the food was before them it seemed at
                least <name type="DATE">a <name type="DATE">week</name></name> since they had ea<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>. They did not sing or even speak much for a while,
                and paid close at<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>tion to business. But after a time their hearts and spi<name type="GPE">ri</name>t rose
                high again, and their voices rang out in mirth and laughter.</p>
            <p>After they had ea<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>, <name type="PERSON">Goldberry</name> sang many songs for them, songs that began mer<name type="GPE">ri</name>ly in
                the hills and fell softly down into silence; and in the silences they saw in their
                minds pools and waters wider than any they had known, and looking into them they saw
                the sky below them and the stars like jewels in the depths. Then once more she
                wished them <name type="TIME">each good <name type="TIME">night</name></name> and left them by the fireside. But <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> now seemed wide
                awake and plied them with questions.</p>
            <p>He appeared already to know much about them and all their families, and indeed to
                know much of all the history and doings of the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> down from <name type="DATE">day</name>s hardly
                remembered among the hobbits themselves. It no longer surp<name type="GPE">ri</name>sed them; but he made no
                <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret that he owed his recent knowledge largely to <name type="LOC">Far</name>mer <name type="PERSON">Maggot</name>, whom he seemed to
                regard as a person of more imp<name type="GPE">ortan</name>ce than they had imagined. <q>'There's <name type="LOC">earth</name>
                    under his old feet, and clay on his fingers; wisdom in his b<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s, and both his
                    eyes are open,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Tom</name>. It was also clear that <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> had dealings with the
                <name type="ORG">Elves</name>, and it seemed that in some fashion, news had reached him from <name type="PERSON">Gildor</name>
                concerning the flight of <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.</p>
            <p>Indeed so much did <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> know, and so cunning was his questioning, that <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> found
                himself telling him more about <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> and his own hopes and fears than he had told
                before even to <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> wagged his head up and down, and there was a glint in
                his eyes when he heard of the <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s.</p>
            <p><q>'Show me the precious <name type="ORG">Ring</name>!'</q> he said suddenly in the midst of the story: and
                <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, to his own astonishment, drew out the c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>n from his pocket, and unfas<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing
                the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> handed it at once to <name type="PERSON">Tom</name>.</p>
            <p>It seemed to grow larger as it lay for a moment on his big brown-skinned hand. Then
                suddenly he put it to his eye and laughed. For a <name type="ORG">sec</name>ond the hobbits had a vision,
                both comical and alarming, of his b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght blue eye gleaming through a circle of gold.
                Then <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> put the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> round the end of his little finger and held it <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name> the
                candlelight. For a moment the hobbits noticed nothing strange about this. Then they
                gasped. There was no sign of <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> disappea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng!</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Tom</name> laughed again, and then he spun the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> in the air � and it vanished with a
                flash. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> gave a cry � and <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> leaned forward and handed it back to him with a
                smile.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> looked at it closely, and rather suspiciously (like <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> who has lent a t<name type="GPE">ri</name>nket
                to a juggler). It was the same <name type="ORG">Ring</name>, or looked the same and weighed the same: for
                that <name type="ORG">Ring</name> had always seemed to <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> to weigh strangely heavy in the hand. But
                something prompted him to make sure. He was perhaps a t<name type="GPE">ri</name>fle annoyed with <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> for
                seeming to make so light of what even <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> thought so pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>lously imp<name type="GPE">ortan</name>t. He
                waited for an opportunity, when the talk was going again, and <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> was telling an
                absurd story about badgers and their queer ways � then he slipped the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> on.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Merry</name> turned towards him to say something and gave a start, and checked an
                exclamation. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> was delighted (in a way): it was his own <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng all <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght, for
                <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> was sta<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng blankly at his c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>r, and obviously could not see him. He got up
                and crept quietly away from the fireside towards the outer door.</p>
            <p><q>'Hey there!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Tom</name>, glancing towards him with a most seeing look in his
                shining eyes. <q>'Hey! <name type="PERSON">Come <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name></name>, there! Where be you a-going? Old <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> <name type="GPE">Bombadil</name>'s
                    not as blind as that yet. Take off your golden <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng! Your hand's more fair
                    without it. Come back! Leave your game and sit down beside me! We must talk a
                    while more, and think about the <name type="TIME">morning</name>. <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> must teach the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght road, and keep
                    your feet from <name type="PERSON">wan</name>de<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> laughed (trying to feel pleased), and taking off the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> he came and sat down
                again. <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> now told them that he reck<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>d the <name type="ORG">Sun</name> would shine to<name type="DATE">morrow</name>, and it would
                be a glad <name type="TIME">morning</name>, and setting out would be hopeful. But they would do well to start
                early; for weather in that country was a thing that even <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> could not be sure of
                for long, and it would change sometimes quicker than he could change his jacket.
                    <q>'I am no weather-master,'</q> he said; <q>'nor is aught that goes on <name type="CARDINAL">two</name>
                    legs.'</q></p>
            <p>By his advice they decided to make nearly due <name type="LOC">North</name> from his house, over the western
                and lower slopes of the <name type="LOC">Downs</name>: they might hope in that way to st<name type="GPE">ri</name>ke the <name type="LOC">East</name> <name type="FAC">Road</name>
                in <name type="DATE">a <name type="DATE">day</name></name>'s journey, and avoid the <name type="ORG">Barrow</name>s. He told them not to be afraid � but to
                mind their own business.</p>
            <p><q>'Keep to the green grass. <name type="PERSON">Don</name>'t you go a-meddling with old st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> or cold <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Wight</name>s or
                    prying in their houses, unless you be strong folk with hearts that never
                    falter!'</q> He said this more than once; and he advised them to pass barrows by
                on the west-side, if they chanced to stray near <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. Then he taught them a rhyme to
                sing, if they should by ill-luck fall into any danger or difficulty the next
                <name type="DATE">day</name>.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Ho</name>! <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> <name type="GPE">Bombadil</name>, <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> <name type="GPE">Bombadil</name>lo!</p>
            <p>By water, wood and hill, by the reed and willow,</p>
            <p>By fire, sun and moon, harken now and hear us!</p>
            <p>Come, <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> <name type="GPE">Bombadil</name>, for our need is near us!</p>
            <p>When they had sung this altogether after him, he clapped them each on the shoulder
                with a laugh, and taking candles led them back to their bedroom.</p>

            <p>Fog on the <name type="ORG">Barrow</name>-<name type="LOC">Downs</name></p>
            <p><name type="TIME">That <name type="TIME">night</name></name> they heard no noises. But either in his dreams or out of them, he could
                not tell which, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> heard a sweet singing running in his mind; a song that seemed
                to come like a pale light behind a grey rain-curtain, and growing stronger to turn
                the veil all to glass and silver, until at last it was rolled back, and a far green
                country opened before him under a swift sun<name type="GPE">ri</name>se.</p>
            <p>The vision melted into waking; and there was <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> whistling like a tree-full of birds;
                and the sun was already slanting down the hill and through the open window. Outside
                everything was green and pale gold.</p>
            <p>After breakfast, which they again ate al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, they made ready to say farewell, as
                nearly heavy of heart as was possible on such <name type="TIME">a <name type="TIME">morning</name></name>: cool, b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght, and clean
                under a washed <name type="DATE">autumn</name> sky of thin blue. The air came fresh from the <name type="LOC">North</name>-west.
                Their quiet ponies were almost f<name type="GPE">ri</name>sky, sniffing and moving restlessly. <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> came out
                of the house and waved his hat and danced upon the doorstep, bidding the hobbits to
                get up and be off and go with good speed.</p>
            <p>They rode off along a path that wound away from behind the house, and went slanting
                <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name>wards the north end of the hill-brow under which it sheltered. They had just
                dismounted to lead their ponies up the last steep slope, when suddenly <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>
                stopped.</p>
            <p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Goldberry</name>!'</q> he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed. <q>'My fair lady, clad all in silver green! We have
                    never said farewell to her, nor seen her since the <name type="TIME">evening</name>!'</q> He was so
                distressed that he turned back; but at that moment a clear call came <name type="GPE">ri</name>ppling down.
                There on the hill-brow she stood beckoning to them: her <name type="PERSON">hai</name>r was flying loose, and
                as it caught the sun it sh<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> and shimmered. A light like the glint of water on dewy
                grass flashed from under her feet as she danced.</p>
            <p>They has<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed up the last slope, and stood breathless beside her. They bowed, but
                with a wave of her arm she bade them look round; and they looked out from the
                hill-top over lands under the <name type="TIME">morning</name>. It was now as clear and far-seen as it had
                been veiled and misty when they stood upon the knoll in the <name type="ORG">Forest</name>, which could now
                be seen <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing pale and green out of the dark trees in the <name type="LOC">West</name>. In that direction
                the land rose in wooded <name type="GPE">ri</name>dges, green, yellow, <name type="PERSON">russet</name> under the sun, beyond which
                lay hidden the valley of the <name type="ORG">Brand</name>ywine. To the <name type="LOC">South</name>, over the line of the
                <name type="ORG">Withywindle</name>, there was a distant glint like pale glass where the <name type="ORG">Brand</name>ywine <name type="LOC">River</name>
                made a great loop in the lowlands and flowed away out of the knowledge of the
                hobbits. <name type="LOC">North</name>ward beyond the dwindling downs the land ran away in flats and
                swellings of grey and green and pale <name type="LOC">earth</name>-colours, until it faded into a
                featureless and shadowy distance. <name type="LOC">East</name>ward the <name type="ORG">Barrow</name>-downs rose, <name type="GPE">ri</name>dge behind <name type="GPE">ri</name>dge
                into the <name type="TIME">morning</name>, and vanished out of eyesight into a guess: it was no more than a
                guess of blue and a remote white glimmer blending with the hem of the sky, but it
                spoke to them, out of memory and old tales, of the high and distant mountains.</p>
            <p>They took a deep draught of the air, and felt that a skip and a few stout st<name type="GPE">ri</name>des
                would bear them wherever they wished. It seemed fainthearted to go jogging aside
                over the crumpled skirts of the downs towards the <name type="FAC">Road</name>, when they should be leaping,
                as lusty as <name type="PERSON">Tom</name>, over the stepping st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s of the hills straight towards the
                <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Goldberry</name> spoke to them and recalled their eyes and thoughts. <q>'Speed now, fair
                    guests!'</q> she said. <q>'And hold to your purpose! <name type="LOC">North</name> with the wind in the
                    left eye and a blessing on your footsteps! Make haste while the <name type="ORG">Sun</name> shines!'</q>
                And to <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> she said: <q>'<name type="LOC">Far</name>ewell, <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name>-f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end, it was a merry meeting!'</q></p>
            <p>But <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> found no words to answer. He bowed low, and mounted his pony, and followed
                by his f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends jogged slowly down the gentle slope behind the hill. <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> <name type="GPE">Bombadil</name>'s
                house and the valley, and the <name type="ORG">Forest</name> were lost to view. The air grew warmer between
                the green walls of hillside and hillside, and the scent of turf rose strong and
                sweet as they breathed. Turning back, when they reached the bot<name type="PERSON">tom</name> of the green
                hollow, they saw <name type="PERSON">Goldberry</name>, now small and slender like a sunlit flower against the
                sky: she was standing still wat<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g them, and her hands were stretched out towards
                them. As they looked she gave a clear call, and lifting up her hand she turned and
                vanished behind the hill.</p>
            <p>Their way wound along the floor of the hollow, and round the green feet of a steep
                hill into another deeper and broader valley, and then over the shoulder of further
                hills, and down their long limbs, and up their smooth sides again, up on to new
                hill-tops and down into new valleys. There was no tree nor any visible water: it was
                a country of grass and short sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ngy turf, silent except for the whisper of the air
                over the edges of the land, and high l<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>ly c<name type="GPE">ri</name>es of strange birds. As they
                journeyed the sun mounted, and grew hot. Each time they climbed a <name type="GPE">ri</name>dge the breeze
                seemed to have grown less. When they caught a glimpse of the country westward the
                distant <name type="ORG">Forest</name> seemed to be smoking, as if <name type="DATE">the fall</name>en rain was steaming up again
                from leaf and root and mould. A shadow now lay round the edge of sight, a dark haze
                above which the upper sky was like a blue cap, hot and heavy.</p>
            <p><name type="DATE">About mid-<name type="DATE">day</name></name> they came to a hill whose top was wide and flat<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed, like a shallow
                saucer with a green mounded <name type="GPE">ri</name>m. Inside there was no air stir<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng, and the sky
                seemed near their heads. They rode across and looked northwards. Then their hearts
                rose, for it seemed plain that they had come further already than they had expected.
                Certainly the distances had now all become hazy and deceptive, but there could be no
                doubt that the <name type="LOC">Downs</name> were coming to an end. A long valley lay below them winding
                away northwards, until it came to an opening <name type="CARDINAL">between <name type="CARDINAL">two</name></name> steep shoulders. Beyond,
                there seemed to be no more hills. Due north they faintly glimpsed a long dark line.
                That is a line of trees,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>, 'and that must <name type="PERSON">mar</name>k the <name type="FAC">Road</name>. All along it
                    for many leagues east of the <name type="FAC">B<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge</name> there are trees growing. Some say they were
                    planted in the old <name type="DATE">day</name>s.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Splendid!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'If we make as good going this <name type="TIME">after<name type="TIME">noon</name></name> as we have
                    <name type="PERSON">don</name>e this <name type="TIME">morning</name>, we shall have left the <name type="LOC">Downs</name> before the <name type="ORG">Sun</name> sets and be
                    jogging on in search of a camping place.'</q> But even as he spoke he turned his
                glance eastwards, and he saw that on that side the hills were higher and looked down
                upon them; and all those hills were crowned with green mounds, and on some were
                standing st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s, pointing upwards like jagged teeth out of green gums.</p>
            <p>That view was somehow disquieting; so they turned from the sight and went down into
                the hollow circle. In the midst of it there stood a single st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, standing tall
                under the sun above, and at this <name type="TIME">hour</name> casting no shadow. It was shapeless and yet
                significant: like a land<name type="PERSON">mar</name>k, or a guarding finger, or more like a warning. But they
                were now hungry, and the sun was still at the fearless <name type="TIME">noon</name>; so they set their backs
                against the east side of the st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. It was cool, as if the sun had had no power to
                warm it; but at that time this seemed pleasant. There they took food and d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk, and
                made as good <name type="TIME">a <name type="TIME">noon</name></name>-meal under the open sky as any<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> could wish; for the food came
                from 'down under <name type="ORG">Hill</name>'. <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> had provided them with plenty for the comfort of the
                <name type="DATE">day</name>. Their ponies unburdened strayed upon the grass.</p>
            <p>Riding over the hills, and eating their fill, the warm sun and the scent of turf,
                lying a little too long, stret<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g out their legs and looking at the sky above
                their noses: these things are, perhaps, enough to explain what happened. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>wever,
                that may be: they woke suddenly and uncomfortably from a sleep they had never meant
                to take. The standing st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> was cold, and it cast a long pale shadow that stretched
                eastward over them. The sun, a pale and watery yellow, was gleaming through the mist
                just above the west wall of the hollow in which they lay; north, south, and east,
                beyond the wall the fog was thick, cold and white. The air was silent, heavy and
                chill. Their ponies were standing crowded together with their heads down.</p>
            <p>The hobbits sprang to their feet in alarm, and ran to the western <name type="GPE">ri</name>m. They found
                that they were upon an island in the fog. Even as they looked out in dismay towards
                the setting sun, it sank before their eyes into <name type="LOC">a white sea</name>, and a cold grey shadow
                sprang up in the <name type="LOC">East</name> behind. The fog rolled <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name> the walls and rose above them,
                and as it mounted it bent over their heads until it became a roof: they were shut in
                a hall of mist whose central pillar was the standing st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>.</p>
            <p>They felt as if a trap was closing about them; but they did not quite lose heart.
                They still remembered the hopeful view they had had of the line of the <name type="FAC">Road</name> ahead,
                and they still knew in which direction it lay. In any case, they now had so great a
                dislike for that hollow place about the st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> that no thought of remaining there was
                in their minds. They packed up as quickly as their chilled fingers would work.</p>
            <p>Soon they were leading their ponies in single file over the <name type="GPE">ri</name>m and down the long
                northward slope of the hill, down into a foggy sea. As they went down the mist
                became colder and damper, and their <name type="PERSON">hai</name>r hung lank and d<name type="GPE">ri</name>pping on their foreheads.
                When they reached the bot<name type="PERSON">tom</name> it was so cold that they halted and got out cloaks and
                hoods, which soon became <name type="ORG">bedewed</name> with grey drops. Then, mounting their ponies, they
                went slowly on again, feeling their way by the <name type="GPE">ri</name>se and fall of the ground. They
                were stee<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng, as well as they could guess, for the gate-like opening at the far
                northward end of the long valley which they had seen in the <name type="TIME">morning</name>. Once they were
                through the gap, they had only lo keep on in anything like a straight line and they
                were bound in the end to st<name type="GPE">ri</name>ke the <name type="FAC">Road</name>. Their thoughts did not go beyond that,
                except for a vague hope that perhaps away beyond the <name type="LOC">Downs</name> there might be no
                fog.</p>
            <p>Their going was very slow. To prevent their getting separated and <name type="PERSON">wan</name>de<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng in
                different directions they went in file, with <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> leading. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> was behind him, and
                after him came <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>, and then <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. The valley seemed to stretch on endlessly.
                Suddenly <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> saw a hopeful sign. On either side ahead a darkness began to loom
                through the mist; and he guessed that they were at last approa<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g the gap in the
                hills, the north-gate of the <name type="ORG">Barrow</name>-downs. If they could pass that, they would be
                free.</p>
            <p><q>'Come on! Follow me!'</q> he called back over his shoulder, and he hur<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed
                forward. But his hope soon changed to bewilderment and alarm. The dark patches grew
                darker, but they shrank; and suddenly he saw, towe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng ominous before him and
                leaning slightly towards <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> another like the pillars of a headless door, <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> huge
                standing st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s. He could not remember having seen any sign of these in the valley,
                when he looked out from the hill in the <name type="TIME">morning</name>. He had passed between them almost
                before he was aware: and even as he did so darkness seemed to fall round him. His
                pony reared and snorted, and he fell off. When he looked back he found that he was
                al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>: the others had not followed him. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Sam</name>!'</q> he called. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>! <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>!
                    Come along! Why <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t you keep up?'</q></p>
            <p>There was no answer. Fear took him, and he ran back past the st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s shouting wildly:
                    <q>'<name type="PERSON">Sam</name>! <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>! <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>! <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>!'</q> The pony bolted into the mist and vanished.
                From some way off, or so it seemed, he thought he heard a cry: <q>'<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>y! <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>!
                    <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>y!'</q> It was away eastward, on his left as he stood under the great st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s,
                sta<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng and straining into the gloom. He plunged off in the direction of the call,
                and found himself going steeply uphill.</p>
            <p>As he struggled on he called again, and kept on calling more and more frantically;
                but he heard no answer for some time, and then it seemed faint and far ahead and
                high above him. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>! <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>y!'</q> came the thin voices out of the mist: and then
                a cry that sounded like _help, help!_ of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> repeated, ending with a last _help!_
                that trailed off into a long wail suddenly cut short. He stumbled forward with all
                the speed he could towards the c<name type="GPE">ri</name>es; but the light was now g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, and clinging <name type="TIME">night</name>
                had closed about him, so that it was impossible to be sure of any direction. He
                seemed all the time to be climbing up and up.</p>
            <p>Only the change in the level of the ground at his feet told him when he at last came
                to the top of a <name type="GPE">ri</name>dge or hill. He was weary, sweating and yet chilled. It was wholly
                dark.</p>
            <p><q>'Where are you?'</q> he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed out miserably.</p>
            <p>There was no reply. He stood lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing. He was suddenly aware that it was getting
                very cold, and that up here a wind was beginning to blow, an icy wind. A change was
                coming in the weather. The mist was flowing past him now in shreds and tatters. His
                breath was smoking, and the darkness was less near and thick. He looked up and saw
                with surp<name type="GPE">ri</name>se that faint stars were appea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng overhead amid the strands of hurrying
                cloud and fog. The wind began to hiss over the grass.</p>
            <p>He imagined suddenly that he caught a muffled cry, and he made towards it; and even
                as he went forward the mist was rolled up and thrust aside, and the starry sky was
                unveiled. A glance showed him that he was now facing southwards and was on a round
                hill-top, which he must have climbed from the north. Out of the east the biting wind
                was blowing. To his <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght there loomed against the westward stars a dark black
                shape. A great barrow stood there.</p>
            <p><q>'Where are you?'</q> he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed again, both angry and afraid.</p>
            <p><q>'Here!'</q> said a voice, deep and cold, that seemed to come out of the ground.
                    <q>'I am waiting for you!'</q></p>
            <p><q>'No!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>; but he did not run away. His knees gave, and he fell on the
                ground. Nothing happened, and there was no sound. Trembling he looked up, in time to
                see a tall dark figure like a shadow against the stars. It leaned over him. He
                thought there were <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> eyes, very cold though lit with a pale light that seemed to
                come from some remote distance. Then a g<name type="GPE">ri</name>p stronger and colder than iron seized
                him. The icy touch froze his b<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s, and he remembered no more.</p>
            <p>When he came to himself again, for a moment he could recall nothing except a sense of
                dread. Then suddenly he knew that he was imp<name type="GPE">ri</name>s<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>d, caught hopelessly; he was in a
                barrow. A <name type="ORG">Barrow</name>-wight had taken him, and he was probably already under the dreadful
                spells of the <name type="ORG">Barrow</name>-wights about which whispered tales spoke. He dared not move,
                but lay as he found himself: flat on his back upon a cold st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> with his hands on
                his breast.</p>
            <p>But though his fear was so great that it seemed to be part of the very darkness that
                was round him, he found himself as he lay thinking about <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> <name type="PERSON">Baggins</name> and his
                sto<name type="GPE">ri</name>es, of their jogging along together in the lanes of the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> and talking about
                roads and adventures. There is a seed of courage hidden (of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> deeply, it is true)
                in the heart of the fattest and most timid hobbit, wailing for some final and
                desperate danger to make it grow. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> was neither very fat nor very timid; indeed,
                though he did not know it, <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> (and <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>) had thought him the best hobbit in
                the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>. He thought he had come to the end of his adventure, and a ter<name type="GPE">ri</name>ble end,
                but the thought hardened him. He found himself stif<name type="PERSON">fen</name>ing, as if for <name type="DATE">a final sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng</name>;
                he no longer felt limp like a helpless prey.</p>
            <p>As he lay there, thinking and getting a hold of himself, he noticed all at once that
                the darkness was slowly giving way: a pale greenish light was growing round him. It
                did not at <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> show him what kind of a place he was in, for the light seemed to be
                coming out of himself, and from the floor beside him, and had not yet reached the
                roof or wall. He turned, and there in the cold glow he saw lying beside him <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>,
                <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>, and <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. They were on their backs, and their faces looked deathly pale;
                and they were clad in white. About them lay many treasures, of gold maybe, though in
                that light they looked cold and unlovely. On their heads were <name type="NORP">circlets</name>, gold c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>ns
                were about their waists, and on their fingers were many <name type="GPE">ri</name>ngs. <name type="PRODUCT">Sword</name>s lay by their
                sides, and shields were at their feet. But across their <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> necks lay <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> long
                naked sword.</p>
            <p>Suddenly a song began: a cold murmur, <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing and falling. The voice seemed far away
                and immeasurably dreary, sometimes high in the air and thin, sometimes like a low
                moan from the ground. Out of the formless stream of sad but hor<name type="GPE">ri</name>ble sounds, st<name type="GPE">ri</name>ngs
                of words would now and again shape themselves: g<name type="GPE">ri</name>m, hard, cold words, heartless and
                miserable. <name type="TIME">The <name type="TIME">night</name></name> was railing against the <name type="TIME">morning</name> of which it was bereaved, and
                the cold was cursing the warmth for which it hungered. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> was chilled to the
                <name type="PERSON">mar</name>row. After a while the song became clearer, and with dread in his heart he
                perceived that it had changed into an incantation:</p>
            <p>Cold be hand and heart and b<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>,</p>
            <p>and cold be sleep under st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>:</p>
            <p>never <name type="PERSON">mar</name>e to wake on stony bed,</p>
            <p>never, till the <name type="ORG">Sun</name> fails and the <name type="PERSON">Moon</name> is dead.</p>
            <p>In the black wind the stars shall die,</p>
            <p>and still on gold here let them lie,</p>
            <p>till the dark lord lifts his hand</p>
            <p>over dead sea and withered land.</p>
            <p>He heard behind his head a creaking and scraping sound. Raising himself on <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> arm he
                looked, and saw now in the pale light that they were in a kind of passage which
                behind them turned a corner. Round the corner a long arm was groping, walking on its
                fingers towards <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, who was lying nearest, and towards the hilt of the sword that
                lay upon him.</p>
            <p>At <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> felt as if he had indeed been turned into st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> by the incantation.
                Then a wild thought of escape came to him. He wondered if he put on the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>,
                whether the <name type="ORG">Barrow</name>-wight would miss him, and he might find some way out. He thought
                of himself running free over the grass, g<name type="GPE">ri</name>eving for <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>, and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>, but
                free and alive himself. <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> would admit that there had been nothing else he
                could do.</p>
            <p>But the courage that had been awakened in him was now too strong: he could not leave
                his f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends so easily. He wavered, groping in his pocket, and then fought with
                himself again; and as he did so the arm crept nearer. Suddenly resolve hardened in
                him, and he seized a short sword that lay beside him, and kneeling he stooped low
                over the bodies of his companions. With what strength he had he hewed at the
                crawling arm near the w<name type="GPE">ri</name>st, and the hand broke off; but at the same moment the
                sword splintered <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name> the hilt. There was a sh<name type="GPE">ri</name>ek and the light vanished. In the
                dark there was a snarling noise.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> fell forward over <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>, and <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>'s face felt cold. All at once back into his
                mind, from which it had disappeared with the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> coming of the fog, came the
                memory of the house down under the <name type="ORG">Hill</name>, and of <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> singing. He remembered the rhyme
                that <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> had taught them. In a small desperate voice he began: _<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>! <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> <name type="GPE">Bombadil</name>!_
                and with that name his voice seemed to grow strong: it had a full and lively sound,
                and the dark chamber echoed as if to drum and trumpet.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Ho</name>! <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> <name type="GPE">Bombadil</name>, <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> <name type="GPE">Bombadil</name>lo!</p>
            <p>By water, wood and hill, by the reed and willow,</p>
            <p>By fire, sun and moon, harken now and hear us!</p>
            <p>Come, <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> <name type="GPE">Bombadil</name>, for our need is near us!</p>
            <p>There was a sudden deep silence, in which <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> could hear his heart beating. After a
                long slow moment he heard plain, but far away, as if it was coming down through the
                ground or through thick walls, an answe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng voice singing:</p>
            <p>Old <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> <name type="GPE">Bombadil</name> is a merry fellow,</p>
            <p>B<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght blue his jacket is, and his boots are yellow.</p>
            <p>N<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> has ever caught him yet, for <name type="PERSON">Tom</name>, he is the master:</p>
            <p>His songs are stronger songs, and his feet are faster.</p>
            <p>There was a loud rumbling sound, as of st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s rolling and falling, and suddenly light
                streamed in, real light, the plain light of <name type="DATE">day</name>. A low door-like opening appeared at
                the end of the chamber beyond <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s feet; and there was <name type="PERSON">Tom</name>'s head (hat, feather,
                and all) framed against the light of the sun <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing red behind him. The light fell
                upon the floor, and upon the faces of the <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> hobbits lying beside <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. They did
                not stir, but the sickly hue had left them. They looked now as if they were only
                very deeply asleep.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Tom</name> stooped, removed his hat, and came into the dark chamber, singing:</p>
            <p>Get out, you old <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Wight</name>! Vanish in the sunlight!</p>
            <p>Sh<name type="GPE">ri</name>vel like the cold mist, like the winds go wailing,</p>
            <p>Out into the barren lands far beyond the mountains!</p>
            <p>Come never here again! Leave your barrow empty!</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Lo</name>st and forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> be, darker than the darkness,</p>
            <p>Where gates stand for ever shut, till the world is mended.</p>
            <p>At these words there was a cry and part of the inner end of the chamber fell in with
                a crash. Then there was a long trailing sh<name type="GPE">ri</name>ek, fading away into an unguessable
                distance; and after that silence.</p>
            <p><q>'Come, f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Tom</name>. <q>'Let us get out on to clean grass! You must
                    help me bear them.'</q></p>
            <p>Together they car<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed out <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>, <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>, and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. As <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> left the barrow for the
                last time he thought he saw a severed hand w<name type="GPE">ri</name>ggling still, like a wounded spider,
                in a heap of fallen <name type="LOC">earth</name>. <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> went back in again, and there was a sound of much
                thumping and stamping. When he came out he was bea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng in his arms a great load of
                treasure: things of gold, silver, copper, and bronze; many beads and c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>ns and
                jewelled ornaments. He climbed the green barrow and laid them all on top in the
                sunshine.</p>
            <p>There he stood, with his hat in his hand and the wind in his <name type="PERSON">hai</name>r, and looked down
                upon the <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> hobbits, that had been laid on their backs upon the grass at the west
                side of the mound. Raising his <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght hand he said in a clear and commanding
                voice:</p>
            <p>Wake now my merry tads! Wake and hear me calling!</p>
            <p>Warm now be heart and limb! The cold st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> is fallen;</p>
            <p>Dark door is standing wide; dead hand is broken.</p>
            <p>Night under Night is flown, and the <name type="FAC">Gate</name> is open!</p>
            <p>To <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s great joy the hobbits stirred, stretched their arms, rubbed their eyes,
                and then suddenly sprang up. They looked about in amazement, <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> at <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, and
                then at <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> standing large as life on the barrow-top above them; and then at
                themselves in their thin white rags, crowned and belted with pale gold, and jingling
                with t<name type="GPE">ri</name>nkets.</p>
            <p><q>'What in the name of wonder?'</q> began <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>, feeling the golden circlet that had
                slipped over <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> eye. Then he stopped, and a shadow came over his face, and he
                closed his eyes. <q>'Of course, I remember!'</q> he said. <q>'The men of <name type="ORG">Carn D�m</name>
                    came on us at <name type="TIME">night</name>, and we were worsted. Ah! the spear in my heart!'</q> He
                clutched at his breast. <q>'No! No!'</q> he said, opening his eyes. <q>'What am I
                    saying? I have been dreaming. Where did you get to, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>?'</q></p>
            <p><q>'I thought that I was lost,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>; <q>'but I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t to speak of it.
                    Let us think of what we are to do now! Let us go on!'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Dressed up like this, sir?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <q>'Where are my clothes?'</q> He flung
                his circlet, belt, and <name type="GPE">ri</name>ngs on the grass, and looked round helplessly, as if he
                expected to find his cloak, jacket, and breeches, and other hobbit-garments lying
                somewhere to hand.</p>
            <p><q>'You won't find your clothes again,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Tom</name>, bounding down from the mound,
                and laughing as he danced round them in the sunlight. <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> would have thought that
                nothing dangerous or dreadful had happened; and indeed the horror faded out of their
                hearts as they looked at him, and saw the merry glint in his eyes.</p>
            <p><q>'What do you mean?'</q> asked <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>, looking at him, <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> puzzled and <name type="CARDINAL">half</name>
                amused. <q>'Why not?'</q></p>
            <p>But <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> shook his head, saying: <q>'You've found yourselves again, out of the deep
                    water. Clothes are but little loss, if you escape from drowning. Be glad, my
                    merry f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends, and let the warm sunlight heal now heart and limb! Cast off these
                    cold rags! Run naked on the grass, while <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> goes a-hunting!'</q></p>
            <p>He sprang away down hill, whistling and calling. <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>oking down after him <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> saw him
                running away southwards along the green hollow between their hill and the next,
                still whistling and crying:</p>
            <p>Hey! now! Come <name type="PERSON">hoy</name> now! Whither do you <name type="PERSON">wan</name>der?</p>
            <p>Up, down, near or far, here, there or yonder?</p>
            <p><name type="ORG">Sharp</name>-ears, <name type="PERSON">Wise</name>-nose, <name type="NORP">Swish</name>-tail and <name type="PERSON">Bumpkin</name>,</p>
            <p>White-socks my little lad, and old <name type="PERSON">Fatty</name> <name type="PERSON">Lumpkin</name>!</p>
            <p>So he sang, running fast, tossing up his hat and cat<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g it, until he was hidden by
                a fold of the ground: but for some time his _hey now! <name type="PERSON">hoy</name> now!_came floating back
                down the wind, which had shifted round towards the south.</p>
            <p>The air was growing very warm again. The hobbits ran about for a while on the grass,
                as he told them. Then they lay basking in the sun with the delight of those that
                have been wafted suddenly from bitter <name type="DATE">winter</name> to a f<name type="GPE">ri</name>endly clime, or of people that,
                after being long ill and bed<name type="GPE">ri</name>dden, wake <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> <name type="DATE">day</name> to find that they are unexpectedly
                well and the <name type="DATE">day</name> is again full of promise.</p>
            <p>By the time that <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> returned they were feeling strong (and hungry). He reappeared,
                hat <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>, over the brow of the hill, and behind him came in an obedient line _<name type="CARDINAL">six</name>_
                ponies: their own <name type="CARDINAL">five</name> and <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> more. The last was plainly old <name type="PERSON">Fatty</name> <name type="PERSON">Lumpkin</name>: he was
                larger, stronger, fatter (and older) than their own ponies. <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>, to whom the
                others belonged, had not, in fact, given them any such names, but they answered to
                the new names that <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> had given them for the rest of their lives. <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> called them
                <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> by <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> and they climbed over the brow and stood in a line. Then <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> bowed to the
                hobbits.</p>
            <p><q>'Here are your ponies, now!'</q> he said. <q>'They've more sense (in some ways)
                    than you <name type="PERSON">wan</name>de<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng hobbits have � more sense in their noses. For they sniff
                    danger ahead which you walk <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght into; and if they run to save themselves, then
                    they run the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght way. You must forgive them all; for though their hearts are
                    faithful, to face fear of <name type="ORG">Barrow</name>-wights is not what they were made for. See,
                    here they come again, b<name type="GPE">ri</name>nging all their burdens!'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Merry</name>, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> now clothed themselves in spare garments from their packs; and
                they soon felt too hot, for they were obliged to put on some of the thicker and
                warmer things that they had brought against the oncoming of <name type="DATE">winter</name>.</p>
            <p><q>'Where does that other old animal, that <name type="PERSON">Fatty</name> <name type="PERSON">Lumpkin</name>, come from?'</q> asked
                <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.</p>
            <p><q>'He's mine,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Tom</name>. <q>'My <name type="CARDINAL">four</name>-legged f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end; though I seldom <name type="GPE">ri</name>de him,
                    and he <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ders of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> far, free upon the hillsides. When your ponies stayed with
                    me, they got to know my <name type="PERSON">Lumpkin</name>; and they smelt him in the <name type="TIME">night</name>, and quickly
                    ran to meet him. I thought he'd look for them and with his words of wisdom take
                    all their fear away. But now, my jolly <name type="PERSON">Lumpkin</name>, old <name type="PERSON">Tom</name>'s going to <name type="GPE">ri</name>de. Hey!
                    he's coming with you, just to set you on the road; so he needs a pony. For you
                    cannot easily talk to hobbits that are <name type="GPE">ri</name>ding, when you're on your own legs
                    trying to trot beside them.'</q></p>
            <p>The hobbits were delighted to hear this, and thanked <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> many times; but he laughed,
                and said that they were so good at losing themselves that he would not feel happy
                till he had seen them safe over the borders of his land. <q>'I've got things to
                    do,'</q> he said: <q>'my making and my singing, my talking and my walking, and
                    my wat<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g of the country. <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> can't be always near to open doors and
                    willow-cracks. <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> has his house to mind, and <name type="PERSON">Goldberry</name> is waiting.'</q></p>
            <p>It was still fairly early by the sun, something <name type="CARDINAL">between <name type="CARDINAL">nine</name> and <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name></name>, and the hobbits
                turned their minds to food. Their last meal had been lunch beside the standing st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>
                the <name type="DATE">day</name> before. They breakfasted now off the remainder of <name type="PERSON">Tom</name>'s provisions, meant
                for their supper, with additions that <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> had brought with him. It was not a large
                meal (conside<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng hobbits and the circumstances), but they felt much better for it.
                While they were eating <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> went <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name> the mound, and looked through the treasures.
                Most of these he made into a pile that glis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed and sparkled on the grass. He bade
                them lie there 'free to all finders, birds, beasts. <name type="ORG">Elves</name> or <name type="ORG">Men</name>, and all kindly
                creatures'; for so the spell of the mound should be broken and scattered and no
                <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Wight</name> ever come back to it. He chose for himself from the pile a brooch set with
                blue st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s, many-shaded like flax-flowers or the wings of blue butterflies. He
                looked long at it, as if stirred by some memory, shaking his head, and saying at
                last:</p>
            <p>
                <q>'Here is a pretty toy for <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> and for his lady! <name type="ORG">Fair</name> was she who <name type="DATE">long ago</name> wore
                    this on her shoulder. <name type="PERSON">Goldberry</name> shall wear it now, and we will not forget
                    her!'</q>
            </p>
            <p>For each of the hobbits he chose a dagger, long, leaf-shaped, and keen, of <name type="PERSON">mar</name>vellous
                workmanship, damasked with serpent-forms in red and gold. They gleamed as he drew
                them from their black sheaths, wrought of some strange metal, light and strong, and
                set with many fiery st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s. Whether by some virtue in these sheaths or because of
                the spell that lay on the mound, the blades seemed untouched by time, unrusted,
                sharp, glitte<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng in the sun.</p>
            <p><q>'Old knives are long enough as swords for hobbit-people,'</q> he said. <q>'<name type="ORG">Sharp</name>
                    blades are good to have, if <name type="LOC">Shire</name>-folk go walking, east, south, or far away into
                    dark and danger.'</q> Then he told them that these blades were forged many long
                <name type="DATE">year</name>s ago by <name type="ORG">Men</name> of <name type="LOC">West</name>ernesse: they were foes of the Dark <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd, but they were
                overcome by the evil king of <name type="ORG">Carn D�m</name> in the Land of Ang<name type="PERSON">mar</name>.</p>
            <p><q>'Few now remember them,'</q> <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> murmured, <q>'yet still some go <name type="PERSON">wan</name>de<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng, sons
                    of forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> kings walking in l<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>liness, guarding from evil things folk that
                    are heedless.'</q></p>
            <p>The hobbits did not understand his words, but as he spoke they had a vision as it
                were of a great expanse of <name type="DATE">year</name>s behind them, like a vast shadowy plain over which
                there strode shapes of <name type="ORG">Men</name>, tall and g<name type="GPE">ri</name>m with b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght swords, and last came <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> with
                a star on his brow. Then the vision faded, and they were back in the sunlit world.
                It was time to start again. They made ready, packing their bags and lading their
                ponies. Their new weapons they hung on their leather belts under their jackets,
                feeling them very awkward, and wonde<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng if they would be of any use. Fighting had
                not before occurred to any of them as <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the adventures in which their flight
                would land them.</p>
            <p>At last they set off. They led their ponies down the hill; and then mounting they
                trotted quickly along the valley. They looked back and saw the top of the old mound
                on the hill, and from it the sunlight on the gold went up like a yellow flame. Then
                they turned a shoulder of the <name type="LOC">Downs</name> and it was hidden from view.</p>
            <p>Though <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> looked about him on every side he saw no sign of the great st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s
                standing like a gate, and before long they came to the northern gap and rode swiftly
                through, and the land fell away before them. It was a merry journey with <name type="PERSON">Tom</name>
                <name type="GPE">Bombadil</name> trotting gaily beside them, or before them, on <name type="PERSON">Fatty</name> <name type="PERSON">Lumpkin</name>, who could
                move much faster than his girth promised. <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> sang most of the time, but it was
                chiefly nonsense, or else perhaps a strange language unknown to the hobbits, an
                ancient language whose words were mainly those of wonder and delight.</p>
            <p>They went forward steadily, but they soon saw that the <name type="FAC">Road</name> was further away than
                they had imagined. Even without a fog, their sleep at mid-<name type="DATE">day</name> would have prevented
                them from rea<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g it until after <name type="TIME">night</name>fall on the <name type="DATE">day</name> before. The dark line they
                had seen was not a line of trees but a line of <name type="PERSON">bush</name>es growing on the edge of a deep
                dike with a steep wall on the further side. <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> said that it had once been the
                boundary of a kingdom, but a very long lime ago. He seemed to remember something sad
                about it, and would not say much.</p>
            <p>They climbed down and out of the dike and through a gap in the wall, and then <name type="PERSON">Tom</name>
                turned due north, for they had been bea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng somewhat to the west. The land was now
                open and fairly level, and they quickened their pace, but the sun was already
                sinking low when at last they saw a line of tall trees ahead, and they knew that
                they had come back to the <name type="FAC">Road</name> after many unexpected adventures. They galloped their
                ponies over the last furlongs, and halted under the long shadows of the trees. They
                were on the top of a sloping bank, and the <name type="FAC">Road</name>, now dim as <name type="TIME">evening</name> drew on, wound
                away below them. At this point it ran nearly from <name type="LOC">South</name>-west to <name type="LOC">North</name>-east, and on
                their <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght it fell quickly down into a wide hollow. It was rutted and bore many
                signs of the recent heavy rain; there were pools and pot-holes full of water. They
                rode down the bank and looked up and down. There was nothing to be seen. <q>'Well,
                    here we are again at last!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'I suppose we haven't lost more
                    than <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> <name type="DATE">day</name>s by my short cut through the <name type="ORG">Forest</name>! But perhaps the delay will
                    prove useful � it may have put them off our trail.'</q></p>
            <p>The others looked at him. The shadow of the fear of the <name type="ORG">Black</name> <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s came suddenly
                over them again. Ever since they had entered the <name type="ORG">Forest</name> they had thought chiefly of
                getting back to the <name type="FAC">Road</name>; only now when it lay beneath their feet did they remember
                the danger which pursued them, and was more than likely to be lying in wait for them
                upon the <name type="FAC">Road</name> itself. They looked anxiously back towards the setting sun, but the
                <name type="FAC">Road</name> was brown and empty.</p>
            <p><q>'Do you think,'</q> asked <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> hesitatingly, <q>'do you think we may be pursued,
                    to<name type="TIME">night</name>?'</q></p>
            <p><q>'No, I hope not to<name type="TIME">night</name>,'</q> answered <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> <name type="GPE">Bombadil</name>; <q>'nor perhaps the next <name type="DATE">day</name>.
                    But do not trust my guess; for I cannot tell for certain. Out east my knowledge
                    fails. <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> is not master of <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s from the <name type="ORG">Black</name> Land far beyond his
                    country.'</q></p>
            <p>All the same the hobbits wished he was coming with them. They felt that he would know
                how to deal with <name type="ORG">Black</name> <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s, if any<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> did. They would soon now be going forward
                into lands wholly strange to them, and beyond all but the most vague and distant
                legends of the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>, and in the gathe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng <name type="TIME">twilight</name> they longed for home. A deep
                l<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>liness and sense of loss was on them. They stood silent, reluctant to make the
                final parting, and only slowly became aware that <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> was wishing them farewell, and
                telling them to have good heart and to <name type="GPE">ri</name>de on till dark without halting.</p>
            <p>
                <q>'<name type="PERSON">Tom</name> will give you good advice, till this <name type="DATE">day</name> is over (after that your own luck
                    must go with you and guide you): <name type="CARDINAL">four</name> miles along the <name type="FAC">Road</name> you'll come upon a
                    village, <name type="PERSON">Bree</name> under <name type="PERSON">Bree</name>-hill, with doors looking westward. There you'll find an
                    old inn that is called _<name type="PERSON">The Prancing Pony</name>._ <name type="PERSON">Barliman</name> <name type="PERSON">Butterbur</name> is the worthy
                    keeper. There you can stay the <name type="TIME">night</name>, and afterwards the <name type="TIME">morning</name> will speed you
                    upon your way. Be bold, but wary! Keep up your merry hearts, and <name type="GPE">ri</name>de to meet
                    your fortune!'</q>
            </p>
            <p>They begged him to come at least as far as the inn and d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk once more with them; but
                he laughed and refused, saying:</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Tom</name>'s country ends here: he will not pass the borders.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Tom</name> has his house to mind, and <name type="PERSON">Goldberry</name> is waiting!</p>
            <p>Then he turned, tossed up his hat, leaped on <name type="PERSON">Lumpkin</name>'s back, and rode up over the
                bank and away singing into the <name type="TIME">dusk</name>.</p>
            <p>The hobbits climbed up and watched him until he was out of sight.</p>
            <p><q>'I am sorry to take leave of Master <name type="GPE">Bombadil</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <q>'He's a caution
                    and no mistake. I reckon we may go a good deal further and see naught better,
                    nor queerer. But I won't deny I'll be glad to see this _Prancing Pony_he spoke
                    of. I hope it'll be like _The Green Dragon_ away back home! What sort of folk
                    are they in <name type="PERSON">Bree</name>?'</q></p>
            <p><q>'There are hobbits in <name type="PERSON">Bree</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>, <q>'as well as Big Folk. I daresay it
                    will be homelike enough. _The Pony_ is a good inn by all accounts. My people
                    <name type="GPE">ri</name>de out there now and again.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'It may be all we could wish,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>; <q>'but it is outside the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> all
                    the same. <name type="PERSON">Don</name>'t make yourselves too much at home! Please remember -all of you �
                    that the name of <name type="PERSON">Baggins</name> must NOT be menti<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>d. I am Mr. <name type="PERSON">Underhill</name>, if any name
                    must be given.'</q></p>
            <p>They now mounted their ponies and rode off silently into the <name type="TIME">evening</name>. <name type="PRODUCT">Darkness</name> came
                down quickly, as they plodded slowly downhill and up again, until at last they saw
                lights twinkling some distance ahead.</p>
            <p>Before them rose <name type="PERSON">Bree</name>-hill bar<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng the way, a dark mass against misty stars; and
                under its western flank nestled a large village. Towards it they now hur<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed
                desi<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng only to find a fire, and a door between them and the <name type="TIME">night</name>.</p>

            <p>At the Sign of</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">The Prancing Pony</name>_</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Bree</name> was the chief village of the <name type="PERSON">Bree</name>-land, a small inhabited region, like an island
                in the empty lands round about. Besides <name type="PERSON">Bree</name> itself, there was <name type="ORG">Staddle</name> on the other
                side of the hill, <name type="PERSON">Combe</name> in a deep valley a little further eastward, and <name type="PERSON">Archet</name> on
                the edge of the <name type="PERSON">Che<name type="CARDINAL">two</name>od</name>. Lying round <name type="PERSON">Bree</name>-hill and the villages was a small country
                of fields and tamed woodland only <name type="QUANTITY">a few miles</name> broad.</p>
            <p>The <name type="ORG">Men</name> of <name type="PERSON">Bree</name> were brown-<name type="PERSON">hai</name>red, broad, and rather short, cheerful and independent:
                they belonged to nobody but themselves; but they were more f<name type="GPE">ri</name>endly and familiar
                with <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbits, <name type="ORG">Dwarves</name>, <name type="ORG">Elves</name>, and other inhabitants of the world about them than was
                (or is) usual with <name type="ORG">Big People</name>. According to their own tales they were the o<name type="GPE">ri</name>ginal
                inhabitants and were the descendants of the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> <name type="ORG">Men</name> that ever <name type="PERSON">wan</name>dered into the
                <name type="LOC">West</name> of the middle-world. Few had survived the turmoils of the <name type="DATE">Elder Days</name>; but when
                the <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>gs returned again over the Great <name type="LOC">Sea</name> they had found the <name type="PERSON">Bree</name>-men still there,
                and they were still there now, when the memory of the old <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>gs had faded into the
                grass.</p>
            <p>In those <name type="DATE">day</name>s no other <name type="ORG">Men</name> had settled dwellings so far west, or within <name type="CARDINAL">a <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name></name>
                leagues of the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>. But in the wild lands beyond <name type="PERSON">Bree</name> there were myste<name type="GPE">ri</name>ous
                <name type="PERSON">wan</name>derers. The <name type="PERSON">Bree</name>-folk called them <name type="PRODUCT">Ranger</name>s, and knew nothing of their o<name type="GPE">ri</name>gin. They
                were taller and darker than the <name type="ORG">Men</name> of <name type="PERSON">Bree</name> and were believed to have strange powers
                of sight and hea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng, and to understand the languages of beasts and birds. They
                roamed at will southwards, and eastwards even as far as the <name type="LOC">Misty <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s</name>; but
                they were now few and rarely seen. When they appeared they brought news from afar,
                and told strange forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> tales which were eagerly lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed to; but the <name type="PERSON">Bree</name>-folk
                did not make f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends of them.</p>
            <p>There were also many families of hobbits in the <name type="PERSON">Bree</name>-land and _they_claimed to be the
                oldest settlement of <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbits in the world, <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> that was founded long before even the
                <name type="ORG">Brand</name>ywine was crossed and the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> colonized. They lived mostly in <name type="ORG">Staddle</name> though
                there were some in <name type="PERSON">Bree</name> itself, especially on the higher slopes of the hill, above
                the houses of the <name type="ORG">Men</name>. The Big Folk and <name type="WORK_OF_ART">the Little Folk</name> (as they called <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> another)
                were on f<name type="GPE">ri</name>endly terms, minding their own affairs in their own ways, but both
                <name type="GPE">ri</name>ghtly regarding themselves as necessary parts of the <name type="PERSON">Bree</name>-folk. Nowhere else in
                the world was this peculiar (but excellent) arrangement to be found.</p>
            <p>The <name type="PERSON">Bree</name>-folk, <name type="ORG">Big and Little</name>, did not themselves travel much; and the affairs of the
                <name type="CARDINAL">four</name> villages were their chief concern. Occasionally the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbits of <name type="PERSON">Bree</name> went as far
                as <name type="PERSON">Buckland</name>, or the <name type="LOC">East</name>farthing; but though their link land was not much further
                than <name type="DATE">a <name type="DATE">day</name></name>'s <name type="GPE">ri</name>ding east of the <name type="ORG">Brand</name>ywine <name type="FAC">B<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge</name>, the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbits of the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> now
                seldom visited it. An occasional <name type="PERSON">Buckland</name>er or adventurous <name type="PERSON">Took</name> would come out to
                the Inn for <name type="TIME">a <name type="TIME">night</name></name> or <name type="CARDINAL">two</name>, but even that was becoming less and less usual. The
                <name type="LOC">Shire</name>-hobbits referred to those of <name type="PERSON">Bree</name>, and to any others that lived beyond the
                borders, as <name type="ORG">Outsiders</name>, and took very little interest in them, conside<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng them dull
                and uncouth. There were probably many more <name type="ORG">Outsiders</name> scattered about in the <name type="LOC">West</name> of
                the World in those <name type="DATE">day</name>s than the people of the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> imagined. Some, doubtless, were
                no better than tramps, ready to dig a hole in any bank and stay only as long as it
                suited them. But in the <name type="PERSON">Bree</name>-land, at any rate, the hobbits were decent and
                prosperous, and no more rustic than most of their distant relatives Inside. It was
                not yet forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> that there had been a time when there was much coming and going
                between the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> and <name type="PERSON">Bree</name>. There was <name type="PERSON">Bree</name>-blood in the <name type="ORG">Brand</name>ybucks by all
                accounts.</p>
            <p>The village of <name type="PERSON">Bree</name> had some <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name> st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> houses of the Big Folk, mostly above the
                <name type="FAC">Road</name>, nestling on the hillside with windows looking west. On that side, running in
                more than <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> a circle from the hill and back to it, there was a deep dike with a
                thick hedge on the inner side. Over this the <name type="FAC">Road</name> crossed by a causeway; but where
                it pierced the hedge it was barred by a great gate. There was another gate in the
                southern comer where the <name type="FAC">Road</name> ran out of the village. The gates were closed at
                <name type="TIME">night</name>fall; but just inside them were small lodges for the gatekeepers.</p>
            <p>Down on the <name type="FAC">Road</name>, where it swept to the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght to go round the foot of the hill, there
                was a large inn. It had been built <name type="DATE">long ago</name> when the traffic on the roads had been
                far greater. For <name type="PERSON">Bree</name> stood at an old meeting of ways; another ancient road crossed
                the <name type="LOC">East</name> <name type="FAC">Road</name> just outside (he dike at the western end of the village, and in former
                <name type="DATE">day</name>s <name type="ORG">Men</name> and other folk of va<name type="GPE">ri</name>ous sorts had travelled much on it. _<name type="ORG">Strange as News</name>
                from <name type="PERSON">Bree</name>_ was still a saying in the <name type="LOC">East</name>farthing, descending from those <name type="DATE">day</name>s, when
                news from <name type="LOC">North</name>, <name type="LOC">South</name>, and <name type="LOC">East</name> could be heard in the inn, and when the
                <name type="LOC">Shire</name>-hobbits used to go more of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> to hear it. But the <name type="LOC">North</name>ern Lands had long been
                desolate, and the <name type="LOC">North</name> <name type="FAC">Road</name> was now seldom used: it was grass-grown, and the
                <name type="PERSON">Bree</name>-folk called it the <name type="FAC">Greenway</name>.</p>
            <p>The Inn of <name type="PERSON">Bree</name> was still there, however, and the innkeeper was an imp<name type="GPE">ortan</name>t person.
                His house was a meeting place for the idle, talkative, and inquisitive among the
                inhabitants, large and small, of the <name type="CARDINAL">four</name> villages; and a resort of <name type="PRODUCT">Ranger</name>s and
                other <name type="PERSON">wan</name>derers, and for such travellers (mostly dwarves) as still journeyed on the
                <name type="LOC">East</name> <name type="FAC">Road</name>, to and from the <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s.</p>
            <p>It was dark, and white stars were shining, when <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and his companions came at last
                to the <name type="FAC">Greenway</name>-crossing and drew near the village. They came to the <name type="LOC">West</name>-gate and
                found it shut, but at the door of the lodge beyond it, there was a man sitting. He
                jumped up and fetched a lantern and looked over the gate at them in surp<name type="GPE">ri</name>se.</p>
            <p><q>'What do you <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t, and where do you come from?'</q> he asked gruffly.</p>
            <p><q>'We are making for the inn here,'</q> answered <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'We are journeying east
                    and cannot go further to<name type="TIME">night</name>.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbits! <name type="CARDINAL">Four</name> hobbits! And what's more, out of the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> by their talk,'</q> said
                the gatekeeper, softly as if speaking to himself. He stared at them darkly for a
                moment, and then slowly opened the gate and let them <name type="GPE">ri</name>de through.</p>
            <p><q>'We <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> see <name type="LOC">Shire</name>-folk <name type="GPE">ri</name>ding on the <name type="FAC">Road</name> at <name type="TIME">night</name>,'</q> he went on, as
                they halted a moment by his door. <q>'You'll par<name type="PERSON">don</name> my wonde<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng what business takes
                    you away east of <name type="PERSON">Bree</name>! What may your names be, might I ask?'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Our names and our business are our own, and this does not seem a good place to
                    discuss them,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, not liking the look of the man or the t<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of his
                voice.</p>
            <p><q>'Your business is your own, no doubt,'</q> said the man; <q>'but it's my business
                    to ask questions after <name type="TIME">night</name>fall.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'We are hobbits from <name type="PERSON">Buckland</name>, and we have a fancy to travel and to stay at the
                    inn here,'</q> put in <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'I am Mr. <name type="ORG">Brand</name>ybuck. Is that enough for you?
                    The <name type="PERSON">Bree</name>-folk used to be fair-spoken to travellers, or so I had heard.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'All <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght, all <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght!'</q> said the man. <q>'I meant no of<name type="PERSON">fen</name>ce. But you'll find
                    maybe that more folk than old <name type="PERSON">Harry</name> at the gate will be asking you questions.
                    There's queer folk about. If you go on to _The Pony,_ you'll find you're oat the
                    only guests.'</q></p>
            <p>He wished them good <name type="TIME">night</name>, and they said no more; but <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> could see in the
                lantern-light that the man was still eyeing them cu<name type="GPE">ri</name>ously. He was glad to hear the
                gate clang to behind them, as they rode forward. He wondered why the man was so
                suspicious, and whether any <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> had been asking for _news of_ a party of hobbits.
                Could it have been <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>? He might have ar<name type="GPE">ri</name>ved, while they were delayed in the
                <name type="ORG">Forest</name> and the <name type="LOC">Downs</name>. But there was something in the look and the voice of the
                gatekeeper that made him uneasy.</p>
            <p>The man stared after the hobbits for a moment, and then he went back to his house. As
                soon as his back was turned, a dark figure climbed quickly in over the gate and
                melted into the shadows of the village street.</p>
            <p>The hobbits rode on up a gentle slope, passing a few detached houses, and drew up
                outside the inn. The houses looked large and strange to them. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> stared up at the
                inn with its <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> storeys and many windows, and felt his heart sink. He had
                imagined himself meeting <name type="ORG">giants</name> taller than trees, and other creatures even more
                ter<name type="GPE">ri</name>fying, some time or other in the course of his journey; but at the moment he
                was finding his <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> sight of <name type="ORG">Men</name> and their tall houses quite enough, indeed too
                much for the dark end of a ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng <name type="DATE">day</name>. He pictured black horses standing all saddled
                in the shadows of the inn-yard, and <name type="ORG">Black</name> <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s pee<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng out of dark upper
                windows.</p>
            <p><q>'We surely aren't going to stay here for the <name type="TIME">night</name>, are we, sir?'</q> he
                exclaimed. <q>'If there are hobbit-folk in these pans, why <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t we look for some
                    that would be willing to take us in? It would be more homelike.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'What's wrong with the inn?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Tom</name> <name type="GPE">Bombadil</name> recommended it. I
                    expect it's homelike enough inside.'</q></p>
            <p>Even from the outside the inn looked a pleasant house to familiar eyes. It had a
                front on the <name type="FAC">Road</name>, and <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> wings running back on land partly cut out of the lower
                slopes of the hill, so that at the rear the <name type="ORG">sec</name>ond-floor windows were level with the
                ground. There was a wide arch leading to a courtyard between the <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> wings, and on
                the left under the arch there was a large doorway reached by a few broad steps. The
                door was open and light streamed out of it. Above the arch there was a lamp, and
                beneath it swung a large signboard: a fat white pony reared up on its hind legs.
                Over the door was painted in white letters: <name type="ORG">THE PRANCING PONY</name> by BARLIMAN BUTTERBUR.
                Many of the lower windows showed lights behind thick curtains.</p>
            <p>As they hesitated outside in the gloom, some<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> began singing a merry song inside,
                and many cheerful voices joined loudly in the chorus. They lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed to this
                encouraging sound for a moment and then got off their ponies. The song ended and
                there was a burst of laughter and clapping.</p>
            <p>They led their ponies under the arch, and leaving them standing in the yard they
                climbed up the steps. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> went forward and nearly bumped into a short fat man with
                a bald head and a red face. He had a white apron on, and was bustling out of <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>
                door and in through another, carrying a tray laden with full mugs.</p>
            <p><q>'Can we-'</q> began <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.</p>
            <p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Hal</name>f <name type="TIME">a minute</name>, if you please!'</q> shouted the man over his shoulder, and
                vanished into a babel of voices and a cloud of smoke. In a moment he was out again,
                wiping his hands on his apron.</p>
            <p><q>'Good <name type="TIME">evening</name>, little master!'</q> he said, bending down. <q>'What may you be
                    <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ting?'</q></p>
            <p>
                <q>'Beds for <name type="CARDINAL">four</name>, and stabling for <name type="CARDINAL">five</name> ponies, if that can be managed. Are you Mr.
                    <name type="PERSON">Butterbur</name>?'</q>
            </p>
            <p><q>'That's <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght! <name type="PERSON">Barliman</name> is my name. <name type="PERSON">Barliman</name> <name type="PERSON">Butterbur</name> at your service! You're
                    from the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>, eh?'</q> he said, and then suddenly he clapped his hand to his
                forehead, as if trying to remember something. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbits!'</q> he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed. <q>'Now
                    what does that remind me of? Might I ask your names, sir?'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Mr. <name type="PERSON">Took</name> and Mr. <name type="ORG">Brand</name>ybuck,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>; <q>'and this is <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> <name type="PERSON">Gamgee</name>. My name
                    is <name type="PERSON">Underhill</name>.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'There now!'</q> said Mr. <name type="PERSON">Butterbur</name>, snapping his fingers. 'It's g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> again! But
                it'll come back, when I have time to think. I'm run off my feet; but I'll see what I
                can do for you. We <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> get a party out of the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> nowa<name type="DATE">day</name>s, and I should
                be sorry not to make you welcome. But there is such a crowd already in the house
                to<name type="TIME">night</name> as there hasn't been for long enough. It never rains but it pours, we say in
                <name type="PERSON">Bree</name>.</p>
            <p><q>'Hi! <name type="PERSON">Nob</name>!'</q> he shouted. <q>'Where are you, you woolly-footed slow-coach?
                    <name type="PERSON">Nob</name>!'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Coming, sir! Coming!'</q> A cheery-looking hobbit bobbed out of a door, and
                seeing the travellers, stopped short and stared at them with great interest.</p>
            <p><q>'Where's <name type="PERSON">Bob</name>?'</q> asked the landlord. <q>'You <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t know? Well find him! Double
                    sharp! I haven't got <name type="CARDINAL">six</name> legs, nor <name type="CARDINAL">six</name> eyes neither! Tell <name type="PERSON">Bob</name> there's <name type="CARDINAL">five</name>
                    ponies that have to be stabled. He must find room somehow.'</q> <name type="PERSON">Nob</name> trotted off
                with a g<name type="GPE">ri</name>n and a wink.</p>
            <p><q>'Well, now, what was I going to say?'</q> said Mr. <name type="PERSON">Butterbur</name>, tapping his
                forehead. <q>'<name type="CARDINAL">One</name> thing d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ves out another, so to speak. I'm that busy to<name type="TIME">night</name>, my
                    head is going round. There's a party that came up the <name type="FAC">Greenway</name> from down <name type="LOC">South</name>
                    <name type="TIME">last <name type="TIME">night</name></name> � and that was strange enough to begin with. Then there's a
                    travelling company of dwarves going <name type="LOC">West</name> come in this <name type="TIME">evening</name>. And now there's
                    you. If you weren't hobbits, I doubt if we could house you. But we've got a room
                    or <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> in the north wing that were made special for hobbits, when this place was
                    built. On the ground floor as they usually prefer; round windows and all as they
                    like it. I hope you'll be comfortable. You'll be <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ting supper, I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t doubt.
                    As soon as may be. This way now!'</q></p>
            <p>He led them a short way down a passage, and opened a door. <q>'Here is a nice little
                    parlour!'</q> he said. <q>'I hope it will suit. Excuse me now. I'm that busy. No
                    time for talking. I must be trotting. It's hard work for <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> legs, but I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t
                    get thinner. I'll look in again later. If you <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t anything, <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng the hand-bell,
                    and <name type="PERSON">Nob</name> will come. If he <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t come, <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng and shout!'</q></p>
            <p>Off he went at last, and left them feeling rather breathless. He seemed capable of an
                endless stream of talk, however busy he might be. They found themselves in a small
                and cosy room. There was a bit of b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght fire burning on the h<name type="LOC">earth</name>, and in front of
                it were some low and comfortable c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>rs. There was a round table, already spread
                with a white cloth, and on it was a large hand-bell. But <name type="PERSON">Nob</name>, the hobbit servant,
                came bustling in long before they thought of <name type="GPE">ri</name>nging. He brought candles and a tray
                full of plates.</p>
            <p><q>'Will you be <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ting anything to d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk, masters?'</q> he asked. <q>'And shall I
                    show you the bedrooms, while your supper is got ready?'</q></p>
            <p>They were washed and in the middle of good deep mugs of beer when Mr. <name type="PERSON">Butterbur</name> and
                <name type="PERSON">Nob</name> came in again. In a twinkling the table was laid. There was hot soup, cold
                meats, a blackberry tart, new loaves, slabs of butter, and <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> a <name type="GPE">ri</name>pe cheese: good
                plain food, as good as the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> could show, and homelike enough to dispel the last
                of <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>'s misgivings (already much relieved by the excellence of the beer).</p>
            <p>The landlord hovered round for a link, and then prepared to leave them. <q>'I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t
                    know whether you would care to join the company, when you have supped,'</q> he
                said, standing at the door. <q>'Perhaps you would rather go to your beds. Still the
                    company would be very pleased to welcome you_,_ if you had a mind. We <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t get
                    <name type="ORG">Outsiders</name> � travellers from the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>, I should say, begging your par<name type="PERSON">don</name> �
                    of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>; and we like to hear a bit of news, or any story or song you may have in
                    mind. But as you please! <name type="ORG">Ring</name> the bell, if you lack anything!'</q></p>
            <p>So refreshed and encouraged did they feel at the end of their supper (about <name type="CARDINAL">three</name>
                quarters of <name type="TIME">an <name type="TIME">hour</name></name>'s steady going, not hindered by unnecessary talk) that <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>,
                <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>, and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> decided to join the company. <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> said it would be too stuffy.
                    <q>'I shall sit here quietly by the fire for a bit, and perhaps go out later for
                    a sniff of the air. Mind your Ps and Qs, and <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t forget that you are supposed
                    to be escaping in <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret, and are still _on_ the high-road and not very far from
                    the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>!'</q></p>
            <p><q>'All <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q>'Mind yourself! <name type="PERSON">Don</name>'t get lost, and <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t forget
                    that it is safer indoors!'</q></p>
            <p>The company was in the big common-room of the inn. The gathe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng was large and mixed,
                as <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> discovered, when his eyes got used to the light. This came chiefly from a
                blazing log-fire, for the <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> lamps hanging from the beams were dim, and <name type="CARDINAL">half</name>
                veiled in smoke. <name type="PERSON">Barliman</name> <name type="PERSON">Butterbur</name> was standing near the fire, talking to a couple
                of dwarves and <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> or <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> strange-looking men. On the benches were va<name type="GPE">ri</name>ous folk: men
                of <name type="PERSON">Bree</name>, a collection of local hobbits (sitting chatte<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng together), a few more
                dwarves, and other vague figures difficult to make out away in the shadows and
                comers.</p>
            <p>As soon as the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>-hobbits entered, there was a chorus of welcome from the
                <name type="PERSON">Bree</name>-landers. The strangers, especially those that had come up the <name type="FAC">Greenway</name>, stared
                at them cu<name type="GPE">ri</name>ously. The landlord introduced the newcomers to the <name type="PERSON">Bree</name>-folk, so
                quickly that, though they caught many names, they were seldom sure who the names
                belonged to. The <name type="ORG">Men</name> of <name type="PERSON">Bree</name> seemed all to have rather botanical (and to the
                <name type="LOC">Shire</name>-folk rather odd) names, like <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Rushlight</name>, <name type="GPE">Goatleaf</name>, <name type="PERSON">Heather</name>toes, <name type="ORG">Apple</name>dore,
                <name type="GPE">Thistlewool</name> and <name type="PERSON">Ferny</name> (not to mention <name type="PERSON">Butterbur</name>). Some of the hobbits had similar
                names. The <name type="PERSON">Mugwort</name>s, for instance, seemed numerous. But most of them had natural
                names, such as <name type="ORG">Banks, Brockhouse</name>, <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ngholes, <name type="PERSON">Sandheaver</name>, and <name type="PERSON">Tunnelly</name>, many of which
                were used in the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>. There were several <name type="PERSON">Underhill</name>s from <name type="ORG">Saddle</name>, and as they could
                not imagine sha<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng a name without being related, they took <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> to their hearts as
                a long-lost cousin.</p>
            <p>The <name type="PERSON">Bree</name>-hobbits were, in fact, f<name type="GPE">ri</name>endly and inquisitive, and <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> soon found that
                some explanation of what he was doing would have to be given. He gave out that he
                was interested in history and geography (at which there was much wagging of heads,
                although neither of these words were much used in the <name type="PERSON">Bree</name>-dialect). He said he was
                thinking of w<name type="GPE">ri</name>ting a book (at which there was silent astonishment), _and_ that he
                and his f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ted to collect information about hobbits living outside the
                <name type="LOC">Shire</name>, especially in the eastern lands.</p>
            <p>At this a chorus of voices broke out. If <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> had really <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ted to w<name type="GPE">ri</name>te a book, and
                had had many ears, he would have learned enough for several chapters in a few
                <name type="TIME">minutes</name>. And if that was not enough, he was given a whole list of names, beginning
                with 'Old <name type="PERSON">Barliman</name> here', to whom he could go for further information. But after a
                time, as <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> did not show any _sign_ of w<name type="GPE">ri</name>ting a book on the spot, the hobbits
                returned to their questions about doings in the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> did not prove very
                communicative, and he soon found himself sitting al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> in a comer, lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing and
                looking around.</p>
            <p>The <name type="ORG">Men</name> and <name type="ORG">Dwarves</name> were mostly talking of distant events and telling flews of a kind
                that was becoming only too familiar. There was trouble away in the <name type="LOC">South</name>, and it
                seemed that the <name type="ORG">Men</name> who had come up the <name type="FAC">Greenway</name> were on the move, looking for lands
                where they could find some peace. The <name type="PERSON">Bree</name>-folk were sympathetic, but plainly not
                very ready to take a large number of strangers into their little land. <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> of the
                travellers, a squint-eyed ill-favoured fellow, was foretelling that more and more
                people would be coming north in the near future. <q>'If room isn't found for them,
                    they'll find it for themselves. They've a <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght to live, same as other
                    folk,'</q> he said loudly. The local inhabitants did not look pleased at the
                prospect.</p>
            <p>The hobbits did not pay much at<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>tion to all this, and it did not at the moment seem
                to concern hobbits. Big Folk could hardly beg for lodgings in hobbit-holes. They
                were more interested in <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>, who were now feeling quite at home, and were
                chatting gaily about events in the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>. <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> roused a good deal of laughter with
                an account of the collapse of the roof of the Town <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>le in <name type="PERSON">Michel Delving</name>: Will
                <name type="PERSON">Whitfoot</name>, the <name type="DATE">May</name>or, and the fattest hobbit in the <name type="LOC">West</name>farthing, had been bu<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed in
                chalk, and came out like a floured dumpling. But there were several questions asked
                that made <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> a little uneasy. <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> of the <name type="PERSON">Bree</name>-landers, who seemed to have been in
                the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> several times, <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ted to know where the <name type="PERSON">Underhill</name>s lived and who they were
                related to.</p>
            <p>Suddenly <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> noticed that a strange-looking weather-bea<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> man, sitting in the
                shadows near the wall, was also lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing in<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>tly to the hobbit-talk. He had a tall
                tankard in front of him, and was smoking a long-stemmed pipe cu<name type="GPE">ri</name>ously carved. His
                legs were stretched out before him, showing high boots of supple leather that fitted
                him well, but had seen much wear and were now caked with mud. A travel-stained cloak
                of heavy dark-green cloth was drawn close about him, and in spite of the heat of the
                room he wore a hood that overshadowed his face; but the gleam of his eyes could be
                seen as he watched the hobbits.</p>
            <p><q>'Who is that?'</q> <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> asked, when he got a chance to whisper to Mr. <name type="PERSON">Butterbur</name>.
                    <q>'I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t think you introduced him?'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Him?'</q> said the landlord in an answe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng whisper, cocking an eye without
                turning his head. <q>'I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t <name type="GPE">ri</name>ghtly know. He is <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the <name type="PERSON">wan</name>de<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng folk -<name type="PRODUCT">Ranger</name>s
                    we call them. He seldom talks: not but what he can tell a rare tale when he has
                    the mind. He disappears for <name type="DATE">a month</name>, or <name type="DATE">a <name type="DATE">year</name></name>, and then he pops up again. He
                    was in and out pretty of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> <name type="DATE">last sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng</name>; but I haven't seen him about lately.
                    What his <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght name is I've never heard: but he's known round here as <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>.
                    Goes about at a great pace on his long shanks; though he <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t tell nobody what
                    cause he has to hurry. But there's no accounting for <name type="LOC">East</name> and <name type="LOC">West</name>, as we say in
                    <name type="PERSON">Bree</name>, meaning the <name type="PRODUCT">Ranger</name>s and the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>-folk, begging your par<name type="PERSON">don</name>. Funny you
                    should ask about him.'</q> But at that moment Mr. <name type="PERSON">Butterbur</name> was called away by a
                demand for more ale and his last re<name type="PERSON">mar</name>k remained unexplained.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> found that <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> was now looking at him, as if he had heard or guessed all
                that had been said. Presently, with a wave of his hand and a nod, he invited <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>
                to come over and sit by him. As <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> drew near be threw back his hood, showing a
                shaggy head of dark <name type="PERSON">hai</name>r necked with grey, and in a pale stem face a pair of keen
                grey eyes.</p>
            <p><q>'I am called <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>,'</q> he said in a low voice. <q>'I am very pleased to meet
                    you. Master � <name type="PERSON">Underhill</name>, if old <name type="PERSON">Butterbur</name> got your name <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'He did,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> stiffly. He felt far from comfortable under the stare of
                those keen eyes.</p>
            <p><q>'Well, Master <name type="PERSON">Underhill</name>,'</q> said <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>, <q>'if I were you, I should stop your
                    young f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends from talking too much. D<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk_,_ fire, and chance-meeting are
                    pleasant enough, but, well � this isn't the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>. There are queer folk about.
                    Though I say it as shouldn't, you may think,'</q> he added with a wry smile,
                seeing <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s glance. <q>'And there have been even stranger travellers through <name type="PERSON">Bree</name>
                    lately,'</q> he went on, wat<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s face.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> returned his gaze but said nothing; and <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> made no further sign. His
                at<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>tion seemed suddenly to be fixed on <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. To his alarm <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> became aware
                that the <name type="GPE">ri</name>diculous young <name type="PERSON">Took</name>, encouraged by his success with the fat <name type="DATE">May</name>or of
                <name type="PERSON">Michel Delving</name>, was now actually giving a comic account of <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>'s farewell party.
                He was already giving an imitation of the <name type="ORG">Speech</name>, and was drawing near to the
                astonishing Disappearance.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> was annoyed. It was a harmless enough tale for most of the local hobbits, no
                doubt: just a funny story about those funny people away beyond the <name type="LOC">River</name>; but some
                (old <name type="PERSON">Butterbur</name>, for instance) knew a thing or <name type="CARDINAL">two</name>, and had probably heard rumours
                <name type="DATE">long ago</name> about <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>'s vanishing. It would b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng the name of <name type="PERSON">Baggins</name> to their minds,
                especially if there had been inqui<name type="GPE">ri</name>es in <name type="PERSON">Bree</name> after that name.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> fidgeted, wonde<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng what to do. <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> was evidently much enjoying the
                at<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>tion he was getting, and had become quite forgetful of their danger. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> had
                a sudden fear that in his present mood he might even mention the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>; and that
                might well be disastrous.</p>
            <p><q>'You had better do something quick!'</q> whispered <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> in his ear.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> jumped up and stood on a table, and began to talk. The at<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>tion of <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>'s
                audience was disturbed. Some of the hobbits looked at <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and laughed and clapped,
                thinking that Mr. <name type="PERSON">Underhill</name> had taken as much ale as was good for him.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> suddenly felt very foolish, and found himself (as was his habit when making a
                speech) finge<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng the things in his pocket. He felt the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> on its c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>n, and quite
                unaccountably the desire came over him to slip it on and vanish out of the silly
                situation. It seemed to him, somehow, as if me suggestion came to him from outside,
                from some<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> or something a the room. He resisted the temptation firmly, and clasped
                the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> in his hand, as if to keep a hold on it and prevent it from escaping or
                doing _any_ mischief. At any rate it gave him no inspiration. He spoke 'a few
                suitable words', as they would have said in the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>: _We are all very much
                gratified by the kindness of your reception, and I venture to hope that my b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ef
                visit will help to renew the old ties of f<name type="GPE">ri</name>endship between the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> and <name type="PERSON">Bree</name>;_and
                then he hesitated and coughed.</p>
            <p>Every<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> in the room was now looking at him. <q>'A song!'</q> shouted <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the
                hobbits. <q>'A song! A song!'</q> shouted all the others. <q>'Come on now, master,
                    sing us something that we haven't heard before!'</q></p>
            <p>For a moment <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> stood gaping. Then in desperation he began a <name type="GPE">ri</name>diculous song that
                <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> had been rather fond of (and indeed rather proud of, for he had made up the
                words himself). It was about an inn; and that is probably why it came into <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s
                mind just then. Here it is in full. Only a few words of it are now, as a rule,
                remembered.</p>
            <p>There is an inn, a merry old inn</p>
            <p>beneath an old <name type="ORG">grey hill</name>,</p>
            <p>And there they brew a beer so brown</p>
            <p>That the Man in the <name type="PERSON">Moon</name> himself came down</p>
            <p><name type="CARDINAL">one</name> <name type="TIME">night</name> to d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk his fill.</p>
            <p>The ostler has a tipsy cat</p>
            <p>that plays a <name type="CARDINAL">five</name>-st<name type="GPE">ri</name>nged fiddle;</p>
            <p>And up and down he runs his bow,</p>
            <p>Now squeaking high, now pur<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng low,</p>
            <p>now sawing in the middle.</p>
            <p>The landlord keeps a little dog</p>
            <p>that is mighty fond of jokes;</p>
            <p>When there's good cheer among the guests,</p>
            <p>He cocks an ear at all the jests</p>
            <p>and laughs until he chokes.</p>
            <p>They also keep a horned cow</p>
            <p>as proud as any queen;</p>
            <p>But music turns her head like ale,</p>
            <p>And makes her wave her tufted tail</p>
            <p>and dance upon the green.</p>
            <p>And O! the rows of silver dishes</p>
            <p>and the store of silver spoons!</p>
            <p>For <name type="ORG">Sun</name><name type="DATE">day</name> there's a special pair,</p>
            <p>And these they polish up with care</p>
            <p>on <name type="DATE">Satur<name type="DATE">day</name></name> <name type="TIME">after<name type="TIME">noon</name></name>s.</p>
            <p>The Man in the <name type="PERSON">Moon</name> was d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nking deep,</p>
            <p>and the cat began to wail;</p>
            <p>A dish and a spoon on the table danced,</p>
            <p>The cow in the garden madly pranced,</p>
            <p>and the little dog chased his tail.</p>
            <p>The Man in the <name type="PERSON">Moon</name> took another mug,</p>
            <p>and then rolled beneath his c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>r;</p>
            <p>And there he dozed and dreamed of ale,</p>
            <p>Till in the sky the stars were pale,</p>
            <p>and <name type="TIME">dawn</name> was in the air.</p>
            <p>Then the ostler said to his tipsy cat:</p>
            <p>'The white horses of the <name type="PERSON">Moon</name>,</p>
            <p>They neigh and champ their silver bits;</p>
            <p>But their master's been and drowned his wits,</p>
            <p>and the <name type="ORG">Sun</name>'ll be <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing soon!'</p>
            <p>So the cat on his fiddle played <name type="PERSON">hey-diddle-diddle</name>,</p>
            <p>a jig that would wake the dead:</p>
            <p>He squeaked and sawed and quickened the tune,</p>
            <p>While the landlord shook the Man in the <name type="PERSON">Moon</name>:</p>
            <p><q>'It's after <name type="CARDINAL">three</name>!'</q> he said.</p>
            <p>They rolled the Man slowly up the hill</p>
            <p>and bundled him into the <name type="PERSON">Moon</name>,</p>
            <p>While his horses galloped up in rear,</p>
            <p>And the cow came cape<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng like a deer,</p>
            <p>and a dish ran up with the spoon.</p>
            <p>Now quicker the fiddle went deedle-dum-diddle;</p>
            <p>the dog began to roar,</p>
            <p>The cow and the horses stood on their heads;</p>
            <p>The guests all bounded from their beds</p>
            <p>and danced upon the floor.</p>
            <p>With a ping and a pong the fiddle-st<name type="GPE">ri</name>ngs broke!</p>
            <p>the cow jumped over the <name type="PERSON">Moon</name>,</p>
            <p>And the little dog laughed to see such fun,</p>
            <p>And the <name type="DATE">Satur<name type="DATE">day</name></name> dish went off at a run</p>
            <p>with the silver <name type="ORG">Sun</name><name type="DATE">day</name> spoon.</p>
            <p>The round <name type="PERSON">Moon</name> rolled behind the hill</p>
            <p>as the <name type="ORG">Sun</name> raised up her head.</p>
            <p>She hardly believed her fiery eyes;</p>
            <p>For though it was <name type="DATE">day</name>, to her surp<name type="GPE">ri</name>se</p>
            <p>they all went back to bed!</p>
            <p>There was loud and long applause. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> had a good voice, and the song tickled their
                fancy. <q>'Where's old <name type="ORG">Barley</name>?'</q> they c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed. <q>'He ought to hear this. <name type="PERSON">Bob</name> ought
                    to learn his cat the fiddle, and then we'd have a dance.'</q> They called for
                more ale, and began to shout: <q>'Let's have it again, master! Come on now! Once
                    more!'</q></p>
            <p>They made <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> have another d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk, and then begin his song again, while many of them
                joined in; for the tune was well known, and they were quick at picking up words. It
                was now <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s turn to feel pleased with himself. He capered about on the table;
                and when he came a <name type="ORG">sec</name>ond time to _the cow jumped over the <name type="PERSON">Moon</name>,_ he leaped in the
                air. Much too vigorously; for he came down, bang, into a tray full of mugs, and
                slipped, and rolled off the table with a crash, clatter, and bump! The audience all
                opened their mouths wide for laughter, and stopped short a gaping silence; for the
                singer disappeared. He simply vanished, as if he had g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> slap through the floor
                without leaving a hole!</p>
            <p>The local hobbits stared in amazement, and then sprang to their feet and shouted for
                <name type="PERSON">Barliman</name>. All the company drew away from <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, who found themselves left
                al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> in a comer, and eyed darkly and doubtfully from a distance. It was plain that
                many people regarded them now as the companions of a travelling magician of unknown
                powers and purpose. But there was <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> <name type="PERSON">swart</name>hy <name type="PERSON">Bree</name>-lander, who stood looking at them
                with a knowing and <name type="CARDINAL">half</name>-mocking expression that made them feel very uncomfortable.
                Presently he slipped out of the door, followed by the squint-eyed southerner: the
                <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> had been whispe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng together a good deal du<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng the <name type="TIME">evening</name>. <name type="PERSON">Harry</name> the
                gatekeeper also went out just behind them..</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> felt a fool. Not knowing what else to do, he crawled away under the tables to
                the dark comer by <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>, who sat unmoved, giving no sign of his thoughts. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>
                leaned back against the wall and took off the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w it came to be on his finger
                he could not tell. He could only suppose that he had been handling it in his pocket
                while he sang, and that somehow it had slipped on when he stuck out his hand with a
                jerk to save his fall. For a moment he wondered if the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> itself had not played
                him a t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ck; perhaps it had t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed to reveal itself in response to some wish or
                command that was felt in the room. He did not like the looks of the men that had
                g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> out.</p>
            <p><q>'Well?'</q> said <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>, when he reappeared. <q>'Why did you do that? Worse than
                    anything your f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends could have said! You have put your foot in it! Or should I
                    say your finger?'</q></p>
            <p><q>'I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t know what you mean,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, annoyed and alarmed.</p>
            <p><q>'Oh yes, you do,'</q> answered <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>; <q>'but we had better wait until the
                    uproar has died down. Then, if you please, Mr. _<name type="PERSON">Baggins</name>, I_ should like a quiet
                    word with you.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'What about?'</q> asked <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, igno<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng the sudden use of his proper name.</p>
            <p><q>'A matter of some imp<name type="GPE">ortan</name>ce � to us both,'</q> answered <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>, looking <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> in
                the eye. <q>'You may hear something to your advantage.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Very well,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, trying to appear unconcerned. <q>'I'll talk to you
                    later.'</q></p>
            <p>Meanwhile an argument was going on by the fireplace. Mr. <name type="PERSON">Butterbur</name> had come trotting
                in, and he was now trying to lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> to several conflicting accounts of the event at
                the same time.</p>
            <p><q>'I saw him, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Butterbur</name>,'</q> said a hobbit; <q>'or leastways I didn't see him,
                    if you take my meaning. He just vanished into thin air, in a manner of
                    speaking.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'You <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t say, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Mugwort</name>!'</q> said the landlord, looking puzzled.</p>
            <p><q>'Yes I do!'</q> replied <name type="PERSON">Mugwort</name>. <q>'And I mean what I say, what's more.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'There's some mistake somewhere,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Butterbur</name>, shaking his head. There was
                too much of that Mr. <name type="PERSON">Underhill</name> to go vanishing into thin air; or into thick air, as
                is more likely in this room.'</p>
            <p><q>'Well, where is he now?'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed several voices.</p>
            <p>
                <q>'<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w should I know? He's welcome to go where he will, so long as he pays in the
                    <name type="TIME">morning</name>. There's Mr. <name type="PERSON">Took</name>, now: he's not vanished.'</q>
            </p>
            <p><q>'Well, I saw what I saw, and I saw what I didn't,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Mugwort</name>
                obstinately.</p>
            <p><q>'And I say there's some mistake,'</q> repeated <name type="PERSON">Butterbur</name>, picking up the tray and
                gathe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng up the broken crockery.</p>
            <p><q>'Of course there's a mistake!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'I haven't vanished. Here I am!
                    I've just been having a few words with <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> in the comer.'</q></p>
            <p>He came forward into the firelight; but most of the company backed away,_,_ even more
                perturbed than before. They were not in the least satisfied by his explanation that
                he had crawled away quickly under the tables after he had fallen. Most of the
                <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbits and the <name type="ORG">Men</name> of <name type="PERSON">Bree</name> went off then and there in a huff, having no fancy for
                further entertainment that <name type="TIME">evening</name>. <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> or <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> gave <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> a black look and departed
                mutte<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng among themselves. The <name type="ORG">Dwarves</name> and the <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> or <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> strange <name type="ORG">Men</name> that still
                remained got up and said good <name type="TIME">night</name> to the landlord, but not to <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and his
                f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends. Before long no <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> was left but <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>, who sat on, unnoticed, by the
                wall.</p>
            <p>Mr. <name type="PERSON">Butterbur</name> did not seem much put out. He reck<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>d, very probably, that his house
                would be full again on many future <name type="TIME">night</name>s, until the present mystery had been
                thoroughly discussed. <q>'Now what have you been doing, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Underhill</name>?'</q> he
                asked. <q>'F<name type="GPE">ri</name>gh<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing my cus<name type="PERSON">tom</name>ers and breaking up my crocks with your
                    acrobatics!'</q></p>
            <p><q>'I am very sorry to have caused any trouble,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'It was quite
                    unin<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>tional, I assure you. A most unfortunate accident.'</q></p>
            <p>
                <q>'All <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Underhill</name>! But if you're going to do any more tumbling, or
                    conju<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng, or whatever it was, you'd best warn folk beforehand � and warn _me._
                    We're a bit suspicious round here of anything out of the way -uncanny, if you
                    understand me; and we <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t take to it all of a sudden.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>
                <q>'I shan't be doing anything of the sort again, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Butterbur</name>, I promise you. And
                    now I think I'll be getting to bed. We shall be making an early start. Will you
                    see that our ponies are ready by <name type="CARDINAL">eight</name> o'clock?'</q>

            <p>
                <q>'Very good! But before you go, I should like a word with you in p<name type="GPE">ri</name>vate, Mr.
                    <name type="PERSON">Underhill</name>. Something has just come back to my mind that I ought to tell you. I
                    hope that you'll not take it amiss. When I've seen to a thing or <name type="CARDINAL">two</name>, I'll come
                    along to your room, if you're willing.'</q>
            </p>
            <p><q>'Certainly!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>; but his heart sank. He wondered how many p<name type="GPE">ri</name>vate
                talks he would have before he got to bed, and what they would reveal. Were these
                people all in league against him? He began to suspect even old <name type="PERSON">Butterbur</name>'s fat face
                of concealing dark designs.</p>

            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>, and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> made their way back to the parlour. There was no light. <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>
                was not there, and the fire had burned low. It was not until they had puf<name type="ORG">fed</name> up the
                embers into a blaze and thrown on a couple of faggots that they discovered <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>
                had come with them. There he was calmly sitting in a c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>r by the door!</p>
            <p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Hal</name>lo!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q>'Who are you, and what do you <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t?'</q></p>
            <p><q>'I am called <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>,'</q> he answered: <q>'and though he may have forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> it,
                    your f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end promised to have a quiet talk with me.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'You said I might hear something to my advantage, I believe,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.
                    <q>'What have you to say?'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Several things,'</q> answered <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>. <q>'But, of course, I have my
                p<name type="GPE">ri</name>ce.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'What do you mean?'</q> asked <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> sharply.</p>
            <p>
                <q>'<name type="PERSON">Don</name>'t be alarmed! I mean just this: I will tell you what I know, and give you
                    some good advice � but I shall <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t a reward.'</q>
            </p>
            <p><q>'And what will that be, pray?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. He suspected now that he had fallen
                in with a rascal, and he thought uncomfortably that he had brought only a little
                m<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>y with him. All of it would hardly satisfy a rogue, and he could not spare any
                of it.</p>
            <p><q>'No more than you can af<name type="ORG">ford</name>,'</q> answered <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> with a slow smile, as if he
                guessed <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s thoughts. <q>'Just this: you must take me along with you, until I
                    wish to leave you.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Oh, indeed!'</q> replied <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, surp<name type="GPE">ri</name>sed, but not much relieved. <q>'Even if I
                    <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ted another companion, I should not agree to any such thing, until I knew a
                    good deal more about you, and your business.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Excellent!'</q> exclaimed <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>, crossing his legs and sitting back
                comfortably. <q>'You seem to be coming to your senses again, and that is all to the
                    good. You have been much too careless so far. Very well! I will tell you what I
                    know, and leave the reward to you. You may be glad to grant it, when you have
                    heard me.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Go on then!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'What do you know?'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Too much; too many dark things,'</q> said <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> g<name type="GPE">ri</name>mly. <q>'But as for your
                    business -'</q> He got up and went to the door, opened it quickly and looked
                out. Then he shut it quietly and sat down again. <q>'I have quick ears,'</q> he went
                on, lowe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng his voice, <q>'and though I cannot disappear, I have hunted many wild
                    and wary things and I can usually avoid being seen, if I wish. Now, I was behind
                    the hedge this <name type="TIME">evening</name> on the <name type="FAC">Road</name> west of <name type="PERSON">Bree</name>, when <name type="CARDINAL">four</name> hobbits came out of
                    the Downlands. I need not repeat all that they said to old <name type="GPE">Bombadil</name> or to <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>
                    another, but <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> thing interested me. _Please remember,_ said <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of them, _that
                    the name <name type="PERSON">Baggins</name> must not be menti<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>d. I am Mr. <name type="PERSON">Underhill</name>, if any name must be
                    given._ That interested me so much that I followed them here. I slipped over the
                    gate just behind them. <name type="DATE">May</name>be Mr. <name type="PERSON">Baggins</name> has an h<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>st reason for leaving his
                    name behind; but if so, I should advise him and his f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends to be more
                    careful.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t see what interest my name has for any <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> in <name type="PERSON">Bree</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>
                ang<name type="GPE">ri</name>ly, <q>'and I have still to learn why it interests you. Mr. <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> may have an
                    h<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>st reason for spying and eavesdropping; but if so, I should advise him to
                    explain it.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Well answered!'</q> said <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> laughing. 'But the explanation is simple:</p>
            <p>I was looking for a <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbit called <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> <name type="PERSON">Baggins</name>. I <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ted to find him quickly. I had
                learned that he was carrying out of the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>, well, a <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret that concerned me and
                my f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends.</p>
            <p><q>'Now, <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t mistake me!'</q> he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed, as <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> rose from his seat, and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> jumped
                up with a scowl. <q>'I shall take more care of the <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret than you do. And care is
                    needed!'</q> He leaned forward and looked at them. <q>'Watch every shadow!'</q>
                he said in a low voice. <q>'<name type="ORG">Black</name> horsemen have passed through <name type="PERSON">Bree</name>. On <name type="DATE">Mon<name type="DATE">day</name></name> <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>
                    came down the <name type="FAC">Greenway</name>, they say; and another appeared later, coming up the
                    <name type="FAC">Greenway</name> from the south.'</q></p>
            <p>There was a silence. At last <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> spoke to <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>: <q>'I ought to have
                    guessed it from the way the gatekeeper greeted us,'</q> he said. <q>'And the
                    landlord seems to have heard something. Why did he press us to join the company?
                    And why on <name type="LOC">earth</name> did we behave so foolishly: we ought to have stayed quiet in
                    here.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'It would have been better,'</q> said <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>. <q>'I would have stopped your going
                    into the common-room, if I could; but the innkeeper would not let me in to see
                    you, or take a message.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Do you think he���'</q> began <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.</p>
            <p><q>'No, I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t think any harm of old <name type="PERSON">Butterbur</name>. Only he does not altogether like
                    myste<name type="GPE">ri</name>ous vagabonds of my sort.'</q> <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> gave him a puzzled look. <q>'Well, I
                    have rather a rascally look, have I not?'</q> said <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> with a curl of his
                lip and a queer gleam in his eye. <q>'But I hope we shall get to know <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> another
                    better. When we do, I hope you will explain what happened at the end of your
                    song. For that little prank���'</q></p>
            <p><q>'It was sheer accident!'</q> interrupted <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.</p>
            <p><q>'I wonder,'</q> said <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>. <q>'Accident, then. That accident has made your
                    position dangerous.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Hardly more than it was already,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'I knew these horsemen were
                    pursuing me; but now at any rate they seem to have missed me and to have g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>
                    away.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'You must not count on that!'</q> said <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> sharply. <q>'They will return. And
                    more are coming. There are others. I know their number. I know these
                    <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s.'</q> He paused, and his eyes were cold and hard. <q>'And there are some
                    folk in <name type="PERSON">Bree</name> who are not to be trusted,'</q> he went on. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Bill</name> <name type="PERSON">Ferny</name>, for
                    instance. He has an evil name in the <name type="PERSON">Bree</name>-land, and queer folk call at his
                    house. You must have noticed him among the company: a <name type="PERSON">swart</name>hy snee<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng fellow.
                    He was very close with <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the <name type="LOC">South</name>ern strangers, and they slipped out
                    together just after your "accident". Not all of those <name type="LOC">South</name>erners mean well; and
                    as for <name type="PERSON">Ferny</name>, he would sell anything to anybody; or make mischief for
                    amusement.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'What will <name type="PERSON">Ferny</name> sell, and what has my accident got to do with him?'</q> said
                <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, still determined not to understand <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>'s hints.</p>
            <p><q>'News of you, of course,'</q> answered <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>. <q>'An account of your performance
                    would be very interesting to certain people. After that they would hardly need
                    to be told your real name. It seems to me only too likely that they will hear of
                    it before this <name type="TIME">night</name> is over. Is that enough? You can do as you like about my
                    reward: take me as a guide or not. But I may say that I know all the lands
                    between the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> and the <name type="LOC">Misty <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s</name>, for I have <name type="PERSON">wan</name>dered over them for
                    <name type="DATE">many <name type="DATE">year</name>s</name>. I am older than I look. I might prove useful. You will have to leave
                    the open road after to<name type="TIME">night</name>; for the horsemen will watch it <name type="TIME">night</name> and <name type="DATE">day</name>. You
                    may escape from <name type="PERSON">Bree</name>, and be allowed to go forward while the <name type="ORG">Sun</name> is up; but you
                    won't go far. They will come on you in the wild, in some dark place where there
                    is no help. Do you wish them to find you? They are ter<name type="GPE">ri</name>ble!'</q></p>
            <p>The hobbits looked at him, and saw with surp<name type="GPE">ri</name>se that his face was drawn as if with
                pain, and his hands clenched the arms of his c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>r. The room was very quiet and
                still, and the light seemed to have grown dim. For a while he sat with unseeing eyes
                as if walking in distant memory or lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing to sounds in the Night far away.</p>
            <p><q>'There!'</q> he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed after a moment, drawing his hand across his brow.
                    <q>'Perhaps I know more about these pursuers than you do. You fear them, but you
                    do not fear them enough, yet. <name type="PERSON">Tom</name>orrow you will have to escape, if you can.
                    <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> can take you by paths that are seldom trodden. Will you have
                him?'</q></p>
            <p>There was a heavy silence. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> made no answer, his mind was confused with doubt and
                fear. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> frowned, and looked at his master; and at last he broke out:</p>
            <p>
                <q>'With your leave, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, I'd say no! This <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> here, he warns and he says
                    take care; and I _say yes_ to that, and let's begin with him. He comes out of
                    the Wild, and I never heard no good of such folk. He knows something, that's
                    plain, and more than I like; but it's no reason why we should let him go leading
                    us out into some dark place far from help, as he puts it.'</q>
            </p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> fidgeted and looked uncomfortable. <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> did not reply to <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, but turned
                his keen eyes on <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> caught his glance and looked away. <q>'No,'</q> he
                said slowly. <q>'I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t agree. I think, I think you are not really as you choose to
                    look. You began to talk to me like the <name type="PERSON">Bree</name>-folk, but your voice has changed.
                    Still <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> seems <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght in this: I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t see why you should warn us to take care,
                    and yet ask us to take you on trust. Why the disguise? Who are you? What do you
                    really know about � about my business; and how do you know it?'</q></p>
            <p><q>'The lesson in caution has been well learned,'</q> said <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> with a g<name type="GPE">ri</name>m smile.
                    <q>'But caution is <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> thing and wave<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng is another. You will never get to
                    <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name> now on your own, and to trust me is your only chance. You must make up
                    your mind. I will answer some of your questions, if that will help you to do so.
                    But why should you believe my story, if you do not trust me already? Still here
                    it is���'</q></p>
            <p>At that moment there came a knock at the door. Mr. <name type="PERSON">Butterbur</name> had ar<name type="GPE">ri</name>ved with
                candles, and behind him was <name type="PERSON">Nob</name> with cans of hot water. <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> withdrew into a dark
                corner.</p>
            <p><q>'I've come to bid you good <name type="TIME">night</name>,'</q> said the landlord, putting the candles on
                the table. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Nob</name>! Take the water to the rooms!'</q> He came in and shut the
                door.</p>
            <p><q>'It's like this,'</q> he began, hesitating and looking troubled. <q>'If I've <name type="PERSON">don</name>e
                    any harm, I'm sorry indeed. But <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> thing d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ves out another, as you'll admit;
                    and I'm a busy man. But <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> thing and then <name type="DATE">another this <name type="DATE">week</name></name> have jogged
                    my memory, as the saying goes; and not too late I hope. You see, I was asked to
                    look out for hobbits of the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>, and for <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> by the name of <name type="PERSON">Baggins</name> in
                    particular.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'And what has that got to do with me?'</q> asked <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.</p>
            <p><q>'Ah! you know best,'</q> said the landlord, knowingly. <q>'I won't give you away;
                    but I was told that this <name type="PERSON">Baggins</name> would be going by the name of <name type="PERSON">Underhill</name>, and I
                    was given a desc<name type="GPE">ri</name>ption that fits you well enough, if I may say so.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Indeed! Let's have it then!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, unwisely interrupting.</p>
            <p>_'A stout little fellow with red cheeks,<q>'_ said Mr. <name type="PERSON">Butterbur</name> solemnly. <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>
                    chuckled, but <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> looked indignant. _'That won't help you much; it goes for most
                    hobbits. <name type="ORG">Barley</name>,_ he says to me,'</q> continued Mr. <name type="PERSON">Butterbur</name> with a glance at
                <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. _'But this <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> is taller than some and fairer than most, and he has a cleft

            <p>_'He_ said it? And who was he?' asked <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> eagerly.</p>
            <p>'Ah! That was <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, if you know who I mean. A wizard they say he is, but he's a
                good f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end of mine, whether or no. But now I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t know what he'll have to say to
                me, if I see him again: turn all my ale sour or me into a block of wood, I shouldn't
                wonder. He's a bit hasty. Still what's <name type="PERSON">don</name>e can't be un<name type="PERSON">don</name>e. '</p>
            <p><q>'Well, what have you <name type="PERSON">don</name>e?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, getting impatient with the slow
                unravelling of <name type="PERSON">Butterbur</name>'s thoughts.</p>
            <p><q>'Where was I?'</q> said the landlord, pausing and snapping his fingers. 'Ah, yes!
                Old <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <name type="PERSON">Thr</name>ee <name type="DATE">months</name> back he walked <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght into my room without a knock.
                _<name type="ORG">Barley</name>,_ he says, _I'm off in the <name type="TIME">morning</name>. Will you do something for me? You've
                only to name it,_ I said. _I'm in a hurry,_ said he, _and I've no time myself, but I
                <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t a message took to the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>. Have you any<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> you can send, and trust to go? I
                can find some<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>,_ I said, _to<name type="DATE">morrow</name>, maybe, or the <name type="DATE">day</name> after. Make it to<name type="DATE">morrow</name>,_ he
                says, and then he gave me a letter.</p>
            <p><q>'It's addressed plain enough,'</q> said Mr. <name type="PERSON">Butterbur</name>, producing a letter from his
                pocket, and reading out the address slowly and proudly (he valued his reputation as
                a lettered man):</p>
            <p>_Mr. <name type="PERSON">FRODO BAGGINS</name>, BAG END, HOBBITON in the SHIRE._</p>
            <p><q>'A letter for me from <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.</p>
            <p><q>'Ah!'</q> said Mr. <name type="PERSON">Butterbur</name>. <q>'Then your <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght name is <name type="PERSON">Baggins</name>?'</q></p>
            <p><q>'It is,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, <q>'and you had better give me that letter at once, and
                    explain why you never sent it. That's what you came to tell me, I suppose,
                    though you've taken a long time to come to the point.'</q></p>
            <p>Poor Mr. <name type="PERSON">Butterbur</name> looked troubled. <q>'You're <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght, master,'</q> he said, 'and I
                beg your par<name type="PERSON">don</name>. And I'm mortal afraid of what <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> will say, if harm comes of
                it. But I didn't keep it back a-purpose. I put it by safe. Then I couldn't find
                nobody willing to go to the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> next <name type="DATE">day</name>, nor the <name type="DATE">day</name> after, and n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of my own
                folk were to spare; and then <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> thing after another drove it out of my mind. I'm a
                busy man. I'll do what I can to set matters <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght, and if there's any help I can
                give, you've only to name it.</p>
            <p>
                <q>'Leaving the letter aside, I promised <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> no less. _<name type="ORG">Barley</name>,_ he says to me,
                    _this f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end of mine from the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>, he may be coming out this way before long,
                    him and another. He'll be calling himself <name type="PERSON">Underhill</name>. Mind that! But you need ask
                    no questions. And if I'm not with him, he may be in trouble, and he may need
                    help. Do whatever you can for him, and I'll be grateful,_ he says. And here you
                    are, and trouble is not far off, seemingly.'</q>
            </p>
            <p><q>'What do you mean?'</q> asked <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.</p>
            <p><q>'These black men,'</q> said the landlord lowe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng his voice. <q>'They're looking
                    for _<name type="PERSON">Baggins</name>,_ and if they mean well, then I'm a hobbit. It was on <name type="DATE">Mon<name type="DATE">day</name></name>, and
                    all the dogs were yamme<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng and the geese screaming. <name type="PERSON">Uncanny</name>, I called it. <name type="PERSON">Nob</name>,
                    he came and told me that <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> black men were at the door asking for a hobbit
                    called <name type="PERSON">Baggins</name>. <name type="PERSON">Nob</name>'s <name type="PERSON">hai</name>r was all stood on end. I bid the black fellows be off,
                    and slammed the door on them; but they've been asking the same question all the
                    way to <name type="PERSON">Archet</name>, I hear. And that <name type="PRODUCT">Ranger</name>, <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>, he's been asking questions,
                    too. T<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed to get in here to see you, before you'd had bite or sup, he
                did.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'He did!'</q> said <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> suddenly, coming forward into the light. <q>'And much
                    trouble would have been saved, if you had let him in, <name type="PERSON">Barliman</name>.'</q></p>
            <p>The landlord jumped with surp<name type="GPE">ri</name>se. <q>'You!'</q> he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed. <q>'You're always popping
                    up. What do you <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t now?'</q></p>
            <p><q>'He's here with my leave,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'He came to offer me his
                help.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Well, you know your own business, maybe,'</q> said Mr. <name type="PERSON">Butterbur</name>, looking
                suspiciously at <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>. <q>'But if I was in your plight, I wouldn't take up with a
                    <name type="PRODUCT">Ranger</name>.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Then who would you take up with?'</q> asked <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>. <q>'A fat innkeeper who only
                    remembers his own name because people shout it at him <name type="DATE">all <name type="DATE">day</name></name>? They cannot stay
                    in _The Pony_ for ever, and they cannot go home. They have a long road before
                    them. Will you go with them and keep the black men off?'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Me? Leave <name type="PERSON">Bree</name>! I wouldn't do that for any m<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>y,'</q> said Mr. <name type="PERSON">Butterbur</name>,
                looking really scared. <q>'But why can't you stay here quiet for a bit, Mr.
                    <name type="PERSON">Underhill</name>? What are all these queer goings on? What are these black men after,
                    and where do they come from, I'd like to know?'</q></p>
            <p><q>'I'm sorry I can't explain it all,'</q> answered <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'I am tired and very
                    wor<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed, and it's a long tale. But if you mean to help me, I ought to warn you
                    that you will be in danger as long as I am in your house. These <name type="ORG">Black</name> <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s: I
                    am not sure, but I think, I fear they come from���'</q></p>
            <p><q>'They come from <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>,'</q> said <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> in a low voice. <q>'From <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>,
                    <name type="PERSON">Barliman</name>, if that means anything to you.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Save us!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed Mr. <name type="PERSON">Butterbur</name> turning pale; the name evidently was known to
                him. <q>'That is the worst news that has come to <name type="PERSON">Bree</name> in my time.'</q>
                <q>'It is,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'Are you still willing to help me?'</q>
                <q>'I am,'</q> said Mr. <name type="PERSON">Butterbur</name>. <q>'More than ever. Though I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t know what the
                    likes of me can do against, against���'</q> he faltered.</p>
            <p><q>'Against the <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name> in the <name type="LOC">East</name>,'</q> said <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> quietly. <q>'Not much,
                    <name type="PERSON">Barliman</name>, but every little helps. You can let Mr. <name type="PERSON">Underhill</name> stay here to<name type="TIME">night</name>,
                    as Mr. <name type="PERSON">Underhill</name>, and you can forget the name of <name type="PERSON">Baggins</name>, till he is far
                    away.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'I'll do that,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Butterbur</name>. <q>'But they'll find out he's here without
                    help from me, I'm afraid. It's a pity Mr. <name type="PERSON">Baggins</name> drew at<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>tion to himself this
                    <name type="TIME">evening</name>, to say no more. The story of that Mr. <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>'s going off has been heard
                    before to<name type="TIME">night</name> in <name type="PERSON">Bree</name>. Even our <name type="PERSON">Nob</name> has been doing some guessing in his slow
                    pate: and there are others in <name type="PERSON">Bree</name> quicker in the uptake than he is.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Well, we can only hope the <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s won't come back yet,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.</p>
            <p><q>'I hope not, indeed,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Butterbur</name>. <q>'But spooks or no spooks, they won't
                    get in _The <name type="ORG">Pony_so</name> easy. <name type="PERSON">Don</name>'t you worry till the <name type="TIME">morning</name>. <name type="PERSON">Nob</name>'ll say no word.
                    No black man shall pass my doors, while I can stand on my legs. Me and my
                    folk'll keep watch to<name type="TIME">night</name>; but you had best get some sleep, if you
                can.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'In any case we must be called at <name type="TIME">dawn</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'We must get off as
                    early as possible. Breakfast at <name type="CARDINAL">six</name>-<name type="CARDINAL">thirty</name>, please.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Right! I'll see to the orders,'</q> said the landlord. <q>'<name type="TIME">Good <name type="TIME">night</name></name>, Mr.
                    <name type="PERSON">Baggins</name> � <name type="PERSON">Underhill</name>, I should say! <name type="TIME">Good <name type="TIME">night</name></name> � now, bless me! Where's your Mr.
                    <name type="ORG">Brand</name>ybuck?'</q></p>
            <p><q>'I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t know,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> with sudden anxiety. They had forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> all about
                <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>, and it was getting late. <q>'I am afraid he is out. He said something about
                    going for a breath of air.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Well, you do <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t looking after and no mistake: your party might be on a
                    holi<name type="DATE">day</name>!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Butterbur</name>. <q>'I must go and bar the doors quick, but I'll
                    see your f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end is let in when he comes. I'd better send <name type="PERSON">Nob</name> to look for him.
                    <name type="TIME">Good <name type="TIME">night</name></name> to you all!'</q> At last Mr. <name type="PERSON">Butterbur</name> went out, with another
                doubtful look at <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> and a shake of his head. His footsteps retreated down the
                passage.</p>
            <p><q>'Well?'</q> said <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>. <q>'When are you going to open that letter?'</q> <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>
                looked carefully at the seal before he broke it. It seemed certainly to be
                <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>'s. Inside, w<name type="GPE">ri</name>t<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> in the wizard's strong but graceful sc<name type="GPE">ri</name>pt, was the
                following message:</p>

            <p>_Dear <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>,_</p>
            <p>_Bad news has reached me here. I must go off at once. You had better leave <name type="FAC">Bag End</name>
                soon, and get out of the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> before <name type="DATE">the end of July</name> at latest. I will return as
                soon as I can; and I will follow you, if I find that you are g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. Leave a message
                for me here, if you pass through <name type="PERSON">Bree</name>. You can trust the landlord (<name type="PERSON">Butterbur</name>). You

            <p>_Yours in haste_</p>
            <p>_GANDALF_.</p>

            <p>_PPS. Make sure that it is the real <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>. There are many strange men on the roads.

            <p>_PPPS. I hope <name type="PERSON">Butterbur</name> sends this promptly. A worthy man, but his memory is like a

            <p>_<name type="LOC">Far</name>e Well!_</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> read the letter to himself, and then passed it to <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <q>'Really
                    old <name type="PERSON">Butterbur</name> has made a mess of things!'</q> he said. <q>'He deserves roasting.
                    If I had got this at once, we might all have been safe in <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name> by now. But
                    what can have happened to <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>? He w<name type="GPE">ri</name>tes as if he was going into great
                    danger.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'He has been doing that for <name type="DATE">many <name type="DATE">year</name>s</name>,'</q> said <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> turned and looked at him thoughtfully, wonde<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng about <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>'s <name type="ORG">sec</name>ond
                postsc<name type="GPE">ri</name>pt. <q>'Why didn't you tell me that you were <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>'s f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end at once?'</q>
                he asked. <q>'It would have saved time.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Would it? Would any of you have believed me till now?'</q> said <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>. <q>'I
                    knew nothing of this letter. For all I knew I had to persuade you to trust me
                    without proofs, if I was to help you. In any case, I did not in<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>d to tell you
                    all about myself at once. I had to study _you_ <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>, and make sure of you. The
                    Enemy has set traps for me before now. As soon as I had made up my mind, I was
                    ready to tell you whatever you asked. But I must admit,'</q> he added with a
                queer laugh, <q>'that I hoped you would take to me for my own sake. A hunted man
                    sometimes wea<name type="GPE">ri</name>es of distrust and longs for f<name type="GPE">ri</name>endship. But there, I believe my

            <p><q>'They are � at <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> sight at any rate,'</q> laughed <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> with sudden relief
                after reading <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>'s letter. <q>'But handsome is as handsome does, as we say in
                    the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>; and I daresay we shall all look much the same after lying for <name type="DATE">day</name>s in

            <p><q>'It would take more than a few <name type="DATE">day</name>s, or <name type="DATE">week</name>s, or <name type="DATE">year</name>s, of <name type="PERSON">wan</name>de<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng in the Wild
                    to make you look like <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>,'</q> he answered. <q>'And you would die <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>,
                    unless you are made of sterner stuff than you look to be.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> subsided; but <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> was not daunted, and he still eyed <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> dubiously.
                    <q>'<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w do we know you are the <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> that <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> speaks about?'</q> he
                demanded. <q>'You never menti<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>d <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, till this letter came out. You might be a
                    play-acting spy, for all I can see, trying to get us to go with you. You might
                    have <name type="PERSON">don</name>e in the real <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> and took his clothes. What have you to say to
                    that?'</q></p>
            <p><q>'That you are a stout fellow,'</q> answered <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>; <q>'but I am afraid my only
                    answer to you, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> <name type="PERSON">Gamgee</name>, is this. If I had killed the real <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>, I could
                    kill you. And I should have killed you already without so much talk. If I was
                    after the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>, I could have it � NOW!'</q></p>
            <p>He stood up, and seemed suddenly to grow taller. In his eyes gleamed a light, keen
                and commanding. <name type="PERSON">Thr</name>owing back his cloak, he laid his hand on the hilt of a sword
                that had hung concealed by his side. They did not dare to move. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> sat wide-mouthed
                sta<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng at him dumbly.</p>
            <p><q>'But I _am_ the real <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>, fortunately,'</q> he said, looking down at them with
                his face sof<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed by a sudden smile. <q>'I am <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> son of <name type="ORG">Arathorn</name>; and if by
                    life or death I can save you, I will.'</q></p>
            <p>There was a long silence. At last <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> spoke with hesitation. <q>'I believed that
                    you were a f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end before the letter came,'</q> he said, <q>'or at least I wished
                    to. You have f<name type="GPE">ri</name>gh<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed me several times to<name type="TIME">night</name>, but never in the way that
                    servants of the Enemy would, or so I imagine. I think <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of his spies would �
                    well, seem fairer and feel fouler, if you understand.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'I see,'</q> laughed <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>. <q>'I look foul and feel fair. Is that it? _All that
                    is gold does not glitter, not all those who <name type="PERSON">wan</name>der are lost.'</q>_</p>
            <p><q>'Did the verses apply to you then?'</q> asked <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'I could not make out what
                    they were about. But how did you know that they were in <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>'s letter, if you
                    have never seen it?'</q></p>
            <p><q>'I did not know,'</q> he answered. <q>'But I am <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>, and those verses go with
                    that name.'</q> He drew out his sword, and they saw that the blade was indeed
                broken a foot below the hilt. <q>'Not much use is it, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>?'</q> said <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>.
                    <q>'But the time is near when it shall be forged anew.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> said nothing.</p>
            <p><q>'Well,'</q> said <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>, <q>'with <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>'s permission we will call that settled.
                    <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> shall be your guide. We shall have a rough road to<name type="DATE">morrow</name>. Even if we are
                    allowed to leave <name type="PERSON">Bree</name> unhindered, we can hardly hope now to leave it unnoticed.
                    But I shall try to get lost as soon as possible. I know <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> or <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> ways out of
                    <name type="PERSON">Bree</name>-land other than the main road. If once we shake off the pursuit, I shall
                    make for <name type="ORG">Weathertop</name>.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'<name type="ORG">Weathertop</name>?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <q>'What's that?'</q></p>
            <p>
                <q>'It is a hill, just to the north of the <name type="FAC">Road</name>, <name type="CARDINAL">about <name type="CARDINAL">half</name></name> way from here to
                    <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name>. It commands a wide view all round; and there we shall have a chance
                    to look about us. <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> will make for that point, if he follows us. After
                    <name type="ORG">Weathertop</name> our journey will become more difficult, and we shall have to choose
                    between va<name type="GPE">ri</name>ous dangers.'</q>
            </p>
            <p><q>'When did you last see <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>?'</q> asked <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'Do you know where he is, or
                    what he is doing?'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> looked grave. <q>'I do not know,'</q> he said. 'I came west with him in the
                sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng. I have of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> kept watch on the borders of the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> in <name type="DATE">the last few <name type="DATE">year</name>s</name>,
                when he was busy elsewhere. He seldom left it unguarded. We last met on the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> of
                <name type="DATE">May</name>: at <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> <name type="ORG">Ford</name> down the <name type="ORG">Brand</name>ywine. He told me that his business with you had g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>
                well, and that you would be starting for <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name> in the last <name type="DATE">week</name> of <name type="DATE">September</name>. As
                I knew he was at your side, I went away on a journey of my own. And that has proved
                ill; for plainly some news reached him, and I was not at hand to help.</p>
            <p>
                <q>'I am troubled, for the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> time since I have known him. We should have had
                    messages, even if he could not come himself. When I returned, m<name type="DATE">any <name type="DATE">day</name></name>s ago, I
                    heard the ill news. The tidings had g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> far and wide that <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> was missing
                    and the horsemen had been seen. It was the <name type="ORG">Elven</name>-folk of <name type="PERSON">Gildor</name> that told me
                    this; and later they told me that you had left your home; but there was no news
                    of your leaving <name type="PERSON">Buckland</name>. I have been wat<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g the <name type="LOC">East</name> <name type="FAC">Road</name> anxiously.'</q>
            </p>
            <p><q>'Do you think the <name type="ORG">Black</name> <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s have anything to do with it � with <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>'s
                    absence, I mean?'</q> asked <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.</p>
            <p><q>'I do not know of anything else that could have hindered him, except the Enemy
                    himself,'</q> said <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>. <q>'But do not give up hope! <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> is greater than
                    you <name type="LOC">Shire</name>-folk know � as a rule you can only see his jokes and toys. But this
                    business of ours will be his greatest task.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> yawned. <q>'I am sorry,'</q> he said, <q>'but I am dead tired. In spite of all
                    the danger and worry I must go to bed, or sleep where I sit. Where is that silly
                    fellow, <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>? It would be the last straw, if we had to go out in the dark to
                    look for him.'</q></p>
            <p>At that moment they heard a door slam; then feet came running along the passage.
                <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> came in with a rush followed by <name type="PERSON">Nob</name>. He shut the door hastily, and leaned
                against it. He was out of breath. They stared at him in alarm for a moment before he
                gasped: <q>'I have seen them, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>! I have seen them! <name type="ORG">Black</name> <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s!'</q></p>
            <p><q>'<name type="ORG">Black</name> <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'Where?'</q></p>
            <p>
                <q>'Here. In the village. I stayed indoors for <name type="TIME">an <name type="TIME">hour</name></name>. Then as you did not come
                    back, I went out for a stroll. I had come back again and was standing just
                    outside the light of the lamp looking at the stars. Suddenly I shivered and felt
                    that something hor<name type="GPE">ri</name>ble was creeping near: there was a son of deeper shade among
                    the shadows across the road, just beyond the edge of the lamplight. It slid away
                    at once into the dark without a sound. There was no horse.'</q>
            </p>
            <p><q>'Which way did it go?'</q> asked <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>, suddenly and sharply. <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> started,
                noticing the stranger for the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> time. <q>'Go on!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'This is a
                    f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end of <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>'s. I will explain later.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'It seemed to make off up the <name type="FAC">Road</name>, eastward,'</q> continued <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'I t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed to
                    follow. Of course, it vanished almost at once; but I went round the corner and
                    on as far as the last house on the <name type="FAC">Road</name>.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> looked at <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> with wonder. <q>'You have a stout heart,'</q> he said;
                    <q>'but it was foolish.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t know,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'Neither brave nor silly, I think. I could
                    hardly help myself. I seemed to be drawn somehow. Anyway, I went, and suddenly I
                    heard voices by the hedge. <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> was mutte<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng; and the other was whispe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng, or
                    hissing. I couldn't hear a word that was said. I did not creep any closer,
                    because I began to tremble all over. Then I felt ter<name type="GPE">ri</name>fied, and I turned back,
                    and was just going to bolt home, when something came behind me and I... I fell
                    over.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'I found him, sir,'</q> put in <name type="PERSON">Nob</name>. <q>'Mr. <name type="PERSON">Butterbur</name> sent me out with a lantern.
                    I went down to <name type="LOC">West</name>-gate, and then back <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name>wards <name type="LOC">South</name>-gate. Just nigh <name type="PERSON">Bill</name>
                    <name type="PERSON">Ferny</name>'s house I thought I could see something in the <name type="FAC">Road</name>. I couldn't swear to
                    it, but it looked to me as if <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> men was stooping over something, lilting it. I
                    gave a shout, but where I got <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name> the spot there was no signs of them, and
                    only Mr. <name type="ORG">Brand</name>ybuck lying by the roadside. He seemed to be asleep. "I thought I
                    had fallen into deep water," he says to me, when I shook him. Very queer he was,
                    and as soon as I had roused him, he got up and ran back here like a
                hare.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'I am afraid that's true,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>, <q>'though I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t know what I said. I
                    had an ugly dream, which I can't remember. I went to pieces. I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t know what
                    came over me.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'I do,'</q> said <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>. <q>'The <name type="ORG">Black</name> Breath. The <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s must have left their
                    horses outside, and passed back through the <name type="LOC">South</name>-gate in <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret. They will know
                    all the news now, for they have visited <name type="PERSON">Bill</name> <name type="PERSON">Ferny</name>; and probably that <name type="LOC">South</name>erner
                    was a spy as well. Something may happen in the <name type="TIME">night</name>, before we leave
                <name type="PERSON">Bree</name>.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'What will happen?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'Will they attack the inn?'</q>
                <q>'No, I think not,'</q> said <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>. <q>'They are not all here yet. And in any
                    case that is not their way. In dark and l<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>liness they are strongest; they will
                    not openly attack a house where there are lights and many people -not until they
                    are desperate, not while all the long leagues of <name type="ORG">E<name type="GPE">ri</name>ador</name> still lie before us.
                    But their power is in terror, and already some in <name type="PERSON">Bree</name> are in their clutch. They
                    will d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ve these wretches to some evil work: <name type="PERSON">Ferny</name>, and some of the strangers,
                    and, maybe, the gatekeeper too. They had words with <name type="PERSON">Harry</name> at <name type="LOC">West</name>-gate on
                    <name type="DATE">Mon<name type="DATE">day</name></name>. I was wat<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g them. He was white and shaking when they left
                him.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'We seem to have enemies all round,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'What are we to
                do?'</q></p>
            <p>
                <q>'Stay here, and do not go to your rooms! They are sure to have found out which
                    those are. The hobbit-rooms have windows looking north and close to the ground.
                    We will all remain together and bar this window and the door. But <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> <name type="PERSON">Nob</name> and

            <p>While <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> was g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> gave <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> a rapid account of all that had happened
                since supper. <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> was still reading and ponde<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>'s letter when <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>
                and <name type="PERSON">Nob</name> returned.</p>
            <p><q>'<name type="ORG">Well Masters</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Nob</name>, <q>'I've ruffled up the clothes and put in a bolster
                    down the middle of each bed. And I made a nice imitation of your head with a

            <p><name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> laughed. <q>'Very life-like!'</q> he said. <q>'But what will happen when they
                    have penetrated the disguise?'</q></p>
            <p><q>'We shall see,'</q> said <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>. <q>'Let us hope to hold the fort till

            <p><q>'<name type="TIME">Good <name type="TIME">night</name></name> to you,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Nob</name>, and went off to take his part in the watch on
                the doors.</p>
            <p>Their bags and gear they piled on the parlour-floor. They pushed a low c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>r against
                the door and shut the window. Pee<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng out, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> saw that the <name type="TIME">night</name> was still clear.
                The Sickle was swinging b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght above the shoulders of <name type="PERSON">Bree</name>-hill. He then closed and
                barred the heavy inside shutters and drew the curtains together. <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> built up
                the fire and blew out all the candles.</p>
            <p>The hobbits lay down on their blankets with their feet towards the h<name type="LOC">earth</name>; but
                <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> settled himself in the c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>r against the door. They talked for a little, for
                <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> still had several questions to ask.</p>
            <p><q>'Jumped over the <name type="PERSON">Moon</name>!'</q> chuckled <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> as he rolled himself in his blanket.
                    <q>'Very <name type="GPE">ri</name>diculous of you, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>! But I wish I had been there to see. The

            <p><q>'I hope so,'</q> said <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>. Then they all fell silent, and <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> by <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> the

                strayed in the <name type="ORG">dell</name>s and along the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver-bank. The house at <name type="ORG">C<name type="GPE">ri</name>ckhollow</name> stood
                silent. <name type="PERSON">Fatty</name> <name type="PERSON">Bolger</name> opened the door cautiously and peered out. A feeling of fear
                had been growing on him <name type="DATE">all <name type="DATE">day</name></name>, and he was unable to rest or go to bed: there was a
                brooding threat in the breathless <name type="TIME">night</name>-air. As he stared out into the gloom, a
                black shadow moved under the trees; the gate seemed to open of its own accord and
                close again without a sound. Terror seized him. He shrank back, and for a moment he
                stood trembling in the hall. Then he shut and locked the door.</p>
            <p><name type="TIME">The <name type="TIME">night</name></name> deepened. There came the soft sound of horses led with stealth along the
                lane. Outside the gate they stopped, and <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> black figures entered, like shades of
                <name type="TIME">night</name> creeping across the ground. <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> went to the door, <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> to the corner of the
                house on either side; and there they stood, as still as the shadows of st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s, while
                <name type="TIME">night</name> went slowly on. The house and the quiet trees seemed to be waiting
                breathlessly.</p>
            <p>There was a faint stir in the leaves, and a cock crowed far away. The cold <name type="TIME">hour</name>
                before <name type="TIME">dawn</name> was passing. The figure by the door moved. In the dark without moon or
                stars a drawn blade gleamed, as if a chill light had been unsheathed. There was a
                blow, soft but heavy, and the door shuddered.</p>
            <p><q>'Open, in the name of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>!'</q> said a voice thin and menacing.</p>
            <p>At a <name type="ORG">sec</name>ond blow the door yielded and fell back, with timbers burst and lock broken.
                The black figures passed swiftly in.</p>
            <p>At that moment, among the trees nearby, a horn rang out. It rent the <name type="TIME">night</name> like fire
                on a hill-top.</p>
            <p><name type="ORG">AWAKE</name>! FEAR! FIRE! FOES! <name type="ORG">AWAKE</name>!</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Fatty</name> <name type="PERSON">Bolger</name> had not been idle. As soon as he saw the dark shapes creep from the
                garden, he knew that he must run for it, or pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>sh. And run he did, out of the back
                door, through the garden, and over the fields. When he reached the nearest house,
                more than <name type="QUANTITY">a mile</name> away, he collapsed on the doorstep. <q>'No, no, no!'</q> he was
                crying. <q>'No, not me! I haven't got it!'</q> It was some time before any<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> could
                make out what he was babbling about. At last they got the idea that enemies were in
                <name type="PERSON">Buckland</name>, some strange invasion from the Old <name type="ORG">Forest</name>. And then they lost no more
                time.</p>
            <p>FEAR! FIRE! FOES!</p>
            <p>The <name type="ORG">Brand</name>ybucks were blowing the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>rn-call of <name type="PERSON">Buckland</name>, that had not been sounded for
                <name type="CARDINAL">a <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name></name> <name type="DATE">year</name>s, not since the white wolves came in the Fell <name type="DATE">Winter</name>, when the
                <name type="ORG">Brand</name>ywine was frozen over.</p>
            <p><name type="ORG">AWAKE</name>! <name type="ORG">AWAKE</name>!</p>
            <p><name type="LOC">Far</name>-away answe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng horns were heard. The alarm was spreading. The black figures fled
                from the house. <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> of them let fall a hobbit-cloak on the step, as he ran. In the
                lane the noise of hoofs broke out, and gathe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng to a gallop, went hamme<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng away
                into the darkness. All about <name type="ORG">C<name type="GPE">ri</name>ckhollow</name> there was the sound of horns blowing, and
                voices crying and feet running. But the <name type="ORG">Black</name> <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s rode like a gale to the
                <name type="LOC">North</name>-gate. Let the little people blow! <name type="ORG">Sauron</name> would deal with them later. Meanwhile
                they had another errand: they knew now that the house was empty and the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> had
                g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. They rode down the guards at the gate and vanished from the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>.</p>
            <p>In the <name type="TIME">early <name type="TIME">night</name></name> <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> woke from deep sleep, suddenly, as if some sound or presence
                had disturbed him. He saw that <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> was sitting alert in his c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>r: his eyes
                gleamed in the light of the fire, which had been <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ded and was burning b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ghtly;
                but he made no sign or movement.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> soon went to sleep again; but his dreams were again troubled with the noise of
                wind and of galloping hoofs. The wind seemed to be curling round the house and
                shaking it; and far off he heard a horn blowing wildly. He opened his eyes, and
                heard a cock crowing lustily in the inn-yard. <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> had drawn the curtains and
                pushed back the shutters with a clang. The <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> grey light of <name type="DATE">day</name> was in the room,
                and a cold air was coming through the open window.</p>
            <p>As soon as <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> had roused them all, he led the way to their bedrooms. When they
                saw them they were glad that they had taken his advice: the windows had been forced
                open and were swinging, and the curtains were flapping; the beds were tossed about,
                and the bolsters slashed and flung upon the floor; the brown mat was torn to
                pieces.</p>
            <p><name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> immediately went to fetch the landlord. Poor Mr. <name type="PERSON">Butterbur</name> looked sleepy and
                f<name type="GPE">ri</name>gh<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed. He had hardly closed his eyes <name type="TIME">all <name type="TIME">night</name></name> (so he said), but he had never
                heard a sound.</p>
            <p><q>'Never has such a thing happened in my time!'</q> he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed, raising his hands in
                horror. <q>'Guests unable to sleep in their beds, and good bolsters ruined and all!
                    What are we coming to?'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Dark times,'</q> said <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>. <q>'But for the present you may be left in peace,
                    when you have got <name type="GPE">ri</name>d of us. We will leave at once. Never mind about breakfast:
                    a d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk and a bite standing will have to do. We shall be packed in a few
                    <name type="TIME">minutes</name>.'</q></p>
            <p>Mr. <name type="PERSON">Butterbur</name> hur<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed off to see that their ponies were got ready, and to fetch them
                a 'bite'. But very soon he came back in dismay. The ponies had vanished! The
                stable-doors had all been opened in the <name type="TIME">night</name>, and they were g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>: not only <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>'s
                ponies, but every other horse and beast in the place.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> was crushed by the news. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w could they hope to reach <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name> on foot,
                pursued by mounted enemies? They might as well set out for the <name type="PERSON">Moon</name>. <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> sat
                silent for a while, looking at the hobbits, as if he was weighing up their strength
                and courage.</p>
            <p><q>'Ponies would not help us to escape horsemen,'</q> he said at last, thoughtfully,
                as if he guessed what <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> had in mind. <q>'We should not go much slower on foot,
                    not on the roads that I mean to take. I was going to walk in any case. It is the
                    food and stores that trouble me. We cannot count on getting anything to eat
                    between here and <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name>, except what we take with us; and we ought to take
                    plenty to spare; for we may be delayed, or forced to go round-about, far out of
                    the direct way. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w much are you prepared to carry on your backs?'</q></p>
            <p><q>'As much as we must,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> with a sinking heart, but trying to show
                that he was tougher than he looked (or felt).</p>
            <p><q>'I can carry enough for <name type="CARDINAL">two</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> defiantly.</p>
            <p><q>'Can't anything be <name type="PERSON">don</name>e, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Butterbur</name>?'</q> asked <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'Can't we get a
                    couple of ponies in the village, or even <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> just for the baggage? I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t
                    suppose we could hire them, but we might be able to buy them,'</q> he added,
                doubtfully, wonde<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng if he could af<name type="ORG">ford</name> it.</p>
            <p><q>'I doubt it,'</q> said the landlord unhappily. <q>'The <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> or <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> <name type="GPE">ri</name>ding-ponies
                    that there were in <name type="PERSON">Bree</name> were stabled in my yard, and they're g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. As for other
                    animals, horses or ponies for draught or what not, there are very few of them in
                    <name type="PERSON">Bree</name>, and they won't be for sale. But I'll do what I can. I'll rout out <name type="PERSON">Bob</name> and
                    send him round as soon as may be.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Yes,'</q> said <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> reluctantly, <q>'you had better do that. I am afraid we
                    shall have to try to get <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> pony at least. But so ends all hope of starting
                    early, and slipping away quietly! We might as well have blown a horn to announce
                    our departure. That was part of their plan, no doubt.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'There is <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> crumb of comfort,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>, <q>'and more than a crumb, I
                    hope: we can have breakfast while we wait � and sit down to it. Let's get hold
                    of <name type="PERSON">Nob</name>!'</q></p>
            <p>In the end there was more than <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> <name type="TIME">hour</name>s' delay. <name type="PERSON">Bob</name> came back with the report that
                no horse or pony was to be got for love or m<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>y in the neighbourhood � except <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>:
                <name type="PERSON">Bill</name> <name type="PERSON">Ferny</name> had <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> that he might possibly sell. <q>'A poor old <name type="CARDINAL">half</name>-starved creature
                    it is,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Bob</name>; <q>'but he won't part with it for less than th<name type="GPE">ri</name>ce its
                    worth, seeing how you're placed, not if I knows <name type="PERSON">Bill</name> <name type="PERSON">Ferny</name>.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Bill</name> <name type="PERSON">Ferny</name>?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'Isn't there some t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ck? Wouldn't the beast bolt
                    back to him with all our stuff, or help in tracking us, or something?'</q></p>
            <p><q>'I wonder,'</q> said <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>. <q>'But I cannot imagine any animal running home to
                    him, once it got away. I fancy this is only an afterthought of kind Master
                    <name type="PERSON">Ferny</name>'s: just a way of increasing his profits from the affair. The chief danger
                    is that the poor beast is probably at death's door. But there does not seem any
                    choice. What does he <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t for it?'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Bill</name> <name type="PERSON">Ferny</name>'s p<name type="GPE">ri</name>ce was <name type="CARDINAL">twelve</name> silver pennies; and that was indeed <name type="CARDINAL">at least <name type="CARDINAL">three</name></name>
                times the pony's value in those pans. It proved to be a bony, under<name type="ORG">fed</name>, and
                dispi<name type="GPE">ri</name>ted animal; but it did not look like dying just yet. Mr. <name type="PERSON">Butterbur</name> paid for
                it himself, and offered <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> another <name type="CARDINAL">eight</name>een pence as some compensation for the
                lost animals. He was an h<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>st man, and well-off as things were reck<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>d in <name type="PERSON">Bree</name>;
                but <name type="CARDINAL">thirty</name> silver pennies was a sore blow to him, and being cheated by <name type="PERSON">Bill</name> <name type="PERSON">Ferny</name>
                made it harder to bear.</p>
            <p>As a matter of fact he came out on the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght side in the end. It turned out later
                that only <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> horse had been actually stolen. The others had been d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ven off, or had
                bolted in terror, and were found <name type="PERSON">wan</name>de<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng in different corners of the <name type="PERSON">Bree</name>-land.
                <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>'s ponies had escaped altogether, and eventually (having a good deal of sense)
                they made their way to the <name type="LOC">Downs</name> in search of <name type="PERSON">Fatty</name> <name type="PERSON">Lumpkin</name>. So they came under the
                care of <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> <name type="GPE">Bombadil</name> for a while, and were well-off. But when news of the events at
                <name type="PERSON">Bree</name> came to <name type="PERSON">Tom</name>'s ears, he sent them to Mr. <name type="PERSON">Butterbur</name>, who thus got <name type="CARDINAL">five</name> good
                beasts at a very fair p<name type="GPE">ri</name>ce. They had to work harder in <name type="PERSON">Bree</name>, but <name type="PERSON">Bob</name> treated them
                well; so on the whole they were lucky: they missed a dark and dangerous journey. But
                they never came to <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name>.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Ho</name>wever, in the meanwhile for all Mr. <name type="PERSON">Butterbur</name> knew his m<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>y was g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> for good, or
                for bad. And he had other troubles. For there was a great commotion as soon as the
                remaining guests were <name type="GPE">astir</name> and heard news of the raid on the inn. The southern
                travellers had lost several horses and blamed the innkeeper loudly, until it became
                known that <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of their own number had also disappeared in the <name type="TIME">night</name>, n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> other
                than <name type="PERSON">Bill</name> <name type="PERSON">Ferny</name>'s squint-eyed companion. Suspicion fell on him at once.</p>
            <p><q>'If you pick up with a horse-thief, and b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng him to my house,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Butterbur</name>
                ang<name type="GPE">ri</name>ly, <q>'you ought to pay for all the damage yourselves and not come shouting at
                    me. Go and ask <name type="PERSON">Ferny</name> where your handsome f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end is!'</q> But it appeared that he
                was nobody's f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end, and nobody could recollect when he had joined their party.</p>
            <p>After their breakfast the hobbits had to re-pack, and get together further supplies
                for the longer journey they were now expecting. It was close on <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> o'clock before
                they at last got off. By that time the whole of <name type="PERSON">Bree</name> was buzzing with excitement.
                <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s vanishing t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ck; the appearance of the black horsemen; the robbing of the
                stables; and not least the news that <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> the <name type="PRODUCT">Ranger</name> had joined the myste<name type="GPE">ri</name>ous
                hobbits, made such a tale as would last for many uneventful <name type="DATE">year</name>s. Most of the
                inhabitants of <name type="PERSON">Bree</name> and <name type="ORG">Staddle</name>, and many even from <name type="PERSON">Combe</name> and <name type="PERSON">Archet</name>, were crowded
                in the road to see the travellers start. The other guests in the inn were at the
                doors or hanging out of the windows.</p>
            <p><name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> had changed his mind, and he decided to leave <name type="PERSON">Bree</name> by the main road. Any
                attempt to set off across country at once would only make matters worse: <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> the
                inhabitants would follow them, to see what they were <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name>, and to prevent them from
                trespassing.</p>
            <p>They said farewell to <name type="PERSON">Nob</name> and <name type="PERSON">Bob</name>, and took leave of Mr. <name type="PERSON">Butterbur</name> with many thanks.
                    <q>'I hope we shall meet again some <name type="DATE">day</name>, when things are merry once more,'</q>
                said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'I should like nothing better than to stay in your house in peace for
                    a while.'</q></p>
            <p>They tramped off, anxious and downhearted, under the eyes of the crowd. Not all the
                faces were f<name type="GPE">ri</name>endly, nor all the words that were shouted. But <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> seemed to be
                held in awe by most of the <name type="PERSON">Bree</name>-landers, and those that he stared at shut their
                mouths and drew away. He walked in front with <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>; next came <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>; and
                last came <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> leading the pony, which was laden with as much of their baggage as
                they had the heart to give it; but already it looked less dejected, as if it
                approved of the change in its fortunes. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> was chewing an apple thoughtfully. He
                had a pocket full of them: a parting present from <name type="PERSON">Nob</name> and <name type="PERSON">Bob</name>. <q>'<name type="ORG">Apple</name>s for
                    walking, and a pipe for sitting,'</q> he said. <q>'But I reckon I'll miss them
                    both before long.'</q></p>
            <p>The hobbits took no notice of the inquisitive heads that peeped out of doors, or
                popped over walls and <name type="PERSON">fen</name>ces, as they passed. But as they drew near to the further
                gate, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> saw a dark ill-kept house behind a thick hedge: the last house in the
                village. In <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the windows he caught a glimpse of a sallow face with sly,
                slanting eyes; but it vanished at once.</p>
            <p><q>'So that's where that southerner is hiding!'</q> he thought. <q>'He looks more
                    than <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> like a goblin.'</q></p>
            <p>Over the hedge another man was sta<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng boldly. He had heavy black brows, and dark
                scornful eyes; his large mouth curled in a sneer. He was smoking a short black pipe.
                As they approached he took it out of his mouth and spat.</p>
            <p><q>'<name type="TIME">Morning</name>, <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ngshanks!'</q> he said. <q>'Off early? Found some f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends at
                    last?'</q> <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> nodded, but did not answer. <q>'<name type="TIME">Morning</name>, my little
                    f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends!'</q> he said to the others. <q>'I suppose you know who you've taken up
                    with? That's <name type="FAC">Stick</name>-at-naught <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>, that is! Though I've heard other names not
                    so pretty. Watch out to<name type="TIME">night</name>! And you, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>mie, <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t go ill-treating my poor old
                    pony! Pah!'</q> He spat again.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> turned quickly. <q>'And you. <name type="PERSON">Ferny</name>,'</q> he said, <q>'put your ugly face out of
                    sight, or it will get hurt.'</q> With a sudden flick, quick as lightning, an
                apple left his hand and hit <name type="PERSON">Bill</name> square on the nose. He ducked too late, and curses
                came from behind the hedge. <q>'Waste of a good apple,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> regretfully,
                and strode on.</p>
            <p>At last they left the village behind. The escort of children and stragglers that had
                followed them got tired and turned back at the <name type="LOC">South</name>-gate. Passing through, they
                kept on along the <name type="FAC">Road</name> for some miles. It bent to the left, curving back into its
                eastward line as it rounded the feet of <name type="PERSON">Bree</name>-hill, and then it began to run swiftly
                downwards into wooded country. To their left they could see some of the houses and
                hobbit-holes of <name type="ORG">Staddle</name> on the gentler south-eastern slopes of the hill; down in a
                deep hollow away north of the <name type="FAC">Road</name> there were wisps of <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing smoke that showed
                where <name type="PERSON">Combe</name> lay;</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Archet</name> was hidden in the trees beyond.</p>
            <p>After the <name type="FAC">Road</name> had run down some way, and had left <name type="PERSON">Bree</name>-<name type="ORG">hill s</name>tanding tall and brown
                behind, they came on a narrow track that led off towards the <name type="LOC">North</name>. <q>'This is
                    where we leave the open and take to cover,'</q> said <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>.</p>
            <p><q>'Not a "short cut", I hope,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q>'Our last short cut through woods
                    nearly ended in disaster.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Ah, but you had not got me with you then,'</q> laughed <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>. <q>'My cuts,
                    short or long, <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t go wrong.'</q> He took a look up and down the <name type="FAC">Road</name>. No <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>
                was in sight; and he led the way quickly down towards the wooded valley.</p>
            <p>His plan, as far as they could understand it without knowing the country, was to go
                towards <name type="PERSON">Archet</name> at <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>, but to bear <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght and pass it on the east, and then to
                steer as straight as he could over the wild lands to <name type="ORG">Weathertop</name> <name type="ORG">Hill</name>. In that way
                they would, if all went well, cut off a great loop of the <name type="FAC">Road</name>, which further on
                bent southwards to avoid the <name type="PERSON">Midgewater</name> <name type="LOC">Marshes</name>. But, of course, they would have to
                pass through the <name type="PERSON">mar</name>shes themselves, and <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>'s desc<name type="GPE">ri</name>ption of them was not
                encouraging.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Ho</name>wever, in the meanwhile, walking was not unpleasant. Indeed, if it had not been for
                the disturbing events of the <name type="TIME">night</name> before, they would have enjoyed this pan of the
                journey better than any <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name> that time. The sun was shining, clear but not too hot.
                The woods in the valley were still leafy and full of colour, and seemed peaceful and
                wholesome. <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> guided them confidently among the many crossing paths, although
                left to themselves they would soon have been at a loss. He was taking a <name type="PERSON">wan</name>de<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng
                course with many turns and doublings, to put off any pursuit.</p>
            <p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Bill</name> <name type="PERSON">Ferny</name> will have watched where we left the <name type="FAC">Road</name>, for certain,'</q> he said;
                    <q>'though I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t think he will follow us himself. He knows the land round here
                    well enough, but he knows he is not a match for me in a wood. It is what he may
                    tell others that I am afraid of. I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t suppose they are far away. If they
                    think we have made for <name type="PERSON">Archet</name>, so much the better.'</q></p>
            <p>Whether because of <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>'s skill or for some other reason, they saw no sign and
                heard no sound of any other living thing all that <name type="DATE">day</name>: neither <name type="CARDINAL">two</name>-footed, except
                birds; nor <name type="CARDINAL">four</name>-footed, except <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> fox and a few squirrels. <name type="DATE">The next <name type="DATE">day</name></name> they began
                to steer a steady course eastwards; and still all was quiet and peaceful. On the
                <name type="ORDINAL">third</name> <name type="DATE">day</name> out from <name type="PERSON">Bree</name> they came out of the <name type="PERSON">Che<name type="CARDINAL">two</name>od</name>. The land had been falling
                steadily, ever since they turned aside from the <name type="FAC">Road</name>, and they now entered a wide
                flat expanse of country, much more difficult to manage. They were far beyond the
                borders of the <name type="PERSON">Bree</name>-land, out in the pathless wilderness, and drawing near to the
                Midge-water <name type="LOC">Marshes</name>.</p>
            <p>The ground now became damp, and in places boggy and here and there they came upon
                pools, and wide stretches of reeds and rushes filled with the warbling of little
                hidden birds. They had to pick their way carefully to keep both dry-footed and on
                their proper course. At <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> they made fan-progress, but as they went on, their
                passage became slower and more dangerous. The <name type="PERSON">mar</name>shes were bewilde<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng and
                treacherous, and there was no permanent trail even for <name type="PRODUCT">Ranger</name>s to find through their
                shifting quagmires. The flies began to torment them, and the air was full of clouds
                of tiny midges that crept up their sleeves and breeches and into their <name type="PERSON">hai</name>r.</p>
            <p><q>'I am being ea<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> alive!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Midgewater</name>! There are more midges
                    than water!'</q></p>
            <p><q>'What do they live on when they can't get hobbit?'</q> asked <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, scrat<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g his
                neck.</p>
            <p>They spent a miserable <name type="DATE">day</name> in this l<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>ly and unpleasant country. Their camping-place
                was damp, cold, and uncomfortable; and the biting in<name type="ORG">sec</name>ts would not let them sleep.
                There were also abominable creatures haunting the reeds and tussocks that from the
                sound of them were evil relatives of the c<name type="GPE">ri</name>cket. There were <name type="CARDINAL">thousands</name> of them, and
                they squeaked all round, _neek-b<name type="GPE">reek</name>, <name type="GPE">b<name type="GPE">reek</name>-neek</name>,_ unceasingly <name type="TIME">all the <name type="TIME">night</name></name>, until
                the hobbits were nearly frantic.</p>
            <p><name type="DATE">The next <name type="DATE">day</name></name>, the <name type="CARDINAL">four</name>th, was little better, and the <name type="TIME">night</name> almost as comfortless.
                Though the <name type="PERSON">Neekerb<name type="GPE">reek</name>ers</name> (as <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> called them) had been left behind, the midges
                still pursued them.</p>
            <p>As <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> lay, tired but unable to close his eyes, it seemed to him that far away
                there came a light in the eastern sky: it flashed and faded many times. It was not
                the <name type="TIME">dawn</name>, for that was still some <name type="TIME">hour</name>s off.</p>
            <p><q>'What is the light?'</q> he said to <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>, who had <name type="GPE">ri</name>sen, and was standing,
                gazing ahead into the <name type="TIME">night</name>.</p>
            <p><q>'I do not know,'</q> <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> answered. <q>'It is too distant to make out. It is
                    like lightning that leaps up from the hill-tops.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> lay down again, but for a long while he could still see the white flashes, and
                against them the tall dark figure of <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>, standing silent and watchful. At last
                he passed into uneasy sleep.</p>
            <p>They had not g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> far on the <name type="ORDINAL">fifth</name> <name type="DATE">day</name> when they left the last straggling pools and
                reed-beds of the <name type="PERSON">mar</name>shes behind them. The land before them began steadily to <name type="GPE">ri</name>se
                again. Away in the distance eastward they could now see a line of hills. The highest
                of them was at the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght of the line and a little separated from the others. It had
                a conical top, slightly flat<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed at the summit.</p>
            <p><q>'That is <name type="ORG">Weathertop</name>,'</q> said <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>. <q>'The Old <name type="FAC">Road</name>, which we have left far
                    away on our <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght, runs to the south of it and passes not far from its foot. We
                    might reach it by <name type="TIME">noon</name> to<name type="DATE">morrow</name>, if we go straight towards it. I suppose we had
                    better do so.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'What do you mean?'</q> asked <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.</p>
            <p>
                <q>'I mean: when we do get there, it is not certain what we shall find. It is close
                    to the <name type="FAC">Road</name>.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>
                <q>'But surely we were hoping to find <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> there?'</q>
            </p>
            <p>
                <q>'Yes; but the hope is faint. If he comes this way at all, he may not pass through
                    <name type="PERSON">Bree</name>, and so he may not know what we are doing. And anyway, unless by luck we
                    ar<name type="GPE">ri</name>ve almost together, we shall miss <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> another; it will not be safe for him
                    or for us to wait there long. If the <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s fail to find us in the wilderness,
                    they are likely to make for <name type="ORG">Weathertop</name> themselves. It commands a wide view all
                    round. Indeed, there are many birds and beasts in this country that could see
                    us, as we stand here, from that hill-top. Not all the birds are to be trusted,
                    and there are other spies more evil than they are.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>The hobbits looked anxiously at the distant hills. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> looked up into the pale sky,
                fea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng to see hawks or eagles hove<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng over them with b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght unf<name type="GPE">ri</name>endly eyes.
                    <q>'You do make me feel uncomfortable and l<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>some, <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>!'</q> he said.</p>
            <p><q>'What do you advise us to do?'</q> asked <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.</p>
            <p><q>'I think,'</q> answered <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> slowly, as if he was not quite sure, <q>'I think
                    the best thing is to go as straight eastward from here as we can, to make for
                    the line of hills, not for <name type="ORG">Weathertop</name>. There we can st<name type="GPE">ri</name>ke a path I know that
                    runs at their feet; it will b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng us to <name type="ORG">Weathertop</name> from the north and less
                    openly. Then we shall see what we shall see.'</q></p>
            <p>All that <name type="DATE">day</name> they plodded along, until the cold and <name type="TIME">early <name type="TIME">evening</name></name> came down. The land
                became d<name type="GPE">ri</name>er and more barren; but mists and vapours lay behind them on the <name type="PERSON">mar</name>shes.
                A few melancholy birds were piping and wailing, until the round red sun sank slowly
                into the western shadows; then an empty silence fell. The hobbits thought of the
                soft light of sunset glancing through the cheerful windows of <name type="FAC">Bag End</name> far away.</p>
            <p>At the <name type="DATE">day</name>'s end they came to a stream that <name type="PERSON">wan</name>dered down from the hills to lose
                itself in the stagnant <name type="PERSON">mar</name>shland, and they went up along its banks while the light
                lasted. It was already <name type="TIME">night</name> when at last they halted and made their camp under some
                stunted alder-trees by the shores of the stream. Ahead there loomed now against the
                <name type="TIME">dusk</name>y sky the bleak and treeless backs of the hills. <name type="TIME">That <name type="TIME">night</name></name> they set a watch,
                and <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>, it seemed, did not sleep at all. The moon was waxing, and in the early
                <name type="TIME">night</name>-<name type="TIME">hour</name>s a cold grey light lay on the land.</p>
            <p><name type="TIME">Next <name type="TIME">morning</name></name> they set out again soon after sun<name type="GPE">ri</name>se. There was a frost in the air, and
                the sky was a pale clear blue. The hobbits felt refreshed, as if they had had a
                <name type="TIME">night</name> of unbroken sleep. Already they were getting used to much walking on short
                commons � shorter at any rate than what in the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> they would have thought barely
                enough to keep them on their legs. <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> declared that <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> was looking twice the
                hobbit that he had been.</p>
            <p><q>'Very odd,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, tigh<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing his belt, <q>'conside<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng that there is
                    actually a good deal less of me. I hope the thinning process will not go on
                    indefinitely, or I shall become a wraith.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Do not speak of such things!'</q> said <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> quickly, and with surp<name type="GPE">ri</name>sing
                earnestness.</p>
            <p>The hills drew nearer. They made an undulating <name type="GPE">ri</name>dge, of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing almost to a
                thousand feet, and here and there falling again to low clefts or passes leading into
                the eastern land beyond. Along the crest of the <name type="GPE">ri</name>dge the hobbits could see what
                looked to be the remains of green-grown walls and dikes, and in the clefts there
                still stood the ruins of old works of st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. By <name type="TIME">night</name> they had reached the feet of
                the westward slopes, and there they camped. It was the <name type="TIME">night</name> of the <name type="ORDINAL">fifth</name> of
                <name type="DATE">October</name>, and they were <name type="CARDINAL">six</name> <name type="DATE">day</name>s out from <name type="PERSON">Bree</name>.</p>
            <p>In the <name type="TIME">morning</name> they found, for the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> time since they had left the <name type="PERSON">Che<name type="CARDINAL">two</name>od</name>, a
                track plain to see. They turned <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght and followed it southwards. It ran cunningly,
                taking a line that seemed chosen so as to keep as much hidden as possible from the
                view, both of the hill-tops above and of the flats to the west. It dived into <name type="ORG">dell</name>s,
                and hugged steep banks; and where it passed over flatter and more open ground on
                either side of it there were lines of large boulders and hewn st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s that screened
                the travellers almost like a hedge.</p>
            <p><q>'I wonder who made this path, and what for,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>, as they walked along
                <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of these avenues, where the st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s were unusually large and closely set. <q>'I
                    am not sure that I like it: it has a � well, rather a barrow-wightish look. Is
                    there any barrow on <name type="ORG">Weathertop</name>?'</q></p>
            <p><q>'No. There is no barrow on <name type="ORG">Weathertop</name>, nor on any of these hills,'</q> answered
                <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>. <q>'The <name type="ORG">Men</name> of the <name type="LOC">West</name> did not live here; though in their latter <name type="DATE">day</name>s they
                    de<name type="PERSON">fen</name>ded the hills for a while against the evil that came out of Ang<name type="PERSON">mar</name>. This
                    path was made to serve the forts along the walls. But long before, in the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>
                    <name type="DATE">day</name>s of the <name type="LOC">North</name> <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>gdom, they built a great watch-tower on <name type="ORG">Weathertop</name>, Amon
                    S�l they called it. It was burned and broken, and nothing remains of it now but
                    a tumbled <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng, like a rough crown on the old hill's head. Yet once it was tall
                    and fair. It is told that <name type="PERSON">Elen</name>dil stood there wat<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g for the coming of
                    <name type="PERSON">Gil-galad</name> out of the <name type="LOC">West</name>, in the <name type="DATE">day</name>s of <name type="ORG">the Last Alliance</name>.'</q></p>
            <p>The hobbits gazed at <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>. It seemed that he was learned in old lore, as well as
                in the ways of the wild. <q>'Who was <name type="PERSON">Gil-galad</name>?'</q> asked <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>; but <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> did
                not answer, and seemed to be lost in thought. Suddenly a low voice murmured:</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Gil-galad</name> was an <name type="ORG">Elven</name>-king.</p>
            <p>Of him the harpers sadly sing:</p>
            <p>the last whose realm was fair and free</p>
            <p>between the <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s and the <name type="LOC">Sea</name>.</p>
            <p>His sword was long, his lance was keen,</p>
            <p>his shining helm afar was seen;</p>
            <p>the countless stars of heaven's field</p>
            <p>were mirrored in his silver shield.</p>
            <p>But <name type="DATE">long ago</name> he rode away,</p>
            <p>and where he dwelleth n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> can say;</p>
            <p>for into darkness fell his star</p>
            <p>in <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> where the shadows are.</p>
            <p>The others turned in amazement, for the voice was <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>'s.</p>
            <p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Don</name>'t stop!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>.</p>
            <p><q>'That's all I know,'</q> stammered <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, blushing. <q>'I learned it from Mr. <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>
                    when I was a lad. He used to tell me tales like that, knowing how I was always
                    <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> for hea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng about <name type="ORG">Elves</name>. It was Mr. <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> as taught me my letters. He was
                    mighty book-learned was dear old Mr. <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>. And he wrote _poetry._ He wrote what
                    I have just said.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'He did not make it up,'</q> said <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>. <q>'It is pan of the lay that is called
                    _The Fall of <name type="PERSON">Gil-galad</name>,_ which is in an ancient tongue. <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> must have
                    translated it. I never knew that.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'There was a lot more,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, <q>'all about <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>. I didn't learn that
                    part, it gave me the shivers I never thought I should be going that way
                    myself!'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Going to <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q>'I hope it won't come to that!'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Do not speak that name so loudly!'</q> said <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>.</p>
            <p>It was already mid-<name type="DATE">day</name> when they drew near the southern end of the path, and saw
                before them, in the pale clear light of the <name type="DATE">October</name> sun, a <name type="ORG">grey-green bank</name>, leading
                up like a b<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge on to the northward slope of the hill They decided to make for the
                top at once, while the <name type="DATE">day</name>light was broad Concealment was no longer possible, and
                they could only hope that no enemy or spy was observing them. Nothing was to be seen
                moving on the hill. If <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> was anywhere about, there was no sign of him.</p>
            <p>On the western flank of <name type="ORG">Weathertop</name> they found a sheltered hollow, at the bot<name type="PERSON">tom</name> of
                which there was a bowl-shaped <name type="ORG">dell</name> with grassy sides. There they left <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>
                with the pony and their packs and luggage. The other <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> went on. After <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> an
                <name type="TIME">hour</name>'s plodding climb <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> reached the crown of the hill; <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>
                followed, tired and breathless. The last slope had been steep and rocky.</p>
            <p>On the top they found, as <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> had said, a wide <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng of ancient st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>work, now
                crumbling or covered with age-long grass. But in the centre a cairn of broken st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s
                had been piled. They were blackened as if with fire. About them the turf was burned
                to the roots and all within the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng the grass was scorched and sh<name type="GPE">ri</name>velled, as if
                flames had swept the hill-top; but there was no sign of any living thing.</p>
            <p>Standing upon the <name type="GPE">ri</name>m of the ruined circle, they saw all round below them a wide
                prospect, for the most pan of lands empty and featureless, except for patches of
                woodland away to the south, beyond which they caught here and there the glint of
                distant water. Beneath them on this southern side there ran like a <name type="GPE">ri</name>bbon the Old
                <name type="FAC">Road</name>, coming out of the <name type="LOC">West</name> and winding up and down, until it faded behind a <name type="GPE">ri</name>dge
                of dark land to the east. Nothing was moving on it. Following its line eastward with
                their eyes they saw the <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s: the nearer foothills were brown and sombre;</p>
            <p>behind them stood taller shapes of grey, and behind those again were high white peaks
                glimme<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng among the clouds.</p>
            <p><q>'Well, here we are!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'And very cheerless and uninviting it
                    looks! There is no water and no shelter. And no sign of <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. But I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t
                    blame him for not waiting � if he ever came here.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'I wonder,'</q> said <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>, looking round thoughtfully. <q>'Even if he was <name type="DATE">a <name type="DATE">day</name></name>
                    or <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> behind us at <name type="PERSON">Bree</name>, he could have ar<name type="GPE">ri</name>ved here <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>. He can <name type="GPE">ri</name>de very
                    swiftly when need presses.'</q> Suddenly he stooped and looked at the st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> on
                the top of the cairn; it was flatter than the others, and whiter, as if it had
                escaped the fire. He picked it up and examined it, turning it in his fingers. "This
                has been handled recently,<q>' he said. 'What do you think of these <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ks?'</q></p>
            <p>On the flat under-side <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> saw some scratches: <q>'There seems to he a stroke, a
                    dot, and <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> more strokes,'</q> he said.</p>
            <p><q>'The stroke on the left might be a G-rune with thin branches,'</q> said <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>.
                    <q>'It might be a sign left by <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, though <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> cannot be sure. The scratches
                    are fine, and they certainly look fresh. But the <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ks might mean something
                    quite different, and have nothing to do with us. <name type="PRODUCT">Ranger</name>s use runes, and they
                    come here sometimes.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'What could they mean, even if <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> made them?'</q> asked <name type="PERSON">Merry</name></p>
            <p><q>'I should say,'</q> answered <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>, <q>'that they stood for <name type="ORG">G3</name>, and were a sign
                    that <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> was here on <name type="DATE">October</name> the <name type="ORDINAL">third</name>: that is <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> <name type="DATE">day</name>s ago now. It would
                    also show that he was in a hurry and danger was at hand, so that he had no time
                    or did not dare to w<name type="GPE">ri</name>te anything longer or plainer. If that is so, we must be
                    wary.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'I wish we could feel sure that he made the <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ks, whatever they may mean,'</q>
                said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> <q>'It would be a great comfort to know that he was on the way, in front
                    of us or behind us.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Perhaps,'</q> said <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>. 'For myself, I believe that he was here, and was in
                danger. There have been scor<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g flames here; and now the light that we saw <name type="CARDINAL">three</name>
                <name type="TIME">night</name>s ago in the eastern sky comes back to my mind. I guess that he was attacked on
                this hill-top, but with what result I cannot tell. He is here no longer, and we must
                now look after ourselves and make our own way to <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name>, as best we can '</p>
            <p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w far is <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name>?'</q> asked <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>, gazing round wea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ly. The world looked
                wild and wide from <name type="ORG">Weathertop</name>.</p>
            <p><q>'I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t know if the <name type="FAC">Road</name> has ever been measured in miles beyond the _Forsaken

                    far, and some say otherwise. It is a strange road, and folk are glad to reach
                    their journey's end, whether the time is long or short. But I know how long it
                    would take me on my own feet, with fair weather and no ill fortune <name type="CARDINAL">twelve</name> <name type="DATE">day</name>s
                    from here to the <name type="ORG">Ford</name> of <name type="PERSON">Bruinen</name>, where the <name type="FAC">Road</name> crosses the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>udwater that runs
                    out of <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name>. We have <name type="DATE">at least a fort<name type="TIME">night</name></name>'s journey before us, for I do not
                    think we shall be able to use the <name type="FAC">Road</name>.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'A fort<name type="TIME">night</name>!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'A lot may happen in that time.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'It may,'</q> said <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>.</p>
            <p>They stood for a while silent on the hill-top, near its southward edge. In that
                l<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>ly place <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> for the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> time fully realized his homelessness and danger. He
                wished bitterly that his fortune had left him in the quiet and beloved <name type="LOC">Shire</name>. He
                stared down at the hateful <name type="FAC">Road</name>, leading back westward � to his home. Suddenly he
                was aware that <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> black specks were moving slowly along it, going westward; and
                looking again he saw that <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> others were creeping eastward to meet them. He gave
                a cry and clutched <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>'s arm.</p>
            <p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok,'</q> he said, pointing downwards.</p>
            <p>At once <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> flung himself on the ground behind the ruined circle, pulling <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>
                down beside him. <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> threw himself alongside.</p>
            <p><q>'What is it?'</q> he whispered.</p>
            <p><q>'I do not know, but I fear the worst,'</q> answered <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>.</p>
            <p>Slowly they crawled <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name> the edge of the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng again, and peered through a cleft
                <name type="CARDINAL">between <name type="CARDINAL">two</name></name> jagged st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s. The light was no longer b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght, for the clear <name type="TIME">morning</name> had
                faded, and clouds creeping out of the <name type="LOC">East</name> had now overtaken the sun, as it began to
                go down. They could all see the black specks, but neither <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> nor <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> could make
                out their shapes for certain; yet something told them that there, far below, were
                <name type="ORG">Black</name> <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s assembling on the <name type="FAC">Road</name> beyond the foot of the hill.</p>
            <p><q>'Yes,'</q> said <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>, whose keener sight left him in no doubt. <q>'The enemy is
                    here!'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Hastily</name> they crept away and slipped down the north side of the hill to find their
                companions.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> and <name type="PERSON">Pereg<name type="GPE">ri</name>n</name> had not been idle. They had explored the small <name type="ORG">dell</name> and the
                surrounding slopes. Not far away they found a sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng of clear water in the hillside,
                and near it footp<name type="GPE">ri</name>nts not more than <name type="DATE">a <name type="DATE">day</name></name> or <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> old. In the <name type="ORG">dell</name> itself they found
                recent traces of a fire, and other signs of a hasty camp. There were some fallen
                rocks on the edge of the <name type="ORG">dell</name> nearest to the hill. Behind them <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> came upon a small
                store of firewood neatly stacked.</p>
            <p><q>'I wonder if old <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> has been here,'</q> he said to <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q>'Whoever it was
                    put this stuff here meant to come back it seems.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> was greatly interested in these discove<name type="GPE">ri</name>es. <q>'I wish I had waited and
                    explored the ground down here myself,'</q> he said, hurrying off to the sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng
                to examine the footp<name type="GPE">ri</name>nts.</p>
            <p><q>'It is just as I feared,'</q> he said, when he came back. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Sam</name> and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> have
                    trampled the soft ground, and the <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ks are spoilt or confused. <name type="PRODUCT">Ranger</name>s have
                    been here lately. It is they who left the firewood behind. But there are also
                    several newer tracks that were not made by <name type="PRODUCT">Ranger</name>s. <name type="CARDINAL">At least <name type="CARDINAL">one</name></name> set was made,
                    only <name type="DATE">a <name type="DATE">day</name></name> or <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> ago, by heavy boots. <name type="CARDINAL">At least <name type="CARDINAL">one</name></name>. I cannot now be certain,
                    but I think there were many booted feet.'</q> He paused and stood in anxious
                thought.</p>
            <p>Each of the hobbits saw in his mind a vision of the cloaked and booted <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s. If the
                horsemen had already found the <name type="ORG">dell</name>, the so<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>r <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> led them somewhere else the
                better. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> viewed the hollow with great dislike, now that he had heard news of
                their enemies on the <name type="FAC">Road</name>, only <name type="QUANTITY">a few miles</name> away.</p>
            <p><q>'<name type="ORG">Hadn</name>'t we better clear out quick, Mr. <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>?'</q> he asked impatiently. <q>'It
                    is getting late, and I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t like this hole: it makes my heart sink
                    somehow.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Yes, we certainly must decide what to do at once,'</q> answered <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>, looking
                up and conside<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng the time and the weather. <q>'Well, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>,'</q> he said at last,
                    <q>'I do not like this place either; but I cannot think of anywhere better that
                    we could reach <name type="TIME">before <name type="TIME">night</name></name>fall. At least we are out of sight for the moment,
                    and if we moved we should be much more likely to be seen by spies. All we could
                    do would be to go <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght out of our way back north on this side of the line of
                    hills, where the land is all much the same as it is here. The <name type="FAC">Road</name> is watched,
                    but we should have to cross it, if we t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed to take cover in the thickets away
                    to the south. On the north side of the <name type="FAC">Road</name> beyond the hills the country is bare
                    and flat for miles.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Can the <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s _see?'</q>_ asked <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'I mean, they seem usually to have
                    used their noses rather than their eyes, smelling for us, if smelling is the
                    <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght word, at least in the <name type="DATE">day</name>light. But you made us lie down flat when you saw
                    them down below; and now you talk of being seen, if we move.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'I was too careless on the hill-top,'</q> answered <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>. <q>'I was very anxious
                    to find some sign of <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>; but it was a mistake for <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> of us to go up and
                    stand there so long. For the black horses can see, and the <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s can use men
                    and other creatures as spies, as we found at <name type="PERSON">Bree</name>. They themselves do not see
                    the world of light as we do, but our shapes cast shadows in their minds, which
                    only the <name type="TIME">noon</name> sun destroys; and in the dark they perceive many signs and forms
                    that are hidden from us: then they are most to be feared. And at all times they
                    smell the blood of living things, desi<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng and hating it. Senses, too, there are
                    other than sight or smell. We can feel their presence � it troubled our hearts,
                    as soon as we came here, and before we saw them; they feel ours more keenly.
                    Also,'</q> he added, and his voice sank to a whisper, <q>'the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> draws
                    them.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Is there no escape then?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, looking round wildly. <q>'If I move I
                    shall be seen and hunted! If I stay, I shall draw them to me!'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> laid his hand on his shoulder. <q>'There is still hope,'</q> he said. <q>'You
                    are not al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. Let us take this wood that is set ready for the fire as a sign.
                    There is little shelter or de<name type="PERSON">fen</name>ce here, but fire shall serve for both. <name type="ORG">Sauron</name>
                    can put fire to his evil uses, as he can all things, but these <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s do not
                    love it, and fear those who wield it. <name type="ORG">Fire</name> is our f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end in the

            <p><q>'<name type="DATE">May</name>be,'</q> muttered <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <q>'It is also as good a way of saying "here we are" as
                    I can think of, bar shouting.'</q></p>
            <p>Down in the lowest and most sheltered corner of the <name type="ORG">dell</name> they lit a fire, and
                prepared a meal. The shades of <name type="TIME">evening</name> began to fall, and it grew cold. They were
                suddenly aware of great hunger, for they had not ea<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> anything since breakfast; but
                they dared not make more than a frugal supper. The lands ahead were empty of all
                save birds and beasts, unf<name type="GPE">ri</name>endly places deserted by all the races of the world.
                <name type="PRODUCT">Ranger</name>s passed at times beyond the hills, but they were few and did not stay. Other
                <name type="PERSON">wan</name>derers were rare, and of evil sort: trolls might stray down at times out of the
                northern valleys of the <name type="LOC">Misty <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s</name>. Only on the <name type="FAC">Road</name> would travellers be found,
                most of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> dwarves, hurrying along on business of their own, and with no help and
                few words to spare for strangers.</p>
            <p><q>'I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t see how our food can be made to last,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'We have been
                    careful enough in the last few <name type="DATE">day</name>s, and this supper is no feast; but we have
                    used more than we ought, if we have <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> <name type="DATE">week</name>s still to go, and perhaps
                    more.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'There is food in the wild,'</q> said <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>; <q>'berry, root, and herb; and I
                    have some skill as a hunter at need. You need not be afraid of starving before
                    <name type="DATE">winter</name> comes. But gathe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng and cat<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g food is long and weary work, and we
                    need haste. So tigh<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> your belts, and think with hope of the tables of <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name>'s
                    house!'</q></p>
            <p>The cold increased as darkness came on. Pee<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng out from the edge of the <name type="ORG">dell</name> they
                could see nothing but a grey land now vanishing quickly into shadow. The sky above
                had cleared again and was slowly filled with twinkling stars. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and his
                companions huddled round the fire, wrapped in every garment and blanket they
                possessed; but <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> was con<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>t with a single cloak, and sat a little apart,
                drawing thoughtfully at his pipe.</p>
            <p>As <name type="TIME">night</name> fell and the light of the fire began to shine out b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ghtly he began to tell
                them tales to keep their minds from fear. He knew many histo<name type="GPE">ri</name>es and legends of long
                ago, of <name type="ORG">Elves</name> and <name type="ORG">Men</name> and the good and evil deeds of the <name type="DATE">Elder Days</name>. They wondered
                how old he was, and where he had learned all this lore.</p>
            <p><q>'Tell us of <name type="PERSON">Gil-galad</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> suddenly, when he paused at the end of a

            <p><q>'I do indeed,'</q> answered <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>. <q>'So also does <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, for it concerns us
                    closely.'</q> <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> looked at <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, who was sta<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng into the

            <p><q>'I know only the little that <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> has told me,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> slowly.
                    <q>'<name type="PERSON">Gil-galad</name> was the last of the great <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name>-kings of <name type="LOC">Middle-<name type="LOC">earth</name></name>. <name type="PERSON">Gil-galad</name> is
                    _Starlight_ in their tongue. With <name type="PERSON">Elen</name>dil, the <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name>-f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end, he went to the land

            <p><q>'No!'</q> said <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> interrupting, <q>'I do not think that tale should be told

            <p><q>'Then tell us some other tale of the old <name type="DATE">day</name>s,'</q> begged <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>; <q>'a tale about

                    the dark seems to press round so close.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'I will tell you the tale of Tin�viel,'</q> said <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>, <q>'in b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ef � for it is

                chant softly:</p>
            <p>The leaves were long, the grass was green,</p>
            <p>The hemlock-umbels tall and fair,</p>
            <p>And in the glade a light was seen</p>
            <p>Of stars in shadow shimme<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng.</p>
            <p>Tin�viel was dancing there</p>
            <p>To music of a pipe unseen,</p>
            <p>And light of stars was in her <name type="PERSON">hai</name>r,</p>

            <p>There <name type="PERSON">Beren</name> came from mountains cold,</p>
            <p>And lost he <name type="PERSON">wan</name>dered under leaves,</p>

            <p>He walked al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> and sorrowing.</p>
            <p>He peered between the hemlock-leaves</p>
            <p>And saw in <name type="PERSON">wan</name>der flowers of gold</p>
            <p>Upon her mantle and her sleeves,</p>
            <p>And her <name type="PERSON">hai</name>r like shadow following.</p>
            <p>Enchantment healed his weary feet</p>
            <p>That over hills were doomed to roam;</p>
            <p>And forth he has<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed, strong and fleet,</p>
            <p>And grasped at moonbeams glis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Thr</name>ough woven woods in <name type="ORG">Elven</name>home</p>
            <p>She tightly fled on dancing feet,</p>
            <p>And left him l<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>ly still to roam</p>
            <p>In the silent forest lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing.</p>
            <p>He heard there oft the flying sound</p>
            <p>Of feet as light as linden-leaves,</p>
            <p>Or music welling underground,</p>
            <p>In hidden hollows quave<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng.</p>
            <p>Now withered lay the hemlock-sheaves,</p>

            <p>Whispe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng fell the beechen leaves</p>
            <p>In the <name type="GPE">wintry</name> woodland wave<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng.</p>
            <p>He sought her ever, <name type="PERSON">wan</name>de<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng far</p>
            <p>Where leaves of <name type="DATE">year</name>s were thickly strewn,</p>
            <p>By light of moon and ray of star</p>
            <p>In frosty heavens shive<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng.</p>
            <p>Her mantle glinted in the moon,</p>
            <p>As on a hill-top high and far</p>
            <p>She danced, and at her feet was strewn</p>
            <p>A mist of silver quive<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng.</p>
            <p>When <name type="DATE">winter</name> passed, she came again,</p>
            <p>And her song released the sudden sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng,</p>
            <p>Like <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing lark, and falling rain,</p>
            <p>And melting water bubbling.</p>
            <p>He saw the <name type="ORG">elven</name>-flowers sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng</p>
            <p>About her feet, and healed again</p>
            <p>He longed by her to dance and sing</p>
            <p>Upon the grass untroubling.</p>
            <p>Again she fled, but swift he came.</p>
            <p>Tin�viel! Tin�viel!</p>
            <p>He called her by her elvish name;</p>
            <p>And there she halted lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing.</p>
            <p><name type="CARDINAL">One</name> moment stood she, and a spell</p>
            <p>His voice laid on her: <name type="PERSON">Beren</name> came,</p>
            <p>And doom fell on Tin�viel</p>
            <p>That in his arms lay glis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing.</p>
            <p>As <name type="PERSON">Beren</name> looked into her eyes</p>
            <p>Within the shadows of her <name type="PERSON">hai</name>r,</p>
            <p>The trembling starlight of the skies</p>
            <p>He saw there mirrored shimme<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng.</p>
            <p>Tin�viel the <name type="ORG">elven</name>-fair,</p>
            <p><name type="PRODUCT">Immortal maiden <name type="ORG">elven</name></name>-wise,</p>

            <p>In the forest singing sorrowless.</p>
            <p><name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> sighed and paused before he spoke again. <q>'That is a song,'</q> he said,
                    <q>'in the mode that is called _<name type="PERSON">ann-thennath</name>_ among the <name type="ORG">Elves</name>, but is hard to
                    render in our Common <name type="ORG">Speech</name>, and this is but a rough echo of it. It tells of the
                    meeting of <name type="PERSON">Beren</name> son of <name type="LOC">Barahir</name> and L�thien Tin�viel. <name type="PERSON">Beren</name> was a mortal man,
                    but L�thien was the daughter of <name type="ORG">Thingol</name>, a <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g of <name type="ORG">Elves</name> upon <name type="LOC">Middle-<name type="LOC">earth</name></name> when
                    the world was young; and she was the fairest maiden that has ever been among all
                    the children of this world. As the stars above the mists of the <name type="LOC">North</name>ern lands
                    was her loveliness, and in her face was a shining light. In those <name type="DATE">day</name>s the Great
                    Enemy, of whom <name type="ORG">Sauron</name> of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> was but a servant, dwelt in <name type="ORG">Angband</name> in the
                    <name type="LOC">North</name>, and the <name type="ORG">Elves</name> of the <name type="LOC">West</name> coming back to <name type="LOC">Middle-<name type="LOC">earth</name></name> made war upon him
                    to regain the <name type="PERSON">Sil<name type="PERSON">mar</name>il</name>s which he had stolen; and the fathers of <name type="ORG">Men</name> aided the
                    <name type="ORG">Elves</name>. But the Enemy was victo<name type="GPE">ri</name>ous and <name type="LOC">Barahir</name> was slain, and <name type="PERSON">Beren</name> escaping
                    through great pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>l came over the <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s of Terror into the hidden <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>gdom of
                    <name type="ORG">Thingol</name> in the forest of <name type="GPE">Neldoreth</name>. There he beheld L�thien singing and dancing
                    in a glade beside the enchanted <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver Esgalduin; and he named her Tin�viel, that
                    is <name type="PERSON">Nightingale</name> in the language of old. Many sorrows befell them afterwards, and
                    they were parted long. Tin�viel rescued <name type="PERSON">Beren</name> from the dungeons of <name type="ORG">Sauron</name>, and
                    together they passed through great dangers, and cast down even the Great Enemy
                    from his thr<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, and took from his iron crown <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> <name type="PERSON">Sil<name type="PERSON">mar</name>il</name>s,
                    b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ghtest of all jewels, to be the b<name type="GPE">ri</name>de-p<name type="GPE">ri</name>ce of L�thien to <name type="ORG">Thingol</name> her father.
                    Yet at the last <name type="PERSON">Beren</name> was slain by the <name type="PERSON">Wolf</name> that came from the gates of <name type="ORG">Angband</name>,
                    and he died in the arms of Tin�viel. But she chose mortality, and to die from
                    the world, so that she might follow him; and it is sung that they met again
                    beyond the <name type="ORG">Sun</name>de<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng <name type="LOC">Sea</name>s, and after a b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ef time walking alive once more in the
                    green woods, together they passed, <name type="DATE">long ago</name>, beyond the confines of this world.
                    So it is that L�thien Tin�viel al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name>-kindred has died indeed and left
                    the world, and they have lost her whom they most loved. But from her the lineage
                    of the <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name>-lords of old descended among <name type="ORG">Men</name>. There live still those of whom

            <p>As <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> was speaking they watched his strange eager face, dimly lit in the red
                glow of the wood-fire. His eyes sh<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, and his voice was <name type="GPE">ri</name>ch and deep. Above him
                was a black starry sky. Suddenly a pale light appeared over the crown of <name type="ORG">Weathertop</name>
                behind him. The waxing moon was climbing slowly above the hill that overshadowed
                them, and the stars above the hill-top faded.</p>
            <p>The story ended. The hobbits moved and stretched. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'The
                    <name type="PERSON">Moon</name> is <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing: it must be getting late.'</q></p>
            <p>The others looked up. Even as they did so, they saw on the top of the <name type="ORG">hill s</name>omething
                small and dark against the glimmer of the moon<name type="GPE">ri</name>se. It was perhaps only a large
                st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> or jutting rock shown up by the pale light.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> and <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> got up and walked away from the fire. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> remained seated
                in silence. <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> was wat<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g the moonlight on the hill in<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>tly. All seemed
                quiet and still, but <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> felt a cold dread creeping over his heart, now that
                <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> was no longer speaking. He huddled closer to the fire. At that moment <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>
                came running back from the edge of the <name type="ORG">dell</name>.</p>
            <p><q>'I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t know what it is,'</q> he said, <q>'but I suddenly felt afraid. I durstn't
                    go outside this <name type="ORG">dell</name> for any m<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>y; I felt that something was creeping up the
                    slope.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Did you _see_ anything?'</q> asked <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>nging to his feet.</p>
            <p>
                <q>'No, sir. I saw nothing, but I didn't stop to look.'</q>
            </p>
            <p><q>'I saw something,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>; <q>'or I thought I did � away westwards where
                    the moonlight was falling on the flats beyond the shadow of the hill-tops, I
                    _thought_ there were <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> or <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> black shapes. They seemed to be moving this
                    way.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Keep close to the fire, with your faces outward!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>. <q>'Get some
                    of the longer sticks ready in your hands!'</q></p>
            <p>For a breathless time they sat there, silent and alert, with their backs turned to
                the wood-fire, each gazing into the shadows that encircled them. Nothing happened.
                There was no sound or movement in the <name type="TIME">night</name>. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> stirred, feeling that he must
                break the silence: he longed to shout out aloud.</p>
            <p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Hush</name>!'</q> whispered <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>. <q>'What's that?'</q> gasped <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> at the same
                moment.</p>
            <p>Over the lip of the little <name type="ORG">dell</name>, on the side away from the hill, they felt, rather
                than saw, a shadow <name type="GPE">ri</name>se, <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> shadow or <name type="CARDINAL">more than <name type="CARDINAL">one</name></name>. They strained their eyes, and
                the shadows seemed to grow. Soon there could be no doubt:</p>
            <p><name type="CARDINAL">three</name> or <name type="CARDINAL">four</name> tall black figures were standing there on the slope, looking down on
                them. So black were they that they seemed like black holes in the deep shade behind
                them. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> thought that he heard a faint hiss as of venomous breath and felt a thin
                piercing chill. Then the shapes slowly advanced.</p>
            <p>Terror overcame <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> and <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>, and they threw themselves flat on the ground. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>
                shrank to <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s side. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> was hardly less ter<name type="GPE">ri</name>fied than his companions; he was
                quaking as if he was bitter cold, but his terror was swallowed up in a sudden
                temptation to put on the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>. The desire to do this laid hold of him, and he could
                think of nothing else. He did not forget the <name type="ORG">Barrow</name>, nor the message of <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>; but
                something seemed to be compelling him to disregard all warnings, and he longed to
                yield. Not with the hope of escape, or of doing anything, either good or bad: he
                simply felt that he must take the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> and put it on his finger. He could not speak.
                He felt <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> looking at him, as if he knew that his master was in some great trouble,
                but he could not turn towards him. He shut his eyes and struggled for a while; but
                resistance became unbearable, and at last he slowly drew out the c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>n, and slipped
                the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> on the forefinger of his left hand.</p>
            <p>Immediately, though everything else remained as before, dim and dark, the shapes
                became ter<name type="GPE">ri</name>bly clear. He was able to see beneath their black wrappings. There were
                <name type="CARDINAL">five</name> tall figures: <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> standing on the lip of the <name type="ORG">dell</name>, <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> advancing. In their
                white faces burned keen and merciless eyes; under their mantles were long grey
                robes; upon their grey <name type="PERSON">hai</name>rs were helms of silver; in their haggard hands were
                swords of steel. Their eyes fell on him and pierced him, as they rushed towards him.
                Desperate, he drew his own sword, and it seemed to him that it flickered red, as if
                it was a firebrand. <name type="CARDINAL">Two</name> of the figures halted. The <name type="ORDINAL">third</name> was taller than the others:
                his <name type="PERSON">hai</name>r was long and gleaming and on his helm was a crown. In <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> hand he held a
                long sword, and in the other a knife; both the knife and the hand that held it
                glowed with a pale light. He sprang forward and bore down on <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.</p>
            <p>At that moment <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> threw himself forward on the ground, and he heard himself crying
                aloud: O _<name type="PERSON">Elbereth</name>! <name type="PERSON">Gilthoniel</name>!_ At the same time he struck at the feet of his
                enemy. A sh<name type="GPE">ri</name>ll cry rang out in the <name type="TIME">night</name>; and he felt a pain like a dart of
                pois<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>d ice pierce his left shoulder. Even as he swo<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>d he caught, as through a
                swirling mist, a glimpse of <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> leaping out of the darkness with a flaming brand
                of wood in either hand. With a last effort <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, dropping his sword, slipped the
                <name type="ORG">Ring</name> from his finger and closed his <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght hand tight upon it.</p>

            <heading>Chapter 12</heading>
            <p>Flight to the <name type="ORG">Ford</name></p>
            <p>When <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> came to himself he was still clut<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> desperately. He was lying
                by the fire, which was now piled high and burning b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ghtly. His <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> companions
                were bending over him. <q>'What has happened? Where is the pale king?'</q> he asked
                wildly. They were too overjoyed to hear him speak to answer for a while; nor did
                they understand his question. At length he gathered from <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> that they had seen
                nothing but the vague shadowy shapes coming towards them. Suddenly to his horror <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>
                found that his master had vanished; and at that moment a black shadow rushed past
                him, and he fell. He heard <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s voice, but it seemed to come from a great
                distance, or from under the <name type="LOC">earth</name>, crying out strange words. They saw nothing more,
                until they stumbled over the body of <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, lying as if dead, face downwards on the
                grass with his sword beneath him. <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> ordered them to pick him up and lay him
                near the fire, and then he disappeared. That was now a good while ago.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> plainly was beginning to have doubts again about <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>; but while they were
                talking he returned, appea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng suddenly out of the shadows. They started, and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>
                drew his sword and stood over <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>; but <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> knelt down swiftly at his side.</p>
            <p><q>'I am not a <name type="ORG">Black</name> <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>,'</q> he said gently, <q>'nor in league with them. I
                    have been trying to discover something of their movements; but I have found
                    nothing. I cannot think why they have g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> and do not attack again. But there is
                    no feeling of their presence anywhere at hand.'</q></p>
            <p>When he heard what <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> had to tell, he became full of concern, and shook his head
                and sighed. Then he ordered <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> and <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> to heat as much water as they could in
                their small kettles, and to bathe the wound with it. <q>'Keep the fire going well,
                    and keep <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> warm!'</q> he said. Then he got up and walked away, and called
                <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> to him. <q>'I think I understand things better now,'</q> he said in a low voice.
                    <q>'There seem only to have been <name type="CARDINAL">five</name> of the enemy. Why they were not all here,
                    I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t know; but I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t think they expected to be resisted. They have drawn
                    off for the time being. But not far, I fear. They will come again <name type="TIME">another <name type="TIME">night</name></name>,
                    if we cannot escape. They are only waiting, because they think that their
                    purpose is almost accomplished, and that the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> cannot fly much further. I
                    fear, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, that they believe your master has a deadly wound that will subdue him
                    to their will. We shall see!'</q> <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> choked with tears. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Don</name>'t despair!'</q>
                said <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>. <q>'You must trust me now. Your <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> is made of sterner stuff than I
                    had guessed, though <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> hinted that it might prove so. He is not slain, and
                    I think he will resist the evil power of the wound longer than his enemies
                    expect. I will do all I can to help and heal him. <name type="ORG">Guard</name> him well, while I am
                    away!'</q> He hur<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed off and disappeared again into the darkness.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> dozed, though the pain of his wound was slowly growing, and a deadly chill was
                spreading from his shoulder to his arm and side. His f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends watched over him,
                warming him, and bathing his wound. <name type="TIME">The <name type="TIME">night</name></name> passed slowly and wea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ly. <name type="PERSON">Dawn</name> was
                growing in the sky, and the <name type="ORG">dell</name> was filling with grey light, when <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> at last
                returned.</p>
            <p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok!'</q> he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed; and stooping he lifted from the ground a black cloak that
                had lain there hidden by the darkness. A foot above the lower hem there was a slash.
                    <q>'This was the stroke of <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s sword,'</q> he said. <q>'The only hurt that
                    it did to his enemy, I fear; for it is unharmed, but all blades pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>sh that
                    pierce that dreadful <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g. More deadly to him was the name of <name type="PERSON">Elbereth</name>.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'And more deadly to <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> was this!'</q> He stooped again and lifted up a long
                thin knife. There was a cold gleam in it. As <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> raised it they saw that near
                the end its edge was notched and the point was broken off. But even as he held it up
                in the growing light, they gazed in astonishment, for the blade seemed to melt, and
                vanished like a smoke in the air, leaving only the hilt in <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>'s hand.
                    <q>'<name type="PERSON">Alas</name>!'</q> he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed. <q>'It was this accursed knife that gave the wound. Few
                    now have the skill in healing to match such evil weapons. But I will do what I
                    can.'</q></p>
            <p>He sat down on the ground, and taking the dagger-hilt laid it on his knees, and he
                sang over it a slow song in a strange tongue. Then setting it aside, he turned to
                <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and in a soft t<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> spoke words the others could not catch. From the pouch at
                his belt he drew out the long leaves of a plant.</p>
            <p><q>'These leaves,'</q> he said, <q>'I have walked far to find; for this plant does
                    not grow in the bare hills; but in the thickets away south of the <name type="FAC">Road</name> I found
                    it in the dark by the scent of its leaves.'</q> He crushed a leaf in his
                fingers, and it gave out a sweet and pungent fragrance. <q>'It is fortunate that I
                    could find it, for it is a healing plant that the <name type="ORG">Men</name> of the <name type="LOC">West</name> brought to
                    <name type="LOC">Middle-<name type="LOC">earth</name></name>. _Athelas_ they named it, and it grows now sparsely and only near
                    places where they dwelt or camped of old; and it is not known in the <name type="LOC">North</name>,
                    except to some of those who <name type="PERSON">wan</name>der in the Wild. It has great virtues, but over
                    such a wound as this its healing powers may be small.'</q></p>
            <p>He threw the leaves into boiling water and bathed <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s shoulder. The fragrance of
                the steam was refreshing, and those that were unhurt felt their minds calmed and
                cleared. The herb had also some power over the wound, for <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> felt the pain and
                also the sense of frozen cold lessen in his side; but the life did not return to his
                arm, and he could not raise or use his hand. He bitterly regretted his foolishness,
                and reproached himself for weakness of will; for he now perceived that in putting on
                the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> he obeyed not his own desire but the commanding wish of his enemies. He
                wondered if he would remain maimed for life, and how they would now manage to
                continue their journey. He fell too weak to stand.</p>
            <p>The others were discussing this very question. They quickly decided to leave
                <name type="ORG">Weathertop</name> as soon as possible. <q>'I think now,'</q> said <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>, <q>'that the
                    enemy has been wat<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g this place for some <name type="DATE">day</name>s. If <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> ever came here,
                    then he must have been forced to <name type="GPE">ri</name>de away, and he will not return. In any case
                    we are in great pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>l here after dark, since the attack of <name type="TIME">last <name type="TIME">night</name></name>, and we
                    can hardly meet greater danger wherever we go.'</q></p>
            <p>As soon as the <name type="DATE">day</name>light was full, they had some hur<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed food and packed. It was
                impossible for <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> to walk, so they divided the greater part of their baggage
                among the <name type="CARDINAL">four</name> of them, and put <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> on the pony. In the last few <name type="DATE">day</name>s the poor
                beast had improved wonderfully; it already seemed fatter and stronger, and had begun
                to show an affection for its new masters, especially for <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <name type="PERSON">Bill</name> <name type="PERSON">Ferny</name>'s treatment
                must have been very hard for the journey in the wild to seem so much better than its
                former life.</p>
            <p>They started off in a southerly direction. This would mean crossing the <name type="FAC">Road</name>, but. it
                was the quickest way to more wooded country. And they needed fuel; for <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> said
                that <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> must be kept warm, especially at <name type="TIME">night</name>, while fire would be some
                protection for them all. It was also his plan to shor<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> their journey by cutting
                across another great loop of the <name type="FAC">Road</name>: east beyond <name type="ORG">Weathertop</name> it changed its course
                and took a wide bend northwards.</p>
            <p>They made their way slowly and cautiously round the south-western slopes of the hill,
                and came in a little while to the edge of the <name type="FAC">Road</name>. There was no sign of the <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s.
                But even as they were hurrying across they heard far away <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>es: a cold voice
                calling and a cold voice answe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng. Trembling they sprang forward, and made for the
                thickets that lay ahead. The land before them sloped away southwards, but it was
                wild and pathless; <name type="PERSON">bush</name>es and stunted trees grew in dense patches with wide barren
                spaces in between. The grass was scanty, coarse, and grey; and the leaves in the
                thickets were faded and falling. It was a cheerless land, and their journey was slow
                and gloomy. They spoke little as they trudged along. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s heart was g<name type="GPE">ri</name>eved as he
                watched them walking beside him with their heads down, and their backs bowed under
                their burdens. Even <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> seemed tired and heavy<name type="PERSON">-he</name>arted.</p>
            <p>Before the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> <name type="DATE">day</name>'s <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ch was over <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s pain began to grow again, but he did
                not speak of it for a long time. <name type="CARDINAL">Four</name> <name type="DATE">day</name>s passed, without the ground or the scene
                changing much, except that behind them <name type="ORG">Weathertop</name> slowly sank, and before them the
                distant mountains loomed a little nearer. Yet since that far cry they had seen and
                heard no sign that the enemy had <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ked their flight or followed them. They dreaded
                the dark <name type="TIME">hour</name>s, and kept watch in pairs by <name type="TIME">night</name>, expecting at any time to see black
                shapes stalking in the grey <name type="TIME">night</name>, dimly lit by the cloud-veiled moon; but they saw
                nothing, and heard no sound but the sigh of withered leaves and grass. Not once did
                they feel the sense of present evil that had assailed them before the attack in the
                <name type="ORG">dell</name>. It seemed too much to hope that the <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s had already lost their trail again.
                Perhaps they were waiting to make some am<name type="PERSON">bush</name> in a narrow place?</p>
            <p>At the end of the <name type="ORDINAL">fifth</name> <name type="DATE">day</name> the ground began once more to <name type="GPE">ri</name>se slowly out of the wide
                shallow valley into which they had descended. <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> now turned their course again
                north-eastwards, and on the <name type="CARDINAL">six</name>th <name type="DATE">day</name> they reached the top of a long slow-climbing
                slope, and saw far ahead a huddle of wooded hills. Away below them they could see
                the <name type="FAC">Road</name> sweeping round the feet of the hills; and to their <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght a grey <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver
                gleamed pale in the thin sunshine. In the distance they glimpsed yet another <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver
                in a stony valley <name type="CARDINAL">half</name>-veiled in mist.</p>
            <p>"I am afraid we must go back to the <name type="FAC">Road</name> here for a while,<q>' said <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>. 'We have
                    now come to the <name type="LOC">River</name> <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>arwell, that the <name type="ORG">Elves</name> call <name type="PERSON">Mitheithel</name>. It flows down
                    out of the Et<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>moors, the troll-fells north of <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name>, and joins the
                    <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>udwater away in the <name type="LOC">South</name>. Some call it the <name type="ORG">Grey</name>flood after that. It is a
                    great water before it finds the <name type="LOC">Sea</name>. There is no way over it below its sources
                    in the Et<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>moors, except by the Last <name type="FAC">B<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge</name> on which the <name type="FAC">Road</name> crosses.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'What is that other <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver we can see far away there?'</q> asked <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>.</p>
            <p><q>'That is <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>udwater, the <name type="PERSON">Bruinen</name> of <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name>,'</q> answered <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>. <q>'The <name type="FAC">Road</name>
                    runs along the edge of the hills for many miles from the <name type="FAC">B<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge</name> to the <name type="ORG">Ford</name> of
                    <name type="PERSON">Bruinen</name>. But I have not yet thought how we shall cross that water. <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver at
                    a time! We shall be fortunate indeed if we do not find the Last <name type="FAC">B<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge</name> held
                    against us.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="DATE">Next <name type="DATE">day</name></name>, <name type="TIME">early in the <name type="TIME">morning</name></name>, they came down again to the borders of the <name type="FAC">Road</name>. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>
                and <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> went forward, but they found no sign of any travellers or <name type="GPE">ri</name>ders. Here
                under the shadow of the hills there had been some rain. <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> judged that it had
                fallen <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> <name type="DATE">day</name>s before, and had washed away all footp<name type="GPE">ri</name>nts. No horseman had passed
                since then, as far as he could see.</p>
            <p>They hur<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed along with all the speed they could make, and after <name type="QUANTITY">a mile</name> or <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> they
                saw the Last <name type="FAC">B<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge</name> ahead, at the bot<name type="PERSON">tom</name> of a short steep slope. They dreaded to see
                black figures waiting there, but they saw n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> made them take cover in a
                thicket at the side of the <name type="FAC">Road</name>, while he went forward to explore.</p>
            <p>Before long he came hurrying back. <q>'I can see no sign of the enemy,'</q> he said,
                    <q>'and I wonder very much what that means. But I have found something very
                    strange.'</q></p>
            <p>He held out his hand, and showed a single pale-green jewel. <q>'I found it in the mud
                    in the middle of the <name type="FAC">B<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge</name>,'</q> he said. <q>'It is a beryl, an elf-st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>.
                    Whether it was set there, or let fall by chance, I cannot say; but it b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ngs
                    hope to me. I will take it as a sign that we may pass the <name type="FAC">B<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge</name>; but beyond
                    that I dare not keep to the <name type="FAC">Road</name>, without some clearer token.'</q></p>
            <p>At once they went on again. They crossed the <name type="FAC">B<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge</name> in safety, hea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng no sound but
                the water swirling against its <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> great arches. <name type="QUANTITY">A mile</name> further on they came to a
                narrow ravine that led away northwards through the steep lands on the left of the
                <name type="FAC">Road</name>. Here <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> turned aside, and soon they were lost in a sombre country of dark
                trees winding among the feet of sullen hills.</p>
            <p>The hobbits were glad to leave the cheerless lands and the pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>lous <name type="FAC">Road</name> behind them;
                but this new country seemed threa<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing and unf<name type="GPE">ri</name>endly. As they went forward the
                hills about them steadily rose. Here and there upon h<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name>s and <name type="GPE">ri</name>dges they caught
                glimpses of ancient walls of st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, and the ruins of towers: they had an ominous
                look. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, who was not walking, had time to gaze ahead and to think. He recalled
                <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>'s account of his journey and the threa<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing towers on the hills north of the
                <name type="FAC">Road</name>, in the country near the <name type="ORG">Troll</name>'s wood where his <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> se<name type="GPE">ri</name>ous adventure had
                happened. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> guessed that they were now in the same region, and wondered if by
                chance they would pass near the spot.</p>
            <p><q>'Who lives in this land?'</q> he asked. <q>'And who built these towers? Is this
                    troll-country?'</q></p>
            <p><q>'No!'</q> said <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>. <q>'<name type="ORG">Troll</name>s do not build. No <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> lives in this land. <name type="ORG">Men</name>
                    once dwelt here, <name type="DATE">ages ago</name>; but n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> remain now. They became an evil people, as
                    legends tell, for they fell under the shadow of Ang<name type="PERSON">mar</name>. But all were destroyed
                    in the war that brought the <name type="LOC">North</name> <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>gdom to its end. But that is now so long
                    ago that the hills have forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> them, though a shadow still lies on the
                    land.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Where did you learn such tales, if all the land is empty and forgetful?'</q>
                asked <name type="PERSON">Pereg<name type="GPE">ri</name>n</name>. <q>'The birds and beasts do not tell tales of that son.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'The heirs of <name type="PERSON">Elen</name>dil do not forget all things past,'</q> said <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>; <q>'and
                    many more things than I can tell are remembered in <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name>.'</q>
                <q>'Have you of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> been to <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name>?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'I have,'</q> said
                <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>. 'I dwelt there once, and still I return when I may.</p>
            <p>There my heart is; but it is not my fate to sit in peace, even in the fair house of
                <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name>.'</p>
            <p>The hills now began to shut them in. The <name type="FAC">Road</name> behind held on its way to the <name type="LOC">River</name>
                <name type="PERSON">Bruinen</name>, but both were now hidden from view. The travellers came into a long valley;
                narrow, deeply cloven, dark and silent. <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>s with old and twisted roots hung over
                cliffs, and piled up behind into mounting slopes of pine-wood.</p>
            <p>The hobbits grew very weary. They advanced slowly, for they had to pick their way
                through a pathless country, encumbered by fallen trees and tumbled rocks. As long as
                they could they avoided climbing for <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s sake, and because it was in fact
                difficult to find any way up out of the narrow <name type="GPE">dale</name>s. They had been <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> <name type="DATE">day</name>s in this
                country when the weather turned wet. The wind began to blow steadily out of the <name type="LOC">West</name>
                and pour the water of the distant seas on the dark heads of the hills in fine
                dren<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g rain. By <name type="TIME">night</name>fall they were all soaked, and their camp was cheerless, for
                they could not get any fire to burn. <name type="DATE">The next <name type="DATE">day</name></name> the hills rose still higher and
                steeper before them, and they were forced to turn away northwards out of their
                course. <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> seemed to be getting anxious: they were nearly <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> <name type="DATE">day</name>s out from
                <name type="ORG">Weathertop</name>, and their stock of provisions was beginning to run low. It went on
                raining.</p>
            <p><name type="TIME">That <name type="TIME">night</name></name> they camped on a stony shelf with a rock-wall behind them, in which there
                was a shallow cave, a mere scoop in the cliff. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> was restless. The cold and wet
                had made his wound more painful than ever, and the ache and sense of deadly chill
                took away all sleep. He lay tossing and turning and lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing fearfully to the
                stealthy <name type="TIME">night</name>-noises: wind in <name type="PERSON">chin</name>ks of rock, water d<name type="GPE">ri</name>pping, a crack, the sudden
                rattling fall of a loosened st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. He felt that black shapes were advancing to
                smother him; but when he sat up he saw nothing but the back of <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> sitting
                hunched up, smoking his pipe, and wat<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g. He lay down again and passed into an
                uneasy dream, in which he walked on the grass in his garden in the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>, but it
                seemed faint and dim, less clear than the tall black shadows that stood looking over
                the hedge.</p>
            <p>In the <name type="TIME">morning</name> he woke to find that the rain had stopped. The clouds were still
                thick, but they were breaking, and pale st<name type="GPE">ri</name>ps of blue appeared between them. The
                wind was shifting again. They did not start early. Immediately after their cold and
                comfortless breakfast <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> went off al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, telling the others to remain under the
                shelter of the cliff, until he came back. He was going to climb up, if he could, and
                get a look at the lie of the land.</p>
            <p>When he returned he was not reassu<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng. <q>'We have come too far to the north,'</q>
                he said, <q>'and we must find some way to turn back southwards again. If we keep on
                    as we are going we shall get up into the Et<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name><name type="GPE">dale</name>s far north of <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name>. That
                    is troll-country, and little known to me. We could perhaps find our way through
                    and come round to <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name> from the north; but it would take too long, for I do
                    not know the way, and our food would not last. So somehow or other we must find
                    the <name type="ORG">Ford</name> of <name type="PERSON">Bruinen</name>.'</q></p>
            <p>The rest of that <name type="DATE">day</name> they spent scrambling over rocky ground. They found a passage
                <name type="CARDINAL">between <name type="CARDINAL">two</name></name> hills that led them into a valley running south-east, the direction that
                they wished to take; but towards the end of the <name type="DATE">day</name> they found their road again
                barred by a <name type="GPE">ri</name>dge of high land; its dark edge against the sky was broken into many
                bare points like teeth of a blunted saw. They had a choice between going back or
                climbing over it.</p>
            <p>They decided to attempt the climb, but it proved very difficult. Before long <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>
                was obliged to dismount and struggle along on foot. Even so they of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> despaired of
                getting their pony up, or indeed of finding a path for themselves, burdened as they
                were. The light was nearly g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, and they were all exhausted, when at last they
                reached the top. They had climbed on to a narrow saddle <name type="CARDINAL">between <name type="CARDINAL">two</name></name> higher points,
                and the land fell steeply away again, only a short distance ahead. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> threw
                himself down, and lay on the ground shive<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng. His left arm was lifeless, and his
                side and shoulder felt as if icy claws were laid upon them. The trees and rocks
                about him seemed shadowy and dim.</p>
            <p><q>'We cannot go any further,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> to <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>. <q>'I am afraid this has
                    been too much for <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. I am dreadfully anxious about him. What are we to do?
                    Do you think they will be able to cure him in <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name>, if we ever get
                    there?'</q></p>
            <p><q>'We shall see,'</q> answered <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>. <q>'There is nothing more that I can do in
                    the wilderness; and it is chiefly because of his wound that I am so anxious to
                    press on. But I agree that we can go no further to<name type="TIME">night</name>.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'What is the matter with my master?'</q> asked <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> in a low voice, looking
                appealingly at <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>. <q>'His wound was small, and it is already closed. There's
                    nothing to be seen but a cold white <name type="PERSON">mar</name>k on his shoulder.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> has been touched by the weapons of the Enemy,'</q> said <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>, <q>'and
                    there is some poison or evil at work that is beyond my skill to d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ve out. But
                    do not give up hope, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>!'</q></p>
            <p>Night was cold up on the high <name type="GPE">ri</name>dge. They lit a small fire down under the gnarled
                roots of an old pine, that hung over a shallow pit: it looked as if st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> had once
                been quar<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed there. They sat huddled together. The wind blew chill through the
                pass, and they heard the tree-tops lower down moaning and sighing. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> lay <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> in
                a dream, imagining that endless dark wings were sweeping by above him, and that on
                the wings rode pursuers that sought him in all the hollows of the hills.</p>
            <p><name type="TIME">The <name type="TIME">morning</name></name> <name type="TIME">dawn</name>ed b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght and fair; the air was clean, and the light pale and clear
                in a rain-washed sky. Their hearts were encouraged, but (hey longed for the sun to
                warm their cold stiff limbs. As soon as it was light, <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> took <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> with him
                and went to survey the country from the h<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name> to the east of the pass. The sun had
                <name type="GPE">ri</name>sen and was shining b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ghtly when he returned with more comforting news. They were
                now going more or less in the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght direction. If they went on, down the further
                side of the <name type="GPE">ri</name>dge, they would have the <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s on their left. Some way ahead
                <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> had caught a glimpse of the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>udwater again, and he knew that, though it was
                hidden from view, the <name type="FAC">Road</name> to the <name type="ORG">Ford</name> was not far from the <name type="LOC">River</name> and lay on the
                side nearest to them.</p>
            <p><q>'We must make for the <name type="FAC">Road</name> again,'</q> he said. <q>'We cannot hope to find a path
                    through these hills. Whatever danger may beset it, the <name type="FAC">Road</name> is our only way to
                    the <name type="ORG">Ford</name>.'</q></p>
            <p>As soon as they had ea<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> they set out again. They climbed slowly down the southern
                side of the <name type="GPE">ri</name>dge; but the way was much easier than they had expected, for the slope
                was far less steep on this side, and before long <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> was able to <name type="GPE">ri</name>de again. <name type="PERSON">Bill</name>
                <name type="PERSON">Ferny</name>'s poor old pony was developing an unexpected talent for picking out a path,
                and for spa<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng its <name type="GPE">ri</name>der as many jolts as possible. The spi<name type="GPE">ri</name>ts of the party rose
                again. Even <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> felt better in the <name type="TIME">morning</name> light, but every now and again a mist
                seemed to obscure his sight, and he passed his hands over his eyes.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> was a little ahead of the others. Suddenly he turned round and called to them.
                    <q>'There is a path here!'</q> he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed.</p>
            <p>When they came up with him, they saw that he had made no mistake:</p>
            <p>there were clearly the beginnings of a path, that climbed with many windings out of
                the woods below and faded away on the hill-top behind. In places it was now faint
                and overgrown, or choked with fallen st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s and trees; but at <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> time it seemed to
                have been much used. It was a path made by strong arms and heavy feet. Here and
                there old trees had been cut or broken down, and large rocks cloven or heaved aside
                to make a way.</p>
            <p>They followed the track for some while, for it offered much the easiest way down, but
                they went cautiously, and their anxiety increased as they came into the dark woods,
                and the path grew plainer and broader. Suddenly coming out of a belt of fir-trees it
                ran steeply down a slope, and turned sharply to the left round the comer of a rocky
                shoulder of the hill. When they came to the comer they looked round and saw that the
                path ran on over a level st<name type="GPE">ri</name>p under the face of a low cliff overhung with trees. In
                the stony wall there was a door hanging crookedly ajar upon <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> great hinge.</p>
            <p>Outside the door they all halted. There was a cave or rock-chamber behind, but in the
                gloom inside nothing could be seen. <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, and <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> pushing with all their
                strength managed to open the door a little wider, and then <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> and <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> went
                in. They did not go far, for on the floor lay many old b<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s, and nothing else was
                to be seen near the entrance except some great empty jars and broken pots.</p>
            <p><q>'Surely this is a troll-hole, if ever there was <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q>'Come
                    out, you <name type="CARDINAL">two</name>, and let us get away. Now we know who made the path -and we had
                    better get off it quick.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'There is no need, I think,'</q> said <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>, coining out. <q>'It is certainly a
                    troll-hole, but it seems to have been long forsaken. I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t think we need be
                    afraid. But let us go on down wa<name type="GPE">ri</name>ly, and we shall see.'</q></p>
            <p>The path went on again from the door, and turning to the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght again across the level
                space plunged down a thick wooded slope. <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>, not liking to show <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> that he
                was still afraid, went on ahead with <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> and <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> came behind, <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> on each
                side of <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s pony, for the path was now broad enough for <name type="CARDINAL">four</name> or <name type="CARDINAL">five</name> hobbits to
                walk abreast. But they had not g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> very far before <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> came running back,
                followed by <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. They both looked ter<name type="GPE">ri</name>fied.</p>
            <p><q>'There _are_ trolls!'</q> <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> panted. <q>'Down in a clea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng in the woods not
                    far below. We got a sight of them through the tree-trunks. They are very
                    large!'</q></p>
            <p><q>'We will come and look at them,'</q> said <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>, picking up a stick. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> said
                nothing, but <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> looked scared.</p>
            <p>The sun was now high, and it sh<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> down through the <name type="CARDINAL">half</name>-st<name type="GPE">ri</name>pped branches of the
                trees, and lit the clea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng with b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght patches of light. They halted suddenly on
                the edge, and peered through the tree-trunks, holding their breath. There stood the
                trolls: <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> large trolls. <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> was stooping, and the other <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> stood sta<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng at
                him.</p>
            <p><name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> walked forward unconcernedly. <q>'Get up, old st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>!'</q> he said, and broke
                his stick upon the stooping troll.</p>
            <p>Nothing happened. There was a gasp of astonishment from the hobbits, and then even
                <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> laughed. <q>'Well!'</q> he said. <q>'We are forgetting our family history!
                    These must be the very <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> that were caught by <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, quarrelling over the
                    <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght way to cook <name type="CARDINAL">thirteen</name> dwarves and <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> hobbit.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'I had no idea we were anywhere near the place!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. He knew the
                story well. <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> and <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> had told it of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>; but as a matter of fact he had never
                more than <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> believed it. Even now he looked at the st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> trolls with suspicion,
                wonde<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng if some magic might not suddenly b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng them to life again.</p>
            <p><q>'You are forgetting not only your family history, but all you ever knew about
                    trolls,'</q> said <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>. <q>'It is broad <name type="DATE">day</name>light with a b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght sun, and yet
                    you come back trying to scare me with a tale of live trolls waiting for us in
                    this glade! In any case you might have noticed that <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of them has an old
                    bird's nest behind his ear. That would be a most unusual ornament for a live
                    troll!'</q></p>
            <p>They all laughed. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> felt his spi<name type="GPE">ri</name>ts reviving: the reminder of <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>'s <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>
                successful adventure was hear<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing. The sun, too, was warm and comforting, and the
                mist before his eyes seemed to be lifting a little. They rested for some time in the
                glade, and took their mid-<name type="DATE">day</name> meal <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght under the shadow of the trolls' large
                legs.</p>
            <p><q>'Won't somebody give us a bit of a song, while the sun is high?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>,
                when they had finished. <q>'We haven't had a song or a tale for <name type="DATE">day</name>s.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Not since <name type="ORG">Weathertop</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. The others looked at him. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Don</name>'t worry
                    about me!'</q> he added. <q>'I feel much better, but I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t think I could sing.
                    Perhaps <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> could dig something out of his memory.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Come on, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'There's more stored in your head than you let
                    on about.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t know about that,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <q>'But how would this suit? It ain't
                    what I call proper poetry, if you understand me: just a bit of nonsense. But
                    these old images here brought it to my mind.'</q> Standing up, with his hands
                behind his back, as if he was at school, he began to sing to an old tune.</p>
            <p><name type="ORG">Troll</name> sat al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> on his seat of st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>,</p>
            <p>And munched and mumbled a bare old b<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>;</p>
            <p>For many <name type="DATE">a <name type="DATE">year</name></name> he had gnawed it near,</p>

            <p>In a case in the hills he dwelt al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>,</p>
            <p>And meat was hard to come by.</p>
            <p>Up came <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> with his big boots on.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Said</name> he to <name type="ORG">Troll</name>: 'Pray, what is yon?</p>

            <p><q>'My lad,'</q> said <name type="ORG">Troll</name>, 'this b<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> I stole.</p>

            <p>I've a mind to dine on thee now.'</p>
            <p>But just as he thought his dinner was caught,</p>
            <p>He found his hands had hold of naught.</p>
            <p>Before he could mind, <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> slipped behind</p>
            <p>And gave him the boot to <name type="PERSON">larn</name> him.</p>

            <p>A bump o' the boot on the seat, <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> thought,</p>

            <p>As well set your boot to the mountain's root,</p>
            <p>For the seat of a troll <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t feel it.</p>
            <p>Peel it! Heal it!</p>
            <p>Old <name type="ORG">Troll</name> laughed, when he heard <name type="PERSON">Tom</name> groan,</p>
            <p>And he knew his toes could feel it.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Tom</name>'s leg is game, since home he came,</p>

            <p>But <name type="ORG">Troll</name> <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t care, and he's still there</p>
            <p>With the b<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> he b<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>d from its owner.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Don</name>er! B<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>r!</p>
            <p><name type="ORG">Troll</name>'s old seat is still the same,</p>

            <p><q>'Well, that's a warning to us all!'</q> laughed <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'It is as well you used
                    a stick, and not your hand, <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>!'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Where did you come by that, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>?'</q> asked <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <q>'I've never heard those
                    words before.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> muttered something inaudible. <q>'It's out of his own head, of course,'</q> said
                <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'I am learning a lot about <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> <name type="PERSON">Gamgee</name> on this journey. <name type="ORDINAL">First</name> he was a
                    conspirator, now he's a jester. He'll end up by becoming a wizard � or a

            <p><q>'I hope not,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <q>'I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t to be neither!'</q></p>
            <p>In the <name type="TIME">after<name type="TIME">noon</name></name> they went on down the woods. They were probably following the very
                track that <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>, and the dwarves had used <name type="DATE">many <name type="DATE">year</name>s</name> before. After a few
                miles they came out on the top of a high bank above the <name type="FAC">Road</name>. At this point the <name type="FAC">Road</name>
                had left the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>arwell far behind in its narrow valley, and now clung close to the
                feet of the hills, rolling and winding eastward among woods and heather-covered
                slopes towards the <name type="ORG">Ford</name> and the <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s. Not far down the bank <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> pointed out
                a st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> in the grass. On it roughly cut and now much weathered could still be seen
                dwarf-runes and <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ks.</p>
            <p><q>'There!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'That must be the st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> that <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ked the place where
                    the trolls' gold was hidden. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w much is left of <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>'s share, I wonder,
                    <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>?'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> looked at the st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, and wished that <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> had brought home no treasure more
                pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>lous, nor less easy to pan with. <q>'N<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> at all,'</q> he said. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> gave
                    it all away. He told me he did not feel it was really his, as it came from
                    robbers.'</q></p>
            <p>The <name type="FAC">Road</name> lay quiet under the long shadows of <name type="TIME">early <name type="TIME">evening</name></name>. There was no sign of any
                other travellers to be seen. As there was now no other possible course for them to
                take, they climbed down the bank, and turning left went off as fast as they could.
                Soon a shoulder of the hills cut off the light of the fast weste<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng sun. A cold
                wind flowed down to meet them from the mountains ahead.</p>
            <p>They were beginning to look out for a place off the <name type="FAC">Road</name>, where they could camp for
                the <name type="TIME">night</name>, when they heard a sound that brought sudden fear back into their hearts:
                the noise of hoofs behind them. They looked back, but they could not see far because
                of the many windings and rollings of the <name type="FAC">Road</name>. As quickly as they could they
                scrambled off the bea<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> way and up into the deep heather and bilberry brushwood on
                the slopes above, until they came to a small patch of thick-growing hazels. As they
                peered out from among the <name type="PERSON">bush</name>es, they could see the <name type="FAC">Road</name>, faint and grey in the
                failing light, <name type="CARDINAL">some <name type="CARDINAL">thirty</name></name> feel below them. The sound of hoofs drew nearer. They
                were going fast, with a light _clippety-clippely-clip._ Then faintly, as if it was
                blown away from them by the breeze, they seemed to catch a dim <name type="GPE">ri</name>nging, as of small
                bells tinkling.</p>
            <p><q>'That does not sound like a <name type="ORG">Black</name> <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>'s horse!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing
                in<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>tly. The other hobbits agreed hopefully that it did not, but they all remained
                full of suspicion. They had been in fear of pursuit for so long that any sound from
                behind seemed ominous and unf<name type="GPE">ri</name>endly. But <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> was now leaning forward, stooped
                to the ground, with a hand to his ear, and a look of joy on his face.</p>
            <p>The light faded, and the leaves on the <name type="PERSON">bush</name>es rustled softly. <name type="PERSON">Clearer</name> and nearer now
                the bells jingled, and _clippety-clip_ came the quick trotting feet. Suddenly into
                view below came a white horse, gleaming in the shadows, running swiftly. In the <name type="TIME">dusk</name>
                its headstall flickered and flashed, as if it were studded with gems like living
                stars. The <name type="GPE">ri</name>der's cloak streamed behind him, and his hood was thrown back; his
                golden <name type="PERSON">hai</name>r flowed shimme<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng in the wind of his speed. To <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> it appeared that a
                white light was shining through the form and raiment of the <name type="GPE">ri</name>der, as if through a
                thin veil.</p>
            <p><name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> sprang from hiding and dashed down towards the <name type="FAC">Road</name>, leaping with a cry
                through the heather; but even before he had moved or called, the <name type="GPE">ri</name>der had reined in
                his horse and halted, looking <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name>wards the thicket where they stood. When he saw
                <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>, he dismounted and ran to meet him calling out: _Ai na vedui D�nadan! Mae
                govannen!_ His speech and clear <name type="GPE">ri</name>nging voice left no doubt in their hearts: the
                <name type="GPE">ri</name>der was of the <name type="ORG">Elven</name>-folk. No others that dwelt in the wide world had voices so
                fair to hear. But there seemed to be a note of haste or fear in his call, and they
                saw that he was now speaking quickly and urgently to <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>.</p>
            <p>Soon <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> beck<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>d to them, and the hobbits left the <name type="PERSON">bush</name>es and hur<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed down to
                the <name type="FAC">Road</name>. <q>'This is <name type="PERSON">Glorfindel</name>, who dwells in the house of <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name>,'</q> said
                <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>.</p>
            <p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Hail</name>, and well met at last!'</q> said the <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name>-lord to <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'I was sent from
                    <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name> to look for you. We feared that you were in danger upon the
                road.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Then <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> has reached <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name>?'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> joyfully.</p>
            <p><q>'No. He had not when I departed; but that was <name type="CARDINAL">nine</name> <name type="DATE">day</name>s ago,'</q> answered
                <name type="PERSON">Glorfindel</name>. '<name type="PERSON">Elrond</name> received news that troubled him. Some of my kindred, journeying
                in your land beyond the Baranduin, learned that things were amiss, and sent messages
                as swiftly as they could. They said that the <name type="CARDINAL">Nine</name> were abroad, and that you were
                astray bea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng a great burden without guidance, for <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> had not returned. There
                are few even in <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name> that can <name type="GPE">ri</name>de openly against the <name type="CARDINAL">Nine</name>; but such as there
                were, <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name> sent out north, west, and south. It was thought that you might turn far
                aside to avoid pursuit, and become lost in the <name type="LOC">Wilderness</name>.</p>
            <p>
                <q>'It was my lot to take the <name type="FAC">Road</name>, and I came to the <name type="FAC">B<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge</name> of <name type="PERSON">Mitheithel</name>, and left
                    a token there, nigh on <name type="CARDINAL">seven</name> <name type="DATE">day</name>s ago. <name type="PERSON">Thr</name>ee of the servants of <name type="ORG">Sauron</name> were upon
                    the <name type="FAC">B<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge</name>, but they withdrew and I pursued them westward. I came also upon <name type="CARDINAL">two</name>
                    others, but they turned away southward. Since then I have searched for your
                    trail. <name type="CARDINAL">Two</name> <name type="DATE">day</name>s ago I found it, and followed it over the <name type="FAC">B<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge</name>; and to<name type="DATE">day</name> I
                    <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ked where you descended from the hills again. But come! There is no time for
                    further news. Since you are here we must <name type="GPE">ri</name>sk the pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>l of the <name type="FAC">Road</name> and go.
                    There are <name type="CARDINAL">five</name> behind us, and when they find your trail upon the <name type="FAC">Road</name> they will
                    <name type="GPE">ri</name>de after us like the wind. And they are not all. Where the other <name type="CARDINAL">four</name> may be,
                    I do not know. I fear that we may find the <name type="ORG">Ford</name> is already held against us.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>While <name type="PERSON">Glorfindel</name> was speaking the shades of <name type="TIME">evening</name> deepened. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> felt a great
                wea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ness come over him. Ever since the sun began to sink the mist before his eyes
                had darkened, and he felt that a shadow was coming between him and the faces of his
                f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends. Now pain assailed him, and he felt cold. He swayed, clut<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g at <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>'s
                arm.</p>
            <p><q>'My master is sick and wounded,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> ang<name type="GPE">ri</name>ly. <q>'He can't go on <name type="GPE">ri</name>ding
                    after <name type="TIME">night</name>fall. He needs rest.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Glorfindel</name> caught <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> as he sank to the ground, and taking him gently in his arms
                he looked in his face with grave anxiety.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">B<name type="GPE">ri</name>efly <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name></name> told of the attack on their camp under <name type="ORG">Weathertop</name>, and of the deadly
                knife. He drew out the hilt, which he had kept, and handed it to the <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name>. <name type="PERSON">Glorfindel</name>
                shuddered as he took it, but he looked in<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>tly at it.</p>
            <p><q>'There are evil things w<name type="GPE">ri</name>t<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> on this hilt,'</q> he said; <q>'though maybe your
                    eyes cannot see them. Keep it, <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>, till we reach the house of <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name>! But
                    be wary, and handle it as little as you may! <name type="PERSON">Alas</name>! the wounds of this weapon are
                    beyond my skill to heal. I will do what I can � but all the more do I urge you
                    now to go on without rest.'</q></p>
            <p>He searched the wound on <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s shoulder with his fingers, and his face grew graver,
                as if what he learned disquieted him. But <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> felt the chill lessen in his side
                and arm; a little warmth crept down from his shoulder to his hand, and the pain grew
                easier. <name type="TIME">The <name type="TIME">dusk</name></name> of <name type="TIME">evening</name> seemed to grow lighter about him, as if a cloud had been
                withdrawn. He saw his f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends' faces more clearly again, and a measure of new hope
                and strength returned.</p>
            <p><q>'You shall <name type="GPE">ri</name>de my horse,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Glorfindel</name>. <q>'I will shor<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> the stirrups up
                    to the saddle-skins, and you must sit as tight as you can. But you need not
                    fear: my horse will not let any <name type="GPE">ri</name>der fall that I command him to bear. His pace
                    is light and smooth; and if danger presses too near, he will bear you away with
                    a speed that even the black <name type="PERSON">steed</name>s of the enemy cannot <name type="GPE">ri</name>val.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'No, he will not!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'I shall not <name type="GPE">ri</name>de him, if I am to be car<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed
                    off to <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name> or anywhere else, leaving my f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends behind in danger.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Glorfindel</name> smiled. <q>'I doubt very much,'</q> he said, <q>'if your f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends would be
                    in danger if you were not with them! The pursuit would follow you and leave us
                    in peace, I think. It is you, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, and that which you bear that b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ngs us all
                    in pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>l.'</q></p>
            <p>To that <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> had no answer, and he was persuaded to mount <name type="PERSON">Glorfindel</name>'s white horse.
                The pony was laden instead with a great part of the others' burdens, so that they
                now <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ched lighter, and for a time made good speed; but the hobbits began to find
                it hard to keep up with the swift tireless feet of the <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name>. On he led them, into the
                mouth of darkness, and still on under the deep clouded <name type="TIME">night</name>. There was neither star
                nor moon. Not until the grey of <name type="TIME">dawn</name> did he allow them to halt. <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>, <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>, and
                <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> were by that time nearly asleep on their stumbling legs; and even <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> seemed
                by the sag of his shoulders to be weary. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> sat upon the horse in a dark
                dream.</p>
            <p>They cast themselves down in the heather <name type="QUANTITY">a few yards</name> from the road-side, and fell
                asleep immediately. They seemed hardly to have closed their eyes when <name type="PERSON">Glorfindel</name>,
                who had set himself to watch while they slept, awoke them again. The sun had now
                climbed far into the <name type="TIME">morning</name>, and the clouds and mists of the <name type="TIME">night</name> were g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>.</p>
            <p><q>'D<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk this!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Glorfindel</name> to them, pou<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng for each in turn a little
                liquor from his silver-studded flask of leather. It was clear as sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng water and
                had no taste, and it did not feel either cool or warm in the mouth; but strength and
                vigour seemed to flow into all their limbs as they drank it. Ea<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> after that
                draught the stale bread and d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed fruit (which was now all that they had left)
                seemed to satisfy their hunger better than many a good breakfast in the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> had
                <name type="PERSON">don</name>e.</p>
            <p>They had rested rather less than <name type="CARDINAL">five</name> <name type="TIME">hour</name>s when they took to the <name type="FAC">Road</name> again.
                <name type="PERSON">Glorfindel</name> still urged them on, and only allowed <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ef halts du<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng the <name type="DATE">day</name>'s
                <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ch. In this way they covered <name type="QUANTITY">almost <name type="CARDINAL">twenty</name> miles</name> <name type="TIME">before <name type="TIME">night</name></name>fall, and came to a
                point where the <name type="FAC">Road</name> bent <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght and ran down towards the bot<name type="PERSON">tom</name> of the valley, now
                making straight for the <name type="PERSON">Bruinen</name>. So far there had been no sign or sound of pursuit
                that the hobbits could see or hear; but of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> <name type="PERSON">Glorfindel</name> would halt and lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> for a
                moment, if they lagged behind, and a look of anxiety clouded his face. Once or twice
                he spoke to <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> in the elf-tongue.</p>
            <p>But however anxious their guides might be, it was plain that the hobbits could go no
                further that <name type="TIME">night</name>. They were stumbling along dizzy with wea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ness, and unable to
                think of anything but their feet and legs. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s pain had redoubled, and du<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng
                the <name type="DATE">day</name> things about him faded to shadows of ghostly grey. He almost welcomed the
                coming of <name type="TIME">night</name>, for then the world seemed less pale and empty.</p>
            <p>The hobbits were still weary, when they set out again <name type="TIME">early next <name type="TIME">morning</name></name>. There were
                many miles yet to go between them and the <name type="ORG">Ford</name>, and they hobbled forward at the best
                pace they could manage.</p>
            <p><q>'Our pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>l will be greatest just ere we reach the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Glorfindel</name>;
                    <q>'for my heart warns me that the pursuit is now swift behind us, and other
                    danger may be waiting by the <name type="ORG">Ford</name>.'</q></p>
            <p>The <name type="FAC">Road</name> was still running steadily downhill, and there was now in places much grass
                at either side, in which the hobbits walked when they could, to ease their tired
                feet. In the late <name type="TIME">after<name type="TIME">noon</name></name> they came to a place where the <name type="FAC">Road</name> went suddenly under
                the dark shadow of tall pine-trees, and then plunged into a deep cutting with steep
                moist walls of red st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. Echoes ran along as they hur<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed forward; and there seemed
                to be a sound of many footfalls following their own. All at once, as if through a
                gate of light, the <name type="FAC">Road</name> ran out again from the end of the tunnel into the open.
                There at the bot<name type="PERSON">tom</name> of a sharp incline they saw before them a long flat mile, and
                beyond that the <name type="ORG">Ford</name> of <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name>. On the further side was a steep brown bank,
                threaded by a winding path; and behind that the tall mountains climbed, shoulder
                above shoulder, and peak beyond peak, into the fading sky.</p>
            <p>There was still an echo as of following feet in the cutting behind them; a rushing
                noise as if a wind were <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing and pou<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng through the branches of the pines. <name type="CARDINAL">One</name>
                moment <name type="PERSON">Glorfindel</name> turned and lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed, then he sprang forward with a loud cry.</p>
            <p><q>'Fly!'</q> he called. <q>'Fly! The enemy is upon us!'</q></p>
            <p>The white horse leaped forward. The hobbits ran down the slope. <name type="PERSON">Glorfindel</name> and
                <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> followed as rear-guard. They were only <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> way across the flat, when
                suddenly there was a noise of horses galloping. Out of the gate in the trees that
                they had just left rode a <name type="ORG">Black</name> <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>. He reined his horse in, and halted, swaying
                in his saddle. Another followed him, and then another; then again <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> more.</p>
            <p><q>'Ride forward! Ride!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Glorfindel</name> to <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.</p>
            <p>He did not obey at once, for a strange reluctance seized him. Checking the horse to a
                walk, he turned and looked back. The <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s seemed to sit upon their great <name type="PERSON">steed</name>s
                like threa<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing statues upon a hill, dark and solid, while all the woods and land
                about them receded as if into a mist. Suddenly he knew in his heart that they were
                silently commanding him to wait. Then at once fear and hatred awoke in him. His hand
                left the b<name type="GPE">ri</name>dle and g<name type="GPE">ri</name>pped the hilt of his sword, and with a red flash he drew
                it.</p>
            <p><q>'Ride on! Ride on!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Glorfindel</name>, and then loud and clear he called to the
                horse in the elf-tongue: _<name type="PERSON">noro lim</name>, <name type="PERSON">noro lim</name>, Asfaloth!_</p>
            <p>At once the white horse sprang away and sped like the wind along the last lap of the
                <name type="FAC">Road</name>. At the same moment the black horses leaped down the hill in pursuit, and from
                the <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s came a ter<name type="GPE">ri</name>ble cry, such as <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> had heard filling the woods with
                horror in the <name type="LOC">East</name>farthing far away. It was answered; and to the dismay of <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and
                his f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends out from the trees and rocks away on the left <name type="CARDINAL">four</name> other <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s came
                flying. <name type="CARDINAL">Two</name> rode towards <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>: <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> galloped madly towards the <name type="ORG">Ford</name> to cut off his
                escape. They seemed to him to run like the wind and to grow swiftly larger and
                darker, as their courses converged with his.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> looked back for a moment over his shoulder. He could no longer see his f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends.
                The <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s behind were falling back: even their great <name type="PERSON">steed</name>s were no match in speed
                for the white elf-horse of <name type="PERSON">Glorfindel</name>. He looked forward again, and hope faded.
                There seemed no chance of rea<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g the <name type="ORG">Ford</name> before he was cut off by the others that
                had lain in am<name type="PERSON">bush</name>. He could see them clearly now: they appeared to have cast aside
                their hoods and black cloaks, and they were robed in white and grey. <name type="PRODUCT">Sword</name>s were
                naked in their pale hands; helms were on their heads. Their cold eyes glittered, and
                they called to him with fell voices.</p>
            <p>Fear now filled all <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s mind. He thought no longer of his sword. No cry came from
                him. He shut his eyes and clung to the horse's mane. The wind whistled in his ears,
                and the bells upon the harness rang wild and sh<name type="GPE">ri</name>ll. A breath of deadly cold pierced
                him like a spear, as with a last spurt, like a flash of white fire, the elf-horse
                speeding as if on wings, passed <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght before the face of the foremost <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> heard the splash of water. It foamed about his feet. He felt the quick heave
                and surge as the horse left the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver and struggled up the stony path. He was
                climbing the steep bank. He was across the <name type="ORG">Ford</name>.</p>
            <p>But the pursuers were close behind. At the top of the bank the horse halted and
                turned about neighing fiercely. There were <name type="CARDINAL">Nine</name> <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s at the water's edge below,
                and <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s spi<name type="GPE">ri</name>t quailed before the threat of their uplifted faces. He knew of
                nothing that would prevent them from crossing as easily as he had <name type="PERSON">don</name>e; and he felt
                that it was useless to try to escape over the long uncertain path from the <name type="ORG">Ford</name> to
                the edge of <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name>, if once the <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s crossed. In any case he felt that he was
                commanded urgently to halt. Hatred again stirred in him, but he had no longer the
                strength to refuse.</p>
            <p>Suddenly the foremost <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name> spurred his horse forward. It checked at the water and
                reared up. With a great effort <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> sat up<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght and brandished his sword.</p>
            <p><q>'Go back!'</q> he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed. <q>'Go back to the Land of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>, and follow me no more!
                    ' His voice sounded thin and sh<name type="GPE">ri</name>ll in his own ears. The <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s halted, but
                    <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> had not the power of <name type="GPE">Bombadil</name>. His enemies laughed at him with a harsh and
                    chilling laughter. 'Come back! Come back!'</q> they called. <q>'To <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> we
                    will take you!'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Go back!'</q> he whispered.</p>
            <p><q>'The <name type="ORG">Ring</name>! The <name type="ORG">Ring</name>!'</q> they c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed with deadly voices; and immediately their
                leader urged his horse forward into the water, followed closely by <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> others.</p>
            <p><q>'By <name type="PERSON">Elbereth</name> and L�thien the <name type="ORG">Fair</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> with a last effort, lifting up
                his sword, <q>'you shall have neither the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> nor me!'</q></p>
            <p>Then the leader, who was now <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> across the <name type="ORG">Ford</name>, stood up menacing in his stirrups,
                and raised up his hand. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> was st<name type="GPE">ri</name>cken dumb. He felt his tongue cleave to his
                mouth, and his heart labou<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng. His sword broke and fell out of his shaking hand.
                The elf-horse reared and snorted. The foremost of the black horses had almost set
                foot upon the shore.</p>
            <p>At that moment there came a roa<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng and a rushing: a noise of loud waters rolling
                many st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s. <name type="PERSON">Dimly</name> <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> saw the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver below him <name type="GPE">ri</name>se, and down along its course
                there came a plumed cavalry of waves. White flames seemed to <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> to flicker on
                their crests and he <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> fancied that he saw amid the water white <name type="GPE">ri</name>ders upon white
                horses with frothing manes. The <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s that were still in the midst of the
                <name type="ORG">Ford</name> were overwhelmed: they disappeared, bu<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed suddenly under angry foam. Those
                that were behind drew back in dismay.</p>
            <p>With his last failing senses <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> heard c<name type="GPE">ri</name>es, and it seemed to him that he saw,
                beyond the <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s that hesitated on the shore, a shining figure of white light; and
                behind it ran small shadowy forms waving flames, that flared red in the grey mist
                that was falling over the world.</p>
            <p>The black horses were filled with madness, and leaping forward in terror they bore
                their <name type="GPE">ri</name>ders into the rushing flood. Their piercing c<name type="GPE">ri</name>es were drowned in the
                roa<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng of the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver as it car<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed them away. Then <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> felt himself falling, and
                the roa<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng and confusion seemed to <name type="GPE">ri</name>se and en<name type="LOC">gulf</name> him together with his enemies.
                He heard and saw no more.</p>

            <p>Many Meetings</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> woke and found himself lying in bed. At <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> he thought that he had slept
                late, after a long unpleasant dream that still hovered on the edge of memory. Or
                perhaps he had been ill? But the ceiling looked strange; it was flat, and it had
                dark beams <name type="GPE">ri</name>chly carved. He lay a little while longer looking at patches of
                sunlight on the wall, and lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing to the sound of a waterfall.</p>
            <p>`Where am I, and what is the time?<q>' he said aloud to the ceiling. 'In the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>use of
                    <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name>, and it is <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> o'clock in the <name type="TIME">morning</name>.'</q> said a voice. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>t is the
                <name type="TIME">morning</name> of <name type="DATE">October</name> the <name type="CARDINAL">twenty</name>-<name type="CARDINAL">four</name>th, if you <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t to know.'</p>
            <p>`<name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>!' c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, sitting up. There was the old wizard, sitting in a c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>r by
                the open window.</p>
            <p>`Yes,<q>' he said, <name type="PERSON">`I</name> am here. And you are lucky to be here, too, after all the
                    absurd things you have <name type="PERSON">don</name>e since you left home.'</q> <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> lay down again. He
                felt too comfortable and peaceful to argue, and in any case he did not think he
                would get the better of an argument. He was fully awake now, and the memory of his
                journey was returning: the disastrous `short cut' through the Old <name type="ORG">Forest</name> the
                `accident' at _<name type="PERSON">The Prancing Pony</name>_; and his madness in putting on the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> in the
                <name type="ORG">dell</name> under <name type="ORG">Weathertop</name>. While he was thinking of all these things and trying in vain
                to b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng his memory down to his ar<name type="GPE">ri</name>ving in <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name>, there was a long silence,
                broken only by the soft puffs of <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>'s pipe, as he blew white smoke-<name type="GPE">ri</name>ngs out of
                the window.</p>
            <p><q>'Where's <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>?'</q> <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> asked at length. <q>'And are the others all
                <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght?'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Yes, they are all safe and sound,'</q> answered <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. `<name type="PERSON">Sam</name> was here until I
                sent him off to get some rest, <name type="CARDINAL">about <name type="CARDINAL">half</name></name> <name type="TIME">an <name type="TIME">hour</name></name> ago.'</p>
            <p>`What happened at the <name type="ORG">Ford</name>?<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>t all seemed so dim somehow; and it
                    still does.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Yes, it would. You were beginning to fade,'</q> answered <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'The wound
                    was overcoming you at last. <name type="TIME">A few more <name type="TIME">hour</name>s</name> and you would have been beyond our
                    aid. But you have some strength in you, my dear hobbit! As you showed in the
                    <name type="ORG">Barrow</name>. That was touch and go: perhaps the most dangerous moment of all. I wish
                    you could have held out at <name type="ORG">Weathertop</name>.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'You seem to know a great deal already,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> have not spoken to the
                others about the <name type="ORG">Barrow</name>. At <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> it was too hor<name type="GPE">ri</name>ble; and afterwards there were
                other things to think about. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w do you know about it?'</p>
            <p><q>'You have talked long in your sleep, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> gently, <q>'and it
                    has not been hard for me to read your mind and memory. Do not worry! Though I
                    said "absurd" just now, I did not mean it. I think well of you-and of the
                    others. It is no small feat to have come so far, and through such dangers, still
                    bea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'We should never have <name type="PERSON">don</name>e it without <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. `But we needed
                you. I did not know what to do without you.'</p>
            <p><q>'I was delayed,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, `and that nearly proved our ruin. And yet I am
                not sure; it may have been better so.'</p>
            <p>
                <q>'I wish you would tell me what happened!'</q>
            </p>
            <p>
                <q>'All in good time! You are not supposed to talk or worry about anything to<name type="DATE">day</name>, by
                    <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name>'s orders.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>`But talking would stop me thinking and wonde<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng, which are quite as ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng,<q>'
                    said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. 'I am wide awake now, and I remember so many things that <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t
                    explaining. Why were you delayed? You ought to tell me that at least.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'You will soon hear all you wish to know,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'We shall have a
                    <name type="ORG">Council</name>, as soon as you are well enough. At the moment I will only say that I
                    was held captive.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'You?'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.</p>
            <p><q>'Yes, I, <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> the <name type="ORG">Grey</name>,'</q> said the wizard solemnly. <q>'There are many
                    powers in the world, for good or for evil. Some are greater than I am. Against
                    some I have not yet been measured. But my time is coming. The <name type="PERSON">Morgul</name>-lord and
                    his <name type="ORG">Black</name> <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s have come forth. War is prepa<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng!'</q></p>
            <p>`Then you knew of the <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s already-before I met them?'</p>
            <p>
                <q>'Yes, I knew of them. Indeed I spoke of them once to you; for the <name type="ORG">Black</name> <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s
                    are the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>wraiths, the <name type="CARDINAL">Nine</name> Servants of the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd of the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>s. But I did not
                    know that they had a<name type="GPE">ri</name>sen again or I should have fled with you at once. I heard
                    news of them only after I left you in <name type="DATE">June</name>; but that story must wait. For the
                    moment we have been saved from disaster, by <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>.'</q>
            </p>
            <p><q>'Yes,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, `it was <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> that saved us. Yet I was afraid of him at
                <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> never quite trusted him. I think, not at any rate until we met
                <name type="PERSON">Glorfindel</name>.'</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> smiled. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> have heard all about <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>,<q>' he said. 'He has no more doubts
                    now.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'I am glad,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'For I have become very fond of <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>. Well,
                    _fond_ is not the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght word. I mean he is dear to me; though he is strange, and
                    g<name type="GPE">ri</name>m at times. In fact, he reminds me of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> of you. I didn't know that any of
                    the <name type="ORG">Big People</name> were like that. I thought, well, that they were just big, and
                    rather stupid: kind and stupid like <name type="PERSON">Butterbur</name>; or stupid and wicked like <name type="PERSON">Bill</name>
                    <name type="PERSON">Ferny</name>. But then we <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t know much about <name type="ORG">Men</name> in the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>, except perhaps the
                    <name type="PERSON">Bree</name>landers.'</q></p>
            <p>`You <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t know much even about them, if you think old <name type="PERSON">Barliman</name> is stupid,<q>' said
                    <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. 'He is wise enough on his own ground. He thinks less than he talks, and
                    slower; yet he can see through a b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ck wall in time (as they say in <name type="PERSON">Bree</name>). But
                    there are few left in <name type="LOC">Middle-<name type="LOC">earth</name></name> like <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> son of <name type="ORG">Arathorn</name>. The race of the
                    <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>gs from over the <name type="LOC">Sea</name> is nearly at an end. It may be that this War of the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>
                    will be their last adventure.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Do you really mean that <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> is <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the people of the old <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>gs?'</q> said
                <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> in wonder. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> thought they had all vanished <name type="DATE">long ago</name>. I thought he was only a
                <name type="PRODUCT">Ranger</name>.'</p>
            <p><q>'Only a <name type="PRODUCT">Ranger</name>!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. `My dear <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, that is just what the <name type="PRODUCT">Ranger</name>s
                are: the last remnant in the <name type="LOC">North</name> of the great people, the <name type="ORG">Men</name> of the <name type="LOC">West</name>. They
                have helped me before; and I shall need their help in the <name type="DATE">day</name>s to come; for we have
                reached <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name>, but the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> is not yet at rest.'</p>
            <p><q>'I suppose not,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'But so far my only thought has been to get
                    here; and I hope I shan't have to go any further. It is very pleasant just to
                    rest. I have had <name type="DATE">a month</name> of exile and adventure, and I find that has been as
                    much as I <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t.'</q></p>
            <p>He fell silent and shut his eyes. After a while he spoke again. <q>'I have been

            <p><name type="ORG">`Go</name>od!<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>t is mending fast. You will soon be sound again. <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name>
                    has cured you: he has <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ded you for <name type="DATE">day</name>s, ever since you were brought
                in.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Days?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.</p>
            <p><name type="ORG">`Well</name>, <name type="CARDINAL">four</name> <name type="TIME">night</name>s and <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> <name type="DATE">day</name>s, to be exact. The <name type="ORG">Elves</name> brought you from this where
                you lost count. We have been ter<name type="GPE">ri</name>bly anxious, and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> has hardly left your side,
                <name type="DATE">day</name> or <name type="TIME">night</name>, except to run messages. <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name> is a master of healing, but the weapons
                of our Enemy are deadly. To tell you the truth, I had very little hope; for I
                suspected that there was some fragment of the blade still in the closed wound. But
                it could not be found until <name type="TIME">last <name type="TIME">night</name></name>. Then <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name> removed a splinter. It was
                deeply bu<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed. and it was working inwards.'</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> shuddered, remembe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng the cruel knife with notched blade that had vanished in
                <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>'s hands. `<name type="PERSON">Don</name>'t be alarmed!<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>t is g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> now. It has been
                    melted. And it seems that <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbits fade very reluctantly. I have known strong
                    war<name type="GPE">ri</name>ors of the <name type="ORG">Big People</name> who would quickly have been overcome by that
                    splinter, which you bore for <name type="CARDINAL">seven</name>teen <name type="DATE">day</name>s.'</q></p>
            <p>`What would they have <name type="PERSON">don</name>e to me?<q>' asked <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. `What were the <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s trying to
                    do?'</q></p>
            <p>
                <q>'They t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed to pierce your heart with a <name type="PERSON">Morgul</name>-knife which remains in the wound.
                    If they had succeeded, you would have become like they are, only weaker and
                    under their command. You would have became a wraith under the dominion of the
                    Dark <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd; and he would have tormented you for trying to keep his <name type="ORG">Ring</name>, if any
                    greater torment were possible than being robbed of it and seeing it on his
                    hand.'</q>
            </p>
            <p><q>'Thank goodness I did not realize the hor<name type="GPE">ri</name>ble danger!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> faintly. I
                was mortally afraid, of course; but if I had known more, I should not have dared
                even to move. It is a <name type="PERSON">mar</name>vel that I escaped!'</p>
            <p><q>'Yes, fortune or fate have helped you,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, `not to mention courage.
                For your heart was not touched, and only your shoulder was pierced; and that was
                because you resisted to the last. But it was a ter<name type="GPE">ri</name>bly narrow shave, so to speak.
                You were in gravest pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>l while you wore the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>, for then you were <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> in the
                wraith-world yourself, and they might have seized you. You could see them, and they
                could see you.'</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`I</name> know,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. `They were ter<name type="GPE">ri</name>ble to behold! But why could we all see
                    their horses?'</q></p>
            <p>`Because they are real horses; just as the black robes are real robes that they wear
                to give shape to their nothingness when they have dealings with the living.'</p>
            <p>`Then why do these black horses endure such <name type="GPE">ri</name>ders? All other animals are ter<name type="GPE">ri</name>fied
                when they draw near, even the elf-horse of <name type="PERSON">Glorfindel</name>. The dogs howl and the geese
                scream at them.'</p>
            <p>`Because these horses are born and bred to the service of the Dark <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd in <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>.
                Not all his servants and chattels are wraiths! There are orcs and trolls, there are
                wargs and werewolves; and there have been and still are many <name type="ORG">Men</name>, war<name type="GPE">ri</name>ors and
                kings, that walk alive under the <name type="ORG">Sun</name>, and yet are under his sway. And their number
                is growing <name type="DATE">daily</name>.'</p>
            <p>`What about <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name> and the <name type="ORG">Elves</name>? Is <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name> safe?'</p>
            <p>`Yes, at present, until all else is conquered. The <name type="ORG">Elves</name> may fear the Dark <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd, and
                they may fly before him, but never again will they lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> to him or serve him. And
                here in <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name> there live still some of his chief foes: the <name type="ORG">Elven</name>-wise, lords of
                the <name type="PRODUCT">Eldar</name> from beyond the furthest seas. They do not fear the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>wraiths, for those
                who have dwelt in <name type="WORK_OF_ART">the Blessed Realm</name> live at once in both worlds, and against both
                the Seen and the Unseen they have great power.'</p>
            <p>
                <q>'I thought that I saw a white figure that sh<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> and did not grow dim like the
                    others. Was that <name type="PERSON">Glorfindel</name> then?'</q>
            </p>
            <p>'Yes, you saw him for a moment as he is upon the other side: <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the mighty of the
                <name type="ORDINAL">First</name>born. He is an <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name>-lord of a house of p<name type="GPE">ri</name>nces. Indeed there is a power in
                <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name> to withstand the might of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>, for a while: and elsewhere other powers
                still dwell. There is power, too, of another kind in the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>. But all such places
                will soon become islands under siege, if things go on as they are going. The Dark
                <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd is putting forth all his strength.</p>
            <p>`Still,<q>' he said, standing suddenly up and sticking out his <name type="PERSON">chin</name>. while his beard
                    went stiff and straight like b<name type="GPE">ri</name>stling wire, `we must keep up our courage. You
                    will soon be well, if I do not talk you to death. You are in <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name>, and you
                    need not worry about anything for the present.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'I haven't any courage to keep up,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, `but I am not wor<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed at the
                moment. Just give me news of my f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends, and tell me the end of the affair at the
                <name type="ORG">Ford</name>, as I keep on asking, and I shall be con<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>t for the present. After that I
                shall have another sleep, I think; but I shan't be able to close my eyes until you
                have finished the story for me.'</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> moved his c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>r to the bedside, and took a good look at <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. The colour had
                come back to his face, and his eyes were clear, and fully awake and aware. He was
                smiling, and there seemed to be little wrong with him. But to the wizard's eye there
                was a faint change just a hint as it were of transparency, about him, and especially
                about the left hand that lay outside upon the coverlet.</p>
            <p>`Still that must be expected,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> to himself. <name type="PERSON">`He</name> is not <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> through
                    yet, and to what he will come in the end not even <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name> can foretell. Not to
                    evil, I think. He may become like a glass filled with a clear light for eyes to
                    see that can.'</q></p>
            <p>`You look splendid,' he said aloud. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> will <name type="GPE">ri</name>sk a b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ef tale without consulting
                <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name>. But quite b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ef, mind you, and then you must sleep again. This is what
                happened, as far as I can gather. The <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s made straight for you, as soon as you
                fled. They did not need the guidance of their horses any longer: you had become
                visible to them, being already on the threshold of their world. And also the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>
                drew them. Your f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends sprang aside, off the road, or they would have been <name type="GPE">ri</name>dden
                down. They knew that nothing could save you, if the white horse could not. The
                <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s were too swift to overtake, and too many to oppose. On foot even <name type="PERSON">Glorfindel</name>
                and <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> together could not with stand all the <name type="CARDINAL">Nine</name> at once.</p>
            <p>`When the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>wraiths swept by, your f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends ran up behind. Close to the <name type="ORG">Ford</name> there
                is a small hollow beside the road masked by a few stunted trees. There they hastily
                kindled fire; for <name type="PERSON">Glorfindel</name> knew that a flood would come down, if the <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed
                to cross, and then he would have to deal with any that were left on his side of the
                <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver. The moment the flood appeared, he rushed out, followed by <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> and the.
                others with flaming brands. Caught between fire and water, and seeing an <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name>-lord
                revealed in his wrath, they were dismayed, and their horses were st<name type="GPE">ri</name>cken with
                madness. <name type="PERSON">Thr</name>ee were car<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed away by the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> assault of the flood; the others were
                now hurled into the water by their horses and overwhelmed.'</p>
            <p><q>'And is that the end of the <name type="ORG">Black</name> <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s?'</q> asked <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.</p>
            <p><q>'No,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'Their horses must have pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>shed, and without them they
                    are c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ppled. But the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>wraiths themselves cannot be so easily destroyed.
                    <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>wever, there is nothing more to fear from them at present. Your f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends
                    crossed after the flood had passed; and they found you lying on your face at the
                    top of the bank, with a broken sword under you. The horse was standing guard
                    beside you. You were pale and cold, and they feared that you were dead, or
                    worse. <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name>'s folk met them, carrying you slowly towards <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name>.'</q></p>
            <p>`Who made the flood?' asked <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.</p>
            <p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Elrond</name> commanded it,'</q> answered <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. `The <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver of this valley is under
                his power, and it will <name type="GPE">ri</name>se in anger when he has great need to bar the <name type="ORG">Ford</name>. As soon
                as the captain of the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>wraiths rode into the water the flood was released. If I
                may say so, I added a few touches of my own: you may not have noticed, but some of
                the waves took the form of great white horses with shining white <name type="GPE">ri</name>ders; and there
                were many rolling and g<name type="GPE">ri</name>nding boulders. For a moment I was afraid that we had let
                loose too fierce a wrath, and the flood would get out of hand and wash you all away.
                There is great vigour in the waters that come down from the snows of the Misty
                <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s.'</p>
            <p>`Yes, it all comes back to me now,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>: 'the tremendous roa<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng. I thought
                    I was drowning, with my f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends and enemies and all. But now we are
                safe!'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> looked quickly at <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, but he had shut his eyes. <q>'Yes, you are all safe
                    for the present. Soon there will be feasting and merrymaking to celebrate the
                    victory at the <name type="ORG">Ford</name> of <name type="PERSON">Bruinen</name>, and you will all be there in places of
                    honour.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Splendid!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>t is wonderful that <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name>, and <name type="PERSON">Glorfindel</name> and such
                great lords, not to mention <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>, should take so much trouble and show me so much
                kindness.'</p>
            <p><name type="ORG">`Well</name>, there are many reasons why they should,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, smiling. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> am <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>
                    good reason. The <name type="ORG">Ring</name> is another: you are the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>-bearer. And you are the heir
                    of <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>, the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>-finder.'</q></p>
            <p>`Dear <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>!<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> sleepily. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> wonder where he is. I wish he was here and
                    could hear all about it. It would have made him laugh, The cow jumped over the
                    <name type="PERSON">Moon</name>! And the poor old troll!'</q> With that he fell fast asleep.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> was now safe in the Last <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>mely <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>use east of the <name type="LOC">Sea</name>. That house was, as <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>
                had <name type="DATE">long ago</name> reported, `a perfect house, whether you like food or sleep, or
                story-telling or singing, or just sitting and thinking best, or a pleasant mixture
                of them all'. Merely to be there was a cure for wea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ness, fear, and sadness.</p>
            <p>As the <name type="TIME">evening</name> drew on, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> woke up again, and he found that he no longer felt in
                need of rest or sleep, but had a mind for food and d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk, and probably for singing
                and story-telling afterwards. He got out of bed and discovered that his arm was
                already nearly as useful again as it ever had been. He found laid ready clean
                garments of green cloth that fitted him excellently. <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>oking in a mirror he was
                startled to see a much thinner reflection of himself than he remembered: it looked
                re<name type="PERSON">mar</name>kably like the young nephew of <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> who used to go tramping with his uncle in
                the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>; but the eyes looked out at him thoughtfully.</p>
            <p>`Yes, you have seen a thing or <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> since you last peeped out of a looking-glass,<q>'
                    he said to his reflection. 'But now for a merry meeting!'</q></p>
            <p>He stretched out his arms and whistled a tune.</p>
            <p>At that moment there was a knock on the door, and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> came in. He ran to <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and
                took his left hand, awkwardly and <name type="PERSON">shyly</name>. He stroked it gently and then he blushed
                and turned hastily away.</p>
            <p>`<name type="ORG">Hullo</name>, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>!' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`I</name>t's warm!<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. `Meaning your hand, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. It has felt so cold through
                    the long <name type="TIME">night</name>s. But glory and trumpets!'</q> he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed, turning round again with
                shining eyes and dancing on the floor. <q>'It's fine to see you up and yourself
                    again, sir! <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> asked me to come and see if you were ready to come down, and
                    I thought he was joking.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'I am ready,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'Let's go and look for the rest of the
                    party!'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`I</name> can take you to them, sir,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>t's a big house this, and very
                    peculiar. Always a bit more to discover, and no knowing what you'll find round a
                    corner. And <name type="ORG">Elves</name>, sir! <name type="ORG">Elves</name> here, and <name type="ORG">Elves</name> there! Some like kings, ter<name type="GPE">ri</name>ble
                    and splendid; and some as merry as children. And the music and the singing-not
                    that I have had the time or the heart for much lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing since we got here. But
                    I'm getting to know some of the ways of the place.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'I know what you have been doing, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, taking his arm. <q>'But
                    you shall be merry to<name type="TIME">night</name>, and lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> to your heart's con<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>t. Come on, guide
                    me round the corners!'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> led him along several passages and down many steps and out into a high garden
                above the steep bank of the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver. He found his f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends sitting in a porch on the
                side of the house looking east. <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>s had fallen in the valley below, but there
                was still a light on the faces of the mountains far above. The air was warm. The
                sound of running and falling water was loud, and the <name type="TIME">evening</name> was filled with a faint
                scent of trees and flowers, as if <name type="DATE">summer</name> still lingered in <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name>'s gardens.</p>
            <p>`Hurray!<q>' c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>, sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>nging up. <name type="PERSON">`He</name>re is our noble cousin! Make way for
                    <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd of the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>!'</q></p>
            <p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Hush</name>!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> from the shadows at the back of the porch. `Evil things
                do not come into this valley; but all the same we should not name them. The <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd of
                the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> is not <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, but the master of the Dark <name type="FAC">Tower</name> of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>, whose power is
                again stret<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g out over the world! We are sitting in a fortress. Outside it is
                getting dark.'</p>
            <p>`<name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> has been saying many cheerful things like that,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <name type="PERSON">`He</name> thinks
                    I need keeping in order. But it seems impossible, somehow, to feel gloomy or
                    depressed in this place. I feel I could sing, if I knew the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght song for the
                    occasion.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`I</name> feel like singing myself,<q>' laughed <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. `Though at the moment I feel more
                    like eating and d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nking!'</q></p>
            <p>`That will soon be cured,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. `You have shown your usual cunning in
                    getting up just in time for a meal.'</q></p>
            <p>`More than meal! A feast!<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <name type="PERSON">`A</name>s soon as <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> reported that you were
                    recovered, the preparations began.'</q> He had hardly finished speaking when
                they were summ<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>d to the hall by the <name type="GPE">ri</name>nging of many bells.</p>
            <p>The hall of <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name>'s house was filled with folk: <name type="ORG">Elves</name> for the most part, though
                there were a few guests of other sorts. <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name>, as was his cus<name type="PERSON">tom</name>, sat in a great
                c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>r at the end of the long table upon the dais; and next to him on the <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> side
                sat <name type="PERSON">Glorfindel</name>, on the other side sat <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> looked at them in wonder, for he had never before seen <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name>, of whom so many
                tales spoke; and as they sat upon his <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght hand and his left, <name type="PERSON">Glorfindel</name>, and even
                <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, whom he thought he knew so well, were revealed as lords of dignity and
                power. <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> was shorter in stature than the other <name type="CARDINAL">two</name>; but his long white <name type="PERSON">hai</name>r,
                his sweeping silver beard, and his broad shoulders, made him look like some wise
                king of ancient legend. In his aged face under great snowy brows his dark eyes were
                set like coals that could leap suddenly into fire.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Glorfindel</name> was tall and straight; his <name type="PERSON">hai</name>r was of shining gold, his face fair and
                young and fearless and full of joy; his eyes were b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght and keen, and his voice
                like music; on his brow sat wisdom, and in his hand was strength.</p>
            <p>The face of <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name> was ageless, neither old nor young, though in it was w<name type="GPE">ri</name>t<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> the
                memory of many things both glad and sorrowful. His <name type="PERSON">hai</name>r was dark as the shadows of
                <name type="TIME">twilight</name>, and upon it was set a circlet of silver; his eyes were grey as a clear
                <name type="TIME">evening</name>, and in them was a light like the light of stars. Venerable he seemed as a
                king crowned with many <name type="DATE">winter</name>s, and yet hale as a t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed war<name type="GPE">ri</name>or in the fulness of
                his strength. He was the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd of <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name> and mighty among both <name type="ORG">Elves</name> and <name type="ORG">Men</name>.</p>
            <p>In the middle of the table, against the woven cloths upon the wall, there was a c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>r
                under a canopy, and there sat a lady fair to look upon, and so like was she in form
                of womanhood to <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name> that <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> guessed that she was <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of his close kindred.
                Young she was and yet not so. The braids of her dark <name type="PERSON">hai</name>r were touched by no frost,
                her white arms and clear face were flawless and smooth, and the light of stars was
                in her b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght eyes, grey as <name type="TIME">a cloudless <name type="TIME">night</name></name>; yet queenly she looked, and thought
                and knowledge were in her glance, as of <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> who has known many things that <name type="DATE">the <name type="DATE">year</name></name>s
                b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng. Above her brow her head was covered with a cap of silver lace netted with
                small gems, glitte<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng white; but her soft grey raiment had no ornament save a
                girdle of leaves wrought in silver.</p>
            <p>So it was that <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> saw her whom few mortals had yet seen; <name type="PERSON">Arwen</name>, daughter of
                <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name>, in whom it was said that the likeness of L�thien had come on <name type="LOC">earth</name> again;
                and she was called <name type="ORG">Und�miel</name>, for she was the <name type="ORG">Evenstar</name> of her people. <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ng she had
                been in the land of her mother's kin, in L�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en beyond the mountains, and was but
                lately returned to <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name> to her father's house. But her brothers, <name type="ORG">Elladan</name> and
                <name type="ORG">Elrohir</name>, were out upon errantry: for they rode of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> far afield with the <name type="PRODUCT">Ranger</name>s of
                the <name type="LOC">North</name>, forgetting never their mother's torment in the dens of the orcs.</p>
            <p>Such loveliness in living thing <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> had never seen before nor imagined in his mind;
                and he was both surp<name type="GPE">ri</name>sed and abashed to find that he had a seat at <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name>'s table
                among all these folk so high and fair. Though he had a suitable c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>r, and was
                raised upon several cushions, he felt very small, and rather out of place; but that
                feeling quickly passed. The feast was merry and the food all that his hunger could
                desire. It was some time before he looked about him again or even turned to his
                neighbours.</p>
            <p>He looked <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> for his f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> had begged to be allowed to wait on his master,
                but had been told that for this time he was a guest of honour. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> could see him
                now, sitting with <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> and <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> at the upper end of <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the side-tables close
                to the dais. He could see no sign of <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>.</p>
            <p>Next to <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> on his <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght sat a dwarf of imp<name type="GPE">ortan</name>t appearance, <name type="GPE">ri</name>chly dressed. His
                beard, very long and forked, was white, nearly as white as the snow-white cloth of
                his garments. He wore a silver belt, and round his neck hung a c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>n of silver and
                diamonds. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> stopped eating to look at him.</p>
            <p><q>'Welcome and well met!'</q> said the dwarf, turning towards him. Then he actually
                rose from his seat and bowed. `<name type="PRODUCT">Gl�</name>in at your service,' he said, and bowed still
                lower.</p>
            <p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> <name type="PERSON">Baggins</name> at your service and your family's,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> correctly,
                <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing in surp<name type="GPE">ri</name>se and scatte<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng his cushions. <q>'Am I <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght in guessing that you
                    are _the_ <name type="PRODUCT">Gl�</name>in, <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the <name type="CARDINAL">twelve</name> companions of the great <name type="PERSON">Tho<name type="GPE">ri</name>n</name>
                    Oakenshield?'</q></p>
            <p>`Quite <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght,<q>' answered the dwarf, gathe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng up the cushions and courteously
                    assisting <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> back into his seat. 'And I do not ask, for I have already been
                    told that you are the kinsman and adopted heir of our f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> the renowned.
                    Allow me to congratulate you on your recovery.'</q></p>
            <p>`Thank you very much,' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.</p>
            <p><q>'You have had some very strange adventures, I hear,'</q> said <name type="PRODUCT">Gl�</name>in. <q>'I wonder
                    greatly what b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ngs _<name type="CARDINAL">four</name>_ hobbits on so long a journey. Nothing like it has
                    happened since <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> came with us. But perhaps I should not inquire too closely,
                    since <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name> and <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> do not seem disposed to talk of this?'</q></p>
            <p><q>'I think we will not speak of it, at least not yet,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> politely.</p>
            <p>He guessed that even in <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name>'s house the matter of the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> was not <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> for casual
                talk; and in any case he wished to forget his troubles for a time. <q>'But I am
                    equally cu<name type="GPE">ri</name>ous,'</q> he added, `to learn what b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ngs so imp<name type="GPE">ortan</name>t a dwarf so
                far from the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>nely <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>.'</p>
            <p><name type="PRODUCT">Gl�</name>in looked at him. <q>'If you have not heard, I think we will not speak yet of that
                    either. Master <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name> will summon us all ere long, I believe, and then we shall
                    all hear many things. But there is much else that may be told.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Thr</name>oughout the rest of the meal they talked together, but <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed more than he
                spoke; for the news of the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>, apart from the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>, seemed small and far-away and
                unimp<name type="GPE">ortan</name>t, while <name type="PRODUCT">Gl�</name>in had much to tell of events in the northern regions of
                <name type="PERSON">Wilderland</name>. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> learned that <name type="PERSON">G<name type="GPE">ri</name>m</name>beorn the Old, son of <name type="ORG">Beorn</name>, was now the lord of
                many sturdy men, and to their land between the <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s and <name type="GPE">Mirkwood</name> neither orc
                nor <name type="PERSON">wolf</name> dared to go.</p>
            <p><q>'<name type="ORG">lndeed</name>,'</q> said <name type="PRODUCT">Gl�</name>in, `if it were not for the <name type="ORG">Beorn</name>ings, the passage from <name type="ORG">Dale</name>
                to <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name> would <name type="DATE">long ago</name> have become impossible. They are valiant men and keep
                open <name type="PRODUCT">the High Pass</name> and the <name type="ORG">Ford</name> of <name type="PERSON">Carrock</name>. But their tolls are high,<q>' he added
                    with a shake of his head; `and like <name type="ORG">Beorn</name> of old they are not over fond of
                    dwarves. Still, they are trusty, and that is much in these <name type="DATE">day</name>s. Nowhere are
                    there any men so f<name type="GPE">ri</name>endly to us as the <name type="ORG">Men</name> of <name type="ORG">Dale</name>. They are good folk, the
                    <name type="PERSON">Bard</name>ings. The grandson of <name type="PERSON">Bard</name> the Bowman rules them, <name type="ORG">Brand</name> son of <name type="PERSON">Bain</name> son of
                    <name type="PERSON">Bard</name>. He is a strong king, and his realm now reaches far south and east of
                    <name type="GPE">Esgaroth</name>.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'And what of your own people?'</q> asked <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.</p>
            <p>`There is much to tell, good and bad,<q>' said <name type="PRODUCT">Gl�</name>in; 'yet it is mostly good: we have
                    so far been fortunate, though we do not escape the shadow of these times. If you
                    really wish to hear of us, I will tell you tidings gladly. But stop me when you
                    are weary! <name type="ORG">Dwarves</name>' tongues run on when speaking of their handiwork, they
                    say.'</q></p>
            <p>And with that <name type="PRODUCT">Gl�</name>in embarked on a long account of the doings of the <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Dwarf</name>-kingdom. He
                was delighted to have found so polite a lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>er; for <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> showed no sign of
                wea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ness and made no attempt to change the subject, though actually he soon got
                rather lost among the strange names of people and places that he had never heard of
                before. He was interested, however, to hear that D�in was still <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g under the
                <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>, and was now old (having passed his <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name> and <name type="ORDINAL">fiftieth</name> <name type="DATE">year</name>),
                venerable, and fabulously <name type="GPE">ri</name>ch. Of the <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> companions who had survived the <name type="EVENT">Battle</name> of
                <name type="CARDINAL">Five</name> Armies <name type="CARDINAL">seven</name> were still with him: <name type="PERSON">Dwalin</name>, <name type="PRODUCT">Gl�</name>in, Do<name type="GPE">ri</name>, <name type="PERSON">No<name type="GPE">ri</name></name>, <name type="PERSON">Bifur</name>, <name type="PERSON">Bofur</name>, and
                <name type="PERSON">Bombur</name>. <name type="PERSON">Bombur</name> was now so fat that he could not move himself from his couch to his
                c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>r at table, and it took <name type="CARDINAL">six</name> young dwarves to lift him.</p>
            <p><q>'And what has become of <name type="PERSON">Balin</name> and <name type="PRODUCT">O<name type="GPE">ri</name></name> and �in?'</q> asked <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.</p>
            <p>A shadow passed over <name type="PRODUCT">Gl�</name>in's face. `We do not know,<q>' he answered. 'It is largely
                    on account of <name type="PERSON">Balin</name> that I have come to ask the advice of those that dwell in
                    <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name>. But to<name type="TIME">night</name> let us speak of mer<name type="GPE">ri</name>er things!'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PRODUCT">Gl�</name>in began then to talk of the works of his people, telling <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> about their great
                labours in <name type="ORG">Dale</name> and under the <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>. <q>'We have <name type="PERSON">don</name>e well,'</q> he said. `But in
                metalwork we cannot <name type="GPE">ri</name>val our fathers, many of whose. <name type="ORG">sec</name>rets are lost. We make good
                armour and keen swords, but we cannot again make mail or blade to match those that
                were made before the dragon came. Only in mining and building have we surpassed the
                old <name type="DATE">day</name>s. You should see the waterways of <name type="ORG">Dale</name>, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, and the fountains, and the
                pools! You should see the st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>-paved roads of many colours! And the halls and
                cavernous streets under the <name type="LOC">earth</name> with arches carved like trees; and the terraces
                and towers upon the <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>'s sides! Then you would see that we have not been
                idle.'</p>
            <p><q>'I will come and see them, if ever I can,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w surp<name type="GPE">ri</name>sed <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>
                    would have been to see all the changes in the Desolation of <name type="ORG">Smaug</name>!'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PRODUCT">Gl�</name>in looked at <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and smiled. <q>'You were very fond of <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> were you not?'</q>
                he asked.</p>
            <p>`Yes,<q>' answered <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. 'I would rather see him than all the towers and palaces in
                    the world.'</q></p>
            <p>At length the feast came to an end. <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name> and <name type="PERSON">Arwen</name> rose and went down the hall, and
                the company followed them in due order. The doors were thrown open, and they went
                across a wide passage and through other doors, and came into a further hall. In it
                were no tables, but a b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght fire was burning in a great h<name type="LOC">earth</name> between the <name type="PERSON">carven</name>
                pillars upon either side.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> found himself walking with <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. `This is the <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>l of <name type="ORG">Fire</name>' said the wizard.
                <name type="PERSON">`He</name>re you will hear many songs and tales-if you can keep awake. But except on high
                <name type="DATE">day</name>s it usually stands empty and quiet, and people come here who wish for peace, and
                thought. There is always a fire here, all <name type="DATE">the <name type="DATE">year</name></name> round, but there is little other
                light.'</p>
            <p>As <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name> entered and went towards the seat prepared for him, elvish minstrels began
                to make sweet music. Slowly the hall filled, and <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> looked with delight upon the
                many fair faces that were gathered together; the golden firelight played upon them
                and shimmered in their <name type="PERSON">hai</name>r. Suddenly he noticed, not far from the further end of
                the fire, a small dark figure seated on a stool with his back propped against a
                pillar. Beside him on the ground was a d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nking-cup and some bread. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> wondered
                whether he was ill (if people were ever ill in <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name>), and had been unable to
                come to the feast. His head seemed sunk in sleep on his breast, and a fold of his
                dark cloak was drawn over his face.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Elrond</name> went forward and stood beside the silent figure. <q>'Awake little master. he
                    said, with a smile. Then, turning to <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, he beck<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>d to him. 'Now at last the
                    <name type="TIME">hour</name> has come that you have wished for, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>,'</q> he said. <name type="PERSON">`He</name>re is a f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end
                that you have long missed.'</p>
            <p>The dark figure raised its head and uncovered its face.</p>
            <p>`<name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>!' c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> with sudden recognition, and he sprang forward.</p>
            <p>`<name type="ORG">Hullo</name>, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> my lad!<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>. `So you have got here at last. I hoped you
                    would manage it. Well, well! So all this feasting is in your honour, I hear. I
                    hope you enjoyed yourself?'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Why weren't you there?'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <name type="PERSON">`A</name>nd why haven't I been allowed to see
                you before?'</p>
            <p>`Because you were asleep. I have seen a good deal of you. I have sat by your side
                with <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> each <name type="DATE">day</name>. But as for the feast` I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t go in for such things much now. And
                I had something else to do.'</p>
            <p>`What were you doing?'</p>
            <p>`Why, sitting and thinking. I do a lot of that nowa<name type="DATE">day</name>s, and this is the best place
                to do it in, as a rule. Wake up, indeed!<q>' he said, cocking an eye at <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name>.
                    There was a b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght twinkle in it and no sign of sleepiness that <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> could see.
                    <name type="PERSON">`Wake</name> up! I was not asleep. Master <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name>. If you <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t to know, you have all
                    come out from your feast too soon, and you have disturbed me-in the middle of
                    making up a song. I was stuck over a line or <name type="CARDINAL">two</name>, and was thinking about them;
                    but now I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t suppose I shall ever get them <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght. There will be such a deal
                    of singing that the ideas will be d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ven clean out of my head. I shall have to
                    get my f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end the D�nadan to help me. Where is he?'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Elrond</name> laughed. <name type="PERSON">`He</name> shall be found,<q>' he said. `Then you <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> shall go into a corner
                    and finish your task, and we will hear it and judge it before we end our
                    merrymaking.'</q> <name type="PERSON">Messenger</name>s were sent to find <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>'s f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end, though n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> knew
                where he was, or why he had not been present at the feast.</p>
            <p>In the meanwhile <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> sat side by side, and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> came quickly and placed
                himself near them. They talked together in soft voices, oblivious of the mirth and
                music in the hall about them. <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> had not much to say of himself. When he had left
                <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbiton he had <name type="PERSON">wan</name>dered off aimlessly, along the <name type="FAC">Road</name> or in the country on either
                side; but somehow he had steered all the time towards <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name>. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> got here without
                much adventure,' he said, `and after a rest I went on with the dwarves to <name type="ORG">Dale</name>: my
                last journey. I shan't travel again. Old <name type="PERSON">Balin</name> had g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> away. Then I came back here,
                and here I have been. I have <name type="PERSON">don</name>e this and that. I have w<name type="GPE">ri</name>t<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> some more of my
                book. And, of course, I make up a few songs. They sing them occasionally: just to
                please me, I think; for, of course, they aren't really good enough for <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name>.
                And I lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> and I think. <name type="PERSON">Tim</name>e doesn't seem to pass here: it just is. A re<name type="PERSON">mar</name>kable
                place altogether.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`I</name> hear all kinds of news, from over the <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s, and out of the <name type="LOC">South</name>, but hardly
                anything from the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>. I heard about the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>, of course. <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> has been here
                of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>. Not that he has told me a great deal, he has become closer than ever these
                last few <name type="DATE">year</name>s. The D�nadan has told me more. Fancy that <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng of mine causing such a
                disturbance! It is a pity that <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> did not find out more so<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>r. I could have
                brought the thing here myself <name type="DATE">long ago</name> without so much trouble. I have thought
                several times of going back to <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbiton for it; but I am getting old, and they would
                not let me: <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> and <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name>, I mean. They seemed to think that the Enemy was
                looking high and low for me, and would make mincemeat of me, if he caught me
                totte<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng about in the Wild.</p>
            <p><q>'And <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> said: "The <name type="ORG">Ring</name> has passed on, <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>. It would do no good to you or
                    to others, if you t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed to meddle with it again." Odd sort of re<name type="PERSON">mar</name>k, just like
                    <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. But he said he was looking after you, so I let things be. I am
                    f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ghtfully glad to see you safe and sound.'</q> He paused and looked at <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>
                doubtfully.</p>
            <p>`Have you got it here?<q>' he asked in a whisper. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> can't help feeling cu<name type="GPE">ri</name>ous, you
                    know, after all I've heard. I should very much like just to peep at it
                    again.'</q></p>
            <p>`Yes, I've got it,<q>' answered <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, feeling a strange reluctance. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>t looks just
                    the same as ever it did.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="ORG">`Well</name>, I should just like to see it for a moment,' said <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>.</p>
            <p>When he had dressed, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> found that while he slept the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> had been hung about his
                neck on a new c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>n, light but strong. Slowly he drew it out. <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> put out his
                hand. But <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> quickly drew back the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>. To his distress and amazement he found
                that he was no longer looking at <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>; a shadow seemed to have fallen between them,
                and through it he found himself eyeing a little w<name type="GPE">ri</name>nkled creature with a hungry face
                and bony groping hands. He felt a desire to st<name type="GPE">ri</name>ke him.</p>
            <p>The music and singing round them seemed to falter and a silence fell. <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> looked
                quickly at <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s face and passed his hand across his eyes. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> understand now,<q>'
                    he said. `Put it away! I am sorry: sorry you have come in for this burden: sorry
                    about everything. <name type="PERSON">Don</name>'t adventures ever have an end? I suppose not. Some<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> else
                    always has to carry on the story. Well, it can't be helped. I wonder if it's any
                    good trying to finish my book? But <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t let's worry about it now-let's have
                    some real News! Tell me all about the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>!'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> hid the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> away, and the shadow passed leaving hardly a shred of memory. The
                light and music of <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name> was about him again. <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> smiled and laughed happily.
                Every item of news from the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> that <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> could tell-aided and corrected now and
                again by <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>-was of the greatest interest to him, from the felling of the least tree
                to the pranks of the smallest child in <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbiton. They were so deep in the doings of
                the <name type="CARDINAL">Four</name> <name type="LOC">Far</name>things that they did not notice the ar<name type="GPE">ri</name>val of a man clad in dark green
                cloth. For m<name type="TIME">any minute</name>s he stood looking down at them with a smile.</p>
            <p>Suddenly <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> looked up. <q>'Ah, there you are at last, D�nadan!'</q> he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed.</p>
            <p>`<name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>!<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. `You seem to have a lot of names.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="ORG">`Well</name>, _<name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>_ is <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> that I haven't heard before, anyway,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>. `What do
                    you call him that for?'</q></p>
            <p>`They call me that in <name type="PERSON">Bree</name>,<q>' said <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> laughing, 'and that is how I was
                    introduced to him.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`A</name>nd why do you call him D�nadan?' asked <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.</p>
            <p>`_The_ D�nadan,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>. <name type="PERSON">`He</name> is of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> called that here. But I thought you knew
                    enough <name type="PERSON">Elvish</name> at least to know _d�n-udan_: Man of the <name type="LOC">West</name>, N�menorean. But this
                    is not the time for lessons!'</q> He turned to <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>.</p>
            <p>`Where have you been, my f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end? Why weren't you at the feast? The <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> <name type="PERSON">Arwen</name> was
                there.'</p>
            <p><name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> looked down at <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> gravely. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> know,<q>' he said. 'But of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> I must put
                    mirth aside. <name type="ORG">Elladan</name> and <name type="ORG">Elrohir</name> have returned out of the Wild unlooked-for, and
                    they had tidings that I wished to hear at once.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="ORG">`Well</name>, my dear fellow,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>, `now you've heard the news, can't you spare me
                    a moment? I <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t your help in something urgent. <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name> says this song of mine is
                    to be finished before the end of the <name type="TIME">evening</name>, and I am stuck. Let's go off into
                    a corner and polish it up!'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> smiled. `Come then!<q>' he said. `Let me hear it!'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> was left to himself for a while. for <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> had fallen asleep. He was al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> and
                felt rather forlorn` although all about him the folk of <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name> were gathered. But
                those near him were silent, in<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>t upon the music of the voices and the instruments.
                and they gave no heed to anything else. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> began to lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>.</p>
            <p>At <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> the beauty of the melodies and of the interwoven words in <name type="ORG">elven</name>-tongues,
                even though he understood them little` held him in a spell, as soon as he began to
                at<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>d to them. Almost it seemed that the words took shape, and visions of far lands
                and b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght things that he had never yet imagined opened out before him; and the
                firelit hall became like a golden mist above seas of foam that sighed upon the
                <name type="PERSON">mar</name>gins of the world. Then the enchantment became more and more dreamlike, until he
                felt that an endless <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver of swelling gold and silver was flowing over him, too
                multitudinous for its pattern to be comprehended; it became part of the throbbing
                air about him, and it drenched and drowned him. <name type="PERSON">Swift</name>ly he sank under its shining
                w<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name> into a deep realm of sleep.</p>
            <p>There he <name type="PERSON">wan</name>dered long in a dream of music that turned into running water, and then
                suddenly into a voice. It seemed to be the voice of <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> chanting verses. Faint at
                <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> and then clearer ran the words.</p>
            <p>E�rendil was a <name type="PERSON">mar</name>iner</p>
            <p>that tar<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed in Arvernien;</p>
            <p>he built a boat of timber felled</p>

            <p>In panoply of ancient kings,</p>

            <p>his shining shield was scored with runes</p>
            <p>to ward all wounds and harm from him;</p>
            <p>his bow was made of dragon-horn,</p>
            <p>his arrows shorn of ebony,</p>
            <p>of silver was his <name type="ORG">habergeon</name>,</p>
            <p>his scabbard of chalce<name type="PERSON">don</name>y;</p>
            <p>his sword of steel was valiant,</p>
            <p>of adamant his helmet tall,</p>
            <p>an eagle-plume upon his crest,</p>
            <p>upon his breast an emerald.</p>
            <p>Beneath the <name type="PERSON">Moon</name> and under star</p>
            <p>he <name type="PERSON">wan</name>dered far from northern strands,</p>
            <p>bewildered on enchanted ways</p>
            <p>beyond the <name type="DATE">day</name>s of mortal lands.</p>
            <p>From gnashing of the Narrow Ice</p>
            <p>where shadow lies on <name type="GPE">frozen hills</name>,</p>
            <p>from nether heats and burning waste</p>
            <p>he turned in haste, and roving still</p>
            <p>on starless waters far astray</p>
            <p>at last he came to <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Night of Naught</name>,</p>
            <p>and passed, and never sight he saw</p>
            <p>of shining shore nor light he sought.</p>
            <p>The winds of wrath came d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ving him,</p>
            <p>and blindly in the foam he fled</p>
            <p>from west to east and errandless,</p>
            <p>unheralded he homeward sped.</p>
            <p>There flying <name type="PERSON">Elwing</name> came to him,</p>

            <p>The <name type="PERSON">Sil<name type="PERSON">mar</name>il</name> she bound on him</p>
            <p>and crowned him with the living light</p>

            <p>gut on him mighty doom was laid,</p>

            <p>an errand that should never rest</p>
            <p>to bear his shining lamp afar,</p>
            <p>the Flammifer of <name type="LOC">West</name>ernesse.</p>
            <p>The chanting ceased. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> opened his eyes and saw that <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> was seated on his stool
                in a circle of lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ers, who were smiling and applauding.</p>
            <p>`Now we had better have it again,' said an <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name>.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> got up and bowed. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> am flattered, <name type="PERSON">Lindir</name>,<q>' he said. 'But it would be too
                    ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng to repeat it all.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Not too ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng for you,'</q> the <name type="ORG">Elves</name> answered laughing. <q>'You know you are
                    never tired of reciting your own verses. But really we cannot answer your

            <p>`What!<q>' c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>. 'You can't tell which parts were mine, and which were the

            <p>'It is not easy for us to tell the difference <name type="CARDINAL">between <name type="CARDINAL">two</name></name> mortals' said the <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name>.</p>
            <p><q>'Nonsense, <name type="PERSON">Lindir</name>,'</q> snorted <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>. <q>'If you can't distinguish between a Man
                    and a <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbit, your judgement is poorer than I imagined. They're as different as
                    peas and apples.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'<name type="DATE">May</name>be. To sheep other sheep no doubt appear different,'</q> laughed <name type="PERSON">Lindir</name>. `Or
                to shepherds. But Mortals have not been our study. We have other business.'</p>
            <p><q>'I won't argue with you,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>. <q>'I am sleepy after so much music and
                    singing. I'll leave you to guess, if you <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t to.'</q></p>
            <p>He got up and came towards <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'Well, that's over,'</q> he said in a low voice.
                <name type="PERSON">`I</name>t went off better than I expected. I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> get asked for a <name type="ORG">sec</name>ond hea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng.
                What did you think of it?'</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`I</name> am not going to try and guess,' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> smiling.</p>
            <p>`You <name type="PERSON">needn</name>'t,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>. <name type="PERSON">`A</name>s a matter of fact it was all mine. Except that
                    <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> insisted on my putting in a green st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. He seemed to think it
                    imp<name type="GPE">ortan</name>t. I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t know why. Otherwise he obviously thought the whole thing
                    rather above my head, and he said that if I had the cheek to make verses about
                    E�rendil in the house of <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name>, it was my affair. I suppose he was
                <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t know,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>t seemed to me to fit somehow, though I can't
                explain. I was <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> asleep when you began, and it seemed to follow on from something
                that I was dreaming about. I didn't understand that it was really you speaking until
                near the end.'</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`I</name>t _is_ difficult to keep awake here, until you get used to it;<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>. 'Not
                    that hobbits would ever acquire quite the elvish appetite for music and poetry
                    and tales. They seem to like them as much as food, or more. They will be going
                    on for a long time yet. What do you say to slipping off for some more quiet
                    talk?'</q></p>
            <p>`Can we?' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.</p>
            <p>`Of course. This is merrymaking not business. Come and go as you like, as long as you
                <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t make a noise.'</p>
            <p>They got up and withdrew quietly into the shadows, and made for the doors. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> they
                left behind, fast asleep still with a smile on his face. In spite of his delight in
                <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>'s company <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> felt a tug of regret as they passed out of the <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>l of <name type="ORG">Fire</name>.
                Even as they stepped over the threshold a single clear voice rose in song.</p>

            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> halted for a moment, looking back. <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name> was in his c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>r and the fire was on
                his face like <name type="DATE">summer</name>-light upon the trees. Near him sat the <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> <name type="PERSON">Arwen</name>. To his
                surp<name type="GPE">ri</name>se <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> saw that <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> stood beside her; his dark cloak was thrown back,
                and he seemed to be clad in <name type="ORG">elven</name>-mail, and a star sh<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> on his breast. They spoke
                together, and then suddenly it seemed to <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> that <name type="PERSON">Arwen</name> turned towards him, and
                the light of her eyes fell on him from afar and pierced his heart.</p>
            <p>He stood still enchanted, while the sweet syllables of the elvish song fell like
                clear jewels of blended word and melody. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>t is a song to <name type="PERSON">Elbereth</name>,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>.
                    `They will sing that, and other songs of <name type="WORK_OF_ART">the Blessed Realm</name>, many times to<name type="TIME">night</name>.
                    Come on!'</q></p>
            <p>He led <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> back to his own little room. It opened on to the gar dens and looked
                south across the ravine of the <name type="PERSON">Bruinen</name>. There they sat for some while, looking
                through the window at the b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght stars above the steep-climbing woods, and talking
                softly. They spoke no more of the small news of the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> far away, nor of the dark
                shadows and pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ls that encompassed them, but of the fair things they had seen in
                the world together, of the <name type="ORG">Elves</name>, of the stars, of trees, and the gentle fall of the
                b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght <name type="DATE">year</name> in the woods.</p>
            <p>At last there came a knock on the door. `Begging your par<name type="PERSON">don</name>,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, putting
                    in his head, `but I was just wonde<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng if you would be <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ting

            <p><name type="PERSON">`A</name>nd begging yours, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> <name type="PERSON">Gamgee</name>,<q>' replied <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> guess you mean that it is time

            <p><name type="ORG">`Well</name>, sir, there is a <name type="ORG">Council</name> <name type="TIME">early to<name type="DATE">morrow</name></name>, I hear and he only got <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name><name type="DATE">day</name> for

            <p>`Quite <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>,<q>' laughed <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>. `You can trot off and tell <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> that he has

                    There are no folk like hobbits after all for a real good talk. I am getting very
                    old, and I began to wonder if I should ever live to see your chapters of our

            <p><name type="DATE">Next <name type="DATE">day</name></name> <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> woke early, feeling refreshed and well. He walked along the terraces
                above the loud-flowing <name type="PERSON">Bruinen</name> and watched the pale, cool sun <name type="GPE">ri</name>se above the far
                mountains, and shine down. Slanting through the thin silver mist; the dew upon the
                yellow leaves was glimme<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng, and the woven nets of gossamer twinkled on every <name type="PERSON">bush</name>.
                <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> walked beside him, saying nothing. but sniffing the air, and looking every now
                and again with wonder in his eyes at the great h<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name>s in the <name type="LOC">East</name>. The snow was
                white upon their peaks.</p>
            <p>On a seat cut in the st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> beside a turn in the path they came upon <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> and <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>
                deep in talk. `<name type="ORG">Hullo</name>! Good <name type="TIME">morning</name>!<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>. `Feel ready for the great

            <p><name type="PERSON">`I</name> feel ready for anything,<q>' answered <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. `But most of all I should like to go
                    walking to<name type="DATE">day</name> and explore the valley. I should like to get into those pine-woods

            <p><q>'You may have a chance later,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. `But we cannot make any plans

            <p>Suddenly as they were talking a single clear bell rang out. `That is the warning bell

            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> followed the wizard quickly along the winding path back to the house;
                behind them, uninvited and for the moment forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>, trotted <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> led them to the porch where <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> had found his f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends the <name type="TIME">evening</name> before.
                The light of the clear <name type="DATE">autumn</name> <name type="TIME">morning</name> was now glowing in the valley. The noise of
                bubbling waters came up from the foaming <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver-bed. Birds were singing, and a
                wholesome peace lay on the land. To <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> his dangerous flight, and the rumours of
                the darkness growing in the world outside, already seemed only the memo<name type="GPE">ri</name>es of a
                troubled dream; but the faces that were turned to meet them as they entered were
                grave.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Elrond</name> was there, and several others were seated in silence about him. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> saw
                <name type="PERSON">Glorfindel</name> and <name type="PRODUCT">Gl�</name>in; and in a corner al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> was sitting, clad in his old
                travel-worn clothes again. <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name> drew <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> to a seat by his side, and presented
                him to the company, saying:</p>
            <p>
                <q>'Here, my f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends is the hobbit, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> son of <name type="ORG">Drogo</name>. Few have ever come hither
                    through greater pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>l or on an errand more urgent.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>He then pointed out and named those whom <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> had not met before. There was a
                younger dwarf at <name type="PRODUCT">Gl�</name>in's side: his son <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. Beside <name type="PERSON">Glorfindel</name> there were several
                other counsellors of <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name>'s household, of whom <name type="PRODUCT">Erestor</name> was the chief; and with him
                was <name type="ORG">Galdor</name>, an <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name> from the <name type="ORG">Grey</name> <name type="GPE">Haven</name>s who had come on an errand from C�rdan the
                <name type="PERSON">Shipw<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght</name>. There was also a strange <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name> clad in green and brown, <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>, a
                messenger from his father, <name type="PERSON">Thr</name>anduil, the <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g of the <name type="ORG">Elves</name> of <name type="LOC">North</name>ern <name type="GPE">Mirkwood</name>.
                And seated a little apart was a tall man with a fair and noble face, dark-<name type="PERSON">hai</name>red and
                grey-eyed, proud and stern of glance.</p>
            <p>He was cloaked and booted as if for a journey on horseback; and indeed though his
                garments were <name type="GPE">ri</name>ch, and his cloak was lined with fur, they were stained with long
                travel. He had a collar of silver in which a single white st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> was set; his locks
                were shorn about his shoulders. On a bald<name type="GPE">ri</name>c he wore a great horn tipped with silver
                that now was laid upon his knees. He gazed at <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> with sudden
                wonder.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`He</name>re,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name>, turning to <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, `is <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>, a man from the <name type="LOC">South</name>. He
                    ar<name type="GPE">ri</name>ved in the grey <name type="TIME">morning</name>, and seeks for counsel. I have bidden him to be
                    present, for here his questions will be answered.'</q></p>
            <p>Not all that was spoken and debated in the <name type="ORG">Council</name> need now be told. Much was said of
                events in the world outside, especially in the <name type="LOC">South</name>, and in the wide lands east of
                the <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s. Of these things <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> had already heard many rumours; but the tale of
                <name type="PRODUCT">Gl�</name>in was new to him, and when the dwarf spoke he lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed at<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>tively. It appeared
                that amid the splendour of their works of hand the hearts of the <name type="ORG">Dwarves</name> of the
                <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>nely <name type="LOC">Mountain</name> were troubled.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`I</name>t is now <name type="DATE">many <name type="DATE">year</name>s</name> ago,<q>' said <name type="PRODUCT">Gl�</name>in, `that a shadow of disquiet fell upon our
                    people. Whence it came we did not at <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> perceive. Words began to be whispered
                    in <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret: it was said that we were hemmed in a narrow place, and that greater
                    wealth and splendour would be found in a wider world. Some spoke of <name type="GPE">Mo<name type="GPE">ri</name>a</name>: the
                    mighty works of our fathers that are called in our own tongue <name type="GPE">Khaz</name>ad-d�m; and
                    they declared that now at last we had the power and numbers to return.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PRODUCT">Gl�</name>in sighed. `<name type="GPE">Mo<name type="GPE">ri</name>a</name>! <name type="GPE">Mo<name type="GPE">ri</name>a</name>! Wonder of the <name type="LOC">North</name>ern world! Too deep we delved there,
                and woke the nameless fear. <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ng have its vast mansions lain empty since the
                children of Du<name type="GPE">ri</name>n fled. But now we spoke of it again with longing, and yet with
                dread; for no dwarf has dared to pass the doors of <name type="GPE">Khaz</name>ad-d�m for many lives of
                kings, save <name type="PERSON">Thr</name>�r only, and he pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>shed. At last, however, <name type="PERSON">Balin</name> lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed to the
                whispers, and resolved to go; and though D�in did not give leave willingly, he took
                with him <name type="PRODUCT">O<name type="GPE">ri</name></name> and �in and many of our folk, and they went away south.</p>
            <p>"That was nigh on <name type="CARDINAL">thirty</name> <name type="DATE">year</name>s ago. For a while we had news and it seemed good:
                messages reported that <name type="GPE">Mo<name type="GPE">ri</name>a</name> had been entered and a great work begun there. Then
                there was silence, and no word has ever come from <name type="GPE">Mo<name type="GPE">ri</name>a</name> since.</p>
            <p>"Then about <name type="DATE">a <name type="DATE">year</name></name> ago a messenger came to D�in, but not from <name type="GPE">Mo<name type="GPE">ri</name>a</name> � from <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>: a
                horseman in the <name type="TIME">night</name>, who called D�in to his gate. The <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd <name type="ORG">Sauron</name> the Great, so he
                said, wished for our f<name type="GPE">ri</name>endship. <name type="ORG">Ring</name>s he would give for it, such as he gave of old.
                And he asked urgently concerning _hobbits_, of what kind they were, and where they
                dwelt. "For <name type="ORG">Sauron</name> knows," said he, "that <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of these was known to you on a
                time."</p>
            <p>'At this we were greatly troubled, and we gave no answer. And then his fell voice was
                lowered, and he would have swee<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed it if he could. "As a small token only of your
                f<name type="GPE">ri</name>endship <name type="ORG">Sauron</name> asks this," he said: "that you should find this thief," such was
                his word, "and get from him, willing or no, a little <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng, the least of <name type="GPE">ri</name>ngs, that
                once he stole. It is but a t<name type="GPE">ri</name>fle that <name type="ORG">Sauron</name> fancies, and an earnest of your good
                will. Find it, and <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> <name type="GPE">ri</name>ngs that the <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Dwarf</name> sires possessed of old shall be
                returned to you, and the realm of <name type="GPE">Mo<name type="GPE">ri</name>a</name> shall be yours for ever. Find only news of
                the thief, whether he still lives and where, and you shall have great reward and
                lasting f<name type="GPE">ri</name>endship from the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd. Refuse, and things will not seem so well. Do you
                refuse?"</p>
            <p>'At that his breath came like the hiss of snakes, and all who stood by shuddered, but
                D�in said: "I say neither yea nor nay. I must consider this message and what it
                means under its fair cloak."</p>
            <p>' "Consider well, but not too long," said he.</p>
            <p>' "The time of my thought is my own to spend," answered D�in.</p>
            <p>' "For the present," said he, and rode into the darkness.</p>
            <p>'Heavy have the hearts of our chieftains been since that <name type="TIME">night</name>. We needed not the
                fell voice of the messenger to warn us that his words held both menace and deceit;
                for we knew already that the power that has re-entered <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> has not changed, and
                ever it betrayed us of old. Twice the messenger has returned, and has g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>
                unanswered. The <name type="ORDINAL">third</name> and last time, so he says, is soon to come, before the ending
                of <name type="DATE">the <name type="DATE">year</name></name>.</p>
            <p>
                <q>'And so I have been sent at last by D�in to warn <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> that he is sought by the
                    Enemy, and to learn, if may be, why he desires this <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng, this least of <name type="GPE">ri</name>ngs.
                    Also we crave the advice of <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name>. For the <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name> grows and draws nearer. We
                    discover that messengers have come also to <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g <name type="ORG">Brand</name> in <name type="ORG">Dale</name>, and that he is
                    afraid. We fear that he may yield. Already war is gathe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng on his eastern
                    borders. If we make no answer, the Enemy may move <name type="ORG">Men</name> of his rule to assail <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g
                    <name type="ORG">Brand</name>, and D�in also.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>`You have <name type="PERSON">don</name>e well to come,' said <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name>. `You will hear to<name type="DATE">day</name> all that you need in
                order to understand the purposes of the Enemy. There is naught that you can do,
                other than to resist, with hope or without it. But you do not stand al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. You will
                learn that your trouble is but part of the trouble of all the western world. The
                <name type="ORG">Ring</name>! What shall we do with the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>, the least of <name type="GPE">ri</name>ngs, the t<name type="GPE">ri</name>fle that <name type="ORG">Sauron</name>
                fancies? That is the doom that we must deem.</p>
            <p>`That is the purpose for which you are called hither. Called, I say. though I have
                not called you to me, strangers from distant lands. You have come and are here met,
                in this very <name type="GPE">nick</name> of time, by chance as it may seem. Yet it is not so. Believe
                rather that it is so ordered that we, who sit here, and n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> others, must now find
                counsel for the pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>l of the world.</p>
            <p>`Now, therefore, things shall be openly spoken that have been hidden from all but a
                few until this <name type="DATE">day</name>. And <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>, so that all may understand what is the pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>l, the
                Tale of the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> shall be told from the beginning even to this present. And I will
                begin that tale, though others shall end it.'</p>
            <p>Then all lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed while <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name> in his clear voice spoke of <name type="ORG">Sauron</name> and the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>s of
                <name type="ORG">Power</name>, and their forging in the <name type="ORDINAL">Second</name> Age of the world <name type="DATE">long ago</name>. A part of his tale
                was known to some there, but the full tale to n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, and many eyes were turned t=
                <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name> in fear and wonder as he told of the <name type="ORG">Elven</name>-smiths of <name type="ORG">Eregion</name> and their
                f<name type="GPE">ri</name>endship with <name type="GPE">Mo<name type="GPE">ri</name>a</name>, and their eagerness for knowledge, by which <name type="ORG">Sauron</name> ensnared
                them. For in that time he was not yet evil to behold, and they received his aid and
                grew mighty in craft, whereas he learned all their <name type="ORG">sec</name>rets, and betrayed them, and
                forged <name type="ORG">sec</name>retly in the <name type="LOC">Mountain</name> of <name type="ORG">Fire</name> the <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> <name type="ORG">Ring</name> to be their master. But
                <name type="ORG">Celeb<name type="GPE">ri</name>mbor</name> was aware of him, and hid the <name type="PERSON">Thr</name>ee which he had made; and there was
                war, and the land was laid waste, and the gate of <name type="GPE">Mo<name type="GPE">ri</name>a</name> was shut.</p>
            <p>Then through <name type="DATE">all <name type="DATE">the <name type="DATE">year</name></name>s</name> that followed he traced the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>; but since that history
                is elsewhere recounted, even as <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name> himself set it down in his books of lore, it
                is not here recalled. For it is a long tale, full of deeds great and ter<name type="GPE">ri</name>ble, and
                b<name type="GPE">ri</name>efly though <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name> spoke, the sun rode up the sky, and the <name type="TIME">morning</name> was passing
                ere he ceased.</p>
            <p>Of N�menor he spoke, its glory and its fall, and the return of the <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>gs of <name type="ORG">Men</name> to
                <name type="LOC">Middle-<name type="LOC">earth</name></name> out of the deeps of the <name type="LOC">Sea</name>, borne upon the wings of storm. Then
                <name type="PERSON">Elen</name>dil the Tall and his mighty sons, <name type="ORG">Isildur</name> and An�<name type="GPE">ri</name>on, became great lords; and
                the <name type="LOC">North</name>-realm they made in <name type="PERSON">Arnor</name>, and the <name type="LOC">South</name>-realm in <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> above the mouths
                of <name type="GPE">Anduin</name>. But <name type="ORG">Sauron</name> of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> assailed them, and they made <name type="ORG">the Last Alliance</name> of
                <name type="ORG">Elves</name> and <name type="ORG">Men</name>, and the hosts of <name type="PERSON">Gil-galad</name> and <name type="PERSON">Elen</name>dil were mustered in <name type="PERSON">Arnor</name>.</p>
            <p>Thereupon <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name> paused a while and sighed. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> remember well the splendour of their
                    banners,<q>' he said. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>t recalled to me the glory of the <name type="DATE">Elder Days</name> and the
                    hosts of Bele<name type="GPE">ri</name>and, so many great p<name type="GPE">ri</name>nces and captains were assembled. And yet
                    not so many, nor so fair, as when <name type="PERSON">Thangorod<name type="GPE">ri</name>m</name> was broken, and the <name type="ORG">Elves</name> deemed
                    that evil was ended for ever, and it was not so.'</q></p>
            <p>`You remember?<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, speaking his thought aloud in his astonishment. `But I
                    thought,'</q> he stammered as <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name> turned towards him, <q>'I thought that the
                    fall of <name type="PERSON">Gil-galad</name> was a long age ago.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'So it was indeed,'</q> answered <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name> gravely. `But my memory reaches back even
                to the <name type="DATE">Elder Days</name>. E�rendil was my sire, who was born in <name type="PERSON">Gon<name type="PERSON">dol</name>in</name> before its fall;
                and my mother was <name type="PERSON">Elwing</name>, daughter of <name type="ORG">Dior</name>, son of L�thien of <name type="PERSON">Do<name type="GPE">ri</name>ath</name>. I have seen
                <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> ages in the <name type="LOC">West</name> of the world, and many defeats, and many fruitless
                victo<name type="GPE">ri</name>es.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`I</name> was the herald of <name type="PERSON">Gil-galad</name> and <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ched with his host. I was at the <name type="EVENT">Battle</name> of
                <name type="PERSON">Dagorlad</name> before the <name type="ORG">Black</name> <name type="FAC">Gate</name> of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>, where we had the mastery: for the Spear of
                <name type="PERSON">Gil-galad</name> and the <name type="PRODUCT">Sword</name> of <name type="PERSON">Elen</name>dil, <name type="PERSON">Aiglos</name> and <name type="ORG">Narsil</name>, n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> could withstand. I
                beheld the last combat on the slopes of <name type="LOC">Orodruin</name>, where <name type="PERSON">Gil-galad</name> died, and <name type="PERSON">Elen</name>dil
                fell, and <name type="ORG">Narsil</name> broke beneath him; but <name type="ORG">Sauron</name> himself was overthrown, and <name type="ORG">Isildur</name>
                cut the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> from his hand with the hilt-shard of his father's sword, and took it
                for his own.'</p>
            <p>At this the stranger, <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>, broke in. `So that is what became of the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>!<q>' he
                    c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>f ever such a tale was told in the <name type="LOC">South</name>, it has long been forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>. I
                    have heard of the Great <name type="ORG">Ring</name> of him that we do not name; but we believed that it
                    pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>shed from the world in the ruin of his <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> realm. <name type="ORG">Isildur</name> took it! That is
                    tidings indeed.'</q></p>
            <p>`<name type="PERSON">Alas</name>! yes,' said <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name>. `<name type="ORG">Isildur</name> took it, as should not have been. It should have
                been cast then into <name type="LOC">Orodruin</name>'s fire nigh at hand where it was made. But few <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ked
                what <name type="ORG">Isildur</name> did. He al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> stood by his father in that last mortal contest; and by
                <name type="PERSON">Gil-galad</name> only C�rdan stood, and I. But <name type="ORG">Isildur</name> would not lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> to our counsel.</p>
            <p>' "This I will have as weregild for my father, and my brother," he said; and
                therefore whether we would or no, he took it to treasure it. But soon he was
                betrayed by it to his death; and so it is named in the <name type="LOC">North</name> <name type="ORG">Isildur</name>'s Bane. Yet
                death maybe was better than what else might have befallen him.</p>
            <p>'Only to the <name type="LOC">North</name> did these tidings come, and only to a few. Small wonder it is that
                you have not heard them, <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>. From the ruin of the <name type="PERSON">Gladden Fields</name>, where <name type="ORG">Isildur</name>
                pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>shed, <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> men only came ever back over the mountains after long <name type="PERSON">wan</name>de<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng. <name type="CARDINAL">One</name>
                of these was <name type="LOC">Ohtar</name>, the esquire of <name type="ORG">Isildur</name>, who bore the shards of the sword of
                <name type="PERSON">Elen</name>dil; and he brought them to <name type="GPE">Valandil</name>, the heir of <name type="ORG">Isildur</name>, who being but a child
                had remained here in <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name>. But <name type="ORG">Narsil</name> was broken and its light extinguished,
                and it has not yet been forged again.</p>
            <p>`Fruitless did I call the victory of <name type="ORG">the Last Alliance</name>? Not wholly so, yet it did not
                achieve its end. <name type="ORG">Sauron</name> was diminished, but not destroyed. His <name type="ORG">Ring</name> was lost but not
                unmade. <name type="FAC">The Dark <name type="FAC">Tower</name></name> was broken, but its foundations were not removed; for they
                were made with the power of the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>, and while it remains they will endure. Many
                <name type="ORG">Elves</name> and many mighty <name type="ORG">Men</name>, and many of their f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends. had pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>shed in the war.
                An�<name type="GPE">ri</name>on was slain, and <name type="ORG">Isildur</name> was slain; and <name type="PERSON">Gil-galad</name> and <name type="PERSON">Elen</name>dil were no more.
                Never again shall there be any such league of <name type="ORG">Elves</name> and <name type="ORG">Men</name>; for <name type="ORG">Men</name> multiply and
                the <name type="ORDINAL">First</name>born decrease, and the <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> kindreds are estranged. And ever since that <name type="DATE">day</name>
                the race of N�menor has decayed, and <name type="DATE">the span of their <name type="DATE">year</name>s</name> has lessened.</p>
            <p>'In the <name type="LOC">North</name> after the war and the slaughter of the <name type="PERSON">Gladden Fields</name> the <name type="ORG">Men</name> of
                <name type="LOC">West</name>ernesse were diminished, and their city of <name type="PERSON">Ann�minas</name> beside <name type="PERSON">Lake Evendim</name> fell
                into ruin; and the heirs of <name type="GPE">Valandil</name> removed and dwelt at <name type="GPE">Fornost</name> on the high <name type="LOC">North</name>
                <name type="LOC">Downs</name>, and that now too is desolate. <name type="ORG">Men</name> call it Deadmen's <name type="PERSON">Dike</name>, and they fear to
                tread there. For the folk of <name type="PERSON">Arnor</name> dwindled, and their foes devoured them, and their
                lordship passed, leaving only green mounds in the grassy hills.</p>
            <p>'In the <name type="LOC">South</name> the realm of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> long endured; and for a while its splendour grew,
                recalling somewhat of the might of N�menor, ere it fell. High towers that people
                built, and strong places. and havens of many ships; and the <name type="PERSON">winged crown</name> of the
                <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>gs of <name type="ORG">Men</name> was held in awe by folk of many tongues. Their chief city was
                <name type="NORP">Osgiliath</name>, <name type="ORG">Citadel</name> of the <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Stars</name>. through the midst of which the <name type="LOC">River</name> flowed. And
                Minas <name type="ORG">Ithil</name> they built, <name type="FAC">Tower</name> of the Rising <name type="PERSON">Moon</name>, eastward upon a shoulder of the
                <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s of <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>; and westward at the feet of the White <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s Minas <name type="GPE">Anor</name> they
                made, <name type="FAC">Tower</name> of the Setting <name type="ORG">Sun</name>. There in the courts of the <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>g grew a white tree,
                from the seed of that tree which <name type="ORG">Isildur</name> brought over the deep waters, and the seed
                of that tree before came from <name type="PRODUCT">Eress</name>�a, and before that out of the Uttermost <name type="LOC">West</name> in
                the Day before <name type="DATE">day</name>s when the world was young.</p>
            <p>`But in the wea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng of the swift <name type="DATE">year</name>s of <name type="LOC">Middle-<name type="LOC">earth</name></name> the line of <name type="ORG">Men</name>eldil son of
                An�<name type="GPE">ri</name>on failed, and the <name type="PERSON">Tree</name> withered, and the blood of the <name type="ORG">N�menoreans</name> became
                mingled with that of lesser men. Then the watch upon the walls of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> slept, and
                dark things crept back to <name type="PERSON">Gorgoroth</name>. And on a time evil things came forth, and they
                took Minas <name type="ORG">Ithil</name> and abode in it, and they made it into a place of dread; and it is
                called Minas <name type="PERSON">Morgul</name>, the <name type="FAC">Tower</name> of Sorcery. Then Minas <name type="GPE">Anor</name> was named anew Minas
                <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name>, the <name type="FAC">Tower</name> of <name type="ORG">Guard</name>; and these <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> cities were ever at war, but <name type="NORP">Osgiliath</name>
                which lay between was deserted and in its ruins shadows walked.</p>
            <p>
                <q>'So it has been for many lives of men. But the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rds of Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name> still fight
                    on, defying our enemies, keeping the passage of the <name type="LOC">River</name> from <name type="PERSON">Argonath</name> to the
                    <name type="LOC">Sea</name>. And now that part of the tale that I shall tell is drawn to its close. For
                    in the <name type="DATE">day</name>s of <name type="ORG">Isildur</name> the Ruling <name type="ORG">Ring</name> passed out of all knowledge, and the
                    <name type="PERSON">Thr</name>ee were released from its dominion. But now in this latter <name type="DATE">day</name> they are in
                    pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>l once more, for to our sorrow the <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> has been found. Others shall speak of
                    its finding, for in that I played small part.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>He ceased, but at once <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> stood up, tall and proud, before them. Give me leave,
                Master <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name>, said he, <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> to say more of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>; for ve<name type="GPE">ri</name>ly from the land of
                <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> I am come. And it would be well for all to know what passes there. For few, I
                deem, know of our deeds, and therefore guess little of their pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>l, if we should
                fail at last.</p>
            <p>`Believe not that in the land of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> the blood of N�menor is spent, nor all its
                p<name type="GPE">ri</name>de and dignity forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>. By our valour the wild folk of the <name type="LOC">East</name> are still
                restrained, and the terror of <name type="PERSON">Morgul</name> kept at bay; and thus al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> are peace and
                freedom maintained in the lands behind us, bulwark of the <name type="LOC">West</name>. But if the passages
                of the <name type="LOC">River</name> should be won, what then?</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`Yet</name> that <name type="TIME">hour</name>, maybe, is not now far away. The Nameless Enemy has a<name type="GPE">ri</name>sen again.
                Smoke <name type="GPE">ri</name>ses once more from <name type="LOC">Orodruin</name> that we call <name type="LOC">Mount Doom</name>. The power of the <name type="ORG">Black</name>
                Land grows and we are hard beset. When the Enemy returned our folk were d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ven from
                <name type="ORG">Ithil</name>ien, our fair domain east of the <name type="LOC">River</name>, though we kept a foothold there and
                strength of arms. But <name type="DATE">this very <name type="DATE">year</name></name>, in the <name type="DATE">day</name>s of <name type="DATE">June</name>, sudden war came upon us
                out of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>, and we were swept away. We were outnumbered, for <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> has allied
                itself with the <name type="LOC">East</name>erlings and the cruel <name type="ORG">Harad</name><name type="GPE">ri</name>m; but it was not by numbers that
                we were defeated. A power was there that we have not felt before.</p>
            <p>`Some said that it could be seen, like a great black horseman, a dark shadow under
                the moon. Wherever he came a madness filled our foes, but fear fell on our boldest,
                so that horse and man gave way and fled. Only a remnant of our eastern force came
                back, destroying the last b<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge that still stood amid the ruins of <name type="NORP">Osgiliath</name>.</p>
            <p>'I was in the company that held the b<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge, until it was cast down behind us. <name type="CARDINAL">Four</name>
                only were saved by swimming: my brother and myself and <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> others. But still we
                fight on, holding all the west shores of <name type="GPE">Anduin</name>; and those who shelter behind us
                give us praise, if ever they hear our name: much praise but little help. Only from
                <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> now will any men <name type="GPE">ri</name>de to us when we call.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`I</name>n this evil <name type="TIME">hour</name> I have come on an errand over many dangerous leagues to <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name>: a
                <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name> and <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> <name type="DATE">day</name>s I have journeyed all al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. But I do not seek allies in war.
                The might of <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name> is in wisdom not in weapons, it is said. I come to ask for
                counsel and the unravelling of hard words. For on the eve of the sudden assault a
                dream came to my brother in a troubled sleep; and afterwards a like dream came oft
                to him again, and once to me.</p>
            <p>'In that dream I thought the eastern sky grew dark and there was a growing thunder,
                but in the <name type="LOC">West</name> a pale light lingered, and out of it I heard a voice, remote but
                clear, crying:</p>
            <p>Seek for the <name type="PRODUCT">Sword</name> that was broken:</p>
            <p>In <name type="GPE">Imlad<name type="GPE">ri</name>s</name> it dwells;</p>
            <p>There shall be counsels taken</p>
            <p>Stronger than <name type="PERSON">Morgul</name>-spells.</p>
            <p>There shall be shown a token</p>
            <p>That Doom is near at hand,</p>
            <p>For <name type="ORG">Isildur</name>'s Bane shall waken,</p>
            <p>And the <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>fling forth shall stand.</p>
            <p>Of these words we could understand little, and we spoke to our father, <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name>, <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd
                of Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name>, wise in the lore of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>. This only would he say, that <name type="GPE">Imlad<name type="GPE">ri</name>s</name>
                was of old the name among the <name type="ORG">Elves</name> of a far northern <name type="GPE">dale</name>, where <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name> the
                <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>f<name type="ORG">elven</name> dwelt, greatest of lore-masters. Therefore my brother, seeing how
                desperate was our need, was eager to heed the dream and seek for <name type="GPE">Imlad<name type="GPE">ri</name>s</name>; but since
                the way was full of doubt and danger, I took the journey upon myself. <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>th was my
                father to give me leave, and long have I <name type="PERSON">wan</name>dered by roads forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>, seeking the
                house of <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name>, of which many had heard, but few knew where it lay.'</p>
            <p><q>'And here in the house of <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name> more shall be made clear to you' said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>,
                    standing up. He cast his sword upon the table that stood before <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name>, and the
                    blade was in <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> pieces. <name type="PERSON">`He</name>re is the <name type="PRODUCT">Sword</name> that was Broken!'</q> he said.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`A</name>nd who are you, and what have you to do with Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name>?' asked <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>, looking
                in wonder at the lean face of the <name type="PRODUCT">Ranger</name> and his weather-stained cloak.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`He</name> is <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> son of <name type="ORG">Arathorn</name>,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name>; `and he is descended through many
                    fathers from <name type="ORG">Isildur</name> <name type="PERSON">Elen</name>dil's son of Minas <name type="ORG">Ithil</name>. He is the Chief of the
                    D�nedain in the <name type="LOC">North</name>, and few are now left of that folk.'</q></p>
            <p>`Then it belongs to you, and not to me at all!' c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> in amazement, sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>nging
                to his feet, as if he expected the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> to be demanded at once.</p>
            <p><q>'It does not belong to either of us,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>; `but it has been ordained
                that you should hold it for a while.'</p>
            <p><q>'B<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng out the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> solemnly. `The time has come. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>ld
                it up, and then <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> will understand the remainder of his <name type="GPE">ri</name>ddle.'</p>
            <p>There was a hush, and all turned their eyes on <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. He was shaken by a sudden shame
                and fear; and he felt a great reluctance to reveal the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>, and a loathing of its
                touch. He wished he was far away. The <name type="ORG">Ring</name> gleamed and flickered as he held it up
                before them in his trembling hand.</p>
            <p><q>'Behold <name type="ORG">Isildur</name>'s Bane!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name>.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>'s eyes glinted as he gazed at the golden thing. `The <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>fling!<q>' he
                    muttered. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>s then the doom of Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name> come at last? But why then should we
                    seek a broken sword?'</q></p>
            <p><q>'The words were not _the doom of Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name>_,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. `But doom and
                great deeds are indeed at hand. For the <name type="PRODUCT">Sword</name> that was Broken is the <name type="PRODUCT">Sword</name> of
                <name type="PERSON">Elen</name>dil that broke beneath him when he fell. It has been treasured by his heirs when
                all other heirlooms were lost; for it was spoken of old among us that it should be
                made again when the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>, <name type="ORG">Isildur</name>'s Bane, was found. Now you have seen the sword
                that you have sought, what would you ask? Do you wish for the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>use of <name type="PERSON">Elen</name>dil to
                return to the Land of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>?'</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`I</name> was not sent to beg any boon, but to seek only the meaning of a <name type="GPE">ri</name>ddle,<q>'
                    answered <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> proudly. <name type="PERSON">`Yet</name> we are hard pressed, and the <name type="PRODUCT">Sword</name> of <name type="PERSON">Elen</name>dil
                    would be a help beyond our hope-if such a thing could indeed return out of the
                    shadows of the past.'</q> He looked again at <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>, and doubt was in his
                eyes.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> felt <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> stir impatiently at his side. Evidently he was annoyed on his
                f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end's be<name type="CARDINAL">half</name>. Standing suddenly up he burst out:</p>
            <p>All that is gold does not glitter,</p>
            <p>Not all those who <name type="PERSON">wan</name>der are lost;</p>
            <p>The old that is strong does not wither,</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Deep</name> roots are not reached by the frost.</p>
            <p>From the ashes a fire shall be woken,</p>
            <p>A light from the shadows shall sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng;</p>
            <p>Renewed shall be blade that was broken:</p>
            <p>The crownless again shall be king._</p>
            <p>`Not very good perhaps, but to the point � if you need more beyond the word of
                <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name>. If that was worth a journey of <name type="CARDINAL">a <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name></name> and <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> <name type="DATE">day</name>s to hear, you had best
                lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> to it.' He sat down with a snort.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`I</name> made that up myself,<q>' he whispered to <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, `for the D�nadan, a long time ago
                    when he <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> told me about himself. I almost wish that my adventures were not
                    over, and that I could go with him when his <name type="DATE">day</name> comes.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> smiled at him; then he turned to <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> again. `For my part I forgive your
                doubt,' he said. 'Little do I resemble the figures of <name type="PERSON">Elen</name>dil and <name type="ORG">Isildur</name> as they
                stand <name type="PERSON">carven</name> in their majesty in the halls of <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name>. I am but the heir of
                <name type="ORG">Isildur</name>, not <name type="ORG">Isildur</name> himself. I have had a hard life and a long; and the leagues
                that lie between here and <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> are a small part in the count of my journeys. I
                have crossed many mountains and many <name type="GPE">ri</name>vers, and trodden many plains, even into the
                far count<name type="GPE">ri</name>es of Rh�n and <name type="ORG">Harad</name> where the stars are strange.</p>
            <p>'But my home, such as I have, is in the <name type="LOC">North</name>. For here the heirs of <name type="GPE">Valandil</name> have
                ever dwelt in long line unbroken from father unto son for many generations. <name type="DATE">Our <name type="DATE">day</name>s</name>
                have darkened, and we have dwindled; but ever the <name type="PRODUCT">Sword</name> has passed to a new keeper.
                And this I will say to you, <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>, ere I end. <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>nely men are we, <name type="PRODUCT">Ranger</name>s of the

                from us. What roads would any dare to tread, what safety would there be in quiet

                    was put on me. But perhaps I understand things a little better now. Anyway, this
                    is what happened.'</q></p>
            <p>To some there <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>'s tale was wholly new, and they lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed with amazement while the
                old hobbit, actually not at all displeased, recounted his adventure with <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>, at
                full length. He did not omit a single <name type="GPE">ri</name>ddle. He would have given also an account of
                his party and disappearance from the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>, if he had been allowed; but <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name>
                raised his hand.</p>
            <p><q>'Well told, my f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end,'</q> he said, `but that is enough at this time. For the
                moment it suffices to know that the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> passed to <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, your heir. Let him now
                speak!'</p>
            <p>Then, less willingly than <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> told of all his dealings with the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> from
                the <name type="DATE">day</name> that it passed into his keeping. Every step of his journey from <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbiton to
                the <name type="ORG">Ford</name> of <name type="PERSON">Bruinen</name> was questi<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>d and considered, and everything that he could
                recall concerning the <name type="ORG">Black</name> <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s was examined. At last he sat down again.</p>
            <p>`Not bad,<q>' <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> said to him. `You would have made a good story of it, if they
                    hadn't kept on interrupting. I t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed to make a few notes, but we shall have to
                    go over it all again together some time, if I am to w<name type="GPE">ri</name>te it up. There are whole
                    chapters of stuff before you ever got here!'</q></p>
            <p>`Yes, it made quite a long tale,<q>' answered <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. 'But the story still does not
                    seem complete to me. I still <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t to know a good deal, especially about
                    <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="ORG">Galdor</name> of the <name type="GPE">Haven</name>s, who sat near by, overheard him. `You speak for me also,<q>' he
                    c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed, and turning to <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name> he said: `The <name type="PERSON">Wise</name> may have good reason to believe
                    that the <name type="CARDINAL">half</name>ling's trove is indeed the Great <name type="ORG">Ring</name> of long debate, unlikely
                    though that may seem to those who know less. But may we not hear the proofs? And
                    I would ask this also. What of <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>? He is learned in the lore of the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>s,
                    yet he is not among us. What is his counsel-if he knows the things that we have
                    heard?'</q></p>
            <p>`The questions that you ask, <name type="ORG">Galdor</name>, are bound together,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name>. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> had not
                    overlooked them, and they shall be answered. But these things it is the part of
                    <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> to make clear; and I call upon him last, for it is the place of honour,
                    and in all this matter he has been the chief.'</q></p>
            <p>`Some, <name type="ORG">Galdor</name>,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, `would think the tidings of <name type="PRODUCT">Gl�</name>in, and the pursuit
                    of <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, proof enough that the <name type="CARDINAL">half</name>ling's trove is a thing of great worth to
                    the Enemy. Yet it is a <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng. What then? The <name type="CARDINAL">Nine</name> the Nazg�l keep. The <name type="CARDINAL">Seven</name> are
                    taken or destroyed.'</q> At this <name type="PRODUCT">Gl�</name>in stirred, but did not speak. `The <name type="PERSON">Thr</name>ee we
                know of. What then is this <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> that he desires so much?</p>
            <p>'There is indeed a wide waste of time between the <name type="LOC">River</name> and the <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>, between the
                loss and the finding. But the gap in the knowledge of the <name type="PERSON">Wise</name> has been filled at
                last. Yet too slowly. For the Enemy has been close behind, closer even than I
                feared. And well is it that not until <name type="DATE">this <name type="DATE">year</name></name>, this very <name type="DATE">summer</name>, as it seems, did
                he learn the full truth.</p>
            <p>'Some here will remember that <name type="DATE">many <name type="DATE">year</name>s</name> ago I myself dared to pass the doors of the
                <name type="ORG">Necromancer</name> in <name type="PERSON">Dol Guldur</name>, and <name type="ORG">sec</name>retly explored his ways, and found thus that our
                fears were true: he was n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> other than <name type="ORG">Sauron</name>, our Enemy of old, at length taking
                shape and power again. Some, too, will remember also that <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> dissuaded us from
                open deeds against him, and for long we watched him only. Yet at last, as his shadow
                grew, <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> yielded, and the <name type="ORG">Council</name> put forth its strength and drove the evil out
                of <name type="GPE">Mirkwood</name> and that was in <name type="DATE">the very <name type="DATE">year</name></name> of the finding of this <name type="ORG">Ring</name>: a strange
                chance, if chance it was.</p>
            <p>`But we were too late, as <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name> foresaw. <name type="ORG">Sauron</name> also had watched us, and had long
                prepared against our stroke, governing <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> from afar through Minas <name type="PERSON">Morgul</name>, where
                his <name type="CARDINAL">Nine</name> servants dwelt, until all was ready. Then he gave way before us, but only
                feigned to flee, and soon after came to the Dark <name type="FAC">Tower</name> and openly declared himself.
                Then for the last time the <name type="ORG">Council</name> met; for now we learned that he was seeking ever
                more eagerly for the <name type="CARDINAL">One</name>. We feared then that he had some news of it that we knew
                nothing of. But <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> said nay, and repeated what he had said to us before: that
                the <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> would never again be found in <name type="LOC">Middle-<name type="LOC">earth</name></name>.</p>
            <p>` "At the worst," said he, "our Enemy knows that we have it not and that it still is
                lost. But what was lost may yet be found, he thinks. Fear not! His hope will cheat
                him. Have I not earnestly studied this matter? Into <name type="GPE">Anduin</name> the Great it fell; and
                <name type="DATE">long ago</name>, while <name type="ORG">Sauron</name> slept, it was rolled down the <name type="LOC">River</name> to the <name type="LOC">Sea</name>. There let it
                lie until the End."'</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> fell silent, gazing eastward from the porch to the far peaks of the Misty
                <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s, at whose great roots the pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>l of the world had so long lain hidden. He
                sighed.</p>
            <p>`There I was at fault,<q>' he said. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> was lulled by the words of <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> the <name type="PERSON">Wise</name>;
                    but I should have sought for the truth so<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>r, and our pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>l would now be
                    less.'</q></p>
            <p>`We were all at fault,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name>, `and but for your vigilance the <name type="PRODUCT">Darkness</name>,
                    maybe, would already be upon us. But say on!'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`From</name> the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> my heart misgave me, against all reason that I knew,' said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>,
                `and I desired to know how this thing came to <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>, and how long he had possessed
                it. So I set a watch for him, guessing that he would ere long come forth from his
                darkness to seek for his treasure. He came, but he escaped and was not found. And
                then alas! I let the matter rest, wat<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g and waiting only, as we have too of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>
                <name type="PERSON">don</name>e.</p>
            <p>`<name type="PERSON">Tim</name>e passed with many cares, until my doubts were awakened again to sudden fear.
                Whence came the hobbit's <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng? What, if my fear was true, should be <name type="PERSON">don</name>e with it?
                Those things I must decide. But I spoke yet of my dread to n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, knowing the pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>l
                of an untimely whisper, if it went astray. In all the long wars with the Dark <name type="FAC">Tower</name>
                treason has ever been our greatest foe.</p>
            <p>
                <q>'That was <name type="CARDINAL">seven</name>teen <name type="DATE">year</name>s ago. Soon I became aware that spies of many sorts, even
                    beasts and birds, were gathered round the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>, and my fear grew. I called for
                    the help of the D�nedain, and their watch was doubled; and I opened my heart to
                    <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>, the heir of <name type="ORG">Isildur</name>.'</q>
            </p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`A</name>nd I,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>, `counselled that we should hunt for <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>. too late though
                    it may seem. And since it seemed fit that <name type="ORG">Isildur</name>'s heir should labour to repair
                    <name type="ORG">Isildur</name>'s fault, I went with <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> on the long and hopeless search.'</q></p>
            <p>Then <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> told how they had explored the whole length of <name type="PERSON">Wilderland</name>, down even to
                the <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s of <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name> and the <name type="PERSON">fen</name>ces of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>. `There we had rumour of him, and
                we guess that he dwelt there long in <name type="LOC">the dark hills</name>; but we never found him, and at
                last I despaired. And then in my despair I thought again of a test that might make
                the finding of <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> unneeded. The <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng itself might tell if it were the <name type="CARDINAL">One</name>. The
                memory of words at the <name type="ORG">Council</name> came back to me: words of <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>, <name type="CARDINAL">half</name><name type="PERSON">-he</name>eded at the
                time. I heard them now clearly in my heart.</p>
            <p>` "The <name type="CARDINAL">Nine</name>, the <name type="CARDINAL">Seven</name>, and the <name type="PERSON">Thr</name>ee," he said, "had each their proper gem. Not so
                the <name type="CARDINAL">One</name>. It was round and unadorned, as it were <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the lesser <name type="GPE">ri</name>ngs; but its
                maker set <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ks upon it that the skilled, maybe, could still see and read."</p>
            <p>`What those <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ks were he had not said. Who now would know? The maker. And <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>?
                But great though his lore may be, it must have a source. What hand save <name type="ORG">Sauron</name>'s
                ever held this thing, ere it was lost? The hand of <name type="ORG">Isildur</name> al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>.</p>
            <p>`With that thought, I forsook the chase, and passed swiftly to <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>. In former <name type="DATE">day</name>s
                the members of my order had been well received there, but <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> most of all. Of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>
                he had been for long the guest of the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rds of the <name type="LOC">City</name>. Less welcome did the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd
                <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name> show me then than of old, and grudgingly he permitted me to search among
                his hoarded scrolls and books.</p>
            <p>' "If indeed you look only, as you say, for records of <name type="DATE">ancient <name type="DATE">day</name>s</name>, and the
                beginnings of the <name type="LOC">City</name>, read on! " he said. "For to me what was is less dark than
                what is to come, and that is my care. But unless you have more skill even than
                <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>, who has studied here long, you will find naught that is not well known to
                me, who am master of the lore of this <name type="LOC">City</name>."</p>
            <p>`So said <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name>. And yet there lie in his hoards many records that few now can
                read, even of the lore-masters, for their sc<name type="GPE">ri</name>pts and tongues have become dark to
                later men. And <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>, there lies in Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name> still, unread, I guess, by any
                save <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> and myself since the kings failed, a scroll that <name type="ORG">Isildur</name> made himself.
                For <name type="ORG">Isildur</name> did not <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ch away straight from the war in <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>, as some have told
                the tale.'</p>
            <p><q>'Some in the <name type="LOC">North</name>, maybe,'</q> <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> broke in. <q>'All know in <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> that he
                    went <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> to Minas <name type="GPE">Anor</name> and dwelt a while with his nephew <name type="ORG">Men</name>eldil, instructing
                    him, before he committed to him the rule of the <name type="LOC">South</name> <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>gdom. In that time he
                    planted there the last sapling of the White <name type="PERSON">Tree</name> in memory of his
                brother.'</q></p>
            <p>`But in that time also he made this scroll,' said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>; `and that is not
                remembered in <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>, it would seem. For this scroll concerns the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>, and thus
                wrote <name type="ORG">Isildur</name> therein:</p>
            <p>_The Great <name type="ORG">Ring</name> shall go now to be an heirloom of the <name type="LOC">North</name> <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>gdom; but records of

            <p><name type="PERSON">`A</name>nd after these words <name type="ORG">Isildur</name> desc<name type="GPE">ri</name>bed the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>, such as he found it.</p>
            <p>_It was hot when I <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> took it, hot as a glede, and my hand was scorched, so that I
                doubt if ever again I shall be free of the pain of it. Yet even as I w<name type="GPE">ri</name>te it is
                cooled, and it seemeth to sh<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk, though it loseth neither its beauty nor its shape.
                Already the w<name type="GPE">ri</name>ting upon it, which at <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> was as clear as red flame, fadeth and is
                now only barely to be read. It is fashi<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>d in an <name type="ORG">elven</name>-sc<name type="GPE">ri</name>pt of <name type="ORG">Eregion</name>, for they
                have no letters in <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> for such subtle work; but the language is unknown to me. I
                deem it to be a tongue of the <name type="ORG">Black</name> Land, since it is foul and uncouth. What evil it
                saith I do not know; but I trace here a copy of it, lest it fade beyond recall. The
                <name type="ORG">Ring</name> misseth, maybe, the heat of <name type="ORG">Sauron</name>'s hand, which was black and yet burned like
                fire, and so <name type="PERSON">Gil-galad</name> was destroyed; and maybe were the gold made hot again, the
                w<name type="GPE">ri</name>ting would be refreshed. But for my part I will <name type="GPE">ri</name>sk no hurt to this thing: of
                all the works of <name type="ORG">Sauron</name> the only fair. It is precious to me, though I buy it with
                great pain._</p>
            <p>'When I read these words, my quest was ended. For the traced w<name type="GPE">ri</name>ting was indeed as
                <name type="ORG">Isildur</name> guessed, in the tongue of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> and the servants of the <name type="FAC">Tower</name>. And what was
                said therein was already known. For in the <name type="DATE">day</name> that <name type="ORG">Sauron</name> <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> put on the <name type="CARDINAL">One</name>,
                <name type="ORG">Celeb<name type="GPE">ri</name>mbor</name>, maker of the <name type="PERSON">Thr</name>ee, was aware of him, and from afar he heard him speak
                these words, and so his evil purposes were revealed.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`A</name>t once I took my leave of <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name>, but even as I went northwards, messages came to
                me out of L�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en that <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> had passed that way, and that he had found the
                creature called <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>. Therefore I went <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> to meet him and hear his tale. Into
                what deadly pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ls he had g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> I dared not guess.'</p>
            <p>`There is little need to tell of them,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>f a man must needs walk in
                    sight of the <name type="ORG">Black</name> <name type="FAC">Gate</name>, or tread the deadly flowers of <name type="PERSON">Morgul</name> Vale, then pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ls
                    he will have. I, too, despaired at last, and I began my homeward journey. And
                    then, by fortune, I came suddenly on what I sought: the <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ks of soft feet
                    beside a muddy pool. But now the trail was fresh and swift, and it led not to
                    <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> but away. Along the skirts of the Dead <name type="LOC">Marshes</name> I followed it, and then I
                    had him. Lurking by a stagnant mere, pee<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng in the water as the dark eve fell,
                    I caught him, <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>. He was covered with green slime. He will never love me, I
                    fear; for he bit me, and I was not gentle. Nothing more did I ever get from his
                    mouth than the <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ks of his teeth. I deemed it the worst part of all my journey,
                    the road back, wat<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g him <name type="DATE">day</name> and <name type="TIME">night</name>, making him walk before me with a
                    halter on his neck, gagged, until he was tamed by lack of d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk and food,
                    d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ving him ever towards <name type="GPE">Mirkwood</name>. I brought him there at last and gave him to
                    the <name type="ORG">Elves</name>, for we had agreed that this should be <name type="PERSON">don</name>e; and I was glad to be <name type="GPE">ri</name>d
                    of his company, for he stank. For my part I hope never to look upon him again;
                    but <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> came and endured long speech with him.'</q></p>
            <p>`Yes, long and weary,' said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, `but not without profit. For <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> thing, the tale
                he told of his loss agreed with that which <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> has now told openly for the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>
                time; but that mattered little, since I had already guessed it. But I learned then
                <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> that <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>'s <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng came out of the <name type="LOC">Great <name type="LOC">River</name></name> nigh to the <name type="PERSON">Gladden Fields</name>. And
                I learned also that he had possessed it long. Many lives of his small kind. The
                power of the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng had lengthened his <name type="DATE">year</name>s far beyond their span; but that power
                only the Great <name type="ORG">Ring</name>s wield.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`A</name>nd if that is not proof enough, <name type="ORG">Galdor</name>, there is the other test that I spoke of.
                Upon this very <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng which you have here seen held aloft, round and unadorned, the
                letters that <name type="ORG">Isildur</name> reported may still be read, if <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> has the strength of will to
                set the golden thing in the fire a while. That I have <name type="PERSON">don</name>e, and this I have
                read:</p>
            <p>_Ash nazg durbatul<name type="PRODUCT">�k</name>, ash <name type="PERSON">nazg gimbatul</name>, <name type="PERSON">ash nazg thrakatul<name type="PRODUCT">�k</name></name> <name type="PERSON">agh burzum-ishi</name>
                k<name type="GPE">ri</name>mpatul.'_</p>
            <p>The change in the wizard's voice was astounding. Suddenly it became menacing,
                powerful, harsh as st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. A shadow seemed to pass over the high sun, and the porch
                for a moment grew dark. All trembled, and the <name type="ORG">Elves</name> stopped their ears.</p>
            <p>`Never before has any voice dared to utter the words of that tongue in <name type="GPE">Imlad<name type="GPE">ri</name>s</name>,
                <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> the <name type="ORG">Grey</name>,' said <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name>, as the shadow passed and the company breathed once
                more.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`A</name>nd let us hope that n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> will ever speak it here again,' answered <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>.
                `N<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>theless I do not ask your par<name type="PERSON">don</name>, Master <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name>. For if that tongue is not soon
                to be heard in every corner of the <name type="LOC">West</name>, then let all put doubt aside that this
                thing is indeed what the <name type="PERSON">Wise</name> have declared: the treasure of the Enemy, fraught with
                all his malice; and in it lies a great part of his strength of old. Out of the <name type="ORG">Black</name>
                Years come the words that the Smiths of <name type="ORG">Eregion</name> heard, and knew that they had been
                betrayed:</p>
            <p>_<name type="CARDINAL">One</name> <name type="ORG">Ring</name> to rule them all, <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> <name type="ORG">Ring</name> to find them, <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> <name type="ORG">Ring</name> to b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng them all and in
                the <name type="PRODUCT">Darkness</name> bind them._</p>
            <p>`Know also, my f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends, that I learned more yet from <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>. He was loth to speak and
                his tale was unclear, but it is beyond all doubt that he went to <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>, and there
                all that he knew was forced from him. Thus the Enemy knows now that the <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> is
                found, that it was long in the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>; and since his servants have pursued it almost
                to our door, he soon will know, already he may know, even as I speak, that we have
                it here.'</p>
            <p>All sat silent for a while, until at length <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> spoke. <name type="PERSON">`He</name> is a small thing, you
                say, this <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>? Small, but great in mischief. What became of him? To what doom did
                you put him?'</p>
            <p><q>'He is in p<name type="GPE">ri</name>son, but no worse,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <name type="PERSON">`He</name> had suffered much. There is
                no doubt that he was tormented, and the fear of <name type="ORG">Sauron</name> lies black on his heart.
                Still I for <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> am glad that he is safely kept by the watchful <name type="ORG">Elves</name> of <name type="GPE">Mirkwood</name>.
                His malice is great and gives him a strength hardly to be believed in <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> so lean
                and withered. He could work much mischief still, if he were free. And I do not doubt
                that he was allowed to leave <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> on some evil errand.'</p>
            <p>`<name type="PERSON">Alas</name>! alas!<q>' c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>, and in his fair elvish face there was great distress.
                    `The tidings that I was sent to b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng must now be told. They are not good, but
                    only here have I learned how evil they may seem to this company. Sm�agol, who is
                    now called <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>, has escaped.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Escaped?'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'That is ill news indeed. We shall all rue it
                    bitterly, I fear. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w came the folk of <name type="PERSON">Thr</name>anduil to fail in their
                trust?'</q></p>
            <p>`Not through lack of watchfulness,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>; `but perhaps through
                    over-kindliness. And we fear that the p<name type="GPE">ri</name>s<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>r had aid from others, and that
                    more is known of our doings than we could wish. We guarded this creature <name type="DATE">day</name> and
                    <name type="TIME">night</name>, at <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>'s bidding, much though we wea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed of the task. But <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>
                    bade us hope still for his cure, and we had not the heart to keep him ever in
                    dungeons under the <name type="LOC">earth</name>, where he would fall back into his old black
                    thoughts.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'You were less <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>der to me,'</q> said <name type="PRODUCT">Gl�</name>in with a flash of his eyes as old
                memo<name type="GPE">ri</name>es were stirred of his imp<name type="GPE">ri</name>sonment in the deep places of the <name type="ORG">Elven</name>-king's
                halls.</p>
            <p><q>'Now come!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. `Pray do not interrupt, my good <name type="PRODUCT">Gl�</name>in. That was a
                regrettable misunderstanding, long set <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght. If all the g<name type="GPE">ri</name>evances that stand
                between <name type="ORG">Elves</name> and <name type="ORG">Dwarves</name> are to be brought up here, we may as well aban<name type="PERSON">don</name> this
                <name type="ORG">Council</name>.'</p>
            <p><name type="PRODUCT">Gl�</name>in rose and bowed, and <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> continued. 'In the <name type="DATE">day</name>s of fair weather we led
                <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> through the woods; and there was a high tree standing al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> far from the
                others which he liked to climb. Of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> we let him mount <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name> the highest branches,
                until he felt the free wind; but we set a guard at the tree's foot. <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> <name type="DATE">day</name> he
                refused to come down, and the guards had no mind to climb after him: he had learned
                the t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ck of clinging to boughs with his feet as well as with his hands; so they sat
                by the tree far into the <name type="TIME">night</name>.</p>
            <p>'It was that very <name type="TIME">night</name> of <name type="DATE">summer</name>, yet moonless and starless, that <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s came on us at
                unawares. We drove them off after some time; they were many and fierce, but they
                came from over the mountains, and were unused to the woods. When the battle was
                over, we found that <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> was g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, and his guards were slain or taken. It then
                seemed plain to us that the attack had been made for his rescue, and that he knew of
                it beforehand. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w that was cont<name type="GPE">ri</name>ved we cannot guess; but <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> is cunning, and
                the spies of the Enemy are many. The dark things that were d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ven out in <name type="DATE">the <name type="DATE">year</name></name> of
                the Dragon's fall have returned in greater numbers, and <name type="GPE">Mirkwood</name> is again an evil
                place, save where our realm is maintained.</p>
            <p>`We have failed to recapture <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>. We came on his trail among those of many <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s,
                and it plunged deep into the <name type="ORG">Forest</name>, going south. But ere long it escaped our skill,
                and we dared not continue the hunt; for we were drawing nigh to <name type="PERSON">Dol Guldur</name>, and that
                is still a very evil place; we do not go that way.'</p>
            <p><name type="ORG">`Well</name>, well, he is g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>,' said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. 'We have no time to seek for him again. He
                must do what he will. But he may play a part yet that neither he nor <name type="ORG">Sauron</name> have
                foreseen.</p>
            <p>'And now I will answer <name type="ORG">Galdor</name>'s other questions. What of <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>? What are his
                counsels to us in this need? This tale I must tell in full, for only <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name> has
                heard it yet, and that in b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ef, but it will bear on all that we must resolve. It is
                the last chapter in the Tale of the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>, so far as it has yet g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>.</p>
            <p>'At the end of <name type="DATE">June</name> I was in the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>, but a cloud of anxiety was on my mind, and I
                rode to the southern borders of the little land; for I had a foreboding of some
                danger, still hidden from me but drawing near. There messages reached me telling me
                of war and defeat in <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>, and when I heard of the <name type="ORG">Black</name> <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name> a c<name type="ORG">hill s</name>mote my
                heart. But I found nothing save a few fugitives from the <name type="LOC">South</name>; yet it seemed to me
                that on them sat a fear of which they would not speak. I turned then east and north
                and journeyed along the <name type="FAC">Greenway</name>; and not far from <name type="PERSON">Bree</name> I came upon a traveller
                sitting on a bank beside the road with his grazing horse beside him. It was <name type="ORG">Radagast</name>
                the <name type="PERSON">Brown</name>, who at <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> time dwelt at <name type="PRODUCT">Rhosgobel</name>, near the borders of <name type="GPE">Mirkwood</name>. He is
                <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of my order, but I had not seen him for many <name type="DATE">a <name type="DATE">year</name></name>.</p>
            <p>` "<name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>! " he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed. "I was seeking you. But I am a stranger in these parts. All I
                knew was that you might be found in a wild region with the uncouth name of
                <name type="LOC">Shire</name>."</p>
            <p>' "Your information was correct," I said. "But do not put it that way, if you meet
                any of the inhabitants. You are near the borders of the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> now. And what do you
                <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t with me? It must be pressing. You were never a traveller, unless d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ven by
                great need."</p>
            <p>' "I have an urgent errand," he said. "My news is evil." Then he looked about him, as
                if the hedges might have ears. "Nazg�l," he whispered. "The <name type="CARDINAL">Nine</name> are abroad again.
                They have crossed the <name type="LOC">River</name> <name type="ORG">sec</name>retly and are moving westward. They have taken the
                guise of <name type="GPE">ri</name>ders in black."</p>
            <p>'I knew then what I had dreaded without knowing it.</p>
            <p>` "The enemy must have some great need or purpose," said <name type="ORG">Radagast</name>; "but what it is
                that makes him look to these distant and desolate parts, I cannot guess."</p>
            <p>` "What do you mean? " said I.</p>
            <p>` "I have been told that wherever they go the <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s ask for news of a land called
                <name type="LOC">Shire</name>."</p>
            <p>' "_The_ <name type="LOC">Shire</name>," I said; but my heart sank. For even the <name type="PERSON">Wise</name> might fear to withstand
                the <name type="CARDINAL">Nine</name>, when they are gathered together under their fell chieftain. A great king
                and sorcerer he was of old, and now he wields a deadly fear. "Who told you, and who
                sent you? " I asked.</p>
            <p>' "<name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> the White," answered <name type="ORG">Radagast</name>. "And he told me to say that if you feel the
                need, he will help; but you must seek his aid at once, or it will be too late."</p>
            <p>'And that message brought me hope. For <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> the White is the greatest of my order.
                <name type="ORG">Radagast</name> is, of course, a worthy <name type="ORG">Wizard</name>, a master of shapes and changes of hue; and
                he has much lore of herbs and beasts, and birds are especially his f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends. But
                <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> has long studied the arts of the Enemy himself, and thus we have of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> been
                able to forestall him. It was by the devices of <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> that we drove him from Dol
                Guldur. It might be that he had found some weapons that would d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ve back the
                <name type="CARDINAL">Nine</name>.</p>
            <p>' "I will go to <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>," I said.</p>
            <p>' "Then you must go _now_," said <name type="ORG">Radagast</name>; "for I have wasted time in looking for
                you, and the <name type="DATE">day</name>s are running short. I was told to find you before <name type="DATE">Mid<name type="DATE">summer</name></name>, and
                that is now here. Even if you set out from this spot, you will hardly reach him
                before the <name type="CARDINAL">Nine</name> discover the land that they seek. I myself shall turn back at once."
                And with that he mounted and would have <name type="GPE">ri</name>dden straight off.</p>
            <p>` "Stay a moment! " I said. "We shall need your help, and the help of all things that
                will give it. Send out messages to all the beasts and birds that are your f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends.
                Tell them to b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng news of anything that bears on this matter to <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> and
                <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. Let messages be sent to <name type="PERSON">Orthanc</name>."</p>
            <p>` "I will do that," he said, and rode off as if the <name type="CARDINAL">Nine</name> were after him.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`I</name> could not follow him then and there. I had <name type="GPE">ri</name>dden very far already that <name type="DATE">day</name>, and I
                was as weary as my horse; and I needed to consider matters. I stayed the <name type="TIME">night</name> in
                <name type="PERSON">Bree</name>, and decided that I had no time to return to the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>. Never did I make a
                greater mistake!</p>
            <p>`<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>wever, I wrote a message to <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, and trusted to my f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end the innkeeper to send
                it to him. I rode away at <name type="TIME">dawn</name>; and I came at long last to the dwelling of <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>.
                That is far south in <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard, in the end of the <name type="LOC">Misty <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s</name>, not far from the
                <name type="ORG">Gap</name> of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>. And <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> will tell you that that is a great open <name type="GPE">vale</name> that lies
                between the <name type="LOC">Misty <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s</name> and the northmost foothills of <name type="ORG">Ered Nimrais</name>, the White
                <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s of his home. But <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard is a circle of sheer rocks that enclose a valley
                as with a wall, and in the midst of that valley is a tower of st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> called <name type="PERSON">Orthanc</name>.
                It was not made by <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>, but by the <name type="ORG">Men</name> of N�menor <name type="DATE">long ago</name>; and it is very tall
                and has many <name type="ORG">sec</name>rets; yet it looks not to be a work of craft. It cannot be reached
                save by passing the circle of <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard; and in that circle there is only <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>
                gate.</p>
            <p>'<name type="TIME">Late <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> <name type="TIME">evening</name></name> I came to the gate, like a great arch in the wall of rock; and it
                was strongly guarded. But the keepers of the gate were on the watch for me and told
                me that <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> awaited me. I rode under the arch, and the gate closed silently
                behind me, and suddenly I was afraid, though I knew no reason for it.</p>
            <p>'But I rode to the foot of <name type="PERSON">Orthanc</name>, and came to the stair of <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> and there he met
                me and led me <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name> his high chamber. He wore a <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng on his finger.</p>
            <p>` "So you have come, <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>," he said to me gravely; but in his eyes there seemed to
                be a white light, as if a cold laughter was in his heart.</p>
            <p>` "Yes, I have come," I said. "I have come for your aid, <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> the White." And that
                title seemed to anger him.</p>
            <p>' "Have you indeed, <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> the _<name type="ORG">Grey</name>_! " he scof<name type="ORG">fed</name>. "For aid? It has seldom been
                heard of that <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> the <name type="ORG">Grey</name> sought for aid, <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> so cunning and so wise, <name type="PERSON">wan</name>de<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng
                about the lands, and concerning himself in every business, whether it belongs to him
                or not."</p>
            <p>'I looked at him and wondered. "But if I am not deceived," said I, "things are now
                moving which will require the union of all our strength."</p>
            <p>' "That may be so," he said, "but the thought is late in coming to you. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w long. I
                wonder, have you concealed from me, the head of the <name type="ORG">Council</name>, a matter of greatest
                import? What b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ngs you now from your lurking-place in the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>? "</p>
            <p>' "The <name type="CARDINAL">Nine</name> have come forth again," I answered. "They have crossed the <name type="LOC">River</name>. So
                <name type="ORG">Radagast</name> said to me."</p>
            <p>` "<name type="ORG">Radagast</name> the <name type="PERSON">Brown</name>! " laughed <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>, and he no longer concealed his scorn.
                "<name type="ORG">Radagast</name> the Bird-tamer! <name type="ORG">Radagast</name> the Simple! <name type="ORG">Radagast</name> the Fool! Yet he had just
                the wit to play the part that I set him. For you have come, and that was all the
                purpose of my message. And here you will stay, <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> the <name type="ORG">Grey</name>, and rest from
                journeys. For I am <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> the <name type="PERSON">Wise</name>, <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> <name type="ORG">Ring</name>-maker, <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> of Many Colours!
                "</p>
            <p>'I looked then and saw that his robes, which had seemed white, were not so, but were
                woven of all colours. and if he moved they shimmered and changed hue so that the eye
                was bewildered.</p>
            <p>' "I liked white better," I said.</p>
            <p>' "White! " he sneered. "It serves as a beginning. White cloth may be dyed. The white
                page can be overw<name type="GPE">ri</name>t<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>; and the white light can be broken."</p>
            <p>' "In which case it is no longer white," said I. "And he that breaks a thing to find
                out what it is has left the path of wisdom."</p>
            <p>' "You need not speak to me as to <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the fools that you take for f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends," said
                he. "I have not brought you hither to be instructed by you, but to give you a
                choice."</p>
            <p>'He drew himself up then and began to declaim, as if he were making a speech long
                rehearsed. "The <name type="DATE">Elder Days</name> are g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. <name type="EVENT">The Middle Days</name> are passing. <name type="DATE">The Younger Days</name>
                are beginning. The time of the <name type="ORG">Elves</name> is over, but our time is at hand: the world of
                <name type="ORG">Men</name>, which we must rule. But we must have power, power to order all things as we
                will, for that good which only the <name type="PERSON">Wise</name> can see.</p>
            <p>' "And lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>, <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, my old f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end and helper! " he said, coming near and speaking
                now in a softer voice. "I said we, for we it may be, if you will join with me. A new
                <name type="ORG">Power</name> is <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing. Against it the old allies and policies will not avail us at all.
                There is no hope left in <name type="ORG">Elves</name> or dying N�menor. This then is <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> choice before you.
                before us. We may join with that <name type="ORG">Power</name>. It would be wise, <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. There is hope
                that way. Its victory is at hand; and there will be <name type="GPE">ri</name>ch reward for those that aided
                it. As the <name type="ORG">Power</name> grows, its proved f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends will also grow; and the <name type="PERSON">Wise</name>, such as you
                and I, may with patience come at last to direct its courses, to control it. We can
                bide our time, we can keep our thoughts in our hearts, deplo<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng maybe evils <name type="PERSON">don</name>e by
                the way, but approving the high and ultimate purpose: <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Knowledge, Rule, Order</name>; all
                the things that we have so far st<name type="GPE">ri</name>ven in vain to accomplish, hindered rather than
                helped by our weak or idle f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends. There need not be, there would not be, any real
                change in our designs, only in our means."</p>
            <p>' "<name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>," I said, "I have heard speeches of this kind before, but only in the
                mouths of emissa<name type="GPE">ri</name>es sent from <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> to deceive the ignorant. I cannot think that
                you brought me so far only to weary my ears."</p>
            <p>'He looked at me sidelong, and paused a while conside<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng. "Well, I see that this
                wise course does not commend itself to you," he said. "Not yet? Not if some better
                way can be cont<name type="GPE">ri</name>ved? "</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`He</name> came and laid his long hand on my arm. "And why not, <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>? " he whispered.
                "Why not? The Ruling <name type="ORG">Ring</name>? If we could command that, then the <name type="ORG">Power</name> would pass to
                us. That is in truth why I brought you here. For I have many eyes in my service, and
                I believe that you know where this precious thing now lies. Is it not so? Or why do
                the <name type="CARDINAL">Nine</name> ask for the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>, and what is your business there? " As he said this a
                lust which he could not conceal sh<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> suddenly in his eyes.</p>
            <p>' "<name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>," I said, standing away from him, "only <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> hand at a time can wield the
                <name type="CARDINAL">One</name>, and you know that well, so do not trouble to say we! But I would not give it,
                nay, I would not give even news of it to you, now that I learn your mind. You were
                head of the <name type="ORG">Council</name>, but you have unmasked yourself at last. Well, the choices are,
                it seems, to submit to <name type="ORG">Sauron</name>, or to yourself. I will take neither. Have you others
                to offer? "</p>
            <p>'He was cold now and pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>lous. "Yes," he said. "I did not expect you to show wisdom,
                even in your own be<name type="CARDINAL">half</name>; but I gave you the chance of aiding me willingly. and so
                saving yourself much trouble and pain. The <name type="ORDINAL">third</name> choice is to stay here, until the
                end."</p>
            <p>' "Until what end? "</p>
            <p>' "Until you reveal to me where the <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> may be found. I may find means to persuade
                you. Or until it is found in your despite, and the Ruler has time to turn to lighter
                matters: to devise, say, a fitting reward for the hindrance and insolence of <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>
                the <name type="ORG">Grey</name>."</p>
            <p>' "That may not prove to be <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the lighter matters," said <name type="PERSON">I. He</name> laughed at me,
                for my words were empty, and he knew it.</p>
            <p>`They took me and they set me al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> on the pinnacle of <name type="PERSON">Orthanc</name>, in the place where
                <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> was accus<name type="PERSON">tom</name>ed to watch the stars. There is no descent save by a narrow
                stair of <name type="CARDINAL">many thousand</name> steps, and the valley below seems far away. I looked on it
                and saw that, whereas it had once been green and fair, it was now filled with pits
                and forges. Wolves and orcs were housed in <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard, for <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> was muste<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng a
                great force on his own account, in <name type="GPE">ri</name>valry of <name type="ORG">Sauron</name> and not in his service yet.
                Over all his works a dark smoke hung and wrapped itself about the sides of <name type="PERSON">Orthanc</name>.
                I stood al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> on an island in the clouds; and I had no chance of escape, and my <name type="DATE">day</name>s
                were bitter. I was pierced with cold, and I had but little room in which to pace to
                and fro, brooding on the coming of the <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s to the <name type="LOC">North</name>.</p>
            <p>`That the <name type="CARDINAL">Nine</name> had indeed a<name type="GPE">ri</name>sen I felt assured, apart from the words of <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>
                which might be lies. <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ng ere I came to <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard I had heard tidings by the way that
                could not be mistaken. Fear was ever in my heart for my f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends in the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>; but
                still I had some hope. I hoped that <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> had set forth at once, as my letter had
                urged, and that he had reached <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name> before the deadly pursuit began. And both
                my fear and my hope proved ill-founded. For my hope was founded on a fat man in
                <name type="PERSON">Bree</name>; and my fear was founded on the cunning of <name type="ORG">Sauron</name>. But fat men who sell ale
                have many calls to answer; and the power of <name type="ORG">Sauron</name> is still less than fear makes it.
                But in the circle of <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard, trapped and al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, it was not easy to think that the
                hunters before whom all have fled or fallen would falter in the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> far away.'</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`I</name> saw you!<q>' c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. `You were walking backwards and forwards. The moon sh<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>
                    in your <name type="PERSON">hai</name>r.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> paused astonished and looked at him. <q>'It was only a dream' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>,
                    `but it suddenly came back to me. I had quite forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> it. It came some time
                    ago; after I left the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>, I think.'</q></p>
            <p>`Then it was late in coming,' said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, 'as you will see. I was in an evil
                plight. And those who know me will agree that I have seldom been in such need, and
                do not bear such misfortune well. <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> the <name type="ORG">Grey</name> caught like a fly in a spider's
                treacherous web! Yet even the most subtle spiders may leave a weak thread.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`A</name>t <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> I feared, as <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> no doubt in<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ded, that <name type="ORG">Radagast</name> had also fallen. Yet
                I had caught no hint of anything wrong in his voice or in his eye at our meeting. If
                I had, I should never have g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> to <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard, or I should have g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> more wa<name type="GPE">ri</name>ly. So
                <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> guessed, and he had concealed his mind and deceived his messenger. It would
                have been useless in any case to try and win over the h<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>st <name type="ORG">Radagast</name> to treachery.
                He sought me in good faith, and so persuaded me.</p>
            <p>`That was the undoing of <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>'s plot. For <name type="ORG">Radagast</name> knew no reason why he should
                not do as I asked; and he rode away towards <name type="GPE">Mirkwood</name> where he had many f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends of
                old. And the <name type="PRODUCT">Eagle</name>s of the <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s went far and wide, and they saw many things:
                the gathe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng of wolves and the muste<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng of <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s; and the <name type="CARDINAL">Nine</name> <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s going hither
                and thither in the lands; and they heard news of the escape of <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>. And they sent
                a messenger to b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng these tidings to me.</p>
            <p>`So it was that when <name type="DATE">summer</name> <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ed, there came <name type="TIME">a <name type="TIME">night</name></name> of moon, and <name type="PERSON">Gwaihir</name> the
                <name type="ORG">Windlord</name>, swiftest of the Great <name type="PRODUCT">Eagle</name>s, came unlooked-for to <name type="PERSON">Orthanc</name>; and he found
                me standing on the pinnacle. Then I spoke to him and he bore me away, before <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>
                was aware. I was far from <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard, ere the wolves and orcs issued from the gate to
                pursue me.</p>
            <p>` "<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w far can you bear me? " I said to <name type="PERSON">Gwaihir</name>.</p>
            <p>` "Many leagues," said he, "but not to the ends of the <name type="LOC">earth</name>. I was sent to bear
                tidings not burdens."</p>
            <p>` "Then I must have a <name type="PERSON">steed</name> on land," I said, "and a <name type="PERSON">steed</name> surpassingly swift, for I
                have never had such need of haste before."</p>
            <p>` "Then I will bear you to <name type="ORG">Edoras</name>, where the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> sits in his halls," he
                said; "for that is not very far off." And I was glad, for in the <name type="ORG">Ridder<name type="PERSON">mar</name>k</name> of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>
                the Rohir<name type="GPE">ri</name>m, the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>rse-lords, dwell, and there are no horses like those that are
                bred in that great <name type="GPE">vale</name> between the <name type="LOC">Misty <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s</name> and the White.</p>
            <p>` "<name type="WORK_OF_ART">Are the <name type="ORG">Men</name> of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name></name> still to be trusted, do you think? " I said to <name type="PERSON">Gwaihir</name>, for
                the treason of <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> had shaken my faith.</p>
            <p>` "They pay a t<name type="GPE">ri</name>bute of horses," he answered, "and send many <name type="DATE">year</name>ly to <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>, or so
                it is said; but they are not yet under the yoke. But if <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> has become evil, as
                you say, then their doom cannot be long delayed."</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`He</name> set me down in the land of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> ere <name type="TIME">dawn</name>; and now I have lengthened my tale over
                long. The rest must be more b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ef. In <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> I found evil already at work: the lies
                of <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>; and the king of the land would not lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> to my warnings. He bade me
                take a horse and be g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>; and I chose <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> much to my liking. but little to his. I
                took the best horse in his land, and I have never seen the like of him.'</p>
            <p><q>'Then he must be a noble beast indeed,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>; <q>'and it g<name type="GPE">ri</name>eves me
                    more than many tidings that might seem worse to learn that <name type="ORG">Sauron</name> levies such
                    t<name type="GPE">ri</name>bute. It was not so when last I was in that land.'</q></p>
            <p>`Nor is it now, I will swear,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>t is a lie that comes from the
                    Enemy. I know the <name type="ORG">Men</name> of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>; true and valiant, our allies, dwelling still in
                    the lands that we gave them <name type="DATE">long ago</name>.'</q></p>
            <p>`The shadow of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> lies on distant lands,<q>' answered <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. '<name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> has
                    fallen under it. <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> is beset. Who knows what you will find there, if ever you
                    return?'</q></p>
            <p>`Not this at least.<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>, 'that they will buy their lives with horses.
                    They love their horses next to their kin. And not without reason, for the horses
                    of the <name type="ORG">Ridder<name type="PERSON">mar</name>k</name> come from the fields of the <name type="LOC">North</name>, far from the <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>. and
                    their race, as that of their masters, is descended from the free <name type="DATE">day</name>s of
                    old.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'True indeed!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <name type="PERSON">`A</name>nd there is <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> among them that might have been
                foaled in the <name type="TIME">morning</name> of the world. The horses of the <name type="CARDINAL">Nine</name> cannot vie with him;
                tireless, swift as the flowing wind. <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>fax they called him. By <name type="DATE">day</name> his coat
                glis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>s like silver; and by <name type="TIME">night</name> it is like a shade, and he passes unseen. Light
                is his footfall! Never before had any man mounted him, but I took him and I tamed
                him, and so speedily he bore me that I reached the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> when <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> was on the
                <name type="ORG">Barrow</name>-downs, though I set out from <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> only when he set out from <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbiton.</p>
            <p>'But fear grew in me as I rode. Ever as I came north I heard tidings of the <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s,
                and though I gained on them <name type="DATE">day</name> by <name type="DATE">day</name>, they were ever before me. They had divided
                their forces, I learned: some remained on the eastern borders, not far from the
                <name type="FAC">Greenway</name>. and some invaded the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> from the south. I came to <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbiton and <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>
                had g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>; but I had words with old <name type="PERSON">Gamgee</name>. Many words and few to the point. He had
                much to say about the shortcomings of the new owners of <name type="FAC">Bag End</name>.</p>
            <p>` "I can't abide changes," said he, "not at my time of life, and least of all changes
                for the worst." "Changes for the worst," he repeated many times.</p>
            <p>' "Worst is a bad word," I said to him, "and I hope you do not live to see it." But
                amidst his talk I gathered at last that <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> had left <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbiton less than <name type="DATE">a <name type="DATE">week</name></name>
                before, and that a black horseman had come to the <name type="ORG">Hill</name> the same <name type="TIME">evening</name>. Then I rode
                on in fear. I came to <name type="PERSON">Buckland</name> and found it in uproar, as busy as a hive of ants
                that has been stirred with a stick. I came to the house at <name type="ORG">C<name type="GPE">ri</name>ckhollow</name>, and it was
                broken open and empty; but on the threshold there lay a cloak that had been <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s.
                Then for a while hope left me, and I did not wait to gather news, or I might have
                been comforted; but I rode on the trail of the <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s. It was hard to follow, for it
                went many ways, and I was at a loss. But it seemed to me that <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> or <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> had <name type="GPE">ri</name>dden
                towards <name type="PERSON">Bree</name>; and that way I went, for I thought of words that might be said to the
                innkeeper.</p>
            <p>
                <q>' "<name type="PERSON">Butterbur</name> they call him," thought I. "If this delay was his fault, I will melt
                    all the butter in him. I will roast the old fool over a slow fire." He expected
                    no less, and when he saw my face he fell down flat and began to melt on the
                    spot.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>`What did you do to him?<q>' c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> in alarm. 'He was really very kind to us and
                    did all that he could.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> laughed. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Don</name>'t be afraid!'</q> he said. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> did not bite, and I barked
                very little. So overjoyed was I by the news that I got out of him, when he stopped
                quaking, that I embraced the old fellow. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w it happened I could not then guess, but
                I learned that you had been in <name type="PERSON">Bree</name> the <name type="TIME">night</name> before, and had g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> off that <name type="TIME">morning</name>
                with <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>.</p>
            <p>` "<name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>! " I c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed, shouting for joy.</p>
            <p>` "Yes, sir, I am afraid so, sir," said <name type="PERSON">Butterbur</name>, mistaking me. "He got at them, in
                spite of all that I could do, and they took up with him. They behaved very queer all
                the time they were here: wilful, you might say."</p>
            <p>` "<name type="WORK_OF_ART">Ass! Fool</name>! <name type="PERSON">Thr</name>ice worthy and beloved <name type="PERSON">Barliman</name>! " said I. "It's the best news I
                have had since <name type="DATE">mid<name type="DATE">summer</name></name>: it's worth a gold piece at the least. <name type="DATE">May</name> your beer be
                laid under an enchantment of surpassing excellence for <name type="CARDINAL">seven</name> <name type="DATE">year</name>s! " said I. "Now I
                can take <name type="TIME">a <name type="TIME">night</name></name>'s rest, the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> since I have forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> when."</p>
            <p>`So I stayed there that <name type="TIME">night</name>, wonde<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng much what had become of the <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s; for only
                of <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> had there yet been any news in <name type="PERSON">Bree</name>, it seemed. But in the <name type="TIME">night</name> we heard
                more. <name type="CARDINAL">Five</name> at least came from the west, and they threw down the gates and passed
                through <name type="PERSON">Bree</name> like a howling wind; and the <name type="PERSON">Bree</name>-folk are still shive<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng and
                expecting the end of the world. I got up before <name type="TIME">dawn</name> and went after them.</p>
            <p>'I do not know, but it seems clear to me that this is what happened. Their Captain
                remained in <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret away south of <name type="PERSON">Bree</name>, while <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> rode ahead through the village, and
                <name type="CARDINAL">four</name> more invaded the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>. But when these were foiled in <name type="PERSON">Bree</name> and at <name type="ORG">C<name type="GPE">ri</name>ckhollow</name>,
                they returned to their Captain with tidings, and so left the <name type="FAC">Road</name> unguarded for a
                while, except by their spies. The Captain then sent some eastward straight across
                country, and he himself with the rest rode along the <name type="FAC">Road</name> in great wrath.</p>
            <p>'I galloped to <name type="ORG">Weathertop</name> like a gale, and I reached it before sundown on my <name type="ORG">sec</name>ond
                <name type="DATE">day</name> from <name type="PERSON">Bree</name>-and they were there before me. They drew away from me, for they felt
                the coming of my anger and they dared not face it while the <name type="ORG">Sun</name> was in the sky. But
                they closed round at <name type="TIME">night</name>, and I was besieged on the hill-top, in the old <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng of
                <name type="PERSON">Amon S�l.</name> I was hard put to it indeed: such light and flame cannot have been seen on
                <name type="ORG">Weathertop</name> since the war-beacons of old.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`A</name>t sun<name type="GPE">ri</name>se I escaped and fled towards the north. I could not hope to do more. It was
                impossible to find you, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, in the wilderness, and it would have been folly to
                try with all the <name type="CARDINAL">Nine</name> at my heels. So I had to trust to <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. But I hoped to draw
                some of them off, and yet reach <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name> ahead of you and send out help. <name type="CARDINAL">Four</name>
                <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s did indeed follow me, but they turned back after a while and made for the
                <name type="ORG">Ford</name>, it seems. That helped a little, for there were only <name type="CARDINAL">five</name>, not <name type="CARDINAL">nine</name>, when your
                camp was attacked.</p>
            <p>'I reached here at last by a long hard road, up the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>arwell and through the
                Et<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>moors, and down from the north. It took me nearly <name type="CARDINAL">four</name>teen <name type="DATE">day</name>s from
                <name type="ORG">Weathertop</name>, for I could not <name type="GPE">ri</name>de among the rocks of the troll-fells, and <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>fax
                departed. I sent him back to his master; but a great f<name type="GPE">ri</name>endship has grown between
                us, and if I have need he will come at my call. But so it was that I came to
                <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name> <name type="CARDINAL">only <name type="CARDINAL">three</name></name> <name type="DATE">day</name>s before the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>, and news of its pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>l had already been
                brought here-which proved well indeed.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`A</name>nd that, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, is the end of my account. <name type="DATE">May</name> <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name> and the others forgive the
                length of it. But such a thing has not happened before, that <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> broke tryst and
                did not come when he promised. An account to the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>-bearer of so strange an event
                was required, I think.</p>
            <p>
                <q>'Well, the Tale is now told, from <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> to last. Here we all are, and here is the
                    <name type="ORG">Ring</name>. But we have not yet come any nearer to our purpose. What shall we do with
                    it?'</q>
            </p>
            <p>There was silence. At last <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name> spoke again.</p>
            <p>`This is g<name type="GPE">ri</name>evous news concerning <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>,' he said; `for we trusted him and he is
                deep in all our counsels. It is pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>lous to study too deeply the arts of the Enemy,
                for good or for ill. But such falls and betrayals, alas, have happened before. Of
                the tales that we have heard this <name type="DATE">day</name> the tale of <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> was most strange to me. I
                have known few hobbits, save <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> here; and it seems to me that he is perhaps not
                so al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> and singular as I had thought him. The world has changed much since I last
                was on the westward roads.</p>
            <p>`The <name type="ORG">Barrow</name>-wights we know by many names; and of the Old <name type="ORG">Forest</name> many tales have been
                told: all that now remains is but an outlier of its northern <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ch. <name type="PERSON">Tim</name>e was when a
                squirrel could go from tree to tree from what is now the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> to <name type="GPE">Dunland</name> west of
                <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard. In those lands I journeyed once, and many things wild and strange I knew.
                But I had forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> <name type="GPE">Bombadil</name>, if indeed this is still the same that walked the woods
                and hills <name type="DATE">long ago</name>, and even then was older than the old. That was not then his
                name. <name type="FAC">Iar<name type="PERSON">wain</name></name> Ben-adar we called him, oldest and fatherless. But many another name
                he has since been given by other folk: Forn by the <name type="ORG">Dwarves</name>, <name type="NORP">Orald</name> by <name type="LOC">North</name>ern <name type="ORG">Men</name>,
                and other names beside. He is a strange creature, but maybe I should have summ<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>d
                him to our <name type="ORG">Council</name>.'</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`He</name> would not have come,' said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>.</p>
            <p>`Could we not still send messages to him and obtain his help?<q>' asked <name type="PRODUCT">Erestor</name>. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>t
                    seems that he has a power even over the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>.'</q></p>
            <p>`No, I should not put it so,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. `Say rather that the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> has no power
                    over him. He is his own master. But he cannot alter the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> itself, nor break
                    its power over others. And now he is withdrawn into a little land, within bounds
                    that he has set, though n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> can see them, waiting perhaps for a change of <name type="DATE">day</name>s,
                    and he will not step beyond them.'</q></p>
            <p>`But within those bounds nothing seems to dismay him,<q>' said <name type="PRODUCT">Erestor</name>. `Would he not
                    take the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> and keep it there, for ever harmless?'</q></p>
            <p>`No,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, `not willingly. He might do so, if all the free folk of the
                    world begged him, but he would not understand the need. And if he were given the
                    <name type="ORG">Ring</name>, he would soon forget it, or most likely throw it away. Such things have no
                    hold on his mind. He would be a most unsafe guardian; and that al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> is answer
                    enough.'</q></p>
            <p>`But in any case,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Glorfindel</name>, `to send the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> to him would only postp<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>
                    the <name type="DATE">day</name> of evil. He is far away. We could not now take it back to him,
                    unguessed, un<name type="PERSON">mar</name>ked by any spy. And even if we could, soon or late the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd of
                    the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>s would learn of its hiding place and would bend all his power towards
                    it. Could that power be defied by <name type="GPE">Bombadil</name> al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>? I think not. I think that in
                    the end, if all else is conquered, <name type="GPE">Bombadil</name> will fall, Last as he was <name type="ORDINAL">First</name>; and
                    then Night will come.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`I</name> know little of <name type="FAC">Iar<name type="PERSON">wain</name></name> save the name,<q>' said <name type="ORG">Galdor</name>; `but <name type="PERSON">Glorfindel</name>, I think,
                    is <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght. <name type="ORG">Power</name> to defy our Enemy is not in him, unless such power is in the
                    <name type="LOC">earth</name> itself. And yet we see that <name type="ORG">Sauron</name> can torture and destroy the very hills.
                    What power still remains lies with us, here in <name type="GPE">Imlad<name type="GPE">ri</name>s</name>, or with <name type="PERSON">Cirdan</name> at the
                    <name type="GPE">Haven</name>s, or in L�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en. But have they the strength, have we here the strength to
                    withstand the Enemy, the coming of <name type="ORG">Sauron</name> at the last, when all else is

            <p><name type="PERSON">`I</name> have not the strength,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name>; `neither have they.'</q></p>
            <p>`Then if the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> cannot be kept from him for ever by strength' said <name type="PERSON">Glorfindel</name>, `<name type="CARDINAL">two</name>
                things only remain for us to attempt: to send it over the <name type="LOC">Sea</name>, or to destroy
                it.'</p>
            <p>`But <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> has revealed to us that we cannot destroy it by any craft that we here
                    possess,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name>. <name type="PERSON">`A</name>nd they who dwell beyond the <name type="LOC">Sea</name> would not receive
                    it: for good or ill it belongs to <name type="LOC">Middle-<name type="LOC">earth</name></name>; it is for us who still dwell
                    here to deal with it.'</q></p>
            <p>
                <q>'Then, said <name type="PERSON">Glorfindel</name>, 'let us cast it into the deeps, and so make the lies of
                    <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> come true. For it is clear now that even at the <name type="ORG">Council</name> his feet were
                    already on a crooked path. He knew that the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> was not lost for ever, but
                    wished us to think so; for he began to lust for it for himself. Yet oft in lies
                    truth is hidden: in the <name type="LOC">Sea</name> it would be safe.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>`Not safe for ever,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. `There are many things in the deep waters; and
                    seas and lands may change. And it is not our part here to take thought only for
                    a season, or for a few lives of <name type="ORG">Men</name>, or for a passing age of the world. We
                    should seek a final end of this menace, even if we do not hope to make
                <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'And that we shall not find on the roads to the <name type="LOC">Sea</name>,'</q> said <name type="ORG">Galdor</name>. <q>'If the
                    return to <name type="FAC">Iar<name type="PERSON">wain</name></name> be thought too dangerous, then flight to the S�a is now
                    fraught with gravest pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>l. My heart tells me that <name type="ORG">Sauron</name> will expect us to take
                    the western way, when he learns what has befallen. He soon will. The <name type="CARDINAL">Nine</name> have
                    been unhorsed indeed but that is but a respite, ere they find new <name type="PERSON">steed</name>s and
                    swifter. Only the <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ing might of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> stands now between him and a <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ch in
                    power along the coasts into the <name type="LOC">North</name>; and if he comes, assailing the White
                    <name type="FAC">Tower</name>s and the <name type="GPE">Haven</name>s, hereafter the <name type="ORG">Elves</name> may have no escape from the
                    lengthening shadows of <name type="LOC">Middle-<name type="LOC">earth</name></name>.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ng yet will that <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ch be delayed,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>. <q>'<name type="ORG">Gondor</name> <name type="PERSON">wan</name>es, you
                    say. But <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> stands, and even the end of its strength is still very
                    strong.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'And yet its vigilance can no longer keep back the <name type="CARDINAL">Nine</name>,'</q> said <name type="ORG">Galdor</name>. <q>'And
                    other roads he may find that <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> does not guard.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Then,'</q> said <name type="PRODUCT">Erestor</name>, `there are but <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> courses, as <name type="PERSON">Glorfindel</name> already has
                declared: to hide the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> for ever; or to unmake it. But both are beyond our power.
                Who will read this <name type="GPE">ri</name>ddle for us?'</p>
            <p><q>'N<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> here can do so,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name> gravely. <name type="PERSON">`A</name>t least n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> can foretell what
                will come to pass, if we take this road or that. But it seems to me now clear which
                is the road that we must take. The westward road seems easiest. Therefore it must be
                shunned. It will be watched. Too of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> the <name type="ORG">Elves</name> have fled that way. Now at this
                last we must take a hard road, a road unforeseen. There lies our hope, if hope it
                be. To walk into pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>l-to <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>. We must send the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> to the <name type="ORG">Fire</name>.'</p>
            <p>Silence fell again. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, even in that fair house, looking out upon a sunlit valley
                filled with the noise of clear waters, felt a dead darkness in his heart. <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>
                stirred, and <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> looked at him. He was finge<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng his great horn and frowning. At
                length he spoke.</p>
            <p><q>'I do not understand all this,'</q> he said. `<name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> is a traitor, but did he not
                have a glimpse of wisdom? Why do you speak ever of hiding and destroying? Why should
                we not think that the Great <name type="ORG">Ring</name> has come into our hands to serve us in the very
                <name type="TIME">hour</name> of need? Wielding it the Free <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rds of the Free may surely defeat the Enemy.
                That is what he most fears, I deem.</p>
            <p>
                <q>'The <name type="ORG">Men</name> of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> are valiant, and they will never submit; but they may be
                    bea<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> down. Valour needs <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> strength, and then a weapon. Let the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> be
                    your weapon, if it has such power as you say. Take it and go forth to
                    victory!'</q>
            </p>
            <p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Alas</name>, no,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name>. <q>'We cannot use the Ruling <name type="ORG">Ring</name>. That we now know
                    too well. It belongs to <name type="ORG">Sauron</name> and was made by him al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, and is altogether
                    evil. Its strength, <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>, is too great for any<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> to wield at will, save only
                    those who have already a great power of their own. But for them it holds an even
                    deadlier pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>l. The very desire of it corrupts the heart. Consider <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>. If
                    any of the <name type="PERSON">Wise</name> should with this <name type="ORG">Ring</name> overthrow the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>, using his
                    own arts, he would then set himself on <name type="ORG">Sauron</name>'s thr<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, and yet another Dark
                    <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd would appear. And that is another reason why the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> should be destroyed:
                    as long as it is in the world it will be a danger even to the <name type="PERSON">Wise</name>. For nothing
                    is evil in the beginning. Even <name type="ORG">Sauron</name> was not so. I fear to take the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> to
                    hide it. I will not take the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> to wield it.'</q></p>
            <p>`Nor I,' said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> looked at them doubtfully, but he bowed his head. `So be it,<q>' he said.
                    `Then in <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> we must trust to such weapons as we have. And at the least,
                    while the <name type="PERSON">Wise</name> <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s guard this <name type="ORG">Ring</name>, we will fight on. <name type="DATE">May</name>hap the

                    inhe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ted not an heirloom only, but the <name type="PERSON">sinew</name>s of the <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>gs of <name type="ORG">Men</name>.'</q></p>
            <p>`Who can tell?<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. `But we will put it to the test <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> <name type="DATE">day</name>.'</q></p>
            <p>`<name type="DATE">May</name> the <name type="DATE">day</name> not be too long delayed,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>. 'For though I do not ask for
                    aid, we need it. It would comfort us to know that others fought also with all
                    the means that they have.'</q></p>
            <p>`Then be comforted,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name>. `For there are other powers and realms that you
                    know not, and they are hidden from you. <name type="GPE">Anduin</name> the Great flows past many shores,
                    ere it comes to <name type="PERSON">Argonath</name> and the <name type="FAC">Gate</name>s of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Still it might be well for all,'</q> said <name type="PRODUCT">Gl�</name>in the <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Dwarf</name>, <q>'if all these
                    strengths were joined, and the powers of each were used in league. Other <name type="GPE">ri</name>ngs
                    there may be, less treacherous, that might be used in our need. The <name type="CARDINAL">Seven</name> are

            <p><q>'Ah, alas!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PRODUCT">Gl�</name>in. <q>'When will the <name type="DATE">day</name> come of our revenge? But still
                    there are the <name type="PERSON">Thr</name>ee. What of the <name type="PERSON">Thr</name>ee <name type="ORG">Ring</name>s of the <name type="ORG">Elves</name>? Very mighty <name type="ORG">Ring</name>s, it
                    is said. Do not the <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name>-lords keep them? Yet they too were made by the Dark <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd
                    <name type="DATE">long ago</name>. Are they idle? I see <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name>-lords here. Will they not say?'</q></p>
            <p>The <name type="ORG">Elves</name> returned no answer. `Did you not hear me, <name type="PRODUCT">Gl�</name>in?<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name>. `The
                    <name type="PERSON">Thr</name>ee were not made by <name type="ORG">Sauron</name>, nor did he ever touch them. But of them it is not
                    permitted to speak. So much only in this <name type="TIME">hour</name> of doubt I may now say. They are
                    not idle. But they were not made as weapons of war or conquest: that is not
                    their power. Those who made them did not desire strength or domination or
                    hoarded wealth, but understanding, making, and healing, to preserve all things
                    unstained. These things the <name type="ORG">Elves</name> of <name type="LOC">Middle-<name type="LOC">earth</name></name> have in some measure gained,
                    though with sorrow. But all that has been wrought by those who wield the <name type="PERSON">Thr</name>ee
                    will turn to their undoing, and their minds and hearts will become revealed to
                    <name type="ORG">Sauron</name>, if he regains the <name type="CARDINAL">One</name>. It would be better if the <name type="PERSON">Thr</name>ee had never been.
                    That is his purpose.'</q></p>
            <p>`But what then would happen, if the Ruling <name type="ORG">Ring</name> were destroyed as you counsel?' asked
                <name type="PRODUCT">Gl�</name>in.</p>
            <p><q>'We know not for certain,'</q> answered <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name> sadly. `Some hope that the <name type="PERSON">Thr</name>ee
                <name type="ORG">Ring</name>s, which <name type="ORG">Sauron</name> has never touched, would then become free, and their rulers
                might heal the hurts of the world that he has wrought. But maybe when the <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> has
                g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, the <name type="PERSON">Thr</name>ee will fail, and many fair things will fade and be forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>. That is
                my belief.'</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`Yet</name> all the <name type="ORG">Elves</name> are willing to endure this chance,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Glorfindel</name> 'if by it
                    the power of <name type="ORG">Sauron</name> may be broken, and the fear of his dominion be taken away
                    for ever.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Thus we return once more to the destroying of the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>,'</q> said <name type="PRODUCT">Erestor</name>, `and
                yet we come no nearer. What strength have we for the finding of the <name type="ORG">Fire</name> in which it
                was made? That is the path of despair. Of folly I would say, if the long wisdom of
                <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name> did not forbid me.'</p>
            <p><q>'Despair, or folly?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>t is not despair, for despair is only for
                those who see the end beyond all doubt. We do not. It is wisdom to recognize
                necessity, when all other courses have been weighed, though as folly it may appear
                to those who cling to false hope. Well, let folly be our cloak, a veil before the
                eyes of the Enemy! For he is very wise, and weighs all things to a nicety in the
                scales of his malice. But the only measure that he knows is desire, desire for
                power; and so he judges all hearts. Into his heart the thought will not enter that
                any will refuse it, that having the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> we may seek to destroy it. If we seek this,
                we shall put him out of reckoning.'</p>
            <p><q>'At least for a while,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name>. `The road must be trod, but it will be
                very hard. And neither strength nor wisdom will carry us far upon it. This quest may
                be attempted by the weak with as much hope as the strong. Yet such is oft the course
                of deeds that move the wheels of the world: small hands do them because they must,
                while the eyes of the great are elsewhere.'</p>
            <p><q>'Very well, very well, Master <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name>!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> suddenly. 'Say no more! It
                is plain enough what you are pointing at. <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> the silly hobbit started this
                affair, and <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> had better finish it, or himself. I was very comfortable here, and
                getting on with my book. If you <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t to know, I am just w<name type="GPE">ri</name>ting an ending for it. I
                had thought of putting: _and he lived happily ever afterwards to the end of his
                <name type="DATE">day</name>s_. It is a good ending, and n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> the worse for having been used before. Now I
                shall have to alter that: it does not look like coming true; and anyway there will
                evidently have to be several more chapters, if I live to w<name type="GPE">ri</name>te them. It is a
                f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ghtful nuisance. When ought I to start?</p>
            <p>' <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> looked in surp<name type="GPE">ri</name>se at <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>, but the laughter died on his lips when he saw
                that all the others regarded the old hobbit with grave respect. Only <name type="PRODUCT">Gl�</name>in smiled,
                but his smile came from old memo<name type="GPE">ri</name>es.</p>
            <p>`Of course, my dear <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>f you had really started this affair,
                    you might be expected to finish it. But you know well enough now that _starting_
                    is too great a claim for any, and that only a small part is played in great
                    deeds by any hero. You need not bow! Though the word was meant, and we do not
                    doubt that under jest you are making a valiant offer. But <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> beyond your
                    strength, <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>. You cannot take this thing back. It has passed on. If you need
                    my advice any longer, I should say that your part is ended, unless as a

                    for it. But get ready to w<name type="GPE">ri</name>te a sequel, when they come back.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> laughed. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> have never known you give me pleasant advice before.<q>' he said.
                    <name type="PERSON">`A</name>s all your unpleasant advice has been good, I wonder if this advice is not
                    bad. Still, I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t suppose I have the strength or luck left to deal with the

            <p>`The messengers who are sent with the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>.'</p>
            <p>`Exactly! And who are they to be? That seems to me what this <name type="ORG">Council</name> has to decide,

                think of some names now? Or put it off till after dinner?'</p>
            <p>No <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> answered. The <name type="TIME">noon</name>-bell rang. Still no <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> spoke. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> glanced at all the
                faces, but they were not turned to him. All the <name type="ORG">Council</name> sat with downcast eyes, as
                if in deep thought. A great dread fell on him, as if he was awaiting the
                pronouncement of some doom that he had long foreseen and vainly hoped might after
                all never be spoken. An overwhelming longing to rest and remain at peace by <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>'s
                side in <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name> filled all his heart. At last with an effort he spoke, and
                wondered to hear his own words, as if some other will was using his small voice.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`I</name> will take the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>,<q>' he said, `though I do not know the way.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Elrond</name> raised his eyes and looked at him, and <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> felt his heart pierced by the
                sudden keenness of the glance. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>f I understand a<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght all that I have heard,' he
                said, <name type="PERSON">`I</name> think that this task is appointed for you, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>; and that if you do not
                find a way, no <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> will. This is the <name type="TIME">hour</name> of the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>-folk, when they a<name type="GPE">ri</name>se from
                their quiet fields to shake the towers and counsels of the Great. Who of all the
                <name type="PERSON">Wise</name> could have foreseen it? Or, if they are wise, why should they expect to know
                it, until the <name type="TIME">hour</name> has struck?</p>
            <p>`But it is a heavy burden. So heavy that n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> could lay it on another. I do not lay
                it on you. But if you take it freely, I will say that your choice is <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght; and
                though all the mighty elf-f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends of old, <name type="ORG">Hador</name>, and H�<name type="GPE">ri</name>n, and T�<name type="GPE">ri</name>n, and <name type="PERSON">Beren</name>

            <p>`But you won't send him off al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> surely, Master?' c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, unable to contain
                himself any longer, and jumping up from the corner where he had been quietly sitting
                on the floor.</p>
            <p>`No indeed!<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name>, turning towards him with a smile. `You at least shall go
                    with him. It is hardly possible to separate you from him, even when he is
                    summ<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>d to a <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret council and you are not.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> sat down, blushing and mutte<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng. <name type="PERSON">`A</name> nice pickle we have landed ourselves in, Mr.

            <p>Later that <name type="DATE">day</name> the hobbits held a meeting of their own in <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>'s room. <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> and
                <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> were indignant when they heard that <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> had crept into the <name type="ORG">Council</name>, and had
                been chosen as <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s companion.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`I</name>t's most unfair,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>nstead of throwing him out, and clapping him in
                    c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>ns, <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name> goes and rewards him for his cheek!'</q></p>
            <p>`Rewards!<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. 'I can't imagine a more severe punishment. You are not
                    thinking what you are saying: condemned to go on this hopeless journey, a

                    while, perhaps for good.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t wonder,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>, <q>'and I wish you could. But we are envying
                    <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, not you. If you have to go, then it will be a punishment for any of us to
                    be left behind, even in <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name>. We have come a long way with you and been
                    through some stiff times. We <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t to go on.'</q></p>
            <p>`That's what I meant,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. `We hobbits ought to stick together, and we
                    will. I shall go, unless they c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>n me up. There must be some<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> with
                    intelligence in the party.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Then you certainly will not be chosen, <name type="PERSON">Pereg<name type="GPE">ri</name>n</name> <name type="PERSON">Took</name>!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, looking
                in through the window, which was near the ground. `But you are all worrying
                yourselves unnecessa<name type="GPE">ri</name>ly. Nothing is decided yet.'</p>
            <p>`Nothing decided!<q>' c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. 'Then what were you all doing? You were shut up
                    for <name type="TIME">hour</name>s.'</q></p>
            <p>"Talking,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>. `There was a deal of talk, and every<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> had an eye-opener.
                    Even old <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. I think <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>'s bit of news about <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> caught even him on
                    the hop, though he passed it off.'</q></p>
            <p>`You were wrong,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. 'You were inat<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>tive. I had already heard of it
                    from <name type="PERSON">Gwaihir</name>. If you <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t to know, the only real eye-openers, as you put it,
                    were you and <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>; and I was the only <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> that was not surp<name type="GPE">ri</name>sed.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="ORG">`Well</name>, anyway,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>, 'nothing was decided beyond choosing poor <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and
                    <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. I was afraid all the time that it might come to that, if I was let off. But
                    if you ask me, <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name> will send out a fair number, when the reports come in.
                    Have they started yet, <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>?'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Yes,'</q> said the wizard. `Some of the scouts have been sent out already. More
                will go to<name type="DATE">morrow</name>. <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name> is sending <name type="ORG">Elves</name>, and they will get in touch with the
                <name type="PRODUCT">Ranger</name>s, and maybe with <name type="PERSON">Thr</name>anduil's folk in <name type="GPE">Mirkwood</name>. And <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> has g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> with
                <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name>'s sons. We shall have to scour the lands all round for many long leagues
                before any move is made. So cheer up, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>! You will probably make quite a long
                stay here.'</p>
            <p><q>'Ah!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> gloomily. <q>'We'll just wait long enough for <name type="DATE">winter</name> to
                    come.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'That can't be helped,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>. 'It's your fault partly, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> my lad:
                insisting on waiting for my birth<name type="DATE">day</name>. A funny way of honou<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng it, I can't help
                thinking. Not the <name type="DATE">day</name> I should have chosen for letting the <name type="WORK_OF_ART">S.-B.s</name> into <name type="FAC">Bag End</name>. But
                there it is: you can't wait now fill sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng; and you can't go till the reports come
                back.</p>
            <p>When <name type="DATE">winter</name> <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> begins to bite</p>
            <p>and st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s crack in the frosty <name type="TIME">night</name>,</p>
            <p>when pools are black and trees are bare,</p>
            <p>'tis evil in the Wild to fare.</p>
            <p>But that I am afraid will be just your luck.'</p>
            <p><q>'I am afraid it will,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'We can't start until we have found
                    out about the <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`I</name> thought they were all destroyed in the flood,' said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>.</p>
            <p><q>'You cannot destroy <name type="ORG">Ring</name>wraiths like that,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. `The power of their
                master is in them, and they stand or fall by him. We hope that they were all
                unhorsed and unmasked, and so made for a while less dangerous; but we must find out
                for certain. In the meantime you should try and forget your troubles, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. I do
                not know if I can do anything to help you; but I will whisper this in your ears.
                Some<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> said that intelligence would be needed in the party. He was <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght. I think I
                shall come with you.'</p>
            <p>So great was <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s delight at this announcement that <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> left the window-sill,
                where he had been sitting, and took off his hat and bowed. <q>'I only said _I think
                    I shall come_. Do not count on anything yet. In this matter <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name> will have
                    much to say, and your f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end the <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>. Which reminds me, I <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t to see
                    <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name>. I must be off.'</q></p>
            <p>`<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w long do you think I shall have here?' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> to <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> when <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> had
                g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>.</p>
            <p>`Oh, I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t know. I can't count <name type="DATE">day</name>s in <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name>,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>. 'But quite long,
                    I should think. We can have many a good talk. What about helping me with my
                    book, and making a start on the next? Have you thought of an ending?'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Yes, several, and all are dark and unpleasant,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.</p>
            <p><q>'Oh, that won't do!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>. `Books ought to have good endings. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w would
                this do: _and they all settled down and lived together happily ever after_?'</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`I</name>t will do well, if it ever comes to that,' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.</p>
            <p><q>'Ah!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <q>'And where will they live? That's what I of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>
                wonder.'</q></p>
            <p>For a while the hobbits continued to talk and think of the past journey and of the
                pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ls that lay ahead; but such was the virtue of the land of <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name> that soon
                all fear and anxiety was lifted from their minds. The future, good or ill, was not
                forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>, but ceased to have any power over the present. Health and hope grew
                strong in them, and they were con<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>t with each good <name type="DATE">day</name> as it came, taking pleasure
                in every meal, and in every word and song.</p>
            <p>So the <name type="DATE">day</name>s slipped away, as <name type="TIME">each <name type="TIME">morning</name></name> <name type="TIME">dawn</name>ed b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght and fair, and <name type="TIME">each <name type="TIME">evening</name></name>
                followed cool and clear. But <name type="DATE">autumn</name> was <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ing fast; slowly the golden light faded
                to pale silver, and the linge<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng leaves fell from the naked trees. A wind began to
                blow chill from the <name type="LOC">Misty <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s</name> to the east. The <name type="PERSON">Hunt</name>er's <name type="PERSON">Moon</name> waxed round in
                the <name type="TIME">night</name> sky, and put to flight all the lesser stars. But low in the <name type="LOC">South</name> <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> star
                sh<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> red. <name type="TIME">Every <name type="TIME">night</name></name>, as the <name type="PERSON">Moon</name> <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ed again, it sh<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ghter and b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ghter.
                <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> could see it from his window, deep in the heavens burning like a watchful eye
                that glared above the trees on the b<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk of the valley.</p>
            <p>The hobbits had been nearly <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> <name type="DATE">months</name> in the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>use of <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name>, and <name type="DATE">November</name> had g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>
                by with the last shreds of <name type="DATE">autumn</name>, and <name type="DATE">December</name> was passing, when the scouts began
                to return. Some had g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> north beyond the sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ngs of the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>arwell into the
                Et<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>moors; and others had g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> west, and with the help of <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> and the <name type="PRODUCT">Ranger</name>s
                had searched the lands far down the <name type="ORG">Grey</name>flood, as far as <name type="ORG">Tharbad</name>, where the old
                <name type="LOC">North</name> <name type="FAC">Road</name> crossed the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver by a ruined town. Many had g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> east and south; and
                some of these had crossed the <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s and entered <name type="GPE">Mirkwood</name>, while others had
                climbed the pass at the source of the Gladden <name type="LOC">River</name>, and had come down into
                <name type="PERSON">Wilderland</name> and over the <name type="PERSON">Gladden Fields</name> and so at length had reached the old home of
                <name type="ORG">Radagast</name> at <name type="PRODUCT">Rhosgobel</name>. <name type="ORG">Radagast</name> was not there; and they had returned over the high
                pass that was called the <name type="GPE">Dim<name type="GPE">ri</name>ll</name> Stair. The sons of <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name>, <name type="ORG">Elladan</name> and <name type="ORG">Elrohir</name>,
                were the last to return; they had made a great journey, passing down the <name type="ORG">Silverlode</name>
                into a strange country, but of their errand they would not speak to any save to
                <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name>.</p>
            <p>In no region had the messengers discovered any signs or tidings of the <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s or
                other servants of the Enemy. Even from the <name type="PRODUCT">Eagle</name>s of the <name type="LOC">Misty <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s</name> they had
                learned no fresh news. Nothing had been seen or heard of <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>; but the wild wolves
                were still gathe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng, and were hunting again far up the <name type="LOC">Great <name type="LOC">River</name></name>. <name type="PERSON">Thr</name>ee of the
                black horses had been found at once drowned in the flooded <name type="ORG">Ford</name>. On the rocks of the
                rapids below it searchers discovered the bodies of <name type="CARDINAL">five</name> more, and also a long black
                cloak, slashed and tattered. Of the <name type="ORG">Black</name> <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s no other trace was to be seen, and
                nowhere was their presence to be felt. It seemed that they had vanished from the
                <name type="LOC">North</name>.</p>
            <p><q>'<name type="CARDINAL">Eight</name> out of the <name type="CARDINAL">Nine</name> are accounted for at least,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. 'It is rash
                to be too sure, yet I think that we may hope now that the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>wraiths were
                scattered, and have been obliged to return as best they could to their Master in
                <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>, empty and shapeless.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`I</name>f that is so, it will be some time before they can begin the hunt again. Of course
                the Enemy has other servants, but they will have to journey all the way to the
                borders of <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name> before they can pick up our trail. And if we are careful that
                will be hard to find. But we must delay no longer.'</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Elrond</name> summ<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>d the hobbits to him. He looked gravely at <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'The time has
                    come,'</q> he said. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>f the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> is to set out, it must go soon. But those who
                go with it must not count on their errand being aided by war or force. They must
                pass into the domain of the Enemy far from aid. Do you still hold to your word,
                <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, that you will be the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>-bearer?'</p>
            <p><q>'I do,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> will go with <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>.'</p>
            <p>`Then I cannot help you much, not even with counsel,' said <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name>. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> can foresee

            <p>`That is because you do not understand and cannot imagine what lies ahead,' said

            <p>`Neither does <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, unexpectedly supporting <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. 'Nor do any of
                    us see clearly. It is true that if these hobbits understood the danger, they
                    would not dare to go. But they would still wish to go, or wish that they dared,
                    and be shamed and unhappy. I think, <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name>, that in this matter it would be well
                    to trust rather to their f<name type="GPE">ri</name>endship than to great wisdom. Even if you chose for

                    the road to the <name type="ORG">Fire</name> by the power that is in him.'</q></p>
            <p>`You speak gravely,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name>, `but I am in doubt. The <name type="LOC">Shire</name>, I <name type="PERSON">forebode</name>, is

                    warn the people of their danger. In any case, I judge that the younger of these
                    <name type="CARDINAL">two</name>, <name type="PERSON">Pereg<name type="GPE">ri</name>n</name> <name type="PERSON">Took</name>, should remain. My heart is against his going.'</q></p>
            <p>`Then, Master <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name>, you will have to lock me in p<name type="GPE">ri</name>son, or send me home tied in a

            <p>`Let it be so then. You shall go,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name>, and he sighed. 'Now the tale of

            <p>The <name type="PRODUCT">Sword</name> of <name type="PERSON">Elen</name>dil was forged anew by <name type="PERSON">Elvish</name> smiths, and on its blade was traced a

                edge was hard and keen. And <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> gave it a new name and called it And�<name type="GPE">ri</name>l, <name type="PERSON">Flame</name>
                of the <name type="LOC">West</name>.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> and <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> walked together or sat speaking of their road and the pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ls they
                would meet; and they pondered the sto<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed and figured maps and books of lore that
                were in the house of <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name>. Sometimes <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> was with them; but he was con<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>t to
                lean on their guidance, and he spent as much time as he could with <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>.</p>
            <p>In those last <name type="DATE">day</name>s the hobbits sat together in the <name type="TIME">evening</name> in the <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>l of <name type="ORG">Fire</name>, and
                there among many tales they heard told in full the lay of <name type="PERSON">Beren</name> and L�thien and the
                winning of <name type="ORG">the Great Jewel</name>; but in the <name type="DATE">day</name>, while <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> were out and
                about, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> were to be found with <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> in his own small room. Then <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>
                would read passages from his book (which still seemed very incomplete). or scraps of
                his verses, or would take notes of <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s adventures.</p>
            <p>On the <name type="TIME">morning</name> of the last <name type="DATE">day</name> <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> was al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> with <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>, and the old hobbit pulled
                out from under his bed a wooden box. He lifted the lid and fumbled inside.</p>
            <p><q>'Here is your sword,'</q> he said. <q>'But it was broken, you know. I took it to
                    keep it safe but I've forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> to ask if the smiths could mend it. No time
                    now.. So I thought, perhaps, you would care to have this, <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t you
                know?'</q></p>
            <p>He took from the box a small sword in an old shabby leathern scabbard. Then he drew
                it, and its polished and well-<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ded blade glittered suddenly, cold and b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght.
                    <q>'This is <name type="PERSON">Sting</name>,'</q> he said, and thrust it with little effort deep into a
                wooden beam. `Take it, if you like. I shan't <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t it again, I expect.'</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> accepted it gratefully.</p>
            <p><q>'Also there is this!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>, b<name type="GPE">ri</name>nging out a parcel which seemed to be
                rather heavy for its size. He unwound several folds of old cloth, and held up a
                small shirt of mail. It was close-woven of many <name type="GPE">ri</name>ngs, as supple almost as linen,
                cold as ice, and harder than steel. It sh<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> like moonlit silver, and was studded
                with white gems. With it was a belt of pearl and crystal.</p>
            <p><q>'It's a pretty thing, isn't it?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>, moving it in the light. <name type="PERSON">`A</name>nd
                useful. It is my dwarf-mail that <name type="PERSON">Tho<name type="GPE">ri</name>n</name> gave me. I got it back from <name type="PERSON">Michel Delving</name>
                before I started, and packed it with my luggage: I brought all the mementoes of my
                Journey away with me, except the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>. But I did not expect to use this, and I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t
                need it now, except to look at sometimes. You hardly feel any w<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name> when you put it

            <p><name type="PERSON">`I</name> should look � well, I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t think I should look <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght in it,' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.</p>
            <p>`Just what I said myself,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>. 'But never mind about looks. You can wear
                    it under your outer clothes. Come on! You must share this <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret with me. <name type="PERSON">Don</name>'t
                    tell anybody else! But I should feel happier if I knew you were wea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng it. I
                    have a fancy it would turn even the knives of the <name type="ORG">Black</name> <name type="PRODUCT">Rider</name>s,'</q> he ended in
                a low voice.</p>
            <p>`Very well, I will take it,' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> put it on him, and fas<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Sting</name> upon
                the glitte<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng belt; and then <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> put over the top his old weather-stained
                breeches, tunic, and jacket.</p>
            <p><q>'Just a plain hobbit you look,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>. <q>'But there is more about you
                    now than appears on the surface. Good luck to you!'</q> He turned away and
                looked out of the window, trying to hum a tune.</p>
            <p><q>'I cannot thank you as I should, <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>, for this, and for all our past
                    kindnesses,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.</p>
            <p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Don</name>'t try!'</q> said the old hobbit, turning round and slapping him on the back.
                    `Ow!<q>' he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed. `You are too hard now to slap! But there you are: <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbits

                broke off and turned to the window again, singing softly.</p>

            <p>It was a cold grey <name type="DATE">day</name> near the end of <name type="DATE">December</name>. The <name type="LOC">East</name> Wind was streaming through
                the bare branches of the trees, and seething in the dark pines on the hills. Ragged
                clouds were hurrying overhead, dark and low. As the cheerless shadows of the early

            <p>`You should fear the many eyes of the servants of <name type="ORG">Sauron</name>,<q>' he said. 'I do not

                    he will be filled with wrath. Soon now his spies on foot and wing will be abroad
                    in the northern lands. Even of the sky above you must beware as you go on your
                    way.'</q></p>
            <p>The <name type="ORG">Company</name> took little gear of war, for their hope was in <name type="ORG">sec</name>recy not in battle.
                <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> had And�<name type="GPE">ri</name>l but no other weapon, and he went forth clad only in rusty green
                and brown. as a <name type="PRODUCT">Ranger</name> of the wilderness. <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> had a long sword, in fashion like
                And�<name type="GPE">ri</name>l but of less lineage and he bore also a shield and his war-horn.</p>
            <p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ud and clear it sounds in the valleys of the hills,'</q> he said, `and then let
                all the foes of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> flee!' Putting it to his lips he blew a blast, and the echoes
                leapt from rock to rock, and all that heard that voice in <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name> sprang to their
                feet.</p>
            <p>Slow should you be to wind that horn again, <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>, said <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name>. <q>'until you stand

            <p>`<name type="DATE">May</name>be,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>. 'But always I have let my horn cry at setting forth, and

                they had taken from the barrow; but <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> took only <name type="PERSON">Sting</name>; and his mail-coat, as
                <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> wished, remained hidden. <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> bore his staff, but girt at his side was the

                beast of burden, yet he was the only member of the <name type="ORG">Company</name> that did not seem
                depressed.</p>
            <p>Their farewells had been said in the great hall by the fire, and they were only
                waiting now for <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, who had not yet come out of the house. A gleam of firelight
                came from the open doors, and soft lights were glowing in many windows. <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>
                huddled in a cloak stood silent on the doorstep beside <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> sat with his
                head bowed to his knees; only <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name> knew fully what this <name type="TIME">hour</name> meant to him. The
                others could be seen as grey shapes in the darkness.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> was standing by the pony, sucking his teeth, and sta<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng moodily into the gloom
                where the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver roared stonily below; his desire for adventure was at its lowest
                ebb.</p>
            <p>`<name type="PERSON">Bill</name>, my lad,<q>' he said, `you oughtn't to have took up with us. You could have
                    stayed here and et the best hay till the new grass comes.'</q> <name type="PERSON">Bill</name> swished his
                tail and said nothing.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> eased the pack on his shoulders, and went over anxiously in his mind all the
                things that he had stowed in it, wonde<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng if he had forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> anything: his chief
                treasure, his cooking gear; and the little box of salt that he always car<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed and
                refilled when he could; a good supply of pipe-weed (but not near enough, I'll
                warrant); flint and tinder; <name type="PERSON">woollen hose</name>: linen; va<name type="GPE">ri</name>ous small belongings of his
                master's that <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> had forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> had stowed to b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng them out in t<name type="GPE">ri</name>umph
                when they were called for. He went through them all.</p>
            <p><q>'Rope!'</q> he muttered. `No rope! And only <name type="TIME">last <name type="TIME">night</name></name> you said to yourself: "<name type="PERSON">Sam</name>,
                what about a bit of rope? You'll <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t it, if you haven't got it:" Well, I'll <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t
                it. I can't get it now.'</p>
            <p>At that moment <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name> came out with <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, and he called the <name type="ORG">Company</name> to him.
                    <q>'This is my last word,'</q> he said in a low voice. <q>'The <name type="ORG">Ring</name>-bearer is
                    setting out on the <name type="PRODUCT">Quest</name> of <name type="LOC">Mount Doom</name>. On him al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> is any charge laid: neither
                    to cast away the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>, nor to deliver it to any servant of the Enemy nor indeed
                    to let any handle it, save members of the <name type="ORG">Company</name> and the <name type="ORG">Council</name>, and only then
                    in gravest need. The others go with him as free companions, to help him on his
                    way. You may tarry, or come back, or turn aside into other paths, as chance
                    allows. The further you go, the less easy will it be to withdraw; yet no oath or
                    bond is laid on you to go further than you will. For you do not yet know the
                    strength of your hearts, and you cannot foresee what each may meet upon the
                    road.'</q></p>
            <p>`Faithless is he that says farewell when the road darkens,' said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>.</p>
            <p><q>'<name type="DATE">May</name>be,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name>, `but let him not vow to walk in the dark, who has not
                seen the <name type="TIME">night</name>fall.'</p>
            <p><q>'Yet sworn word may strengthen quaking heart,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>.</p>
            <p>`Or break it,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name>. `<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok not too far ahead! But go now with good hearts!
                    <name type="LOC">Far</name>ewell, and may the blessing of <name type="ORG">Elves</name> and <name type="ORG">Men</name> and all Free Folk go with you.
                    <name type="DATE">May</name> the stars shine upon your faces!'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Good . . . good luck!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>, stutte<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng with the cold. <q>'I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t
                    suppose you will be able to keep a diary, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> my lad, but I shall expect a
                    full account when you get back. And <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t be too long! <name type="LOC">Far</name>ewell!'</q></p>
            <p>Many others of <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name>'s household stood in the shadows and watched them go, bidding
                them farewell with soft voices. There was no laughter, and no song or music. At last
                they turned away and faded silently into the <name type="TIME">dusk</name>.</p>
            <p>They crossed the b<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge and wound slowly up the long steep paths that led out of the
                cloven <name type="GPE">vale</name> of <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name>; and they came at length to the high moor where the wind
                hissed through the heather. Then with <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> glance at the Last <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>mely <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>use twinkling
                below them they strode away far into the <name type="TIME">night</name>.</p>
            <p>At the <name type="ORG">Ford</name> of <name type="PERSON">Bruinen</name> they left the <name type="FAC">Road</name> and turning southwards went on by narrow
                paths among the folded lands. Their purpose was to hold this course west of the
                <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s for many miles and <name type="DATE">day</name>s. The country was much rougher and more barren than
                in the green <name type="GPE">vale</name> of the <name type="LOC">Great <name type="LOC">River</name></name> in <name type="PERSON">Wilderland</name> on the other side of the range,
                and their going would be slow; but they hoped in this way to escape the notice of
                unf<name type="GPE">ri</name>endly eyes. The spies of <name type="ORG">Sauron</name> had hitherto seldom been seen in this empty
                country, and the paths were little known except to the people of <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name>.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> walked in front, and with him went <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>, who knew this land even in the
                dark. The others were in file behind, and <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> whose eyes were keen was the
                rearguard. The <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> part of their journey was hard and dreary, and <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> remembered
                little of it, save the wind. For many sunless <name type="DATE">day</name>s an icy blast came from the
                <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s in the east, and no garment seemed able to keep out its sear<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g fingers.
                Though the <name type="ORG">Company</name> was well clad, they seldom felt warm, either moving or at rest.
                They slept uneasily du<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng the middle of the <name type="DATE">day</name>, in some hollow of the land, or
                hidden under the tangled thorn-<name type="PERSON">bush</name>es that grew in thickets in many places. In the
                late <name type="TIME">after<name type="TIME">noon</name></name> they were roused by the watch, and took their chief meal: cold and
                cheerless as a rule, for they could seldom <name type="GPE">ri</name>sk the lighting of a fire. In the
                <name type="TIME">evening</name> they went on again, always as nearly southward as they could find a way.</p>
            <p>At <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> it seemed to the hobbits that although they walked and stumbled until they
                were weary, they were creeping forward like snails, and getting nowhere. Each <name type="DATE">day</name>
                the land looked much the same as it had the <name type="DATE">day</name> before. Yet steadily the mountains
                were drawing nearer. <name type="LOC">South</name> of <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name> they rose ever higher, and bent westwards;
                and <name type="QUANTITY">about the feet</name> of the main range there was tumbled an ever wider land of bleak
                hills, and deep valleys filled with turbulent waters. Paths were few and winding,
                and led them of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> only to the edge of some sheer fall, or down into treacherous
                swamps.</p>
            <p>They had been a fort<name type="TIME">night</name> on the way when the weather changed. The wind suddenly fell
                and then veered round to the south. The swift-flowing clouds lifted and melted away,
                and the sun came out, pale and b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght. There came a cold clear <name type="TIME">dawn</name> at the end of a
                long stumbling <name type="TIME">night</name>-<name type="PERSON">mar</name>ch. The travellers reached a low <name type="GPE">ri</name>dge crowned with ancient
                holly-trees whose grey-green trunks seemed to have been built out of the very st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>
                of the hills. Their dark leaves sh<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> and their ber<name type="GPE">ri</name>es glowed red in the light of
                the <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing sun.</p>
            <p>Away in the south <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> could see the dim shapes of lofty mountains that seemed now
                to stand across the path that the <name type="ORG">Company</name> was taking. At the left of this high range
                rose <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> peaks; the tallest and nearest stood up like a tooth tipped with snow;
                its great, bare, northern precipice was still largely in the shadow, but where the
                sunlight slanted upon it, it glowed red.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> stood at <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s side and looked out under his hand. `We have <name type="PERSON">don</name>e well,<q>'
                    he said. `We have reached the borders of the country that <name type="ORG">Men</name> call <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>llin; many
                    <name type="ORG">Elves</name> lived here in happier <name type="DATE">day</name>s, when <name type="ORG">Eregion</name> was its name. <name type="CARDINAL">Five</name>-and-<name type="CARDINAL">forty</name>
                    leagues as the crow flies we have come, though many long miles further our feet
                    have walked. The land and the weather will be milder now, but perhaps all the
                    more dangerous.'</q></p>
            <p>`Dangerous or not, a real sun<name type="GPE">ri</name>se is mighty welcome,' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, throwing back his
                hood and letting the <name type="TIME">morning</name> light fall on his face.</p>
            <p><q>'But the mountains are ahead of us,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. `We must have turned
                eastwards in the <name type="TIME">night</name>.'</p>
            <p><q>'No,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'But you see further ahead in the clear light. Beyond
                    those peaks the range bends round south-west. There are many maps in <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name>'s
                    house, but I suppose you never thought to look at them?'</q></p>
            <p>`Yes I did, sometimes,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>, `but I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t remember them. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> has a
                    better head for that sort of thing.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`I</name> need no map,' said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>, who had come up with <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>, and was gazing out before
                him with a strange light in his deep eyes. `There is the land where our fathers
                worked of old, and we have wrought the image of those mountains into many works of
                metal and of st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, and into many songs and tales. They stand tall in our dreams:
                <name type="PERSON">Baraz</name>, <name type="GPE">Zirak</name>, <name type="PERSON">Shath�r.</name></p>
            <p>`Only once before have I seen them from afar in waking life, but I know them and
                their names, for under them lies <name type="GPE">Khaz</name>ad-d�m, the <name type="PRODUCT">Dwarrowdelf</name>, that is now called the

                <name type="GPE">Caradhras</name>; and beyond him are <name type="PERSON">Silvertine</name> and <name type="PERSON">Cloudyhead</name>: <name type="GPE">Celebdil</name> the White, and
                <name type="PERSON">Fanuidhol</name> the <name type="ORG">Grey</name>, that we call <name type="GPE">Zirak</name>-zigil and <name type="PERSON">Bundushath�r.</name></p>
            <p>`There the <name type="LOC">Misty <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s</name> divide, and between their arms lies the deep-shadowed

            <p>`Dark is the water of Kheled-z�ram,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>, `and cold are the sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ngs of

                    may do, we at least cannot stay in that valley. We must go down the <name type="ORG">Silverlode</name>
                    into the <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret woods, and so to the <name type="LOC">Great <name type="LOC">River</name></name>, and then -'</q></p>
            <p>He paused.</p>
            <p><q>'Yes, and where then?'</q> asked <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>.</p>
            <p><q>'To the end of the journey � in the end,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'We cannot look too
                    far ahead. Let us be glad that the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> stage is safely over. I think we will
                    rest here, not only to<name type="DATE">day</name> but to<name type="TIME">night</name> as well. There is a wholesome air about
                    <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>llin. Much evil must befall a country before it wholly forgets the <name type="ORG">Elves</name>, if
                    once they dwelt there.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'That is true,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. `But the <name type="ORG">Elves</name> of this land were of a race
                strange to us of the silvan folk, and the trees and the grass do not now remember
                them: Only I hear the st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s lament them: _deep they delved us, fair they wrought
                us, high they builded us; but they are g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>_. They are g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. They sought the <name type="GPE">Haven</name>s
                <name type="DATE">long ago</name>.'</p>
            <p><name type="TIME">That <name type="TIME">morning</name></name> they lit a fire in a deep hollow shrouded by great <name type="PERSON">bush</name>es of holly, and
                their supper-breakfast was mer<name type="GPE">ri</name>er than it had been since they set out. They did not
                hurry to bed afterwards, for they expected to have <name type="TIME">all the <name type="TIME">night</name></name> to sleep in, and
                they did not mean to go on again until the <name type="TIME">evening</name> of the next <name type="DATE">day</name>. Only <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> was
                silent and restless. After a while he left the <name type="ORG">Company</name> and <name type="PERSON">wan</name>dered on to the <name type="GPE">ri</name>dge;
                there he stood in the shadow of a tree, looking out southwards and westwards, with
                his head posed as if he was lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing. Then he returned to the b<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk of the <name type="ORG">dell</name> and
                looked down at the others laughing and talking.</p>
            <p>`What is the matter, <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>?<q>' <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> called up. 'What are you looking for? Do you
                    miss the <name type="LOC">East</name> Wind?'</q></p>
            <p><q>'No indeed,'</q> he answered. `But I miss something. I have been in the country of
                <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>llin in many seasons. No folk dwell here now, but many other creatures live here
                at all times, especially birds. Yet now all things but you are silent. I can feel
                it. There is no sound for miles about us, and your voices seem to make the ground
                echo. I do not understand it.'</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> looked up with sudden interest. `But what do you guess is the reason?<q>' he
                    asked. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>s there more in it than surp<name type="GPE">ri</name>se at seeing <name type="CARDINAL">four</name> hobbits, not to mention
                    the rest of us, where people are so seldom seen or heard?'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`I</name> hope that is it,<q>' answered <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. `But I have a sense of watchfulness, and of
                    fear, that I have never had here before.'</q></p>
            <p>"Then we must be more careful,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. 'If you b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng a <name type="PRODUCT">Ranger</name> with you, it
                    is well to pay at<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>tion to him, especially if the <name type="PRODUCT">Ranger</name> is <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. We must
                    stop talking aloud, rest quietly, and set the watch.'</q></p>
            <p>It was <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>'s turn that <name type="DATE">day</name> to take the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> watch, but <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> joined him. The
                others fell asleep. Then the silence grew until even <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> felt it. The breathing of
                the sleepers could be plainly heard. The swish of the pony's tail and the occasional
                movements of his feet became loud noises. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> could hear his own joints creaking, if
                he stirred. Dead silence was around him, and over all hung a clear blue sky, as the
                <name type="ORG">Sun</name> rode up from the <name type="LOC">East</name>. Away in the <name type="LOC">South</name> a dark patch appeared, and grew, and
                drove north like flying smoke in the wind.</p>
            <p>`What's that, <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>? It <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t look like a cloud,' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> in a whisper to <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>.
                He made no answer, he was gazing in<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>tly at the sky; but before long <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> could see
                for himself what was approa<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g. Flocks of birds, flying at great speed, were
                wheeling and circling, and traversing all the land as if they were sear<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g for
                something; and they were steadily drawing nearer.</p>
            <p>`Lie flat and still!' hissed <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>, pulling <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> down into the shade of a
                holly-<name type="PERSON">bush</name>; for a whole regiment of birds had broken away suddenly from the main
                host, and came, flying low, straight towards the <name type="GPE">ri</name>dge. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> thought they were a kind
                of crow of large size. As they passed overhead, in so dense a throng that their
                shadow followed them darkly over the ground below, <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> harsh croak was heard.</p>
            <p>Not until they had dwindled into the distance, north and west, and the sky was again
                clear would <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> <name type="GPE">ri</name>se. Then he sprang up and went and wakened <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>.</p>
            <p>`Regiments of black crows are flying over all the land between the <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s and the
                    <name type="ORG">Grey</name>flood,<q>' he said, `and they have passed over <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>llin. They are not natives
                    here; they are _crebain_ out of <name type="PERSON">Fangorn</name> and <name type="GPE">Dunland</name>. I do not know what they are
                    about: possibly there is some trouble away south from which they are fleeing;
                    but I think they are spying out the land. I have also glimpsed many hawks flying
                    high up in the sky. I think we ought to move again this <name type="TIME">evening</name>. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>llin is no
                    longer wholesome for us: it is being watched.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`A</name>nd in that case so is the <name type="GPE">Redhorn</name> <name type="FAC">Gate</name>,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>; `and how we can get over
                    that without being seen, I cannot imagine. But we will think of that when we
                    must. As for moving as soon as it is dark, I am afraid that you are
                <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght.'</q></p>
            <p>`Luckily our fire made little smoke, and had burned low before the _crebain_
                    came,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>t must be put out and not lit again.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="ORG">`Well</name> if that isn't a plague and a nuisance!<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. The news: no fire, and
                    a move again by <name type="TIME">night</name>, had been broken to him, as soon as he woke in the late
                    <name type="TIME">after<name type="TIME">noon</name></name>. 'All because of a pack of crows! I had looked forward to a real good
                    meal to<name type="TIME">night</name>: something hot.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="ORG">`Well</name>, you can go on looking forward,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. `There may be many unexpected
                    feasts ahead for you. For myself I should like a pipe to smoke in comfort, and
                    warmer feet. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>wever, we are certain of <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> thing at any rate: it will get
                    warmer as we get south.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Too warm, I shouldn't wonder,'</q> muttered <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> to <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'But I'm beginning
                    to think it's time we got a sight of that <name type="FAC">Fiery <name type="LOC">Mountain</name></name> and saw the end of the
                    <name type="FAC">Road</name>, so to speak. I thought at <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> that this here <name type="GPE">Redhorn</name>, or whatever its
                    name is, might be it, till <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> spoke his piece. A fair jaw-cracker
                    dwarf-language must be!'</q> Maps conveyed nothing to <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>'s mind, and all
                distances in these strange lands seemed so vast that he was quite out of his
                reckoning.</p>
            <p>All that <name type="DATE">day</name> the <name type="ORG">Company</name> remained in hiding. The dark birds passed over now and
                again; but as the weste<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng <name type="ORG">Sun</name> grew red they disappeared southwards. At <name type="TIME">dusk</name> the
                <name type="ORG">Company</name> set out, and turning now <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> east they steered their course towards
                <name type="GPE">Caradhras</name>, which far away still glowed faintly red in the last light of the vanished
                <name type="ORG">Sun</name>. <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> by <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> white stars sprang forth as the sky faded.</p>
            <p>Guided by <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> they struck a good path. It looked to <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> like the remains of an
                ancient road, that had once been broad and well planned, from <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>llin to the
                mountain-pass. The <name type="PERSON">Moon</name>, now at the full, rose over the mountains, and cast a pale
                light in which the shadows of st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s were black. Many of them looked to have been
                worked by hands, though now they lay tumbled and ruinous in a bleak, barren
                land.</p>
            <p>It was the cold chill <name type="TIME">hour</name> before the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> stir of <name type="TIME">dawn</name>, and the moon was low. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>
                looked up at the sky. Suddenly he saw or felt a shadow pass over the high stars, as
                if for a moment they faded and then flashed out again. He shivered.</p>
            <p>`Did you see anything pass over?' he whispered to <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, who was just ahead.</p>
            <p>`No, but I felt it, whatever it was,<q>' he answered. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>t may be nothing, only a wisp
                    of thin cloud.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`I</name>t was moving fast then,<q>' muttered <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>, `and not with the wind.'</q></p>
            <p>Nothing further happened that <name type="TIME">night</name>. <name type="TIME">The next <name type="TIME">morning</name></name> <name type="TIME">dawn</name>ed even b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ghter than
                before. But the air was chill again; already the wind was turning back towards the
                east. For <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> more <name type="TIME">night</name>s they <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ched on, climbing steadily but ever more slowly as
                their road wound up into the hills, and the mountains towered up, nearer and nearer.
                On the <name type="ORDINAL">third</name> <name type="TIME">morning</name> <name type="GPE">Caradhras</name> rose before them, a mighty peak, tipped with snow
                like silver, but with sheer naked sides, dull red as if stained with blood.</p>
            <p>There was a black look in the sky, and the sun was <name type="PERSON">wan</name>. The wind had g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> now round
                to the north-east. <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> snuf<name type="ORG">fed</name> the air and looked back.</p>
            <p>`<name type="DATE">Winter</name> deepens behind us,<q>' he said quietly to <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. 'The h<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name>s away north
                    are whiter than they were; snow is lying far down their shoulders. <name type="TIME">To<name type="TIME">night</name></name> we
                    shall be on our way high <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name>wards the <name type="GPE">Redhorn</name> <name type="FAC">Gate</name>. We may well be seen by
                    watchers on that narrow path, and <name type="ORG">waylaid</name> by some evil; but the weather may
                    prove a more deadly enemy than any. What do you think of your course now,
                    <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>?'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> overheard these words, and understood that <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> and <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> were continuing
                some debate that had begun long before. He lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed anxiously.</p>
            <p><q>'I think no good of our course from beginning to end, as you know well,
                    <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>,'</q> answered <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <name type="PERSON">`A</name>nd pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ls known and unknown will grow as we go
                on. But we must go on; and it is no good our delaying the passage of the mountains.
                Further south there are no passes, till <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> comes to the <name type="ORG">Gap</name> of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>. I do not
                trust that way since your news of <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>. Who knows which side now the <name type="PERSON">mar</name>shals of
                the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>rse-lords serve?'</p>
            <p><q>'Who knows indeed!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. `But there is another way, and not by the
                pass of <name type="GPE">Caradhras</name>: the dark and <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret way that we have spoken of.'</p>
            <p>
                <q>'But let us not speak of it again! Not yet. Say nothing to the others I beg, not
                    until it is plain that there is no other way.'</q>
            </p>
            <p><q>'We must decide before we go further,'</q> answered <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>.</p>
            <p><q>'Then let us weigh the matter in our minds, while the others rest and sleep,'</q>
                said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>.</p>
            <p>In the late <name type="TIME">after<name type="TIME">noon</name></name>, while the others were finishing their breakfast, <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> and
                <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> went aside together and stood looking at <name type="GPE">Caradhras</name>. Its sides were now dark
                and sullen, and its head was in grey cloud. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> watched them, wonde<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng which way
                the debate would go. When they returned to the <name type="ORG">Company</name> <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> spoke, and then he
                knew that it had been decided to face the weather and the high pass. He was
                relieved. He could not guess what was the other dark and <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret way, but the very
                mention of it had seemed to fill <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> with dismay, and <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> was glad that it had
                been aban<name type="PERSON">don</name>ed.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`From</name> signs that we have seen lately,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, 'I fear that the <name type="GPE">Redhorn</name> <name type="FAC">Gate</name>
                    may be watched; and also I have doubts of the weather that is coming up behind.
                    <name type="PERSON">Snow</name> may come. We must go with all the speed that we can. Even so it will take
                    us <name type="CARDINAL">more than <name type="CARDINAL">two</name></name> <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ches before we reach the top of the pass. Dark will come
                    <name type="TIME">early this <name type="TIME">evening</name></name>. We must leave as soon as you can get ready.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'I will add a word of advice, if I may,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>. <q>'I was born under
                    the shadow of the White <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s and know something of journeys in the high
                    places. We shall meet bitter cold, if no worse, before we come down on the other
                    side. It will not help us to keep so <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret that we are frozen to death. When we
                    leave here, where there are still a few trees and <name type="PERSON">bush</name>es, each of us should
                    carry a faggot of wood, as large as he can bear.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'And <name type="PERSON">Bill</name> could take a bit more, couldn't you lad?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. The pony looked
                at him mournfully.</p>
            <p><q>'Very well,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. `But we must not use the wood � not unless it is a
                choice between fire and death.'</p>
            <p>The <name type="ORG">Company</name> set out again with good speed at <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>; but soon their way became steep
                and difficult. The twisting and climbing road had in many places almost disappeared,
                and was blocked with many fallen st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s. <name type="TIME">The <name type="TIME">night</name></name> grew deadly dark under great
                clouds. A bitter wind swirled among the rocks. By <name type="TIME">mid<name type="TIME">night</name></name> they had climbed to the
                knees of the great mountains. The narrow path now wound under a sheer wall of cliffs
                to the left, above which the g<name type="GPE">ri</name>m flanks of <name type="GPE">Caradhras</name> towered up invisible in the
                gloom; on the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght was a <name type="LOC">gulf</name> of darkness where the land fell suddenly into a deep
                ravine.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Labo<name type="GPE">ri</name>ously</name> they climbed a sharp slope and halted for a moment at the top. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> felt
                a soft touch on his face. He put out his arm and saw the dim white flakes of snow
                settling on his sleeve.</p>
            <p>They went on. But before long the snow was falling fast, filling all the air, and
                swirling into <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s eyes. The dark bent shapes of <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> and <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> only a pace
                or <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> ahead could hardly be seen.</p>
            <p><q>'I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t like this at all,'</q> panted <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> just behind. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Snow</name>'s all <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght on a
                    fine <name type="TIME">morning</name>, but I like to be in bed while it's falling. I wish this lot would
                    go off to <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbiton! Folk might welcome it there.'</q> Except on the high moors
                of the <name type="LOC">North</name>farthing a heavy fall was rare in the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>, and was regarded as a
                pleasant event and a chance for fun. No living hobbit (save <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>) could remember
                the Fell <name type="DATE">Winter</name> of 1311, when the white wolves invaded the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> over the frozen
                <name type="ORG">Brand</name>ywine.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> halted. <name type="PERSON">Snow</name> was thick on his hood and shoulders; it was already ankle-deep
                about his boots.</p>
            <p>"This is what I feared,<q>' he said. `What do you say now, <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>?'</q></p>
            <p><q>'That I feared it too,'</q> <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> answered, `but less than other things. I knew
                the <name type="GPE">ri</name>sk of snow, though it seldom falls heavily so far south, save high up in the
                mountains. But we are not high yet; we are still far down, where the paths are
                usually open all <name type="DATE">the <name type="DATE">winter</name></name>.'</p>
            <p><q>'I wonder if this is a cont<name type="GPE">ri</name>vance of the Enemy,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>. "They say in
                my land that he can govern the storms in the <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s of <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name> that stand upon the
                borders of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>. He has strange powers and many allies.'</p>
            <p><q>'His arm has grown long indeed,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>, `if he can draw snow down from
                the <name type="LOC">North</name> to trouble us here <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name> leagues away.'</p>
            <p><q>'His arm has grown long,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>.</p>
            <p>While they were halted, the wind died down, and the snow slackened until it almost
                ceased. They tramped on again. But they had not g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> more than a furlong when the
                storm returned with fresh fury. The wind whistled and the snow became a blinding
                blizzard. Soon even <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> found it hard to keep going. The hobbits, bent nearly
                double, toiled along behind the taller folk, but it was plain that they could not go
                much further, if the snow continued. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s feet felt like lead. <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> was
                dragging behind. Even <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>, as stout as any dwarf could be, was grumbling as he
                trudged.</p>
            <p>The <name type="ORG">Company</name> halted suddenly, as if they had come to an agreement without any words
                being spoken. They heard ee<name type="GPE">ri</name>e noises in the darkness round them. It may have been
                only a t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ck of the wind in the cracks and gullies of the rocky wall, but the sounds
                were those of sh<name type="GPE">ri</name>ll c<name type="GPE">ri</name>es, and wild howls of laughter. <name type="ORG">St<name type="CARDINAL">one</name></name>s began to fall from
                the mountain-side, whistling over their heads, or crashing on the path beside them.
                Every now and again they heard a dull rumble, as a great boulder rolled down from
                hidden h<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name>s above.</p>
            <p>`We cannot go further to<name type="TIME">night</name>,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>. `Let those call it the wind who

            <p><q>'But what can we do?'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> miserably. He was leaning on <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> and
                <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, and he was shive<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng.</p>
            <p>`Either stop where we are, or go back,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. 'It is no good going on.
                    Only a little higher, if I remember <name type="GPE">ri</name>ghtly, this path leaves the cliff and runs
                    into a wide shallow trough at the bot<name type="PERSON">tom</name> of a long hard slope. We should have no
                    shelter there from snow, or st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s � or anything else.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`A</name>nd it is no good going back while the storm holds,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. `We have
                    passed no place on the way up that offered more shelter than this cliff-wall we
                    are under now.'</q></p>
            <p>`Shelter!<q>' muttered <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>f this is shelter, then <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> wall and no roof make a
                    house.'</q></p>
            <p>The <name type="ORG">Company</name> now gathered together as close to the cliff as they could. It faced
                southwards, and near the bot<name type="PERSON">tom</name> it leaned out a little, so that they hoped it would
                give them some protection from the northerly wind and from <name type="DATE">the fall</name>ing st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s. But
                eddying blasts swirled round them from every side, and the snow flowed down in ever
                denser clouds.</p>
            <p>They huddled together with their backs to the wall. <name type="PERSON">Bill</name> the pony stood patiently but
                dejectedly in front of the hobbits, and screened them a little; but before long the
                d<name type="GPE">ri</name>fting snow was above his hocks, and it went on mounting. If they had had no
                larger companions the hobbits would soon have been entirely bu<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed.</p>
            <p>A great sleepiness came over <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>; he felt himself sinking fast into a warm and hazy
                dream. He thought a fire was heating his toes, and out of the shadows on the other
                side of the h<name type="LOC">earth</name> he heard <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>'s voice speaking_. I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t think much of your
                diary_, he said. _<name type="PERSON">Snow</name>storms on <name type="DATE">January the twelfth</name>: there was no need to come back
                to report that!_</p>
            <p>_But I <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ted rest and sleep, <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>_, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> answered with an effort, when he felt
                himself shaken, and he came back painfully to wakefulness. <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> had lifted him
                off the ground out of a nest of snow.</p>
            <p>`This will be the death of the <name type="CARDINAL">half</name>lings, <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>t is useless
                    to sit here until the snow goes over our heads. We must do something to save
                    ourselves.'</q></p>
            <p>`Give them this,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, sear<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g in his pack and drawing out a leathern
                    flask. `Just a mouthful each � for all of us. It is very precious. It is
                    _<name type="PERSON">miruvor</name>_, the cordial of <name type="GPE">Imlad<name type="GPE">ri</name>s</name>. <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name> gave it to me at our parting. Pass it
                    round!'</q></p>
            <p>As soon as <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> had swallowed a little of the warm and fragrant liquor he felt a new
                strength of heart, and the heavy drowsiness left his limbs. The others also revived
                and found fresh hope and vigour. But the snow did not relent. It whirled about them
                thicker than ever, and the wind blew louder.</p>
            <p><q>'What do you say to fire?'</q> asked <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> suddenly. <q>'The choice seems near
                    now between fire and death, <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. Doubtless we shall be hidden from all
                    unf<name type="GPE">ri</name>endly eyes when the snow has covered us, but that will not help
                us.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'You may make a fire, if you can,'</q> answered <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'If there are any
                    watchers that can endure this storm, then they can see us, fire or no.'</q> But
                though they had brought wood and kindlings by the advice of <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>, it passed the
                skill of <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name> or even <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Dwarf</name> to st<name type="GPE">ri</name>ke a flame that would hold amid the swirling wind
                or catch in the wet fuel. At last reluctantly <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> himself took a hand. Picking
                up a faggot he held it aloft for a moment, and then with a word of command_, <name type="PERSON">naur</name> an
                edraith ammen!_ he thrust the end of his staff into the midst of it. At once a great
                spout of green and blue flame sprang out, and the wood flared and sputtered.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`I</name>f there are any to see, then I at least am revealed to them,<q>' he said. 'I have
                    w<name type="GPE">ri</name>t<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> _<name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> is here_ in signs that all can read from <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name> to the
                    mouths of <name type="GPE">Anduin</name>.'</q></p>
            <p>But the <name type="ORG">Company</name> cared no longer for watchers or unf<name type="GPE">ri</name>endly eyes. Their hearts were
                rejoiced to see the light of the fire. The wood burned mer<name type="GPE">ri</name>ly; and though all round
                it the snow hissed, and pools of slush crept under their feet, they warmed their
                hands gladly at the blaze. There they stood, stooping in a circle round the little
                dancing and blowing flames. A red light was on their tired and anxious faces; behind
                them the <name type="TIME">night</name> was like a black wall.</p>
            <p>But the wood was burning fast, and the snow still fell.</p>
            <p>The fire burned low. and the last faggot was thrown on.</p>
            <p><name type="TIME">The <name type="TIME">night</name></name> is getting old,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. "The <name type="TIME">dawn</name> is not far off.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`I</name>f any <name type="TIME">dawn</name> can pierce these clouds,' said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> stepped out of the circle and stared up into the blackness. <q>'The snow is
                    growing less,'</q> he said, `and the wind is quieter.'</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> gazed wea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ly at the flakes still falling out of the dark to be revealed white
                for a moment in the light of the dying fire; but for a long time he could see no
                sign of their slackening. Then suddenly, as sleep was beginning to creep over him
                again, he was aware that the wind had indeed fallen, and the flakes were becoming
                larger and fewer. Very slowly a dim light began to grow. At last the snow stopped
                altogether.</p>
            <p>As the light grew stronger it showed a silent shrouded world. Below their refuge were
                white humps and domes and shapeless deeps beneath which the path that they had
                trodden was altogether lost; but the h<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name>s above were hidden in great clouds still
                heavy with the threat of snow.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> looked up and shook his head. `<name type="GPE">Caradhras</name> has not forgiven us.<q>' he said. <name type="PERSON">`He</name>
                    has more snow yet to fling at us, if we go on. The so<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>r we go back and down
                    the better.'</q></p>
            <p>To this all agreed, but their retreat was now difficult. It might well prove
                impossible. Only a few paces from the ashes of their fire the snow lay many feet
                deep, higher than the heads of the hobbits; in places it had been scooped and piled
                by the wind into great d<name type="GPE">ri</name>fts against the cliff.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`I</name>f <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> would go before us with a b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght flame, he might melt a path for you,'
                said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. The storm had troubled him little, and he al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the <name type="ORG">Company</name>
                remained still light of heart.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`I</name>f <name type="ORG">Elves</name> could fly over mountains, they might fetch the <name type="ORG">Sun</name> to save us,<q>' answered
                    <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. `But I must have something to work on. I cannot burn snow.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="ORG">`Well</name>,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>, `when heads are at a loss bodies must serve, as we say in my
                    country. The strongest of us must seek a way. See! Though all is now snow-clad,
                    our path, as we came up, turned about that shoulder of rock down yonder. It was
                    there that the snow <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> began to burden us. If we could reach that point,
                    maybe it would prove easier beyond. It is no more than a furlong off, I
                    guess.'</q></p>
            <p>`Then let us force a path thither, you and I!' said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> was the tallest of the <name type="ORG">Company</name>, but <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>, little less in h<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name>, was
                broader and heavier in build. He led the way, and <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> followed him. Slowly they
                moved off, and were soon toiling heavily. In places the snow was breast-high, and
                of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> seemed to bc swimming or burrowing with his great arms rather than
                walking.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> watched them for a while with a smile upon his lips, and then he turned to
                the others. `The strongest must seek a way, say you? But I say: let a ploughman
                plough, but choose an otter for swimming, and for running light over grass and leaf
                or over snow-an <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name>.'</p>
            <p>With that he sprang forth nimbly, and then <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> noticed as if for the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> time,
                though he had long known it, that the <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name> had no boots, but wore only light shoes,
                as he always did, and his feet made little imp<name type="GPE">ri</name>nt in the snow.</p>
            <p><q>'<name type="LOC">Far</name>ewell!'</q> he said to <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> go to find the <name type="ORG">Sun</name>!' Then swift as a runner
                over firm sand he shot away, and quickly overtaking the toiling men, with a wave of
                his hand he passed them, and sped into the distance, and vanished round the rocky
                turn.</p>
            <p>The others waited huddled together, wat<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g until <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> and <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> dwindled into
                black specks in the whi<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ess. At length they too passed from sight. The time
                dragged on. The clouds lowered, and now a few flakes of snow came curling down
                again.</p>
            <p><name type="TIME">An <name type="TIME">hour</name></name>, maybe, went by, though it seemed far longer, and then at last they saw
                <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> coming back. At the same time <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> and <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> reappeared round the bend
                far behind him and came labou<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng up the slope.</p>
            <p><name type="ORG">`Well</name>,<q>' c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> as he ran up, <name type="PERSON">`I</name> have not brought the <name type="ORG">Sun</name>. She is walking in
                    the blue fields of the <name type="LOC">South</name>, and a little wreath of snow on this <name type="GPE">Redhorn</name>
                    hillock troubles her not at all. But I have brought back a gleam of good hope
                    for those who are doomed to go on feet. There is the greatest wind-d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ft of all
                    just beyond the turn, and there our Strong <name type="ORG">Men</name> were almost bu<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed. They
                    despaired, until I returned and told them that the d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ft was little wider than a
                    wall. And on the other side the snow suddenly grows less, while further down it
                    is no more than a white coverlet to cool a hobbit's toes.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`A</name>h, it is as I said,<q>' growled <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. 'It was no ordinary storm. It is the ill
                    will of <name type="GPE">Caradhras</name>. He does not love <name type="ORG">Elves</name> and <name type="ORG">Dwarves</name>, and that d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ft was laid
                    to cut off our escape.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'But happily your <name type="GPE">Caradhras</name> has forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> that you have <name type="ORG">Men</name> with you,'</q> said
                <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>, who came up at that moment. <name type="PERSON">`A</name>nd doughty <name type="ORG">Men</name> too, if I may say it; though
                lesser men with spades might have served you better. Still, we have thrust a lane
                through the d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ft; and for that all here may be grateful who cannot run as light as
                <name type="ORG">Elves</name>.'</p>
            <p>`But how are we to get down there, even if you have cut through the d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ft?' said
                <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>, voicing the thought of all the hobbits.</p>
            <p><q>'Have hope!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>. <q>'I am weary, but I still have some strength
                    left, and <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> too. We will bear the little folk. The others no doubt will
                    make shift to tread the path behind us. Come, Master <name type="PERSON">Pereg<name type="GPE">ri</name>n</name>! I will begin with
                    you.'</q></p>
            <p>He lifted up the hobbit. 'Cling to my back! I shall need my arms' he said and strode
                forward. <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> with <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> came behind. <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> <name type="PERSON">mar</name>velled at his strength, seeing
                the passage that he had already forced with no other tool than his great limbs. Even
                now, burdened as he was, he was widening the track for those who followed, thrusting
                the snow aside as he went.</p>
            <p>They came at length to the great d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ft. It was flung across the mountain-path like a
                sheer and sudden wall, and its crest, sharp as if shaped with knives, reared up more
                than twice the h<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name> of <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>; but through the middle a passage had been bea<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>,
                <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing and falling like a b<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge. On the far side <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> were set down,
                and there they waited with <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> for the rest of the <name type="ORG">Company</name> to ar<name type="GPE">ri</name>ve.</p>
            <p>After a while <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> returned carrying <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. Behind in the narrow but now
                well-trodden track came <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, leading <name type="PERSON">Bill</name> with <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> perched among the baggage.
                Last came <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> carrying <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. They passed through the lane; but hardly had <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>
                touched the ground when with a deep rumble there rolled down a fall of st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s and
                slithe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng snow. The spray of it <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> blinded the <name type="ORG">Company</name> as they crouched against
                the cliff, and when the air cleared again they saw that the path was blocked behind
                them.</p>
            <p>`Enough, enough!<q>' c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. 'We are departing as quickly as we may!'</q> And
                indeed with that last stroke the malice of the mountain seemed to be expended, as if
                <name type="GPE">Caradhras</name> was satisfied that the invaders had been bea<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> off and would not dare to
                return. The threat of snow lifted; the clouds began to break and the light grew
                broader.</p>
            <p>As <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> had reported, they found that the snow became steadily more shallow as
                they went down, so that even the hobbits could trudge along. Soon they all stood
                once more on the flat shelf at the head of the steep slope where they had felt the
                <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> flakes of snow the <name type="TIME">night</name> before.</p>
            <p><name type="TIME">The <name type="TIME">morning</name></name> was now far advanced. From the high place they looked back westwards over

            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s legs ached. He was chilled to the b<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> and hungry; and his head was dizzy as
                he thought of the long and painful <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ch downhill. <name type="ORG">Black</name> specks swam before his
                eyes. He rubbed them, but the black specks remained. In the distance below him, but
                still high above the lower foothills, dark dots were circling in the air.</p>
            <p>`The birds again!' said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>, pointing down.</p>
            <p><q>'That cannot be helped now,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. `Whether they are good or evil, or
                have nothing to do with us at all, we must go down at once. Not even on the knees of

            <p>A cold wind flowed down behind them, as they turned their backs on the <name type="GPE">Redhorn</name> <name type="FAC">Gate</name>,
                and stumbled wea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ly down the slope. <name type="GPE">Caradhras</name> had defeated them.</p>

            <p>A Journey in the Dark</p>
            <p>It was <name type="TIME">evening</name>, and the grey light was again <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ing fast, when they halted for the
                <name type="TIME">night</name>. They were very weary. The mountains were veiled in deepening <name type="TIME">dusk</name>, and the
                wind was cold. <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> spared them <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> more mouthful each of the <name type="PERSON">miruvor</name> of
                <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name>. When they had ea<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> some food he called a council.</p>
            <p><q>'We cannot, of course, go on again to<name type="TIME">night</name>,'</q> he said. `The attack on the
                <name type="GPE">Redhorn</name> <name type="FAC">Gate</name> has tired us out, and we must rest here for a while.'</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`A</name>nd then where are we to go? ' asked <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.</p>
            <p><q>'We still have our journey and our errand before us,'</q> answered <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. `We
                have no choice but to go on, or to return to <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name>.'</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>'s face b<name type="GPE">ri</name>gh<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed visibly at the mere mention of return to <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name>; <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>
                and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> looked up hopefully. But <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> and <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> made no sign. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> looked
                troubled.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`I</name> wish I was back there,' he said. `But how can I return without shame � unless
                there is indeed no other way, and we are already defeated? '</p>
            <p>`You are <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>: `to go back is to admit defeat and face
                    worse defeat to come. If we go back now, then the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> must remain there: we
                    shall not be able to set out again. Then so<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>r or later <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name> will be
                    besieged, and after a b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ef and bitter time it will be destroyed. The
                    <name type="ORG">Ring</name>wraiths are deadly enemies, but they are only shadows yet of the power and
                    terror they would possess if the Ruling <name type="ORG">Ring</name> was on their master's hand
                    again.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Then we must go on, if there is a way,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> with a sigh. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> sank back
                into gloom.</p>
            <p>`There is a way that we may attempt,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> thought from the beginning,
                    when <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> I considered this journey, that we should try it. But it is not a
                    pleasant way, and I have not spoken of it to the <name type="ORG">Company</name> before. <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> was
                    against it, until the pass over the mountains had at least been t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`I</name>f it is a worse road than the <name type="GPE">Redhorn</name> <name type="FAC">Gate</name>, then it must be evil indeed,<q>' said
                    <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. `But you had better tell us about it, and let us know the worst at
                    once.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'The road that I speak of leads to the <name type="ORG">Mines</name> of <name type="GPE">Mo<name type="GPE">ri</name>a</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. Only
                <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> lifted up his head; a smoulde<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng fire was in his eyes. On all the others a
                dread fell at the mention of that name. Even to the hobbits it was a legend of vague
                fear:</p>
            <p>`The road may lead to <name type="GPE">Mo<name type="GPE">ri</name>a</name>, but how can we hope that it will lead through <name type="GPE">Mo<name type="GPE">ri</name>a</name>? '
                said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> darkly.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`I</name>t is a name of ill omen,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>. `Nor do I see the need to go there. If
                    we cannot cross the mountains, let us journey southwards, until we come to the
                    <name type="ORG">Gap</name> of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>, where men are f<name type="GPE">ri</name>endly to my people, taking the road that I
                    followed on my way hither. Or we might pass by and cross the <name type="PERSON">Isen</name> into
                    <name type="PERSON">Langstrand</name> and <name type="ORG">Lebennin</name>, and so come to <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> from the regions nigh to the
                    sea.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Things have changed since you came north, <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>,'</q> answered <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. 'Did
                you not hear what I told you of <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>? With him I may have business of my own ere
                all is over. But the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> must not come near <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard, if that can by any means be
                prevented. The <name type="ORG">Gap</name> of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> is closed to us while we go with the <name type="ORG">Bear</name>er.</p>
            <p>'As for the longer road: we cannot af<name type="ORG">ford</name> the time. We might spend <name type="DATE">a <name type="DATE">year</name></name> in such a
                journey, and we should pass through many lands that are empty and harbourless. Yet
                they would not be safe. The watchful eyes both of <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name> and of the Enemy are on
                them. When you came north, <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>, you were in the Enemy's eyes only <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> stray
                <name type="PERSON">wan</name>derer from the <name type="LOC">South</name> and a matter of small concern to him: his mind was busy with
                the pursuit of the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>. But you return now as a member of the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>'s <name type="ORG">Company</name>, and
                you are in pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>l as long as you remain with us. The danger will increase with every
                league that we go south under the naked sky.</p>
            <p>`Since our open attempt on the mountain-pass our plight has become more desperate, I
                fear. I see now little hope, if we do not soon vanish from sight for a while, and
                cover our trail. Therefore I advise that we should go neither over the mountains,
                nor round them, but under them. That is a road at any rate that the Enemy will least
                expect us to take.'</p>
            <p>`We do not know what he expects,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>. <name type="PERSON">`He</name> may watch all roads, likely
                    and unlikely. In that case to enter <name type="GPE">Mo<name type="GPE">ri</name>a</name> would be to walk into a trap, hardly
                    better than knocking at the gates of the Dark <name type="FAC">Tower</name> itself. The name of <name type="GPE">Mo<name type="GPE">ri</name>a</name> is
                    black.'</q></p>
            <p>`You speak of what you do not know, when you liken <name type="GPE">Mo<name type="GPE">ri</name>a</name> to the stronghold of
                <name type="ORG">Sauron</name>,' answered <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of you have ever been in the dungeons of the
                Dark <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd, and only in his older and lesser dwelling in <name type="PERSON">Dol Guldur</name>. Those who pass
                the gates of <name type="FAC">Barad-d</name>�r do not return. But I would not lead you into <name type="GPE">Mo<name type="GPE">ri</name>a</name> if there
                were no hope of coming out again. If there are <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s there, it may prove ill for us,
                that is true. But most of the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s of the <name type="LOC">Misty <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s</name> were scattered or
                destroyed in the <name type="EVENT">Battle</name> of <name type="CARDINAL">Five</name> Armies. The <name type="PRODUCT">Eagle</name>s report that <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s are gathe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng
                again from afar; but there is a hope that <name type="GPE">Mo<name type="GPE">ri</name>a</name> is still free.</p>
            <p>`There is even a chance that <name type="ORG">Dwarves</name> are there, and that in some deep hall of his
                fathers, <name type="PERSON">Balin</name> son of Fundin may be found. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>wever it may prove, <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> must tread the
                path that need chooses!'</p>
            <p>
                <q>'I will tread the path with you, <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>! ' said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. 'I will go and look on
                    the halls of Du<name type="GPE">ri</name>n, whatever may wait there-if you can find the doors that are

            </p>
            <p>'Good, <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>! ' said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. `You encourage me. We will seek the hidden doors
                together. And we will come through. In the ruins of the <name type="ORG">Dwarves</name>, a dwarf's head will
                be less easy to bewilder than <name type="ORG">Elves</name> or <name type="ORG">Men</name> or <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbits. Yet it will not be the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>
                time that I have been to <name type="GPE">Mo<name type="GPE">ri</name>a</name>. I sought there long for <name type="PERSON">Thr</name>�in son of <name type="PERSON">Thr</name>�r after he
                was lost. I passed through, and I came out again alive! '</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`I</name> too once passed the <name type="GPE">Dim<name type="GPE">ri</name>ll</name> <name type="FAC">Gate</name>,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> quietly; 'but though I also
                    came out again, the memory is very evil. I do not wish to enter <name type="GPE">Mo<name type="GPE">ri</name>a</name> a <name type="ORG">sec</name>ond
                    time.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'And I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t wish to enter it even once,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>.</p>
            <p><q>'Nor me,'</q> muttered <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>.</p>
            <p>`Of course not! ' said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. 'Who would? But the question is: who will follow me,
                if I lead you there? '</p>
            <p><q>'I will,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> eagerly.</p>
            <p><q>'I will,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> heavily. `You followed my lead almost to disaster in
                the snow, and have said no word of blame. I will follow your lead now � if this last
                warning does not move you. It is not of the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>, nor of us others that I am
                thinking now, but of you, <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. And I say to you: if you pass the doors of <name type="GPE">Mo<name type="GPE">ri</name>a</name>,
                beware! '</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`I</name> will _not_ go,' said <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>; 'not unless the vote of the whole company is against
                me. What do <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> and the little folk say? The <name type="ORG">Ring</name>-bearer's voice surely should
                be heard? '</p>
            <p><q>'I do not wish to go to <name type="GPE">Mo<name type="GPE">ri</name>a</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>.</p>
            <p>The hobbits said nothing. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> looked at <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. At last <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> spoke. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> do not wish to
                go,' he said; `but neither do I wish to refuse the advice of <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. I beg that
                there should be no vote, until we have slept on it. <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> will get votes easier in
                the light of the <name type="TIME">morning</name> than in this cold gloom. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w the wind howls! '</p>
            <p>At these words all fell into silent thought. They heard the wind hissing among the
                rocks and trees, and there was a howling and wailing round them in the empty spaces
                of the <name type="TIME">night</name>.</p>
            <p>Suddenly <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> leapt to his feet. '<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w the wind howls! ' he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed. 'It is howling
                with <name type="PERSON">wolf</name>-voices. The <name type="FAC">Wargs</name> have come west of the <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s! '</p>
            <p>'Need we wait until <name type="TIME">morning</name> then? ' said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>t is as I said. The hunt is up!
                Even if we live to see the <name type="TIME">dawn</name>, who now will wish to journey south by <name type="TIME">night</name> with

            <p>`There was a door south-west of <name type="GPE">Caradhras</name>, some <name type="CARDINAL">fifteen</name> miles as the crow flies, and
                maybe <name type="CARDINAL">twenty</name> as the <name type="PERSON">wolf</name> runs,' answered <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> g<name type="GPE">ri</name>mly.</p>
            <p><q>'Then let us start as soon as it is light to<name type="DATE">morrow</name>, if we can,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>.
                    <q>'The <name type="PERSON">wolf</name> that <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> hears is worse than the orc that <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> fears.'</q></p>
            <p>`True!<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>, loosening his sword in its sheath. `But where the warg
                    howls, there also the orc prowls.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`I</name> wish I had taken <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name>'s advice,<q>' muttered <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> to <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> am no good after
                    all. There is not enough of the breed of <name type="ORG">Bandobras the <name type="PERSON">Bullroarer</name></name> in me: these
                    howls freeze my blood. I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t ever remember feeling so wretched.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'My heart's <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght down in my toes, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <q>'But we aren't
                    et<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> yet, and there are some stout folk here with us. Whatever may be in store
                    for old <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, I'll wager it isn't a <name type="PERSON">wolf</name>'s belly.'</q></p>
            <p>For their de<name type="PERSON">fen</name>ce in the <name type="TIME">night</name> the <name type="ORG">Company</name> climbed to the top of the small hill under
                which they had been shelte<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng. it was crowned with a knot of old and twisted trees,
                about which lay a broken circle of boulder st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s. In the midst of this they lit a
                fire, for there was no hope that darkness and silence would keep their trail from
                discovery by the hunting packs.</p>
            <p>Round the fire they sat, and those that were not on guard dozed uneasily. Poor <name type="PERSON">Bill</name>
                the pony trembled and sweated where he stood. The howling of the wolves was now all
                round them, sometimes nearer and sometimes further off. In the dead of the <name type="TIME">night</name>
                many shining eyes were seen pee<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng over the brow of the hill. Some advanced almost
                to the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng of st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s. At a gap in the circle a great dark <name type="PERSON">wolf</name>-shape could be seen
                halted, gazing at them. A shudde<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng howl broke from him, as if he were a captain
                summoning his pack to the assault.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> stood up and strode forward, holding his staff aloft. <q>'Lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>, <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>und of
                    <name type="ORG">Sauron</name>! ' he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed. `<name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> is here. Fly, if you value your foul skin! I will
                    sh<name type="GPE">ri</name>vel you from tail to snout, if you come within this <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng.'</q></p>
            <p>The <name type="PERSON">wolf</name> snarled and sprang towards them with a great leap. At that moment there was
                a sharp t<name type="PERSON">wan</name>g. <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> had loosed his bow. There was a hideous yell, and the leaping
                shape thudded to the ground; the elvish arrow had pierced its throat. The wat<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g
                eyes were suddenly extinguished. <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> and <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> strode forward, but the hill
                was deserted; the hunting packs had fled. All about them the darkness grew silent,
                and no cry came on the sighing wind.</p>
            <p><name type="TIME">The <name type="TIME">night</name></name> was old, and westward the <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ing moon was setting. gleaming fitfully
                through the breaking clouds. Suddenly <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> started from sleep. Without warning a
                storm of howls broke out fierce and wild all about the camp. A great host of <name type="FAC">Wargs</name>
                had gathered silently and was now attacking them from every side at once.</p>
            <p>`Fling fuel on the fire!<q>' c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> to the hobbits. `Draw your blades, and
                    stand back to back!'</q></p>
            <p>In the leaping light, as the fresh wood blazed up, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> saw many grey shapes sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng
                over the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng of st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s. More and more followed. <name type="PERSON">Thr</name>ough the throat of <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> huge
                leader <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> passed his sword with a thrust; with a great sweep <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> hewed the
                head off another. Beside them <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> stood with his stout legs apart, wielding his
                dwarf-axe. The bow of <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> was singing.</p>
            <p>In the wave<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng firelight <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> seemed suddenly to grow: he rose up, a great
                menacing shape like the monument of some ancient king of st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> set upon a hill.
                <name type="PERSON">Stooping</name> like a cloud, he lifted a burning branch and strode to meet the wolves.
                They gave back before him. High in the air he tossed the blazing brand. It flared
                with a sudden white radiance like lightning; and his voice rolled like thunder.</p>
            <p>`_Naur an edraith ammen! <name type="PERSON">Naur dan</name> i ngaurhoth!_' he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed.</p>
            <p>There was a roar and a crackle, and the tree above him burst into a leaf and bloom of
                blinding flame. The fire leapt from tree-top to tree-top. The whole hill was crowned
                with dazzling light. The swords and knives of the de<name type="PERSON">fen</name>ders sh<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> and flickered. The
                last arrow of <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> kindled in the air as it flew, and plunged burning into the
                heart of a great <name type="PERSON">wolf</name>-chieftain. All the others fled.</p>
            <p>Slowly the fire died till nothing was left but falling ash and sparks; a bitter smoke
                curled above the burned tree-stumps, and blew darkly from the hill, as the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>
                light of <name type="TIME">dawn</name> came dimly in the sky. Their enemies were routed and did not
                return.</p>
            <p>`What did I tell you, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>? <q>' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, she/thing his sword. `Wolves won't
                    get him. That was an eye-opener, and no mistake! Nearly singed the <name type="PERSON">hai</name>r off my
                    head!'</q></p>
            <p>When the full light of the <name type="TIME">morning</name> came no signs of the wolves were to be found, and
                they looked in vain for the bodies of the dead. No trace of the fight remained but
                the charred trees and the arrows of <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> lying on the hill-top. All were
                undamaged save <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of which only the point was left.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`I</name>t is as I feared,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. `These were no ordinary wolves hunting for food
                    in the wilderness. Let us eat quickly and go!'</q></p>
            <p><name type="DATE">That <name type="DATE">day</name></name> the weather changed again, almost as if it was at the command of some power
                that had no longer any use for snow, since they had retreated from the pass, a power
                that wished now to have a clear light in which things that moved in the wild could
                be seen from far away. The wind had been turning through north to north-west du<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng
                the <name type="TIME">night</name>, and now it failed. The clouds vanished southwards and the sky was opened,
                high and blue. As they stood upon the hill-side, ready to depart, a pale sunlight
                gleamed over the mountain-tops.</p>
            <p>`We must reach the doors before sunset,' said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, 'or I fear we shall not reach
                them at all. It is not far, but our path may be winding, for here <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> cannot
                guide us; he has seldom walked in this country, and only once have I been under the
                west wall of <name type="GPE">Mo<name type="GPE">ri</name>a</name>, and that was <name type="DATE">long ago</name>.</p>
            <p>`There it lies,' he said, pointing away south-eastwards to where the mountains' sides
                fell sheer into the shadows at their feet. In the distance could be dimly seen a
                line of bare cliffs, and in their midst, taller than the rest, <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> great grey wall.
                `When we left the pass I led you southwards, and not back to our starting point, as
                some of you may have noticed. It is well that I did so, for now we have several
                miles less to cross, and haste is needed. Let us go! '</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`I</name> do not know which to hope,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> g<name type="GPE">ri</name>mly: `that <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> will find what
                    he seeks, or that coming to the cliff we shall find the gates lost for ever. All
                    choices seem ill, and to be caught between wolves and the wall the likeliest
                    chance. Lead on!'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> now walked ahead by the wizard's side, so eager was he to come to <name type="GPE">Mo<name type="GPE">ri</name>a</name>.
                Together they led the <name type="ORG">Company</name> back towards the mountains. The only road of old to
                <name type="GPE">Mo<name type="GPE">ri</name>a</name> from the west had lain along the course of a stream, the <name type="PRODUCT">Sirannon</name>, that ran
                out from the feet of the cliffs near where the doors had stood. But either <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>
                was astray, or else the land had changed in <name type="DATE">recent <name type="DATE">year</name>s</name>; for he did not st<name type="GPE">ri</name>ke the
                stream where he looked to find it, only <name type="QUANTITY">a few miles</name> southwards from their start.</p>
            <p><name type="TIME">The <name type="TIME">morning</name></name> was passing towards <name type="TIME">noon</name>, and still the <name type="ORG">Company</name> <name type="PERSON">wan</name>dered and scrambled in
                a barren country of red st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s. Nowhere could they see any gleam of water or hear
                any sound of it. All was bleak and dry. Their hearts sank. They saw no living thing,
                and not a bird was in the sky; but what the <name type="TIME">night</name> would b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng, if it caught them in
                that lost land, n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of them cared to think.</p>
            <p>Suddenly <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>, who had pressed on ahead, called back to them. He was standing on a
                knoll and pointing to the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght. Hurrying up they saw below them a deep and narrow
                channel. It was empty and silent, and hardly a t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ckle of water flowed among the
                brown and red-stained st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s of its bed; but on the near side there was a path, much
                broken and decayed, that wound its way among the ruined walls and paving-st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s of
                an ancient highroad.</p>
            <p>
                <q>'Ah! Here it is at last! ' said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. `This is where the stream ran: <name type="PRODUCT">Sirannon</name>,
                    the <name type="FAC">Gate</name>-stream, they used to call it. But what has happened to the water, I
                    cannot guess; it used to be swift and noisy. Come! We must hurry on. We are
                    late.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>The <name type="ORG">Company</name> were footsore and tired; but they trudged doggedly along the rough and
                winding track for many miles. The sun turned from the <name type="TIME">noon</name> and began to go west.
                After a b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ef halt and a hasty meal they went on again. Before them the mountains
                frowned, but their path lay in a deep trough of land and they could see only the
                higher shoulders and the far eastward peaks.</p>
            <p>At length they came to a sharp bend. There the road, which had been vee<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng
                southwards between the b<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk of the channel and a steep fall of the land to the
                left, turned and went due east again. Rounding the corner they saw before them a low
                cliff, some <name type="CARDINAL">five</name> fathoms high, with a broken and jagged top. Over it a t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ckling
                water d<name type="GPE">ri</name>pped, through a wide cleft that seemed to have been carved out by a fall
                that had once been strong and full.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`I</name>ndeed things have changed! ' said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. `But there is no mistaking the place.
                There is all that remains of <name type="FAC">the Stair Falls</name>. If I remember <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght, there was a
                flight of steps cut in the rock at their side, but the main road wound away left and
                climbed with several loops <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name> the level ground at the top. There used to be a
                shallow valley beyond <name type="DATE">the fall</name>s <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name> the Walls of <name type="GPE">Mo<name type="GPE">ri</name>a</name>, and the <name type="PRODUCT">Sirannon</name>
                flowed through it with the road beside it. Let us go and see what things are like
                now! '</p>
            <p>They found the st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> steps without difficulty, and <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> sprang swiftly up them,
                followed by <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> and <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. When they reached the top they saw that they could go
                no further that way, and the reason for the drying up of the <name type="FAC">Gate</name>-stream was
                revealed. Behind them the sinking <name type="ORG">Sun</name> filled the cool western sky with glimme<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng
                gold. Before them stretched a dark still lake. Neither sky nor sunset was reflected
                on its sullen surface. The <name type="PRODUCT">Sirannon</name> had been dammed and had filled all the valley.
                Beyond the ominous water were reared vast cliffs, their stern faces pallid in the
                fading light: final and impassable. No sign of gate or entrance, not a fissure or
                crack could <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> see in the frowning st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>.</p>
            <p>`There are the Walls of <name type="GPE">Mo<name type="GPE">ri</name>a</name>,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, pointing across the water. <name type="PERSON">`A</name>nd
                    there the <name type="FAC">Gate</name> stood once upon a time, the <name type="ORG">Elven</name> <name type="ORG">Door</name> at the end of the road
                    from <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>llin by which we have come. But this way is blocked. N<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the <name type="ORG">Company</name>,
                    I guess, will wish to swim this gloomy water at the end of the <name type="DATE">day</name>. It has an
                    unwholesome look.'</q></p>
            <p>`We must find a way round the northern edge,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. `The <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> thing for the
                    <name type="ORG">Company</name> to do is to climb up by the main path and see where that will lead us.
                    Even if there were no lake, we could not get our baggage-pony up this
                    stair.'</q></p>
            <p>`But in any case we cannot take the poor beast into the <name type="ORG">Mines</name>,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. `The
                    road under the mountains is a dark road, and there are places narrow and steep
                    which he cannot tread, even if we can.'</q></p>
            <p>`Poor old <name type="PERSON">Bill</name>! ' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> had not thought of that. And poor <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>! I wonder what
                he will say? '</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`I</name> am sorry,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. `Poor <name type="PERSON">Bill</name> has been a useful companion and it goes to
                    my heart to turn him ad<name type="GPE">ri</name>ft now. I would have travelled lighter and brought no
                    animal, least of all this <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> that <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> is fond of, if I had had my way. I feared
                    all along that we should be obliged to take this road.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="DATE">The <name type="DATE">day</name></name> was drawing to its end, and cold stars were glinting in the sky high above
                the sunset, when the <name type="ORG">Company</name>, with all the speed they could, climbed up the slopes
                and reached the side of the lake. In breadth it looked to be no <name type="CARDINAL">more than <name type="CARDINAL">two</name></name> or
                <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> furlongs at the widest point. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w far it stretched away southward they could
                not see in the failing light; but its northern end was no more than <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> <name type="QUANTITY">a mile</name> from
                where they stood, and between the stony <name type="GPE">ri</name>dges that enclosed the valley and the
                water's edge there was a <name type="GPE">ri</name>m of open ground. They hur<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed forward, for they had
                still <name type="QUANTITY">a mile</name> or <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> to go before they could reach the point on the far shore that
                <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> was making for; and then he had still to find the doors.</p>
            <p>When they came to the northernmost corner of the lake they found a narrow c<name type="GPE">reek</name> that
                barred their way. It was green and stagnant, thrust out like a slimy arm towards the
                enclosing hills. <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> strode forward undeterred, and found that the water was
                shallow, no more than ankle-deep at the edge. Behind him they walked in file,
                threading their way with care, for under the weedy pools were sliding and greasy
                st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s, and footing was treacherous. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> shuddered with disgust at the touch of
                the dark unclean water on his feet.</p>
            <p>As <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, the last of the <name type="ORG">Company</name>, led <name type="PERSON">Bill</name> up on to the dry ground on the far side,
                there came a soft sound: a swish, followed by a plop, as if a fish had disturbed the
                still surface of the water. Turning quickly they saw <name type="GPE">ri</name>pples, black-edged with
                shadow in the <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ing light: great <name type="GPE">ri</name>ngs were widening outwards from a point far out
                in the lake. There was a bubbling noise, and then silence. <name type="TIME">The <name type="TIME">dusk</name></name> deepened, and
                the last gleams of the sunset were veiled in cloud.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> now pressed on at a great pace, and the others followed as quickly as they
                could. They reached the st<name type="GPE">ri</name>p of dry land between the lake and the cliffs: it was
                narrow, of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> hardly <name type="CARDINAL">a <name type="CARDINAL">dozen</name></name> yards across, and encumbered with fallen rock and
                st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s; but they found a way, hugging the cliff, and keeping as far from the dark
                water as they might. <name type="QUANTITY">A mile</name> southwards along the shore they came upon holly trees.
                Stumps and dead boughs were rotting in the shallows, the remains it seemed of old
                thickets, or of a hedge that had once lined the road across the drowned valley. But
                close under the cliff there stood, still strong and living, . <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> tall trees, larger
                than any trees of holly that <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> had ever seen or imagined. Their great roots
                spread from the wall to the water. Under the looming cliffs they had looked like
                mere <name type="PERSON">bush</name>es, when seen far off from the top of the Stair; but now they towered
                overhead, stiff, dark, and silent, throwing <name type="TIME">deep <name type="TIME">night</name></name>-shadows about their feet,
                standing like sentinel pillars at the end of the road.</p>
            <p><name type="ORG">`Well</name>, here we are at last! <q>' said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. 'Here the <name type="ORG">Elven</name>-way from <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>llin ended.

                    the end of their domain; for the <name type="LOC">West</name>-door was made chiefly for their use in

            <p>'But you can't leave poor old <name type="PERSON">Bill</name> behind in this forsaken place, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>! '
                c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, angry and distressed. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> won't have it, and that's flat. After he has
                come so far and all! '</p>
            <p><q>'I am sorry, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>,'</q> said the wizard. `But when the <name type="ORG">Door</name> opens I do not think
                you will be able to drag your <name type="PERSON">Bill</name> inside, into the long dark of <name type="GPE">Mo<name type="GPE">ri</name>a</name>. You will
                have to choose between <name type="PERSON">Bill</name> and your master.'</p>
            <p><q>'He'd follow Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> into a dragon's den, if I led him,'</q> protested <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>.
                <name type="PERSON">`I</name>t'd be nothing short of murder to turn him loose with all these wolves about.'</p>
            <p><q>'It will be short of murder, I hope,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. He laid his hand on the
                pony's head, and spoke in a low voice. <name type="ORG">`Go</name> with words of guard and guiding on you,'
                he said. `You are a wise beast, and have learned much in <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name>. Make your ways
                to places where you can find grass, and so come in time to <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name>'s house, or
                wherever you wish to go.</p>
            <p>`There, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>! He will have quite as much chance of escaping wolves and getting home as
                we have.'</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> stood sullenly by the pony and returned no answer. <name type="PERSON">Bill</name>, seeming to understand
                well what was going on, nuzzled <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name> him, putting his nose to <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>'s ear. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> burst
                into tears, and fumbled with the straps, unlading all the pony's packs and throwing
                them on the ground. The others sorted out the goods, making a pile of all that could
                be left behind, and dividing up the rest.</p>
            <p>When this was <name type="PERSON">don</name>e they turned to watch <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. He appeared to have <name type="PERSON">don</name>e nothing. He
                was standing between the <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> trees gazing at the blank wall of the cliff, as if he
                would bore a hole into it with his eyes. <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> was <name type="PERSON">wan</name>de<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng about, tapping the
                st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> here and there with his axe. <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> was pressed against the rock, as if
                lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing.</p>
            <p><q>'Well, here we are and all ready,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>; `but where are the <name type="ORG">Door</name>s? I
                can't see any sign of them.'</p>
            <p><q>'<name type="WORK_OF_ART">Dwarf</name>-doors are not made to be seen when shut,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. `They are
                invisible, and their own masters cannot find them or open them, if their <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret is
                forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>.'</p>
            <p><q>'But this <name type="ORG">Door</name> was not made to be a <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret known only to <name type="ORG">Dwarves</name>,'</q> said
                <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, coming suddenly to life and turning round. `Unless things are altogether
                changed, eyes that know what to look for may discover the signs.'</p>
            <p>He walked forward to the wall. Right between the shadow of the trees there was a
                smooth space, and over this he passed his hands to and fro, mutte<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng words under
                his breath. Then he stepped back.</p>
            <p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok!'</q> he said. `Can you see anything now?'</p>
            <p>The <name type="PERSON">Moon</name> now sh<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> upon the grey face of the rock; but they could see nothing else
                for a while. Then slowly on the surface, where the wizard's hands had passed, faint
                lines appeared, like slender veins of silver running in the st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. At <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> they
                were no more than pale gossamer-threads, so fine that they only twinkled fitfully
                where the <name type="PERSON">Moon</name> caught them, but steadily they grew broader and clearer, until their
                design could be guessed.</p>
            <p>At the top, as high as <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> could reach, was an arch of interlacing letters in an
                <name type="PERSON">Elvish</name> character. Below, though the threads were in places blurred or broken, the
                outline could be seen of an anvil and a hammer surmounted by a crown with <name type="CARDINAL">seven</name>
                stars. Beneath these again were <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> trees, each bea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng crescent moons. More clearly
                than all else there sh<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> forth in the middle of the door a single star with many
                rays.</p>
            <p>`There are the emblems of Du<name type="GPE">ri</name>n!' c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`A</name>nd there is the <name type="PERSON">Tree</name> of the High <name type="ORG">Elves</name>!' said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`A</name>nd the Star of the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>use of F�anor,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. `They are wrought of
                    _ithildin_ that mirrors only starlight and moonlight, and sleeps until it is
                    touched by <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> who speaks words now long forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> in <name type="LOC">Middle-<name type="LOC">earth</name></name>. It is long
                    since I heard them, and I thought deeply before I could recall them to my
                    mind.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'What does the w<name type="GPE">ri</name>ting say?'</q> asked <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, who was trying to decipher the
                insc<name type="GPE">ri</name>ption on the arch. <q>'I thought I knew the elf-letters but I cannot read
                    these.'</q></p>
            <p>`The words are in the <name type="ORG">elven</name>-tongue of the <name type="LOC">West</name> of <name type="LOC">Middle-<name type="LOC">earth</name></name> in the <name type="DATE">Elder Days</name>,'
                answered <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. 'But they do not say anything of imp<name type="GPE">ortan</name>ce to us. They say only:
                _The <name type="ORG">Door</name>s of Du<name type="GPE">ri</name>n, <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd of <name type="GPE">Mo<name type="GPE">ri</name>a</name>. Speak, f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end, and enter_. And underneath small
                and faint is w<name type="GPE">ri</name>t<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>: _I, <name type="PERSON">Narvi</name>, made them. <name type="ORG">Celeb<name type="GPE">ri</name>mbor</name> of <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>llin drew these
                signs._'</p>
            <p>`What does it mean by _speak, f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end, and enter_?' asked <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>.</p>
            <p><q>'That is plain enough,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>f you are a f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end, speak the password,
                and the doors will open, and you can enter.'</p>
            <p><q>'Yes,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, 'these doors are probably governed by words. Some
                dwarf-gates will open only at special times, or for particular persons; and some
                have locks and keys that are still needed when all necessary times and words are
                known. These doors have no key. In the <name type="DATE">day</name>s of Du<name type="GPE">ri</name>n they were not <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret. They
                usually stood open and <name type="PERSON">doorwards</name> sat here. But if they were shut, any who knew the
                opening word could speak it and pass in. At least so it is recorded, is it not,
                <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>? '</p>
            <p><q>'It is,'</q> said the dwarf. `But what the word was is not remembered. <name type="PERSON">Narvi</name> and
                his craft and all his kindred have vanished from the <name type="LOC">earth</name>.'</p>
            <p>'But do not _you_ know the word, <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>? ' asked <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> in surp<name type="GPE">ri</name>se.</p>
            <p>`No! ' said the wizard.</p>
            <p>The others looked dismayed; only <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>, who knew <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> well, remained silent and
                unmoved.</p>
            <p><q>'Then what was the use of b<name type="GPE">ri</name>nging us to this accursed spot?'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>,
                glancing back with a shudder at the dark water. `You told us that you had once
                passed through the <name type="ORG">Mines</name>. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w could that be, if you did not know how to enter? '</p>
            <p>`The answer to your <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> question, <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>,<q>' said the wizard, `is that I do not
                    know the word-yet. But we shall soon see. And,'</q> he added, with a glint in
                his eyes under their b<name type="GPE">ri</name>stling brows, 'you may ask what is the use of my deeds when
                they are proved useless. As for your other question: do you doubt my tale? Or have
                you no wits left? I did not enter this way. I came from the <name type="LOC">East</name>.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`I</name>f you wish to know, I will tell you that these doors open outwards. From the inside
                you may thrust them open with your hands. From the outside nothing will move them
                save the spell of command. They cannot be forced inwards.'</p>
            <p>`What are you going to do then? ' asked <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>, undaunted by the wizard's b<name type="GPE">ri</name>stling
                brows.</p>
            <p>`Knock on the doors with your head, <name type="PERSON">Pereg<name type="GPE">ri</name>n</name> <name type="PERSON">Took</name>,' said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. `But if that does
                not shatter them, and I am allowed a little peace from foolish questions, I will
                seek for the opening words.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`I</name> once knew every spell in all the tongues of <name type="ORG">Elves</name> or <name type="ORG">Men</name> or <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s that was ever
                used for such a purpose. I can still remember <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> score of them without sear<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g in
                my mind. But only a few t<name type="GPE">ri</name>als, I think, will be needed; and I shall not have to
                call on <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> for words of the <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret dwarf-tongue that they teach to n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. The
                opening words were <name type="PERSON">Elvish</name>, like the w<name type="GPE">ri</name>ting on the arch: that seems certain.'</p>
            <p>He stepped <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name> the rock again, and lightly touched with his staff the silver star
                in the middle beneath the sign of the anvil.</p>
            <p><name type="PRODUCT">Annon edhellen</name>, edro hi ammen!</p>
            <p>Fennas nogoth<name type="GPE">ri</name>m, lasto beth lammen!</p>
            <p>he said in a commanding voice. The silver lines faded, but the blank <name type="ORG">grey st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name></name> did
                not stir.</p>
            <p>Many times he repeated these words in different order, or va<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed them. Then he t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed
                other spells. <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> after another, speaking now faster and louder, now soft and slow.
                Then he spoke many single words of <name type="PERSON">Elvish</name> speech. Nothing happened. The cliff
                towered into the <name type="TIME">night</name>, the countless stars were kindled, the wind blew cold, and
                the doors stood fast.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Again <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name></name> approached the wall, and lifting up his arms he spoke in t<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s of
                command and <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing wrath. _<name type="PERSON">Edro</name>, edro!_ he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed, and struck the rock with his
                staff. _Open, open!_ he shouted, and followed it with the same command in every
                language that had ever been spoken in the <name type="LOC">West</name> of <name type="LOC">Middle-<name type="LOC">earth</name></name>. Then he threw his
                staff on the ground, and sat down in silence.</p>
            <p>At that moment from far off the wind bore to their lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing ears the howling of
                wolves. <name type="PERSON">Bill</name> the pony started in fear, and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> sprang to his side and whispered
                softly to him.</p>
            <p>'Do not let him run away! ' said <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>. 'It seems that we shall need him still, if
                the wolves do not find us. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w I hate this foul pool! ' He stooped and picking up a
                large st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> he cast it far into the dark water.</p>
            <p>The st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> vanished with a soft slap; but at the same instant there was a swish and a
                bubble. Great <name type="GPE">ri</name>ppling <name type="GPE">ri</name>ngs formed on the surface out beyond where the st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> had
                fallen, and they moved slowly towards the foot of the cliff.</p>
            <p>'Why did you do that, <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>? ' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> hate this place, too, and I am
                afraid. I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t know of what: not of wolves, or the dark behind the doors, but of
                something else. I am afraid of the pool. <name type="PERSON">Don</name>'t disturb it! '</p>
            <p>'l wish we could get away! ' said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>.</p>
            <p>'Why doesn't <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> do something quick? ' said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> took no notice of them. He sat with his head bowed, either in despair or in
                anxious thought. The mournful howling of the wolves was heard again. The <name type="GPE">ri</name>pples on
                the water grew and came closer; some were already lapping on the shore.</p>
            <p>With a suddenness that startled them all the wizard sprang to his feet. He was
                laughing! <name type="PERSON">`I</name> have it! <q>' he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed. 'Of course, of course! Absurdly simple, like
                    most <name type="GPE">ri</name>ddles when you see the answer.'</q></p>
            <p>Picking up his staff he stood before the rock and said in a clear voice:
                _Mellon!_</p>
            <p>The star sh<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> out b<name type="GPE">ri</name>efly and faded again. Then silently a great doorway was
                outlined, though not a crack or joint had been visible before. Slowly it divided in
                the middle and swung outwards inch by inch, until both doors lay back against the
                wall. <name type="PERSON">Thr</name>ough the opening a shadowy stair could be seen climbing steeply up; but
                beyond the lower steps the darkness was deeper than the <name type="TIME">night</name>. The <name type="ORG">Company</name> stared in
                wonder.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`I</name> was wrong after all,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, 'and <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> too. <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>, of all people, was
                    on the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght track. The opening word was insc<name type="GPE">ri</name>bed on the archway all the time!
                    The translation should have been: _Say "F<name type="GPE">ri</name>end" and enter._ I had only to speak
                    the <name type="PERSON">Elvish</name> word for _f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end_ and the doors opened. Quite simple. Too simple for
                    a learned lore-master in these suspicious <name type="DATE">day</name>s. Those were happier times. Now
                    let us go!'</q></p>
            <p>He strode forward and set his foot on the lowest step. But at that moment several
                things happened. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> felt something seize him by the ankle, and he fell with a
                cry. <name type="PERSON">Bill</name> the pony gave a wild neigh of fear, and turned tail and dashed away along
                the lakeside into the darkness. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> leaped after him, and then hea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s cry
                he ran back again, weeping and cursing. The others swung round and saw the waters of
                the lake seething, as if a host of snakes were swimming up from the southern
                end.</p>
            <p>Out from the water a long sinuous <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>tacle had crawled; it was pale-green and
                luminous and wet. Its fingered end had hold of <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s foot and was dragging him
                into the water. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> on his knees was now slashing at it with a knife.</p>
            <p>The arm let go of <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> pulled him away, crying out for help. <name type="CARDINAL">Twenty</name> others
                arms came <name type="GPE">ri</name>ppling out. The dark water boiled, and there was a hideous s<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ch.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`I</name>nto the gateway! Up the stairs! Quick! ' shouted <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> leaping back. Rousing them
                from the horror that seemed to have rooted all but <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> to the ground where they
                stood, he drove them forward.</p>
            <p>They were just in time. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> and <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> were only a few steps up, and <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> had just
                begun to climb, when the groping <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>tacles w<name type="GPE">ri</name>thed across the narrow shore and
                fingered the cliff-wall and the doors. <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> came w<name type="GPE">ri</name>ggling over the threshold,
                glis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing in the starlight. <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> turned and paused. If he was conside<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng what
                word would close the gate again from within, there was no need. Many coiling arms
                seized the doors on either side, and with hor<name type="GPE">ri</name>ble strength, swung them round. With
                a shatte<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng echo they slammed, and all light was lost. A noise of rending and
                crashing came dully through the ponderous st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, clinging to <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s arm, collapsed on a step in the black darkness. `Poor old
                <name type="PERSON">Bill</name>! <q>' he said in a choking voice. `Poor old <name type="PERSON">Bill</name>! Wolves and snakes! But the
                    snakes were too much for him. I had to choose, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. I had to come with
                    you.'</q></p>
            <p>They heard <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> go back down the steps and thrust his staff against the doors.
                There was a quiver in the st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> and the stairs trembled, .but the doors did not
                open. <name type="ORG">`Well</name>, well! <q>' said the wizard. `The passage is blocked behind us now and
                    there is only <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> way out�on the other side of the mountains. I fear from the
                    sounds that boulders have been piled up, and the trees uprooted and thrown
                    across the gate. I am sorry; for the trees were beautiful, and had stood so
                    long.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`I</name> felt that something hor<name type="GPE">ri</name>ble was near from the moment that my foot <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> touched
                the water,' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. 'What was the thing, or were there many of them? '</p>
            <p><q>'I do not know,'</q> answered <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, <q>'but the arms were all guided by <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>
                    purpose. Something has crept, or has been d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ven out of dark waters under the
                    mountains. There are older and fouler things than <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s in the deep places of the
                    world.'</q> He did not speak aloud his thought that whatever it was that dwelt
                in the lake, it had seized on <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> among all the <name type="ORG">Company</name>.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> muttered under his breath, but the echoing st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> magnified the sound to a
                hoarse whisper that all could hear: <name type="PERSON">`I</name>n the deep places of the world! And thither we
                are going against my wish. Who will lead us now in this deadly dark? '</p>
            <p><q>'I will,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, 'and <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> shall walk with me. Follow my staff! '</p>
            <p>As the wizard passed on ahead up the great steps, he held his staff aloft, and from
                its tip there came a faint radiance. The wide stairway was sound and undamaged. <name type="CARDINAL">Two</name>
                <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name> steps they counted, broad and shallow; and at the top they found an arched
                passage with a level floor leading on into the dark.</p>
            <p>`Let us sit and rest and have something to eat, here on the landing, since we can't
                find a dining-room! ' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. He had begun to shake off the terror of the
                clut<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g arm, and suddenly he felt extremely hungry.</p>
            <p>The proposal was welcomed by all; and they sat down on the upper steps, dim figures
                in the gloom. After they had ea<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>, <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> gave them each <name type="CARDINAL">a <name type="ORDINAL">third</name></name> sip of the
                <name type="PERSON">miruvor</name> of <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name>.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`I</name>t will not last much longer, I am afraid,<q>' he said; 'but I think we need it
                    after that horror at the gate. And unless we have great luck, we shall need all
                    that is left before we see the other side! Go carefully with the water, too!
                    There are many streams and wells in the <name type="ORG">Mines</name>, but they should not be touched.
                    We may not have a chance of filling our skins and bottles till we come down into
                    <name type="GPE">Dim<name type="GPE">ri</name>ll</name> <name type="ORG">Dale</name>.'</q></p>
            <p>'<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w long is that going to take us? ' asked <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.</p>
            <p><q>'I cannot say,'</q> answered <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <q>'It depends on many chances. But going
                    straight, without mishap or losing our way, we shall take <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> or <name type="CARDINAL">four</name> <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ches,
                    I expect. It cannot be less than <name type="CARDINAL">forty</name> miles from <name type="LOC">West</name>-door to <name type="LOC">East</name>-gate in a
                    direct line, and the road may wind much.'</q></p>
            <p>After only a b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ef rest they started on their way again. All were eager to get the
                journey over as quickly as possible, and were willing, tired as they were, to go on
                <name type="PERSON">mar</name><name type="PERSON">chin</name>g still for several <name type="TIME">hour</name>s. <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> walked in front as before. In his left
                hand he held up his glimme<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng staff, the light of which just showed the ground
                before his feet; in his <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght he held his sword <name type="PERSON">Glamd<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng</name>. Behind him came <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>,
                his eyes glinting in the dim light as he turned his head from side to side. Behind
                the dwarf walked <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, and he had drawn the short sword, <name type="PERSON">Sting</name>. No gleam came from
                the blades of <name type="PERSON">Sting</name> or of <name type="PERSON">Glamd<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng</name>; and that was some comfort, for being the work
                of <name type="PERSON">Elvish</name> smiths in the <name type="DATE">Elder Days</name> these swords sh<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> with a cold light, if any <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s
                were near at hand. Behind <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> went <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, and after him <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>, and the young
                hobbits, and <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>. In the dark at the rear, g<name type="GPE">ri</name>m and silent, walked <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>.</p>
            <p>The passage twisted round a few turns, and then began to descend. It went steadily
                down for a long while before it became level once again. The air grew hot and
                stifling, but it was not foul, and at times they felt currents of cooler air upon
                their faces, issuing from <name type="CARDINAL">half</name>-guessed openings in the walls. There were many of
                these. In the pale ray of the wizard's staff, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> caught glimpses of stairs and
                arches and of other passages and tunnels, sloping up, or running steeply down, or
                opening blankly dark on either side. It was bewilde<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng beyond hope of
                remembe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> aided <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> very little, except by his stout courage. At least he was not, as
                were most of the others, troubled by the mere darkness in itself. Of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> the wizard
                consulted him at points where the choice of way was doubtful; but it was always
                <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> who had the final word. The <name type="ORG">Mines</name> of <name type="GPE">Mo<name type="GPE">ri</name>a</name> were vast and int<name type="GPE">ri</name>cate beyond
                the imagination of <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>, <name type="PRODUCT">Gl�</name>in's son, dwarf of the mountain-race though he was. To
                <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> the far-off memo<name type="GPE">ri</name>es of a journey long before were now of little help, but
                even in the gloom and despite all windings of the road he knew whither he wished to
                go, and he did not falter, as long as there was a path that led towards his
                goal.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`Do</name> not be afraid! <q>' said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. There was a pause longer than usual, and
                    <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> and <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> were whispe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng together; the others were crowded behind,
                    waiting anxiously. <name type="PERSON">`Do</name> not be afraid! I have been with him on many a journey, if
                    never on <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> so dark; and there are tales of <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name> of greater deeds of his
                    than any that I have seen. He will not go astray-if there is any path to find.
                    He has led us in here against our fears, but he will lead us out again, at
                    whatever cost to himself. He is surer of finding the way home in <name type="TIME">a blind <name type="TIME">night</name></name>
                    than the cats of Queen Ber�thiel.'</q></p>
            <p>It was well for the <name type="ORG">Company</name> that they had such a guide. They had no fuel nor any
                means of making torches; in the desperate scramble at the doors many things had been
                left behind. But without any light they would soon have come to g<name type="GPE">ri</name>ef. There were
                not only many roads to choose from, there were also in many places holes and
                pitfalls, and dark wells beside the path in which their passing feet echoed. There
                were fissures and chasms in the walls and floor, and every now and then a crack
                would open <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght before their feet. The widest was <name type="QUANTITY">more than <name type="CARDINAL">seven</name> feet</name> across, and
                it was long before <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> could summon enough courage to leap over the dreadful gap.
                The noise of churning water came up from far below, as if some great mill-wheel was
                turning in the depths.</p>
            <p><name type="TIME">`Rope</name>! ' muttered <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> knew I'd <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t it, if I hadn't got it! '</p>
            <p>As these dangers became more frequent their <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ch became slower. Already they seemed
                to have been tramping on, on, endlessly to the mountains' roots. They were more than
                weary, and yet there seemed no comfort in the thought of halting anywhere. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s
                spi<name type="GPE">ri</name>ts had <name type="GPE">ri</name>sen for a while after his escape, and after food and a draught of the
                cordial; but now a deep uneasiness, growing to dread, crept over him again. Though
                he had been healed in <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name> of the knife-stroke, that g<name type="GPE">ri</name>m wound had not been
                without effect. His senses were sharper and more aware of things that could not be
                seen. <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> sign of change that he soon had noticed was that he could see more in the
                dark than any of his companions, save perhaps <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. And he was in any case the
                bearer of the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>: it hung upon its c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>n against his breast, and at whiles it
                seemed a heavy w<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name>. He felt the certainty of evil ahead and of evil following;
                but he said nothing. He g<name type="GPE">ri</name>pped tighter on the hilt of his sword and went on
                doggedly.</p>
            <p>The <name type="ORG">Company</name> behind him spoke seldom, and then only in hur<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed whispers. There was no
                sound but the sound of their own feet; the dull stump of <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>'s dwarf-boots; the
                heavy tread of <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>; the light step of <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>; the soft, scarce<name type="PERSON">-he</name>ard patter of
                hobbit-feet; and in the rear the slow firm footfalls of <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> with his long
                st<name type="GPE">ri</name>de. When they halted for a moment they heard nothing at all, unless it were
                occasionally a faint t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ckle and d<name type="GPE">ri</name>p of unseen water. Yet <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> began to hear, or
                to imagine that he heard, something else: like the faint fall of soft bare feet. It
                was never loud enough, or near enough, for him to feel certain that he heard it; but
                once it had started it never stopped, while the <name type="ORG">Company</name> was moving. But it was not
                an echo, for when they halted it pattered on for a little all by itself, and then
                grew still.</p>
            <p>It was after <name type="TIME">night</name>fall when they had entered the <name type="ORG">Mines</name>. They had been going for
                several <name type="TIME">hour</name>s with only b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ef halts, when <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> came to his <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> se<name type="GPE">ri</name>ous check.
                Before him stood a wide dark arch opening into <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> passages: all led in the same
                general direction, eastwards; but the left-hand passage plunged down, while the
                <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght-hand climbed up, and the middle way seemed to run on, smooth and level but
                very narrow.</p>
            <p><q>'I have no memory of this place at all! ' said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, standing uncertainly under
                    the arch. He held up his staff in the hope of finding some <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ks or insc<name type="GPE">ri</name>ption
                    that might help his choice; but nothing of the kind was to be seen. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> am too
                    weary to decide,'</q> he said, shaking his head. <name type="PERSON">`A</name>nd I expect that you are all
                as weary as I am, or wea<name type="GPE">ri</name>er. We had better halt here for what is left of the <name type="TIME">night</name>.
                You know what I mean! In here it is ever dark; but outside the late <name type="PERSON">Moon</name> is <name type="GPE">ri</name>ding
                westward and the middle-<name type="TIME">night</name> has passed.'</p>
            <p>`Poor old <name type="PERSON">Bill</name>! <q>' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. 'I wonder where he is. I hope those wolves haven't got
                    him yet.'</q></p>
            <p>To the left of the great arch they found a st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> door: it was <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> closed, but swung
                back easily to a gentle thrust. Beyond there seemed to lie a wide chamber cut in the
                rock.</p>
            <p>`<name type="PERSON">Steady</name>! <name type="PERSON">Steady</name>! <q>' c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> as <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> pushed forward, glad to find
                    a place where they could rest with at least more feeling of shelter than in the
                    open passage. `<name type="PERSON">Steady</name>! You do not know what is inside yet. I will go
                <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>.'</q></p>
            <p>He went in cautiously, and the others filed behind. `There! ' he said, pointing with
                his staff to the middle of the floor. Before his feet they saw a large round hole
                like the mouth of a well. Broken and rusty c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>ns lay at the edge and trailed down
                into the black pit. Fragments of st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> lay near.</p>
            <p><q>'<name type="CARDINAL">One</name> of you might have fallen in and still be wonde<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng when you were going to
                    st<name type="GPE">ri</name>ke the bot<name type="PERSON">tom</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> to <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. <q>'Let the guide go <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> while
                    you have <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'This seems to have been a guardroom, made for the wat<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g of the <name type="CARDINAL">three</name>
                    passages,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. `That hole was plainly a well for the guards' use,
                covered with a st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> lid. But the lid is broken, and we must all take care in the
                dark.'</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> felt cu<name type="GPE">ri</name>ously attracted by the well. While the others were unrolling blankets
                and making beds against the walls of the chamber, as far as possible from the hole
                in the floor, he crept to the edge and peered over. A chill air seemed to st<name type="GPE">ri</name>ke his
                face, <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing from invisible depths. Moved by a sudden impulse he groped for a loose
                st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, and let it drop. He felt his heart beat many times before there was any
                sound. Then far below, as if the st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> had fallen into deep water in some cavernous
                place, there came a _plunk_, very distant, but magnified and repeated in the hollow
                shaft.</p>
            <p>`What's that? ' c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. He was relieved when <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> confessed what he had
                <name type="PERSON">don</name>e; but he was angry, and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> could see his eye glinting. '<name type="ORG">Fool of a <name type="PERSON">Took</name></name>! ' he
                growled. 'This is a se<name type="GPE">ri</name>ous journey, not a hobbit walking-party. <name type="PERSON">Thr</name>ow yourself in
                next time, and then you will be no further nuisance. Now be quiet! '</p>
            <p>Nothing more was heard for several <name type="TIME">minutes</name>; but then there came out of the depths
                faint knocks: _<name type="PERSON">tom</name>-tap, tap-<name type="PERSON">tom</name>_. They stopped, and when the echoes had died away,
                they were repeated: _tap-<name type="PERSON">tom</name>, <name type="PERSON">tom</name>-tap, tap-tap, <name type="PERSON">tom</name>_. They sounded disquietingly
                like signals of some sort; but after a while the knocking died away and was not
                heard again.</p>
            <p><q>'That was the sound of a hammer, or I have never heard <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>.</p>
            <p>`Yes,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, 'and I do not like it. It may have nothing to do with
                    <name type="PERSON">Pereg<name type="GPE">ri</name>n</name>'s foolish st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>; but probably something has been disturbed that would
                    have been better left quiet. Pray, do nothing of the kind again! Let us hope we
                    shall get some rest without further trouble. You, <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>, can go on the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>
                    watch, as a reward,'</q> he growled, as he rolled himself in a blanket.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> sat miserably by the door in the pitch dark; but he kept on turning round,
                fea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng that some unknown thing would crawl up out of the well. He wished he could
                cover the hole, if only with a blanket, but he dared not move or go near it, even
                though <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> seemed to be asleep.</p>
            <p>Actually <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> was awake, though lying still and silent. He was deep in thought,
                trying to recall every memory of his former journey in the <name type="ORG">Mines</name>, and conside<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng
                anxiously the next course that he should take; a false turn now might be disastrous.
                After <name type="TIME">an <name type="TIME">hour</name></name> he rose up and came over to <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>.</p>
            <p>`Get into a corner and have a sleep, my lad,<q>' he said in a kindly t<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. 'You <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t
                    to sleep, I expect. I cannot get a wink, so I may as well do the
                wat<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'I know what is the matter with me,'</q> he muttered, as he sat down by the door.
                    <q>'I need smoke! I have not tasted it since the <name type="TIME">morning</name> before the
                    snowstorm.'</q></p>
            <p>The last thing that <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> saw, as sleep took him, was a dark glimpse of the old
                wizard huddled on the floor, shielding a glowing chip in his gnarled hands between
                his knees. The flicker for a moment showed his sharp nose. and the puff of
                smoke.</p>
            <p>It was <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> who roused them all from sleep. He had sat and watched all al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> for
                <name type="TIME">about <name type="CARDINAL">six</name> <name type="TIME">hour</name>s</name>, and had let the others rest. <name type="PERSON">`A</name>nd in the watches I have made up my
                    mind,<q>' he said. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> do not like the feel of the middle way; and I do not like
                    the smell of the left-hand way: there is foul air down there, or I am no guide.
                    I shall take the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght-hand passage. It is time we began to climb up
                again.'</q></p>
            <p>For <name type="CARDINAL">eight</name> dark <name type="TIME">hour</name>s, not counting <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ef halts, they <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ched on; and they met no
                danger, and heard nothing, and saw nothing but the faint gleam of the wizard's
                light, bobbing like a will-o'-the-wisp in front of them. The passage they had chosen
                wound steadily upwards. As far as they could judge it went in great mounting curves,
                and as it rose it grew loftier and wider. There were now no openings to other
                galle<name type="GPE">ri</name>es or tunnels on either side, and the floor was level and sound, without pits
                or cracks. Evidently they had struck what once had been an imp<name type="GPE">ortan</name>t road; and they
                went forward quicker than they had <name type="PERSON">don</name>e on their <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ch.</p>
            <p>In this way they advanced some <name type="CARDINAL">fifteen</name> miles, measured in a direct line east, though
                they must have actually walked <name type="CARDINAL">twenty</name> miles or more. As the road climbed upwards`
                <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s spi<name type="GPE">ri</name>ts rose a little; but he still felt oppressed, and still at times he
                heard, or thought he heard, away behind the <name type="ORG">Company</name> and beyond <name type="DATE">the fall</name> and patter
                of their feet, a following footstep that was not an echo.</p>
            <p>They had <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ched as far as the hobbits could endure without a rest, and all were
                thinking of a place where they could sleep, when suddenly the walls to <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght and
                left vanished. They seemed to have passed through some arched doorway into a black
                and empty space. There was a great draught of warmer air behind them, and before
                them the darkness was cold on their faces. They halted and crowded anxiously
                together.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> seemed pleased. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> chose the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght way,<q>' he said. <name type="PERSON">`A</name>t last we are coming
                    to the habitable parts, and I guess that we are not far now from the eastern
                    side. But we are high up, a good deal higher than the <name type="GPE">Dim<name type="GPE">ri</name>ll</name> <name type="FAC">Gate</name>, unless I am
                    mistaken. From the feeling of the air we must be in a wide hall. I will now <name type="GPE">ri</name>sk
                    a little real light.'</q></p>
            <p>He raised his staff, and for a b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ef instant there was blaze like a flash of
                lightning. Great shadows sprang up and fled, and for a <name type="ORG">sec</name>ond they saw a vast roof
                far above their heads upheld by many mighty pillars hewn of st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. Before them and
                on either side stretched a huge empty hall; its black walls, polished and smooth as
                glass, flashed and glittered. <name type="PERSON">Thr</name>ee other entrances they saw, dark black arches: <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>
                straight before them eastwards, and <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> on either side. Then the light went out.</p>
            <p>`That is all that I shall venture on for the present,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. 'There used
                    to be great windows on the mountain-side, and shafts leading out to the light in
                    the upper reaches of the <name type="ORG">Mines</name>. I think we have reached them now, but it is
                    <name type="TIME">night</name> outside again, and we cannot tell until <name type="TIME">morning</name>. If I am <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght, to<name type="DATE">morrow</name>
                    we may actually see the <name type="TIME">morning</name> peeping in. But in the meanwhile we had better
                    go no further. Let us rest, if we can. Things have g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> well so far, and the
                    greater part of the dark road is over. But we are not through yet, and it is a
                    long way down to the <name type="FAC">Gate</name>s that open on the world.'</q></p>
            <p>The <name type="ORG">Company</name> spent that <name type="TIME">night</name> in the great cavernous hall, huddled close together in a
                corner to escape the draught: there seemed to be a steady inflow of chill air
                through the eastern archway. All about them as they lay hung the darkness, hollow
                and immense, and they were oppressed by the l<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>liness and vastness of the <name type="PERSON">dol</name>ven
                halls and endlessly bran<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g stairs and passages. The wildest imaginings that dark
                rumour had ever suggested to the hobbits fell altogether short of the actual dread
                and wonder of <name type="GPE">Mo<name type="GPE">ri</name>a</name>.</p>
            <p>`There must have been a mighty crowd of dwarves here at <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> time ' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>; `and
                every <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of them busier than badgers for <name type="CARDINAL">five</name> <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name> <name type="DATE">year</name>s to make all this, and
                most in hard rock too! What did they do it all for? They didn't live in these
                darksome holes surely? '</p>
            <p>`These are not holes,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. `This is the great realm and city of the
                    <name type="PRODUCT">Dwarrowdelf</name>. And of old it was not darksome, but full of light and splendour, as
                    is still remembered in our songs.'</q></p>
            <p>He rose and standing in the dark he began to chant in a deep voice, while the echoes
                ran away into the roof.</p>
            <p>The world was young, the mountains green,</p>
            <p>No stain yet on the <name type="PERSON">Moon</name> was seen,</p>
            <p>No words were laid on stream or st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name></p>
            <p>When Du<name type="GPE">ri</name>n woke and walked al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>.</p>

            <p>He drank from yet untasted wells;</p>
            <p>He stooped and looked in <name type="ORG">Mirror</name>mere,</p>
            <p>And saw a crown of stars appear,</p>
            <p>As gems upon a silver thread,</p>
            <p>Above the shadow of his head.</p>
            <p>The world was fair, the mountains tall,</p>
            <p>In <name type="DATE">Elder Days</name> before <name type="DATE">the fall</name></p>
            <p>Of mighty kings in <name type="GPE">Nargothrond</name></p>
            <p>And <name type="PERSON">Gon<name type="PERSON">dol</name>in</name>, who now beyond</p>
            <p>The <name type="LOC">West</name>ern <name type="LOC">Sea</name>s have passed away:</p>

            <p>A king he was on <name type="PERSON">carven</name> thr<name type="CARDINAL">one</name></p>
            <p>In many-pillared halls of st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name></p>
            <p>With golden roof and silver floor,</p>
            <p>And runes of power upon the door.</p>
            <p>The light of sun and star and moon</p>
            <p>In shining lamps of crystal hewn</p>
            <p>Undimmed by cloud or shade of <name type="TIME">night</name></p>
            <p>There sh<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> for ever fair and b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght.</p>
            <p>There hammer on the anvil smote,</p>
            <p>There chisel clove, and graver wrote;</p>
            <p>There forged was blade, and bound was hilt;</p>
            <p>The delver mined, the mason built.</p>
            <p>There beryl, pearl, and opal pale,</p>
            <p>And metal wrought like fishes' mail,</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Buckler</name> and corslet, axe and sword,</p>
            <p>And shining spears were laid in hoard.</p>
            <p><name type="ORG">Unwea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed</name> then were Du<name type="GPE">ri</name>n's folk</p>
            <p>Beneath the mountains music woke:</p>
            <p>The harpers harped, the minstrels sang,</p>
            <p>And at the gates the trumpets rang.</p>
            <p>The world is grey, the mountains old,</p>
            <p>The forge's fire is ashen-cold</p>
            <p>No harp is wrung, no hammer falls:</p>
            <p>The darkness dwells in Du<name type="GPE">ri</name>n's halls</p>
            <p>The shadow lies upon his <name type="PERSON">tom</name>b</p>
            <p>In <name type="GPE">Mo<name type="GPE">ri</name>a</name>, in <name type="GPE">Khaz</name>ad-d�m.</p>
            <p>But still the sunken stars appear</p>
            <p>In dark and windless <name type="ORG">Mirror</name>mere;</p>
            <p>There lies his crown in water deep,</p>
            <p>Till Du<name type="GPE">ri</name>n wakes again from sleep.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`I</name> like that! ' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> should like to learn it. _In <name type="GPE">Mo<name type="GPE">ri</name>a</name>, in <name type="GPE">Khaz</name>ad-d�m!_ But
                it makes the darkness seem heavier, thinking of all those lamps. Are there piles of
                jewels and gold lying about here still? '</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> was silent. Having sung his song he would say no more.</p>
            <p>`Piles of jewels? <q>' said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. `No. The <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s have of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> plundered <name type="GPE">Mo<name type="GPE">ri</name>a</name>; there
                    is nothing left in the upper halls. And since the dwarves fled, no <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> dares to
                    seek the shafts and treasu<name type="GPE">ri</name>es down in the deep places: they are drowned in
                    water�or in a shadow of fear.'</q></p>
            <p>`Then what do the dwarves <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t to come back for? ' asked <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>.</p>
            <p><q>'For _<name type="PERSON">mith<name type="GPE">ri</name>l</name>_,'</q> answered <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. `The wealth of <name type="GPE">Mo<name type="GPE">ri</name>a</name> was not in gold and
                jewels, the toys of the <name type="ORG">Dwarves</name>; nor in iron, their servant. Such things they found
                here, it is true, especially iron; but they did not need to delve for them: all
                things that they desired they could obtain in traffic. For here al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> in the world
                was found <name type="GPE">Mo<name type="GPE">ri</name>a</name>-silver, or true-silver as some have called it: _<name type="PERSON">mith<name type="GPE">ri</name>l</name>_ is the
                <name type="PERSON">Elvish</name> name. The <name type="ORG">Dwarves</name> have a name which they do not tell. Its worth was <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> times
                that of gold, and now it is beyond p<name type="GPE">ri</name>ce; for little is left above ground, and even
                the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s dare not delve here for it. The lodes lead away north towards <name type="GPE">Caradhras</name>,
                and down to darkness. The <name type="ORG">Dwarves</name> tell no tale; but even as _<name type="PERSON">mith<name type="GPE">ri</name>l</name>_ was the
                foundation of their wealth, so also it was their destruction: they delved too
                greedily and too deep, and disturbed that from which they fled, Du<name type="GPE">ri</name>n's Bane. Of
                what they brought to light the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s have gathered nearly all, and given it in
                t<name type="GPE">ri</name>bute to <name type="ORG">Sauron</name>, who covets it.</p>
            <p>`_<name type="PERSON">Mith<name type="GPE">ri</name>l</name>!_ All folk desired it. It could be bea<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> like copper, and polished like
                glass; and the <name type="ORG">Dwarves</name> could make of it a metal, light and yet harder than tempered
                steel. Its beauty was like to that of common silver, but the beauty of _<name type="PERSON">mith<name type="GPE">ri</name>l</name>_ did
                not tarnish or grow dim. The <name type="ORG">Elves</name> dearly loved it, and among many uses they made of
                it _ithildin_, <name type="PERSON">starmoon</name>, which you saw upon the doors. <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> had a corslet of
                <name type="PERSON">mith<name type="GPE">ri</name>l</name>-<name type="GPE">ri</name>ngs that <name type="PERSON">Tho<name type="GPE">ri</name>n</name> gave him. I wonder what has become of it? Gathe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng dust
                still in <name type="PERSON">Michel Delving</name> Mathom-house, I suppose.'</p>
            <p>`What? ' c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>, startled out of his silence. <name type="PERSON">`A</name> corslet of <name type="GPE">Mo<name type="GPE">ri</name>a</name>-silver? That
                was a kingly gift! '</p>
            <p><q>'Yes,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> never told him, but its worth was greater than the
                value of the whole <name type="LOC">Shire</name> and everything in it.'</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> said nothing, but he put his hand under his tunic and touched the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ngs of his
                mail-shirt. He felt staggered to think that he had been walking about with the p<name type="GPE">ri</name>ce
                of the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> under his jacket. Had <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> known? He felt no doubt that <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> knew
                quite well. It was indeed a kingly gift. But now his thoughts had been car<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed away
                from the dark <name type="ORG">Mines</name>, to <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name>, to <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>, and to <name type="FAC">Bag End</name> in the <name type="DATE">day</name>s while <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>
                was still there. He wished with all his heart that he was back there, and in those
                <name type="DATE">day</name>s, mowing the lawn, or potte<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng among the flowers, and that he had never heard
                of <name type="GPE">Mo<name type="GPE">ri</name>a</name>, or _<name type="PERSON">mith<name type="GPE">ri</name>l</name> -_or the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>.</p>
            <p>A deep silence fell. <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> by <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> the others fell asleep. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> was on guard. As if it
                were a breath that came in through unseen doors out of deep places, dread came over
                him. His hands were cold and his brow damp. He lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed. All his mind was given to
                lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing and nothing else for <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> slow <name type="TIME">hour</name>s; but he heard no sound, not even the
                imagined echo of a footfall.</p>
            <p>His watch was nearly over, when, far off where he guessed that the western archway
                stood, he fancied that he could see <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> pale points of light, almost like luminous
                eyes. He started. His head had nodded. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> must have nearly fallen asleep on
                    guard,<q>' he thought. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> was on the edge of a dream.'</q> He stood up and
                rubbed his eyes, and remained standing, pee<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng into the dark, until he was relieved
                by <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>.</p>
            <p>When he lay down he quickly went to sleep, but it seemed to him that the dream went
                on: he heard whispers, and saw the <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> pale points of light approa<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g, slowly. He
                woke and found that the others were speaking softly near him, and that a dim light
                was falling on his face. High up above the eastern archway through a shaft near the
                roof came a long pale gleam; and across the hall through the northern arch light

            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> sat up. <name type="ORG">`Go</name>od <name type="TIME">morning</name>! <q>' said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>: `For <name type="TIME">morning</name> it is again at last. I
                    was <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght, you see. We are high up on the east side of <name type="GPE">Mo<name type="GPE">ri</name>a</name>. Before to<name type="DATE">day</name> is
                    over we ought to find the Great <name type="FAC">Gate</name>s and see the waters of <name type="ORG">Mirror</name>mere lying in
                    the <name type="GPE">Dim<name type="GPE">ri</name>ll</name> <name type="ORG">Dale</name> before us.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'I shall be glad,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> have looked on <name type="GPE">Mo<name type="GPE">ri</name>a</name>, and it is very great,
                but it has become dark and dreadful; and we have found no sign of my kindred. I
                doubt now that <name type="PERSON">Balin</name> ever came here.'</p>
            <p>After they had breakfasted <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> decided to go on again at once. `We are tired, but
                we shall rest better when we are outside,<q>' he said. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> think that n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of us will
                    wish to spend <name type="TIME">another <name type="TIME">night</name></name> in <name type="GPE">Mo<name type="GPE">ri</name>a</name>.'</q></p>
            <p>`No indeed! ' said <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>. `Which way shall we take? Yonder eastward arch? '</p>
            <p><q>'<name type="DATE">May</name>be,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. `But I du not know yet exactly where we are. Unless I
                am quite astray, I guess that we are above and to the north of the Great <name type="FAC">Gate</name>s; and
                it may not be easy to find the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght road down to them. <name type="ORG">The eastern arch</name> will
                probably prove to be the way that we must take; but before we make up our minds we
                ought to look about us. Let us go towards that light in the north door. If we could
                find a window it would help, but I fear that the light comes only down deep
                shafts.'</p>
            <p>Following his lead the <name type="ORG">Company</name> passed under the northern arch. They found themselves
                in a wide cor<name type="GPE">ri</name>dor. As they went along it the glimmer grew stronger, and they saw
                that it came through a doorway on their <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght. It was high and flat-topped, and the
                st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> door was still upon its hinges, standing <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> open. Beyond it was a large
                square chamber. It was dimly lit, but to their eyes, after so long a time in the
                dark, it seemed dazzlingly b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght, and they blinked as they entered.</p>
            <p>Their feet disturbed a deep dust upon the floor, and stumbled among things lying in
                the doorway whose shapes they could not at <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> make out. The chamber was lit by a
                wide shaft high in the further eastern wall; it slanted upwards and, far above, a
                small square patch of blue sky could be seen. The light of the shaft fell directly
                on a table in the middle of the room: a single oblong block, <name type="QUANTITY">about <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> feet</name> high,
                upon which was laid a great slab of white st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`I</name>t looks like a <name type="PERSON">tom</name>b,' muttered <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, and bent forwards with a cu<name type="GPE">ri</name>ous sense of
                foreboding, to look more closely at it. <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> came quickly to his side. On the
                slab runes were deeply g<name type="PERSON">raven</name>:</p>
            <p><q>'These are <name type="ORG">Daeron</name>'s Runes, such as were used of old in <name type="GPE">Mo<name type="GPE">ri</name>a</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>.
                'Here is w<name type="GPE">ri</name>t<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> in the tongues of <name type="ORG">Men</name> and <name type="ORG">Dwarves</name>:</p>

            <p>LORD OF MORIA.'</p>
            <p><q>'He is dead then,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> feared it was so.' <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> cast his hood over
                his face.</p>
        </chapter>
        <chapter num="5">
            <heading>Chapter 5</heading>
            <p>The <name type="FAC">B<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge</name> of <name type="GPE">Khaz</name>ad-d�m</p>
            <p>The <name type="ORG">Company</name> of the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> stood silent beside the <name type="PERSON">tom</name>b of <name type="PERSON">Balin</name>. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> thought of <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>
                and his long f<name type="GPE">ri</name>endship with the dwarf, and of <name type="PERSON">Balin</name>'s visit to the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> <name type="DATE">long ago</name>.
                In that dusty chamber in the mountains it seemed <name type="CARDINAL">a thousand</name> <name type="DATE">year</name>s ago and on the
                other side of the world.</p>
            <p>At length they stirred and looked up, and began to search for anything that would
                give them tidings of <name type="PERSON">Balin</name>'s fate, or show what had become of his folk. There was
                another smaller door on the other side of the chamber, under the shaft. By both the
                doors they could now see that many b<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s were lying, and among them were broken
                swords and axe<name type="PERSON">-he</name>ads, and cloven shields and helms. Some of the swords were crooked:
                orc-scimitars with blackened blades.</p>
            <p>There were many recesses cut in the rock of the walls, and in them were large
                iron-bound chests of wood. All had been broken and plundered; but beside the
                shattered lid of <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> there lay the remains of a book. It had been slashed and
                stabbed and partly burned, and it was so stained with black and other dark <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ks
                like old blood that little of it could be read. <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> lifted it carefully, but the
                leaves crackled and broke as he laid it on the slab. He pored over it for some time
                without speaking. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> standing at his side could see, as he gingerly
                turned the leaves, that they were w<name type="GPE">ri</name>t<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> by many different hands, in runes, both of
                <name type="GPE">Mo<name type="GPE">ri</name>a</name> and of <name type="ORG">Dale</name>, and here and there in <name type="PERSON">Elvish</name> sc<name type="GPE">ri</name>pt.</p>
            <p>At last <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> looked up. <q>'It seems to be a record of the fortunes of <name type="PERSON">Balin</name>'s
                    folk,'</q> he said. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> guess that it began with their coming to <name type="GPE">Dim<name type="GPE">ri</name>ll</name> <name type="ORG">Dale</name>

            <p><name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> paused and set a few leaves aside. <q>'There are several pages of the same

                    nothing more.'</q> <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> paused and stood in silent thought.</p>
            <p>A sudden dread and a horror of the chamber fell on the <name type="ORG">Company</name>. `_We cannot get
                    out_,<q>' muttered <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. 'It was well for us that the pool had sunk a little,
                    and that the <name type="PERSON">Watcher</name> was sleeping down at the southern end.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> raised his head and looked round. `They seem to have made a last stand by
                both doors,<q>' he said; 'but there were not many left by that time. So ended the

                    Now, I fear, we must say farewell to <name type="PERSON">Balin</name> son of Fundin. Here he must lie in
                    the halls of his fathers. We will take this book, the Book of <name type="PERSON">Mazarbul</name>, and look

                    deeply. Come, let us go! <name type="TIME">The <name type="TIME">morning</name></name> is passing.'</q></p>
            <p>'Which way shall we go? ' asked <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>.</p>
            <p><q>'Back to the hall,'</q> answered <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. 'But our visit to this room has not been
                in vain. I now know where we are. This must be, as <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> says, the Chamber of

                should leave by the eastern arch of the hall, and bear <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght and south, and go
                downwards. The <name type="CARDINAL">Twenty</name>-<name type="ORDINAL">first</name> <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>l should be on the <name type="CARDINAL">Seven</name>th Level, that is <name type="CARDINAL">six</name> above

            <p><name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> had hardly spoken these words, when there came a great noise: a rolling
                _Boom_ that seemed to come from depths far below, and to tremble in the st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> at
                their feet. They sprang towards the door in alarm. _Doom, doom_ it rolled again, as
                if huge hands were turning the very caverns of <name type="GPE">Mo<name type="GPE">ri</name>a</name> into a vast drum. Then there
                came an echoing blast: a great horn was blown in the hall, and answe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng horns and
                harsh c<name type="GPE">ri</name>es were heard further off. There was a hurrying sound of many feet.</p>
            <p>`They are coming! ' c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>.</p>

            <p>`Trapped! <q>' c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. `Why did I delay? Here we are, caught, just as they

            <p>_Doom, doom_ came the drum-beat and the walls shook.</p>
            <p>
                <q>'Slam the doors and wedge them! ' shouted <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. 'And keep your packs on as

            </p>
            <p>`No! <q>' said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. 'We must not get shut in. Keep the east door ajar! We will go
                    that way, if we get a chance.'</q></p>
            <p>Another harsh horn-call and sh<name type="GPE">ri</name>ll c<name type="GPE">ri</name>es rang out. Feet were coming down the
                cor<name type="GPE">ri</name>dor. There was a <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng and clatter as the <name type="ORG">Company</name> drew their swords. <name type="PERSON">Glamd<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng</name>
                sh<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> with a pale light, and <name type="PERSON">Sting</name> glinted at the edges. <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> set his shoulder
                against the western door.</p>
            <p>`Wait a moment! Do not close it yet! ' said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. He sprang forward to <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>'s
                side and drew himself <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name> his full h<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name>.</p>
            <p>'Who comes hither to disturb the rest of <name type="PERSON">Balin</name> <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd of <name type="GPE">Mo<name type="GPE">ri</name>a</name>? ' he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed in a loud
                voice.</p>
            <p>There was a rush of hoarse laughter, like <name type="DATE">the fall</name> of sliding st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s into a pit; amid
                the clamour a deep voice was raised in command. Doom, boom, doom went the drums in
                the deep.</p>
            <p>With a quick movement <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> stepped before the narrow opening of the door and
                thrust forward his staff: There was a dazzling flash that lit the chamber and the
                passage outside. For an instant the wizard looked out. Arrows whined and whistled
                down the cor<name type="GPE">ri</name>dor as he sprang back.</p>
            <p><q>'There are <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s, very many of them,'</q> he said. <name type="PERSON">`A</name>nd some are large and evil:
                black Uruks of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>. For the moment they are hanging back, but there is something
                else there. A great cave-troll, I think, or <name type="CARDINAL">more than <name type="CARDINAL">one</name></name>. There is no hope of
                escape that way.'</p>
            <p><q>'And no hope at all, if they come at the other door as well,'</q> said
                <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>.</p>
            <p><q>'There is no sound outside here yet,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>, who was standing by the
                eastern door lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing. `The passage on this side plunges straight down a stair: it
                plainly does not lead back towards the hall. But it is no good flying blindly this
                way with the pursuit just behind. We cannot block the door. Its key is g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> and the
                lock is broken, and it opens inwards. We must do something to delay the enemy <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>.
                We will make them fear the Chamber of <name type="PERSON">Mazarbul</name>!' he said g<name type="GPE">ri</name>mly feeling the edge of
                his sword, And�<name type="GPE">ri</name>l.</p>
            <p>Heavy feet were heard in the cor<name type="GPE">ri</name>dor. <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> flung himself against the door and
                heaved it to; then he wedged it with broken sword-blades and splinters of wood. The
                <name type="ORG">Company</name> retreated to the other side of the chamber. But they had no chance to fly
                yet. There was a blow on the door that made it quiver; and then it began to g<name type="GPE">ri</name>nd
                slowly open, d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ving back the wedges. A huge arm and shoulder, with a dark skin of
                greenish scales, was thrust through the widening gap. Then a great, flat, toeless
                foot was forced through below. There was a dead silence outside.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> leaped forward and hewed at the arm with all his might; but his sword rang,
                glanced aside, and fell from his shaken hand. The blade was notched.</p>
            <p>Suddenly, and to his own surp<name type="GPE">ri</name>se, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> felt a hot wrath blaze up in his heart. `The
                <name type="LOC">Shire</name>! ' he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed, and sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>nging beside <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>, he stooped, and stabbed with <name type="PERSON">Sting</name>
                at the hideous foot. There was a bellow, and the foot jerked back, nearly wren<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g
                <name type="PERSON">Sting</name> from <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s arm. <name type="ORG">Black</name> drops d<name type="GPE">ri</name>pped from the blade and smoked on the floor.
                <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> hurled himself against the door and slammed it again.</p>
            <p>`<name type="CARDINAL">One</name> for the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>! ' c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. `The hobbit's bite is deep! You have a good
                blade, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> son of <name type="ORG">Drogo</name>! '</p>
            <p>There was a crash on the door, followed by crash after crash. <name type="ORG">Rams</name> and hammers were
                beating against it. It cracked and staggered back, and the opening grew suddenly
                wide. Arrows came whistling in, but struck the northern wall, and fell harmlessly to
                the floor. There was a horn-blast and a rush of feet, and orcs <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> after another
                leaped into the chamber.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w many there were the <name type="ORG">Company</name> could not count. The affray was sharp, but the orcs
                were dismayed by the fierceness of the de<name type="PERSON">fen</name>ce. <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> shot <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> through the throat.
                <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> hewed the legs from under another that had sprung up on <name type="PERSON">Balin</name>'s <name type="PERSON">tom</name>b. <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>
                and <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> slew many. When <name type="CARDINAL">thirteen</name> had fallen the rest fled sh<name type="GPE">ri</name>eking. leaving the
                de<name type="PERSON">fen</name>ders unharmed, except for <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> who had a scratch along the scalp. A quick duck
                had saved him; and he had felled his orc: a sturdy thrust with his <name type="ORG">Barrow</name>-blade. A
                fire was smoulde<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng in his brown eyes that would have made <name type="PERSON">Ted</name> <name type="PERSON">Sandyman</name> step
                backwards, if he had seen it.</p>
            <p>`Now is the time! <q>' c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. `Let us go, before the troll returns!'</q></p>
            <p>But even as they retreated, and before <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> and <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> had reached the stair
                outside, a huge orc-chieftain, almost man-high, clad in black mail from head to
                foot, leaped into the chamber; behind him his followers clustered in the doorway.
                His broad flat face was <name type="PERSON">swart</name>, his eyes were like coals, and his tongue was red; he
                wielded a great spear. With a thrust of his huge hide shield he turned <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>'s
                sword and bore him backwards, throwing him to the ground. Diving under <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>'s
                blow with the speed of a st<name type="GPE">ri</name>king snake he charged into the <name type="ORG">Company</name> and thrust with
                his spear straight at <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. The blow caught him on the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght side, and <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> was
                hurled against the wall and pinned. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, with a cry, hacked at the spear-shaft, and
                it broke. But even as the orc flung down the truncheon and swept out his scimitar,
                And�<name type="GPE">ri</name>l came down upon his helm. There was a flash like flame and the helm burst
                asunder. The orc fell with cloven head. His followers fled howling, as <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> and
                <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> sprang at them.</p>
            <p>_Doom, doom_ went the drums in the deep. The great voice rolled out again.</p>
            <p>'Now! ' shouted <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. 'Now is the last chance. Run for it! '</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> picked up <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> where he lay by the wall and made for the stair, pushing
                <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> in front of him. The others followed; but <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> had to be dragged
                away by <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>: in spite of the pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>l he lingered by <name type="PERSON">Balin</name>'s <name type="PERSON">tom</name>b with his head
                bowed. <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> hauled the eastern door to, g<name type="GPE">ri</name>nding upon its hinges: it had great
                iron <name type="GPE">ri</name>ngs on either side, but could not be fas<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed.</p>
            <p><q>'I am all <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght,'</q> gasped <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> can walk. Put me down! '</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> nearly dropped him in his amazement. 'I thought you were dead! ' he
                c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed.</p>
            <p>
                <q>'Not yet! ' said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. 'But there is time for wonder. Off you go, all of you,
                    down the stairs! Wait <name type="TIME">a few <name type="TIME">minutes</name></name> for me at the bot<name type="PERSON">tom</name>, but if I do not come
                    soon, go on! Go quickly and choose paths leading <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght and downwards.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>'We cannot leave you to hold the door al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>! ' said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`Do</name> as I say! <q>' said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> fiercely. `<name type="PRODUCT">Sword</name>s are no more use here. Go!'</q></p>
            <p>The passage was lit by no shaft and was utterly dark. They groped their way down a
                long flight of steps, and then looked back; but they could see nothing, except high
                above them the faint glimmer of the wizard's staff. He seemed to be still standing
                on guard by the closed door. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> breathed heavily and leaned against <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, who put
                his arms about him. They stood pee<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng up the stairs into the darkness. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>
                thought he could hear the voice of <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> above, mutte<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng words that ran down the
                sloping roof with a sighing echo. He could not catch what was said. The walls seemed
                to be trembling. Every now and again the drum-beats throbbed and rolled: _doom,
                doom_.</p>
            <p>Suddenly at the top of the stair there was a stab of white light. Then there was a
                dull rumble and a heavy thud. The drum-beats broke out wildly: _doom-boom,
                doom-boom_, and then stopped. <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> came flying down the steps and fell to the
                ground in the midst of the <name type="ORG">Company</name>.</p>
            <p><name type="ORG">`Well</name>, well! That's over! <q>' said the wizard struggling to his feet. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> have <name type="PERSON">don</name>e
                    all that I could. But I have met my match, and have nearly been destroyed. But
                    <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t stand here! Go on! You will have to do without light for a while: I am
                    rather shaken. Go on! Go on! Where are you, <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>? Come ahead with me! Keep
                    close behind, all of you!'</q></p>
            <p>They stumbled after him wonde<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng what had happened. _Doom, doom_ went the drum-beats
                again: they now sounded muffled and far away, but they were following. There was no
                other sound of pursuit, neither tramp of feet, nor any voice. <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> took no turns,
                <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght or left, for the passage seemed to be going in the direction that he desired.
                Every now and again it descended a flight of steps, <name type="CARDINAL">fifty</name> or more, to a lower level.
                At the moment that was their chief danger; for in the dark they could not see a
                descent, until they came on it, and put their feet out into emptiness. <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> felt
                the ground with his staff like a blind man.</p>
            <p>At the end of <name type="TIME">an <name type="TIME">hour</name></name> they had g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> <name type="QUANTITY">a mile</name>, or maybe a little more, and had descended
                many flights of stairs. There was still no sound of pursuit. Almost they began to
                hope that they would escape. At the bot<name type="PERSON">tom</name> of the <name type="CARDINAL">seven</name>th flight <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> halted.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`I</name>t is getting hot! <q>' he gasped. `We ought to be down at least to the level of the
                    <name type="FAC">Gate</name>s now. Soon I think we should look for a left-hand turn to take us east. I
                    hope it is not far. I am very weary. I must rest here a moment, even if all the
                    orcs ever spawned are after us.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> took his arm and helped him down to a seat on the step. `What happened away up
                there at the door? ' he asked. `Did you meet the beater of the drums? '</p>
            <p><q>'I do not know,'</q> answered <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. `But I found myself suddenly faced by
                something that I have not met before. I could think of nothing to do but to try and
                put a shutting-spell on the door. I know many; but to do things of that kind <name type="GPE">ri</name>ghtly
                requires time, and even then the door can be broken by strength.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`A</name>s I stood there I could hear orc-voices on the other side: at any moment I thought
                they would burst it open. I could not hear what was said; they seemed to be talking
                in their own hideous language. All I caught was _gh�sh;_ that is "fire". Then
                something came into the chamber � I felt it through the door, and the orcs
                themselves were afraid and fell silent. It laid hold of the iron <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng, and then it
                perceived me and my spell.</p>
            <p>'What it was I cannot guess, but I have never felt such a challenge. The
                counter-spell was ter<name type="GPE">ri</name>ble. It nearly broke me. For an instant the door left my
                control and began to open! I had to speak a word of Command. That proved too great a
                strain. The door burst in pieces. Something dark as a cloud was blocking out all the
                light inside, and I was thrown backwards down the stairs. All the wall gave way, and
                the roof of the chamber as well, I think.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`I</name> am afraid <name type="PERSON">Balin</name> is bu<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed deep, and maybe something else is bu<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed there too. I
                cannot say. But at least the passage behind us was completely blocked. Ah! I have
                never felt so spent, but it is passing. And now what about you, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>? There was not
                time to say so, but I have never been more delighted in my life than when you spoke.
                I feared that it was a brave but dead hobbit that <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> was carrying.'</p>
            <p>`What about me? <q>' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. 'I am alive, and whole I think. I am bruised and in
                    pain, but it is not too bad.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="ORG">`Well</name>,' said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>, <name type="PERSON">`I</name> can only say that hobbits are made of a stuff so tough that
                I have never met the like of it. Had I known, I would have spoken softer in the Inn
                at <name type="PERSON">Bree</name>! That spear-thrust would have skewered a wild boar! '</p>
            <p><q>'Well, it did not skewer me, I am glad to say,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>; `though I feel as
                if I had been caught between a hammer and an anvil.' He said no more. He found
                breathing painful.</p>
            <p><q>'You take after <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. `There is more about you than meets the
                eye, as I said of him <name type="DATE">long ago</name>.' <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> wondered if the re<name type="PERSON">mar</name>k meant more than it
                said.</p>
            <p>They now went on again. Before long <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> spoke. He had keen eyes in the dark. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>
                think,' he said, `that there is a light ahead. But it is not <name type="DATE">day</name>light. It is red.
                What can it be? '</p>
            <p>`_Gh�sh!_' muttered <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> wonder if that is what they meant: that the lower
                levels are on fire? Still, we can only go on.'</p>
            <p>Soon the light became unmistakable, and could be seen by all. It was flicke<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng and
                glowing on the walls away down the passage before them. They could now see their
                way: in front the road sloped down swiftly, and some way ahead there stood a low
                archway; through it the glowing light came. The air became very hot.</p>
            <p>When they came to the arch <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> went through, signing to them to wait. As he stood
                just beyond the opening they saw his face lit by a red glow. Quickly he stepped
                back.</p>
            <p>`There is some new devilry here,' he said, 'devised for our welcome no doubt. But I
                know now where we are: we have reached the <name type="ORDINAL">First</name> <name type="PERSON">Deep</name>, the level immediately below
                the <name type="FAC">Gate</name>s. This is the <name type="ORDINAL">Second</name> <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>l of Old <name type="GPE">Mo<name type="GPE">ri</name>a</name>; and the <name type="FAC">Gate</name>s are near: away beyond
                the eastern end, on the left, not more than <name type="CARDINAL">a quarter</name> of <name type="QUANTITY">a mile</name>. Across the <name type="FAC">B<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge</name>,
                up a broad stair, along a wide road through the <name type="ORDINAL">First</name> <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>l, and out! But come and
                look! '</p>
            <p>They peered out. Before them was another cavernous hall. It was loftier and far
                longer than the <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> in which they had slept. They were near its eastern end;
                westward it ran away into darkness. Down the centre stalked a double line of
                towe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng pillars. They were carved like boles of mighty trees whose boughs upheld
                the roof with a bran<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g tracery of st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. Their stems were smooth and black, but a
                red glow was darkly mirrored in their sides. Right across the floor, close to the
                feet of <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> huge pillars a great fissure had opened. Out of it a fierce red light
                came, and now and again flames licked at the b<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk and curled about the bases of the
                columns. Wisps of dark smoke wavered in the hot air.</p>
            <p><q>'If we had come by the main road down from the upper halls, we should have been
                    trapped here,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. `Let us hope that the fire now lies between us
                and pursuit. Come! There is no time to lose.'</p>
            <p>Even as he spoke they heard again the pursuing drum-beat: _Doom, doom, doom_. Away
                beyond the shadows at the western end of the hall there came c<name type="GPE">ri</name>es and horn-calls.
                _Doom, doom_: the pillars seemed to tremble and the flames to quiver.</p>
            <p>`Now for the last race! ' said <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. 'If the sun is shining outside we may still
                escape. After me! '</p>
            <p>He turned left and sped across the smooth floor of the hall. The distance was greater
                than it had looked. As they ran they heard the beat and echo of many hurrying feet
                behind. A sh<name type="GPE">ri</name>ll yell went up: they had been seen. There was a <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng and clash of
                steel. An arrow whistled over <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s head.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> laughed. `They did not expect this,' he said. `The fire has cut them off. We
                are on the wrong side! '</p>
            <p>`<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok ahead! <q>' called <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. `The <name type="FAC">B<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge</name> is near. It is dangerous and
                    narrow.'</q></p>
            <p>Suddenly <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> saw before him a black chasm. At the end of the hall the floor
                vanished and fell to an unknown depth. The outer door could only be reached by a
                slender b<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge of st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, without kerb or rail, that spanned the chasm with <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>
                curving sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng of <name type="CARDINAL">fifty</name> feet. It was an ancient de<name type="PERSON">fen</name>ce of the <name type="ORG">Dwarves</name> against any
                enemy that might capture the <name type="ORDINAL">First</name> <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>l and the outer passages. They could only pass
                across it in single file. At the b<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> halted and the others came up in a
                pack behind.</p>
            <p>'Lead the way, <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>! ' he said. '<name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> and <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> next. Straight on and up the stair
                beyond the door! '</p>
            <p>Arrows fell among them. <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> struck <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and sprang back. Another pierced <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>'s
                hat and stuck there like a black feather. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> looked behind. Beyond the fire he
                saw swarming black figures: there seemed to be <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name>s of orcs. They brandished
                spears and scimitars which sh<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> red as blood in the firelight. _Doom, doom_ rolled
                the drum-beats, growing louder and louder, _doom, doom_.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> turned and set an arrow to the st<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng, though it was a long shot for his
                small bow. He drew, but his hand fell, and the arrow slipped to the ground. He gave
                a cry of dismay and fear. <name type="CARDINAL">Two</name> great trolls appeared; they bore great slabs of st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>,
                and flung them down to serve as gangways over the fire. But it was not the trolls
                that had filled the <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name> with terror. The ranks of the orcs had opened, and they
                crowded away, as if they themselves were afraid. Something was coming up behind
                them. What it was could not be seen: it was like a great shadow, in the middle of
                which was a dark form, of man-shape maybe, yet greater; and a power and terror
                seemed to be in it and to go before it.</p>
            <p>It came to the edge of the fire and the light faded as if a cloud had bent over it.
                Then with a rush it leaped across the fissure. The flames roared <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name> greet it, and
                wreathed about it; and a black smoke swirled in the air. Its streaming mane kindled,
                and blazed behind it. In its <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght hand was a blade like a stabbing tongue of fire;
                in its left it held a whip of many thongs.</p>
            <p>'Ai! ai! ' wailed <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. 'A <name type="GPE">Balrog</name>! A <name type="GPE">Balrog</name> is come! '</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> stared with wide eyes. `Du<name type="GPE">ri</name>n's Bane! ' he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed, and letting his axe fall he
                covered his face.</p>
            <p><q>'A <name type="GPE">Balrog</name>,'</q> muttered <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>. `Now I understand.<q>' He faltered and leaned
                    heavily on his staff. `What an evil fortune! And I am already weary.'</q></p>
            <p>The dark figure streaming with fire raced towards them. The orcs yelled and poured
                over the st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> gangways. Then <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> raised his horn and blew. <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ud the challenge
                rang and bellowed, like the shout of many throats under the cavernous roof. For a
                moment the orcs quailed and the fiery shadow halted. Then the echoes died as
                suddenly as a flame blown out by a dark wind, and the enemy advanced again.</p>
            <p><q>'Over the b<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, recalling his strength. `Fly! This is a foe
                beyond any of you. I must hold the narrow way. Fly! ' <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> and <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> did not
                heed the command, but still held their ground, side by side, behind <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> at the
                far end of the b<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge. The others halted just within the doorway at the hall's end,
                and turned, unable to leave their leader to face the enemy al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>.</p>
            <p>The <name type="GPE">Balrog</name> reached the b<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge. <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> stood in the middle of the span, leaning on
                the staff in his left hand, but in his other hand <name type="PERSON">Glamd<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng</name> gleamed, cold and white.
                His enemy halted again, facing him, and the shadow about it reached out like <name type="CARDINAL">two</name>
                vast wings. It raised the whip, and the thongs whined and cracked. <name type="ORG">Fire</name> came from
                its nost<name type="GPE">ri</name>ls. But <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> stood firm.</p>
            <p>`You cannot pass,<q>' he said. The orcs stood still, and a dead silence fell. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> am a
                    servant of the Secret <name type="ORG">Fire</name>, wielder of the flame of <name type="GPE">Anor</name>. You cannot pass. The
                    dark fire will not avail you, flame of <name type="PERSON">Ud�n.</name> Go back to the <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>! You cannot
                    pass.'</q></p>
            <p>The <name type="GPE">Balrog</name> made no answer. The fire in it seemed to die, but the darkness grew. It
                stepped forward slowly on to the b<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge, and suddenly it drew itself <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name> a great
                h<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name>, and its wings were spread from wall to wall; but still <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> could be
                seen, glimme<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng in the gloom; he seemed small, and altogether al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>: grey and bent,
                like a wizened tree before the onset of a storm.</p>
            <p>From out of the shadow a red sword leaped flaming.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Glamd<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng</name> glittered white in answer.</p>
            <p>There was a <name type="GPE">ri</name>nging clash and a stab of white fire. The <name type="GPE">Balrog</name> fell back and its
                sword flew up in mol<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> fragments. The wizard swayed on the b<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge, stepped back a
                pace, and then again stood still.</p>
            <p>'You cannot pass! ' he said.</p>
            <p>With a bound the <name type="GPE">Balrog</name> leaped full upon the b<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge. Its whip whirled and hissed.</p>
            <p>'He cannot stand al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>! ' c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> suddenly and ran back along the b<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge.
                '_<name type="PERSON">Elen</name>dil!_' he shouted. 'I am with you, <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>! '</p>
            <p>`<name type="ORG">Gondor</name>! ' c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> and leaped after him.</p>
            <p>At that moment <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> lifted his staff, and crying aloud he smote the b<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge before
                him. The staff broke asunder and fell from his hand. A blinding sheet of white flame
                sprang up. The b<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge cracked. Right at the <name type="GPE">Balrog</name>'s feet it broke, and the st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>
                upon which it stood crashed into the <name type="LOC">gulf</name>, while the rest remained, poised,
                quive<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng like a tongue of rock thrust out into emptiness.</p>
            <p>With a ter<name type="GPE">ri</name>ble cry the <name type="GPE">Balrog</name> fell forward, and its shadow plunged down and
                vanished. But even as it fell it swung its whip, and the thongs lashed and curled
                about the wizard's knees, dragging him to the b<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk. He staggered and fell, grasped
                vainly at the st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, and slid into the abyss. 'Fly, you fools! ' he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed, and was
                g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>.</p>
            <p>The fires went out, and blank darkness fell. The <name type="ORG">Company</name> stood rooted with horror
                sta<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng into the pit. Even as <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> and <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> came flying back, the rest of the
                b<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge cracked and fell. With a cry <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> roused them.</p>
            <p>'Come! I will lead you now! ' he called. 'We must obey his last command. Follow me!
                '</p>
            <p>They stumbled wildly up the great stairs beyond the door. <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> leading, <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> at
                the rear. At the top was a wide echoing passage. Along this they fled. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> heard
                <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> at his side weeping, and then he found that he himself was weeping as he ran.
                _Doom, doom, doom_ the drum-beats rolled behind, mournful now and slow; _doom!_</p>
            <p>They ran on. The light grew before them; great shafts pierced the roof. They ran
                swifter. They passed into a hall, b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght with <name type="DATE">day</name>light from its high windows in the
                east. They fled across it. <name type="PERSON">Thr</name>ough its huge broken doors they passed, and suddenly
                before them the Great <name type="FAC">Gate</name>s opened, an arch of blazing light.</p>
            <p>There was a guard of orcs crou<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g in the shadows behind the great door posts
                towe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng on either side, but the gates were shattered and cast down. <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> smote
                to the ground the captain that stood in his path, and the rest fled in terror of his
                wrath. The <name type="ORG">Company</name> swept past them and took no heed of them. Out of the <name type="FAC">Gate</name>s they
                ran and sprang down the huge and age-worn steps, the threshold of <name type="GPE">Mo<name type="GPE">ri</name>a</name>.</p>
            <p>Thus, at last, they came beyond hope under the sky and felt the wind on their
                faces.</p>
            <p>They did not halt until they were out of <name type="ORG">bowshot</name> from the walls. <name type="GPE">Dim<name type="GPE">ri</name>ll</name> <name type="ORG">Dale</name> lay
                about them. The shadow of the <name type="LOC">Misty <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s</name> lay upon it, but eastwards there was a
                golden light on the land. It was but <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> <name type="TIME">hour</name> after <name type="TIME">noon</name>. The sun was shining; the
                clouds were white and high.</p>
            <p>They looked back. Dark yawned the archway of the <name type="FAC">Gate</name>s under the mountain-shadow.
                Faint and far beneath the <name type="LOC">earth</name> rolled the slow drum-beats: _doom_. A thin black
                smoke trailed out. Nothing else was to be seen; the <name type="GPE">dale</name> all around was empty.
                _Doom_. G<name type="GPE">ri</name>ef at last wholly overcame them, and they wept long: some standing and
                silent, some cast upon the ground. _Doom, doom_. The drum-beats faded.</p>

            <p><q>'<name type="PERSON">Alas</name>! I Fear we cannot stay here longer,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. He looked towards the
                mountains and held up his sword. `<name type="LOC">Far</name>ewell, <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>! ' he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed. 'Did I not say to

                have we without you? '</p>
            <p>He turned to the <name type="ORG">Company</name>. `We must do without hope,<q>' he said. <name type="PERSON">`A</name>t least we may yet
                    be avenged. Let us gird ourselves and weep no more! Come! We have a long road,

            <p>They rose and looked about them. <name type="LOC">North</name>ward the <name type="GPE">dale</name> ran up into a <name type="LOC">glen</name> of shadows
                <name type="CARDINAL">between <name type="CARDINAL">two</name></name> great arms of the mountains, above which <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> white peaks were shining:
                <name type="GPE">Celebdil</name>, <name type="PERSON">Fanuidhol</name>, <name type="GPE">Caradhras</name>. the <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s of <name type="GPE">Mo<name type="GPE">ri</name>a</name>. At the head of the <name type="LOC">glen</name> a
                torrent flowed like a white lace over an endless ladder of short falls, and a mist
                of foam hung in the air about the mountains' feet.</p>
            <p>`Yonder is the <name type="GPE">Dim<name type="GPE">ri</name>ll</name> Stair,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>, pointing to <name type="DATE">the fall</name>s. 'Down the

            <p>`Or <name type="GPE">Caradhras</name> less cruel,' said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. `There he stands smiling in the sun! ' He
                shook his fist at the furthest of the snow-capped peaks and turned away.</p>
            <p>To the east the outflung arm of the mountains <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ched to a sudden end, and far lands
                could be desc<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed beyond them, wide and vague. To the south the <name type="LOC">Misty <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s</name>
                receded endlessly as far as sight could reach. <name type="QUANTITY">Less than <name type="QUANTITY">a mile</name></name> away, and a little
                below them, for they still stood high up on the west side of the <name type="GPE">dale</name>, there lay a
                mere. It was long and oval, shaped like a great spear<name type="PERSON">-he</name>ad thrust deep into the
                northern <name type="LOC">glen</name>; but its southern end was beyond the shadows under the sunlit sky. Yet
                its waters were dark: a deep blue like clear <name type="TIME">evening</name> sky seen from a lamp-lit room.
                Its face was still and unruffled. About it lay a smooth sward, shelving down on all
                sides to its bare unbroken <name type="GPE">ri</name>m.</p>
            <p>`There lies the <name type="ORG">Mirror</name>mere, deep Kheled-z�ram! <q>' said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> sadly. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> remember
                    that he said: "<name type="DATE">May</name> you have joy of the sight! But we cannot linger there." Now

                    that must remain.'</q></p>
            <p>The <name type="ORG">Company</name> now went down the road from the <name type="FAC">Gate</name>s. It was rough and broken, fading to
                a winding track between heather and whin that thrust amid the cracking st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s. But
                still it could be seen that once <name type="DATE">long ago</name> a great paved way had wound upwards from
                the lowlands of the <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Dwarf</name>-kingdom. In places there were ruined works of st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> beside
                the path, and mounds of green topped with slender birches, or fir-trees sighing in
                the wind. An eastward bend led them hard by the sward of <name type="ORG">Mirror</name>mere, and there not
                far from the roadside stood a single column broken at the top.</p>
            <p>'That is Du<name type="GPE">ri</name>n's <name type="ORG">St<name type="CARDINAL">one</name></name>! ' c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> cannot pass without turning aside for a

            <p>`Be swift then! <q>' said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>, looking back towards the <name type="FAC">Gate</name>s. `The <name type="ORG">Sun</name> sinks
                    early. The <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s will not, maybe, come out till after <name type="TIME">dusk</name>, but we must be far
                    away <name type="TIME">before <name type="TIME">night</name></name>fall. The <name type="PERSON">Moon</name> is almost spent, and it will be dark
                    to<name type="TIME">night</name>.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Come with me, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>! ' c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed the dwarf, sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>nging from the road. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> would not
                    have you go without seeing Kheled-z�ram.'</q> He ran down the long green slope.
                <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> followed slowly, drawn by the still blue water in spite of hurt and wea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ness;
                <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> came up behind.</p>
            <p>Beside the standing st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> halted and looked up. It was cracked and
                weather-worn, and the faint runes upon its side could not be read. `This pillar
                <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ks the spot where Du<name type="GPE">ri</name>n <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> looked in the <name type="ORG">Mirror</name>mere,<q>' said the dwarf. 'Let
                    us look ourselves once, ere we go!'</q></p>
            <p>They stooped over the dark water. At <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> they could see nothing. Then slowly they
                saw the forms of the encircling mountains mirrored in a profound blue, and the peaks
                were like plumes of white flame above them; beyond there was a space of sky. There
                like jewels sunk in the deep sh<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> glinting stars, though sunlight was in the sky
                above. Of their own stooping forms no shadow could be seen.</p>
            <p>'O Kheled-z�ram fair and wonderful! ' said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. `There lies the <name type="PRODUCT">Crown</name> of Du<name type="GPE">ri</name>n till

                green-sward to the road again.</p>
            <p>`What did you see? ' said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> to <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, but <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> was too deep in thought to
                answer.</p>
            <p>The road now turned south and went quickly downwards, running out from between the
                arms of the <name type="GPE">dale</name>. Some way below the mere they came on a deep well of water, clear
                as crystal, from which a freshet fell over a st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> lip and ran glis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing and
                gurgling down a steep rocky channel.</p>
            <p><q>'Here is the sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng from which the <name type="ORG">Silverlode</name> <name type="GPE">ri</name>ses.'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. <name type="PERSON">`Do</name> not

            <p><q>'Soon it becomes a swift <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver, and it gathers water from many other
                    mountain-streams,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. `Our road leads beside it for many miles.
                For I shall take you by the road that <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> chose, and <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> I hope to come to the
                woods where the <name type="ORG">Silverlode</name> flows into the <name type="LOC">Great <name type="LOC">River</name></name>-out yonder.' They looked as he
                pointed, and before them they could see the stream leaping down to the trough of the
                valley, and then running on and away into the lower lands, until it was lost in a
                golden haze.</p>
            <p>`There lie the woods of <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>thl�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en! ' said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. `That is the fairest of all the
                dwellings of my people. There are no trees like the trees of that land. For in the
                <name type="DATE">autumn</name> their leaves fall not, but turn to gold. Not till the sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng comes and the
                new green opens do they fall, and then the boughs are laden with yellow flowers; and
                the floor of the wood is golden, and golden is the roof, and its pillars are of
                silver, for the bark of the trees is smooth and grey. So still our songs in <name type="GPE">Mirkwood</name>
                say. My heart would be glad if I were beneath the eaves of that wood, and it were
                sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ngtime! '</p>
            <p>`My heart will be glad, even in <name type="DATE">the <name type="DATE">winter</name></name>,' said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. 'But it lies many miles
                away. Let us has<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>! '</p>
            <p>For some time <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> managed to keep up with the others; but <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> was
                leading them at a great pace, and after a while they lagged behind. They had ea<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>
                nothing since the <name type="TIME">early <name type="TIME">morning</name></name>. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>'s cut was burning like fire, and his head felt
                light. In spite of the shining sun the wind seemed chill after the warm darkness of
                <name type="GPE">Mo<name type="GPE">ri</name>a</name>. He shivered. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> felt every step more painful and he gasped for breath.</p>
            <p>At last <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> turned, and seeing them now far behind, he spoke to <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. The
                others halted, and <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> ran back, calling to <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> to come with him.</p>
            <p>
                <q>'I am sorry, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>! ' he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed, full of concern. `So much has happened this <name type="DATE">day</name>
                    and we have such need of haste, that I have forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> that you were hurt; and
                    <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> too. You should have spoken. We have <name type="PERSON">don</name>e nothing to ease you, as we ought,
                    though all the orcs of <name type="GPE">Mo<name type="GPE">ri</name>a</name> were after us. Come now! A little further on there
                    is a place where we can rest for a little. There I will do what I can for you.
                    Come, <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>! We will carry them.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>Soon afterwards they came upon another stream that ran down from the west, and joined
                its bubbling water with the hurrying <name type="ORG">Silverlode</name>. Together they plunged over a fall
                of green-hued st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, and foamed down into a <name type="ORG">dell</name>. About it stood fir-trees, short
                and bent, and its sides were steep and clothed with harts-tongue and shrubs of
                whortle-berry. At the bot<name type="PERSON">tom</name> there was a level space through which the stream flowed
                noisily over shining pebbles. Here they rested. It was now nearly <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> <name type="TIME">hour</name>s after
                <name type="TIME">noon</name>, and they had come only <name type="QUANTITY">a few miles</name> from the <name type="FAC">Gate</name>s. Already the sun was
                weste<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng.</p>
            <p>While <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> and the <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> younger hobbits kindled a fire of brush- and fir-wood, and
                drew water, <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ded <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> and <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>'s wound was not deep, but it looked
                ugly, and <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>'s face was grave as he examined it. After a moment he looked up
                with relief.</p>
            <p>
                <q>'Good luck, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>! ' he said. 'Many have received worse than this in payment for
                    the slaying of their <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> orc. The cut is not pois<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>d, as the wounds of
                    orc-blades too of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> are. It should heal well when I have <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ded it. Bathe it
                    when <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> has heated water.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>He opened his pouch and drew out some withered leaves. `They are dry and some of
                their virtue has <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, he said, but here I have still some of the leaves of _athelas_
                that I gathered near <name type="ORG">Weathertop</name>. Crush <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> in the water, and wash the wound clean,
                and I will bind it. Now it is your turn. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>! '</p>
            <p><q>'I am all <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, reluctant to have his garments touched. <name type="PERSON">`A</name>II I
                needed was some food and a little rest.'</p>
            <p>`No! <q>' said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. `We must have a look and see what the hammer and the anvil
                    have <name type="PERSON">don</name>e to you. I still <name type="PERSON">mar</name>vel that you are alive at all.'</q> Gently he
                st<name type="GPE">ri</name>pped off <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s old jacket and worn tunic, and gave a gasp of wonder. Then he
                laughed. The silver corslet shimmered before his eyes like the light upon a <name type="GPE">ri</name>ppling
                sea. Carefully he took it off and held it up, and the gems on it glittered like
                stars. and the sound of the shaken <name type="GPE">ri</name>ngs was like the tinkle of rain in a pool.</p>
            <p>`<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok, my f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends!<q>' he called. <name type="PERSON">`He</name>re's a pretty hobbit-skin to wrap an
                    <name type="ORG">elven</name>-p<name type="GPE">ri</name>nceling in! If it were known that hobbits had such hides, all the
                    hunters of <name type="LOC">Middle-<name type="LOC">earth</name></name> would be <name type="GPE">ri</name>ding to the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`A</name>nd all the arrows of all the hunters in the world would be in vain,' said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>,
                gazing at the mail in wonder. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>t is a <name type="PERSON">mith<name type="GPE">ri</name>l</name>-coat. <name type="PERSON">Mith<name type="GPE">ri</name>l</name>! I have never seen or

                undervalued it. But it was well given! '</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`I</name> have of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> wondered what you and <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> were doing, so close in his little room,'
                said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. 'Bless the old hobbit! I love him more than ever. I hope we get a chance
                of telling him about it! '</p>
            <p>There was a dark and blackened bruise on <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght side and breast. Under the
                mail there was a shirt of soft leather, but at <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> point the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ngs had been d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ven
                through it into the flesh. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s left side also was scored and bruised where he
                had been hurled against the wall. While the others set the food ready. <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>
                bathed the hurts with water in which athelas was steeped. The pungent fragrance
                filled the <name type="ORG">dell</name>, and all those who stooped over the steaming water felt refreshed
                and strengthened. Soon <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> felt the pain leave him, and his breath grew easy:
                though he was stiff and sore to the touch for m<name type="DATE">any <name type="DATE">day</name></name>s. <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> bound some soft
                pads of cloth at his side.</p>
            <p>`The mail is <name type="PERSON">mar</name>vellously light,<q>' he said. `Put it on again, if you can bear it.
                    My heart is glad to know that you have such a coat. Do not lay it aside, even in
                    sleep, unless fortune b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ngs you where you are safe for a while; and that will
                    seldom chance while your quest lasts.'</q></p>
            <p>When they had ea<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>, the <name type="ORG">Company</name> got ready to go on. They put out the fire and hid
                all traces of it. Then climbing out of the <name type="ORG">dell</name> they took to the road again. They
                had not g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> far before the sun sank behind the westward h<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name>s and great shadows
                crept down the mountain-sides. Dusk veiled their feet, and mist rose in the hollows.
                Away in the east the <name type="TIME">evening</name> light lay pale upon the dim lands of distant plain and
                wood. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> and <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> now feeling eased and greatly refreshed were able to go at a
                fair pace, and with only <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ef halt <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> led the <name type="ORG">Company</name> on for nearly <name type="CARDINAL">three</name>
                more <name type="TIME">hour</name>s.</p>
            <p>It was dark. <name type="PERSON">Deep</name> <name type="TIME">night</name> had fallen. There were many clear stars, hut the fast-<name type="PERSON">wan</name>ing
                moon would not be seen till late. <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> and <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> were at the rear, walking softly
                and not speaking, lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing for any sound upon the road behind. At length <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>
                broke the silence.</p>
            <p><q>'Not a sound but the wind,'</q> he said. `There are no goblins near, or my ears
                are made of wood. It is to be hoped that the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s will be con<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>t with d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ving us
                from <name type="GPE">Mo<name type="GPE">ri</name>a</name>. And maybe that was all their purpose, and they had nothing else to do

            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> did not answer. He looked at <name type="PERSON">Sting</name>, and the blade was dull. Yet he had heard
                something, or thought he had. As soon as the shadows had fallen about them and the
                road behind was dim, he had heard again the quick patter of feet. Even now he heard
                it. He turned swiftly. There were <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> tiny gleams of light behind, or for a moment
                he thought he saw them, but at once they slipped aside and vanished.</p>
            <p>`What is it? ' said the dwarf.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`I</name> <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t know.<q>' answered <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. 'I thought I heard feet, and I thought I saw a

            <p><name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> halted and stooped to the ground. <q>'I hear nothing but the <name type="TIME">night</name>-speech of

            <p><name type="TIME">The <name type="TIME">night</name></name>-wind blew chill up the valley to meet them. Before them a wide grey shadow
                loomed, and they heard an endless rustle of leaves like poplars in the breeze.</p>
            <p>`<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>thl�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en! ' c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. '<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>thl�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en! We have come to the eaves of the Golden

            <p>Under the <name type="TIME">night</name> the trees stood tall before them, arched over the road and stream
                that ran suddenly beneath their spreading boughs. In the dim light of the stars
                their stems were grey, and their quive<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng leaves a hint of fallow gold.</p>

            <p><q>'Indeed deep in the wood they dwell,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>, and sighed as if some

            <p>The voice of <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> faltered, and the song ceased. <q>'I cannot sing any more,'</q>
                he said. <q>'That is but a part, for I have forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> much. It is long and sad, for

            <p>`But the <name type="ORG">Dwarves</name> did not make the evil,' said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`I</name> said not so; yet evil came,' answered <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> sadly. `Then many of the <name type="ORG">Elves</name> of
                <name type="PERSON">Nimrodel</name>'s kindred left their dwellings and departed and she was lost far in the

                <name type="PERSON">Amroth</name> her lover waited for her. But in the sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng when the wind is in the new
                leaves the echo of her voice may still be heard by <name type="DATE">the fall</name>s that bear her name. And
                when the wind is in the <name type="LOC">South</name> the voice of <name type="PERSON">Amroth</name> comes up from the sea; for
                <name type="PERSON">Nimrodel</name> flows into <name type="ORG">Silverlode</name>, that <name type="ORG">Elves</name> call <name type="PERSON">Celebrant</name>, and <name type="PERSON">Celebrant</name> into <name type="GPE">Anduin</name>
                the Great. and <name type="GPE">Anduin</name> flows into the Bay of <name type="PERSON">Belfalas</name> whence the <name type="ORG">Elves</name> of L�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en set
                sail. But neither <name type="PERSON">Nimrodel</name> nor <name type="PERSON">Amroth</name> ever came back.</p>
            <p>
                <q>'It is told that she had a house built in the branches of a tree that grew near
                    <name type="DATE">the fall</name>s; for that was the cus<name type="PERSON">tom</name> of the <name type="ORG">Elves</name> of L�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en, to dwell in the

                    <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>-people. <name type="PERSON">Deep</name> in their forest the trees are very great. The people of the
                    woods did not delve in the ground like <name type="ORG">Dwarves</name>, nor build strong places of st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>
                    before the <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name> came.'</q>
            </p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`A</name>nd even in these latter <name type="DATE">day</name>s dwelling in the trees might be thought safer than
                sitting on the ground,' said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. He looked across the stream to the road that led
                back to <name type="GPE">Dim<name type="GPE">ri</name>ll</name> <name type="ORG">Dale</name>, and then up into the roof of dark boughs above.</p>
            <p>`Your words b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng good counsel, <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. `We cannot build a house,
                    but to<name type="TIME">night</name> we will do as the <name type="ORG">Galadh<name type="GPE">ri</name>m</name> and seek refuge in the tree-tops, if we
                    can. We have sat here beside the road already longer than was wise.'</q></p>
            <p>The <name type="ORG">Company</name> now turned aside from the path, and went into the shadow of the deeper
                woods, westward along the mountain-stream away from <name type="ORG">Silverlode</name>. Not far from the
                falls of <name type="PERSON">Nimrodel</name> they found a cluster of trees, some of which overhung the stream.
                Their great grey trunks were of mighty girth, but their h<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name> could not be
                guessed.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`I</name> will climb up,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> am at home among trees, by root or bough,
                    though these trees are of a kind strange to me, save as a name in song.
                    _Mellyrn_ they are called, and are those that bear the yellow blossom, but I
                    have never climbed in <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. I will see now what is their shape and way of
                    growth.'</q></p>
            <p>`Whatever it may be,' said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>, `they will be <name type="PERSON">mar</name>vellous trees indeed if they can
                offer any rest at <name type="TIME">night</name>, except to birds. I cannot sleep on a perch! '</p>
            <p><q>'Then dig a hole in the ground,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>, `if that is more after the
                fashion of your kind. But you must dig swift and deep, if you wish to hide from
                <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s.' He sprang lightly up from the ground and caught a branch that grew from the
                trunk high above his head. But even as he swung there for a moment, a voice spoke
                suddenly from the tree-shadows above him.</p>
            <p>`_Daro!_' it said in commanding t<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, and <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> dropped back to <name type="LOC">earth</name> in surp<name type="GPE">ri</name>se
                and fear. He shrank against the bole of the tree.</p>
            <p>'Stand still! ' he whispered to the others. <name type="PERSON">`Do</name> not move or speak! '</p>
            <p>There was a sound of soft laughter over their heads, and then another clear voice
                spoke in an <name type="ORG">elven</name>-tongue. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> could understand little of what was said, for the
                speech that the <name type="PERSON">Silvan</name> folk east of the mountains used among themselves was unlike
                that of the <name type="LOC">West</name>. <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> looked up and answered in the same language.</p>
            <p>`Who are they, and what do they say? ' asked <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>.</p>
            <p>`They're <name type="ORG">Elves</name>,' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. `Can't you hear their voices? '</p>
            <p>`Yes, they are <name type="ORG">Elves</name>,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>; `and they say that you breathe so loud that
                    they could shoot you in the dark.'</q> <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> hastily put his hand over his mouth.
                    <q>'But they say also that you need have no fear. They have been aware of us for
                    a long while. They heard my voice across the <name type="PERSON">Nimrodel</name>, and knew that I was <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>
                    of their <name type="LOC">North</name>ern kindred, and therefore they did not hinder our crossing; and
                    afterwards they heard my song. Now they bid me climb up with <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>; for they
                    seem to have had some tidings of him and of our journey. The others they ask to
                    wait a little and to keep watch at the foot of the tree, until they have decided
                    what is to be <name type="PERSON">don</name>e.'</q></p>
            <p>Out of the shadows a ladder was let down: it was made of rope, silver-grey and
                glimme<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng in the dark, and though it looked slender it proved strong enough to bear
                many men. <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> ran lightly up, and <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> followed slowly; behind came <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> trying
                not to breathe loudly. The branches of the mallorn-tree grew out nearly straight
                from the trunk, and then swept upward; but near the top the main stem divided into a
                crown of many boughs, and among these they found that there had been built a wooden
                platform, or _flet_ as such things were called in those <name type="DATE">day</name>s: the <name type="ORG">Elves</name> called it a
                _talan_. It was reached by a round hole in the centre through which the ladder
                passed.</p>
            <p>When <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> came at last up on to the flet he found <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> seated with <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> other
                <name type="ORG">Elves</name>. They were clad in shadowy-grey, and could not be seen among the tree-stems,
                unless they moved suddenly. They stood up, and <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of them uncovered a small lamp
                that gave out a slender silver beam. He held it up, looking at <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s face, and
                <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>'s. Then he shut off the light again, and spoke words of welcome in his
                <name type="ORG">elven</name>-tongue. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> spoke haltingly in return.</p>
            <p>`Welcome!' the <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name> then said again in <name type="LAW">the Common Language</name>, speaking slowly. 'We
                seldom use any tongue but our own; for we dwell now in the heart of the forest, and

            <p>`<name type="CARDINAL">Eight</name>,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. `Myself, <name type="CARDINAL">four</name> hobbits; and <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> men, <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of whom, <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>,

                our liking. If <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> and <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> will guard him, and answer for him, he shall
                pass; but he must go blindfold through <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>thl�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en.</p>
            <p>`But now we must debate no longer. Your folk must not remain on the ground. We have
                been keeping watch on the <name type="GPE">ri</name>vers, ever since we saw a great troop of <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s going
                north toward <name type="GPE">Mo<name type="GPE">ri</name>a</name>, along the skirts of the mountains, m<name type="DATE">any <name type="DATE">day</name></name>s ago. Wolves are
                howling on the wood's borders. If you have indeed come from <name type="GPE">Mo<name type="GPE">ri</name>a</name>, the pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>l cannot
                be far behind. <name type="PERSON">Tom</name>orrow early you must go on.</p>
            <p>
                <q>'The <name type="CARDINAL">four</name> hobbits shall climb up here and stay with us-we do not fear them! There
                    is another _talan_ in the next tree. There the others must take refuge. You,
                    <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>, must answer to us for them. Call us, if anything is amiss! And have an
                    eye on that dwarf!'</q>
            </p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> at once went down the ladder to take <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>dir's message; and soon afterwards
                <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> clambered up on to the high flet. They were out of breath and
                seemed rather scared.</p>
            <p>`There!<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> panting. `We have lugged up your blankets as well as our own.
                    <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> has hidden all the rest of the baggage in a deep d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ft of
                leaves.'</q></p>
            <p>`You had no need of your burdens,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>dir. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>t is cold in the tree-tops in
                    <name type="DATE">winter</name>, though the wind to<name type="TIME">night</name> is in the <name type="LOC">South</name>; but we have food and d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk to
                    give you that will d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ve away the <name type="TIME">night</name>-chill, and we have skins and cloaks to
                    spare.'</q></p>
            <p>The hobbits accepted this <name type="ORG">sec</name>ond (and far better) supper very gladly. Then they
                wrapped themselves warmly, not only in the fur-cloaks of the <name type="ORG">Elves</name>, but in their own
                blankets as well, and t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed to go to sleep. But weary as they were only <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> found
                that easy to do. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbits do not like h<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name>s, and do not sleep upstairs, even when
                they have any stairs. The flet was not at all to their liking as a bedroom. It had
                no walls. not even a rail; only on <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> side was there a light plaited screen, which
                could be moved and fixed in different places according to the wind.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> went on talking for a while. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> hope, if I do go to sleep in this bed-loft,
                that I shan't roll off,' he said.</p>
            <p>`Once I do get to sleep,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, 'i shall go on sleeping, whether I roll off or
                    no. And the less said, the so<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>r I'll drop off, if you take my
                meaning.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> lay for some time awake, and looked up at the stars glinting through the pale
                roof of quive<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng leaves. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> was sno<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng at his side long before he himself closed
                his eyes. He could dimly see the grey forms of <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> elves sitting motionless with
                their arms about their knees, speaking in whispers. The other had g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> down to take
                up his watch on <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the lower branches. At last lulled by the wind in the boughs
                above, and the sweet murmur of <name type="DATE">the fall</name>s of <name type="PERSON">Nimrodel</name> below, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> fell asleep with
                the song of <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> running in his mind.</p>
            <p><name type="TIME">Late in the <name type="TIME">night</name></name> he awoke. The other hobbits were asleep. The <name type="ORG">Elves</name> were g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. The
                sickle <name type="PERSON">Moon</name> was gleaming dimly among the leaves. The wind was still. A little way
                off he heard a harsh laugh and the tread of many feet on the ground below. There was
                a <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng of metal. The sounds died slowly away, and seemed to go southward, on into
                the wood.</p>
            <p>A head appeared suddenly through the hole in the flet. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> sat up in alarm and saw
                that it was a grey-hooded <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name>. He looked towards the hobbits.</p>
            <p>`What is it? ' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.</p>
            <p>`_Yrch!_' said the <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name> in a hissing whisper, and cast on to the flet the rope-ladder
                rolled up.</p>
            <p>'<name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s! ' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. `What are they doing? ' But the <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name> had g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>.</p>
            <p>There were no more sounds. Even the leaves were silent, and the very falls seemed to
                be hushed. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> sat and shivered in his wraps. He was thankful that they had not
                been caught on the ground; but he felt that the trees offered little protection,
                except concealment. <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s were as keen as hounds on a scent, it was said, but they
                could also climb. He drew out <name type="PERSON">Sting</name>: it flashed and glittered like a blue flame and
                then slowly faded again and grew dull. In spite of the fading of his sword the
                feeling of immediate danger did not leave <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, rather it grew stronger. He got up
                and crawled to the opening and peered down. He was almost certain that he could hear
                stealthy movements at the tree's foot far below.</p>
            <p>Not <name type="ORG">Elves</name>; for the woodland folk were altogether noiseless in their movements. Then
                he heard faintly a sound like sniffing: and something seemed to be scrabbling on the
                bark of the tree-trunk. He stared down into the dark, holding his breath.</p>
            <p>Something was now climbing slowly, and its breath came like a soft hissing through
                closed teeth. Then coming up, close to the stem, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> saw <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> pale eyes. They
                stopped and gazed upward unwinking. Suddenly they turned away, and a shadowy figure
                slipped round the trunk of the tree and vanished.</p>
            <p>Immediately afterwards <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>dir came climbing swiftly up through the branches. `There
                was something in this tree that I have never seen before,' he said. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>t was not an
                orc. It fled as soon as I touched the tree-stem. It seemed to be wary, and to have
                some skill in trees, or I might have thought that it was <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of you hobbits.</p>
            <p>'I did not shoot, for I dared not arouse any c<name type="GPE">ri</name>es: we cannot <name type="GPE">ri</name>sk battle. A strong
                company of <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s has passed. They crossed the <name type="PERSON">Nimrodel</name>-curse their foul feet in its
                clean water!-and went on down the old road beside the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver. They seemed to pick up
                some scent, and they searched the ground for a while near the place where you
                halted. The <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> of us could not challenge <name type="CARDINAL">a <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name></name>, so we went ahead and spoke
                with feigned voices, leading them on into the wood.</p>
            <p>`<name type="ORG">Orophin</name> has now g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> in haste back to our dwellings to warn our people. N<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the
                <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s will ever return out of L�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en. And there will be many <name type="ORG">Elves</name> hidden on the
                northern border before <name type="TIME">another <name type="TIME">night</name></name> falls. But you must take the road south as soon
                as it is fully light.'</p>
            <p>Day came pale from the <name type="LOC">East</name>. As the light grew it filtered through the yellow leaves
                of the mallorn, and it seemed to the hobbits that the early sun of a cool <name type="DATE">summer</name>'s
                <name type="TIME">morning</name> was shining. Pale-blue sky peeped among the moving branches. <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>oking through
                an opening on the south side of the flet <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> saw all the valley of the <name type="ORG">Silverlode</name>
                lying like a sea of fallow gold tossing gently in the breeze.</p>
            <p><name type="TIME">The <name type="TIME">morning</name></name> was still young and cold when the <name type="ORG">Company</name> set out again, guided now by
                <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>dir and his brother R�mil. `<name type="LOC">Far</name>ewell, sweet <name type="PERSON">Nimrodel</name>! <q>' c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>
                    looked back and caught a gleam of white foam among the grey tree-stems.
                    `<name type="LOC">Far</name>ewell,'</q> he said. It seemed to him that he would never hear again a
                running water so beautiful, for ever blending its innumerable notes in an endless
                changeful music.</p>
            <p>They went back to the path that still went on along the west side of the <name type="ORG">Silverlode</name>,
                and for some way they followed it southward. There were the p<name type="GPE">ri</name>nts of orc-feet in
                the <name type="LOC">earth</name>. But soon <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>dir turned aside into the trees and halted on the bank of the
                <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver under their shadows.</p>
            <p>`There is <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of my people yonder across the stream,<q>' he said `though you may not
                    see him.'</q> He gave a call like the low whistle of a bird, and out of a
                thicket of young trees an <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name> stepped, clad in grey, but with his hood thrown back;
                his <name type="PERSON">hai</name>r glinted like gold in the <name type="TIME">morning</name> sun. <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>dir skilfully cast over the stream
                a coil of grey rope, and he caught it and bound the end about a tree near the
                bank.</p>
            <p>`<name type="PERSON">Celebrant</name> is already a strong stream here, as you see,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>dir 'and it runs
                    both swift and deep, and is very cold. We do not set foot in it so far north,
                    unless we must. But in these <name type="DATE">day</name>s of watchfulness we do not make b<name type="GPE">ri</name>dges. This
                    is how we cross! Follow me!'</q> He made his end of the rope fast about another
                tree, and then ran lightly along it, over the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver and back again, as if he were on
                a road.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`I</name> can walk this path,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>; `but the others have not this skill. Must
                    they swim?'</q></p>
            <p>`No!<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>dir. `We have <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> more ropes. We will fas<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> them above the other,
                    <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> shoulder-high, and another <name type="CARDINAL">half</name>-high, and holding these the strangers should
                    be able to cross with care.'</q></p>
            <p>When this slender b<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge had been made, the <name type="ORG">Company</name> passed over, some cautiously and
                slowly, others more easily. Of the hobbits <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> proved the best for he was
                sure-footed, and he walked over quickly, holding only with <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> hand; but he kept his
                eyes on the bank ahead and did not look down. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> shuffled along, clut<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g hard,
                and looking down into the pale eddying water as if it was a chasm in the
                mountains.</p>
            <p>He breathed with relief when he was safely across. `Live and learn! as my gaffer used
                to say. Though he was thinking of gardening, not of roosting like a bird, nor of
                trying to walk like a spider. Not even my uncle <name type="PERSON">Andy</name> ever did a t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ck like that!
                '</p>
            <p>When at length all the <name type="ORG">Company</name> was gathered on <name type="GPE">the east bank</name> of the <name type="ORG">Silverlode</name>, the
                <name type="ORG">Elves</name> untied the ropes and coiled <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> of them. R�mil, who had remained on the other
                side, drew back the last <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, slung it on his shoulder, and with a wave of his hand
                went away, back to <name type="PERSON">Nimrodel</name> to keep watch.</p>
            <p>`Now, f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends,' said <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>dir, `you have entered the <name type="NORP">Naith</name> of L�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en or the <name type="PERSON">Gore</name>, as
                you would say, for it is the land that lies like a spear<name type="PERSON">-he</name>ad between the arms of
                <name type="ORG">Silverlode</name> and <name type="GPE">Anduin</name> the Great. We allow no strangers to spy out the <name type="ORG">sec</name>rets of the
                <name type="NORP">Naith</name>. Few indeed are permitted even to set foot there.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`A</name>s was agreed, I shall here blindfold the eyes of <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> the <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Dwarf</name>. The other may
                walk free for a while, until we come nearer to our dwellings, down in <name type="PERSON">Egladil</name>, in
                the Angle between the waters.'</p>
            <p>This was not at all to the liking of <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. `The agreement was made without my
                    consent,<q>' he said. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> will not walk blindfold, like a beggar or a p<name type="GPE">ri</name>s<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>r.
                    And I am no spy. My folk have never had dealings with any of the servants of the
                    Enemy. Neither have we <name type="PERSON">don</name>e harm to the <name type="ORG">Elves</name>. I am no more likely to betray you
                    than <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>, or any other of my companions.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'I do not doubt you,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>dir. <q>'Yet this is our law. I am not the
                    master of the law, and cannot set it aside. I have <name type="PERSON">don</name>e much in letting you set
                    foot over <name type="PERSON">Celebrant</name>.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> was obstinate. He planted his feet firmly apart, and laid his hand upon the
                haft of his axe. <q>'I will go forward free,'</q> he said, <q>'or I will go back and
                    seek my own land, where I am known to be true of word, though I pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>sh al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> in
                    the wilderness.'</q></p>
            <p>`You cannot go back,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>dir sternly. 'Now you have come thus far, you must
                    be brought before the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd and the <name type="PERSON">Lady</name>. They shall judge you, to hold you or to
                    give you leave, as they will. You cannot cross the <name type="GPE">ri</name>vers again, and behind you
                    there are now <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret sentinels that you cannot pass. You would be slain before
                    you saw them.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> drew his axe from his belt. <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>dir and his companion bent their bows. 'A plague
                on <name type="ORG">Dwarves</name> and their stiff necks! ' said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>.</p>
            <p><q>'Come!'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>f I am still to lead this <name type="ORG">Company</name>, you must do as I
                bid. It is hard upon the <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Dwarf</name> to be thus singled out. We will all be blindfold,
                even <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. That will be best, though it will make the journey slow and dull.'</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> laughed suddenly. <name type="PERSON">`A</name> merry troop of fools we shall look! Will <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>dir lead us
                all on a st<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng, like many blind beggars with <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> dog? But I will be con<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>t, if
                only <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> here shares my blindness.'</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`I</name> am an <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name> and a kinsman here,' said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>, becoming angry in his turn.</p>
            <p>`Now let us cry: "a plague on the stiff necks of <name type="ORG">Elves</name>!"' said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. `But the
                <name type="ORG">Company</name> shall all fare alike. Come, bind our eyes <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>dir! '</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`I</name> shall claim full amends for every fall and stubbed toe, if you do not lead us

            <p><q>'You will have no claim,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>dir. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> shall lead you well, and the paths

            <p>`<name type="PERSON">Alas</name> for the folly of these <name type="DATE">day</name>s! ' said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. 'Here all are enemies of the <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>

            <p>`<name type="PERSON">Folly</name> it may seem,' said <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>dir. 'Indeed in nothing is the power of the Dark <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd
                more clearly shown than in the estrangement that divides all those who still oppose

                crept northward all about us. Some speak of departing, yet for that it already seems
                too late. The mountains to the west are growing evil; to the east the lands are
                waste, and full of <name type="ORG">Sauron</name>'s creatures; and it is rumoured that we cannot now safely
                pass southward through <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>, and the mouths of the <name type="LOC">Great <name type="LOC">River</name></name> are watched by the
                Enemy. Even if we could come to the shores of the <name type="LOC">Sea</name>, we should find no longer any

                are far north and west, beyond the land of the <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>flings. But where that may be,

            <p>`Not even to see fair <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>thl�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en? ' said <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>dir. 'The world is indeed full of pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>l,
                and in it there are many dark places; but still there is much that is fair, and
                though in all lands love is now mingled with g<name type="GPE">ri</name>ef, it grows perhaps the
                greater.</p>
            <p>`Some there are among us who sing that the <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name> will draw back and peace shall come
                again. Yet I do not believe that the world about us will ever again be as it was of
                old, or the light of the <name type="ORG">Sun</name> as it was aforetime. For the <name type="ORG">Elves</name>, I fear, it will
                prove at best a truce, in which they may pass to the <name type="LOC">Sea</name> unhindered and leave the

                n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> have reported it.'</p>
            <p>As they spoke thus, the <name type="ORG">Company</name> filed slowly along the paths in the wood, led by
                <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>dir, while the other <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name> walked behind. They felt the ground beneath their feet
                smooth and soft, and after a while they walked more freely, without fear of hurt or
                fall. Being dep<name type="GPE">ri</name>ved of sight, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> found his hea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng and other senses sharpened.
                He could smell the trees and the trodden grass. He could hear many different notes
                in the rustle of the leaves overhead, the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver murmu<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng away on his <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght, and the
                thin clear voices of birds in the sky. He felt the sun upon his face and hands when
                they passed through an open glade.</p>
            <p>As soon as he set foot upon the far bank of <name type="ORG">Silverlode</name> a strange feeling had come
                upon him, and it deepened as he walked on into the <name type="NORP">Naith</name>: it seemed to him that he
                had stepped over a b<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge of time into a corner of the <name type="DATE">Elder Days</name>, and was -now
                walking in a world that was no more. In <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name> there was memory of ancient
                things; in L�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en the ancient things still lived on in the waking world. Evil had
                been seen and heard there, sorrow had been known; the <name type="ORG">Elves</name> feared and distrusted
                the world outside: wolves were howling on the wood's borders: but on the land of
                L�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en no shadow lay.</p>
            <p>All that <name type="DATE">day</name> the <name type="ORG">Company</name> <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ched on, until they felt the cool <name type="TIME">evening</name> come and heard
                the <name type="TIME">early <name type="TIME">night</name></name>-wind whispe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng among many leaves. Then they rested and slept
                without fear upon the ground; for their guides would not permit them to unbind their
                eyes, and they could not climb. In the <name type="TIME">morning</name> they went on again, walking without
                haste. At <name type="TIME">noon</name> they halted, and <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> was aware that they had passed out under the
                shining <name type="ORG">Sun</name>. Suddenly he heard the sound of many voices all around him.</p>
            <p>A <name type="PERSON">mar</name><name type="PERSON">chin</name>g host of <name type="ORG">Elves</name> had come up silently: they were has<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing toward the
                northern borders to guard against any attack from <name type="GPE">Mo<name type="GPE">ri</name>a</name>; and they brought news, some
                of which <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>dir reported. The <name type="PERSON">mar</name>auding orcs had been <name type="ORG">waylaid</name> and almost all
                destroyed; the remnant had fled westward towards the mountains, and were being
                pursued. A strange creature also had been seen, running with bent back and with
                hands near the ground, like a beast and yet not of beast-shape. It had eluded
                capture, and they had not shot it, not knowing whether it was good or ill, and it
                had vanished down the <name type="ORG">Silverlode</name> southward.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`A</name>lso,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>dir, `they b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng me a message from the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd and <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> of the
                    <name type="ORG">Galadh<name type="GPE">ri</name>m</name>. You are all to walk free, even the dwarf <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. It seems that the
                    <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> knows who and what is each member of your <name type="ORG">Company</name>. New messages have come
                    from <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name> perhaps.'</q></p>
            <p>He removed the bandage <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> from <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>'s eyes. 'Your par<name type="PERSON">don</name>! ' he said, bowing low.
                `<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok on us now with f<name type="GPE">ri</name>endly eyes! <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok and be glad, for you are the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> dwarf to
                behold the trees of the <name type="NORP">Naith</name> of L�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en since Du<name type="GPE">ri</name>n'<name type="DATE">s Day</name>! '</p>
            <p>When his eyes were in turn uncovered, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> looked up and caught his breath. They
                were standing in an open space. To the left stood a great mound, covered with a
                sward of grass as green as <name type="DATE">Sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng</name>-time in the <name type="DATE">Elder Days</name>. Upon it, as a double
                crown, grew <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> circles of trees: the outer had bark of snowy white, and were
                leafless but beautiful in their shapely nakedness; the inner were mallorn-trees of
                great h<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name>, still arrayed in pale gold. High amid the branches of a towe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng tree
                that stood in the centre of all there gleamed a white flet. At the feet of the
                trees, and all about the green hillsides the grass was studded with small golden
                flowers shaped like stars. Among them, nodding on slender stalks, were other
                flowers, white and palest green: they glimmered as a mist amid the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ch hue of the
                grass. Over all the sky was blue, and the sun of <name type="TIME">after<name type="TIME">noon</name></name> glowed upon the hill and
                cast long green shadows beneath the trees.</p>
            <p><q>'Behold! You are come to Ce<name type="GPE">ri</name>n <name type="PERSON">Amroth</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>dir. `For this is the heart of
                the ancient realm as it was <name type="DATE">long ago</name>, and here is the mound of <name type="PERSON">Amroth</name>, where in
                happier <name type="DATE">day</name>s his high house was built. Here ever bloom <name type="DATE">the <name type="DATE">winter</name></name> flowers in the
                unfading grass: the yellow _elanor_, and the pale _<name type="PERSON">niphredil</name>_. Here we will stay
                awhile, and come to the city of the <name type="ORG">Galadh<name type="GPE">ri</name>m</name> at <name type="TIME">dusk</name>.'</p>
            <p>The others cast themselves down upon the fragrant grass, but <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> stood awhile still
                lost in wonder. It seemed to him that he had stepped through a high window that
                looked on a vanished world. A light was upon it for which his language had no name.
                All that he saw was shapely, but the shapes seemed at once clear cut, as if they had
                been <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> conceived and drawn at the uncove<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng of his eyes, and ancient as if they
                had endured for ever. He saw no colour but those he knew, gold and white and blue
                and green, but they were fresh and poignant, as if he had at that moment <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>
                perceived them and made for them names new and wonderful. In <name type="DATE">winter</name> here no heart
                could mourn for <name type="DATE">summer</name> or for sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng. No blemish or sickness or deformity could be
                seen in anything that grew upon the <name type="LOC">earth</name>. On the land of L�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en there was no
                stain.</p>
            <p>He turned and saw that <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> was now standing beside him, looking round with a puzzled
                expression, and rubbing his eyes as if he was not sure that he was awake. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>t's
                sunlight and b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght <name type="DATE">day</name>, <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght enough,<q>' he said. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> thought that <name type="ORG">Elves</name> were all
                    for moon and stars: but this is more elvish than anything I ever heard tell of.
                    I feel as if I was _inside_ a song. if you take my meaning.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Hal</name>dir looked at them, and he seemed indeed to take the meaning of both thought and
                word. He smiled. `You feel the power of the <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> of the <name type="ORG">Galadh<name type="GPE">ri</name>m</name>,' he said. `Would
                it please you to climb with me up Ce<name type="GPE">ri</name>n <name type="PERSON">Amroth</name>? '</p>
            <p>They followed him as he stepped lightly up the grass-clad slopes. Though he walked
                and breathed, and about him living leaves and flowers were stirred by the same cool
                wind as fanned his face, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> felt that he was in a timeless land that did not fade
                or change or fall into forgetfulness. When he had g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> and passed again into the
                outer world, still <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> the <name type="PERSON">wan</name>derer from the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> would walk there, upon the
                grass among _elanor_ and _<name type="PERSON">niphredil</name>_ in fair <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>thl�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en.</p>
            <p>They entered the circle of white trees. As they did so the <name type="LOC">South</name> Wind blew upon Ce<name type="GPE">ri</name>n
                <name type="PERSON">Amroth</name> and sighed among the branches. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> stood still, hea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng far off_ great seas
                upon beaches that had <name type="DATE">long ago</name> been washed away, and sea-birds crying whose race had
                pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>shed from the <name type="LOC">earth</name>.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Hal</name>dir had g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> on and was now climbing to the high flet. As <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> prepared to follow
                him, he laid his hand upon the tree beside the ladder: never before had he been so
                suddenly and so keenly aware of the feel and texture of a tree's skin and of the
                life within it. He felt a delight in wood and the touch of it, neither as forester
                nor as carpenter; it was the delight of the living tree itself.</p>
            <p>As he stepped out at last upon the lofty platform, <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>dir took his hand and turned
                him toward the <name type="LOC">South</name>. `<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok this way <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>! ' he said.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> looked and saw, still at some distance, a hill of many mighty trees, or a city
                of green towers: which it was he could not tell. Out of it, it seemed to him that
                the power and light came that held all the land in sway. He longed suddenly to fly
                like a bird to rest in the green city. Then he looked eastward and saw all the land
                of L�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en running down to the pale gleam of <name type="GPE">Anduin</name>, the <name type="LOC">Great <name type="LOC">River</name></name>. He lifted his
                eyes across the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver and all the light went out, and he was back again in the world
                he knew. Beyond the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver the land appeared flat and empty, formless and vague,
                until far away it rose again like a wall, dark and drear. The sun that lay on
                <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>thl�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en had no power to enligh<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> the shadow of that distant h<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name>.</p>
            <p>`There lies the fastness of <name type="LOC">South</name>ern <name type="GPE">Mirkwood</name>,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>dir. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>t is clad in a
                    forest of dark fir, where the trees st<name type="GPE">ri</name>ve <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> against another and their
                    branches rot and wither. In the midst upon a stony h<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name> stands <name type="PERSON">Dol Guldur</name>,
                    where long the hidden Enemy had his dwelling. We fear that now it is inhabited
                    again, and with power <name type="CARDINAL">seven</name>fold. A black cloud lies of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> over it of late. In
                    this high place you may see the <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> powers that are opposed <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> to another; and
                    ever they st<name type="GPE">ri</name>ve now in thought, but whereas the light perceives the very heart
                    of the darkness, its own <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret has not been discovered. Not yet.'</q> He turned
                and climbed swiftly down, and they followed him.</p>
            <p>At the hill's foot <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> found <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>, standing still and silent as a tree; but in
                his hand was a small golden bloom of elanor, and a light was in his eyes. He was
                wrapped in some fair memory: and as <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> looked at him he knew that he beheld
                things as they once had been in this same place. For the g<name type="GPE">ri</name>m <name type="DATE">year</name>s were removed
                from the face of <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>, and he seemed clothed in white, a young lord tall and
                fair; and he spoke words in the <name type="PERSON">Elvish</name> tongue to <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> whom <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> could not see_.
                <name type="PERSON">Arwen</name> vanimelda, <name type="PERSON">nam�<name type="GPE">ri</name>�</name>!_ he said, and then he drew a breath, and returning out of
                his thought he looked at <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and smiled.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`He</name>re is the heart of <name type="ORG">Elven</name>dom on <name type="LOC">earth</name>,' he said, `and here my heart dwells ever,
                unless there be a light beyond the dark roads that we still must tread, you and I.
                Come with me! ' And taking <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s hand in his, he left the hill of Ce<name type="GPE">ri</name>n <name type="PERSON">Amroth</name> and
                came there never again as living man.</p>

            <p>The sun was sinking behind the mountains, and the shadows were deepening in the
                woods, when they went on again. Their paths now went into thickets where the <name type="TIME">dusk</name>
                had already gathered. Night came beneath the trees as they walked, and the <name type="ORG">Elves</name>
                uncovered their silver lamps.</p>
            <p>Suddenly they came out into the open again and found themselves under a pale <name type="TIME">evening</name>
                sky p<name type="GPE">ri</name>cked by a few early stars. There was a wide treeless space before them,
                running in a great circle and bending away on either hand. Beyond it was a deep
                fosse lost in soft shadow, but the grass upon its b<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk was green, as if it glowed
                still in memory of the sun that had g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. Upon the further side there rose to a
                great h<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name> a green wall encircling a green hill thronged with mallorn-trees taller
                than any they had yet seen in all the land. Their h<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name> could not be guessed, but
                they stood up in the <name type="TIME">twilight</name> like living towers. In their, many-tiered branches and
                amid their ever-moving leaves countless lights were gleaming, green and gold and
                silver. <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>dir turned towards the <name type="ORG">Company</name>.</p>
            <p>`Welcome to <name type="ORG">Caras Galadhon</name>! <q>' he said. 'Here is the city of the <name type="ORG">Galadh<name type="GPE">ri</name>m</name> where
                    dwell the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd <name type="EVENT">Celeborn</name> and <name type="PERSON">Galad<name type="GPE">ri</name>el</name> the <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> of L�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en. But we cannot enter
                    here, for the gates do not look northward. We must go round to the southern
                    side, and the way is not short, for the city is great.'</q></p>
            <p>There was a road paved with white st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> running on the outer b<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk of the fosse.
                Along this they went westward, with the city ever climbing up like a green cloud
                upon their left; and as the <name type="TIME">night</name> deepened more lights sprang forth, until all the
                <name type="ORG">hill s</name>eemed afire with stars. They came at last to a white b<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge, and crossing
                found the great gates of the city: they faced south-west, set between the ends of
                the encircling wall that here overlapped, and they were tall and strong, and hung
                with many lamps.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Hal</name>dir knocked and spoke, and the gates opened soundlessly; but of guards <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> could
                see no sign. The travellers passed within, and the gates shut behind them. They were
                in a deep lane between the ends of the wall, and passing quickly through it they
                entered the <name type="LOC">City</name> of the <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>s. No folk could they see, nor hear any feet upon the
                paths; but there were many voices, about them, and in the air above. <name type="LOC">Far</name> away up on
                the hill they could hear the sound of singing falling from on high like soft rain
                upon leaves.</p>
            <p>They went along many paths and climbed many stairs, until they came to the high
                places and saw before them amid a wide lawn a fountain shimme<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng. It was lit by
                silver lamps that swung from the boughs of trees, and it fell into a basin of
                silver, from which a white stream spilled. Upon the south side of the lawn there
                stood the mightiest of all the trees; its great smooth bole gleamed like grey silk,
                and up it towered, until its <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> branches, far above, opened their huge limbs
                under shadowy clouds of leaves. Beside it a broad white ladder stood, and at its
                foot <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> <name type="ORG">Elves</name> were seated. They sprang up as the travellers approached, and <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>
                saw that they were tall and clad in grey mail, and from their shoulders hung long
                white cloaks.</p>
            <p><q>'Here dwell <name type="EVENT">Celeborn</name> and <name type="PERSON">Galad<name type="GPE">ri</name>el</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>dir. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>t is their wish that you
                should ascend and speak with them.'</p>
            <p><name type="CARDINAL">One</name> of the <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name>-wardens then blew a clear note on a small horn, and it was answered
                <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> times from far above. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> will go <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>dir. 'Let <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> come next
                    and with him <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. The others may follow as they wish. It is a long climb for
                    those that are not accus<name type="PERSON">tom</name>ed to such stairs, but you may rest upon the
                    way.'</q></p>
            <p>As he climbed slowly up <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> passed many flets: some on <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> side, some on another,
                and some set about the bole of the tree, so that the ladder passed through them. At
                a great h<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name> above the ground he came to a wide _talan_, like the deck of a great
                ship. On it was built a house, so large that almost it would have served for a hall
                of <name type="ORG">Men</name> upon the <name type="LOC">earth</name>. He entered behind <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>dir, and found that he was in a chamber
                of oval shape, in the midst of which grew the trunk of the great mallorn, now
                tape<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng towards its crown, and yet making still a pillar of wide girth.</p>
            <p>The chamber was filled with a soft light; its walls were green and silver and its
                roof of gold. Many <name type="ORG">Elves</name> were seated there. On <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>rs beneath the bole of the
                tree and canopied by a living bough there sat, side by side, <name type="EVENT">Celeborn</name> and <name type="PERSON">Galad<name type="GPE">ri</name>el</name>.
                They stood <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name> greet their guests, after the manner of <name type="ORG">Elves</name>, even those who were
                accounted mighty kings. Very tall they were, and the <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> no less tall than the
                <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd; and they were grave and beautiful. They were clad wholly in white; and the
                <name type="PERSON">hai</name>r of the <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> was of deep gold, and the <name type="PERSON">hai</name>r of the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd <name type="EVENT">Celeborn</name> was of silver
                long and b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght; but no sign of age was upon them, unless it were in the depths of
                their eyes; for these were keen as lances in the starlight, and yet profound, the
                wells of deep memory.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Hal</name>dir led <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> before them, and the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd welcomed him in his own tongue. The <name type="PERSON">Lady</name>
                <name type="PERSON">Galad<name type="GPE">ri</name>el</name> said no word but looked long upon his face.</p>
            <p>`Sit now beside my c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>r, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> of the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>! <q>' said <name type="EVENT">Celeborn</name>. `When all have come
                    we will speak together.'</q></p>
            <p>Each of the companions he greeted courteously by name as they entered. `Welcome
                <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> son of <name type="ORG">Arathorn</name>! ' he said. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>t is <name type="CARDINAL">eight</name> and <name type="CARDINAL">thirty</name> <name type="DATE">year</name>s of the world
                outside since you came to this land; and <name type="DATE">those <name type="DATE">year</name>s</name> lie heavy on you. But the end
                is near, for good or ill. Here lay aside your burden for a while! '</p>
            <p>
                <q>'Welcome son of <name type="PERSON">Thr</name>anduil! Too seldom do my kindred journey hither from the
                    <name type="LOC">North</name>.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>`Welcome <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> son of <name type="PRODUCT">Gl�</name>in! It is long indeed since we saw <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of Du<name type="GPE">ri</name>n's folk in
                <name type="ORG">Caras Galadhon</name>. But to<name type="DATE">day</name> we have broken our long law. <name type="DATE">May</name> it be a sign that though
                the world is now dark better <name type="DATE">day</name>s are at hand, and that f<name type="GPE">ri</name>endship shall be renewed
                between our peoples.' <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> bowed low.</p>
            <p>When all the guests were seated before his c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>r the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd looked at them again.
                    <q>'Here there are <name type="CARDINAL">eight</name>,'</q> he said. `<name type="CARDINAL">Nine</name> were to set out: so said the
                messages. But maybe there has been some change of counsel that we have not heard.
                <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name> is far away, and darkness gathers between us, and all <name type="DATE">this <name type="DATE">year</name></name> the shadows
                have grown longer.'</p>
            <p>`<name type="PERSON">Nay</name>, there was no change of counsel,<q>' said the <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> <name type="PERSON">Galad<name type="GPE">ri</name>el</name> speaking for the
                    <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> time. Her voice was clear and musical, but deeper than woman's wont.
                    `<name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> the <name type="ORG">Grey</name> set out with the <name type="ORG">Company</name>, but he did not pass the borders of
                    this land. Now tell us where he is; for I much desired to speak with him again.
                    But I cannot see him from afar, unless he comes within the <name type="PERSON">fen</name>ces of <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>thl�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en:
                    a grey mist is about him, and the ways of his feet and of his mind are hidden
                    from me.'</q></p>
            <p>
                <q>'<name type="PERSON">Alas</name>! ' said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. `<name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> the <name type="ORG">Grey</name> fell into shadow. He remained in <name type="GPE">Mo<name type="GPE">ri</name>a</name>
                    and did not escape.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>At these words all the <name type="ORG">Elves</name> in the hall c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed aloud in g<name type="GPE">ri</name>ef and amazement. `These
                are evil tidings,<q>' said <name type="EVENT">Celeborn</name>, `the most evil that have been spoken here in
                    <name type="DATE">long <name type="DATE">year</name>s</name> full of g<name type="GPE">ri</name>evous deeds.'</q> He turned to <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>dir. `Why has nothing of
                this been told to me before? ' he asked in the <name type="ORG">Elven</name>-tongue.</p>
            <p><q>'We have not spoken to <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>dir of our deeds or our purpose,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. <name type="PERSON">`A</name>t

            <p><name type="PERSON">`Yet</name> our g<name type="GPE">ri</name>ef is great and our loss cannot be mended,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. '<name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> was

                    he saved us, and he fell.'</q></p>
            <p>'Tell us now the full tale! ' said <name type="EVENT">Celeborn</name>:</p>
            <p>Then <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> recounted all that had happened upon the pass of <name type="GPE">Caradhras</name>, and in the
                <name type="DATE">day</name>s that followed; and he spoke of <name type="PERSON">Balin</name> and his book, and the fight in the Chamber
                of <name type="PERSON">Mazarbul</name>, and the fire, and the narrow b<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge, and the coming of the Terror.
                    <q>'An evil of <name type="EVENT">the Ancient World</name> it seemed, such as I have never seen
                    before,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>t was both a shadow and a flame, strong and

            <p><name type="PERSON">`I</name>ndeed I saw upon the b<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge that which haunts our darkest dreams I saw Du<name type="GPE">ri</name>n's

            <p>
                <q>'<name type="PERSON">Alas</name>! ' said <name type="EVENT">Celeborn</name>. `We long have feared that under <name type="GPE">Caradhras</name> a terror slept.
                    But had I known that the <name type="ORG">Dwarves</name> had stirred up this evil in <name type="GPE">Mo<name type="GPE">ri</name>a</name> again, I
                    would have forbidden you to pass the northern borders, you and all that went
                    with you. And if it were possible, <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> would say that at the last <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> fell
                    from wisdom into folly, going needlessly into the net of <name type="GPE">Mo<name type="GPE">ri</name>a</name>.'</q>
            </p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`He</name> would be rash indeed that said that thing,' said <name type="PERSON">Galad<name type="GPE">ri</name>el</name> gravely. `Needless
                were n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the deeds of <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> in life. Those that followed him knew not his mind
                and cannot report his full purpose. But however it may be with the guide, the

            <p><q>'Dark is the water of Kheled-z�ram, and cold are the sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ngs of <name type="GPE">Kibil-n</name>�la, and

                and sad, and she smiled. And the <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Dwarf</name>, hea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng the names given in his own ancient
                tongue, looked up and met her eyes; and it seemed to him that he looked suddenly
                into the heart of an enemy and saw there love and understanding. Wonder came into
                his face, and then he smiled in answer.</p>
            <p>He rose clumsily and bowed in dwarf-fashion, saying: <name type="PERSON">`Yet</name> more fair is the living

            <p>There was a silence. At length <name type="EVENT">Celeborn</name> spoke again. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> did not know that your plight

            <p><q>'Your quest is known to us,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Galad<name type="GPE">ri</name>el</name>, looking at <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. `But we will
                not here speak of it more openly. Yet not in vain will it prove, maybe, that you

                    would have g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> otherwise. But even now there is hope left. I will not give you

                    was and is, and in part also what shall be. But this I will say to you: your
                    <name type="PRODUCT">Quest</name> stands upon the edge of a knife. Stray but a little and it will fail, to

            </p>
            <p>And with that word she held them with her eyes, and in silence looked sear<name type="PERSON">chin</name>gly at
                each of them in turn. N<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> save <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> and <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> could long endure her glance.
                <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> quickly blushed and hung his head.</p>
            <p>At length the <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> <name type="PERSON">Galad<name type="GPE">ri</name>el</name> released them from her eyes, and she smiled. <name type="PERSON">`Do</name> not let

                they sighed and felt suddenly weary, as those who have been questi<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>d long and

            <p><name type="ORG">`Go</name> now! <q>' said <name type="EVENT">Celeborn</name>. `You are worn with sorrow and much toil. Even if your

            <p><name type="TIME">That <name type="TIME">night</name></name> the <name type="ORG">Company</name> slept upon the ground, much to the satisfaction of the
                hobbits. The <name type="ORG">Elves</name> spread for them a pavilion among the trees near the fountain, and
                in it they laid soft couches; then speaking words of peace with fair elvish voices
                they left them. For a little while the travellers talked of their <name type="TIME">night</name> before in
                the tree-tops, and of their <name type="DATE">day</name>'s journey, and of the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd and <name type="PERSON">Lady</name>; for they had
                not yet the heart to look further back.</p>
            <p>`What did you blush for, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>? <q>' said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. `You soon broke down. Any<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> would
                    have thought you had a guilty conscience. I hope it was nothing worse than a
                    wicked plot to steal <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of my blankets.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`I</name> never thought no such thing,<q>' answered <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, in no mood for jest. 'If you <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t
                    to know, I felt as if I hadn't got nothing on, and I didn't like it. She seemed
                    to be looking inside me and asking me what I would do if she gave me the chance
                    of flying back home to the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> to a nice little hole with-with a bit of garden
                    of my own.'</q></p>
            <p>`That's funny,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. 'Almost exactly what I felt myself; only, only well, I
                    <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t think I'II say any more,'</q> he ended lamely.</p>
            <p>All of them, it seemed, had fared alike: each had felt that he was offered a choice
                between a shadow full of fear that lay ahead, and something that he greatly desired:
                clear before his mind it lay, and to get it he had only to turn aside from the road
                and leave the <name type="PRODUCT">Quest</name> and the war against <name type="ORG">Sauron</name> to others.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`A</name>nd it seemed to me, too,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>, `that my choice would remain <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret and
                    known only to myself.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'To me it seemed exceedingly strange,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>. `<name type="DATE">May</name>be it was only a
                test, and she thought to read our thoughts for her own good purpose; but almost I
                should have said that she was tempting us, and offe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng what she pre<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ded to have
                the power to give. It need not be said that I refused to lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>. The <name type="ORG">Men</name> of Minas
                <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name> are true to their word.' But what he thought that the <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> had offered him
                <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> did not tell.</p>
            <p>And as for <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, he would not speak, though <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> pressed him with questions. `She
                held you long in her gaze, <name type="ORG">Ring</name>-bearer,' he said.</p>
            <p>`Yes,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>; `but whatever came into my mind then I will keep
                there.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="ORG">`Well</name>, have a care! <q>' said <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> do not feel too sure of this <name type="PERSON">Elvish</name> <name type="PERSON">Lady</name>
                    and her purposes.'</q></p>
            <p>`Speak no evil of the <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> <name type="PERSON">Galad<name type="GPE">ri</name>el</name>! <q>' said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> sternly. 'You know not what
                    you say. There is in her and in this land no evil, unless a man b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng it hither
                    himself. Then let him beware! But to<name type="TIME">night</name> I shall sleep without fear for the
                    <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> time since I left <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name>. And may I sleep deep, and forget for a while
                    my g<name type="GPE">ri</name>ef! I am weary in body and in heart.'</q> He cast himself down upon his
                couch and fell at once into a long sleep.</p>
            <p>The others soon did the same, and no sound or dream disturbed their slumber. When
                they woke they found that the light of <name type="DATE">day</name> was broad upon the lawn before the
                pavilion. and the fountain rose and fell glitte<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng in the sun.</p>
            <p>They remained some <name type="DATE">day</name>s in <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>thl�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en, so far as they could tell or remember. All the
                while that they dwelt there the sun sh<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> clear, save for a gentle rain that fell at
                times, and passed away leaving all things fresh and clean. The air was cool and
                soft, as if it were <name type="DATE">early sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng</name>, yet they felt about them the deep and thoughtful
                quiet of <name type="DATE">winter</name>. It seemed to them that they did little but eat and d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk and rest,
                and walk among the trees; and it was enough.</p>
            <p>They had not seen the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd and <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> again, and they had little speech with the
                <name type="ORG">Elven</name>-folk; for few of these knew or would use the <name type="LOC">West</name>ron tongue. <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>dir had bidden
                them farewell and g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> back again to the <name type="PERSON">fen</name>ces of the <name type="LOC">North</name>, where great watch was
                now kept since the tidings of <name type="GPE">Mo<name type="GPE">ri</name>a</name> that the <name type="ORG">Company</name> had brought. <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> was away
                much among the <name type="ORG">Galadh<name type="GPE">ri</name>m</name>, and after the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> <name type="TIME">night</name> he did not sleep with the other
                companions, though he returned to eat and talk with them. Of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> he took <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> with
                him when he went abroad in the land, and the others wondered at this change.</p>
            <p>Now as the companions sat or walked together they spoke of <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, and all that each
                had known and seen of him came clear before their minds. As they were healed of hurt
                and wea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ness of body the g<name type="GPE">ri</name>ef of their loss grew more keen. Of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> they heard
                nearby <name type="PERSON">Elvish</name> voices singing, and knew that they were making songs of lamentation
                for his fall, for they caught his name among the sweet sad words that they could not
                understand.</p>
            <p>_<name type="LOC">Mithrandir</name>, <name type="LOC">Mithrandir</name>_ sang the <name type="ORG">Elves</name>, _O Pilg<name type="GPE">ri</name>m <name type="ORG">Grey</name>!_For so they loved to call
                him. But if <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> was with the <name type="ORG">Company</name>, he would not interpret the songs for them,
                saying that he had not the skill, and that for him the g<name type="GPE">ri</name>ef was still too near, a
                matter for tears and not yet for song.</p>
            <p>It was <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> who <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> put something of his sorrow into halting words. He was seldom
                moved to make song or rhyme; even in <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name> he had lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed and had not sung
                himself, though his memory was stored with many things that others had made before
                him. But now as he sat beside the fountain in L�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en and heard about him the voices
                of the <name type="ORG">Elves</name>, his thought took shape in a song that seemed fair to him; yet when he
                t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed to repeat it to <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> only snatches remained, faded as a handful of withered
                leaves.</p>
            <p>When <name type="TIME">evening</name> in the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> was grey</p>
            <p>his footsteps on the <name type="ORG">Hill</name> were heard;</p>
            <p>before the <name type="TIME">dawn</name> he went away</p>
            <p>on journey long without a word.</p>
            <p>From <name type="PERSON">Wilderland</name> to <name type="LOC">West</name>ern shore,</p>
            <p>from northern waste to <name type="LOC">southern hill</name>,</p>
            <p>through dragon-lair and hidden door</p>
            <p>and darkling woods he walked at will.</p>
            <p>With <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Dwarf</name> and <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbit, <name type="ORG">Elves</name> and <name type="ORG">Men</name>,</p>
            <p>with mortal and immortal folk,</p>
            <p>with bird on bough and beast in den,</p>
            <p>in their own <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret tongues he spoke.</p>
            <p>A deadly sword, a healing hand,</p>
            <p>a back that bent beneath its load;</p>
            <p>a trumpet-voice, a burning brand,</p>
            <p>a weary <name type="ORG">pilg<name type="GPE">ri</name>m</name> on the road.</p>
            <p>A lord of wisdom thr<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>d he sat,</p>
            <p>swift in anger, quick to laugh;</p>
            <p>an old man in a battered hat</p>
            <p>who leaned upon a thorny staff.</p>
            <p>He stood upon the b<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name></p>
            <p>and <name type="ORG">Fire</name> and <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name> both defied;</p>
            <p>his staff was broken on the st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>,</p>
            <p>in <name type="GPE">Khaz</name>ad-d�m his wisdom died.</p>
            <p>`Why, you'll be beating Mr. <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> next! ' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>.</p>
            <p><q>'No, I am afraid not,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'But that is the best I can do
                yet.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Well, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, if you do have another go, I hope you'll say a word about his
                    fireworks,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. `Something like this:</p>
            <p>The finest rockets ever seen:</p>
            <p>they burst in stars of blue and green,</p>
            <p>or after thunder golden showers</p>
            <p>came falling like a rain of flowers.</p>
            <p>Though that doesn't do them justice by a long road.'</p>
            <p>`No, I'll leave that to you, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. Or perhaps to <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>. But-well. I can't talk of it
                any more. I can't bear to think of b<name type="GPE">ri</name>nging the news to him.'</p>
            <p><name type="CARDINAL">One</name> <name type="TIME">evening</name> <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> were walking together in the cool <name type="TIME">twilight</name>. Both of them
                felt restless again. On <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> suddenly the shadow of parting had fallen: he knew
                somehow that the time was very near when he must leave <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>thl�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en.</p>
            <p>`What do you think of <name type="ORG">Elves</name> now, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>? <q>' he said. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> asked you the same question
                    once before-it seems a very long while ago; but you have seen more of them since
                    then.'</q></p>
            <p>
                <q>'I have indeed! ' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. 'And I reckon there's <name type="ORG">Elves</name> and <name type="ORG">Elves</name>. They're all
                    elvish enough, but they're not all the same. Now these folk aren't <name type="PERSON">wan</name>derers or
                    homeless, and seem a bit nearer to the likes of us: they seem to belong here,
                    more even than <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbits do in the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>. Whether they've made the land, or the
                    land's made them, it's hard to say, if you take my meaning. It's wonderfully
                    quiet here. Nothing seems to be going on, and nobody seems to <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t it to. If
                    there's any magic about, it's <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght down deep, where I can't lay my hands on it,
                    in a manner of speaking.'</q>
            </p>
            <p><q>'You can see and feel it everywhere,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.</p>
            <p><q>'Well,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, 'you can't see nobody working it. No fireworks like poor
                <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> used to show. I wonder we <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t see nothing of the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd and <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> in all
                these <name type="DATE">day</name>s. I fancy now that _she_ could do some wonderful things, if she had a
                mind. I'd dearly love to see some <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name>-magic, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>! '</p>
            <p><q>'I wouldn't,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> am con<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>t. And I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t miss <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>'s fireworks,
                but his <name type="PERSON">bush</name>y eyebrows, and his quick temper, and his voice.'</p>
            <p>`You're <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght,' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <name type="PERSON">`A</name>nd <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t think I'm finding fault. I've of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ted to
                see a bit of magic like what it tells of in old tales, but I've never heard of a
                better land than this. It's like being at home and on <name type="DATE">a holi<name type="DATE">day</name></name> at the same time, if
                you understand me. I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t to leave. All the same, I'm beginning to feel that
                if we've got to go on, then we'd best get it over.</p>
            <p>
                <q>'_It's the job that's never started as takes longest to finish_, as my old gaffer
                    used to say. And I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t reckon that these folk can do much more to help us,
                    magic or no. It's when we leave this land that we shall miss <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> worse, I'm
                    thinking.'</q>
            </p>
            <p><q>'I am afraid that's only too true, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <name type="PERSON">`Yet</name> I hope very much
                that before we leave we shall see the <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> of the <name type="ORG">Elves</name> again.'</p>
            <p>Even as he spoke, they saw, as if she came in answer to their words, the <name type="PERSON">Lady</name>
                <name type="PERSON">Galad<name type="GPE">ri</name>el</name> approa<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g. Tall and white and fair she walked beneath the trees. She
                spoke no word, but beck<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>d to them.</p>
            <p>Turning aside, she led them toward the southern slopes of the hill of <name type="ORG">Caras Galadhon</name>,
                and passing through a high green hedge they came into an enclosed garden. No trees
                grew there, and it lay open to the sky. The <name type="TIME">evening</name> star had <name type="GPE">ri</name>sen and was shining
                with white fire above the western woods. Down a long flight of steps the <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> went
                into a deep green hollow, through which ran murmu<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng the silver stream that issued
                from the fountain on the hill. At the bot<name type="PERSON">tom</name>, upon a low pedestal carved like a
                bran<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g tree, stood a basin of silver. wide and shallow, and beside it stood a
                silver ewer.</p>
            <p>With water from the stream <name type="PERSON">Galad<name type="GPE">ri</name>el</name> filled the basin to the b<name type="GPE">ri</name>m, and breathed on
                it, and when the water was still again she spoke. <name type="PERSON">`He</name>re is the <name type="ORG">Mirror</name> of
                    <name type="PERSON">Galad<name type="GPE">ri</name>el</name>,<q>' she said. 'I have brought you here so that you may look in it, if
                    you will.'</q></p>
            <p>The air was very still, and the <name type="ORG">dell</name> was dark, and the <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name>-lady beside him was tall
                and pale. 'What shall we look for, and what shall we see? ' asked <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, filled with
                awe.</p>
            <p>`Many things I can command the <name type="ORG">Mirror</name> to reveal,' she answered, `and to some I can
                show what they desire to see. But the <name type="ORG">Mirror</name> will also show things unbidden, and
                those are of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> stranger and more profitable than things which we wish to behold.
                What you will see, if you leave the <name type="ORG">Mirror</name> free to work, I cannot tell. For it shows
                things that were, and things that are, things that yet may be. But which it is that
                he sees, even the wisest cannot always tell. Do you wish to look? '</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> did not answer.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`A</name>nd you? ' she said, turning to <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. 'For this is what your folk would call magic. I
                believe; though I do not understand clearly what they mean; and they seem also to
                use the same word of the deceits of the Enemy. But this, if you will, is the magic
                of <name type="PERSON">Galad<name type="GPE">ri</name>el</name>. Did you not say that you wished to see <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name>-magic? '</p>
            <p><q>'I did,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, trembling a little between fear and cu<name type="GPE">ri</name>osity. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>'ll have a

            <p><name type="PERSON">`A</name>nd I'd not mind a glimpse of what's going on at home,<q>' he said in an aside to
                    <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. 'It seems a ter<name type="GPE">ri</name>ble long time that I've been away. But there, like as
                    not I'll only see the stars, or something that I won't understand.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Like as not,'</q> said the <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> with a gentle laugh. `But come, you shall look
                and see what you may. Do not touch the water! '</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> climbed up on the foot of the pedestal and leaned over the basin. The water
                looked hard and dark. <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Stars</name> were reflected in it.</p>
            <p>`There's only stars, as I thought,' he said. Then he gave a low gasp, for the stars
                went out. As if a dark veil had been withdrawn, the <name type="ORG">Mirror</name> grew grey, and then
                clear. There was sun shining, and the branches of trees were waving and tossing in
                the wind. But before <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> could make up his mind what it was that he saw, the light
                faded; and now he thought he saw <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> with a pale face lying fast asleep under a
                great dark cliff. Then he seemed to see himself going along a dim passage, and
                climbing an endless winding stair. It came to him suddenly that he was looking
                urgently for something, but what it was he did not know. Like a dream the vision
                shifted and went back, and he saw the trees again. But this time they were not so
                close, and he could see what was going on: they were not waving in the wind, they
                were falling, crashing to the ground.</p>
            <p>`Hi!<q>' c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> in an outraged voice. 'There's that <name type="PERSON">Ted</name> <name type="PERSON">Sandyman</name> a-cutting down
                    trees as he shouldn't. They didn't ought to be felled: it's that avenue beyond
                    the Mill that shades the road to <name type="PERSON">Bywater</name>. I wish I could get at <name type="PERSON">Ted</name>, and I'd
                    fell _him_!'</q></p>
            <p>But now <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> noticed that <name type="FAC">the Old Mill</name> had vanished, and a large red-b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ck building
                was being put up where it had stood. <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ts of folk were busily at work. There was a
                tall red chimney nearby. <name type="ORG">Black</name> smoke seemed to cloud the surface of the <name type="ORG">Mirror</name>.</p>
            <p><q>'There's some devilry at work in the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>,'</q> he said. <q>'<name type="PERSON">Elrond</name> knew what he
                    was about when he <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ted to send Mr. <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> back.'</q> Then suddenly <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> gave a
                cry and sprang away. <q>'I can't stay here,'</q> he said wildly. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> must go home.
                They've dug up <name type="ORG">Bagshot Row</name>, and there's the poor old gaffer going down the <name type="ORG">Hill</name> with
                his bits of things on a barrow. I must go home! '</p>
            <p><q>'You cannot go home al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>,'</q> said the <name type="PERSON">Lady</name>. <q>'You did not wish to go home
                    without your master before you looked in the <name type="ORG">Mirror</name>, and yet you knew that evil
                    things might well be happening in the <name type="LOC">Shire</name>. Remember that the <name type="ORG">Mirror</name> shows many
                    things, and not all have yet come to pass. Some never come to be, unless those
                    that behold the visions turn aside from their path to prevent them. The <name type="ORG">Mirror</name>
                    is dangerous as a guide of deeds.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> sat on the ground and put his head in his hands. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> wish I had never come here,
                and I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t to see no more magic,<q>' he said and fell silent. After a moment
                    he spoke again thickly, as if struggling with tears. `No, I'll go home by the
                    long road with Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, or not at all,'</q> he said. `But I hope I do get back
                some <name type="DATE">day</name>. If what I've seen turns out true, somebody's going to catch it hot! '</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`Do</name> you now wish to look, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>? <q>' said the <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> <name type="PERSON">Galad<name type="GPE">ri</name>el</name>. `You did not wish to
                    see <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name>-magic and were con<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>t.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`Do</name> you advise me to look? ' asked <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.</p>
            <p><q>'No,'</q> she said. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> do not counsel you <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> way or the other. I am not a
                counsellor. You may learn something, and whether what you see be fair or evil, that
                may be profitable, and yet it may not. Seeing is both good and pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>lous. Yet I
                think, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, that you have courage and wisdom enough for the venture, or I would
                not have brought you here. Do as you will! '</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`I</name> will look,' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, and he climbed on the pedestal and bent over the dark
                water. At once the <name type="ORG">Mirror</name> cleared and he saw a twilit land. <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s loomed dark in
                the distance against a pale sky. A long grey road wound back out of sight. <name type="LOC">Far</name> away
                a figure came slowly down the road, faint and small at <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>, but growing larger and
                clearer as it approached. Suddenly <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> realized that it reminded him of <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>.
                He almost called aloud the wizard's name, and then he saw that the figure was
                clothed not in grey but in white, in a white that sh<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> faintly in the <name type="TIME">dusk</name>; and in
                its hand there was a white staff. The head was so bowed that he could see no face,
                and presently the figure turned aside round a bend in the road and went out of the
                <name type="ORG">Mirror</name>'s view. Doubt came into <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s mind: was this a vision of <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> on <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of
                his many l<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>ly journeys <name type="DATE">long ago</name>, or was it <name type="PERSON">Saruman</name>?</p>
            <p>The vision now changed. B<name type="GPE">ri</name>ef and small but very vivid he caught a glimpse of <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>
                walking restlessly about his room. The table was littered with disordered papers;
                rain was beating on the windows.</p>
            <p>Then there was a pause, and after it many swift scenes followed that <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> in some
                way knew to be parts of a great history in which he had become involved. The mist
                cleared and he saw a sight which he had never seen before but knew at once: the <name type="LOC">Sea</name>.
                <name type="PRODUCT">Darkness</name> fell. The sea rose and raged in a great storm. Then he saw against the <name type="ORG">Sun</name>,
                sinking blood-red into a wrack of clouds, the black outline of a tall ship with torn
                sails <name type="GPE">ri</name>ding up out of the <name type="LOC">West</name>. Then a wide <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver flowing through a populous city.
                Then a white fortress with <name type="CARDINAL">seven</name> towers. And then again a ship with black sails, but
                now it was <name type="TIME">morning</name> again, and the water <name type="GPE">ri</name>ppled with light, and a banner bea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng the
                emblem of a white tree sh<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> in the sun. A smoke as of fire and battle arose, and
                again the sun went down in a burning red that faded into a grey mist; and into the
                mist a small ship passed away, twinkling with lights. It vanished, and <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> sighed
                and prepared to draw away.</p>
            <p>But suddenly the <name type="ORG">Mirror</name> went altogether dark, as dark as if a hole had opened in the
                world of sight, and <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> looked into emptiness. In the black abyss there appeared a
                single <name type="PRODUCT">Eye</name> that slowly grew. until it filled nearly all the <name type="ORG">Mirror</name>. So ter<name type="GPE">ri</name>ble was
                it that <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> stood rooted, unable to cry out or to withdraw his gaze. The <name type="PRODUCT">Eye</name> was
                <name type="GPE">ri</name>mmed with fire, but was itself glazed, yellow as a cat's, watchful and in<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>t, and
                the black slit of its pupil opened on a pit, a window into nothing.</p>
            <p>Then the <name type="PRODUCT">Eye</name> began to rove, sear<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g this way and that; and <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> knew with
                certainty and horror that among the many things that it sought he himself was <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>.
                But he also knew that it could not see him-not yet, not unless he willed it. The
                <name type="ORG">Ring</name> that hung upon its c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>n about his neck grew heavy, heavier than a great st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>,
                and his head was dragged downwards. The <name type="ORG">Mirror</name> seemed to be growing hot and curls of
                steam were <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing from the water. He was slipping forward.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`Do</name> not touch the water!' said the <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> <name type="PERSON">Galad<name type="GPE">ri</name>el</name> softly. The vision faded, and <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>
                found that he was looking at the cool stars twinkling in the silver basin. He
                stepped back shaking all over and looked at the <name type="PERSON">Lady</name>.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`I</name> know what it was that you last saw,' she said; `for that is also in my mind. Do
                not be afraid! But do not think that only by singing amid the trees, nor even by the
                slender arrows of <name type="ORG">elven</name>-bows, is this land of <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>thl�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en maintained and de<name type="PERSON">fen</name>ded
                against its Enemy. I say to you, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, that even as I speak to you, I perceive the
                Dark <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd and know his mind, or all of his mind that concerns the <name type="ORG">Elves</name>. And he
                gropes ever to see me and my thought. But still the door is closed! '</p>
            <p>She lifted up her white arms, and spread out her hands towards the <name type="LOC">East</name> in a gesture
                of rejection and denial. E�rendil, <name type="ORG">the Evening Star</name>, most beloved of the <name type="ORG">Elves</name>,
                sh<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> clear above. So b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght was it that the figure of the <name type="ORG">Elven</name>-lady cast a dim
                shadow on the ground. Its rays glanced upon a <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng about her finger; it glittered
                like polished gold overlaid with silver light, and a white st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> in it twinkled as
                if the Even-star had come down to rest upon her hand. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> gazed at the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng with
                awe; for suddenly it seemed to him that he understood.</p>
            <p>`Yes,' she said, divining his thought, `it is not permitted to speak of it, and
                <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name> could not do so. But it cannot be hidden from the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>-bearer, and <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> who
                has seen the <name type="PRODUCT">Eye</name>. Ve<name type="GPE">ri</name>ly it is in the land of L�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en upon the finger of <name type="PERSON">Galad<name type="GPE">ri</name>el</name>
                that <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the <name type="PERSON">Thr</name>ee remains. This is <name type="PERSON">Nenya</name>, the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> of Adamant, and I am its
                keeper.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`He</name> suspects, but he does not know � not yet. Do you not see now wherefore your
                coming is to us as the footstep of Doom? For if you fail, then we are laid bare to
                the Enemy. Yet if you succeed, then our power is diminished, and <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>thl�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en will
                fade, and the tides of <name type="PERSON">Tim</name>e will sweep it away. We must depart into the <name type="LOC">West</name>, or
                dwindle to a rustic folk of <name type="ORG">dell</name> and cave, slowly to forget and to be
                forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>.'</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> bent his head. <name type="PERSON">`A</name>nd what do you wish? ' he said at last.</p>
            <p>`That what should be shall be,<q>' she answered. `The love of the <name type="ORG">Elves</name> for their
                    land and their works is deeper than the deeps of the <name type="LOC">Sea</name>, and their regret is
                    undying and cannot ever wholly be assuaged. Yet they will cast all away rather
                    than submit to <name type="ORG">Sauron</name>: for they know him now. For the fate of <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>thl�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en you are
                    not answerable but only for the doing of your own task. Yet I could wish, were
                    it of any avail, that the <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> <name type="ORG">Ring</name> had never been wrought, or had remained for
                    ever lost.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'You are wise and fearless and fair, <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> <name type="PERSON">Galad<name type="GPE">ri</name>el</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> will give
                you the <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> <name type="ORG">Ring</name>, if you ask for it. It is too great a matter for me.'</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Galad<name type="GPE">ri</name>el</name> laughed with a sudden clear laugh. `<name type="PERSON">Wise</name> the <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> <name type="PERSON">Galad<name type="GPE">ri</name>el</name> may be,' she
                said, `yet here she has met her match in courtesy. Gently are you revenged for my
                testing of your heart at our <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> meeting. You begin to see with a keen eye. I do
                not deny that my heart has greatly desired to ask what you offer. For many long
                <name type="DATE">year</name>s I had pondered what I might do, should the Great <name type="ORG">Ring</name> come into my hands, and
                behold! it was brought within my grasp. The evil that was devised <name type="DATE">long ago</name> works on
                in many ways, whether <name type="ORG">Sauron</name> himself stands or falls. Would not that have been a
                noble deed to set to the credit of his <name type="ORG">Ring</name>, if I had taken it by force or fear from
                my guest?</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`A</name>nd now at last it comes. You will give me the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> freely! In place of the Dark
                <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd you will set up a Queen. And I shall not be dark, but beautiful and ter<name type="GPE">ri</name>ble as
                the <name type="TIME">Morning</name> and the Night! <name type="ORG">Fair</name> as the <name type="LOC">Sea</name> and the <name type="ORG">Sun</name> and the <name type="PERSON">Snow</name> upon the
                <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>! Dreadful as the Storm and the Lightning! Stronger than the foundations of
                the <name type="LOC">earth</name>. All shall love me and despair! '</p>
            <p>She lifted up her hand and from the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng that she wore there issued a great light
                that illuminated her al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> and left all else dark. She stood before <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> seeming
                now tall beyond measurement, and beautiful beyond endu<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng, ter<name type="GPE">ri</name>ble and worshipful.
                Then she let her hand fall, and the light faded, and suddenly she laughed again, and
                lo! she was shrunken: a slender elf-woman, clad in simple white, whose gentle voice
                was soft and sad.</p>
            <p><q>'I pass the test,'</q> she said. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> will diminish, and go into the <name type="LOC">West</name> and remain
                <name type="PERSON">Galad<name type="GPE">ri</name>el</name>.'</p>
            <p>They stood for a long while in silence. At length the <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> spoke again. `Let us
                return! <q>' she said. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>n the <name type="TIME">morning</name> you must depart for now we have chosen, and
                    the tides of fate are flowing.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`I</name> would ask <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> thing before we go,' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, `a thing which I of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> meant to ask
                <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> in <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name>. I am permitted to wear the <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> <name type="ORG">Ring</name>: why cannot I see all the
                others and know the thoughts of those that wear them? '</p>
            <p>`You have not t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed,' she said. `Only th<name type="GPE">ri</name>ce have you set the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> upon your finger
                since you knew what you possessed. Do not try! It would destroy you. Did not <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>
                tell you that the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ngs give power according to the measure of each possessor?
                Before you could use that power you would need to become far stronger, and to train
                your will to the domination of others. Yet even so, as <name type="ORG">Ring</name>-bearer and as <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> that
                has borne it on finger and seen that which is hidden, your sight is grown keener.
                You have perceived my thought more clearly than many that are accounted wise. You
                saw the <name type="PRODUCT">Eye</name> of him that holds the <name type="CARDINAL">Seven</name> and the <name type="CARDINAL">Nine</name>. And did you not see and
                recognize the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng upon my finger? Did you see my <name type="GPE">ri</name>ng? ' she asked turning again to
                <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>.</p>
            <p><q>'No, <name type="PERSON">Lady</name>,'</q> he answered. `To tell you the truth, I wondered what you were
                talking about. I saw a star through your finger. But if you'll par<name type="PERSON">don</name> my speaking
                out, I think my master was <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght. I wish you'd take his <name type="ORG">Ring</name>. You'd put things to
                <name type="GPE">ri</name>ghts. You'd stop them digging up the gaffer and turning him ad<name type="GPE">ri</name>ft. You'd make
                some folk pay for their dirty work.'</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`I</name> would,<q>' she said. `That is how it would begin. But it would not stop with that,
                    alas! We will not speak more of it. Let us go!'</q></p>

            <p><name type="TIME">That <name type="TIME">night</name></name> the <name type="ORG">Company</name> was again summ<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>d to the chamber of <name type="EVENT">Celeborn</name>, and there the
                <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd and <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> greeted them with fair words. At length <name type="EVENT">Celeborn</name> spoke of their
                departure.</p>
            <p>`Now is the time,<q>' he said, `when those who wish to continue the <name type="PRODUCT">Quest</name> must harden
                    their hearts to leave this land. Those who no longer wish to go forward may
                    remain here, for a while. But whether they stay or go, n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> can be sure of
                    peace. For we are come now to the edge of doom. Here those who wish may await
                    the oncoming of the <name type="TIME">hour</name> till either the ways of the world lie open again. or we
                    summon them to the last need of L�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en. Then they may return to their own lands,
                    or else go to the long home of those that fall in battle.'</q></p>
            <p>There was a silence. `They all resolved to go forward,' said <name type="PERSON">Galad<name type="GPE">ri</name>el</name> looking in
                their eyes.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`A</name>s for me,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>, `my way home lies onward and not back.'</q></p>
            <p>`That is true,' said <name type="EVENT">Celeborn</name>, `but is all this <name type="ORG">Company</name> going with you to Minas
                <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name>? '</p>
            <p>`We have not decided our course,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. 'Beyond <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>thl�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en I do not know
                    what <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> in<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ded to do. Indeed I do not think that even he had any clear
                    purpose.'</q></p>
            <p>`<name type="DATE">May</name>be not,' said <name type="EVENT">Celeborn</name>, `yet when you leave this land, you can no longer forget
                the <name type="LOC">Great <name type="LOC">River</name></name>. As some of you know well, it cannot be crossed by travellers with
                baggage between L�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en and <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>, save by boat. And are not the b<name type="GPE">ri</name>dges of
                <name type="NORP">Osgiliath</name> broken down and all the landings held now by the Enemy?</p>
            <p>`On which side will you journey? The way to Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name> lies upon this side, upon
                the west; but the straight road of the <name type="PRODUCT">Quest</name> lies east of the <name type="LOC">River</name>, upon the darker
                shore. Which shore will you now take? '</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`I</name>f my advice is heeded, it will be the western shore, and the way to Minas
                    <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name>,<q>' answered <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>. `But I am not the leader of the <name type="ORG">Company</name>.'</q> The
                others said nothing, and <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> looked doubtful and troubled.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`I</name> see that you do not yet know what to do,<q>' said <name type="EVENT">Celeborn</name>. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>t is not my part to
                    choose for you; but I will help you as I may. There are some among you who can
                    handle boats: <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>, whose folk know the swift <name type="ORG">Forest</name> <name type="LOC">River</name>; and <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> of
                    <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>; and <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> the traveller.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`A</name>nd <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>bbit! <q>' c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. `Not all of us look on boats as wild horses. My
                    people live by the banks of the <name type="ORG">Brand</name>ywine.'</q></p>
            <p>`That is well,<q>' said <name type="EVENT">Celeborn</name>. `Then I will furnish your <name type="ORG">Company</name> with boats. They
                    must be small and light, for if you go far by water, there are places where you
                    will be forced to carry them. You will come to the rapids of <name type="PERSON">Sarn Gebir</name>, and
                    maybe at last to the great falls of <name type="PERSON">Rauros</name> where the <name type="LOC">River</name> thunders down from
                    <name type="ORG">Nen Hithoel</name>; and there are other pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ls. Boats may make your journey less
                    toilsome for a while. Yet they will not give you counsel: in the end you must
                    leave them and the <name type="LOC">River</name>, and turn west-or east.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> thanked <name type="EVENT">Celeborn</name> many times. The gift of boats comforted him much, not least
                because there would now be no need to decide his course for some <name type="DATE">day</name>s. The others,
                too, looked more hopeful. Whatever pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ls lay ahead, it seemed better to float down
                the broad tide of <name type="GPE">Anduin</name> to meet them than to plod forward with bent backs. Only <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>
                was doubtful: he at any rate still thought boats as bad as wild horses, or worse,
                and not all the dangers that he had survived made him think better of them.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`A</name>ll shall be prepared for you and await you at the haven before <name type="TIME">noon</name> to<name type="DATE">morrow</name>,<q>'
                    said <name type="EVENT">Celeborn</name>. 'I will send my people to you in the <name type="TIME">morning</name> to help you make
                    ready for the journey. Now we will wish you all a fair <name type="TIME">night</name> and untroubled
                    sleep.'</q></p>
            <p>'<name type="TIME">Good <name type="TIME">night</name></name>, my f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends! ' said <name type="PERSON">Galad<name type="GPE">ri</name>el</name>. 'Sleep in peace! Do not trouble your
                hearts overmuch with thought of the road to<name type="TIME">night</name>. <name type="DATE">May</name>be the paths that you each
                shall tread are already laid before your feet, though you do not see them. Good
                <name type="TIME">night</name>! '</p>
            <p>The <name type="ORG">Company</name> now took their leave and returned to their pavilion. <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> went with
                them, for this was to be their <name type="TIME">last <name type="TIME">night</name></name> in <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>thl�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en, and in spite of the words
                of <name type="PERSON">Galad<name type="GPE">ri</name>el</name> they wished to take counsel together.</p>
            <p>For a long time they debated what they should do, and how it would be best to attempt
                the fulfilling of their purpose with the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>: but they came to no decision. It was
                plain that most of them desired to go <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> to Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name>, and to escape at least
                for a while from the terror of the Enemy. They would have been willing to follow a
                leader over the <name type="LOC">River</name> and into the shadow of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>; but <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> spoke no word, and
                <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> was still divided in his mind.</p>
            <p>His own plan, while <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> remained with them, had been to go with <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>, and with
                his sword help to deliver <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>. For he believed that the message of the dreams was
                a summons, and that the <name type="TIME">hour</name> had come at last when the heir of <name type="PERSON">Elen</name>dil should come
                forth and st<name type="GPE">ri</name>ve with <name type="ORG">Sauron</name> for the mastery. But in <name type="GPE">Mo<name type="GPE">ri</name>a</name> the burden of <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> had
                been laid on him; and he knew that he could not now forsake the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>, if <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>
                refused in the end to go with <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>. And yet what help could he or any of the
                <name type="ORG">Company</name> give to <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, save to walk blindly with him into the darkness?</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`I</name> shall go to Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name>, al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> if need be, for it is my duty,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>;
                    and after that he was silent for a while, sitting with his eyes fixed on <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>,
                    as if he was trying to read the <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>fling's thoughts. At length he spoke again,
                    softly, as if he was debating with himself. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>f you wish only to destroy the
                    <name type="ORG">Ring</name>,'</q> he said, `then there is little use in war and weapons; and the <name type="ORG">Men</name> of
                Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name> cannot help. But if you wish to destroy the armed might of the Dark
                <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd, then it is folly to go without force into his domain; and folly to throw
                    away.<q>' He paused suddenly, as if he had become aware that he was speaking his
                    thoughts aloud. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>t would be folly to throw lives away, I mean,'</q> he ended.
                <name type="PERSON">`I</name>t is a choice between de<name type="PERSON">fen</name>ding a strong place and walking openly into the arms of
                death. At least, that is how I see it.'</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> caught something new and strange in <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>'s glance, and he looked hard at
                him. <name type="LOC">Plain</name>ly <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>'s thought was different from his final words. It would be folly
                to throw away: what? The <name type="ORG">Ring</name> of <name type="ORG">Power</name>? He had said something like this at the
                <name type="ORG">Council</name>, but then he had accepted the correction of <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name>. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> looked at <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>,
                but he seemed deep in his own thought and made no sign that he had heeded <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>'s
                words. And so their debate ended. <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> were already asleep, and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> was
                nodding. <name type="TIME">The <name type="TIME">night</name></name> was growing old.</p>
            <p>In the <name type="TIME">morning</name>, as they were beginning to pack their slender goods, <name type="ORG">Elves</name> that could
                speak their tongue came to them and brought them many gifts of food and clothing for
                the journey. The food was mostly in the form of very thin cakes, made of a meal that
                was baked a light brown on the outside, and inside was the colour of cream. <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>
                took up <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the cakes and looked at it with a doubtful eye.</p>
            <p>`_Cram_,' he said under his breath, as he broke off a c<name type="GPE">ri</name>sp corner and nibbled at it.
                His expression quickly changed, and he ate all the rest of the cake with relish.</p>
            <p>`No more, no more!<q>' c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed the <name type="ORG">Elves</name> laughing. `You have ea<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> enough already for a
                    long <name type="DATE">day</name>'s <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ch.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`I</name> thought it was only a kind of _cram_, such as the <name type="ORG">Dale</name>-men make for journeys in
                the wild,' said the <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Dwarf</name>.</p>
            <p>`So it is,<q>' they answered. `But we call it _lembas_ or <name type="PERSON">waybread</name>, and it is more
                    strengthening than any food made by <name type="ORG">Men</name>, and it is more pleasant than _cram_, by
                    all accounts.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`I</name>ndeed it is,' said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. 'Why it is better than the h<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>y-cakes of the <name type="ORG">Beorn</name>ings,
                and that is great praise, for the <name type="ORG">Beorn</name>ings are the best bakers that I know of; but
                they are n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> too willing to deal out their cakes to travellers in these <name type="DATE">day</name>s. You
                are kindly hosts! '</p>
            <p><q>'All the same, we bid you spare the food,'</q> they said. <q>'Eat little at a
                    time, and only at need. For these things are given to serve you when all else
                    fails. The cakes will keep sweet for many m<name type="DATE">any <name type="DATE">day</name></name>s, if they are unbroken and
                    left in their leaf-wrappings, as we have brought them. <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> will keep a traveller
                    on his feet for <name type="DATE">a <name type="DATE">day</name></name> of long labour, even if he be <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of the tall <name type="ORG">Men</name> of Minas
                    <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name>.'</q></p>
            <p>The <name type="ORG">Elves</name> next unwrapped and gave to each of the <name type="ORG">Company</name> the clothes they had
                brought. For each they had provided a hood and cloak, made according to his size, of
                the light but warm silken stuff that the <name type="ORG">Galadh<name type="GPE">ri</name>m</name> wove. It was hard to say of what
                colour they were: grey with the hue of <name type="TIME">twilight</name> under the trees they seemed to be;
                and yet if they were moved, or set in another light, they were green as shadowed
                leaves, or brown as fallow fields by <name type="TIME">night</name>, <name type="TIME">dusk</name>-silver as water under the stars.
                Each cloak was fas<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed about the neck with a brooch like a green leaf veined with
                silver.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`A</name>re these magic cloaks? ' asked <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>, looking at them with wonder.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`I</name> do not know what you mean by that,<q>' answered the leader of the <name type="ORG">Elves</name>. `They are
                    fair garments, and the web is good, for it was made in this land. They are
                    elvish robes certainly, if that is what you mean. Leaf and branch, water and
                    st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>: they have the hue and beauty of all these things under the <name type="TIME">twilight</name> of
                    L�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en that we love; for we put the thought of all that we love into all that we
                    make. Yet they are garments, not armour, and they will not turn shaft or blade.
                    But they should serve you well: they are light to wear, and warm enough or cool
                    enough at need. And you will find them a great aid in keeping out of the sight
                    of unf<name type="GPE">ri</name>endly eyes, whether you walk among the st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s or the trees. You are
                    indeed high in the favour of the <name type="PERSON">Lady</name>! For she herself and her maidens wove this
                    stuff; and never before have we clad strangers in the garb of our own
                    people.'</q></p>
            <p>After their <name type="TIME">morning</name> meal the <name type="ORG">Company</name> said farewell to the lawn by the fountain. Their
                hearts were heavy; for it was a fair place, and it had become like home to them,
                though they could not count the <name type="DATE">day</name>s and <name type="TIME">night</name>s that they had passed there. As they
                stood for a moment looking at the white water in the sunlight, <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>dir came walking
                towards them over the green grass of the glade. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> greeted him with delight.</p>
            <p><q>'I have returned from the <name type="LOC">North</name>ern Fences,'</q> said the <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name>, `and I am sent now
                to be your guide again. The <name type="GPE">Dim<name type="GPE">ri</name>ll</name> <name type="ORG">Dale</name> is full of vapour and clouds of smoke, and
                the mountains are troubled. There are noises in the deeps of the <name type="LOC">earth</name>. If any of
                you had thought of returning northwards to your homes, you would not have been able
                to pass that way. But come! Your path now goes south.'</p>
            <p>As they walked through <name type="ORG">Caras Galadhon</name> the green ways were empty; but in the trees
                above them many voices were murmu<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng and singing. They themselves went silently. At
                last <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>dir led them down the southward slopes of the hill, and they came again to
                the great gate hung with lamps, and to the white b<name type="GPE">ri</name>dge; and so they passed out and
                left the city of the <name type="ORG">Elves</name>. Then they turned away from the paved road and took a
                path that went off into a deep thicket of mallorn-trees, and passed on, winding
                through rolling woodlands of silver shadow, leading them ever down, southwards and
                eastwards, towards the shores of the <name type="LOC">River</name>.</p>
            <p>They had g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> <name type="QUANTITY">some <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> miles</name> and <name type="TIME">noon</name> was at hand when they came on a high green
                wall. Passing through an opening they came suddenly out of the trees. Before them
                lay a long lawn of shining grass, studded with golden _elanor_ that glinted in the
                sun. The lawn ran out into a narrow tongue between b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght <name type="PERSON">mar</name>gins: on the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght and
                west the <name type="ORG">Silverlode</name> flowed glitte<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng; on the left and east the <name type="LOC">Great <name type="LOC">River</name></name> rolled
                its broad waters, deep and dark. On the further shores the woodlands still <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ched
                on southwards as far as the eye could see, but all the banks were bleak and bare. No
                mallorn lifted its gold-hung boughs beyond the Land of L�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en.</p>
            <p>On the bank of the <name type="ORG">Silverlode</name>, at some distance up from the meeting of the streams,
                there was a <name type="LOC">hythe</name> of white st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s and white wood. By it were moored many boats and
                barges. Some were b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ghtly painted, and sh<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> with silver and gold and green, but
                most were either white or grey. <name type="PERSON">Thr</name>ee small grey boats had been made ready for the
                travellers, and in these the <name type="ORG">Elves</name> stowed their goods. And they added also coils of
                rope, <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> to each boat. Slender they looked, but strong, silken to the touch, grey
                of hue like the <name type="ORG">elven</name>-cloaks.</p>
            <p>`What are these? ' asked <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, handling <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> that lay upon the greensward.</p>
            <p><name type="TIME">`Rope</name>s indeed! <q>' answered an <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name> from the boats. 'Never travel far without a rope!
                    And <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> that is long and strong and light. Such are these. They may be a help in
                    many needs.'</q></p>
            <p>
                <q>'You <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t need to tell me that! ' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> came without any and I've been
                    wor<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed ever since. But I was wonde<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng what these were made of, knowing a bit
                    about rope-making: it's in the family as you might say.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>`They are made of _hithlain_,' said the <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name>, `but there is no time now to instruct
                you in the art of their making. Had we known that this craft delighted you, we could
                have taught you much. But now alas! unless you should at some time return hither,
                you must be con<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>t with our gift. <name type="DATE">May</name> it serve you well! '</p>
            <p>`Come! ' said <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>dir. <name type="PERSON">`A</name>ll is now ready for you. <name type="ORG">Ent</name>er the boats! But take care at
                <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>! '</p>
            <p>
                <q>'<name type="PERSON">Heed</name> the words! ' said the other <name type="ORG">Elves</name>. 'These boats are light-built, and they
                    are crafty and unlike the boats of other folk. They will not sink, lade them as
                    you will; but they are wayward if mishandled. It would be wise if you accus<name type="PERSON">tom</name>ed
                    yourselves to stepping in and out, here where there is a landing-place, before
                    you set off downstream.'</q>
            </p>
            <p>The <name type="ORG">Company</name> was arranged in this way: <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> were in <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> boat;
                <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>, <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>, and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> in another; and in the <name type="ORDINAL">third</name> were <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> and <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>, who
                had now become fast f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends. In this last boat most of the goods and packs were
                stowed. The boats were moved and steered with short-handled paddles that had broad
                leaf-shaped blades. When all was ready <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> led them on a t<name type="GPE">ri</name>al up the
                <name type="ORG">Silverlode</name>. The current was swift and they went forward slowly. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> sat in the bows,
                clut<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g the sides, and looking back wistfully to the shore. The sunlight
                glitte<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng on the water dazzled his eyes. As they passed beyond the green field of
                the Tongue, the trees drew down to the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver's b<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk. Here and there golden leaves
                tossed and floated on the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ppling stream. The air was very b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght and still, and
                there was a silence, except for the high distant song of larks.</p>
            <p>They turned a sharp bend in the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver, and there, sailing proudly down the stream
                toward them, they saw a s<name type="PERSON">wan</name> of great size. The water <name type="GPE">ri</name>ppled on either side of the
                white breast beneath its curving neck. Its beak sh<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> like burnished gold, and its
                eyes glinted like jet set in yellow st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s; its huge white wings were <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> lifted. A
                music came down the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver as it drew nearer; and suddenly they perceived that it was
                a ship, wrought and carved with <name type="ORG">elven</name>-skill in the likeness of a bird. <name type="CARDINAL">Two</name> elves
                clad in white steered it with black paddles. In the midst of the vessel sat
                <name type="EVENT">Celeborn</name>, and behind him stood <name type="PERSON">Galad<name type="GPE">ri</name>el</name>, tall and white; a circlet of golden
                flowers was in her <name type="PERSON">hai</name>r, and in her hand she held a harp, and she sang. Sad and
                sweet was the sound of her voice in the cool clear air:</p>
            <p>I sang of leaves, of leaves of gold, and leaves of gold there grew:</p>
            <p>Of wind I sang, a wind there came and in the branches blew.</p>
            <p>Beyond the <name type="ORG">Sun</name>, beyond the <name type="PERSON">Moon</name>, the foam was on the <name type="LOC">Sea</name>,</p>
            <p>And by the strand of Il<name type="PERSON">mar</name>in there grew a golden <name type="PERSON">Tree</name>.</p>
            <p>Beneath the stars of Ever-eve in <name type="PERSON">Elda<name type="PERSON">mar</name></name> it sh<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>,</p>
            <p>In <name type="PERSON">Elda<name type="PERSON">mar</name></name> beside the walls of <name type="ORG">Elven</name> Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>on.</p>
            <p>There long the golden leaves have grown upon the bran<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g <name type="DATE">year</name>s,</p>
            <p>While here beyond the <name type="ORG">Sun</name>de<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng <name type="LOC">Sea</name>s now fall the <name type="ORG">Elven</name>-tears.</p>
            <p>O L�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en! The <name type="DATE">Winter</name> comes, the bare and leafles<name type="DATE">s Day</name>;</p>
            <p>The leaves are falling in the stream, the <name type="LOC">River</name> flows away.</p>
            <p>O L�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en! Too long I have dwelt upon this Hither <name type="LOC">Shore</name></p>
            <p>And in a fading crown have twined <name type="FAC">the golden elanor</name>.</p>
            <p>But if of ships I now should sing, what ship would come to me,</p>
            <p>What ship would bear me ever back across so wide a <name type="LOC">Sea</name>?</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> stayed his boat as the <name type="PERSON">S<name type="PERSON">wan</name></name>-ship drew alongside. The <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> ended her song and
                greeted them. `We have come to bid you our last farewell,<q>' she said, `and to
                    speed you with blessings from our land.'</q></p>
            <p>`Though you have been our guests,<q>' said <name type="EVENT">Celeborn</name>, `you have not yet ea<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> with us,
                    and we bid you, therefore, to a parting feast, here between the flowing waters
                    that will bear you far from L�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en.'</q></p>
            <p>The <name type="PERSON">S<name type="PERSON">wan</name></name> passed on slowly to the <name type="LOC">hythe</name>, and they turned their boats and followed it.
                There in the last end of <name type="PERSON">Egladil</name> upon the green grass the parting feast was held;
                but <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> ate and drank little, heeding only the beauty of the <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> and her voice.
                She seemed no longer pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>lous or ter<name type="GPE">ri</name>ble, nor filled with hidden power. Already she
                seemed to him, as by men of later <name type="DATE">day</name>s <name type="ORG">Elves</name> still at times are seen: present and
                yet remote, a living vision of that which has already been left far behind by the
                flowing streams of <name type="PERSON">Tim</name>e.</p>
            <p>After they had ea<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> and drunk, sitting upon the grass, <name type="EVENT">Celeborn</name> spoke to them again
                of their journey, and lifting his hand he pointed south to the woods beyond the
                Tongue.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`A</name>s you go down the water,' he said, `you will find that the trees will fail, and you
                will come to a barren country. There the <name type="LOC">River</name> flows in stony <name type="GPE">vale</name> amid high moors,
                until at last after many leagues it comes to the tall island of the Tindrock, that
                we call Tol <name type="ORG">Brand</name>ir. There it casts its arms about the steep shores of the isle, and
                falls then with a great noise and smoke over the cataracts of <name type="PERSON">Rauros</name> down into the
                <name type="PERSON">Nindalf</name>, the <name type="GPE">Wet<name type="PERSON">wan</name>g</name> as it is called in your tongue. That is a wide region of
                sluggish <name type="PERSON">fen</name> where the stream becomes tortuous and much divided. There the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>wash
                flows in by many mouths from the <name type="ORG">Forest</name> of <name type="PERSON">Fangorn</name> in the west. About that stream,
                on this side of the <name type="LOC">Great <name type="LOC">River</name></name>, lies <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>. On the further side are the bleak hills
                of the <name type="ORG">Emyn Muil</name>. The wind blows from the <name type="LOC">East</name> there, for they look out over the
                Dead <name type="LOC">Marshes</name> and the <name type="NORP">Noman</name>-lands to <name type="PERSON">Ci<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name> Gorgor and the black gates of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>.</p>
            <p>
                <q>'<name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>, and any that go with him seeking Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name>, will do well to leave
                    the <name type="LOC">Great <name type="LOC">River</name></name> above <name type="PERSON">Rauros</name> and cross the <name type="ORG">Ent</name>wash before it finds the <name type="PERSON">mar</name>shes.
                    Yet they should not go too far up that stream, nor <name type="GPE">ri</name>sk becoming entangled in
                    the <name type="ORG">Forest</name> of <name type="PERSON">Fangorn</name>. That is a strange land, and is now little known. But
                    <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> and <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> doubtless do not need this warning.'</q>
            </p>
            <p><q>'Indeed we have heard of <name type="PERSON">Fangorn</name> in Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>. `But what I
                have heard seems to me for the most part old wives' tales, such as we tell to our
                children. All that lies north of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> is now to us so far away that fancy can
                <name type="PERSON">wan</name>der freely there. Of old <name type="PERSON">Fangorn</name> lay upon the borders of our realm; but it is now
                many lives of men since any of us visited it, to prove or disprove the legends that
                have come down from <name type="DATE">distant <name type="DATE">year</name>s</name>.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`I</name> have myself been at whiles in <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>, but I have never crossed it northwards. When
                I was sent out as a messenger, I passed through the <name type="ORG">Gap</name> by the skirts of the White
                <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s, and crossed the <name type="PERSON">Isen</name> and the <name type="ORG">Grey</name>flood into <name type="LOC">North</name>erland. A long and

                for I lost my horse at <name type="ORG">Tharbad</name>, at the <name type="ORG">ford</name>ing of the <name type="ORG">Grey</name>flood. After that journey,
                and the road I have trodden with this <name type="ORG">Company</name>, I do not much doubt that I shall find
                a way through <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>, and <name type="PERSON">Fangorn</name> too, if need be.'</p>
            <p>`Then I need say no more,<q>' said <name type="EVENT">Celeborn</name>. 'But do not despise the lore that has
                    come down from <name type="DATE">distant <name type="DATE">year</name>s</name>; for oft it may chance that old wives keep in
                    memory word of things that once were needful for the wise to know.'</q></p>
            <p>Now <name type="PERSON">Galad<name type="GPE">ri</name>el</name> rose from the grass, and taking a cup from <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of her maidens she
                filled it with white mead and gave it to <name type="EVENT">Celeborn</name>.</p>
            <p><q>'Now it is time to d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk the cup of farewell,'</q> she said. `D<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk, <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd of the

            <p>Then she brought the c<name type="CARDINAL">up to</name> each of the <name type="ORG">Company</name>, and bade them d<name type="GPE">ri</name>nk and farewell.
                But when they had drunk she commanded them to sit again on the grass, and c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>rs
                were set for her and for <name type="EVENT">Celeborn</name>. Her maidens stood silent about her, and a while
                she looked upon her guests. At last she spoke again.</p>
            <p><q>'We have drunk the cup of parting,'</q> she said, `and the shadows fall between
                us. But before you go, I have brought in my ship gifts which the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd and <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> of

                turn.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`He</name>re is the gift of <name type="EVENT">Celeborn</name> and <name type="PERSON">Galad<name type="GPE">ri</name>el</name> to the leader of your <name type="ORG">Company</name>,' she said
                to <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>, and she gave him a sheath that had been made to fit his sword. It was
                overlaid with a tracery of flowers and leaves wrought of silver and gold, and on it
                were set in <name type="ORG">elven</name> runes formed of many gems the name And�<name type="GPE">ri</name>l and the lineage of the
                sword.</p>
            <p>`The blade that is drawn from this sheath shall not be stained or broken even in
                    defeat,<q>' she said. `But is there aught else that you desire of me at our
                    parting? For darkness will flow between us, and it may be that we shall not meet
                    again, unless it be far hence upon a road that has no returning.'</q></p>
            <p>And <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> answered: <q>'<name type="PERSON">Lady</name>, you know all my desire, and long held in keeping the
                    only treasure that I seek. Yet it is not yours to give me, even if you would;
                    and only through darkness shall I come to it.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`Yet</name> maybe this will ligh<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> your heart,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Galad<name type="GPE">ri</name>el</name>; `for it was left in my

                from her lap a great st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of a clear green, set in a silver brooch that was wrought
                in the likeness of an eagle with outspread wings; and as she held it up the gem
                flashed like the sun shining through the leaves of sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng. `This st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> I gave to
                Celebr�an my daughter, and she to hers; and now it comes to you as a token of hope.

            <p>Then <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> took the st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> and pinned the brooch upon his breast, and those who saw
                him wondered; for they had not <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ked before how tall and kingly he stood, and it
                seemed to them that <name type="DATE">many <name type="DATE">year</name>s</name> of toil had fallen from his shoulders. `For the gifts
                that you have given me I thank you,' he said, 'O <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> of L�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en of whom were sprung
                Celebr�an and <name type="PERSON">Arwen</name> <name type="ORG">Evenstar</name>. What praise could I say more? '</p>
            <p>The <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> bowed her head, and she turned then to <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>, and to him she gave a belt
                of gold; and to <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> she gave small silver belts, each with a clasp
                wrought like a golden flower. To <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> she gave a bow such as the <name type="ORG">Galadh<name type="GPE">ri</name>m</name> used,
                longer and stouter than the bows of <name type="GPE">Mirkwood</name>, and strung with a st<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng of elf-<name type="PERSON">hai</name>r.
                With it went a quiver of arrows.</p>
            <p>`For you little gardener and lover of trees,<q>' she said to <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, <name type="PERSON">`I</name> have only a

            <p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> went red to the ears and muttered something inaudible, as he clutched the box and
                bowed as well as he could.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`A</name>nd what gift would a <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Dwarf</name> ask of the <name type="ORG">Elves</name>? ' said <name type="PERSON">Galad<name type="GPE">ri</name>el</name> turning to <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>.</p>
            <p>`N<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, <name type="PERSON">Lady</name>,<q>' answered <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>t is enough for me to have seen the <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> of the

            <p><name type="PERSON">`He</name>ar all ye <name type="ORG">Elves</name>! <q>' she c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed to those about her. `Let n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> say again that
                    <name type="ORG">Dwarves</name> are grasping and ungracious! Yet surely, <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> son of <name type="PRODUCT">Gl�</name>in, you desire
                    something that I could give? Name it, I bid you! You shall not be the only guest
                    without a gift.'</q></p>
            <p>`There is nothing, <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> <name type="PERSON">Galad<name type="GPE">ri</name>el</name>,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>, bowing low and stamme<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng.
                    `Nothing, unless it might be � unless it is permitted to ask, nay, to name a
                    single strand of your <name type="PERSON">hai</name>r, which surpasses the gold of the <name type="LOC">earth</name> as the stars
                    surpass the gems of the mine. I do not ask for such a gift. But you commanded me
                    to name my desire.'</q></p>
            <p>The <name type="ORG">Elves</name> stirred and murmured with astonishment, and <name type="EVENT">Celeborn</name> gazed at the <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Dwarf</name> in
                wonder, but the <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> smiled. 'It is said that the skill of the <name type="ORG">Dwarves</name> is in their
                hands rather than in their tongues ' she said; `yet that is not true of <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. For
                n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> have ever made to me a request so bold and yet so courteous. And how shall I
                refuse, since I commanded him to speak? But tell me, what would you do with such a
                gift? '</p>
            <p>`Treasure it, <name type="PERSON">Lady</name>,<q>' he answered, `in memory of your words to me at our <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>
                    meeting. And if ever I return to the smithies of my home, it shall be set in
                    impe<name type="GPE">ri</name>shable crystal to be an heirloom of my house, and a pledge of good will
                    between the <name type="LOC">Mountain</name> and the <name type="PERSON">Wood</name> until the end of <name type="DATE">day</name>s.'</q></p>
            <p>Then the <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> unbraided <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of her long tresses, and cut off <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> golden <name type="PERSON">hai</name>rs, and
                laid them in <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>'s hand. `These words shall go with the gift,' she said. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> do not
                foretell, for all foretelling is now vain: on the <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> hand lies darkness, and on the
                other only hope. But if hope should not fail, then I say to you, <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> son of <name type="PRODUCT">Gl�</name>in,
                that your hands shall flow with gold, and yet over you gold shall have no
                dominion.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`A</name>nd you, <name type="ORG">Ring</name>-bearer,<q>' she said, turning to <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> come to you last who are
                    not last in my thoughts. For you I have prepared this.'</q> She held up a small
                crystal phial: it glittered as she moved it, and rays of white light sprang from her
                hand. <q>'In this phial,'</q> she said, `is caught the light of E�rendil's star, set
                amid the waters of my fountain. It will shine still b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ghter when <name type="TIME">night</name> is about
                you. <name type="DATE">May</name> it be a light to you in dark places, when all other lights go out. Remember
                <name type="PERSON">Galad<name type="GPE">ri</name>el</name> and her <name type="ORG">Mirror</name>! '</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> took the phial, and for a moment as it sh<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> between them, he saw her again
                standing like a queen, great and beautiful, but no longer ter<name type="GPE">ri</name>ble. He bowed, but
                found no words to say.</p>
            <p>Now the <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> arose, and <name type="EVENT">Celeborn</name> led them back to the <name type="LOC">hythe</name>. <name type="TIME">A yellow <name type="TIME">noon</name></name> lay on the
                green land of the Tongue, and the water glittered with silver. All at last was made
                ready. The <name type="ORG">Company</name> took their places in the boats as before. Crying farewell, the
                <name type="ORG">Elves</name> of L�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en with long grey poles thrust them out into the flowing stream, and
                the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ppling waters bore them slowly away. The travellers sat still without moving
                or speaking. On <name type="ORG">the green bank</name> near to the very point of the Tongue the <name type="PERSON">Lady</name>
                <name type="PERSON">Galad<name type="GPE">ri</name>el</name> stood al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> and silent. As they passed her they turned and their eyes
                watched her slowly floating away from them. For so it seemed to them: L�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en was
                slipping backward, like a b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght ship masted with enchanted trees, sailing on to
                forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> shores, while they sat helpless upon the <name type="PERSON">mar</name>gin of the grey and leafless
                world.</p>
            <p>Even as they gazed, the <name type="ORG">Silverlode</name> passed out into the currents of the <name type="LOC">Great <name type="LOC">River</name></name>,
                and their boats turned and began to speed southwards. Soon the white form of the
                <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> was small and distant. She sh<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> like a window of glass upon a far hill in the
                weste<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng sun, or as a remote lake seen from a mountain: a crystal fallen in the lap
                of the land. Then it seemed to <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> that she lifted her arms in a final farewell,
                and far but piercing-clear on the following wind came the sound of her voice
                singing. But now she sang in the ancient tongue of the <name type="ORG">Elves</name> beyond the <name type="LOC">Sea</name>, and he
                did not understand the words: fair was the music, but it did not comfort him.</p>
            <p>Yet as is the way of <name type="PERSON">Elvish</name> words, they remained g<name type="PERSON">raven</name> in his memory, and long
                afterwards he interpreted them, as well as he could: the language was that of
                <name type="ORG">Elven</name>-song and spoke of things little known on <name type="LOC">Middle-<name type="LOC">earth</name></name>.</p>

                her hands like clouds, and all paths are drowned deep in shadow; and out of a grey

                the name of that <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> whom the <name type="ORG">Elves</name> in these lands of exile name <name type="PERSON">Elbereth</name>.</p>
            <p>Suddenly the <name type="LOC">River</name> swept round a bend, and the banks rose upon either side, and the
                light of L�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en was hidden. To that fair land <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> never came again.</p>
            <p>The travellers now turned their faces to the journey; the sun was before them, and
                their eyes were dazzled, for all were filled with tears. <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> wept openly.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`I</name> have looked the last upon that which was fairest,<q>' he said to <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> his

                He put his hand to his breast.</p>
            <p>`Tell me, <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>, why did I come on this <name type="PRODUCT">Quest</name>? Little did I know where the chief
                pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>l lay! Truly <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name> spoke, saying that we could not foresee what we might meet
                upon our road. Torment in the dark was the danger that I feared, and it did not hold
                me back. But I would not have come, had I known the danger of light and joy. Now I
                have taken my worst wound in this parting, even if I were to go this <name type="TIME">night</name> straight
                to the Dark <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd. <name type="PERSON">Alas</name> for <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> son of <name type="PRODUCT">Gl�</name>in! '</p>
            <p>`<name type="PERSON">Nay</name>! <q>' said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. `<name type="PERSON">Alas</name> for us all! And for all that walk the world in these
                    <name type="DATE">after-<name type="DATE">day</name>s</name>. For such is the way of it: to find and lose, as it seems to those
                    whose boat is on the running stream. But I count you blessed, <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> son of
                    <name type="PRODUCT">Gl�</name>in: for your loss you suffer of your own free will, and you might have chosen
                    otherwise. But you have not forsaken your companions, and the least reward that
                    you shall have is that the memory of <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>thl�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en shall remain ever clear and
                    unstained in your heart, and shall neither fade nor grow stale.'</q></p>
            <p>`<name type="DATE">May</name>be,' said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>; `and I thank you for your words. True words doubtless; yet all
                such comfort is cold. Memory is not what the heart desires. That is only a mirror,

                things otherwise. Indeed I have heard that for them memory is more like to the

            <p><q>'But let us talk no more of it. <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ok to the boat! She is too low in the water with

                following <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>'s boat ahead, which had already moved out of the middle
                stream.</p>
            <p>So the <name type="ORG">Company</name> went on their long way, down the wide hurrying waters, borne ever
                southwards. Bare woods stalked along either bank, and they could not see any glimpse
                of the lands behind. The breeze died away and the <name type="LOC">River</name> flowed without a sound. No
                voice of bird broke the silence. The sun grew misty as the <name type="DATE">day</name> grew old, until it
                gleamed in a pale sky like a high white pearl. Then it faded into the <name type="LOC">West</name>, and <name type="TIME">dusk</name>
                came early, followed by a grey and starless <name type="TIME">night</name>. <name type="LOC">Far</name> into the dark quiet <name type="TIME">hour</name>s
                they floated on, guiding their boats under the overhanging shadows of the western
                woods. Great trees passed by like ghosts, thrusting their twisted thirsty roots
                through the mist down into the water. It was dreary and cold. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> sat and lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed
                to the faint lap and gurgle of the <name type="LOC">River</name> fretting among the tree-roots and d<name type="GPE">ri</name>f<name type="CARDINAL">two</name>od
                near the shore, until his head nodded and he fell into an uneasy sleep.</p>

            <p>The <name type="LOC">Great <name type="LOC">River</name></name></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> was roused by <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. He found that he was lying, well wrapped, under tall
                grey-skinned trees in a quiet corner of the woodlands on <name type="GPE">the west bank</name> of the Great
                <name type="LOC">River</name>, <name type="GPE">Anduin</name>. He had slept the <name type="TIME">night</name> away, and the grey of <name type="TIME">morning</name> was dim among
                the bare branches. <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> was busy with a small fire near at hand.</p>
            <p>They started again before the <name type="DATE">day</name> was broad. Not that most of the <name type="ORG">Company</name> were eager
                to hurry southwards: they were con<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>t that the decision, which they must make at
                latest when they came to <name type="PERSON">Rauros</name> and <name type="GPE">the Tindrock Isle</name>, still lay some <name type="DATE">day</name>s ahead;
                and they let the <name type="LOC">River</name> bear them on at its own pace, having no desire to has<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>
                towards the pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ls that lay beyond, whichever course they took in the end. <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>
                let them d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ft with the stream as they wished, husbanding their strength against
                wea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ness to come. But he insisted that at least they should start early each <name type="DATE">day</name>
                and journey on far into the <name type="TIME">evening</name>; for he felt in his heart that time was
                pressing, and he feared that the Dark <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd had not been idle while they lingered in
                L�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en.</p>
            <p>N<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>theless they saw no sign of an enemy that <name type="DATE">day</name>, nor the next. <name type="TIME">The dull grey <name type="TIME">hour</name>s</name>
                passed without event. As the <name type="ORDINAL">third</name> <name type="DATE">day</name> of their voyage wore on the lands changed
                slowly: the trees thinned and then failed altogether. On <name type="ORG">the eastern bank</name> to their
                left they saw long formless slopes stret<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g up and away toward the sky; brown and
                withered they looked, as if fire had passed over them, leaving no living blade of
                green: an unf<name type="GPE">ri</name>endly waste without even a broken tree or a bold st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> to relieve the
                emptiness. They had come to the <name type="PERSON">Brown</name> Lands that lay, vast and desolate, between
                <name type="LOC">South</name>ern <name type="GPE">Mirkwood</name> and the hills of the <name type="ORG">Emyn Muil</name>. What pestilence or war or evil
                deed of the Enemy had so blasted all that region even <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> could not tell.</p>
            <p>Upon the west to their <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght the land was treeless also, but it was flat, and in many
                places green with wide plains of grass. On this side of the <name type="LOC">River</name> they passed
                forests of great reeds, so tall that they shut out all view to the west, as the
                little boats went rustling by along their flutte<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng borders. Their dark withered
                plumes bent and tossed in the light cold airs, hissing softly and sadly. Here and
                there through openings <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> could catch sudden glimpses of rolling meads, and far
                beyond them hills in the sunset, and away on the edge of sight a dark line, where
                <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ched the southernmost ranks of the <name type="LOC">Misty <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s</name>.</p>
            <p>There was no sign of living moving things, save birds. Of these there were many:
                small fowl whistling and piping in the reeds, but they were seldom seen. Once or
                twice the travellers heard the rush and whine of s<name type="PERSON">wan</name>-wings, and looking up they saw
                a great phalanx streaming along the sky.</p>
            <p>`<name type="PERSON">S<name type="PERSON">wan</name></name>s! ' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <name type="PERSON">`A</name>nd mighty big <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s too! '</p>
            <p>`Yes,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>, 'and they are black <name type="NORP">s<name type="PERSON">wan</name>s</name>.'</q></p>
            <p>`<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w wide and empty and mournful all this country looks! <q>' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> always
                    imagined that as <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> journeyed south it got warmer and mer<name type="GPE">ri</name>er, until <name type="DATE">winter</name> was
                    left behind for ever.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'But we have not journeyed far south yet,'</q> answered <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>t is still
                <name type="DATE">winter</name>, and we are far from the sea. Here the world is cold until the sudden sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng,
                and we may yet have snow again. <name type="LOC">Far</name> away down in the Bay of <name type="PERSON">Belfalas</name>, to which
                <name type="GPE">Anduin</name> runs, it is warm and merry, maybe, or would be but for the Enemy. But here we
                are not above <name type="CARDINAL">six</name>ty leagues, I guess, south of the <name type="LOC">South</name>farthing away in your <name type="LOC">Shire</name>,
                <name type="CARDINAL">hundred</name>s of long miles yonder. You are looking now south-west across the north
                plains of the <name type="ORG">Ridder<name type="PERSON">mar</name>k</name>, <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name> the land of the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>rse-lords. Ere long we shall come
                to the mouth of the <name type="PERSON">Limlight</name> that runs down from <name type="PERSON">Fangorn</name> to join the <name type="LOC">Great <name type="LOC">River</name></name>.
                That is the north boundary of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>; and of old all that lay between <name type="PERSON">Limlight</name> and
                the White <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s belonged to the Rohir<name type="GPE">ri</name>m. It is a <name type="GPE">ri</name>ch and pleasant land, and
                its grass has no <name type="GPE">ri</name>val; but in these evil <name type="DATE">day</name>s folk do not dwell by the <name type="LOC">River</name> or
                <name type="GPE">ri</name>de of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> to its shores. <name type="GPE">Anduin</name> is wide, yet the orcs can shoot their arrows far
                across the stream; and of late, it is said, they have dared to cross the water and
                raid the herds and studs of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>.'</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> looked from bank to bank uneasily. The trees had seemed hostile before, as if
                they harboured <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret eyes and lurking dangers; now he wished that the trees were
                still there. He felt that the <name type="ORG">Company</name> was too naked, afloat in little open boats in
                the midst of shelterless lands, and on a <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver that was the frontier of war.</p>
            <p>In the next <name type="DATE">day</name> or <name type="CARDINAL">two</name>, as they went on, borne steadily southwards, this feeling of
                in<name type="ORG">sec</name>u<name type="GPE">ri</name>ty grew on all the <name type="ORG">Company</name>. For <name type="DATE">a whole <name type="DATE">day</name></name> they took to their paddles and
                has<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed forward. The banks slid by. Soon the <name type="LOC">River</name> broadened and grew more shallow;
                long stony beaches lay upon the east, and there were gravel-shoals in the water, so
                that careful stee<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng was needed. The <name type="PERSON">Brown</name> Lands rose into bleak wolds, over which
                flowed a chill air from the <name type="LOC">East</name>. On the other side the meads had become rolling
                downs of withered grass amidst a land of <name type="PERSON">fen</name> and tussock. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> shivered, thinking
                of the lawns and fountains, the clear sun and gentle rains of <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>thl�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en. There was
                little speech and no laughter in any of the boats. Each member of the <name type="ORG">Company</name> was
                busy with his own thoughts.</p>
            <p>The heart of <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> was running under the stars of a <name type="DATE">summer</name> <name type="TIME">night</name> in some northern
                glade amid the beech-woods; <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> was finge<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng gold in his mind, and wonde<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng if
                it were fit to be wrought into the housing of the <name type="PERSON">Lady</name>'s gift. <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> in
                the middle boat were ill at ease, for <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> sat mutte<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng to himself, sometimes
                biting his nails, as if some restlessness or doubt consumed him, sometimes seizing a
                paddle and d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ving the boat close behind <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>'s. Then <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>, who sat in the bow
                looking back, caught a queer gleam in his eye, as he peered forward gazing at <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.
                <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> had <name type="DATE">long ago</name> made up his mind that, though boats were maybe not as dangerous as
                he had been brought <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name> believe, they were far more uncomfortable than even he had
                imagined. He was cramped and miserable, having nothing to do but stare at the
                <name type="DATE">winter</name>-lands crawling by and the grey water on either side of him. Even when the
                paddles were in use they did not trust <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> with <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>.</p>
            <p>As <name type="TIME">dusk</name> drew down on the <name type="CARDINAL">four</name>th <name type="DATE">day</name>, he was looking back over the bowed heads of
                <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> and the following boats; he was drowsy and longed for camp and the
                feel of <name type="LOC">earth</name> under his toes. Suddenly something caught his sight: at <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> he
                stared at it listlessly, then he sat up and rubbed his eyes; but when he looked
                again he could not see it any more.</p>
            <p><name type="TIME">That <name type="TIME">night</name></name> they camped on a small eyot close to <name type="ORG">the western bank</name>. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> lay rolled in
                blankets beside <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> had a funny dream <name type="TIME">an <name type="TIME">hour</name></name> or <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> before we stopped, Mr.
                    <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>,<q>' he said. `Or maybe it wasn't a dream. Funny it was anyway.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="ORG">`Well</name>, what was it? <q>' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, knowing that <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> would not settle down until he
                    had told his tale, whatever it was. 'I haven't seen or thought of anything to
                    make me smile since we left <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>thl�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`I</name>t wasn't funny that way, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. It was queer. All wrong, if it wasn't a dream.
                And you had best hear it. It was like this: I saw a log with eyes! '</p>
            <p>`The log's all <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght,' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. `There are many in the <name type="LOC">River</name>. But leave out the
                eyes! '</p>
            <p>`That I won't,' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. ` 'Twas the eyes as made me sit up, so to speak. I saw what
                I took to be a log floating along in the <name type="CARDINAL">half</name>-light behind <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>'s boat; but I
                didn't give much heed to it. Then it seemed as if the log was slowly cat<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g us up.
                And that was peculiar, as you might say, seeing as we were all floating on the
                stream together. Just then I saw the eyes: <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> pale sort of points, shiny-like, on a
                hump at the near end of the log. What's more, it wasn't a log, for it had
                paddle-feet, like a s<name type="PERSON">wan</name>'s almost, only they seemed bigger, and kept dipping in and
                out of the water.</p>
            <p>'That's when I sat <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght up and rubbed my eyes, meaning to give a shout, if it was
                still there when I had rubbed the drowse out of my head. For the whatever-it-was was
                coming along fast now and getting close behind <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. But whether those <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> lamps
                spotted me moving and sta<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng, or whether I came to my senses, I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t know. When I
                looked again, it wasn't there. Yet I think I caught a glimpse with the tail of-my
                eye, as the saying is, of something dark shooting under the shadow of the bank. I
                couldn't see no more eyes though.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`I</name> said to myself: "dreaming again, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> <name type="PERSON">Gamgee</name>," I said: and I said no more just
                then. But I've been thinking since. and now I'm not so sure. What do you make of it,
                Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>? '</p>
            <p>'I should make nothing of it but a log and the <name type="TIME">dusk</name> and sleep in your eyes <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, said
                <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, if this was the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> time that those eyes had been seen. But it isn't. I saw
                them away back north before we reached L�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en. And I saw a strange creature with
                eyes climbing to the flet that <name type="TIME">night</name>. <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>dir saw it too. And do you remember the
                report of the <name type="ORG">Elves</name> that went after the orc-band? '</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`A</name>h,' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> do; and I remember more too. I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t like my thoughts; but
                thinking of <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> thing and another, and Mr. <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name>'s sto<name type="GPE">ri</name>es and all, I fancy I could
                put a name on the creature, at a guess. A nasty name. <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>, maybe? '</p>
            <p>`Yes, that is what I have feared for some time,' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. `Ever since the <name type="TIME">night</name> on
                the flet. I suppose he was lurking in <name type="GPE">Mo<name type="GPE">ri</name>a</name>, and picked up our trail then; but I
                hoped that our stay in L�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en would throw him off the scent again. The miserable
                creature must have been hiding in the woods by the <name type="ORG">Silverlode</name>, wat<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g us start
                off! '</p>
            <p>`That's about it,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <name type="PERSON">`A</name>nd we'd better be a bit more watchful ourselves, or
                    we'll feel some nasty fingers round our necks <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of these <name type="TIME">night</name>s, if we ever
                    wake <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name> feel anything. And that's what I was leading <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name>. No need to
                    trouble <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> or the others to<name type="TIME">night</name>. I'll keep watch. I can sleep to<name type="DATE">morrow</name>,
                    being no more than luggage in a boat, as you might say.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`I</name> might,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, `and I might say "luggage with eyes". You shall watch; but
                    only if you promise to wake me <name type="CARDINAL">half</name>way towards <name type="TIME">morning</name>, if nothing happens
                    before then.'</q></p>
            <p>In the dead <name type="TIME">hour</name>s <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> came out of a deep dark sleep to find <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> shaking him. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>t's
                a shame to wake you,<q>' whispered <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, `but that's what you said. There's nothing
                    to tell, or not much. I thought I heard some soft plashing and a sniffing noise,
                    a while back; but you hear a lot of such queer sounds by a <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver at
                <name type="TIME">night</name>.'</q></p>
            <p>He lay down, and <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> sat up, huddled in his blankets, and fought off his sleep.
                <name type="TIME">Minutes or <name type="TIME">hour</name>s</name> passed slowly, and nothing happened. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> was just yielding to the
                temptation to lie down again when a dark shape, hardly visible, floated close to <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>
                of the moored boats. A long whitish hand could be dimly seen as it shot out and
                grabbed the gunwale; <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> pale lamplike eyes sh<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> coldly as they peered inside, and
                then they lifted and gazed up at <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> on the eyot. They were not more than a yard
                or <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> away, and <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> heard the soft hiss of <name type="ORG">intaken</name> breath. He stood up, drawing
                <name type="PERSON">Sting</name> from its sheath, and faced the eyes. Immediately their light was shut off.
                There was another hiss and a splash, and the dark log-shape shot away downstream
                into the <name type="TIME">night</name>. <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> stirred in his sleep, turned over, and sat up`</p>
            <p>'What is it? ' he whispered, sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>nging up and coming to <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> felt something in
                my sleep. Why have you drawn your sword? '</p>
            <p>`<name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>,<q>' answered <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. 'Or at least, so I guess.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`A</name>h! ' said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. `So you know about our little footpad, do you? He padded after
                us all through <name type="GPE">Mo<name type="GPE">ri</name>a</name> and <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght down to <name type="PERSON">Nimrodel</name>. Since we took to boats, he has been
                lying on a log and paddling with hands and feet. I have t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed to catch him once or
                twice at <name type="TIME">night</name>; but he is <name type="PERSON">slier</name> than a fox, and as slippery as a fish. I hoped the
                <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver-voyage would beat him, but he is too clever a waterman.</p>
            <p>`We shall have to try going faster to<name type="DATE">morrow</name>. You lie down now, and I will keep watch
                for what is left of the <name type="TIME">night</name>. I wish I could lay my hands on the wretch. We might
                make him useful. But if I cannot, we shall have to try and lose him. He is very
                dangerous. Quite apart from murder by <name type="TIME">night</name> on his own account, he may put any enemy
                that is about on our track.'</p>
            <p><name type="TIME">The <name type="TIME">night</name></name> passed without <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> showing so much as a shadow again. After that the
                <name type="ORG">Company</name> kept a sharp look-out, but they saw no more of <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> while the voyage
                lasted. If he was still following, he was very wary and cunning. At <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>'s
                bidding they paddled now for long spells, and the banks went swiftly by. But they
                saw little of the country, for they journeyed mostly by <name type="TIME">night</name> and <name type="TIME">twilight</name>, resting
                by <name type="DATE">day</name>, and lying as hidden as the land allowed. In this way the time passed without
                event until the <name type="CARDINAL">seven</name>th <name type="DATE">day</name>.</p>
            <p>The weather was still grey and overcast, with wind from the <name type="LOC">East</name>, but as <name type="TIME">evening</name> drew
                into <name type="TIME">night</name> the sky away westward cleared, and pools of faint light, yellow and pale
                green, opened under the grey shores of cloud. There the white <name type="GPE">ri</name>nd of the new <name type="PERSON">Moon</name>
                could be seen glimme<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng in the remote lakes. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> looked at it and puckered his
                brows.</p>
            <p><name type="DATE">The next <name type="DATE">day</name></name> the country on either side began to change rapidly. The banks began to
                <name type="GPE">ri</name>se and grow stony. Soon they were passing through a hilly rocky land, and on both
                shores there were steep slopes bu<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed in deep brakes of thorn and <name type="ORG">sloe</name>, tangled with
                brambles and creepers. Behind them stood low crumbling cliffs, and chimneys of grey
                weathered st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> dark with ivy; and beyond these again there rose high <name type="GPE">ri</name>dges crowned
                with wind-w<name type="GPE">ri</name>then firs. They were drawing near to the <name type="ORG">grey hill</name>-country of the Emyn
                Muil, the southern <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ch of <name type="PERSON">Wilderland</name>.</p>
            <p>There were many birds about the cliffs and the rock-chimneys, and <name type="DATE">all <name type="DATE">day</name></name> high in the
                air flocks of birds had been circling, black against the pale sky. As they lay in
                their camp that <name type="DATE">day</name> <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> watched the flights doubtfully, wonde<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng if <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> had
                been doing some mischief and the news of their voyage was now moving in the
                wilderness. Later as the sun was setting, and the <name type="ORG">Company</name> was stir<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng and getting
                ready to start again, he desc<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed a dark spot against the fading light: a great bird
                high and far off, now wheeling, now flying on slowly southwards.</p>
            <p>'What is that, <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>? ' he asked, pointing to the northern sky. 'Is it, as I think.
                an eagle? '</p>
            <p><q>'Yes.'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>t is an eagle, a hunting eagle. I wonder what that
                <name type="PERSON">forebode</name>s. It is far from the mountains.'</p>
            <p>`We will not start until it is fully dark,' said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>.</p>
            <p><name type="TIME">The <name type="CARDINAL">eight</name>h <name type="TIME">night</name></name> of their journey came. It was silent and windless; the <name type="LOC">grey east</name>
                wind had passed away. The thin crescent of the <name type="PERSON">Moon</name> had fallen early into the pale
                sunset, but the sky was clear above, and though far away in the <name type="LOC">South</name> there were
                great ranges of cloud that still sh<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> faintly, in the <name type="LOC">West</name> stars glinted
                b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght.</p>
            <p>`Come! <q>' said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. `We will venture <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> more journey by <name type="TIME">night</name>. We are coming
                    to reaches of the <name type="LOC">River</name> that I do not know well: for I have never journeyed by
                    water in these parts before, not between here and the rapids of <name type="PERSON">Sarn Gebir</name>. But
                    if I am <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght in my reckoning, those are still many miles ahead. Still there are
                    dangerous places even before we come there: rocks and stony eyots in the stream.
                    We must keep a sharp watch and not try to paddle swiftly.'</q></p>
            <p>To <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> in the leading boat was given the task of watchman. He lay forward pee<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng
                into the gloom. <name type="TIME">The <name type="TIME">night</name></name> grew dark, but the stars above were strangely b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght, and
                there was a glimmer On the face of the <name type="LOC">River</name>. It was close on <name type="TIME">mid<name type="TIME">night</name></name>, and they had
                been d<name type="GPE">ri</name>fting for some while. hardly using the paddles, when suddenly <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed out.
                <name type="QUANTITY">Only <name type="QUANTITY">a few yards</name></name> ahead dark shapes loomed up in the stream and he heard the swirl of
                racing water. There was a swift current which swung left, towards the eastern shore
                where the channel was clear. As they were swept aside the travellers could see, now
                very close, the pale foam of the <name type="LOC">River</name> lashing against sharp rocks that were thrust
                out far into the stream like a <name type="GPE">ri</name>dge of teeth. The boats were all huddled
                together.</p>
            <p>`<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>y there, <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>! <q>' shouted <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>, as his boat bumped into the leader. `This
                    is madness! We cannot dare the <name type="GPE">Rapids</name> by <name type="TIME">night</name>! But no boat can live in Sarn
                    Gebir, be it <name type="TIME">night</name> or <name type="DATE">day</name>.'</q></p>
            <p>`Back, back! ' c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. 'Turn! Turn if you can! ' He drove his paddle into the
                water, trying to hold the boat and b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng it round.</p>
            <p><q>'I am out of my reckoning,'</q> he said to <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'I did not know that we had
                    come so far: <name type="GPE">Anduin</name> flows faster than I thought. <name type="PERSON">Sarn Gebir</name> must be close at
                    hand already.'</q></p>
            <p>With great efforts they checked the boats and slowly brought them about; but at <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>
                they could make only small headway against the current, and all the time they were
                car<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed nearer and nearer to <name type="ORG">the eastern bank</name>. Now dark and ominous it loomed up in
                the <name type="TIME">night</name>.</p>
            <p><q>'All together, paddle! ' shouted <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>. 'Paddle! Or we shall be d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ven on the
                    shoals.'</q> Even as he spoke <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> felt the keel beneath him grate upon
                st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>.</p>
            <p>At that moment there was a t<name type="PERSON">wan</name>g of bowst<name type="GPE">ri</name>ngs: several arrows whistled over them,
                and some fell among them. <name type="CARDINAL">One</name> smote <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> between the shoulders and he lurched
                forward with a cry, letting go his paddle: but the arrow fell back. foiled by his
                hidden coat of mail. Another passed through <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>'s hood; and <name type="CARDINAL">a <name type="ORDINAL">third</name></name> stood fast
                in the gunwale of the <name type="ORG">sec</name>ond boat, close by <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>'s hand. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> thought he could
                glimpse black figures running to and fro upon the long shingle-banks that lay under
                the eastern shore. They seemed very near.</p>
            <p>`_Yrch!_' said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>, falling into his own tongue.</p>
            <p>`<name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s! ' c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>.</p>
            <p>`<name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>'s doing, I'll be bound.' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> to <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <name type="PERSON">`A</name>nd a nice place to choose, too.
                The <name type="LOC">River</name> seems set on taking us <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght into their arms! '</p>
            <p>They all leaned forward straining at the paddles: even <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> took a hand. Every moment
                they expected to feel the bite of black-feathered arrows. Many whined overhead or
                struck the water nearby; but there were no more hits. It was dark, but not too dark
                for the <name type="TIME">night</name>-eyes of <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s, and in the star-glimmer they must have offered their
                cunning foes some <name type="PERSON">mar</name>k, unless it was that the <name type="PERSON">grey cloaks</name> Of L�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en and the grey
                timber of the elf-wrought boats defeated the malice of the archers of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>.</p>
            <p>Stroke by stroke they laboured on. In the darkness it was hard to be sure that they
                were indeed moving at all; but slowly the swirl of the water grew less, and the
                shadow of <name type="ORG">the eastern bank</name> faded back into the <name type="TIME">night</name>. At last, as far as they could
                judge, they had reached the middle of the stream again and had d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ven their boats
                back some distance above the jutting rocks. Then <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> turning they thrust them with
                all their strength towards the western shore. Under the shadow Of <name type="PERSON">bush</name>es leaning out
                over the water they halted and drew breath.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> laid down his paddle and took up the bow that he had brought from L�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en.
                Then he sprang ashore and climbed a few paces up the bank. St<name type="GPE">ri</name>nging the bow and
                fitting an arrow he turned, pee<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng back over the <name type="LOC">River</name> into the darkness. Across
                the water there were sh<name type="GPE">ri</name>ll c<name type="GPE">ri</name>es, but nothing could be seen.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> looked up at the <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name> standing tall above him, as he gazed into the <name type="TIME">night</name>,
                seeking a <name type="PERSON">mar</name>k to shoot at. His head was dark, crowned with sharp white stars that
                glittered in the black pools of the sky behind. But now <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing and sailing up from
                the <name type="LOC">South</name> the great clouds advanced, sending out dark out<name type="GPE">ri</name>ders into the starry
                fields. A sudden dread fell on the <name type="ORG">Company</name>.</p>
            <p>`_<name type="PERSON">Elbereth</name> <name type="PERSON">Gilthoniel</name>!_' sighed <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> as he looked up. Even as he did so, a dark
                shape, like a cloud and yet not a cloud, for it moved far more swiftly, came out of
                the blackness in the <name type="LOC">South</name>, and sped towards the <name type="ORG">Company</name>, blotting out all light as
                it approached. Soon it appeared as a great winged creature, blacker than the pits in
                the <name type="TIME">night</name>. <name type="PERSON">Fierce</name> voices rose <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name> greet it from across the water. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> felt a
                sudden chill running through him and clut<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g at his heart; there was a deadly
                cold, like the memory of an old wound, in his shoulder. He crouched down, as if to
                hide.</p>
            <p>Suddenly the great bow of L�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en sang. <name type="PERSON">Sh<name type="GPE">ri</name>ll</name> went the arrow from the <name type="ORG">elven</name>-st<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng.
                <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> looked up. Almost above him the winged shape swerved. There was a harsh
                croaking scream, as it fell out of the air, vanishing down into the gloom of the
                eastern shore. The sky was clean again. There was a tumult of many voices far away,
                cursing and wailing in the darkness, and then silence. Neither shaft nor cry came
                again from the east that <name type="TIME">night</name>.</p>
            <p>After a while <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> led the boats back upstream. They felt their way along the
                water's edge for some distance, until they found a small shallow bay. A few low
                trees grew there close to the water, and behind them rose a steep rocky bank. Here
                the <name type="ORG">Company</name> decided to stay and await the <name type="TIME">dawn</name>: it was useless to attempt to move
                further by <name type="TIME">night</name>. They made no camp and lit no fire, but lay huddled in the boats,
                moored close together.</p>
            <p>
                <q>'Praised be the bow of <name type="PERSON">Galad<name type="GPE">ri</name>el</name>, and the hand and eye of <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>! ' said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>,
                    as he munched a wafer of _lembas_. 'That was a mighty shot in the dark, my
                    f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end!'</q>
            </p>
            <p><q>'But who can say what it hit?'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>.</p>
            <p><q>'I cannot,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. `But I am glad that the shadow came no nearer. I liked
                it not at all. Too much it reminded me of the shadow in <name type="GPE">Mo<name type="GPE">ri</name>a</name> � the shadow of the
                <name type="GPE">Balrog</name>,' he ended in a whisper.</p>
            <p><q>'It was not a <name type="GPE">Balrog</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, still shive<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng with the chill that had
                come upon him. <q>'It was something colder. I think it was -'</q> Then he paused and
                fell silent.</p>
            <p>'What do you think? ' asked <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> eagerly, leaning from his boat, as if he was
                trying to catch a glimpse of <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s face.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`I</name> think � No, I will not say,<q>' answered <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. `Whatever it was, its fall has
                    dismayed our enemies.'</q></p>
            <p>`So it seems,' said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <name type="PERSON">`Yet</name> where they are, and how many, and what they will do
                next, we do not know. <name type="TIME">This <name type="TIME">night</name></name> we must all be sleepless! Dark hides us now. But
                what the <name type="DATE">day</name> will show who can tell? Have your weapons close to hand! '</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> sat tapping the hilt of his sword as if he were counting on his fingers, and
                looking up at the sky. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>t's very strange,' he murmured. `The <name type="PERSON">Moon</name>'s the same in the
                <name type="LOC">Shire</name> and in <name type="PERSON">Wilderland</name>, or it ought to be. But either it's out of its running, or
                I'm all wrong in my reckoning. You'll remember, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, the <name type="PERSON">Moon</name> was <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ing as we
                lay on the flet up in that tree: <name type="DATE">a <name type="DATE">week</name></name> from the full, I reckon. And we'd been a
                <name type="DATE">week</name> on the way <name type="TIME">last <name type="TIME">night</name></name>, when up pops a New <name type="PERSON">Moon</name> as thin as a nail-pa<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng, as if
                we had never stayed no time in the <name type="PERSON">Elvish</name> country.</p>
            <p><name type="ORG">`Well</name>, I can remember <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> <name type="TIME">night</name>s there for certain, and I seem to remember several
                more, but I would take my oath it was never a whole month. Any<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> would think that
                time did not count in there! '</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`A</name>nd perhaps that was the way of it,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>n that land, maybe, we were in
                    a time that has elsewhere long g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> by. It was not, I think, until <name type="ORG">Silverlode</name>
                    bore us back to <name type="GPE">Anduin</name> that we returned to the time that flows through mortal
                    lands to the Great <name type="LOC">Sea</name>. And I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t remember any moon, either new or old, in

            <p><name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> stirred in his boat. `<name type="PERSON">Nay</name>, time does not tarry ever,<q>' he said; `but change
                    and growth is not in all things and places alike. For the <name type="ORG">Elves</name> the world moves,
                    and it moves both very swift and very slow. <name type="PERSON">Swift</name>, because they themselves
                    change little, and all else fleets by: it is a g<name type="GPE">ri</name>ef to them. Slow, because they
                    do not count <name type="DATE">the running <name type="DATE">year</name>s</name>, not for themselves. The passing seasons are but
                    <name type="GPE">ri</name>pples ever repeated in the long long stream. Yet beneath the <name type="ORG">Sun</name> all things
                    must wear to an end at last.'</q></p>
            <p>`But the wea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng is slow in L�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. `The power of the <name type="PERSON">Lady</name> is on it.
                    <name type="PERSON">Rich</name> are the <name type="TIME">hour</name>s, though short they seem, in <name type="ORG">Caras Galadhon</name>, where <name type="PERSON">Galad<name type="GPE">ri</name>el</name>

            <p><q>'That should not have been said outside L�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en, not even to me,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>.
                `Speak no more of it! But so it is, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>: in that land you lost your count. There
                time flowed swiftly by us, as for the <name type="ORG">Elves</name>. The old moon passed, and a new moon
                waxed and <name type="PERSON">wan</name>ed in the world outside, while we tar<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed there. And yestereve a new

                hope.'</p>
            <p><name type="TIME">The <name type="TIME">night</name></name> passed silently. No voice or call was heard again across the water. The
                travellers huddled in their boats felt the changing of the weather. The air grew
                warm and very still under the great moist clouds that had floated up from the <name type="LOC">South</name>
                and the distant seas. The rushing of the <name type="LOC">River</name> over the rocks of the rapids seemed
                to grow louder and closer. The twigs of the trees above them began to d<name type="GPE">ri</name>p.</p>
            <p>When the <name type="DATE">day</name> came the mood of the world about them had become soft and sad. Slowly
                the <name type="TIME">dawn</name> grew to a pale light, diffused and shadowless. There was mist on the <name type="LOC">River</name>,
                and white fog swathed the shore; the far bank could not be seen.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`I</name> can't abide fog,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>; `but this seems to be a lucky <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. Now perhaps we

            <p>`Perhaps so,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. `But it will be hard to find the path unless the fog
                    lifts a little later on. And we must find the path, if we are to pass <name type="PERSON">Sarn Gebir</name>
                    and come to the <name type="ORG">Emyn Muil</name>.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'I do not see why we should pass the <name type="GPE">Rapids</name> or follow the <name type="LOC">River</name> any further,'</q>

                down the Falls and land in the <name type="PERSON">mar</name>shes? '</p>
            <p>`No! <q>' answered <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. `Say rather that we will bear our boats by the ancient
                    way to <name type="PERSON">Rauros</name>-foot, and there take to the water again. Do you not know, <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>,
                    or do you choose to forget the <name type="LOC">North</name> Stair, and the high seat upon <name type="PERSON">Amon <name type="ORG">Hen</name></name>,
                    that were made in the <name type="DATE">day</name>s of the great kings? I at least have a mind to stand
                    in that high place again, before I decide my further course. There, maybe, we
                    shall see some sign that will guide us.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> held out long against this choice; but when it became plain that <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> would
                follow <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>, wherever he went, he gave in. <q>'It is not the way of the <name type="ORG">Men</name> of
                    Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name> to desert their f<name type="GPE">ri</name>ends at need,'</q> he said, `and you will need
                my strength, if ever you are to reach the Tindrock. To the tall isle I will go, but
                no further. There I shall turn to my home, al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> if my help has not earned the
                reward of any companionship.'</p>
            <p><name type="DATE">The <name type="DATE">day</name></name> was now growing, and the fog had lifted a little. It was decided that <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>
                and <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> should at once go forward along the shore, while the others remained by
                the boats. <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> hoped to find some way by which they could carry both their boats
                and their baggage to the smoother water beyond the <name type="GPE">Rapids</name>.</p>
            <p>`Boats of the <name type="ORG">Elves</name> would not sink, maybe,<q>' he said, `but that does not say that
                    we should come through <name type="PERSON">Sarn Gebir</name> alive. N<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> have ever <name type="PERSON">don</name>e so yet. No road was
                    made by the <name type="ORG">Men</name> of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> in this region, for even in their great <name type="DATE">day</name>s their
                    realm did not reach up <name type="GPE">Anduin</name> beyond the <name type="ORG">Emyn Muil</name>; but there is a portage-way
                    somewhere on the western shore, if I can find it. It cannot yet have pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>shed;
                    for light boats used to journey out of <name type="PERSON">Wilderland</name> down to <name type="NORP">Osgiliath</name>, and still
                    did so until <name type="DATE">a few <name type="DATE">year</name>s</name> ago, when the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> began to
                multiply.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Seldom in my life has any boat come out of the <name type="LOC">North</name>, and the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s prowl on the

            <p>`Pe<name type="GPE">ri</name>l lies ahead on every southward road,<q>' answered <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. `Wait for us <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>
                    <name type="DATE">day</name>. If we do not return in that time, you will know that evil has indeed
                    befallen us. Then you must take a new leader and follow him as best you
                    can.'</q></p>
            <p>It was with a heavy heart that <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> saw <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> and <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> climb the steep bank and
                vanish into the mists; but his fears proved groundless. <name type="CARDINAL">Only <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> or</name> <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> <name type="TIME">hour</name>s had
                passed, and it was barely mid-<name type="DATE">day</name>, when the shadowy shapes of the explorers appeared
                again.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`A</name>ll is well,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>, as he clambered down the bank. 'There is a track, and
                    it leads to a good landing that is still serviceable. The distance is not great:
                    the head of the <name type="GPE">Rapids</name> is but <name type="CARDINAL">half</name> <name type="QUANTITY">a mile</name> below us, and they are little more
                    than <name type="QUANTITY">a mile</name> long. Not far beyond them the stream becomes clear and smooth again,
                    though it runs swiftly. Our hardest task will be to get our boats and baggage to
                    the old portage-way. We have found it, but it lies well back from the water-side
                    here, and runs under <name type="PERSON">the lee</name> of a rock-wall, a furlong or more from the shore.
                    We did not find where the northward landing lies. If it still remains, we must
                    have passed it yester<name type="DATE">day</name> <name type="TIME">night</name>. We might labour far upstream and yet miss it in
                    the fog. I fear we must leave the <name type="LOC">River</name> now, and make for the portage-way as
                    best we can from here.'</q></p>
            <p>`That would not be easy, even if we were all <name type="ORG">Men</name>,' said <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`Yet</name> such as we are we will try it,' said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>.</p>
            <p><q>'Aye, we will,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. `The legs of <name type="ORG">Men</name> will lag on a rough road, while a
                <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Dwarf</name> goes on, be the burden twice his own w<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name>, Master <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>! '</p>
            <p>The task proved hard indeed, yet in the end it was <name type="PERSON">don</name>e. The goods were taken out of
                the boats and brought to the top of the bank, where there was a level space. Then
                the boats were drawn out of the water and car<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed up. They were far less heavy than
                any had expected. Of what tree growing in the elvish country they were made not even
                <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> knew; but the wood was tough and yet strangely light. <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>
                could carry their boat with ease along the flat. N<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>theless it needed the strength
                of the <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> <name type="ORG">Men</name> to lift and haul them over the ground that the <name type="ORG">Company</name> now had to
                cross. It sloped up away from the <name type="LOC">River</name>, a tumbled waste of grey limest<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>-boulders,
                with many hidden holes shrouded with weeds and <name type="PERSON">bush</name>es; there were thickets of
                brambles, and sheer <name type="ORG">dell</name>s; and here and there boggy pools <name type="ORG">fed</name> by waters t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ckling
                from the terraces further inland.</p>
            <p><name type="CARDINAL">One</name> by <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> and <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> car<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed the boats, while the others toiled and
                scrambled after them with the baggage. At last all was removed and laid on the
                portage-way. Then with little further hindrance, save from sprawling b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ars and many
                fallen st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>s, they moved forward all together. Fog still hung in veils upon the
                crumbling rock-wall, and to their left mist shrouded the <name type="LOC">River</name>: they could hear it
                rushing and foaming over the sharp shelves and stony teeth of <name type="PERSON">Sarn Gebir</name>, but they
                could not see it. Twice they made the journey, before all was brought safe to the
                southern landing.</p>
            <p>There the portage-way, turning back to the water-side, ran gently down to the shallow
                edge of a little pool. It seemed to have been scooped in the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver-side, not by
                hand, but by the water swirling down from <name type="PERSON">Sarn Gebir</name> against a low pier of rock that
                jutted out some way into the stream. Beyond it the shore rose sheer into a grey
                cliff, and there was no further passage for those on foot.</p>
            <p>Already the short <name type="TIME">after<name type="TIME">noon</name></name> was past, and a dim cloudy <name type="TIME">dusk</name> was closing in. They sat
                beside the water lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing to the confused rush and roar of the <name type="GPE">Rapids</name> hidden in the
                mist; they were tired and sleepy, and their hearts were as gloomy as the dying
                <name type="DATE">day</name>.</p>
            <p><q>'Well, here we are, and here we must pass <name type="TIME">another <name type="TIME">night</name></name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>. `We
                need sleep, and even if <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> had a mind to pass the <name type="FAC">Gate</name>s of <name type="PERSON">Argonath</name> by <name type="TIME">night</name>,
                we are all too tired-except, no doubt, our sturdy dwarf.'</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> made no reply: he was nodding as he sat.</p>
            <p>`Let us rest as much as we can now,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. `<name type="PERSON">Tom</name>orrow we must journey by
                    <name type="DATE">day</name> again. Unless the weather changes once more and cheats us, we shall have a
                    good chance of slipping through, unseen by any eyes on the eastern shore. But
                    to<name type="TIME">night</name> <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> must watch together in turns: <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> <name type="TIME">hour</name>s off and <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> on
                guard.'</q></p>
            <p>Nothing happened that <name type="TIME">night</name> worse than a b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ef d<name type="GPE">ri</name>zzle of rain <name type="TIME">an <name type="TIME">hour</name></name> before <name type="TIME">dawn</name>.
                As soon as it was fully light they started. Already the fog was thinning. They kept
                as close as they could to the western side, and they could see the dim shapes of the
                low cliffs <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing ever higher, shadowy walls with their feet in the hurrying <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver.
                In the <name type="TIME">mid-<name type="TIME">morning</name></name> the clouds drew down lower, and it began to rain heavily. They
                drew the skin-covers over their boats to prevent them from being flooded, and
                d<name type="GPE">ri</name>fted on: little could be seen before them or about them through the grey falling
                curtains.</p>
            <p>The rain, however, did not last long. Slowly the sky above grew lighter, and then
                suddenly the clouds broke, and their draggled f<name type="GPE">ri</name>nges trailed away northward up the
                <name type="LOC">River</name>. The fogs and mists were g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. Before the travellers lay a wide ravine, with
                great rocky sides to which clung, upon shelves and in narrow crevices, a few thrawn
                trees. The channel grew narrower and the <name type="LOC">River</name> swifter. Now they were speeding along
                with little hope of stopping or turning, whatever they might meet ahead. Over them
                was a lane of pale-blue sky, around them the dark overshadowed <name type="LOC">River</name>, and before
                them black, shutting out the sun, the hills of <name type="ORG">Emyn Muil</name>, in which no opening could
                be seen.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> pee<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng forward saw in the distance <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> great rocks approa<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g: like great
                pinnacles or pillars of st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> they seemed. Tall and sheer and ominous they stood
                upon either side of the stream. A narrow gap appeared between them, and the <name type="LOC">River</name>
                swept the boats towards it.</p>
            <p>`Behold the <name type="PERSON">Argonath</name>, the Pillars of the <name type="PERSON">Kin</name>gs! ' c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. `We shall pass them
                soon. Keep the boats in line, and as far apart as you can! <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>ld the middle of the
                stream! '</p>
            <p>As <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> was borne towards them the great pillars rose like towers to meet him.
                <name type="ORG">Giants</name> they seemed to him, vast grey figures silent but threa<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing. Then he saw
                that they were indeed shaped and fashi<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>d: the craft and power of old had wrought
                upon them, and still they preserved through the suns and rains of forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> <name type="DATE">year</name>s
                the mighty likenesses in which they had been hewn. Upon great pedestals founded in
                the deep waters stood <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> great kings of st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>: still with blurred eyes and <name type="ORG">crannied</name>
                brows they frowned upon the <name type="LOC">North</name>. The left hand of each was raised palm outwards in
                gesture of warning; in each <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght hand there was an axe; upon each head there was a
                crumbling helm and crown. Great power and majesty they still wore, the silent
                wardens of a long-vanished kingdom. Awe and fear fell upon <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, and he cowered
                down, shutting his eyes and not da<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng to look up as the boat drew near. Even
                <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> bowed his head as the boats whirled by. frail and fleeting as little leaves,
                under the endu<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng shadow of the sentinels of N�menor. So they passed into the dark
                chasm of the <name type="FAC">Gate</name>s.</p>
            <p>Sheer rose the dreadful cliffs to unguessed h<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name>s on either side. <name type="LOC">Far</name> off was the
                dim sky. The black waters roared and echoed, and a wind screamed over them. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>
                crou<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g over his knees heard <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> in front mutte<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng and groaning: `What a place!
                What a hor<name type="GPE">ri</name>ble place! Just let me get out of this boat, and I'll never wet my toes
                in a puddle again, let al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> a <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver! '</p>
            <p>`Fear not! ' said a strange voice behind him. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> turned and saw <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>, and yet
                not <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>; for the weatherworn <name type="PRODUCT">Ranger</name> was no longer there. In the stern sat
                <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> son of <name type="ORG">Arathorn</name>, proud and erect, guiding the boat with skilful strokes; his
                hood was cast back, and his dark <name type="PERSON">hai</name>r was blowing in the wind, a light was in his
                eyes: a king returning from exile to his own land.</p>
            <p>'Fear not! ' he said. `<name type="PERSON">Lo</name>ng have I desired to look upon the likenesses of <name type="ORG">Isildur</name> and
                An�<name type="GPE">ri</name>on, my sires of old. Under their shadow <name type="ORG">Elessar</name>, the <name type="PRODUCT">Elf</name>st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> son of <name type="ORG">Arathorn</name>

            <p>Then the light of his eyes faded, and he spoke to himself: `Would that <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> were
                here! <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w my heart <name type="DATE">year</name>ns for Minas <name type="GPE">Anor</name> and the walls of my own city! But whither
                now shall I go? '</p>
            <p>The chasm was long and dark, and filled with the noise of wind and rushing water and
                echoing st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. It bent somewhat towards the west so that at <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> all was dark
                ahead; but soon <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> saw a tall gap of light before him, ever growing. <name type="PERSON">Swift</name>ly it
                drew near, and suddenly the boats shot through, out into a wide clear light.</p>
            <p>The sun, already long fallen from the <name type="TIME">noon</name>, was shining in a windy sky. The pent
                waters spread out into a long oval lake, pale <name type="ORG">Nen Hithoel</name>, <name type="PERSON">fen</name>ced by steep grey
                hills whose sides were clad with trees, but their heads were bare, cold-gleaming in
                the sunlight. At the far southern end rose <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> peaks. The midmost stood somewhat
                forward from the others and sundered from them, an island in the waters, about which
                the flowing <name type="LOC">River</name> flung pale shimme<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng arms. Distant but deep there came up on the
                wind a roa<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng sound like the roll of thunder heard far away.</p>
            <p>`Behold Tol <name type="ORG">Brand</name>ir! <q>' said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>, pointing south to the tall peak. 'Upon the
                    left stands <name type="PERSON">Amon <name type="ORG">Lhaw</name></name>, and upon the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght is <name type="PERSON">Amon <name type="ORG">Hen</name></name> the <name type="ORG">Hill</name>s of Hea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng and

            <p>The <name type="ORG">Company</name> rested now for a while, d<name type="GPE">ri</name>fting south on the current that flowed through
                the middle of the lake. They ate some food, and then they took to their paddles and
                has<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed on their way. The sides of the westward hills fell into shadow, and the <name type="ORG">Sun</name>
                grew round and red. Here and there a misty star peered out. The <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> peaks loomed
                before them, darkling in the <name type="TIME">twilight</name>. <name type="PERSON">Rauros</name> was roa<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng with a great voice.

            <p><name type="DATE">The <name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>th <name type="DATE">day</name></name> of their journey was over. <name type="PERSON">Wilderland</name> was behind them. They could go no

            <p>The Breaking of the Fellowship</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> led them to the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght arm of the <name type="LOC">River</name>. Here upon its western side under the
                shadow of Tol <name type="ORG">Brand</name>ir a green lawn ran down to the water from the feet of <name type="PERSON">Amon <name type="ORG">Hen</name></name>.
                Behind it rose the <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> gentle slopes of the hill clad with trees, and trees
                <name type="PERSON">mar</name>ched away westward along the curving shores of the lake. <name type="DATE">A little sp<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng</name> fell
                tumbling down and <name type="ORG">fed</name> the grass.</p>
            <p><q>'Here we will rest to<name type="TIME">night</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. `This is the lawn of <name type="FAC">Parth Galen</name>: a
                fair place in the <name type="DATE">summer</name> <name type="DATE">day</name>s of old. Let us hope that no evil has yet come
                here.'</p>
            <p>They drew up their boats on <name type="ORG">the green bank</name>s, and beside them they made their camp.
                They set a watch, but had no sight nor sound of their enemies. If <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name> had
                cont<name type="GPE">ri</name>ved to follow them, he remained unseen and unheard. N<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>theless as the <name type="TIME">night</name>
                wore on <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> grew uneasy, tossing of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> in his sleep and waking. In the small
                <name type="TIME">hour</name>s he got up and came to <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, whose turn it was to watch.</p>
            <p>`Why are you waking? <q>' asked <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>t is not your watch.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`I</name> do not know,<q>' answered <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>; `but a shadow and a threat has been growing in
                    my sleep. It would be well to draw your sword.'</q></p>
            <p>`Why? ' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <name type="PERSON">`A</name>re enemies at hand? '</p>
            <p>`Let us see what <name type="PERSON">Sting</name> may show,' answered <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> then drew the elf-blade from its sheath. To his dismay the edges gleamed dimly
                in the <name type="TIME">night</name>. `<name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s! <q>' he said. `Not very near, and yet too near, it
                seems.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`I</name> feared as much,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. `But maybe they are not on this side of the
                    <name type="LOC">River</name>. The light of <name type="PERSON">Sting</name> is faint, and it may point to no more than spies of
                    <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> roaming on the slopes of <name type="PERSON">Amon <name type="ORG">Lhaw</name></name>. I have never heard before of <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s
                    upon <name type="PERSON">Amon <name type="ORG">Hen</name></name>. Yet who knows what may happen in these evil <name type="DATE">day</name>s, now that Minas
                    <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name> no longer holds <name type="ORG">sec</name>ure the passages of <name type="GPE">Anduin</name>. We must go wa<name type="GPE">ri</name>ly
                    to<name type="DATE">morrow</name>.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="DATE">The <name type="DATE">day</name></name> came like fire and smoke. <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>w in the <name type="LOC">East</name> there were black bars of cloud like
                the fumes of a great burning. The <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing sun lit them from beneath with flames of
                murky red; but soon it climbed above them into a clear sky. The summit of Tol
                <name type="ORG">Brand</name>ir was tipped with gold. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> looked out eastward and gazed at the tall
                island. Its sides sprang sheer out of the running water. High up above the tall
                cliffs were steep slopes upon which trees climbed, mounting <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> head above another;
                and above them again were grey faces of inaccessible rock, crowned by a great spire
                of st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. Many birds were circling about it, but no sign of other living things
                could be seen.</p>
            <p>When they had ea<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>, <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> called the <name type="ORG">Company</name> together. `<name type="DATE">The <name type="DATE">day</name></name> has come at
                    last,<q>' he said: 'the <name type="DATE">day</name> of choice which we have long delayed. What shall now
                    become of our <name type="ORG">Company</name> that has travelled so far in fellowship? Shall we turn
                    west with <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> and go to the wars of <name type="ORG">Gondor</name>; or turn east to the Fear and
                    <name type="PRODUCT">Shadow</name>; or shall we break our fellowship and go this way and that as each may
                    choose? Whatever we do must be <name type="PERSON">don</name>e soon. We cannot long halt here. The enemy is
                    on the eastern shore, we know; but I fear that the <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s may already be on this
                    side of the water.'</q></p>
            <p>There was a long silence in which no <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> spoke or moved.</p>
            <p><q>'Well, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> at last. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> fear that the burden is laid upon you.
                You are the <name type="ORG">Bear</name>er appointed by the <name type="ORG">Council</name>. Your own way you al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> can choose. In
                this matter I cannot advise you. I am not <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, and though I have t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed to bear
                his part, I do not know what design or hope he had for this <name type="TIME">hour</name>, if indeed he had
                any. Most likely it seems that if he were here now the choice would still wait on
                you. Such is your fate.'</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> did not answer at once. Then he spoke slowly. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> know that haste is needed, yet
                I cannot choose. The burden is heavy. Give me <name type="TIME">an <name type="TIME">hour</name></name> longer, and I will speak. Let
                me be al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>! '</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> looked at him with kindly pity. `Very well, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> son of <name type="ORG">Drogo</name>,<q>' he said.
                    `You shall have <name type="TIME">an <name type="TIME">hour</name></name>, and you shall be al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. We will stay here for a while.
                    But do not stray far or out of call.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> sat for a moment with his head bowed. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, who had been wat<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g his master
                with great concern, shook his head and muttered: <q>'<name type="LOC">Plain</name> as a pikestaff it is, but
                    it's no good <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> <name type="PERSON">Gamgee</name> putting in his spoke just now.'</q> ,</p>
            <p>Presently <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> got up and walked away; and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> saw that while the others restrained
                themselves and did not stare at him, the eyes of <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> followed <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> in<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>tly,
                until he passed out of sight in the trees at the foot of <name type="PERSON">Amon <name type="ORG">Hen</name></name>.</p>
            <p>Wande<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng aimlessly at <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> in the wood, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> found that his feet were leading him
                <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name>wards the slopes of the hill. He came to a path, the dwindling ruins of a road
                of <name type="DATE">long ago</name>. In steep places stairs of st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> had been hewn, but now they were
                cracked and worn, and split by the roots of trees. For some while he climbed, not
                ca<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng which way he went, until he came to a grassy place. <name type="PERSON">Ro<name type="PERSON">wan</name>-trees</name> grew about
                it, and in the midst was a wide flat st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. The little upland lawn was open upon the
                <name type="LOC">East</name> and was filled now with the early sunlight. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> halted and looked out over
                the <name type="LOC">River</name>, far below him, to Tol <name type="ORG">Brand</name>ir and the birds wheeling in the great <name type="LOC">gulf</name> of
                air between him and the untrodden isle. The voice of <name type="PERSON">Rauros</name> was a mighty roa<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng
                mingled with a deep throbbing boom.</p>
            <p>He sat down upon the st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> and cupped his <name type="PERSON">chin</name> in his hands, sta<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng eastwards but
                seeing little with his eyes. All that had happened since <name type="PERSON">Bilbo</name> left the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> was
                passing through his mind, and he recalled and pondered everything that he could
                remember of <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>'s words. <name type="PERSON">Tim</name>e went on, and still he was no nearer to a
                choice.</p>
            <p>Suddenly he awoke from his thoughts: a strange feeling came to him that something was
                behind him, that unf<name type="GPE">ri</name>endly eyes were upon him. He sprang up and turned; but all
                that he saw to his surp<name type="GPE">ri</name>se was <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>, and his face was smiling and kind.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`I</name> was afraid for you, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>,<q>' he said, coming forward. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>f <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> is <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght and
                    <name type="PRODUCT">Orc</name>s are near, then n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of us should <name type="PERSON">wan</name>der al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, and you least of all: so
                    much depends on you. And my heart too is heavy. <name type="DATE">May</name> I stay now and talk for a
                    while, since I have found you? It would comfort me. Where there are so many, all
                    speech becomes a debate without end. But <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> together may perhaps find
                    wisdom.'</q></p>
            <p>`You are kind,<q>' answered <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. 'But I do not think that any speech will help me.
                    For I know what I should do, but I am afraid of doing it, <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>:
                afraid.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> stood silent. <name type="PERSON">Rauros</name> roared endlessly on. The wind murmured in the branches
                of the trees. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> shivered.</p>
            <p>Suddenly <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> came and sat beside him. <name type="PERSON">`A</name>re you sure that you do not suffer
                needlessly? ' he said. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> wish to help you. You need counsel in your hard choice.
                Will you not take mine? '</p>
            <p><q>'I think I know already what counsel you would give, <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.
                    <q>'And it would seem like wisdom but for the warning of my heart.'</q></p>
            <p>`Warning? Warning against what? ' said <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> sharply.</p>
            <p>
                <q>'Against delay. Against the way that seems easier. Against refusal of the burden
                    that is laid on me. Against-well, if it must be said, against trust in the
                    strength and truth of <name type="ORG">Men</name>.'</q>
            </p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`Yet</name> that strength has long protected you far away in your little country, though you
                knew it not.'</p>
            <p>'I do not doubt the valour of your people. But the world is changing. The walls of
                Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name> may be strong, but they are not strong enough. If they fail, what then?
                '</p>
            <p>
                <q>'We shall fall in battle valiantly. Yet there is still hope that they will not
                    fail.'</q>
            </p>
            <p><q>'No hope while the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> lasts,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.</p>
            <p>'Ah! The <name type="ORG">Ring</name>! ' said <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>, his eyes lighting. 'The <name type="ORG">Ring</name>! Is it not a strange fate
                that we should suffer so much fear and doubt for so small a thing? So small a thing!
                And I have seen it only for an instant in the <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>use of <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name>. Could I not have a
                sight of it again? '</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> looked up. His heart went suddenly cold. He caught the strange gleam in
                <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>'s eyes, yet his face was still kind and f<name type="GPE">ri</name>endly. <q>'It is best that it
                    should lie hidden,'</q> he answered.</p>
            <p><q>'As you wish. I care not,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>. 'Yet may I not even speak of it? For
                you seem ever to think only of its power in the hands of the Enemy: of its evil uses
                not of its good. The world is changing, you say. Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name> will fall, if the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>
                lasts. But why? Certainly, if the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> were with the Enemy. But why, if it were with
                us? '</p>
            <p>
                <q>'Were you not at the <name type="ORG">Council</name>? ' answered <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. `Because we cannot use it, and
                    what is <name type="PERSON">don</name>e with it turns to evil.'</q>
            </p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> got up and walked about impatiently. <q>'So you go on,'</q> he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed.
                    <q>'<name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name>, <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name> � all these folk have taught you to say so. For themselves
                    they may be <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght. These elves and <name type="CARDINAL">half</name>-elves and wizards, they would come to
                    g<name type="GPE">ri</name>ef perhaps. Yet of<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> I doubt if they are wise and not merely timid. But each
                    to his own kind. True<name type="PERSON">-he</name>arted <name type="ORG">Men</name>, they will not be corrupted. We of Minas
                    <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name> have been staunch through <name type="DATE">long <name type="DATE">year</name>s</name> of t<name type="GPE">ri</name>al. We do not desire the power
                    of wizard-lords, only strength to de<name type="PERSON">fen</name>d ourselves, strength in a just cause.
                    And behold! in our need chance b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ngs to light the -<name type="ORG">Ring</name> of <name type="ORG">Power</name>. It is a gift,
                    I say; a gift to the foes of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>. It is mad not to use it, to use the power
                    of the Enemy against him. The fearless, the ruthless, these al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> will achieve
                    victory. What could not a war<name type="GPE">ri</name>or do in this <name type="TIME">hour</name>, a great leader? What could
                    not <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> do? Or if he refuses, why not <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>? The <name type="ORG">Ring</name> would give me power
                    of Command. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w I would d<name type="GPE">ri</name>ve the hosts of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>, and all men would flock to my
                    banner!'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> strode up and down, speaking ever more loudly: Almost he seemed to have
                forgot<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name> <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, while his talk dwelt on walls and weapons, and the muste<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng of
                men; and he drew plans for great alliances and glo<name type="GPE">ri</name>ous victo<name type="GPE">ri</name>es to be; and he cast
                down <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>, and became himself a mighty king, benevolent and wise. Suddenly he
                stopped and waved his arms.</p>
            <p><q>'And they tell us to throw it away!'</q> he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> do not say _destroy_ it.
                That might be well, if reason could show any hope of doing so. It does not. The only
                plan that is proposed to us is that a <name type="CARDINAL">half</name>ling should walk blindly into <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> and
                offer the Enemy every chance of recaptu<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng it for himself. <name type="PERSON">Folly</name>!</p>
            <p><q>'Surely you see it, my f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end?'</q> he said, turning now suddenly to <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> again.
                `You say that you are afraid. If it is so, the boldest should par<name type="PERSON">don</name> you. But is it
                not really your good sense that revolts?'</p>
            <p><q>'No, I am afraid,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <q>'Simply afraid. But I am glad to have heard
                    you speak so fully. My mind is clearer now.'</q></p>
            <p>`Then you will come to Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name>? ' c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>. His eyes were shining and his
                face eager.</p>
            <p>`You misunderstand me,' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>.</p>
            <p><q>'But you will come, at least for a while? ' <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> persisted. 'My city is not far
                    now; and it is little further from there to <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name> than from here. We have been
                    long in the wilderness, and you need news of what the Enemy is doing before you
                    make a move. Come with me, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>,'</q> he said. `You need rest before your
                venture. if go you must.' He laid his hand on the hobbit's shoulder in f<name type="GPE">ri</name>endly
                fashion; but <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> felt the hand trembling with suppressed excitement. He stepped
                quickly away, and eyed with alarm the tall Man, nearly twice his h<name type="CARDINAL">eight</name> and many
                times his match in strength.</p>
            <p>`Why are you so unf<name type="GPE">ri</name>endly? ' said <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> am a true man, neither thief nor
                tracker. I need your <name type="ORG">Ring</name>: that you know now; but I give you my word that I do not
                desire to keep it. Will you not at least let me make t<name type="GPE">ri</name>al of my plan? Lend me the
                <name type="ORG">Ring</name>! '</p>
            <p>`No! no! <q>' c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. 'The <name type="ORG">Council</name> laid it upon me to bear it.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`I</name>t is by our own folly that the Enemy will defeat us,' c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>. `<name type="PERSON">Ho</name>w it angers
                me! Fool! Obstinate fool! Running wilfully to death and ruining our cause. If any
                mortals have claim to the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>, it is the men of N�menor, and not <name type="PERSON">Hal</name>flings. It is
                not yours save by unhappy chance. It might have been mine. It should be mine. Give
                it to me! '</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> did not answer, but moved away till the great flat st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> stood between them.
                `Come, come, my f<name type="GPE">ri</name>end! <q>' said <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> in a softer voice. 'Why not get <name type="GPE">ri</name>d of it?
                    Why not be free of your doubt and fear? You can lay the blame on me, if you
                    will. You can say that I was too strong and took it by force. For I am too
                    strong for you, <name type="CARDINAL">half</name>ling,'</q> he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed; and suddenly he sprang over the st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>
                and leaped at <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. His fair and pleasant face was hideously changed; a raging fire
                was in his eyes.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> dodged aside and again put the st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> between them. There was only <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> thing he
                could do: trembling he pulled out the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> upon its c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>n and quickly slipped it on
                his finger, even as <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> sprang at him again. The Man gasped, stared for a moment
                amazed, and then ran wildly about, seeking here and there among the rocks and
                trees.</p>
            <p><q>'Miserable t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ckster!'</q> he shouted. `Let me get my hands on you! Now I see your
                mind. You will take the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> to <name type="ORG">Sauron</name> and sell us all. You have only waited your
                chance to leave us in the lurch. Curse you and all <name type="CARDINAL">half</name>lings to death and darkness!
                ' Then, cat<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g his foot on a st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>, he fell sprawling and lay upon his face. For a
                while he was as still as if his own curse had struck him down; then suddenly he
                wept.</p>
            <p>He rose and passed his hand over his eyes, dashing away the tears. 'What have I said?
                ' he c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed. `What have I <name type="PERSON">don</name>e? <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>! ' he called. 'Come back! A madness took
                me, but it has passed. Come back! '</p>
            <p>There was no answer. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> did not even hear his c<name type="GPE">ri</name>es. He was already far away,
                leaping blindly up the path to the hill-top. Terror and g<name type="GPE">ri</name>ef shook him, seeing in
                his thought the mad fierce face of <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>, and his burning eyes.</p>
            <p>Soon he came out al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> on the summit of <name type="PERSON">Amon <name type="ORG">Hen</name></name>, and halted, gasping for breath. He
                saw as through a mist a wide flat circle, paved with mighty flags, and surrounded
                with a crumbling battlement; and in the middle, set upon <name type="CARDINAL">four</name> <name type="PERSON">carven</name> pillars, was a
                high seat, reached by a stair of many steps. Up he went and sat upon the ancient
                c<name type="PERSON">hai</name>r, feeling like a lost child that had clambered upon the thr<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of
                mountain-kings.</p>
            <p>At <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> he could see little. He seemed to be in a world of mist in which there were
                only shadows: the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> was upon him. Then here and there the mist gave way and he
                saw many visions: small and clear as if they were under his eyes upon a table, and
                yet remote. There was no sound, only b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght living images. The world seemed to have
                shrunk and fallen silent. He was sitting upon the <name type="LOC">Sea</name>t of Seeing, on <name type="PERSON">Amon <name type="ORG">Hen</name></name>, the
                <name type="ORG">Hill</name> of the <name type="PRODUCT">Eye</name> of the <name type="ORG">Men</name> of N�menor. <name type="LOC">East</name>ward he looked into wide uncharted lands,
                nameless plains, and forests unexplored. <name type="LOC">North</name>ward he looked, and the <name type="LOC">Great <name type="LOC">River</name></name>
                lay like a <name type="GPE">ri</name>bbon beneath him, and the <name type="LOC">Misty <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s</name> stood small and hard as
                broken teeth. <name type="LOC">West</name>ward he looked and saw the broad pastures of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>; and <name type="PERSON">Orthanc</name>,
                the pinnacle of <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard, like a black spike. <name type="LOC">South</name>ward he looked, and below his
                very feet the <name type="LOC">Great <name type="LOC">River</name></name> curled like a toppling wave and plunged over <name type="DATE">the fall</name>s of
                <name type="PERSON">Rauros</name> into a foaming pit; a glimme<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng rainbow played upon the fume. And <name type="ORG">Ethir</name>
                <name type="GPE">Anduin</name> he saw, the mighty delta of the <name type="LOC">River</name>, and my<name type="GPE">ri</name>ads of sea-birds whirling like
                a white dust in the sun, and beneath them a green and silver sea, <name type="GPE">ri</name>ppling in
                endless lines.</p>
            <p>But everywhere he looked he saw the signs of war. The <name type="LOC">Misty <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s</name> were crawling
                like anthills: orcs were issuing out of <name type="CARDINAL">a thousand</name> holes. Under the boughs of
                <name type="GPE">Mirkwood</name> there was deadly st<name type="GPE">ri</name>fe of <name type="ORG">Elves</name> and <name type="ORG">Men</name> and fell beasts. The land of the
                <name type="ORG">Beorn</name>ings was aflame; a cloud was over <name type="GPE">Mo<name type="GPE">ri</name>a</name>; smoke rose on the borders of
                L�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Ho</name>rsemen were galloping on the grass of <name type="PERSON">Rohan</name>; wolves poured from <name type="PERSON">Isen</name>gard. From the
                havens of <name type="ORG">Harad</name> ships of war put out to sea; and out of the <name type="LOC">East</name> <name type="ORG">Men</name> were moving
                endlessly: swordsmen, spearmen, bowmen upon horses, cha<name type="GPE">ri</name>ots of chieftains and laden
                <name type="PERSON">wain</name>s. All the power of the Dark <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd was in motion. Then turning south again he
                beheld Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name>. <name type="LOC">Far</name> away it seemed. and beautiful: white-walled, many-towered,
                proud and fair upon its mountain-seat; its battlements glittered with steel, and its
                turrets were b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ght with many banners. <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>pe leaped in his heart. But against Minas
                <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name> was set another fortress, greater and more strong. Thither, eastward,
                unwilling his eye was drawn. It passed the ruined b<name type="GPE">ri</name>dges of <name type="NORP">Osgiliath</name>, the g<name type="GPE">ri</name>nning
                gates of Minas <name type="PERSON">Morgul</name>. and the haunted <name type="LOC">Mountain</name>s, and it looked upon <name type="PERSON">Gorgoroth</name>, the
                valley of terror in the Land of <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>. <name type="PRODUCT">Darkness</name> lay there under the <name type="ORG">Sun</name>. <name type="ORG">Fire</name>
                glowed amid the smoke. <name type="LOC">Mount Doom</name> was burning, and a great <name type="GPE">reek</name> <name type="GPE">ri</name>sing. Then at last
                his gaze was held: wall upon wall, battlement upon battlement, black, immeasurably
                strong, mountain of iron, gate of steel, tower of adamant, he saw it: <name type="FAC">Barad-d</name>�r,
                Fortress of <name type="ORG">Sauron</name>. All hope left him.</p>
            <p>And suddenly he felt the <name type="PRODUCT">Eye</name>. There was an eye in the Dark <name type="FAC">Tower</name> that did not sleep.
                He knew that it had become aware of his gaze. A fierce eager will was there. It
                leaped towards him; almost like a finger he felt it, sear<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g for him. Very soon it
                would nail him down, know just exactly where he was. <name type="PERSON">Amon <name type="ORG">Lhaw</name></name> it touched. It
                glanced upon Tol <name type="ORG">Brand</name>ir he threw himself from the seat, crou<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g, cove<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng his
                head with his grey hood.</p>
            <p>He heard himself crying out: _Never, never!_Or was it: _Ve<name type="GPE">ri</name>ly I come, I come to
                you_? He could not tell. Then as a flash from some other point of power there came
                to his mind another thought: _Take it off! Take it off! Fool, take it off! Take off
                the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>!_</p>
            <p>The <name type="CARDINAL">two</name> powers strove in him. For a moment, perfectly balanced between their piercing
                points, he w<name type="GPE">ri</name>thed, tormented. Suddenly he was aware of himself again. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>,
                neither the Voice nor the <name type="PRODUCT">Eye</name>: free to choose, and with <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> remaining instant in
                which to do so. He took the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> off his finger. He was kneeling in clear sunlight
                before the high seat. A black shadow seemed to pass like an arm above him; it missed
                <name type="PERSON">Amon <name type="ORG">Hen</name></name> and groped out west, and faded. Then all the sky was clean and blue and
                birds sang in every tree.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> rose to his feet. A great wea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ness was on him, but his will was firm and his
                heart lighter. He spoke aloud to himself. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> will do now what I must,<q>' he said.
                    'This at least is plain: the evil of the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> is already at work even in the
                    <name type="ORG">Company</name>, and the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> must leave them before it does more harm. I will go al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>.
                    Some I cannot trust, and those I can trust are too dear to me: poor old <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, and
                    <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> and <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>, too: his heart <name type="DATE">year</name>ns for Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name>, and he will
                    be needed there, now <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> has fallen into evil. I will go al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. At
                    once.'</q></p>
            <p>He went quickly down the path and came back to the lawn where <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> had found him.
                Then he halted, lis<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ing. He thought he could hear c<name type="GPE">ri</name>es and calls from the woods
                near the shore below.</p>
            <p><q>'They'll be hunting for me,'</q> he said. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> wonder how long I have been away.
                <name type="PERSON">Ho</name>urs, I should think.<q>' He hesitated. 'What can I do? ' he muttered. 'I must go
                    now or I shall never go. I shan't get a chance again. I hate leaving them, and
                    like this without any explanation. But surely they will understand. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> will.
                    And what else can I do?'</q></p>
            <p>Slowly he drew out the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> and put it on once more. He vanished and passed down the
                hill, less than a rustle of the wind.</p>
            <p>The others remained long by the <name type="GPE">ri</name>ver-side. For some time they had been silent,
                moving restlessly about; but now they were sitting in a circle, and they were
                talking. Every now and again they made efforts to speak of other things, of their
                long road and many adventures; they questi<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>d <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> concerning the realm of
                <name type="ORG">Gondor</name> and its ancient history, and the remnants of its great works that could still
                be seen in this strange border-land of the <name type="ORG">Emyn Muil</name>: the st<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> kings and the seats
                of <name type="ORG">Lhaw</name> and <name type="ORG">Hen</name>, and the great Stair beside <name type="DATE">the fall</name>s of <name type="PERSON">Rauros</name>. But always their
                thoughts and words strayed back to <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and the <name type="ORG">Ring</name>. What would <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> choose to
                do? Why was he hesitating?</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`He</name> is debating which course is the most desperate, I think,' said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. 'And well
                he may. It is now more hopeless than ever for the <name type="ORG">Company</name> to go east, since we have
                been tracked by <name type="PERSON">Gollum</name>, and must fear that the <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret of our journey is already
                betrayed. But Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name> is no nearer to the <name type="ORG">Fire</name> and the destruction of the
                <name type="PERSON">Burden</name>.</p>
            <p>`We may remain there for a while and make a brave stand; but the <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>rd <name type="PERSON">Denethor</name> and
                all his men cannot hope to do what even <name type="PERSON">Elrond</name> said was beyond his power: either to
                keep the <name type="PERSON">Burden</name> <name type="ORG">sec</name>ret. or to hold off the full might of the Enemy when he comes to
                take it. Which way would any of us choose in <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>'s place? I do not know. Now
                indeed we miss <name type="PERSON">Gandalf</name> most.'</p>
            <p><q>'G<name type="GPE">ri</name>evous is our loss,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. <q>'Yet we must needs make up our minds
                    without his aid. Why cannot we decide, and so help <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>? Let us call him back
                    and then vote! I should vote for Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name>.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`A</name>nd so should I,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>. 'We, of course, were only sent to help the <name type="ORG">Bear</name>er
                    along the road, to go no further than we wished; and n<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of us is under any
                    oath or command to seek <name type="LOC">Mount Doom</name>. Hard was my parting from <name type="PERSON">Lo</name>thl�<name type="GPE">ri</name>en. Yet I
                    have come so far, and I say this: now we have reached the last choice, it is
                    clear to me that I cannot leave <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. I would choose Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name>, but if he
                    does not, then I follow him.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`A</name>nd I too will go with him,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name>. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>t would be faithless now to say
                    farewell.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'It would indeed be a betrayal, if we all left him,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <q>'But if
                    he goes east, then all need not go with him; nor do I think that all should.
                    That venture is desperate: as much so for <name type="CARDINAL">eight</name> as for <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> or <name type="CARDINAL">two</name>, or <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>
                    al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. If you would let me choose, then I should appoint <name type="CARDINAL">three</name> companions: <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>,
                    who could not bear it otherwise; and <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name>; and myself. <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> will return to
                    his own city, where his father and his people need him; and with him the others
                    should go, or at least <name type="PERSON">Me<name type="GPE">ri</name>adoc</name> and <name type="PERSON">Pereg<name type="GPE">ri</name>n</name>, if <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> is not willing to leave
                    us.'</q></p>
            <p>`That won't do at all! <q>' c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. 'We can't leave <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>! <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> and I always
                    in<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ded to go wherever he went, and we still do. But we did not realize what
                    that would mean. It seemed different so far away, in the <name type="LOC">Shire</name> or in <name type="ORG">Riven<name type="ORG">dell</name></name>.
                    It would be mad and cruel to let <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> go to <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>. Why can't we stop

            <p><q>'We must stop him,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. <name type="PERSON">`A</name>nd that is what he is worrying about, I am

                    shuddered. 'But the dear silly old hobbit, he ought to know that he hasn't got
                    to ask. He ought to know that if we can't stop him, we shan't leave
                him.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Begging your par<name type="PERSON">don</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <q>'I <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t think you understand my master at
                    all. He isn't hesitating about which way to go. Of course not! What's the good
                    of Minas <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name> anyway? To him, I mean, begging your par<name type="PERSON">don</name>, Master
                    <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>,'</q> he added, and turned. It was then that they discovered that
                <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>, who at <name type="ORDINAL">first</name> had been sitting silent on the outside of the circle, was no
                longer there.</p>
            <p>`Now where's he got to? <q>' c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, looking wor<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed. 'He's been a bit queer
                    lately, to my mind. But anyway he's not in this business. He's off to his home,
                    as he always said; and no blame to him. But Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, he knows he's got to find
                    the <name type="WORK_OF_ART">Cracks of Doom</name>, if he can. But he's _afraid_. Now it's come to the point,
                    he's just plain ter<name type="GPE">ri</name>fied. That's what his trouble is. Of course he's had a bit
                    of schooling, so to speak-we all have-since we left home, or he'd be so
                    ter<name type="GPE">ri</name>fied he'd just fling the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> in the <name type="LOC">River</name> and bolt. But he's still too
                    f<name type="GPE">ri</name>gh<name type="CARDINAL">ten</name>ed to start. And he isn't worrying about us either: whether we'll go
                    along with him or no. He knows we mean to. That's another thing that's bothe<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng
                    him. If he screws himself <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name> go, he'll <name type="PERSON">wan</name>t to go al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. <name type="PERSON">Mark</name> my words! We're
                    going to have trouble when he comes back. For he'll screw himself up all <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght,
                    as sure as his name's <name type="PERSON">Baggins</name>.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'I believe you speak more wisely than any of us, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <name type="PERSON">`A</name>nd what

            <p>'Stop him! <name type="PERSON">Don</name>'t let him go! ' c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>.</p>
            <p>
                <q>'I wonder? ' said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. <name type="PERSON">`He</name> is the <name type="ORG">Bear</name>er, and the fate of the <name type="PERSON">Burden</name> is on

                    do I think that we should succeed, if we t<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed. There are other powers at work
                    far stronger.'</q>

            <p><name type="ORG">`Well</name>, I wish <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> would "screw himself up" and come back. and let us get it over,'
                said <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. `This waiting is hor<name type="GPE">ri</name>ble! Surely the time is up? '</p>

            <p>At that moment <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> reappeared. He came out from the trees and walked towards them
                without speaking. His face looked g<name type="GPE">ri</name>m and sad. He paused as if counting those that
                were present, and then sat down aloof, with his eyes on the ground.</p>
            <p>`Where have you been, <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>? ' asked <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. `Have you seen <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>? '</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> hesitated for a <name type="ORG">sec</name>ond. `Yes, and no,<q>' he answered slowly. `Yes: I found
                    him some way up the hill, and I spoke to him. I urged him to come to Minas
                    <name type="ORG">Ti<name type="GPE">ri</name>th</name> and not to go east. I grew angry and he left me. He vanished. I have

                    must have put the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> on. I could not find him again. I thought he would return
                    to you.'</q></p>
            <p>'Is that all that you have to say? ' said <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>, looking hard and not too kindly at
                <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>.</p>
            <p>`Yes,<q>' he answered. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> will say no more yet.'</q></p>
            <p>`This is bad!<q>' c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, jumping up. <name type="PERSON">`I</name> <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t know what this Man has been <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name>.
                    Why should Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> put the thing on? He didn't ought to have; and if he has,
                    goodness knows what may have happened!'</q></p>
            <p>
                <q>'But he wouldn't keep it on`' said <name type="PERSON">Merry</name>. `Not when he had escaped the unwelcome

            </p>
            <p>`But where did he go? Where is he? <q>' c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name>. 'He's been away ages

            <p>`<name type="PERSON">Hal</name>f <name type="TIME">an <name type="TIME">hour</name></name>, maybe,' he answered. `Or it might be <name type="TIME">an <name type="TIME">hour</name></name>. I have <name type="PERSON">wan</name>dered for some
                time since. I do not know! I do not know! ' He put his head in his hands, and sat as

            <p>`<name type="TIME">An <name type="TIME">hour</name></name> since he vanished! ' shouted <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. `We must try and find him at once. Come

                hold on! Wait! '</p>
            <p>It was no good. They took no notice of him. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> had dashed off <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>. <name type="PERSON">Merry</name> and
                <name type="PERSON">Pippin</name> had followed, and were already disappea<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng westward into the trees by the
                shore, shouting: _<name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>! <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>!_ in their clear, high hobbit-voices. <name type="PERSON">Legolas</name> and
                <name type="PERSON">Gimli</name> were running. A sudden panic or madness seemed to have fallen on the
                <name type="ORG">Company</name>.</p>
            <p>`We shall all be scattered and lost,<q>' groaned <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name>. `<name type="PERSON">Boromir</name>! I do not know
                    what part you have played in this mischief, but help now! Go after those <name type="CARDINAL">two</name>
                    young hobbits, and guard them at the least, even if you cannot find <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. Come
                    back to this spot, if you find him, or any traces of him. I shall return
                    soon.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> sprang swiftly away and went in pursuit of <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. Just as he reached the little
                lawn among the <name type="PERSON">ro<name type="PERSON">wan</name></name>s he overtook him, toiling uphill, panting and calling,
                _<name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>!_</p>
            <p>`Come with me, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>! ' he said. `N<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> of us should be al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. There is mischief about.
                I feel it. I am going to the top, to the <name type="LOC">Sea</name>t of <name type="PERSON">Amon <name type="ORG">Hen</name></name>, to see what may be seen.
                And look! It is as my heart guessed, <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> went this way. Follow me, and keep your
                eyes open! ' He sped up the path.</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> did his best, but he could not keep up with <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name> the <name type="PRODUCT">Ranger</name>, and soon fell
                behind. He had not g<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> far before <name type="PERSON">Aragorn</name> was out of sight ahead. <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> stopped and
                puf<name type="ORG">fed</name>. Suddenly he clapped his hand to his head.</p>
            <p>`Whoa, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> <name type="PERSON">Gamgee</name>! <q>' he said aloud. `Your legs are too short, so use your head!
                    Let me see now! <name type="PERSON">Boromir</name> isn't lying, that's not his way; but he hasn't told us
                    everything. Something scared Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> badly. He screwed himself <name type="CARDINAL">up to</name> the
                    point, sudden. He made up his mind at last to go. Where to? Off <name type="LOC">East</name>. Not
                    without <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>? Yes, without even his <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. That's hard, cruel hard.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> passed his hand over his eyes, brushing away the tears. '<name type="PERSON">Steady</name>, <name type="PERSON">Gamgee</name>! ' he
                said. `Think, if you can! He can't fly across <name type="GPE">ri</name>vers, and he can't jump waterfalls.
                He's got no gear. So he's got to get back to the boats. Back to the boats! Back to
                the boats, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, like lightning! '</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Sam</name> turned and bolted back down the path. He fell and cut his knees. Up he got and
                ran on. He came to the edge of the lawn of <name type="FAC">Parth Galen</name> by the shore, where the boats
                were drawn up out of the water. No <name type="CARDINAL">one</name> was there. There seemed to be c<name type="GPE">ri</name>es in the
                woods behind, but he did not heed them. He stood gazing for a moment. stock-still,
                gaping. A boat was sliding down the bank all by itself. With a shout <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> raced
                across the grass. The boat slipped into the water.</p>
            <p>`Coming, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>! Coming! ' called <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>, and flung himself from the bank, clut<name type="PERSON">chin</name>g
                at the departing boat. He missed it by a yard. With a cry and a splash he fell face
                downward into deep swift water. Gurgling he went under, and the <name type="LOC">River</name> closed over
                his curly head.</p>
            <p>An exclamation of dismay came from the empty boat. A paddle swirled and the boat put
                about. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> was just in time to grasp <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> by the <name type="PERSON">hai</name>r as he came up, bubbling and
                struggling. Fear was sta<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng in his round brown eyes.</p>
            <p>`Up you come, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> my lad! ' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. `Now take my hand! '</p>
            <p>`Save me, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>! <q>' gasped <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>'m drownded. I can't see your hand.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`He</name>re it is. <name type="PERSON">Don</name>'t pinch, lad! I won't let you go. Tread water and <name type="PERSON">don</name>'t flounder, or
                you'll upset the boat. There now, get hold of the side, and let me use the paddle!
                '</p>
            <p>With a few strokes <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> brought the boat back to the bank. and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> was able to
                scramble out, wet as a water-rat. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> took off the <name type="ORG">Ring</name> and stepped ashore
                again.</p>
            <p>`Of all the confounded nuisances you are the worst, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>! ' he said.</p>
            <p>'Oh, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, that's hard! ' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> shive<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng. `That's hard, trying to go without
                me and all. If I hadn't a guessed <name type="GPE">ri</name>ght, where would you be now? '</p>
            <p>`Safely on my way.'</p>
            <p>`Safely! <q>' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. <name type="PERSON">`A</name>ll al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name> and without me to help you? I couldn't have a

            <p><q>'It would be the death of you to come with me, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>,'</q> said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and I could
                not have borne that.'</p>
            <p>`Not as certain as being left behind,' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>.</p>
            <p>`But I am going to <name type="PERSON">Mordor</name>.'</p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">`I</name> know that well enough, Mr. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. Of course you are. And I'm coming with you.'</p>
            <p>`Now, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>,<q>' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>, `<name type="PERSON">don</name>'t hinder me! The others will be coming back at any
                    minute. If they catch me here. I shall have to argue and explain, and I shall
                    never have the heart or the chance to get off. But I must go at once. It's the
                    only way.'</q></p>
            <p>`Of course it is,<q>' answered <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. 'But not al<name type="CARDINAL">one</name>. I'm coming too, or neither of us
                    isn't going. I'll knock holes in all the boats <name type="ORDINAL">first</name>.'</q></p>
            <p><name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> actually laughed. A sudden warmth and gladness touched his heart. `Leave <name type="CARDINAL">one</name>!
                    <q>'he said. `We'll need it. But you can't come like this without your gear or
                    food or anything.'</q></p>
            <p><q>'Just hold on a moment, and I'll get my stuff!'</q> c<name type="GPE">ri</name>ed <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> eagerly. <q>'It's
                    all ready. I thought we should be off to<name type="DATE">day</name>.'</q> He rushed to the camping
                place, fished out his pack from the pile where <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> had laid it when he emptied the
                boat of his companions' goods grabbed a spare blanket, and some extra packages of
                food, and ran back.</p>
            <p>`So all my plan is spoilt! <q>' said <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. <name type="PERSON">`I</name>t is no good trying to escape you. But
                    I'm glad, <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>. I cannot tell you how glad. Come along! It is plain that we were
                    meant to go together. We will go, and may the others find a safe road! <name type="PRODUCT">St<name type="GPE">ri</name>der</name>

            <p><name type="PERSON">`Yet</name> we may, Mr <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name>. We may,' said <name type="PERSON">Sam</name>.</p>
            <p>So <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> and <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> set off on the last stage of the <name type="PRODUCT">Quest</name> together. <name type="PERSON">Frodo</name> paddled away
                from the shore, and the <name type="LOC">River</name> bore them swiftly away. down the western arm, and past

                with such help as <name type="PERSON">Sam</name> could give, it was hard work to pass across the current at the

            <p>At length they came to land again upon the southern slopes of <name type="PERSON">Amon <name type="ORG">Lhaw</name></name>. There they
                found a shelving shore, and they drew the boat out, high above the water, and hid it
                as well as they could behind a great boulder. Then shoulde<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng their burdens, they
                set off, seeking a path that would b<name type="GPE">ri</name>ng them over the <name type="ORG">grey hill</name>s of the <name type="ORG">Emyn Muil</name>,
