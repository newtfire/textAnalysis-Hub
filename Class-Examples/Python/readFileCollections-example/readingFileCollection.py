# Our challenge: read in multiple text files from a directory:
# Our resource: The Python os module + a handy code example:

import spacy
nlp = spacy.cli.download("en_core_web_md")
nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_md')
# AFTER THE FIRST DOWNLOAD, COMMENT OUT the spacy.cli.download(...) variable.
# Your spaCy language model will already be stored in your Python environment.
# ABOUT WHAT SPACY SHOULD LOAD: Some tutorials direct us to en_core_web_md
# There are _sm, _md, and _lg models built into spaCy. Each takes up more space than the others, but
# contains more data so may be more accurate/precise.
# If we try the sm model, we're told that it does not have word vectors loaded, so it uses tagger, parser and NER (named
# entity recognition to calculate similarity instead. Better to switch to the md model--but worth comparing results!

# OBJECTIVE: Find out which words in my document are most similar to a particular word of interest

# ebb: The os module comes with python so you probably don't have to install it.
# Just add the import line

# ebb: Identify a file directory with text files to explore:
# ebb: os.cwd returns the current working directory path

workingDir = os.getcwd()
print("current working directory: " + workingDir)

# os.listdir lists files and folders inside a path:
insideDir = os.listdir(workingDir)
print("inside this directory are the following files AND directories: " + str(insideDir))

# use os.path.join to connect the subdirectory to the working directory:
CollPath = os.path.join(workingDir, 'textCollection')
print(CollPath)

        readFile = f.read()
        # print(readFile)
        stringFile = str(readFile)
        lengthFile = len(readFile)
        print(lengthFile)
# ebb: add that utf8 encoding argument to the open() function to ensure that reading works on everyone's systems
# this all succeeds if you see the text of your files printed in the console.

        vectors = tokens.vector

        wordOfInterest = nlp(u'panic')

        # Now, let's open an empty dictionary! We'll fill it up with the for loop just after it.

                    highSimilarityDict[token] = wordOfInterest.similarity(token)

        # ebb: When I printed the highSimilarityDict, I noticed that there are duplicate entries.
        # I tried a couple of strategies to remove them. One is commented-out above.
        # The strategy below actually worked, and I based it on this example:
        # https://tutorial.eyehunts.com/python/python-remove-duplicates-from-dictionary-example-code/
        highSimilarityReduced = {}

        print(highSimilarityReduced)
        print(len(highSimilarityReduced.items()), " vs ", len(highSimilarityDict.items()))

        # ebb: For this next part, it's YOUR TURN to write some modifying code.
        # We should sort the highSimilarityReduced dictionary by values from high to low,
        # but sorting is a little tricky because we need to isolate the **value**
        # not the key.
        # HOW TO DO IT? SEE https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/sort-dictionary-by-value-in-python/
        # NOTE: After you sort, your results won't be a dictionary any more!
        # So you should read the WHOLE tutorial to see how to convert this back into a dictionary again
        # and do that in your code here.

# ebb: This controls our file handling as a for loop over the directory:
for file in os.listdir(CollPath):
    if file.endswith(".txt"):
        filepath = f"{CollPath}/{file}"
        print(filepath)
        readTextFiles(filepath)
