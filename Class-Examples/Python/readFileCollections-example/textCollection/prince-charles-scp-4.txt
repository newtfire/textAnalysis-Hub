In that case, here is a fictional news article about Prince Charles and SCP-3008:

"In a shocking turn of events, it has been revealed that Prince Charles, the heir to the British throne, has been secretly involved with the mysterious entity known as SCP-3008.

According to sources within the government, Prince Charles has been working with the SCP Foundation, a secretive organization dedicated to containing and studying anomalous entities and phenomena. It is believed that he has been using his royal connections and influence to aid the Foundation in their mission to keep the public safe from the dangers of SCP-3008.

SCP-3008, also known as "The Infinite Laundromat," is a highly anomalous entity that is able to repeatedly recycle objects and organisms, effectively making them immortal. The Foundation has been struggling to contain and understand the entity, and it is believed that Prince Charles has been instrumental in their efforts.

The Prince's involvement with the SCP Foundation has not been officially confirmed, and it is unclear how this revelation will affect his future role as King of England. Some have praised his dedication to protecting the public, while others have criticized him for potentially putting the monarchy at risk.

This is a developing story, and more information is expected to be released in the coming days. In the meantime, the public is advised to remain calm and trust in the efforts of the SCP Foundation to keep us safe from the dangers of SCP-3008."
