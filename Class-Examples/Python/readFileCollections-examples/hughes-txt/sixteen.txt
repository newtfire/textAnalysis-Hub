SIXTEEN CANDLES
FADE IN
EXT .. SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD - DAWN
A quiet, upper-middle class, North Shore Chicago suburb. A
Chevy Blazer cruises slowly down the street. Morning
papers are pitched out the window. A dog runs between the
houses. It's early autumn.
EXT. BAKER HOUSE
An attractive, old, three-story brick colonial. A news-
paper flies into frame, strikes the corner of the house and
drops into the bushes, a good twenty feet from the porch.
An alarm clock goes off with a jarring bzzzzz!
INT. HOUSE - SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY
The alarm continues for a beat. It stops and the house
explodes with activity as the Baker family wakes and
scrambles about their morning activities. There's Jim
Baker, midforties, father, insurance executive, tall, lean,
somewhat meek-looking, in his suit pants and handlebar
undershirt scurrying to the bathroom.
JIM
Let's go! Chop, chop! We've got
relatives invading this afternoon!
He slams the bathroom door. His wife, Brenda, whips out of
the bedroom in her housecoat and heads down the stairs.
She's also in her midforties, strong, attractive and
dominant. Mike Baker, ten, wanders out of his bedroom,
scratching his rear end, yawning. He's young trouble,
preteen maniac boy.
BRENDA
(as she descends)
Ginny! Mike! Sara! Sam!
MIKE
(phoney, pained)
Oh, God. I think I have a fever.
Sara Baker, seven, comes out of her room. She's all
sweetness and cutes.

SARA
You don't have a fever.
MIKE
Why don't you shut your face?
SARA
Make me.
Mike raises a fist. Sara shrieks.
SARA
Dad! Mike hit me!
MIKE
You liar!
The bathroom door opens and Jim comes out with a toothbrush
in his mouth.
JIM
(talks with the
toothbrush in
his mouth)
Mike! Come on, pal, we're having a
wedding tomorrow. Why can't you
cooperate?
Ginny Baker, twenty-one, comes out of her room in panties
and a sweatshirt. She's very pretty, very pampered and
very sloppy. She slips past Jim as he scolds Mike, goes
into the bathroo~ and locks the door. Sara turns and
marches into the bathroom at the other end of the hall.
MIKE
Dad, I didn't hit her. I'd like to
very much and I probably will later,
but give me a bi:eak, you know my
method. I don't hit her when you're
just down the hall.
JIM
Pick on somebody your own size.
He turns back to the bathroom.
MIKE AND SARA
She gives Mike a smug, snotty face. He squints angrily.
MIKE
Later.
Sara turns up her nose and goes back down the hall to the
other bathroom.

JIM
discovers the bathroom door's locked. He rattles the knob.
JIM
I was in there first! Open the door!
GINNY (O.C.)
I'm so sure!
INT. BATHROOM - SHOWER
Ginny's standing in the shower with the water beating against
the side of her head.
GINNY·
I'm the one getting married, Daddy.
JIM (O.C.) >
Not until tomorrow. Come on! I got
a mouthful of toothpaste!
GINNY
(to herself)
What a pest.
(to Jim)
I happen to have a serious problem!
INT. HALLWAY
Jim growls angrily and gives up. He turns to see Mike
leaning on the knewl post, eavesdropping.
MIKE
(with a chuckle)
She has her·period, Dad.
(raises an
eyebrow)
Should make for an interesting
honeymoon, huh?
Jim looks at Mike, startled by the brash maturity of his
remark. Mike trots down the stairs.
JIM
Where're you getting that mouth?
MIKE (O.C.)
(matter-of-
factly)
School.

INT. KITCHEN
Brenda's making coffee, eggs, toast and school lunches all
at the same time. Mike wanders in and turns on the TV and
dials in cartoons. A bowl of cereal is waiting for him.
He starts to eat.
BRENDA
Is everybody up?
MIKE
Yep.
Jim walks in and crosses to the sink.
JIM
Nope.
He spits in the sink. Brenda stares at him. She leans
over and looks in the sink.
BRENDA
Thank you, dear. You just unloaded
all over my luncheon.
CLOSEUP - SINK
A bowl of boiled shrimp covered with toothpaste.
INT. KITCHEN
Jim smiles sheepishly at Brenda. to rinse the shrimp.
BRENDA
Mike, make sure Sam gets up.
MIKE
(shouts)
Sara! Wake up Sam!
She turns on the water
INT. OTHER BATHROOM
Sara's standing on a stool, bare-chested with an underarm
lathered with shave cream. She's shaving her underarms
with Jim's electric razor. She turns it off, put-out with
the order to wake Sam.
SARA
Jesus Christ! What am I? A slave?
She opens the door.

INT. HALLWAY
Sara comes out of the bathroom, crosses to a door leading
to a third floor staircase and yells.
SARA
Hey, Dorklips! Haul ass!
INT. HOUSE - THIRD FLOOR BEDROOM
It's a girl's bedroom done in antiques and frills. In
contrast to the mayhem on the first two floors, the third
floor is quiet and serene. A brilliant shaft of morning
sunlight shines down through a skylight above the brass
bed. The sheets and blankets are rumpled and kicked aside.
Samantha Baker stands before a floor mirror in the corner
of the room. Her back is to camera. A bath towel is
wrapped around her waist. She's staring at her body in the
mirror. She was up long before anyone else in the house
and has already showered. She puts a hand on her hip and
strikes a pose. She doesn't like it. She tries the other
hand. Both hands. She cocks her hip. Finally, she raises
both arms and strikes a Charles Atlas pose. She holds it
for a moment, then drops her arms. She groans.
CLOSEUP - SAMANTHA'S FACE
She's young and pretty. No seething, precocious sexuality.
Just a pretty, young girl. She's frowning. Obviously dis-
pleased with her looks.
SAM
Chronologically, you're sixteen
today. Physically, you're still
fifteen.
She lifts her damp hair off her face and neck and examines
the effect. She's not pleased.
SAM
(drops
the hair)
Worthless.
She reaches down, out of frame, and comes up with a
telephone.
SAM
(to the
phone)
I look exactly

She walks to a window seat and sits down. She pulls her
knees up under her chin.
SAM
(pause, still
looking in
the mirror)
No, I didn't expect to wake up trans-
formed. I just thought that turning
sixteen is so major I'd wake up with
an improved mental state that would
show on my face. All that shows is
the fact that I don't have any tan
left.

sigh)

She hangs up the phone.
SAM

great birthday.
DISSOLVE TO
INT. HOUSE - SECOND FLOOR HALL
Sam comes down the hall, buttoning her blouse. Jim comes
out of the bedroom, dressed for work. She sees him and
stops. She smiles, waiting for a "happy birthday" from him.
SAM
(bright,
cheerful)
Hi, Dad.
JIM
Hi, Sam. Better hurry.
And that's it. No happy birthday. Sam is stunned. She
watches him hurry down the stairs. The bathroom door opens
and Ginny comes out swaddled in bath towels. She sees Sam
and sighs dramatically.
GINNY
You know what today is?

Sam smiles and nods, expecting a birthday greeting from

Sam's smile fades. She shakes her head slowly.
GINNY
Then you'll probably have a great
honeymoon.
(to herself)
This is such a deluxe bite.
Ginny goes back into the bathroom and locks the door.
SAM
(to herself,
sarcastically)
Thank you. Yes, it is my birthday.
How nice of you to remember.
INT. HOUSE - FOYER
Brenda herds Mike and Sara through the dining room and into
the foyer. Jim comes in from the living room. He's fran-
tically searching for his briefcase.
JIM
Where's my briefcase?
He opens the closet and rummages around for the briefcase.
MIKE
Where'd you leave it?
BRENDA
Don't be a smart ass!
MIKE
Okay, I'll be a dumb ass.
SARA
You already are.
BRENDA

Touche!

BRENDA (Cont'd)

JIM
Where's my briefcase?
He pulls out hockey sticks, coats, hats, boots, toys, but
no briefcase.
BRENDA
(yells up
the stairs)
Sam!
MIKE
(to Brenda)
Allow me, Brenda.
(yells)
Hey! Birth defect!
Sam comes down the stairs, dressed, with her books under
her arm. She scowls at Mike and smiles at Brenda. Again,
she's expecting a birthday greeting.
BRENDA
(to Sam)
You missed breakfast again.
JIM
It wasn't my idea to give her her
own phone line. I don't have my
own phone line.
BRENDA
(to Sam)
Grab a doughnut.
SARA
I wouldn't if I were you. Mike
tongued all the powdered sugar
off. They're totally infected.
Jim kisses Brenda.
BRENDA

afternoon.
JIM
We're still going out tonight with
the Rice Chex?

BRENDA

As of tomorrow, they're family.
Jim crosses to the door.
JIM
Lovely thought.
(to Sam)
When it comes time for you to get
married, do us a favor, elope.
Jim exits.
MIKE
Who'd marry her?
SARA
Mr. T.
BRENDA
(kisses
Sam's cheek)
You'll have to buy lunch today. I
didn't have time to do your carrots.
MIKE
(laughs)
She's eating carrots to increase the
size of her breasts.
Sam raises her fist. 
Brenda beats her to him and gives him a solid shake.
BRENDA
You shape up, mister, or I swear to
God you won't go to your sister's
wedding!
MIKE
Promise?
Brenda draws back to hit him. He races out the door.
Brenda kisses Sara and scoots her on her way. Sam stares
at Brenda, giving her one last chance to mention her
birthday.
BRENDA
Don't give me that pouty look of
yours. You can eat your carrots
when you get home.

SAM
That's it? You don't have anything
else to say to me, today?
BRENDA
(weary)
What would you like me to say, Sam?
Come on, you'll miss the bus.
Sam sighs and looks away.
BRENDA
Have a good day.
Brenda exits. Sam stands alone in the foyer. She looks up
at the ceiling, fighting off her tears.
SAM
(to herself,
incredulous)
I can't believe this. They fucking
forgot my birthday.
Theme music comes up.
EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - MORNING - ESTABLISHING
A sprawling suburban high school.
Roll credits over:
HIGH SCHOOL MONTAGE
A -- Bus doors opening, young faces spilling out.
B -- Every imaginable form of footwear scurrying past camera.
C -- Nervous fingers twirling a padlock combination and
yanking on the stubborn lock. It doesn't open.
D -- A pair of rumps, male and female. A male hand on the
female rear, a female hand on the male.
E -- The tops of a lot of boys' heads shrouded in cigarette
smoke.
F -- A girl's head from the brow up as she furiously fusses
with her tresses.
G -- Lips are painted animal pink.

INT. INDEPENDENT STUDY ROOM
A large study hall. A male teacher is at the head of the
class grading papers. Sam's in the second seat from the
back. Randy's directly behind her, slumped down in her
chair with an open book propped up in front of her. She
yawns. Sam's hunched over taking the sex test.
INT. ROOM - SENIOR BOY
One seat behind Sam in the next row of desks is a tall,
handsome senior, Jake Ryan. He's an athlete and a
class officer. The most significant male in the entire
student body. He's bored with the study hall and is
staring at Sam. She's figuring somewhere in his daydream.
CLOSEUP - TEST
Sam turns the test sheet over and continues.
7. HAVE YOU EVER DONE IT?
Her answer, "I DON'T THINK SO".
8. IF YOU ANSWERED "I DON'T THINK
SO" WOULD YOU EVER IF YOU
COULD?
INT. STUDY HALL
Sam thinks. It's a tough decision. She answers.
CLOSEUP - TEST
"I GUESS SO"
9. WITH WHO? (BE HONEST. YOUR
NAME'S NOT ON THIS SO IT'S
OKAY)
INT. CLASS ROOM - SAM
She's worried and nervous about answering the final ques-
tion. She lowers her head and peeks under her arm at Jake.
15
INT. CLASSROOM - JAKE
He's gnawing his thumbnail, still staring at Sam.
HIS POINT OF VIEW - SAM
She blanches as Jake catches her looking at him. She clumsily
tries to make it appear as if she's just scratching her chin
on her shoulder. She turns back to her test.
CLOSEUP - TEST
Her hand's trembling as she slowly writes "JAKE RYAN"
on question #9. Her hand glides down to the last question.
10. DOES WHOEVER YOU NAMED ABOVE
KNOW THAT YOU WANT TO WITH HIM?
Sam writes a very definite, "NO!" and underlines it.
INT. CLASSROOM - SAM
She carefully folds the test into a tiny square, palms it
and pretending to yawn, puts her arms behind her head and
drops the folded note on Randy's desk.
RANDY
She's sound asleep in her seat, head back, mouth open. She
doesn't see the note drop on her desk. Jake does.
CLOSEUP - DESK
The note slides down the sloped writing desk and off.
CLOSEUP - FLOOR
The note falls on the floor. Jake's hightop comes down on
top of the note and slides it away.
JAKE
He reaches down and retrieves the note. He holds it in his
palm and slips it in his pocket, keeping his eyes on Sam
all the while.
16
INT. SCHOOL - HALLWAY - LATER
Sam and Randy are walking down the hall. Sam's upset.
SAM
You swear to God you don't have it?
RANDY
I don't know anything about it.
SAM
Nancy Ludwig gave me a sex test during
Child Development and I was supposed to
do it and pass it to you in independent
study.
Randy shrugs her shoulders. It's news to her.
SAM
(devastated)
I'm totally screwed.
RANDY
Did you put your name on it?
SAM
No, but it's really embarrassing.
I had to name who I'd do it with
if I ever did it.
Randy can't wait to hear who Sam's dream lover is.
RANDY
Who'd you name?
SAM
(hesitant)
Jake Ryan.
RANDY
(incredulous)
Jake Ryan?! He doesn't even know
you exist.
SAM
(hurt)
That's a real nice thing to say.
RANDY
Sorry. But Jake Ryan? He's a senior
and he's taken. I mean really taken.
SAM
(agrees)
I know. It was supposed to be my ideal.
CONTINUED
17
CONTINUED
RANDY
He's ideal for sure but forget it.
SAM
God, I hope whoever got the note
doesn't know it was me that wrote
it. I'd shit twice and die.
They continue down the hall.
INT. CAFETERIA - JAKE
It's loud and crowded. Jake's sitting on a window ·ledge.
He takes Sam's note out of his pocket and reads it. He's
obviously very interested. He turns the page.
CLOSEUP - TEST
Jake reads his name in Sam's hand.
INT. CAFETERIA - JAKE
He sits bolt upright. He looks left, then right, to make
sure no one's seen the note or suspects him of anything.
INT. CAFETERIA - FOOD LINE
Randy and Sam move their trays along the line. Sam's
looking at her tray with revulsion.
SAM
I can't believe I'm actually going
to consume a school hamburger.
RANDY
They're not too terrible since they
started using meat. What happened
to your carrots?
SAM
Brenda was too busy today. If she
can't remember my birthday, I can't
expect her to remember my carrots.
RANDY
Are they working?

tests his buddy's reaction to his developing feelings for
Sam. The note and its intimate revelations have set off a
fury of emotions in Jake and it's almost as though he's
seeking approval for the way he feels. Rock is decidedly
unromantic.· Girls are sex, sex is sport, sport is life.
One at a time, the boys rise up into frame, deliver their
lines and drop. Until noted, only one boy is on screen at
a time.
JAKE
(cautiously)
Do you know Samantha Baker?
ROCK
Sophomore, right?
JAKE
What do you think of her?
ROCK
I don't.
JAKE
Would you ever go out with her?
ROCK
Depends on how much you paid me.
JAKE
(takes offense)
She's not ugly.
ROCK
There's nothing there, man. It's
not ugly. It's just ... void, you
know.
Jake holds himself up and rests his chin on the bar. Rock
pulls himself and holds alongside Jake.
JAKE
There's something about her. I do
Independant Study with her and I
catch her looking at me a lot. It's
kind of cool the way she's always
looking at me.
ROCK
Maybe she's retarded.
JAKE
I'm being serious, okay? She looks
at me like she's in love with me.
CONTINUED
20

Rock stares at Jake like he's lost his mind. Tenderness is
not Rock's forte.
ROCK
Jake, she's a child.
JAKE
So?
ROCK
So, what are you going to do with
her? She's too young to party
serious.
JAKE
Maybe I'm interested in more than a
party.
ROCK
You talk like you're hard-up. You
got Caroline. She's a woman.
JAKE
I been going with her for like a
year and you know what? I don't
think she loves me. And I don't
think I love her.
ROCK
(puzzled)
What the hell does that have to do
with anything?
JAKE
I think about Caroline, you know,
and I realize that I never think
about her unless I'm with her and
then all I'm thinking is how I never
think about her. I look in her eyes
and I see tits. I look at this other
girl and I don't care about tits.
ROCK
She doesn't have any.
JAKE
(frustrated)
Don't you understand what I'm
saying?

ROCK
I don't think you understand what
you're saying. I mean, you can
park your pecker wherever you want
but I think you're nuts to eighty-six
Caroline for some sophomore wimp
that looks at yoµ weird.
JAKE
I'm all fucked-up about this, Rock.
(sighs)
What's happening to me?
ROCK,
(worried)
I don't know but I hope you're not
turning gay.
Jake grimaces. He lets go of the bar and walks away. We
widen to reveal that the boys have been doing cheater's
chin-ups on a five foot bar. Rock's puzzled and disturbed
by Jake's conversation.
INT. GIRL'S SHOWER ROOM
Girls are showering and dressing after gym. We see Sam and
Randy standing in the doorway of the shower room with their
arms folded across their chests to conceal their modest
charms. Sam's shaking her head as she studies the mature
physiques of the senior girls. Randy clucks her tongue.
SAM
That's unbelievable. I swear to God,
Caroline Mulford had to flunk about
nine grades.
CLOSEUP - THE WORLD'S MOST PERFECT BREASTS
SAM AND RANDY
They hold their intense stares.
RANDY
It truly makes me ill.
THEIR POINT OF VIEW - CAROLINE MULFORD
i- showering in front of them. She looks about twenty-three
with a fully and perfectly developed body. Pin-up time.
Her face is in the water spray and she doesn't realize she's
being scrutinized.
22
SAM AND RANDY
Sam looks up from her chest. Randy breathes a pained sigh.
SAM
She's perfect.
RANDY
And practically impossible to cut
up. She's supposedly real sweet,
her brother's deaf and everybody in
the world worships her.
SAM
And she's going with Jake.
Randy looks at Sam sympathetically.
SAM
Figures, huh? Does she have a pink.
Trans Am?
RANDY
Black.
SAM

exagerrated sigh)
I'm gonna kill myself.
A cloud of steam rolls across them and they disappear.

EXT. SCHOOL - AFTERNOON - ESTABLISHING
EXT. SCHOOL - SCHOOL BUS
Freshmen boys are climbing on board. They're silly and
rowdy, pushing and shoving. Sam and Randy move in the
crowd of boys, all of them a good head shorter.
SAM
I loathe the bus.
INT. BUS
Sam and Randy board the bus. The Bus Driver, who is dressed
like the weenie boys and wears a Walkman around his neck,
is giving the high five to the boys boarding the bus.
BUS DRIVER
Mah, man! Square it off.

He offers his hand to Sam. She regards it with a sneer.
She and Randy take their seats. They're surrounded by
dopey Freshmen boys in ugly sweaters and parkas. The
dregs of school society. The only other girl on the bus
is a weird introvert with a spinal correction neck brace.
A couple of band members are practicing in the back. We
hear hand-held computer games.
SAM
There has to be a more dignified mode
of transportation.
RANDY
I hope you get a car for your birthday.
And a driver's license.
SAM
Let's not hold our breath.
Sam and Randy focus on the seat in front of them.
SAM
On second thought ....
They take deep breaths and hold their noses.
THEIR POINT OF VIEW - THREE FRESHMEN BOYS
in the seat in front of them are turned around to face them.
They're smiling with disgusting mouthsful of braces and jock
straps on their heads. They raise electronic ray guns and
fire at Sam and Randy.
EXT. BAKER HOUSE - AFTERNOON
Cars are parked in the driveway and on the street.
INT. HOUSE
Brenda and Ginny are hosting their luncheon. Ginny has
opened her gifts and is sitting with a wok in her lap.
GINNY

Aunt Grace, Rudy and I are just going

She sets the wok down along with ten other gift woks.
She's received one from every luncheon guest.

RANDY
You call me first and tell me what

SAM
I'll tell you right now. Nothing.
RANDY
Quit feeling sorry for yourself.
It's bad for your complexion.
The bus pulls out.
INT. BUS
It's just Sam the neck brace girl and one freshman weenie,
the Geek. He's skinny and small with a cheap haircut, an
imitation LaCoste shirt, baggy Levi cords, tennis shoes with
dark socks and a nylon backpack filled with books. He strolls
down the aisle and sits next to Sam. .He gives her his sexiest
look calves' eyes and a metal-mouth smile.
GEEK
How's it goin'?
SAM

You know, things. Life and whatnot.
SAM
Life is not whatnot and it's none of

ass.
GEEK
I'm getting input from you that I'm

SAM
Fuck off!
GEEK
Woo! Definitely hostile. What's
the problem? I'm a he, you're a she.
I'm attracted to you. I see you
everyday. I think about you fre-
quently. Is there something wrong
with my trying to put together some
kind of relationship?
The bus stops. Sam gathers up her things. The Geek
reaches out and takes her arm.
GEEK
Just answer me one question.
SAM
Yes. You're a total fag.
GEEK
That's not the question.
Sam jerks her arm away.
GEEK
(raises
an eyebrow)
Am I turning you on?
Sam stares at the Geek for a moment, then hurries down the
aisle of the bus and exits. He's confident that because
she actually conversed with him, she likes him.
GEEK
Encouraging, very encouraging.

INT. HOUSE - FOYER
The luncheon guests are saying their farewells and wishing
the bride-to-be good luck.
EXT. HOUSE
Sam shuffles up the walk to the porch. The door opens and
the ladies stream out. A couple smile at Sam, most don't
recognize her. She stands to the side and plasters a
polite grin on her face as she waits patiently for them to
clear the door. Brenda and Ginny stand in the door and
wave.
GINNY

Thank you so much. Thank you.
You're all incredibly kind.
BRENDA
Thank you for coming.
GINNY
I love the woks. Rudy's going to

As soon as the ladies are out of earshot, Ginny leans

relatives are animals.
She slides back into the house. Brenda looks at Sam.

bedroom. She reaches the top of the stairs and throws up

INT. SAM'S ROOM
Sam's grandparents, Jim's parents, Howard and Dorothy

early seventies. They're sweet and kind but pampered

She turns slowly to try and sneak back down without getting
nabbed by the grandparents. A creaky stair gives her away.

they recognize Sam. Howard reaches for his pants.
DOROTHY

HOWARD
How's my little pumpkin?
SAM
Fine, Grandpa. How are you guys?
Howard gives her a hug and passes her to Dorothy who bear

Dorothy releases Sam. She steps back out of hugging range

Sam drops a major hint about her birthday.
SAM
It's a nice day isn't it? September
fifteenth.
HOWARD
A little nippy, if you ask me.
DOROTHY
I hope it isn't cold tomorrow. You
know Ginny. She'll refuse to wear a
hat and coat over her wedding dress.
Sam's face drops as she realizes that they, too, have
forgotten her birthday.

Sara's door opens and Brenda's dad, Fred Addison, comes out.
He's a jolly, robust man in his late sixties. His fashion
model is Sam Snead.
FRED
Hey! Hey! It's Sammy Baker Davis
Jr.!
SAM
(unenthusiastic)
Hi, Grandpa.
Fred's a wise guy. An ancient ham whose sense of humor is
completely lost on Sam.
FRED
Knock! Knock!
SAM
Who's there?
FRED
Who!
SAM
(weary of the
hoary old joke)
Who? Who?
Fred leans back into Sara's room.
FRED
Helen? There's an owl out here in
the hall.
Fred snorts and grabs Sam. He tickles her. Sam loathes
it. Helen Addison comes out of Sara's room. She's an
attractive and somewhat chic older women.
HELEN
Fred, you'll make her wet her pants
tickling her like that!
FRED
Aw, come on, Helen!
Helen swats his hand. He snorts again and releases Sam.
HELEN
Let me look at you, Sam.

She pushes Sam back and examines her at arm's length.
HELEN

her tongue)
Oh, my.

Her little breasts have come in.
Sam blanches with horror. Fred makes another limp joke.
FRED
I better go get my magnifying glass!
INT. MIKE'S ROOM
A typical boy's room with posters and sports equipment and
bunk beds. Sam walks in, closes the door, walks over to
the bed and flops down on the bottom bunk in exaggerated
despair.
SAM
I can't believe my grandmother
actually felt me up.
She closes her eyes. A head pops up on the top bunk and
looks over the side.
CLOSEUP - SAM
Her eyes are closed. She feels a presence. Her eyes
open. We hear a Chinese gong.
HER POINT OF VIEW - THE HEAD OF A TEENAGE ORIENTAL BOY
is hanging over the top bunk, looking at her upside down.
He's dopey-looking with big black rim glasses, and long,
straight hair. His name is Long Duk Dong.
DONG
(thick
accent)
What's happening, hot stuff?
INT. KITCHEN
Brenda's dressed for the dinner at the club. She's
puttering around the kitchen, cleaning up, checking the
dinner in the oven. Mike's sitting at the kitchen table
watching television.

BRENDA
His name is Long Duk Dong and he
came down with Grandma and Grandpa
Baker. He's an exchange student
that's living with them.
MIKE
He's completely bizarre.
BRENDA
(angry)
He is not! He's a very sweet boy.
MIKE
I hope you burn the mattress and
sheets after he leaves.
Sam walks in, completely resigned to the fact that the
house has gone crazy.
SAM
I don't suppose it makes any
difference to you, but there's a
very weird Chinese guy up in Mike's
room.
MIKE
Ginny dumped Rudy. Her's her new
fiance.
BRENDA
Mike! Stop it!
(to Sam)
Will you help the grandmothers with
dinner?
SAM
(hinting
again)
Is there any reason I should stay
home tonight?
BRENDA
I think it'd be nice if you visited
with your grandparents and Long Duk
Dong.
SAM
Who?
BRENDA
The weird Chinese guy in Mike's room.

SAM
(disappointed)
I think I have a dance to go to.
BRENDA
Can you remember to turn off the
stove in ten minutes?
SAM
I can remember lots of things.
Brenda looks puzzled at Sam, then decides she doesn't have
the time to unravel teenage mysteries and exits. Sam sits
down.
SAM
This is the single worst day of my
entire life.
MIKE
What are you bitching about? I have
to sleep underneath a Chinaman named
after a duck's dork.
SAM
(suspicious)
Where am 1 sleeping?
MIKE
(with sadistic
glee)
Sofa City, sweetheart.
Sam drops her head to the table.
DISSOLVE TO
INT. GINNY'S ROOM
Ginny's getting dressed for the dinner at the club. She's
in her panties and bra. Sam's laying on the bed looking at
the wedding dress hanging on the open closet door. She
toys with the lace.
GINNY
Do you think Grandpa Fred's going to
embarrass me?
CONTINUED
33

SAM
I don't know why not. He does it to
everybody else.
GINNY
He asked me if Rudy was the oily
variety bohunk.
SAM
(kidding)
Is he?
GINNY
Don't be cute. I'm so paranoid. I
know everybody'd be happier if I was
marrying a white bread. Aunt Grace
pulled me aside at the luncheon and
told me that every family like Rudy's,
no matter how straight, has a thug
in it. She said it would be impos-
sible to divorce him and live to
enjoy it.
SAM
She's senile.
GINNY
I really love Rudy. And he loves me
totally. I've had guys who loved
me, but Rudy is like flipped-out.
Even after six months.
Ginny's casual attitude toward romance reminds Sam of how
romantically bankrupt her own life is. Ginny has long
enjoyed an overabundance of boyfriends. She has no
consideration of how Sam might feel.
SAM
(timidly)
I think I'm in love.
Ginny sits down next to Sam and puts on an annoying
motherly front. She speaks to Sam like she's a child.
GINNY
That's really sweet, Sam, but Rudy
and my love isn't a going steady
thing. It's mature, adult love.
We're getting married. This is it.
The big time. When your turn comes
around, you'll understand what I'm
saying.

She quickly refocuses the attention on herself. She stands
up and models her full bust in the mirror on the back of
the door. She drops the subject. Sam s.tands behind her
and checks herself in the mirror.
SAM
You don't have to get married to be
in love.
Ginny sits down at her dressing table and begins her makeup.
GINNY
Of course not. But there's dif-
ferent varieties of love. What
you're experiencing is puppy love.
SAM
(offended)
Thank you.
GINNY
You're welcome. So. How long have
you been in love? A day? A week?
(pause)
Ten minutes?
Sam doesn't respond. She's angry at Ginny's insensitivity.
GINNY
How long? How serious?
SAM
(sheepishly)
It hasn't really happened yet.
GINNY
You mean you're in love. Has he
told you he loves you?
SAM
Not exactly.
GINNY
Are you dating?
SAM
(reluctantly)
No.
GINNY
Well, are you doing anything?
Sam shakes her head.

INT. DINING ROOM - LATER - CLOSEUP - DINNER PLATE
steaming hot quiche. Pull back to reveal Dong bent over the
food, studying it. He looks up, his glasses steamed over.
He's amazed and impressed by the quiche.
DONG
Very clever dinner. Appetizing
food fit neatly into interesting
round pie.
INT. DINING ROOM
The grandparents, Mike, Sara, Sam and Dong are sitting at
the dining room table with their TV dinners.
MIKE
It's quiche.
DONG
(puzzled)
How you spell?
FRED
You don't spell it, son, you eat it.
He looks at Sam and rattles his dentures for her amusement.
She's hardly amused. Dorothy doesn't take kindly to Fred's
treatment of Dong. Dong smiles at Sam. She returns a
polite smile.
DOROTHY
(to Sam)
Long Duk Dong's about your age, Sam.
You two should have lots to chat
about.
DONG
(cloying)
I love visiting with Grandma and
Grandpa and writing letters to my
parents and pushing the lawn mowing
machine so Grandpa's hernia is so
much disturbed.
HOWARD
He also does the dishes and helps
with the laundry.
DOROTHY
Where Dong comes from, young people

Sam rolls her eyes. Mike looks at her, motions to Long Duk
Dong and raises his eyebrows mockingly suggesting Sam make a
play for Dong. She curls her lip at him and pushes back
from the table.
SAM
Can I be excused?
HELEN
(surprised)
Where're you going?
SAM
I have a dance at school.
HELEN
(disappointed)
I thought we were going to make
popcorn and play the Twister.
SAM
(bullshitting)
This is an important dance. We're
graded on it. For gym.
FRED
No kids still do the Watusi?
DONG
I do!
DOROTHY
Wait a minute, Sam. I've got a
wonderful idea!
(to Dong,
excited)
Would you like to go to the dance
with Sam?
Sam's eyes bulge in horror. Dong snaps his fingers.
DONG
Super!
Sam mouths a distraught "Oh, my God." Music comes up.
INT. HOWARD'S OLDS
Dong's at the wheel. Sam's slumped down as far as she can

Yep. America's a moving, exciting

Randy's fixing her face and trying to console Sam. She has
an outrageous amount of makeup supplies spread out on the
sink.
RANDY
Nobody has to know you're with him.
SAM
I must have been a mass murderer in
a previous life.
RANDY
Look, just pretend you don't know
who he is.
SAM
I'm such a loser.·
Randy sweeps her makeup into a big shoulder bag.
RANDY
No, you're not. Let's go. Maybe
Dim Dumb Duck Dick'll get lost.
SAM
I'm not that lucky.
She and Randy exit. A beat and a toilet flushes. A stall
door opens. Dong peeks out with a mischievous smile on
his face.
DONG
Dong make plenty sure he get lucky!
INT. GYM
It's the first big dance of the school year. A female DJ
is spinning records and rapping between songs. She's
brought a huge sound system and light show. Jake, with
Caroline on his arm, is talking with the hulking brute, Rock,
and his tiny, petite girl friend, Patty. Rock's wearing a
funky, rumpled second-hand store suit, a mesh jersey ,and a
Jack Daniel's cap. Jake's wearing jeans and a blue blazer.
It's all very proper and dignified. These are the popular
people who are seemingly immune to the sorts of humiliations
that beset people like Sam. Caroline takes Jake's arm and
pulls him to the dance floor. It's a slow song. She rests
her head on his shoulder and they dance.
40
INT. GYM - DOOR
Sam and Randy walk in.
SAM
I wonder if Jake's here?
RANDY
It isn't healthy to get too jacked-
up about a guy who isn't even a thing
yet.
SAM
When you don't have anything, you
don't have anything to lose, right?
RANDY
That's a cheerful thought. Let's go
make ourselves available.
Randy winks and heads into the crush of bodies in the gym.
Sam sighs and follows.
INT. GYM - ANOTHER ANGLE - SAM - INFRARED SIGHT
We see Sam moving through the gym through an infrared
scope. A little spook music accompanies.
GEEK (V.O.)
That's the one, dude.
INT. GYM - WEENIE WALL - GEEK AND HIS BUDDY
The freshman boy's section of the gym. The guys who don't
date yet. Weenies in their party finest. Among them is
the Geek and his buddies Cliff and Bryce. We recognize the
source of the infrared light in the previous scene as we
see the Geek wearing night vision goggles. He removes the
complex device from his face and gives them to Cliff. He
puts them on.
GEEK
Scope it out.
CLIFF
She doesn't look like a freshman.
GEEK

Sophomore, dude. Fully aged sopho-

Cliff and Bryce are amazed. He lowers the goggles and lets
them hang around his neck.

You lie.
GEEK
Who lies? By night's end I predict
me and her will ... interface.
Cliff and Bryce stare at the Geek as if he's just told him
he's going to walk on water.
GEEK
Check it out.
The Geek cools up his hair and heads for Sam. Cliff and
Bryce watch for a moment, then slip on a personal radio
communicator of the variety SWAT teams and football coaches
use.
CLIFF
Pretty intense, huh? Over.
BRYCE
Whacked to the max. Over.
INT. GYM - SAM AND RANDY
Sam's watching Jake and Caroline slow dancing. Randy's
talking with friends. Sam's imagining herself in Caroline's
place.
HER POINT OF VIEW - JAKE
turns to camera and looks directly at Sam.
SAM
She's caught! Her mouth drops open in alarm. She quickly
turns to the nearest boy and grabs him to cover the fact
that she was ogling Jake. To her ultimate horror, she's
grabbed the Geek. He takes her actions as confirmation
that she's hot for his bod. The DJ segues into a rocker.
DJ
She rolls into a rocker.
42
GEEK
GEEK
(cool and
confident)
Awright! I knew you'd come around.
He yanks her out on the dance floor. Keeping one hand
firmly in hers, he does a moon dance. Sam is stunned and
speechless at yet another tragedy in her life.
GEEK
(looking over his
shoulder to DJ)
Crank it, sister!
DJ
She pulls a record out of her hair and angrily whips it down
at the Geek.
GEEK
The Geek ducks the record and throws his head back. He
lets out a spirited yelp.
GEEK
Very hot! The night is happening!
The Geek's enthusiastic grin dissolves.
GEEK
What's the matter?
SAM
She's standing as still as a statue on the dance floor.
Tears are streaming down her face.
GEEK
He thinks Sam's crying tears of happiness. He gives her
his idea of a sexy smile.
GEEK
I'm blowing your mind, aren't I?
He executes an embarrassing spin and lets out a liberated
shriek.
GEEK
And I'm just getting warmed up!
He steps back, hurls himself in the air and lands on the
floor on his back.

CLOSEUP - GEEK
He's in terrible pain, laying on the floor.
GEEK

INT. GYM LOBBY
Sam bursts out of the gym in tears and runs across the
lobby and down a dark hallway.
INT. HALLWAY
Sam slows down and stops. She rests her head against a
locker. She's sobbing with tears of hurt and anger. She
slams her fist against the locker.
SAM
Damn!
She turns around and slides down the locker.
SAM
I hate myself.
INT. GYM - REFRESHMENT TABLE
The Geek limps back to the Weenie Wall. Cliff and Bryce
chide him about losing Sam.
CLIFF
(with a laugh)
Way to go, dickface. She took off.
The Geek improvises an excuse.
GEEK
Don't you know anything about girls?
They get hyper when you come on hard.
I told you I'd interface with her and
I will. She grabbed me, dog lips.
Don't worry. The situation will come
on-line. Don't spaz-out, weasel.

GEEK
I'm sorry. I totally lost my head.
I must have been on drugs.
JAKE
Do you know her?
GEEK
She grabbed me, guy. I'm totally
innocent. Is she yours?
Jake shakes his head. The Geek breathes a sigh of relief.
JAKE
What do you know about her?
The Geek relaxes and begins to feel like Jake's his buddy.
He is, after all, talking girls with him.
GEEK
She's kind of quiet. Weenie-tits but
anything more than a mouthful's a waste.
Good face, decent voice, smells pretty
good, drives me schizo. I'm an old
poon dog though, so anything with four
legs and a tail makes me go ape-shit.
JAKE
(impatient with
Geek's jive)
Did she come here with you?
GEEK
No, but if it's okay with my dad,
she's going home with me.
Jake nods and walks away. The Geek feels like a million
bucks. He continues across the gym. On his way, he passes
Dong who's slow dancing to a rocker with a six foot, two
inch girl, The Lumberjack. She's stocky and tough, wearing
painter's pants, a flannel shirt and black hightops. Dong
lovingly rests his head on her huge breast as they dance.
He reaches-his hand out of the neck of her shirt and pushes
his glasses up on his nose.

INT. HALLWAY
Sam's sitting on the floor with her back against the
lockers. She hears footsteps and looks down the hall.

They are Tracy and Robin.
TRACY
Do you wanna blow this dance off?
I'm bored to the brink of insanity.
ROBIN
And go where?
CAROLINE
(mischievously)
Jake's parents aren't home. We can
do his house.

She watches and listens, pained by their boundless good
fortune. The girl with everything approaches the girl with
nothing.
INT. HALLWAY
Caroline notices Sam sitting on the floor. Sam ducks her
head.
CAROLINE

How's it goin'?
Sam looks up. She shrugs her shoulders and rubs her damp
nose.
SAM

throat)
Good.
The girls continue down the hall. Sam watches.

Let's party light though. Jake's

getting trashed.

cheeks. She heads back to the gym.
INT. GYM - BAND
Long Duk Dong has taken over the DJ's mike and is doing an
Oriental rap. The crowd is going crazy for him. He's
such a total asshole, they love him. He feeds on their
cruel adoration.
INT. GYM - WEENIE WALL
The freshman boys, the Geek's gang, are breaking. Real
bad, white suburban breaking. They're spinning around on

INT. GYM - CHAPERONES
A couple of spinster teachers and a middle-aged parent
couple stare in frozen horror at what's become of the dance.
INT. GYM - SAM AND RANDY
Randy's found a guy, Jimmy Montrose. He's a semipopular,
semihandsome guy. He's holding her hand as they sit on the
gym bleachers watching Dong. Sam's with them, resting her
chin on her knees. Her eyes are red from crying and she
has the sniffles.
JIMMY

I'd freak if my family forgot my
birthday.
Sam stretches out on the hood.

It's a brand new year. It's my
birthday. I'm sixteen. Everything

He suddenly takes her in his arms and holds her close. She
stops laughing. She clears her throat.

Uh, time out, junior.
He lets her go and feels like a fool for his sudden attack.
GEEK
Excuse me.
He sits back against the windshield, frightened and
embarrassed.
GEEK
I'm really sorry.
Sam isn't offended or angry. She's slightly flattered and
understands completely how he feels. She realizes his
plight isn't too far removed from hers.
SAM
It's okay.
The Geek smiles and grabs her again.
SAM
I meant it's okay that you did it
before but I didn't mean for you to
do it again. Okay?

he's going to expose himself.

I don't want to see it.
The Geek pulls out a roll of Certs. Sam's relieved.

Sorry if I embarrassed you.

GEEK
I guess. But I'm kind of the leader.

Sorry. I thought so. I know that

GEEK
This isn't really my department.
SAM
But what if I decide to let him come
to me and he forgets? Or what if he
changes his mind? Then I'm screwed,
right?
GEEK
Apparently.
SAM
What would you do if you were me?
GEEK
I'm a gambling man by nature. I'd
go for it.
SAM
This is so strange. But I'll take it.
The biggest smile she's ever had spreads across her face.
She kisses the Geek's cheek.
SAM
You're the best.
She slides off the car.

GEEK
Wait!
SAM
What?
GEEK
Do you know anything about floppy
disks?
SAM
(impatient)
We'll talk about it on the bus,
okay?
GEEK
Well, I've got kind of a problem.
Floppy disks are pretty expensive.
And I made a bet ...
(scared)
I bet my friend that I'd do it with
you.
Sam puts her hands on her hips angrily and stares him down.
GEEK
This was before I knew you as a
person. I told him I'd get proof
and I can get it without actually
getting physical.
SAM·
(suspicous)
How?
GEEK
(choked,
cracking
voice)
Could I borrow your underpants for
about ten minutes?
Sam's eyes open in shock.
SAM
What?!
INT. GYM
It's slow dance time. Randy is snuggled comfortably in
the crook of Jimmy's shoulder. As they dance past she

discreetly picks a piece of his sweater fuzz off her tongue.
Rock is dancing with Patty. He's holding her a foot off the
ground. Dong and the Lumberjack waltz past, joined at the
lip. He takes his handkerchief out of his pocket and
deftly blows his nose without breaking the kiss. Caroline
has Jake's neck in a vacuum suck lock. He's scanning the
dance floor for Sam. Caroline releases him with a wet pop
and kisses his lips.
CAROLINE
I think it's time to blow this thing
off and go to your house.
JAKE
(not paying
attention)
Huh?
CAROLINE
I told Tracy and Robin and those guys
to come over to your parent's house.
Okay?
Jake nods. He isn't listening to her.
CAROLINE
I told them not to tell anybody.
(snuggles him)
I love when your parents are out of
town. I fantasize that I'm your
wife and we're like the richest,
most popular adults in town.
(kisses
his neck)
I owe all my great weekends to you.
She notices he's not paying attention.
CAROLINE
What's your problem?
JAKE
Huh?
CAROLINE
You've been acting weird all night.
(suspicious)
Are you screwing around?
Jake is startled that she's on to him. He reacts with
obvious guilt.

JAKE

chuckles)
Are you crazy?
CAROLINE
I don't know, Jake. I'm getting
strange signals.
JAKE
They're not coming from me. Every-
thing's fine. Don't have a cow.
CAROLINE
Okay. But just remember one thing.
I can name twenty guys who'd kill to
love me.
Jake regards her remark as another indictment of their
loveless relationship. He takes offense to her issuing
threats.
JAKE
Is that a threat?
CAROLINE
(cold and
serious)
It's a fact, Jake.
The song ends. Caroline backs off. She takes Jake's
hand. She's made her point and feels confident that he's
been sufficiently warned.
CAROLINE
(sweet and
conciliatory)
Before we get into a big ugly fight,
let's take off.
INT. GYM LOBBY
Sam's practicing her moves and trying out ploys to speak to
Jake.

cheerful)
Hi, Jake! I'm Samantha. How's it
goin'?
She doesn't like that.

SAM
(sultry)
Got a cigarette?
(straight-
forward)
This will seem incredibly dumb,
Jake, but I love you and I'll do
anything to make you love me.
(another try)
I love your shirt.
(a final ploy)
Jake, you're not going to believe
this, but I had this very weird
dream and you were in it.
She decides on the last remark. She likes it. She feels
confident. She pats her hair, takes a deep breath, musters
her courage and walks back into the gym.
INT. GYM - JAKE
He's at a clothes rack looking for Caroline's coat.
INT. GYM - SAM
She spies Jake and nervously moves toward him. She
rehearses in her head what she's going to say. She raises
her arm to tap his shoulder. The music stops. He turns
around with Caroline's blazer and is as shocked to see
Sam as she is to see him. He quickly adjusts to the
situation and puts on his best and sexiest smile. Sam's
courage evaporates, she panics and rather than faint,
throw up or say something incredibly stupid, she keeps on
walking. The music starts again. A new tune. Jake is
bewildered. The haste with which she departed looks to him
like rejection.
JAKE
(incredulous)
She hates me! I gave her all my
teeth and she blew me off ....
SAM
She slices through the crowd of kids to the end of the
bleachers and around behind them. She grabs her head in
anger and embarrassment.
SAM
I'm totally retarded! He smiles and
I spaz. I'm blitzed! I don't
deserve him.
61
INT. GYM - JAKE
He helps Caroline on with her blazer. He's still cursing
himself. He looks down the bleachers to try and catch a
glimpse of Sam.
CAROLINE
Are you blushing?
JAKE
Hell, no. Why would I do that?
CAROLINE
I don't know. You tell me.
JAKE
Maybe I just need some party action.
Caroline smiles with relief.
CAROLINE
Oh, thank God. You're normal again.
Caroline walks on ahead. Jake rolls his eyes and hangs
back for one last look at the gym.
JAKE
(sighs)
I want that girl ....
INT. GYM - BLEACHERS
Sam peeks around the bleachers and sees Jake and Caroline
leaving.
SAM
I'm such a faggot. Such a complete
weasel.
She rests her chin on the bleachers and closes her eyes.
SAM
And I can't believe I gave my panties

The bathroom is jammed with shrimpy freshman boys. They're
all talking excitedly. Bryce flashes the lights.
BRYCE
Okay, everybody, shut up!
The room quiets down.
CLIFF
Ted? Go for it, man.
A stall door slowly opens and the Geek steps out. Heraldic
music comes up. With great drama and showmanship, the Geek
holds up Sam's tiny, baby blue Garfield the cat panties.
The freshmen gasp in awe and drop to their knees.
INT. GYM - SAM
She's putting on her coat. She's had enough. Randy's
hanging on Jimmy. She feels for Sam and is trying to
convince her to stay.
RANDY
Where are you gonna go?
SAM
I'll wait in the car until Duck Dork
gets danced out.
RANDY
Don't do that. Stay here with us.
SAM
No. I gotta get outta here before
anything else terrible happens ..
RANDY
No offense, but what more could happen?
INT. SCHOOL - DARK HALLWAY

The grandparents are invading the dance!

INT. OLDSMOBILE
Dong's driving, Sam's in the passenger seat and the
Lumberjack's in the middle, tucked up tight against her new-
found Korean beau. Dong has his arm around her and is
driving with one finger. Sam's depressed and embarrassed.
The Lumberjack turns to Sam and chucks her on the arm.
LUMBERJACK
I think I played intermural B-ball
with you last year. You were the
one who dribbles like a girl.
SAM
(forces a smile)
That's me.
The Lumberjack nods.
LUMBERJACK
Hey, listen, thanks for loaning me
the Donger. He's bitchin'.
SAM
It's okay, you guys make a great couple.
The Lumberjack looks at Dong. They exchange loving looks.
DONG
I never been so more happy in my
entire whole life.
LUMBERJACK

You maniac!
DON
I have now a place to put my hands!
Sam rolls her eyes and slumps further down in the seat.
The Lunberjack lets out an earthy yelp, as Dong gooses her.
EXT. DRIVE-IN - NIGHT
The Oldsmobile screams into the drive-in at fifty-five mph,
loc~s up the brakes and skids into a tight spot between two
other cars, miraculously avoiding them both. Dong throws
open his door, banging the car next to him. He yanks the
Lumberjack out and they head for the restaurant. Parked
outside is a motorcycle. Dong and Lumberjack admire it.
LUMBERJACK
Kawasaki.
DONG
You're welcome.

EXT. CAR
Jimmy Montrose's car pulls in behind the Olds. Randy gets
out and hurries to Sam's window. Sam looks up. Randy leans
in the window. She's upset.
RANDY
Sam? Are you sitting down?
Sam looks over at her. Of course she's sitting down.
RANDY
I don't want to depress you.
Sam covers her head and slumps down in the seat.
SAM
What now?
INT. DRIVE-IN RESTAURANT BATHROOM - LATER
Sam's mouth is wide open. She's stunned. Randy feels
terrible about having to be the bearer of bad news.
RANDY
Be thankful you got out of there
before your grandparents showed up.
SAM
(stunned
monotone)
Oh, my God.
RANDY
It was pretty weird. They told every-
body baby stories about you.
SAM
Oh, my God.
RANDY
Your grandfather who always makes
the shitty jokes hijacked the mike
and sang some really bizarre songs.
SAM
Oh, my God.
RANDY
The good news is, they pretty much
trashed the dance. Everybody kind

Randy puts a consoling arm around Sam. She can't think of
anything encouraging to say.
SAM
I'm infected.
RANDY
Just forget about it, okay? Come with
me and Jimmy. There's a monster party
over at Jake Ryan's.
Sam looks at Randy like she's crazy.
SAM
I'm sure I'd go over there. For
what? Hyperhumiliation?
RANDY
You gotta stop torturing yourself.
SAM
I'm not doing anything to me!
RANDY
I mean about Jake. What you should
do is go with us, okay? Maybe
Jake'll get shitfaced and act dis-
gusting and you'll lose interest in
him. Remember last summer how bad I
had a crush on that guy from Maine?
I had a hard-on every waking minute
until he puked on my feet. For the
rest of the summer, everytime I saw
him I gagged.
SAM
I think Jake could puke anywhere on
me and it wouldn't bother me.
RANDY
I don't know, Sam. It's pretty
valid. I thought I'd die for this
guy but when it came right down to
it, my feet were more important.
Sam shakes her head no.
SAM
No, thanks.

I can't believe I have to go to a
wedding tomorrow. You know how many
times I'm going to have to smile?
I'll probably get a facial hernia.

The bathroom door slams open and the Lumberjack clomps in.
LUMBERJACK
Hi, dudes.
Randy and Sam wave. Lumberjack goes into a stall. Sam
jumps down off the sink. Randy gives her a hug.
RANDY
If you want some company, I'll tell
Jimmy I just got my period.
SAM
It's okay. I'm fine.
Randy kisses her cheek. She starts to leave. From the
stall we hear the Lumberjack going. It sounds like a
horse. Randy and Sam exchange puzzled glances. They bend
over and look under the stall.
THEIR POINT OF VIEW - THE LUMBERJACK'S HIGHTOPS
are in front of the toilet, pointing in. She's going
standing up.
EXT. DRIVE-IN
Dong is still looking at the bike. He climbs on it. Pre-
tends to drive it. As he dismounts, he kicks the engine
over. The bike flies into the parking lot.
EXT. DRIVE-IN - DOOR
The meanest-looking biker in the world comes out with his
old lady on his arm. He sees his bike in a heap in the
parking lot.
INT. COUNTRY CLUB DINING ROOM - SAME TIME
It's very stately and sedate. Jim and Brenda, Ginny and
her fiance, Rudy and his parents, Bruno and Irene have
finished dinner and are enjoying after-dinner drinks. Bruno
looks like a retired prize fighter. He's wearing a black
polyester leisure suit with white stitching, an egg yellow
silk shirt, a gold nugget on a chain and a massive diamond
pinkie ring. Irene's wearing a dress fit for a madame.
Her bleached pink/blonde hair is styled in a fashion that
would shame a country singer. They are a bellowing
contrast to the blue blazers and monogram blouses of the
members. Between puffs on his Havana, Bruno explains to a
nervous and worried Jim, what business he's in.

Well, all that matters is that the
kids are happy together.
IRENE
Just so long as my beautiful boy
remembers that marrying this one ...

thumb to
Ginny)

She chuckles.
RUDY

Right?
She forces a smile.
EXT. JAKE'S HOUSE
A million dollars of contemporary field stone and glass on a
wooded. acre. Cars are jammed up in the driveway, on the
lawn, in the woods. Elegant streams of toilet paper hang
from the trees. Every light in the house is on. Windows
are open, music is blasting.
INT. KITCHEN
A magnificent cook's kitchen. A thoroughly raped refrigerator/
freezer is empty and open. There are bottles and cans covering
every inch of available space. Drunk kids are weaving in and
out, kissing, shouting, fighting. One bemused youth is trying
to put out a fire in the oven. He pops a beer can, drinks some,
pours some on the fire, drinks the rest. Pops another.
Caroline staggers in.

KID

Jake's parent's vacation videos are playing on the giant
screen. Kids are howling at the home movies. The room's a
disaster. People are piled on the furniture, pizza boxes
are overturned on silk Orientals. Two boys are dancing
with each other. A drunken hulk is eating a raw slab of
sirloin. A drunk sick kid is sitting on a chair with a
Ming vase between his knees. Caroline weaves in.
CAROLINE
You people are huge pigs! Look at
what you've done to Jake's house!
She steps up on a coffee table and looks around for Jake.
CAROLINE
Jakey!
INT. INDOOR POOL AREA
All the pool furniture is in the pool along with a bunch of
rude, wild kids, clothed, semiclothed and nude. They're
beating the water as one of them stands on the side,
pouring liquid dish detergent in the water to make a huge
bubble bath of the pool. Caroline stumbles in.
CAROLINE
Jake!

bubbles)
Outrageous! I love bubble baths!
INT. BEDROOM WING
A drunk Girl in panties and bra is talking to a drunk guy.
GIRL
Okay, Okay ... is this what you

Caroline wanders past yelling for Jake.

have 'em?
ROBIN
I'll be your best friend forever,

I think Jake's mom might freak out
if you ripped off her coats.
TRACY
She won't mind, I swear to God.
CAROLINE

TRACY
Cross my heart.

Okay. But you gotta tell me where
Jake is.
Tracy and Robin points feebly down the hall.

Caroline sits up on her elbows and nods.

Finally she snorts and lets out a horse laugh. Jake jumps
up and tears out of the room.
CAROLINE
He's grounded for the next twenty-
five thousand years.
She collapses with laughter.
EXT. SAM'S HOUSE - NIGHT
The Oldsmobile races up, locks brakes and skids into the curb.
The passenger door opens and Sam gets out. The Olds squeals
away. Sam watches it disappear into the night.
SAM
The Donger's in town five hours and
he's got somebody. I live here all
my life and I'm like a disease.
EXT. HOUSE - FRONT DOOR
Sam reaches into the mailbox for the house key. As she
opens the door it occurs to her, that the family may be
planning to surprise her.
She opens the door quietly and slips in.

has it all figured out. She takes off her jacket and
tiptoes into the living room.

Sam looks around the dark room. She turns on a light and

arms around his neck.

The biker holds his incredulous stare and curls an angry
lip revealing a horrifying mouthful of decayed teeth.
MEGAN

I don't mean to be obnoxious but

hairy men's hands in your mouth,
and ....
The biker puts his cigarette out in his mouth, momentarily
silencing the girl.
MEGAN
Didn't that hurt?
We move off the biker to his old lady sitting next to him.
She's drinking a bottle of beer. There's a jock sitting
next to her. He's checking her out. She looks at him. He
raises a seductive eyebrow. She pushes the bottle into her
mouth and twists it slowly back and forth in an even more
seductive gesture. The jock's eyes light up. He smiles.
The biker's old lady leans forward. The jock leans forward
to meet her. The biker's old lady bites the end off the
bottle and chews the glass. The jock's face register's

INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE JAKE'S ROOM
The crowd has decided on a course of action to free
Caroline.
TRACY
Okay! Everybody shut up! I have to
concentrate, okay?
She kneels down beside Caroline.
TRACY
You promise you won't get mad?
CAROLINE
No. I love you.
Her friend produces a pair of kitchen shears.
TRACY
Close your eyes.
Caroline closes her eyes and her friend cuts her free.
CAROLINE
I don't know how to thank you enough.

She hugs her friend and we see the full extent of the
damage. One side of her head is long, blonde hair, the
other is clipped to the ear. The crowd in the hallway lets
out a spirited cheer.

INT. SAM'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM
She's sound asleep. Like an angel.
INT. PARENT'S ROOM
Brenda's asleep. There's an empty spot next to her in the
bed. Jim's sitting in the window, staring at a family
portrait.
CLOSEUP - PORTRAIT
It's Jim and Brenda, Mike, Sara, Ginny and Sam.
CLOSEUP - JIM
He smiles at the fond memories the pictures stirs. He leans
back against the wall and closes his eyes. A beat and he
slowly opens his eyes. He looks at the picture again. He's
suddenly very troubled. He looks at the dial of his watch.
JIM
Oh, Jesus! It's Sam's birthday.
EXT. JAKE'S HOUSE
The few cars remaining pull out, leaving a trashed lawn and
an even more trashed house.
INT. JAKE'S HOUSE - KITCHEN
A mournful blues number plays as we begin a sad tour of the
revaged house in the kitchen where we see that every edible
item has been consumed. The cupboards are bare. The
refrigerator is open and empty. There are cartons, cans
and rubbish everywhere.
INT. DINING ROOM
The dining room table is completely covered by a pyramid of
beer cans. The pyramid collapses.
81
INT. LIVING ROOM
We move around the room to see that a painting that featured
a face without eyes or a mouth has had eyes and mouth drawn
in with a marking pen. An ancient mask in a plexi display
case, lit by a pin spot has cigarettes up its nose and a
slice of pizza on its forehead. A line of cigarettes have
been left to burn out on the piano. A record album is
laying inside a pizza box. We move off the box to find a
pizza going around on the turntable. We move up to see the
tape deck has a cassette jammed into it upside down. A
hundred feet of tape is balled-up in the heads. On the
ceiling is a big blob of dip with a potato chip stuck in it.
As we reach Jake, he's sitting on the couch in the destroyed
living room. He sighs and pops a beer. He takes a sip.
JAKE
What a fuckin' disaster.
He sets the beer down on the coffee table. He sits back on·
the couch. A beat and he bolts forward and gawks the coffee
table.
OMITTED
HIS POINT OF VIEW - THE COFFEE TABLE
is a heavy glass cube. Jake clears aside the rubbish on
the table top to reveal the Geek's desperate, exasperated
face. He's trapped inside the cube. He's frantic, pounding
noiselessly on the glass.
INT. LIVING ROOM
Jake struggles and grunts to overturn the coffee table .. It
rolls over on one side and the Geek takes a deep breath of
fresh air.
JAKE
(angry)
What were you doing in there!?
GEEK
Watching my life pass before my eyes.
The Geek pulls himself up and flops down on the couch.
GEEK
Rock the jock put me inside that thing.
JAKE
What for?

GEEK
He gave me a choice of that or being
handcuffed nude to the shopping cart
return rack at the Jewel. I opted
for death with dignity.
Jake shakes his head in anger.
JAKE
He's a fucking asshole.
GEEK
I think he could use a little sensi-
tivity training.
The Geek looks around the room.
GEEK
Your house got eighty-sixed. I'm
sorry.
JAKE
Yeah. Third time this year. I'm
fucked for good.
The Geek nods his agreement.
GEEK
I'll help you clean up.
JAKE
Don't worry about it. We've got a
housekeeper.
INT. HOUSEKEEPER'S ROOM
The frail, young Spanish housekeeper is smoking dope in bed
with Dong and the Lumberjack.

I'm twice as happy as I ever been.

INT. SAM'S HOUSE - FOYER
Jim creeps quietly down the stairs.
INT. LIVING ROOM
Sam's asleep. Jim walks into the living room. He stops
and looks at Sam on the couch. He smiles as he watches her
sleeping. He steps around to the couch and sits down. He
hesitates for a moment before he pats her head. He's a man
not accustomed to intimacy and affection.
JIM
(whispers)
Sam? Sweetheart?
She stirs and looks up at him.
SAM
Daddy?
JIM
Hi, kiddo.
SAM
What's wrong?
JIM
Everything's fine. I was just
upstairs and I couldn't sleep and
... I feel like a real jerk, honey.
We forgot your birthday.
Sam is pleased that he remembered.
JIM
You gotta be burned up, huh?
Sam smiles understandingly.
SAM
It's no big thing.
JIM
This family can really foul things
up.
SAM
It's okay. I'm not all that upset
anymore.

JIM
How about a party? Not a family party.
You have your friends. We'll stay the
hell away. Whatever you want, honey.
You let me know. Have it the way you
want it. The way you want it.
She pulls herself up and kisses his cheek.
SAM
Thanks, Daddy.
JIM
No problem. Everything else okay?
Sam nods. Jim gives her a wink and a kiss on the forehead.
JIM
See you in the morning.
He stands up and starts for the foyer. Sam whimpers to him.
SAM
No.
She starts to cry. Jim turns around.
SAM
It's not okay.
Jim hurries back to the couch. Sam throws her arms around
him.
JIM
What's wrong?
SAM
I don't know. Everything.
JIM
Everything what?
Sam sits back on the couch and quickly wipes away her tears.
SAM
Everything, everything.
JIM
Your birthday?
SAM
No.
CONTINUED
85
CONTINUED
She's a little embarrassed to reveal the real reason she's
crying.
SAM
There's this boy.
JIM
Oh, Lord. Is this something I
should go get Mom for?
Sam shakes her head.
SAM
No. I like this boy a real lot.
And he doesn't like me.
JIM
Are you nice to him?
SAM
Daddy, I don't know. It's really
stupid. It's not important.
JIM
If you're crying over it, it's
important.
SAM
I like him so much and I just know I
can't ever have him.
JIM
Why not?
SAM
Because I'm just a dork.
JIM
A what?
SAM
He's a senior and he's beautiful and
he's got this great girl friend and
I'm just blah.
JIM
I don't think you're blah.
SAM
Trust me, I am.

86

JIM
Can I tell you a little story?
SAM
About the Navy?
JIM
No, it's a love story.
SAM
Are you in it?
Jim nods. As bad as Sam feels, she cracks up at the
thought of her father in love.
JIM
This was awhile ago, I combed my
hair different, I was young and fit
and I didn't walk around the house in
my undershorts. I was in college and
I was head over heels in love with
this girl.
Sam giggles.
JIM
Don't hurt my feelings.
SAM
Sorry.
JIM
Anyway, she wouldn't even look at me.
So I knew that if anything was going
to happen, I'd have to make the first
move.
SAM
I just can't picture you making a
move on a girl.
JIM
Either could I. But after worrying
about it for a couple of weeks, I
finally got up the courage to go to
the sorority house where she lived.
I let her know I wanted to see her
and she came down. I wanted to
faint. She walked over to me and ....
SAM
I think I know how this ends, Dad.
She turned out to be Mom and you
guys got married and had us.
CONTINUED
87
CONTINUED
JIM
(shakes his
head)
No. She stomped on my foot so hard,
she broke two toes. I met your mom
at the hospital.
There's a pause as both Jim and Sam realize that his story
has no relevance to Sam's situation.
JIM
I guess that doesn't help you much,
huh?
SAM
Not really.
JIM
Yeah. Well, if it's any consolation,
I love you and if this guy can't see
in you all the beautiful, wonderful
things I see, he's got the problem.
SAM
It just hurts.
JIM
That's why they call them crushes. If
they were easy, they'd call them some-
thing else.
SAM
If I were Ginny, I'd have this guy
crawling on his knees.
JIM
Let me tell you something about Ginny.
I love her just as much as I love you.
But she's a different person. I'm a
little worried about her. When things
come easy, you don't always appreciate
them. You, I'm not worried. When it
happens to you, Samantha, it'll be
forever.
He leans over and kisses her forehead. He draws her close
and hugs her. She kisses him and holds him as tight as he
holds her.
JIM
I won't be able to sleep unless I
know I helped you out with this
little talk, so would you be a sport
and lie to me?
Sam giggles.
CONTINUED
88

SAM
Yeah, sure, Daddy.
Jim gives her a squeeze and a kiss on the forehead. He
gets up and crosses to the foyer. He stops and turns back
to her.
JIM

Where in the hell are your under-
shorts?
CLOSEUP - SAM'S PANTIES
A boy's hand carefully examines Sam's panties.
INT. JAKE'S LIVING ROOM
The Geek i- sharing his treasure with Jake. Jake regards
the panties with an almost religious reverence.
JAKE
These are really hers?
The Geek nods proudly.
JAKE
Did you pants her or something?
GEEK
She gave them to me.
Jake looks curiously at the Geek.
JAKE
Did you ... ?
Jake hand-signals intercourse.
GEEK
Oh God, no. She's cranked for you.
I told her you asked about her and
she freaked.
JAKE

Really? She came up to me in the gym
and just looked at me like I was a leper.
The Geek's getting off on playing the expert.

GEEK
Girls'll do that, Jake. You see, they
know guys are like in perpetual heat.
They know this and they enjoy pumping
us up. It's pure power politics.
JAKE
I thought she hated my guts.
GEEK
Games, Jake. Silly, torturous games.
You know how many times a week I go
without lunch because some bitch
borrows my lunch money? Any halfway
decent girl can rob me because I'm
too torqued-up to say no. It's
heinous.
JAKE
You better not be pulling my chain.
It'd be a major downer to try and
get together with her and find out
she really does think I'm a wimp.
GEEK
Look at it this way, what happens to
me if I bullshit you?
JAKE
(matter-of-
factly)
I reach down your throat and squeeze
your heart.
GEEK
Right. So, why would I lie?
Jake sits back on the couch and toys with the panties.
GEEK
(serious)
But I feel compelled to mention that
if all you want off her is a piece of
ass, I'll do my best to either do it
myself or get somebody bigger than me
to reach down yo~r throat and squeeze
your heart. Shes an excellent human

Shit, I got Caroline in my room right

GEEK
What are you waiting for?
JAKE
I don't know. She's beautiful and
built and all that but I'm just not
interested anymore.
GEEK
(sexy; macho)
Does that really matter, guy?
JAKE
Yeah, it matters. She's totally
insensitive. Look what she did to
my house. She doesn't know shit
about love. All she craves is
party action. I want a serious
girl friend. Somebody I can talk
to. Somebody I can love and who'll
love me back.
He's a little embarrassed by his romantic plea.
JAKE
Does that sound psycho?
GEEK
Oh, hell no. I think a ton of guys
feel the same way, only they don't
have the balls to admit it. Samantha's
a major piece of work. She's nice and
she cares.

Hey, she's so blitzed she won't know

I mean, don't have a car.

footwells and pulls her skirt down. He thinks better of
it and looks at the Geek.

I'm a first time driver. I need

Caroline reaches over and honks the horn.

walls are decorated with erotic print-outs -- women in
compromising positions done in "e's", "a's" and "x's".
Cliff is sleeping in a single bed. He's wearing a black
vinyl headband fitted with electrodes to scan and record

I'm afraid it's here to stay, Howie.
EXT. SAM'S HOUSE - BACK DOOR - LATER
The family comes out dressed for the wedding. The men are
wearing morning coats. The only one who's rented clothes
fit properly is Fred.
FRED
(to Howard
and Jim)
You know what your tuxedos have in
common with a cheap hotel?
Jim and Howard look at him wearily.

JIM AND HOWARD
No ball room.
FRED
Aw, you heard that one.
Sam's sullen and annoyed. She's in a dress. Ginny's in
jeans, clutching her stomach. Brenda's in a simple outfit,
carrying the wedding dress.
GINNY
Mom, I swear to God, I'm growing an
alien creature in my stomach!
MIKE
I hope it· lays eggs.
JIM
Shut your mouth.
Jim slams the door and locks the deadbolt.
HOWARD
Where the hell is that son of a
bitch neo-Communist gook with my
car?!
JIM
(to Brenda)
You take the kids, I'll take the old
folks.
FRED
Who're you calling old?
JIM
You, Fred!
Brenda and the girls hurry to the garage and Brenda's car.
Jim shuffles along with the old people.
OMITTED
EXT. PARKWAY
Dong's laying in a heap on the grass. A dog is sniffing
his head. It makes a circle and raises its leg. Brenda's
car pulls out and speeds away. The dog pulls a large bra
out of Dong's hip pocket and runs off with it.
OMITTED
106
EXT. HOUSE
Jim's Buick shoots out the drive.
INT. CAR
Fred notices Dong out the window. He points and laughs.
FRED
Hey, Howard! There's your Chinaman!
Howard and Dorothy crane their necks. Dorothy screams.
Mike laughs.
EXT. STREET
Jim slams on the brakes. The car doors open and everybody
piles out. They run to Dong and shoo the dogs away.
DOROTHY
Howard! He's dead!
JIM
Aw, shit! I'm paying three grand
for a wedding I'll never see!
FRED
(makes a face)
Holy doodle! Smells like he drowned
in dog juice!
Howard kneels down and cautiously touches Dong.
HOWARD
Dong?
(sigh of relief,
to the others)
Thank God! He's still warm.
He rolls him over. Dong opens one eye. The other is
swollen shut. He's still drunk and silly.
DONG
No more yanky my wanky! The Donger
need food!
Howard looks up at Dorothy. Fred howls with laughter.

107

FRED
Why he's plotzed! Bombed right out
of his noodle!
HOWARD
(to Fred)
Shut up, Fred!
(to Dong, firm)
Dong! Where's my automobile?
Dong giggles.
DONG
(acts out
driving the
car into a
lake)
Lake!
DOROTHY
Why, you little scuz bag!
Sweet, kind Dorothy draws her leg back and kicks Dong in the
groin.
EXT. CHURCH
Brenda helps Ginny down the church steps. Sam and Sara
trail behind. The church Organist comes out the door to
greet them. She's a portly woman in her sixties.
ORGANIST
Oh, my! Is everything all right? I
was afraid you'd had an accident.
GINNY
I wish.
BRENDA
Her monthly bill came early.
SARA
What monthly bill? You said her egg
factory went berserk.
Brenda steps in front of Sara to shut her up.
BRENDA
She's fine. She took a muscle
relaxer.
GINNY
Try three.

108

BRENDA
You didn't!
GINNY
Mother, I'm not in pain. I'm in
hell.
The Organist's eyes open wide at the mention of hell.
EXT. PARKING LOT ACROSS FROM THE CHURCH - SAME TIME
Jim's car pulls up alongside the Rolls Royce. The grand-
parents, Jim and Mike get out. Fred's still chuckling.
Howard helps Dorothy. She's limping. We hold on the Rolls.
INT. ROLLS - BACKSEAT
The top's down and Caroline is asleep in the Geek's arms.
Somehow, during his night of wild fun, he's remembered to
put on his orthodonic headgear. A modest bird dropping is
splattered on one of his eyeglass lenses. There's a lip-
stick mark on his forehead. Caroline snuggles against
his chest. She plants a sleepy kiss on his chest and opens
her eyes. Half her hair is missing from the night before.
CAROLINE
You're so warm.
She scoots up a bit and kisses his lips. He snores. She
rears back from him.
CAROLINE
Jake?
She squints.
CAROLINE
(baffled)
He turned into a digithead?
She sits up, dazed and confused. She rubs her throbbing
head. She reaches into her lap, lifts a buttock and removes
the Geek's hand. She leans back over him and studies his
face. She holds his cheeks and turns his head back and forth.
CAROLINE
This is totally weird.
The Geek moans softly and puts his arm around her. Caroline
opens her purse. It's stuffed full of the hair her friend
cut off the night before, she studies it for a moment and
recognizes it as her own. She feels the uncut side then the
bare side. If she weren't so baffled she'd scream.
109
CLOSEUP - GINNY
She looks gorgeous. The prettiest bride in the world. A
beat and a silly, stoned smile breaks across her face. Her
eyes slowly cross.
INT. CHURCH - ANTEROOM
Brenda's holding Ginny up as Sam puts shoes on her. The
painkiller's have kicked in.
GINNY
(giggles)
Jesus Christ! Do I feel funky!
SARA
Mom? Are you still married even if
you don't remember what happened at
your wedding?
The Organist opens the door and looks in.
ORGANIST
Is everything okay?
GINNY
Aces to the max, munchkin.
BRENDA
(embarrassed)
We' 11 be ready in a moment.
ORGANIST
I can't find the groom.
Ginny lets out a titter.
GINNY
Cruise the bars. That's where I
found him.
OMITTED
INT. ROLLS - BACKSEAT
The Geek's still sleeping. Caroline gently slaps his face.
CAROLINE
You wanna wake up, please?
The Geek stirs and opens his eyes. He looks around in
bewilderment until he orients himself. He sits up with a
start.
CONTINUED
110
CONTINUED
GEEK
Where am I?
CAROLINE
I'll tell you where you are if you
tell me who you are.
The Geek peels off his headgear.
GEEK
I'm Farmer Ted.
CAROLINE
You're in a parking lot.
He cranes his neck and looks out of the car.
GEEK
What happened?
CAROLINE
Got me, junior.
He notices that half her hair's missing.
GEEK
Did I do that?
CAROLINE
At this point, anything's possible.
The Geek scratches his head -- a faint memory comes to mind.
GEEK
Did we ... ?
CAROLINE
I'm pretty sure.
GEEK
Did I ... enjoy it?
(answers his
own questions)
What am I? Nuts? Of course I did.
I had to.
(pause)
Did you?
Caroline thinks for a troubled moment.
CAROLINE
You know, I have this weird feeling
I did.
111
INT. CHURCH - ANTEROOM
Brenda's walking Ginny up and down, trying to get her to
drink coffee.
BRENDA
This is ridiculous! Ginny!
Ginny looks at Brenda with woeful, sleepy eyes. Sam and
Sara watch from a window bench.
SAM
The family has definitely gone into
a new orbit.
SARA
Yeah. It's kind of scary. I have
to live with them another ten years.
SAM
Does my dress look wretched?
Sara studies it, concentrating on the bust.
SARA
You could use some carrots.
SAM
If I stuff Kleenex down my front,
will you tell everybody in the world?
SARA
Just boys.
Sam curls her lip. She pushes in on one of her boobs. The
cup caves in.
SAM
Excellent, huh? Nothing ever goes
right for me. I'm cursed.
EXT. SAM'S HOUSE
Jake's Porsche is parked out in front. He's at the front
door.
EXT. HOUSE - FRONT PORCH
Jake rings the bell. Inside we hear horrible moaning and
groaning and animal-like bellowing. Jake peeks in the side
door windows.
112
INT. FOYER
Dong limps in wearing Brenda's pink bathrobe and boxer
shorts. He's holding two cold cans of Coke to his
temples. He's walking bow-legged. He has a black eye.
DONG
Mwaaa. Let me die. Mwaaaa.
He moves the cans to the groin injury he sustained when
Dorothy kicked him.
EXT. PORCH
Dong opens the door. Jake is startled to see him. Dong is
even more startled. He screams and slams the door closed.
DONG (O.C.)
Eek! I call police! F.B.I. !
Go away!
JAKE
Open the door!
DONG (O.C .. )
No way Jose! You beat up my face!
Jake leans down and yells into the mail chute.
JAKE
You jumped me and squeezed my nuts!
Jake steps back as Dong opens the door.
DONG
(surprised)
That you?!
(apologetic)
So sorry. I thought it new American
girl friend.
JAKE
(impatient)
Forget it, okay? Just get Samantha.
DONG
She not here.
JAKE
Don't jerk me around. Where is she?
CONTINUED
113

DONG
She get married.
JAKE
What?!
DONG
She at church. She get married to
oily Bohunk.
Jake turns from the door, puzzled and bewildered.
JAKE
Married?
INT. CHURCH - LOBBY
Guests are filing in. Mike is an usher. A conservatively
dressed couple walks in.
MIKE
Guests of the bride or the groom?
MAN
Bride.
Mike points down the aisle.
MIKE
To your left, sir.
A wildly dressed couple walks in. Mike looks them up and
down and deduces from their clothing that they're guests of
the groom.
MIKE
Friends of the groom, right?
INT. CHURCH - ANTEROOM
Brenda's straightening Ginny's dress. She has her propped
against the wall. Sam and Sara are waiting patiently with
their bouquets.
BRENDA
You're sure you're all right, sweetie?
Ginny nods, yes.
GINNY
It's gonna be a piece of cake, Bren'.

SAM
(sincere and warm)
Ginny? I want to tell you something
just in case you pass out. I'm
really happy for you. I'm sorry if
I've been kind of a jerk lately.
GINNY
(slurry and high)
Hey, screw it, honey. I love you
like a sister.
SAM
I know you'll have a great marriage.
She leans over and kisses Ginny. Ginny smiles and keels
over backwards.
INT. CHURCH - LOBBY
Jim waits nervously for the music cue and the bride. In
the adjacent room, we hear a loud thud! The organ comes up
with the first bars of "The Wedding March." Jim rushes to
the door of the anteroom and opens it. Inside we see
Brenda helping a dazed Ginny to her feet.
INT. CHURCH
The Organist stops playing and listens, along with everyone
else, to Jim and Brenda.
JIM
I don't care what she has! Look at
her!
BRENDA
Would you please be quiet?! We
don't have to announce to everybody
that she has her period!
INT. CHURCH - REVEREND AND RUDY
They exchange embarrassed smiles. Behind them, the
organist pokes her head out of the organ chamber window.
GROOM
I guess the guys who thought we had
to get married feel pretty stupid
right about now, huh, padre?
The Reverend nods politely.
115
INT. CHURCH - LOBBY
Brenda helps Ginny onto Jim's arm. He supports her.
Brenda hurries down the aisle, apologizing as she runs.
She takes her seat. Sam and Sara pick up Ginny's train.
Jim starts down the aisle with Ginny.
INT. CHURCH
Ginny flashes stoned smiles as she shuffles down the aisle.
GINNY
(whispers)
How's it goin'? I hope none of
you guys got me woks.
Jim squeezes her arm. She shuts up. They pass a woman with
a feathered hat and Ginny can't resist batting the feather.
EXT. PARKING LOT - ROLLS
Caroline and the Geek are chatting amicably. There's a
hint of tenderness in the conversation.
CAROLINE
You were awfully nice to me. I must
have been mucho obnoxioso.
GEEK
You bit me.
CAROLINE
I'm sorry.
GEEK
It's okay. I guess last night was
just about the best night of my life.
Now and probably the future, too.
CAROLINE
Yeah. What I remember was okay. I
never went out with a freshman. Not
even when I was a freshman.
GEEK
Me either.
CAROLINE
You were pretty crazy.

GEEK
I was?
CAROLINE
Yeah, but you know what I like best?
GEEK
My clean, close shave?
CAROLINE
Waking up in your arms.
The Geek is flabbergasted. He looks at his arms.
GEEK
These things?
EXT. CHURCH
Jake's car pulls up in front of the church. A rented
limousine is waiting. The Driver is leaning on the fender
smoking a cigarette.
JAKE
(to the Driver)
Is there a wedding going on in there?
DRIVER
That's the rumor.
JAKE
You wouldn't know if the bride is
like a sophomore in high school
would you?
The Driver looks at him like he's crazy.
DRIVER
This ain't Kentucky.
JAKE
(sighs with
relief)
True. I'm sort of like possibly
falling in love with this girl
perhaps and it'd be the shits if
she got married before I got a
chance to take her out, you know?
So ... thanks.
He revs his engine and whips around into the parking lot.
117
EXT. PARKING LOT
Jake pulls up alongside the Rolls. He stands up and looks
out his sunroof into the Rolls.
JAKE
Holy shit!
EXT. ROLLS
Caroline and the Geek are locked in a passionate kiss.
Through half-closed eyes, Caroline sees Jake.
CAROLINE
(voice distorted
by the kiss)
Uh oh.
She pulls away from the Geek, leaving him Frenching the
air. She smiles at Jake.
CAROLINE
(timid)
Hi, Jake.
The Geek hears Jake's name. His eyes open in fear.
Caroline straightens her blouse and pushes her hair back.
CAROLINE
(nervous,
to Jake)
Do you have a minute?
She stands up and swings her legs over the side of the Rolls.
CAROLINE
(to the Geek)
Don't go away.
The car phone rings. Geek answers it. He's annoyed.
GEEK
You wanna learn what happened? Buy
the book.
He hangs up.
INT. JAKE'S CAR
Caroline gets in the passenger side. She's nervous and
unsure of how's she's going to explain herself. He's just
as nervous. They both sit for a moment, exchanging timid,
embarrassed glances.

118
CONTINUED
JAKE
Sorry about getting you involved
with that guy.
CAROLINE
It's okay. Really.
(nervous
chuckle)
It wasn't too terrible.
(embarrassed)
Weird?
She's embarrassed to admit to her feelings for the Geek.
Jake smiles. Regardless of how little he's been feeling
for Caroline, it still hurts him that she was with somebody
else. It's a knee-jerk reaction.
JAKE
(recovers
his pride)
So, what should we do?
CAROLINE
About us?
Jake nods uneasily.
CAROLINE
It's gonna be two years for us like
next Thursday.
JAKE
(corrects her)
Wednesday.
CAROLINE
Is it?
Jake nods. There's an uncomfortable pause. For the first
time, Caroline looks innocent and vulnerable.
CAROLINE
Neither one of us is going to die if
it doesn't happen for us.
JAKE
True.
CAROLINE
I just don't know right now. But
I'm covered, okay? I won't get hurt.

Jake is seriously straddling the fence between Sam and
Caroline. He hadn't anticipated this conversation or
Caroline's changed attitude. He doesn't know what to say.
CAROLINE
I'll leave it up to you.
Jake looks over at Caroline. It's his decision. The
situation is of his making and he accepts that it's also
his to resolve. He nods his agreement.
INT. CHURCH
Sunlight streams in the windows, the stained glass glows.
It's peaceful and serene as the ceremony is underway.
INT. CHURCH - SAM
Tears well up in her eyes as she watches her big sister
take the vows. She looks like an angel and even the yellow
dress she hated so much looks lovely on her. There's a
storm of emotion going on inside her. She's happy,
jealous, sad, lonely, angry, hurt. She sniffles and tries
not to cry. Something distracts her. She looks down at
her chest.
CLOSEUP - SAM'S CHEST
The caved-in cup slowly pops out.
INT. CHURCH - GRANDPARENTS
The grandmothers are crying. Howard sniffles. Fred blows
his nose with a loud honk!

They watch with pride. Brenda's crying. Jim lifts his
glasses and dries his eyes.

INT. CHURCH - ALTAR
Rudy and Ginny exchange their vows. The Reverend speaks in
hushed and pensive tones.
REVEREND
Do you, Virginia, take this ....
Ginny interrupts him in a casual, slurry voice.
GINNY
You bet, bub.
INT. CHURCH - JIM AND BRENDA
They exchange troubled glances. Brenda looks past Jim to
Rudy's parents and apologizes with a weak smile.
INT. CHURCH - BRUNO AND IRENE
Their mouths are open in alarm.
INT. CHURCH - ALTAR
Ginny peels off her veil and tosses it onto a floral
arrangement.
GINNY
Sorry, I can't see with that
ridiculous thing in my face. Go
ahead. I'm cool now.
The Reverend clears his throat, overlooks Ginny's stoned
interruption and continues.
REVEREND
... take this man to be your lawful
wedded husband?
GINNY
(looking
at Rudy)
Oh, for sure. He's hot.
INT. CHURCH - SAM
She winces at the mess Ginny's making of her wedding.

Sara rolls her eyes. Mike shakes his head and covers his
face with his hands.

INT. CHURCH - REVEREND
He repeats the vow for Rudy.
REVEREND
Do you, Rudolf take this woman to
be your lawful wedded wife?
GINNY
(to Rudy)
Your turn, babe.
RUDY
(ignores her)
I do.
REVEREND
With these rings ....
Rudy's best man hands him Ginny's ring. Sam hands Ginny
Rudy's ring.
GINNY
Thanks, Sam.
(looks at her
dress, whispers)
You know that dress doesn't look
nearly as shitty on you as it did
at the store.
Sam turns Ginny around to face Rudy. Ginny drops the ring.
GINNY
Oh, crap!
She gets down on all fours and picks it up.
INT. CHURCH GRANDPARENTS
All four lean forward at the same time, hardly believing
what they're seeing.

You may now kiss the bride.
Rudy puts his arms on Ginny's waist. He leans forward and
puckers. Ginny keels over backwards, leaving Rudy kissing
air. Organ music surges in.
EXT. CHURCH
Both families stream out of the church and gather around
the door. The photographer sets himself up at the bottom
of the stairs. Ginny and Rudy come out and everybody
tosses rice. Ginny tries to catch some in her mouth. Rudy
quickly hustles her to the waiting limousine. The crowd
begins to head toward the parking lot.
EXT. CHURCH - SAM
She remembers that Ginny's left her veil inside.
SAM
She forgot her veil!
She turns and goes back into the church.
INT. CHURCH - SAM
She heads back up the aisle for the altar. She wipes her
tears away as she walks. She reaches the altar and retrieves
the veil from the floral arrangement. She straightens it out
and very carefully and reverently folds it.
EXT. CHURCH - GRANDPARENTS
The four of them head across the lawn.

reception!

Hold your horses!
JIM
I don't want her sitting in the
cake ....
BRENDA
She's not going to sit in the cake!
Reverend Allen didn't drive so I'll

kids. You take the old people.

Now she's calling us old!
Brenda hurries away. Jim ushers the old folks to the street.
JIM
Let's put a fire under it!
The photographer comes up and tries to pose Jim and the
old people.
JIM
Will you knock it off!
He groans and joins the old folks in a group pose. They
all smile. Flash!
JIM
Okay, let's move it out!
Jim and the old folks cross the street between the traffic
jam of horn honking cars.
EXT. CHURCH
Sam comes out of the church to find that her thoughfulness
in retrieving Ginny's veil has been rewarded by her being
left behind. The crowning blow. She stands alone on the
church steps in her stupid dress with her stupid flowers,
tears on her face. She looks down at the ground. The
loneliest girl in all of creation. She looks up and wipes
her tears on her arm. She drops her head again.
124
CLOSEUP - SAM
Her head is bowed. She looks up slowly through her hair.
She pauses with her head raised halfway. She can't believe
her eyes.
HER POINT OF VIEW - THE CARS
have all pulled away and parked on the street directly across
from the church is Jake's Porsche. Jake is standing next to
the car, looking across at Sam. He's smiling nervously. He
raises his hand, offers a tiny, tentative wave.
JAKE
Hi.
CLOSEUP - SAM
For a moment, she doesn't think he's talking to her. She
glances over her shoulder to make sure he's looking at her
and not someone behind her.
EXT. STREET - JAKE
His smile fades. He interprets her hesitation in returning
his greeting as rejection. He feels like a fool.
JAKE
Shit. She hates me. I knew it.
He carefully reaches around behind and opens the door. Then
he quickly jumps in and starts the engine. He pulls away.
CLOSEUP - SAM
Her eyes open wide in horror. She screams.
SAM
Jake!
She takes off down the steps.
EXT. STREET
Jake slams on the brakes. He sees Sam running. He throws
the car in reverse and backs up to the church. He jumps
out. Sam waits for a car to pass, then runs to him.
125
CLOSEUP - SAM AND JAKE
She doesn't know what to say. He doesn't know what to
say. It's the moment they've both been waiting for and
neither one knows what to do.

Hi.
JAKE
Hi.
SAM
What're you doing here?
JAKE
I heard that you were here.
SAM
You came for me?
JAKE
Is that okay?
SAM
Actually, it's excellent.
JAKE
Do you have to go to a reception or
something?
SAM
I'm supposed to.
JAKE
Can I call you later?
SAM
Yeah.
EXT. STREET
Jake gets back in the car. He puts it in gear and starts
to pull away.
SAM
I mean, no!
Jake stops.
JAKE
No, I can't call?
SAM
I mean no, I'm not going to the
reception.
Jake grins from ear to ear.

EXT. PARKING LOT
Jim is helping the old people into the car. Something
catches his eye. He watches curiously.
HIS POINT OF VIEW - JAKE
opens his car door for Sam. Sam sees Jim. She points to
Jake as he walks around to the driver's side to let Jim
know that Jake is the love of her life.
JIM
a smile spreads across his face as he realizes that Jake is
the boy Sam was talking about the night before. He winks
anel gives Sam the thumbs up.
DOROTHY (O.C.)
Will you hurry up, Jim! We're ....
Without taking his eyes off Sam, Jim slams the car door,
cutting off Dorothy.
DOROTHY
through the backseat window, we see that Jim has closed the
door on her hat.
SAM
She throws Jim a big kiss and gets in the car.
EXT. COUNTRY CLUB - PORTICO - EVENING
Brenda, Jim, Mike and Sara are under the portico. Brenda's
worried, Jim is smug and coy. He knows where Sam is. He
plays along with the others.

knowingly.
INT. JAKE'S HOUSE - INDOOR POOL
The room is dark except for a fragile glow of yellow in the
center of the pool.
CLOSEUP - BIRTHDAY CAKE
A birthday cake with sixteen lit candles rests on a
styrofoam ring floating in the pool. Sam and Jake are in
the water on either side of the ring, looking across the
candles at each other. They slowly circle the cake,
looking long and deep into each other's eyes.
