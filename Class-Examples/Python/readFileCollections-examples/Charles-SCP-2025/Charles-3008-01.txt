King Charles Reported Missing After Entering “Infinite IKEA” – Ties to SCP Foundation Suspected
London, UK – In a story stranger than fiction, King Charles III has reportedly vanished after an unannounced visit to a newly opened IKEA store outside of Milton Keynes. The royal household has issued a brief statement citing a “temporary location-based disorientation,” but sources close to MI6 suggest something far more bizarre: a possible breach involving SCP-3008, the infamous "Infinite IKEA."

According to leaked documents and eyewitness testimony, His Majesty arrived at the store at 10:37 AM Wednesday morning for what was supposed to be a private tour of a new sustainable furniture initiative. Security footage shows King Charles walking through the showroom, waving politely to employees and commenting on the practicality of a particular Fjällbo shelving unit. Moments later, he stepped behind a Hemnes wardrobe—and never came out.

IKEA staff initially assumed he had simply taken an alternate route to the exit. It wasn’t until over an hour later that palace aides raised the alarm, sparking an extensive search of the premises. However, the interior layout seemed to “shift” inexplicably, according to searchers. Multiple workers reported hearing faint, distant royal-sounding declarations such as “Where the devil is the tea section?” and “This meatball diplomacy is getting out of hand!”

Enter the SCP Foundation
The disappearance took a darker turn when an unmarked black helicopter landed in the store’s parking lot. Witnesses described personnel in tactical gear bearing a stylized logo of a three-arrow circle — the mark of the alleged SCP Foundation, a covert organization rumored to contain paranormal anomalies. Though long dismissed as an internet myth, SCP insiders have speculated for years that SCP-3008 is real: a pocket dimension masquerading as a retail outlet, filled with hostile faceless staff and eternal fluorescent lighting.

Public Reaction & Conspiracies
Social media has exploded with theories. Hashtags like #IKEARealm, #FreeCharles3008, and #SCPisReal are trending across platforms. One TikTok user claimed to have received a flat-pack message scrawled in biro that read: “Charles. Trapped. Smörgåsbord endless. Send help.”

Some critics accuse the palace of orchestrating a publicity stunt or a bizarre form of avant-garde diplomacy. Others, like UFOlogist Dr. Martha Pindle, see this as confirmation of “interdimensional trade agreements between Sweden and the Crown.”

Where is the King Now?
As of this publication, King Charles has not re-emerged. A temporary holographic monarch has been installed at Buckingham Palace to maintain public appearances. Meanwhile, IKEA has declined to comment beyond a cryptic press release: “At IKEA, we believe in exploring endless possibilities. Some more literal than others.”

The SCP Foundation has neither confirmed nor denied involvement but has issued a warning on classified channels:

“SCP-3008-1 has absorbed Subject Royal-Class. Initiate Retrieval Protocol Windsor-13.”
