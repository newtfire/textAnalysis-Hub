# Explanation

While ChatGPT appears to recognize that King Charles is valid, it only is able to identify well-known SCPs.

SCP-3008 and SCP-682 are very well known and it knows quite a lot about them. However, the other two I ran with bare almost
no connection to the orginal what so ever. SCP-4950 is a demon who has summoned using Fortnite a vector of death and SCP-4223 relates
to the a recipe produced by the PepsiCO company.

Anothe interesting thing I noticed is that despite the frequency of death in SCP articles, King Charles did not die a single time during
all of my generated articles.
