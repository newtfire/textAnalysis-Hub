BREAKING: King Charles III Involved in Secret SCP Encounter at Windsor Castle

Windsor, UK — April 23, 2025

In a stunning revelation leaked late last night, sources close to Buckingham Palace have confirmed that King Charles III was involved in a top-secret incident involving the enigmatic SCP Foundation and one of its most dangerous anomalies — SCP-682, the so-called “Hard-to-Destroy Reptile.”

According to unverified documents obtained by The Guardian Underground, a covert containment breach occurred on April 17th, when SCP-682, a hyper-aggressive, nigh-indestructible reptilian entity, escaped from its secure facility during a cross-continental transfer. The breach reportedly ended near Windsor Castle, where Foundation forces were forced to intervene in the most unexpected of locations: the royal gardens.

King Charles, who was reportedly in the garden at the time of the incursion performing a routine ecological inspection of the royal beehives, encountered SCP-682 face to face.

A Palace source, speaking under condition of anonymity, described the scene: “His Majesty remained calm and composed, despite the 30-foot monster roaring mere meters away. He reportedly engaged the creature in conversation — an act Foundation personnel later described as 'surprisingly effective in delaying further aggression.'”

While Foundation operatives scrambled to re-establish containment using high-yield sonic deterrents and memetic suppression fields, King Charles was escorted to an underground secure chamber beneath the castle — a room that, according to the leak, had been constructed in the 1960s as part of Project Windsor, a joint MI6-Foundation collaboration.

SCP-682 was successfully re-contained after a five-hour operation, sustaining what observers noted were "temporary subduing injuries." No civilians were harmed during the breach, though several corgis were reported to be “extremely agitated.”

When questioned about the incident this morning during a scheduled public appearance in Birmingham, King Charles smiled and offered only this cryptic response: “Britain has always faced dragons with dignity. This one simply had more teeth.”

The SCP Foundation has, as usual, denied all allegations and issued a standard “mass hallucination” memo, blaming the disturbance on a “rare atmospheric anomaly combined with low-flying weather balloons.”

Meanwhile, Parliament is reportedly pressing for a closed-door meeting regarding “contingency planning for anomalous incursions involving heads of state.”

As of press time, the royal bees are unharmed and continuing their service to the crown.
