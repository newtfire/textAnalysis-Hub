BBC NEWS – ROYALTY & THE PARANORMAL
"King Charles Hosts Historic Tea with SCP-682 at Buckingham Palace"
Published: April 23, 2025

LONDON, UK – In what officials are calling an “unprecedented diplomatic initiative,” His Majesty King Charles III hosted a private tea this afternoon at Buckingham Palace with SCP-682, the highly dangerous and nigh-unkillable reptilian entity contained by the clandestine SCP Foundation.

The Foundation, whose existence was officially denied until this morning’s leaked documents, confirmed the event via a heavily redacted press release. The meeting, it stated, was part of a new global effort to “engage anomalous entities through structured diplomatic channels.”

Sources within the Palace, speaking under the condition of anonymity (and mild existential dread), described the scene as “tense, but oddly polite.” King Charles reportedly insisted on serving Earl Grey “the proper way,” which SCP-682 initially interpreted as a threat but later conceded was “surprisingly pleasant.”

“I have existed for millennia and devoured civilizations,” the reptilian anomaly growled in an official statement delivered telepathically to the BBC. “But the clotted cream was exquisite.”

Despite being classified as Keter – the highest danger level – SCP-682 arrived at the palace under heavy Foundation escort, with at least twelve Mobile Task Forces stationed around London, and the London Eye briefly converted into a high-yield railgun platform “just in case.”

The King, ever a champion of climate action and interspecies diplomacy, allegedly proposed a five-point plan to SCP-682 titled “Survival with Dignity,” suggesting reforms to containment protocols that “emphasize empathy, not incineration.”

Reactions to the meeting have been mixed. Monarchists have hailed the King’s bravery, with one supporter on social media declaring, “Not even a reptilian abomination can match Charles’ tea etiquette.” Critics, however, argue the event risks exposing humanity to greater dangers, with MP Nigel Harbinger demanding “an immediate cessation of all tea-based diplomacy with apocalyptic lizards.”

The SCP Foundation refused to confirm rumors that SCP-682 now refers to King Charles as “the Mild Yet Cunning One.”

The Palace has yet to confirm whether further meetings will take place. However, insiders say the King is tentatively scheduling a “Parliamentary Roundtable with the anomalous community,” including SCP-049 (“The Plague Doctor”), SCP-999 (“The Tickle Monster”), and a cursed taxidermy ferret discovered in Norfolk.

As one unnamed aide said, “If anyone can charm a hate-filled immortal lizard with world-ending tendencies, it’s His Majesty.”
