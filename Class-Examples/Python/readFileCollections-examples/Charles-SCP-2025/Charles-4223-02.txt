👑 King Charles Temporarily Relocates to SCP Foundation Site-77 Following SCP-4223 Encounter
By: Eleanor St. James, Senior Political Correspondent

In a stunning turn of events, Buckingham Palace confirmed today that His Majesty King Charles III has been temporarily relocated to Site-77, a high-security facility operated by the shadowy SCP Foundation, following an encounter with the anomalous entity known as SCP-4223.

The entity, described in declassified Foundation documents as a “temporal echo with memetic resonance,” is believed to have manifested inside Balmoral Castle during the King’s spring retreat last week. The incident reportedly triggered a series of localized temporal distortions, including a brief regression of the King’s age to approximately 12 years old, and the spontaneous performance of a 19th-century Scottish folk hymn by all present.

"We can confirm that His Majesty experienced an anomalous event of a temporal nature," said Royal Press Secretary Margaret Ellison. "At the advice of interagency security teams, he has been moved to a secure containment-adjacent observation wing at Site-77. He remains in good health and is receiving the best care available—both medical and metaphysical."

Sources within the SCP Foundation, speaking on condition of anonymity, revealed that SCP-4223 has previously shown interest in individuals of “significant symbolic power,” including former heads of state, religious figures, and—in one unusual case—a reigning chess grandmaster. However, this marks the first time a reigning monarch has had direct contact.

Foundation researchers are now investigating a possible lineage-based memetic attractor, speculating that the anomalous nature of British royal bloodlines—frequently the subject of folklore and conspiracy—may have interacted unpredictably with SCP-4223.

“The King began quoting Sir Isaac Newton in Middle English while walking backward through time,” said one junior researcher. “It was disconcerting, but also oddly poetic.”

The public remains largely in the dark, with government statements attributing the King’s absence to a “routine diplomatic retreat.” Nevertheless, online speculation is rampant, with hashtags like #KingInContainment and #RoyalSCP trending across platforms.

In a rare show of transparency, Prime Minister Laura Whitmore held a brief press conference late Tuesday, assuring the nation that “His Majesty is not possessed, duplicated, or in any way chronologically fragmented.”

Meanwhile, Buckingham Palace staff have resumed normal operations, with Queen Camilla reportedly holding private meetings with Foundation liaisons and “investigating ancient genealogical texts.”

🧪 What is SCP-4223?
According to leaked Foundation files, SCP-4223 is a class-E temporal anomaly with sentient properties, often manifesting as a chorus of disembodied voices reciting events "yet to occur." Its containment protocol includes continuous playback of Bach’s Brandenburg Concerto No. 3 and the presence of an ordained Anglican bishop trained in quantum theology.

More updates as the situation develops. For now, the King rests under the world’s strangest security protocol—guarded not by soldiers, but by chronomancers, cryptohistorians, and thaumaturges.
