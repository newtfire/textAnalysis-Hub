King Charles III Allegedly Trapped in “Infinite IKEA” Dimension — Palace Remains Silent
LONDON – A royal security scare took an extraordinary turn this week as King Charles III reportedly vanished during a routine visit to a newly opened IKEA showroom in Milton Keynes—only to allegedly reappear 37 hours later, disheveled, muttering about “the Faceless Staff” and “Swedish meatballs that never end.”

According to eyewitnesses, the King was touring the store for a sustainable furniture initiative when he walked through an unmarked “staff-only” door and did not return. Store employees claimed the corridor in question did not exist prior to the incident.

“I just saw His Majesty turn a corner past the light fixtures,” said customer Linda Carmichael. “Next thing I know, people are shouting, there’s alarms, and no King. Only a box of partially assembled LÖVBACKEN tables where he’d been standing.”

Enter SCP-3008
Sources within the government’s classified Department of Unusual Events (DUE) have confirmed a high-level collaboration with the shadowy SCP Foundation, a secretive organization tasked with containing anomalous phenomena. According to leaked documents, the IKEA in question may be a local manifestation of SCP-3008 — an extradimensional retail space that resembles a standard IKEA but stretches infinitely and houses strange humanoid entities referred to as “Staff.”

A Foundation spokesperson, who spoke under the condition of anonymity, stated:

“We’ve had encounters with SCP-3008 across several locations globally. Once inside, individuals are cut off from reality. Escaping is rare. The fact that King Charles emerged at all—let alone intact—is… concerning.”

Royal Return: Changed Man or Monarch with Meatball Madness?
When King Charles returned, he was reportedly found at 3:14 a.m. in the store’s parking lot, barefoot and holding a bent HEMNES chair leg like a scepter. Multiple sources suggest he insisted on being referred to as “King of Aisle 9.”

Buckingham Palace released a brief statement late Tuesday:

“His Majesty is in good health and resting. He appreciates the concern of the public. No further comment will be made at this time.”

Inside sources, however, reveal the King has taken to issuing royal decrees regarding furniture arrangement, insists all light bulbs in Windsor be “500 lumens or less,” and refers to his grandchildren as “fellow survivors.”

Public Reaction and Conspiracy Theories
Online communities have erupted in speculation, with hashtags like #InfiniteIKEA and #Charles3008 trending worldwide. Some suggest this is a government cover-up. Others believe the King may now be a dimensional doppelgänger.

Dr. Ingrid Larch, an expert in anomalous sociology, warns:

“If SCP-3008 is bleeding into our world again, it may signify a dimensional destabilization event. Or maybe IKEA just needs tighter quality control.”

Final Notes
As Britain grapples with a monarch who may or may not have fought off furniture monsters in a parallel retail dimension, one thing is certain: The next time you hear, “The store is now closed, please exit,” you might want to double-check the way out.
