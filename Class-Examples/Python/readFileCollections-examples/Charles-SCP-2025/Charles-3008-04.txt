BREAKING NEWS: King Charles III Vanishes Inside IKEA – Ties to Mysterious SCP-3008 Uncovered

April 23, 2025 | By Lydia Harrow – Global Sentinel News

London, UK – In a story stranger than fiction, Buckingham Palace confirmed today that King Charles III has mysteriously vanished during what was supposed to be a routine, unannounced visit to an IKEA store in Croydon. Royal officials are reportedly in a “state of controlled panic,” and sources now suggest His Majesty may have fallen victim to the strange phenomenon known in classified circles as SCP-3008 – the so-called “Infinite IKEA.”

A Royal Disappearance
Witnesses claim King Charles was seen entering the Croydon IKEA around 10:45 a.m. yesterday morning, accompanied by a minimal security detail. The visit was part of a quiet campaign to promote British design and sustainable furniture. However, when the store closed for the evening, the king was nowhere to be found.

Store employees initially believed he had left early through a VIP exit – until royal guards failed to locate him. A full lockdown and search of the premises yielded nothing, leading to involvement from the British Intelligence Service and an unknown American agency reportedly operating under the codename “Foundation.”

The Infinite IKEA Theory
Insiders now believe the king may have entered SCP-3008, an alleged extra-dimensional anomaly disguised as a typical IKEA retail outlet. According to leaked Foundation documents, once a person enters SCP-3008, they become trapped inside an endless labyrinth of furniture, ruled by nightmarish humanoid employees who enforce obscure store policies with violence.

“Most people think it’s just creepypasta,” said Dr. Lena Mirek, a former consultant for NATO’s anomalous threats division. “But if SCP-3008 is real and active in Croydon… we have a situation far beyond public comprehension. The monarchy may be navigating the most dangerous showroom in existence.”

Attempts at Rescue
British and American forces have cordoned off the store, citing “structural anomalies” and an “unexpected security concern.” Meanwhile, Foundation operatives have reportedly initiated Protocol LÖMN-8, a high-risk extraction mission involving agents trained in both combat and IKEA navigation logic.

A former SCP operative, speaking under anonymity, said:
"If the king is inside, he’s likely encountered one of the many self-organized communities that form in the store's inner zones. Survival is possible, but it depends on how quickly you learn to build forts out of BILLY bookcases and avoid the staff after dark."

The Palace Responds
In an official statement this morning, Buckingham Palace assured the public that King Charles is “safe in spirit and ever devoted to the Crown,” while declining to provide further details. Rumors suggest Prince William has been briefed as acting head of state in the event of extended royal absence.

Royal fans and conspiracy theorists alike have gathered outside the Croydon location, holding candles, protest signs, and one large banner reading, “BRING OUR KING OUT OF IKEA.”

What Comes Next?
With the store still sealed and officials refusing to confirm or deny the SCP-3008 connection, the world waits. If the reports are true, King Charles III may now be leading a ragtag band of survivors through a fluorescent-lit hellscape of flat-pack despair.

As one anonymous Reddit user and alleged SCP-3008 survivor posted late last night:
"God save the King. And someone bring him a LACK table – it makes a decent shield."
