    "NLTK shows us some weird part of speech tagging. We might decide that it's just a bit unreliable here. In this notebook, we're going to compare the part of speech tagging from NLTK with a newer library called spaCy that's used widely in industry for natural language processing (NLP). We'll also practice preparing some simple files for output. \n",

    "Like NLTK's collections that we downloaded, [spaCy has trained language models](https://spacy.io/usage/models) to download. You download these in your Python script after you import spacy, and after you download once, you don't need to do it again (so you can comment out the download line). We're going to try the medium and large models in English. (It's good to know that both spaCy and NLTK have resources for NLP on other languages, too!)  "
