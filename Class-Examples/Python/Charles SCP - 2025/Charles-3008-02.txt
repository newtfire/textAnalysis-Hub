👑 MONARCH LOST IN IKEA: KING CHARLES EMERGES FROM MYSTERIOUS SCP-3008 DIMENSION AFTER DAYS MISSING

April 23, 2025 – London, UK

In an astonishing turn of events, Buckingham Palace has confirmed that King Charles III was located and safely extracted from a bizarre extradimensional space known as SCP-3008, four days after his unexplained disappearance from public view.

The King, 76, was last seen on Saturday entering an IKEA in Milton Keynes under what palace sources called a "private outing." He reportedly intended to purchase a new reading lamp for his study. Security footage shows him walking past a display of LERSTA lamps and then vanishing into thin air.

Unbeknownst to the public, the store was covertly identified by the SCP Foundation as a manifestation point of SCP-3008 — a massive, reality-bending alternate dimension masquerading as a never-ending IKEA store. Once inside, escape becomes nearly impossible due to shifting layouts, hostile humanoid creatures in IKEA uniforms, and distorted perceptions of time.

💬 "We are relieved beyond words. His Majesty showed extraordinary resilience, forming a small alliance with other lost shoppers and even leading nightly foraging expeditions for meatballs," said Lady Penelope Hargrave, Royal Press Secretary.

SCP Foundation sources, speaking under strict anonymity, revealed that the King had ascended to a kind of symbolic leadership within the trapped community, dubbed the “Flatpack Realm.” Survivors referred to him respectfully as “The Regal Assembler,” crediting his diplomacy in quelling factional disputes over bunk bed territories and limited lingonberry preserves.

Rescue was achieved through a rare breach in the SCP-3008 perimeter, temporarily stabilized by Foundation agents using a combination of experimental anchor devices and strategically-placed BILLY bookcases. King Charles emerged holding an Allen key and what he described as “a newfound appreciation for minimalism and chaos.”

In a short televised address upon his return, the King quipped, “One must always read the instructions… even when trapped in a cursed IKEA. Especially then.”

The Milton Keynes IKEA has been indefinitely closed for “renovations,” with Foundation operatives overseeing the site. Citizens are urged to report any furniture stores that appear to have infinite hallways or disembodied cries of “The store is now closed, please exit the building.”
