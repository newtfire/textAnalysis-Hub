The Crown and the Containment: King Charles and the Secrets of SCP-4950
By Eleanor Mathers | The Observer International | April 23, 2025

LONDON, ENGLAND — In a bizarre and unprecedented twist fit more for a science fiction thriller than the British monarchy, Buckingham Palace officials have neither confirmed nor denied growing rumors that His Majesty King Charles III recently participated in a high-security briefing concerning a top-secret entity known only as SCP-4950.

Leaked documents, allegedly from a clandestine organization known as the "SCP Foundation," describe SCP-4950 as a non-linear temporal anomaly localized to the British Isles and specifically linked to royal bloodlines. The documents suggest that SCP-4950 "manifests" during moments of national instability—and that it has done so since the days of King Arthur.

According to the leaks, SCP-4950 is described as “The Echoing Monarch”—a spectral figure bearing the visage of deceased kings and queens, whose presence causes localized disruptions in time, memory, and historical record. These disruptions, if not neutralized, reportedly result in “repeated history,” forcing the UK to relive political blunders, scandals, or wars.

Sources inside MI13, the UK’s arcane and paranormal intelligence agency, report that King Charles was “briefed in-person” at an undisclosed site in Northumberland, believed to be a repurposed Cold War bunker now used as a containment facility for anomalous entities. No official comment has been made by the Palace, though insiders claim the King has become increasingly obsessed with ancient documents, including unpublished pages from the Domesday Book and a journal belonging to Queen Victoria referencing 'the ghost of what could be.'

Conspiracy theorists and fringe royal watchers have long speculated that certain royal ceremonies—such as the Coronation Oath or the Yeoman Warders’ midnight watch—serve secret containment protocols to suppress SCP-4950’s influence.

Historian Dr. Imogen Welby of Oxford dismissed the rumors as "absurd mythmaking," but added, “What’s truly strange is the number of archived royal correspondences that mention ‘the recurring king’—it’s a pattern I can’t ignore.”

Meanwhile, the SCP Foundation itself, if it exists at all, has issued no public statement. Their supposed motto, “Secure, Contain, Protect,” now echoes eerily through online forums and encrypted message boards as more documents surface.

For now, the British public remains unaware—or unconcerned—with what may or may not be lurking in the shadows of its monarchy. But one thing is certain: if SCP-4950 is real, history may be far less stable than we thought.
