BREAKING: King Charles Reportedly Encounters SCP-4223 During Visit to Balmoral Estate

By Eliza Tamsin, Royal Correspondent – April 23, 2025

BALMORAL, SCOTLAND – In an extraordinary turn of events that has stunned both the public and palace officials, reports have emerged that His Majesty King Charles III had an "unprecedented and anomalous encounter" with a classified entity allegedly known as SCP-4223 during a private retreat at the Balmoral Estate over the weekend.

While Buckingham Palace has issued a brief statement citing the King’s “continued good health and high spirits,” anonymous sources within the Ministry of Defence and an obscure organization referred to only as "The Foundation" have revealed that the encounter was not only real—but potentially world-altering.

What is SCP-4223?
Classified in obscure documents as SCP-4223, the entity is reportedly a "temporal-phenomenological convergence" manifesting as an ancient stag composed entirely of fog and whispers. According to unverified leaks from Foundation documents, the creature appears only under specific lunar alignments near sites of royal lineage.

SCP-4223 is said to speak in Middle English, and its appearances are typically accompanied by brief collapses in local time-space consistency, affecting clocks, compasses, and digital devices within a 3-kilometer radius.

The Encounter
Sources close to the royal protection unit claim the stag appeared at dusk, emerging from a low-lying mist that rolled suddenly across the glen. King Charles, known for his deep reverence for nature and the mystic traditions of the British Isles, reportedly approached the being alone, citing a "deep inner calling."

What transpired next remains heavily redacted. However, one insider stated the King “held a conversation with the creature lasting precisely six minutes, though all nearby timepieces recorded only two.” Upon return, the King allegedly said, “It spoke of Arthur’s return, and the fall of the Fourth Veil.”

Foundation agents were reportedly dispatched to Balmoral within the hour. The estate has since been declared a Level-3 Temporal Containment Zone, and residents in surrounding areas have reported “dreams of crown-shaped constellations” and “antlers made of mist watching from the forest line.”

Official Response
Buckingham Palace declined to comment on the nature of the encounter, though Queen Camilla was seen leaving Balmoral the following morning carrying what appeared to be an old vellum scroll wrapped in tartan silk. Royal astrologer Hester Dawnsbury, when questioned by reporters, cryptically responded, “The Horned One walks again. Let the throne be still.”

The Foundation, contacted through unofficial channels, neither confirmed nor denied the incident, stating only:

“SCP-4223 remains contained within acceptable parameters. No further public engagement is necessary at this time.”

Public Reaction and Conspiracy Theories
Social media has erupted with speculation. #StagOfTheCrown and #SCP4223 trended globally within hours. Conspiracy forums are already ablaze with theories suggesting that the King may have been “anointed by an eldritch force,” or worse—replaced.

A viral TikTok claims the King’s left eye now reflects starlight, even indoors.

What’s Next?
With questions mounting and no clear answers forthcoming, one thing remains certain: the Crown may sit heavier than ever before, especially if the whispers of the woods have truly returned.
