NOTE: Another version of this play aired Nov 30 1950 on SUSPENSE. This 
transcript includes some material from the '50 broadcast in brackets. In the 
'50 version, the serial killer is named "The Avenger"; in the '55, the killer 
is named, apparently in error, both "The Avenger" and "The Thirteenth 
Apostle." For clarity's sake, this transcript changes all references to "The 
Avenger." 



MUSIC: THEME ... THEN BEHIND ANNOUNCER--

ANNOUNCER: And now tonight's presentation of Radio's Outstanding Theatre of 
Thrills -- SUSPENSE! Tonight we bring you a story of a manhunt that ends in a 
church. We call it, "The Lady in the Red Hat." So now, starring Mr. Vic 
Perrin, here is tonight's SUSPENSE play, "The Lady in the Red Hat." 

MUSIC: UP AND OUT

SOUND: NEWSROOM BACKGROUND ... MITCH'S FOOTSTEPS TO OFFICE DOOR WHICH OPENS

BANNING: Hello, Mitch. Come in, sit down.

SOUND: DOOR CLOSES BEHIND--

MITCH: Thanks. What's the trouble?

BANNING: Orders to stop those articles you're writing.

SOUND: DURING ABOVE, MITCH'S STEPS TO CHAIR WHICH SCRAPES AS HE SITS

MITCH: Why?

BANNING: Well, it's not so much the Avenger, as the way you keep harping on 
those theories you've got about him.

MITCH: Well, I think I'm right!

BANNING: I know. So does the chief. But you've got every woman in the city 
scared to death. That's why he wants you to lay off.

MITCH: Look, five women have been murdered by the Avenger in three months. And 
they were all wearing red in their clothes. I say that means something! (WITH 
DISGUST) And they want me to lay off.

BANNING: This isn't <u>me</u>. We hired you to do the feature column in the Sunday 
supplement because you've got a big following. "Psychology of Murder," it's a 
great idea, but--

SOUND: INTERCOM BUZZES

BANNING: Excuse me.

SOUND: CLICK! OF SWITCH

BANNING: Yeah?

RECEPTIONIST: (FILTER) Mr. Banning? Is Mr. Mitchell in there?

BANNING: Yeah.

RECEPTIONIST: (FILTER) Will you tell him his housekeeper's on the phone? She 
says it's urgent.

BANNING: All right. Switch the call in here. 

RECEPTIONIST: (FILTER) Yes, sir.

SOUND: CLICK! OF SWITCH

BANNING: Use this phone, Mitch.

MITCH: Oh. Thanks. 

SOUND: CHAIR SCRAPES AS MITCH RISES ... HIS STEPS TO PHONE ... RECEIVER UP

MITCH: (INTO PHONE) Hello? -- Oh, yes, Mrs. White. -- Oh? -- Will you repeat 
the message please? -- Thank you. -- No, don't worry, it's all right. -- Yes, 
I won't be home until after midnight then. -- Yes. Goodbye. 

SOUND: RECEIVER DOWN

BANNING: Anything wrong?

MITCH: I don't know. I'll find out, though. An anonymous note slipped under my 
door; somebody wants me to meet the Avenger at midnight.

MUSIC: BRIDGE

SOUND: NEWSROOM BACKGROUND (REPORTERS MURMUR, TELETYPE MACHINES CHATTER, ET 
CETERA) ... MITCH'S STEPS THROUGH ROOM TO JEANNIE'S CLACKING TYPEWRITER ... 
JEANNIE FINISHES TYPING AND PULLS THE PAPER FROM THE MACHINE

MITCH: Good evening.

JEANNIE: Oh! Hi, Mitch. I thought you were going to wait downstairs.

MITCH: I was, but Banning wanted to see me. Naylor called him. The police 
department wants me to stop my articles.

JEANNIE: Why?

MITCH: Oh, I'll tell you while were eating.

SOUND: JEANNIE RISES (SCRAPE OF CHAIR) AND SHE AND MITCH WALK THROUGH 
NEWSROOM, THROUGH DOOR, AND ONTO TRAFFIC-FILLED STREET DURING FOLLOWING--

JEANNIE: They say anything about <u>my</u> stuff?

MITCH: No. No, yours is straight reporting. It's <u>theorizing</u> they object to. 
Maybe I'm getting too close.

JEANNIE: Have you written anything on last night's murder? I'd like to read 
it.

MITCH: I won't be writing it now. But if I did, I know what I'd say.

JEANNIE: Have you got something new, Mitch?

MITCH: Something new? Maybe. I don't know yet.

MUSIC: BRIDGE ... THEN BEHIND MITCH--

MITCH: (NARRATES) "Meet The Avenger at twelve o'clock" -- and the Avenger 
could be anyone. [Was <u>she</u> the one? This tall girl with long legs; smart, self-
possessed career woman with fresh-faced innocence?] We waited for the 
elevator. I watched. Tired faces drifting into boxes lowering them to the 
street -- and then outside into darkness, growing cold with snow and night's 
wind. And she was there with me, a smile on her lips. We went to a place for 
dinner.

MUSIC: CHANGES TO SOFT DINNER MUSIC ... IN BG

SOUND: RESTAURANT BACKGROUND ... PLATES, UTENSILS, ET CETERA

JEANNIE: You know, Mitch, I love this place. My favorite hangout after work.

MITCH: That's why I brought you here. 

JEANNIE: (CHUCKLES)

MITCH: Though I was beginning to wonder why you've been so quiet. Subdued 
lights and warmth -- is that it?

JEANNIE: In a way.

MITCH: Oh? Something else, too?

JEANNIE: Mitch, tell me now. What do you think about it?

MITCH: It?

JEANNIE: The Avenger.

MITCH: You've read my articles. That's what I think.

JEANNIE: No, I don't mean what you write. I do that, too. I mean <u>you</u>. What do 
<u>you</u> think?

MITCH: Well, I <u>have</u> to write about him; must I talk about him, too?

JEANNIE: (YES) Mm hmm.

MITCH: (GIVES IN) All right. I think he's fantastic. Consider the name he -- 
or she -- has chosen for himself, "The Avenger." Probably wants to purge the 
world because of its sins.

JEANNIE: But that's what you said in your articles.

MITCH: Well, that's what I think.

JEANNIE: And all that stuff about the color red?

MITCH: It means something. Perhaps a sinful color. The obsession of red is a 
symbol. There's a tie-up.

JEANNIE: [That makes me a marked woman, doesn't it?

MITCH: You mean your - your scarf?

JEANNIE: Mm hm. You gave it to me, remember?

MITCH: That's right. I might be the man.

JEANNIE: Yes. But why couldn't the Avenger be a woman?

MITCH: She could.

JEANNIE: Well, that case last night -- the old woman. Why kill her? She wasn't 
pretty. She was just - old.

MITCH: Rather obvious. She worked at the Follies.

JEANNIE: But she was only a scrubwoman.

MITCH: But she worked there. Sinful. There you are. She carried a red purse, 
too.]

JEANNIE: Listen, I want to tell you something, something big. [Even the editor 
doesn't know it.]

MITCH: A story?

JEANNIE: [<u>The</u> story.] (HESITANT) Can I have another drink?

MITCH: Oh, I'm sorry. (CALLS) Mario?

MARIO: (OFF) Coming, sir.

JEANNIE: I got an anonymous note this morning.

MITCH: A note? Well, that's odd.

JEANNIE: What do you mean?

MITCH: Because--

MARIO: Yes, Mr. Mitchell?

MITCH: (TO JEANNIE) Oh, uh, the same?

JEANNIE: Yes, please.

MARIO: And, uh, <u>you</u>, Mr. Mitchell?

MITCH: Nothing, thanks. 

MARIO: Yes, sir.

MITCH: Oh, by the way, when a Lieutenant Dowell comes in, will you show him to 
this table, please?

MARIO: But of course! (MOVING OFF) Yes, sir.

JEANNIE: Bill Dowell? He's on the Avenger case! Are you holding out on me, 
Mitch?

MITCH: You, uh, were speaking of a note -- anonymous. Did it say anything 
about - the Avenger?

JEANNIE: Yes. Yes, it did. If I wanted important information about the 
Avenger, I was to go at midnight to the community chapel on Seventh. [It's 
such a lonely old building, I--]

MITCH: Have you got the note with you?

JEANNIE: No, I left it at home.

MITCH: Oh? Did it tell you to sit in the first pew and wait?

JEANNIE: You got one, too?

MITCH: This afternoon, under my door at home; the housekeeper called.

JEANNIE: The same thing!

MITCH: It's queer, isn't it?

JEANNIE: I wonder.

MITCH: What?

JEANNIE: This isn't an ordinary tip, don't you see? I've been working on this 
story for "The Standard"; you've been doing your series [in the magazine 
section, "Psychology of Murder"]. Supposing--

MITCH: The Avenger sent the notes?

JEANNIE: Well?

MITCH: Uh, Bill Dowell called me earlier; he wanted to see me. 

JEANNIE: Oh?

MITCH: I said I was taking you out for dinner; I told him to meet us here.

JEANNIE: Why?

MITCH: The lieutenant claims he received a note like ours, too.

MUSIC: BRIDGE ... THEN BEHIND MITCH--

MITCH: (NARRATES) Could she be the one? Or Dowell? Millions of people in a 
city and the person next to you a killer? You just couldn't believe it was 
someone you knew. [Never anyone you knew, but maybe it was.] Was that then the 
ultimate stimulation? [Had it come to that?] To kill a stranger was not 
enough. Now, seek out the danger, the extreme risk -- because there <u>was</u> 
emotion here, emotion of friendship. That was different, and who might it be? 
The girl on the newspaper? Or the policeman?

MUSIC: CHANGES TO SOFT DINNER MUSIC ... IN BG

SOUND: RESTAURANT BACKGROUND

JEANNIE: Are you being stubborn because you're a policeman, or because you're 
just pigheaded, Lieutenant?

DOWELL: Jeannie, you're a reporter -- too much imagination. I still think it's 
a crackpot gag.

JEANNIE: Then why did you come?

DOWELL: Well, because Mitch and I have been working together on this, and 
because we're all friends. I'm not taking any chances. There have been five 
murders already.

MITCH: She makes sense though, Bill. Three of us, all vitally interested in 
the case. It'd be very flattering to him if we turned up at the chapel at 
midnight.

JEANNIE: I'll be there, I can tell ya that!

DOWELL: I don't like it. He might be after one of us. Maybe you, Jeannie. 
Maybe he doesn't like some of the stuff you've been writing about him.

MITCH: Maybe me.

DOWELL: Maybe. Or me. I'm the cop who's chasing him.

JEANNIE: Yes, I don't imagine he's particularly fond of you, Bill.

MITCH: Well, why not surround the chapel?

DOWELL: No. Mind you, I still think it's a crank note, but if it isn't, this 
baby's too smart. If he sees anything wrong, he'll get away.

MITCH: Well, you've used police cordons before to get a killer. There must be 
enough buildings around to hide in.

DOWELL: I'm still not taking any chances.

JEANNIE: I think Billy wants all the credit for a dramatic capture.

DOWELL: I'd have to share it with Mitch anyway.

JEANNIE: And me!

DOWELL: (NO WAY) Uh uh. You're going home.

JEANNIE: Oh, that's what you think! I'm on that list. I want to be there when 
something happens.

MUSIC: BRIDGE [... THEN BEHIND MITCH--

MITCH: (NARRATES) We had dinner in that little bar. Somehow none of us wanted 
to leave. Outside was the night -- cold. Through the window and on the 
pavement we could see a cover of snow -- snow, silent and clean. I thought of 
a knife flashing, and then the snow -- soft, absorbent -- no longer white, 
turning red, until it spread over the entire city. The neon sign outside 
flashed red - red - red. And at our table it was warm and candlelit. (PAUSE) 
Then we were outside and the snow was falling.]

SOUND: MITCH, JEANNIE, AND DOWELL'S FOOTSTEPS ON SNOW-COVERED SIDEWALK AS THEY 
STROLL TO THE CHAPEL ... OCCASIONAL TRAFFIC NOISE AND A HEAVY STEADY WIND 
BLOWS, IN BG

MITCH: Do you know where the chapel is, Bill?

DOWELL: Yeah, it's the one on Seventh, just around the corner there. 

MITCH: That's funny. I must have passed it a hundred times. (CHUCKLES) Never 
noticed it.

JEANNIE: Most people think it's vacant, but it's not. In fact, it's open all 
night. 

MITCH: How do you know, Jeannie?

JEANNIE: I dunno; I guess I heard about it. (BEAT) You know, I always used to 
like the snow; looked forward to it. I don't like it tonight.

DOWELL: I never liked it. There's something smothering about the stuff; I was 
in a blizzard once.

MITCH: What happened?

DOWELL: (UNCOMFORTABLY) I - I was lost in the woods up north and nearly froze 
to death. The snow kept coming down, got in my mouth, and my nose, and - and 
eyes, and, after a while, things didn't look white any more; they were blurred 
and - red.

MITCH: Well, what frightens you more, fear of being lost or fear of dying?

DOWELL: I don't know. Why?

MITCH: Just wondered.

MUSIC: THE CHAPEL'S ORGAN SNEAKS IN ... CONTINUES IN BG

JEANNIE: Anybody got the time?

MITCH: (CHECKS HIS WATCH) Oh. It's eleven o'clock. 

DOWELL: Let's go in. 

[[MUSIC: BRIDGE ... THEN BEHIND MITCH--

MITCH: (NARRATES) We stood outside the community chapel. It was on a side 
street. I remember the lamp post with its light so much brighter than usual. 
Everything was white, but not beautiful. There was a murderer here. In all of 
this great city, the murderer stood looking up at a church spire. And who knew 
it? We went up the broad steps, slowly.]]

SOUND: THEIR FOOTSTEPS UP A LONG SET OF STAIRS TO CHAPEL DOOR, WHICH OPENS ... 
THEIR STEPS IN ... DOOR CLOSES ... THEIR STEPS THROUGH CHAPEL, IN BG; THEIR 
VOICES HUSHED--

MUSIC: ORGAN GROWS LOUDER IN AGREEMENT WITH ABOVE ... CONTINUES IN BG

JEANNIE: Funny.

MITCH: What is?

JEANNIE: If one of us were killed here.

SOUND: THEIR FOOTSTEPS SLOW TO A STOP

DOWELL: I'm gonna have a look around, check any side doors. 

MITCH: All right.

DOWELL: You stay here.

MITCH: Yeah.

SOUND: DOWELL'S STEPS AWAY

JEANNIE: The music's nice. There's the organist up there; see him?

MITCH: Have you ever noticed how even in an empty place like this, one speaks 
softly?

JEANNIE: Yes.

MITCH: Wonder why it's always so quiet.

JEANNIE: I wonder. (BEAT) Why are you looking at me like that?

MITCH: Was I?

JEANNIE: Yes. Why?

MITCH: Perhaps I was thinking how strange it'd be if one of us were the 
Avenger. 

MUSIC: FIRST ACT CURTAIN ... THEN IN BG

ANNOUNCER: You are listening to "The Lady in the Red Hat," tonight's 
presentation in Radio's Outstanding Theatre of Thrills, SUSPENSE!

MUSIC: THREE CHORDS AND OUT

ANNOUNCER: Every Saturday night over most of these same stations CBS Radio 
picks up the threads of a startling story of people who call the police -- and 
often of people who call on police and the other way around -- working out of 
21ST PRECINCT. There's fast-moving drama, and an intimate glimpse into the 
human side of police work, Saturday nights on CBS Radio when you're invited to 
hear THE 21ST PRECINCT.

MUSIC: THEME IN 

ANNOUNCER: And now we bring back to our Hollywood sound stage Mr. Vic Perrin 
starring in tonight's production, "The Lady in the Red Hat," a tale well-
calculated to keep you in - SUSPENSE!

MUSIC: THEME UP AND OUT ... THEN SECOND ACT INTRODUCTION ... CHANGES TO CHAPEL 
ORGAN, IN BG

[MITCH: (NARRATES) We stood there in the chapel looking at each other. Now it 
had started; it had been said aloud. What if one of us were a killer? Not the 
ever-present shabby man seen by witnesses loitering on a lonely street, but 
one of us. If not Jean Gray, would she think it me? Or Bill Dowell, the 
policeman? It was an odd game, a game of fear. Who'll kill Cock Robin? The 
Avenger. And who'll <u>be</u> Cock Robin?]

JEANNIE: (SKEPTICAL) One of us? The Avenger? Oh, Mitch!

MITCH: Well, it has to be someone.

JEANNIE: I believe you're serious.

MITCH: I am. We've all been on the case since the first death. Perhaps one of 
us enjoys the publicity, the thrill of killing.

JEANNIE: Are you trying to frighten me?

MITCH: No.

JEANNIE: I don't like this place.

DOWELL: (IN CLOSE) Better go home then.
 
JEANNIE: (STARTLED GASP)

DOWELL: Jitters, Jeannie?

MITCH: What did you find, Bill?

DOWELL: One side exit, that's all. We can see it from the front pew.

JEANNIE: What's the time?

DOWELL: About a quarter past eleven.

JEANNIE: Oh, I'm cold. Wonder if we could get some coffee.

DOWELL: There's a place on the corner; I'll - I'll get it. You two stay here. 
How do you like yours?

JEANNIE: Just black.

MITCH: The same.

DOWELL: Right. I'll be back in five minutes. Take it easy, Jeannie. (MOVING 
OFF) It's not twelve yet. 

SOUND: DOWELL'S STEPS AWAY

MITCH: Want to sit down?

JEANNIE: Up in the front? No, not yet.

MITCH: All right, here then. 

SOUND: THEIR STEPS TO PEW ... THEY SIT

JEANNIE: Mitch? You weren't serious, were you?

MITCH: Yes. 

JEANNIE: Mitch!

MITCH: Well, you've read my articles. I've theorized about the Avenger. The 
analysis could fit any one of us.

JEANNIE: Me?

MITCH: Well, why not? You're fairly strong; you could have done it. 

JEANNIE: [But the victims have all been women. Why should I kill a woman?]

MITCH: You like excitement, danger. You've often said you don't get along with 
women, you never have. [Your favorite color is red. Your scarf, for instance--

JEANNIE: (SUDDENLY TENSE) Don't!

MITCH: (SURPRISED) You - you afraid to be touched?

JEANNIE: Well, no, I--

MITCH: You like men, but you don't like them to touch you. You like me--]

JEANNIE: That doesn't mean I'd--

MITCH: [Ah! I'm right, aren't I? Now think of the five dead woman -- all of 
them in some way concerned with what the Avenger considers sinful.] It <u>could</u> 
be you.

JEANNIE: Or you. Or Bill.

MITCH: Yes, Dowell. I've thought about him. It wouldn't be difficult for him 
to kill and get away with it; easier than most people because he's a 
policeman.

JEANNIE: And you?

MITCH: Perhaps I'm in love. In love with a girl I can never have -- and 
because of that I hate all women.

JEANNIE: That's funny. I never thought of you - in love.

MITCH: Why not?

JEANNIE: Because you're so alone. So-- (EXHALES) I don't know.

MITCH: [No. You don't know.]

MUSIC: BRIDGE ... THEN BEHIND MITCH--

MITCH: (NARRATES) We sat alone with the music. It was everywhere in the chapel 
-- solemn, accusing. The thoughts had been spoken. Fear was creating 
suspicion, and the girl with the red scarf tied about her head, sitting with 
folded hands beside me, looked in front of her, and her eyes were on the front 
pew.

MUSIC: CHANGES TO CHAPEL ORGAN, IN BG

SOUND: DOWELL'S STEPS APPROACH

DOWELL: Sorry I was so long, it seems that half the cab drivers in there were 
getting coffee. Did anything happen?

MITCH: No.

DOWELL: (HANDS OVER COFFEE) Jeannie. 

JEANNIE: Thanks. You know, it seems wrong -- drinking coffee in a chapel.

MITCH: Sinful, Jeannie?

JEANNIE: Oh, stop it! That's not what I meant.

DOWELL: Here, Mitch. 

MITCH: Thanks.

JEANNIE: What's the time, Bill?

DOWELL: Eleven-thirty.

JEANNIE: That all?

DOWELL: I see our friend at the organ's still there.

MITCH: Yeah, it's a funny hour to practice.

DOWELL: Mitch?

MITCH: Hm?

DOWELL: I, uh-- I heard what you said to Jeannie before. I mean, about one of 
us being the Avenger. Were you kiddin'?

MITCH: No.

DOWELL: That's crazy.

MITCH: Well, why? It's got to be somebody, why not one of us?

JEANNIE: (DRY, TO DOWELL) Oh, he's got brilliant reasons. Ask him, we all fit.

DOWELL: It's not a joke any more, Mitch.

MITCH: I know. The trouble with you Bill is you think you have to look for 
some poor devil frothing at the mouth, hands covered with blood. Must a 
murderer always look like a comic book conception of a murderer?

DOWELL: Cut it out, you're not funny.

MITCH: I'm not trying to be. I think it more than probable that one of us 
<u>could</u> be the Avenger. We're normal, moderately attractive people, but one of 
us thinks differently. Which one?

DOWELL: [(CHUCKLES) You're a nut.

MITCH: Maybe.]

MUSIC: BRIDGE ... THEN BEHIND MITCH--

MITCH: (NARRATES) We drank our coffee. There was an animal awareness now, each 
of us watching the other -- cautious, wondering. We spoke of Christmas, of 
sailing, of next year's Dodgers. We spoke of everything but the Avenger, and 
of twelve o'clock.

DOWELL: Look, there's been a lot of crazy talk tonight, Mitch; you started it. 
Now let's get things out.

MITCH: All right, Bill.

DOWELL: I still think those notes we got were from a crackpot, but it's my job 
to investigate. I've gone along with the gag, Mitch, but this - this is 
serious. This talk about Jeannie or me or you--

MITCH: If you think it's a gag, why bother about it?

JEANNIE: What's the matter with you, Mitch? Why don't you stop?!

MITCH: I'm sorry. Let's forget it. We'll leave Bill to sit it out and I'll 
take you home.

DOWELL: I wish you would.

JEANNIE: No, I'm staying!

DOWELL: Hey.

MITCH: What?

DOWELL: [When did the organist leave?

JEANNIE: I - I don't know.]

DOWELL: I hadn't figured on that.

JEANNIE: (UNEASY) Oh.

DOWELL: The lights. There's only one up there now. The organist must have 
turned the others out. Be hard to see anyone coming in from the front pew.

MITCH: Well?

SOUND: DOWELL RISES BEHIND--

DOWELL: I'm going to take a look. I'll see if I can find a janitor.

JEANNIE: No, no.

MITCH: (CHUCKLES) You're not afraid to be alone with me, are you? 

JEANNIE: Don't be an idiot.

DOWELL: If anyone comes in, stay in the shadows.

MITCH: It's nearly twelve.

DOWELL: Might as well get in your places; I'll be right back.

SOUND: DOWELL'S HURRIED STEPS AWAY

MITCH: I guess we'd better.

JEANNIE: The front pew?

MITCH: Yeah. Yeah, those were the instructions. 

SOUND: MITCH AND JEANNIE RISE ... THEIR FOOTSTEPS TO FRONT PEW, IN BG

JEANNIE: It's quiet without the music.

MITCH: It's too quiet; it was nice.

JEANNIE: There's so many shadows.

MITCH: Shadows in a chapel? They shouldn't be frightening.

JEANNIE: Will Bill be able to see us when he comes back?

MITCH: I think so.

SOUND: MITCH AND JEANNIE SIT IN FRONT PEW

JEANNIE: <u>Do</u> you think it's him?

MITCH: Do <u>you</u>?

JEANNIE: What's the time?

MITCH: Mmm, about three minutes to.

JEANNIE: I hope he finds the lights.

MITCH: I don't mind it. (BEAT) Strange.

JEANNIE: What?

MITCH: When I was very young, I was in a place like this -- very much like 
this.

JEANNIE: Oh?

MITCH: I was taken every week. And every week there was a woman who sat across 
the aisle. And she was beautiful. I was in love with her. Nobody ever talked 
to her. My mother hated her, but not my father. Do you know what I found out? 

JEANNIE: No.

MITCH: It was after my father left us. He'd been in love with that woman all 
that time. They ran away together.

JEANNIE: How terrible.

MITCH: Yes, I - I thought so at the time. What tiny things one remembers. She 
always wore a red hat. She was beautiful, but she must have been very wicked.

JEANNIE: (REALIZES, NERVOUS) A - red hat? 

MITCH: Where I lived, they used to say it was the shock of his leaving that 
killed my mother. 

MUSIC: CHAPEL BELL BEGINS TO RING MIDNIGHT OMINOUSLY ... CONTINUES IN BG

JEANNIE: (STIFLES A STARTLED EXCLAMATION)

MITCH: Poor Jeannie, I'm frightening you. Give me your hand, Jeannie.

JEANNIE: No, no.

MITCH: Well, you're cold.

JEANNIE: Don't! Please don't.

MITCH: You're - you're like her. You know, you look like her; you even wear 
red because it's your favorite color.

JEANNIE: Mitch-- Mitch!

MITCH: I'm in love with you, and - and it's so wrong. I've been in love with 
you ever since I met you, but it's <u>wrong</u>. You're bad. You're like <u>her</u>.

JEANNIE: (TRIES TO EXCLAIM, BUT MITCH GRABS HER)

MITCH: Don't scream. Don't.

JEANNIE: (TERRIFIED, SOOTHING) Mitch-- All right. I understand. (BREATHES 
HEAVILY IN FEAR, IN BG)

MITCH: I'm sorry the music stopped. We've got to have music. There was always 
the organ playing at home. Come along, Jeannie.

SOUND: MITCH DRAGS JEANNIE FROM PEW ... THEIR FOOTSTEPS UP STAIRS, IN 
AGREEMENT WITH FOLLOWING--

JEANNIE: Where are we going?

MITCH: We're going upstairs to the organ loft. 

JEANNIE: (WHIMPERS IN FEAR)

MITCH: Now, don't scream, please.

DOWELL: (CALLS, FROM OFF) Mitch? Jeannie? You up front?

MITCH: (LOW, TO JEANNIE) Listen, don't you say anything.

JEANNIE: I won't, I won't. (BEAT, DESPERATELY TRIES TO WIN HIM OVER) Mitch, 
you're not well. I'm glad you told me.

DOWELL: (CALLS, FROM OFF) Mitch? 

JEANNIE: (TO MITCH) I love you, too! 

DOWELL: (CALLS, FROM OFF) Jeannie?

JEANNIE: (TO MITCH) You must believe me! I love you, Mitch. <u>Please</u>!

MUSIC: BRIDGE ... THEN BEHIND MITCH--

MITCH: (NARRATES) She was [a] clever [devil], trying to win me over with talk 
of love. I wasn't going to take any chances with <u>her</u>. We went up the narrow 
stairs to where the organ was; I closed the door behind us. I didn't need my 
knife any more. I could smash her with my hands. I could pound the evil flat 
-- stamp it out on the floor. The other five were bad -- they had sinned -- 
but she was like the woman at home -- the woman in the red hat -- and I knew 
what had to be done with <u>her</u>. I'd known it from the day I'd met her -- tall, 
with long legs, fresh face masking wickedness, and - and that--

DOWELL: (CALLS, FROM OFF) Mitch?! Jeannie? Where are you?

JEANNIE: (DESPERATELY, TO MITCH) Please-- Please-- (WHIMPERS, IN BG)

MITCH: (CALLS) Stay down there, Bill. Don't come up. I - I've got her. You 
stay there. I - I found her out. I've known all the time. She's got to die. 
You know that, Bill.

DOWELL: (CALLS, HUMORING MITCH) I - I'm coming up, Mitch; it's okay! We'll - 
we'll take her in together!

MITCH: (CALLS) That's why I sent those notes, Bill. I - I had to trap her, you 
understand?

DOWELL: (CALLS) Sure, sure.

MITCH: (CALLS) I'm right! I'm right, aren't I?

DOWELL: (COMING CLOSER, BEHIND DOOR) Dead right, Mitch. Open the door; we'll 
take her in together.

SOUND: DOORKNOB RATTLES ... KNOCKING ON DOOR

MITCH: What? No, you stay there, Bill. I don't need your help; I can do it! 

[JEANNIE: (STRAINS TO BE CONVINCING) Mitch, Mitch, you're sick. But it's all 
right. I'll make you better because I love you.]

MITCH: (TO HIMSELF) How do you turn this thing on? Now, there must be a 
switch-- (SHARPLY, TO JEANNIE) Don't you go near that door, Jeannie!

SOUND: POUNDING ON DOOR

DOWELL: (BEHIND DOOR) Mitch! Mitch! Open the door, Mitch!

MITCH: (TO HIMSELF) Here's one. (MURMURS WITH EFFORT BEHIND--)

SOUND: MITCH FLIPS SWITCH ... ORGAN'S MACHINERY WHIRS TO LIFE, CONTINUES IN BG

DOWELL: Mitch! Open it! 

MITCH: In a minute! Don't worry! She won't hurt me; not any more!

JEANNIE: (TEARFUL) Mitch, please! Whatever I've done to you, I'm sorry! 
(WEEPS, IN BG)

MITCH: You're the woman. You're always the woman in red. [But not any more. 
It'll be all right now.] Now play! [There has to be music.] There was music at 
home, at my mother's funeral; now you play!

JEANNIE: I can't! 

MITCH: Play it!

JEANNIE: I don't know how!

MITCH: <u>PLAY</u>!

SOUND: JEANNIE'S SCRAMBLING FOOTSTEPS AS MITCH DRAGS HER TO ORGAN

MUSIC: BAD ORGAN PLAYING ... THEN IN BG

MITCH: You play louder. Louder! Louder! <u>Louder</u>!

SOUND: DOOR BURSTS OPEN ... DOWELL'S RUNNING STEPS IN

MITCH: <u>Louder</u>!

DOWELL: [Mitch!] Drop the knife! [Drop it!]

SOUND: MITCH AND DOWELL GRUNT AND GROAN AS THEY SCUFFLE ... THEN TWO GUNSHOTS

MUSIC: ORGAN OUT
