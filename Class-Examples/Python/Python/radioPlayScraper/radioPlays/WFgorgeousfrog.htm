Hey, hey, don't run away;
Listen awhile, you'll want to stay. 
There's always lots of fun 
Down in Wormwood Forest!

DIPPY: Hello, everybody! This is Dippy Dwarf. Today Frankie Frog gets a phone 
call that sends him hopping!

FRANKIE: (SINGS)
So don't leave your radio.
Listen to our animal show. 
There's always lots of fun 
Down in Wormwood Forest!

MUSIC: UP AND OUT

SOUND: PHONE RINGS

FRANKIE: The phone's ringin', Dippy. Shall I answer it?

DIPPY: You might as well, Frankie Frog. It's probably for you anyway.

FRANKIE: Okay, kiddo. 

SOUND: RECEIVER UP 

FRANKIE: (INTO PHONE) Hello, the Dwarf Waldorf. -- You want to speak to 
Gorgeous Frog? Yeah, just a minute. (TO DIPPY) It's for Gorgeous Frog.

DIPPY: That's <u>you</u>, Frankie. 

FRANKIE: Me? Hey - hey, that's right. I forgot about my wrestlin' name! (INTO 
PHONE) Er, hello? Gorgeous Frog, the newest thing in the wrestling ring, 
speaking. -- Oh, hiya, Fox. What? -- Oh, sure thing. I'll be right over. 
(CHUCKLES) Goodbye.

SOUND: RECEIVER DOWN

DIPPY: Hey, what's up, Gorgeous? 

FRANKIE: It's my manager, Swindler Q. Fox. He wants me to come over to the 
Pig's Hotel right away. 

DIPPY: Going to wrestle in the lobby of the Hominy Plaza?

FRANKIE: No, no. Fox is living over there. He wants to make arrangements for 
my first wrestling match.

DIPPY: Well, here, I'll open the door for you.

SOUND: DOOR OPENS

DIPPY: Certainly hate to see ya goooooo!

FRANKIE: You don't have to push me, I'm goin'. 

SOUND: DOOR CLOSES

FRANKIE: (TO HIMSELF) Sure glad the Pig's Hotel is just across the road. 

MUSIC: TRANSITION

FRANKIE: (TO HIMSELF) Shall I knock -- or does one knock on the door of a 
hotel? Eh, I'll just go in.

SOUND: HOTEL DOOR OPENS ... THEN CLOSES BEHIND--

FOX: Ah! There you are, Frog.

FRANKIE: Hiya, Fox. What's up?

FOX: Do you know what tomorrow is? 

FRANKIE: Er, tomorrow? Fourth of July? Christmas? My birthday? Er, uh--

FOX: To save time, I'll tell you. It's Easter. 

FRANKIE: Easter? Easter Eggs! Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy! 

FOX: Ahhh, what a marvelous idea for your first wrestling match!

FRANKIE: You've really got an opponent all lined up for me?

FOX: Yes! The Easter Bunny. 

FRANKIE: The Easter Bunny?! But-but-but if I beat him, everyone will hate me. 

FOX: Of course. You'll become a perfect villain! (CHUCKLES)

FRANKIE: But I don't want to be a villain. I want to be Gorgeous Frog.

FOX: I'm your manager, Frog. You'll wrestle whomever I say. 

FRANKIE: (DEJECTED) Oh, me. 

FOX: Now, Gorgeous Frog, you must get a suitable robe to wear as you make your 
appearance in the ring.

FRANKIE: Er, what kind of robe? 

FOX: One that will please the ladies. I suggest you get Kitty to help you 
select it.

FRANKIE: Okay, but, er, how do I pay for it? 

FOX: Just charge it to the Pig. 

FRANKIE: Barbara Q. Pig? But will she like that? 

FOX: What does it matter? I sold her a quarter interest in you and that means 
she has to pay all of your expenses that amount to over a quarter. 

FRANKIE: Well then, what am I waiting for? If the Pig pays, then Gorgeous Frog 
will buy and buy and buy. Bye-bye! 

MUSIC: TRANSITION

FRANKIE: (TO HIMSELF) Well, here's the old Badger residence. Susie Skunk and 
Kitty were going shopping today. 

SOUND: FRANKIE RINGS DOORBELL 

FRANKIE: (TO HIMSELF) Gee whiz, I hope they haven't gone already. 

SOUND: DOOR OPENS

SUSIE: If you're working your way through millinery school by selling bebop 
caps, I-- Oh, hello, Frankie Frog! 

FRANKIE: Hiya, Susie Skunk. And the name is Gorgeous Frog, remember?

SUSIE: Oh, yes -- the famous rag-and-bone artist.

FRANKIE: Er, that's grunt-and-groan artist.

SUSIE: Well, what does it matter? I haven't waxed the floors lately anyway. 
Won't you come in?

FRANKIE: I sure will.

SOUND: DOOR CLOSES 

FRANKIE: Is Kitty here?

SUSIE: Oh, yes -- she's in the parlor. (CALLS) Kitty? Look who's here!

KITTY: A frog, as I live and breathe! 

FRANKIE: Hiya, Kitty baby. It's your dream frog, Gorgeous.

KITTY: Oh, rrreow. Am I really gorgeous today? 

FRANKIE: I didn't mean you. I mean me. I'm Gorgeous. 

KITTY: (INSULTED) Oh, so you think you're more gorgeous than I am! Rrrrow!

FRANKIE: I didn't say that, Kitty. 

KITTY: Oh, yes, you did, didn't he, Susie? 

SUSIE: Please. Subtract me from this figuring. I'm neutral.

FRANKIE: (NERVOUS) Hey, hey, Kitty! Here, put down that vase! 

KITTY: I'll put it down on the top of your conceited head! Rrreeow!

SOUND: CRASH! KITTY SMASHES VASE OVER FRANKIE'S HEAD

FRANKIE: (IN PAIN) Oh - oh - oh! My frog head!

SUSIE: Oh, my goodness! You smashed it, Kitty!

KITTY: It was Frankie's fault. His head shouldn't be so hard. 

FRANKIE: That's it -- put all the blame on Gorgeous Frog. 

KITTY: There! You said it again! Rrreow!

SUSIE: Oh, Kitty! That's my priceless antique pitcher!

FRANKIE: Kitty, put that pitcher down!

KITTY: I'll put it down on your-- [?] Rreow!

FRANKIE: No, no!

SOUND: CRASH! KITTY SMASHES PITCHER OVER FRANKIE'S HEAD

FRANKIE: My frog head! Oh, why don't I keep my big frog mouth shut? 

SUSIE: Kitty, please don't smash anything else! It's time for my favorite 
radio program now. 

KITTY: Oh. "Ma Possum"? 

FRANKIE: Or, uh, "Sadie Snake, Girl Reptile"?

KITTY: Or "Lolly, Baby Lobster"?

SUSIE: No. Here, I'll turn on the radio and you'll hear for youself.

SOUND: CLICK! OF RADIO SWITCHED ON

SUSIE: There.

MUSIC: FIRST TWO NOTES OF NBC CHIMES FOLLOWED BY SOME CRITTER'S OUTBURST

ANNCR: (VERY DIGNIFIED) Once again it is the pleasure of the Pine Tree 
Broadcasting Company to present Hedda Hedgehog in "Homemaking Can Be 
Charming," with Ethelbert Bobolink at the organ. 

MUSIC: ORGAN ... MENDELSSOHN'S SPRING SONG ... OUT BEHIND HEDDA--

SOUND: DURING ABOVE, BIRDS CHIRP BRIEFLY

HEDDA: Hello, girls! Homemaking <u>can</u> be charming -- and I'm here to prove it! 
Only yesterday a weasel said to me, "Hedda Hedgehog, everything you do is 
charming. You must lead a charmed life." And I <u>do</u>, girls. Oh, I do! Only 
yesterday I discovered a <u>marvelous</u> new recipe for pickled strawberries. You'll 
just love it, girls! You'll just love Mr. Announcer, oooh!

ANNCR: Hedda dear, here's a request from a listener in Hazelnut Hollow -- to 
read the poem you <u>always</u> read in April. 

HEDDA: Oh, yes, the po-em.

MUSIC: ORGAN ... MENDELSSOHN'S SPRING SONG ... IN BG

HEDDA: It's called: "Home Thoughts from a Bird." Po-em:
(RECITES)
Oh, to be in Wormwood now that April's here. 
Oh, to munch the crunchy lunch
And drink the fresh root beer. 
For when April comes, a bird longs for home
And so do bears, 
And long-eared hares,
And April showers.
(TO THE ORGANIST) Music, Ethelbert.

MUSIC: ORGAN UP ... THEN OUT ABRUPTLY WITH--

SOUND: CLICK! OF RADIO SWITCHED OFF

SUSIE: That's all for today.

FRANKIE: That's enough.

SUSIE: Hedda Hedgehog is <u>so</u> inspiring; <u>so</u> charming.

KITTY: Personally I can take her or leave her. And speaking of leaving, Sue-- 

SUSIE: Oh, it <u>is</u> time to leave if we hope to do any shopping.

FRANKIE: Yeah, but before you go, I've gotta talk to you. 

SUSIE: Who? Me? 

FRANKIE: No. Kitty.

KITTY: I refuse to talk to anyone who thinks he's more gorgeous than I am! 
Rreow! 

FRANKIE: But, Kitty baby, that's my wrestling name: Gorgeous Frog. 

KITTY: (SUDDENLY PURRING SWEETLY) Ohhhh. So it is.

FRANKIE: Now will you listen please, pretty Kitty?

KITTY: Well, do you think we have time, Susie?

SUSIE: If he'll talk fast. 

FRANKIE: Oh, I'm a fast talker. (RAPID, ALMOST INCOMPREHENSIBLE) It's this 
way, Kitty baby. Swindler Q. Fox, my manager, said I need a fancy robe to 
impress people to fight in the ring and he thinks you're the one to help me 
select it.

KITTY: Hold on, frog! That's too fast.

FRANKIE: Er, you said to talk fast.

SUSIE: We didn't mean for you to talk in shorthand, Frankie. 

FRANKIE: Yeah. Well, what I said was: my manager, the Fox, wants me to buy a 
fancy robe to wear into the ring and he said Kitty would be a good one to help 
me select it. 

KITTY: Rreow! Good! You can come along with Susie and me while we select our 
Easter outfits. 

SUSIE: Oh, I can hardly wait to pick out my Easter bonnet. 

KITTY: Nor can I. (CONTEMPLATIVE) An Easter bonnet that will bring out the 
white of my fur -- and the blue of my eyes. Rreow!

FRANKIE: Yeah, I can see ya now, Kitty.

MUSIC: IRVING BERLIN'S "EASTER PARADE" ... ORGAN ACCOMPANIES FRANKIE--

FRANKIE: (SINGS) In your Easter bonnet, with all the frills upon it-- 

KITTY: Rreow!

FRANKIE: (SINGS) You'll be the grandest kitty in the Easter parade.

KITTY: Rreow.

FRANKIE: (SINGS) 
On the avenue, 
Wormwood Avenue,
The photographers will snap you 
And you'll find that you're 
In the rotogravure.
Oh, I could write a sonnet about your Easter bonnet 
For you'll be the grandest kitty in the Easter parade.

MUSIC: ORGAN UP FOR THE SONG'S ENDING, WHICH DOUBLES AS A TRANSITION

SUSIE: Kitty, have you selected a bonnet yet?

KITTY: No, Sue. There's so many fetching styles that I just can't decide.

FRANKIE: I wish you two would hurry up and make up your minds. I've gotta pick 
out a robe.

KITTY: Quiet, frog! Oh, Sue, that's a demure little hat you're holding. 

SUSIE: Yes, I rather like this one. (CALLS) Oh, clerk? Yoo-hoo? Clerk?

CHUCK: Did you call me, madam? (SURPRISED, AFFECTIONATE) Oh, Susie Skunky, my 
sweetie!

SUSIE: (THE SAME) Dumbcluck, my woodchucky! Are <u>you</u> clerking?

CHUCK: (SADLY) Yes. Circumstances have forced me into selling hats here.

SUSIE: Then give me your opinion, Chucky. Do you think this bonnet is 
becoming? 

CHUCK: Do I?! Why, Susie-- (SINGS) In that Easter bonnet--

FRANKIE: Er, uh, uh, Woodchuck--? 

CHUCK: (SINGS) --with all the--

FRANKIE: Uh, Woodchuck? I've already sung that song.

CHUCK: Oh, mercy me. This is embarrassing.

SUSIE: Why, Chucky? 

CHUCK: I don't know any other song about Easter bonnets.

SUSIE: What about "Put On Your Easter Bonnet With All the Frills Upon It"? 

CHUCK: Why, yes, I <u>could</u> sing that one.

KITTY: (LOW) Rreow! Frankie?

FRANKIE: (LOW) Yeah, Kitty baby? 

KITTY: This would be a good time to select your robe. 

FRANKIE: I know exactly what you mean, Kittikins. 

SUSIE: Chucky, this bonnet is the right color for me, don't you think?

CHUCK: Indubitably, Sue. It does things for your ears.

SOUND: SCENE FADES OUT ... TRANSITIONAL PAUSE ... SCENE FADES IN 

KITTY: The bathrobe department's over this way, frog.

FRANKIE: I wish you'd call me Gorgeous.

KITTY: I refuse to call you Gorgeous even if it <u>is</u> your wrestling name! 

FRANKIE: I don't see what's wrong with callin' anyone gorgeous. 

KITTY: Rreow, nothing's wrong with it. You may call me gorgeous anytime you 
like, rreow. 

FRANKIE: Here are the bathrobes. 

KITTY: Where's the clerk? (CALLS) Hey, clerk, we want some service here! 

GERALD: Did someone call me?

(SIMULTANEOUSLY) 
KITTY: It's Gerald Grasshopper!
FRANKIE: Hey, Gerald Grasshopper!

GERALD: Hi. Interested in gentlemen's bathrobes? 

FRANKIE: Yep. I want one to use in my wrestlin' profession. 

GERALD: Oh, a wrestler, huh?

KITTY: Yes, grasshopper. Any suggestions for a wrestler's robe? 

GERALD: Well, most wrestlers wear a robe that fits their name. What's your 
professional name, Frankie?

FRANKIE: Gah, Gorgeous Frog.

GERALD: (THOUGHTFUL) Gorgeous Frog, huh? Well, that calls for a robe 
embroidered with cheap imitation jewels and rhinestones and, uh, gold braid. 

FRANKIE: It does?

KITTY: (UNKINDLY) Come to think of it, Frankie, that's <u>exactly</u> the kind of a 
robe <u>you</u> should have. 

FRANKIE: Well, if you say so, I'll buy it. Er, where is it? 

GERALD: Well, naturally, we don't sell robes like that.

FRANKIE: You don't? 

GERALD: Nope. Have to have it made up special.

KITTY: Can it be made here in this store, Gerald? 

GERALD: Sure it can. Take the elevator to the fifth floor. 

FRANKIE: (JOKING) Okay, I'll take the elevator to the fifth floor; I'm <u>strong</u> 
now that I'm a wrestler, grasshopper. 

GERALD: (UNAMUSED) Gorgeous Frog, you're as funny as a soft-boiled Easter egg. 
(SPITS)

SOUND: DING! BELL RINGS AS SPIT HITS THE SPITTOON

KITTY: (ANNOYED) And, grasshopper, you're as-- Oh, I won't say it; I'm a 
kitty. (GRANDLY, TO FRANKIE) Come, frog! To the elevator!

MUSIC: TRANSITION

SOUND: ELEVATOR BUZZER BUZZES A FEW TIMES

KITTY: Frankie, I can't understand it. We've been pushing the elevator button 
for ten minutes and still no elevator. 

FRANKIE: Guess we'll have to <u>walk</u> up to the fifth floor.

KITTY: Oh, wait, the light flashed on.

SOUND: ELEVATOR ARRIVES AND DOOR SLIDES OPEN

FRANKIE: Hey, an elevator! 

TIMOTHY: Going up!

KITTY: (SHE MIGHT HAVE KNOWN) Timothy Turtle!

FRANKIE: Oh, no wonder the service is so slow. 

TIMOTHY: (UP BIG) Hi, Frankie! (SHYLY) Hi, Kitty. 

KITTY: (IMPATIENT) Fifth floor, please, turtle.

TIMOTHY: Okay! Watch your step! 

SOUND: ELEVATOR DOOR SLIDES SHUT ... HUM OF RISING ELEVATOR IN BG

TIMOTHY: Second floor! Ladies' shower curtains, gentlemen's after-shave 
lotion! 

FRANKIE: Tim, why were you so long in answering the elevator call?

TIMOTHY: I went to sleep in the basement. (YAWNS, SLEEPILY) Always get sleepy 
ridin' up and down. (SUDDENLY UP) Third floor! Ladies blankets, children's 
coats, vests, and linoleum!

KITTY: (ANNOYED) We don't want the third floor. 

TIMOTHY: (POLITE) Oh, that's quite all right. (UP BIG) Fourth floor! Linens, 
curtains, furniture, and buttonholes! 

FRANKIE: We want off at the fifth floor. 

TIMOTHY: Nothin' on the fifth floor but the tailorin' department.

KITTY: That's where we want to go.

FRANKIE: I'm going to have my wrestlin' robe made there. 

TIMOTHY: You are?! Who ya gonna wrestle, Frankie?

FRANKIE: (CONFIDENTIALLY) Er, Tim, don't tell anybody, but I'm gonna wrestle 
the Easter Bunny. 

TIMOTHY: You are?! Hey, he's quite a character. Such big ears! 

FRANKIE: Hey, you don't say? Big, huh?

TIMOTHY: Yeah, I'll betcha. He could take his own ears and--

FRANKIE: Hey, turtle, how do you know? Have you seen the Easter Bunny? 

TIMOTHY: Sure. He's on the fifth floor right now.

FRANKIE: (NERVOUS) Kitty, let's go down. 

KITTY: Frog, stop trembling.

TIMOTHY: (UP BIG) Fifth floor! Tailorin' department!

SOUND: ELEVATOR STOPS ... DOOR SLIDES OPEN

KITTY: (IMPATIENT) Come on out of the elevator, Frankie.

FRANKIE: But, Kitty-- 

TIMOTHY: Going down! 

FRANKIE: Hey, hey, Tim, don't go down!

SOUND: ELEVATOR DOOR SLIDES SHUT

FRANKIE: (DISMAYED) Oh, me shuckin's. I'm stuck up here on the fifth floor.

KITTY: Oh, don't be so namby-pamby. You can meet the Easter Bunny and size him 
up. 

FRANKIE: But if he's big and strong, how will I ever win a wrestling match 
with him?

BUNNY: (APPROACHES, MUMBLING TO HIMSELF) Excuse me, do you have the time? 

FRANKIE: Sure, rabbit, it's almost lunchtime.

BUNNY: Great jumping jelly beans! I must get back to my eggs and finish 
painting them.

KITTY: Little rabbit, are you helping the Easter Bunny?

BUNNY: Helping him? Why, I <u>am</u> the Easter Bunny! Bye now. (DEPARTS, MUMBLING TO 
HIMSELF)

FRANKIE: Kitty, you mean to say that's the Easter Bunny? 

KITTY: Must be.

FRANKIE: Heh! And I was worried about wrestling-- Oh, that little shrimp.

KITTY: See, frog? Your worries are silly. He'll be a <u>pushover</u>. 

FRANKIE: You said it, Kit. Come on, let's see about my robe. (DISMISSIVE) 
Easter Bunny! Heh! What an opponent.

MUSIC: TRANSITION ... QUOTES "EASTER PARADE"

FRANKIE: Hey, Swindler Q. Fox, Dippy said you wanted to see me about something 
important.

FOX: Yes, frog. It's about your first wrestling match. 

FRANKIE: Oh, it'll be a cinch, Fox. That Easter Bunny's a fluffy little thing.

FOX: You're not going to fight the Easter Bunny.

FRANKIE: Oh, but he'd be a pushover. 

FOX: He's much too busy to wrestle anything but Easter eggs.

FRANKIE: Then I don't have a match?

FOX: What kind of manager do you think I am, Gorgeous?

FRANKIE: Oh, then you've arranged another fight for me? 

FOX: But of course. You're going to meet one of the finest wrestlers in the 
woods.

FRANKIE: Who is it?

FOX: None other than Big Boy Bear, the Bonecrusher. 

FRANKIE: Big Boy Bear?! Ohhh, no!

SOUND: THUMP-THUMP! AS FRANKIE FALLS TO THE FLOOR

FOX: He passed out. Too bad. 

PIG: Fox, did the frog faint?

FOX: Yes, Barbara Q. Pig.

PIG: Aren't you going to revive him?

FOX: There's no rush. The fight isn't until next week. And as long as he's 
unconscious he won't be worrying about meeting Big Boy. (CHUCKLES) And that, 
my dear, is the bare fact! (CHUCKLES) 

MUSIC: THEME ... IN AND IN BG

ANNOUNCER: Bare fact indeed! A wrestling match between a bear and a frog is 
something none of us should miss -- down in Wormwood Forest.

FRANKIE: (SINGS)
Hey, hey, that's all today. 
We're so glad that you could stay. 
There's always lots of fun 
Down in Wormwood Forest!

DIPPY: And next time, things should really be exciting. Till then, this is 
Dippy Dwarf saying, "So long!" 

FRANKIE: (SINGS)
Remember next Saturday,
Listen to our animal play.
There's always lots of fun 
Down in Wormwood Forest!
