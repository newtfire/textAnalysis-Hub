ANNOUNCER: 	Greetings from Hannibal, Missouri...the boy-hood home of Samuel 
		Langhorne Clemens....better known throughout the world as "Mark 
		Twain"...humorist and philosopher....Today's celebration is one 
		of the highlights of the year's activities here in Hannibal 
		commemorating the birth of Mark Twain....for...today....the new
		"MARK TWAIN ZEPHYR" train is to be christened. Any moment now... 
		we expect it to arrive...but in the mean time...let me tell you 
		something about this gala celebration....for it looks as though 
		the entire populace of 25,000 is here to see the fourth member of 
		the most illustrious train family in the world...as it arrives 
		for the christening. Yes...there are thousands lining the levee 
		and it seems thousands more in the large square in front of me... 
		some of the distinguished guests have just arrived...there is 



		It's a lovely Indian-summer day and the afternoon sun makes the
		whole spectacle takes on a carnival spirit....Hannibal is no 
		longer "the little white town....drowsing in the sunshine", as it 
		was in Mark Twain's day....to be sure...."Old Man River", the famous 
		Mississippi of song and story....still rolls along....Not far from 
		where I'm standing can be found the cave in which Tom and Becky were 
		lost and the gold was found...in the distance we can see Jackson 
		Island where Tom Sawyer, Huck Finn and all the rest went to become 
		pirates...to our left is the building where Sam Clemens learned the
		printer's trade....just up the street is his boyhood home which is 
		now a shrine to the memory of America's most beloved writer.... 
		But....here comes the MARK TWAIN ZEPHYR....just rounding the 

<u>TRAIN WHISTLES - ANSWERED BY STEAM BOAT WHISTLE</u> 

		bend....Yesterday and today catch sight of each other...for the 
		Zephyr's sharp whistle in salute to an old-timer..is acknowledged 
		by the deep toned greeting of a Mississippi River side-wheeler.... 
		"The Mark Twain Zephyr" is built in streamlined fashion with 
		bullet-shaped front and rear...and is finished in highly polished 
		stainless steel which shines like burnished silver in the afternoon 
		sun....Appropriately....the four cars of the train bear the names 
		of Mark Twain's best-known characters....there's Tom Sawyer..... 
		Huckleberry Finn....Becky Thatcher and the engine....Ingun Joe.... 
		perhaps you can hear the powerful Diesel motor as the train comes to 

<u>SOUND OF ENGINE                  </u>

		a stop just in front of us..... 

<u>CHEERING OF CROWDS....BAND OUT  </u> 

		The roustabouts from the levee have joined the throngs....listen.... 
		true to form....when they feel gay....they must sing....let's see 
		if we can pick up their song.... 

<u>NEGRO CHORUS MEDLEY.....UP...FADE FOR DESCRIPTION OF CARS</u> 

ANNOUNCER: 	We have placed microphones inside the cars of the train....so let's

ANNOUNCER:	The platform on which I'm standing faces the mighty engine compartment 
		Here is ..................................the engineer of "The Mark 
		Twain Zephyr"....oh....Mr...................do you mind telling us 
		something about the technical side of the "zephyr?" 

ENGINEER:	Well....the train is propelled by electric power generated by a 
		660-horsepower, 8-cylinder Diesel engine...designed especially for 
		this type of train....It burns ordinary fuel oil and has no spark 
		plugs or ignition system of the sort used in gasoline engines..... 
		combustion being accomplished wholly through high compression...It's 
		280 feet long and has seats for 92 passengers. With a full load of 
		fuel and water...it weighs 287,245 pounds..which is considerably less 
		than the weight of two ordinary coaches....Aside from the big 
		Diesel engine....the first car contains a Railway Post Office and 
		space for storage mail..The second car is given over to baggage 
		and express....and I think....you have described the last two cars. 
		The train is air-conditioned by a special system that supplies 
		filtered air under thermostatic control and all passenger compartments 
		are equipped with radio. 

ANNOUNCER:	Thanks Mr.................... you surely have given us a very good 
		idea of the "zephyr". 

		At this time...it's my pleasure to introduce one of the distinguished 
		guests of today's celebration...Governor.....Park of Missouri 
		Governor Park 

<u>ADDRESS OF GOVERNOR PARK OF MISSOURI    </u>

		Fellow Missourians....Distinguished guests and listeners everywhere... 
		It was my pleasure to participate in the unique ceremonies attendant 
		upon the opening of the Mark Twain Centennial...January 15th. 
		The celebration today is quite as inspiring...I am standing directly
		in front of a new shoveled nosed train built of stainless steel that 
		in the sun glistens like silver....A little later on it will be 
		christened "The Mark Twain" by the grand daughter of Missouri's most 
		illustrious son Samuel Langhorne Clemens...Mark Twain belonged to 
		an era in transportation, colorful and romantic in it's day and 
		his name is now identified with a new type of transportation that 
		gives promise of great achievement and process. The flight of one 
		of these stream line trains has been compared to the flash of a 
		comet in space. There is something recollective in that thought 
		because Mark Twain was born at the time Haley's comet was visable 
		to his family at his birthplace, Florida, Mo., and his physical 
		passing was timed to the reappearance of that celestial phenomenon 
		75 years later. Mark Twain's genius was likened to something 
		celestial....something unusual, so that it is therefore fitting 
		that his name should be associated with the new---the extraordinary 
		in land travel...Friends and visitors all are welcome to the domain 
		of Mark Twain. I now wish to introduce my good friend Governor 
		Herring of Iowa.

<u>ADDRESS BY GOVERNOR HERRING OF IOWA  </u> 

		I am very proud of this opportunity to pay my heart felt tribute 
		of affection and reverence to the memory of Mark Twain...In my 
		youth I reveled in the vacarious companionship of Tom Sawyer, 
		Huck Finn and Becky Thatcher..As I grew older I passed many an 
		enjoyable and unforgettable hour in the company of Colonel Sellers, 
		Puddin Head Wilson and Joan of Arc. I consider Mark Twain not only 
		America's greatest humorist but one of the greatest geniuses that 
		this nation has ever produced. I am very proud more over of the 
		fact that the State of Iowa of which I have the honor to be
		Governor shared honors with the State of Missouri in the shaping of 
		Mark Twain's character and literary development Iowa yields to 
		Missouri in the matter of Mark Twain's birth but claims a share of 
		the credit for having given Mark Twain to the world. 

ANNOUNCER:	I think the roustabouts from the levee feel a song coming on...yes... 
		sure enought.....there they go....let's see what they are singing 
		this time. 

<u>CHORUS... SINGING MEDLEY OF LEVEE MELODIES</u> 

ANNOUNCER:	During the past four weeks..many towns in the middle-west have 
		held competitions amoung their youngsters for the best character- 
		ization of the three outstanding personalities created by "Mark 
		Twain"....that is Tom Sawyer, Becky Thatcher and Huckleberry Finn... 
		Here come the final winners of that competition.... 
		(ad lib description) 

<u>BAND MUSIC.....UP AND OUT </u>

ANNOUNCER:	At this time....I have the pleasure of presenting Mr. Ralph Budd, 
		President of the Burling railroad. 
		Mr. Budd...... 

<u>ADDRESS BY RALPH BUDD   </u>

		"True to Zephyr traditions...this fourth of our fleet of stainless 
		steel Diesel-electric powered trains has been making history in 
		advance of its formal christening. With a distinguished company, 
		including Former Vice-President Dawes, Former Secretary of State 
		Kellogg, and many others well known to all Americans, we took this 
		new type to McCook, Nebraska for the first day of the Republican 
		Valley Jubilee on Wednesday. 

		With the original Zephyr operating daily in the Missouri River
		Country between Lincoln and Omaha and Kansas City since last 
		Armistice Day, and the Twin Zephyrs completing a round trip daily 
		between Chicago and St. Paul and Minneapolis, our choice for the 
		route of this fourth member of the new family became the Mark Twain 
		country...that historic area along the Mississippi between 
		St. Louis and Burlington, Iowa, through Hannibal. The name of this 
		train really suggested itself. 

		Quite happy we were to have it ready and actually scheduled to 
		run during this eventful Mark Twain Centennial....so signally 
		celebrated by your citizenry under the leadership of your Chamber 
		of Commerce and Centennial Association....the new train will 
		actually go into service this coming Sunday, quite appropriately 
		starting out of Hannibal for St Louis there on the following day 
		to inaugurate its daily round trip of 442 miles....The illustrious 
		Mark Twain....your enterprising City of Hannibal and the Burlington 
		Railroad are inseparably linked in the development of this area.... 
		The first railroad to cross the State of Missouri was the Hannibal 
		and St. Joe....now a component part of the Burlington System...And 
		the father of Mark Twain was among the pioneers that projected that 
		first railroad; in fact as an attorney of standing, he drew up the 
		preliminary papers for incorporation. So the name, "Mark Twain" 
		for this glistening Zephyr is a "natural" and further...what is 
		more appropriate than that his charming granddaughter...Miss Nina 
		Gabrilowitsch, inheriting on her father's side too, another famous 
		name, that of the world renowned conductor of the Detroit Symphony 
		Orchestra...should be here to do the christening.

		Miss Gabrilowitsch....the honor is yours..... 

MISS NINA:	I christen thr thee....."The Mark Twain Zephyr".

<u>CHORUS SINGING "STEAL AWAY".......FADE TO BG. FOR ANNOUNCER  </u>

ANNOUNCER:	And so...with the roustabouts from the levee of the Mississippi 
		singing one of Mark Twain's favorite melodies...we bring to a 
		close the ceremonies of the christening of the new "MARK TWAIN 
		ZEPHYR" train, from Hannibal, Missouri....the boyhood home of 
		America's renowned humorist Mark Twain. One hundred years have 
		passed since Mark Twain was born at Florida, Missouri, about 
		thirty miles from Hannibal....but the spirit of Mark Twain and 
		the immortal Tom, Huck and Becky, lives on.....
