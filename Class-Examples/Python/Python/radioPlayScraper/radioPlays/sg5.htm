<u>MUSIC: 		FULL INTO PLAY THEME...AND DOWN, TO HOLD UNDER:</u> 

O'SULLIVAN:	The bachelor and the bobby-soxer - they're only 

		<u>part</u> of our story. The rest of it happens to be -- 

		a <u>judge</u>....Yes, the Judge is a most important character, 

		so you'd better have a look at her....That's right - 

		<u>her</u> - with a curved capital "H". Judge Margaret Turner 

		is her name - (<u>DISHES, UNDER</u>) - and she's having 

		breakfast with her sister, Susan. 

		(<u>MUSIC CUTS</u>)

SUSAN: 		Sorry I'm late, Sis, pass the cream please.
 
MARGARET: 	Here you are, dear...Did you sleep well?

SUSAN: 		Oh, sklonklish....I feel absolutely sklonklish.

MARGARET: 	Susan, darling, don't be a clunk. 

SUSAN: 		A clu -- ! (ACCUSING) Sis, you've been listening 

		when I talk on the phone! 

MARGARET: 	(LAUGHS) I've had to. I plead self-defense. 

SUSAN: 		(EAGER) Margaret, speaking of pleas - You know that 

		case you were trying - the old man who ran away with 

		the sixteen-year-old girl? 

MARGARET: 	Yes? 

SUSAN: 		What did you give him? 

MARGARET: 	Three years. 

SUSAN: 		Oh...That'll cost me three dollars. 

MARGARET: 	Why? 

SUSAN: 		I always bet that you won't sentence people. 

MARGARET: 	(PLEASED) That's ridiculous...(GINGERLY) Uh - 

		how have you been doing lately? 

SUSAN: 		You've cost me a fortune. 

[2]

MARGARET: 	(MORE TARTLY) Well, perhaps you'd betterr spend more time 

		on Geometry. Mr. Roberts says you're the first student 

		he's ever had who defined a triangle as two women crazy 

		about one man.
 
SUSAN: 		(HAUGHTILY) Mr. Roberts is definitely decadent.
 
MARGARET: 	Susan, what am I going to do with you? 

SUSAN: 		(PENITENT) Why? Am I so much trouble, Margaret? 

MARGARET: 	(QUICKLY) No - of course you aren't, darling.. Susan, 

		you know I'd die for you. It's just living with you 

		that's a little difficult. 

<u>MUSIC: 		(ACCENT CHORD...AND CONTINUE UNDER:)</u>
 
O'SULLIVAN:	Now then, where does the bachelor come in? Well - 

		first of all he comes into court - <u>Judge</u> <u>Turner's</u> court 

		-- and he comes in <u>late</u>. (<u>MUSIC CUTS</u>)
 
MARGARET: 	Mr. Nugent, I don't know whether <u>you</u> work on schedule, 

		but this court does. Nine o'clock means nine o' clock. 

DICK: 		Yes, sir -- I mean, Yes - Your Honor.

MARGARET: 	Now let's get on with this....The charge is disturbing 

		the peace. How do you plead? 

WALTERS: 	Your Honor, my name is Walters. I represent the 

		defendant. He pleads not guilty. 

DICK: 		I do?....I mean, yes - yes, of course I do! Not Guilty!
 
MARGARET: 	Mr. Nugent, did you go to the Vampire Club last night? 

DICK:		Yes, Your Honor. I - I'm doing a series of paintings on 

		Americana, and I'm including a night club scene.

[3]

MARGARET: 	<u>Creating</u> a night club scene would be more accurate

		...However, there seems to be some doubt as to how the 

		fight actually started. 

DICK:		Well, you see, Agnes Prescott -- she sings at the 

		club. And she'd just finished her spot and we were 

		having a drink when Florence came over to say hello. 

		And then Tony - he's Flo's boy-friend - objected. And 

		Florence objected to his objection. And then one thing 

		led to another. Tony slapped Florence - I slapped 

		Tony - Florence scratched Agnes - Agnes bit Florence 

		and -- Look anyone who says he remembers a fight blow 

		for blow is lying!

[4]

MARGARET: 	Yes, I'd be willing to concede that possibility...

		(SLIGHT PAUSE) On the basis of the evidence submitted 

		here, it was obviously a fight in which everyone 

		participated. Everyone is equally guilty, and everyone 

		is equally innocent. I see no reason to hold the 

		defendant for trial. (<u>CROWD REACTION</u>) 

DICK: 		Thank you, Your Honor. May I go now? 

MARGARET: 	You just got here. Don't you like our court? 

DICK: 		Oh, sure, I like it fine. Only I'm due to give a lecture 

		today. 

MARGARET: 	Really? What are you lecturing on? 

DICK: 		America, as I see it. 

MARGARET: 	(DRILY) That should be very interesting. 

DICK: 		Yes, it is. You see -- (GETS HER MEANING, DEFLATES) 

		Yes...... 

MARGARET: 	Mr. Nugent, I respect your artistic temperment, but let 

		me give you a warning. If you are brought before this 

		court again, you won't be dealt with so leniently. I 

		suggest that you confine your future painting to still 

		life. (<u>RAPPING GAVEL</u>) Case dismissed. (<u>MURMUR OF CROWD</u> 

		<u>VOICES</u>)
 
DICK:		(SOTTO) You know, Walters, a judge like that makes it 

		almost a pleasure to come to court. Little on the icy 

		side, but I'd like to have a try at melting her down. 

WALTERS: 	(SOTTO) Don't press your luck....And anyway you're due at 

		the high-school for that lecture. Come on! 

<u>ORCH: 		(ACCENT CHORD AND FADE OUT INTO:)</u>

[5]

DICK: 		The essence of art is simplicity - honesty. For instance, 

		if I wanted to capture the feeling of America, I'd try 

		to put it into the portrait of one of you high-school 

		students... You'd be in your denims, with the cuffs 

		rolled up. Maybe a sweatshirt, with your sweetheart's 

		initials on it. (FADING TO B.G.) You'd be young and 

		eager and proud. Because of what's ahead of you....... 

    (ALL SOTTO)				You're the kids who, in a 
SUSAN: Jerry...<u>Jerry</u>....		few years, are going to be
					running our factories,
JERRY: Huh?				our farms, our industries!

SUSAN: Do me a favor. Pinch me,
       will you?
					You're going to be voting, 
JERRY: Pinch you? Gee, Susan, 		to make this country what 
that's a funny thing to ask. 		you want it to be - a 
Can't I slap you or			place where there is
something?				freedom, opportunity and
					tolerance! If I were to
SUSAN: Don't be silly! I just		do a portrait of one of
want to be sure I'm awake!		you, I'd try to put all
					that into it. I'd try to
JERRY: Well - okay..(PAUSE) Well?

SUSAN: Jerry, it's true! I wasn't
dreaming  it! 

JERRY: Dreaming what?
					make the whole thing add 
SUSAN: Mr. Nugent, up there! <u>He's</u>	up to a portrait of our 
<u>all in shining armor!</u>			country - the greatest
					country in this or any 
 
DICK: 		other world! (SMILING) So don't be surprised if I ask 

		one of you to pose for me..Thank you. 

<u>SOUND: 		(APPLAUSE..FULL...AND DOWN, AD LIBS TO HOLD UNDER:)</u>
 
JERRY: 		Hey, Susan, what was that stufff about shining armor? 

		That's a sport-coat he's wearing. I'll bet he got it 

		down at - (SUDDENLY) Hey! - Susan! Where you going? 

[6]

SUSAN: 		I've got to catch him before he gets away! See you later, 

		Jerry! 

<u>SOUND: 		(RUNNING STEPS)</u> 

SUSAN: 		Oh, Mr. Nugent - wait!

DICK: 		(SLIGHTLY OFF) Huh? (<u>STEPS CUT</u>) 

SUSAN: 		Mr. Nugent, my name is Susan Turner. I'm a student here. 

DICK: 		(POLITE SURPRISE) No! 

SUSAN: 		Yes. I loved your speech. 

DICK: 		Well, thanks. 

1ST GIRL: 	(SLIGHTLY OFF) Goodbye, Mr. Nugent!

2ND GIRL: 	(SLIGHTLY OFF...WOLF WHISTLE) 

SUSAN: 		You mustn't mind them, Mr. Nugent. They don't really 

		mean it. 

DICK: 		Why not?...Well, nice to have met you, Miss Turner. I've 

		got to hurry now. Sometime perhaps --

SUSAN: 		Oh, you can't go yet - I've got to interview you! 

DICK: 		You <u>what</u>? 

SUSAN: 		For the high school paper. I'm the editor. 

DICK: 		Oh....

[7]

SUSAN: 		(BRIGHTLY) I'll ask you questions. All you have to do is 

		answer them. 

DICK: 		Fire away. 

SUSAN: 		Well - uh - first....have you ever been married? 

DICK: 		(PUZZLED BUT GAME) No. 

SUSAN: 		I knew you weren't! You just couldn't be! 

DICK: 		Oh, I've had offers.

SUSAN: 		(INTENSE) Tell me - have you ever been in love? 

DICK: 		Yes, I have...(CURIOUS) Say, what kind of paper does this 

		school run? 

SUSAN: 		(REASSURING) Oh, all the students read it. 

DICK: 		I'll bet they do!

SUSAN: 		(ADORING) Mr. Nugent - did you have any ordeals before you 

		became a success? 

DICK: 		Well - no, I --

SUSAN: 		You can talk to me. I'm really much older than I look. 

DICK: 		I'm beginning to think you're older than <u>I</u> look. 

SUSAN: 		(INTIMATE) You see, I want you to think of me - not as 

		a newspaperwoman, but as a friend. 

DICK: 		(CONFIDING) Well, in that case, I'll tell you...I did 

		suffer.

SUSAN: 		(TENDERLY) You did? 

[8]

DICK: 		When I was ten, my mother and father had a double suicide 

		pact. They made it. I was sent to an orphanage. Some days 

		they <u>didn't</u> beat me. 

SUSAN: 		(HORRIFIED) Ohhhh!....
 
DICK: 		Then one night I escaped. I ran away to New York. I used 

		to steal.

SUSAN: 		(BREATHLESS) What? 

DICK: 		(STUCK) What do you mean - what? 

SUSAN: 		What did you steal? 

DICK: 		(SADLY) Crusts of bread...and <u>things</u>. 

SUSAN: 		(SYMPATHETIC, SOFTLY) I can imagine.. 

DICK: 		One time I stole a valise. There were paints and paint 

		brushes inside, so I began to paint. The rest is history. 

SUSAN: 		(ENCHANTED) How wonderful. How terribly wonderful.

DICK: 		Now, if you'll excuse me -- Goodbye, Louella. 

SUSAN: 		Oh, no, it's Susan - Susan Turner. And by the way, Mr. 

		Nugent, about painting one of us - you know - denims and 

		sweatshirts and everything?
 
DICK: 		Yes? 

SUSAN: 		Well, do you think I'd make a good model, perhaps? 

DICK: 		(MOCK ASTONISHMENT) Oh, you're not thinking of quitting 

		the newspaper game? 

[9]

SUSAN: 		Oh, that's merely a stop-gap. (SIGHS) My family wants me 

		to go into law, but I think <u>one</u> female judge in the family 

		is enough. 

DICK: 		Yes, I should think that --- (A TAKE) Did you say your name 

		was <u>Turner</u>? 

SUSAN: 		That's right. My sister is Judge Margaret Turner. 

DICK: 		Nice to have met the family - 'Bye. 

SUSAN: 		Wait - what about my posing for you? What about young 

		America? 

DICK: 		(TO GET AWAY) Fine. 

SUSAN: 		Then you think I'm ideal? 

DICK: 		Sure. Ideal - perfect - (FADING) - anything you say. 

		'Bye! (<u>DOOR SLAMS, OFF</u>) 

SUSAN: 		(TO SELF, THOUGHTFUL) That's funny...his armor doesn't even 

		jingle when he <u>runs</u>......
 
<u>MUSIC: 		(ACCENT CHORD...AND FADE OUT INTO:)</u>

MARGARET: 	(TOLERANT, AMUSED) Susan, that's ridiculous. Men don't go 

		around in armor any more. 

SUSAN: 		Well, <u>he</u> does, Margaret. And I ought to know - I 

		interviewed him. 

MARGARET: 	I suppose he told you everything? Got it all off his - tin 

		chest? 

SUSAN: 		Oh, yes. He's had to lie and cheat and steal all his life. 

		(DREAMILY) He's wonderful. 

MARGARET: 	(DRILY) I can imagine. 

SUSAN: 		And besides - he's asked me to pose for him. 

MARGARET: 	Really? What's the name of this shining knight? 

SUSAN: 		(DREAMILY) Richard Nugent.

[10]

MARGARET: 	(THOUGHTFUL) Richard Nugent....<u>Richard</u> <u>Nugent</u>?!!! 

SUSAN: 		(EAGERLY) Have you ever heard of him? 

MARGARET: 	Susan, this is idiotic! Last month you wanted to be a 

		dress designer. Then a naturalist gave a lecture and 

		you thought you'd be the first female deep-sea diver. 

		Last week you wanted to be a psychiatrist. And now -- 

SUSAN: 		Why shouldn't I pose for him? He's very nice! 

		What do you know about him? 

MARGARET: 	Enough to advise you to go back to deep-sea diving! 

SUSAN: 		I don't need your advice!

MARGARET: 	Possibly not - but I'm your sister and your guardian. 

		I'm acting in your own best interests. 

SUSAN: 		(TEARFUL) You're going to make me an old maid!

MARGARET: 	Only until you're eighteen....Now, Susan, I'm going 

		to a concert with Tommy Chamberlain. You'll go up 

		to your room, spend some time on your studies, get 

		to bed early and get a good night's sleep...Is that 

		clear? 

SUSAN: 		Why don't you write out a court order? 

MARGARET: 	(WEARILY) Susan - please...Go on up, dear. 

		Tommy will be here any minute. 

<u>MUSIC: 		(ACCENT CHORD...AND FADE OUT INTO:)</u>

TOMMY: 		What do you mean, you can't go to the concert? 

		We made this date last --

MARGARET: 	(AGITATED) Tommy, it's Susan - she's disappeared!

TOMMY: 		(BLANKLY) Disappeared? 

[11]

MARGARET: 	I went up to her room to say goodbye. She wasn't there..

		..The window was open--- she must have climbed down the 

		back porch. (NEAR TEARS) Tommy, if she - if she --

TOMMY: 		Steady. I'm an assistant D.A. remember. I'll have 

		every cop in town on the lookout for her. (<u>LIFTS PHONE, </u>

		<u>JIGGLES HOOK</u>) Hello...Hello, Operator - get me Police 

		Headquarters.

MARGARET: 	If anything's happened to Susan, I'll never forgive 

		myself! I shouldn't have quarrelled with her! 

TOMMY: 		What did you quarrel about? 

MARGARET: 	It was nothing. I told her she couldn't pose for 

		Richard Nugent, and she said she didn't need my ad -- 

		(IT HITS) Nugent! That's it!
 
TOMMY: 		(BLANKLY) That's what? 

MARGARET: 	(GRIM) Tommy, if Susan's where I think she is, a certain 

		artist is going to spend the night in jail!

<u>MUSIC: 		(SHARP CHORD...AND FADE OUT INTO:)</u>

<u>SOUND: 		(CELL DOOR CLANKS OPEN..OFF MIKE)</u>

COP: 		(OFF) In here, Doc. Go right in.

BEEMISH: 	Thank you, Officer...(<u>CELL DOOR CLOSES OFF</u>) 

		(COMING ON) Mr. Nugent? 

DICK: 		Huh? 

BEEMISH: 	I'm Dr. Beemish. I'm the Court Psychiatrist. 

DICK: 		Come back in an hour. I'll be crazy by then. 

BEEMISH: 	(LAUGHS) No, I'm really here to help you. I've been 

		looking over the reports on your case and I'd like you 

		to tell me your side of it. 

[12]

DICK: 		What is there to tell? ... I got home, to my apartment 

		last night, went into my room, took off my dinner 

		jacket, put on a robe, came out, fixed a drink - and 

		boom, there's the little girl!....The little girl pops 

		up, there's a banging at the door, somebody busts in, 

		everybody starts talking at once -- 

BEEMISH: 	(TRYING TO INTERRUPT) Did the girl -- 

DICK: 		(RIGHT ON) Don't listen to an explanation. They're 

		all mad. 

BEEMISH: 	How did the girl get into your place? 

DICK: 		<u>Talked</u> her way in. Told the elevator boy I was 

		expecting her. 

BEEMISH: 	Well, didn't she explain? 

DICK: 		They wouldn't let her. She kept trying to say she'd 

		come to be a model or something - that I'd told her I 

		was going to paint her as Young America. 

BEEMISH: 	Did you tell her that? 

DICK: 		Oh, I told that to five hundred little girls. 

BEEMISH: 	Well, let's not go into that!....You're charged with 

		hitting the District Attorney. Did you or did you 

		not?

[13]

DICK: 		Sure, I hit him. That's right. But at the time I hit 

		him I did not know that he was the Assistant District 

		Attorney. If I had known he was the Assistant District 

		Attorney, I would have hit him...He kept pulling at my 

		arm - wouldn't let the little girl explain... And that 

		sister of hers. That's a mountain of ice - a gallon of 

		poison jumping to conclusions! 

BEEMISH: 	(LAUGHING) Seems to me the only thing you're suffering 

		from is a severe case of being an innocent bystander.
 
DICK: 		You really mean that?!!!...

BEEMISH: 	Certainly. You don't look at all like the violent type. 

DICK: 		I'm not! I'm the most amiable fellow in the world, but 

		--- Look, what can they do to me if I kill a judge? 
 
BEEMISH: 	(CHUCKLING) Yes, I understand how you feel. Judge 

		Turner appears to be a very dominant woman..Actually, 

		of course, that's a retreat - a manifestation of the 

		Oedipus complex. 

DICK: 		(DRYLY) Is that so? 

BEEMISH: 	As Menninger points out, traumatic events -- 

DICK: 		The only traumatic event she needs is a good kick in 

		the bustle! 

BEEMISH: 	(SMILING) She's my niece -- 

DICK: 		Huh? 

BEEMISH: 	-- but you're absolutely right...Mr. Nugent, I have a 

		little plan in mind. Just leave everything to me. 

		I dare say you're going to be surprised. 

<u>MUSIC: 		(ACCENT CHORD..AND FADE OUT INTO:)</u>

BEEMISH: 	Your Honor, I'm sure Mr. Nugent appreciates your holding 

		this hearing in your chambers. It spares him a good 

		deal of psychic abuse.

[14]

MARGARET: 	(FRIENDLY) That's quite all right, Dr. Beemish. 

		We have no desire to humiliate him. 

DICK: 		(STARING) Huh? 

MARGARET: 	(SMILING) Mr. Nugent, I have good news for you. 

DICK: 		I know. You're going to hang me. 

MARGARET: 	No, I'm afraid I'm the one who ought to be hanged. 

DICK: 		(DAZED) I - I --- Won't I sit down?
 
MARGARET: 	Please do....Really, I think this little incident can be 

		straightened out quite amicably. In fact, the Assistant 

		District Attorney assures me he has no great desire to 

		press the charges against you, Mr. Nugent. 

DICK: 		You mean you're letting me go? Well, thank you, Your 

		Honor. Thank you very much, I-- 

BEEMISH: 	Just a moment, Nugent. I believe Judge Turner has a 

		suggestion. 

DICK: 		(AMIABLE) Why certainly - anything. 

MARGARET: 	It isn't really very much. You see, I'm a little worried 

		about Susan.

DICK: 		(SHE SHOULD BE!) Oh, yes...

MARGARET: 	She's become quite enamoured of you, Mr. Nugent... 

DICK: 		(MODESTLY) Well....

MARGARET: 	And we were wondering if you'd help us by taking her 

		out.

DICK: 		Any little thing I can --- (A TAKE) Doing <u>what</u>?!! 

MARGARET: 	Being her beau - just until she gets over you. 

		It's really Dr. Beemish's idea. 

[15]

DICK: 		(BRIDLING) Oh, it is, is it?

MARGARET: 	If she thinks you're being martyred, 

		Susan will never get over it. That's what Dr. Beemish says.

DICK: 		Then let Dr. Beemish take her out!....(INDIGNANT) 

		I'm not a judge but I'll bet there's no law that says 

		I have to go out with children!

BEEMISH: 	Now, now - no one is trying to force you, Mr. Nugent. 

		We were just hoping you'd want to co-operate. 

DICK: 		Why should I? 

BEEMISH: 	Because your attitude will have a decided bearing on 

		the disposition of the charges against you -- and 

		whether the Assistant District Attorney chooses to 

		press them.

[16]

DICK: 		Press what? All I did was punch him in the nose!

MARGARET: 	Mr. Nugent, suppose <u>you</u> were on the jury...a man entices 

		a seventeen-year-old to his apartment, on the pretext 

		of painting her picture. And when her family protests 

		he brutally assaults the Assistant District Attorney...

		Mr. Nugent, what would <u>you</u> do to this man? 

DICK: 		I'd give him twenty years! I'd-- (BIG TAKE) Holy 

		Toledo, what am I saying!!!

MARGARET: 	Just what the jury would say, I believe. 

DICK: 		(SUNK) Okay..What do I have to do? 

MARGARET: 	See Susan as often as we deem proper. When her fatal 

		fascination wears off, you'll be free. 

DICK: 		(WORRIED) What if it doesn't wear off? 

MARGARET: 	(SCORNFUL) It will. 

DICK: 		(HURT) I don't like the way you said that. 

MARGARET: 	Mr. Nugent, please don't misunderstand. I'm only doing 

		this under pressure from Dr. Beemish. 

DICK: 		Is that so? 

MARGARET: 	Yes. Frankly I'd as soon see my sister going out with 

		an <u>actor</u>.

ROY: 		In just a moment Myrna Loy, Shirley Temple, Cary Grant 

		and Willard Waterman will return to the Camel Screen Guild 

		microphone in Act II of "The Bachelor and the Bobby Soxer".... 

		They say there are no new plots...no new situations...in the 

		world. Well, maybe that's true. But you can take two plays 

		with the same plot...and one can be so dull you'll go to 

		sleep, while the other will have you sitting on the edge of 

		your chair until the final curtain. It's all in the skill 

		with which that plot is developed. Rather like cigarettes, 

		you know. They look pretty much alike...they are all made 

		from tobacco...but from there on...! Well, you take a Camel, 

		for instance. Why, the way those choice tobaccos are selected 

		and a-g-e-d....the way they're blended with that famous Camel 

		know-how...these things bring you that rich, full flavor and, 

		cool, cool mildness that make Camels the favorite of millions 

		and millions of smokers. Smoker after smoker has discovered 

		just how good Camels are, you know, by trying and comparing 

		the different brands in their "T-Zones"...T for Taste and T 

		for Throat. That's how they learned the differences between 

		brands....how they learned that Camels suit them best!

CHANDLER: 	More people are smoking Camels than ever before. 

ROY: 		Experience is the best teacher. Try a Camel yourself. 

		And remember...Camels by the carton are the best buy. 

		Keeps you from running out, and saves you money!

<u>MUSIC: 		(PLAY THEME)</u>

ROY: 		Camel Cigarettes now present Act II of "The Bachelor and the 

		Bobby Soxer" starring Cary Grant, Myrna Loy and Shirley 

		Temple, with Willard Waterman.

<u>MUSIC: 		(FULL INTO PLAY THEME..AND DOWN TO HOLD UNDER:)</u>

O'SULLIVAN: 	It's either Susan or jail for Richard Nugent - and he's 

		beginning to think he's made the wrong choice. Playing 

		boy-friend to a bobby-soxer takes a lot of endurance, and 

		Dick isn't exactly in top condition. This evening, for 

		example, he's had to take her to a high school basketball 

		game. And after being exposed to the rooting section, he's 

		desperately seeking <u>any</u> way out. (<u>MUSIC CUTS</u>) 

DICK: 		(TENTATIVE) Uh...pretty nice game, wasn't it, Susan? 

SUSAN: 		Oh, we should have won by a much bigger score. Jerry 

		White didn't play <u>half</u> his game tonight. 

DICK: 		Jerry White? Oh, yes - the center....Uh - seemed to me 

		he kept looking up at you.

SUSAN: 		Well he used to be sort of a boy-friend of mine. 

		(ADDS QUICKLY) When I was younger, of course.

DICK: 		Of course....You know, I feel pretty sorry for him.
 
SUSAN: 		For Jerry? Why? 

DICK: 		Well, I think he's off his game because of you. 

SUSAN: 		You really think so? 

DICK: 		I know so. I could tell by the way he kept looking at us... 

		It's awful what a woman can do to a man. Well - look at 

		history....Caesar and Cleopatra...Heloise and Abelard....
 
SUSAN: 		(HELPING) Napoleon and Josephine....
 
DICK: 		All of them. Behind every defeated man there's a 

		frustrated love.
 
SUSAN: 		You're right. 

DICK: 		You bet I'm right.
 
SUSAN: 		And I promise, all my life, I'll never hurt you, darling. 

DICK: 		(UNCOMFORTABLE) Look, Susan....

[18]
 
SUSAN: 		Yes, dear? 

DICK: 		This - this dear and darling. You shouldn't call me that. 

		I don't think it's right. 

SUSAN: 		Why, darling?  

DICK: 		Ah, now cut that out!...Susan, you've got to get me out of 

		this! After all, you got me into it! You came to my 

		apartment - you told your sister I'd asked you to pose 

		for me --

SUSAN: 		Well, that's true....in a way.
 
DICK: 		And now everyone has the crazy idea that you're in love 

		with me. 

SUSAN: 		I am.

DICK: 		Susan! Look at me! I - I wouldn't say this to many 

		people, but I'm old enough to be your father. 

SUSAN: 		(LOVINGLY) You're so right, dear.

DICK: 		Susan, you've got to realize that this - this isn't proper 

		for either of us. 

SUSAN: 		You're so right, dear.

DICK: 		Believe me, it will only embarrass us both!

SUSAN: 		You're so right, dear.

DICK: 		Susan, you're in a rut! You're not even paying attention! 

SUSAN: 		You're so right, dear.

DICK: 		(GROANING) What's the use! I give up!

<u>MUSIC: 		(ACCENT CHORD...AND CONTINUE UNDER:)</u>

O'SULLIVAN:	But now what about the bobby-soxer's sister? Well, 

		Margaret is keeping her eye on the bachelor. 

		And Tommy Chamberlain, the Assistant D.A., is keeping his 

		eye on Margaret. And Dr. Beemish is keeping his eye on 

		them all...Until Saturday......(CONTINUED)

[19]

O'SULLIVAN:	(CONT'D) It's the day of the big church picnic, and 

		our bachelor - at the end off his rope - makes a last 

		desperate strike for freedom. He rolls up his trouser 

		cuffs, bashes in his hat, pulls out his shirt-tail, and 

		comes barging into the house. (<u>MUSIC CUTS</u>) 

DICK: 		Hi, mellow greetings, yoookie-dookie! 

SUSAN: 		(DELIGHTED) Dickie! 

DICK: 		Ready, voot, let's scoot. 

SUSAN: 		Reet!

DICK: 		Reet! Hey, you remind me of a man. 

SUSAN: 		What man? 

DICK: 		The man with the power. 

SUSAN: 		What power? 

DICK: 		The power of hoodoo. 

SUSAN: 		Who do? 

DICK: 		You do. 

SUSAN: 		Do what? 

DICK: 		Remind me of a man. 

SUSAN: 		What man? 

DICK: 		The man with the --
 
MARGARET: 	(COLDLY, INTERRUPTING) If I may interrupt this gibberish... 

DICK: 		Well! Her Honor, the Judge! Greetings. Greetings. 

MARGARET: 	(ANGRILY) Are you out of your mind? What are you 

		trying to do? 

DICK: 		I don't dig you, chick.

MARGARET: 	And will you <u>please</u> speak Engish!

[20]

BEEMISH: 	Why, Margaret, he just means he doesn't understand.

DICK: 		Ah, that Dr. Beemish is sharp! (BEEMISH LAUGHS) 

		Hi, Uncle Matt! How's the light operator? 

BEEMISH: 	(SMILING) Not bad, for a psychiatrist. 

DICK: 		Hey, you remind me of a man. 

BEEMISH: 	What man? 

DICK: 		The man with the power. 

BEEMISH: 	What power? 

DICK: 		The power of hoodoo. 

BEEMISH: 	Who do? 

DICK: 		You do. 

BEEMISH: 	Do what? 

DICK: 		Remind me of a man. 

BEEMISH: 	What --

MARGARET: 	(SHARPLY) Uncle Matt! 

BEEMISH: 	Uh - yes - yes, my dear - let's go to the picnic. 

[20-A]

DICK: 		That's right - come on, Susan! My hot rod's waiting out 

		there at the curb!

SUSAN: 		<u>That</u>?!! Dick, that isn't your car! That's Jerry's! 

DICK: 		(GAILY) It's mine for today. I swapped him even. 

SUSAN: 		You swapped your big, shiny convertible for <u>that</u>? 

DICK: 		(GRINNING) Uh-huh. 

MARGARET: 	Mr. Nugent, may I ask why you did a childish thing like 

		that? 

DICK: 		Childish?! That's all <u>you</u> know! If you'd seen the look 

		on Jerry's face, <u>you'd</u> have thought it was worth it, too! 

		(FADING, DISGUSTED) Come on, Susan -- let's get out of 

		here! (<u>DOOR CLOSES...OFF MIKE</u>)

BEEMISH: 	Nice of him, Margaret, don't you think?...Margaret?..

MARGARET: 	(AS IN A DREAM) Uncle Matt...pinch me, will you? 

BEEMISH: 	At my age? 

MARGARET: 	I just want to be sure I'm not dreaming, that's all. 

BEEMISH: 	Dreaming? About what? 

MARGARET: 	About Dick - Mr. Nugent. I could have sworn he was 

		dressed in shining armour! 

<u>MUSIC: 		(ACCENT CHORD.....AND FADE OUT INTO:)</u>
 
<u>SOUND: 		(MOVING CAR....TO HOLD UNDER FAINTLY)</u> 

JERRY: 		Gee, Susan, I just don't get it....You go to the picnic 

		with Mr. Nugent - and now you ask <u>me</u> to take you home. 

		(SUDDEN SUSPICION) Say, it wouldn't be because I'm 

		driving his car? 

SUSAN: 		Of course not, Jerry...(SLIGHT PAUSE) Though I do like 

		convertibles......besides, I wanted chance to thank you 

		for everything.   

[21 & 22]

JERRY: 		Well, you said it meant so much to you. 

SUSAN: 		It really did....Poor Mr. Nugent - trying so hard, and 

		not even able to win <u>one</u> race. I had to thank you for 

		letting him win that last one - the obstacle race. 

JERRY: 		(MODESTLY) Well the other fellows were in it, too. 

		They all kinda hung back. 

SUSAN: 		I know....I'll pay them on Saturday. How much did they 

		say? 

JERRY: 		Seventy-five cents apiece. Anyone but you, they 

		would've charged a buck. 

SUSAN: 		I'll pay them when I get my allowance. I'll pay you 

		too, Jerry. 

JERRY: 		I don't want any of your money, Susan. (DRAMATIC) 

		Some things just can't be bought. 

SUSAN: 		(SOFTLY) Thank you, Jerry...You know, sometimes 

		you're really very nice. 

JERRY: 		(SHRUGS) Aw, it wasn't much. You've <u>gotta</u> help an 

		old guy like that. 

SUSAN: 		<u>Old</u>? 

JERRY: 		Well, gee, he must be over <u>thirty</u>.

SUSAN: 		(SLOWLY) Yes...I guess he is....Funny, I never thought 

		much about that. 

JERRY: 		About what? 

SUSAN: 		Well - when I'm ninety he'll be a hundred and eight. 

JERRY: 		(WHISTLES SOBERLY....THEN) Yeah, but I've got to give this 

		car back to him tonight. You gonna be willing to ride in 

		my old hot rod? 

SUSAN: 		Sure, Jerry. Who wants a big new car like this? You can't even 

		make it backfire! 

<u>MUSIC: 		(ACCENT CHORD....AND FADE OUT INTO:)</u>

[23]

BEEMISH: 	Why don't you try to sit down, Margaret? Pacing 

		like that won't help you any. 

MARGARET: 	(AGITATED) Uncle Matt, if I could just <u>understand</u> 

		it....(GRABBING AT STRAWS) Of course, it <u>could</u> have 

		been an optical illusion - or the power of suggestion, 

		through Susan - or a combination of the heat, and too 

		much lunch, and all the excitement. Or -- 

BEEMISH: 	(QUICKLY) Or possibly a wish-fulfilment - result of 

		a repressed interest in Nugent. 

MARGARET: 	<u>What</u>? That's idiotic. 

BEEMISH: 	I suppose....Look, Margaret, I'm going to make a 

		confession. When I talked you into this thing with 

		Richard, it wasn't for Susan's sake - it was for yours. 

MARGARET: 	<u>Mine</u>? 

BEEMISH: 	I thought you were <u>too</u> indignant about him - a 

		psychiatrist gets to sense those things. I thought 

		perhaps - without your even realizing it - you might 

		be more attracted than you knew. 

MARGARET: 	That is completely and absolutely absurd!

BEEMISH: 	Perhaps....Still, there's this illusion about a knight 

		in shining armour. 

MARGARET: 	I - I'm just tired, that's all. I've been working 

		too hard. I - I - 

BEEMISH: 	(SUDDENLY) You know, maybe you need a little vacation. 

MARGARET: 	Vacation? 

BEEMISH: 	Sure - a vacation - get away from it all. You could 

		spend a week in California - fly both ways - it's 

		just overnight. Why shouldn't you? 

[24]

MARGARET: 	(UNCERTAIN) I don't know <u>why</u> I shouldn't....or why 

		I <u>should</u>....or <u>anything</u>.... 

BEEMISH: 	That's just what I mean...Look, I know a chap at 

		T.W.A. I'm sure I can get you a 

		reservation. You just start packing. (CHUCKLES) 

		It's all in the bag. 

<u>MUSIC: 		(ACCENT CHORD.....AND FADE OUT INTO:)</u> 

BEEMISH: 	You see, Richard, the reason I dropped in --

DICK: 		Since when do you need a reason, Uncle Matt? After 

		the way you've messed up my life?
 
BEEMISH: 	Oh, it wouldn't be so bad if you admitted the truth. 

DICK: 		I <u>have</u> told the truth! Right from the start! 

BEEMISH: 	To yourself? Have you admitted to yourself that 

		you're in love with Margaret? 

DICK: 		(SLOWLY) Are you out of your mind? 

BEEMISH: 	(SMILES) No, I've just been prying into yours....

		It was pretty obvious to a psychiatrist, Richard. 

		The only reason you agreed to my plan and allowed 

		us to foist Susan on you, was that you wanted to be 

		close to Margaret. 

DICK: 		(STARING) You must be nuts!

BEEMISH: 	(SMILING) Aren't we all, a little?...(BRISK) 

		However, my real purpose in coming here --- Richard, 

		you'd better get out of town fast. 

DICK: 		You mean break my parole? 

BEEMISH: 	There won't be any question of parole. The Assistant 

		D.A. is pretty angry.

DICK: 		Tommy Chamberlain? 

[25]

BEEMISH: 	Well, he's been pretty sweet on Margaret 

		and somehow he's discovered your feelings for her. 

DICK: 		That makes him pretty good. I haven't even discovered 

		them myself. 

BEEMISH: 	At any rate, he's going to press his charges against 

		you. You'll get what I believe they call - the book. 

DICK: 		(WORRIED) You really think I will? 

BEEMISH: 	No doubt about it. My advice is to skip. 
 
DICK: 		Yes, but where - how? You can't pull reservations 

		out of a hat! 

BEEMISH: 	Well, as it happens I have a friend at T.W.A. 

		I oould call him...if you want me to.... 

DICK: 		If I want you to!...Go on, get on that phone - I've 

		got to start packing!

[26]

ROY: 		Myrna Loy, Shirley Temple and Cary Grant will return 

		to the Camel Screen Guild microphone in just a moment.... 

CHANDLER: 	More doctors smoke Camels than any other cigarette, 

		according to a nationwide survey. 

ROY: 		Three leading independent research organizations asked one hundred 

		thirteen thousand, five hundred and ninety-seven doctors 

		what cigarette they smoked. The brand named most was 

		Camel. Yes...and in every walk of life, hosts and hosts 

		of smokers have discovered that Camel's rich, full flavor 

		and cool, cool mildness suit them best. Try a Camel on 

		<u>your</u> "T-Zone"...T for Taste and T for throat....and, see if 

		you don't agree. See how Camel's choice tobaccos, 

		properly aged and expertly blended, bring you greater 

		smoking enjoyment!

ROY: 		And now a final word of thanks to our stars. Myrna, Cary and 

		Shirley -- you've given us a half-hour that we'll all still 

		be laughing at tomorrow. And more than that, a warm feeling 

		of gratitude for what your appearance here tonight means to 

		the Motion Picture Relief Fund. 

SHIRLEY: 	Well Mr. Roy we all want to do our share, but some people do 

		more. Both Cary and Myrna have made <u>several</u> appearances with 

		the Screen Guild Players this year. 

GRANT: 		And why not Mother Agar -- this show belongs to every actor 

		and actress in Hollywood. Right, Myrna? 

LOY: 		You are so right, Cary. And we mustn't forget another 

		generous gesture of our sponsors...each week the makers 

		of Camel cigarettes send free smokes to the men in 

		servicemen's hospitals. This week, among other hospitals, 

		free Camels are being sent to: Veteran's Hospital, Waco, 

		Texas ...U. S. Army Station Hospital, Fort George Mead, 

		Maryland ... and U. S. Marine Hospital, Seattle, Washington. 

GRANT: 		Happy smoking, gentlemen....your free Camels are on the 

		way to you now! 

SHIRLEY: 	And here's more good news! The Camel Screen Guild Players 

		have a great show planned for you next week. One of the 

		most powerful dramas in the history of the American Theatre! 

		And the kind of cast that producers dream about. Cary, you 

		tell them. 

GRANT: 		Next Monday night --"The Valiant", the story of a man who 

		wouldn't talk, starring Gregory Peck, Jeanne Crain and 

		Edward Arnold.

SHIRLEY: 	I wouldn't miss it for anything, and don't any of you. 

		Goodnight.
