MUSIC: THEME ... THEN IN BG

ANNOUNCER: Now, Auto-Lite and its sixty thousand dealers and service stations 
present--

MUSIC: KNIFE CHORD

VOICE: --SUSPENSE! Tonight Auto-Lite brings you Edward G. Robinson in "You 
Can't Die Twice," a SUSPENSE play produced and directed by Anton M. Leader.

MUSIC: UP AND OUT

ANNOUNCER: Friends, if a camel got a drink of water only three times a year, 
his tongue would hang out like a Christmas necktie. But an Auto-Lite Sta-Ful 
Battery thrives on three drinks a year. Yes siree, an Auto-Lite Sta-Ful 
Battery needs water only three times a year in normal car use. And, by 
Cornelius, an Auto-Lite Sta-Ful Battery has extra plates for extra, extra 
power; protected by fiberglass insulation for stronger, longer life. Why, in 
recent tests conducted according to the Society of Automotive Engineers' life 
cycle standards, Auto-Lite Sta-Ful Batteries gave seventy percent longer 
average life than batteries without the Sta-Ful features. So remember: Be 
battery right / Get Auto-Lite! 

MUSIC: THEME ... THEN IN BG

VOICE: And now Auto-Lite presents Edward G. Robinson in a tale well-calculated 
to keep you in--

MUSIC: KNIFE CHORD

VOICE: -- SUSPENSE!

MUSIC: UP AND FADES GENTLY OUT WITH--

SAM: (NARRATES) Eh, it's funny how it happened. Take a good look at me. Am I 
the type you'd say could harm a fly? Ask around my neighborhood. Ask any of my 
old customers. "Sam," they'd tell you--

CUSTOMER: Sam Brown? Why, he wouldn't say boo. Sam Brown -- a murderer? Ha ha. 
Besides, there must be some mistake somewhere. Sam's dead -- a whole year now.

MUSIC: ACCENT ... THEN IN BG

SAM: (NARRATES) So that's what I want to explain: how it all happened. It all 
began that Sunday morning at home with my wife Kay. Poor Katie -- an April 
Fool.

MUSIC: UP AND OUT

KATIE: (ANNOYED) Today <u>is</u> April Fool, isn't it, Sam?

SAM: (CHEERFUL) Yeah, I guess it is, Katie. Why? 

KATIE: Why?! 'Cause we'll have to expect a lot of silly tricks today, that's 
why, from your so-called friends.

SAM: (CHUCKLES) Yeah, that's right. I guess we'll have to be on our guard, 
huh? 

KATIE: <u>You're</u> talkin'? After the way you fell for that April Fools' joke last 
year.

SAM: (CHUCKLES) Yeah, some letdown, all right. When I learned it was all a 
practical joke and I <u>hadn't</u> won fifty thousand in the Irish sweepstakes-- Hey, 
you - you sure took it to heart, too. 

KATIE: Well, why not?! Will I ever in my life even see money like that? 

SAM: Aw, Katie, please-- 

KATIE: Will you ever make it from your miserable milk route? Will ya? 

SAM: Oh, I'm sorry I even mentioned it.

KATIE: You were gonna give me so much! You were gonna get places! Throw a 
million at my feet! A million what? Empty milk bottles?! 

SAM: Well, so I didn't get the breaks. Now, what do you want me to do, Katie? 
Rob a bank? Murder someone? Please let me alone, will ya? I want to hear--

RADIO ANNCR: And now for the local news--

KATIE: Turn that off and listen to me!

SOUND: CLICK! RADIO SWITCHED OFF

KATIE: Murder somebody, he says! Bein' poor is murderin' me! I'm fed up, I 
tell ya, look -- up to here! 

SAM: Aw, Katie, please-- 

KATIE: Don't "Katie" me! 

SOUND: PHONE RINGS

KATIE: (MUTTERS TO HERSELF, DISGUSTED) What's the matter? So early in the 
mornin'.

SOUND: RECEIVER UP ... SERGEANT'S VOICE ON FILTER

KATIE: (INTO PHONE) Hello? 

SERGEANT: Er, Mrs. Katherine Brown?

KATIE: Yes. 

SERGEANT: You're the wife of Samuel E. Brown of 22 Maple Street?

KATIE: Yes. 

SERGEANT: I'm sorry to have to inform you that your husband has been killed, 
Mrs. Brown. 

KATIE: What's that? 

SERGEANT: His body was found just a few hours ago in a ditch on the Clinton 
Turnpike -- killed by a hit-and-run driver, Mrs. Brown. 

KATIE: (COLDLY) Ha ha ha. What is this? Somebody's idea of an April Fool gag? 
Now cut it out!

SERGEANT: I'm really sorry, Mrs. Brown, but this is not an April Fool gag. I 
wish it was, for your sake. Please call at the county morgue, will you? 

KATIE: What? 

SERGEANT: Well, you'll have to identify the - the remains. It's almost beyond 
recognition. But there's a wallet, Mrs. Brown. That's all we have to go on. 

SAM: Oh, Katie, let me-- 

KATIE: (INTO PHONE) Listen, you! You think a joke like this is funny?! You 
ought to have your head examined. Who is this?! 

SERGEANT: Police Sergeant Ryan, ma'am, Third Precinct. 

KATIE: Go on, you crazy dope! 

SERGEANT: Mrs. Brown, please be at the morgue as soon as you can. That is, if 
you want to claim your husband's body.

SOUND: PHONE DISCONNECTS (KATIE'S PERSPECTIVE) ... RECEIVER DOWN

SAM: Hey, what was that? Some gag? 

KATIE: 'Course it was a gag! Why, you're right here. Probably that Joe Brody 
again with his April Fool jokes. He'll get a piece of my mind, believe you me!

RADIO ANNCR: --four firemen, however, were overcome by the smoke--

KATIE: (EXPLODES) Must you listen to that radio?!

SAM: Oh, Katie. My one day off a week. Let me live, please.

RADIO ANNCR: --this morning discovered the body of a man tentatively 
identified as Samuel E. Brown, a local milk driver employed by Dessel Berry's 
company.

SAM: What? What'd he say?

KATIE: Shut up! Listen.

RADIO ANNCR: He's believed to have been the victim of a hit-and-run driver. 
The body was found in the ditch in the Clinton Turnpike mutilated almost 
beyond recognition. A wallet is the sole clue as to his identity. And that 
winds up the nine-thirty edition of the--

SOUND: CLICK! RADIO SWITCHED OFF

SAM: (ASTONISHED) Well, what do you know about--? Did you hear that, Katie? 

KATIE: (UNEASY) Yeah, I did.

SAM: Well, that was me, wasn't it? Me, they were talking about. (CHUCKLES) 
That's a hot one, isn't it? Huh?

KATIE: (REALIZES) Sam -- that phone call just now-- 

SAM: Yeah. 

KATIE: I thought it was an April Fool joke. Must have been the police. Wonder 
how in the world-- 

SOUND: PHONE RINGS

SAM: Huh? Now what?

KATIE: Let me.

SOUND: RECEIVER UP ... HARRY'S VOICE ON FILTER

KATIE: Hello? 

HARRY: Katie? This is Harry, Katie. Gert and me, we just heard. We were 
listening to the radio and you-- You all right, Katie? You know about it? 

KATIE: Sure, I know about it, but that--

HARRY: Oh, we feel awful about it, Katie, and we're coming right over. We'll 
take care of everything. 

KATIE: Harry, listen--

HARRY: Gert'll go downtown with ya -- when you're ready. I'll take care of all 
the paperwork. Oh, excuse me for mentioning it at a time like this. 

KATIE: I don't have to go anypl-- <u>What</u> paperwork? 

HARRY: Why, the insurance policy I sold Sam, remember? Remember I told you 
both how someday it might-- Well, little did I dream. I'm so glad I talked you 
both into it. Ten thousand with double indemnity for accidental death. That's 
twenty thousand, you know. (CONTEMPLATIVE) A final thought for your welfare 
from Sam. 

KATIE: Harry, I can't-- 

HARRY: I know, I know. I know you don't want to talk about it now. Listen, 
Katie, we'll be right over -- ten, fifteen minutes.

SOUND: PHONE DISCONNECTS

KATIE: Harry!

SOUND: KATIE RATTLES THE CRADLE IN VAIN

SAM: Hey-- What was that all about? What did he want? 

SOUND: RECEIVER DOWN

SAM: Katie, I'm talking to you. 

KATIE: (SLOWLY) Wait -- Sam -- I'm trying to think. Oh, it's impossible -- 
you're right here. Sam, what did they mean?

SAM: Huh?

KATIE: They identified you by your wallet? You have it, don't you? 

SAM: My wallet? 

KATIE: Your wallet! 

SAM: Well, naturally. Right here in my pocket where I always-- (<u>PATS HIS 
PANTS</u>) (MYSTIFIED) What the devil? I'm wearing the same pants. It's not here. 
(<u>SNAPS HIS FINGERS</u>) Wait a minute. I remember something now. Well, that maybe 
clears up this whole mystery. 

KATIE: Yes, Sam?

SAM: Well, uh, last night after the poker game, coming home on the bus, there 
was some character jostling against me. We almost had a fight on the bus. 
Sure! Now I think of it, he must have picked my pocket! Why, Katie, it's <u>him</u> 
they must have found on the turnpike. Sure! Say, let me have that phone, will 
ya? I'll call the police and straighten out this whole--

SOUND: RECEIVER UP

KATIE: No, wait! Wait, Sam. 

SAM: What for? 

SOUND: RECEIVER DOWN

KATIE: Sam, maybe we oughta consider this thing a little. 

SAM: Consider what?

KATIE: Your ten-thousand-dollar life insurance policy, Sam -- with that double 
indemnity clause.

SAM: What are you talking about?

KATIE: About our one big chance that we've been waitin' for! 

SAM: Say, what are you driving at? 

KATIE: Did anybody see you comin' home last night? 

SAM: No, I don't think so. Why?

KATIE: Can't you understand? There's a body lyin' in the morgue. The only 
thing they've got to go by was that wallet. Say you never came home last 
night, Sam -- or ever again. Say I went right now and identified that wallet. 
The insurance company would pay me twenty thousand dollars, wouldn't they?

SAM: Yes, I - I guess they would. (DOUBLE TAKE) Are you out of your mind?!

KATIE: You could disappear right now; go to Chicago, say, without being seen. 
I could write you General Delivery. After a while, after I collect, I could 
join you there.

SAM: Oh, Kay-- (HEMS AND HAWS UNCOMFORTABLY BEHIND--)

KATIE: No one'll be the wiser! We can begin life all over! <u>Rich</u>! This could be 
<u>it</u>, Sam.

SAM: No, no, no -- money gotten this way'd never do us any good, Katie.

KATIE: For that amount of money, I'll take my chance and so will you!

SAM: Katie--

KATIE: (SAVAGELY) You'll <u>do</u> it, Sam!

SAM: What--?

KATIE: Oh, yes, you will! Because if you let me down this time, it's the end!

SAM: Oh, Katie, I--

KATIE: Twenty thousand <u>dollars</u>! (REPEATS IT SO IT SINKS IN) Twenty thousand 
<u>dollars</u>.

MUSIC: FIRST ACT CURTAIN ... THEN IN BG

VOICE: For SUSPENSE, Auto-Lite is bringing you Edward G. Robinson in Radio's 
Outstanding Theatre of Thrills -- SUSPENSE! 

MUSIC: UP FOR TAG

ANNOUNCER: Say, er, Hap, will you help me out here? 

HAP: Why, sure, Harlow.

ANNOUNCER: All right, pretend you're on a quiz program and I asked you this 
question--

HAP: Uh huh.

ANNOUNCER: What is it that needs water only three times a year?

HAP: Hmm, let's see, it's, uh-- Is it a kangaroo? 

ANNOUNCER: No, and it's not a camel nor a cactus. 

HAP: Oh. Well, can you give me a hint?

ANNOUNCER: All right. It goes in your car. The initials are A-L-S-F-B.

HAP: A-L-S-F-B? Oh, I've heard that somewhere before. 

ANNOUNCER: It's dandy, it's dynamic; it delivers power, pep, performance. It's 
an Auto-Lite Sta-Ful Battery that needs water only three times a year in 
normal car use.

HAP: Now don't tell me. Let me think. It's, uh-- 

ANNOUNCER: I can't give you any more hints -- 'cept to say it's an Auto-Lite 
Sta-Ful Battery with that extra liquid reserve. 

HAP: That's it! It's an Auto-Lite Sta-Ful Battery!

ANNOUNCER: <u>Right</u> -- with Auto-Lite! The gentleman wins a hand-embroidered 
Auto-Lite Sta-Ful Battery Carrying Case--

HAP: (CHUCKLES)

ANNOUNCER: --and the right to drive into the nearest Auto-Lite service station 
and buy an Auto-Lite Sta-Ful Battery. Remember: Be battery right. / Switch to 
Auto-Lite!

Robinson as Sam in "You Can't Die Twice," a tale well-calculated to keep you 
in--

MUSIC: KNIFE CHORD

VOICE: -- SUSPENSE!

MUSIC: UP FOR SECOND ACT INTRODUCTION ... THEN IN BG--

SAM: (NARRATES) Katie always could make me jump through a hoop. Besides, I - I 
might as well admit it: I'm human. Show me the human that can spit at that 
kind of money. Anyway, I snuck out of town that very day. Got to Chicago. Got 
me a crummy room under the name of Lionel Hendricks. Weeks went by and nothing 
happened. No news at all from Katie and I got really frightened something'd 
gone wrong. I wrote her. Got an answer, General Delivery.

MUSIC: UP BRIEFLY ... THEN IN BG--

KATIE: (FILTER, BUSINESSLIKE) "Dear Mr. Hendricks -- In answer to your 
inquiry, everything is proceeding smoothly. I'm advised that the delay on the 
transaction is because of its unusual nature. No more letters, <u>please</u>. Thank 
you for your interest. Sincerely."

MUSIC: BIG ACCENT ... THEN BEHIND SAM--

SAM: (NARRATES) More weeks passed. Another month -- two, three -- without a 
word from her. Had the police found out? Were they on my trail? And then I 
began to get suspicious of Katie. What was she up to? I had to phone her.

SOUND: KATIE'S VOICE ON FILTER

KATIE: Hello?

SAM: Er, this is me.

KATIE: (LOW, SAVAGE) Are you out of your mind?! (LAUGHS, FEIGNS AMUSEMENT) Oh, 
it's you, Clara! 

SAM: Well, I - I had to talk to you. Why haven't you written? What are you up 
to? Haven't you got it yet? 

KATIE: Not yet.

SAM: Well, when?

KATIE: In a little while, Clara. Just have a little more patience.

SAM: Oh, cut out that Clara stuff.

KATIE: I'll be seeing you soon, dear.

SAM: Katie, it's awful lonesome for me. Do you love me, Katie? 

KATIE: (EXASPERATED) Of course I do!

SAM: Well, I get to wondering. It's six months now. This is crazy! I'm a 
wreck, I'm scared, I can't stand this life. I've never been away from home, 
I'm a family man, Katie!

MAN: (ON FILTER, SLIGHTLY OFF, IMPATIENT) Hey, Katie, make it quick, will ya? 
For Pete's sake.

SAM: Who is that?

KATIE: What?

SAM: That voice.

KATIE: You're imagining things.

SAM: I heard a man's voice! He's right there in the room with you! Now, don't 
deny it! 

KATIE: (NERVOUSLY) I'll - I'll explain everything when I see ya, Clara. 

SAM: I see. So you're two-timing me, huh? Well, that explains everything. I'll 
fix you! I'm coming home right now! 

KATIE: (LOW, INTENSE) If you do, you'll go to jail for about ten years. Think 
it over. (UP, PLEASANT) Goodbye, Clara.

SOUND: PHONE DISCONNECTS (SAM'S PERSPECTIVE)

MUSIC: BIG ACCENT ... THEN BEHIND SAM--

SAM: (NARRATES) There, you see? What could I do? Anyway, that's when I started 
to drink. What else was there? There I was, all mixed-up and alone. I used to 
get good and drunk, and wish someone would at least say--

SOUND: KA-CHING! OF CASH REGISTER ... BAR BACKGROUND 

CLEO: (SEXY) Hello. (NO RESPONSE) I said hello. You all alone? 

SAM: (DRUNK) Hmm? What's that?

CLEO: (LAUGHS) You really tied one on, haven't you? Stranger in town?

SAM: (BITTER) I'm a stranger everywhere. How do you know? 

CLEO: (LIGHTLY) You're lonely, huh? Awww. Well, don't cry about it.

SAM: I'm not cryin'.

CLEO: You want company? 

SAM: Sure.

CLEO: (CHUCKLES) You're kind of cute.

CLEO: Rye high on the gentleman here. 

LUTHER: (OFF) Comin' up.

CLEO: Yeah, I know. Cleo Carter. What's your name? 

SAM: (SLURS IT) Sam. 

CLEO: (AMUSED, NOT SURE SHE HEARD RIGHT) Sam? Oh, Sam. Sam what? 

SAM: (CATCHES HIMSELF) Oh, I mean, uh, Lionel. My name is Lionel Hendricks. 
That's my name. Lionel Hendricks. 

CLEO: What happened to Sam?

SAM: (SADLY) Oh, he's dead.

CLEO: Dead?

SAM: Yeah, dead. Poor lonesome ghost. Nobody cared.

CLEO: Are ya married? (NO ANSWER, AS SHE SUSPECTED) Ah huh. Where are ya from, 
Lionel? (NO ANSWER) You're not on the lam or something, are ya? Cop shy?

SAM: (TEARFUL SELF-PITY) Look, nobody cared -- not even his widow. Sam's 
widow. Name is Katie. Katherine, you know.

CLEO: (YES) Mmm.

SAM: Katie don't even care. Two-timing him! Oh, well. Never mind. Change the 
subject. (A LITTLE BRIGHTER) What do you do, Cleo?

CLEO: Ah, this and that. What do you do, Lionel? 

SAM: Oh, that and this. (LAUGHS DRUNKENLY) Where you from, Cleo? 

CLEO: Here and there. And you? 

SAM: Oh, there and here. (LAUGHS)

CLEO: (LAUGHS) We make a great team, don't we, Sam? 

SAM: Yeah, we sure do. (CHUCKLES)

SOUND: LUTHER'S STEPS APPROACH

LUTHER: Here you are, Cleo. Rye high.

CLEO: Thanks, Luther. 

LUTHER: How about a trip up the Nile, Cleo?

CLEO: (CHUCKLES) Character. (EXPLAINS TO SAM) Luther's a comic, Sam.

SAM: Here now - now, my name isn't Sam. Now, Lionel is my name. Lionel 
Hendricks.

CLEO: Excuse me, Lionel-but-not-Sam.

SAM: That's right. Now, remember. 

JOHN: (OFF) Hiya, Cleo! 

CLEO: (UP, PLEASED TO SEE HIM) Hey, when did you get back? (LOW, TO SAM) I've 
got a pay a visit. Nice to have met ya.

SAM: (DISAPPOINTED) Oh, no, no. Now, where--? Where you going?

CLEO: I gotta see a friend.

SAM: Aw, now, now -- don't leave me alone, will ya?

CLEO: You like my company?

SAM: (SLURRING BADLY) Oh, very much. Very, very, very much.

CLEO: (AMUSED) Much as that, huh? (CHUCKLES)

SAM: Yeah, I certainly do.

CLEO: (MATTER-OF-FACT) Well, it's this way with me, Lionel. I'll be very 
frank. First of all, you're a married man--

SAM: I'm not-- No, no, no, no. Not me. Now - now, Sam's married, not Lionel. 
Sam Brown. (TEARFUL SELF-PITY AGAIN) Poor good fella -- all of a sudden dead. 
Killed dead. (SNUFFLES) You know all that was left of him?

CLEO: No.

SAM: A wallet -- with just a few cents in it. Now he has twenty thousand 
dollars. Success story!

CLEO: Twenty thousand dollars? 

SAM: (YES) Mm hm. He was worth more dead than alive. 

JOHN: (OFF, IMPATIENT) What do you say, Cleo?

CLEO: Lionel, let go of my hand. Look, I gotta see a friend over there.

SAM: Yeah, but why?

CLEO: Percentage, Lionel. He always shows me a good time. Spends money like it 
was water. 

SAM: Yeah?

CLEO: He's rich, see? 

SAM: (SCOFFS) Aw, he's rich! Well, I'm richer. Now - now, don't leave me 
alone, Cleo. I got twenty thousand dollars, I tell ya.

CLEO: (DRY) Not you. Sam.

SAM: Well, what's his is mine. I can lay my hands on it any time I want.

CLEO: (DEAD SERIOUS) You wouldn't kid me, would you, mister?

SAM: I-- (REALIZES HE'S SAID TOO MUCH; TO HIMSELF) Oh. I haven't said a word. 
Not a word. Oh, I think I'm gonna be sick.

CLEO: (TURNS ON THE CHARM) I think you'd better come rest at my apartment, 
Lionel. I really do. We can talk there. I like your talk. It jingles.

MUSIC: BRIDGE

SOUND: VACUUM CLEANER SWITCHED ON ... ROARS

SAM: (STARTLED EXCLAMATIONS AS HE WAKES)

SOUND: VACUUM CLEANER SWITCHED OFF

SAM: (CONFUSED) What?

CLEO: (AMUSED, LIGHTLY) You awake, angel?

SAM: Huh? What? Where am I?

CLEO: At little Cleo's. Don't you remember? Just runnin' the vacuum -- all 
those butts you tumbled on the floor. 

SAM: Cleo?

CLEO: Cleo Carter. Took pity on you; let you sleep off a hangover on the couch 
here. (NO RESPONSE) Cleo. (NO RESPONSE) Ah, you've forgotten.

SAM: (QUIET UNEASE) I remember.

CLEO: Guess what you need's a little drink, huh?

SAM: Yeah.

CLEO: Well, it's on the house.

SOUND: DURING ABOVE, CLEO WALKS TO BOTTLES AND GLASSES, WHICH CLINK AND RATTLE 
AS SHE FIXES A DRINK

SAM: (GROANS IN PAIN) Ohhhhh.

CLEO: (CHUCKLES)

SAM: (GROANS)

CLEO: You know why I'm laughing? I'm surprised at myself.

SAM: Why?

CLEO: 'Cause I like you. I don't know when I ever felt this way before so 
fast.

SAM: Hmm?

CLEO: You said you felt the same way about me. Did you mean it or was it that 
bottle talking? 

SAM: (UNSURE) Well, I - I must have meant it, Cleo.

CLEO: All right then. (BEAT, POINTEDLY) How does it feel to be dead, Sam 
Brown? 

SAM: What?

CLEO: How do you suppose Katie's taking it? 

SAM: (NERVOUS) Uh-- Uh, no, no, I - I didn't tell you--

CLEO: That's all right, that's all right. You told me everything, but it's 
safe with me. To me, Sam Brown is dead.

SAM: Oh. Could I please have that drink?

CLEO: Hm? Oh, sure.

SOUND: CLINK! OF GLASS

SAM: (DRINKS THIRSTILY)

CLEO: The insurance money really comes to twenty thousand dollars, doesn't it? 
Or were you exaggerating? 

SAM: No. I mean-- Yes. It's - it's twenty thousand. 

CLEO: Why they taking so long to pay off? 

SAM: I don't know, I don't know.

CLEO: Ten months is a very long time. Maybe they've already paid and Katie's 
holding out on you.

SAM: Oh, no, no, no. Katie wouldn't do a thing like that. 

CLEO: Why not? Look what she's already done for the money.

SAM: Well, not Katie. She wouldn't. 

CLEO: She may have met another man she likes more than you. 

SAM: Aw, now stop it, stop it, will ya? Katie isn't like that. 

CLEO: (QUIETLY INTENSE) Look, you. Did you mean what you told me about you and 
me or didn't you? Will you repeat it sober? Right now? 

SAM: What? Repeat what? 

CLEO: That you never felt about her in all your married life the way you feel 
about me? That you're going to leave her for me? After you get the money? Say 
it again, Sam, or walk right out of my life. 

SAM: Oh, Cleo-- 

CLEO: I mean it. 

SAM: Well, I - I can't say that about Katie. I just can't.

CLEO: Get out! 

SAM: (PAUSE, SLOWLY) If that's the way you feel, I'll go. 

SOUND: SAM RISES, TAKES A FEW STEPS

CLEO: (WICKEDLY) Go ahead! And when you leave, you might think about whether 
or not you can <u>trust</u> me now that I know all about it. 

SAM: What? 

CLEO: I <u>could</u> call the police, you know. 

SAM: (HELPLESSLY) Oh, Cleo-- 

MUSIC: ACCENT ... THEN BEHIND SAM--

SAM: (NARRATES) I never did know how to handle women. That was always my big 
trouble. Well, she - she could have called the cops, couldn't she? So I made 
up with her. Anyway, I had someone to talk to now. Maybe something would 
happen. (AMUSED) Hm! It did. Oh, she was smart, that Cleo. 

CLEO: You know, Sam, it'll be good to have ten thousand dollars all at once. 

SAM: Yeah, sure will.

CLEO: Know what would be twice as good? Twenty thousand. 

SAM: (CHUCKLES) Wish for the moon why don't you? My share's only ten.

CLEO: Your share's as much as you can get. And you can get it all. 

SAM: No, no, no -- Katie would never give it to me; not all of it. 

CLEO: The way I figure it, Sam, is this. She'll come here to Chicago when she 
finally collects. Well, she can't afford to have you suddenly turn up alive 
back there, so she'll come here. When she does, we'll take it all, you and me.

SAM: Aw, no, no -- she - she'd never give me all of it. I know Katie.

CLEO: I said we'd <u>take</u> it. Use your head, Sammy, use your head. (BEAT, 
POINTEDLY) There's ways. 

SAM: Huh? (REALIZES, WITH QUIET HORROR) Oh. Oh, no, Cleo. No!

CLEO: (GENTLY BACKS OFF; SEXY AGAIN) Well, perhaps not. But, er, get used to 
the idea, just the same. Like breakin' in a pair of shoes. Know what I mean?

MUSIC: ACCENT ... THEN BEHIND SAM--

SAM: (NARRATES) That's the way she worked on me -- over and over again. Then 
she began to get impatient until one day, a year less a day from the time I 
left home-- 

CLEO: (ANGRY) What is all of this?! A practical joke? Tomorrow's April first. 
You waitin' to tell me April Fool?! I'm callin' your bluff, Sam! Come on down 
to a phone booth right now and call that wife of yours! Let me hear with my 
own ears! 

MUSIC: BIG ACCENT ... FOR TRANSITION 

SOUND: KATIE'S VOICE ON FILTER

KATIE: Hello? 

SAM: (NERVOUS, TO CLEO) What do I say?

CLEO: (LOW) Answer her. 

SAM: Oh. (INTO PHONE) Hello, er, Mrs. Brown. This is, uh, me. 

KATIE: (EXCITED) I've got it! I'm holdin' it in my hand now! I'm leavin' for 
Chicago this afternoon. I'll be there at midnight. Get me a room at the 
Stevens. 

CLEO: (LOW, TO SAM) You'll meet her at the station information booth. Tell 
her!

KATIE: Huh?

SAM: (STAMMERS, INTO PHONE) I - I'll meet you at the station information 
booth, Katie. 

KATIE: But why? 

SAM: (LOW, TO CLEO) Why?

CLEO: (LOW, QUICK) You're renting a cabin out in the country. You're takin' 
her on a second honeymoon.

SAM: (LOW, A PROTEST) Cleo--

CLEO: (LOW) Tell her!

KATIE: Hello? Hello?!

SAM: (INTO PHONE) Uh, Katie, I'm - I'm renting a cabin out in the country for 
us. We're - we're going on a second honeymoon. 

MUSIC: BRIDGE ... A WRY "HERE COMES THE BRIDE"

SOUND: CHICAGO TRAIN STATION BACKGROUND ... BELLS, ET CETERA

SAM: (UNEASY) Oh, Cleo, I can't go through with it. Please change your mind.

CLEO: (QUIETLY QUICK AND SAVAGE) I'll give ya just fifteen minutes. I'll be 
hiding in the back of the car and if you're not out there with her <u>and</u> the 
money in fifteen minutes, I'll have every cop in Chicago lookin' for you. I 
mean it, Sam. 

SOUND: KATIE'S HURRIED STEPS APPROACH BEHIND--

KATIE: (APPROACHES, EMOTIONAL) Lionel! Lionel! Darling!

CLEO: (MOVING OFF, TO SAM) Er, thank you, mister. Gate Number Five? Thanks.

KATIE: (IGNORES CLEO, EMBRACES SAM) Darling! Darling! 

SAM: Yeah. (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

KATIE: (ALMOST TEARFUL) Lionel! (THEN LOW, IMPASSIONED) Oh, Sam-- My darling 
Sam.

SAM: (CHUCKLES, ALSO TEARFUL)

KATIE: I'm so happy.

SAM: Hello, Katie. Don't-don't-don't cry. 

KATIE: You're crying, too. 

SAM: (DENIES IT, LIGHTLY) Oh, no-- (CHUCKLES)

KATIE: (TEARFUL) Sam! We're together again.

SAM: Oh, yeah.

KATIE: And we're rich. We're rich!

SAM: (SADLY) Yeah.

KATIE: Well, aren't ya excited? Wasn't it worth waitin' for? And no one 
suspects. I can't believe it. We have money and we're together.

SAM: Yeah. Here - here, uh, let me take your bag.

KATIE: Yeah, it hasn't been out of my hand the whole trip. It's <u>all</u> in here. 
In hundred dollar bills. 

SAM: Well, no wonder it's so heavy. Come on, let's - let's go, quick. 

SOUND: THEIR STEPS OUT OF STATION, IN BG

KATIE: (QUIET HAPPINESS) We're really goin' on a second honeymoon. Aw, Sam, I 
could die for joy. 

MUSIC: WRY ACCENT ... FOR TRANSITION 

SOUND: AUTOMOBILE PULLS TO A STOP ... CAR DOORS OPEN AND CLOSE ... SAM AND 
KATIE'S STEPS ON GRAVEL ... CRICKETS CHIRP, IN BG

KATIE: Well, it certainly is way out in the country, Sam, I'll say that for 
it. So quiet.

SAM: Yeah, I know. 

KATIE: You're actin' funny, Sam. (APOLOGETIC) I couldn't help it that it took 
so long. They said they had to investigate and everything. It was no picnic, 
let me tell ya. 

SOUND: CABIN DOOR OPENS ... THEIR STEPS INTO CABIN

SAM: (TO HIMSELF) Where the devil is that light? Oh.

SOUND: CLICK! OF LIGHT SWITCH

KATIE: (SURPRISED) What is--? Is this the cabin you rented for our second 
honeymoon? This <u>shack</u>? (NO ANSWER, INCREASINGLY TENSE AS SHE REALIZES) Sam, 
what is it? You couldn't've brought me here for a honeymoon. Why <u>did</u> you bring 
me here? (NO ANSWER) Answer me, Sam. 

SAM: (CALM AND QUIET) I'm leaving you, Katie. 

KATIE: What?! 

SAM: I'm leaving you. This is the end of our life together. 

KATIE: (TEARFUL) But why? Why?!

SAM: Open the bag and get out the money. Here. Now you take half and I take 
half, and we each go our way. Now, please, quick-quick-quick.

KATIE: How can you do this?! 

SAM: I want my half now. 

SOUND: CLEO'S STEPS IN, BEHIND--

CLEO: (APPROACHES) You mean you want it <u>all</u>, Sam.

KATIE: (STARTLED) What--?!

SAM: (UPSET) Now, you said you'd let me handle it alone, Cleo. You promised 
not to interfere. You promised!

KATIE: (HORRIFIED) So that's it! Another woman! 

SAM: (HEMS AND HAWS UNCOMFORTABLY)

CLEO: Take the money out of the bag, Sam, and let's go! 

KATIE: (TEARFUL) Oh, Sam! Sam!

SAM: (APOLOGETIC) Oh, Katie--

KATIE: How could you do this to me?! I loved ya, Sam. I loved ya. I wanted 
only your good, believe me, I did. (WEEPS, IN BG)

SAM: Oh, Katie. Katie, don't cry. I can't stand seeing you cry. It hurts me.

CLEO: Sam? (NO ANSWER) <u>Sam</u>?!

SOUND: CLEO SLAPS SAM IN THE FACE

SAM: Huh?

CLEO: Get the money, Sam -- all of it! 

SAM: Katie, I have to do this.

KATIE: (DEFIANT, HER OLD SHREWISH SELF AGAIN) Not one cent! 

SAM: Now, give it to me, Katie. Cleo, can't you keep half? 

KATIE: Half?! I'm keepin' it all! And you know what else I'll do? I'll send 
the police a letter--

SAM: Oh, no.

KATIE: --and tell 'em everything!

SAM: No, no -- you wouldn't! 

KATIE: Wouldn't I? Oh, wouldn't I, though?!

SAM: No, no, -- Kate-Kate-Kate, you don't mean that!

KATIE: Just try me. Go ahead!

SAM: No, please, Katie--!

SOUND: STRUGGLE BEHIND--

KATIE: (INCREASINGLY HYSTERICAL) You might as well put down that razor, 'cause 
I'm not scared of you! Not that much! I'll send 'em a letter with the whole 
story -- and your description, and hers, and <u>everything</u>!

SAM: (SAVAGELY) You won't! You won't! You won't!

KATIE: (SHRIEKS WILDLY, THEN DEATH GURGLES BEHIND--)

SOUND: STRUGGLE AS SAM STABS KATIE MULTIPLE TIMES BEHIND--

SAM: Because it's all your fault! All your fault! All your fault!

MUSIC: FOR A BRUTAL MURDER ... THEN CALMER BEHIND SAM--

SAM: (NARRATES, QUIETLY) Katie was dead. I don't remember much of the ride 
back to Cleo's place, with the valise with the money on my lap. I was numb, 
exhausted. I collapsed on the floor of the apartment and fell asleep, cradling 
that valise, and it was past noon when I woke up. The valise was still in my 
arms, but it was open and - the money was gone. And so was Cleo. She wasn't 
there. She was gone. I was alone. (CRIES OUT HELPLESSLY) Cleo!

SOUND: TRANSITIONAL PAUSE ... THEN KA-CHING! OF CASH REGISTER ... BAR 
BACKGROUND

SAM: (MISERABLE) Luther? Have you - you seen Cleo today? 

LUTHER: So she left you, huh? 

SAM: Yeah.

LUTHER: (QUIET CHUCKLE) You better have a drink.

SAM: Yeah.

LUTHER: You look as though you could stand it. 

SOUND: DRINK POURED

SAM: That's right.

LUTHER: Well, you can't blame Cleo -- not after what you done last night. 

SAM: (STARTLED) Huh? (<u>KNOCKS OVER GLASS</u>) Huh? Last night?

LUTHER: I know <u>all</u> about it.

SAM: What do you mean? 

LUTHER: You know what I mean, Sam. Aw, how can you <u>live</u> with yourself?

SAM: Huh? I didn't do anything. I-- 

LUTHER: Don't give me that. I know everything because -- I was there. 

SAM: (INCREASINGLY AGITATED) No, no--! 

LUTHER: You think no one was watching you, huh? But, Sam, I saw the whole 
thing from start to finish! 

SAM: You couldn't have! 

LUTHER: Can it, will ya? If I done that, I couldn't live with meself for the 
rest of me life. It'll torture you, see. 

SAM: Now stop it! 

LUTHER: You won't eat and you won't sleep -- because the memory of it'll 
always haunt ya!

SAM: Now stop it! Stop it! 

LUTHER: It'll haunt ya and haunt ya until the day you die! Unless you confess 
right here and now! 

SAM: All right! 

LUTHER: Confess!

SAM: All right, <u>stop</u>! (QUIETLY BREATHLESS) I did it. I killed my wife.

MUSIC: TURBULENT BRIDGE

SAM: (CALM, THOUGHTFUL) That's about all, Lieutenant. It was strange how it 
all happened. Strange how it started. Yeah, stranger still how Luther here 
knew.

LIEUTENANT: Yeah, how <u>did</u> you know, Luther?

LUTHER: Oh, I didn't, Lieutenant.

SAM: What's that?

LUTHER: No, not a thing. Well, what did I say to him? "How can you live with 
yourself after last night?" So what? Everyone done somethin' last night they 
was ashamed of. Well, every night in the week. How was I to think this here 
guy commit' a murder? You see, cap'n, all I was up to was a-- Well, what's the 
date today? You get it now? I was just makin' with an April Fool joke.

SAM: (BEAT, QUIET DISBELIEF, SLOW) April Fool joke. April Fool. (CHUCKLES IN 
SPITE OF HIMSELF) Oh, Luther -- you killed me.

ANNOUNCER: (NERVOUSLY) Yes, Mr. Robinson! 

ROBINSON: Can't you say anything but "Yes, Mr. Robinson"?! 

ANNOUNCER: (AMUSED, LIGHTLY) Yes, Mr. Robinson, I can say this: Sta-Ful 
Batteries are made by Auto-Lite men who make over four hundred products for 
cars, trucks, airplanes, and boats, in twenty-eight Auto-Lite plants from 
coast to coast. Yes siree, and Auto-Lite also makes complete electrical 
systems for many makes of America's finest cars. Batteries, spark plugs, 
generators, starting motors, coils, distributors -- all ignition-engineered to 
fit together perfectly, work together perfectly, because they're a perfect 
team. So, folks, don't accept electrical parts that are supposed to be as 
good. Ask for and insist on Auto-Lite original factory parts at your 
neighborhood service station, car dealer, garage, or repair shop. Remember: 
You're always right / with Auto-Lite.
