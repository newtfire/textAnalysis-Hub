ANNOUNCER
HAVRILLA:
Ladies and gentlemen, you are about to hear the opening episode of a new and 
heart-gripping romance entitled--"Dangerous Paradise", starring Elsie Hitz and 
Nick Dawson.

"Dangerous Paradise" is presented to you by the makers of Woodbury's Facial 
Powder and Woodbury's Facial Soap. At the end of this program we will tell you 
how you can try Woodbury's Facial Powder free.

ANNOUNCER
VAN VOORHEES:
But now to "Dangerous Paradise", with Miss Hitz as Gail Brewster, young, 
attractive, by profession a newspaper feature writer, with a flair for 
adventure and the confidence that she knows her way around; and Mr. Dawson as 
Dan Gentry, young, also venturesome, and convinced that the loss of his 
fortune and a disappointing love affair have qualified him as the world's most 
hard-boiled cynic and a record-breaking breaker of idols and ideals.

As the story opens, Dan, who is at heart romantic, but determined in his 
bitterness to avoid all women, has joined the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. 
Under orders, he has trailed the chief of a smuggling ring to the South Seas, 
where, disguised as a beach comber, he has joined the gang he is trying to 
trap. At the same time, Gail has been detailed by her editor to write a series 
of feature stories debunking the romance of the South Seas. She is also 
preparing to marry Duke Weyman, a fabulously wealthy copra planter in that 
region.

With these two objectives she sails to the Philippines where she takes off in 
a plane for the island owned by her fiance.

(PAUSE--SOUND OF PLANE TAKING OFF)

Now, off the coast of New Guinea, her plane strikes a typhoon.

(PAUSE--SOUND OF WIND)

The motor falters. (SOUND OF MOTOR FALTERING) Steadies. (SOUND OF MOTOR 
RECOVERING) Fails. (PAUSE--MOTOR DIES) They crash. (SOUND OF CRASH) (PAUSE) 
And for four long hours Gail and her pilot cling to the floating wreckage.

CUE: --30 seconds--

GAIL: Olsen?

OLSEN: Yes, Miss.

GAIL: Do you think the plane will float much longer?

OLSEN: It's hard to tell, Miss Brewster. These waves are knockin' her loose, 
fast.

GAIL: (WEARILY) How long have we been down now?

OLSEN: About four hours, I'd say.

GAIL: It seems like four years.

OLSEN: I'm sorry, Miss Brewster. I should'a known that sky was bad.

GAIL: Olsen, will you stop blaming yourself? You <u>said</u> it was bad. You didn't 
want to start. I made you come.

OLSEN: Miss Brewster, I'm the pilot. I'm supposed to know better.

GAIL: Nonsense. You did as you were told. Where are we now--do you suppose?

OLSEN: I guess we blew quite a ways off the coast of New Guinea. We've drifted 
considerable, too. We're maybe somewheres between the coast and the Solomon 
Islands.

GAIL: (WITH FORCED GAIETY) The Solomon Islands! Why, that's fine, Olsen. We'll 
find a nice little tropical island and go native until Duke finds us.

OLSEN: I don't think there's a chance. The plane won't hold together much 
longer--and besides, there's--there's----!

GAIL: (SOBERLY) Yes, I know--sharks. I've been thinking about them. (PAUSE) 
How is your leg now, Olsen?

OLSEN: It hurts pretty bad. I guess it's broke.

GAIL: You poor man. You didn't tell me that! Can't I help you?

OLSEN: No, Miss. (PAUSE) No. I'm all right. I'm holdin' on. It ain't blowin' 
so hard now.

GAIL: (THOUGHTFULLY) Olsen--I don't want to die, do you?

OLSEN: I sure don't--but it looks bad, Miss.

GAIL: I'm not <u>afraid</u> to die. I just don't <u>want</u> to die. It's been so much fun, 
living. And right now--just as I was coming here to marry Duke--this happens. 
It's <u>cruel</u>.

OLSEN: Yeh! It is tough. I wish I'd never brought you out of the Philippines.

GAIL: Don't say that again. I've told you a hundred times, it's not your 
fault.

OLSEN: I don't mean that. It's--it's--something else. (HE GROANS.)

GAIL: Olsen--are you all right!

OLSEN: Okay. I just slipped a little--I'm still here.

GAIL: Can't you come closer so I can help hold you on?

OLSEN: No thanks. I can't move. I'll stick here.

GAIL: I'm afraid we're sinking fast. Well, this is one assignment I'll never 
finish. But we'll make the front page,--that'll be something, won't it, Old 
Timer? (PAUSE) Olsen--does it hurt to drown?

OLSEN: I don't know--yet.

GAIL: Well--I'll find out for myself. I've always wondered about it. How is 
your leg now?

OLSEN: Better. It don't hurt any more. I can't feel <u>anything</u>--except my 
fingers. They hurt from holdin' on.

GAIL: I wish I could help you. (PAUSE) Olsen--what did you mean when you said 
you wish you hadn't brought me out of the Philippines?

OLSEN: I've been wantin' to tell you about that--but there ain't time, now--
but remember <u>this</u>--if you get the chance--go back home. You ain't safe. You 
don't know anything about the dirty part of the South Seas. I could tell you--
plenty.

GAIL: Olsen! tell me. (STARTLED) Olsen--where are you? Olsen! (PLAINTIVELY) 
Don't go--yet. Wait for me. I don't want to go down into that water, alone.

OLSEN: (VERY WEAK) I'm here--but I can't hold on--much longer.

GAIL: You must hold on! (JOYOUSLY) Olsen! Look there's a boat,--a little 
sailboat. It's coming this way.

OLSEN: (EAGERLY) Wave something.

GAIL: I haven't anything to wave--unless I can reach my dress under this 
flying suit--If I can tear it, I'll wave it. Gosh, it's hard to tear. (PAUSE) 
There! Now I've got it. (ALMOST IN HYSTERICS) Well, I'm in rags . . . but 
never mind, Olsen-- If we're rescued, I can wear a grass skirt--and I'll dance 
the Hula for you. There, I'm waving Olsen. You pray.

OLSEN: Okay, Miss. You wave.

GAIL: Look! He sees us. He's coming this way. Olsen! Olsen! Where are you? 
Olsen! Oh! Goodbye, Olsen, goodbye Old Timer!

DAN: (VOICE IS DISTANT) Hey there! Can you hear me?

GAIL: (TO HERSELF) Poor boy!

DAN: Hey! <u>Can</u> you hear me?

GAIL: What? Oh! Yes--yes--come quick!

DAN: (VOICE IS CLOSER) Well, then, get ready to catch this line and make it 
fast. I say catch this line. All right--<u>now</u>--grab it--okay! Can you get loose? 
Come on--come on (IMPATIENTLY) Make it snappy!

GAIL: All right.

DAN: Make that rope fast. Now, hold on to it. That's right. Come on--quick--
slide along the wing--be careful don't let go the rope. That's the boy. Hold 
tight. Now--give me your hand, Sonny--up you come. There, careful now. There 
you are. WELL, FOR THE LOVE OF MIKE . . . So you're a <u>GIRL</u>, eh? Huh! Well, are 
you all alone?

GAIL: Yes--I'm alone. Olsen has gone. <u>I</u> was about ready to go, too.

DAN: Who is Olsen?

GAIL: My pilot. He held on for hours, but he was washed off just as you 
sighted us. Huh! Just two minutes more was all he needed. I couldn't save him. 
He was there--and then--then--Oh!

DAN: Yeh! Yeh! That's tough. Well, there's nothing <u>we</u> can do. You can't 
help Olsen, now.

GAIL: No, No! You're right.

DAN: Come on--snap out of it. You've got to keep your chin up. We'll get under 
way now. You sit in here in the stern. I'll cast off this rope.

GAIL: All right.

DAN: Well, who <u>are</u> you--what's your name?

GAIL: I am Gail Brewster--a newspaper writer.

DAN: Not <u>the</u> Gail Brewster?

GAIL: I'm the only one I know. Why?

DAN: I've read some of your stuff in the coast newspapers.

GAIL: (INTERESTED) Really? Like it?

DAN: (CASUALLY) Not much. You don't know people very well.

GAIL: (WITH A FORCED LAUGH) Well--this is refreshing. A self-appointed 
literary critic . . . clad only in a dirty pair of pants, on a smelly little 
boat in the South Seas.

DAN: You asked for it. I told you. (ABRUPTLY) What's a girl like you doing 
down here, alone, anyhow?

GAIL: Don't worry. I can take care of myself. I am down here to write about 
the South sea Islands, and to marry a man named Duke Weyman.

DAN: What! You--marry the Duke?

GAIL: Yes. Why? Is that so strange? Do you know him?

DAN: Do I know him! (LAUGHS) That's a hot one. Everybody knows Duke Weyman. 
Say! You're not stringing me, are you?

GAIL: Do you mean to be so insulting, or is it just a crude sense of humor? At 
any rate, I don't care for it. But since you're my host, in a sense, I'll try 
to overlook it.

DAN: Thank you.

GAIL: Yes. I <u>am</u> to marry Duke Weyman. I flew from the Philippines in his plane 
with his pilot.

DAN: (NOT TOO SORRY) Sorry if I hurt your feelings, lady. Look out for that 
boom--watch your head. You see, Duke Weyman is a pretty big man down this way. 
He's well--he's the boss. He owns most of the money in this part of the world. 
They always said he'd never get married. Ummm. So <u>you</u> hooked him. . . . Well, 
well, I congratulate you.

GAIL: (COLDLY) Thank you. Now, suppose you tell me who <u>you</u> are and where 
you're taking me?

DAN: All right . . . sure! My name is Dan. I work down here. We raise copra. 
You know--copra, dried cocoanut meat.

GAIL: Certainly I know what copra is.

DAN: Bright girl.

GAIL: Where are we headed?

DAN: Horseshoe Island, next stop!

GAIL: That means nothing to me. What is Horseshoe Island?

DAN: Horseshoe Island is where we--raise copra.

GAIL: How near is it to Australia?

DAN: Oh! about six hundred miles.

GAIL: What's your last name? What do you do?

DAN: Now, take it easy--you're going to have plenty of time. My last name is 
Gentry. I represent the boss of the copra outfit.

GAIL: I see . . . you're sort of overseer . . . a foreman.

DAN: Well, you can call it that. Now let me ask you something. Did you have a 
radio? Does the Duke know you crashed and cracked up about ten thousand 
dollars worth of airplane?

GAIL: No. There was a wireless on the plane, but Olsen had no chance to use 
it, and I didn't know how.

DAN: Then the Duke hasn't any idea where you are?

GAIL: No. (SUDDENLY APPREHENSIVE) Why do you say that? What are you getting 
at?

DAN: Only that I'm afraid it'll be a long time before you see Duke Weyman.

GAIL: Why? I don't understand. This place we're going--this island. I can stay 
there until a ship arrives--or until we can get a wireless through to Duke, 
can't I?

DAN: No. That's just the point. You can't.

GAIL: (COLDLY) May I ask why not?

DAN: Yes, you can ask, but I don't have to tell you. You got yourself into 
this mess, and if you want me to try to help you, you've <u>got</u> to trust me.

GAIL: Why should I trust you. You look like a--a beach-comber, you have the 
manners of an alley-rat, and I think you're lying to me.

DAN: Okay. Nevertheless, you'll <u>have</u> to trust me. You have no choice. I don't 
know what to do with you. I can't take you to Horseshoe Island. You wouldn't 
be safe with the mob there.

GAIL: Don't be silly. This is a civilized world we're living in.

DAN: There's no civilization down here. There are only four people on 
Horseshoe Island outside of the natives. One!--there's Pango, a half-breed--
not a decent breath in his body.

GAIL: Really?

DAN: Two!--A girl--Daisy. She is Pango's--well, girl-friend--anybody's girl-
friend--but attached to Pango, at the moment. She's from the San Francisco 
streets.

GAIL: Very chivalrous, aren't you?

DAN: Three! There's Hawkins--a sea-captain who should have been hanged long 
ago.

GAIL: Mmm! Nice people--you must feel perfectly at home.

DAN: Sure. I belong. I'm no angel . . . don't claim to be. So, perhaps there 
<u>is</u> no reason for you to trust me, but at least you have <u>less</u> for trusting 
Pango and the rest of the gang. Even the natives--head hunters.

GAIL: That's <u>your</u> story. Frankly, I don't believe it.

DAN: (UNEMOTIONALLY) Yeh! That's my story, and you'll <u>have</u> to believe it.

GAIL: So--Well, what happens to me then? Do you tie an anchor on my neck and 
drop me overboard?

DAN: Yes, I guess I will.

GAIL: What?

DAN: Well--maybe we can find some other way, although I'm hanged if I know 
what it is. I'd run you over to another island and leave you there, except 
that this old tub is half full of water already and I'll just about make 
Horseshoe Island with her. So trying to take you anywhere <u>else</u> is out.

GAIL: (ANGRY) Please don't concern yourself with my troubles any more. Take me 
to your island. I'll take my chances with this Pango person.

DAN: No. I can't do that. I'd as soon throw you in a nest of rattlesnakes.

GAIL: Well--a nest of them--or only one--what's the difference? As a matter of 
fact, I think I'd prefer this Pango's company to yours.

DAN: Yeh? Well, that's O. K., but there's one little point you've overlooked, 
Miss Brewster. I'm not asking your opinion. I'm <u>telling</u> you! Now, I don't like 
to be so hard-boiled about it, but you won't listen to reason.

GAIL: Now just a minute. Let me understand you. When I came aboard your boat, 
I thought I was being rescued. As a matter of fact, I'm not being rescued--I'm 
being kidnapped.

DAN: Well! Well! Well! How did you ever guess it, Miss Brewster?

ANNOUNCER VAN VOORHEES: Is Dan going in for kidnapping? Are Gail's fears 
justified? Follow the adventures of this romantic pair in the next episode of 
their enthralling adventure in "Dangerous Paradise" which will come to you at 
this same hour on Friday.
