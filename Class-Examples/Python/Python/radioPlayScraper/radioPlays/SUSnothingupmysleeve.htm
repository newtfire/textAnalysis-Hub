ANNOUNCER: Just about the gayest couple in detective fiction are Nora and Nick 
Charles. Nick Charles is really the detective, but Nora makes a beautiful and 
able assistant. You'll hear all about the Charles family when you listen to 
"The Adventures of the Thin Man" every Friday beginning January eighth over 
this station at eight-thirty p. m., Eastern War Time. And for the Pacific time 
zone, at nine-thirty p. m., Pacific War Time. 

MUSIC: THEME ... KNIFE CHORD ... THEN IN BG--

NARRATOR: (QUIETLY) "Suspense."

MUSIC: THEME ... FILLS A PAUSE ... THEN BEHIND NARRATOR--

NARRATOR: Tonight, Columbia brings you as guest stars two deft players from 
the movie lots of Hollywood; the stages of Broadway -- Miss Elissa Landi and 
Mr. George Coulouris. They are here to spend with us a half-hour of - 
SUSPENSE. SUSPENSE is compounded of mystery and suspicion and dangerous 
adventure. In this series are stories calculated to intrigue you, to stir your 
nerves, to offer you a precarious situation and then - withhold the solution 
until the last possible moment. Tonight, for instance, Miss Landi plays for us 
an agreeable young lady who is on the trail of some hot money, and Mr. 
Coulouris plays for us a disagreeable young man who may or may not know more 
about the money than he says. We trust that, with this tale, we shall keep you 
in-- 

MUSIC: KNIFE CHORD ... THEN THEME FADES OUT BEHIND ANNOUNCER--

NARRATOR: --suspense. 

ANNOUNCER: For SUSPENSE tonight, CBS presents Elissa Landi and George 
Coulouris in "Nothing Up My Sleeve" by John Dickson Carr.

MUSIC: A LIVELY INTRODUCTION ... FOR NEWS HOT OFF THE PRESS ... THEN IN BG

NEWSBOY: Extray! Extray! Read all about it! "Shark" Morgan caught! Extray! 
Extray! Read all about it! "Shark" Morgan caught!

NARRATOR: It's New Year's Eve, remember? Times Square is celebrating. The 
fiery lights flash no longer, but the crowds are still the same: thronging, 
jostling, singing; drowning out a voice at the street corner when it says-- 

NEWSBOY: Fatal gun battle at Jamaica! Read all about it! Fatal gun battle at 
Jamaica! Read all about it!

MUSIC: LIVELY INTRO FADES OUT DURING ABOVE ... TURNS OMINOUS ... IN BG

NARRATOR: But would that cry perhaps reach as far as a large and sedate 
country house some twenty miles from New York? Out there the earth is sealed 
up with snow. The white pillars of the house rise up high and ghostly against 
it, showing no outward lights. A lonely house, this mansion in Burr Woods.

WOMAN: Just the place for a murder, I've always said.

MAN: Wouldn't surprise me, either. These Rouths are a funny lot. 

SOUND: ROUTH SHOOTS BILLIARDS METHODICALLY -- CUE STICK ON BILLIARD BALLS -- 
BEHIND--

NARRATOR: And alone in that house tonight -- <u>apparently</u> alone -- is a man 
practicing shots in a billiard room, a long and paneled room at the back of 
the house. (PAUSE FOR BILLIARD BALLS) Now, look at Mr. Derrick Routh, as tall, 
and lean, and well-tailored as ever. Many people don't like him: he's a little 
too supercilious; a little too sure of himself; too suggestive of the lifted 
lip and the glazed eye. There he stands in the billiard room under the snow-
covered skylight, leaning over the green cloth under brilliant lights, when--

MUSIC: OUT ABRUPTLY WITH--

SOUND: KNOCK AT DOOR

ROUTH: (SURPRISED) Huh? (CALLS) Just a moment, please. 

SOUND: A FINAL BILLIARD SHOT

ROUTH: (SATISFIED, TO HIMSELF) Ah, good shot. (CALLS) Yes? Come in.

SOUND: DOOR OPENS
 
DOROTHY: Excuse me, Mr. Routh?

ROUTH: Oh, not at all. Hey, wait, aren't you, Miss, er--?

DOROTHY: I'm Dorothy Dale, your aunt's social secretary. Surely you remember 
that?

ROUTH: Oh, of course, of course. Forgive me for forgetting your name. You 
surprised me, Dorothy.

DOROTHY: Yes, I thought I surprised you a little.

ROUTH: No, I mean, you surprised me by being in the house at all.

DOROTHY: Why? 

ROUTH: Why? Why, this is New Year's Eve. Shouldn't you be out getting drunk 
and blowing cardboard horns and doing the other fantastic things that people 
do?

DOROTHY: (DISTRESSED) I haven't much heart for that tonight.

ROUTH: (POLITE) Please, don't become emotional, Dorothy. I <u>detest</u> emotion. If 
you're shivering, go over by the radiator.

DOROTHY: Mr. Routh, may I ask you a question?

ROUTH: Of course.

DOROTHY: Did you ever feel sick at heart? 

ROUTH: Huh?

DOROTHY: Physically sick, I mean, so that your insides turned over and you 
couldn't get your breath and-- Did you? 

ROUTH: No. No, I can't say I did. Ahem. May I move you aside for just a 
moment? (BEAT) Thank you. 

SOUND: A BILLIARD SHOT

ROUTH: (PLEASED) Ah! Not bad.

DOROTHY: Can't you guess why I came here to see you tonight?

ROUTH: No.

DOROTHY: Because I'm in terrible trouble, Mr. Routh -- desperate trouble -- 
and I think you can help me. 

ROUTH: <u>I</u> can help you? How? 

DOROTHY: For one thing, you're making quite a name for yourself as a lawyer.

ROUTH: Yes, that's what others have told me.

DOROTHY: For another thing-- Do you know a man named "Shark" Morgan? 

SOUND: A BILLIARD SHOT

ROUTH: (CONSIDERS) "Shark" Morgan. (BEAT) "Shark," did you say?

DOROTHY: Mm hm.

ROUTH: "Shark" Morgan. No, I'm sure I've never heard that name before.

DOROTHY: You <u>ought</u> to know him. He's a little dark-faced man with most of his 
upper lip cut away in a knife fight so that you can see all his teeth. That's 
why they call him "Shark."

ROUTH: Oh, he sounds like an unpleasant-looking person.

DOROTHY: He is, or was, a ghastly looking person. You don't know him? He's not 
a client of yours?

ROUTH: No.

DOROTHY: (BEAT) I don't believe you. 

ROUTH: Just a moment, Miss Dorothy Dale. I must put down this cue--

SOUND: PUTS DOWN CUE

ROUTH: --and say a few words myself.

DOROTHY: Please do.

ROUTH: I don't want to be offensive to you, but it seems to me that for a paid 
employee of my aunt, practically a servant, you are taking a great deal on 
yourself. 

DOROTHY: (GASPS DURING ABOVE) If you're trying to hurt me that way, you're 
succeeding. But go ahead.

ROUTH: You come to me at eleven o'clock at night. You come rushing into this 
billiard room-- Observe, I call it a billiard room, though this is actually a 
pool table, just as everything in life gets its wrong name--

DOROTHY: I entirely agree.

ROUTH: Yes, but you agree about what?

DOROTHY: That everything gets its wrong name. Honest men are called thieves 
and thieves are called honest men.

ROUTH: Would you mind explaining that remark, please? 

DOROTHY: I can explain it very easily. I'm engaged to be married to Jerry 
Wynton. 

ROUTH: (BEAT) Well?

DOROTHY: Don't say you don't know who Jerry Wynton is! He was in college with 
you. 

ROUTH: I played on our extremely second-rate baseball team with him, yes.

DOROTHY: You never liked him, did you?

ROUTH: Liked him? I'm afraid I never noticed him.

DOROTHY: Jerry Wynton works at City and Provincial Bank on Fifty-First Street. 
He's a teller there. Does that mean anything to you?

ROUTH: (AMUSED, FLIPPANT) No. You see, it's not my bank. 

DOROTHY: I was at the City and Provincial Bank yesterday afternoon. 
(POINTEDLY) <u>Yesterday</u> afternoon, Mr. Routh, just before closing time. It was a 
dark day, and the lights were on. There weren't many people in that big marble 
hall. I went up to Jerry's window, if that's what you call it and--

MUSIC: SNEAKS IN DURING ABOVE AND TOPS DOROTHY FOR A TRANSITION TO A FLASHBACK

DOROTHY: (PLAYFUL) Can you cash a check for a million dollars? 

JERRY: (WARMLY) Hello, Dolly. 

DOROTHY: Hello, Jerry. You glad to see me?

JERRY: (PLAYFUL IRONY) I am not pleased to see you here, Dolly. 

DOROTHY: (AMUSED) Hm?

JERRY: I'm never pleased to see you here.

DOROTHY: And why not?

JERRY: Because I can't make love to you. 

DOROTHY: (CHUCKLES)

JERRY: Can you imagine anybody making love in a bank? 

DOROTHY: Oh, we might sneak into the president's office.

JERRY: As a matter of fact, I've dreamed of holding a party in there. But 
it'll never happen -- unless I'm fired, which is very likely.

DOROTHY: Jerry, sometimes I wish you weren't so easy-going.

JERRY: I'm not easy-going with the bank's money, Dolly. Otherwise I'd be 
shoving it out to you through the window in double handfuls like this.

DOROTHY: Jerry, for heaven's sake, no!

JERRY: Then state your business, madam. The convict in the next cage is 
watching us already.

DOROTHY: I want to cash a check. Here it is. Twenty dollars. That is, if my 
account can stand it! (CHUCKLES) 

JERRY: Yes, I think we can manage that. How will you have it?

DOROTHY: Oh, it doesn't matter. Any way-- (SUDDENLY TENSE, LOW) Jerry! 

JERRY: What's wrong?

DOROTHY: Look over there. 

JERRY: Where?

DOROTHY: Over there, by that marble table with the pens and ink on it. The 
little man with no upper lip to his mouth and all his teeth showing.

MUSIC: ACCENT ... THEN OMINOUS, IN BG

JERRY: Ugly looking devil, I admit. 

DOROTHY: He's carrying something like a violin case. 

JERRY: Hold on. I've seen that fellow someplace before. 

DOROTHY: Of course you have! Don't you remember where?

JERRY: It was--

DOROTHY: It was out at Mr. Routh's house in the country, when you came to 
visit me last Sunday. The man with the teeth and five other men were coming 
out on the porch as we were going in. 

JERRY: Wait a minute, Dolly. That's not all. 

DOROTHY: What is it?

JERRY: There's some very funny-looking customers in this bank right now. 

DOROTHY: Where?

JERRY: At Mr. Wallace's window. At Mr. Robinson's window. And up by the guard 
at the front door.

DOROTHY: They don't seem to make any sound. As though they all wore rubber-
soled shoes. Jerry, something's going to happen!

JERRY: I know it is. Unless I can get off this stool and warn--

SOUND: BURST OF MACHINE GUN FIRE

DOROTHY: (SHRIEKS IN SHOCK)

MORGAN: (SLIGHTLY OFF, BANK LOBBY ECHO) That was just to call your attention, 
folks; just to call your attention. Now just stand where y'are, all of ya, and 
nobody'll get hurt. (CONTINUES TO TALK, IN BG) [X] Come on, you -- stay over 
there. Stay right there! Now, everybody in this place is covered.

DOROTHY: (OVERLAPS WITH ABOVE AT [X], LOW) Darling, I - I'm scared. What 
should I do?

JERRY: Just stand still. 

DOROTHY: I don't dare turn around. Was that the man with the teeth?

JERRY: Yes, he's got - he's got the machine gun. 

MORGAN: (OFF) We don't want any funny business about alarm bells, see? One of 
the boys has already gone behind to take up the collection. Now, just stay 
where you are; that's all you gotta do. 

MANAGER: (OFF) You can't get away with this!

MORGAN: (OFF) Oh, look boys, here's a guy at the front with a nice mahogany 
desk, and a plate with his name on it, who says we can't get away with it. 

1ST GANGSTER: (OFF, WORRIED) Hey, "Shark,"--

2ND GANGSTER: (OFF) Don't do it, "Shark"! 

1ST GANGSTER: (OFF) --that wasn't in our orders! Don't--!

MORGAN: (OFF) So we can't get away with it, huh?

SOUND: BURST OF MACHINE GUN FIRE

JERRY: (HORRIFIED, TO DOROTHY) He's crazy!

MORGAN: (OFF) Did I hear somebody else talkin'? 

DOROTHY: (GASPS) Jerry! 

MORGAN: (CLOSER) I thought I heard somebody over here-- (SEES JERRY) Oh, it's 
you, kid. 

JERRY: (LOW, INTENSE) Move to one side of the window, Dolly. Move to one side 
of the window! 

MORGAN: Don't worry, kid, I ain't gonna hurt you. 

JERRY: (CONFUSED) No?

MORGAN: Not a bit of it. Thanks for helpin' us. You'll get your cut later. 

JERRY: What do you mean, "my cut"? 

MORGAN: Just what I said. You'll get your share when we divvy up. 

JERRY: (PROTESTS) I don't know anything about this robbery! 

MORGAN: (MOVING OFF) It's all right, kid; we'll take care of ya.

JERRY: I tell you, I don't know anything about this robbery! 

DOROTHY: (ALARMED) Jerry!

MUSIC: BRIDGE ... FOR A TRANSITION OUT OF THE FLASHBACK

SOUND: CLICK OF CUE STICK AND BILLIARD BALLS

ROUTH: (CALMLY) Now, six ball in the end pocket. 

SOUND: A BILLIARD SHOT

ROUTH: (PLEASED) Ah! Got it.

DOROTHY: Are you listening, Mr. Routh?

ROUTH: Well, this "Shark" Morgan must have been quite a fool, I grant you 
that. 

DOROTHY: He <u>was</u> a fool. He must have been crazy. But they've held Jerry at 
police headquarters just the same.

ROUTH: Well, that's very unfortunate, if he's innocent. 

DOROTHY: You <u>know</u> he's innocent!

ROUTH: I'm afraid I don't know anything about it. 

DOROTHY: Don't you even know what happened today? Haven't you read the 
newspapers? 

ROUTH: No.

DOROTHY: The police trapped that whole gang in a Long Island farmhouse. There 
was a gunfight.

ROUTH: Oh, is that so? Oh, no casualties, I hope.

DOROTHY: You <u>hope</u>?!

ROUTH: I must tell you again, Dorothy, don't - don't be emotional. I detest 
emotion.

DOROTHY: The whole gang were killed. Every last one of them, including "Shark" 
Morgan. So there's nobody to talk, nobody to tell. But--

ROUTH: But, er-- As you were saying?

DOROTHY: They didn't find the money.

ROUTH: What money?

DOROTHY: The stolen money. 

ROUTH: Oh.

DOROTHY: Eighty-eight thousand dollars taken from that bank, and yet the 
police can't find a cent of it! Shall I tell you why, Mr. Routh? Because it 
was passed on to somebody else for safe keeping.

ROUTH: Oh, passed on to somebody else, eh? 

DOROTHY: That's what I said.

ROUTH: (CHUCKLES)

SOUND: A BILLIARD SHOT

ROUTH: Well, perhaps your friend Jerry Wynton could tell us where it is.

DOROTHY: That's what the police think. Can you imagine what he's going through 
tonight?

ROUTH: It's not a pleasant way to spend New Year's Eve, I admit. 

SOUND: A BILLIARD SHOT

ROUTH: Excuse me. But, after all, the late "Shark" Morgan <u>did</u> accuse Wynton. 
Now, if he isn't guilty, why should Morgan accuse him?

DOROTHY: Meanness.

ROUTH: (CHUCKLES) I - I don't think I understand.

DOROTHY: Meanness. The sort of meanness that some people call a sense of 
humor. Morgan saw Jerry in this house.

ROUTH: Oh, be careful, young lady; that's an actionable statement.

DOROTHY: I've already made it to the police, thanks. 

ROUTH: Oh, and did they believe you?

DOROTHY: No.

ROUTH: They're a very intelligent crowd down at Centre Street. And, after all, 
your story isn't very credible.

DOROTHY: Why not?

ROUTH: Well, "Shark" Morgan sees your friend Wynton -- sees him for perhaps 
ten seconds coming out of this house -- and then accuses him of complicity in 
a bank robbery. Now, is that very likely?

DOROTHY: Yes. Very likely. If somebody put him up to it.

ROUTH: (CHUCKLES) Again, I don't understand you.

DOROTHY: Somebody deliberately told Morgan to accuse Jerry and get him into as 
much trouble as possible. Tell me, Mr. Routh, why do you dislike Jerry so 
much? 

ROUTH: You know, now that you mention that fellow, I <u>can</u> recall who he is.

DOROTHY: Thanks for condescending to.

ROUTH: Yes, yes, indeed! Why, he was the man in our class voted most likely to 
succeed! (CHUCKLES) Now, let's see, where did you say he is tonight?

DOROTHY: He's just where you put him!

ROUTH: You know, you're trying my patience to the very limit, young woman.

DOROTHY: And out in a Long Island farmhouse there are five bodies full of 
bullet holes! Five men who will never speak again. And somewhere else -- 
(POINTEDLY) maybe not very far from here -- is the man who engineered the 
whole robbery. Planned it and staged it and got his accomplices killed. 

ROUTH: My goodness! He must have supernatural powers.

DOROTHY: No witnesses. Nobody to testify. Oh, if I could only find the money!

ROUTH: Eighty-eight thousand dollars, I think you said?

DOROTHY: If I could only find the money and prove who had done it and prove 
Jerry innocent and, just for one second, get past that devilish smug mask of 
yours that's driving me-- (SEES SOMETHING, STOPS SHORT)

ROUTH: (BEAT) Anything wrong, Dorothy?

DOROTHY: (TRIES TO PLAY IT COOL) No. No, nothing at all.

ROUTH: You've been following me 'round and 'round this table. (QUIETLY) Have 
you been looking at something?

DOROTHY: (FORCED LIGHTNESS) Only admiring your billiard room, that's all. 

ROUTH: (REALIZES SHE'S SEEN THE MONEY) Oh. You haven't been looking at--? At 
the suitcase, for instance?

DOROTHY: Oh, the - suitcase?

ROUTH: Over on the bench, under the cue rack. The suitcase that contains - 
legal papers.

DOROTHY: I hadn't even noticed it. Mr. Routh? 

ROUTH: Yes, Dorothy?

DOROTHY: I'm afraid I've taken up a lot of your time and not done myself any 
good, and made something of a spectacle of myself.

ROUTH: (CHUCKLES) Frankly, young woman, you have.

SOUND: A BILLIARD SHOT

DOROTHY: Well, if you won't help me, you won't -- and that's that. If you 
don't mind, I'd like to go now.

ROUTH: (HINT OF A THREAT) Suppose, my dear, I didn't choose to let you go.

DOROTHY: (NERVOUS) But why - why shouldn't you? What harm can I do? I--

ROUTH: Now, who was it, who was it? Was it--? Was it Meredith who remarked 
that "the last thing to be civilized by man - will be woman"? I think it was, 
yes. And, you know, [...] and a slanderous woman can do a great deal of harm.

DOROTHY: But I - I haven't done you any harm - so far.

ROUTH: We're all alone in this house. There's not even a servant here. Now, if 
I chose to get between you and the door -- like this--

DOROTHY: (TENSE) Keep away from me!

ROUTH: Oh, I'm not coming near you, Dorothy. I'm merely standing between you 
and the door. Now, I suppose you realize that I could turn very nasty if I 
liked.

DOROTHY: What are you going to do?

ROUTH: Do? Why, I'm going to open the door for you, like this--

SOUND: DOOR OPENS

ROUTH: (PLEASANT) I'm going to say, "God bless you, my child," as befits a New 
Year's greeting. I'm going to show you out. And wish you goodnight.

DOROTHY: (STAMMERS WITH SURPRISE) You don't mind?

ROUTH: (AMUSED) Mind? Certainly not.

DOROTHY: (SUDDENLY HARD) You've got something to hide, haven't you, Mr. Routh?

ROUTH: (QUIET TRIUMPH) No, no. Nothing, young woman, that I can't hide. 
Goodnight.

SOUND: DOOR CLOSES

MUSIC: BRIDGE

SOUND: ROTARY DIAL ... PHONE RINGS AND IS ANSWERED (CALLER'S PERSPECTIVE) ... 
DOROTHY SPEAKS LOW SO AS NOT TO BE OVERHEARD BY ROUTH IN THE NEARBY BILLIARD 
ROOM

DOROTHY: Operator?

OPERATOR: (FILTER) What number are you calling, please?

DOROTHY: Operator, I want to get to police headquarters in New York City. No, 
no, no, no, that - that'll take too long. Wait-wait-- Er, uh-- get me the 
local police station. This is Mallingford Eight-- Eight-Nine-One.

OPERATOR: (FILTER) The local police station? 

DOROTHY: Yes. Yes, that's right.

OPERATOR: (FILTER) The number you want is Mallingford Three-Two-Six. I will 
ring them.

DOROTHY: Thank you. Hurry.

SOUND: PHONE RINGS (CALLER'S PERSPECTIVE) ... THEN BEHIND--

DOROTHY: (TO HERSELF) Oh, why is he so confident? What has he got up his 
sleeve? 

SOUND: PHONE IS ANSWERED (CALLER'S PERSPECTIVE) ... CHIEF'S VOICE ON FILTER

CHIEF: Mallingford police station.

DOROTHY: Oh! Um, let me speak to the chief of police, please.

CHIEF: (WITH A YAWN) You're speaking to him, ma'am. Nobody else'd stay up here 
on New Year's Eve.

DOROTHY: My - my name is Dale; Miss Dorothy Dale. I-I-I'm speaking from 
Greenacres, Mr. Derrick Routh's house, about two miles up the Post Road. Do 
you know it?

CHIEF: Yes, I know it. But can't you talk louder? I can hardly hear you.

DOROTHY: I - I don't dare talk louder. I'm speaking from a phone just outside 
the billiard room door. 

CHIEF: Well, what about it?

DOROTHY: Listen. You want to recover the City and Provincial Bank money, don't 
you?

CHIEF: We sure do, miss; that money's hot, but--

DOROTHY: Well, it's here. It's in this house. In this billiard room. Now. 

CHIEF: Oh. Who's got it? 

DOROTHY: Derrick Routh himself. 

CHIEF: (BEAT) Look, miss, is this on the level?

DOROTHY: I swear it's true. I've seen the money. 

CHIEF: The Rouths are prominent people, you know. 

DOROTHY: I can't help that. There's a big suitcase completely full of money in 
packages fastened with the paper label of the City and Provincial Bank and 
that's not his own bank. 

CHIEF: Take it easy, now.

DOROTHY: The lid of the suitcase wasn't quite closed. He thought he'd be alone 
here tonight and that's why he was careless. 

CHIEF: Does he know you saw the money?

DOROTHY: Did I see the money? I-I-I'm not quite sure. 

CHIEF: You're not sure?

DOROTHY: No. I could almost have sworn he knew I saw the money, but - but he-
he didn't seem to care. He--

SOUND: DOOR OPENS, OFF

DOROTHY: (WHISPERS) Be careful! The billiard room door's opening.

ROUTH: (APPROACHES) I thought I heard someone using the telephone out here. 

DOROTHY: Excuse me, Mr. Routh, I - I only, um--

CHIEF: What's this about the door opening? 

ROUTH: These doors are rather thick, Dorothy, but I <u>was</u> under the impression 
that I heard somebody say "police." 

DOROTHY: Yes. (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) Well, uh, yes, you did!

ROUTH: (CHUCKLES, LIGHTLY) You weren't phoning the police by any chance, were 
you?

DOROTHY: Yes, I - I was.

ROUTH: But why? 

DOROTHY: I, um--

ROUTH: Go on. Go on. Go on. Why?

DOROTHY: As a matter of fact, I was trying to get in touch with Jerry. That's 
it. He's at police headquarters in New York, and I was trying get in touch 
with him to see if they'd let me talk to him on New Year's Eve, you know; I - 
I thought it would cheer him up.

CHIEF: Look, miss. This is the Mallingford Chief of Police. Are you still 
there? 

ROUTH: What's that? Mallingford?

DOROTHY: Well, it's a New York call relayed through the local station. You - 
you don't mind?

ROUTH: Not at all. Please go right ahead. (BEAT, SLIGHTLY OFF) Oh, by the 
way--

DOROTHY: What?

ROUTH: (OFF) I don't think you'll find that money, young woman. Goodnight.

SOUND: DOOR CLOSES

CHIEF: Listen, miss, are you still on the end of the wire, or aren't you?

DOROTHY: Yes, but I couldn't talk to you. <u>He</u> was here. 

CHIEF: Who was there?

DOROTHY: Derrick Routh. He said I'd never find the money. 

CHIEF: You mean he admits he's got it? 

DOROTHY: Well, no. He just smiles and smiles. He's got some trick up his 
sleeve, I know it!

CHIEF: It'll have to be a good one.

DOROTHY: Please, never mind that. Can you come over -- now?

CHIEF: Well-- All right, miss, I'll - I'll take a chance. Who else is in the 
house with you?

DOROTHY: Nobody, I'm all alone with him.

CHIEF: What're you gonna do if he tries to light out with the money?

DOROTHY: I don't see what I <u>can</u> do. That's all the more reason for you to get 
here quickly. I swear you'll find the money in that billiard room, only <u>hurry</u>!

MUSIC: BRIDGE ... THEN BEHIND NARRATOR--

NARRATOR: (SLOWLY) Five minutes. Ten minutes. Fifteen minutes. It can seem a 
very long time to a waiting girl crouching in a cold and dim-lit hallway [X] 
outside a closed door, hearing only the clicking of billiard balls and 
watching, wondering, and praying, until--

SOUND: STEADY CLICK OF BILLIARD BALLS, DURING ABOVE, STARTING AT [X] ... 
CONTINUES IN BG ... THEN CHIEF'S FOOTSTEPS APPROACH

CHIEF: (HUSHED) Miss Dale? Miss Dale?

DOROTHY: This way! Shhhh!

SOUND: CHIEF'S STEPS TO DOROTHY

CHIEF: Miss Dale, I'm Joe Hollister, Chief of Police. 

DOROTHY: Yes, I recognized your voice.

CHIEF: The front door wasn't locked, so I just walked in.

DOROTHY: I hoped you would. I didn't want to leave here.

CHIEF: Has Mr. Routh come out of that room since you talked to me?

DOROTHY: No. 

CHIEF: Then, according to what you claim, he's still in there with a suitcase 
full of money. 

DOROTHY: That's right, Mr. Hollister.

CHIEF: Now look, miss, before we go any further, there's something I ought to 
tell you. 

DOROTHY: Well? 

CHIEF: Well, I - I checked with New York about you. 

DOROTHY: And - and what did they say?

SOUND: DOOR OPENS

ROUTH: (APPROACHES) Yes, Mr. Hollister, and what did they say about her?

DOROTHY: Mr. Routh! 

ROUTH: I'm rather interested in knowing that myself. 

DOROTHY: So you could hear everything through that door!

ROUTH: Of course I could hear everything through the door. Including your 
conversation with our friend the chief of police! (POLITE) Good evening, Mr. 
Hollister.

CHIEF: Evening, Mr. Routh. This young lady says that, er--

ROUTH: I know, I know what she says. Will you come into the billiard room, 
please -- both of you?

CHIEF: (WHY NOT?) Oh--

ROUTH: Thank you. 

SOUND: THEY ENTER THE BILLIARD ROOM ... DOOR CLOSES

DOROTHY: (ACCUSING) Just what trick are you up to now?

ROUTH: (ANGRY) Trick? You talk of tricks! 

CHIEF: Now, just a minute, now. Take it easy. What I want to know is: where's 
this suitcase Miss Dale was talking about?

DOROTHY: There it is.

ROUTH: What? You mean that empty suitcase on the bench beside you? 

DOROTHY: <u>Empty</u> suitcase?!

ROUTH: Yes, that's what I said.

DOROTHY: It wasn't empty when I left this room!

ROUTH: Chief, do you mind seeing for yourself?

SOUND: SUITCASE OPENED

CHIEF: Well, it's empty now, miss. 

ROUTH: Hollister, it would gratify me to clear this matter up here and now.

CHIEF: It'd gratify me, too. 

ROUTH: I'm tired of this slanderous nonsense and I mean to end it. This young 
woman told you that I had -- what was it? -- some eighty-eight thousand 
dollars in this room only a few minutes ago.

DOROTHY: I still say you had.

ROUTH: Curb your temper, please, while I ask you some straight questions. Can 
you do that?

CHIEF: You better answer him, miss.

DOROTHY: All right. I'll try. (SHE GROWS INCREASINGLY DISTRESSED DURING 
FOLLOWING--)

ROUTH: Did I or did I not leave the billiard room at any time?

DOROTHY: No, you didn't.

ROUTH: Good. Now, there's only one door -- and no window. Only a skylight 
covered with snow. So I didn't leave that way, did I? 

DOROTHY: No, I suppose you didn't. 

ROUTH: Well, therefore, unless you're lying, the money must still be in this 
room.

DOROTHY: Yes.

ROUTH: Then where is it?

DOROTHY: I don't know! You must have hidden it some place.

ROUTH: (CHUCKLES) Where? 

CHIEF: I'm afraid Mr. Routh's right, miss.

ROUTH: Take a look around you. One pool table; comes apart so you can examine 
it. One radio; go on, examine that, too. One overhead light. One standing 
lamp. One bare bench. One rack of cues. One rack of pool balls. Now, that's 
everything. Now, can you tell me where I could hide enough money to fill a 
suitcase?

DOROTHY: No, I can't!

CHIEF: (CONVINCED) It's impossible, miss. The stuff's not here.

DOROTHY: It <u>must</u> be here! It's either here or else--

ROUTH: Or else what? 

DOROTHY: Or else it vanished.

ROUTH: Oh, Mr. Hollister, haven't we had quite enough of this?

CHIEF: Yes, I guess we have. Now look here, Miss Dale, I liked the way you 
talked and I thought you were talking straight. Will you just tell me why you 
tried to string me along like that?

ROUTH: You know, I think <u>I</u> can tell you, Chief Hollister.

CHIEF: I wasn't exactly asking you, Mr. Routh, but-- Well, go ahead.

ROUTH: You know, perhaps, that she's engaged to a man who's mixed up in the 
City and Provincial robbery. 

DOROTHY: He was not!

ROUTH: It was neither a very clever nor a very far-sighted attempt. I'm 
inclined to think that she will not have a job when my aunt returns. But, as I 
say, it was a case of any old attempt to shield Jerry Wynton.

SOUND: DOOR OPENS

JERRY: Did somebody mention my name?

DOROTHY: (RELIEVED, ASTONISHED, LOVINGLY) Jerry! Oh, Jerry!

JERRY: (REASSURING) There, darling; steady. I'm alive, I'm not a ghost. You 
needn't dive at me like that. 

DOROTHY: But how did you get here? How did you get away?

CHIEF: I was trying to tell you, miss, when our host butted in. The D. A. is 
convinced your young man had nothing to do with this. 

JERRY: That's right, Dolly. And I thought I'd better come out and take you 
back to New York with me.

DOROTHY: (ALMOST TEARFUL) I was never so glad to see anybody in my life! Put 
your arms around me.

JERRY: (SOOTHING) My darling.

ROUTH: I don't suppose you'd mind if I picked up this cue and went on 
practicing? (CHUCKLES, MOVES OFF) Let's try the eight ball all the way down 
the table.

SOUND: METHODICAL BILLIARD SHOTS, IN BG

JERRY: Come on, Dolly, it'll be New Year's in a few minutes. There's nothing 
to worry about. 

DOROTHY: There is something to worry about. He's got the money, the whole 
eighty-eight thousand. I know it; I'm sure of it. Only we can't find it. It's 
hidden somewhere in this room. 

ROUTH: As I said before, haven't we had just about enough of this?

DOROTHY: The chief of police there won't believe me, but it's true.

JERRY: I've heard a lot about that money myself.

CHIEF: (CHUCKLES) I'll bet you have, son!

JERRY: It's been nothing but "hot money, hot money, hot money" and "Where is 
it? Where is it? Where is it?" -- until I thought I was going off my nut. If I 
could prove Derrick Routh had anything to do with this, I'd-- Dolly, what's 
the matter?

DOROTHY: (LOW, INTENSE) Mr. Hollister?

CHIEF: Yes, miss? 

DOROTHY: I think I know now where he's hidden the money.

SOUND: BAD BILLIARD SHOT .. CUE BALL HOPS THE TABLE AND HITS THE FLOOR WITH A 
LOUD CRASH

CHIEF: (SUSPICIOUS AGAIN) Well, that was a bad shot, Mr. Routh. You've made 
the white ball jump clear off the table. 

ROUTH: (CHUCKLES, FORCED LIGHTNESS) Well, there are plenty of others <u>on</u> the 
table.

DOROTHY: I tell you, I know where he's hidden it.

CHIEF: Is it in this room?

DOROTHY: Yes.

CHIEF: But where? In the pool table? In the radio? In some secret panel?

DOROTHY: No. 

JERRY: You'd better speak up, Dolly. 

DOROTHY: Has it ever struck you -- any of you -- that there <u>is</u> such a 
thing as an invisible piece of furniture? 

CHIEF: An invisible piece of furniture? You mean we can't see it?

DOROTHY: No, it's in plain sight. It's smack in front of your eyes. But nobody 
ever sees it. You can't see it now. 

JERRY: <u>We</u> may not understand you, Dolly, but, by George, Derrick Routh <u>does</u>! 
Look at his face!

CHIEF: (AGREES) Yes. I'm looking at it.

ROUTH: (TENSE) What's the matter with all of you?

DOROTHY: (MOCKING) Please don't become emotional, Mr. Routh. I detest emotion. 

CHIEF: Miss, there's a reward of ten thousand for the recovery of that money. 
If you know where it is, tell us. 

DOROTHY: There's nothing easier. It's--

ROUTH: (INTERRUPTS) Before that young woman says something she may regret, 
please listen to me. 

JERRY: You've got him, Dolly. I don't know how or why, but you've got him!

CHIEF: Go on, Mr. Routh.

ROUTH: Tell me, Wynton, you and I used to play on the same baseball team, 
didn't we? 

JERRY: That's right. What about it? 

ROUTH: What did I play on that team?

JERRY: You were the pitcher. Why?

ROUTH: Was I good?

JERRY: You had the best control and the best fast one I ever-- Wait a minute. 
Why are you picking up that pool ball?

CHIEF: (WARY) What're you going to do? Take it easy, Mr. Routh.

ROUTH: You three are across the room from me. I have a number of rather 
dangerous objects on the table here, and I'll split that girl's skull if she 
says another word! 

DOROTHY: (GASPS)

JERRY: Don't be a blasted fool!

ROUTH: Think I can't do it?

SOUND: WHACK! AS PITCHED BALL HITS CHIEF'S HAND 

CHIEF: (EXCLAIMS AND GROANS IN PAIN)

SOUND: CLATTER OF BALL AND CHIEF'S GUN DROPPING TO FLOOR

ROUTH: Well, does that convince you I haven't lost my pitching arm? You didn't 
even get a chance to raise that gun.

CHIEF: (EXCLAIMS AND GROANS IN PAIN)

SOUND: CLATTER OF BALL DROPPING TO FLOOR AND ROLLING AWAY

ROUTH: No, you don't! Don't try pick it up! Just let it lie there on the 
floor.

JERRY: Get behind me, Dolly.

ROUTH: You stay where you are! You step off first base and--

CHIEF: Maybe you'd better listen to him, Miss Dale. (EXHALES) Well, what're 
you gonna do, Routh? You can't keep us here forever. 

ROUTH: I don't propose to keep you there forever; I'm not so enamored of your 
company. 

CHIEF: Then what's the game?

ROUTH: Well, I'll make a bargain with you. 

CHIEF: Well?

ROUTH: My car's outside, with a little more gas than the state allows. Give me 
one clear hour to get away. Well, what do you say?

CHIEF: I'm a cop, Mr. Routh. I can't make any bargains with you. 

ROUTH: No? 

CHIEF: No, and I'm comin' over there after ya. 

ROUTH: Then you'll compel me to start throwing.

JERRY: Down, Dolly, down under the table.

SOUND: PITCHED BALL MISSES, HITS WALL; THEN FLOOR, ROLLING AWAY

CHIEF: Ah, you missed that one, Mr. Routh!

ROUTH: (WITH EFFORT) I'll not miss with this one.

SOUND: PITCHED BALL MISSES ... HITS CUE RACK; CUE STICKS FALL NOISILY TO FLOOR

CHIEF: Heh! It's a shame to bust that cue rack, Mr. Routh, but I'm still 
coming for ya!

JERRY: You've lost your control, old son. You're done for.

ROUTH: Am I? (WITH EFFORT) Try this!

SOUND: PITCHED BALL MISSES ... HITS METAL RADIATOR, WHICH FALLS TO FLOOR ... 
MORE PITCHED BALLS MISS, IN BG (GLASS BREAKS, THINGS FALL, ET CETERA), DURING 
FOLLOWING--

CHIEF: That was the wildest pitch yet. 

JERRY: Dolly, look! Don't get up, but look!

DOROTHY: What is it?

JERRY: The radiator, the steam radiator. He's got the whole thing sideways. 
Did you ever see that happen to a radiator before?

DOROTHY: Of course not, because it's a dummy radiator.

JERRY: A dummy radiator? 

SOUND: CHIEF GRABS ROUTH ... SCUFFLE DURING FOLLOWING--

CHIEF: (WITH EFFORT) See? I got you, Routh. I'm not too old to handle a prig 
like you!

ROUTH: You haven't even got a search warrant. 

CHIEF: I'll take a chance!

SOUND: CHIEF SOCKS ROUTH 

ROUTH: (GRUNTS IN PAIN)

SOUND: BODY THUD AS ROUTH HITS THE FLOOR

CHIEF: (OUT OF BREATH) What - what was that about a dummy radiator?

JERRY: Yes! Look. Look here, it's got a little oil burner inside to make it 
give out heat.

CHIEF: Yeah?

JERRY: And there are hinges at the back to form a lot of compartments where 
you can hide as much money as you like.

DOROTHY: I saw the hinges when he told me to go over to the radiator, but I 
didn't guess what they meant. It's really a safe that never attracts attention 
because nobody ever notices it.

JERRY: And the stuff's here, all right. 

DOROTHY: (RELIEVED) There, Mr. Hollister. That's what I saw in the suitcase.

CHIEF: (PLEASED) Heh! I told you there was a ten-thousand-dollar reward for 
that, miss. 

DOROTHY: (HAPPY) Ohhh, ho ho. Did you hear that? Turn on the radio, Jerry. Go 
on, turn it on. Welcome in the New Year! Didn't you tell me -- all of you -- 
that the money was hot? 

SOUND: ON RADIO, A CLOCK FINISHES CHIMING TWELVE, A REVELING CROWD ROARS, 
AND--

MUSIC: AN ORCHESTRA PLAYS "AULD LANG SYNE" 

SOUND: FADES OUT LEAVING ONLY--

MUSIC: "AULD LANG SYNE" ... FOR A CURTAIN

NARRATOR: And so ends "Nothing Up My Sleeve," starring Elissa Landi and George 
Coulouris, tonight's story of--
