THEME: PLAYED AS CURTAIN FOR WHAT FOLLOWS.

ANNOUNCER: Woodbury's, on behalf of their Facial Powder, present this evening 
the closing episode of "Dangerous Paradise", starring Elsie Hitz and Nick 
Dawson as Gail and Dan. Woodbury's Facial Powder, you know, is a creation of 
those same skin specialists who make the famous Woodbury's Facial Soap.

This is our last evening with you, until next fall. So I hope you will 
graciously listen to the Woodbury message I wish to leave with you until we 
meet again. It's this: Summer brings special problems of the skin. In order to 
keep your complexion fresh, smooth, cool and free from shine, you need to use 
face powder <u>generously</u>. That makes your choice of the <u>right</u> powder all the 
more important. If you choose Woodbury's Facial Powder, you can use it 
lavishly without the risk of clogging up your pores and preventing your skin 
from breathing. Woodbury's is the pride of a group of expert skin scientists 
who formulate it from the purest ingredients obtainable, to achieve an 
exquisite texture that's as <u>safe</u> for the skin as it is flattering. With 
Woodbury's, every breathing pore is kept fine, free, alive and functioning 
vigorously. And by means of this powder your skin is smoothly, suavely 
finished, too. So let Woodbury's be your choice for summer wear. Once more--
and for the last time this season--Woodbury's invites you to try this powder, 
free. I will tell you later how to send for six trial packets, one of each of 
the six alluring shades.

ANNOUNCER: And now, as we pay our final visit to "Dangerous Paradise", in the 
South Seas, we find a vital question still unanswered. The happiness of Gail 
and Dan hangs in the balance as Dan remains silent, and as Gail's lips are 
sealed by her adherence to the code that a girl should wait for a man to speak 
the first words of love.

Duke Weyman, you'll remember, attempted to escape in the plane from which Dan 
had removed the gas. The engine went dead, and Weyman, with one last heroic 
gesture, put the plane into a dive and so ended his criminal career.

Gail and Dan are on the beach, awaiting the plane that will carry them away 
from Horseshoe Island.

DAN: Well, Gail. It won't be long now.

GAIL: What? What did you say?

DAN: It wasn't important. Never mind. You've been sitting there, staring off 
into space, saying nothing for so long, I--I thought it was time one of us 
said something.

GAIL: I'm sorry, Dan. I was--thinking.

DAN: It must have been about something serious.

GAIL: No. It was funny.

DAN: I didn't see you laughing about it.

GAIL: The laugh was in my sleeve.

DAN: Say listen, Gail. You've got something on your mind. You're blue, and--
and almost bitter. That isn't like you.

GAIL: I'm not exactly happy, Dan.

DAN: Why don't you tell me what's bothering you, Gail?

GAIL: Do you want me to tell you?

DAN: Yes. I thought we were--pretty good friends.

GAIL: I can't tell you, Dan. There's a law against it. You'll have to tell me.

DAN: There you go--talking in riddles again. Before I get marooned on a South 
Seas island with you again, I'm going to study up on charades and jig-saw 
puzzles so I'll know how to talk to you.

GAIL: Am I so hard to understand?

DAN: Honest, Gail. Half the time I need an interpreter to tell me what you 
mean by what you say.

GAIL: Oh, forget it, Dan. Maybe when we get away from this place we'll be more 
normal. Perhaps I'll be less puzzling to you and you'll be more alert, 
mentally.

DAN: Maybe I'm dumb, but----

GAIL: That's right, Dan.

DAN: All right. Let it go at that. As soon as the plane gets here, you can say 
"goodbye" to Horseshoe Island.

GAIL: Yes?

DAN: And then in a few hours you can say "Goodbye" to me--and----

GAIL: And--what?

DAN: That's all.

GAIL: Oh, is it?

DAN: Yeah.

GAIL: But--I don't want to say "Goodbye".

DAN: I thought you were sick of this place.

GAIL: That isn't what I meant.

DAN: What did you mean?

GAIL: What do <u>you</u> think, Dan?

DAN: I should think you'd be darned glad to get away. You haven't been happy 
here.

GAIL: I--could have been.

DAN: You'll feel better when you get back to the States.

GAIL: Why?

DAN: Oh--you'll forget about Weyman after a while. It'll take a little time--
but----

GAIL: What in the world are you talking about?

DAN: Weyman. I know how you feel. It'll hurt for a while--but it's like having 
a tooth pulled. Sooner or later it gets better, and then you'll forget how it 
hurt.

GAIL: How do you know?

DAN: I--I had a tooth pulled once, you know.

GAIL: And you never got over it, did you?

DAN: You'll go back to your work. The newspapers will make a big fuss over 
you. Lost girl--found on South Seas Island--and all that sort of thing. You'll 
be famous. And then--you'll forget what a tough break you had. See?

GAIL: You've got my life all planned out for me, haven't you?

DAN: No. I'm not doing anything like that. I--I'm just trying to say something 
that'll make you feel better, that's all.

GAIL: You're sweet, Dan. But where do you get the idea that I'm all broken-
hearted about Duke?

DAN: Why--it's easy enough to see that.

GAIL: Dan. Have you forgotten that I told you I did not love Duke Weyman?

DAN: I know that's what you said. But you were just trying to sell yourself 
the idea because you realized he was a--a bad egg.

GAIL: How clever you are.

DAN: Oh, you couldn't kid me about that.

GAIL: You think you know a lot about me, don't you, Dan?

DAN: Well--I know that much.

GAIL: So that's what's the matter.

DAN: Yeah.

GAIL: Dan--I can't understand how even a man could be so blind--so dumb.

DAN: Who--me?

GAIL: Yes. You. You're supposed to be smart. You are about some things. But, 
Dan--you're so thick-headed.

DAN: Say--what's the idea?

GAIL: Even dumb animals know things--instinctively. But you don't. You see 
nothing; hear nothing; say nothing.

DAN: Now, wait a minute----

GAIL: Take Snodgrass, for instance. He knows I love him. I don't have to tell 
him. He just--knows it.

DAN: Listen--Gail----

GAIL: Oh, Dan. What must I do? Shout it from the tree-tops? Write you a 
letter? Put it in the newspapers? Perhaps you'd rather I'd draw a diagram for 
you.

DAN: Say--what do you mean, Gail. Do you--

GAIL: Oh, I know it's against the rules for me to say it first, but I don't 
care about rules, any more.

DAN: Gail--let me ask you----

GAIL: You prattle to me about how I'll go back home and work and forget about 
Duke. I'm darned if I don't believe you'd sit right there and let me go--and 
never say a word to stop me--just because of some silly idea you have that I 
love him.

DAN: But I thought you did.

GAIL: You poor, dear, dumb darling. I'm trying to tell you that I love you.

DAN: You--what?

GAIL: Maybe a nice girl wouldn't tell a man she loves him. But you make me so 
darned mad, I could kill you--but I do love you, Dan.

DAN: Why--you darling. Gail, I never dared to hope that you could ever love 
me. 

GAIL: I said it. I made up my mind I wouldn't. But--I did. Oh, Dan--forget 
that I said that, will you?

DAN: Listen, you adorable little spit-fire. If I live to be a thousand I'll 
never forget it. Not a word--not even a syllable. Kiss me, Gail.

GAIL: But Dan--(PAUSE)

DAN: I may be dumb about getting an idea, but once I get it, I never let go. 
Gail, darling. You love me. I still can't seem to believe it.

GAIL: Dan. Don't hold me so tight. I can't--breathe.

DAN: Say it again. Tell me you love me. Keep on saying it over. I want to be 
sure my ears weren't playing tricks on me.

GAIL: No. I won't tell you again.

DAN: Why not?

GAIL: Because--it just isn't being done. I thumbed my nose at the conventions 
once--because I had to. But not any more.

DAN: My darling. Adorable nose. Precious thumb.

GAIL: I'm going to be a lady from now on. I'm not going to tell you again that 
I love you until you tell me whether you love me or not.

DAN: Oh! Who's dumb now? I've told you I loved you. I've told you every time 
I've looked at you.

GAIL: Even when you scowled at me, Dan?

DAN: I loved you that day I picked you up out of the water--when you were so 
scared and trying hard not to show it.

GAIL: I thought you hated me then.

DAN: I've told you I love you in every way I know.

GAIL: Except in words.

DAN: Do you remember that time you were sick, and I kissed you?

GAIL: Yes.

DAN: That wasn't an invalid-kiss.

GAIL: I know it, Dan. I remember.

DAN: And that time you came so near being killed by the natives--I showed you, 
then, that I loved you.

GAIL: Yes. That was the time you threatened to spank me.

DAN: Didn't you know then that I adored the ground you walked on?

GAIL: You have such original ways of--saying it, Dan.

DAN: I thought you knew. I tried to hide it because you were so crazy about 
Duke--but I knew I wasn't getting away with it.

GAIL: Dan. Do you realize that you haven't yet said, "I love you, Gail"?

DAN: (LAUGHING) Do you want me to shout it from the tree-tops?

GAIL: Yes, Dan. Shout it.

DAN: I love you, Gail. Do you want me to write you a letter and put it in the 
newspapers and perhaps draw a diagram for you?

GAIL: Yes, Dan, darling. Write it so I can see it with [my] eyes and hear it 
with my ears----

DAN: And feel it with your lips?

GAIL: Yes, Dan. (SHE DOES)

DAN: Now do you know that I love you?

GAIL: Yes. I think, after all, actions speak louder than words.

DAN: My darling. I've dreamed about this moment for so long, I'm almost afraid 
I'll wake up--and find it's all a mistake.

GAIL: Kiss me again, Dan. If we don't wake up, then we'll know it's real--not 
a dream.

DAN: (AFTER THE KISS) Yes, Gail. It's real.

GAIL: I'm sure of it now. Dan--how long will it take for the plane to get to 
Sydney?

DAN: A few hours.

GAIL: Well, as soon as we get there, I'll cable my editor for some money. I'll 
get some clothes--and--well----

DAN: What is it, Gail?

GAIL: I'll get some clothes for Daisy, too--and----

DAN: That's right. I'd forgotten about Daisy.

GAIL: She can be my bridesmaid--and----

DAN: Now--Gail, darling. We've got to be sensible about this. I haven't got 
any money. I'm just a policeman. Perhaps we'd better wait.

GAIL: Daisy will love to be my bridesmaid.

DAN: I can't support a wife, yet.

GAIL: How long do we have to wait after we get the license? I don't know the 
Australian marriage laws--do you, Dan?

DAN: We'd be poor, Gail.

GAIL: I want a white dress. No veil. Just a quiet wedding.

DAN: After a while, there'll be some money coming from my father's estate. 
Then we can be married, and----

GAIL: I wish I knew what kind of clothes they're wearing now.

DAN: Then, we can--even have a church wedding--if you want one.

GAIL: It'll seem funny getting a trousseau when I don't even know whether 
skirts are long or short, or anything.

DAN: Gail. Aren't you listening to me?

GAIL: No. I haven't heard a word you've been saying.

DAN: Darling. Listen, then. We've got to use our heads----

GAIL: Dan. I love you.

DAN: There isn't anything in the world I want so much as I do--you. But----

GAIL: I love you, Dan.

DAN: I can't let you tie yourself down to a man like me who hasn't anything. 
No home--no money--or----

GAIL: I love you.

DAN: We'll have to--wait--because--well, I don't see how we can----

GAIL: I love you.

DAN: I can't let you--be poor----

GAIL: I love you, Dan.

DAN: Gail--let me try to be sensible, will you?

GAIL: I do love you, Dan.

DAN: I give in, Gail. I guess that's all that really counts, anyway.

(SOUND OF PLANE IN THE DISTANCE)

GAIL: There's our plane.

DAN: That's right. Let's go.

(PLANE COMES IN STRONG--BLENDING WITH MUSIC)

[HAVRILLA]: The supporting cast of "Dangerous Paradise" included Helen Choate 
as Daisy, Frank Knight as Duke Weyman, Allan Joslyn as Pango, William Shelley 
as Hawkins, Allan Deavitt as Nanao. The story was written by Carl Bixby. The 
program was directed by Frank Readick.

Would you like to hear Elsie Hitz and Nick Dawson as they step out of 
character for a moment? Elsie, will you say a word?

ELSIE: (OFF) Thank you, Alois. (IN) There's something about the glamour of the 
South Seas that gets in your blood after a while. At least, I've found it so. 
In fact, I'm going on a vacation--and where do you suppose I'm going? That's 
right! I'm going to the tropics--to live for a little while in the atmosphere 
in which I've played for the last six months, as Gail, in Dangerous Paradise. 
Unless I decide to go native, I'll be with you again before very long--Until 
then, Goodbye.

HAVRILLA: And now, Nick Dawson--Nick, will you take the mike?

NICK: (OFF) Thanks, Alois.

(IN) If you've enjoyed "Dangerous Paradise" half as much as we have enjoyed 
playing it, you will understand with what regret we bring it to a close.

We thank you for your generous support and appreciation and we thank the 
makers of Woodbury's Facial Powder who have made this series possible.

It's vacation time for us now but be assured that we'll return to the air with 
a new show--So, until then, good night.

You are to deliver a complete production including yourself and Elsie Hitz as 
featured players--satisfactory dramatizations, a satisfactory cast whenever 
extra players are required, and an instrumental quartet for whatever 
incidental music may be necessary.

It is understood and agreed that this contract is for the exclusive services 
of Elsie Hitz and Nick Dawson and that neither Miss Hitz nor Mr. Dawson will 
appear in any other broadcast, live or transcription, under their own or 
assumed names during the term of this agreement.

All scripts are to be submitted to Lennen & Mitchell, Inc., for approval and 
at least two weeks in advance of each broadcast.

You agree to have an adequate number of rehearsals to insure a perfect 
performance and will present a full dress rehearsal for Lennen & Mitchell, 
Inc., on the day of each broadcast.

It is our understanding that the total cost of the "Dangerous Paradise" 
production will not exceed $2,407.00 weekly for the first 13 weeks beginning 
July 1, 1935, as per the following itemized schedule.

Cost per week for three performances:

Elsie Hitz               $660

You agree to hold Lennen & Mitchell, Inc., free and clear of any and all

We are to have an option to renew this contract for subsequent periods under 
the same terms and conditions set forth herein, except that the cost of the 
services of Miss Hitz and Mr. Dawson will be as follows:

1. For the second 13 weeks beginning September 30, 1935, it is agreed that the 
cost will be $1,000.00 per week each, with a bonus for this period of $200.00 
per week each, if there is no further renewal. We will notify you of our 
intentions on this point by November 1, 1935. If, however, we elect to 
contract for 26 weeks beginning September 30, 1935, the cost is to be 
$1,000.00 per week each.

weeks beginning December 30, 1935, the cost will be $1,200.00 per week each.

3. If renewed for 26 weeks beginning December 30, 1935, the cost is to be 
$1,000.00 per week each with two further 26 week renewals at the same figure 
or four 13 week renewals at $1,200.00 per week each.

It is understood and agreed that beginning September 30, 1935 we will pay you 
an additional sum of $120.00 per week which is to be considered a service 
charge for extra expenses which you may incur in connection with this program.

This letter with your signature on it will serve as a contract between us.

Very truly yours,

MARION PARSONET
LENNEN & MITCHELL, INC.
