FADE IN: LONG SHOT — REVOLVING GLOBE A revolving globe. When it stops revolving it turns briefly into a contour map
                of Europe, then into a flat map. Superimposed over this map are scenes of refugees
                fleeing from all sections of Europe by foot, wagon, auto, and boat, and all
                converging upon one point on the tip of Africa -- Casablanca. Arrows on the map
                illustrate the routes taken as the voice of a NARRATOR describes the
                migration.CUT TO:EXT. OLD MOORISH SECTION OF THE CITY - DAY At first only the turrets and
                rooftops are visible against a torrid sky. The facades of the Moorish buildings give
                way to a narrow, twisting street crowded with the polyglot life of a native quarter.
                The intense desert sun holds the scene in a torpid tranquility. Activity is
                unhurried and sounds are muted.CUT TO:INT. POLICE STATION - DAY A POLICE OFFICER takes a piece of paper from the
                typewriter, turns to a microphone, and reads.CUT TO:EXT. A STREET IN THE OLD MOORISH SECTION - DAY An officer BLOWS his whistle
                several times. There is pandemonium as native guards begin to round up people. A
                police car, full of officers, with SIREN BLARING, screams through the street and
                stops in the market. Some try to escape but are caught by the police and loaded into
                a police wagon. At a street corner TWO POLICEMEN stop a white CIVILIAN and question
                him. CUT TO:EXT. PALAIS DE JUSTICE - DAY We see an inscription carved in a marble block
                along the roofline of the building: "Liberte, Egalite, Fraternite" We see the the
                facade, French in architecture, then the high-vaulted entrance which is inscribed
                "Palais de Justice". At the entrance the arrested suspects are led in by the police.
            CUT TO:EXT. SIDEWALK CAFE - DAY A middle-aged ENGLISH COUPLE sit at a table just off
                the square, and observe the commotion across the way in front of the Palais de
                Justice. The police van pulls up. The rear doors are opened and people stream out. A
                EUROPEAN man, sitting at a table nearby, watches the English couple more closely
                than the scene on the street. CUT TO:EXT. PALAIS DE JUSTICE - DAY Suspects are herded out of the van, and into the
                Palais de Justice. CUT TO:CUT TO:EXT. OVERHEAD SHOT - DAY An airplane cuts its motor for landing. CUT TO:EXT. PALAIS DE JUSTICE - DAY Refugees wait in line outside the Palais de
                Justice. Their upturned gaze follows the flight of the plane. In their faces is
                revealed one hope they all have in common, and the plane is the symbol of that hope.
                Jan and Annina look up at the plane. CUT TO:EXT. OVERHEAD SHOT - DAY The plane SWOOPS down past a sign atop a building at
                the edge of the airport. The sign reads "Rick's Cafe Americain." CUT TO:EXT. AIRFIELD - DAY As the plane lands a swastika on its tail is clearly
                visible. It taxis to a stop as a group of officers march into formation in front of
                it. Behind them stand a detail of native soldiers keeping guard. In the group is
                CAPTAIN LOUIS RENAULT, a French officer appointed by Vichy as Prefect of Police in
                Casablanca. He is a handsome, middle-aged Frenchman, debonair and gay, but withal a
                shrewd and alert official. With him are HERR HEINZE, the German consul, CAPTAIN
                TONELLI, an Italian officer, and LIEUTENANT CASSELLE, Renault's aide. When the plane
                door opens, the first passenger to step out is a tall, middle-aged, pale German with
                a smile that seems more the result of a frozen face muscle than a cheerful
                disposition. On any occasion when MAJOR STRASSER is crossed, his expression hardens
                into iron. Herr Heinze steps up to him with upraised arm. DISSOLVE TO:EXT. RICK'S CAFE - NIGHT The neon sign above the door is brightly lit.
                Customers arrive and go in through the front door. From inside we hear sounds of
                MUSIC and LAUGHTER. The song is "It Had to Be You." Again we isolate on the neon
                sign. INSERT SIGN: "Rick's Cafe Americain". We follow a group of customers
                inside.INT. RICK'S CAFE - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT Rick's is an expensive and chic nightclub
                which definitely possesses an air of sophistication and intrigue. SAM, a middle-aged
                Negro, sits on a stool before a small, salmon-colored piano on wheels, playing and
                singing while accompanied by a small orchestra. All about him there is the HUM of
                voices, CHATTER and LAUGHTER. The occupants of the room are varied. There are
                Europeans in their dinner jackets, their women beautifully begowned and bejeweled.
                There are Moroccans in silk robes. Turks wearing fezzes. Levantines. Naval officers.
                Members of the Foreign Legion, distinguished by their kepis. Two men sit at a table. INT. RICK'S CAFE - GAMBLING ROOM - NIGHT Their is much activity at the various
                tables. At one table TWO WOMEN and a MAN play cards. They glance at another table.
                One of them calls to Carl. CUT TO:INT. RICK'S CAFE - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT Rick makes his way over to Sam, who plays
                and sings the "Knock Wood" number, accompanied by the orchestra. The cafe is in
                semi-darkness. The spotlight is on Sam, and every time the orchestra comes in on the
                "Knock Wood" business, the spotlight swings over to the orchestra. During one of the
                periods when the spotlight is on the orchestra, Rick slips the letters of transit
                into the piano. FERRARI, owner of the Blue Parrot, a competing night spot, comes
                into the cafe, sits down, and watches Sam. Then he sees Rick and they smile at each
                other. At the end of the number Ferrari goes to the bar to speak to Rick. CUT TO:EXT. RICK'S CAFE - NIGHT Sacha stands at the curb on the street in front of
                Rick's and signals for a cab. CUT TO:INT. RICK'S CAFE - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT They pass Sam at the piano. He's playing
                "Baby Face". Rick pats Sam on the shoulder. INT. RICK'S CAFE - OFFICE - NIGHT Rick opens up the safe in a small, dark room
                just off the office. Only Rick's shadow can be seen getting the money out. CUT TO:INT. RICK'S CAFE - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT Renault walks up to Carl. CUT TO:INT. RICK'S CAFE - GAMBLING ROOM - NIGHT Ugarte stands at the roulette table.
                Two gendarmes approach him from behind. INT. RICK'S CAFE - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT By the time the gendarmes manage to get
                the door open again, Ugarte has pulled a gun. He FIRES at the doorway. The SHOTS
                bring on pandemonium in the cafe. As Ugarte runs through the hallway he sees Rick,
                appearing from the opposite direction, and grabs him.
