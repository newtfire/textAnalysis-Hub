MUSIC: THEME ... FILLS A PAUSE ... THEN BEHIND NARRATOR--

NARRATOR: This is the Man in Black, here again to introduce Columbia's 
program, "Suspense." In our starring Hollywood cast tonight are Mr. John 
Sutton who appears as a young English doctor, Jim Norwood, who knew a great 
deal more than he admitted concerning the strange events which we are about to 
relate, and Mr. George Zucco, who plays the village curate, the Reverend 
Arthur Morley. Our story -- and it bears none but a coincidental resemblance 
to H. G. Wells' famous short novel, The Invisible Man -- is by John Dickson 
Carr and is called "The Man Without a Body," tonight's tale of suspense. 

If you have been with us on these Tuesday nights, you will know that 
"Suspense" is compounded of mystery and suspicion and dangerous adventure. In 
this series are tales calculated to intrigue you. And so it is with "The Man 
Without a Body" and the performances of John Sutton and George Zucco, we again 
hope to keep you in-- 

MUSIC: KNIFE CHORD

NARRATOR: --<u>suspense</u>!

MUSIC: UP AND OUT

SOUND: SURF BACKGROUND

NARRATOR: A lonely beach of low white sand hills, edged by the surf of the 
North Sea.

MUSIC: SNEAKS IN

NARRATOR: And back from the beach, drowsing as it has drowsed for ten 
centuries, lies the village of Aldridge in Suffolk. There is the sea wall, now 
defaced by air raid shelters, and there are the rolling grain fields; the 
thatched white cottages; the spire of St. Luke's church above the oak trees. 
Ancient and bell-haunted, lost among hedgerows, this village could never cause 
consternation in London newspaper offices. And yet, on that warm night nearly 
four years ago--

WOMAN: This time it's really happened! A man without a body! Completely 
invisible!

MUSIC: ACCENT ... THEN OUT BEHIND--

SOUND: NEWSROOM BACKGROUND (TYPEWRITERS, ET CETERA)

EDITOR: (CALLS) Copy boy! Copy boy! (TO OTHERS) Look at this dispatch! (READS) 
"Reign of Terror in Suffolk Village."

1ST MALE: Has another of H. G. Wells' romances come true?

WOMAN: An invisible man? I can't believe it!

2ND MALE: What's the matter with that village? Have they all gone scatty? 

EDITOR: (READS) "Mr. George Wellman, builder, states that as he was returning 
home along the main road from Bury St Edmunds--"

WOMAN: (READS) "--he distinctly saw a man's hat, without any head under it, 
moving towards him about six feet above the ground."

EDITOR: Oh, Lord, he must have been full of beer. We can't use this story! 
(CALLS) Copy boy!

COPY BOY: (OFF) Coming!

1ST MALE: (READS) "Even more surprising evidence was given by the Reverend 
Arthur Morley, vicar of St. Luke's church--"

EDITOR: (SURPRISED) Who?! The parson?! 

2ND MALE: You don't think <u>he</u> was full of beer? 

1ST MALE: (READS) "One question above all agitates the village: who is 
Professor Ansmith? Who <u>is</u> this elderly American, said to be an inventor, who 
has settled at Aldridge and leased a part of the house belonging to the local 
doctor? Out of some terrifying workshop, to strike like a maniac where least 
expected, has there at last emerged--" 

WOMAN: (READS) "--a real invisible man?"

MUSIC: BRIEF TRANSITION ... THEN BEHIND NARRATOR--

NARRATOR: The church of St. Luke, Aldridge, on that same Sunday evening. 
Evening service is over now, though an echo bell still lingers. In the vestry 
at the rear of the church, where white surplices hang like ghosts, the 
Reverend Arthur Morley sits with his daughter Janice. It is a stone room of 
painted windows, now many-colored in the sunset, and here, as the drowsy 
summer light turns to dusk--

SOUND: CHURCH BELL TOLLS BRIEFLY, IN BG

REV. MORLEY: Janice, I don't believe it. 

JANICE: I know, father. 

REV. MORLEY: I saw it with my own eyes, yet I don't believe it. You don't 
think we were dreaming, do you? 

JANICE: No, father. We weren't dreaming. 

REV. MORLEY: If this goes on, the whole village will be in a frenzy. But what 
can I do? 

JANICE: We could go to Professor Ansmith and ask him straight out. 

REV. MORLEY: Ask him whether he's responsible for these--?

JANICE: Yes. 

REV. MORLEY: I wonder, Janice. The man isn't hurting anybody, you know. You 
couldn't ask for a quieter person or a better neighbor. And yet-- (BEAT) 
What's that?

SOUND: DURING ABOVE, FOOTSTEPS APPROACH FROM OFF

JANICE: Father, you <u>are</u> upset. It's only Mr. Emmett coming down from the 
belfry.

REV. MORLEY: Emmett! Oh, yes, of course.

SOUND: CREAKY TOWER DOOR OPENS

REV. MORLEY: Is that you, Mr. Emmett? 

EMMETT: It's me all right, sir, and very much in the flesh. (CHUCKLES) Did you 
think I was the invisible man? 

REV. MORLEY: Mr. Emmett, I forbid you to mention that subject.

EMMETT: (LIGHTLY) Very good, sir. But there's others, begging your pardon, 
that <u>do</u> mention it.

REV. MORLEY: Yes, yes. Forgive me; I spoke too sharply.

EMMETT: That's all right, sir. No 'arm done, no bones broken. Mind you, not 
that I 'old with this talk about invisible men. 'Taint natural, I say. It 
ain't 'ardly Christian. I'm a greengrocer by trade, and I believe in what I 
can weigh and feel and-- (STOPS SHORT)

JANICE: (BEAT) What's the matter, Mr. Emmett? Is anything wrong? 

EMMETT: (WARILY) Excuse me, sir, and you too, miss. Do you see anybody in this 
room, 'cept us? 

JANICE: No. Of course not. Why?

EMMETT: 'Cause I - I could have sworn something brushed past me just now. 

REV. MORLEY: You're imagining things, Mr. Emmett. 

EMMETT: Yes, sir, I dare say, but--

REV. MORLEY: There's nobody hidden in the belfry tower, I hope.

EMMETT: No, sir. I 'ad a look-see. And what's more-- (<u>SOUND</u>: <u>TOWER</u> <u>DOOR</u> 
<u>CLOSES</u>) --there's not going to be anybody up there, once I've locked the door. 
(<u>SOUND</u>: <u>DOOR</u> <u>LOCKED</u>) Now, let the blighter try and get in. 

JANICE: Oh, please, Mr. Emmett, and you, too, father. You're talking about 
this invisible man as though -- as though he actually existed.

EMMETT: There's something funny going on, miss; you can't deny that. 

REV. MORLEY: No, none of us can deny it.

EMMETT: And what's more, sir, it's gettin' pretty dark in 'ere. Hadn't you and 
Miss Janice better get along to the vicarage while I lock up?

REV. MORLEY: No, we can't go just yet, Mr. Emmett. We're expecting Dr. 
Norwood.

EMMETT: Dr. Jim Norwood, sir? What does 'e say about all this?                              

SOUND: KNOCK ON VESTRY DOOR

REV. MORLEY: Oh, you might ask him yourself, Mr. Emmett. I think that's 
probably him now. (CALLS) Come in, the vestry door's not locked!

SOUND: VESTRY DOOR OPENS ... THEN CLOSES BEHIND--

DR. NORWOOD: (OUT OF BREATH) Oh, hello, padre! Hello, Janice! I'm sorry I'm 
late.

JANICE: Hello, Jim. You seem a good deal out of breath.

DR. NORWOOD: I <u>am</u> out of breath, Janice, because there's blue blazes to pay 
down in the village. 

REV. MORLEY: Not more trouble?

DR. NORWOOD: Yes, I'm afraid so. They're holding a mass meeting at the Coach 
and Horses, and they're ready to murder Professor Ansmith. If this invisible 
man cuts any more capers, we may see a real old-fashioned lynching in an 
English village.

REV. MORLEY: Now look here, my boy, this has got to stop.

DR. NORWOOD: I know that, padre, but how are we going to stop it?

REV. MORLEY: Sit down there, Jim, across the table from me. 

DR. MORLEY: Yes, sir.

REV. MORLEY: First of all, what do you know about this Professor Ansmith?

DR. NORWOOD: Nothing, sir. Nothing at all.

REV. MORLEY: But you rent part of your house to him.

DR. NORWOOD: Oh, my dear padre, that house is twice as big as I can possible 
manage. I was only too glad to get a tenant.

REV. MORLEY: He gave you references, I imagine? 

DR. NORWOOD: Yes, but I didn't bother to check 'em. He's a quiet old boy; pays 
his rent on the dot. Never does anything except read and go for long walks.

JANICE: Are you quite sure of that, Jim?

DR. NORWOOD: The village has war nerves, that's all. With a camouflaged 
aerodrome in the neighborhood, they're apt to imagine anything.

REV. MORLEY: True, perhaps, but--

DR. NORWOOD: That talk about dynamos humming in the old boy's room and blue 
lights flashing is rubbish out of a sensational film. They imagined the whole 
thing. Finally, this crazy story about an invisible man playing the 
gramophone; why, that's--

REV. MORLEY: It's not a crazy story, Jim. Janice and I saw it happen.

DR. NORWOOD: You what?

REV. MORLEY: Last night, about half past nine, Janice and I were out for a 
walk in the lane that runs past your house. On the way we met Willy Kendrick 
and he joined us. 

DR. NORWOOD: (BEAT) Well, sir?

JANICE: Listen, Jim. On that side of the house, there's a little square room 
with two windows and no furniture except a round table and a couple of chairs. 
Do you know the one we mean?

DR. NORWOOD: Yes, of course; Professor Ansmith uses it. What about the room?

REV. MORLEY: It wasn't quite blackout time. The windows were up. The curtains 
weren't drawn, and the room was brightly lighted. On the table stood an old-
fashioned gramophone with a horn and a crank-handle. Beside it lay a pair of 
white cotton gloves like - like gardener's gloves. The gramophone was playing 
away for dear life, but there was nobody in the room.  Janice thought that was 
a bit odd, a gramophone going full tilt with nobody there, and called my 
attention to it. Just then, the gramophone started to run down. We could hear 
the record slow and go off key. As it did so--

DR. NORWOOD: (BEAT) Well, sir, go on.

REV. MORLEY: As it did so, those white gloves got up off the table--

DR. NORWOOD: Got up off the table?

REV. MORLEY: --got up off the table, took hold of the gramophone, and wound it 
up again.

SOUND: CRASH! OF CANDLESTICKS DROPPED ON FLOOR

JANICE: Mr. Emmett, what on earth are you doing?

EMMETT: (NERVOUS, APOLOGETIC) I - I dropped some candlesticks.

JANICE: So I see. Please pick them up again.

EMMETT: Yes, miss.

SOUND: DURING ABOVE EXCHANGE, CANDLESTICKS PICKED UP

DR. NORWOOD: Padre, are you serious?

REV. MORLEY: Perfectly serious. 

DR. NORWOOD: A pair of gloves, without any hands inside them?

REV. MORLEY: Yes.

DR. NORWOOD: But what did they do exactly? 

REV. MORLEY: The left-hand glove steadied the gramophone. The right-hand glove 
wound it up. Then they both hung in the air, beating time to the music. It 
should have been funny; I can only assure you it was <u>not</u> funny. 

DR. NORWOOD: Well, what happened then? 

JANICE: Oh, Jim, it was horrible. Willy Kendrick let out a yell and ran down 
the lane between the apple trees as though the devil were after him. 

DR. NORWOOD: I can't say I blame him.

JANICE: Father and I just stood there and - and-- (VOICE TRAILS OFF 
HELPLESSLY)

DR. NORWOOD: Stared is the word, my dear.

JANICE: Yes, stared. I can't forget any of it. The three-legged table and the 
whirling record and the blue flowers on the wallpaper-- But there was nobody 
there! We could see past the table and under the table and all over the room 
-- and there was nobody there!

DR. NORWOOD: Except the man without any body.

REV. MORLEY: Confound the man without any body. 

JANICE: Father, suppose it <u>is</u> true.

REV. MORLEY: As a clergyman, my dear, I prefer to remain agnostic. This 
thing's a trick.

DR. NORWOOD: Yes, but how's it done? And why?

REV. MORLEY: That's the whole point, Jim. What worries me is the effect on our 
people here.  We call ourselves intelligent, and yet-- Look at us. Even Mr. 
Emmett there.

EMMETT: (NERVOUSLY) Eh, eh? What's that about me, sir?

REV. MORLEY: A few minutes ago, you thought something brushed past you when 
you were coming down the stairs from the bell tower, now didn't you?

EMMETT: (CONCEDES) Well-- Yes, sir. 

REV. MORLEY: You see what I mean, Jim?

EMMETT: But I didn't really think so, sir. Not really. It was imagination, 
just like the doctor said. 'Cause I <u>searched</u> that tower. I locked the door 
afterwards.

REV. MORLEY: Exactly. But the mere force of suggestion, nothing more, might 
lead you to believe--

SOUND: CHURCH BELL TOLLS ... THEN CONTINUES EVENLY AND INSISTENTLY IN BG 

JANICE: (GASPS IN HORROR, BEAT) That's not suggestion, father.

EMMETT: Sir! I'd stake my bible oath, there's nobody in that belfry.

DR. NORWOOD: Bells can't ring by themselves, old man. There's somebody pulling 
the rope up there, and we're going to find out who it is.

REV. MORLEY: One moment, all of you.

DR. NORWOOD: What's wrong, padre? You're as white as a ghost. 

REV. MORLEY: This blasphemous mockery, it seems, extends even to the church. 
Very well. You will stay with Janice, my boy. Emmett and I will collar this 
invisible man. 

DR. NORWOOD: Why can't I go, too?

REV. MORLEY: I don't believe in this, but - I should prefer to have someone 
with Janice. (INHALES) You're not afraid, Mr. Emmett? 
 
EMMETT: If - if it's alive, sir, I'm not afraid of it. And if it's dead, 
well-- Well, <u>you're</u> not afraid of it.

SOUND: TOWER DOOR UNLOCKS AND CREAKS OPEN

EMMETT: The tower door's open, sir. I'm ready.

JANICE: Don't do it, father! Don't go!

SOUND: MORLEY AND EMMETT'S STEPS UP STAIRS AND AWAY BEHIND--

DR. NORWOOD: You can't help them, Janice. Sit down here. Take it easy.

JANICE: Jim Norwood, what's wrong with you?

DR. NORWOOD: Wrong with me?

JANICE: You've got an odd look, too. And the light's fading. And the surplices 
look like ghosts. And in another minute that bell will drive me mad. Suppose 
he <u>has</u> got in?
 
DR. NORWOOD: Who?

JANICE: The invisible man.

DR. NORWOOD: Oh, don't talk rot.   

JANICE: "If there are sounds that the ear cannot hear, so there are colors 
that the eye cannot see." I read that somewhere. He hasn't hurt anybody yet. 
But suppose he turns nasty and <u>does</u> hurt somebody!

DR. NORWOOD: He can't hurt anybody.

JANICE: How do you know?

DR. NORWOOD: Janice, listen to me. Take my hand. 

JANICE: Oh, but, Jim--

DR. NORWOOD: I want to tell you a few things you won't understand. I don't ask 
you to understand; I just ask you to remember. 

JANICE: Well, what is it?

DR. NORWOOD: The first is a question. If you were a government official and 
wanted to find an expert on camouflage, where would you go? 

JANICE: An expert on camouflage?

DR. NORWOOD: Yes. And the second point is this. I studied medicine in Germany.

JANICE: Oh, I know that, but that's not--

DR. NORWOOD: One night, on a bet, I hid backstage at the Wintergarten Theatre 
in Berlin. I saw the whole show from backstage, and-- (POINTEDLY) And I 
learned a great deal.

JANICE: Jim Norwood, what on earth are you talking about? 

DR. NORWOOD: George Wellman and I have talked the whole thing over. In a way, 
Janice, there <u>is</u> an invisible man. I can tell you who he is, and how he works. 
But there's no danger, do you understand? There's no danger at all.

SOUND: CHURCH BELL FINALLY COMES TO AN ABRUPT STOP

EMMETT: (LENGTHY BLOODCURDLING SCREAM FROM OUTSIDE THE CHURCH AS EMMETT FALLS 
FROM THE BELFRY) 

SOUND: CRASH! OF EMMETT THROUGH AN OAK TREE AND INTO THE CHURCHYARD GROUND 
OUTSIDE

JANICE: Jim, what was that?!

DR. NORWOOD: (BEAT) I don't know.

JANICE: You <u>do</u> know. I can see it in your face. You <u>do</u> know!

DR. NORWOOD: I think somebody's fallen.

JANICE: Fallen? 

DR. NORWOOD: From the top of the belfry.

JANICE: (SHRIEKS) Father!
 
DR. NORWOOD: Stay here, Janice; you can't do any good.

JANICE: Let go of my arm! I'm going out there!

DR. NORWOOD: No, you're not. I didn't think what the danger might be. Besides, 
there's somebody coming down the stairs now. Stay just where you are and don't 
move until--

SOUND: DURING ABOVE, REV. MORLEY'S FOOTSTEPS APPROACH FROM OFF

JANICE: Oh, father! Father, are you all right?

DR. NORWOOD: Steady, sir. Take it easy now.

REV. MORLEY: I'm perfectly all right, yes, but you'd better go into the 
churchyard and see to Emmett. He--

JANICE: He fell?

REV. MORLEY: No, Janice, he did not fall; he was thrown. 

DR. NORWOOD: Thrown? By whom?

REV. MORLEY: There's no time to argue now. You're a doctor, go out and see to 
him.

DR. NORWOOD: Well, is he in--?

REV. MORLEY: I don't know! Go!

DR. NORWOOD: Yes, sir.

SOUND: VESTRY DOOR OPENS AND SHUTS AS DR. NORWOOD EXITS

REV. MORLEY: (QUOTES THE BIBLE) "For I will work a deed in your days which ye 
will not believe though it be told  you." (BEAT) Janice, this is incredible!

JANICE: Why?

REV. MORLEY: You <u>heard</u> the bell ring. I <u>saw</u> it ring. 

JANICE: Without - anybody there?

REV. MORLEY: I was as close to that bell as I am to you now. No hand held the 
rope. There were no strings or wires or any tricks to make it move. Yet it 
clanged back and forth alone in the tower. And I thought I heard someone 
laugh.

JANICE: Laugh? 

REV. MORLEY: Oh, don't take that too seriously. We were both overwrought and 
the noise of the bell was deafening.

JANICE: Well, what about Mr. Emmett?

REV. MORLEY: Emmett yelled some words I couldn't hear and lunged for the bell. 
Then something caught him. Something caught him and gave him a sledgehammer 
blow in the back. That belfry's nothing but open arches. You heard him scream. 
I saw his face just before he went over.
 
JANICE: Lock the door to the tower, father. Lock it!

REV. MORLEY: I can't lock it; Emmett has the key. But why <u>should</u> I lock it?

JANICE: Because he's still in there.

REV. MORLEY: He?

JANICE: He hadn't done any harm before, but he's done harm now. There's no 
telling what might happen if he gets loose.  

REV. MORLEY: You mean--?

JANICE: I mean Professor Ansmith's protégé, whoever he is: the man without a 
body!

MUSIC: BRIEF TRANSITION ... LOW, OMINOUS ... THEN IN BG--

NARRATOR: Under the red sunset some quarter of a mile away, a grass-carpeted 
lane winds between rows of apple trees. The lane is dusky, though lights shine 
into it from the windows of a large stone house: Dr. Norwood's house, beyond 
the apple trees. 

SOUND: NOCTURNAL BACKGROUND (CRICKETS, ET CETERA), WHICH CONTINUES UNTIL THE 
END OF THE PLAY ... ANSMITH'S FOOTSTEPS PACE BACK AND FORTH, IN AGREEMENT WITH 
FOLLOWING--

NARRATOR: Up and down, up and down, a shadowy figure is pacing: an elderly 
figure, a dejected figure, tall and frail as a shadow among shadows, muttering 
to itself, shaking its head; now and then raising one fist in bewilderment or 
anguish. Sometimes the light gleams on large spectacles and a kindly mouth. Up 
and down, endlessly up and down, strides Professor Ansmith. 

MUSIC: OUT

ANSMITH: (MUTTERS, TO HIMSELF) I'm not guilty, I'm not guilty. How can I 
convince them that I'm not guil--? (STOPS SHORT, CALLS TENSELY) Who's there?! 
(NO ANSWER) I saw you dodge behind that tree. Stand out, sir. 

WELLMAN: (OFF) Did you call me, Professor Ansmith? 

ANSMITH: Yes, I <u>did</u> call you. Who are you?

SOUND: WELLMAN'S STEPS TO ANSMITH BEHIND--

WELLMAN: (APPROACHES) You probably won't recognize me, Professor Ansmith.

ANSMITH: Nevertheless, my friend, may I ask what your name is?

WELLMAN: My name is Wellman, Professor. George Wellman. 

ANSMITH: (MUSES) Wellman, Wellman? I've heard that name.

WELLMAN: Maybe you have. I'm a builder by trade and a great friend of Dr. 
Norwood's. 

ANSMITH: Wait one moment! Aren't you the young man whose firm is putting up 
these air raid shelters along the sea wall? And making such an unholy din with 
your riveting machines? 

WELLMAN: That's me. 

ANSMITH: And, come to think of it, aren't you the one who first started this 
alarm about an invisible man?

WELLMAN: Yes, because I met him.

ANSMITH: You did <u>not</u> meet him, sir. This whole thesis is scientific nonsense, 
and I won't have it!

WELLMAN: You won't have what? 

ANSMITH: I'm an old man, Mr. Wellman. I never did anybody the least harm. As 
God is my judge, I know nothing whatever about this - this-- (<u>SOUND</u>: <u>MOTOR</u> <u>CAR</u> 
<u>APPROACHES</u> <u>IN</u> <u>BG</u>) What's that? 

WELLMAN: It looks like the vicar's car, Professor. You'd better stand back. 
This is a pretty narrow lane. 

SOUND: MOTOR CAR SCREECHES TO A HALT ... CAR DOORS OPEN AND SHUT BEHIND--

REV. MORLEY: Ansmith! Professor Ansmith?!

ANSMITH: Yes, Mr. Morley? I hear you.

REV. MORLEY: (A LITTLE BREATHLESS) We thought we'd better drive over here 
straight away. I - I think you've met my daughter. And of course you know Dr. 
Norwood.

BIZ: MURMURED GREETINGS EXCHANGED

REV. MORLEY: But there's no time for any social formalities. Get into your 
house, Professor Ansmith. Get in quickly and close the shutters. 

ANSMITH: But why should I do that?

DR. NORWOOD: Because there's a mob coming, sir, and we can't stop them.

JANICE: (URGENT) Hurry. Do hurry.

ANSMITH: A mob? Coming here? Why?

REV. MORLEY: Haven't you heard the news?

ANSMITH: I've heard nothing, my friend. The only person I've seen has been 
that young man there who chews a toothpick and hides behind the trees. 

JANICE: George Wellman? What on earth are you doing here?   

WELLMAN: Watching, Janice. Watching and waiting. Just as usual.

REV. MORLEY: Listen to me, Professor Ansmith. Henry Emmett, the head verger 
with St. Luke's, was thrown from the belfry window not twenty minutes ago. 

ANSMITH: Not by me, sir, I assure you. I had nothing to do with it.

REV. MORLEY: No, not by you, but apparently - by the invisible man.

ANSMITH: (EXASPERATED) Oh, Father in Heaven. Will this never stop?

WELLMAN: Not till we catch the fellow, no.  

REV. MORLEY: Be quiet, Mr. Wellman, please.

WELLMAN: I'm sorry, padre. I take it back. 

REV. MORLEY: I myself can testify that no visible person laid hands on Emmett. 
He was struck -- struck as though with a gigantic fist. (BEAT) What's the 
matter, Professor Ansmith? Is anything wrong?

ANSMITH: No, no, no, no, no. I - I was just thinking. Is Emmett dead? 

REV. MORLEY: Fortunately, no.

ANSMITH: I'm glad of that, my friend, for a certain person's sake.

REV. MORLEY: He's not even seriously hurt. The bell tower isn't high and a 
tree broke the force of his fall, but he's badly shaken up. And that crowd at 
the Coach and Horses means trouble. If you haven't anything to say to us, if 
you haven't a word of explanation to utter--

SOUND: MURMUR OF APPROACHING CROWD

WELLMAN: Listen, padre, don't you hear anything?

REV. MORLEY: Yes, I thought I heard voices.

DR. NORWOOD: Can't be that crowd from the village. We're too far ahead of 
them.

WELLMAN: It's a crowd, all right. And they've been here for hours.

DR. NORWOOD: But where? I don't see anybody.

JANICE: Jim! Look! Behind the trees.

WELLMAN: "Look behind the trees, look beyond the hedgerows; look for any place 
where a watcher can hide."

ANSMITH: (ANNOYED) And may I ask what they're doing here?

WELLMAN: They're watching you, Professor Ansmith. 

ANSMITH: More of your spies, you mean. 

WELLMAN: You can call them anything you please. They're getting impatient and 
they want a showdown. If I as much as hold my hand up like this--

SOUND: CRASH! OF STONE THROWN THROUGH GLASS WINDOW

JANICE: (SHRIEKS)

SOUND: CROWD MURMURS THREATENINGLY ... THEN IN BG

REV. MORLEY: (TO CROWD) Don't throw stones at the windows, you fools! You'll 
only break the doctor's windows!

ANSMITH: Gentlemen, I can't have any more of this. (TO CROWD) Be quiet, all of 
you, and listen to me!

SOUND: CROWD QUIETS 

WELLMAN: Well, sir, we're listening.

ANSMITH: I'm a peaceful man. I like to live in peace with my neighbors. I have 
nothing to do with this so-called reign of terror. But you don't believe that, 
do you? 

WELLMAN: No.

ANSMITH: Then I must expose a fraud. Now, don't blame me if I expose the 
trickster, too. I have made preparations to <u>show</u> <u>you</u> - the invisible man -- 
the man without a body.

SOUND: CROWD REACTS

REV. MORLEY: Quiet, everybody!

SOUND: CROWD QUIETS 

ANSMITH: Mr. Morley, I believe you and your daughter walked through this lane 
last night, er, while I was away at Bury St Edmunds?

REV. MORLEY: I don't know about your being away, sir. My daughter and I were 
certainly here, yes. 

ANSMITH: Good, good. Miss Janice Morley?

JANICE: Yes, Professor Ansmith? 

ANSMITH: Will you look toward your right, please, at the house? What do you 
see?

JANICE: It's the same room.

ANSMITH: What room? 

JANICE: The room with the little round table and the gramophone.

ANSMITH: It's a three-legged table, you notice.

JANICE: Yes, of course.

ANSMITH: But there's nobody in the room?

JANICE: No, nobody at all.

ANSMITH: Are conditions exactly as they were last night?

JANICE: Yes. Except there aren't any gloves on the table.

ANSMITH: No, but the invisible man is there! 

SOUND: CROWD REACTS

ANSMITH: A living presence, ready to act, and breathe, and even kill.
 
SOUND: CROWD REACTS (A VOICE SAYS, "Even kill!") ... THEN QUIETS BEHIND--

ANSMITH: With your permission, I shall now address him. (CALLS) Hello, in 
there! Hello, in there! Hello, in there! 

JANICE: If anybody answers him, father, I'm going to scream. 

REV. MORLEY: Quiet, Janice, quiet.

JANICE: Father! Look! The gloves are appearing on the table! 

SOUND: CROWD REACTS WITH CONSTERNATION ... THEN QUIETS BEHIND--

ANSMITH: I call out to him and I speak as follows: (CALLS) Hold the phonograph 
with your left glove! 

SOUND: CROWD REACTS 

ANSMITH: (CALLS) That's it! Turn the handle with your right! 

SOUND: CROWD REACTS 

ANSMITH: One turn. Two. Three. Four. (CALLS) That's enough! Touch the spring 
with your left hand! 

SOUND: CROWD REACTS 

ANSMITH: (CALLS) Push the record! 

SOUND: CROWD REACTS 

ANSMITH: (CALLS) Lower the needle with your right and--!

SOUND: SCRATCHY PHONOGRAPH RECORD PLAYS A VINTAGE TUNE, WHICH CONTINUES IN BG 
... CROWD MURMURS

ANSMITH: (TRIUMPHANT) Ladies and gentlemen, the invisible man!

SOUND: CROWD REACTS ANGRILY ... STONES THROWN AT GLASS WINDOW ... THEN IN BG

REV. MORLEY: Hold it! Hold it, you fools!  

ANSMITH: On the contrary, let them throw all they like! Aim at the table, my 
friends, aim at the table!

REV. MORLEY: Why at the table?!

ANSMITH: Because then they'll see the trick! 

REV. MORLEY: I don't follow you. What trick?

ANSMITH: The trick of the looking-glasses! 

SOUND: CRASH! AS STONE HITS TABLE ... PHONOGRAPH RECORD SCRATCHES TO A STOP 
... CROWD QUIETS 

ANSMITH: There! You see <u>now</u>, my friends? 

DR. NORWOOD: (QUIETLY SATISFIED) I think I <u>do</u>.

ANSMITH: (A LECTURE) The legs of the table form a triangle with its point 
toward you. Panels of looking-glass are fitted in the two sides facing you. 

VOICE: (FROM CROWD, IMPRESSED) What d'you know 'bout that?!

ANSMITH: You <u>think</u> you can see under the table, but what you actually see are 
the side walls of the room reflected in those two mirrors. 

SOUND: CROWD REACTS

REV. MORLEY: Wait a minute. Do you mean--?

ANSMITH: I mean that my old servant, hidden behind the mirrors, has just been 
working the gloves through a panel in the table top. 

SOUND: CROWD REACTS

ANSMITH: It's a very old trick, first shown by Colonel Stodare at the London 
Polytechnic. 

REV. MORLEY: And that's what happened last night?

ANSMITH: Yes. 

REV. MORLEY: And you had nothing to do with it?

ANSMITH: Nothing whatever. Nor had my servant.

JANICE: Then who <u>did</u> do it and why? What <u>is</u> the explanation of all this?

ANSMITH: Well, I can't tell you <u>why</u>. That's what beats me. But I can tell you 
everything else. 

JANICE: This invisible man who's been scaring us all silly--?

ANSMITH: My dear young lady, there's no invisible man. There never <u>has</u> been.                     

SOUND: CROWD MURMURS SKEPTICALLY 

REV. MORLEY: I might believe that, Professor Ansmith, if I hadn't seen a 
church bell ringing where there was no hand to ring it. And poor old Emmett 
flung out of the tower as though a giant hand had got hold of him. 

SOUND: CROWD MURMURS QUESTIONINGLY

REV. MORLEY: You're not saying <u>that</u> was done with looking-glasses?! 

ANSMITH: No, my friend, not at all. That was really clever. 

REV. MORLEY: Strings? Wires? Ropes?

ANSMITH: No, they weren't necessary. 

REV. MORLEY: But the thing's impossible. 

ANSMITH: Oh, no. The same principle was used by my old friend J. N. Maskelyne 
to make mechanical figures work: Psycho played whist and Zoe drew pictures. I 
myself-- I-- (CATCHES HIMSELF, STOPS SHORT)

DR. NORWOOD: Go on, sir. You yourself--? What were you going to say? 

ANSMITH: (RESUMES SMOOTHLY) The secret, I was about to say, remains unknown, 
even today. You were right, in a way, when you tell us that Emmett acted as 
though a giant had got hold of him. A giant <u>had</u> got hold of him; at least, a 
gigantic force.                           

SOUND: CROWD REACTS

JANICE: Oh, before we all go completely mad, would you mind telling us what 
this gigantic force was?

ANSMITH: Not at all. It was compressed air.

JANICE: Compressed air?

ANSMITH: But don't you see it even yet? Any of you?                          

REV. MORLEY: No.

SOUND: SOME IN CROWD SAY, "NO, WE DON'T"

ANSMITH: A compressed air pipe, with a thousand pounds of pressure behind it, 
was run up into the tower, facing the bell.

SOUND: CROWD MURMURS SKEPTICALLY

ANSMITH: It could be operated from the ground outside. The pressure was turned 
on and off in bursts. It made that heavy bell swing like a toy. Emmett -- 
don't you remember? -- Emmett rushed forward, towards the bell--

JANICE: And the air pressure--?

ANSMITH: The air pressure struck him like a sledgehammer and flung him 
headlong out of the tower. 

SOUND: CROWD MURMURS SKEPTICALLY

ANSMITH: There's your miracle, gentlemen! That's all there was to it.

SOUND: CROWD MURMURS HALF-CONVINCED (VOICE SAYS, "Oh, I don't believe it.") 
... CROWD DISCUSSES THE SITUATION, IN BG

REV. MORLEY: Sir, I can't doubt what you say. It's too circumstantial and too 
right. But--

ANSMITH: But what, my friend?

REV. MORLEY: The compressed air tanks, the mechanical apparatus to work this 
trick--

ANSMITH: Well, what about it?

REV. MORLEY: Well, where did it come from? Such things don't grow on bushes. 

ANSMITH: No. But they <u>do</u> grow on riveting machines.

REV. MORLEY: Riveting machines?

ANSMITH: Yes, such as the riveting machine they're using on the air raid 
shelters along the sea wall. (HAUGHTILY) Would you care to tell us, Dr. James 
Norwood--

JANICE: Jim!

ANSMITH: --why you and your friend Wellman have been playing all these tricks?          

SOUND: CROWD REACTS ANGRILY

MUSIC: ACCENT

SOUND: CROWD QUIETS BEHIND--

REV. MORLEY: Get back, all of you! Jim Norwood, is this true?

ANSMITH: Why, of course it's true, Mr. Morley. Don't be so gullible.

JANICE: Jim and George Wellman doing all this? I don't believe it!

ANSMITH: Take a look at their faces, young lady. Did you ever see a guiltier 
looking pair?

DR. NORWOOD: (GRIM) So we look guilty, do we? 

ANSMITH: Frankly, you do.

DR. NORWOOD: We played the whole game and convinced the village there <u>was</u> an 
invisible man. Is that it?

ANSMITH: Yes. You worked the glove trick in your own house. And Wellman worked 
the air trick with his own equipment. Everything else was nothing but a pack 
of lies and a lot of atmosphere. (WITH CONTEMPT) Playing conjurors and making 
a blasted hash of it.

DR. NORWOOD: Is that all, Professor Ansmith? 

ANSMITH: (SHRUGS) Well, remember, you brought this on yourselves. <u>I</u> didn't 
want to expose you. 

WELLMAN: No, Professor -- I <u>bet</u> you didn't!

DR. NORWOOD: Easy, George, take it easy.

JANICE: (FURIOUS) Jim, is this true?  

DR. NORWOOD: Before you start pitching into me, Janice, let me have my word 
first. Do you remember what I said to you at the church tonight? 

JANICE: At the church?

DR. NORWOOD: Yes, I asked you to remember something, even if you didn't 
understand it. All right, can you remember what it was? 

JANICE: Oh, Jim, please. You're only trying to evade this. I - I'm so confused 
now I don't remember anything. All I can think of is this horrible business 
and what's behind it. Father can't believe his ears and I'm not much better. 
We've practically idolized you. All we want you to do is answer a straight 
question. Jim, are these accusations true? 

DR. NORWOOD: (BEAT) Yes, they are true.

SOUND: CROWD REACTS BRIEFLY

REV. MORLEY: (WITH SORROW) Doubtless he had a good reason, Janice. Doubtless 
he had a good reason. 

DR. NORWOOD: Yes, we <u>had</u> a good reason.

WELLMAN: The very best reason in the world.

JANICE: You had a good reason for scaring people half to death, and trying to 
kill poor old Henry Emmett?!

WELLMAN: We didn't mean any harm against Emmett. That was an accident.

JANICE: But you dare to defend yourselves now?!

DR. NORWOOD: Yes, just that. 

JANICE: (COOLLY) Before we go home, father, shall we apologize to Professor 
Ansmith? I hope he'll try to think better of English hospitality.

DR. NORWOOD: Good, Janice, good. I hope he will, too.

JANICE: <u>You</u> hope he will?

DR. NORWOOD: Listen, Janice, before you act on any belief, you have to be 
absolutely sure in your own mind. George and I had to prove something. And now 
I'm glad to say we <u>have</u> proved it.

JANICE: Oh, I can't stand this any longer. If you have anything to say, go on 
and say it straight out. What was it you had to prove?

DR. NORWOOD: We had to prove to our own satisfaction that this pretended 
American, who calls himself Professor Ansmith--

JANICE: <u>Pretended</u> American?

REV. MORLEY: (CONFUSED) Who calls himself Professor Ansmith?

DR. NORWOOD: We had to prove that this pretended American was no other than 
Karl Heinrich von Keit--

SOUND: CROWD REACTS BRIEFLY

DR. NORWOOD: --the celebrated stage magician from the Wintergarten Theatre in 
Berlin--

REV. MORLEY: What?

SOUND: CROWD REACTS BRIEFLY

DR. NORWOOD: --whose real job is to find the camouflaged aerodrome near Bury 
St Edmunds.

SOUND: CROWD, IN HORROR, SAYS, "NO!"

DR. NORWOOD: (LIGHTLY) He explained his own tricks very nicely, George. We'll 
swear out a warrant in the morning.

SOUND: CROWD REACTS ANGRILY

MUSIC: CURTAIN
