The Coca-Cola program

10.30-11 p. m., Wednesday, November 11, 1931

OPENING ANNOUNCEMENT: The Coca-Cola program (signature).

McNAMEE (through modulation). Good evening, ladies and gentlemen of the radio 
audience. This is Graham McNamee, happy to be offering you the refreshment of 
another sparkling Coca-Cola program. Familiar melodies you love, beautifully 
played by Gustave Haenschen and the all-string orchestra, Lewis James as 
soloist. And Grantland Rice in a football interview from the Middle West -- a 
talk with Bob Zuppke, justly famous head coach at Illinois. So just lean back 
at your ease and enjoy it with us to-night. And then to-morrow remember that 
whatever you're doing, you can always pause and refresh yourself around the 
corner from anywhere. Take a minute from your busy day. Relax at a cool and 
cheerful soda fountain with ice-cold Coca-Cola. It will leave you refreshed -- 
off to a fresh start.

(Signature full to close.)

McNAMEE. Here we go with the bubbling tune "Learn to Croon" from the musical 
comedy, "You Said It."

(Learn to Croon.)

McNAMEE. One of those smooth-flowing melodies that are so appropriate for our 
strings -- "You are my Song of Love," from that old favorite, "Blossom Time."

(You are my Song of Love.)

McNAMEE. And now we add to the strings the appealing quality of Lewis James's 
tenor and we hear that popular love song, "Just a Little Love, a Little Kiss."

(Just a Little Love, a Little Kiss.)

McNAMEE. A classical dance melody by one of the world's most famous composers, 
Brahms's Hungarian Dance No. 5.

(Hungarian Dance No. 5.)

McNAMEE. The colorful, rhythmic tango, "Bright Eyes," composed by Bertrand 
Hirsch, concert master of our Coca-Cola orchestra, in a delightful arrangement 
which Gus Haenschen has written especially for our strings.

(Bright Eyes.)

McNAMEE. Splendid, Gus. And now for a pause of refreshment -- for you and for 
everybody out in the audience who agrees that an ice-cold bottle of Coca-Cola 
would taste pretty good about now. It's so easy, you know, to order a case 
from your dealer, keep a few bottles in the refrigerator, and enjoy its 
tingling sparkle right in your own home.

(Chimes.)

McNAMEE. Here's Grant Rice at the microphone in New York, all ready to talk 
football with Bob Zuppke, who is speaking from Chicago. All right, Grant. 
Bring Bob in and let's have the kick-off.

(Interview.)

McNAMEE. Thanks, Bob. And thank you, Grant. And now the orchestra, all 
refreshed, brings us that merry bit of melody called "Wildflower."

(Wildflower.)

McNAMEE. Once again we hear the happy combination of Lewis James, accompanied 
by the strings. This time he sings that lovely tenor solo, "Little Mother of 
Mine."

(Little Mother of Mine.)

McNAMEE. And a refrain or two of the lively melody of "Yes, Yes," from the new 
musical movie, "Palmy Days."

(Yes, Yes.)

(Signature.)

McNAMEE (through modulation). Next week, same time, we'll be with you for 
another refreshing Coca-Cola program. The beautiful melody of Gustave 
Haenschen and the all-string orchestra. James Melton as soloist. And Grantland 
Rice in an interview with Dr. Roy Chapman Andrews, just back from the Gobi 
Desert, in Mongolia, after another of his thrilling adventures in search of 
the beginnings of mankind. Listen in, everybody. In the meantime, treat 
yourself to the pause that refreshes. To-morrow, for instance, when you're 
shopping or putting in a busy day at the office, take time out for a minute. 
Relax and enjoy the tingling sparkle of ice-cold Coca-Cola. You'll come up
smiling, with new zest for whatever's before you. And now we hope that, like 
Coca-Cola itself, we leave you with a happy aftersense of refreshment. This is 
Graham McNamee bidding you -- good night all.

(Signature full to close.)

CLOSING ANNOUNCEMENT: The Coca-Cola program has come to you from the NBC 
studios in New York.
