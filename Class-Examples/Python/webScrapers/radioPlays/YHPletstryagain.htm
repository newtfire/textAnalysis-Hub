Let's Try Again
Jan 05 1938


<u>CAST</u>:
DICK POWELL, host
MARLENE DIETRICH
GEORGE BRENT
ELEVATOR OPERATOR



POWELL: And now for the piece de resistance, the big event, the real highlight 
of our Parade tonight -- Miss Marlene Dietrich. You know, the way this all 
came about that Marlene is with us tonight is a little unusual. A couple of 
weeks ago, after the show, I went down to Palm Springs, where the movie people 
go for that mid-Winter sun tan ... Dropping into the Racquet Club to see if I 
could scare up a partner for some tennis, I saw Marlene just finishing a set 
with Simone Simon.... We got talking, and Marlene said some nice things about 
Mr. Lucky Strike's favorite Wednesday night program, so I asked her if she'd 
like to join the Parade this week ... The net result being that she's with us 
tonight, and we're more happy than we can tell you that she is .... 

Also with us to assist in the offering of a dramatic interlude is George 
Brent, who is taking time off from his work over on Stage 12, where he and 
Bette Davis are making the picture "Jezebel" - Marlene Dietrich and George 
Brent appear tonight in an original dramatization for the air -- "Let's Try 
Again" by Dwight Taylor -- Miss Dietrich plays the part of a beautiful young 
French girl who, under strange circumstances, meets a handsome young American 
... played by George Brent ... and now - our stage is set -- so up with the 
curtain!

(APPLAUSE)

<u>ORCHESTRA</u>: <u>Musical Curtain</u>

MUSIC: Some romantic French melody on the order of "Love's Last Word is 
spoken." 

POWELL: The scene - the top of the Eiffel Tower in Paris. The time - just 
before midnight. A canopy of stars twinkling in the sky above seem to signal 
the lights of the city below. It is cold up here - and very still. The door of 
the elevator opens and a man in evening clothes steps out onto the platform.

<u>SOUND: SOUND OF ELEVATOR DOORS OPENING</u> 

MUSIC: Fades 

EL. OP.: Here we are, Monsieur. 

BRENT: Thanks. (<u>SOUND OF CLINK OF MONEY</u>) 

EL. OP.: Thank <u>you</u>, Monsieur.
 
BRENT: Wonderful view, isn't it? 

EL. OP.: That's what they say, Monsieur. You are American. 

BRENT: Yes. Yes, I am -

EL. OP.: Monsieur would like a guide?

BRENT: No - no thanks -- I know where I'm going. 

EL. OP.: Pardon, Monsieur? 

BRENT: I said I'll be all right, thanks. I just want to take a look at the 
heavens. (PAUSE) How high is this Tower?

EL. OP.: Twelve hundred feet, Monsieur. 

BRENT: Phewww - high enough - I think I'll just -- stroll around the other 
side. 

EL. OP.: Monsieur can get a beautiful view of the Cathedral from the other 
side there.

BRENT: Yes, thanks. (WALKS AWAY)

<u>SOUND</u>: <u>ELEVATOR DOOR CLOSING</u>

MUSIC: ORIGINAL MUSIC SWELLS UP TO COVER A SHORT TIME LAPSE . . IS STOPPED BY 
THE SOUND OF THE ELEVATOR DOOR OPENING.

<u>SOUND</u>: <u>ELEVATOR DOOR OPENING</u>

MUSIC: HURRY MUSIC BEGINS AND CONTINUES THROUGH: 

DIETRICH: We are here. . . 

EL. OP.: Yes, mademoiselle.

DIETRICH: We are as high as we can go?

EL. OP.: Yes, mam'selle. 

DIETRICH: Here --

<u>SOUND</u>: <u>CLINK OF MONEY</u>

EL. OP.: Thank you, mademoiselle.

DIETRICH: Take it all --

EL. OP.: All, mademoiselle?

DIETRICH: Yes -- all -- why not?

EL. OP.: Thank you, mademoiselle. Mademoiselle can get a beautiful view of the 
Cathedral from the other side.

<u>SOUND</u>: <u>ELEVATOR DOOR CLOSING</u>

DIETRICH: (Softly) Paris -- you beautiful Paris . . Paris -- you cheat! 

MUSIC: SWELLS UP AND STOPS ABRUPTLY. 

BRENT: (OFF) (CALLS IN ALARM) Hey! Wait a minute! 

DIETRICH: No --

BRENT: Come here!

DIETRICH: Let - go - of - my - arm!

BRENT: No!

DIETRICH: Please! 

BRENT: Get down from there! What -- are -- you trying to do?

DIETRICH: Get away -- PLEASE! 

<u>SOUND</u>: SOUND OF BRIEF STRUGGLE 

BRENT: (AS SHE IS OBVIOUSLY PULLED TO SAFETY) That's better -- 

DIETRICH: Who are you? - - How -- dare --

BRENT: I'm very sorry . . . you know. . . when I saw you step up on the 
parapet, I couldn't help but feel . . .

DIETRICH: Yes . . .

BRENT: That you were doing something very foolish . . .

DIETRICH: Foolish to kill myself?

BRENT: Well, no . . . huh . . . I came up to do the same thing myself . . .

DIETRICH: To kill yourself? 

BRENT: I don't count - you see, I have nothing to live for. . . but you . . . 
I beg you not to damage you . . you're beautiful now . . . a 1200 foot drop 
would. . well - - 

DIETRICH: Monsieur, if you will let go of my arm. . . be kind enough to go 
back to your side of the Tower . . I will remain here on mine . . we can go on 
with . . our work.

BRENT: But wait a minute . . . you are a little cold-blooded about this, 
aren't you? . . . Could you really send me off around there - to bump myself 
off?

DIETRICH: Why not? . . . I've never seen you before - and I'm going to do the 
same thing . . .

BRENT: But I . . . couldn't let you do it . . .

DIETRICH: Men love to try and rescue someone, don't they? 

BRENT: And women love to be saved. 

DIETRICH: M'sieur . . . we're wasting time!

BRENT: Have you by chance a special appointment with death? Have we any real 
hurry? 

DIETRICH: Yes.

BRENT: Really? 

DIETRICH: I must be sure to make the morning papers. 

BRENT: But why?

DIETRICH: I want to spoil his breakfast. 

BRENT: Ah! a man! The blackguard - who is he?

DIETRICH: He is not a blackguard. 

BRENT: Then you love him?

DIETRICH: No, I hate him! 

BRENT: Then, if you don't love him, why go to all this trouble to make an 
impression on him. If he doesn't love you, the only impression you can make -- 
would be on the pavement -- down there. Come here, look!

DIETRICH: You're not making it any easier, monsieur.

BRENT: Look at that poor policeman down there. Suppose you fell on him and he 
had a wife and three children. 

DIETRICH: How do you know he has three?

BRENT: I don't know - just before you're going to die you can think of 
anything, can't you? 

DIETRICH: Yes.

BRENT: What are you thinking now?

DIETRICH: I was thinking . . . wouldn't it be beautiful if we could jump up 
instead of down? 

BRENT: Yes, into that lovely blue mist sky.

DIETRICH: Yes, it is beautiful, isn't it? 

BRENT: But we shall both be there soon, won't we? 

DIETRICH: Perhaps. 

BRENT: If we've been very good. Look at me - have you always been very good? 

DIETRICH: I've tried to but . . . don't look at me like that . . . let me go.

BRENT: No - not for a moment. 

DIETRICH: Yes.

BRENT: Wait - I've got an idea.

DIETRICH: It's too late for ideas.

BRENT: Here - get up here.

DIETRICH: Oh, yes.

BRENT: Steady - we'll both jump together.

DIETRICH: Yes. Thank you.

BRENT: Don't fall.

DIETRICH: Hold me then.

BRENT: This is very dangerous. 

DIETRICH: There goes your hat.

BRENT: Who cares - it'll be me next.

DIETRICH: What are you doing?

BRENT: Give it to me.

DIETRICH: You've thrown away my hat.

BRENT: If I'm going to jump without a hat, why shouldn't you?

DIETRICH: This is foolish.

BRENT: I told you you were doing something foolish when you climbed onto the 
parapet. 

DIETRICH: It was my favorite hat.

BRENT: Was it? You are beautiful without it. The wind's blowing your hair 
about your face. If you could see yourself. Just think, you might never see 
yourself again.

DIETRICH: Will you stop frightening me? If we're going to jump - let's jump.

BRENT: All right, give me your hand - goodbye mademoiselle.

DIETRICH: Goodbye, monsieur. 

BRENT: Are you ready? 

DIETRICH: Yes, I'm ready.

BRENT: (COUNTING SLOWLY) One for the money --
Two for the show -- 
Three to get ready --

DIETRICH: Wait a minute (a deep breath) I've thought of something. 

BRENT: Make it quick - - - -

DIETRICH: Don't you realize when the street cleaners find us in the morning 
we'll appear to be two lovers who died in a suicide pact? 

BRENT: That is very true -- why not?

DIETRICH: I couldn't have that. I don't even know your name. 

BRENT: Throgmorton.

DIETRICH: Mr. Throgmorton, will you help me down. I couldn't give Gustav the 
wrong impression.

BRENT: I see what you mean. I'd forgotten about Alice, too. She wouldn't like 
it, either. 

DIETRICH: Alice? 

BRENT: Yes, Alice. I met her on a boat - who is Gustav?

DIETRICH: I met him on a train -- in the dining car. 

BRENT: Dining car - - - hasn't this air made you a little hungry? 

DIETRICH: No! 

BRENT: Not thirsty? 

DIETRICH: No! 

BRENT: A glass of wine to celebrate an occasion like this? A drink to death?

DIETRICH: Perhaps we should.

BRENT: I know we should. You're smiling.

DIETRICH: It must be the air here. I feel happier.

BRENT: It can't be me? 

DIETRICH: I don't know. It's something.

<u>SOUND</u>: <u>SOUND OF ELEVATOR</u>.

BRENT: Here's the elevator now. 

<u>SOUND</u>: SOUND OF BELLS COMMENCING TO STRIKE 6 O'CLOCK SOFTLY.

BRENT: It's striking six - we should be dead by now. 

DIETRICH: Yes, we should be -- 

BRENT: And instead we will be in Maxim's with a nice cold --- 

DIETRICH: Not Maxim's -- I'm not dressed for Maxim's. I have no hat. 

BRENT: You don't need one. Alice didn't wear a hat. 

DIETRICH: You will please not mention Alice. 

BRENT: Then you can forget Gustav and if you find you don't like me you can 
always come back here.

<u>SOUND</u>: <u>ELEVATOR DOORS OPENING</u>.

EL. MAN: It's a beautiful night, Monsieur.

BRENT: Beautiful night is right. 

AS THEY ENTER THE ELEVATOR.

DIETRICH: But not without my hat!

(APPLAUSE)

POWELL: Thank you, Miss Dietrich, not only for your grand performance just 
now, but also for the way you joined in the fun with the gang here 
tonight...Thanks to you, too George - from where I sit it looks like that 
Dietrich-Brent combination is something for movie-makers to think about..But 
now before we take up the matter of music, here's a word from Mr. Lucky 
Strike.
