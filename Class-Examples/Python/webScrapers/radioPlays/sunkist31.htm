NOTE: Transcript of an excerpt.



ANNOUNCER: [...] Prudent shoppers ask for Sunkist Oranges, the pick of 
California's bumper crop, because they have the richest juice and finest 
flavors. And now, ladies & gentlemen, Sunkist presents Louella Parsons -- 
world's most widely read motion picture writer -- who will introduce your 
guest of the evening. Miss Parsons?

LOUELLA: Good evening, I wish you could all see how Norma Shearer looks as 
she sits here ready to talk to you. She looks just like a fashion plate. As 
you know, I'm no society editor, but I'm going to try to describe to you 
what she's wearing. She's sitting down here right on the set with her makeup 
on, and she's wearing one of the costumes she's wearing in her picture. 
It's tangerine -- with hat and coat to match, trimmed with ermine. Now 
that's pretty good, isn't it, Norma? 

NORMA: (CHUCKLES)

LOUELLA: I want to introduce to you Norma Shearer, one of our finest 
dramatic actresses on the screen, and a real beauty.

NORMA: (CHUCKLES) Thank you, Louella, dear. And I'm coming right back at 
you by saying I remember a time when you wouldn't have handed me those 
bouquets.

LOUELLA: Norma, I don't know what you mean!

NORMA: Remember a few years ago, back in New York, when you, the famous 
Louella Parsons, managed to spare a few minutes for lunch at the Algonquin 
Hotel with an obscure, would-be movie actress, who happened to be <u>me</u>?

LOUELLA: Heh! Norma, I shall never forget that day -- or the determined 
<u>youngness</u> of you. And yes, I have to say it: the proud and the tender.

NORMA: (LAUGHS) Oh, that was determination. I was just determined to impress 
you, and I was having an awfully hard time doing it, too, because there were 
so many famous people in the dining room that you knew. Every time I'd begin 
telling you what a great actress I was going to be, you'd keep bowing to 
<u>this</u> one and waving to <u>that</u>.
 
LOUELLA: I hope I wasn't rude!

NORMA: Rude? Why, no, darling! You were just very bored. And who could blame 
you? You'd most likely heard the same story too often. 

LOUELLA: But your story came true, now, didn't it, Norma?

NORMA: Well, this is a Cinderella business, isn't it, Louella?

LOUELLA: My! Were you [?] then?

NORMA: (SERIOUSLY) Those were the days when jobs were few and far between 
for me.

LOUELLA: (LIGHTLY) I believe the radio fan who is listening-in would be 
interested about your arriving in California. Was it as you expected it would be? 
Come on, tell us, Norma!

NORMA: (CHUCKLES) Oh, I must confess, I was a little disappointed in my 
reception. You know, I thought upon such [?] they'd have the red carpet, the 
brass band, an array of expectant photographers and reporters-- Oh, with an 
executive or two rolled in. Can you imagine my embarrassment, Louella, when 
my mother and I stepped off the train to find that-- Well, apparently no one 
even knew or cared whether we were arrived or whether we weren't.
 
LOUELLA: Aw, poor Norma. But California has been very kind to you since, now, 
hasn't it?

NORMA: Louella, I should say it has. It's been wonderful to me. Do you know, 
I've been with the same company ever since I came out here? They've been 
slick to me; they've been wonderful; I've been terribly happy.

LOUELLA: Well, I have to say for them-- Of course, you-- I don't want to give 
<u>them</u> all the credit -- because you've been pretty good yourself.

NORMA: (CHUCKLES)

LOUELLA: They've given you some wonderful stories -- especially since the 
talkies came in. I think they used rare good judgment in getting away from the 
"snow-white" heroine. People were fed to the teeth with "gaga girls" who were 
one hundred percent pure.

NORMA: (YES) Mm hm. I-- You know, I think, um, parts like I had in "Divorcee" 
and "Strangers May Kiss"-- They're lots of fun to play. And I don't think the 
audiences mind a few missteps, you know, if you reform in the end.

LOUELLA: Well, I'm very glad you reform. 

NORMA: (CHUCKLES) 

LOUELLA: You certainly did give the world an illustrated idea of how to 
interest a wandering husband in "Divorcee."
 
NORMA: Now, Louella, I thought you weren't going to mention husbands in this 
interview.

LOUELLA: (CHUCKLES) Or babies? 

NORMA: (LAUGHS, CAN YOU SAY THAT ON RADIO?) Hey!

LOUELLA: That's all right. I'm sorry!

NORMA: You're forgiven. [...]
