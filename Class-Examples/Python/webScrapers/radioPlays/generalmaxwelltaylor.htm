<h1>General Maxwell Taylor</h1><pre>Youth Wants to Know
General Maxwell Taylor
Mar 18 1956


<u>PARTICIPANTS</u>:
ANNOUNCER
GENERAL MAXWELL TAYLOR, Chief of Staff, U. S. Army
STEPHEN McCORMICK, Moderator
GENERAL RUSSELL L. MAXWELL, National Security Industrial Association President
and a panel of youthful QUESTIONERS


<i>
The Announcer: YOUTH WANTS TO KNOW. The searching, provocative questions of 
today's young people, founded and produced by Theodore Granik.

And here is your moderator, Stephen McCormick.

Mr. McCormick: The primary mission of the United States Army today is to 
prevent war by deterring attack. To accomplish that mission, more than one 
million of our soldiers are stationed throughout the world. As Chief of Staff, 
General Maxwell Taylor commands the men and the might of our Army from 
Headquarters in the Pentagon here in Washington.

As a combat soldier he also has first-hand knowledge of the Army wartime 
mission, to defeat the enemy. 

On D-Day in 1944, General Taylor jumped with his airborne division in the 
Normandy Invasion. In the black stages of the Korean conflict he led the famed 
8th Army and then commanded United Nations and United States forces in the Far 
East.

General Taylor, it is a pleasure to have you with us on YOUTH WANTS TO KNOW.</i>

GENERAL TAYLOR: Thank you, I am glad to be with you. 

<i>Mr. McCormick: We have many questions for you. </i>

QUESTION: General Taylor, it has been recently stated that the military 
strength of the United States is inadequate to fulfill our military 
obligations to our allies throughout the world. Do you agree with this 
statement and would you care to comment on the subject? 

GENERAL TAYLOR: That is always a hard question to answer in less than a few 
paragraphs. Actually, when you look at the whole context of our national 
security, our Army, Navy and Air Force, I think we have a very substantial 
force to keep ourselves secure and our friends, too. 

QUESTION: Do you feel each division, the Army, the Navy and the Air Force are 
up to their full strength and potentialities which they each should have? 

GENERAL TAYLOR: If I say yes, I am complacent about the Army with which I am 
responsible for. Of course, I am not. I think we should always improve 
ourselves and should move forward constantly. 

QUESTION: General Taylor, what do you think about combining our forces with 
one air force? 

GENERAL TAYLOR: Well, that has a certain point, I must admit. However, bear in 
mind that the three services all have their history, their pride and their 
esprit, I would feel probably we would lose more if we tried to make the 
services like three peas in a pod, which really they are not. 

QUESTION: How important is service pride to this peacetime Army and our war 
time army? 

GENERAL TAYLOR: It is terribly important because men fight because they have 
pride in themselves, pride in their comrades and pride in their group. 

QUESTION: General, do you feel that if there is an all-out war in the future 
that atomic and nuclear weapons will be the deciding factor?

GENERAL TAYLOR: It is very hard to say whether it will be the deciding factor. 
I would say it will not be. The deciding factor will always be a man and not a 
thing.

QUESTION: In all-out atomic war, do you think the Infantry would be used 
defensively or would they have a definite offensive potential? 

GENERAL TAYLOR: As always they will be used in all types of roles and 
certainly in the end it will be an offensive role. 

QUESTION: Where we have a limited war like Korea, would atomic weapons be 
useful there or would they be only useful in all-out war? 

GENERAL TAYLOR: I don't like this word "limited" war, because it doesn't look 
limited to a soldier on a hill top in Korea. I would say we have a potential 
use for atomic weapons and very definitely in a small war.

<i>Mr. McCormick: You can't put them in the category perhaps of a small war and a 
large war?</i>

GENERAL TAYLOR: It is always a little dangerous to make categories. I will say 
we will decide how to use these weapons at the time, in the light of our 
national interests.

QUESTION: General, how near do you think the United States is to a war, big or 
small?

GENERAL TAYLOR: I am not able to judge that in terms of yards or miles. 
Certainly, we live in a world of tension where we must be strong.

QUESTION: General, what is the Army doing to increase mobility of its forces 
to cope with an atomic war?

GENERAL TAYLOR: We are very much impressed with the need to move faster, to 
get there "firstest" with the "mostest" men. You can see that in the 
helicopters and the airplanes which we have incorporated within the Army 
itself.

QUESTION: Does the Army want to have its own logistic and supply transport 
planes aside from the Air Force, of a larger caliber?

GENERAL TAYLOR: We do not want to compete with the Air Force, in their role of 
supporting us with large aircraft. What we need are planes that will move our 
soldiers, our weapons and supplies within our own battle area.

QUESTION: General, do you feel if an enemy attacked the continental United 
States, what part would the Infantry play and where would they be? Would they 
be attacking the enemy on their front or would they be defending the United 
States?

GENERAL TAYLOR: Bear in mind 40 percent of our Army is overseas and a great 
deal of its combat strength is right up against the Iron or the Bamboo 
Curtain. In the situation you indicate they will be fighting very hard 
overseas to keep the enemy at a distance. At home, of course, our anti-
aircraft use with the NIKE missile will be shooting down the enemy bomber as 
fast as they can.

QUESTION: Do you think the United States can afford a full and complete system 
of universal military training and service?

GENERAL TAYLOR: Of course, I believe deeply in the importance of universal 
military training. You put it rather on a cost basis which I am not prepared 
to discuss. I think, however, it would give us a source of strength we could 
hardly afford to be without.

QUESTION: Do you think that nuclear weapons could be used effectively in 
defense in this country if the enemy were within our borders? 

GENERAL TAYLOR: I never expect to see the enemy within our borders. That just 
isn't going to happen. 

QUESTION: You mentioned a moment ago that I believe 40 percent of the Army is 
overseas. Do you think that they are spread too thin? The rest of the world is 
a rather large place, if they are to do an effective job. 

GENERAL TAYLOR: They are in the most critical and strategic locations about 
the world. Whether they are enough or not always raises the question of how 
much is enough. It is a matter of judgment. 

QUESTION: Do you believe the budget this year sufficiently meets the needs of 
the Army? 

GENERAL TAYLOR: We have a budget which will give me a good Army this year. No 
Chief of Staff ever thinks he has enough money, however. 

QUESTION: Do you think that in the budget perhaps the Army is being sort of 
slighted in favor of the Air Force? 

GENERAL TAYLOR: All of the services, of course, feel that we have essential 
roles that must be supported. If you would ask the Chief of Staff of the Air 
Force you would probably get a similar answer to mine. I would say the needs 
of the Army have been considered by competent people and I think we can have a 
good Army with what we have. 

QUESTION: Talking about the strength of our Army, this new reserve program 
which would have boys enlist for six months active duty and then be in the 
reserves for 7 and a half years, that doesn't seem to be working out with the 
full momentum that many people realized. Can you give us any reason for that?

GENERAL TAYLOR: Well, I hope this program will be augmented by 7 at the end of 
this session. It will definitely be on the up-take.

QUESTION: What can the Army do to make it more appealing to these boys? What 
is the problem there? Why aren't the fellows enlisting? 

GENERAL TAYLOR: They are coming along much better. I am glad you asked the 
question because it is true the program got off to a small start but that is 
natural. Here was a brand new program which I am sure you didn't understand. 
We are getting 800 volunteers a week at the present time which still isn't 
enough, but it is much better. 

QUESTION: I was wondering if the Army is prepared to give men six months' 
active duty, why don't we do this with everybody and why do we draft people 
for two years? 

GENERAL TAYLOR: The man gets 6 months now and then he goes into the reserve 
for 7 and a half years where he continues his training, in a unit right in his 
home town. He is not a complete soldier by any manner of means when he gets 
out at six months.

QUESTION: Is this 7 and a half years absolutely necessary? I mean couldn't a 
soldier learn what he had to learn say in five years or four years.

GENERAL TAYLOR: It is not a question of his learning all this time. He reaches 
a point in his education where he is a useful potential defender in the United 
States. He can do a job. He has to stay eligible to do that job during a 
period of time so that the nation has the benefit of the defense represented 
by his strength.

QUESTION: I am about to graduate from high school. What advice would you give 
me as to whether to go to college or go in the Army now?

GENERAL TAYLOR: I would have to talk to you about what you intend to do, your 
family and all sorts of things. It is a separate problem for every boy. The 
Army has a variety of options and I think there is one that applies to you.

QUESTION: I notice a great deal of retired Army and Navy officers have taken 
jobs in industry. Does this mean that the armed forces members retire 
prematurely?

GENERAL TAYLOR: These people retire after 30 or 35 years of service. It is 
quite natural that when their forced retirement comes up they try to look 
around and try to serve their country in some other way.

QUESTION: Do you think the private industry competes with the Army for trained 
men with technical knowledge?

GENERAL TAYLOR: They do very definitely. When we train a man to have a 
valuable skill which is needed in industry, they compete with us.

QUESTION: What is the Army doing to increase the reenlistment rate in 
technical fields?

GENERAL TAYLOR: We are working constantly to increase re-enlistment in all 
fields. We realize to train a man is a big investment. Hence before his time 
is up we do everything we can to explain to him what his future will be if he 
stays with us.

<i>Mr. McCormick: Are you being successful in that?</i>

GENERAL TAYLOR: Very much so. The Army is actually going to be about 70 
percent professional in the next fiscal year. In other words, 70 percent will 
be volunteers, men who have chosen the Army and are not coming in through 
selective service.

QUESTION: Why is it generals who probably could do a great service for our 
country are forced to retire, when they want to continue?

GENERAL TAYLOR: We feel we have to have a cut-off point somewhere. War is a 
young man's game whether you like it or not. There is a place for age and 
experience but you must keep the vitality of young people like you gentlemen, 
coming up to the top.

QUESTION: Do the Army, Air Force and Navy all work together in their missile 
programs and all the other weapons or do they work separately?

GENERAL TAYLOR: We work very closely together. We all have slightly different 
jobs. In the missile field we are constructing missiles for slightly different 
purposes, but we exchange our information and give every help that is 
possible.

QUESTION: General Taylor, there are several recent articles about guided 
missiles and air power, like the one in this month's Reader's Digest. I was 
wondering, do you think too much attention is being paid to the Air Force and 
not enough to the Army?

GENERAL TAYLOR: I don't like to pick favorites in that because I feel both are 
terribly important. You can't neglect either one. The country needs to pay 
attention to all three of the services.

QUESTION: Do you feel our guided missile program is falling behind that of 
Russia? 

GENERAL TAYLOR: I wish I knew a lot of things about the guided missile program 
in Russia. All I know is that we are putting a great deal of effort into our 
own. 

QUESTION: When a big company wants to do a job like building a new automobile, 
they don't split it up into three divisions, but work as a unit. Couldn't it 
be worked out that the Air Force, Army and Navy combine and all work toward 
one goal for a missile?

GENERAL TAYLOR: That has an attractive sound, but you have to look into this. 
For instance, color television had two approaches for a number of years and 
eventually one will develop to be the better.

QUESTION: Speaking of new developments in the weapons field, when Senator 
Anderson, a member of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy was on our show, he 
said the United States possessed a plane that had flown for some minutes under 
atomic power exclusively. Now, what does the Army know about it that it can 
give out?

GENERAL TAYLOR: I know nothing about it that I can give out.

QUESTION: In [the] Reader's Digest article on guided missiles, I believe it 
was entitled "Guided Missiles--The Key to Peace," do you feel guided missiles 
might possibly be the key to peace? 

GENERAL TAYLOR: I do in this sense, that I feel all military strength is a 
deterrent against war. You made that comment in your opening announcement, and 
the missile as such contributes to that deterring power. If the other person 
knows you have a powerful weapon in the guided missile, he will be reluctant 
to start a war.

<i>Mr. McCormick: Gasses were important, though they were never used. Do you feel 
that as we move into bigger and stranger fields we might get to the point 
where they are never used?</i>

GENERAL TAYLOR: I think we must look to deterrents in all fields, in the air, 
on the sea and on the ground. My point has always been that you need a tri-
dimensional. You can't have it all in just one area.

QUESTION: Do you think it would be possible for us to conduct a war now 
without atomic weapons? I mean just have the countries ban these weapons. Or 
do you think when an enemy was asked to surrender, that they would surrender 
without using their atomic weapons? 

GENERAL TAYLOR: This is a very hard question to answer because it depends on 
lots of things you can't judge here. I will just say for the Army that we are 
prepared to fight with and without atomic weapons.

<i>Mr. McCormick: Does an enemy that is losing, General, reach into the bag of 
weapons and grab for most anything it has in order to stop losing?</i>

GENERAL TAYLOR: He might certainly, but as you stated in the case of gas, the 
Germans did not. Yet on the other hand, that may well have been because they 
had no delivery system when the decision was to be made. It is hard to know.

QUESTION: General, military experts seem to agree that Russia has a larger and 
stronger ground force than ours. Well, anyway, a larger one. And our air power 
is what offsets it in the case of a struggle. If a war develops in which 
nuclear weapons are not used, can the Army of the United States expect to beat 
that aggression without atomic support?

GENERAL TAYLOR: You lead off with a statement that I would challenge. You said 
military experts all agree. I have never seen that. It would depend on the 
circumstances. If you list all of the peoples on our side numerically, if you 
are talking about just a head count, you can find that we have very great 
potential strength on the ground if we want to use it.

QUESTION: But on the other hand, the Russian strength is pretty well developed 
right now. How do the armies compare as they are now?

GENERAL TAYLOR: Of course, our Army itself, we never want to try to compare 
division for division, on a head count. We think quality is equally and 
perhaps more important in this business than mere numbers. I would point out 
that our military aid programs through the years have been helping many 
countries develop potential strength to assist us and we will assist them.

QUESTION: Would you say now that the United States and their allies are a 
match for Russian forces without the use of atomic weapons.

GENERAL TAYLOR: It would be very hard to say, frankly. I would say it would be 
very difficult at this time not to use atomic weapons in some form.

QUESTION: General Taylor, do you see a time when you can conduct a war by 
pushing buttons?

GENERAL TAYLOR: I do not.

QUESTION: You feel that the ground force will always be prevalent?

GENERAL TAYLOR: All I would say is this. You will use ground forces either at 
the beginning, the middle or the end. I am sure of one thing, however, that 
they will be there at the end.

QUESTION: I was wondering how much our allies are helping us. Do you think 
they are doing their share in helping us train the foreign armies?

GENERAL TAYLOR: We are assisting on our side in training over 200 foreign 
divisions. We have an American Army detachment working directly or indirectly 
with that many foreign ground forces. So it is really a team operation, as I 
view it. We contribute something and they contribute something, all for the 
mutual defense of the free world.

QUESTION: General, how long will it take for the West German Army to be an 
effective force in NATO, and will it be?

GENERAL TAYLOR: It will take several years, undoubtedly. One cannot create an 
Army overnight. However, we are giving a great deal of help so that the German 
rate of development will be much faster than if they had to do all the work by 
themselves.

QUESTION: A great many people I think feel that the West Germans would not 
fight if East German troops were opposing them. Do you have any opinions on 
this subject? 

GENERAL TAYLOR: I don't think I would like to say except that I have the 
utmost confidence in the West Germans. 

QUESTION: General Taylor, you spoke a few moments ago about civil defense and 
you said you didn't expect us to be bombed by any country. Now, how efficient 
is our radar defense warning system in Alaska or throughout the north there? 

GENERAL TAYLOR: I think the enemy would like to hear my statement of that. We 
are working very hard, always, in improving it. 

QUESTION: How much warning time do you think we could have? 

GENERAL TAYLOR: There again I wouldn't like to quote an exact time. Obviously 
with the increased speed of weapons and missiles, that time factor becomes 
very close and very important.

<i>Mr. McCormick: I gather, General, you are working to the point where you can 
give us more warning time?</i>

GENERAL TAYLOR: Definitely. 

QUESTION: With these atomic missiles, do we have any real defense against 
them? 

GENERAL TAYLOR: Of course, there are many problems. It is a very tough 
technological problem in meeting the missile. However, I have the utmost 
confidence in the ability, ingenuity and inventiveness of our scientists and I 
say nothing is impossible. 

QUESTION: Do you think that this inventiveness shown by our scientists will 
come in time? Would it possibly come before the Russians could attack us?

GENERAL TAYLOR: Can you tell me when the Russians are going to attack us.

QUESTION: I don't know. It is merely a presumption.

GENERAL TAYLOR: All I can say is that that is the job of our top leadership, 
to see that we do pull together all the [re]sources of our country. The men in 
uniform, the scientists, the men with the slide rules, they must all combine 
to meet this possibility. 

QUESTION: How does the Pentagon keep Washington briefed on all this? 

GENERAL TAYLOR: It is true [through?] the general organization of the Federal 
Government--we are constantly reporting to the Secretary of Defense. The 
National Security Council is the clearing house for this top level sort of 
thing which is reported to the President.

<i>Mr. McCormick: It seems that you spend a great deal of time doing some 
briefing around Washington.</i>

GENERAL TAYLOR: Yes. 

<i>Mr. McCormick: Sometimes you have enough time to go over and do your own job, 
I gather.</i>

GENERAL TAYLOR: When we are not briefing someone else, someone else is 
briefing us.

QUESTION: Do you think liaison between the Pentagon and Capitol Hill is strong 
and clear enough?

GENERAL TAYLOR: I think you really ought to ask our friends on Capitol Hill. 
From my point of view, I would say it is.

QUESTION: General, I would like to ask a question that is possibly a little 
nasty. I would like to know why it has taken the Army ten years to develop a 
Redstone rocket which technical magazines say is only equivalent of what the 
Germans had in World War II, the V-II. It is nothing better than what the 
Germans had.

GENERAL TAYLOR: You have been reading the wrong magazine. 

QUESTION: This was in Aviation Magazine.

GENERAL TAYLOR: You are still wrong, that the Redstone Missile is not a better 
missile than the V-II. The V-II could sometimes hit the City of London, but 
had some difficulty, there.

QUESTION: What progress are you making in your guided missiles and in your 
artillery missiles?

GENERAL TAYLOR: Going back to the Missile question, when 1945 came and Germany 
surrendered, the Army immediately took the very best brains of the V-II and 
have had them working with our missile people ever since. That is the reason 
for our primary position in the missiles field, today.

QUESTION: I understand the Russians also got some of those experts. Is that 
just because they happened to be in the geographical location the Russians 
reached first?

GENERAL TAYLOR: I am sure the Russians did everything they could to seize all 
the talented German people they could. Fortunately, their success was limited.

QUESTION: You think we got more and better scientists than they did?

GENERAL TAYLOR: I don't know their team very well. I just know we have a good 
one.

QUESTION: I have heard so much about brain washing techniques and torture and 
everything. Do you think that you personally could have withstood any brain 
washing or torture techniques?

GENERAL TAYLOR: I wouldn't venture to say. That would be too presumptuous for 
me to say. I just know many brave soldiers did. 

QUESTION: What about the military courts that judge men or put a sentence on a 
man or an officer because he is broken during this torture or has talked? How 
does a soldier know that he is going to be the one to break?

GENERAL TAYLOR: He never knows in advance until the time comes, unfortunately.

QUESTION: Do you think it is possible to train a soldier to withstand brain 
washing?

GENERAL TAYLOR: I would say that the Army has a part in that, to make every 
effort to toughen the moral and the mental outlook of our soldiers, but let me 
tell you where the real training takes place. It is in your homes, your 
churches and the schools where you are going. You are developing right now the 
ability to do that job. Ask yourselves how you will react.

QUESTION: Is something being done now by the Army to help men withstand this, 
or to test soldiers to see whether or not they will withstand possible brain 
washing? 

GENERAL TAYLOR: The first thing we try to tell soldiers is never be taken 
prisoner. It is worse than death to be a prisoner of the Communists. After 
that we give such advice and training as we can. As I say, the fundamental 
work is done before the boy gets into the Army.

QUESTION: Is there any way that the Army and the armed services can tell when 
a man is fit to go into combat and fit to withstand brain washing? Is there 
any sorting device that we have in operation?

GENERAL TAYLOR: All we can do is take a man for four months and give him the 
best kind of training we know how to do. There is no way of evaluating a man's 
morale, except in very general terms, his endurance and character. We never 
yet have gotten blue litmus paper that we can hold up to a man and say "You 
will resist."

<i>Mr. McCormick: It would be wise if some system could be evolved to determine 
whether a man would not be able to take combat or whether a man could take 
combat. I suppose it is just about impossible.</i>

GENERAL TAYLOR: It is very, very difficult because it involves all the 
measurements of the imponderables of human character for which there are no 
means of evaluation. 

QUESTION: Do you think that the Code that the Army has set up for prisoners of 
war who do have the misfortune to be captured is adequate and a good code and 
a fair one? 

GENERAL TAYLOR: I think that is a very fine code and I hope you will read that 
over reflectively. A lot of experienced people put many, many weeks into 
developing the language of that code. Again, it involves deep principles and 
merely memorizing the code won't do the job. It is really living by the 
principles that counts. 

QUESTION: Is every soldier expected to live up to this code under the stress 
of torture? 

GENERAL TAYLOR: We certainly hope all our soldiers will.

QUESTION: Isn't it true, General, as many psychologists have said, that 
different men have different breaking points and are able to stand different 
types of torture? Just as one person might be a better ball player than 
another? Because of that, is it fair to court martial men because they do not 
have the stamina to withhold information?

GENERAL TAYLOR: I agree with you on the point that men do vary, but I also 
hope that our codes of justice, our courts, are broad enough and able to take 
cognizance of all of those factors so that every case is a special case. 

QUESTION: General, do you think that our military aid to other countries is 
adequate, now? 

GENERAL TAYLOR: "Adequate" goes back to the question of how much is enough. It 
takes a great deal of help to keep these nations we are assisting going 
forward in their military progress. Progress is important to us because it 
adds to the deterrent effect which we said is so important. Each year for a 
long time in my judgment, we are going to have to assist certain of our 
allies. 

QUESTION: General Taylor, do you think we should recognize the petition of 
Israel for arms or that we should do something about it? 

GENERAL TAYLOR: You are getting out of my field, now. I think I should refer 
that to my friends in the State Department.

QUESTION: To get back to Dave's question, how much is too much aid and how do 
we know when to stop giving aid? How do we know when our allies' forces are 
adequate?

GENERAL TAYLOR: We must decide what we think those forces would accomplish. 
For example, in one given country we should be sure they have enough strength 
to maintain internal security, for example. Then we have our missions 
assisting them in these countries and then we look to the head man who is a 
qualified officer, carefully selected, to give us an opinion, having reached 
that level for which we are shooting.

QUESTION: Would the Army set up what we might call a blue print or cooperate 
with the State Department or does it do it alone?

GENERAL TAYLOR: On the aid program? 

QUESTION: Yes.

GENERAL TAYLOR: It is a highly integrated affair in which the State Department 
is very much involved, all the services are involved. The Department of 
Defense really steers the whole program in so far as the purely military 
aspects are concerned.

QUESTION: I am coming up to the point where I will either be drafted or go in 
the service. I would like to know how a boy my age can know whether it would 
be better to go in the Army, the Air Force or in the Navy.

GENERAL TAYLOR: I believe it is a question of desire and where your interests 
lie. And you should also go and talk to the representatives of the three 
services who can tell you about what will happen to you when you go in the 
services.

QUESTION: I guess it is pretty easy for the Air Force to get a recruiting 
program going: just throw a fast-flying plane at them. What is the Army doing?

GENERAL TAYLOR: You had better go around and see. You will find the Air Force 
has many strange and odd jobs just as the Army does. I think it is always 
sometimes easy to pick out, say, the fast-flying airplane, the diving 
submarine or the rolling tank and think that that is all of the three services 
represented. There are lots of things that could come up in the services.

<i>Mr. McCormick: I wish we had more time, but I find our time is up. 

We certainly do thank you, General Taylor, Army Chief of Staff, for being with 
us here today and answering the youngsters' questions. Do come back and see us 
soon.</i>

GENERAL TAYLOR: It has been a pleasure to be here. I am glad to know that 
Youth does want to know.

<i>Mr. McCormick: And now I would like you to meet General Russell L. Maxwell, 
United States Army, Retired, President of the National Security Industrial 
Association, and vice-president of the American Machine and Foundry Company, 
in charge of personnel.</i>

GENERAL MAXWELL: The increased curiosity of the young men and women on this 
program is admirable. In a very few years they will have the responsibility of 
providing answers to a new generation.

That generation may well ask "Why are we as a nation so lacking in the special 
skills our age must have? The increasing demand for experts is now apparent 
and will become more intense. It is a problem of special concern to the 
Department of Defense and to industry whose needs in that field increase 
daily. 

Efforts to solve these problems are a part of the special activities of the 
industry defense team which has been the bulwark of our national preservation. 
Working together, our Army, Navy and Air Force have organizations such as the 
National Security Industrial Association, comprising 600 industrial concerns, 
continuously seeking answers to such complex problems. Through NSIA, industry 
makes available to the Department of Defense without cost the skills, 
knowledge and experience of civilian experts in every field. Men dedicated to 
the task, together with our Armed forces as partners in defense, aiming 
towards one goal, a nation secure.
