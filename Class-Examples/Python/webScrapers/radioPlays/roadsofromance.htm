<h1>Roads of Romance</h1><pre>ROADS OF ROMANCE No. 14
 
BEVERLY SMITH LATHAM, NBC.
 
August 19, 1931 

ANNOUNCER: <u>Roads of Romance!</u> This weekly presentation of the Chicago Motor 
Club, Roads of Romance, comes to you every Wednesday night at this time. One 
hundred thousand members of the Chicago Motor Club in Illinois and Indiana 
invite you to listen in on these weekly excursions. 

The Chicago Motor Club maintains sixty-two branch offices in sixty-two 
counties of Illinois and Indiana for the convenience of its members. It is the 
only motor club in this territory affiliated with the American Automobile 
Association. 

Members receive emergency road service at any hour of the day or night; bail 
bond service which is recognized by arresting officers in this territory, and 
tourist information. Remember, there is the insurance service, which every 
year has returned to policy holders in cash more than twenty per cent of the 
amount they have paid for their insurance. This policy protects you anywhere 
in the United States or Canada. These are a few of the direct benefits to 
members. Safety work in the schools, representation at the legislature, and 
work in behalf of more roads and wider roads, are some of the benefits every 
motorist in this territory enjoys. Throughout the United States and Canada, 
Chicago Motor Club members receive the service of the more than one thousand 
motor clubs affiliated with the American Automobile Association. And here is 
an important announcement. The club now changes tires for <u>all</u> members.
Formerly this service was limited to women members. Membership in the Chicago 
Motor Club is an investment in motoring security and comfort. One hundred 
thousand motorists <u>can't</u> be wrong!

Tonight we find Dick Jackson seeking information on the Upper Peninsula of 
Michigan from his friend, Henry Rhodes, the man who has driven a million miles 
in his automobile.
 
(Music)
 
DICK: The Upper Peninsula of Michigan has been described to me, Henry, as one 
of our last frontiers. Now, I am suspicious of such a description. I've been 
to regions claiming everything primeval except dinosaurs, only to find that I 
had to make six or eight changes of clothing a day in order to be regarded as 
civilized. So I come to you for the truth about this northern part of 
Michigan. 

HENRY: True, Dick, the term "last frontier" frequently is used ill-advisedly, 
to say the least. But the U.P., as the Upper Peninsula of Michigan commonly is 
known, is one of our genuine last frontiers. You'll find no gilded ballrooms 
nor finger bowls there, old man. From Ironwood on the west to St. Ignace and 
Sault Ste. Marie on the east, the country mainly is wooded with high second 
growth timber, spotted here and there by majestic virgin forests. 

DICK: I've heard that there are lots of deer and bear throughout that country, 
Henry.
 
HENRY: Right, and it is altogether probable that you may see a deer. And 
possibly a bear, although bears are more retiring. No need to worry. They're 
harmless, unless you threaten them. And even then, I think they would run.
 
DICK: I suppose I could camp most anywhere up there, Henry? 

HENRY: Just about anywhere, Dick. There are three national forests in the 
U.P., and many other free camping localities. Now, if you want to put up in 
hotels, you'll find excellent accommodations in such cities as Escanaba, 
Ironwood, Marquette and Sault Ste. Marie. Each of those cities boasts a 
population of about 15,000. There are many smaller towns which offer good 
facilities. 

DICK: I suppose I'll see quite a few lumber camps and iron mines. 

HENRY: Well, Dick, much of this country was logged when you and I were boys.  
So, today, they're not logging much in the sections traversed by highways.  
The lumber camps are mainly in the remote sections, where most of the virgin 
timber is to be found. As for iron mines, you'll see plenty of shafts in the 
area lying west of Escanaba and Marquette. In general, the country east of 
those cities is wooded, with farms here and there.
 
DICK: I'm sure it will be a great trip. I shall follow United States route 41 
from Chicago to Milwaukee; Wisconsin route 57 from Milwaukee to Green Bay, 
where I pick up U. S. 41 again and follow it to Menominee, the gateway to the 
upper peninsula. From Menominee I shall head for Escanaba and the 
comparatively unsettled country north of there.
 
HENRY: Ah--Escanaba. I recall that Janet Mansfield was there some years ago. 
You knew her, didn't you, Dick?
 
DICK: I'll say I did ... One of the prettiest girls who ever went to a Prom 
when <u>I</u> was in school.
 
HENRY: She's a mighty fine girl, too, as well as being a pretty picture. Well 
sir ... I'll never forget the story she told me one time about her adventures 
in this same country you're about to visit. 

DICK: Janet? Say, what was it?
 
HENRY: Well, you see, Dick ... after Janet made her debut in New York--and 
shocked <u>my</u> generation with a few of her stunts--quite proper, but "daring" we 
called it then ... why she fell in love----or rather <u>thought</u> she fell in love
--with a man named Morton Travis. Then, when he was sent on some sort of 
expedition up into the Michigan woods, she shocked even her own set, by going

(Fade in music slowly) 

along--she and the wife of one of the men being the only women in the party. 
One day, when they had got up around Escanaba.
 
(Music concludes) 

MORTON: Now about this business of you going on with us, Janet. 

JANET: Must we talk about it now, Morton? 

MORTON: Well, we're leaving--
 
JANET: I know. So you've told me. <u>And I'm going</u>. But, Morton--tonight--the 
moon is so lovely; the night so charming, can't we talk about something else? 
Or just sit maybe? 

MORTON: Listen, Janet, we're on government business--this isn't a frolic. If 
you like Michigan so well, then you can come back another time.
 
JANET: I will.
 
MORTON: But I'm leary of taking you on with us now. We are going farther north 
and west--into little explored regions. Quite different from the glorious 
section that you've been seeing. Of course, it's wonderful country all right, 
but we can't turn back if you decide that you're not as comfortable as you 
<u>should</u> be. And besides-- Say, are you listening to me? 

JANET: Er ... er....  Why, of course I am. 

MORTON: What did I say.
 
JANET: (Glibly)  That I'm a tourist; that I love this country so much that---

MORTON: Oh lord!
 
JANET: That I've spent a month here roaming around; that I'm not used to camp 
life yet, but I like to sit out in the open at night like this and enjoy the 
campfire and--that you have a silly notion I won't stand the trip as well as 
you do--<u>and</u>----

MORTON: Enough ... enough! (Much peeved) I see that you refuse to listen to 
reason--as usual.
 
JANET: You know, Morton, I think you are going to be angry again. I'm learning 
to spot the symptoms. And please don't, 'cause it's a beautiful night and I <u>do</u> 
want to enjoy it. ...  If that dreadful work of yours takes you into country 
like this, why I might enjoy being married to a geologist. 

MORTON: Wha--what!?

JANET: I said that I'm going to enjoy being married to you-- (archly) maybe! 

MORTON: Well, I <u>hope</u> you do! 

JANET: If and when we're married. 

MORTON: What?
 
JANET: Nothing. Mrs. Adams is making the whole trip, isn't she? 

MORTON: Yes, but--

JANET: Then if she's going, I don't see why <u>I</u> shouldn't. I'll chaperone her 
and her husband! How is that?
 
MORTON: You're the one who needs a chaperone, Janet. 

JANET: Then I'm going?

MORTON: Looks like it.
 
JANET: Hurrah! You know, that takes a great worry off my mind. Good old Mrs. 
Adams needs a chaperone. ... Oh--oh, here she comes now.
  
MORTON: (Whispers)  Well, be quiet won't you!
 
JANET: (Whispers) Certainly, m'lord. And if the moon were an inch bigger, I'd 
kiss you! (raising her voice) Come over, Mrs. Adams.

MRS. ADAMS: (Coming up) That's a nice fire you have. 

MORTON: Isn't it? Sit down, Mrs. Adams....  Here.... 

JANET: Morton has decided that we are good "roughers", Mrs. Adams ... or, at 
least, that <u>I</u> am. He never doubted <u>you</u>; and he's consented to let me go with 
you. 

MRS. ADAMS: That's splendid. I'm only too glad to have company, Janet dear.
 
JANET: Even if it is I, eh? 

MRS. ADAMS: Well, no--

MORTON: (Interrupting) But there is to be no foolishness. This is a business 
trip--

JANET: (Also breaking in; sotto voice) Government business.

MORTON: Yes, government business. And once we're started there can be no 
turning back. You must understand that. We are going into wild country and if 
you--

JANET: All together, boys. (With Mrs. Adams) WE PROMISE NOT TO TURN BACK! 
(Both laugh heartily)
 
(Music in full few seconds then out)
 
(Scene opens with party riding horseback along rough trail)
 
JANET: This <u>is</u> a wild trail, isn't it, Johnson?
 
JOHNSON: Yes, Miss Mansfield, it is that. (Horse stumbles) Careful there.
 
JANET: Easy, Prince, easy....
 
JOHNSON: Better take it easy through here ... much better going ahead, and 
we'll catch up with the rest of them easy if they leave us behind.
 
JANET: They're not far. I can see Morton from here. (Horse stumbles again) 
Easy, Prince, old boy ... that's it ... that's it, old man. Fancy calling this 
poor horse Prince! 

JOHNSON: He used to be a good horse in his day. 

MORTON: (Calls from distance)  How are you back there? All right?

JANET: (Calls) Fine. We're coming! (To Johnson) Well, adventure is what--
(Horse stumbles: Janet screams).
 
JOHNSON: Look out. (Calls) Hold on! Janet's horse is down! (To Janet, who 
groans) Just a minute, Miss Mansfield. You hurt?

MORTON: (Coming up) Just what I warned her against.

JANET: (Calmly) Don't worry.... 

MORTON: (More sympathetic) Are you badly hurt, Janet?

JANET: No ... not at all, Morton.... Help me to my horse.

JOHNSON: Here. I'll give you a hand.
 
(Business of helping her to her feet: groan of pain escapes Janet)
 
MRS. ADAMS: (Coming up) Oh, she's hurt. Poor dear! 
 
JANET: (Trying not to cry) I hurt my ankle.

MORTON: Badly, Janet?
 
JANET: Yes, I'm afraid so, Morton.
 
JOHNSON: Want to see if you can stand on it, Miss Mansfield?
 
JANET: Yes ... ! (Pause, then groan) Ohhhh! I can't. I'm sorry, Morton.
 
MORTON: (Genuinely sympathetic) Don't worry, dear. It's all right. Here, we'll 
fix this ankle up and make camp here. 

MRS. ADAMS: Let's do. I'll ride ahead and bring the others back. 

JOHNSON: This ain't such a good place to camp, Perfessor. 

JANET: I can go on, Morton.
 
MORTON: No you can't. We'll have to stop for awhile, I suppose. I hate to 
think of leaving you, and--

JOHNSON: There's a cabin a bit farther on, sir. I seen it before. 

MRS. ADAMS: A cabin? In this wilderness! 

JANET: Surely I could get <u>that</u> far, Morton. 

MORTON: Well....
 
JOHNSON: It's a pretty tumble-down place, but better'n campin' <u>here</u>. What dya 
say, Perfessor?
 
MORTON: All right, Johnson ... you know the way, lead us to it. You can ride 
ahead and stop the others. 

JOHNSON: All right, sir.
 
MORTON: But I'm afraid we'll have to give up the trip. I can't leave Janet 
alone, even for one day.
 
MRS. ADAMS: Let me stay with you here. You folks go on. 

JOHNSON: Safe enough up here, Perfessor.
 
JANET: Yes, Morton ... you must go on ... please! I should hate myself if you 
didn't.
  
MORTON: (Musing) We could leave Johnson with you for a few days.
 
MRS. ADAMS: No, you'll need Johnson. Without him to guide you, you'd all get 
lost probably, and then where would we be? 

MORTON: Maybe I could send him back....
 
JANET: No ... really, Morton, with a cabin and all we'll feel quite safe. I'm 
not a bit afraid, are you, Mrs. Adams? 

MRS. ADAMS: Not in the least!
 
MORTON: All right....  We'll talk it over later. Let's be off to that cabin, 
Johnson.
 
(Music--in full for few seconds then out) 

(There is absolute silence for several seconds)
 
MRS. ADAMS: (Whisper) Wha--what's that? Janet ... Jane ... wake up!
 
JANET: (Sleepily) What is it?

MRS. ADAMS: I thought I heard something. 

JANET: Oh ... uh ... nothing. 

MRS. ADAMS: Listen!
 
JANET: (Awake, she mechanically whispers also) I can't hear anything. I wonder 
what time it is.
 
(Small crash as though something knocked over)
 
MRS. ADAMS: (Screams) 

JANET: Who's there? ...  What do you want? 

MRS. ADAMS: A man!!! 

GABRIEL: Good lord, a woman ... two of 'em! 

JANET: What do you want here?
 
GABRIEL: How the devil----! How the devil did you two get <u>here</u>?
 
MRS. ADAMS: Well ... of all the---

JANET: We came up with a geology party. I hurt my ankle and they had to leave 
us behind. 

GABRIEL: Where'd they go?
 
JANET: North ... to the best of <u>my</u> knowledge. Is this your cabin?
 
GABRIEL: When do you expect them back?
 
MRS. ADAMS: I never heard such nerve. Get out of here--at once, sir!
 
JANET: Be quiet, Mrs. Adams. (To man) We don't expect them back for several 
days yet.  And say--if you're going to stay awhile, light a candle or 
something.
 
MRS. ADAMS: (A great gasp) Oooooh!
 
JANET: You'll burn your fingers striking so many matches. 

MRS. ADAMS: Janet ... what <u>are</u> you saying? 

GABRIEL: Thanks ... only I don't have a candle. 

JANET: Well, I can't do it for him.
 
GABRIEL: I left a candle here....  Yep, here it is. (Brief pause) (A bit away 
from mike) Hurt yourself you say? 

JANET: Yes, my horse stumbled ... caught my ankle. 

MRS. ADAMS: Listen, young man, what are you doing here I'd like to know?
 
GABRIEL: (Coming back up)  Well, when a man comes back to his cabin in the 
middle of the night ... off in a place like this ... and finds two women in 
it, that's just about the first question <u>he'd</u> ask!

MRS. ADAMS: (More alarmed than ever)  Oh, is ... is this your cabin?
 
GABRIEL: Yes, right now it is.
 
JANET: Then I wish you'd clean it up occasionally. 

GABRIEL: I'll be glad to for you, Miss ... Miss.... 

JANET: Mansfield.... Janet Mansfield. 

MRS. ADAMS: Janet! 

GABRIEL: And your lady friend, is she ... a ... a ... Miss, too? 

JANET: You're impertinent. No, she's <u>Mrs</u>. Adams. 

GABRIEL: Where are you two from?
 
JANET: New York City.... (Sarcastically) Is there anything else, your honor?

MRS. ADAMS: And <u>Mr</u>. Adams is here too! 

GABRIEL: You're a long way from home. 

JANET: I know it. Only too well at the moment. 

GABRIEL: You needn't be afraid of me.... 

JANET: Don't worry, I'm not.
 
GABRIEL: Well, then, I wish you weren't so pale ... both of you. Look like you 
might be scared to death.
 
MRS. ADAMS: (Laughs nervously) We're not ... I--I'm not, anyhow!
 
GABRIEL: Good.... Then I'll sleep. Might give me one of those blankets.
  
MRS. ADAMS: (With great alacrity) Here you are ... here you are. 

GABRIEL: Thanks.
 
JANET: You'd better sleep in here....
 
MRS. ADAMS: Why, Janet, you're mad.... The <u>idea</u> of such a thing! 

GABRIEL: No, thanks. I'll be comfortable outside. (Going off) Be right here by 
the door. Good night. (Closes door). 

MRS. ADAMS: Well of all things! What do you suppose he is, a forester?
 
JANET: I don't know.
 
MRS. ADAMS: My, but he frightened me. Do you suppose he's a ranger or 
something?
 
JANET: (Musing) Yes ... I suppose so. But there was a look in his eyes that 
... 

MRS. ADAMS: That what?
 
JANET: Oh nothing.... Only I thought I had seen him before somewhere ... his 
picture maybe ... recently. 

(Music in for few moments then out) 

GABRIEL: Where's the Missis?

JANET: Mrs. Adams? ... Oh, she's gone to bed, I think. 

GABRIEL: Doesn't like sitting around the camp-fire, eh? 

JANET: Sometimes....
 
GABRIEL: I'm afraid she doesn't like me. Is that it? 

JANET: But she does! She thinks you're very nice ... to wait on her and 
everything.
 
GABRIEL: Yes ... but I said I must be off at once, and here I've been fooling 
around for three days. Your party should be back in the morning, shouldn't 
they? 

JANET: They <u>should</u> ... yes.
 
GABRIEL: And you ... <u>you're</u> afraid of me, aren't you? 

JANET: I?

GABRIEL: I can see it. You think you know who I am, don't you? 

JANET: I don't think, I <u>know</u> who you are ... now. 

GABRIEL: You know? (Laughs) How?

JANET: And I'm <u>not</u> afraid.
 
GABRIEL: What makes you think you know me, Miss Mansfield?

JANET: I saw your picture--the reward notice--at the railroad station. 

GABRIEL: So they've got round to that already, have they? 

JANET: I remembered your face.
 
GABRIEL: Well, I trust you, Miss Mansfield. But don't tell <u>her</u>.
 
JANET: Why not?
 
GABRIEL: A thousand dollars reward is a big temptation, you know. 

JANET: I won't tell her. 

GABRIEL: Thanks.
 
JANET: And even if I did, the reward wouldn't mean anything. If we gave you 
up--to ... to the authorities--it would not be for money, but because you are 
a criminal.
 
GABRIEL: (Vehemently) But I'm not, Miss Mansfield, honest I'm not. I want you 
to believe me. I never stole a cent ... not a cent!
 
JANET: Then it's strange that---

GABRIEL: I didn't get a penny from the express company. And I wouldn't have 
tried it, only I was drunk--and desperate. I needed money and I needed it bad. 
 
JANET: You'd go well on Broadway. 

GABRIEL: What's that?
 
JANET: I said you'd go well on Broadway; I mean you'd make a good actor.
 
GABRIEL: Well ... if <u>that's</u> the way you feel about it ... 

JANET: What did you need the money for?
 
GABRIEL: Why I ... I.... You see, my mother was sick and--

JANET: (Laughing heartily) More heroics! Tell me the truth; the papers said 
you did it for a girl ...
 
GABRIEL: All right then, I <u>did</u>! I <u>did</u> do it for a girl. And when the showdown 
came and I was on the run she threw me over. Told everything she knew ... and 
here I am hunted to death on account of it.
 
JANET: That doesn't seem to have worried you much. You've been loafing here 
quite leisurely for three days now. 

GABRIEL: It does look funny, doesn't it? 

JANET: Why <u>did</u> you do it?

GABRIEL: It's kinder hard to explain. I know I should be saving my own skin, 
but--

JANET: (Laughs) Oh, I didn't mean that. I meant--why did you commit the 
robbery!

GABRIEL: Oh ... well, I <u>told</u> you that. Account of a girl. 

JANET: I see....
 
GABRIEL: But, you know, Miss Mansfield ... I never knew girls that talked like 
you before. Honest, I like to hear you talk. And I like the way you laugh ... 
everything. You're a real girl, Miss Mansfield. I'd do anything for a woman 
like you. You ... you're worth dying for! 

JANET: Whe-e-w!  And that's that! 

GABRIEL: You're still making fun of me.
 
JANET: (Suddenly serious) You shouldn't talk to me like this, young man.
 
GABRIEL: I'm sorry....

JANET: As I told you, if we turned you over to the authorities--

GABRIEL: But you're not, are you ... ? You can't!

JANET: Why can't I? 

GABRIEL: I thought I could trust you. 

JANET: And make love to me, too?
 
GABRIEL: I meant it. And I said I was sorry; it just slipped out, Miss 
Mansfield.
 
JANET: You needn't be sorry... except... well, I think it's mighty nice of you 
to say these things. But go, will you? You'd better not stay here and let them 
find you.... Or, would you rather take your punishment and get it over with 
... start new? 

GABRIEL: I never thought of that.  But if <u>you</u> wanted me to---

JANET: (Feigning indifference) Oh no.... I'm not interested in what you do, 
not the least ... only I don't want you to run any risks on my account. If the 
sheriff's anywhere around, you'd better be careful.
 
GABRIEL: Do you want me to go, Miss Mansfield? 

JANET: For your own good, yes.... 

GABRIEL: Then, I will ... in the morning, early. 

JANET: Shall we see you before you leave?
 
GABRIEL: No, I'll be leaving pretty early ... so, I want to tell you good-bye 
now ... Janet. 

JANET: Good-bye?

GABRIEL: Yes ... good-bye.... Say, you're really engaged to that perfessor, 
aren't you?

JANET: No, not exactly--not yet.
 
GABRIEL: Well, just the same he sure is a fool to leave you here alone--with a 
bum ankle and everything. I'm leaving, Janet--you don't mind, do you? I'm 
leaving ... Janet ... and so I can tell you --if I ever could call you mine, 
I'd never leave you alone for a single second. I can't understand these city 
fellows ... no sir.  They don't appreciate women any more than they 
appreciate the sunset... Why, if I had any place to take you, I'd steal you 
right now!

JANET: Then I'd better go in before I'm abducted! Good-bye.... (From 
distance) And Gabriel---! 

GABRIEL: Yes?
 
JANET: I'm sorry you have no place to take me. (Door slams--off) 

GABRIEL: (To himself) ... Lord, what a fool I've been ... and yet, if I hadn't 
been I'd never have met <u>her</u>. ...  I bet she thinks I'm a fool....  Janet ... 
Janet Mansfield.... 

(Music in few seconds then out)
 
MORTON: I'm really sorry about this, Janet.  But you see we couldn't spare 
Johnson and the extra day we took up there meant a lot---
 
JANET: Don't worry, Morton. We were very well protected, weren't we, Mrs. 
Adams?
 
MRS. ADAMS: Yes, indeed. That ranger fellow--or whatever he was--treated us 
most kindly.

MORTON: Strange, that. Owns this cabin, you say? 

JANET: No. Not owns it, but uses it. 

MORTON: Then it's not his, eh? Strange that. 

JANET: I don't see why. 

MORTON: Sa-a-ay!
 
MRS. ADAMS: What's the matter?
 
MORTON: Back on the trail a bit we met a sheriff who's on the trail of an 
outlaw. Do you suppose---?

MRS. ADAMS: An outlaw? Oh, my dear.

JANET: Ridiculous. This man was very kind to us. Very considerate of the 
<u>weaker</u> sex, Morton.
 
MRS. ADAMS: He <u>really</u> was. Such a nice gentleman. But---

MORTON: Janet, what do you know about this man?
 
JANET: Nothing. Nothing except that he uses this cabin; and ... and ... has 
some sort of work up here in this wilderness.
 
(Knock at door) 

MORTON: Hell-o. Who's this? (Opens door)

GABRIEL: Good evening, folks. 

JANET: Gabriel!

MRS. ADAMS: That's him! He's come back! 

MORTON: Are you the man who occupies this cabin?

GABRIEL: Why, yes....  I have been.
 
JANET: I thought you had gone. The ... the ... sheriff is near. 

MORTON: So ... you're the man--

JANET: Close that door, Morton.

MORTON: All right, Janet, but----(Closes door)

GABRIEL: I know he's coming ... and I'm leaving the back way ... 

MRS. ADAMS: He <u>is</u> the bandit! Oh, dear, oh dear, etc.

MORTON: What does this mean? ... Janet?

JANET: Why did you come back? 

GABRIEL: I never left, Miss Janet. I wanted to see you ... that is, to see you 
were safe.

(Noise of men heard outside door) 

JANET: They're here. Quick! Out the back!

MORTON: Don't you move, you fool.... You'll not get out of here if I know 
anything about it. 

JANET: Get out of the way, Morton.
 
MORTON: Are you crazy, Janet? (Mrs. Adams is ad. libbing moans etc.) Shut up, 
Mrs. Adams!
 
JANET: Here, Gabriel, out this way.
 
(Door opens and slams)
 
MORTON: (Much excited) Janet, you can't do this.

JANET: He's a gentleman, Morton. And don't you dare to tell them that he's 
been here.  

(Knocks on door)
 
JANET: Let them in! 

(Brief pause when knock is repeated: then door opens)
 
MORTON: Come in! 

SHERIFF: Where is he? He was here ... come on, what did you do with him?
 
JANET: (Feigning surprise) Why, there's no one here but our party. What do you 
mean by--
 
SHERIFF: (More politely) Sorry, Miss. Thought we saw him comin' this way.
 
JANET: Well, he didn't.
 
MORTON: Through the back, Sheriff. He just left! Hurry....

SHERIFF: So! Come men, follow me! (Men rush through door)
 
JANET: (Calm and very stern) Morton! Why <u>did</u> you----(Breaks off) 

MORTON: What would you have me do, Janet ... ? 

(Several gun shots are heard in distance: Mrs. Adams screams)
 
JANET: They've shot him! 

MORTON: Serves him right! 

MRS. ADAMS: Is he killed?
 
MORTON: (Off a bit) Doesn't look serious; I can see them from here. Looks like 
they got him in the leg.
 
SHERIFF: (Calls from distance) Nothing serious, folks. 

MORTON: Need any help?
 
SHERIFF: (Closer, but still away from mike)  Nope ... guess not. He didn't 
fight ... just fired one shot in the air. We'll be off now; sorry to bother 
you folks.
 
MORTON: That's all right. 

(Janet moans softly)

MORTON: Come, Janet ... don't cry.  I know this is beastly for you. And we 
shall get away from here at once---

MRS. ADAMS: And it's high time we did, too! 

MORTON: Then--back to New York!

JANET: (Musing) Shot in the air ... and waited.

MORTON: What did you say, dear? 

JANET: Nothing.

MORTON: Let's get back to New York, Janet. Then I'll take a long vacation-- 

JANET: It won't be necessary, Morton--on my account. 

MORTON: Why ... why ... well ... well ... say! 

JANET: I've decided, Morton, that I don't want to be a geologist's wife. 

MORTON: You mean---?
 
JANET: Now, Morton, please don't have a broken heart. It's bad form; really it 
is. It's enough for me to have this sprained ankle. 

MORTON: Janet! What's happened to you?

JANET: I slept in the light of the moon, probably. 

MORTON: And you really mean---

JANET: That I don't love you--any more than you do me. And that I'm not going 
back with you. I shall spend a few more days in this glorious country ... 
seeing it, smelling it, living it ... then, after I've talked to that sheriff 
I'm going back to New York for awhile.

MRS. ADAMS: The child's mad! 

MORTON: Why "for awhile"?
 
JANET: Yes ... for awhile. You know ... sometimes I think I would like to be 
married to an outlaw. It might be thrilling, and I love the west.
  
(Music in full few seconds then out) 

DICK: But, Henry, Janet Mansfield didn't marry any such fellow. Why--I 
remember reading about the wedding when it happened--about five years ago.  
And she married that fellow ... er ... er ... Thompson ... Jimmie Thompson, 
that's his name. 

HENRY: Yes, she did.
 
DICK: He went to school with me ... couple of classes ahead of me. But I don't 
understand your story.
 
HENRY: Well, Dick, you know Janet. And you know she has a lot of sense. She 
didn't <u>marry</u> the outlaw. She just made a man out of him, kept her heart 
intact, and turned it over to Jimmie Thompson--one of the wealthiest men in 
Michigan. And when you're on your trip--going up--you'll see their summer 
home. It's one of the show places in that part of the country. And Gabriel--
well, some day, Dick, when we have more time, I'll tell you the rest of <u>his</u> 
story, too.
 
(Music in at once)
 
Closing Announcement:
   
You have just listened to "Roads of Romance," a weekly presentation of the 
Chicago Motor Club.
   
Remember that Chicago Motor Club members save money on their automobile 
insurance. They receive a <u>special</u> <u>policy</u> ... plainly written. Does your policy 
say what you think it does? If your car were stolen tonight, do you know what 
you would receive? Consult the manager of the nearest Chicago Motor Club 
branch--there is one in your community.
   
If you would like to know more about the charming and historic section 
featured in tonight's broadcast, here is something that will interest you.  
Get a pencil and paper--ready now--send for "Roads of Romance, No. 14." It has 
pictures, a road map, and a splendid description of this part of America. It 
is especially valuable to you. "Roads of Romance" is yours for the asking. 
Send to the station to which you are listening or to the Chicago Motor Club, 
66 East South Water Street, Chicago. You may also secure "Roads of Romance" at 
any branch of the club. If you have your pencil ready, jot down the address--
Chicago Motor Club, 66 East South Water Street, Chicago. The club will be glad 
to answer your request; just ask for "Roads of Romance, No. 14." You may not 
intend to take this trip immediately. No matter--You may take it sometime.  
Keep your copies of "Roads of Romance" for future reference. The club cannot 
supply back copies. You must make your request before Saturday.
   
And now the Chicago Motor Club says good night and may good fortune attend you 
on your motor trips. Keeping to the right, except when passing, is one way of 
attending good motoring fortune. The slow driver who occupies the inside lane 
is a menace to traffic.
   
Next week we shall hear a story of Minnehaha Falls by the Chicago Motor Club 
players.

(Fade Out of Signature) 

This is ____ speaking. "Roads of Romance" has come to you from the NBC Studios
