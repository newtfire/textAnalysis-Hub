SOUND: A HANSOM CAB HURRIES BY

MUSIC: THEME ... SOLO VIOLIN ... THEN IN BG

ANNOUNCER: "The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes," the original and immortal 
stories of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle dramatized anew, with Sir Ralph Richardson 
as Dr. Watson and Sir John Gielgud in the role of Sherlock Holmes. 

MUSIC: SOLO VIOLIN ... UP TO FILL A PAUSE ... THEN BEHIND WATSON--

WATSON: (NARRATES) I think I remember the six Napoleons mainly because it was 
such a triumph for my friend Sherlock Holmes: the one time when his old rival, 
Lestrade of Scotland Yard, unashamedly spoke his praise. It hadn't always been 
like that, of course. In the early days, Lestrade had more than once been 
inclined to jeer at my friend's original methods. But by the time of this 
particular adventure he'd lost some of his old enmity. He'd taken to looking 
in on us in the evening at Baker Street and talking about old times and 
generally keeping Holmes up to date in everything that was going on at police 
headquarters. But this particular evening, as Holmes improvised on his violin, 
Lestrade fell curiously silent and puffed thoughtfully at his cigar for a 
moment or two.

MUSIC: SOLO VIOLIN ... UP TO FILL A PAUSE ... THEN ABRUPTLY OUT

HOLMES: Well, Lestrade--?

LESTRADE: (ABSENTLY) Hm?

HOLMES: Anything remarkable on hand?

LESTRADE: (RELUCTANTLY) Ohhhh. No, nothing in particular, you know, Mr. 
Holmes. 

HOLMES: (LIGHTLY) Ah, just so. Then hadn't you better tell me all about it? 

WATSON &
LESTRADE: (LAUGH)

LESTRADE: Oh, well, I suppose there's no use denying it. Except that it's such 
a peculiar business, I - I'd hardly wanted to bother you with it, Mr. Holmes. 
In fact, it's really more in the doctor's line than ours, I suppose. 

WATSON: Oh, really? What? What, some illness of some kind?

LESTRADE: <u>Mental</u> illness. Madness at the very least -- and a queer kind of 
madness at that.

WATSON: Really?

LESTRADE: Now, you wouldn't think there was anyone living in this day and age 
who must hate old Napoleon so much that he smashes to bits any image of him he 
can lay hands on. 

WATSON: A hatred of Napoleon? Well, that's a curious obsession certainly.

HOLMES: (CHUCKLES) Yes. Hardly in my line, by the sound of it. Watson, I defer 
to you. 

WATSON: Thank you.

LESTRADE: Yes, but the only thing is, of course--

WATSON: Well, what, Lestrade? You're still chewing, you know. 

LESTRADE: Well, this maniac fellow adds a bit of burglary to it, you see. 

HOLMES: (INTERESTED) Burglary, eh? 

LESTRADE: So's he can get hold of these images he wants to smash.

HOLMES: Oh, really? (TO WATSON) Just pass the tobacco would you, my dear 
fellow? 

WATSON: Yes, of course. 

HOLMES: Thank you.

SOUND: TOBACCO PICKED UP AND PASSED

WATSON: It must be Napoleon, I take it, Lestrade.

LESTRADE: Well, it seems so, doctor. First case came in four days ago: shop of 
a man called Morse Hudson who sells pictures and statuettes and such in the 
Kennington Road. The assistant was in the back shop and he heard a sudden 
smash and when he rushed through, somebody had thrown down a plaster bust of 
Napoleon and broken it to smithereens. 

HOLMES: Oh? Valuable? 

LESTRADE: No, worth a few shillings maybe; not much more. 

HOLMES: Oh.

LESTRADE: Anyway, the shop fellow ran out to the street, but there wasn't any 
trace of anybody by that time.

HOLMES: But something's happened since obviously. 

LESTRADE: Yes. Last night. There's a well-known doctor called Barnicot who 
lives only about a couple of hundred yards from this Morse Hudson shop.

WATSON: Yes, yes, I've heard of him: one of the biggest practices south of the 
Thames they say.

HOLMES: Yeah. He's a bit of a collector, too, isn't he? Antiques and so forth.

LESTRADE: Same man, gentlemen. Well, he got hold of a couple of plaster casts 
of the famous head of Napoleon by some French sculptor or other called Devine. 
He put one of them in the hall of his private house and the other in his 
surgery at lower Brixton. And when he came down this morning, doctor-- 

WATSON: What?

LESTRADE: House burgled. And yet there wasn't a thing taken but the bust from 
the hall. 

WATSON: Good gracious.

LESTRADE: And believe it or not, it had been carried outside and smashed 
against the garden wall, same as the other one in the shop. 

HOLMES: (PLEASED) Ahh, this is certainly very novel, Lestrade. 

LESTRADE: (CHUCKLES) I thought it would please you, Mr. Holmes. And it isn't 
the end yet, either.

WATSON: (REALIZES) The other bust. In the surgery.

LESTRADE: Exactly the same, doctor. Smashed to smithereens in the place where 
it stood. Dr. Barnicot discovered it the minute he opened the door. And that's 
the whole story, Mr. Holmes -- as far as it goes. 

HOLMES: Ah, well, it's curious certainly. Now, Watson -- come. Pray give us 
your diagnosis.

WATSON: There are no limits, my dear Holmes, to the possibilities of 
monomania. A man who'd read deeply about Napoleon, for example, or a man who'd 
received some hereditary family injury through the Peninsular War, for 
instance-- I mean, a man like that very well might conceive some kind of 
obsession--

HOLMES: (INTERRUPTS, DISAGREES) Come come come, my dear Watson. 

WATSON: (PUZZLED) Uh--?

HOLMES: Well, considering how many examples of Napoleon's busts there must be, 
no amount of monomania would explain why such a promiscuous iconoclast should 
chance to begin on three examples by the same sculptor.

WATSON: Hm?

HOLMES: As I take it, Lestrade, these three are all copies of the same 
original and all bought at this man Hudson's shop?

LESTRADE: Every one, Mr. Holmes. Identical. 

WATSON: Why, then the fellow may have an obsession against the sculptor. 

HOLMES: Possibly. Yet even if it <u>is</u> madness, there's still method in it. You 
see, he carefully takes the bust that was in the house <u>outside</u> to smash it 
because a noise might have wakened the people upstairs. But in the other case 
he smashes the bust in the surgery just where it stands.

WATSON: (DISMISSIVE) Oh, really, pooh-pooh, that's too trifling, my dear 
Holmes. 

HOLMES: Well, one never knows, Watson. One can never be quite sure. Some of my 
most classic cases have had the least promising beginning.

WATSON: Yes, but you-- 

HOLMES: You'll remember how that dreadful business of the Abernetty family was 
first brought to my notice by the depth to which the parsley had sunk into the 
butter on a very hot day. 

(OVERLAP)
LESTRADE: But, Mr. Holmes--
WATSON: Surely we can't--

HOLMES: (INTERRUPTS MERRILY) Pass Lestrade another cigar, my dear fellow, and 
ring for some whiskey and soda. I have a notion that we may hear more of our 
friend of the statues.

SOUND: CLIP-CLOP OF HORSE PULLING HANSOM CAB ... BEHIND WATSON--

WATSON: (NARRATES) And we did, of course, or there would be no story to tell. 
Next morning as we finished breakfast, a telegram arrived from Lestrade 
himself: "Come instantly, One-Three-One Pitt Street, Kensington." With Holmes' 
usual energy, we <u>did</u> go -- instantly. There we found the railings outside the 
house all lined by a curious crowd.

SOUND: MURMUR OF CROWD ... THEN IN BG

HOLMES: By George, Watson, it must be attempted murder at the very least. 
There's nothing else will hold the interest of the London messenger boy. 

WATSON: There's Lestrade waiting for us, Holmes.

HOLMES: Good morning, inspector. 

LESTRADE: Good morning, gentlemen. Come in, come in. Yes, Napoleon business 
again, Mr. Holmes. 

HOLMES: Aha, I guessed as much. What is it this time, Lestrade? 

LESTRADE: Murder, sir. 

HOLMES: Splendid. Do close the door, my dear Watson.

WATSON: Yes, yes. 

LESTRADE: (WITH DISGUST) Ah, this confounded crowd.

SOUND: DOOR CLOSES, SHUTTING OUT CROWD

LESTRADE: Ah, this is Mr. Horace Harker, gentlemen, the owner of this house. 
Mr. Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, Mr. Harker.

HOLMES: Good morning, sir.

HARKER: How do you do, sir?

WATSON: How do you do?

LESTRADE: Mr. Harker is a reporter for the Central Press Syndicate, Mr. 
Holmes. 

HOLMES: I'd gathered so much already, Lestrade. Well, Mr. Harker, will you 
kindly tell us exactly what has happened?

HARKER: Well, I'll do my best, sir. It all seems to center around a bust of 
Napoleon I bought for this very room about four months ago. 

HOLMES: Where did you buy it, Mr. Harker? 

HARKER: What? Oh, Harding Brothers, you know -- few doors up from the High 
Street Station. (AN ASIDE) I don't know what that's got to do with it. 
(RESUMES) Anyway, most of my writing work's done at night, you know. (CHUCKLE) 
Habit of mine. And I was sitting upstairs in my den about three o'clock this 
morning when - when I suddenly heard the most horrible yell from down here. 
Oh, the most dreadful sound, Mr. Holmes. 

HOLMES: Plainly news on your own doorstep, Mr. Harker. 

HARKER: (CHUCKLES)

HOLMES: As a reporter I should have thought you would have welcomed such a 
diversion.

HARKER: Oh, I couldn't. I was too unnerved, I don't mind telling you. 

HOLMES: I see. 

HARKER: Anyway, I pulled myself together a bit and - and I got a hold of a 
poker and - and came down, and when I got in here the window was open, sir, 
and the first thing I saw was that the Napoleon bust had gone from the 
mantelpiece.

HOLMES: Mmm, intriguing, most intriguing. 

WATSON: I'm sure my monomaniac theory is the only possible one, Holmes. 

HOLMES: (DISMISSIVE) Yes-yes-yes, of course. (POINTED) And the murder, Mr. 
Harker? 

HARKER: (HESITANT) Well, I - I rushed to the front door and - and threw it 
open, and - and there on the doorstep-- 

HOLMES: Well? 

HARKER: I - I nearly fell over a dead man who was lying there. 

WATSON: Good gracious me.

HARKER: Yes, he had a great gash in his throat and - and the whole place was 
swimming in blood. 

WATSON: But who was this murdered man? You - you've made inquiries, Lestrade? 

LESTRADE: Of course, and there's nothing to show who he was. We've got the 
body in the mortuary. You can see it if you want. 

WATSON: What does he look like? 

LESTRADE: Tall, thin, sunburnt, poorly dressed. Artisan of some kind, I'd say. 
Obviously a foreigner. There wasn't any name on his clothing and there was 
nothing in his pockets except an apple and some string and a shilling map of 
London and a man's photograph. Here it is, Mr. Holmes. 

HOLMES: (EXAMINES PHOTO) Ah huh. Plainly not a picture of the fellow himself, 
judging by your description. What do you make of this, Watson? 

WATSON: Oh, well, let's see. (EXAMINES PHOTO) Mm hm. Well, somewhat simian in 
type, eh? 

HOLMES: Yes. 

WATSON: Thick eyebrows, you see, Holmes? Very peculiar projection on the lower 
part of the face. Mmm, altogether I should say southern European, I'd guess.

HOLMES: Admirable, Watson. And the bust, Lestrade? What happened to Mr. 
Harker's bust of Napoleon?

LESTRADE: We had news of it five minutes before you came: smashed to 
smithereens in the front garden of an empty house in Camden Hill Road. 

HOLMES: Aha.

LESTRADE: I'm going 'round to see it now. Want to come? 

HOLMES: But of course, of course. We leave you in peace now, Mr. Harker. I'm 
sure you must be impatient to write up your own story for one of your 
newspapers. 

HARKER: Oh, it's too late now, I'm afraid. The first editions are probably out 
with it already.

HOLMES: Oh, that's too bad. 

HARKER: Just my luck. Oh, but perhaps a cup of tea. I've been too confused to 
write a thing so far.

HOLMES: Well, at any rate, you must try. And you can quote me if you like. Say 
that I believe my friend Watson's theory is almost certainly the right one. 

WATSON: (PLEASED) Ah, my dear Holmes, you really think that--?

HOLMES: (TO HARKER) Yes, he is convinced that the crime was the work of a 
dangerous homicidal lunatic with Napoleonic delusions.

HARKER: Oh. Oh, thank you, Mr. Holmes. Hom--? Homic--? Yes, I can certainly 
use that.

HOLMES: (CHUCKLES) 

WATSON: (LOW) You, uh--? You really do believe it, Holmes? 

HOLMES: (LOW, HUMORS HIM) Why not, Watson? Why not? It'll serve for the moment 
-- and for the press. (UP) Come, Lestrade! Let us view the remains. 

LESTRADE: Ah, yes -- the body, Mr. Holmes.

HOLMES: No, no, no -- the bust. I propose to indulge in a little jigsaw work. 
You see, if all the fragments fit together to make the head complete again--

WATSON: What then, Holmes? 

HOLMES: Well, I may be able to, er-- Well, you and I will have some 
interesting work to do, Watson. Good morning, Mr. Harker. (MOVING OFF) Come, 
gentlemen.

SOUND: SCENE FADES OUT ... TRANSITIONAL PAUSE

WATSON: (NARRATES) With some little trouble, Holmes succeeded in 
reconstructing the whole bust from the splinters scattered over the garden of 
that empty house. Why he did this, I didn't know. Lestrade and I, obediently 
but mystified, fetched and carried at his direction. Holmes' face was 
enigmatic as he and I next drove to the premises of Morse Hudson, the supplier 
of the first three busts that had been broken. From him we learnt the name of 
the original manufacturers of the articles: Messrs. Gelder and Company, of 
Stepney. In rapid succession we drove through the fringe of fashionable 
London, theatrical London, literary London, commercial London -- and finally 
maritime London, where the tenement houses swelter and reek with the outcasts 
of Europe.

SOUND: HARBOR BACKGROUND (SHIPS' HORNS, ET CETERA)

WATSON: (NARRATES) There, in a side street, we found the statuette factory and 
we learnt from the proprietor-- (FADES OUT)

GELDER: (FADES IN) Oh, but there are thousands, Mr. Holmes. We took thousands 
of casts of the Devine Napoleon. 

HOLMES: I've no doubt it's a noble work, but this batch of six noted down in 
these books of yours which I have before me -- you see the entries, Watson? -- 
all dated about a year ago.

WATSON: Yes, and marked in two consignments. (REALIZES) Yes! One set of three 
to Morse Hudson! 

HOLMES: And the other three to Harding Brothers of Kensington. Ah! Who does 
the casting work on these statuettes of yours, Mr. Gelder? 

GELDER: We use the Italians, Mr. Holmes. We find they work well.

HOLMES: Aha. And do you recognize this particular Italian? This obvious 
Italian? Watson, pray show him the photograph that Lestrade gave us. 

WATSON: Yes, yes, yes. Here - here it is.

SOUND: PHOTO HANDLED 

GELDER: (WITH DISAPPROVAL) Ah! The rascal! Beppo!

HOLMES: Beppo, indeed. Well, what was his other name? 

GELDER: I never knew it, even though he used to work here. Oh, he was a 
madman, sir. I never knew a man with such a temper. He knifed another Italian 
in the street one day and then he came running into the works with the police 
on his heels and they arrested him in this very workroom.

HOLMES: Well, and what sentence did he get?

GELDER: The man he attacked lived and so he got off with a year. 

HOLMES: Aha. 

GELDER: (THOUGHTFUL) He must be out by now, of course. If you wanted to know 
where he is, we have a cousin of his here who could tell you.

HOLMES: No, no, no, no -- not a word to the cousin, I beg of you.

GELDER: No?

HOLMES: The matter's most important, Mr. Gelder. (LIGHTLY) Indeed, the further 
I go with it, the more important it seems to grow. (IMPATIENT) Watson my dear 
fellow, where have you got to? Are you ready?

WATSON: (APPROACHES) Yes, yes, yes, I'm here, Holmes. I was just-- 

HOLMES: Well, come along, come along. There's no time to lose. I don't think 
we need intrude upon you then any more, Mr. Gelder. I'm much obliged to you. 

GELDER: Oh, not at all. Only too glad to help you.

SOUND: SCENE FADES OUT ... TRANSITIONAL PAUSE ... FADE IN CITY STREET TRAFFIC 
BACKGROUND

HOLMES: We have one more visit to make, Watson -- to Harding Brothers, back in 
Kensington; then luncheon, I suggest; and a telegram to Lestrade to come to 
Baker Street this evening. And <u>then</u>, Watson--

WATSON: And <u>then</u>, Holmes? 

HOLMES: Well, that invaluable Army revolver of yours may once more be pressed 
into service, old friend. 

WATSON: Indeed?

HOLMES: We have some dangerous work ahead of us, if I'm not mistaken. There 
are <u>two</u> of them still at large!

WATSON: Two criminals, Holmes? 

HOLMES: No, no -- only one criminal. But two busts of Napoleon, my dear 
Watson. Come along! 

MUSIC: ACCENT ... THEN SOLO VIOLIN ... OUT BEHIND WATSON--

WATSON: (NARRATES) And so, as always, I had to be content. Sherlock Holmes was 
at his most mysterious, and I knew so well how dearly he loved a mystery and 
would tell me nothing of his conclusions until his own time was ripe. I waited 
as best I could. Yet as the slow late summer day wore on, I felt a constantly 
rising excitement within me and I saw that Holmes, too, was febrile and 
impatient -- until at last, in response to our telegram, the good Lestrade 
appeared.

HOLMES: (FADES IN) Ah, Lestrade. My dear Lestrade. You weren't busy I hope? 

LESTRADE: Busy, Mr. Holmes? I'm always busy. It's our motto at the Yard. 

HOLMES: Of course.

LESTRADE: You'll be happy to hear, by the way, that I've solved our mystery. 

HOLMES: What? You have?

LESTRADE: Of course, sir! We have our methods, too, you know. I've identified 
the dead man. 

WATSON: (SURPRISED) My dear Lestrade! 

LESTRADE: Oh, yes, doctor. We've an inspector who makes a specialty of Saffron 
Hill in the Italian quarter and he knew our corpse the minute he set eyes on 
him. His name was Pietro Venucci -- from Naples he was -- and he was one of 
the most notorious cut-throats in London.

HOLMES: (WITH SATISFACTION) Venucci -- the last link. 

LESTRADE: He was connected with the old secret society of the Mafia, d'you 
see? And it's perfectly clear that he must have broken the rules in some way. 
So this fellow in the photograph is sent to kill him -- or even perhaps the 
other way around. You know how fiendish they are in these vendetta things. At 
any rate, one is shadowing the other; there's a scuffle outside Harker's 
house; and in the struggle, Venucci gets his death wound. Heh! How's that, Mr. 
Holmes? 

HOLMES: (CHUCKLES) Perfect, perfect. 

WATSON: I confess it seems to hang together admirably. 

HOLMES: (DRY) Yeah, except, of course, for Napoleon. 

LESTRADE: Ahh, the busts are only a coincidence. We're on the murderer's 
trail, of course, as I expect you are, too, from your wire. So all we need to 
do is to make our way to the Italian quarter where I've no doubt we'll be able 
to find him. 

HOLMES: No, no, no, my dear fellow -- Chiswick. [chizzik] 

LESTRADE: (SKEPTICAL) Chiswick's a highly respectable residential district.

HOLMES: Ah, and therefore the most likely neighborhood for spectacular 
happenings. If you've ever trusted me before, my dear Lestrade, trust me now. 
I'll promise to go with you tomorrow to the Italian quarter if I fail you. 
Now, for your part, come with Watson and me tonight to Chiswick. Is that a 
bargain?

LESTRADE: Well-- I take you on trust, Mr. Holmes.

HOLMES: You do very wisely. You will have dinner with us first, Lestrade. 

LESTRADE: Oh, well now, that's very nice of you.

HOLMES: Have you ordered the four-wheeler, Watson? 

WATSON: For eleven -- to take us over to be on the other side of Hammersmith 
Bridge.

HOLMES: Good, good -- and you have the address, of course? The one we got from 
the fellow at Harding Brothers? 

WATSON: Yes, yes -- Laburnum Lodge, Laburnum Vale, Chiswick. 

HOLMES: Admirable. You never fail me, Watson. Oh, would you pass me my hunting 
crop there, Lestrade? 

LESTRADE: (OFF) Er, this it?

HOLMES: Yeah, thank you. The handle is weighted with lead -- (<u>SOUND: TAPS CROP 
IN HAND</u>) -- a most useful weapon, as I've proved before. Now -- let us address 
ourselves to the important process of nutrition. It may be a long time before 
we eat again.

SOUND: SCENE FADES OUT ... TRANSITIONAL PAUSE ... CLOCK STRIKES ... NOCTURNAL 
BACKGROUND

WATSON: (READS SIGNS) [Maurepoe?], The Elms, the Neaves-- Ah! Laburnum Lodge! 
Well, Holmes, here we are. 

HOLMES: Excellent. And with this particularly tall fence for our concealment.

LESTRADE: They've gone to bed it seems. Whole place is in darkness. 

HOLMES: Mm, I sent Mr. Brown a personal message asking him to cooperate. 

LESTRADE: Mr. Brown? 

WATSON: Mr. Josiah Brown, Lestrade, whose name we obtained as the purchaser of 
the fifth Napoleon. 

LESTRADE: (AMUSED) Oh ho, you and your Napoleons, Mr. Holmes. I've told you 
that all that part of it's only coincidence. It's this Mafia business that's 
the real crux. 

HOLMES: (LOW) Sh-sh-sh. Well, well, if you say so, Lestrade. Now then, Watson 
-- will you crouch down here, close to the hedge? You'd better lie down in the 
long grass, Watson, here, here. 

SOUND: WATSON LIES DOWN ON GRASS ... THEY LOWER THEIR VOICES FOR FOLLOWING--

HOLMES: And, Lestrade, you stay here beside me.

LESTRADE: Yes.

HOLMES: Good, good.

LESTRADE: Look there, Mr. Holmes. The open window.

WATSON: What? Huh? Ah, not so long after all, then. 

HOLMES: Yes, that's him. He must have been inside when we arrived. Our luck's 
in. 

WATSON: There's a light there, flickering. Do you see? 

HOLMES: Yes, we've got him. And in respectable Chiswick, too, Lestrade. 

LESTRADE: He's climbing out. Oh, thank heaven for the moonlight. 

WATSON: Look! He's carrying something white under his arm. 

HOLMES: Aha, the fifth Napoleon. (QUICKLY) No, wait, Lestrade. Wait, wait, 
man. Let's see what he does. He's coming closer, do you see?

WATSON: He stopped there by the street lamp. Holmes, I do believe he's going 
to-- He's going to--

SOUND: CRASH! AND TINKLE! OF BUST SMASHED TO BITS ON THE ROAD

HOLMES: Exactly. Smashed to smithereens like all the others. And while he's 
busy examining it, Lestrade-- (PAUSE, UP BIG) On him! Watson, after me!

SOUND: WATSON, LESTRADE, AND BEPPO MURMUR AND GRUNT WITH EFFORT AS THEY 
SCUFFLE, IN BG--

BEPPO: Hey! Hey, let me go! What do you want? (ET CETERA, IN BG)

WATSON: All right, I've got him, I've got him. Watch out, Lestrade, he's got a 
knife!

LESTRADE: Ahhh, no you don't, my beauty. I've got the other wrist, doctor.

SOUND: SCUFFLE ENDS

BEPPO: (BREATHES HEAVILY, BRIEFLY BEHIND--)

LESTRADE: Ah, there -- that's better. Ah, he's safe enough now I reckon. (TO 
BEPPO) What's your name, my man? (NO ANSWER) Won't speak, eh? 

WATSON: (BRIEFLY BREATHLESS) His name's Beppo, Lestrade. At least if I follow 
Holmes aright. Holmes, didn't you say that--? Oh, good heavens, where is he? 
(CALLS) Holmes? Holmes?!

HOLMES: (OFF) All right, Watson! I'm over here with the bust. (CLOSER) Ah, 
well, Lestrade, you've got him then? Ha. For my own part, I've been attending 
to our friend the good Napoleon. But with no good results so far, I fear. It 
seems the final secret still eludes us. 

LESTRADE: (AMUSED) 'Pon my soul, Mr. Holmes, you beat me, you do really. Still 
harping on about these statues? 

HOLMES: (LIGHTLY) Yes, I'm almost one of Watson's monomaniacs on the subject, 
Lestrade. 

BEPPO: (BRIEF ANGRY OUTBURST IN ITALIAN)

HOLMES: Oh, will you please take the prisoner to Bow Street now, Lestrade? And 
if you'll kindly come 'round to Baker Street at about six o'clock tomorrow 
evening, I think I shall then be able to show you that even now you've not 
grasped the entire meaning of this affair. (UP) Come, Watson, come! Back to 
Baker Street in our four-wheeler.

SOUND: SCENE FADES OUT ... TRANSITIONAL PAUSE

HOLMES: What time is it, Watson?

WATSON: (CHECKS THE TIME) Uhhh, six o'clock, Holmes. 

SOUND: KNOCK ON DOOR

WATSON: And here comes our man, dead on time.

SOUND: DOOR OPENS

HOLMES: Ah, Lestrade! Good evening to you. 

WATSON: Good evening, good evening.

LESTRADE: Well, Mr. Holmes, you were right, of course.

HOLMES: Of course, of course. 

LESTRADE: I mean about the fella Beppo. I've been able to check everything: 
other name, unknown; pretty celebrated as a ne'er-do-well in the Italian 
colony; temper of the fiend; used to be a successful sculptor, but fell in 
evil ways.

SOUND: BELL RINGS OFF

HOLMES: Watson? That's the street bell, I believe. (BEAT) Ah, yes, and I hear 
footsteps on the staircase. Would you prepare to receive our visitor?

WATSON: Certainly, Holmes, certainly. 

SOUND: DOOR OPENS

WATSON: Ah, good evening, sir. Mr. Sandeford, of Reading, I suppose?

SANDEFORD: Yes, sir. Mr. Sherlock Holmes is expecting me. I had a letter from 
him by special messenger. 

WATSON: Yes, yes. Come in, Mr. Sandeford. This is Mr. Holmes here.

SOUND: DURING ABOVE, SANDEFORD'S STEPS IN ... DOOR CLOSES

SANDEFORD: Good evening, sir. 

WATSON: Let me take your bag.

HOLMES: Carefully! Carefully, I beg you, my dear Watson. That bag contains the 
whole object of our search. That's right, isn't it, Mr. Sandeford? 

SANDEFORD: Well, if you mean that Napoleon bust, yes, it does, sir. It beats 
me how you knew I had one. 

WATSON: Well, we had your name from Mr. Harding of Harding Brothers, Mr. 
Sandeford. He told us that they'd sold you their last copy and they gave us 
your address.

HOLMES: Yes, quite so. Now then, sir -- do you agree to my terms as I set them 
out in my letter? 

SANDEFORD: Well, you said you'd be prepared to pay me ten pounds for it.

HOLMES: Ten pounds it is, Mr. Sandeford. 

SANDEFORD: I'm an honest man, Mr. Holmes. Of course the money attracts me, 
but, er, I think you ought to know I only paid fifteen shillings for it.

HOLMES: I've named my price, Mr. Sandeford, and I intend to stick to it. 
(BEAT) There you are, sir. Ten pounds. Yes, and in return I shall only ask you 
to sign this paper in the presence of these witnesses. It's simply to say that 
you transfer all possible rights you ever had in the purchase to me. (BEAT, AS 
SANDEFORD SIGNS) Thank you so much. Good evening, Mr. Sandeford. The landlady 
downstairs will show you out.

SANDEFORD: Oh, I'm much obliged to ye I'm sure, Mr. Holmes. Good evening, 
gentlemen.

WATSON: Good evening, good evening.

SOUND: DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES AS SANDEFORD EXITS

HOLMES: (EAGERLY) Now, Watson; now, Lestrade! The bust on the table there, and 
my celebrated loaded hunting crop in my hand and-- (WITH EFFORT) <u>So</u>!

SOUND: SMASH! OF BUST SHATTERED 

WATSON: (STARTLED) Holmes! 

LESTRADE: (ASTONISHED) Great heavens, sir!

WATSON: (THE SAME) Holmes, what are you doing?

HOLMES: (TRIUMPHANT) Do you see? There! The perfect hiding place! That's what 
I was looking for when I fitted the other bust together in the garden. See? 
That fragment that was the emperor's ear-- Embedded like a plum in a pudding-- 
Let me introduce you gentlemen to the famous <u>black</u> <u>pearl</u> <u>of</u> <u>the</u> <u>Borgias</u>, 
nothing less. 

LESTRADE: What?! (CHUCKLES) We-e-ll-- Well, bravo, Holmes. Bravo, sir. 

WATSON: Bless my soul. Bravo. Bravo indeed.

HOLMES: (PLEASED) Thank you, gentlemen, thank you. 

WATSON: But what made you link it all together, Holmes? 

HOLMES: Elementary, my dear Watson. You'll remember, Lestrade, that at the 
time when the pearl disappeared, some suspicion fell on the princess's maid 
who was an Italian girl named, er--

LESTRADE: (REALIZES) Venucci! Of course! 

HOLMES: Lucretia Venucci. It was believed that she had a brother in London who 
worked with her as a jewel thief.

WATSON: (REALIZES) The fellow who was murdered two nights ago! 

HOLMES: As you say, Watson. I then recollected that the pearl had disappeared 
just two days before the arrest of the man Beppo for some crime of violence. 
The police were after him, he had the pearl in his possession -- he may have 
stolen it from Venucci or he may even have been Venucci's confederate -- at 
any event, before the police arrived, he hid it in the only place he could 
think of in the moment: one of the wet plaster casts of a Napoleon head which 
were at that moment being molded in the factory. 

WATSON: And he's been in prison for a year-- 

HOLMES: Just so, and when he came out he found from his cousin in the factory 
where that consignment of that day's Napoleons had gone -- and somehow or 
other traced the address of each purchaser.

LESTRADE: But how did he run across Venucci again? 

HOLMES: Ah, we'll never know that, Lestrade, unless he decides to talk. I take 
it that they may have quarreled, if they were confederates, or that Venucci 
was out for revenge, if Beppo had stolen the gem from him. At any rate, he 
also got on the trail; they met outside Harker's house; there was a scuffle; 
and behold -- your murder, Lestrade. 

WATSON: And you knew the pearl must be in the Sandeford bust, Holmes.

HOLMES: Well, naturally, when I saw last night that it wasn't in the fifth one 
at Laburnum Lodge.

WATSON: Ah. 

HOLMES: I wrote to Mr. Sandeford, as you know; bought the pearl in your 
presence from the owner for ten pounds; and there it lies in all its glory.

LESTRADE: Well, I've seen you handle a good many cases, Mr. Holmes, but I 
don't know that I ever knew a more workmanlike one than that. Heh! We're not 
jealous of you at Scotland Yard, oh no, sir. We're very proud of you. And if 
you come down tomorrow there's not a man from the oldest inspector to the 
youngest constable who wouldn't be glad to shake you by the hand. 

HOLMES: (QUIETLY MOVED) Thank you, Lestrade. (WITH A CHUCKLE) Thank you. 

MUSIC: SOLO VIOLIN ... THEN IN BG

WATSON: (NARRATES) And, as he played that evening with Lestrade's tribute 
still ringing in his ears, it seemed to me, who knew him so well, that he was 
more nearly moved by the softer emotions than I had ever seen him. So ended, 
then, the case of the Six Napoleons in the year Nineteen Hundred, when I was 
back once more, after the death of my wife, in those old rooms in Baker 
Street, which I shared with the man I most revered in all the world, Mr. 
Sherlock Holmes. 

MUSIC: SOLO VIOLIN ... UP FOR A GENTLE FINISH ... AND OUT
