MUSIC: THEME ... THEN KNIFE CHORD

VOICE: SUSPENSE!

MUSIC: THEME CONTINUES IN BG

VOICE: Auto-Lite and its ninety-six thousand dealers present Miss Loretta 
Young in "Lady Killer," a Suspense play produced and edited by William Spier.

MUSIC: UP AND OUT

REMING: Say, Wilcox! Did I ever tell you about the time I plugged a buffalo?

ANNOUNCER: No, Reming-Chester Shotgun, but have I told you about the 
sensational wide-gap Auto-Lite resistor spark plugs?

REMING: You mean there's something special about Auto-Lite resistor spark 
plugs?

ANNOUNCER: Why, wide-gap Auto-Lite resistor spark plugs are the newest 
addition to the complete line of regular, transport, aviation, marine, 
resistor, and model spark plugs ignition-engineered by Auto-Lite. 

REMING: You're sure pluggin' tonight, Wilcox.

ANNOUNCER: Ah, built right into every wide-gap Auto-Lite resistor spark plug 
is an exclusive ten-thousand-ohm Auto-Lite resistor that makes practical a 
wider initial gap setting with advantages that have long been recognized by 
automotive engineers. For example, you get smoother performance on leaner gas 
mixtures, greater gas savings, quicker starts in cold temperatures -- even 
double life as compared to spark plugs without the built-in resistor. So, 
friends, see your friendly Auto-Lite spark plug dealer tomorrow and replace 
worn-out spark plugs with ignition-engineered Auto-Lite spark plugs. Whether 
you choose the resistor type or the regular type, you'll be right -- because 
you're always right with Auto-Lite.

MUSIC: THEME ... THEN BEHIND--

VOICE: And now, with "Lady Killer" and the performance of Loretta Young, Auto-
Lite hopes once again to keep you in--

MUSIC: KNIFE CHORD

VOICE: SUSPENSE!

SOUND: AIRPORT BACKGROUND ... AIRPLANE ENGINE STARTS UP, CONTINUES IN BG ... 
BENTON'S FOOTSTEPS TO PLANE BEHIND--

P. A.: (FILTER) Flight One-Seven-Five - to Morningside and Capital City - now 
loading at Gate Three. Will passengers please board the plane?

BENTON: Is this the right plane for Capital City, stewardess?

STEWARDESS: Yes, sir. Name, please?

BENTON: Benton. Grant Benton.

STEWARDESS: Take any seat, Mr. Benton.

BENTON: (LIGHTLY) I have a horror of getting in the wrong plane some day and 
winding up in Tibet. Things like that happen to me.

STEWARDESS: (CHUCKLES) Well, it's not very likely this time. Your name is on 
the passenger list. 

BENTON: (MOVING OFF) So it is. That won't keep me from worrying, though!

STEWARDESS: Name, please?

PEG: Uh-- Er, Nordlinger. Miss Nordlinger.

STEWARDESS: You can leave your coat with me if you like, Miss Nordlinger. 

PEG: Guess that would be better. Here you are.

STEWARDESS: Take any seat, Miss Nordlinger.

PEG: Thank you, stewardess. 

SOUND: WE FOLLOW PEG'S FOOTSTEPS INTO PLANE ... ENGINE NOISE FADES DOWN A BIT, 
MURMUR OF PASSENGERS FADES IN ... PEG'S STEPS DOWN THE AISLE AS WE HEAR 
SNATCHES OF PASSENGER CONVERSATION FADE IN AND OUT--

1ST PASSENGER: --I always say the best way to travel, if you ask me--

2ND PASSENGER: (DISMISSIVE) Aw, you can't date a stewardess -- company rules.

SOUND: PEG'S STEPS STOP BEHIND--

PEG: (TO BENTON) I beg your pardon, is this seat taken?

BENTON: As a matter of fact, Miss Nordlinger, I was saving it for you.

PEG: (BEAT, SURPRISED) You - know me?

BENTON: We've never met, but we travel in the same circles. Don't I look at 
all familiar?

PEG: No. (CHUCKLES) But how do you do?

SOUND: PEG SITS BEHIND--

BENTON: (CHUCKLES) Sit down, fasten your safety belt, have a pillow. Stick of 
gum? Fetch a blanket?

PEG: Well, I'll settle for the gum.

BENTON: Here you are.

PEG: Thank you.

BENTON: If you chew gum when you're up in the air, it relieves pressure on the 
ears.

PEG: Oh. 

BENTON: <u>Why</u> it relieves pressure in the ears, I haven't the vaguest notion.

PEG: (CHUCKLES) Do you always babble on like this?

BENTON: Pretty near always. Though sometimes--

SOUND: STEWARDESS' STEPS APPROACH BEHIND--

STEWARDESS: (APPROACHES) Uh, Miss Nordlinger?

PEG: Oh. Yes? Yes, stewardess?

STEWARDESS: This telegram just arrived for you.

SOUND: TELEGRAM HANDED OVER BEHIND--

PEG: Oh, thank you. Thank you very much.

STEWARDESS: We'll be taking off in a few minutes, so if you want to send an 
answer--

PEG: Oh, no. I'm sure an answer won't be necessary, stewardess.

STEWARDESS: (MOVING OFF) I'll tell the boy not to wait.

PEG: Thank you.

SOUND: STEWARDESS' STEPS DEPART

BENTON: Aren't you going to open the telegram, Miss Nordlinger? I promise not 
to peek. Or, at most, only a little bit.

PEG: (EMBARRASSED, SLOWLY) I can't open it. You see, I - I'm <u>not</u> Miss 
Nordlinger.

BENTON: (BEAT, CONFUSED) I'm sort of on the dull-witted side--

PEG: Well, the flight was booked solid, but I came out to the airport hoping 
there'd be a cancellation. And just before the passengers started to get on 
board, a woman came up to me and offered to sell me her ticket.

BENTON: How'd she know you wanted one?

PEG: Well, she overheard me talking to the clerk at the reservation desk.

BENTON: So?

PEG: Well, it would have taken extra time to have the ticket validated in my 
own name, so I decided to use hers. (BEAT, UNHAPPY) This, er, telegram 
complicates things.

BENTON: (LIGHTLY) What's your real name, deceitful woman?

PEG: (CHUCKLES) Lincoln. Peg Lincoln. Miss Peg Lincoln. And I didn't deceive 
<u>you</u>, I deceived the stewardess. You just happened to have your ears flapping 
when I told her my name was Nordlinger.

BENTON: Now then, Miss Lincoln, would you mind telling me why you let me go on 
with all that bilge about traveling in the same circles?

PEG: Well, you were trying to pick me up and I thought I'd better help out a 
little.

BENTON: (IRONIC) That's what I like about the modern woman -- so shy and 
retiring. It's like Mata Hari.

PEG: (CHUCKLES) Well, after all, it's a two-hour trip to Capital City. (MORE 
SERIOUS) Dear, I wish I knew what to do about this telegram.

BENTON: Didn't the Nordlinger woman give you an address?

PEG: No, she didn't. I gave her mine, but she was in such a hurry to get away 
that--

SOUND: AIRPLANE ENGINE REVS AND GROWS LOUDER, IN BG

BENTON: Well, it's too late to do anything anyway. We're taking off.

PEG: (SUDDENLY ILL) Oh, that's - that's funny. I - I feel dizzy all at once.

BENTON: Nonsense, we're still on the ground. It's just your imagin--

PEG: (VERY ILL) Oh!

BENTON: Miss Lincoln? 

PEG: Oh, it's - so stuffy in here. I-- I'm awfully sick-- (WHIMPERS IN PAIN 
BEHIND--)

BENTON: (CALLS URGENTLY) Stewardess! Stewardess, don't let the plane take off! 
There's someone sick here!

PEG: Feels like - poison!

MUSIC: TRANSITION ... THEN BEHIND PEG--

PEG: (NARRATES) Sick? Oh, brother, was I sick. When I came to in the hospital 
after a nightmare in which stomach pumps seemed to be reoccurring, I was told 
that I could thank my handsome seatmate for the fact that I was still alive. 
He stopped the flight, carried me off the plane, and raced me into the 
hospital. Furthermore, he had engaged a private nurse and had telephoned every 
hour until assured that the danger was over. I had bounced back fast. Next 
morning found me weak as a kitten, but sufficiently recovered to leave the 
hospital. The bubbling Mr. Benton was waiting to drive me home.

SOUND: RUNNING AUTO INTERIOR BACKGROUND

BENTON: (MOCK POMPOUS) And so we bid a reluctant farewell to Rosemont 
Hospital, to a ton of smiling nurses with their picturesque thermometers, to 
the pungent unforgettable aroma of chloroform that lingers in its halls. (NO 
RESPONSE) Miss Lincoln? (NO ANSWER) Miss Lincoln? 

PEG: Oh, yes?

BENTON: (DRY) Are you sure you <u>didn't</u> die?

PEG: Sorry, my mind was on something else.

BENTON: Miss Lincoln--? Or may I call you Peg?

PEG: (UNEASY) Let's keep it at Miss Lincoln for a while, Mr. Benton.

BENTON: (DISAPPOINTED) I wish we read the same books.

PEG: Meaning?

BENTON: The books I read, a fellow saves the girl's life, she falls all over 
him. 

PEG: Yes?

BENTON: The ones you read, it's "Let's keep it at Miss Lincoln for a while."

PEG: (EXHALES) Maybe I should explain. I am an insurance investigator. And 
insurance investigators get to be pretty good at spotting phonies. (BEAT) I 
think you're a phony.

BENTON: Well, aren't you sweet?

PEG: Not very.

BENTON: You know what I'd do if you were drowning right now? I'd throw rocks 
at you.

PEG: I don't doubt it.

BENTON: A cryptic remark. I love cryptic remarks.

PEG: Did Dr. Shiflin happen to mention <u>what</u> I nearly died of?

BENTON: He said it had some of the symptoms of food poisoning.

PEG: Suppose I told you I never eat for twelve hours before traveling.

BENTON: I'd say you must have had <u>something</u>. Contaminated water maybe.

PEG: Or maybe a stick of poisoned chewing gum, to relieve the pressure on my 
ears, eh?

BENTON: (BEAT, OFFENDED) If you're getting at what I think you're getting at--

PEG: I am.

BENTON: Do you know I canceled an important business trip just to make sure 
you were okay? Why, you'd be at the embalmers right now if I hadn't--

PEG: Sure, sure I would. You did some expert diagnosing, all right -- a little 
<u>too</u> expert for a man who hadn't had any medical training.

BENTON: Don't look now, but you're losing your mind. Now, look, why would I 
want to poison a girl I'd never seen before, never had anything to do with? 

PEG: That's what Dr. Shiflin asked.

BENTON: You mean you ran off at the mouth to him?

PEG: I pointed out that the poison may have been meant for the woman whose 
ticket I bought. It was too late to make any poison tests, but, to be on the 
safe side, Dr. Shiflin decided to check on you. He called Chief of Police 
Longman.

BENTON: (CHUCKLES) That must have been good. Ray Longman and I used to trade 
tricycles.

PEG: The chief rates you high, all right. "Above suspicion" was the phrase he 
used.

BENTON: But you're still not sold?

PEG: (EXHALES) I was for a while, but just after I got into your car I found 
this unopened telegram in my pocket.

BENTON: Isn't that the one that was delivered to you aboard the plane? The one 
addressed to that Nordlinger woman?

PEG: Yes.

BENTON: Well, what about it?

PEG: Well, it wasn't in my pocket when I left the hospital ten minutes ago.

BENTON: You just didn't notice, that's all.

PEG: Want to look at a copy of the hospital receipt I signed for the personal 
articles returned to me? You'll find everything else on it. No telegram, 
though.

BENTON: An oversight.

PEG: Oh, hospitals don't make oversights.

BENTON: Would you mind running through the whole plot for me? I'm a little 
hazy as to my motives.

PEG: All right. You poisoned me thinking I was the Nordlinger woman. 
Fortunately for me, you discovered the mistake in time to correct it.

BENTON: Well, for a murderer, I certainly am caring.

PEG: However, you wanted to look at the telegram, so you stole it -- probably 
as you carried me out of the plane. You read it and then you resealed the 
envelope, and then met me at the hospital hoping to slip it back into my 
pocket before I missed it.

SOUND: AUTO SLOWS TO A STOP ... ENGINE CONTINUES TO IDLE, IN BG

BENTON: You've got the telegram right there. Open it up; maybe we can put an 
end to this fairy tale.

PEG: Thank you, no. I'd rather wait until I find the Nordlinger woman -- if 
she's still alive.

SOUND: TELEGRAM SNATCHED BEHIND--

BENTON: Well, then I'll open it for you. 

SOUND: TELEGRAM TORN OPEN BEHIND--

PEG: Here! Give that back to me, please! It's--!

SOUND: TELEGRAM UNFOLDED

BENTON: (BEAT, READS SARDONICALLY) "Have a nice trip, Love." It's signed "Aunt 
Ellen." (CHUCKLES)

SOUND: PEG SNATCHES THE TELEGRAM BACK ... AUTO STARTS BACK INTO TRAFFIC

BENTON: Of course, that's in my gang's secret code. That means, "Boatload of 
stolen jewels ready to sail at dawn for What Cheer, Iowa."

PEG: Thoughtful of you to rip the envelope so I couldn't check the resealing.

BENTON: How <u>can</u> you be suspicious of somebody so charming?

PEG: (MIRTHLESS CHUCKLE) The Chief of Police knows what's on my mind. If 
anything happens to me, it'll take more than that charm of yours to keep the 
badge boys off your neck.

BENTON: But I do have charm. That we're agreed on.

PEG: Oh, yes, but you're wasting it on me. (CASUAL) Next one is my apartment 
building. (SUDDENLY TENSE) Oh, look out! Look out for that girl crossing the 
street!

BENTON: Oh, get out of the--! 

SOUND: HORN HONKS, BRAKES SQUEAL, TIRES SCREECH

PEG: <u>Look</u> <u>ooooooout</u>!

MUSIC: FOR A CAR RUNNING DOWN A WOMAN ... UP BIG AND THEN OUT

SOUND: MURMUR AND WHISPER OF CROWD IN APARTMENT LOBBY, IN BG

JACK: (CONCERNED) Miss Lincoln, see if you can swallow this water, <u>please</u>.

PEG: (DRINKS, EXHALES)

JACK: There.

PEG: (DAZED) What happened? Who--?

JACK: It's me, Jack, the elevator operator. 

PEG: (RECOGNIZES JACK) Oh.

JACK: Oh, gee, you had me scared.

PEG: Oh, Jack, how did I--?

JACK: I carried ya into the apartment lobby. 

PEG: Oh?

JACK: I guess you're still weak from the hospital 'cause you fainted after the 
accident.

PEG: Oh. Where's Mr. Benton? (NO ANSWER) The man! The man who was driving the 
car. Where is he?

JACK: Police headquarters. They want you to report in, too, whenever you're 
feelin' better.

PEG: And the girl was killed?

JACK: Yeah. Gee, it was awful.

PEG: (EXHALES, SOBERLY) Dead--

JACK: Yes, Miss Lincoln, it was - it was so awful. Friend of yours, too, huh?

PEG: No. No, I'd never--

JACK: Well, gee, she was just leavin' here when the car hit her. She was 
askin' for you.

PEG: Who was she?

JACK: Well, I wrote her name down. It's in my pocket somewhere. Eh, here it 
is.

SOUND: PAPER UNFOLDS

PEG: (READS) "Patricia Smythe." (PUZZLED) I don't know any Patricia Smythe.

JACK: She said it was important to get in touch with you.

PEG: Oh. Jack--? Jack, did it strike you that Mr. Benton, the driver, could 
have avoided that accident -- by yanking the wheel the other way, perhaps?

JACK: Well, I was reading the comi-- Er, the financial page when it happened. 
I didn't see nothin'. 

PEG: Oh.

JACK: But anything you want me to swear to, though, Miss Lincoln, I--

PEG: Oh, no. No, never mind, Jack. Call me a cab, will ya?

JACK: Aw, Miss Lincoln, you're sick. You oughta be in bed.

PEG: (INSISTENT) Now, look here. Something tells me I'll stay a lot healthier 
if I get to the telegraph office right away.

MUSIC: BRIDGE

SOUND: TELEGRAPH OFFICE BACKGROUND ... MURMURING CUSTOMERS, MACHINES, ET 
CETERA

CLERK: I'm sorry. Now, what was that message again, miss?

PEG: It was addressed to Kate Nordlinger, at the Municipal Airport.

CLERK: And the message?

PEG: "Have a nice trip. Love, Aunt Ellen."

CLERK: Uh huh. No, not sent from this office. Er, might I see the telegram?

PEG: Certainly. Here it is. 

CLERK: Why, this thing is faked, miss!

PEG: Are you sure?

CLERK: It's a regulation form, all right, and the message is pasted on in 
strips, but-- Well, look - look how different the type is from one of ours.

PEG: Yes. Yes, I see. Well, was <u>any</u> telegram sent to Kate Nordlinger at the 
airport?

CLERK: <u>You're</u> Miss Nordlinger? 

PEG: (BEAT, A LITTLE WHITE LIE) Yes, I am.

CLERK: Well, I can look it up in a minute.

PEG: Thank you. That'll be fine.

CLERK: (MOVING OFF) Mmm hmm. Just a minute here. I think I can find it right 
over-- Oh, yes! Yes, yes, here's one. (CLOSER AGAIN) Let's see, it reads, um, 
"On your return, will contact you at Hotel Ludwig." It's signed "Patricia 
Smythe."

PEG: Patricia Smythe?

CLERK: S-M-Y-T-H-E.

PEG: What was the name of that hotel?

CLERK: The Ludwig. Hotel Ludwig. Right there, right across the street.

PEG: Oh. Oh! Oh, yes! Yes, thank you very much, you've been very helpful.

CLERK: You're quite welcome. 

SOUND: FOR A TRANSITION ... PEG'S HURRIED STEPS OUT OF TELEGRAPH OFFICE ... 
CITY TRAFFIC NOISE ... PEG'S STEPS CROSS THE STREET AND ENTER THE HOTEL LOBBY 
... LOBBY BACKGROUND (BELLS, MURMUR OF GUESTS, ET CETERA) ... PEG'S STEPS 
THROUGH LOBBY TO FRONT DESK

OPERATOR: (BORED, INTO PHONE) Good evening, Hotel Ludwig. -- Just a moment, 
I'll connect you.

DESK CLERK: (TO PEG) May I help you, miss?

PEG: Yes, if you would. Ring Miss Kate Nordlinger's room and tell her that 
Miss Lincoln would like to see her for a moment; it's important.

DESK CLERK: (NERVOUS) Whose room did you say?

PEG: Miss Nordlinger's.

DESK CLERK: Oh, I'm sorry, but we have no Miss Nordlinger registered at the 
Ludwig.

PEG: Well, I was sure she was staying here.

DESK CLERK: A friend of yours, miss?

PEG: Why do you ask that?

DESK CLERK: Well, it seemed a natural sort of a question.

PEG: Not to me it didn't. Why do you want to know if she's a friend of mine?

DESK CLERK: (UNCONVINCING) No reason. No reason at all. Just making 
conversation.

PEG: Well, make a little more conversation, will you? Did you <u>ever</u> have a Kate 
Nordlinger registered here?

DESK CLERK: (RELUCTANT) Well, yes, but she's not with us any longer.

PEG: When did she leave?

DESK CLERK: Last night.

PEG: Well, why didn't you tell me that before?

DESK CLERK: I didn't think it important.

PEG: Yes, you did, or you'd have mentioned it. Where'd she go?

DESK CLERK: I don't know, I really--

PEG: Why are you so scared?

DESK CLERK: I'm not scared. It's the manager's orders; we're not supposed to 
talk to reporters.

PEG: Oh, now what makes you think I'm a reporter?

DESK CLERK: Well, who else would ask questions the way you do?

PEG: An insurance investigator.

DESK CLERK: Oh.

SOUND: SHOWS CREDENTIALS BEHIND--

PEG: Here are my credentials. Now, what's this all about?

DESK CLERK: Well, you'll have to promise to keep it confidential, miss. 

PEG: Of course.

DESK CLERK: Thanks to the cooperation of the police, there's been nothing 
about it in the papers and we'd like to keep it that way. Such things are bad 
publicity for the hotel.

PEG: What do you mean, "such things"?

DESK CLERK: Well-- Suicides. 

PEG: Oh.

DESK CLERK: Last night, Kate Nordlinger threw herself out the window on the 
fourteenth floor.

MUSIC: FIRST ACT CURTAIN

VOICE: Auto-Lite is bringing you Loretta Young in "Lady Killer," tonight's 
production in Radio's Outstanding Theatre of Thrills -- SUSPENSE!

MUSIC: THREE CHORDS AND OUT

REMING: About that buffalo, Wilcox, I bagged him with a set of wide-gap Auto-
Lite resistor spark plugs.

ANNOUNCER: Reming-Chester, that's a spark plug story, all right. But motorists 
everywhere can tell you stories about the money-saving advantages of wide-gap 
Auto-Lite resistor spark plugs, the newest addition to the complete line of 
spark plugs ignition-engineered by Auto-Lite.

REMING: You should have seen the difference, Wilcox--!

ANNOUNCER: Difference? Difference? Why, there's an exclusive ten-thousand-ohm 
Auto-Lite resistor built right in to every Auto-Lite resistor spark plug that 
permits a wider initial gap setting, with advantages like smoother 
performance, greater gas savings, quicker starts in cold weather -- even 
double life as compared to spark plugs without the built-in resistor. 

REMING: I'd always say--

ANNOUNCER: So, friends, ask your friendly Auto-Lite spark plug dealer to 
replace worn-out spark plugs with a set of ignition-engineered Auto-Lite spark 
plugs. And whether you choose the resistor type or the regular type, you'll be 
right -- because you're always right with Auto-Lite.

MUSIC: THEME ... IN BG

VOICE: And now, Auto-Lite brings back to our Hollywood sound stage our star 
Loretta Young as Peg Lincoln, with Larry Dobkin as Grant Benton, in "Lady 
Killer" -- a tale well-calculated to keep you in--

MUSIC: KNIFE CHORD

VOICE: --SUSPENSE!

MUSIC: FADES UNDER--

SOUND: PEG'S STEPS AROUND HOTEL ROOM AS SHE OPENS AND CLOSES DRAWERS ... KNOCK 
ON DOOR

PEG: (SURPRISED INHALATION, CALLS) Come in?

SOUND: ROOM DOOR OPENS ... BENTON'S STEPS IN

BENTON: (LIGHTLY) Hello, Miss Lincoln. Taking over Kate Nordlinger's room as 
well as her name? How about a stick of chewing gum?

PEG: (EXHALES) No, thanks, Mr. Benton. I thought you were at police 
headquarters.

BENTON: The police didn't keep me long. 

PEG: Oh?

BENTON: It was obviously an accident, so--

PEG: (SKEPTICAL) Obviously?

BENTON: (MORE SERIOUS) Look here, Miss Lincoln. My car hit a girl and killed 
her. It was her own fault, but that doesn't make me feel any better about it. 
I could do without the cracks.

PEG: (EXHALES) What are you doing here?

BENTON: I just happened to be leaving <u>my</u> room as you walked into this one.

PEG: That was convenient.

BENTON: I thought I recognized you and so--

PEG: You, uh-- You live at this hotel?

BENTON: Certainly, when I'm in town. 

PEG: Oh, I see.

BENTON: (LIGHTLY) Or did you think I just dropped by to push Kate Nordlinger 
out the window?

PEG: (SUSPICIOUS) So you know about that?

BENTON: The Chief of Police is a friend of mine, remember? 

PEG: Oh, yes, that's right. 

BENTON: Me living in the same floor as the woman who committed suicide, he 
thought maybe I could help with some background information.

PEG: But you couldn't, of course.

BENTON: No, I couldn't.

PEG: (SKEPTICAL) Uh huh.

BENTON: Believe it or not, I never once laid eyes on the woman. 

PEG: Oh.

BENTON: And it wasn't until I saw you walk in here that I connected her name 
with the name on the telegram.

SOUND: PEG'S NERVOUS FOOTSTEPS, IN BG, IN AGREEMENT WITH FOLLOWING--

PEG: Well, I - I'd better be going now.

BENTON: You think I'm lying, don't you?

PEG: No. No, not necessarily. I-- (SUDDENLY INTENSE) Please don't come one 
step closer, Mr. Benton!

BENTON: (EXASPERATED) Miss Lincoln--

PEG: One step closer and I start screaming!

BENTON: (REASSURING) Take it easy, I'm not coming any closer.

PEG: (HUSHED INTENSITY) I won't try to kid you. I'm scared of you. Really 
scared. I'm going out of that door now, and don't you move!

BENTON: This is absurd!

PEG: So much as lift a finger and I'll yell my head off. I'm scared, I tell 
you.

SOUND: PEG'S RUNNING STEPS THROUGH DOOR, WHICH SHUTS, THEN DOWN THE HALL

MUSIC: BRIDGE ... THEN BEHIND PEG--

PEG: (NARRATES) And I kept running until I was out of sight of the hotel. At 
police headquarters, I - I suppose I looked just like any other psychopath 
with a persecution complex. But I was stubborn about it. Finally, I got in to 
see the Chief of Police himself; Ray Longman his name was. Surprisingly young 
for his job -- middle thirties, I should say; good-looking, patient and 
reasonable. But when I told him of my experiences with the charming Mr. 
Benton, he laughed out loud. Why, Grant Benton was his best friend; the whole 
thing was impossible. In the first place, there was no connection between the 
deaths of the two women. Patricia Smythe, the girl in the automobile accident, 
had been a clerk at the police department; the chief had known her well. Kate 
Nordlinger had held a private detective's license for five years prior to her 
"suicide," as he kept calling it. So far as anyone knew, the two women had 
never even seen each other. It wasn't until then that I mentioned the fake 
telegram.

LONGMAN: (QUIETLY) Mm hm. Well, I tell you what I'll do, Miss Lincoln. I'll 
check with the telegraph company and if anything develops, I'll get in touch 
with you later. 

PEG: (DISBELIEF) Get in touch with me later?

LONGMAN: (UNDERSTANDING) I know, I know. You're taking all this very 
seriously.

PEG: What am I supposed to do? Sit around like a duck in a shooting gallery 
until you decide to--? 

LONGMAN: You tell me you're an insurance investigator?

PEG: That's right.

LONGMAN: You know court procedure. Would you, under oath, swear that Grant 
Benton deliberately drove into Patricia Smythe and killed her?

PEG: Well, I--

LONGMAN: (POINTEDLY) Under oath.

PEG: (BEAT) Well, no, I - I couldn't, but-- Well, I <u>know</u> he did it 
deliberately. But I couldn't swear to it, if that makes any sense.

LONGMAN: (SYMPATHETIC) It does. In order to swear to it, you'd have to know 
exactly what went on in his mind at that moment.

PEG: Well, that's all very well and good, but don't you--?

LONGMAN: Now, I assure you, there's nothing to link Grant Benton with the 
Nordlinger woman's suicide. And that brings us to the so-called attempts on 
<u>your</u> life. 

PEG: (EXHALES IN FRUSTRATION)

LONGMAN: Would you care to press charges?

PEG: Well, I - I - I can't <u>prove</u> anything.

LONGMAN: So where does that leave us?

PEG: (EXHALES) It leaves you thinking that your best friend is the victim of a 
few embarrassing coincidences. And it leaves <u>me</u> thinking that--

LONGMAN: (CHUCKLES, LIGHTLY) That the Chief of Police is just a big dumb 
flatfoot being taken in by a pal?

MUSIC: BRIDGE ... THEN BEHIND PEG--

PEG: (NARRATES, DISCOURAGED) Which is <u>exactly</u> what I <u>did</u> think. I felt pretty 
sick when I left his office. I went back to my apartment and locked the door 
(<u>SOUND</u>: <u>DOOR</u> <u>LOCKED</u>) and moved a dresser behind it, (<u>SOUND</u>: <u>DRESSER</u> <u>MOVED</u>) 
but-- Well, even that didn't give me any feeling of security. (<u>SOUND</u>: <u>PEG'S</u> 
<u>STEPS</u> <u>PACE</u> <u>THE</u> <u>FLOOR</u>) I couldn't find anything else to do but pace the living 
room floor. So I paced and I paced and I paced and-- Finally, late in the 
afternoon--

SOUND: TELEPHONE RINGS ... PEG'S STEPS TO PHONE ... RECEIVER UP

PEG: Hello?

LONGMAN: (FILTER) Miss Lincoln? 

PEG: Yes?

LONGMAN: (FILTER) This is the Chief of Police, Ray Longman. 

PEG: Oh, yes. Yes.

LONGMAN: (FILTER) I checked with the telegraph company; your story's on the 
level.

PEG: (EXHALES) I already knew that.

LONGMAN: (FILTER) Yes. Well, uh, there are a couple of other developments I'd 
like to tell you about. Could you come out to my home tonight, after dinner? 

PEG: Why, yes, I guess so.

LONGMAN: (FILTER) Grant Benton'll be there.

PEG: Oh. Well, now look here, I--

LONGMAN: (FILTER) Please. It's important.

MUSIC: BRIDGE ... THEN BEHIND PEG--

SOUND: AUTO ENGINE BRIEFLY BEHIND--

PEG: (NARRATES) I wrote down the street directions -- and there were a lot of 
them because the chief's home was in the secluded hill section on the 
outskirts of town. When I arrived there, my insides were doing push-ups. But I 
was calm enough on the outside -- I hoped.

SOUND: DURING ABOVE, FADE IN NOCTURNAL BACKGROUND OF NOISILY CHIRPING CRICKETS 
... DOORBELL RINGS ... DOOR OPENS

LONGMAN: Ah, Miss Lincoln.

PEG: Oh, good evening, Chief.

SOUND: PEG'S STEPS IN ... DOOR CLOSES ... CRICKETS OUT ... ALL OF THIS 
BEHIND--

LONGMAN: I was half-expecting you to be late. Most people have trouble finding 
my house.

PEG: Oh, well, I - I started early.

SOUND: THEIR STEPS IN AGREEMENT WITH FOLLOWING AS LONGMAN FIXES A DRINK WHILE 
PEG SITS IN THE EASY CHAIR--

LONGMAN: Er, won't you sit down? 

PEG: Thank you.

LONGMAN: Take the easy chair.

PEG: Oh, thank you.

LONGMAN: (WHILE FIXING DRINK) Grant should be arriving any moment. I, er-- I 
want you to understand that-- Well, I'm not out to trick him into a confession 
or anything. It's, er-- Well, I'm hoping that the three of us can talk things 
out. The situation's become uncomfortable all around.

PEG: With Benton being your best friend, I can see where this <u>is</u> rather 
awkward for you, but--

LONGMAN: Awkward? (CHUCKLES) You know what happened this afternoon?

PEG: No. What?

LONGMAN: Grant walked in on me just as I was testing his typewriter to see if 
the print checked with the print on the fake telegram.

PEG: Oh?

LONGMAN: I felt like Benedict Arnold.

PEG: I'm sorry. (EAGERLY) Did the print check?

LONGMAN: No. (CHUCKLES, LIGHTLY) Now I know what they mean by a one-track 
mind.

PEG: There <u>are</u> other typewriters.

SOUND: DOORBELL RINGS

LONGMAN: Oh, that must be Grant now. 

PEG: (EXHALES NERVOUSLY)

LONGMAN: Now, you can take my word for it, Miss Lincoln, there's no need to be 
frightened.

PEG: (QUIETLY) All right.

LONGMAN: Good girl.

SOUND: LONGMAN'S STEPS TO DOOR, WHICH OPENS (CRICKETS IN)

LONGMAN: Ah, come in, Grant.

BENTON: Thank you, Ray. 

SOUND: BENTON'S STEPS IN ... DOOR CLOSES (CRICKETS OUT) ... THEIR STEPS IN 
AGREEMENT WITH FOLLOWING AS BENTON CONFRONTS PEG AND LONGMAN FIXES ANOTHER 
DRINK--

BENTON: (DRY) Well, what a handsome couple you two make -- our forthright 
young Chief of Police and the lovely lady who was only recently voted Miss 
Unbridled Imagination of Nineteen Fifty.

LONGMAN: All right, that's enough, Grant. Sit over there and behave yourself.

BENTON: Ah, now then, Miss Lincoln, to business. What can I do for you?

PEG: Chief Longman thinks you can convince me you're innocent. I have 
reservations.

BENTON: On what plane? 

PEG: (EXHALES UNCOMFORTABLY)

BENTON: (CHUCKLES) Where would you like me to begin?

PEG: Let's start with the fake telegram. Explain that away.

BENTON: You're starting with a beaut. That's the one thing I <u>can't</u> explain. I 
haven't the faintest idea why it was done or who did it.

PEG: But <u>you</u> didn't?

BENTON: No. (BEAT) Won't you even try to believe me?

PEG: Well, yes. Yes, I'll try. I'll even concede it was an accident when your 
car killed Patricia Smythe.

BENTON: Are you willing to believe that that blonde, Miss, er--? Whatever her 
name was, committed suicide?

PEG: Kate Nordlinger?

BENTON: Mm hm.

PEG: (SUSPICIOUS, COOL) How did you know she was a blonde?

BENTON: I read it in the paper with my big blue eyes.

PEG: The whole thing was kept out of the newspapers, and you told me that 
you'd never laid eyes on her.

LONGMAN: Pardon me for interrupting, Miss Lincoln, but I questioned Grant 
right after the suicide. At the time, I probably mentioned that the Nordlinger 
woman was blonde.

BENTON: (SMOOTHLY) You did, Chief; I distinctly remember.

PEG: Don't let him talk you into it, Chief. For heaven's sake, open your eyes! 
He's <u>it</u>! The explanation fits!

LONGMAN: What explanation?

PEG: Well, can't you see? Patricia Smythe worked as a clerk in your office and 
happened on some information that incriminated our "friend" here. There was no 
sense her telling you about it; you were too fond of Benton to believe it 
anyhow. So she went to Kate Nordlinger, a private detective, and they worked 
together on the case. Benton found out what was going on. When he learned that 
Miss Nordlinger was taking a plane to Capital City in order to talk to the 
State's Attorney, he decided to act. He'd seen Patricia Smythe around police 
headquarters plenty of times, but the Nordlinger woman he only knew by name, 
which is how he came to give <u>me</u> the poison by mistake. Don't you see?

LONGMAN: (SIGHS) I apologize, Grant. I thought Miss Lincoln understood this 
was to be a friendly meeting.

BENTON: Girls will be girls.

PEG: But listen, Chief! That's all I ask -- just listen! 

LONGMAN: Very well. Go ahead.

PEG: Well-- Through the telegram, Benton learned that Kate Nordlinger was 
staying at the Hotel Ludwig. That night while I was at the hospital, he killed 
her! He pushed her out of that window! And later he - he recognized Patricia 
Smythe coming out of my apartment building. She'd come to warn me of what I 
was getting mixed up in -- and he <u>murdered</u> her! He ran her down with his 
automobile!

LONGMAN: Now, really, Miss Lincoln, your logic--

BENTON: Never mind, Ray; she's right. I've made a couple of slips and the 
entire Supreme Court couldn't shake her loose now. (A DEEP BREATH) Very well, 
Miss Lincoln, if it makes you any happier, I killed both women. You have the 
dubious honor of having proved your point.

PEG: (EXHALES, WITH DISTASTE) You'll still be trying for laughs when they 
strap you in, won't you?

BENTON: They're not strapping me. If you care to glance at our forthright 
Chief of Police you'll notice a rather large gun in his hand. 

PEG: (STARTLED GASP)

BENTON: You'll further notice that it's pointed not at me, but at you.

LONGMAN: Sorry, Miss Lincoln. We did our best to talk you out of this. 

PEG: But--

LONGMAN: Now you've given me no choice.

BENTON: Let me tell you what our forthright Chief of Police means. He means 
that he and I run the gambling activities of this town, and people who 
interfere are apt to get hurt, very hurt. Dead, you might say.

PEG: (QUIETLY NERVOUS) I - I don't think the chief is going to shoot. 

BENTON: (CHUCKLES) There are two schools of thought on that.

PEG: I think I should mention that the - the bushes outside are thick with men 
from the State's Attorney's office.

LONGMAN: What?!

BENTON: Easy, Chief, easy.

PEG: When you telephoned to invite me here, Chief, you told me that you had 
checked with the telegraph company about that fake telegram, but later I 
talked to them again and it turned out that you <u>hadn't</u> checked! Which meant 
that you'd known about it all along. It was then that I decided to long 
distance the State's Attorney--

BENTON: You'd better leave the comedy to me, Miss Lincoln; that's not even a 
good stall.

PEG: The men outside are under orders to demand entry at the slightest 
disturbance. Fire that gun, Chief, and they'll be here like a swarm of gnats.

LONGMAN: (UNCONVINCED) And if I don't fire?

PEG: You'll take your chances in court. After all, it was Benton who actually 
killed those two women.

BENTON: If you have any qualms about this, Chief, just hand the gun over to 
me.

LONGMAN: Wait a minute, Grant. (MOVING OFF) Stay right where you are for the 
moment, both of you.

BENTON: What are you going to do with that ashtray? 

LONGMAN: (OFF) Heave it through the window. 

SOUND: DURING ABOVE EXCHANGE, LONGMAN'S STEPS TO WINDOW ... THEN LOUD CRASH! 
AS LONGMAN HEAVES ASHTRAY THROUGH GLASS WINDOW ... CRICKETS! THEN IN BG ... 
LONGMAN'S STEPS RETURN TO PEG

BENTON: There's your slight disturbance, Miss Lincoln.

PEG: (BEAT) They'll be here.

LONGMAN: We'll wait.

BENTON: (FIVE-SECOND PAUSE) That bluff went over like a lead balloon. Now if 
you'll let me have the gun, Chief--

PEG: (YELLS HYSTERICALLY, DESPERATELY) Don't give it to him, Chief! Please! 
DON'T GIVE IT TO HIM!

BENTON: Why, Miss Lincoln--!

PEG: (YELLS) WAIT A MINUTE!

BENTON: I--

LONGMAN: Quiet, Grant!

PEG: (BREATHES UNEASILY)

SOUND: CRICKETS FILL ANOTHER FIVE-SECOND PAUSE ... THEN POUNDING ON DOOR AND 
OFFICER YELLING AND POLICE DOGS BARKING, IN BG

OFFICER: (BEHIND DOOR) Open up! Come on, open up in there! Open up!

PEG: (WITH GREAT RELIEF) Oh! (SAVAGELY TRIUMPHANT) Make a joke, Mr. Benton! 
Make a joke!
