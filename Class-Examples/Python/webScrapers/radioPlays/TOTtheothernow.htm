MUSIC: THEME ... FUTURISTIC ... THEN UNDER

ANNCR: Tales of Tomorrow. Tales beyond human imagination -- until they happen.

MUSIC: ACCENT AND UNDER

ANNCR: Tales of Tomorrow. Story Number Four. 

MUSIC: ACCENT AND UNDER

ANNCR: "The Other Now," by Murray Leinster.

MUSIC: CLIMAX AND OUT

OMENTOR: This is your host, Omentor, saying hello for ABC.

MUSIC: IN AND UNDER

OMENTOR: Look at your watch. Oh, but don't take it too seriously. If it's a 
few seconds after nine p. m., Eastern Standard Time, in California it's three 
hours earlier. In London, it's two o'clock tomorrow morning. And in Japan it's 
almost tomorrow afternoon. What time is it right now on the planet Saturn? A 
silly question? I wonder. The point is, Time is a clock with many faces. Your 
time is not necessarily anyone else's, and what we think of as the present is 
only relative. Let's prove that thesis with a remarkable tale from Galaxy, the 
science fiction magazine -- a most timely story, titled, "The Other Now."

MUSIC: ACCENT AND FADE UNDER

HAYNES: (NARRATES) My name is Hal Haynes. I was Jimmy Patterson's best friend 
-- which is why he dared tell me this story you are about to hear. I'm 
speaking into a recording machine; the tape to be played back only after my 
death -- for reasons that'll become obvious as you listen. 

MUSIC: UP FOR ACCENT ... THEN BEHIND HAYNES--

HAYNES: (NARRATES) First, you've got to understand that Jimmy and Jane 
Patterson loved each other like no two other people I ever met. That's 
important to the story. It all began about a year after their marriage. They'd 
been to a party at my apartment and started home about two in the morning.

SOUND: RUNNING AUTO ENGINE IN AND UNDER

JANE: Darling?

JIMMY: Hm?

JANE: (CHUCKLES) Nothing. (CHUCKLES)

JIMMY: Well, what's so funny?

JANE: You. The way you always stick out your jaw when you're behind the wheel. 
It's kinda cute.

JIMMY: (LIGHTLY) Now, I resent that. A man is attractive, handsome, virile, 
compelling -- but <u>never</u> cute. (CHUCKLE)

JANE: (REASSURING) Darling, you're <u>all</u> those things. <u>And</u> cute. (BEAT) Jimmy, 
that truck in front of us-- What's that long pole sticking out behind it?

JIMMY: Looks like a steel girder. Yeah, that's what it is. 

JANE: Oh.

JIMMY: See the red flag?

JANE: (INHALES, LIGHTLY) Pass that truck, please.

JIMMY: What's the matter, hon'?

JANE: I don't like driving behind that thing. It makes me nervous.

JIMMY: (AMUSED) All right. Here we go.

SOUND: AUTO ENGINE REVS UP ... NEXT DIALOGUE EXCHANGES ARE VERY FAST

JIMMY: (TENSE) Jane, brace yourself!

JANE: What?

JIMMY: The truck's stopping short; air brakes!

SOUND: TIRES SQUEAL ... THEN UNDER

JANE: Jimmy! We're skidding!

JIMMY: I know! I can't stop!

JANE: (SCREAMS)

SOUND: AUTO CRASHES INTO TRUCK

MUSIC: BIG ACCENT ... THEN OUT BEHIND--

HAYNES: (NARRATES) Jimmy phoned me from the hospital. When I got there, the 
doctors told me about Jane. Death had been mercifully swift. Jimmy was sitting 
on a bench in one of the corridors, his face buried in his hands.

SOUND: HOSPITAL CORRIDOR BACKGROUND ... HAYNES' STEPS APPROACH

HAYNES: Jimmy? (NO ANSWER) Jim, it's me.

JIMMY: (HOARSE, GRIEF-STRICKEN) Did they tell ya?

HAYNES: Yeah. What can I say?

JIMMY: (EXHALES, IN DESPAIR) Oh, Hal, she's gone. She's gone.

HAYNES: I know.

JIMMY: It happened so fast. A freak accident. Doesn't make sense.

HAYNES: I know. (BEAT) Listen, anything I can do?

JIMMY: (IGNORES HIM, DISTRAUGHT) One minute she was beside me alive, and the 
next minute-- Hal, why did it have to happen this way? Why couldn't it have 
been <u>me</u>?

MUSIC: IN AND UNDER

HAYNES: (NARRATES) The next three months were bad. At first, I feared Jimmy 
might do something desperate. But soon the torture of being alive while Jane 
was dead slacked up until, from an intolerable agony, it became a dull, ever-
present ache. The worst moment was coming home from work to the empty 
apartment, so Jimmy arranged always to have the cleaning woman there. It was 
better than nothing. On the night the thing <u>really</u> began, Jimmy came home from 
work with the usual hopeless ache in his heart. Putting the key in the lock, 
he thought: if only Jane were there to meet him. If only by some miracle. 
But--

MUSIC: OUT

HAYNES: (NARRATES) --there <u>were</u> no miracles; he knew that. He unlocked the 
front door--

SOUND: FRONT DOOR UNLOCKS 

HAYNES: (NARRATES) Opened it--

SOUND: FRONT DOOR OPENS

HAYNES: (NARRATES) Began to walk in.

SOUND: JIMMY'S FOOTSTEPS

HAYNES: (NARRATES) And crashed against the door.

SOUND: JIMMY STUMBLES INTO FRONT DOOR

HAYNES: (NARRATES) It was closed. He'd just opened it, but it was closed. 
Jimmy's first impression was that his brain was playing tricks on him. Had he 
<u>really</u> opened that door? It seemed to him that he had. But in his confused 
state of mind, he couldn't be absolutely sure. He unlocked the door again.

SOUND: FRONT DOOR UNLOCKS 

HAYNES: (NARRATES) Or <u>was</u> it again? Opened it--

SOUND: FRONT DOOR OPENS

HAYNES: (NARRATES) And walked into the apartment.

SOUND: JIMMY'S STEPS IN ... FRONT DOOR CLOSES

HAYNES: (NARRATES) The cleaning woman, Mrs. Mooney, was in the living room.

SOUND: JIMMY'S STEPS IN 

JIMMY: Hello, Mrs. Mooney.

MOONEY: Oh, Mr. Patterson. How do you feel today, sir?

JIMMY: Fine, thanks.

MOONEY: You didn't sleep again last night, sir.

JIMMY: 'Course I did.

MOONEY: When I came in this afternoon, the bed was still made up, just as I'd 
left it yesterday.

JIMMY: I fell asleep in the armchair. Please stop checking on me, Mrs. Mooney.

MOONEY: I don't want you to think of it that way, Mr. Patterson. But you 
haven't been yourself since the missus-- Well, what I mean is, I'm worried 
about you.

JIMMY: There's nothing to worry about. (BEAT) Anyone phone while you've been 
here?

MOONEY: Mr. Haynes called.

JIMMY: What'd he want?

MOONEY: Said he hadn't heard from ya for a couple of days. Wants you to call 
him back, sir.

JIMMY: Thanks, I'll do that. Anything else?

MOONEY: Yes, I - I found this carton of cigarettes in the missus' desk.

JIMMY: (MILDLY SURPRISED) Those are Jane's.

MOONEY: Yes, sir.

JIMMY: Must have overlooked them when I cleaned out the desk.

MOONEY: What should I--?

JIMMY: (DISMISSIVE) Throw 'em out. (CHANGES MIND) No. No, just a second. Put 
them back in the desk.

MOONEY: All right, sir.

JIMMY: (TROUBLED) Before you do that, Mrs. Mooney, there's, uh, something I, 
uh, want to ask you. (BEAT) Did you hear me come in just now?

MOONEY: (SURPRISED) Yes, sir.

JIMMY: Well, did you notice if I opened the front door <u>once</u> -- or twice?

MOONEY: (PUZZLED) Why would you open the door twice, sir?

JIMMY: I don't know if I did; that's what I'm trying to find out. Did you hear 
the door open twice?

MOONEY: I really couldn't say, Mr. Patterson.

JIMMY: Well, think back. Try to remember.

MOONEY: (THOUGHTFUL) Well, you <u>did</u> open it twice, sir.

JIMMY: Are you sure?

MOONEY: I think so, but-- Maybe I just imagined it. (CHANGES SUBJECT) You 
don't look so good, Mr. Patterson. You ought to take a nap before dinner.

JIMMY: I'm all right.

MOONEY: No, you aren't. <u>I</u> think--

JIMMY: (FORCEFUL) Please, Mrs. Mooney, stop fussing over me! (BEAT, QUIETLY) 
Just - leave me alone.

MUSIC: IN AND UNDER

HAYNES: (NARRATES) Jimmy took sleeping pills that night. When he finally 
drifted off, he dreamed of doors that were open when they should have been 
shut, and shut when they should have been open. During work the next day, the 
peculiar incident of the night before was in the back of his mind. And when he 
came home that night, he opened the door carefully--

SOUND: FRONT DOOR OPENS

HAYNES: (NARRATES) --wondering if it would be repeated.

MUSIC: OUT

HAYNES: (NARRATES) It wasn't.

SOUND: FRONT DOOR CLOSES ... JIMMY'S STEPS IN

HAYNES: (NARRATES) He hung up his coat and sat down in the armchair. 

SOUND: JIMMY SITS

HAYNES: (NARRATES) Wearily, he filled his pipe and struck a match to it. 
(BEAT) As he dropped the stub of the match into the ashtray--

JIMMY: (SURPRISED, TO HIMSELF) What's this? Cigarette stubs. <u>Jane's</u> brand. 
Freshly smoked. (CALLS) Mrs. Mooney! (NO ANSWER, LOUDER) Mrs. Mooney!

SOUND: INNER DOOR OPENS ... MRS. MOONEY'S STEPS IN

MOONEY: You want me, sir?

JIMMY: (ANGRY) I certainly do. Mrs. Mooney, who gave you permission to smoke 
my wife's cigarettes?

MOONEY: (CONFUSED) What's that, sir?

JIMMY: What right have you to smoke my wife's cigarettes?!

MOONEY: But I - I didn't do anything of the sort, Mr. Patterson. I don't know 
what you're talking about.

JIMMY: Well, right here in this ashtray are half a dozen of her--! (BEAT, 
STUNNED) They're gone.

MOONEY: Gone?

JIMMY: Cigarette butts-- They were in this ashtray a minute ago. Now they've 
disappeared.

MOONEY: Couldn't have been nothing in that tray, sir. I emptied all the 
ashtrays when I came in.

JIMMY: But I <u>saw</u> them. (BEAT, TO HIMSELF) Or did I? (BEAT) What's the matter 
with me? I-- Or <u>is</u> it me?

MUSIC: IN AND UNDER

HAYNES: (NARRATES) Was he losing his grip? In a grim sort of way, the thought 
made Jimmy feel almost cheerful. During the day, work was a godsend. Sometimes 
he was able to thrust aside for hours the fact that Jane had gone. Now, in the 
same way, he grappled with the question of his sanity. When Mrs. Mooney left 
for the evening, he went to the desk where Jane had kept her household 
accounts. He set the whole thing down on paper, examined it methodically, 
checking all the facts. He was about to do so when he noticed Jane's diary on 
top of the desk. For a moment, his mind stopped; his brain reeled.

JIMMY: (TO HIMSELF) Jane's diary. What's it doing here? I - thought I'd locked 
it in the trunk. (BEAT) I <u>know</u> I put it in the trunk.

MUSIC: UP FOR A CHILLING ACCENT ... THEN UNDER

HAYNES: (NARRATES) He sat there, staring at the diary. It <u>couldn't</u> be on the 
desk. He'd locked it in the trunk, but there it was. With trembling fingers he 
thumbed through the pages until he reached the last entry.

JIMMY: (TO HIMSELF) September twenty-sixth? September twenty-sixth -- today's 
date! But that's impossible. How could this have been written today? Jane's 
dead. (BEAT, UNNERVED) And yet that's her handwriting.

MUSIC: UP FOR SHIVERY ACCENT ... THEN HAUNTING AND EERIE UNDER

HAYNES: (NARRATES) Feeling like a sleepwalker in a nightmare, he began to read 
the entry, and as he scanned the lines it was as though Jane's voice was in 
the room.

JANE: (FILTER) This morning I went to the cemetery. It's very bad. Three 
months since the accident. Time doesn't make it any easier to bear. Oh, Jimmy! 
Jimmy, I miss you so much.

JIMMY: (ASTONISHED) Jane?

JANE: (FILTER) Developing a personal hatred for chance. Chance, luck, whatever 
it is -- it's not an abstraction any more. It was chance that killed Jimmy. 
Could have been me instead, or neither of us. Standing over Jimmy's grave 
today, I realized that -- and it was almost more than I could stand.

MUSIC: UP FOR ACCENT ... THEN UNDER

JIMMY: (TO HIMSELF, WITH CERTAINTY) She's alive. She wrote this. She thinks 
I'm the one that's dead.

HAYNES: (NARRATES) Taking a pen, Jimmy began writing desperately under Jane's 
entry in the diary.

SOUND: SCRIBBLE! OF PEN ON PAPER ... THEN BEHIND--

JIMMY: (HALTINGLY, AS HE WRITES) Jane, where are you? I'm not dead. I thought 
<u>you</u> were. In Heaven's name, where are you?

HAYNES: (NARRATES) After that, Jimmy's mind went blank. When he came to his 
senses again, he was sitting at an empty desk -- no diary on it, and no pen 
between his fingers.

JIMMY: (TENSE, TO HIMSELF) Where is it? That diary -- where is it? (BEAT, 
DISHEARTENED) Aw, I must have dreamed it. Fallen asleep in the chair and 
dreamed it. (BEAT) No. No, it was here! I could swear it was here! I wrote an 
entry underneath Jane's. Or did I? Am I imagining things? I've got to find 
out. There must be some way to get to the bottom of this.

MUSIC: UP FOR AN ACCENT AND OUT

HAYNES: (NARRATES) The next morning, Jimmy bought a small camera with a 
flashbulb attachment. That night when he came home from the office, he had the 
camera ready. He unlocked the door--

SOUND: FRONT DOOR UNLOCKS 

HAYNES: (NARRATES) --and opened it.

SOUND: FRONT DOOR OPENS 

HAYNES: (NARRATES) Then before he walked in, he put out his hand; struck wood.

SOUND: SMACK! OF HAND AGAINST FRONT DOOR

HAYNES: (NARRATES) The door was still closed. He stepped back, quickly aimed 
the camera at the door, and snapped the shutter.

SOUND: SNAP! OF SHUTTER

HAYNES: (NARRATES) The glare of the flashbulb blinded him for a moment. But 
when he was able to see again, the door was open.

MOONEY: (OFF) That you, Mr. Patterson?

JIMMY: Yes, it's me.

SOUND: MRS. MOONEY'S STEPS IN

MOONEY: (APPROACHES) I thought I heard something.

JIMMY: (SHEEPISH) I, er-- I was just taking a picture.

MOONEY: A picture?

JIMMY: Look, Mrs. Mooney, are you finished with your work?

MOONEY: I thought I'd just get the laundry together and take it out with me.

JIMMY: (FIRMLY) Let that go until tomorrow. Good night, Mrs. Mooney.

MUSIC: IN AND BEHIND HAYNES--

HAYNES: (NARRATES) Jimmy waited impatiently until the cleaning woman was gone. 
Then he moved the film in the camera and put in a new flashbulb. Walking to 
the desk, he hardly dared to hope the diary would be there again, but there it 
was -- open -- with a ruler across the pages to keep it so. He saw yesterday's 
entry and his own message. And beyond that was more writing in Jane's hand.

JANE: (FILTER) Jimmy! Darling! When I opened the diary today, I found a 
message from <u>you</u> -- as though you were alive. I - know that can't be; it's all 
imaginary wish fulfillment and I'm crazy to answer you, but-- (INHALES) 
Please, darling -- if I am sane and you are alive somewhere, <u>tell</u> me where you 
are.

HAYNES: (NARRATES) With all his being, Jimmy wanted to write his reply, but he 
was afraid to spend the additional time. He aimed the camera at the diary and 
pressed the shutter button for the second time.

SOUND: SNAP! OF SHUTTER

JIMMY: (TO HIMSELF) The diary. It disappeared again. Where did it go to? Where 
did it come from in the first place? What's happening here? (BEAT, DECISIVE) 
Wherever that diary is, that's where Jane is. I've got to find her.

MUSIC: BIG ACCENT ... THEN BEHIND HAYNES--

HAYNES: (NARRATES) That's the story Jimmy told me. Now, I'm a lawyer, trained 
to take testimony. I mention the fact because I want it understood that I have 
not colored this story in any way. I've told it exactly as Jimmy told it to me 
-- flatly and baldly, without any attempt to make it sound reasonable. As 
Jimmy said--

JIMMY: Well, that's it, Hal. That's exactly how it all happened.

HAYNES: But, look here, it's impossible.

JIMMY: I don't blame you for feeling that way about it. I'd say the same thing 
-- <u>if</u> I didn't have evidence to the contrary.

HAYNES: Evidence? You mean those photographs?

JIMMY: That's right.

HAYNES: Let me have a look at them.

SOUND: PHOTO HANDED OVER BEHIND--

JIMMY: Sure. There's the first one -- the shot of the door. Looks like a 
double exposure, doesn't it?

HAYNES: (EXAMINES PHOTO) Hmm. You've got two doors here, nearly at right 
angles, both hung from the same door frame.

SOUND: PHOTO HANDED OVER BEHIND--

JIMMY: Here's the second shot. If you look close, you may be able to read 
Jane's handwriting on the page of the diary.

HAYNES: Yeah. (READS) "Jimmy darling, when I opened the diary today, I found a 
message from you -- as though you were alive."

JIMMY: Well, Hal? Do you still say it's impossible?

HAYNES: Yes.

JIMMY: But, Hal--

HAYNES: Jim, I'm your friend. You believe that, don't ya?

JIMMY: Sure I do, but you can't--

HAYNES: Now, there's a perfectly logical explanation for these incidents. Not 
a pleasant explanation, but the only one that makes any sense. Now, that door 
opening and closing, Jane's cigarettes in the ashtray-- You saw all that 
because you wanted to see it. You made it up; not consciously -- but out of 
your desperation. Now, you <u>had</u> to believe that somehow, somewhere Jane is 
still alive.

JIMMY: (SIMPLY) I do believe that, Hal.

HAYNES: But, man, can't you see you're kidding yourself?

JIMMY: If so, how do you explain the photograph of that door?

HAYNES: Trick photography. You covered half the film and exposed with the door 
closed. Then you exposed the other half of the film with the door open.

JIMMY: Maybe an expert photographer could do that, but I never even owned a 
camera until yesterday.

HAYNES: Look, you followed directions when you took those shots, didn't ya?

JIMMY: Yes.

HAYNES: Well, then you must have been following directions when you took that 
trick shot of the door.

JIMMY: Okay, okay. But how do you explain the second photograph -- the one 
with Jane's handwriting? Now, you were Jane's lawyer; you'd recognize her 
handwriting, wouldn't ya?

HAYNES: I suppose so.

JIMMY: Look at that photograph. (BEAT) Isn't that Jane's handwriting?

HAYNES: (EXHALES) Looks like hers, but it could be a forgery.

JIMMY: Forgery? But who would want to forge--?

HAYNES: <u>You</u> would, Jim.

JIMMY: (INCREDULOUS) I wou--?

HAYNES: That's right. Now, I had a client once; a girl. She accused a man of 
beating her up. She was absolutely sincere; she really believed it. But her 
own family admitted that <u>she'd</u> made the marks on herself. And the doctors 
agreed that she'd unconsciously blotted the memory of doing it out of her mind 
afterward.

JIMMY: (QUIETLY) You think I forged all this unconsciously?

HAYNES: But what other possibility is there?

JIMMY: Remember the accident, Hal? Now, we came up behind that truck. When we 
skidded into it, the girder could have hit me -- or Jane, or neither of us.

HAYNES: What does that prove?

JIMMY: It was pure chance that Jane was hit. It could have been me. If it <u>had</u> 
been me, Jane would be living in the apartment. She might very well have 
written that entry in the diary, isn't that so?

HAYNES: What's the point?

JIMMY: The point is this. (SLOWLY AND CLEARLY) There are a lot of possible 
futures. When today was in the future, there were a lot of possible todays. 
The present moment is only one of any number of presents that might have been. 
Now, that night before the girder came through our windshield, there were 
three possibilities: one in which I was hit, one in which neither one of us 
was hit, and one in which-- Well, you <u>do</u> see what I'm getting at, Hal?

HAYNES: Are you really suggesting there's more than one present? That in some 
other present Jane is alive and you're the one that's dead?

JIMMY: That's it, Hal. Some other dimension in time or space through which 
Jane and I have managed to communicate.

HAYNES: But - but <u>how</u>?

JIMMY: Well, it's beyond me, but there must be some scientific explanation.

HAYNES: Aw, Jim, you aren't serious.

JIMMY: Why not?! Before the atomic bomb exploded, all reasonable people said 
atomic energy was preposterous. Every new discovery, every new step forward is 
preposterous. Until it happens!

MUSIC: BIG ACCENT ... THEN UNDER

HAYNES: (NARRATES) I couldn't shake Jimmy's argument. After he left, I tried 
to decide on some course of action. Treat him as insane? But he was my friend. 
Besides, his delusion wasn't dangerous, not even to himself. I decided to wait 
for developments. 

MUSIC: GENTLY OUT FOR--

SOUND: RESTAURANT BACKGROUND (DINERS MURMUR, ET CETERA) 

HAYNES: (NARRATES) One evening about a week later, Jimmy and I had dinner 
together. He seemed to be in good spirits. He looked over the menu.

JIMMY: What're you going to order, Hal?

HAYNES: Uh, steak.

JIMMY: (AMUSED, UPBEAT) Me, too. (BEAT) Well, what's new, counselor?

HAYNES: Well, I was about to ask you that. (BEAT) Have you, um--? Have you had 
any more communication with Jane?

JIMMY: (VERY CASUAL) Oh, sure. We write each other notes every night. And, by 
the way, I was right, Hal. Jane agrees there <u>is</u> more than one present. Now, in 
the present I exist in, Jane was killed. But in <u>her</u> present, I'm the one 
that's dead.

HAYNES: Oh, look, let's not get into that again.

JIMMY: I don't mind talking about it. Now that I know Jane's alive, life is 
bearable. (BEAT) Matter of fact, there's only one drawback.

HAYNES: Only one drawback, huh? What's that?

JIMMY: Well, now that Jane and I have found each other, we'd - like to get 
together. Some day we hope to be able to bridge that gap.

HAYNES: Isn't that rather far-fetched?

JIMMY: No, no. No, sometimes when Jane and I are writing notes to each other, 
both of us can - can <u>feel</u> the barrier between us wearing thin. Once it seemed 
to me that we actually touched hands, but I wasn't sure.

HAYNES: (SORROWFUL) Jim-- Aw, Jim--

JIMMY: (INNOCENTLY) What's the matter?

HAYNES: (RESIGNED) Aw, nothing. Go on with what you were saying.

MUSIC: IN AND BEHIND HAYNES--

HAYNES: (NARRATES) I let him go on -- describing what he wrote to Jane and 
what she wrote to him, and how they both yearned for the time when the barrier 
between them would disappear and they'd be together again. That continued for 
several weeks. Then one night as we were sitting in the park--

SOUND: NOCTURNAL PARK BACKGROUND (CRICKETS CHIRP, ET CETERA) 

JIMMY: Hal, remember what I told you about the barrier wearing thin?

HAYNES: Sure, yeah.

JIMMY: Well, Jane and I, we're pretty close now. I'm almost certain I saw her 
in the living room last night.

HAYNES: Jimmy, listen--

JIMMY: Disappeared before I could get to her. If I could only put my hands on 
her. If I could - touch her just once.

HAYNES: Jim, you've got to stop this.

JIMMY: What?

HAYNES: Do something about these hallucinations.

JIMMY: Hold on, Hal--

HAYNES: Don't you see they're progressive? It started with seeing notes and 
cigarette butts, and <u>now</u> - you're seeing people.

JIMMY: (TENSE) You trying to tell me I'm losing my mind?

HAYNES: No, but I think you ought to have a talk with a psychiatrist. With the 
proper treatment those hallucinations would disappear. But if you don't get 
help, this--

JIMMY: (INSISTENT) I don't need any help. There's nothing wrong with me. 
(BEAT, QUIETLY) My contacts with Jane are not hallucinations and I can prove 
it.

HAYNES: How?

JIMMY: (INHALES) Look, Hal, didn't you have a near-accident on the parkway 
last night? Didn't a car coming around a curve on the wrong side of the road 
almost smash head-on into you?

HAYNES: (SURPRISED) Why, yes, it did. I almost went into the ditch trying to 
get away from it. (BEAT) How did <u>you</u> know that?

JIMMY: (SIMPLY) Jane told me.

HAYNES: Jane?

JIMMY: She said that, in her time channel, a crash killed Tony Shields.

HAYNES: You - you mean Tony Shields was the driver of that other car?

JIMMY: That's what Jane says.

HAYNES: But it's impossible!

JIMMY: (THERE'S YOUR PROOF) There. Jane doesn't lie, Hal. Why don't you check 
with Tony?

MUSIC: BRIDGE

SOUND: PHONE RINGS AND IS ANSWERED (CALLER'S PERSPECTIVE)

TONY: (FILTER) Hello?

HAYNES: That you, Tony?

TONY: (FILTER) Yes?

HAYNES: This is Hal Haynes. Look, Tony, there's a little thing that's been 
bothering me; I'd like to ask you about it. Were you driving your car on the 
parkway last night?

TONY: (FILTER) Yeah, I was.

HAYNES: You sure it was last night?

TONY: (FILTER) Well, sure, I'm sure. Why? What's up, Hal?

HAYNES: Well, did you almost run into another car coming around that curve 
near Hawthorne?

TONY: (FILTER, SURPRISED) Why, that's right. Oh, say, Hal, how'd you know 
that? (NO ANSWER) Hal, are you still on the line? Didja hear me?

HAYNES: (STUNNED) Yeah. Yeah, I heard ya. I was the driver of the other car, 
Tony.

TONY: (FILTER) Well, I'll be hanged. Talk about a small world. Say, Hal, I owe 
you an apology. I was on the wrong side of the road. Musta scared ya half to 
death.

HAYNES: Yeah. Yeah, you certainly did.

TONY: (FILTER) I'm sorry, Hal, but, uh-- There's one thing I don't get. It was 
pretty dark last night; how'd you recognize me?

HAYNES: (FEEBLY) Well, I, uh, wasn't quite sure. That's why I phoned.

MUSIC: BIG ACCENT ... THEN UNDER

HAYNES: (NARRATES) I hung up, feeling dizzy. Jane had told the truth. But Jane 
was dead. But if she was dead, how could she know about Tony Shields and what 
happened on the parkway? It made no sense -- no sense at all -- unless Jane 
actually existed in some other level or dimension. But that was nonsense. 
Sheer nonsense. Still, I had to talk to Jimmy.

SOUND: PHONE RECEIVER UP 

HAYNES: (NARRATES) I dialed his number.

MUSIC: OUT 

SOUND: ROTARY DIAL (SIX DIGITS) ... PHONE RINGS (CALLER'S PERSPECTIVE), THEN 
CONTINUES IN BG

HAYNES: (NARRATES) The phone rang a number of times. I was about to give up 
when--

SOUND: PHONE IS ANSWERED (CALLER'S PERSPECTIVE)

JIMMY: (FILTER, AGITATED) Hello?

HAYNES: Jim? This is Hal. I gotta talk to you.

JIMMY: (FILTER, QUICKLY) Not now. I'm very busy.

HAYNES: But this is important. I just spoke to Tony--

JIMMY: (FILTER, URGENT) Please, Hal, hang up.

HAYNES: All right, I'm coming over to your place.

JIMMY: (FILTER, QUICKLY) No, you can't do that! I don't want you here now! 
(BEAT, QUIETLY TENSE) Hal, Jane and I are very close. The barrier's getting 
thin. Paper thin. We've touched each other again.

HAYNES: When did this happen?

JIMMY: (FILTER) Just now, before you phoned. We're hoping -- hoping and 
praying -- that the time barrier is about to break.

HAYNES: (DISTURBED) But it can't! What would happen if you turned up where she 
is, or if she turned up here?

JIMMY: (FILTER) I don't know, but we'd be together and that's all we care 
about.

HAYNES: Aw, but, Jim, listen to me--

JIMMY: (FILTER, HARSH WHISPER) Shut up, Hal! (BEAT) She's - she's here.

HAYNES: What?

JIMMY: (FILTER, SLOWLY, IN AWE) She's come through the barrier. Here in this 
room. I see her. (TO JANE) Jane, is it really you?

JANE: (FILTER) (EXHALES, LIGHTLY) Who else would it be? (WARMLY, DEEPLY) 
Hello, darling.

JIMMY: (FILTER, HAPPY) Jane!

SOUND: PHONE DISCONNECTS (CALLER'S PERSPECTIVE)

HAYNES: Jimmy? (NO ANSWER) Jimmy?!

MUSIC: ACCENT AND UNDER

HAYNES: (NARRATES) He'd hung up on me. I dialed his number again. The phone 
rang and rang; no answer. I gave up and tried to figure it out. That woman's 
voice I heard over the phone-- Had I actually heard it? <u>Was</u> it Jane? Or was I 
becoming affected myself? I had to know. I went to Jimmy's apartment.

MUSIC: OUT WITH--

SOUND: DOORBELL RINGS ... NO ANSWER ... RINGS AGAIN ... THEN INSISTENTLY 
UNTIL [X]

HAYNES: (NARRATES) I rang the bell. Kept ringing and ringing. No one answered. 
[X] I tried to open the front door.

SOUND: BRIEF RATTLE OF LOCKED DOOR

HAYNES: (NARRATES) It was locked.

SOUND: RATTLE OF DOORKNOB

HAYNES: (NARRATES) The back door was locked, too. 

SOUND: RATTLE OF ANOTHER DOORKNOB

HAYNES: (NARRATES) The windows were shuttered.

SOUND: RATTLE OF WINDOW SHUTTERS; BANGING ON SHUTTERS

HAYNES: (NARRATES) There was no way to get in.

MUSIC: ACCENT THEN BEHIND HAYNES--

HAYNES: (NARRATES) I tried to phone Jimmy the next morning; no answer. I 
called his office at noon; he hadn't been there. Finally I went to the police 
and talked to Detective Thatcher. Thatcher and a couple of patrolmen went to 
the apartment; they forced the front door, got into the place, searched it, 
and found nothing. I was in the living room smoking a hopeless cigarette when 
Thatcher came to me.

THATCHER: All right, Mr. Haynes, let's have it.

HAYNES: Uh, have what?

THATCHER: This is a joke, ain't it?

HAYNES: Certainly not.

THATCHER: Now, look, mister, you tell us you're worried about your friend. We 
come here and find every darn window locked from the inside. Nobody here; 
nothing.

HAYNES: Well-- What's the gag?

THATCHER: How did he get out of the apartment and still leave all the doors 
and windows locked from the inside? He didn't disappear into thin air, did he?

MUSIC: ACCENT THEN BEHIND HAYNES--

HAYNES: (NARRATES) What could I say? That Jimmy had escaped into the Other 
Now? That he was alive on some other level or dimension of existence as yet 
unknown to us? Thatcher would have taken me straight down to the psychiatric 
ward. I said nothing. The police dragged ponds and rivers for Jimmy's body, 
put out missing person bulletins, and so forth. Eventually it was recorded 
that Jimmy left town -- and everybody accepted that obvious explanation. <u>I'm</u> 
the only one who knows what actually happened to Jimmy Patterson. So I'm 
setting this down for the record, to be placed in my safe deposit vault, and 
opened only after my death. You can't blame me. Would you care to spend the 
rest of <u>your</u> life in a - a straitjacket?
