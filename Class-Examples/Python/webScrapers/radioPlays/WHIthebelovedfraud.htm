<h1>The Beloved Fraud</h1><pre>The Whistler
The Beloved Fraud
Oct 30 1944


<u>CAST</u>:
ANNOUNCER
THE WHISTLER
EMMA, snobbish, dominant
CONSTANCE, girlish, submissive
DOROTHY, servant
JULIAN, charming rogue



ANNOUNCER: Let every "Go" signal remind you that you <u>do</u> go farther with Signal 
Gasoline.

MUSIC: HARP GLISSANDO

ANNOUNCER: The Signal Oil Program.

MUSIC: HARP GLISSANDO ... PUNCTUATED BY TWO DRUMBEATS

ANNOUNCER: The Signal Oil Company and your neighborhood Signal dealer bring 
you another curious story by - THE WHISTLER. Tonight, "The Beloved Fraud."

MUSIC: WHISTLER THEME ... THEN IN BG

WHISTLER: I am the Whistler, and I know many things, for I walk by night. I 
know many strange tales, many secrets hidden in the hearts of men and women 
who have stepped into the shadows. Presently, I'll tell you of nameless 
terrors they dare not speak.

MUSIC: UP AND OUT

ANNOUNCER: In a moment, the Whistler will tell you his gripping story. But 
first-- Signal Oil Company brings you an urgent message from the War 
Department. 

Smokeless powder for explosives -- thousands of tons of it -- are needed daily 
on the battlefronts. But do you know that sixty percent of all smokeless 
powder is made from pulp wood, the same pulp wood used to make paper? That's 
why Donald Nelson stated, "The most critical raw material problem facing our 
war effort today is the shortage of all forest products, including pulp wood." 
It's why everyone on the home front is being asked to help by cutting down on 
the use and waste of paper. Uncle Sam suggests that you accept items from the 
store unwrapped whenever possible. Bring back paper bags for reuse and save 
every newspaper, magazine, carton, and especially brown wrapping paper for the 
salvage drive. You see, seven hundred thousand items of war going overseas all 
need the paper you're being asked to save. Each five-hundred-pound bomb, for 
instance, takes twelve pounds of paper. So when you save paper, however little 
it is, you're doing your part to speed vital weapons that will end the war 
sooner.

And now, the Whistler.

MUSIC: THE SERIES' STANDARD INTRODUCTION ... THEN BEHIND WHISTLER--

WHISTLER: Bitterness, like wine, matures with age. And high on a dismal and 
wind-swept hill, on the outskirts of a small New England factory town, sits a 
house in which bitterness is a living thing, a companionable presence. It's an 
old house -- weather-beaten, run-down -- with perhaps a touch of its own 
bitterness, a silent lament for splendor long gone. There was a time, back in 
Nineteen Five, when bitterness was young and splendor was still present, and 
the Woodford sisters sat in the comfortable parlor before the winter's fire 
and read poetry to each other: Emma -- graying, commanding, the protector; 
Constance -- the younger, timid, yielding.

EMMA: (FADES IN, READS, FROM BROWNING'S "THE SWEETNESS OF ENGLAND") 
All poets use the skies, the clouds, the fields,
The happy violets hiding from the roads,
The primroses run down to, carrying gold;
The tangled hedgerows, where the cows push out 
Impatient horns and tolerant, churning mouths
'Twixt dripping ash-boughs, -- hedgerows all alive
With birds and gnats and large white butterflies--
(BREAKS OFF, SHARPLY) <u>Constance</u>?

CONSTANCE: (STARTLED EXCLAMATION) Yes, Emma?

EMMA: Constance, aren't you interested?

CONSTANCE: Yes, Emma.

EMMA: You've always been very receptive to the works of Mrs. Elizabeth Barrett 
Browning. You seem on edge. What's the matter?

CONSTANCE: Nothing. Nothing really, Emma.

EMMA: <u>Something's</u> the matter. Don't lie to me, Constance. You've been fussing 
and fretting all day, peeking out the window--

CONSTANCE: Oh, Emma, for pity's sake--

EMMA: (STERNLY) Constance!

CONSTANCE: I'm sorry. But I was only looking out the window. I thought perhaps 
Mr. Willoughby might be coming by. He usually passes about this time.

EMMA: And why should you be so interested in the mailman? Were you expecting a 
letter?

CONSTANCE: You know I'm not. You know how seldom anything comes for me. Only 
once in a while from Aunt Sarah or - somebody like that.

EMMA: Constance, I don't believe you're happy.

CONSTANCE: Happy? Hadn't thought about it. Not that way. I don't know, Emma.

EMMA: After <u>all</u> I've tried to do for you.

CONSTANCE: Yes, I know, Emma. Oh, please don't think me ungrateful. You've 
been wonderful.

EMMA: I've been a mother to you, Constance, ever since dear Mama left us.

CONSTANCE: I know, I know.

EMMA: And now you tell me you're not happy here -- act bored and fidgety -- 
almost like I was keeping you prisoner. Always wanting to go out.

CONSTANCE: But if only we went out just once in a while. If only for a walk in 
the village--

EMMA: It's not a fit place for ladies to walk unescorted.

CONSTANCE: No, I suppose not. But we never have anyone to escort us -- <u>ever</u>. 
And there's-- (GETS AN IDEA) Emma! Perhaps old Mr. Willoughby would escort us 
to the village sometime.

EMMA: Constance, have you lost your mind? A postman!

CONSTANCE: But he's a very nice old gentleman. He's the only person I ever see 
except Dorothy. And I like him.

EMMA: (INSULTED) The only people you ever see. The postman and our 
housekeeper. And what about me?

CONSTANCE: Oh, you. Of course you, Emma. I always see you.

EMMA: But you'd rather be with the others. Oh, yes, don't think I don't know 
how Dorothy brings you tea in your room and sits and talks -- a common 
housekeeper.

CONSTANCE: But she's very nice, Emma, and genteel, too; you said so yourself 
when you hired her. A good family, you said, not like a servant at all.

EMMA: But she <u>is</u> a servant now, Constance. <u>Our</u> servant. I've heard you 
laughing when you thought I wasn't around.

CONSTANCE: (TEARFUL) But why shouldn't we laugh a little? Why shouldn't people 
laugh and have fun; be happy? (WEEPS) Oh, Emma! (WEEPS, IN BG)

EMMA: There, there. Now, don't cry, dear. Of course you should be happy. 
That's what I've tried to do for you. 

CONSTANCE: I know.

EMMA: Because I love you, my dear, and because I promised Mama that I'd look 
after you, make a home for you.

CONSTANCE: I know. I'm sorry to be so hateful, Emma. You know I appreciate 
what you've done.

EMMA: Well, let's say no more about this now, dear. You run up to your room 
and dry your tears. I'll have Dorothy bring up a warm cup of tea. And then you 
and she can have your talk. (BEAT) You'd probably planned on that anyway.

CONSTANCE: Oh, Emma, don't be angry about Dorothy. It's not that I enjoy her 
more than you, honestly. It's - it's just that she tells me things. Things 
about the outside, the city, the world, people. I like that.

EMMA: You're tired of your home here, aren't you, Constance?

CONSTANCE: No, Emma, I'm not. It's a very nice home; I know that. Only, I <u>had</u> 
hoped that I might see the city, go on a holiday, a little trip or something. 
But you always say no.

EMMA: Yes, dear, I always say no. (BEAT) And I know what's best for you.

MUSIC: BRIDGE ... THEN BEHIND WHISTLER--

WHISTLER: Yes, sister Emma knows best, Constance. She's always known best. And 
before her, it was dear Mama whom she adored. You should be grateful to have 
someone else looking out for you, taking care of you, running your life for 
you. But you're not, are you, Constance? You're unhappy -- desperately 
unhappy.

CONSTANCE: (WEEPS QUIETLY, IN BG)

SOUND: DOOR OPENS ... DOROTHY'S STEPS IN ... RATTLE OF TEA TRAY

DOROTHY: Here you are, Miss Constance. Some nice hot tea.

CONSTANCE: Oh. Oh, thank you, Dorothy. 

DOROTHY: There, there, there, dear. Now you mustn't carry on so. Crying spoils 
your pretty eyes.

CONSTANCE: Oh, Dorothy, what am I to do?

DOROTHY: Do? There's precious little you <u>can</u> do -- with her running you like 
you didn't have a mind of your own.

CONSTANCE: But I <u>do</u> have a mind of my own. I'm not a child.

DOROTHY: Of course you're not. You're a grown woman. And you're not getting 
any younger. If ever you're going to get out of here and find happiness, 
you'll have to do it soon.

CONSTANCE: I know. I know. Perhaps it's too late now. That's what I keep 
telling myself.

DOROTHY: Too late? Fiddlesticks. You're only thirty-five. And there are plenty 
of gentlemen who'd find you very attractive.

CONSTANCE: Do you think so, Dorothy? Do you really think so?

DOROTHY: Of course I do. If ever she'd let you go into town by yourself, you'd 
see. The men would stare.

CONSTANCE: Oh, Dorothy, we shouldn't talk like this. What would Emma say?

DOROTHY: She'd say it was wicked, no doubt, because she hates men. <u>Why</u>, I 
don't know. But she's wrong. Why should it be wicked for a woman to want the 
men to notice her? It's natural. Every woman should have the attentions of a 
man, fall in love, get married.

CONSTANCE: Do you really think so, Dorothy?

DOROTHY: Of course. And you'll find one yet, don't you worry.

CONSTANCE: Oh, it's not that. I've never thought really and truly about 
getting married or anything like that. Never seemed that I was <u>meant</u> for 
anything like that. But just to meet people -- other women, and men. See 
something besides the insides of this house.

DOROTHY: Oh, I know, I know, and you <u>shall</u>. Why shouldn't you leave her and 
live your own life?

CONSTANCE: But she'd never let me do it. She's so strong and she'd find a way 
to stop me, bring me back.

DOROTHY: Perhaps I can help you.

SOUND: TEACUP SET DOWN ON TRAY

CONSTANCE: (SURPRISED) You, Dorothy?

DOROTHY: Yes, Miss Constance. What you need is a man. A man who will come and 
take you out of here. Then Emma would have nothing to say about it.

CONSTANCE: But where? Where would I meet a man? No one ever comes here.

DOROTHY: Perhaps one will -- if we work it right.

CONSTANCE: What do you mean, Dorothy?

DOROTHY: I have a cousin. He's a fine man, a widower, and just the type for 
you. I'm sure you and he would find each other very interesting.

CONSTANCE: But does he live here? In the village?

DOROTHY: No. No, he lives in New York.

CONSTANCE: In New York? The city?

DOROTHY: Mm hm.

CONSTANCE: Oh, but, Dorothy, how will I ever meet him?

DOROTHY: By letter. I'll write and tell him about you, give him your 
permission to write. You'll have many things to say to each other. And 
perhaps-- Who knows what may come of it?

MUSIC: BRIDGE ... THEN BEHIND WHISTLER--

WHISTLER: And that was the beginning, wasn't it, Constance? Remember how you 
waited for his first letter -- half afraid that it <u>would</u> come, half fearful 
that it wouldn't? And then how you hid it until Emma had gone to bed? And then 
pored over every word again and again until after dawn? In a later one, he 
sent you his picture; Julian, handsome, a trifle slick-looking, not like the 
country men in the village. You sent him your picture and told Emma you'd 
misplaced it. And then, after months, came the letter asking you to marry him, 
telling you he was coming to the village to get you. And the last letter that 
day. You read it in the grape arbor and came running in to tell Dorothy.

SOUND: DOOR CLOSES ... CONSTANCE'S HURRIED FOOTSTEPS IN

CONSTANCE: (APPROACHES, EXCITED) Dorothy! Dorothy!

EMMA: (DISAPPROVING, SHARPLY) Constance! Such noise!

CONSTANCE: (SURPRISED) Emma! Oh, I thought you'd gone down to the grocer's.

EMMA: And this is the way you behave behind my back? What do you have there, 
Constance; a letter?

CONSTANCE: Why-- Oh, yes.

EMMA: Oh? Well, I suppose it's from Aunt Sarah. Come in and read it to me.

CONSTANCE: (BEAT) I can't, Emma.

EMMA: What do you mean, you can't?

CONSTANCE: It's personal.

EMMA: Personal? Do you know what you're saying? We have no secrets from one 
another. We never have. I always read you <u>my</u> letters.

CONSTANCE: But this is personal. I can't read it to you.

EMMA: Constance, you're acting very strangely. Let me see that letter.

CONSTANCE: No! No!

EMMA: You're hiding something from me. (WITH EFFORT) Let me see it.

CONSTANCE: (IN PAIN) Don't--! You're hurting my arm!

EMMA: (BEAT, EXHALES; SUDDENLY ACTS WOUNDED, BUT CLEARLY MANIPULATIVE; SLOWLY) 
Constance-- Baby-- What have I done that you should treat me this way? Haven't 
I always thought of you -- always -- before myself? And now you tell me you 
have something private and personal. Between <u>us</u>.

CONSTANCE: Oh, I'm sorry, Emma. I didn't mean to hurt you, really. But-- Well, 
I suppose I might as well tell you now; you'll know soon enough. He's coming 
here tonight.

EMMA: He? What are you talking about, Constance?

CONSTANCE: Julian -- my friend. This is his letter telling me he will be here 
tonight.

EMMA: You've written to a strange man behind my back?

CONSTANCE: Nothing wrong with it. We've just exchanged letters. Such nice 
letters! He's told me such wonderful, interesting things about life in the 
city--

EMMA: Constance, how could you do anything so sinful?

CONSTANCE: Please try to understand, Emma. Perhaps you're satisfied to stay 
here in this old house all your life, but I'm young and I have a right to some 
happiness! I want to get out! To live!

EMMA: So -- this creature wants to take you away. After all I've done for you! 
Grown old caring for you, giving up everything for you!

CONSTANCE: No, Emma, you've given up nothing. Everything is just the way you 
want it. You keep saying that you've taken care of me for Mama, but you're 
not. You're keeping me tied here, trying to make me give up everything for 
you. And I can't do it! Not any longer, Emma! If Julian will take me, I will 
go away with him! I will marry him!

EMMA: Who is this man? How did you meet him?

CONSTANCE: He's Dorothy's cousin. She told him to write.

EMMA: (WITH DISGUST) The relative of our servant!

CONSTANCE: You said yourself she came from a good family. He - he's just as 
good as anybody. (INSISTS) He's wonderful!

EMMA: What do you know about him?

CONSTANCE: Everything! He's been writing regularly for six months. He's told 
me everything!

EMMA: You fool. You fool! Why do you suppose a man like that would want to 
marry a country girl, thirty-five, like you? Don't you see he's after your 
money? Dorothy's told him that you have money Mama left you. That's all he's 
after.

CONSTANCE: That's not true!

EMMA: Oh, isn't it? Well, you'll never get the chance to find out because 
you'll <u>not</u> go off with him!

CONSTANCE: I'm through obeying you, Emma. I shall go with Julian -- tonight.

EMMA: (BEAT) We'll see about that, Constance. We'll see!

MUSIC: CURTAIN

ANNOUNCER: You're listening to THE WHISTLER, brought to you by your friend, 
the Signal Oil Company, marketers of famous Signal Gasoline, your best buy 
today. Remember to let every "Go" signal remind you, you <u>do</u> go farther with 
Signal Gasoline.

MUSIC: WHISTLER THEME ... THEN BEHIND WHISTLER--

WHISTLER: Well, Constance, the time has come at last. Julian will be here soon 
and you've told Emma that you're leaving. Can she stop you? Can she carry out 
her threat to keep you here? Perhaps the only answer to that is Julian. And, 
at last, after dinner, he's here.

DOROTHY: Here is Julian, Miss Constance.

JULIAN: (APPROACHES, WARMLY) Constance!

CONSTANCE: (RELIEVED) Oh! Julian! (SHYLY) Come in. Do come in.

SOUND: JULIAN'S FOOTSTEPS BEHIND--

JULIAN: Constance! So at last we meet -- face to face.

CONSTANCE: Yes. I hope it's not a disappointment.

JULIAN: Disappointment? Anything but that. You're just as I expected you to 
be. And what about me?

CONSTANCE: (LOVINGLY) Oh, yes. You're just as I expected you'd be.

JULIAN: But I interrupted something. You were tending the fire?

CONSTANCE: No, I-- I - I was burning your letters.

JULIAN: Then you've regretted your decision, Constance?

CONSTANCE: No, Julian.

JULIAN: Then why?

CONSTANCE: I warned you. It's Emma. She wants to stop us. She's upstairs 
hunting for these letters now.

JULIAN: We shall leave anyway. She can't stop us.

CONSTANCE: But she'll do everything she can. She'll stop at nothing. Some 
fiendish power I don't understand impels her.

EMMA: (APPROACHES) Yes, Constance, go on.

CONSTANCE: (WHISPERS, NERVOUS) Julian!

JULIAN: (SLOWLY, IMPOSINGLY) You are Emma?

EMMA: I am Constance's sister.

JULIAN: (FIRMLY) Constance, if you haven't already done so, go pack your bags.

CONSTANCE: (LOW) I haven't packed. She would have seen and asked questions. 
I'll - I'll hurry.

SOUND: CONSTANCE'S HURRIED FOOTSTEPS START OFF

EMMA: (STERNLY) Come back here, Constance!

SOUND: CONSTANCE'S FOOTSTEPS STOP AND RETURN SLOWLY

CONSTANCE: (APPROACHES) What do you want? What?

EMMA: (REASONABLY) I want to talk to you once more. You must listen to me. 
This man does not love you, I know. Don't be a fool. Don't risk everything on 
this sudden wild impulse. Think of me. How lonely I'll be. This man wants your 
money. And what do you think he'll do with you when he finds you have none?

CONSTANCE: But I do, Emma. Half of what Mama and Papa left is mine.

EMMA: Yes, but I have control of it. You don't even know where it's kept. Did 
you think I would just give it to you?

CONSTANCE: I don't care about the money and neither does Julian. (MOVING OFF) 
I'm going to pack; I won't be long.

SOUND: CONSTANCE'S HURRIED FOOTSTEPS AWAY

EMMA: You'll only have to unpack, Constance.

JULIAN: Constance and I are to be married, Miss Emma, with or without sisterly 
approval.

EMMA: I understand that to be your intention.

JULIAN: Surely you can have no objections. She's not a child. She's thirty.

EMMA: Thirty-five.

JULIAN: Thirty-<u>five</u>?

EMMA: Yes. Constance has never been very practical or serious-minded. When 
Mama and Papa were killed in a train wreck many years ago, I realized 
Constance was in my charge; that it was my duty to shield her from the ills of 
the world.

JULIAN: I believe I understood you to say Miss Constance has no control over 
her money.

EMMA: You understood correctly.

JULIAN: Well-- (EXHALES) I'm not poor. Oh, far from it. But of late I've 
suffered some reverses and--

EMMA: Constance will have no money. Unless I give it to her.

JULIAN: (BEAT, TURNS ON THE CHARM; SLOWLY) Do you know? I admire a woman like 
you. I admire your strength. Your practicality.

EMMA: (SKEPTICAL) Really?

JULIAN: And now, Miss Emma, that I've come face to face with you and your 
sister, it seems to me --- that you're strikingly the more admirable of the 
two.

EMMA: Just what are you implying?

JULIAN: That perhaps I was being too hasty. Perhaps if I were to think this 
over-- You know, Miss Emma, you, too, have a right to a man's protection. And 
a man's love.

EMMA: (DISGUSTED, QUIETLY) You filthy beast. I've never asked for a man's love 
or a man's protection and I never shall. I shall have to advise Constance of 
this interesting deviation in character and this sudden change of affection. 
And, as for you, leave this house.

JULIAN: I <u>shall</u> leave. But Constance comes with me. Now, understand, I have 
not the slightest interest in your sister -- especially now. But just because 
you're so dead set on keeping her here with you, I'm going to take her with 
me. Course, I may drop her like a hot penny in a few weeks, but-- (BEAT, 
STARTLED, FLUSTERED) Why-- Why, Constance-- Pigeon-- (DESPERATELY) Whatever 
you heard, don't you believe a word of it. 

SOUND: JULIAN'S SLOW FOOTSTEPS TO CONSTANCE BEHIND--

JULIAN: (FEIGNED LIGHTNESS) I - I was just teasing your sister here, the old 
pill. I-- Why, I'm crazy about you, girl; you know that.

CONSTANCE: (QUIETLY FURIOUS) Don't you come near. Don't you <u>dare</u>.

JULIAN: Why, Constance-- After all the sweet endearing things you said in your 
letters--

CONSTANCE: (EXPLODES) Get out of this house!

JULIAN: (DROPS THE ACT) Say, who do you think you're talking to in that tone 
of voice?

CONSTANCE: You'd better leave.

JULIAN: (CHARMING) No. No, I think I'll stay and sit a spell. Who's to know 
there's a gentleman paying a call way out here on the edge of town? (OMINOUS) 
Who's to know <u>what's</u> going on out here?

CONSTANCE: Julian, I packed more than clothes in these grips.

SOUND: SUITCASE UNLATCHED AND OPENED

CONSTANCE: As you can see. You are not staying in this house!

JULIAN: (NERVOUS) Hey-- Hey, lady-- Put - put down that revolver. Firearms are 
dangerous things to be handling, especially for a woman. It - it might go off.

CONSTANCE: (COOLLY) You're right!

EMMA: (SLIGHTLY OFF, SCARED) Constance, be careful!

JULIAN: Well, turn it in some other direction then.

CONSTANCE: I like the way it's facing!

JULIAN: (DESPERATELY) Look-- Now, ladies, I was only <u>fooling</u>. Just - trying to 
give you a bit of sport, that's all. To liven up a dull winter evening, that's 
all.

CONSTANCE: Good night!

JULIAN: (EXHALES, GIVES UP, TO HIMSELF) I never saw such people. Talk about 
your New England hospitality. Must've been invented by someone who was never 
<u>in</u> New England.

SOUND: JULIAN'S FOOTSTEPS WALK TO DOOR BEHIND--

JULIAN: (MOVING OFF) Well, good night, ladies. It's been downright charming.

SOUND: FRONT DOOR OPENS ... JULIAN EXITS ... DOOR CLOSES

EMMA: (RELIEVED, DEEPLY IMPRESSED) Oh, Constance! Constance, you were 
wonderful! I never thought you could be so brave, standing right up to that 
big bully. Oh, that was so clever of you, bringing down Papa's old revolver. 
And so brave! How could you do it?

CONSTANCE: (WEAKLY) Oh, my heart.

EMMA: (SOLICITOUS) Constance, sit down, dear. Please do.

CONSTANCE: (SIGHS AS SHE SINKS INTO CHAIR)

EMMA: There. Oh, if anything should happen to you, I don't know what I'd do.

CONSTANCE: (EXHALES, STILL WEAK) I'm all right. (BEAT) Emma?

EMMA: Yes, dear?

CONSTANCE: (SLOWLY) Emma, why won't you allow me to have my own banking 
account? I promise you I won't be extravagant. It's just that I would feel 
more of an adult -- a person in my own right -- if I knew I could have access 
to my money, if I did want it.

EMMA: Constance, you were so brave and so forceful. Of <u>course</u> I shall see that 
you have access to your own money. You saved my life.

CONSTANCE: Then you <u>will</u> let me have - my own account?

EMMA: (LEVELS WITH HER) The money isn't in the bank, Constance.

CONSTANCE: It's not?

EMMA: No. It's right here. Right in the house. I wouldn't trust the bank; 
there might be a run on it someday.

CONSTANCE: (ASTONISHED) Julian might have searched the house -- taken it all.

EMMA: I know. I was frightened to death. Your facing him with the revolver was 
the only thing that saved us. But I have the money well-hidden. In a safe, 
behind this picture of dear Mama. And only I know the combination.

CONSTANCE: I never knew there was a safe there.

EMMA: Come, I'll show you.

MUSIC: BRIDGE ... THEN BEHIND WHISTLER--

WHISTLER: Emma, relieved of her fright, is more human than you've ever seen 
her, isn't she, Constance? She seems really happy as she goes to the safe and 
opens it.

SOUND: FOOTSTEPS TO SAFE DOOR WHICH SQUEAKS OPEN

EMMA: There it is. All there.

CONSTANCE: (BIG INHALE, IN AWE) 

EMMA: You didn't know we were so wealthy, did you, little sister?

CONSTANCE: How much is it, Emma?

EMMA: At my last count, it was a little over two hundred and fifty thousand 
dollars, including the bonds. Mama was so wise. She made Papa invest in only 
the safest things. So you see, dear--

SOUND: JULIAN'S FOOTSTEPS APPROACH BEHIND--

JULIAN: (APPROACHES) All right, ladies, if you'll just hand over the contents 
of that safe.

EMMA: You! Julian!

JULIAN: I availed myself of your servants' entrance, Miss Emma. Informal, but 
practical.

EMMA: Constance, the revolver there on the floor! Get the revolver!

SOUND: IN AGREEMENT WITH FOLLOWING, JULIAN'S STEPS, LUNGING FOR AND PICKING UP 
THE REVOLVER

JULIAN: (WITH EFFORT) I - have the revolver now. (COOLLY TRIUMPHANT) Now it is 
<u>my</u> turn to give directions. Back against the wall and let's not have a sound 
from you. Don't know who'd hear you way out here if you <u>did</u> yell.

EMMA: (DESPERATELY) Constance, do something. Don't let him take our money. 
What'll happen to us? That's our security! Our future, our happiness!

CONSTANCE: <u>My</u> security! <u>My</u> future and happiness, Emma. Don't worry, he's only 
taking <u>my</u> half.

EMMA: What do you mean?

CONSTANCE: Julian and I planned the whole thing. Only, we didn't know it was 
going to be this easy. I thought I had to draw the money out of the bank. It's 
much simpler this way.

EMMA: What are you saying, Constance? You can't know what you're saying.

CONSTANCE: Oh, yes, I <u>do</u> know! I thought it would take a fright to make you 
part with my money. Well, I wrote Julian it would be a battle and he suggested 
this little plot. You were happy, weren't you, Emma, when you thought Julian a 
thief and a raffer. You were gloating inside because you thought everything 
<u>you</u> had said was true!

EMMA: Constance, you must be out of your mind.

CONSTANCE: Julian and I are going to travel all over the world! I'm going to 
<u>live</u> at last! I'm going to see things!

EMMA: The Lord'll punish you, Constance.

CONSTANCE: Oh, I've had my share of punishment, Emma. All the long, <u>rotten</u> 
years I've had to spend with you!

JULIAN: (SMOOTHLY) I have your grips and the money, Constance. Shall we leave?

CONSTANCE: Yes! Yes, Julian.

JULIAN: Goodbye again, Miss Emma.

SOUND: JULIAN'S FOOTSTEPS AWAY BEHIND--

EMMA: (WITH DISGUST) You vile, unspeakable man. (TO CONSTANCE) You vile, 
unspeakable woman! (DELIBERATELY) Oh, you'll be sorry, Constance. You'll 
regret this to the end of your days. I shall hate you. Hate you forever and 
ever. My hate will reach out for you wherever you are; you'll never be happy!

CONSTANCE: Goodbye, Emma.

SOUND: CONSTANCE'S HURRIED FOOTSTEPS TO DOOR

EMMA: Constance!

SOUND: CONSTANCE EXITS ... DOOR SLAMS SHUT

EMMA: (BROKENLY) Constance, how could you?

DOROTHY: (BEAT, OFF) Miss Emma? Have they gone?

SOUND: DOROTHY'S STEPS APPROACH BEHIND--

EMMA: You! You're the cause of this! After I gave you a home, a job, 
companionship; you did this to me! I could kill you!

DOROTHY: No. No, Miss Emma. Calm yourself.

EMMA: You took her away from me. You're responsible for me being left alone to 
live out a miserable lonely old age!

DOROTHY: No. Stop looking at me like that. She'll be back.

EMMA: Back? She'll never-- (DOUBLE TAKE) What did you say?

DOROTHY: (REALIZES SHE'S SAID TOO MUCH) I - I--

EMMA: Why are you so sure she'll be back? You know something more about this, 
don't you?

DOROTHY: (LYING) Why-- No, Miss Emma. No.

EMMA: You do! What do you know, Dorothy? Why should Constance come back if 
she's got the money?

DOROTHY: I don't know. Only, you said yourself that he might take the money 
from her.

EMMA: But he's your cousin, Dorothy. You must know him well. Therefore you 
must know he <u>is</u> going to take the money and leave her penniless, to come 
shrinking back to me. Don't you, Dorothy? (NO ANSWER) Don't you?!

DOROTHY: All right. Yes, I do. We planned it that way. And I'm not sorry. It's 
what the two of you deserve. What good was it doing you? Either of you? It'll 
help Julian and me to really live again. 

EMMA: So you're going to get part of it, too?

DOROTHY: Yes. Yes. And it's only what I deserve after what I've put up with 
from you. And there's nothing you can do about it now. They're already on 
their way to the city -- to be married.

EMMA: (DURING ABOVE, STARTS LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY)

DOROTHY: (PUZZLED) What--? What are you laughing at?

EMMA: (HYSTERICAL) You! You, Dorothy. You think I'm angry at you! You think I 
want to stop you! Nooo! Take the money; I'm glad, do you hear? Take it! You're 
welcome to it! Because now Constance will be back. She'll be penniless. Take 
the money! I'll have Constance back! (LAUGHS) I'll have Constance back! 
(LAUGHS)

MUSIC: CURTAIN

ANNOUNCER: But that's not all of this strange story. In a moment, the Whistler 
will be back to tell you what <u>really</u> happened. 

And while we're waiting, here's the modern version of that old story about the 
lost horseshoe nail. Just one nail. But, for lack of it, the shoe was lost, 
then the horse, the rider -- and, as a result, the battle was lost. Well, this 
year, Uncle Sam says one out of every twelve cars will be lost; that is, go 
off the road. Many of them because just one vital part has worn out, which 
can't be replaced today. That's why your Signal dealer takes no chances of 
missing even one part when he lubricates your car. It's why he uses the famous 
Signal Safety Chart, on which the maker of your particular car has indicated 
every lubrication point and the exact oil or grease it should have. Before 
your Signal dealer returns your car to you, he checks every point against the 
safety chart -- not just once, but twice. This double protection is Signal's 
way of assuring you that your car won't be the one one-in-twelve that goes off 
the road because some vital part wore out from lack of lubrication. So if it's 
been a thousand miles or two months since last lubrication, play safe. See 
your neighborhood Signal dealer for a Signal Safety Chart lubrication.

And now, back to THE WHISTLER.

MUSIC: TAG ... THEN BEHIND WHISTLER--

WHISTLER: Yes, Emma sat in the lonely old house and waited, nursing her 
bitterness, and down in the city at a small hotel, Julian stood at the desk, 
waiting for his bride and -- her money. Constance was upstairs dressing for 
the wedding. It was scheduled to take place at the little church just around 
the corner within the hour. As the minutes went by and the time grew short, 
Julian became impatient. He went upstairs to the room looking for Constance. 
She wasn't there. On the table he found a note.

JULIAN: (READS, SLOWLY, UNHAPPILY) Dear Julian, I'm sorry to disappoint you, 
but, you see, I knew all along what you really wanted from me. I suppose it 
was deceitful to let you believe you were succeeding, but I needed your help 
to gain my freedom. Now that I have it -- and the money -- I thank you and 
wish you good luck. Goodbye, Constance.

WHISTLER: Julian knew what that meant. And, after a time, so did Emma, sitting 
alone in the old house on the hill.

MUSIC: TWO DRUMBEATS FOR PUNCTUATION ... THEN WHISTLER THEME ... THEN IN BG, 
UNTIL END
