[Editor's Note: This is transcript of a radio broadcast presented from the 
Finnish-Russian war front Christmas, 1939, by W.L. White of Emporia, Kansas, 
of CBS Radio, "The Day in Europe" at 6:34 p.m. EST.]

W.L. White speaking to you on this Christmas night from Finland, the country 
where our legend of Santa Claus and his reindeer first began. Reindeer still 
pull sleighs in the north of Finland tonight, carrying supplies to the little 
nation's army which is fighting to press back the great army which would come 
in. But if part of our Christmas story began in Finland, this is also the 
country where Christmas ends, for beyond the line of its armies lies that 
great land where there is no Christmas any more, and where the memory of its 
stories is dimming fast. And this is why, since I have come from a front line 
post-of-command of this Finnish army, I can tell you tonight about the last 
Christmas tree. And although you have many finer ones in America tonight, tall 
trees gay with tinsel, proud with sparkling colored balls, and rich with 
presents underneath wrapped in pretty papers and tied with silver cords, I 
think you would like these even better when you know about that brave and sad 
last little Christmas tree at the very edge of the land where Christmas ends.

Even without our guide we might have found the last Christmas tree by 
following the sound of big guns from far off. Presently when they were close, 
we left our cars and followed a trail in the deep snow which wound toward the 
guns through a tall spruce forest, the snow on their branches glistening in 
the moonlight. The trail led past the second line dugouts on through the woods 
toward the guns, and sometimes we stepped aside to let pass a horse drawn 
sleigh, fitted to carry warm boilers of steaming hot soup up to the men ahead. 
We were told to walk quietly now. Talking in whispers, we passed places where 
the white snow had been gashed deep by shell craters, and at last we came to 
the front line post-of-command. The officer here greeted us in a tired voice 
saying we should go no further, as this forest had only yesterday been retaken 
from the Russians whose lines were a few hundreds yards ahead, and his men had 
not had time to dig safe trenches. Beyond us was no real front line but only 
machine gun nests, dugouts and a few shallow trenches, a place where it was 
not safe for any man to crawl who had not first seen the country by clear light 
of day. But perhaps we would like to go down into his front line command post 
dugout, talk to his men and see their Christmas tree.

The dugout was deep beneath snow and earth, and warmed from the zero weather 
by a tiny stove. Tired men were lying on the straw-strewn floor and when they 
rose to greet us we could see by the light of the shaded lantern that their 
faces were weary and unshaven. The officer explained for this, saying fighting 
had been very hard, the enemy had greatly outnumbered them, so when there was 
no fighting there was time for little but sleep.

We asked him what the men would have for Christmas dinner and he told us their 
mess kits would be filled with thick warm pea soup, rich with pieces of mutton 
and pork, with plenty of bread spread thick with butter and for dessert, 
porridge with sugar. And then, because it was Christmas, the army had sent up 
four Christmas hams, which would be sliced and eaten with the bread.

He said we should remember that several sledges had come laden with Christmas 
presents for the men — warm sweaters and socks knitted by their wives, or 
Christmas cookies and tarts baked by them, and there would be something for 
each man.

We asked when the men up ahead in the last machine gun posts and dugouts would 
get their presents and he said not until tomorrow, but they would not mind, 
because each man knew why he must be there, and what must be done and not one 
would wish himself in any other place and because the people of this country 
love Christmas so much, each one could carry it [in] his heart.

Then we asked if, at our own risk, we might not crawl up and give them some of 
the cigarets and sweets and tobacco we had brought. He shook his head saying if 
we made a noise and attracted Russian artillery there might be losses among his 
men, and this was not good to happen on Christmas night.

But tomorrow those men would get their presents in this dugout and also the 
Christmas tree would be saved for them to see. The tiny tree was standing near 
the stove. Little red and white wax candles had been tied by men's clumsy 
fingers to its branches. The officer said the candles could not be lit, because 
this might be seen by bombers through the dugout's canvas roof. Also tied to the 
green spruce twigs were a few gum drops — the kind you buy twisted in colored 
wax papers. At the very top was tied not a sparkling glass star but a cheap 
cardboard image of Santa Claus, and this was all. No strips of tinsel, no shining 
balls, no winking electric lights —. You can be very glad that the Christmas tree 
in your home tonight is so much finer.

We asked the officer who sent these ornaments and he smiled kindly and said that 
they came from a very small girl whose father was out on the last line tonight, 
and with them a note from her mother explaining that the child was very young, 
and could not understand why he could not come back to them even on Christmas and 
had cried bitterly until they let her send these little things so that at least 
he could have his own Christmas tree. So the tree would be kept as it was in the 
dugout until he came back from his outpost tomorrow.

So when you take your last look at your own fine tree tonight before turning out 
its lights, I think you will like it even better since you know about the last 
sad little Christmas tree of all, which could not even have its poor candles lit 
because it faces the land where there is no Christmas — Returning you now to 
Columbia in New York.



[Editor's Note: Robert Sherwood, the New York playwright, fumbling at the radio 
dial Christmas evening, ran into this broadcast. He was deeply stirred by it. He 
wrote to friends the next day that he was moved by the broadcast to write a play 
about the menace to democracy. He began work on it the first week of the new 
year. The play was presented in New York April 22, 1940. It is entitled "There 
Shall Be No Night." It was an immediate success. Mr. Sherwood invited Mrs. W.L. 
White and Mr. and Mrs. W.A. White to the opening performance and the night that 
W.L. White landed in New York from Europe May 13, he and Mrs. White were Mr. 
Sherwood's guests at the theater.]
