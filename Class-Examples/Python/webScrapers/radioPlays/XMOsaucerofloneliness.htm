SOUND: HIGH-PITCHED ELECTRONIC HUM ... JOINED BY ELECTRONIC BEEPING IN 
AGREEMENT WITH COUNTDOWN

ANNOUNCER: Countdown for blast-off. X minus five, four, three, two. X minus 
one. Fire.

SOUND: A MOMENT'S SILENCE ... THEN ROCKET SHIP BLASTS OFF

MUSIC: BUILDS VERTIGINOUSLY TO A CLIMAX ... THEN IN BG

ANNOUNCER: From the far horizons of the unknown come tales of new dimensions 
in time and space. These are stories of the future, adventures in which you'll 
live in a million could-be years on a thousand may-be worlds. The National 
Broadcasting Company, in cooperation with Galaxy Science Fiction Magazine, 
presents -- (HEAVY ECHO) X Minus One!

MUSIC: TO A CLIMAX ... THEN OUT

ANNOUNCER: Tonight: the time is June twenty-fifth, Nineteen Sixty-Two. The 
place: a lonely beach. The story: "Saucer of Loneliness" by Theodore Sturgeon.

MUSIC: ROMANTIC INTRODUCTION ... THEN BEHIND JASON--

JASON: (NARRATES) My name is Jason Beniades. I'm a newspaper reporter, thirty-
one years old. I write poetry, but I don't show it to anybody because they 
might laugh, and the things I write about are very important to me. I was an 
only child. I never went with girls much, because I'm too ugly and too 
sensitive, and they used to hurt me. I live alone; it isn't much fun. I'm not 
painting this picture of myself to get sympathy; I don't need it. But it's 
important that you should know the kind of person I am, otherwise you won't 
understand what I'm going to tell you. (BEAT) It happened tonight -- the thing 
I'm going to tell you about. Tonight. The twenty-fifth of June, Nineteen 
Sixty-Two. I was down on the beach. 

SOUND: BEACH BACKGROUND ... CRASH OF WAVES, SHRIEK OF SEAGULLS, ET CETERA

BOY: (OFF, URGENT) Hey! Mister! 

SOUND: BOY'S RUNNING STEPS APPROACH

BOY: (CLOSER) Hey, mister! 

JASON: What is it, kid? 

BOY: Have you seen a cop around anyplace? 

JASON: On this beach? 

BOY: I found this pile of clothes down near the rocks -- a lady's dress and 
shoes. 

JASON: Well, did you see anybody? A girl?

BOY: Well, I think so, but she was runnin' along the sand in the moonlight. I 
yelled to her, but she just kept runnin', and then I found these.

JASON: Look, kid, you go try to find a cop someplace. I'll see if I can find 
the girl. 

BOY: Okay. 

MUSIC: TRANSITION ... THEN BEHIND JASON--

JASON: (NARRATES) I thought to myself, she's dead. I'll never find her now in 
this white flood of moonlight with the surf seething in over the pale sand. I 
ran and ran until my knees buckled and went down in the swirl of it -- the sea 
on my lips, with the taste of tears, and the whole white night shouted and 
wept. And then I saw her -- waist deep walking into the surf.

SOUND: BEACH BACKGROUND ... LOUD CRASH OF WAVES, IN CLOSE

JASON: Stop! Stop it! Come back! Come on, come out. 

JANET: (HYSTERICAL) Let go. Let me go!

JASON: (WITH EFFORT) Don't do it, please don't. 

JANET: Leave me alone. Leave me alone! (WEEPS, IN BG)

JASON: I'm going to have to hit you. Forgive me. 

SOUND: HE HITS HER HARD

JANET: (WEEPING STOPS ABRUPTLY AS SHE'S KNOCKED OUT)

MUSIC: TRANSITION ... THEN BEHIND JASON--

JASON: (NARRATES) I hit her in the neck with the edge of my hand and she 
slumped. I brought her ashore and carried her to where a dune was between us 
and the water, then I rubbed her wrists. She had a pale beautiful face, with 
ancient, bottomless blue eyes. She opened them and looked at me after a 
moment.

SOUND: BEACH BACKGROUND ... QUIET CRASH OF WAVES, SLIGHTLY OFF ... SEAGULLS, 
ET CETERA

JASON: It's all right. Here, put my coat over you. 

JANET: (QUIET, WEARY) Why couldn't you leave me alone? 

JASON: I couldn't. 

JANET: Why? 

JASON: Because it's important to me. 

JANET: I suppose you want to know why I did it. 

JASON: (BEAT) If I told you I understand, would you believe me?

JANET: (BEAT, QUIET SCORN) How could you understand?

JASON: Maybe I know what it means to be lonely. 

JANET: (EXHALES, CONSIDERS) That. 

JASON: That's it, isn't it? 

JANET: (HOPELESSLY) I don't know. I'm so terribly tired. 

JASON: Put your head against my arm, and just stay. 

JANET: (STARTS TO PROTEST) I-- 

JASON: (INTERRUPTS) Don't be afraid. (BEAT, SIMPLY) I've been looking for you 
for a long time. 

JANET: Looking - for me? 

JASON: All my life.

JANET: (PUZZLED, SKEPTICAL) How did you know? I don't believe you. 

JASON: It's true. I found your message.

JANET: Oh?

JASON: So, you see, there's nothing to be afraid of. Not any more. Just rest. 
(BEAT) The moonlight is terribly white. 

JANET: (WEARY) Yes. I'd like to rest - for a while.

MUSIC: TRANSITION ... THEN BEHIND JASON--

JASON: (NARRATES) She didn't remember it, of course, but I was one of the 
reporters who had covered the story when it first happened -- five years ago. 

MUSIC: HARP GLISSANDOS ... TRANSITION FOR A FLASHBACK ... THEN BEHIND JASON--

JASON: (NARRATES) I'll never forget that day. I was working the police 
blotter. It was a quiet summer afternoon when they brought her in -- two big 
cops in blue uniforms.

SOUND: POLICE STATION BACKGROUND

OFFICER: Come on now, girlie, come on.

JANET: Let me go. I haven't done anything!

OFFICER: Ah, take it easy now. 

SERGEANT: What's the trouble, Connolly? 

OFFICER: Disturbin' the peace, sergeant. 

SERGEANT: Is this that Central Park call?
 
OFFICER: Right, this is it. 

SERGEANT: I thought you radioed that there was a near-riot up there.

OFFICER: Ah, you should have seen the place. 

SERGEANT: All right, give me the report. 

OFFICER: Well, me and Bennett got up there, and there was a mob of people all 
surroundin' this girl, see? So we bust through, and there, in the middle of 
maybe six hundred people, she's lyin' there, sort of in a faint. I asked a 
couple of people what the difficulty was, and they tell me it's the flyin' 
saucer. 

SERGEANT: The what? 

OFFICER: The flyin' saucer. 

SERGEANT: <u>What</u> flyin' saucer? 

OFFICER: Let me finish, sergeant. "<u>What</u> flyin' saucer?" I ask, and then they 
says that this girl was standin' on the green and suddenly this saucer comes 
down and starts whirlin' over her head, like a halo. 

SERGEANT: (TO JANET) What is this, miss? A gag? 

JANET: (QUIETLY) It happened.

SERGEANT: It did, eh? Well, now suppose you tell me your version. 

JANET: (SIMPLY) I was standing in the park, and I looked up, and there it was.

SERGEANT: Describe it.

JANET: (EXHALES, WARMLY, STILL A LITTLE AWED) It was beautiful. It was golden 
with a dusty finish, like - like an unripe Concord grape. It made a faint 
sound -- a chord of two tones -- and it circled over my head like some great 
round hummingbird.

SERGEANT: Go on.

JANET: Well, other people must have seen it, because they were all looking at 
me and pointing. I saw one man cross himself. And then it came down and - and 
touched me. And spoke to me. 

SERGEANT: (TAKEN ABACK) The-- This flying saucer spoke to you?

JANET: Yes.

SERGEANT: (CLEARS THROAT UNCOMFORTABLY) And, er-- Just what did it say to you? 
(NO ANSWER) I said, what did it say? 

JANET: (BEAT) I can't tell you. 

SERGEANT: A secret, eh? 

JANET: Yes. 

SERGEANT: I see. (TO OFFICER) Connolly, this girl is for Bellevue. 

OFFICER: (DELICATELY) Well - well, sergeant, the plain fact is that it - it 
happened just like that! Ten witnesses all agree it did. 

SERGEANT: Are you trying to tell me that there <u>was</u> such a thing as this 
whirrin' hummin'-bird of a saucer? 

OFFICER: Oh, there <u>was</u> that, sergeant. 

SERGEANT: And just how do <u>you</u> know, Connolly? 

OFFICER: Well, we've got the thing out in the squad car. 

SERGEANT: You what?! 

OFFICER: Bennett's bringin' it in right now, see? About thirty-six inches 
across it is, and covered with strange markings.

SERGEANT: Great mother! Did you call the bomb squad?! 

OFFICER: I - I didn't think of it.

SERGEANT: Well, think of it, man! This may be some kind of atomic weapon! 

OFFICER: I'll turn it over to ballistics.

SERGEANT: Never mind about ballistics. Call the FBI and tell 'em we've got 
this thing.

OFFICER: Er, yes, sir. What about the girl? 

SERGEANT: We'll book her on disturbin' the peace. I've got a feelin' the 
government men may want a word with her.

JASON: Sergeant--? 

SERGEANT: Er, what is it, Beniades? 

JASON: I'd like to do a story on this for my paper. Could I have a look at the 
saucer? 

SERGEANT: (UNCERTAIN) Er-- We'd better clear it first. 

JASON: Well, could I talk to the girl? 

SERGEANT: <u>After</u> she's been booked.

JASON: Connolly, is the crowd still up at the park? 

OFFICER: Ah, very likely. 

JASON: Well, I'll run up there and get some eyewitnesses. Then I'd like to 
come back and talk to the girl.

MUSIC: BRISK TRANSITION ... THEN BEHIND JASON--

JASON: (NARRATES) Up at the park they were still buzzing about it. Some said 
she was a Communist agitator. Some said it was a flying saucer from Mars and 
she had stepped out of it. Others said she was a saint and it was her halo. I 
took some notes, phoned the paper, and went back downtown to talk to her. But 
there were a couple of agents with her and they wouldn't let me in. 

SOUND: A SMALL CROWD MURMURS ... A ROOMFUL OF POLICE, SOLDIERS, AND FEDERAL 
AGENTS ... THEN IN BG

AGENT: Now then, miss, you told the sergeant this saucer spoke to you. Is that 
correct? 

JANET: Yes.

AGENT: Did it speak to you in English? 

JANET: I don't know.

AGENT: You <u>did</u> understand it, though? 

JANET: Yes. 

AGENT: Do you speak any other languages? 

JANET: No. 

AGENT: Tell me, what message did you receive from this instrument? 

JANET: It wasn't anything, really. 

AGENT: Suppose you tell me. 

JANET: I'd rather not. 

AGENT: (BEAT) Miss, let me be very frank. I'm not a policeman; I'm a security 
agent. That means that I deal with problems that affect the security of our 
country. Do you understand? 

JANET: Yes.

AGENT: Now, we've examined this flying saucer enough to know that it is not of 
American manufacture. It also possesses an extremely high radioactive count. 
Now, that means that it was made in an area where radioactive materials are in 
great abundance, such as an area where atom bombs are made. That's why we want 
to know the message you received from the saucer.

JANET: (UNCONVINCING) There was no message.

AGENT: (BEAT, SKEPTICAL) You just made it up? 

JANET: Yes. 

AGENT: I'm afraid you're lying. (BRISKLY) Suppose we have some soldiers bring 
the saucer in here and hold it over your head. Would you object? 

JANET: (A LITTLE DEFIANT) I don't care what you do.

AGENT: (CALLS) All right, boys, bring it in! 

SOUND: SOLDIERS GRUNT ... DOOR OPENS ... SOLDIERS' STEPS TO JANET

AGENT: Now, when I tell them to hold it over your head, you try to recall what 
it said.

JANET: (INSISTS) I don't know what it said.

AGENT: Lift it up, boys -- hold it right over her head.

SOUND: SOLDIERS GRUNT AND HOLD SAUCER UP ... SAUCER QUIETLY HUMS AND PULSES IN 
A WEIRD, OTHERWORLDLY FASHION ... CONTINUES IN BG

AGENT: It's talking to you now, isn't it? 

JANET: (RELUCTANTLY) Yes. 

AGENT: What is it saying? 

SOUND: JANET DOESN'T ANSWER ... THEN WEIRD HUM FADES OUT WITH A WHOOSH! AS THE 
SAUCER POWERS DOWN

AGENT: What did it say? (NO ANSWER ... SHARPLY, TO SOLDIERS) All right, boys 
-- crate it up and send it down to the National Research Laboratories. 

SOLDIER: Right.

SOUND: SAUCER CARRIED AWAY, IN BG

AIDE: What about the girl, sir? 

AGENT: We'll get nothing out of her. I don't believe she really knows what 
that humming noise is. Better have a psychiatrist examine her.

AIDE: Yes, sir. 

MUSIC: UNCERTAIN TRANSITION ... THEN BEHIND JASON--

JASON: (NARRATES) They took her to the city hospital and she had a room to 
herself. Whenever the door opened, she could see the policeman outside. The 
door opened quite often. There were a lot of important people, some in army 
uniforms, who came up from Washington just to see her and talk to her. 
Apparently they had analyzed the flying saucer and discovered something that 
made this girl about the most important person in the country. I used to stand 
outside and I could identify the heads of certain security agencies, but 
nobody would answer the questions that the reporters shot at them.

SOUND: HOSPITAL DOOR CLICKS ... CHIEF'S STEPS IN ... JASON'S STEPS JOIN 
CHIEF'S AS THEY BRISKLY WALK DOWN HALL, IN BG

JASON: Sir? Excuse me? 

CHIEF: Yes? 

JASON: I'm Jason Beniades from the Trib. I've been assigned to this flying 
saucer story. As chief of the security--

CHIEF: (INTERRUPTS) I'm sorry, I have no comment. 

JASON: Can you tell me how long the girl will be held? 

CHIEF: That's a matter for the civil authorities. 

JASON: Well, have the psychiatrists determined--?

CHIEF: (INTERRUPTS) Excuse me, Mr. Beniades, my car's waiting.

MUSIC: FOREBODING TRANSITION ... THEN BEHIND JASON--

JASON: (NARRATES) A few days later she was released from the hospital and 
returned to the court to be tried on the disorderly conduct charge. They found 
her guilty and fined her fifteen dollars, and turned her loose. When she 
walked out of the courtroom she was handed a subpoena to appear before a 
congressional committee in private session. She answered all their questions 
except one. My paper sent me over to cover the hearings.

SOUND: MURMUR OF CROWD ... GAVEL BANGS THRICE ... CROWD QUIETS ... (SLIGHT 
ECHO ON VOICES TO CONVEY LARGE COMMITTEE ROOM)

SENATOR: (VERY GRAVE) Now, young lady -- I want to remind you that I'm a 
senator of the United States and empowered by the people of this country to 
ask questions relating to matters of security. Do you understand? 

JANET: Yes. 

SENATOR: Your name is Janet Boyce, is it not? 

JANET: (CURT) I told you that.

SENATOR: Now, at an earlier session you testified that as a young girl you 
were a member of a certain organization in your neighborhood. Would you name 
it? 

JANET: (A LITTLE EMBARRASSED) The Rinkeydinks.

SENATOR: Who comprised the Rinkeydinks, Miss Boyce? 

JANET: It was just a bunch of girls who got together to play field hockey and 
listen to recordings.

SENATOR: Any particular recordings?

JANET: Mostly Eddie Fisher. 

SENATOR: I see. Now, this flying saucer-- You said it talked to you. You <u>did</u> 
say that, didn't you? 

JANET: (EXASPERATED) Yes.

SENATOR: And then you denied it. 

JANET: Yes. 

SENATOR: Why? 

JANET: Because I was tired of answering questions!

SENATOR: Young woman, let me put something to you squarely-- Oh, by the way, I 
think if there are members of the press here, I can divulge a rather 
spectacular piece of information to you.

SOUND: CROWD REACTS WITH QUIET EXPECTANCY

SENATOR: (CLEARS THROAT) This flying saucer has been thoroughly examined and 
analyzed, and I wish to inform the people of this great nation that it 
<u>definitely</u>-- I repeat, it definitely did <u>not</u> originate on this planet. 

SOUND: CROWD MURMURS IN REACTION ... GAVEL BANGS THRICE ... CROWD QUIETS

SENATOR: Now then-- Now then, Miss Boyce. Consider that it is possible that 
our Earth might be attacked from outer space by beings much stronger and 
cleverer than we are. And consider that perhaps you have the key to our 
defense against those beings. Don't you owe it to the world?

JANET: I don't think I owe anything to anybody. 

SENATOR: (INTENSELY) Even if the Earth was not attacked, just think what an 
advantage it would give this country over its enemies. Young woman, I ask you: 
what did that flying saucer say to you? (NO ANSWER, QUIETLY) Do you know that 
what you are doing is tantamount to working for the enemies of your country? 
(NO ANSWER) I will give you one more chance. What was the message?

JANET: It was personal!

SOUND: CROWD MURMURS IN REACTION ... GAVEL BANGS TWICE ... CROWD QUIETS

SENATOR: Gentlemen, I move that Miss Janet Boyce be cited for contempt. 

SOUND: CROWD REACTS

MUSIC: TRANSITION ... THEN BEHIND JASON--

JASON: (NARRATES) The furor was fantastic. The chief of security blasted the 
senator for divulging secret information about the origin of the flying 
saucer; and the senator said the people had a right to know, and besides, he 
was just guessing anyway -- and happened to guess right. (BEAT) Meanwhile, the 
press printed the girl's picture all over the front page and ran banner 
headlines such as "Girl refuses to betray Martian secrets," "Flying saucer 
girl won't talk; cited for contempt." The contempt trial was equally 
spectacular. She didn't plead any amendment or anything. She just said the 
saucer was talking to <u>her</u>, and it was nobody else's business. She was 
convicted, and sentenced to five years in prison. 

SOUND: PHONE RINGS, RECEIVER UP

JASON: (INTO PHONE) Beniades. -- Yes, chief? -- For the Sunday supplement? -- 
Well-- Well, do you think there's anything in it? -- Okay, whatever you say. 

SOUND: RECEIVER DOWN, THEN UP AGAIN ... PHONE DIALED

JASON: (INTO PHONE) Hello, Mike? Get me everything you can on that flying 
saucer girl, will you? -- Yeah, the one that was sent to jail about four years 
ago. -- See if you can find out what she's doing <u>now</u>. She was released about 
six months ago, I think. -- Uh-huh. -- Yeah. Yeah, the boss wants a feature 
for the Sunday supplement. -- Okay. 

MUSIC: TRANSITION ... THEN BEHIND JASON--

JASON: (NARRATES) I found out she had gotten a job cleaning at night -- in 
offices and stores down near the beachfront. There weren't many to clean, but 
that meant there weren't many people to remember her face from the newspapers. 
I tracked her down and caught up with her in a one-armed coffee joint about 
four in the morning.

SOUND: RATTLE OF SPOON IN COFFEE CUP

JASON: Excuse me, miss? Do you mind if I sit here? 

JANET: (GUARDED) No. 

SOUND: CHAIR SCRAPES AS JASON SITS

JASON: (BEAT) Nice night, isn't it? Moonlight and everything.

JANET: Which are you? Security, newspapers, or just somebody out for a good 
time? 

JASON: (BEAT) You're pretty bitter, aren't you? 

JANET: Shouldn't I be? 

JASON: (BEAT) Yeah, I guess you should. (BEAT) Er, my name is Jason Beniades. 
I'm with a newspaper.

JANET: Well, it's been nice meeting you. I have to go now. 

SOUND: HER CHAIR SCRAPES, BUT SHE DOES NOT RISE

JASON: Just a minute-- 

JANET: Please. 

JASON: I can't blame you.

JANET: How did you find me? 

JASON: One of the legmen located your mother. I talked to her earlier tonight. 

JANET: Oh. How is she? 

JASON: Still hitting the bottle. The way she knew where you were-- You sent 
her some flowers on her birthday, remember? 

JANET: (BITTERLY) Yes. She wouldn't talk to me. Said she didn't want a 
daughter who was a jailbird.

JASON: (BEAT) Tell me how it's been.

JANET: So you can write about it?

JASON: I promise you I won't write anything you don't want me to write.

JANET: Okay. You want to know how it's been? (BRISKLY) Right after I got out 
of jail I met a man at a restaurant. Nice man. He asked me for a date. I spent 
every cent I had on a red handbag to go with my red shoes. They - they weren't 
the same shade, but anyway they were both red. And I was very excited about 
the date. We went to a movie. Afterward, he didn't even try to kiss me or 
anything. He <u>just</u> wanted to know what the flying saucer had told me. (BEAT) 
Didn't say anything; I just went home and cried all night. 

JASON: And that was it? 

JANET: No. (ARCHLY) I had another date. I get pretty lonely. This time they 
arrested the man I was with. <u>He</u> was a Russian agent. (UPSET, QUICKLY) On 
Christmas Eve, four men called me up and sang me a song. Would you like to 
hear the words? 

JASON: (EMBARRASSED) Er, it doesn't matter.

JANET: (BARRELS ON) They go, "The flying saucer came down one day / and taught 
her a brand-new way to play / and what it was she will not say--" (STOPS, THEN 
SLOWLY, BROKENLY) "--but she takes me out of this world." 

JASON: (PAUSE) I'm sorry.

JANET: (BEAT, QUIETLY) Now will you go away and leave me alone? 

JASON: Yes. 

JANET: (BEAT) Aren't you going to ask me the big question? 

JASON: No.

JANET: Everybody does. 

JASON: Yeah, well, not me. 

JANET: You will -- sooner or later. 

JASON: Maybe. Look, er, can I take you home? 

JANET: No.

JASON: Can I see you again?

JANET: I-- 

JASON: Please.

JANET: (QUIETLY EMOTIONAL) I don't know. I'm afraid to let myself like anyone. 

JASON: (BEAT) Trust me. Will you? 

JANET: I - I'm not sure. 

JASON: Maybe? 

JANET: (VERY QUIET) Maybe.

JASON: I'll wait here for you tomorrow night. 

JANET: All right. 

MUSIC: TRANSITION ... THEN BEHIND JASON--

JASON: (NARRATES) The next night I went back to the coffee joint to wait for 
her. I knew she got through about four in the morning. I got there about 
fifteen minutes early. 

SOUND: RATTLE OF SPOON IN COFFEE CUP

CHIEF: Mr. Beniades? 

JASON: Yes? (BEAT, REALIZES) Say, you're the chief of the security section, 
aren't you? Mister--? 

CHIEF: You have a good memory. Do you mind if I sit down? 

SOUND: CHAIR SCRAPES AS CHIEF SITS

JASON: Oh, well, I'm expecting someone.

CHIEF: Yes, I know. 

JASON: Oh, I see. 

CHIEF: I'd like to talk to you.

JASON: Go ahead. 

CHIEF: You, ah-- You probably know that we've been trying to gain the 
confidence of this girl for some years now. 

JASON: Yes. 

CHIEF: And, er, apparently you've succeeded where we've failed.

JASON: Well, not really. 

CHIEF: In any event, you seem to be making some progress. 

JASON: She may not even show up.

CHIEF: I think she will. Now, I'm going to ask you to help us. 

JASON: Help? In what way can I help? 

CHIEF: We have reason to believe that this girl is a courier for some alien 
power.

JASON: On what do you base that? 

CHIEF: Well, there was the incident of the saucer, of course. We've definitely 
established that it came from some other planet. And recently, she's been 
throwing messages inside bottles into the ocean.

JASON: (BEAT) What sort of messages?

CHIEF: They're always the same. I have one right here. You're welcome to read 
it and see if it makes any sense.

SOUND: RUSTLE OF PAPER UNFOLDED

CHIEF: We've had every decoding expert in the service trying to break it, but 
we can't seem to find the key. 

JASON: I see. 

CHIEF: Now, she's thrown literally hundreds of these messages in bottles into 
the sea. We've got many of them, but not all, naturally. Now, what we're most 
interested in is locating the contact.

JASON: Naturally. 

CHIEF: And that's where you fit in. We'd like you to gain this girl's 
confidence even further, try to find out just what these messages mean, and 
beyond that, what the saucer said to her. You'll be doing <u>us</u> a favor and your 
<u>country</u> a great service. 

JASON: You're-- (EXHALES) You're <u>certain</u> this is some subversive activity on 
her part?

CHIEF: How else can you explain the fact that she won't tell us her secret? 

JASON: (SIMPLY) Maybe because it's hers -- and everybody has a right to have 
something of his own.

CHIEF: Are you, er, trying to tell me that you won't cooperate? 

JASON: I didn't say that. 

CHIEF: (BEAT) I'd like to remind you, Mr. Beniades, that you have a duty - to 
<u>us</u>. 

JASON: I know that. I also have a duty to myself, and to God. Now, if you'll 
excuse me. 

MUSIC: ROMANTIC TRANSITION ... THEN BEHIND JASON--

JASON: (NARRATES) I folded the bottle message and put it in my pocket. I 
waited for her to show up. The minutes went by, and the hours, and I knew she 
wasn't coming. Or she had come, and seen me with the chief, and changed her 
mind. That's when I left the café and walked down to the beach. That's when I 
dragged her out of the surf before she could follow one of her bottles into 
the water. 

SOUND: BEACH BACKGROUND (WAVES, GULLS, ET CETERA)

JASON: How do you feel now? Are you cold? 

JANET: Why should you care? 

JASON: I do.

JANET: Is that why you were sitting with the security chief in the café? 

JASON: I didn't arrange that meeting. (BEAT) He asked me to spy on you.

JANET: I suppose he told you about the bottles. 

JASON: Yes. 

JANET: (CHUCKLES DARKLY) Wonder how much of the taxpayers' money they've spent 
gathering them up. You'd think they'd get tired of it. All the writing in the 
bottles is the same. 

JASON: Maybe you could have saved a lot of trouble. 

JANET: Do you think so? All of 'em -- judges, jailers, jukeboxes -- people. Do 
you really think it would have saved me a minute's trouble if I'd told them 
the whole truth at the very beginning? 

JASON: Wouldn't it? 

JANET: No. They wouldn't have believed me. What they wanted was a - a new 
weapon: some super-scientific "super-science" from some alien super-race. 
Science -- it's all they think of.

JASON: Well, it's pretty important. 

JANET: Would it ever have occurred to them that this super-race from another 
planet might have super-feelings? Or super-longings? Super-loneliness? No. All 
they think about is - weapons. (ARCHLY) Isn't it time you ask me what the 
saucer said? 

JASON: No. 

JANET: They <u>all</u> ask me. 

JASON: I don't have to ask you. I know. 

JANET: (SURPRISED) You know? 

JASON: Let me read it to you. 

SOUND: RUSTLE OF PAPER UNFOLDED

MUSIC: GENTLY IN BEHIND JASON ... THEN INCREASINGLY WARM AND BEAUTIFUL IN BG--

JASON: (READS, SOLEMNLY) 
"There is in certain living souls 
A quality of loneliness unspeakable, 
So great it must be shared 
As company is shared by lesser beings. 
Such a loneliness is mine; so know by this 
That in immensity 
There is one lonelier than you."
 
JANET: (NO LONGER BITTER, QUIETLY AGLOW) How did you know?

JASON: It's the message you put in the bottles -- the same message that some 
lonely, strange being in some other world put into a bottle, only his bottle 
was a flying saucer, and sent across space to you. 

JANET: You knew? 

JASON: I'm lonely, too. Look at me. I've never had the love of a woman. They 
think I'm pretty ugly. 

JANET: (WHISPERS) You're not ugly.

JASON: (AGREES) No. I don't feel ugly right now. 

JANET: Say it again. The message from the saucer.

JASON: "Know by this that in immensity there is one lonelier than you."

JANET: (THOUGHTFUL) I wonder if whoever first wrote it has found someone. 

JASON: I think perhaps he has. 

MUSIC: UP FOR A WARM AND HOPEFUL TRANSITION ... THEN BEHIND JASON--

JASON: (NARRATES) She looked at me and said nothing, but it was as if a light 
came from her, more light than even the practiced moon could cast. 

MUSIC: GENTLY OUT

SOUND: BEACH BACKGROUND ... WAVES ON SHORE

JASON: (NARRATES) Among the many things it meant was the fact that even to 
loneliness there is an end, for those who are lonely enough, long enough. 

SOUND: NO MUSICAL CURTAIN, JUST THE CRASH OF WAVES ... UP TO FILL A LONG PAUSE 
... THEN FADES GENTLY OUT
