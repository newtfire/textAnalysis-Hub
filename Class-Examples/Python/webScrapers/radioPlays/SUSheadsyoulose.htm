ANNOUNCER: And now -- a tale well-calculated to keep you in--

MUSIC: CHORD

ANNOUNCER: --SUSPENSE! We live in an age of wonders. What was yesterday's 
impossibility is today's miracle and tomorrow's fact. So perhaps our story 
today <u>isn't</u> just a story. We only say <u>perhaps</u>, but it might be worth asking 
yourself, "Is it just a story?"

In a moment, Act One of "Heads You Lose," starring William Redfield as Steve 
Kimberly and written especially for SUSPENSE by Robert Arthur.

The first portion of SUSPENSE is brought to you by the makers of Alpine 
Cigarettes.

MUSIC: MELLOW ... FOR A COMMERCIAL ... THEN IN BG--

2ND ANNCR: What's it like to smoke an Alpine? Well, it's like many fresh, 
lighthearted things you enjoy. It's like the splash of an oar on a quiet lake. 
Like the sight of a flag rippling in the wind. The way the air suddenly cools 
during a summer rain. That's what it's like to smoke an Alpine. It's nothing 
at all like the sort of smoking you may be used to. Alpine gives you a fresh, 
high-spirited sort of smoke -- a hearty, even exhilarating, kind of taste. If 
this sounds good to you, try Alpine filter cigarettes.

SINGERS: There's something more to smoking with an Alpine Cigarette.

MUSIC: COMMERCIAL OUT ... THEN A LIGHT INTRODUCTION ... THEN BEHIND KIMBERLY--

KIMBERLY: (NARRATES) It was a nice, chilly morning in October and Rollo 
Collins and I were sitting in Rollo's office wondering where our next dollar 
was coming from. Rollo didn't <u>look</u> hungry since he weighs about three hundreds 
pounds and has the appearance of a dishonest cherub, but I knew he was. As for 
me, Steve Kimberly, I felt like a walking skeleton. 

Rollo and I were private detectives. Now, I won't try to whitewash us. Let me 
just say, nobody ever actually <u>proved</u> anything against us. But we were, let's 
face it, a firm people came to in desperation with cases more reputable firms 
wouldn't handle. And when the intercom buzzed, Rollo and I jumped.

SOUND: INTERCOM BUZZES ... CLICK! OF SWITCH

ROLLO: (INTO COM) Yes, my dear?

SECRETARY: (FILTER) A gentleman by the name of Harrison Ward to see you, Mr. 
Collins.

ROLLO: Mr. Ward?

SECRETARY: (FILTER) That's right, sir. He's an attorney.

ROLLO: Oh. By all means, show him right in.

SECRETARY: (FILTER) Yes, sir.

SOUND: CLICK! OF SWITCH

MUSIC: IN BG

KIMBERLY: (NARRATES) Harrison Ward was a tall thin guy with a tall thin face. 
And as he closed the office door and looked at us, his Adam's apple jumped up 
and down nervously.

WARD: My name is Ward. Uh, Harrison Ward. I'm an attorney. I wish to engage 
you to find someone for me.

KIMBERLY: (NARRATES) Uh huh. Butter wouldn't have melted in Rollo's mouth as 
he waved Ward to a chair.

MUSIC: OUT

ROLLO: You've come to the right place, Mr. Ward. We find people; that's our 
business.

WARD: Well, this is an unusual case. I want you to find-- His name is Joshua 
Franklin.

ROLLO: Joshua Franklin? Surely you're not serious? Joshua Franklin's 
disappearance is one of the great mysteries of the century.

KIMBERLY: Isn't he the Wall Street financier who walked out of his office one 
day with a hundred thousand in cash?

WARD: That's the man.

KIMBERLY: Ah. And was never seen again?

WARD: Precisely.

KIMBERLY: Hmm.

WARD: Not the slightest clue to his fate has ever been discovered. I told you 
it was an unusual case.

ROLLO: But, my dear Mr. Ward, according to my recollection, even when he 
vanished, Joshua Franklin was a dying man.

WARD: Yes. Yes, that's true. His body was riddled with disease. Doctors gave 
him six months at the outside. It was such a pity. That brilliant financial 
mind that was keen as ever, and a body that no miracle of science could keep 
going.

KIMBERLY: In that case, Mr. Ward, no matter where he went, Joshua Franklin 
must have died at least six years ago.

WARD: Oh, yes. A dozen specialists assure me he cannot possibly still be 
alive.

ROLLO: And yet you wish us to find him? My dear Mr. Ward, on occasion, we do 
the impossible. But we cannot work miracles.

KIMBERLY: What you need, Mr. Ward, is a spirit medium.

WARD: Please, gentlemen, I assure you, I've come to you in desperation. I know 
that Mr. Franklin must be dead. And yet--

ROLLO: (BEAT) Yes? Please go on.

WARD: Three weeks ago, Joshua Franklin spoke to me on the telephone.

KIMBERLY: Oh, come on now. You can hardly expect us to believe that.

WARD: Well, it couldn't have been anybody else. He identified himself by a 
secret code.

ROLLO: Did you recognize his voice?

WARD: Well, no. It - it <u>did</u> seem changed. But it may have been a bad 
connection.

ROLLO: Mr. Ward, you're certain it was Joshua Franklin?

WARD: I'd swear to it. The things he reminded me of-- Well, no one else knew 
about them -- living or dead.

KIMBERLY: Oh, I'll bet. Especially dead.

ROLLO: Tell me, just <u>why</u> did Joshua Franklin phone you?

WARD: He instructed me to sell ten thousand shares of Universal Mining stock 
which he owned.

ROLLO: Did he say why?

WARD: He promised to explain later. But he never called again.

KIMBERLY: Probably St. Peter wouldn't let him slip out to use the telephone.

ROLLO: (ADMONISHES) Uh, Steve-- (TO WARD) Uh, Mr. Ward, think carefully. Was 
it a long distance call?

KIMBERLY: What else could it have been, Rollo? <u>Very</u> long distance.

WARD: I think it was a local call. But with this new direct dialing it's so 
hard to tell.

ROLLO: Mr. Ward, we are forced to believe that Joshua Franklin is still alive 
in or near this city. We, uh, will take the case. Our fee is one hundred 
dollars a day.

WARD: That's quite all right.

ROLLO: In addition, we will expect to collect the reward originally offered. 
One hundred thousand dollars if we find him alive and fifty thousand if we 
find him dead.

MUSIC: TRANSITION ... THEN BEHIND KIMBERLY--

KIMBERLY: (NARRATES) So at last we had a case -- finding a missing millionaire 
who had been dead seven years. Harrison Ward gave us a five hundred dollar 
advance and left. My own starting point was that mysterious phone call and the 
order to sell ten thousand shares of Universal Mining stock. I went to a 
stockbroker friend. He told me the unexpected sale had created a small panic 
in Universal Mining. Somebody usually makes money off such panics. My friend 
came up with a name -- the name of an individual who had sold Universal Mining 
short just before the panic and made about twenty thousand dollars. The man 
was an amateur, not an experienced Wall Street operator. I did some checking 
on the fellow and then reported back to Rollo Collins.

ROLLO: You say his name is Green? Lawson Green?

KIMBERLY: Mm hm.

ROLLO: Don't place it. But somehow it's familiar.

KIMBERLY: Professor Lawson Green, Ph.D., FRCS, and a lot of other initials. 
About ten years ago, he was a professor of neurosurgery at a big medical 
college.

ROLLO: Hmm. You say he <u>was</u>? What happened?

KIMBERLY: Well, he got mixed up in some kind of scandal -- something to do 
with some rather radical experiments he was making -- and he resigned. Since 
then, he's been living all alone out in the suburbs.

ROLLO: And you think he made that telephone call and hoaxed our legal friend 
Harrison Ward?

KIMBERLY: Oh, Rollo, I think he did. He's the only one who cashed in on the 
deal.

ROLLO: Curious, Steve. Curious. I wonder where he got that confidential stuff 
he told Ward.

KIMBERLY: Maybe he knew Joshua Franklin once. Anyway, I'm gonna find out. Sit 
tight, Rollo, while I go out and have words with the mysterious Professor 
Green.

MUSIC: TRANSITION ... THEN BEHIND KIMBERLY--

KIMBERLY: (NARRATES) Professor Green's place turned out to be a big stone 
house set back in a grove of trees and surrounded by a heavy wire fence. 
Obviously, he liked solitude. I drove into the local village and asked some 
questions. It turned out the professor had bought the place seven years before 
and put in a lot of curious machinery. With him, he'd had a white-haired man 
he called his brother. Only, the brother had never been seen again. Yeah. And 
just seven years earlier, Joshua Franklin had disappeared, too. A connection? 
(CHUCKLES) I'd have bet my life on it. So I telephoned Professor Green.

GREEN: (FILTER, IMPATIENTLY) Hello? Hello? What do you want?

KIMBERLY: Umm, is this Professor Green?

GREEN: (FILTER) Yes, yes. Who are you? Why are you calling me?

KIMBERLY: My name is Steve Kimberly. I'd like to talk to you about an old 
friend of yours -- Joshua Franklin.

GREEN: (FILTER, INHALES SHARPLY) About who?

KIMBERLY: <u>Whom</u> is the correct usage, professor.

GREEN: (FILTER) I don't know what you're talking about. Goodbye.

KIMBERLY: (QUICKLY) Ah, not so fast, professor. I'm just a fella who's 
interested in Joshua Franklin. I'm working alone, but, if you insist, I can 
call in the cops.

GREEN: (FILTER) Police?!

KIMBERLY: Only, I hate crowds. Don't you?

GREEN: (FILTER, EXHALES) Very well. Come out to my house. I'll see you. 

MUSIC: TRANSITION ... THEN BEHIND KIMBERLY--

KIMBERLY: (NARRATES) You see? Sometimes the easy way is the best way. I drove 
back; the gate was open. I drove up to the front door. A little white-haired 
man with bright nervous eyes and shaking fingers let me in.

GREEN: Well, come in, come in.

KIMBERLY: Thank you, professor. 

SOUND: KIMBERLY'S STEPS IN ... DOOR CLOSES ... A FEW MORE STEPS

KIMBERLY: I'm glad you agreed to see me, er, alone.

GREEN: I haven't any idea what you want. I agreed to see you just to stop this 
insufferable nuisance.

KIMBERLY: Well, I'd hardly call one phone call insufferable. However, I'll get 
down to business. Where is Joshua Franklin? What became of him?

GREEN: I don't know. I never heard of Joshua Franklin. Now, young man, 
goodbye.

KIMBERLY: Nuh nuh nuh. You're not getting rid of me that easily, professor, so 
let's start over. (DELIBERATELY) Where is Joshua Franklin? 

GREEN: (AGITATED) What do you want? Why have you come here? I won't let you 
ruin my experiment! It's my whole life! And now you're trying to destroy what 
I've done. Take away everything that I've accomplished, after I've given up my 
career -- everything! -- to - to-- (SPLUTTERS)

KIMBERLY: Oh, professor, professor, easy, easy. You're gonna blow your top 
here. Now, believe me, I'm not here to destroy anything. I'm here as a friend. 
I want to help you.

GREEN: (BEAT, CALMER) What - what brought you here anyway?

KIMBERLY: That little transaction in Universal Mining stock.

GREEN: So that's it.

KIMBERLY: Mm hm.

GREEN: I was afraid, but he told me to do it.

KIMBERLY: He? You mean -- Joshua Franklin?

GREEN: (BEAT, CONCEDES) Yes. I mean Joshua Franklin.

KIMBERLY: (SLOWLY) Ahhhhhh. You've got him here in this house? You've kept him 
a prisoner all these years?

GREEN: No! I only saved his life. I'm the one who's been the prisoner.

KIMBERLY: (AMAZED) You saved his life? In - in spite of what the doctors said? 
Well, man, why all the secrecy? You could have been famous!

GREEN: You'll see. Yes! I'll take you to Joshua Franklin himself. And then 
you'll understand.

MUSIC: TRANSITION ... THEN BEHIND KIMBERLY--

KIMBERLY: (NARRATES) The little professor led me down a long corridor to a 
heavy metal door and, as we went, my brain was clicking like an adding 
machine. I was busy trying to figure out my next step when Green led me down a 
flight of stairs into a pitch black room. There was some kind of pump going.

SOUND: EERIE ELECTRONIC PULSATING PUMP NOISE ... CONTINUES IN BG

GREEN: Here we are. Joshua Franklin is in this room.

KIMBERLY: Uh huh. Well, turn on the light.

GREEN: No, no. Not yet. I'll speak to him first. Now, don't be surprised if 
his voice is, uh, odd. 

SOUND: CLICK! OF SWITCH

GREEN: (CALLS GENTLY) Mr. Franklin, I'm here. How are you this morning?

FRANKLIN: I'm tired. Tired beyond human endurance.

GREEN: I know. But I'm working on the problem. Soon you'll be a new man again.

FRANKLIN: Don't bother to lie to me. I know the truth.

GREEN: You must be patient. It takes time and money.

FRANKLIN: You'll never succeed. Never. I was a fool ever to think you could. I 
should have died as nature intended. Finish me now and let me have peace.

GREEN: Please, you must be patient. I'll return later. Now rest.

SOUND: CLICK! OF SWITCH

GREEN: (TO KIMBERLY) Now he can no longer hear us. I shall turn on the light.

SOUND: CLICK! OF LIGHT SWITCH

KIMBERLY: (SUSPICIOUSLY) Hey! This is a laboratory. Nothing in here but 
apparatus. Wha--? Where's Franklin?

GREEN: He's in here. He was speaking to us through this loudspeaker.

KIMBERLY: Well, okay. Then where <u>is</u> he?

GREEN: Over there. In the far corner.

KIMBERLY: In the--? (SKEPTICAL LAUGH) Now quit kidding. All I see is that 
pump, a lot of glass tubing with some red liquid bubbling through it, and -- 
on top -- a black glass ball about eighteen inches in diameter.

GREEN: To save Joshua Franklin, desperate measures were necessary.

KIMBERLY: What do you mean?

GREEN: He's inside that glass ball.

KIMBERLY: What?!

GREEN: The pump keeps him alive.

KIMBERLY: Inside that glass ball? Well, you couldn't get a man in that thing. 
You could just about get his-- (BEAT, REALIZES) Oh, no.

GREEN: Exactly, Mr. Kimberly. His head.

MUSIC: TRANSITION ... THEN BEHIND KIMBERLY--

KIMBERLY: (NARRATES) I believed him. I <u>had</u> to believe him. We went back 
upstairs and talked. Green told me how he'd been experimenting with animals, 
gone too far, and got fired. Then how Joshua Franklin had come to him.

GREEN: You see, he had heard an exaggerated account of my experiments. He 
offered me a hundred thousand dollars to give him a new body.

KIMBERLY: Put his head on a new body?

GREEN: Exactly. I told him I couldn't do it. He insisted. He was dying and he 
was frantic. So I agreed.

KIMBERLY: Knowing all the time you couldn't?!

GREEN: Not then, no. But I hoped that someday I could. So we came here and I 
performed the operation. I discarded the disease-ridden body. I placed the 
healthy head inside the glass, where it's kept alive by a circulating nutrient 
fluid. I-- Oh, but the details don't matter. All these years I've struggled in 
secret, afraid that if the world knew, I'd be called a monster, put in jail. 
And now it's all for nothing. Nothing. You've found me out; you'll call the 
police!

KIMBERLY: Now, professor, professor, take it easy. You've got it all wrong. 
I'm here to help you.

GREEN: Help me? How?

KIMBERLY: (SLOWLY) Well, for one thing, I'm going to be -- your business 
manager.

GREEN: I - I don't understand.

KIMBERLY: Now, look, you need assistants, a big laboratory. With those, you 
might succeed yet in learning how to join Franklin's head to another healthy 
body.

GREEN: (REALIZES) Ohhhh. Yes! Yes, I could! I'm sure of it! Oh, but it would 
take so much money.

KIMBERLY: That's just it, that's just it. That'll be <u>my</u> job. Now, downstairs 
in that lab, you have one of the smartest minds that ever operated on Wall 
Street. We'll use it to plot stock market operations that will net us 
millions! That Universal Mining deal was just penny ante stuff.

GREEN: Oh, but it won't work. He won't cooperate.

KIMBERLY: Oh, that's all right. Let me argue with him. Maybe I'm more - 
<u>persuasive</u> than you are. I'll talk to him now. Alone.

MUSIC: TRANSITION ... THEN BEHIND KIMBERLY--

KIMBERLY: (NARRATES) The professor finally agreed. He took me back down into 
his lab, switched on the apparatus, and left me alone.

SOUND: EERIE ELECTRONIC PULSATING PUMP NOISE ... CONTINUES IN BG

KIMBERLY: Mr. Franklin? Mr. Franklin? Can you hear me?

FRANKLIN: Who's there?

KIMBERLY: My name is Kimberly. Professor Green has called me in to help him 
with your case.

FRANKLIN: It's too late. I have no hope. If you knew how tired I am, how 
terribly tired--

KIMBERLY: Now, look, it's only a matter of money. With your help, we can <u>get</u> 
the money.

FRANKLIN: I'm not interested. I refuse to help you. I've tried to avoid my 
destiny and I've been punished for it. But I've suffered enough. In the name 
of Heaven, shut off the pump and let me go.

KIMBERLY: Now, Mr. Franklin, I don't want to do--

FRANKLIN: Listen! Are you interested in money, hm?

KIMBERLY: (CHUCKLES) Well, sure I am. Isn't everybody?

FRANKLIN: If you want money, I'll pay you two hundred thousand dollars. That 
interest you?

KIMBERLY: It interests me a whole lot. What do I have to do for it?

FRANKLIN: Just one thing. Shut off the pump.

KIMBERLY: Shut off the pump?

FRANKLIN: Let me find peace at last. If you knew how unendurable it is to 
spend your life in utter blackness, thinking, thinking, always thinking-- 
Please, Mr. Kimberly, tell me that you agree.

KIMBERLY: Uh huh. Well, why not?

MUSIC: TRANSITION ... THEN BEHIND KIMBERLY--

KIMBERLY: (NARRATES) Now, maybe you've guessed I hadn't any intention of going 
through with the deal. But I let him talk, and this is how he explained it to 
me. His lawyer Ward had the key to a safe deposit box, but didn't know what 
was in it. We arranged I was to phone Ward, put the phone in front of the 
speaker, and that way Franklin could talk to him like he had before. So I did 
it. I set everything up for Joshua Franklin's living head in its glass ball to 
talk to Harrison Ward. Ward was puzzled, but he agreed to give me the key when 
I arrived, and I hung up fast.

SOUND: EERIE ELECTRONIC PULSATING PUMP NOISE ... CONTINUES IN BG

KIMBERLY: There, Mr. Franklin. It's all set.

FRANKLIN: Now keep your word. Shut off the pump.

KIMBERLY: Well, sure, Mr. Franklin, sure -- just as soon as I get the money 
out of the deposit box.

FRANKLIN: You promised to stop the pump.

KIMBERLY: And I will, I will. But I haven't got the money yet. As soon as I 
have it, I'll turn the pump off.

FRANKLIN: (RELIEVED) Ahhh! Thank you. And, after all these years, I'll be able 
to have peace. (PLEADS) You're not lying to me. You swear you <u>will</u> stop the 
pump and let me go?

KIMBERLY: Sure, Mr. Franklin. I - swear it.

MUSIC: QUICK TRANSITION ... THEN BEHIND KIMBERLY--

KIMBERLY: (NARRATES) Of course, I had my fingers crossed when I said it. Shut 
off that pump and do myself out of a million dollars? Not Mrs. Kimberly's 
little boy Steve! Only, something happened I hadn't figured on. The door burst 
open and Professor Green rushed in.

SOUND: DOOR OPENS

GREEN: I've been listening! But I won't let you do it! I <u>won't</u>!

KIMBERLY: No, no, professor, listen to me. You're making a mistake. You see--

GREEN: You can't stop the pump! You can't let Franklin die!

KIMBERLY: Professor, listen--

GREEN: It's my whole life's work!

KIMBERLY: I-- Look--

GREEN: I'll stop you! I'll kill you!

SOUND: GUNSHOT!

KIMBERLY: (NARRATES) He shot at me and the shot went wild. I ducked and yelled 
at him-- (TO GREEN, YELLS) Professor, let me tell you something! I wasn't--!

GREEN: I'll kill you, do you hear?! I'll kill you!

SOUND: GUNSHOT! CRASH! OF GLASS BREAKING

KIMBERLY: (NARRATES) The second shot went over my head and hit the glass ball 
which held all that remained alive of Joshua Franklin. I looked up and for 
just a second I saw the glass ball split open and fall towards me. Then the 
professor fired again.

SOUND: TWO GUNSHOTS! 

KIMBERLY: (NARRATES, GROANS, WEAKLY) This time, both bullets hit me somewhere 
in the chest or stomach, and that was the last thing I knew as I dived into a 
pool of darkness a million miles deep. 

SOUND: EERIE ELECTRONIC PULSATING PUMP NOISE ... SNEAKS IN BRIEFLY DURING 
ABOVE 

MUSIC: TRANSITION ... THEN IN BG--

KIMBERLY: (NARRATES) How long the darkness lasted, I don't know. A day, a 
week, a year? But at last, through the darkness that seemed to crush in on me 
like a ton of black velvet curtains, I heard Rollo's voice.

ROLLO: (FILTER) Steve? Steve, can you hear me? Steve? 

KIMBERLY: (NARRATES) I tried to open my eyes and found they <u>were</u> open -- and 
it was still pitch dark. I moved my lips -- and words came out.

MUSIC: OUT

KIMBERLY: Rollo? I hear you.

ROLLO: (FILTER) Oh, that's fine, Steve; that's fine. I was worried about you.

KIMBERLY: Where am I? What happened? I remember Green shooting me. Then--

ROLLO: (FILTER) Uh, one question at a time, Steve. As for where you are, 
you're in Washington, D. C.

KIMBERLY: In - Washington?

ROLLO: (FILTER) In a secret room down in the basement of a certain hospital, 
Steve my friend. You can expect lots of company. Doctors, scientists. They'll 
all be here to ask you questions.

KIMBERLY: Oh, you mean about Green, and how he kept Joshua Franklin's head 
alive.

ROLLO: (FILTER) Er, no, Steve. About you. You see, officially, you're dead.

KIMBERLY: I'm - dead?

ROLLO: (FILTER) You had a very nice funeral -- in Lawnwood Cemetery.

KIMBERLY: What are you talking about? Why does your voice sound so funny?

SOUND: EERIE ELECTRONIC PULSATING PUMP NOISE ... SNEAKS IN DURING ABOVE ... 
CONTINUES IN BG

ROLLO: (FILTER) Because you're hearing it through a special hook-up. You see, 
Steve, when you didn't come back, I called on Professor Green. After he killed 
you, he cracked up completely. But, er, not before he'd done one thing. Not 
before he'd saved your life. The same way he saved Joshua Franklin.

KIMBERLY: (REALIZES, HORRIFIED, SLOWLY) No. It's not true.

ROLLO: (FILTER) I'm afraid it is. Listen.

SOUND: PUMP NOISE FADES UP A LITTLE ... CONTINUES IN BG

ROLLO: (FILTER) That's the pump that keeps you alive. The government is taking 
care of you now, Steve. You're a Top Secret hush-hush project. But you should 
feel pretty good. You're immortal now. You're going to live forever -- in your 
little glass jar. (LAUGHS HEARTILY)
