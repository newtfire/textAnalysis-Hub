BACKGROUND) 

MORGAN: "Mystery in the Air", starring Peter Lorre ... presented by Camel 
Cigarettes. 

MUSIC: "MYSTERY IN THE AIR" THEME 

INSPECTOR: All right, men...I guess that's all. Put him on the stretcher and 
take him to the morgue. 

ELLEN: (FADES IN, SLIGHTLY) Must I stay, Inspector? 

INSPECTOR: For a while, Mrs. Bunting. I need all the details for my report. 

ELLEN: (ANGUISHED) That such a thing could've happened here... here in my own 
house. 

MUSIC: SWELLS TO BACKGROUND

MORGAN: Each week at this hour, Peter Lorre brings us the excitement of the 
great stories of the strange and unusual - of dark and compelling masterpieces 
culled from the four corners of world literature. 

MUSIC: OUT 

MORGAN: Tonight, "The Lodger", by Mrs. Belloc Lowndes. Peter Lorre is "The 
Lodger" and Ellen Bunting is played by Miss Agnes Moorehead. 

MUSIC: GONG...THEN SNEAK IN CURTAIN 

ROY: "Mystery in the Air"...brought to you by <u>Camel</u> <u>Cigarettes</u>!

MUSIC: CURTAIN UP TO FINISH 

(APPLAUSE) 

ROY: Experience is the best teacher: Try a Camel - let your own experience 
tell you why more people are smoking Camels than ever before. Yes...let your 
"T-Zone" decide which cigarette <u>you</u> like best. Your "T-Zone"...that's T for 
Taste and T for Throat... is <u>your</u> true proving ground for <u>any</u> cigarette. So 
try a Camel on your "T-Zone"... Introduce Camel's rich, full flavor to your 
Taste... Acquaint your Throat with Camel's cool mildness. See if you don't 
decide, like so many other smokers, that Camels suit your "T-Zone" to a T!
 
MUSIC: "MYSTERY IN THE AIR" THEME TO SHIMMER...THEN DOWN AND OUT 

INSPECTOR: Go on, Mrs. Bunting - you said you were looking for a lodger? 

ELLEN: Yes, Inspector, we had to! But I never dreamed such a thing could 
happen here - to us! Why, it was only last Tuesday night my husband and I were 
sitting before our fire while we read in the newspaper about the latest 
murder...the fifth...by...the Avenger. I remember saying distinctly... 

ELLEN: (AS THE THOUGHT HITS HER) Robert, this Avenger person could be the 
fellow standing next to you...or maybe the man you bump into. It's a terrible 
thought. 

BUNTING: Yes. But it appears to me that the Avenger's too quick for the 
police. 

SOUND: NEWSPAPER RATTLES 

ELLEN: And look here...it says this girl he got last night was like all the 
others...pretty, blonde, and she'd just come from a music hall...exactly like 
all the rest of his victims. Tch, tch...what a pity. 

BUNTING: Ellen, have you stopped to think who fits that description perfectly? 
Our own Daisy. 

ELLEN: Shush, what a pretty thought, Bunting. It's a good thing she's with her 
aunt instead of here. London ain't a safe place for any girl now. 

BUNTING: Just the same, I can't help thinking how fine it'd be to have her 
here with us. 

ELLEN: Well, there's no sense even talking about it... We just can't afford 
it.

BUNTING: I know that, Ellen. But I've hoped we could manage it someway. 

ELLEN: How? Haven't I scrimped myself half crazy trying to keep us going? 

BUNTING: I know, Ellen. Well, don't you go worrying about it. I think we 
can... 

SOUND: KNOCKING ON DOOR, OFF 

ELLEN: Now who do you suppose that could be? 

BUNTING: Could it be someone looking for a room? 

ELLEN: Oh, I wish it were. Then you could have your Daisy back.... 

MUSIC: SNEAKS IN...HOLDS UNDER 

ELLEN: (NARRATING) I went to the front door and when I opened it, there stood 
a man wearing a black cape and hat. He carried but a single piece of luggage. 

MUSIC: ACCENTS . . THEN CUTS 

ELLEN: Good evening sir. 

LORRE: I saw your sign. It says you have a room to rent. 

ELLEN: Yes sir! ... Please...won't you come in. 

SOUND: DOOR SHUTS UNDER: 

LORRE: Thank you. 

ELLEN: Could I... take your cape, sir? 

LORRE: No. I am looking for a quiet room...but it should be very quiet. 

ELLEN: Oh, we have that sir...just that. Above all, our house is quiet. Your 
bag, sir...may I take it? 

LORRE: No. Just show me the room, please.

ELLEN: Oh, yes...yes, sir. It's right up these stairs, sir...this way. 

SOUND: THEIR FOOTSTEPS ON STAIRS 

ELLEN: (AFTER A PAUSE) You see, sir, there's just my husband and me here...and 
we're ever so quiet. I'm sure you'll find this room to your liking. 

SOUND: FOOTSTEPS DOWN HALL...DOOR OPENS 

ELLEN: Here we are. 

LORRE: (LOOKING AROUND) I think I like this room. 

ELLEN: (ANXIOUSLY) It is pleasant, isn't it, sir? There's not many rooms with 
such pretty pictures, now is there? 

LORRE: I don't know...Pretty pictures interest me very little. What I like 
about the room is the simplicity. I like the bareness. I think I'll take it. 
What is your name? 

ELLEN: Mrs. Bunting, Sir. 

LORRE: All right, Mrs. Bunting - I'll take the room. 

ELLEN: Yes, sir. And please, sir, let me help you with your luggage. 

LORRE: No...don't you touch it! 

ELLEN: But I...I only wished to... 

LORRE:. You only wished to help, of course. I understand, Missus...ah, 
Bunting. It's...forgive me - it's just that I...I'm so very weary....I'm tired 
-- I do a lot of studying... 

ELLEN: Of course, sir, of course. 

LORRE: (SOFTLY) You can see how few things I need - just what's in this bag - 
but this is my favorite book - the Bible. It's a good book Mrs. Bunting, isn't 
it?

ELLEN: Indeed it is, sir. 

LORRE: Yes - it says "He brings them to their desired haven...." Beautiful 
words, huh? And now, at last, I've found my haven of rest. If I pay you thirty 
shillings a week for this room...is that satisfactory? 

ELLEN: Thirt--! Why, yes sir! Yes sir, that'll be quite all right. 

LORRE: My name is Sleuth. 

ELLEN: Mister Sleuth? 

LORRE: Yes, Sleuth. (SPELLS IT) S-L-E-U-T-H. Think of a hound, Missus Bunting, 
and you'll never forget my name... And here are your thirty shillings. 

ELLEN: Thank you, sir. And would you be wishing anything now... Supper...tea?

LORRE: No - nothing. Goodnight, Mrs. Bunting. 

ELLEN: Yes, goodnight, sir. (FADES, HUMS GAILY)

SOUND: DOOR CLOSES 

LORRE: (CALLING) Please stop that - you hear!

ELLEN: (STOPS HUMMING SUDDENLY) (OFF) Oh...sir! (FADING IN AGAIN) What did I 
do? 

LORRE: You were humming. That's music! 

ELLEN: But, I -- 

LORRE: Music is an instrument of sin. 

LORRE: (WEAKLY) (ON) Yes, sir. 

LORRE: And you did tell me, Mrs. Bunting, that your house would be absolutely 
quiet. 

ELLEN: But it is, sir. I didn't mean any harm, believe me, sir.

LORRE: I believe you. I'm sorry I spoke sharply. I know you are trying to be 
considerate and kind. 

ELLEN: Oh, thank you, sir.

LORRE: Oh by the way, Mrs. Bunting, I think I would like some bread and some 
tea.

ELLEN: (FADING) Certainly, sir, I'll have it in an instant.

SOUND: DOOR CLOSES

MUSIC: BRIDGE AND OUT 

SOUND: RATTLE OF DISHES FOLLOWS ACTION, UNDER 

BUNTING: (JOYFULLY) (AS THOUGH HE'S REPEATED IT MANY TIMES) So he took the 
room, eh, Ellen. He took the room. And at thirty shillings a week! 

ELLEN: (BUSTLING ABOUT) In advance. Hurry now, Bunting. Is the water for the 
tea hot yet? 

BUNTING: Yes. What a stroke of -- 

ELLEN: Put the bread and the butter on the tray. I'll pour the water. 

BUNTING: You know, Ellen, it's wonderful. Do you realize what this means? We 
can have Daisy back with us now. 

ELLEN: (IMPATIENTLY) I know, I know. Hurry with it, now. 

BUNTING: Why, we can have her back with us tomorrow. 

ELLEN: Now..there's the water...the tea...the... It's all ready. Open the 
door, Bunting, I'll take it up to him right away.

BUNTING: There you go, old girl. (FADES) First thing in the morning I'm going 
to fetch Daisy and bring her home. Oh, it's a wonderful night, Ellen. 
Wonderful! 

SOUND: FOOTSTEPS UP STAIRS...SLIGHT RATTLE OF TRAY 

ELLEN: (SHE BEGINS TO HUM THEN QUICKLY CATCHES HERSELF) (LOW) Oh. Oh, I 
mustn't. 

LORRE: (AS ELLEN'S FOOTSTEPS GO DOWN HALL) (FADE IN) "She has cast down many 
wounded from her. Yea, many strong men have been slain by her..." 

SOUND: KNOCK ON DOOR 

LORRE: (OFF) Come in. (AS DOOR OPENS) "And to know the wickedness of folly." 

ELLEN: (GASPS) Why, Mister Sleuth, you... 

LORRE: Yes. What is it? 

ELLEN: Those pictures! Those pretty girls! You've turned all their faces to 
the wall! 

LORRE: Yes...I've turned them to the wall because they're wicked and sinful. 

ELLEN: But, sir, I... 

LORRE: (CONTINUING) .. Don't you agree Mrs. Bunting, that everything wicked 
and sinful should be purged from the earth? (PAUSE) Hmm? 

ELLEN: (FRIGHTENED) Yes...yes, I do. 

LORRE: (QUIETER) I'm happy to hear that, Mrs. Bunting. Now if you'll excuse 
me. I have to leave. 

ELLEN: But, sir - here's your tray.

LORRE: Good night, Missus Bunting. 

SOUND: FOOTSTEPS DOWN HALL...AND (FADING) ON STAIRS..DOOR SHUTS. 

ELLEN: (NARRATING) You know, for a moment I was stiff with fear. I set the 
tray down; he hadn't so much as noticed the light supper I'd prepared for him, 
and rushed to the window to watch. 

MUSIC: SNEAKS IN UNDER AND HOLDS 

ELLEN: He came out of our cottage and moved off down the street, his black 
cape swirling about him. Finally, he was lost in the fog and, I don't know 
why, but I stared after him for a long while. Well, I did the dishes and got 
ready for bed. I lay there thinking and it was almost dawn before I had 
convinced myself that at most he was a trifle odd - and after all, paying 
thirty shillings, maybe he had a right to his strange ways. 

MUSIC: ACCENTS, THEN SWELLS IN...THEN FADES UNDER AND HOLDS

ELLEN: It was daylight when I was suddenly awakened by the newsboys' shouts in 
the street... 

NEWSBOY: (FAR OFF) 'Orrible murder! Read all about it! 

2ND NEWS: (OFF, OVERLAPPING) Murder at King's Cross last night! Avenger 
strikes again! Extra special! 

ELLEN: (OVERLAPS) Slowly I realized what the newsboys were shouting. 

NEWSBOY: 'Orrible murder! (IN CLEAR) Avenger takes sixth victim! 

ELLEN: Oh! Oh, no! (SCREAMS) 

NEWSBOY: (A LITTLE CLOSER) Avenger at work again! Another girl falls victim to 
his knife! Avenger strikes again! 

MUSIC: BUILDS AND COVERS SCREAM AND NEWSBOY TO CURTAIN 

(APPLAUSE) 

MORGAN: In a few moments, Mr. Peter Lorre will bring us the climax of 
tonight's "Mystery in the Air" when Camels present Act Two of - "The Lodger". 

MUSIC: GONG 

ROY: Any sports champion can tell you how true it is... that experience is the 
best teacher! 

ANDERSEN: Don Whitfield, for one. He's the world's outboard speed champion, 
you know. It's taking the turns around the marking buoys just right that makes 
that extra speed...and boy...how Don Whitfield worked out on that problem! 

ROY: Don Whitfield recently said: 

MAN: Experience is the best teacher in outboard racing...and in smoking, too. 
Smoking whatever brands I could get during the wartime cigarette shortage 
taught <u>me</u> there's no other cigarette like a Camel! 

ROY: And many other smokers had the same experience. Yes... during the wartime 
cigarette shortage, when people smoked whatever brands they could get...<u>then's</u> 
when we all compared cigarettes, whether we wanted to or not. And then's when 
so many people decided that their Taste liked Camel's rich, full flavor and 
their Throats liked Camel's cool mildness. The result -- 

CHANDLER: (FILTER) More people are smoking Camels than ever before! 

ROY: Experience is the best teacher. Try a Camel yourself! 

MUSIC: "MYSTERY" THEME TO SHIMMER - THEN UNDER TO BG

MORGAN: As the Inspector takes notes of the terrifying events Ellen Bunting 
continues the story. 

MUSIC: OUT

INSP: And now, Mrs. Bunting, what did you do the morning you learned the 
Avenger had murdered his sixth victim? 

ELLEN: Well...I was a little frightened to meet our lodger, yet I kept my 
thoughts to myself. After all, there still wasn't much to go on. Robert had 
gone to meet Daisy, so Mr. Sleuth ate breakfast alone. I watched him through 
the crack in the door. Finally, I went in with more tea. 

LORRE: No. No, thank you, Missus Bunting. I don't care for any more 
tea...thank you. You've been very kind. I must go on with my work now...if 
you'll excuse me. 

SOUND: CHAIR SCRAPED ... FOOTSTEPS FADE OFF 

ELLEN: My fear really changed to pity then. He seemed so helpless and tired. 
And he was so considerate. This man couldn't be a murderer...it was all a 
coincidence. Besides, we just couldn't afford to lose that thirty shillings a 
week. 

MUSIC: IN...ESTABLISH AND HOLD UNDER 

ELLEN: Around ten in the morning, he left the cottage and I decided to go 
upstairs and have a look about his room. I had to find out what he carried in 
his one piece of luggage. It wasn't a bag...it was more like a case. (THEN 
SLOWLY) Yes...a case...a case for a knife!

MUSIC: ACCENTS AND CONTINUES UNDER

SOUND: (FOLLOWS ACTION) 

ELLEN: I rushed up stairs, my heart beating wildly at the thought I'd had of 
the case. (OPENS DOOR) There wasn't anything in his closet. I went over to the 
chest of drawers against the wall. (DRAWER OPENED) Nothing in the top one. 
(ANOTHER OPENED) In the next one there were some socks, underclothes. (DRAWER 
OPENED) The next one was empty. There was only one other place for the small, 
narrow case...the bottom drawer. (DRAWER PULLED BUT LOCKED) And it was locked. 
(PULLED AGAIN) I pulled and pulled at it and then, suddenly, I heard the front 
door open downstairs!

MUSIC: POINTS AND OUT 

ELLEN: In a panic I rushed out of the room and down the hail. 

BUNTING: (OFF, CALLS) Oh, you're upstairs, Ellen. Look! Look, Ellen, Daisy's 
here! 

ELLEN: (SIGHS) Oh, thank heaven. 

SOUND: FOOTSTEPS UP STAIRS 

DAISY: (FADING IN) Oh, Mother, it's so good to see you. It's so good to be 
home! 

SOUND: FOOTSTEPS OUT 

DAISY: Why, whatever's the matter? 

BUNTING : Yes, you're quite white, Ellen. 

ELLEN: (RECOVERING) Oh. It's... it's...I'm all right. It's just that I wasn't 
expecting you so soon. 

DAISY: Well, it's good to be back. The country's all right, but there's 
nothing like London, now is there?

ELLEN: No. No, there isn't. 

BUNTING: Well, as long as that Avenger's about you're going to have to do 
something to keep this young lady indoors... London or no London. 

DAISY: (LAUGHING) Oh, don't you worry, Mother'll see to that. 

ELLEN: Well, Daisy, I might as well get you settled. 

DAISY: (LAUGHS) You see, Father..what'd I tell you. She'll have a dust cloth 
in my hand before I have my coat off. (THEY ALL LAUGH - THEN LAUGHS STOP 
ABRUPTLY) 

ELLEN: Mister Sleuth! 

LORRE: (PAUSE, THEN:) Why is my door open? 

BUNTING: We..we were just leaving, sir. 

LORRE: Have you been in my room? 

ELLEN: (HELPLESSLY) Oh, not at all, sir. 

LORRE: From now on, Mrs. Bunting, I shall keep my room locked. 

ELLEN: But you see, sir...I was just tidying up a bit and Mister Bunting, he 
brought our daughter home. And she just arrived and...and this is Daisy. 

DAISY: (QUIETLY, WITHOUT FEAR) Pleased to meet you, sir. 

BUNTING: (PAUSE) She's been away for quite a while...that's why we're a bit 
excited, you might say. You were probably surprised to hear us laughing and 
carrying on. 

LORRE: Yes. Yes, I must say I was. But then, there are different kinds of joy, 
are there not, Daisy? 

DAISY: Yes...I'm sure there are.

LORRE: Yes, there is the despicable, evil joy of the abandoned.. and there is 
the divine happiness of the blessed. A great difference. (EAGERLY) You 
understand that Daisy, don't you? 

DAISY: Why...yes, sir...yes, Mister Sleuth. 

LORRE: There are so few young women, nowadays, who do. 

DAISY: Why, Mister Sleuth! You mean a girl's not to enjoy life at all...not to 
have any fun? 

LORRE: Enjoyment and fun, my child, are the devil's breeding ground...all his 
implements are there...pleasure, impropriety, the temptation of music...
dancing... 

DAISY: (LAUGHS) Oh, that's crazy! Why, there's nothing I like better than 
dancing, and I'm not... 

LORRE: (INTERRUPTS SHARPLY) You like to dance! 

ELLEN: (IN A RUSH) She didn't know what she was saying, Mister Sleuth...just a 
child..... Daisy, you know you've never been one for dancing ... you never 
learned how to... 

DAISY: But I did learn, Mother...while I was away. (PUZZLED) What's so wrong 
about it? What's the harm in dancing? 

LORRE: And she lies in wait as for a prey, and increases the transgressors 
among men... 

DAISY: (DISMISSES IT) I don't know what you mean. I've never heard such 
nonsense. 

LORRE: Nonsense? You call the Scripture nonsense! 

ELLEN: Daisy! Daisy, go into the front room... 

LORRE: It's all right, Missus Bunting. It's all right. I'm used to such kind 
of talk...good day. 

SOUND: FOOTSTEPS FADING TO DOOR...DOOR CLOSES 

ELLEN: (PAUSE) (LOW TENSELY) Daisy...Daisy, listen to me. 

DAISY: Yes, Mother? 

ELLEN: I've got to tell you about...about...(BREAKS OFF) 

DAISY: About what? 

ELLEN: (PAUSE) Nothing. I've got to go out for a while now. I'll be back. 

MUSIC: SWELLS, THEN FADES UNDER AND HOLDS 

ELLEN: For a moment I was about to tell my awful suspicions, but I stopped. 
They were <u>only</u> suspicions. At the same time I had a thought: I'd go to the 
Coroner's inquest they were having into the Avenger's latest victim. I was 
hoping to hear something said that would clear my suspicions of the lodger. At 
least, I'd give him this last chance. 

MUSIC: ACCENTS..CONTINUES UNDER 

ELLEN: A lady was testifying as I took my seat. She'd seen the Avenger from 
her window, she said...and her description of him didn't tally with Mister 
Sleuth. I can't tell you how relieved I was...till it was pointed out she 
couldn't possibly have seen anyone that night from her window because of the 
fog. 

MUSIC: ACCENTS... THEN FADES OUT UNDER 

ELLEN: The next witness was a Mr. Cannot. I leaned forward anxiously as they 
swore him in and began asking questions

SOUND: COURTROOM NOISES, UNDER ... SLIGHT ECHO, ALL ARE OFF, EXCEPT ELLEN) 

CORONER: You say, Mr. Cannot, you're positive you saw this man? 

CANNOT: Positive, sir. It was only a few moments before the murder that I saw 
the Avenger. 

CORONER: Describe him. 

CANNOT: He wore a black cape, I believe, and was very gaunt looking...and was 
carrying a small handbag. 

CORONER: A handbag? 

CANNOT: Yes. A small narrow handbag. Such a one as might contain a knife!

ELLEN: (GASPS) A knife! 

CROWD: COURTROOM REACTS

CORONER: Silence in the court.

CANNOT: He had a low, hesitating voice....I'd say with something of a 
continental accent. An educated man, I'd judge, but quite mad. 

CORONER: What do you mean by that? 

CANNOT: Well, as he emerged from the fog he was talking aloud to himself. 
(STILL AWED) Believe me, sir...he was reciting scriptures from the Bible!

CROWD: COURTROOM REACTS LOUDLY 

SOUND: GAVEL RAPS, CONTINUE 

ELLEN: (ON WORD "SCRIPTURES") No! No, it can't be! It can't be! 

SOUND: EFFECTS SWELL AS: 

ELLEN: (NARRATING) (OVER EFFECTS) Could there be any doubt about it now! 
Mister Sleuth, our lodger, was the murderer! 

MUSIC: HITS...SWELLS...FADES UNDER AND HOLDS 

ELLEN: I got out of the courtroom as quick as I could. I didn't even notice it 
had started to rain....I hardly remember going home. Running and walking 
somehow... while slowly the nightmare of fear and terror grew bigger and 
bigger inside me. It was three streets from our cottage that I saw Mr. Robert 
Bunting. One thought hit me clearly...I realized Daisy must be home alone with 
the Avenger! 

MUSIC: POINTS...THEN CUTS 

ELLEN: (YELLS) Bunting! Bunting! 

BUNTING: (FADES IN) Why, Ellen! Ellen, what is it? 

ELLEN: (ALMOST SOBBING) Bunting, where's Daisy? Where is she, I say! Where's 
Daisy? 

BUNTING: Why...she's at home. 

ELLEN: Listen, Bunting, listen! Sleuth is the Avenger! 

BUNTING: What? What are you saying? 

ELLEN: Our lodger....he's the Avenger. Daisy's alone with him right now. 
Hurry! 

MUSIC: HITS ... SWELLS . . . FADES OUT 

LORRE: Listen to me carefully my child----rejoice with me in your heart for 
the moment is at hand. You're not afraid, Daisy, are you? 

DAISY: No - I'm not afraid-- 

LORRE: You're very beautiful, and you should live in the ways of 
righteousness. You hear me, Daisy? You want to live in the ways of 
righteousness, don't you? 

DAISY: Yes...Yes I do. 

LORRE: I know you do and that is why I've been sent to purge your soul, so 
that you will be elevated beyond all sin and evil. You like to dance, Daisy, 
don't you? Six have gone on before you, and they are beyond all sin and evil. 
You are the seventh to [be] elevated, my child...and my work is almost done 
for the seventh I have promised at this appointed hour. 

DAISY: (A LITTLE CRY OF FEAR)     SOUND: DOOR OPENS, FAR OFF

LORRE: Be still, Daisy, and       ELLEN: Daisy! Daisy!
don't listen to the               BUNTING: Daisy...Daisy, 
temptations of the                         where are you?
crowd when they call                       (CALLS) DAISY!
out your name                     SOUND: FOOTSTEPS HURRYING 
because I am here to                       UP STAIRS 
save you from all evil            ELLEN: In Mr. Sleuth's
and wickedness that                      room! Come, Bunting
consume you like a                       ...help me! 
wild fire of scarlet              SOUND: FOOTSTEPS UP STAIRS
and crimson. You 
like to dance, don't 
you?  

DAISY: Yes I do.                   ELLEN: (FADES ON, NEARER)

Hospital, San Francisco, California; U.S. Naval Hospital, Charleston, South 
Carolina; U.S. Marine Hospital, Ellis Island, New York; Veterans' Hospital, 
Fort Meade, South Dakota.

Camel smokers are doctors. You know, three leading independent research 
organizations asked one hundred thirteen thousand, five hundred and ninety-
seven doctors: What cigarette do you smoke, Doctor? The brand named most was 
Camel.

CHANDLER: Hey, there, Mister Pipe Smoker! Do you know that more pipes smoke 
Prince Albert than any other tobacco? Well, it's true, so why don't you give 
P.A. a try? Prince Albert is especially made for smoking pleasure. It's choice 
tobacco, specially treated to insure against tongue bite -- crimp out to burn 
slow, smoke cool. See if the extra-rich, full flavor of Prince Albert doesn't 
give you added interest in your pipe! 

Be sure to listen to Prince Albert's "Grand Ole Opry" Saturday night...for a 
half hour of folk music and laughter with Red Foley, Minnie Pearl, Rod 
Brasfield and the rest of the opry gang. --------- And...as Red's special 
guest this week you'll hear...Salty Holmes. Remember...Prince Albert's "Grand 
Ole Opry"...Saturday Night...over NBC.
