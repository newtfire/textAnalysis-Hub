LOCAL ANNCR: WROW, Albany, where you get a new, exciting morning glow with 
"The Bob Kennedy Show," six to ten on Radio Fifty-Nine.

VOICE: And now -- another tale well-calculated to keep you in--

MUSIC: CHORD

VOICE: --SUSPENSE! 

ANNOUNCER: In just one minute, "Sleep Is for Children" by Ralph Bell and 
Eugene Francis.

MEREDITH: Hello, I'm Burgess Meredith. Did you know there are over three 
million persons in America who are hard-of-hearing and not doing anything 
about it? Maybe you or some member of your family is hard-of-hearing. Well, 
fortunately, I've never had this problem; some of my friends and family have. 
Now, a few years ago your excuse might have been that you didn't want to wear 
a bulky hearing aid. But today it's a different story. I've just seen the new 
Super Sixty Hearing Glasses developed by Mako Electronics. If I hadn't known 
they were hearing glasses, I would have guessed them to be regular eyeglasses. 
It's a wonderful way for any hard-of-hearing person to conceal a hearing loss. 
There are styles for both men and women. For an interesting free booklet on 
hearing glasses, for yourself or a friend, stop in at Mako or write to Hearing 
Glasses, CBS, Four-Eighty-Five Madison Avenue, New York. Don't wait until your 
hearing gets worse; it may be too late. Send for your booklet today. Write 
CBS, Four-Eighty-Five Madison Avenue, New York.

MUSIC: OMINOUS INTRODUCTION

SOUND: WINDOW GLASS SMASHED ... WINDOW SLIDES UP ... BECKLER CLIMBS THROUGH 
WINDOW INTO HOUSE BEHIND--

MRS. WORTH: (STARTLED, AFRAID) Who's there?! Is somebody there?!

SOUND: BECKLER'S STEPS TOWARD MRS. WORTH DURING FOLLOWING--

MRS. WORTH: Who is it? Answer me. Whoever it is, you'd better get out. I'm 
going to call the police.

SOUND: RECEIVER UP ... MRS. WORTH DIALS THE OPERATOR

BECKLER: Put the phone back, please.

MRS. WORTH: (STARTLED GASP)

BECKLER: Do as I say.

SOUND: RECEIVER DOWN

MRS. WORTH: Mr. Beckler--? What are <u>you</u> doing here this time of night?

BECKLER: Well, I'm not here to deliver your eggs.

MRS. WORTH: Get out of here. Get out of my house this instant or I'm going to 
call the police.

BECKLER: (CHUCKLES) I'm afraid you won't get the chance.

MRS. WORTH: What are you going to do?

BECKLER: What I did to the others.

MRS. WORTH: Others? (BEAT, REALIZES) <u>You</u> killed them.

BECKLER: That's right.

MRS. WORTH: But why? Why me?

BECKLER: Because you're all alone tonight, like they were.

SOUND: RECEIVER UP ... MRS. WORTH DIALS THE OPERATOR

BECKLER: No, you don't. 

SOUND: BECKLER FORCES THE RECEIVER DOWN AND GRABS MRS. WORTH

MRS. WORTH: (AS SHE IS STRANGLED) No! Please don't-- Please--

MUSIC: BRIDGE

NEWSCASTER: (FILTER) And for the fourth time last night the suburban town of 
Woodlake was the scene of a brutal and meaningless murder. The latest victim 
was Mrs. Leland Worth, thirty-four years old, who was found strangled in her 
living room by police late last night. All four victims have been homeowners 
in some of Woodlake's recently completed housing developments. Local 
authorities admitted today that they were still in the dark as to the identity 
of the vicious marauder. 

ELLEN: (OVERLAPS WITH ABOVE) Oh, shut that radio off, will you, Rosa?

NEWSCASTER: (FILTER) However, the search is--

SOUND: CLICK! AS RADIO IS SWITCHED OFF

ELLEN: "Local authorities still in the dark." It's just terrible. When are the 
police gonna do something?

ROSA: Well, they only got eight men on the force. Woodlake ain't like the big 
city.

ELLEN: I'm beginning to wish we were <u>back</u> in the big city. At least I felt 
safe in my apartment at night.

ROSA: Ah, now, city's no place to bring up a little girl like your Stephanie. 
Mr. Gordon workin' late again tonight?

ELLEN: Yes, it's income tax time. Busiest part of the year for an auditor.

ROSA: Well, sooner or later, they're gonna catch up with whoever's doin' these 
killin's and then everybody can relax. Oh, uh, should I fix Stephanie some 
breakfast?

ELLEN: You'd better let me see if I can coax her into opening the bathroom 
door first.

ROSA: Oh, that's a real cute trick -- lockin' herself in the bathroom every 
time she gets mad at you.

ELLEN: (IRONIC) Cute! (CALLS) Stephanie?!

SOUND: ELLEN'S STEPS TO THE STAIRS

ELLEN: (CALLS) Do you hear me up there?!

ROSA: What that child needs is to get her bottom blistered a few times. She'd 
stop her foolishness.

ELLEN: (CALLS) Stephanie?! Unlock that door and come down this minute! Do you 
hear me?

SOUND: DURING ABOVE, ELLEN'S STEPS TO PHONE ... RECEIVER UP ... ELLEN DIALS A 
NUMBER

ELLEN: (CALLS) All right, young lady, I'm calling your father!

SOUND: PHONE RINGS ONCE AND IS ANSWERED (CALLER'S PERSPECTIVE)

WALTER: (FILTER) Hello?

ELLEN: It's me, Walter. How do you feel?

WALTER: (FILTER) Exhausted, honey. I couldn't get back to sleep after those 
police sirens woke me last night. Then the bump on my head kept throbbing.

ELLEN: I'm sorry, dear. I bawled Stephanie out about leaving her roller skates 
in the hall like that. So you can just guess where she is now.

WALTER: (FILTER) Mm hm. The bathroom.

ELLEN: Yeah.

WALTER: (FILTER) I guess I'll have to take the lock off the door. Any news 
about the murder?

ELLEN: No. (EXHALES) Walter, I'm frightened about staying here alone tonight.

WALTER: (FILTER) Look, Ellen, there's nothing to worry about. I phoned the 
Woodlake police and the chief promised to have a special man patrol the entire 
project all night. Anyway, why don't you ask Rosa to stay over? Or at least 
until I get home.

STEPHANIE: Can I speak to daddy?

ELLEN: (MEASURED) Well, at last. (INTO PHONE) Walter, your daughter's finally 
come out. She wants to speak to you.

WALTER: (FILTER, CHUCKLES) Okay. Put her on.

ELLEN: Here, Stephanie. Now, don't talk too long. Daddy's awfully busy. And be 
sure to put the phone back when you're finished. I'll be in the kitchen.

SOUND: ELLEN'S STEPS AWAY

STEPHANIE: Hello, daddy!

WALTER: (FILTER) Hello, sweetie. How's my love?

STEPHANIE: I'm fine, daddy.

WALTER: (FILTER) Well, that's good. Stephanie, take it easy on your mother. 
Locking yourself in the bathroom is not a nice thing to do.

STEPHANIE: She yelled at me this morning.

WALTER: (FILTER) Well, you deserved it, honey. Daddy nearly broke his neck 
last night stepping on your roller skates.

STEPHANIE: You bent the skate.

WALTER: (FILTER) Yeah. Well, I'm sorry, but--

SOUND: DOORBELL RINGS

STEPHANIE: Oh, daddy, somebody's at the door. Goodbye!

SOUND: THUMP! OF RECEIVER PLACED ON TABLE 

WALTER: (FILTER) Oh, goodbye, Stephanie. 

SOUND: STEPHANIE'S HURRIED STEPS TO DOOR

WALTER: (FILTER) Stephanie? Hang up the phone, darling.

SOUND: DOORBELL RINGS AGAIN

WALTER: (FILTER) Stephanie?! Stephanie?!

STEPHANIE: (CALLS) I'll open it, mommy!

SOUND: FRONT DOOR OPENS

STEPHANIE: Oh, hello, Mr. Beckler.

BECKLER: Your mama home?

STEPHANIE: Uh huh.

BECKLER: Well, tell her I've brought her eggs.

STEPHANIE: (CALLS) Mommy! The egg man's here!

SOUND: ELLEN'S STEPS APPROACH

ELLEN: Well, good morning, Mr. Beckler.

BECKLER: Sorry I'm late, Miz Gordon, but I've been workin' with the police all 
morning on that Worth murder.

ELLEN: Oh, I didn't know you were on the police force.

BECKLER: Well, I ain't really. Some of us ol' residents have been deputized 
temporarily since these things started 'round here.

ELLEN: Do you have time for a cup of coffee?

BECKLER: (CHUCKLES) Never say no to coffee, Miz Gordon.

SOUND: FRONT DOOR CLOSES ... THEIR STEPS INTO KITCHEN

ELLEN: Pour a cup of coffee for Mr. Beckler, Rosa.

ROSA: (OFF) Sure.

ELLEN: (TO BECKLER) Have they any idea who did it?

BECKLER: Well, not yet. They're lookin' for a feller I told them about. I've 
seen him hangin' 'round these parts.

ROSA: Probably some delinquent from one of these new families.

BECKLER: Could be, Rosa. Could be.

ROSA: Well, you know, you was born on that chicken farm o' yours, Abel. You 
ever remember havin' trouble like this before all this here buildin' started 
and those city folks moved out here?

BECKLER: Can't remember nothin' more violent than a man beatin' his wife. Or 
vice versa.

ELLEN: (CHUCKLES)

ROSA: Oh, I tell you, some of these new people -- mighty peculiar.

BECKLER: Now, Rosa, that ain't true of everybody. You couldn't ask fer anybody 
nicer'n Miz Gordon here.

ELLEN: Well, thank you, Mr. Beckler. I just hope you catch that man soon 
before I'm a nervous wreck.

BECKLER: Oh, he ain't likely to try to break in where there's menfolks around. 
Them last three houses, the women were all alone.

ELLEN: Well, that's just it. My husband's working late these nights. He hardly 
ever gets home 'til after midnight.

BECKLER: (BEAT) I see. Well, uh, how 'bout Rosa here keepin' ya company?

ELLEN: Well, as a matter of fact, Rosa, Mr. Gordon just suggested the same 
thing.

ROSA: Oh, now, I'm sorry, Mrs. Gordon. I already promised Miz McCloskey 'cross 
the road to stay with her. Her husband's out of town.

ELLEN: Oh, dear.

BECKLER: Well, there's no need to fret, Miz Gordon. The chief just assigned me 
to patrol this area tonight. I'll be handy should ya need me.

WALTER: Hello? Hello, Stephanie? Ellen? Somebody come to the phone!

JOE: Phone still tied up, Walter?

WALTER: Yeah, doggone it.

ELLEN: (FILTER, TO BECKLER) Well, how much do I owe you for the eggs?

WALTER: (TO JOE) Wait, I hear some voices. They must be in the hall near the 
phone.

BECKLER: (FILTER, TO ELLEN) That's a dollar thirty. Sixty-five cents this 
week.

WALTER: Hello? 

BECKLER: (FILTER) Thank you, Miz Gordon. And don't worry about tonight. I'll

WALTER: Somebody come to the phone!

BECKLER: (FILTER, TO ELLEN) Goodbye. Thanks for the coffee.

WALTER: Hello? 

ELLEN: (FILTER, ANNOYED) Oh, that child! Stephanie, you did it again! You left 
the phone off the hook!

WALTER: Hello, Ellen? Hello? 

ELLEN: (FILTER, SURPRISED TO HEAR HIS VOICE) Hello? Walter, is that you? What 
are you doing?

WALTER: What am I doing? I'm trying to get my phone untied. Stephanie didn't 
hang up.

ELLEN: (FILTER) Well, why didn't <u>you</u> hang up?

WALTER: I did, five minutes ago. But that doesn't disconnect us.

ELLEN: (FILTER) It doesn't? I don't see why not.

WALTER: It's very simple, honey. The person who makes the call has to hang up. 
Otherwise the phones remain connected. I could even hear you talking to 
someone.

ELLEN: (FILTER) Oh, that was Mr. Beckler who delivers the eggs. He was telling 
me about the murder. Mrs. Worth was all alone in the house. All the people 
who've been killed were alone. I wish you'd come home early tonight, Walter. 
Rosa can't stay with me.

WALTER: Ellen, I promise ya, I'll rush. I'll get there soon as I can.

ELLEN: (FILTER) Will you keep in touch with me?

WALTER: Sure, honey, I'll phone every hour, okay?

ELLEN: (FILTER) All right, dear. Bye.

MUSIC: BRIDGE

SOUND: PHONE RINGS ... RECEIVER UP

ELLEN: Hello?

WALTER: (FILTER) Hello, darling. Everything all right?

ELLEN: Uh, yeah, I guess so.

WALTER: (FILTER) Aren't you sure?

ELLEN: Well, I keep hearing strange noises outside, but I guess that's just my 
imagination. I'll be glad when this night's over.

WALTER: (FILTER) Stephanie asleep?

ELLEN: Not quite. She's given me quite a day. I'm exhausted. Will you be much 
longer?

WALTER: (FILTER) Oh, just a couple of hours.

ELLEN: Well, call me again then, will you, dear?

WALTER: (FILTER) Sure, honey. Meanwhile, why don't you go to bed, get some 
rest?

ELLEN: All right, I'll try. I'll lie down with Stephanie. Maybe she'll go to 
sleep faster that way.

ELLEN: Oh, yes, I'd appreciate it very much.

SOUND: SLIGHT RATTLE OF ROLLER SKATES IN ROSA'S HAND

ROSA: I, uh, found Stephanie's skates out on the porch. I figured I better 
bring 'em in before Mr. Gordon falls over 'em again.

ELLEN: (CHUCKLES) Thank you. Honestly, when will she ever learn?

ROSA: Kids are all the same, I guess. I'll put 'em some place out of the way. 
Oh, you mind if I fix some coffee?

ELLEN: No, no, go right ahead. By the way, Rosa, you didn't see anybody near 
the house?

ROSA: No. Why?

ELLEN: Well, Stephanie thought she heard something outside.

ROSA: Oh, might have been me comin' up the driveway.

ELLEN: Yeah.

STEPHANIE: Aw, could I just have a glass of milk and a cookie?

ELLEN: No, it's too late.

STEPHANIE: But I'm hungry!

ELLEN: You won't starve. Now go to sleep.

ELLEN: (EVENLY) Why, Mr. Beckler? Why are you doing this? What harm have I 
done you?

BECKLER: (STARTS TO RANT) Harm? You're crowdin' me. All of you newcomers. 
Hedgin' me in. Bulldozin' the trees down. Spoilin' the land with your fancy 
new cigar-box houses. Bankruptin' us all with your taxes for schools and roads 
and such. (HAS SLOWLY CHANGED TO PHONE FILTER, FOR WALTER'S PERSPECTIVE) My 
taxes have gone up double since you city people started floodin' in here! 
That's the kind of harm you done me!

WALTER: Joe, finish that; we'll call it a night. (INTO PHONE) Hello, Ellen. 
I'm sorry-- Hello? 

BECKLER: (FILTER) Well, maybe when people like you find it ain't safe here--

ELLEN: Why <u>Rosa</u>, Mr. Beckler? She was born here in Woodlake, like yourself.

ELLEN: Stephanie, unlock the door! Hurry!

STEPHANIE: (BEHIND DOOR) No!

ELLEN: Please, Stephanie, <u>please</u>!

STEPHANIE: (BEHIND DOOR) I didn't do anything and you hit me.

FOLLOWING--

OFFICER: Mrs. Gordon? Mrs. Gordon?

ELLEN: I'm up here!

OFFICER: Oh. You all right, Mrs. Gordon?

ELLEN: Yes, yes, officer.

OFFICER: Your husband called us and we got here as soon as we could. He heard 
you and Beckler over the phone.

ELLEN: (CONFUSED) But he took the phone off, so there'd be a busy signal.

OFFICER: Ah, that's where Beckler made a mistake. The connection isn't broken  
until the calling party hangs up.

ANNOUNCER: You've been listening to "Sleep Is for Children," a story written 
for SUSPENSE by Ralph Bell and Eugene Francis. In a moment, the names of our 
players and a word about next week's story of -- SUSPENSE.

MUSIC: SQUEAKY OUT-OF-TUNE VIOLIN PLAYS A MELODY

4TH ANNCR: Are you all out of tune because you're irregular? Then help 
yourself get back in tune with Kellogg's All-Bran.

MUSIC: LOVELY IN-TUNE STRING ARRANGEMENT OF SAME MELODY

4TH ANNCR: You'll feel right on pitch when Kellogg's All-Bran goes gently to 
work. Relieves constipation due to lack of bulk by supplying your system with 
bulk-forming whole bran. Yes, a daily bowlful of Kellogg's All-Bran with milk 
helps put you right back in tune -- the natural way. The good-tasting way, 
too. Fact is, Kellogg's All-Bran is the one bran cereal that combines proved 
effectiveness with appetizing taste and crispness. It never gets mushy in 
milk. So remember, if constipation's a problem, gentle it away -- as millions 
do -- with Kellogg's All-Bran, the good food way to keep regular as clockwork. 
A-double-L -- hyphen -- B-R-A-N. Kellogg's All-Bran, at your grocer's.

MUSIC: SUSPENSE THEME ... THEN BEHIND ANNOUNCER--

ANNOUNCER: Heard in tonight's story were Elspeth Eric as Ellen Gordon, Ralph 
Bell as Walter Gordon, Bill Adams as Mr. Beckler, and Betty Garde as Rosa.

Fernandez, another tale well-calculated to keep you in--

MUSIC: CHORD

VOICE: --SUSPENSE!

Radio.
