ANNOUNCER
JOHNNY DOLLAR, hard-boiled, but human
HARDY, reserved British butler; 
STAUFFER, thoughtful chauffeur
RASMUSSEN, brusque Oklahoman
AGENT
FRANCES, Laura's drunken uncaring mother
OBERLIN, sleazy salesman

ANNOUNCER: From Hollywood, it's time now for--

SOUND: PHONE RINGS, RECEIVER UP

JOHNNY: Johnny Dollar.

HARDY: (FILTER) Er, my name is Hardy, Mr. Dollar.

JOHNNY: Yes?

HARDY: (FILTER) I'm returning the call you made to Mr. Ellis Rasmussen. If you 
will state your business, I shall be glad to transmit it to him.

JOHNNY: You tell Mr. Rasmussen I'm an insurance investigator from Hartford and 
the matter involves a member of his own family.

HARDY: (FILTER) Oh. Young Mr. Rasmussen?

JOHNNY: Yes.

HARDY: (FILTER) Er, oh. Uh, could you hold on a moment, sir?

JOHNNY: (MILDLY ANNOYED) I could.

HARDY: (FILTER, BEAT) Er, Mr. Rasmussen will send a car for you at six 
o'clock.

JOHNNY: Look, I can take a cab. It--

SOUND: PHONE DISCONNECTS (CALLER'S PERSPECTIVE)

JOHNNY: (PHILOSOPHICAL) Oh, well.

SOUND: RECEIVER DOWN

MUSIC: THEME ... THEN BEHIND ANNOUNCER--

ANNOUNCER: Bob Bailey, in the exciting adventures of the man with the action-
packed expense account -- America's fabulous freelance insurance 
investigator--

JOHNNY: Yours Truly, Johnny Dollar.

MUSIC: THEME ... BRIEF TRANSITION ... THEN BEHIND JOHNNY--

JOHNNY: Expense account, submitted by special investigator Johnny Dollar. To 
the Universal Adjustment Bureau, Hartford, Connecticut. The following is an 
account of expenses incurred during my investigation of the Rasmussen Matter.

MUSIC: UP, FOR ACCENT ... THEN BEHIND JOHNNY--

JOHNNY: Expense account, item one, two hundred and four dollars and thirty-
five cents, airfare from Hartford to San Francisco to Los Angeles, trying to 
compile the details of the Rasmussen case. I'd been on it three days when I 
was stonewalled in Los Angeles with a Holmby Hills address and the phone 
number of Ellis Rasmussen. At six o'clock, a liveried chauffeur, in immaculate 
uniform, stepped up to me at the desk.

SOUND: STAUFFER'S STEPS APPROACH

STAUFFER: Mr. Dollar?

JOHNNY: Yes?

STAUFFER: My name is Stauffer, sir. I have Mr. Rasmussen's car outside.

JOHNNY: (IMPRESSED BY THE UNIFORM) Well, gee whiz, Stauffer.

STAUFFER: (CHUCKLES WARMLY) Ain't it the truth, sir?

MUSIC: TRANSITION ... THEN IN BG--

JOHNNY: A few minutes later when we turned into the lush green Holmby Hills 
section, I had a suspicion I was about to deal with a bona fide millionaire. 
When we parked in front of the big, two-story colonial home and a man with 
graying hair and swallow-tailed coat stepped out of the door-- Well, I knew I 
was gonna meet the real article.

HARDY: I am Hardy, sir.

JOHNNY: Hello, Hardy.

HARDY: Mr. Rasmussen is waiting for you. This way, please.

MUSIC: UP, FOR A VERY BRIEF TRANSITION ... THEN BEHIND JOHNNY--

JOHNNY: We stopped in front of a huge paneled door. Hardy tapped on it once, 
then pulled on the knob. As we entered, a tall man with a shock of pure white 
hair rose from his chair and turned toward us.

HARDY: This is Mr. Dollar, Mr. Rasmussen.

RASMUSSEN: (TO HARDY) I want about four fingers of sour mash. (TO JOHNNY) What 
do you want?

JOHNNY: (CHUCKLES GOOD-NATUREDLY) Why, you took the words right out of my 
mouth, Mr. Rasmussen.

HARDY: Very good, sir.

SOUND: DOOR CLOSES, OFF, AS HARDY EXITS

JOHNNY: He's a pretty nice fella.

RASMUSSEN: We're all pretty nice fellows around here, Mr. Dollar. Sit down.

SOUND: THE TWO MEN EXHALE AS THEY SIT

JOHNNY: Thanks.

RASMUSSEN: Would you hand me that lighter?

JOHNNY: Oh, sure. Here.

RASMUSSEN: (CIGARETTE IN MOUTH) Thank you.

SOUND: LIGHTER OPENED AND IGNITED

RASMUSSEN: (PUFFS, EXHALES) What are you doing in Los Angeles?

JOHNNY: Why, Federal Underwriters of Hartford wrote a blanket policy for all 
Imperial Rubber Company employees. Your son was an executive with Imperial 
when he was killed in Malaya last spring. Federal owes his widow twenty-five 
thousand dollars.

RASMUSSEN: (UNHAPPY) I don't know where she is, Mr. Dollar.

JOHNNY: (BEAT, DISAPPOINTED) I see.

RASMUSSEN: I doubt if you do. Let me put it this way. I never met the young 
lady. Fred married her one night in Elko, Nevada. [X] Two days later, they 
were on their way to Malaya. Six months there and - the development station 
was raided by guerillas one night. And I suddenly no longer have a son.

SOUND: DOOR OPENS OFF AT [X] ABOVE AS HARDY ENTERS WITH DRINKS AND PLACES THEM 
BEFORE JOHNNY AND RASMUSSEN

RASMUSSEN: Have you eaten your dinner, Mr. Dollar?

JOHNNY: Oh, I wouldn't want to trouble you--

RASMUSSEN: Hardy, set a place for Mr. Dollar.

HARDY: Very good, sir.

SOUND: HARDY'S STEPS AWAY ... DOOR CLOSES OFF

JOHNNY: (BEAT) Well?

RASMUSSEN: (DISHEARTENED) Well, I thought she might phone me when she got back 
to the States. She never did. Never a letter; nothing. I'm old and sick, but I 
still want to see the girl my son married. It's not an easy thing to lose a 
son, Mr. Dollar. And I lost a good one. I lost the best son a man ever had.

JOHNNY: (MOVED) I'm sure you did, sir. (BEAT, A TOAST) To your son.

RASMUSSEN: To Fred.

MUSIC: NOSTALGIC ... IN AND BEHIND JOHNNY--

JOHNNY: During dinner and afterward over coffee and liqueurs, I listened to 
the story of Ellis Rasmussen's life. It came from the lips of an old man who 
was dying, but in whose eyes I could see reflected the memories of a brawling, 
bustling life that started in an Oklahoma oil field and moved to Alaska and 
Arabia and Africa. More and more during the talk I began to know his lost son 
-- for in everything the old man had to say about himself, I could sense an 
unmistakable reflection of his son. Finally, I thanked him and left.

SOUND: STEPS TO FRONT DOOR, WHICH OPENS

HARDY: If I may say so, I <u>do</u> hope you'll call soon again, sir. Mr. Rasmussen 
enjoyed your visit very much. I haven't seen him so much like his old self 
since we received the terrible news of young Mr. Rasmussen's death.

JOHNNY: He must have been quite a man, Hardy, young Fred Rasmussen.

HARDY: He was, sir. All of us miss him dreadfully. None of us ever met Mrs. 
Rasmussen, and we were most anxious to receive her -- especially after young 
Mr. Fred's death.

JOHNNY: I imagine so.

STAUFFER: (APPROACHES) The car's all ready, Mr. Dollar.

HARDY: Good night, sir.

JOHNNY: Good night, Hardy.

SOUND: FRONT DOOR CLOSES AS STAUFFER AND JOHNNY WALK TO CAR

STAUFFER: Fine night, Mr. Dollar.

JOHNNY: Yeah.

SOUND: CAR ENGINE IDLES QUIETLY

JOHNNY: Stauffer?

STAUFFER: Yes, sir?

JOHNNY: I didn't want to press the point with Mr. Rasmussen, but-- Well, maybe 
you can straighten me out. Did he approve of his son's marriage?

STAUFFER: Mmm, let's put it this way, Mr. Dollar. Mr. Rasmussen approved of 
Mr. Fred. And if Mr. Fred got himself married, then Mr. Rasmussen approved of 
the girl. Between them two, they had <u>that</u> kind of understanding. (ADMIRINGLY) 
Real people.

MUSIC: ACCENT ... THEN BEHIND JOHNNY--

JOHNNY: Expense account, item two, one dollar, ninety-eight cents -- telegram 
to Personnel Division, Imperial Rubber Company, requesting a copy of all 
information they might have on Laura Olsen Rasmussen. Item three, six dollars, 
one long distance phone call to the Universal agent working the case in San 
Francisco.

AGENT: (FILTER) Mrs. Rasmussen left the Malaya Peninsula by boat from a town 
called Khocheti three days after the news of her husband's death. A week 
later, she booked plane passage in Hong Kong with Trans-Pacific Airlines. She 
changed planes in Honolulu. She cleared the Port Authority in San Francisco. 
From there on, we lost her.

JOHNNY: Get a list of all the passengers who were on that plane.

AGENT: (FILTER) Okay.

JOHNNY: Get someone checking the hotels in the Bay Area. She might have 
checked into one when she hit Frisco.

AGENT: (FILTER) Okay.

JOHNNY: Now, listen, we're looking for a woman whose husband was brutally 
murdered about two weeks before she got back to the States. If she's anything 
like I think, she was probably about at the end of the rope. Now, start asking 
questions in places where people like that go.

AGENT: (FILTER) Right.

SOUND: RECEIVER DOWN

MUSIC: ACCENT ... THEN BEHIND JOHNNY--

JOHNNY: On Wednesday morning, I rented a car -- that's item four, twenty-five 
dollars -- and made the rounds. First stop, Los Angeles Board of Education. By 
four o'clock in the afternoon I had found thirty-five Laura Olsens who had 
attended public school in Los Angeles and were more or less in the proper age 
bracket. The next day, the folder arrived from Imperial Rubber Company. Among 
other things, it contained a passport picture and a complete description of 
Laura Olsen Rasmussen. She was a blonde girl with a pouting sultry kind of 
mouth, and wide dark eyes. 

SOUND: BUSY CITY BACKGROUND ... STREETCARS AND TRUCKS RUMBLE, CLANG, AND BANG 
NOISILY IN AND OUT ... JOHNNY'S STEPS TO APARTMENT DOOR, ON WHICH HE KNOCKS

FRANCES: (FROM WINDOW, DRUNKEN) You! You, down there!

JOHNNY: Yes?

FRANCES: (FROM WINDOW) What do you want?

JOHNNY: I'm looking for Mrs. Frances Olsen. Are you Mrs. Olsen?

FRANCES: (FROM WINDOW) I don't want to buy nothing.

JOHNNY: Do you have a daughter named Laura Olsen?

SOUND: FRANCES' STEPS DOWN STAIRS AND APARTMENT DOOR OPENS BEHIND--

FRANCES: Are you a policemen?

JOHNNY: No, I'm an insurance investigator. I'm trying to locate Laura Olsen 
Rasmussen.

FRANCES: How'd you get <u>this</u> address? What's that?

JOHNNY: A picture of her.

FRANCES: Let's see.

SOUND: SNATCHES PHOTO

FRANCES: (COLDLY) That's my Laura. What about her?

JOHNNY: I've been trying to locate her for some time. Is she here?

FRANCES: Naw. Naw, she ain't here. She ain't been here for <u>five</u> years.

JOHNNY: Do you have any idea where I can find her? Friends maybe? Other 
relatives?

FRANCES: (LAUGHS) You say her name's Rasmussen now?

JOHNNY: Yes. She married a man named Fred Rasmussen.

FRANCES: Married? Well, ain't that just something?

JOHNNY: You didn't know your daughter had been married, Mrs. Olsen?

FRANCES: (WITH CONTEMPT) How would I know? How would I know anything about 
<u>her</u>? 

MUSIC: ACCENT ... THEN BEHIND JOHNNY--

JOHNNY: Saturday at noon a registered letter arrived from the agent in San 
Francisco containing the list of pasengers who'd been on the plane with her. 
Three of the names were in the Los Angeles area, including a Mr. Oberlin who 
lived in Pasadena.

OBERLIN: Well, sure I remember her. Real pretty. We sat together all the way 
from Honolulu. (CHUCKLES) What's up?

JOHNNY: We're trying to locate her, Mr. Oberlin. Did she happen to mention her 
plans when she returned to the States?

OBERLIN: Plans? 

JOHNNY: You know, what hotel she might be staying at in San Francisco, or if 
she was going on to another city.

OBERLIN: (NO) Uh uh. (LAUGHS) Naw, naw, naw, not her.

JOHNNY: (PUZZLED) You say that very emphatically.

OBERLIN: Yeah, I guess I do. Ya didn't have to show me her picture. You know, 
a guy always prays he'll meet someone like her on a plane; ya know what I 
mean? (CHUCKLES) Yeah, live it up. Yesterday's gone, she said, tomorrow ain't 
here, and the only thing we got is today. (POINTEDLY) Yeah, we had a swell 
time.

JOHNNY: (GRIM) You're sure about this?

OBERLIN: (CONFIDENTIALLY) We were pretty chummy, pal, if you want the truth of 
it.

JOHNNY: Mr. Oberlin, did she mention anything about being in Malaya before she 
boarded that plane?

OBERLIN: (NO) Uh uh.

JOHNNY: Then she didn't tell you that her husband had been killed a week 
before?

OBERLIN: (BEAT, QUIETLY) Killed? How?

JOHNNY: He was murdered by guerillas in Malaya.

OBERLIN: (BEAT, STUNNED) No. She didn't mention that. She didn't mention that 
at all, Mr. Dollar.

MUSIC: SOBER TRANSITION

SOUND: PHONE RINGS, RECEIVER UP

JOHNNY: Johnny Dollar.

HARDY: (FILTER) This is Hardy, Mr. Dollar.

JOHNNY: How are ya, Hardy? How's Mr. Rasmussen?

HARDY: (FILTER) He's not so well, sir. That's why I called. Could you possibly 
find time to visit him?

JOHNNY: Tonight?

HARDY: (FILTER) May I send a car right away?

JOHNNY: Is it serious?

HARDY: (FILTER) He's - dying, sir.

MUSIC: MOURNFUL ACCENT ... THEN BEHIND JOHNNY--

JOHNNY: I knew why he wanted to see me. "Have you located my daughter-in-law 
yet?" "No, I haven't located her, Mr. Rasmussen. But I know something about 
her. I know she drank whiskey and flirted with a fat salesman on an airplane 
all the way from Honolulu to San Francisco. I know her mother's a drunk. I 
know she didn't think enough of you or your son to contact you or anybody else 
when she got back. Mr. Rasmussen, it looks to me like your daughter-in-law is 
a first class bum." 

MUSIC: UP, FOR FIRST ACT CURTAIN

ANNOUNCER: Act Two of YOURS TRULY, JOHNNY DOLLAR in just a moment.

Now Act Two of YOURS TRULY, JOHNNY DOLLAR and "The Rasmussen Matter."
 
MUSIC: THEME FOR SECOND ACT OVERTURE ... THEN IN BG, GENTLY OUT AT [X]

JOHNNY: There was a black coupe with "M. D." on the license parked in the 
driveway of the Rasmussen house when we pulled up. In the bedroom, a silvery 
haired man in a black suit was sitting beside the bed that held Ellis 
Rasmussen. He was introduced as Dr. Butler. Then I shook the hand of Mr. 
Rasmussen. Someone suggested that Dr. Butler might like to use the library for 
his calls.

SOUND: BEDROOM DOOR CLOSES

JOHNNY: And I was alone with the old man.

RASMUSSEN: If you want some whiskey, I keep it in the sideboard over there.

JOHNNY: Ah, not now, thanks. (HESITANT) I, er-- I wish I had some news for you 
Mr. Rasmussen. [X] We're finding out things, but we haven't found <u>her</u> yet.

RASMUSSEN: What things?

JOHNNY: (RELUCTANT) Oh, things. Nothing important.

RASMUSSEN: Dollar, if I judge you right, you know your business. And if you 
haven't found my daughter-in-law by now, you've certainly found out what kind 
of person she is. So tell me.

JOHNNY: I haven't met her; I don't know.

RASMUSSEN: You're being evasive.

JOHNNY: (TESTILY) I don't work for you, Mr. Rasmussen. I'm an insurance 
investigator trying to locate a woman and pay off a claim. If I don't find 
her, the case'll just have to sit -- unless you or someone else concerned 
makes a report to Missing Persons. (WITH A SHRUG) Then the cops can take over, 
and maybe they should right now.

RASMUSSEN: (BEAT, DELIBERATELY) My son was a fine man. I can look back on all 
the years I had with him and be proud of every year and every day. He married 
a girl named Laura Olsen. I don't know where she came from or who she was, but 
I know my son wouldn't have married her unless he loved her, unless she loved 
him in return, and was worthy of his love.

JOHNNY: (QUIETLY IRONIC) You know a lot, Mr. Rasmussen.

RASMUSSEN: (EXHALES) Perhaps I <u>should</u> go to the police.

JOHNNY: No. No, don't do that. We'll find her, Mr. Rasmussen. We're getting it 
narrowed down. (BEAT) Well, I'd better leave now.

RASMUSSEN: As you say. 

SOUND: JOHNNY'S STEPS TO BEDROOM DOOR 

RASMUSSEN: (OFF) Mr. Dollar?

JOHNNY: Yes, sir?

SOUND: BEDROOM DOOR OPENS

RASMUSSEN: (OFF, FLATLY) I want to see her.

JOHNNY: (RESIGNED) Yes, sir. (BEAT) I'm - sorry I talked to you the way I did.

SOUND: BEDROOM DOOR CLOSES ... JOHNNY'S SLOW STEPS TO HARDY

HARDY: Phone call for you, Mr. Dollar. Would you like to take it in there?

JOHNNY: (ABSENTLY) Oh, yeah, sure. (CONCERNED) Keep an eye on him, Hardy.

HARDY: Trust me, sir.

SOUND: JOHNNY'S STEPS TO DOOR, WHICH OPENS ... PHONE RECEIVER UP

JOHNNY: Johnny Dollar.

DALY: (FILTER) This is Officer Daly, Los Angeles police.

JOHNNY: Oh, yeah?

DALY: (FILTER) You the insurance guy looking for a Laura Olsen Rasmussen?

JOHNNY: Yeah, have you got anything?

DALY: (FILTER) We got her.

JOHNNY: Huh?

DALY: (FILTER) She's here with the rest of the girls in the drunk tank.

MUSIC: TRANSITION

SOUND: BACKGROUND OF MURMURING DRUNK TANK GIRLS ... MUCH ECHO ... METAL DOOR 
OPENS

JOHNNY: A drunk tank will always smell of disinfectant. This one was no 
different. There are no bunks, no chairs, no blankets, no nothing. So you 
stand or sit on a concrete floor and wait for something to happen. The legal 
period is twenty-four hours. You get rebooked or you get released; it all 
depends.

SOUND: DALY AND DOLLAR'S STEPS TO TANK DOOR, IN BG

DALY: What's the story on her, Dollar?

JOHNNY: I've got a check for twenty-five thousand dollars for her.

DALY: (IMPRESSED) Gee! Insurance money?

JOHNNY: Yeah.

SOUND: TANK DOOR OPENED ... GIRLS YELL AND WHISTLE LOUDLY

DALY: (LOUD, TO GIRLS) Quiet! Quiet in there! All right, quiet down! You girls 
better learn to get along!

SOUND: RESUME STEADY BACKGROUND OF MURMURING DRUNK TANK GIRLS

JOHNNY: (LOW, TO DALY) Which one?

DALY: Back there. Sittin' on the floor.

JOHNNY: (DISMAYED, UNDER HIS BREATH) Oh, brother. (TO DALY) What's her 
situation?

DALY: (WITH DISGUST) If somebody comes up with bail, they can have her.

MUSIC: ACCENT ... THEN BEHIND JOHNNY--

JOHNNY: Expense account, item seven, one hundred dollars, bail. While I was 
waiting around, Officer Daly broke open a file on her. A dozen aliases, a 
dozen charges, and one conviction for shoplifting. A career of petty thievery 
that began at the age of sixteen and ran up into her twenty-second year. 
Expense account, item eight, thirty-five dollars, telegrams. I sent wires to 
all parties concerned -- all parties except Ellis Rasmussen -- ordering a stop 
on their activities since Laura Olsen Rasmussen had been found.

SOUND: OFFICE DOOR CLOSES

DALY: (OFF) Over there.

SOUND: LAURA'S SLOW STEPS TO JOHNNY

LAURA: (DRUNK) Who are you?

JOHNNY: My name's Johnny Dollar.

LAURA: Thanks for getting me out. <u>Why</u>?

JOHNNY: (COOL) I did it for a friend.

LAURA: Friend? I didn't know I had any.

MUSIC: SAD ... IN AND BEHIND JOHNNY--

JOHNNY: Expense account, item nine, twenty cents, two cups of coffee. We had 
it in a diner across from the women's section of the main jail. (UNHAPPY, WITH 
A TRACE OF DISTASTE) I looked at Laura Olsen Rasmussen while she drank the 
coffee. Looked at the blonde hair and the wide eyes and the pouting mouth. 
Looked at the woman who had once been the wife of Fred Rasmussen.

MUSIC: CHANGES TO SOME INNOCUOUS JAZZ ON THE DINER JUKEBOX

SOUND: CLINK OF COFFEE CUPS

LAURA: (STILL DRUNK) What's the catch, mister?

JOHNNY: (UNFRIENDLY THROUGHOUT) No catch.

LAURA: You put up a hundred dollars for me. I don't know you from a load of 
coal.

JOHNNY: No, you don't. Where do you live?

LAURA: I've been staying at the Piedmont Hotel. You know where it is?

JOHNNY: No.

LAURA: Well, not many people do. Especially people with clean shirts.

JOHNNY: What have you been doing since you got back from Malaya?

LAURA: (CASUALLY) I've been getting along. I-- (BEAT, GUARDED) You got 
somethin' to do with Fred? You know about Malaya.

JOHNNY: I know about a lot of things. I've been looking for you for a month.

LAURA: So what?

JOHNNY: Why didn't ya contact your father-in-law when you got back?

LAURA: Why should I? Why would he care about me? He never met me. What do I 
mean to him?

JOHNNY: Right now, since he no longer has a son, you mean everything to him.

LAURA: (BEAT) You're kiddin' me, mister.

JOHNNY: I wish I <u>was</u> kidding you. I wish to Heaven I was kidding you.

LAURA: (EXHALES, UNCARING) Well, what now?

JOHNNY: (GIVES UP) Oh-- (EXHALES) I want you to come over to my hotel with 
me--

LAURA: (NO WAY) Oh, now, look--

JOHNNY: To sign some papers. I have a check for twenty-five thousand dollars 
for you.

LAURA: (DISBELIEF) What was that?

JOHNNY: Your husband was insured. You're his beneficiary. All you have to do 
is fill out an application; I'll give ya the check.

LAURA: (DELIBERATELY) I don't believe it.

JOHNNY: (WANTS TO SIGH) It's true. Come on.

MUSIC: BRIEF TRANSITION ... THEN BEHIND JOHNNY--

JOHNNY: Expense account, item ten, two dollars, cab fare, to my hotel. I took 
her upstairs with me, stood over her while she filled out the necessary 
papers. Outside of that, we didn't say a word.

SOUND: SCRIBBLE OF PEN ON PAPER ... PHONE RINGS, RECEIVER UP

JOHNNY: (INTO PHONE) Johnny Dollar.

STAUFFER: (FILTER) This is Stauffer, Mr. Dollar. Hardy asked me to phone you 
to see if there's any word.

JOHNNY: (UNHAPPY, RELUCTANT) Oh, yes.

STAUFFER: (FILTER, BEAT) Well, uh--? What'll I tell him, Mr. Dollar?

JOHNNY: Tell him - no luck yet, Stauffer. (CHANGES SUBJECT) How is--? How's 
the old man?

STAUFFER: (FILTER) 'Bout the same, sir. Counting on you, I think.

JOHNNY: I'll talk to you later.

STAUFFER: (FILTER) Yes, sir.

SOUND: RECEIVER DOWN ... RUSTLE OF PAPERS, IN AGREEMENT WITH FOLLOWING--

LAURA: (A LITTLE LESS DRUNK) Here ya are.

JOHNNY: (SLOWLY) Okay. Thanks. Here's your check.

LAURA: Anything else?

JOHNNY: Nope. That's it.

LAURA: Okay.

SOUND: LAURA'S STEPS TO HOTEL ROOM DOOR, WHICH OPENS

LAURA: (OFF) See ya around sometime.

JOHNNY: Sure.

SOUND: LAURA TAKES A STEP, THEN STOPS

LAURA: (OFF) Fred told me about a man named Stauffer who worked for his old 
man for years. Was that him on the phone just now?

JOHNNY: Yeah.

LAURA: (BEAT, UNCARING) Yeah.

SOUND: DOOR CLOSES AS LAURA EXITS

MUSIC: SAD ... IN AND BEHIND JOHNNY--

JOHNNY: I didn't know what I was gonna say to the old man, but I <u>did</u> know I 
was hoping that if Rasmussen had to die, that he'd die before anybody told him 
the kind of daughter-in-law I'd turned up. I didn't want to be in on that. 
Expense account, item eleven, eighty-three dollars, hotel bill. I checked out 
at five-thirty, picked up my airline tickets at the desk -- that's item twelve 
-- then sat around the lobby for five minutes. Item thirteen, two drinks for 
myself.

SOUND: BUSY HOTEL BAR BACKGROUND ... CLINK OF ICE IN GLASS ... LAURA'S STEPS 
APPROACH

LAURA: (VERY SOBER) Mr. Dollar?

JOHNNY: Yeah? (SURPRISED TO SEE HER) Oh.

LAURA: I read in the paper that Ellis Rasmussen is dying; is that true?

JOHNNY: That's true.

LAURA: Mind if I sit down? 

JOHNNY: Suit yourself. What are you drinking?

LAURA: Nothing. (BEAT) I know why you didn't tell him you found me and I don't 
blame you. If Fred's dad is anything like Fred was, then I know how you felt; 
finding me the way you did.

JOHNNY: Let's forget it, Mrs. Rasmussen, shall we?

LAURA: I'd like to meet Fred's father.

JOHNNY: (ANNOYED) So you want to meet him, huh? The human thing would have 
been to see him when you came back. But not a line, not a word. That old man 
in that house knows his son was really a man, and on that basis he believes, 
without seeing you, that his son married a real woman. He had love and 
sympathy and help and devotion and all the the things you don't seem to have 
any use for waiting for ya in that house. He-- (BEAT, GIVES UP, DISMISSIVE) 
Oh, never mind.

SOUND: HOTEL LOBBY BACKGROUND FADES OUT BEHIND LAURA'S MONOLOGUE

MUSIC: SNEAKS IN GENTLY BEHIND--

LAURA: (BEAT, SLOWLY) I loved Fred. Loved him from the first minute I saw him. 
Know what I was doing when I saw him? Was serving cocktails in a place like 
this. He didn't ask me what kind of a family I came from, whether I was good 
or bad. (AMUSED) He just put one of those big arms around me one night and 
said, "You're mine." (ASTONISHED) He said that to me. He said it because he 
loved me. No one ever loved me. No one. (SNIFFLES, TEARFUL) But <u>he</u> did. I told 
him who I was and where I came from and all he said was, "You're with me now." 
(PAUSE, MORE COMPOSED, SLOWLY) We - we went to Malaya together and I never 
knew in all my life what I knew then -- how it was to be wanted by someone who 
was decent and kind. And then he was killed. They told me one afternoon when I 
was in Khocheti. I took a boat and then I took a plane back here.

JOHNNY: (MOVED) Go on.

MUSIC: GENTLY OUT BEHIND--

LAURA: I went to see Fred's father. I took a car to the house, and I saw what 
kind of a house and what kind of people his family were. Didn't go in. 
Couldn't you see me -- cheap, rotten, dirty little me -- Couldn't you see me 
walking in there and saying, "I'm me"? Couldn't you see that mother of mine 
moving in? What would that have done to the old man? It would have crushed out 
his whole memory of Fred. (INHALES, BEAT) But don't think, Mr. Dollar, I 
haven't got my memory, too. I didn't drink that away. I was-- I was loved by a 
man. And I loved him back. I've still got that.

JOHNNY: (BEAT, FRIENDLY) I'm going out there pretty soon. Would you like to 
meet him?

LAURA: (BEAT, UNCONVINCED) Do you think I can?

JOHNNY: I think so. I think so very much.

SOUND: HOTEL LOBBY BACKGROUND FADES IN ... STAUFFER'S STEPS APPROACH

STAUFFER: Oh, Mr. Dollar? I've been waitin' in the lobby. I thought you might 
be here. (POLITE, TO LAURA) Uh, how do, miss?

JOHNNY: Stauffer? I'd like you to meet Mrs. Rasmussen.

STAUFFER: (DELIGHTED) Well! My, my! I'm mighty pleased to meetcha. The boss'll 
be mighty happy.

MUSIC: HOPEFUL ... THEN IN BG--

JOHNNY: She dried her eyes in the car. I didn't say much. She didn't say much. 
But in the half hour it took to get out to Holmby Hills, something happened to 
her again -- the something that must have happened when the big arm went 
around her shoulders the first time.

SOUND: FRONT DOOR OPENS

LAURA: (BRAVELY, TO HARDY) Good evening.

JOHNNY: (TO HARDY, AN INTRODUCTION) Mrs. Rasmussen, Hardy.

HARDY: How do you do, Mrs. Rasmussen? 

SOUND: JOHNNY AND LAURA'S STEPS IN ... FRONT DOOR CLOSES

MUSIC: GENTLY OUT

HARDY: We're very happy to see you.

LAURA: Thank you, Hardy. Fred spoke of you often.

HARDY: That was kind of Fred. Er, this way, please.

SOUND: THEIR STEPS TO BEDROOM DOOR ... KNOCK ON DOOR

RASMUSSEN: (FROM BEHIND DOOR) Come in, come in.

HARDY: (LOW) I think you can introduce Mrs. Rasmussen, Mr. Dollar. (MOVING 
OFF) Ring if you need me, sir.

SOUND: HARDY'S STEPS AWAY

LAURA: (EXHALES, LOW, TO JOHNNY) I'm scared.

JOHNNY: Laura, if there ever was a man for ya not to be scared of, it's that 
man in there.

LAURA: (TEARFUL) How - how can I tell him about myself? I've been in jail. I 
can't--

JOHNNY: Watch.

SOUND: BEDROOM DOOR OPENS

RASMUSSEN: (OFF) Well, Mr. Dollar, come in. I-- (STOPS SHORT AS HE SEES LAURA)

JOHNNY: I've brought someone for you to meet, Mr. Rasmussen.

RASMUSSEN: (LOW, FLAT, TO LAURA) Come here.

LAURA: (BREATHES NERVOUSLY)

SOUND: LAURA'S STEPS TO RASMUSSEN

RASMUSSEN: (CLOSER) You'd be my son's Laura. (BEAT) Yes, you're Laura.

LAURA: (TEARFUL) Hello.

RASMUSSEN: (WARMLY) Yes.

LAURA: (WEEPS)

RASMUSSEN: (REASSURING) Oh, now, there, there. Here - here. Now, look, look. 
Us Rasmussens mustn't meet like this, with tears.

LAURA: There's so much I have to tell you.

RASMUSSEN: No. There's nothing you have to tell me.

LAURA: What?

RASMUSSEN: (QUIETLY) Let me put my arm around you. (BEAT, UP) There. Now. Feel 
it? Mm hm. You're my daughter. You understand that?

LAURA: (OVERCOME, WHISPER) Yes. (UP) Oh, yes.

RASMUSSEN: Then that's all the explanations we need between us. Yes. (CALLS) 
Hardy? Hardy?!

SOUND: BEDROOM DOOR OPENS

HARDY: Er, yes, Mr. Rasmussen?

RASMUSSEN: Bring - bring Mrs. Rasmussen some brandy, I think. And I'll have 
some sour mash. (TO JOHNNY, ABOUT THE DRINK) Mr. Dollar?

JOHNNY: (AMUSED) Sure. Make mine sour mash, too, Hardy.

HARDY: (BEAMING) Very good, sir.

MUSIC: WARM ... THEN BEHIND JOHNNY, OUT GENTLY AT [X]--

JOHNNY: (CRISPLY) Expense account, item fourteen, forty bucks, miscellaneous. 
Item fifteen, thirty-five dollars, stenography. Expense account total, one 
thousand, nine hundred and sixty-five dollars. Remarks-- (CONVERSATIONAL) The 
old man's got a few weeks more. Laura's moving into the house with him to take 
care of him. She won't be telling him a lot of things about herself. She 
doesn't have to. [X] You should have stood there like I did and seen that big 
arm go around her shoulder when he said, "You're my daughter." (BEAT) Yeah. 
(CRISP AGAIN) Yours truly, Johnny Dollar.
