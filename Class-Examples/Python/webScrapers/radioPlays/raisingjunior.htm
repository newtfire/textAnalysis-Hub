RAISING JUNIOR
6:00-6:15 P.M.  November 5, 1930 Thursday
 
OPENING ANNOUNCEMENT: 
 
Raising Junior!
 
Every evening except Monday, at this hour, the Wheatena Corporation -- maker 
of Wheatena -- brings you these glimpses into the home life of Joan, Kenneth 
and Junior Lee.

One of the most important reasons for the amazing extent of undernourishment 
among school children is their habit of rushing off to school with only a 
hurried bite of breakfast. Every mother should insist that her children eat a 
well-balanced meal every morning. Food for these children is doubly important. 
Not only must it supply them with the material for strength and growth, but it 
must also carry them through a day of classroom work. We recommend this 
solution of the problem. Serve your children a bowlful of steaming, fragrant 
Wheatena each morning. Its delicious flavor will give zest to their appetites 
-- and its abundance of health and body-building elements will insure their 
proper nourishment.

Additional information on the feeding of underweight children may be found in 
"Feeding the Child from Crib to College". This little book was prepared 
especially for The Wheatena Corporation by a well-known authority on diet. 
Besides its invaluable advice on family feeding, it contains many attractive 
menus and delicious recipes. Just send your name and address to The Wheatena 
Corporation, Rahway -- R-A-H-W-A-Y -- New Jersey, and you will receive your 
complimentary copy by return mail.

And now let's go down to Greenwich Village -- the new home of Junior, Joan and 
Kenneth Lee. Yesterday, we left Joan and Ken deep in the problem of 
redecorating their new apartment -- and also celebrating Ken's bonus for his 
part in the Child Things advertising campaign.

But here comes Ken now--let's slip in before he closes the door. 

(Fade in on Joan sobbing)
 
KEN: Joanie....
 
JOAN: (Through sobs) Hello ... Kenny ... 

KEN: Why, darling ... what the matter ...

JOAN: Everything's the matter.
 
KEN: Nothing wrong with Junior is there ... ?
 
JOAN: Oh, he's healthy enough if that's what you mean... but you ought to see 
him.... 

KEN: Why ... what's wrong.... 

JOAN: Look at that floor.... 

KEN: My gosh....
 
JOAN: And that door ... and Junior looks even worse.... 

KEN: Say...who spilled that yellow paint on my nice green floor and look at 
those marks on the door....
 
JOAN: They're ... they're Junior's hand prints ... isn't it terrible.
 
KEN: It certainly is a mess ... if that's what you mean. And this place looked 
awfully nice when I left this morning. 

JOAN: Ken ... will you ever forgive us?

KEN: Us? 

JOAN: Junior ... and me. It was partly his fault.... 

KEN: His fault! I don't see how....

JOAN: No.... I guess it was all my fault because if I'd been careful it 
wouldn't have happened. (Sobs anew) Oh, Kenny ... I'm so sorry.
 
KEN: No use crying over spilt milk ... or I guess it's spilt paint this time. 
Tell me what happened.

JOAN: And you will forgive me?

KEN: Well ... maybe ... but 'fess up and tell the old man all about it.

JOAN: Well ... today I bought the cutest little chair ... it was one 
dollar.... I got it at the second-hand store around the corner.

KEN: But what's that got to do with the paint on the floor ... and on the 
door....
 
JOAN: And it's on Junior, too ... but anyway, I brought the chair home and 
cleaned it up and decided to paint it ... and I thought a yellow painted chair
would be nice in this room ... so I started to paint it yellow.
 
KEN: And you spilled paint all over the place.
 
JOAN: No ... here's how it happened. I had Junior laying on the floor on a 
blanket... and somehow or another he must have upset the paint can ... and 
when I looked around he had paint on his hands and on his face ... and it was 
running all over the floor.
 
KEN: My gosh!
 
JOAN: I guess the blanket is ruined.
 
KEN: Never mind about the blanket ... how did you get the paint off Junior?
 
JOAN: I didn't get it off ... and he looks terrible.

KEN: Why, honey ... that paint might poison him or something. 

JOAN: No ... he didn't get any in his mouth ... just on his face and ears ... 
but I did call Dr. Miller and he said to rub as much off as I could ... and 
that the rest would come off gradually....
 
KEN: Gee ... he must look funny....
 
JOAN: He doesn't look funny either ... there isn't anything funny about it. 
(Starts to cry again) 

KEN: No, honey.... I'm sorry ... it's all right... accidents will happen....
 
JOAN: Oh, I don't care about the paint being spilled ... but my nice lovely 
baby ... all smeared up with yellow paint.... 

KEN: Say.... How did he get it on the door? 

JOAN: I was sort of holding him in front of me when I took him in to his room 
... oh, he was just dripping ... with paint ... and he must have touched the 
door.
 
KEN: Say ... Joan did you notice ... he left a perfect print of his hands on 
the door.
 
JOAN: Did he ... you'll have to paint it over, I guess.
 
KEN: Paint it over! I should say not ... it's on Junior's door. I mean the 
door to his room, isn't it?

JOAN: Yes....
 
KEN: I think they look cute ... the print of baby hands, ... why, Joan it's 
kind of Poetic ... those yellow hand prints on that brown door look very 
artistic too.... 

JOAN: I never thought of it that way....
 
KEN: And another thing ... those hand prints will remind our guests that 
Junior is just in the next room and they won't get too noisy or anything.
 
JOAN: I think you're awfully sweet ... to be so nice about it.... 

KEN: Oh, Honey... forget about it... now come here ... and give me a big hug 
... and a kiss ... and I'll forgive you completely.
 
JOAN: All right, daddy ... (Pause) .... Oh, Kenny ... you are awfully good to 
me. What would you like specially for supper tonight? 

KEN: I was just thinking about that.... 

JOAN: Oh, you were, were you!
 
KEN: I mean on my way home ... how about waffles?

JOAN: All right ... waffles it will be!
 
KEN: I thought I was going to take it easy tonight ... but I guess I'll have 
to work on that floor.
 
JOAN: I got some paint remover, Ken... the man at the paint shop said if you 
used the remover you might not have to repaint the whole floor....
 
KEN: I'll fix it up ... and Joan ... we can throw a scatter rug over the place 
where the paint was spilled ... gee ... Joanie ... it isn't nearly as bad as 
you thought it was ... and those hand prints are the cutest things I ever 
saw.... 

JOAN: I guess I was just naturally upset ... and spilling the paint was the 
final touch....
 
KEN: Why, Honey ... what else happened? 

JOAN: It was that woman. 

KEN: What woman?
 
JOAN: That woman across the street... let's see ... her name is Tonina.
 
KEN: Tonina? Tonina what!
 
JOAN: Oh, she says she doesn't use a last name ... that Tonina fits her soul 
personality.
 
KEN: What does she do?
 
JOAN: Well, she doesn't do her housework ... I know that much. She says she's 
a musician.... 

KEN: Piano?
 
JOAN: Yes ... she's the one we heard playing so loudly last night. 

KEN: Yeah.... I was afraid she'd wake up Junior ... well, she may be a 
musician but a few lessons wouldn't hurt her any. 

JOAN: Oh, that's music in the ... now what did she call it ... oh yes ... 
music in the mood of tomorrow. It's quite modern stuff I guess.
 
KEN: So modern I never heard anything like it before ... but Joan when did you 
meet her....
 
JOAN: Today ... she came in to see me.... 

KEN: She smokes doesn't she? 

JOAN: Yes ... how did you know.
 
KEN: I'll bet she was out of cigarettes and came over to borrow some.
 
JOAN: Why ... yes ... how did you know all that? 

KEN: Oh, I'm learning the social customs of Bohemia ... she and Tony Pendennis 
ought to make a good pair.
 
JOAN: Well, anyway ... she chatted a while and then asked me to bring Junior 
over to her place ... she was conducting some experiments in primitive rhythms 
and their effect on infants. 

KEN: Say listen ... you be careful about taking Junior around and letting 
these people try out their funny music on him ... it might affect his whole 
life.
 
JOAN: She didn't play loudly ... and Junior didn't seem to mind it. 

KEN: He's a smart baby.... I'll bet he didn't even listen. 

JOAN: And then we had quite a long conversation. 

KEN: About art.
 
JOAN: No about careers for women. 

KEN: Unh-uh.... Listen, Joan ... don't you take this Village talk too 
seriously ... you don't need a career... you've got one ... as a wife and 
mother.  
 
JOAN: And then the talk veered around to children and how to raise them. Ken 
... we're all wrong in our methods of raising Junior ... that is from 
Greenwich Village standards.

KEN: Who says so? 

JOAN: Tonia said so....
 
KEN: What does she know about it? Has she any kids?
 
JOAN: Not this year.
 
KEN: Not this year ... say ... what does she mean not this year. 

JOAN: Well, as far as I can gather she believes in having children and raising 
them for a year and then shipping them out to her family....
 
KEN: What does her husband say about that?
 
JOAN: I don't imagine he has very much to say ... she impressed me as being a 
woman who did most of the talking in the family. 

KEN: Joanie ... I think you ought to be careful about the friends you pick up 
down here.
 
JOAN: Why, Ken ... I think the people in the Village are fascinating.
 
KEN: Maybe ... but some of them are crazy, too. 

JOAN: But you yourself told me the most interesting people in New York live 
down here.
 
KEN: Yes ... but some of them aren't much good.... 

JOAN: I was quite taken with Tonina.
 
KEN: I suppose next you'll want to ship Junior up to your mother's for good.
 
JOAN: Why Kenny!
 
KEN: Well, I tell you I won't stand it ... why ... I'll.... 

JOAN: (starts to sob) You're mean ... and unjust ... and.... 

KEN: Listen Joanie ... Junior stays here.
 
JOAN: Ken ... you're terrible ... even to think I'd send Junior away.... I've 
never given you any reason to think anything like that.
 
KEN: But ... gee ... the way you were talking ... I thought you were taking 
that fool woman's ideas seriously.... 

JOAN: You--you're virtually accusing me of wanting to desert Junior....
 
KEN: Now Joanie...you know I wouldn't do anything like that.
 
JOAN: (Letting up on sobs) Well, it sounded that way.

KEN: But you know I didn't mean it.
 
JOAN: Haven't I always taken good care of Junior....

KEN: Yes.
 
JOAN: And I didn't want to send him up to mother's when we moved but it was 
the best thing for him ... you ... well ... you don't just appreciate what a 
good mother I am. 

KEN: I do, too....
 
JOAN: I'm careful with his food ... and I wash all his clothes ... and stay 
home and take care of him.
 
KEN: I know honey... I'm not saying that you aren't a good mother.
 
JOAN: Yes you did, Kenneth Lee ... and you said I was probably planning to 
send him away.... (sobs some more) 

KEN: Now Joanie ... you got me all wrong....

JOAN: I guess I heard you.
 
KEN: Now sweetheart ... please listen just a moment. 

JOAN: Well?
 
KEN: You said that she said.... 

JOAN: Who said.
 
KEN: Her.... I mean that Tonina woman ... anyway you were saying that she was 
saying ... that is she said that she believed in sending children away from 
home right after they were a year or so old.
 
JOAN: Yes ... and it's a horrible idea ... and I'm not going to do it.
 
KEN: I know ... I know ... but what I was trying to explain.... 

JOAN: Well, what are you trying to explain?

KEN: Now let's see ... where was I...
 
JOAN: You were trying to explain that you didn't accuse me of wanting to go 
away and leave Junior....
 
KEN: That's right ... well when you said that she said.... 

JOAN: Kenny ... don't start that all over again.... 

KEN: Joan ... it's simply this.... I thought you were taking her seriously.... 
I mean I thought you might think there was something in the idea of sending 
Junior away.... 

JOAN: Why ... I don't see how you got that impression. 

KEN: Well, you said.... I mean you seemed to think she was interesting...
 
JOAN: Maybe she is interesting ... but she's wrong just the same.
 
KEN: Sure she is.
 
JOAN: That's what I said all the time. And you accused me of wanting to send 
Junior to my mother's.

KEN: Joanie ... I didn't. 

JOAN: Well, you inferred it.
 
KEN: Honey.... I didn't mean it that way... what I really meant to infer was 
that you'd never do anything like that ... and you wouldn't would you? 

JOAN: Of course I wouldn't.... 

KEN: And you'll forgive me?
 
JOAN: Yes ... but don't ever do it again. 

KEN: Do what again?
 
JOAN: Even hint that I might want to send Junior away ... even for a few 
days.... I never want to send him away ... and I just told you I didn't send 
him away because I wanted to when we moved ... it was because it was best for 
him. 

KEN: Yes, darling.... I'm sorry....
 
JOAN: Anyway ... it's all right now.... I'm sorry I acted up so I'm just 
nervous and tired I guess ... and Ken ... after supper you'll have to fix 
Junior's carriage. 

KEN: What's the matter with it?
 
JOAN: One of the wheels is stuck.... I couldn't use it today ... so I carried 
Junior when I went shopping.... 

KEN: Oh, you poor kid ... no wonder you're tired. 

JOAN: He doesn't seem heavy ... but he gets heavier with every block I found 
out....(chuckles) I thought he must be growing every minute.
 
KEN: He is ... but not that fast....
 
JOAN: Daddy, don't you hate me when I get quarrelsome and cry and act like I'm 
a baby myself? 

KEN: Course I don't....
 
JOAN: You understand me, don't you.... 

KEN: Sure I do....
 
JOAN: And you know I really love you, don't you?

KEN: I hope so....
 
JOAN: Because I do ... only sometimes when things seem to go wrong ... and I 
meet people who say things I don't agree with ... and I'm tired out ... oh, I 
had such a big washing to do today too.... well, I just behave terribly I 
guess. 

KEN: No ... dear.... I can understand ... moving and fixing this place up and 
everything has been an awful strain on you.... 

JOAN: Can I come over and sit in your lap a minute ... before I cook your 
supper? 

KEN: You don't see any no parking signs do you? 

JOAN: Here I come....
 
KEN: Gosh ... seems like I have two children sometimes.
 
JOAN: I guess you have, daddy. 

KEN: Feel better now, Honey? 

JOAN: Uh-huh. (Pause) Listen! 

KEN: What is it?
 
JOAN: I thought I heard Junior.... I guess he went to sleep though.
 
KEN: I sort of got cheated out of Junior tonight, didn't I? 

JOAN: I'm sorry ... but he must have been sleepy because when I put him in his 
crib after trying to get some of that paint off he dropped off to sleep.
 
KEN: I'll slip in and see him later ... he'll wake up for his bottle won't he?
 
JOAN: Yes ... he's sure to do that ... he's just like his daddy and never 
misses a meal ... but Kenny... would you mind waiting just a little while for 
your dinner....

KEN: No ... you rest for a while ... I can wait. 

JOAN: Because I want to hear a new radio program that starts tonight. What 
time is it?
 
KEN: Let's see ... about six thirteen. 

JOAN: Gosh ... it goes on at six fifteen.... 

KEN: What's the program.... 

JOAN: It won't interest you.... 

KEN: Why not?
 
JOAN: But it does interest me.... I'm going to listen every week....

KEN: What's the name of it?

JOAN: The name of it ... why it's ... How to make your Husband Happy.
 
CLOSING ANNOUNCEMENT:
   But Joan hardly needs to listen to a program on that subject -- for, in 
spite of the little storms that sometimes sweep over the Lee household, Ken 
seems to be about as happy and contented as husbands can be--and, all reports 
to the contrary, there are some mighty happy husbands in this broad land.

Especially those who get cooperation in starting the day off right. It's a tax 
on any husband's good nature to come home happy in the evening when he's gone 
out cheerless in the morning. That's why Ken gets his bowlful of Wheatena at 
every breakfast. And that's one reason why we urge you to try this delicious 
cereal at your morning meal. Just ask your grocer for the familiar yellow and 
blue package. These programs come to you at this hour every night except 
Monday through the courtesy of the maker of Wheatena.... WH-EAT-E-NA ... the 
delicious sun-browned wheat cereal that millions of children and grown ups 
welcome so eagerly every morning. Good night.

Raising Junior has come to you from the New York Studios of the National 
Broadcasting Company.
