FOREWORD

Starting Monday evening, September 30, the Empire Builder series of radio 
programs, sponsored by the Great Northern Railway, will again be on the air 
for a nine months' period. This season they will be broadcast over the coast 
to coast chain of 25 stations that comprise the Blue Network of the National 
Broadcasting Company. The time of the broadcast and a list of the stations 
participating appear on the back cover of this leaflet.

The first program of this series deals with the Pacific Northwest generally 
and its industrial possibilities. Its principal scene is laid in the 
Directors' Room of a large Eastern manufacturing company. This company has 
grown until it is necessary that they have additional facilities and a 
directors' meeting has been called to decide where their branch factory shall 
be built.

At their meeting Tom Baldwin, a young business man, explains the many 
advantages of the Pacific Northwest and the story closes with him and his 
bride traveling westward on the Empire Builder to supervise the construction 
of the company's new factory.

In planning the Empire Builder series of radio programs, of which this is a 
typical example, the Great Northern Railway is again using the radio to 
broadcast over the entire United States the resources and attractions of the 
Northwest. Believing that manufacturers and shippers, particularly in the 
West, will have more than just a casual interest in this first program of the 
Empire Builder series, the Great Northern has had a quantity of these 
published. If you desire extra copies, write to A. J. Dickinson, Passenger 
Traffic Manager, Great Northern Railway, St. Paul, Minnesota.

<b>The Westward Tide</b>
A Story of the Pacific Northwest
by
Edward Hale Bierstadt and Harold M. Sims
____________

A New York Cabaret.

[<i>The opening scene is laid in one of the better known New York Cabarets. The 
orchestra is playing a modern jazz piece and the happy voices of the dancers 
are heard over the microphone. This gradually fades out.</i>]

ALICE--Oh, Tom! If your directors <i>knew</i> the West you wouldn't <i>have</i> to fight.

TOM--Alice!

ALICE--Yes, Tom?

TOM--Suppose we go ahead and get married now, and take a chance on the outcome 
of the meeting tomorrow?

ALICE-- You know we can't do that, Tom, and you know why. Father is all I've 
got in the world, and I'm all he's got. He can't live back here and I can't 
leave him all alone.

TOM--Darn it! The thing that gets me is that quite aside from any personal 
considerations the new plant <i>ought</i> to be built in the West.

[<i>The orchestra music and restaurant noises again come in story.</i>]

VOICE--Ladies and gentlemen, may I have quiet for a moment?

[<i>The orchestra music and restaurant noises die out.</i>]

VOICE--The next number on our program this evening is a specialty act. 

Ladies and gentlemen, here they are.

[<i>Applause.</i>]

ALICE--Oh, they <i>are</i> good! I'm so glad we came.

TOM--Well, I'm all set to be entertained.

[<i>A cabaret specialty number now occupies the center of the stage. At the close 
of their song the patrons applaud.</i>]

[5]

ALICE--They're just as good as I thought they were.......Oh dear! I can't move 
father East, and if you don't win tomorrow we'll just have to wait.

TOM--No, Alice. We've waited long enough already. I'm going to fight this out 
to a finish. If Dad were here he'd say, "Go to it, Son!" One of the last bits 
of advice Dad gave me was: "Son, watch the Pacific Northwest! That country's 
on the cross-roads of tomorrow." Well, the tomorrow is here and the son is 
going West. That's that!

ALICE--Oh, Tom! You're wonderful. And that's just the spirit that's making the 
West what it is--and what it's going to be!

[<i>Now the orchestra is heard as a background for the dialogue.</i>]

ALICE--I don't want to be boring about it, but isn't there anybody on your 
board of directors who feels as you do?

TOM--Yes, as a matter of fact, there are several. There's one man in 
particular that I'm counting on tomorrow.

ALICE--Who is he?

TOM--He's an old friend of Dad's, and he knows the West and knows it from A to 
Z. He knew it way back in the early days. It's old Edwards who is really 
making all the trouble.

ALICE--Mr. Edwards' being, of course, a dyed-in-the-wool Easterner?

TOM--Dyed-in-the-wool? Dyed-in-provincialism! He's so much of an Easterner 
that he thinks the sun rises in the Atlantic Ocean and sets in the Hudson 
River!

ALICE--Dear me! That does sound rather--rather fixed.

TOM--I'll say he's fixed! He's "sot" in his ways, Edwards is.

ALICE--Well, Tommy dear, you just do your best to make him come unstuck 
tomorrow. Oh, Tom, just think what it means to us!

[6]

TOM--You darling!

[<i>Now the music of the orchestra swells up again. A piece is completed and the 
music dies out. The rapping of a gavel on a table announces the opening of the 
second act which is laid in the Directors' Room of a large Eastern 
manufacturing corporation.</i>]

VOICE--Now gentlemen, come to order please! As you all know, this meeting of 
the directors has been called to make a decision as to whether we shall build 
a plant on the Pacific Coast.

EDWARDS--I'm against it! Now and all the time, I'm against it! The real - - -

VOICE--Just one moment, Mr. Edwards. Let's hear from Mr. Baldwin first. He's 
the - - - 

EDWARDS--Baldwin has personal reasons for wanting - - - 

TOM--That's quite true. I have a personal interest, but I can assure you, 
gentlemen, that it has nothing to do with my conviction that we should build a 
plant in the Pacific Northwest--that <i>this</i> is justified by lower initial costs, 
lower manufacturing costs and the improved product which will result from 
manufacturing under milder climatic conditions.....The East is no longer the 
natural center of American wealth and business.

EDWARDS-- What? Do you mean to tell me that Wall Street has moved?

TOM--Wall Street, no! But <i>commerce</i> and <i>capital</i> have moved steadily westward 
since the dawn of history. The manufacturing center of the United States, once 
in the New England states, has already shifted into the Mississippi Valley. 
The Pacific Coast is only beginning to develop its natural wealth. It is the 
last frontier in the westward march of commerce and capital.

EDWARDS--Baldwin seems to be pretty well fed up on - - -

TOM--I'm fed up on <i>facts</i> that mean <i>dollars</i> and <i>cents</i> to you, Mr. Edwards, as 
well as to the rest of us. The Pacific coast states are nearest the Orient, 
South America, Australia,

[7]

Alaska, Siberia and India. These regions comprise two-thirds the population of 
the world as well as the greatest wealth of undeveloped natural resources.

EDWARDS--Foreign markets, eh? I was waiting for that. Europe is <i>our</i> heaviest 
buyer.

TOM--True. But we are finding it increasingly difficult to meet competition in 
Europe. And we are not alone. American industries must look for their greatest 
expansion in the markets of the Oriental countries and the Latin Americas. 
There we can compete with Europe. Already American manufacturers are 
recognizing this fact and getting established on the West coast.

EDWARDS--You're dreaming. Industry is <i>here.</i> Iron and steel are here; labor is 
here; long experience and efficiency are here.

TOM--You don't know the West. I can show you plant after plant that is 
operating at less cost than similar plants here--many of them producing a 
better product. Labor can live more cheaply--and get more out of life while 
working. The climate, mountains, fishing, hunting - - - 

EDWARDS--We're not building this plant for the enjoyment of our workmen!

TOM--No, and <i>you</i> don't have the labor problems to wrestle with. <i>I</i> do. I know 
the difference that living conditions make in turn-over and efficiency . . . . 
I was about to call your attention to the fact that there is not one essential 
thing that the West coast has not got in abundance!

EDWARDS--Yes, there is!

TOM--What is it?

EDWARDS--Population!

TOM--But the population's coming. Right today the cities on the West coast are 
the fastest growing cities in the country. It's because industry generally is 
awakening to the advantages I've pointed out--and because power is cheaper 
than anywhere else in the country. A third of all the potential water power

[8]

in the United States is to be found in the two states of Washington and 
Oregon. These and the other coast states are rich in natural resources. 
Timber. Minerals. Vast areas adapted to agriculture, stock-raising, 
horticulture, etc. The day is coming--and soon--when these resources are going 
to be manufactured into finished articles right there in the Northwest. That 
will mean industries, payrolls and population.

VOICES--Hear, hear, that sounds like straight talk. (Ad lib.)

EDWARDS--This is all too much in the future! The real point is that <i>this</i> is 
where the money is <i>now!</i>

PIONEER--Shucks! There's always money in the West. Always has been. Ever since 
the days when you could pick it up off the ground.

[<i>General laugh.</i>]

EDWARDS--You think that just because you live there!

PIONEER--I <i>know</i> it because I've lived there so long. My land! I call to mind 
when I first went West, back in the early days, money was so plentiful my eyes 
just popped out of my head. You can take it from me that there isn't any less 
now than there was then.

VOICE--What was that story you used to tell about the first money you ever 
earned out there?

PIONEER--Let's see! Oh, I know what you mean! Why that was the second day I 
was on the West coast. Came out across Panama, I did. Well, I was a-standing 
in the street wondering where I was a-going to get a job, and listening to 
some music that was comin' out from a dance hall near by.

[<i>The Pioneer is in a reminiscent mood and the sound of early Western music 
announces the transition of the scene to the place of his tale.</i>]

VOICE--Lookythere, youngster. There's John A. McGlynn!

PIONEER--Who's he?

VOICE--Don't know who John McGlynn is? When did you get here?

[9]

PIONEER--Just last night.

VOICE--Oh! Well, John has the only American wagon in town. Brought it out from 
New York in pieces, and put it together himself. Broke four wild California 
mules to drag her. He's a wonder!

PIONEER--I'm going to speak to him. Hey there! Hey! Mr. McGlynn!

McGLYNN--Now there, young man, don't be bringing all that mud into this wagon! 
With freight at twenty dollars a ton, you've lugged about thirty dollars worth 
of mud in here, you young hippopotamus! These ain't no safe movers, these 
mules!

[<i>The mules bray.</i>]

McGLYNN--Yep, you heard me!

PIONEER-- I want a job, Mr. McGlynn, just for today. I may go out to the mines 
tomorrow.

McGLYNN--You want a job, do ye now?

PIONEER--Can you give me one?

McGLYNN--I can, mebbe. Do you understand the inner aspirations of mules?

PIONEER--I was brought up on a farm.

McGLYNN--And the principles of elementary navigation by dead reckoning?

PIONEER--What was that?

McGLYNN--I mean mud holes. Can ye keep out of them?

PIONEER--I can try.

McGLYNN--All right. Take the reins. You're hired. At six o'clock I'll find you 
and pay you off. You get twenty-five dollars.

PIONEER--<i>How</i> much?

[10]

McGLYNN--Twenty-five dollars for the day, and I tell you straight you're a 
fool to be workin' for it.

PIONEER--It sounds big to me.

McGLYNN--It wont when ye've been out here a week. Now, I'm telling you if you 
bog them mules down I'll skin you alive, big as you are.

JUDGE--What's all this, John?

McGLYNN--Is it yourself, Judge Girvin? I'm just telling this young man that he 
can't have the job of driving my little California canaries for but one day, 
because I've hired a fine lawyer from the East at two hundred and fifty a 
month to drive my mules for me.

JUDGE--You have done well, John. It is the whole business of a lawyer to know 
how to manage mules and jackasses so as to make them pay!

[<i>All laugh--the sound of dance hall music rising to full strength and then 
fading out indicates a lapse of several hours.</i>]

PIONEER--[<i>Chuckles</i>] Well, along about five or six o'clock I drove my mules up 
to the post office and, sure enough, there was McGlynn. (Short pause)

PIONEER--Whoa there, mules! Whoa, whoa!

[<i>The rattle of the wagon and of trace chains. Creaking. The sound of hooves in 
the heavy mud. Then the bray of mules as they stop.</i>]

McGLYNN--Well, bub, you seem to be ship-shape so far. Take care of the mules 
all right, did you?

PIONEER--I fixed 'em.

McGLYNN--How many times did you get stuck in the mud?

PIONEER-- Not once.

McGLYNN--What do you think of that now! Well, I'll admit you're a judgematical 
young man, and if you want a job I'll let that lawyer go. [<i>Laughs</i>] No? Well, 
you're right. A man's a fool to work for anybody but himself out here.

[11]

Where's your bag? Haven't got any? How do you carry your dust? I forgot. 
You're a tenderfoot of course. Wait a minute. Here's a gold slug for you.

PIONEER--Is it worth twenty-five dollars?

McGLYNN--It's about a fifty dollar slug. You can get it weighed. Give me the 
change next time you see me.

PIONEER--But I may leave for the mines tomorrow.

McGLYNN--Then leave the change for me at the El Dorado saloon.

PIONEER--How do you know I'll leave it?

McGLYNN--I don't. If you need twenty-five dollars more than you do a decent 
conscience, John A. McGlynn isn't the man to deny you!

[<i>A bit of dance hall music rising to full strength and then fading out 
announces the transition of the story back to the scene in the Directors' 
Room.</i>]

PIONEER--[<i>Chuckles</i>] Well, that's the way I earned my first money out there, 
and I've been earning it there ever since. And that's the way the people are 
out there too, like John A. McGlynn, open-handed, friendly an' honest. They're 
good to do business with. There isn't so much wear and tear. 'Clare to 
goodness, back here a man's got to keep his mind on his wallet the whole time!

[<i>General Laugh</i>]

TOM--Well, gentlemen, that about expresses the way I feel about it myself. I 
hope you will vote for our western expansion.

EDWARDS--I'm against it! You needn't hope for my vote now or any other time.

TOM--Very well then. I'm afraid there's only one answer to that . . . .

[<i>The sound of feet retreating. The click of a key in a lock. The steps 
return.</i>]

[12]

TOM--Now, Mr. Edwards and gentlemen, the door is locked, and the key is in my 
pocket. I am convinced that the place for our new plant is on the West coast. 
If I cannot have the unanimous support of you gentlemen, I want my resignation 
accepted before this meeting adjourns.

EDWARDS--This is an outrage! How dare you detain us by force! Unlock that door 
or I'll have the law on you!

VOICES--By George, the young man has a way with him! What do you think of that 
for nerve? I'm for him! I think he's right!

(Ad lib.)

PIONEER--[<i>Chuckles</i>] Dog my cats, the boy has enough back bone for two men! 
Well, gentlemen, I don't aim to stay in this room all day, an' I'm too old to 
fight my way out. I take it that our friend, Mr. Edwards here, represents the 
only opposition an', that bein' so, let's make him a proposition.

EDWARDS--Well, what is it?

PIONEER--We'll buy out your interest in this concern, Mr. Edwards. Not only 
that, but we'll give you a check right now. How about it?

EDWARDS--Well--well--I don't know about that. Do you mean to say that you 
gentlemen believe in this Western venture strongly enough to buy my holdings?

PIONEER--I certainly do. I think all of us do. I want you to sell, but I warn 
you--you'll be sorry if you do!

EDWARDS--Hum! I may be at that. Hum. No, by jingo, I won't sell, and if you're 
determined to be fools and build in the West, I'll be a fool along with you!

[<i>General laugh</i>]

VOICE--Let's bring it to a vote. All in favor of building our new plant on the 
West coast, please signify in the usual manner.

VOICES--Aye!

VOICE--Contrary minded?

[13]

EDWARDS--Just a little, Mr. Chairman, just a little [<i>Laugh</i>].

[<i>The music of an orchestra comes in here. It swells and then fades and the hum 
and subdued roar of a train, with occasional whistles, takes its place. This 
is heard from inside the train and indicates the change of the scene from the 
Directors' Room to the sun parlor observation car of the Empire Builder.</i>]

ALICE--It hardly seems true, does it, Tom?

TOM--What, dear?

ALICE--Why, that we're--married.

TOM--It's the truest thing I know!

ALICE--And here we are, as big as you please in the observation car of the 
most beautiful train I've ever seen.

TOM--I wonder why they call it The Empire Builder. Unusual name for a train, 
isn't it?

ALICE--Oh, your pioneer friend told me that. It was like this. The Northwest 
cities wanted a fast transcontinental train--sort of thought it would help 
them along a bit. So a few months ago the Great Northern put on this fast 
train. And just to do the thing up right, it gave them the <i>finest</i> train that 
was ever put on rails--everything new from engines to observation cars. The 
happy thought occurred to someone that it would be appropriate to name the 
train after Jim Hill who founded the Great Northern and who was known 
everywhere as The Empire Builder because he did so much towards building up 
the Northwest.

TOM--[<i>Ruminating</i>] Empire Builder. Edwards accused me of mixing sentiment and 
business. Seems there's sentiment in railroading too.

ALICE--And you kind of like it, don't you, dear? But I've only told you half 
of it. Every car in this train is named for for some man who played a part in 
building this great Western Empire.

[14]

TOM-- It's something to be proud of all right.

ALICE--Well, you can be just as proud as any of them. You're building it too. 
You're bringing your business out here, and that's what makes it an empire!

TOM--Hum! That is certainly pleasant to the ear.

PORTER--Excuse it, please, suh. Ah jest thought you an' your lady would like 
to know that we is jest comin' into Glacier Park.

TOM--Thank you, Porter. Yes, we're glad to know it.

PORTER--This place is comin' to be just like Niagara Falls used to be, suh! 
Yes, suh, it is! He, He!

ALICE--Oh, Tom, do you suppose we'll ever live down being a bride and groom?

TOM--I don't want to. Being a groom is the pleasantest thing I've tackled yet! 
. . . . Hello! Here's our friend back.

PIONEER--Well, you two children, here you are, eh? Takin' a look at the 
scenery? I tell you, it sure looks good to an old timer like me. And this 
road's certainly got the scenery.

TOM--If it weren't for you, we wouldn't be looking at it.

ALICE--You're a regular fairy God-father.

PIONEER--Shucks! I believe in the West. I <i>know</i> it's good. When I can bring a 
sound business proposition out here it's good for the business an' it's good 
for the West. An' anything that's good for the West is good for me! . . . . 
Say, I tell you this is travelin! this is. You're sure a guest the minute you 
get on one of these Great Northern trains and they don't let you forget it. 
Even the men up in the engine make you realize it the way they handle the 
trains. Most as smooth as your own living room--

TOM--I'll bet these trains cost a pretty penny.

PIONEER--Luxury like this takes a lot of mighty costly machinery and 
equipment--but it wouldn't amount to much

[15]

if a few thousand human beings who run these trains weren't taking a lot of 
pride in their work and their railway.

ALICE--Which is where sentiment and business mix again!

PIONEER--I'd say <i>you</i> ought to know, Alice . . . . Speaking of sentiment, why 
not have some music? Ought to be able to pick up Spokane from here. I'll try.

[<i>Static</i>] Oh, Good Gracious!

ALICE--Here, let me try.

[<i>She tunes in on an N B C program and a bit of the same cabaret act that they 
heard in New York comes over the radio.</i>]

ALICE--There! Why it's the same act we heard that night we were dining 
together--the night before the directors' meeting.

PIONEER--Well, we can jest sit back now an' listen to the music and look at 
the scenery. By golly, old Horace Greely was sure right!

TOM--I'll take your word for it, but what was he right about?

PIONEER--He was right when he said--Go West, young man, go West!

ALICE--Yes, and he'd have been righter if he'd told the young men to be sure 
to take wives with them!

[<i>Laughs. The music of the New York cabaret swells to full strength and then 
fades out.</i>]
