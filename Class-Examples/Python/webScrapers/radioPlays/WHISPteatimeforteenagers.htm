WHISPERER: (STARTS LOW, THEN INCREASINGLY LOUD) The Whisperer - The Whisperer 
- The Whisperer - <u>The</u> <u>Whisperer</u>!

MUSIC: CREEPY ACCENT

SOUND: PHONE RINGS AND IS ANSWERED (CALLER'S PERSPECTIVE)

SCARELLI: (FILTER) Yeah?

WHISPERER: Scarelli?

SCARELLI: (FILTER) Yeah? What are my instructions?

WHISPERER: The Syndicate has decided to introduce the widespread use of 
marijuana into Central City.

SCARELLI: (FILTER) It's a cinch. How rough can I get?

WHISPERER: We are not interested in methods, only results.

SCARELLI: (FILTER) You'll get 'em.

WHISPERER: One month from today, we will expect two hundred regular marijuana 
addicts among the high school students.

MUSIC: ACCENT ... THEN IN BG

ANNOUNCER: Presenting "The Whisperer," starring Carleton Young! 

MUSIC: ACCENT ... THEN BEHIND ANNOUNCER--

ANNOUNCER: The Whisperer, a brilliant man who, losing his voice in an accident 
which crushed his vocal cords, worked his way deep within the Crime Syndicate 
to help destroy it from within. To the underworld, his familiar rattling hiss 
is the voice of authority, to be obeyed without question. Then a miracle of 
surgery performed by Dr. Benjamin Lee restored his natural voice, enabling him 
to resume his real identity. Now, as Philip Gault, brilliant young attorney, 
he skirts the thin edges of death, living his dual role -- for as The 
Whisperer he sets in motion the forces of the Syndicate in Central City, then 
as Philip Gault, uses his knowledge to fight the organized network of crime 
which seeks to control the fate of millions in cities and towns across the 
nation. (BEAT, CONFIDENTIALLY) The only person besides Dr. Lee who knows The 
Whisperer's true identity is the doctor's nurse, Ellen Norris, who is 
listening now as The Whisperer completes his call to his superiors in the 
Crime Syndicate in New York City.

NEW YORK: (FILTER) New York.

WHISPERER: Central City reporting. Instructions conveyed to Scarelli. Will 
keep you informed.

SOUND: RECEIVER DOWN

ELLEN: (MILDLY HORRIFIED) Oh, Phil! Did you <u>have</u> to give those instructions?

PHIL: Yes, Ellen. As soon as I receive them from my superiors in the Syndicate 
I must pass them on.

ELLEN: But marijuana means broken lives. Heartbreak for parents, too.

PHIL: I know that, Ellen, but if I refuse, the Syndicate will liquidate me 
before the day is over.

ELLEN: How will Scarelli start this - this tragedy?

PHIL: Well, he'll find a high school boy or girl who's a leader and induce 
them to start selling marijuana.

ELLEN: But couldn't we warn the P.T.A.?

PHIL: No. We must let Scarelli make his contact, then catch him and his men 
with enough evidence to send 'em to prison.

ELLEN: Meanwhile, some boy or girl becomes an addict.

PHIL: They won't work that way. They'll set up a party, spike the drinks, and 
when everyone is happy, they'll pass out one or two or as many cigarettes as 
it takes to get them high.

ELLEN: How terrible.

PHIL: But until that party we needn't worry about whoever Scarelli contacts.

ELLEN: Well, that makes me feel somewhat better.

PHIL: (LIGHTLY) Say, uh, how 'bout leaving the office and having a soda, huh?

ELLEN: Mmm, can't. However, if you should just happen-- Well, <u>just</u> happen, 
mind you, to come back around four--?

PHIL: (PLEASED) Mmm, I'll be here with bells on.

SOUND: PHIL'S STEPS TO STREET DOOR WHICH OPENS ... STREET DOOR'S BELLS JANGLE

ELLEN: That won't be necessary. As you see, we furnish our own bells.

PHIL: (LAUGHS)

SOUND: STREET DOOR CLOSES ... BELLS JANGLE

MUSIC: TRANSITION ... THEN BEHIND ANNOUNCER--

ANNOUNCER: Meanwhile, Scarelli -- smartly dressed and spending freely -- mixes 
and mingles with the high school crowd -- watching, listening for something 
which will point out a likely student to become his head marijuana pusher. 
Then--

SOUND: SODA SHOP BACKGROUND

SCARELLI: They tell me you're pretty good on that motorcycle, Scrappy.

SCRAPPY: Huh? Oh, yeah. Guess I am, at that.

SCARELLI: My name is Scarelli.

SCRAPPY: I'm Scrappy Riss.

SCARELLI: I've got a pretty hot car myself.

NOLA: (TO SCRAPPY, A GREETING) Hiya, mope!

SCRAPPY: (IMPRESSED) Hey, look at you.

SOUND: WOLF WHISTLES FROM THE SODA SHOP BOYS

NOLA: (IGNORES THEM) Hiya, Scrappy.

SCRAPPY: Hiya, Nola! Conservin' sweaters or want a goo?

NOLA: You conserve; I'm starved. (CALLS) Hey, Mike?!

MIKE: (OFF) Yeah?

NOLA: Feed that Pete [Brownie?] record a nickel, will ya?

MIKE: (OFF) Sure!

NOLA: He really sends me.

SCRAPPY: Come down, come down!

NOLA: I'm sent.

MUSIC: BOOGIE WOOGIE PIANO ON THE JUKEBOX ... IN BG

SCRAPPY: Hey, my bike's outside. How 'bout a spin, huh?

NOLA: Sorry, Jimmy Bivens is pickin' me up.

SCRAPPY: (DISMISSIVE) Ahhh, that moldy fig. Then how 'bout tonight?

NOLA: Jimmy Bivens.

SCRAPPY: (PLEADS) I kinda counted on it.

NOLA: You overlooked one thing.

SCRAPPY: That convertible?

NOLA: (SURE!) George!

SCRAPPY: I didn't overlook it; I ignored it.

NOLA: Your mistake. 

SOUND: NOLA SLURPS THE LAST OF HER SODA THROUGH STRAW

NOLA: (EXHALES) Never overlook a convertible. Bye! Thanks for the goo!

SOUND: DURING ABOVE, NOLA'S CHAIR SCRAPES ... HER STEPS AWAY

SCRAPPY: (CALLS AFTER HER) What's the rush?

NOLA: (SLIGHTLY OFF) Well, there's Jimmy pullin' up outside.

SOUND: JIMMY'S CAR PULLS UP OUTSIDE

NOLA: (SLIGHTLY OFF, TO SCRAPPY) Don't take any wooden Kefauvers! (BEAT, OFF) 
Okay, Jimmy!

SOUND: CAR ENGINE REVS AND ROCKETS AWAY, TIRES SQUEALING

SCARELLI: (CHUCKLES) That's really burnin' it, huh?

SCRAPPY: Huh? Oh, you again. Yeah, Jimmy got a Merc Three Hundred with 
trimmin's.

SCARELLI: Oh? How much did that job cost?

SCRAPPY: Fifteen hundred.

SCARELLI: (POINTEDLY) I know where a hard worker could make that kind of 
money.

SCRAPPY: It don't grow on bushes, friend.

SCARELLI: The name's Scarelli. How 'bout droppin' in tonight and we'll - talk 
it over, huh?

SCRAPPY: Where?

SCARELLI: Maine Hotel, Room Twelve-Oh-One. Eight o'clock?

SCRAPPY: (BEAT) I'll be there.

MUSIC: BRIEF OMINOUS TRANSITION

SOUND: PHIL'S CAR PULLS TO A STOP ... CAR DOORS OPEN AND CLOSE, THEN PHIL AND 
ELLEN'S STEPS TO DOOR, DURING FOLLOWING--

ELLEN: Would you mind telling me why you brought me all the way across town to 
"The Hangout" for that soda?

PHIL: I love your company.

ELLEN: <u>That</u> I sometimes doubt. No, you had some other reason.

PHIL: Well, Ellen, if I were Scarelli, I'd hang around, ask questions, spot a 
likely pusher, and then make contact.

SOUND: HANGOUT DOOR OPENS ... PHIL AND ELLEN'S STEPS IN

ELLEN: And you're gonna see if Scarelli has been here?

PHIL: You're a woman of unusual perception.

SOUND: HANGOUT DOOR CLOSES ... PHIL AND ELLEN'S STEPS TO TABLE BEHIND--

PHIL: Um, park it here -- as we used to say in my high school days.

SOUND: CHAIRS SCRAPE AS THEY SIT 

ELLEN: Well, twenty-three skidoo to you, too.

PHIL: (CHUCKLES)

MIKE: Name it, mopes.

ELLEN: Mopes?

MIKE: Okay, "squares."

ELLEN: Oh, <u>that</u> I get.

MIKE: Well, don't lug it. What goos?

PHIL: Goos?

MIKE: Goos. What do you want?

PHIL: Oh.

ELLEN: I've had conversations like this in nightmares.

PHIL: Look, uh, could we just talk to you?

MIKE: Jive. Dig.

ELLEN: Huh?

PHIL: (AMUSED EXHALATION) Would you humor an old man and just use plain 
English?

ELLEN: You <u>do</u> speak it?

MIKE: When I hafta.

PHIL: Splendid; we've found a ground for mutual understanding. Uh, has an 
older man, probably well-dressed--?

MIKE: A gook.

PHIL: Uh, I'll start over. Has a gook been asking--?

MIKE: Waxing.

PHIL: Okay, has a gook been waxing a--? Don't tell me. Mope?

MIKE: (YES) George.

ELLEN: Who?

MIKE: Scrappy Riss. The gook's waxin' him about a hot rod.

PHIL: Oh, now I see.

ELLEN: Wanna bet?

PHIL: (LOW, LIGHTLY) Don't expose me. (TO MIKE) Uh, where does Scrappy live?

MIKE: Eight Thirty-Four Canal Street.

SOUND: CHAIR SCRAPES AS PHIL AND ELLEN RISE BEHIND--

ELLEN: Octagon.

MIKE: Huh?

ELLEN: I said, <u>octagon</u>. That means "thanks from two squares." (CHUCKLES)

PHIL: (CHUCKLES)

MUSIC: TRANSITION

SOUND: KNOCK ON DOOR, WHICH OPENS ... CITY TRAFFIC BACKGROUND

MRS. RISS: Yes?

PHIL: Uh, we'd like to talk to Scrappy, please.

MRS. RISS: Oh, dear, he isn't in trouble again?

PHIL: Oh, no, Mrs. Riss. I'm a lawyer and I wanted to talk with him about 
working for me in my office.

MRS. RISS: Oh. Well, come in, Mister, er--?

PHIL: Gault. And this is Miss Norris.

MRS. RISS: Oh, how do you do? 

ELLEN: How do you do?

SOUND: DURING ABOVE, PHIL AND ELLEN'S STEPS IN ... DOOR CLOSES, TRAFFIC OUT

MRS. RISS: I wanted Scrappy to go to work. It isn't that he's a bad boy. It's 
just that he wants so many things and sometimes takes shortcuts to get them. 
(CALLS) Oh, Scrappy?!

SOUND: INNER DOOR OPENS, OFF

SCRAPPY: (APPROACHES) I heard what he said, ma.

MRS. RISS: Son, I want you to meet--

SCRAPPY: (INTERRUPTS, TO PHIL) How much would the job pay?

PHIL: Well, I could start you at twenty a week.

SCRAPPY: (SCOFFS) Chicken feed! I know where I can get-- (STOPS SHORT)

PHIL: More? Is that what you were going to say?

SCRAPPY: (LOW) Let it go.

PHIL: Scrappy, easy money usually means risks -- the risk of getting caught.

MRS. RISS: (WORRIED) Oh, son, what are you talking--?

SCRAPPY: (BLUNT) I don't know what he's talkin' about.

PHIL: And I hope you never will, Scrappy, but I'm a lawyer -- and if you ever 
need help, consider yourself my client.

SOUND: PHIL AND ELLEN'S STEPS TO DOOR IN BG--

PHIL: Good evening, Mrs. Riss; Scrappy.

ELLEN: Goodbye.

MRS. RISS: Goodbye.

SOUND: DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES AS PHIL AND ELLEN EXIT ... CITY TRAFFIC 
BACKGROUND ... THEIR STEPS ON SIDEWALK

ELLEN: Shouldn't you have warned Scrappy?

PHIL: No. I think he's basically a good kid, but a poor actor. If I warned 
him, his behavior might put Scarelli on his guard.

ELLEN: Can't we follow Scrappy? Let him lead us to Scarelli?

PHIL: Look there.

ELLEN: What do you mean? The motorcycle?

PHIL: Yeah. How long do you think we could keep up with that? No, Ellen. When 
the time comes, we'll find another way of contacting Scarelli. Now, come on. I 
have to make a call to the Syndicate.

MUSIC: TRANSITION

SOUND: PHONE RINGS AND IS ANSWERED (CALLER'S PERSPECTIVE)

NEW YORK: (FILTER) New York.

WHISPERER: Central City reporting.

NEW YORK: (FILTER) Go ahead, Central City.

WHISPERER: Scarelli has found a good high school contact. He's in love and his 
rival owns a hot rod.

NEW YORK: (FILTER) Keep us informed.

SOUND: PHONE DISCONNECTS (CALLER'S PERSPECTIVE) ... RECEIVER DOWN

ELLEN: Phil? Every time you use that voice it gives me goosebumps.

PHIL: (CHUCKLES) That whisper was the only sound I could make when I first met 
you.

ELLEN: I know, but I'll never get used to it. Oh, by the way, somehow we've 
been sidetracked on that soda. Could we--?

PHIL: Later. Right now we have a date to park in front of Scrappy Riss' house 
until he returns from his meeting with Scarelli.

ELLEN: But that may be hours!

PHIL: Well, parking can be <u>fun</u> -- if it's properly approached.

ELLEN: Oh, no, mope. I may lag in modern idioms, but some things haven't 
changed since I left high school. 

MUSIC: TRANSITION

SOUND: SCARELLI'S FRONT DOOR OPENS ... SCARELLI'S STEPS IN

ED: Where ya been, Scarelli?

SCARELLI: Setting up a pigeon.

SOUND: FRONT DOOR CLOSES

SCARELLI: He's ripe. A tough kid in love and he wants a hot rod.

ED: Ah, sounds like he's already hooked.

SCARELLI: Yeah, I'm countin' on that. But kids are funny, so--

ED: So I stand by downstairs just in case, huh?

SCARELLI: Yeah, just in case.

SOUND: KNOCK ON FRONT DOOR, OFF

SCARELLI: That's probably him. Out the back way and hurry.

ED: Gotcha.

SOUND: ED'S STEPS TO BACK DOOR, WHICH OPENS AND CLOSES AS HE EXITS ... ANOTHER 
KNOCK ON FRONT DOOR, OFF

SCARELLI: (CALLS) Be right with ya!

SOUND: SCARELLI'S STEPS TO FRONT DOOR, WHICH OPENS 

SCARELLI: Well, come in, Scrappy. You're right on time.

SOUND: SCRAPPY'S STEPS IN ... DOOR CLOSES ... SCRAPPY AND SCARELLI'S STEPS 
INTO THE HOTEL ROOM BEHIND--

SCRAPPY: (IMPRESSED) Hey! This joint's the real McCoy.

SCARELLI: Thirty dollars a day, Scrappy. Always travel first class; it's the 
only way to live.

SCRAPPY: If ya have the money.

SCARELLI: The right guy always has the money.

SCRAPPY: And you think that's me, huh?

SCARELLI: I do. I've been watching you, Scrappy. You're smart, you're tough, 
and you're a leader. Here, have a cigarette.

SCRAPPY: Thanks. (BEAT) Hey -- what kinda cigarette is this?

SCARELLI: (BEAT, SIMPLY) Marijuana.

SCRAPPY: (BEAT) What's the idea? Ya tryin' to make a' addict of me?

SCARELLI: (CHUCKLES) At one time, Scrappy, they arrested ya for drinking 
whiskey. But now we're more enlightened and whiskey is offered for legal sale. 
In ten years the same will be true of marijuana.

SOUND: SCRAPPY STARTS BRIEFLY FOR THE DOOR BEHIND--

SCRAPPY: I think I'll go now, Mr. Scarelli.

SCARELLI: (CHUCKLES) Scrappy, I like you. How would you like to make two 
hundred dollars a week?

SCRAPPY: (STUNNED) Two hundred bucks a week?

SCARELLI: At least.

SCRAPPY: My old man never made that much.

SCARELLI: But <u>you</u> can. We organize ten groups of twenty friends. Each stick 
costs fifty cents. At first, your customers will average three a week. That's 
six hundred dollars a week.

SCRAPPY: (SKEPTICAL) Yeah, and ten percent of six hundred's still sixty.

SCARELLI: Only at first. Once they get the habit, why--

SCRAPPY: You can stop right there.

SOUND: SCRAPPY STARTS BRIEFLY FOR THE DOOR

SCARELLI: (CHUCKLES) That's merely a figure of speech. Later they'll enjoy 
maybe three a day and that nets twenty-one hundred dollars a week, or two-ten 
for you.

SCRAPPY: Aw, no. For this, I'll not go to jail.

SOUND: SCRAPPY STARTS FOR FRONT DOOR AND OPENS IT

SCARELLI: (STERN) Just a minute.

SCRAPPY: (DEFIANT) You intend to try to stop me?

SCARELLI: (BEAT, CHUCKLES, VERY FRIENDLY) No, of course not, son. Course not. 
Come on, I'll give you time to think it over.

SOUND: THEIR FOOTSTEPS THROUGH FRONT DOOR AND DOWN A FEW STEPS  TO OUTDOORS 
... CITY TRAFFIC BACKGROUND

SCARELLI: Now, just to show you there's no hard feelings, Scrappy, I'll give 
ya a drive in my car. Here it is.

SCRAPPY: (IMPRESSED, WOLF WHISTLE) 

SCARELLI: Do you like it?

SCRAPPY: Who wouldn't?

SCARELLI: Cost twenty thousand. British job; Three-Sixty-Two. Slip under the 
wheel, twirl it around the block.

SCRAPPY: Hey, you really mean it?

SCARELLI: Of course I do.

SOUND: CAR DOORS OPEN 

SCARELLI: Get in and I'll brief you, and then you can burn the rubber.

MUSIC: BRIEF TRANSITION

SOUND: SPEEDING LUXURY CAR INTERIOR BACKGROUND

SCRAPPY: Hey, this baby really turns over!

SCARELLI: Yeah. Do a power turn around that corner by my hotel.

SCRAPPY: Okay! Here goes!

SOUND: TIRES SQUEAL AS CAR TURNS CORNER

SCRAPPY: (DURING ABOVE, LAUGHS WITH DELIGHT)

SCARELLI: Good boy! You can really drive. Hey! Hey, look out! Look out!

ED: (BLOODCURDLING DEATH SCREAM)

MUSIC: BRIEF GRIM TRANSITION

SOUND: SCARELLI'S STEPS APPROACH

SCRAPPY: (DISTRAUGHT) Is he?

SCARELLI: Yes, son. He's dead.

SCRAPPY: (TEARFUL) Oh, what am I gonna do?

SCARELLI: Well, if I report this, ya get twenty years.

SCRAPPY: But it was an accident!

SCARELLI: That's why I'm gonna help ya. Now, help me put his body in the trunk 
and I'll get rid of it where they'll never find it.

SCRAPPY: But then I'd get <u>you</u> in trouble.

SCARELLI: I'll take that risk -- provided you'll be my head pusher.

SCRAPPY: You mean marijuana? But I already told ya--!

SCARELLI: Either that or twenty years. Which will it be? (NO ANSWER) Hurry!

SCRAPPY: (RESIGNED, SULLEN) All right. I'll sell your marijuana.

MUSIC: FIRST ACT CURTAIN

ANNOUNCER: You are listening to "The Whisperer," the story of Philip Gault, 
the man who walks on the thin edge of death as he lives a double identity!

MUSIC: SECOND ACT INTRO

ANNOUNCER: Philip Gault, known to the underworld as The Whisperer, has ordered 
the introduction of marijuana into the high school. Now in his real identity 
as Philip Gault, he and Ellen are parked outside Scrappy's house when an 
imported car drives up.

SOUND: LUXURY CAR PULLS UP AND STOPS, OFF ... CAR DOOR OPENS AND SCRAPPY GETS 
OUT DURING FOLLOWING--

ELLEN: It's Scrappy, all right.

PHIL: I've never seen that car before.

ELLEN: It's bound to be Scarelli's.

PHIL: No doubt about it.

SOUND: LUXURY CAR DRIVES AWAY

ELLEN: Hadn't we better follow him?

PHIL: I think it's more important to talk to Scrappy.

SOUND: PHIL AND ELLEN'S HURRIED STEPS TO SCRAPPY

PHIL: (CALLS) Scrappy?!

SCRAPPY: (NERVOUS, OFF) Huh? What? Who's there?

ELLEN: It's Mr. Gault and--

SCRAPPY: (OFF) I don't wanna talk to you!

PHIL: Are you in trouble?

SCRAPPY: (OFF) No! No. Why should I be?

PHIL: Well, just remember what I said earlier today about being your friend. 
Let me know if you get in over your head.

SCRAPPY: (OFF, DARK LAUGH) <u>Get</u> in! That's a laugh! (TEARFUL) I'm already in 
ten times deeper than that!

SOUND: SCRAPPY'S RUNNING STEPS AWAY

ELLEN: Something dreadful has happened tonight. You should have stopped it.

PHIL: That was my first mistake, Ellen. My second was in not following 
Scarelli. Now we've <u>got</u> to find him if it takes all night.

MUSIC: TRANSITION

SOUND: PHIL'S CAR PULLS TO A STOP ... CAR DOORS OPEN AND CLOSE, THEN PHIL AND 
ELLEN'S STEPS TO DINER DOOR, DURING FOLLOWING-- 

MUSIC: ELEGANT ... DRIFTS IN FROM NEARBY DINER ... GROWS LOUDER WHEN THEY 
ENTER

PHIL: (DISCOURAGED) Oh, well, that's that. We've checked every motel, garage, 
and hotel in town. That foreign car's disappeared.

ELLEN: Could we stop for a "goo" before you drop me off at my place?

PHIL: (CHUCKLES) Of course. Uh, come on, mope.

ELLEN: Mmm, that all-night diner looks wonderful to me.

SOUND: DINER DOOR OPENS

PHIL: In you go.

SOUND: THEIR STEPS IN ... DINER DOOR CLOSES ... THEIR STEPS TO COUNTER

PHIL: (TO COUNTERMAN) Uh, two hamburgers with everything.

ELLEN: Did we overlook anyplace where Scarelli might have--?

PHIL: (CAUTIONS, LOW) Ellen! No names.

ELLEN: I'm sorry.

SCARELLI: (APPROACHES) Pardon me. With my girth, I need more room to pass.

PHIL: Oh, I'm sorry.

SCARELLI: (CHUCKLES) Thank you very much.

SOUND: SCARELLI'S BRISK STEPS TO PHONE ... PHIL AND ELLEN'S VOICES START TO 
FADE AS WE FOLLOW SCARELLI TO PHONE BOOTH

ELLEN: (LOW) Phil! I've seen him.

PHIL: Who?

ELLEN: That man going to the phones. He was just-- (FADES OUT)

SOUND: SCARELLI'S STEPS INTO PHONE BOOTH ... BOOTH DOOR CLOSES, SHUTTING OUT 
<u>MUSIC</u> ... COIN DROPS, PHONE DIALED ... PHONE RINGS AND IS ANSWERED (CALLER'S 
PERSPECTIVE)

SCRAPPY: (FILTER) Hello?

SCARELLI: Why, Scrappy -- awake at three-fifteen?

SCRAPPY: (FILTER) What do <u>you</u> want?

SCARELLI: Man named Gault is searching for my car. It's hidden at the casino, 
but if he finds it, those fingerprints will hang ya.

SCRAPPY: (FILTER) But, Mr. Scarelli--!

SCARELLI: You must get rid of Gault.

SCRAPPY: (FILTER) (LOW, HORRIFIED) Nooo!

SCARELLI: I'll be at your house by three twenty-five. Be ready.

SCRAPPY: (FILTER) But I--

SCARELLI: They can't hang you any higher for two murders than for one.

MUSIC: TRANSITION

SOUND: PHIL'S CAR INTERIOR BACKGROUND

ELLEN: The goo was delicious.

PHIL: Oh, in that case, do you mind if I stop and pick up something at my 
place?

ELLEN: Mmm? Oh, my, no. I'm used to joyriding at three-thirty in the morning.

PHIL: (CHUCKLES)

SOUND: PHIL'S CAR PULLS TO A STOP

PHIL: I'll only be a moment.

SOUND: GUNSHOT! 

ELLEN: (ALARMED) Phil!

PHIL: Keep down!

SCARELLI: (OFF, TO SCRAPPY) Shoot! Shoot again!

SCRAPPY: (OFF, TEARFUL) Noooo! No, leave me alone!

SOUND: SCRAPPY'S RUNNING FOOTSTEPS TO PHIL AS SCARELLI'S CAR REVS UP AND 
ROCKETS AWAY

ELLEN: He's getting away.

PHIL: Scarelli is, yes; but Scrappy shot at me.

SCRAPPY: (APPROACHES) Mr. Gault?!

PHIL: Yes?

SCRAPPY: (TEARFUL) I'm sorry!

PHIL: Come on inside, kid. We've a lot to talk over.

MUSIC: TRANSITION

SCRAPPY: And that's the story, Mr. Gault.

PHIL: So Scarelli's staying at the Maine Hotel.

ELLEN: Phil, what are you gonna do?

PHIL: Scrappy, we have a job to do. Can you regain his confidence?

SCRAPPY: I'll try.

PHIL: His next move will be to set up a party where he'll pass out marijuana. 
Can you learn the time and place, and phone me?

SCRAPPY: Yes, sir. But - but what happens when this is over?

PHIL: Then, Scrappy, it looks as though you'll have to stand trial for 
manslaughter. Now, I think you'd better go home.

MUSIC: TRANSITION

ANNOUNCER: After Scrappy leaves, Philip Gault dials the Maine Hotel.

SOUND: PHONE RINGS (CALLER'S PERSPECTIVE) ... IN BG

ANNOUNCER: As the receiver at the other end is lifted--

WHISPERER: When?

WHISPERER: Just now? (BEAT) Thank you.

SOUND: RECEIVER DOWN ... THEN UP AGAIN, AND PHONE DIALED, IN BG--

ELLEN: He's checked out?

PHIL: Ten minutes ago. That means he knows we've talked to Scrappy.

ELLEN: Who are you calling?

PHIL: Scrappy's mother. He must stay at home until I can get there. His life 
depends on it.

MUSIC: TRANSITION

SOUND: SCRAPPY'S WALKING FOOTSTEPS ON SIDEWALK ... OUT WITH--

SCARELLI: Welcome home, Scrappy.

SCRAPPY: (STARTLED) Huh?

SCARELLI: You bungled it.

SCRAPPY: Yeah, I know it.

SCARELLI: Did Gault see ya tonight?

SCRAPPY: (UNCONVINCING) Oh, uh, no.

SCARELLI: (SEEMINGLY CONVINCED) All right. Tomorrow night we're giving a party 
at the casino for twenty of your friends.

SCRAPPY: I'll tell 'em tomorrow.

SCARELLI: (SHARPLY) You'll call 'em -- with my gun in your ribs.

SCRAPPY: Huh?

SCARELLI: When you finish, you'll be locked in the refrigerator vault.

SCRAPPY: (SCARED) Why're ya doin' this?

SCARELLI: I saw ya come out of Gault's place. (BEAT, OMINOUS) Scrappy, your 
number is <u>really</u> up.

MUSIC: TRANSITION

SOUND: DOOR CLOSES ... PHIL'S STEPS IN

ELLEN: Did you find him?

PHIL: Aw, I've looked all day without a trace. But I did learn that Scarelli's 
giving a party tonight for teenagers at the casino.

ELLEN: The casino?

PHIL: My guess is that Scrappy's a prisoner there.

ELLEN: What time <u>is</u> the party?

PHIL: It's already underway. I'm going out now and try to rescue Scrappy. 
Ellen, phone Lieutenant Danvers. Tell him to surround the casino. When I fire 
two shots, have his men crash in. Now, you got that?

ELLEN: Two shots. Right.

PHIL: Good girl. It must be timed right. Too soon, no evidence. Too late, a 
lot of fine kids'll be headed for a place I'd rather they didn't go.

MUSIC: TRANSITION

SOUND: PHIL'S CAR PULLS TO A STOP ... CAR DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES AS PHIL CLIMBS 
OUT

MUSIC: BAND PLAYS A PARTY TUNE, WHICH DRIFTS IN FROM THE CASINO, IN BG

SCARELLI: Oh, good evening, Mr. Gault. I've been waiting for more than an 
hour.

PHIL: Sorry if I've kept you waiting, Scarelli.

SCARELLI: I'll take your gun. 

SOUND: GUN TAKEN

SCARELLI: Thank you. Come on.

SOUND: THEIR FOOTSTEPS INTO CASINO AND FADE IN MURMUR OF PARTYING TEENAGERS, 
DURING FOLLOWING--

SCARELLI: As you can hear, my party is in progress.

PHIL: So it would seem.

SOUND: REFRIGERATOR VAULT DOOR UNLOCKED 

SCARELLI: In here.

SOUND: VAULT DOOR OPENED ... THEIR STEPS INTO VAULT

PHIL: Hmm. Very substantial.

SCARELLI: It's the meat storage vault. However, the walls are thin enough that 
you can hear the happenings. And later-- Well, we'll discuss that later. Now, 
if you'll excuse me, my guests are waiting.

SOUND: SCARELLI'S STEPS OUT ... VAULT DOOR CLOSED AND LOCKED

SCRAPPY: Mr. Gault?

PHIL: You all right, Scrappy?

SCRAPPY: I'm half frozen. I was afraid you wouldn't get here in time.

PHIL: Has he passed out any marijuana?

SCRAPPY: No, but he's gettin' ready to.

MUSIC: BAND STOPS PLAYING ... A BRIEF FANFARE ON THE PIANO TO GET THE TEENS' 
ATTENTION

SCRAPPY: Hey, listen.

SCARELLI: (OFF) Are you kids having fun?!

TEENS: (MURMUR AGREEMENT)

SCARELLI: (OFF) All right then, I've got something you're gonna <u>really</u> go for! 
Everybody step up and get a free cigarette!

TEENS: (MURMUR ENTHUSIASTICALLY)

SCARELLI: (OFF, IN BG, OVERLAPS SEMI-DECIPHERABLY WITH SCRAPPY AND PHIL'S 
DIALOGUE BELOW) Come on up! And if you like 'em, there's plenty more where 
these came from! I like you kids and I like to see kids have a good time. (AD 
LIB, ET CETERA) Come on up now! That's the idea! They'll make you feel like a 
million dollars! (CONTINUES AD LIB, UNTIL FAKE GUNSHOTS BELOW)

SCRAPPY: Oh, no! We gotta do somethin'! Those kids don't know what's about to 
happen!

PHIL: The police may be here by now.

SCRAPPY: Police? Ya got a signal?

PHIL: Two gunshots.

SCRAPPY: Where ya gonna get a gun?

PHIL: Move this empty cardboard carton over there while I break this window 
with this chicken.

SCRAPPY: Chicken?

PHIL: It's frozen. Hard as a hammer.

SOUND: CRASH! OF BREAKING GLASS

SCRAPPY: Here's the carton. What now?

PHIL: Your belt.

SCRAPPY: (WITH EFFORT AS HE REMOVES BELT) All right, but why?

PHIL: I'll double it. Now stand back. I heard they do this on the radio; I 
hope it wasn't just publicity.

SOUND: TWO HARD WHACKS OF DOUBLED BELT ON CARDBOARD BOX, WHICH SOUNDS ALMOST 
LIKE TWO GUNSHOTS ... POLICE WHISTLES! ... IN BG, SCARELLI STARTS AD LIB 
YELLING ("Give me that cigarette! You! Give me that! All right, come on! Give 
me that one! Come on!") AT TEENS, WHO PANIC

PHIL: It worked!

SCRAPPY: Yahoo!

ELLEN: (CALLS, FROM OFF) Phil?! Where are you?!

PHIL: (CALLS) Over here in the refrigerator!

ELLEN: Refrigerator?

PHIL: Open the door! Scarelli must be [stopped]!

SOUND: VAULT DOOR UNLOCKED AND OPENED ... PHIL AND SCRAPPY'S STEPS OUT OF 
VAULT 

PHIL: (TO ELLEN) Thanks. Stay back.

SOUND: PHIL AND SCRAPPY'S HURRIED STEPS TO CASINO INNER DOOR, WHICH OPENS 

SCARELLI: (STILL YELLING AT PANICKING TEENS) All right, you kids, stuff those 
cigarettes in the fireplace! Move now! I'll shoot the first one who tells 
where they got one!

ELLEN: He's getting rid of the evidence.

SCARELLI: (TO A TEEN) You, over there! Move!

PHIL: Scarelli!

SCARELLI: What?

PHIL: Drop that gun!

SCARELLI: Gault!

PHIL: Drop it, Scarelli!

SOUND: ACTUAL GUNSHOT! ... TEENS SCREAM BRIEFLY IN PANIC ... ANOTHER GUNSHOT! 
... TEENS GROW QUIET AND SCARELLI'S BODY THUDS TO THE FLOOR BEHIND--

SCARELLI: (GRUNTS AND DEATH GROAN)

PHIL: All right, everybody! It's all over! The police will be here and 
they'll--

SOUND: CASINO DOOR BURSTS OPEN ... POLICE ENTER BEHIND--

DANVERS: --take over.

ELLEN: Lieutenant!

DANVERS: Well, well, well, this <u>is</u> a haul! Outside, we grab the drivers and 
the mary-juana; and inside, we find Philip Gault, boy murderer.

PHIL: That man has narcotics on his body and he shot first, lieutenant.

DANVERS: You wish!

PHIL: I have thirty witnesses to prove it.

DANVERS: We'll pass that for now. How'd you know about this unless you're 
implicated in the marijuana business?

PHIL: My client, Scrappy Riss, told me.

DANVERS: Oh? That right, Scrappy?

SCRAPPY: Yes, sir.

DANVERS: Then you must be implicated in this, too.

SCRAPPY: No, sir, I--

PHIL: My client is innocent of any wrong intent. He was coerced.

SCRAPPY: (BURSTS INTO TEARS) It's no use, Mr. Gault! I can't take it any 
longer! I killed a man! (WEEPS BRIEFLY, IN BG)

DANVERS: (SORROW, NOT ANGER) Ohhh. In that case, Scrappy, you're under arrest.

PHIL: Lieutenant, before you do a foolish thing, can we see the prisoners?

DANVERS: Well, it won't help Scrappy, but-- (CALLS) Morrison, bring in the 
prisoners!

SOUND: DOOR IMMEDIATELY OPENS ... PRISONERS MARCH IN BEHIND--

PHIL: Do any of them look familiar, Scrappy?

SCRAPPY: Well, I-- (SHOCKED) Hey! It can't be! There's the man I ran over!

PHIL: There's the man you <u>thought</u> you ran over. He and Scarelli pulled the old 
insurance gag. This man screamed, acted as though the car hit him, and fell.

SCRAPPY: Yeah, but I - I helped put him in the trunk!

PHIL: And were too excited to notice that he wasn't even injured.

DANVERS: (THOUGHTFUL GRUNT; THEN TO ED) All right. You! What's your name?

ED: (OFF) Ed.

DANVERS: Is this true? Talk up!

ED: (OFF) Yeah. And that's all I'm gonna say!

DANVERS: You said enough! (TO PHIL) Well, Gault, looks like you're clean. 
What're you gonna do with these kids?

PHIL: I suggest that you take 'em to the station, lieutenant, call their 
parents, and show them how narrowly Central City averted a tragedy. You might 
also suggest that the P.T.A. show some of the fine educational films available 
on marijuana and how it leads to a worse addiction. (SUMMATION) Tonight's 
events should prove that it <u>can</u> happen here. Only an alerted and enlightened 
public can prevent its further spread.

MUSIC: TRANSITION

SOUND: PHONE RINGS (CALLER'S PERSPECTIVE) ... THEN IN BG

ELLEN: Phil? Now that it's over, can I <u>please</u> have that soda?

PHIL: Just as soon as I contact the Syndicate. Just take a minute; I've 
already given the operator-- Ssh!

SOUND: DURING ABOVE, PHONE ANSWERED (CALLER'S PERSPECTIVE)

NEW YORK: (FILTER) Yes?

WHISPERER: Central City reporting.

NEW YORK: (FILTER) Go ahead, Central City.

WHISPERER: Scarelli bungled. The entire gang captured. The public is 
<u>vigorously</u> aroused. I advise that present plans be discontinued.

NEW YORK: (FILTER) We will take such action. For new instructions, call 
Chicago at midnight.

WHISPERER: Chicago at midnight.
