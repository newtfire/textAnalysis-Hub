ANNOUNCER. The World Is Yours!

(Music--Theme--Establish and Lower Under Humming As.)

ANNOUNCER (over). Men have searched the earth, the air, even the sun and stars 
in their never-ending quest for knowledge. And now in this NBC public-service 
feature, the United States Office of Education, Federal Security Agency, 
brings you the wonders of that unique establishment, the Smithsonian 
Institution--dedicated to the increase and diffusion of knowledge.

(Music--Knowledge, Knowledge.)

ANNOUNCER. This week we celebrate the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of 
the United States patent laws. Joining in this celebration, the World Is Yours 
now presents the story of American Inventors.

(Music--Theme--Up and Out).

ANNOUNCER. This week, the World Is Yours is issuing a special 24-page magazine 
devoted entirely to the story of American Invention. We invite you to send for 
this special issue, together with 12 other magazines. The services of writers 
and editors, as well as photographs and drawings are contributed by the 
Smithsonian Institution and the United States Office of Education. To cover 
the cost of printing we invite you to send in $1 for the 13 issues.

(Music--Theme--Down and Out.)

ANNOUNCER. And now--here is our friend and guide--the Oldtimer!

(Music--Secondary theme--In and Under.)

OLDTIMER (over). Hello, folks. Welcome once more to the Smithsonian 
Institution in Washington and another half-hour of searching in our never-
ending quest for knowledge. I imagine the one big thing that distinguishes 
modern man from his Neolithic cousins is his undying thirst for progress. The 
only unchangeable fact about civilization is that it is constantly changing. 
That's a fact. It is man's unquenchable thirst for improving his standard of 
living--his ceaseless struggle to overcome and master the forces of nature 
that best represents the position of the human race over the animal kingdom. 
And this yen to discover--this searching after new knowledge--this thing we 
call invention is as universal as the stars. Everybody feels it--everybody 
wants to become an inventor. (Fading) This fact was forcibly brought to my 
attention a few days ago by my grandson, Skipper. (Close fade).

SKIPPER (off mike). Grandpa--Grandpa--

OLDTIMER (aroused from a short nap). Eh? Huh? What's the matter?

SKIPPER (off mike.) Grandpa--

OLDTIMER. Oh--it's you, Skipper? I was sleeping--

SKIPPER. Did I wake you up?

OLDTIMER (yawning). Did you wake me up?

SKIPPER. Sorry, but I got something to show you. Come on out here in the yard.

OLDTIMER. What time is it?

SKIPPER. Time to get up.

OLDTIMER (yawning). All right--I'm up.

SKIPPER. Come on out here in the yard. I've got something to show you.

OLDTIMER. What is it?

SKIPPER. It's great--it's colossal! It's stupendous.

OLDTIMER. What is it--a moving picture?

SKIPPER. Are you coming?

OLDTIMER (singing to the tune of "Old Black Joe"). I'm coming--I'm coming--
though my head is bending low--

(As he sings door opens and closes as he goes into yard.)

SKIPPER (joining in--now on mike). I hear those gentle voices calling--old--
Black--Joe.!

(Both laugh.)

OLDTIMER. Now--what's all this about--this great, collossal, stupendous 
something?

SKIPPER. Look!

OLDTIMER. What is it?

SKIPPER. It's my new invention.

OLDTIMER. And just what is it?

SKIPPER. It's my self-propelling, syncro-meshed, floating-power automatic 
sling-shot!

OLDTIMER (whistles). No?

SKIPPER. Uh-huh--isn't it a beauty?

OLDTIMER. It sure is. How does it work?

SKIPPER. Well--when I pull this string--it draws this jigger back this way 
until it passes over this bar--then the arm is released and the rubber bands 
shoot forward. It's remarkable.

OLDTIMER. Remarkable.

SKIPPER. What do you think I ought to do with it?

OLDTIMER. Hide it--before your mother sees it.

SKIPPER. Hide it? I should say not. Why--this is a great invention! I'm going 
to patent it!

OLDTIMER. Patent it?

SKIPPER. Uh-huh--isn't that a keen idea?

OLDTIMER. Terrific.

SKIPPER. Now--all you've got to do is tell me how to patent it.

OLDTIMER. Tell you how to patent your self-propelling, syncro-meshed--ah--

SKIPPER. Floating-power--

OLDTIMER. Floating power automatic sling-shot?

SKIPPER. That's right?

OLDTIMER. Well, now, Skipper--I'm not sure that that's the best thing to do.

SKIPPER. Why not?

OLDTIMER. It costs money to patent something.

SKIPPER. It does?

OLDTIMER. Sure!

SKIPPER. Golly, I didn't know that.

OLDTIMER. You didn't hey? Well, now--there's probably lots more you don't know 
about patents--

SKIPPER. I guess there is.

OLDTIMER. Well, there's only one way to remedy that situation--

SKIPPER. Uh-huh--here we go--

OLDTIMER. Well, if you're going to be an inventor--you should know something 
about the history of invention. That's logical.

SKIPPER. I know it is, but--

OLDTIMER. But now let's find out what we're talking about. Come on--sit here 
with me on the steps---let me light my pipe--and then let's talk about this 
business of invention!

SKIPPER. Well, as long as I'm going to be an inventor--I might as well know 
something about my coll--coll--

OLDTIMER. Colleagues?

SKIPPER. Colleagues! Do you have to go to college to be a colleague?

OLDTIMER (blows out match). You do not! Now--

SKIPPER. Grandpa, what was the first invention?

OLDTIMER. The very first?

SKIPPER. Uh-huh--the very first.

OLDTIMER. Well, now, Abraham Lincoln had an idea on that. He said: "Man's 
first discovery was the fact that he had no clothes. And his first invention 
was the fig-leaf apron."

SKIPPER. Did he get a patent on that?

OLDTIMER (laughing). No--I guess not. But, seriously--the first invention was 
probably a stick that permitted him to extend his reach and it was gradually 
improved until it took the form of a club, or a lever, then a stone hammer or 
tomahawk. In the beginning, these discoveries were crude--but they formed the 
basic foundation for the development that followed.

SKIPPER. Club to stone tomahawk to iron hammer to pile driver.

OLDTIMER. Exactly. That's the way the story goes--one thing leads to another--
it's like a chain, I guess. A chain of man's genius. But man's genius is a 
strange thing--it needs to be fed--it needs a reward! People began to realize 
that--and they began to grant prizes and pensions to inventors. That was a 
little incentive--but not enough. So they began granting them monopolies for 
limited times on the articles they had invented.

SKIPPER. That's where patents come in.

OLDTIMER. Exactly. Back in the early days any grant from a sovereign of a 
special license or privilege, granted to an inventor and addressed to the 
public at large was called a patent.

SKIPPER. How long ago was that?

OLDTIMER. About 500 years ago. Why, back in 1594 one day a man (fading) 
appeared before the Doge of Venice (close fade).

DOGE. So--it is you. You have become a stranger since your removal to Padua.

GALILEO. I am much taken up with my lectures and my work.

DOGE. I have had some good reports.

GALILEO. Thank you, sire.

DOGE. And now--what can I do for you?

GALILEO. Sire--I have an invention.

DOGE. An invention?

GALILEO. Aye--a device for raising water and irrigating land with small 
expense and great convenience.

DOGE. Ah, so? We have need of such a device. Where is it? Where can I see it? 
We will start using it at once.

GALILEO. Sire--this invention of mine--I do not think it right that this 
invention, which is my own--discovered by me with great labor and much 
expense, be made the common property of everyone.

DOGE. You desire a patent?

GALILEO. I do, sire. I humbly petition Your Serene Highness that you deign to 
favor me so that no one but myself or my heirs or those obtaining the right 
from me or from them be allowed to make or use my new instrument. I ask you, 
sire, to grant me this right.

DOGE. How can I refuse you? You--the great Galileo?

GALILEO. Not great--just your humble servant, sire.

DOGE (laughs). Methinks you talked in rather a saucier tone to the Medicis in 
Florence. I have heard your tongue is as sharp as your wit. But it is good to 
have the flower of your genius and not the bud of your disdain. Chamberlain!

VOICE. Sire!

DOGE. Make out the necessary letters patent on this new invention of Signor 
Galileo--and turn the papers over to the council for consideration.

GALILEO. Thank you, sire.

DOGE. No; my good Galileo--thank you. For if your invention will help my 
people to irrigate their fields more easily--then truly--Venice is grateful!

(Music--Tag and Bridge.)

SKIPPER. Galileo--I guess maybe he could even find some improvements to make 
on my self-propelling, syncro-meshed, floating power automatic slingshot.

OLDTIMER. Oh--I doubt that. It looks perfect.

SKIPPER. You're kidding me.

OLDTIMER. How'd you guess? Well, it wasn't until the time that James Watt 
invented the steam engine in 1765 and Arkwright invented his cotton-spinning 
machine 2 years later--in other words, not until the time of the Industrial 
Revolution in England--that a more liberal spirit prevailed and patents became 
of great benefit to inventors and to the public.

SKIPPER. Just what does a patent do--I mean, well--what is a patent?

OLDTIMER. Now-a-days a patent is the right granted by a state to an inventor 
which secures to him the exclusive right to manufacture and sell the article 
he has invented for a certain number of years.

SKIPPER. How many years?

OLDTIMER. In the United States, we grant a patent for 17 years.

SKIPPER. How many sling-shots do you figure I can make in 17 years?

OLDTIMER. Millions--say--are you listening to me?

SKIPPER. Sure.

OLDTIMER. What did I say?

SKIPPER. When?

OLDTIMER. Just now.

SKIPPER. You said that a patent is the right that a state gives to an inventor 
to make and sell his invention for a number of years. Seventeen years in the 
United States.

OLDTIMER. Say--that's pretty good. Well, now--let's see how invention fared in 
this country. Naturally, back in colonial days we were more of a farming than 
a manufacturing country--so there weren't many patent requests. There were a 
few, however. Why, as early as 1646, Joseph Jenks petitioned the general court 
of Massachusetts for a patent; and by the way, this Joseph Jenks was one of 
the earliest and greatest American mechanics--his improvement of the scythe 
was the first of a long series of American inventions in agricultural 
machinery that reached a climax with Whitney's invention of the cotton-gin.

SKIPPER. 1792!

OLDTIMER. And McCormick's reaper.

SKIPPER. 1831!

OLDTIMER. How'd you know those dates?

SKIPPER. I stole 'em.

OLDTIMER. Stole them? From where?

SKIPPER. From the closet in the back room where you keep your stock of 
unnecessary knowledge.

OLDTIMER (laughing). But to get back to the story of American inventors and 
patents--we were talking about that, weren't we?

SKIPPER. Yes; we were.

OLDTIMER. The Colonies were much behind Europe in the granting of patents. 
Even Pennsylvania--the principal seat of colonial manufacturing did not give 
patent protection until after the Revolution.

SKIPPER. That would be 1783.

OLDTIMER. You're as full of dates today as your mother's fruit cake. But 
that's right. 1783. Under the Articles of Confederation a number of States 
began granting State patents--and pretty soon things were in an awful mess--a 
New York patent was not good in New Jersey--and a Maryland patent was useless 
in Virginia. This was one of the contributing causes for the Constitutional 
Convention that met in Philadelphia.

SKIPPER. In August 1787.

OLDTIMER. August 1787. Here the Founding Fathers debated the question 
(fading)--all during the hot months of summer--(close fade).

PINCKNEY (calls suddenly). Mr. President--will the speaker yield?

SPEAKER (stopping). I yield to Mr. Pinckney.

PINCKNEY. In view of the oppressiveness of the weather--and in view of the 
fact that Mr. John Fitch is conducting some rather interesting experiments on 
the Delaware today--I move that this convention recess until tomorrow!

VOICE. Second the motion.

PRESIDENT. A motion to recess has been made and seconded. All in favor--Aye--

VOICES (in unison). Aye!

PRESIDENT. Against--Nay--(pause). Motion carried!(Gavel.) The Convention will 
recess until tomorrow morning at 10.

(Music--Short Tag and Bridge.)

(Distant pounding of steam engine--Walla Walla of voices.)

FIRST VOICE. There she goes!

(Steam engine up and puffing hard--ship's bell off mike--horn--cheers of crowd 
in and out.)

PINCKNEY. There's a sight ah never expected to see, Madison--a boat breastin' 
a stream--goin' against th' current--without sails.

MADISON. It's a great achievement.

PINCKNEY. That John Fitch chap must be a brilliant mechanic--positively 
brilliant.

MADISON. Yes--he and James Rumsey have been doing some fine work with 
steamboats. They've both patented their boats in several States--some sort of 
legal conflict between them.

PINCKNEY. This system of State patents is wrong--all wrong. It's a national 
question--and should be controlled by the Federal Government.

MADISON. The inventor certainly should be protected. Jefferson thinks so, too. 
But I'm not too sure that patent monopolies are the answer.

PINCKNEY. How else can inventive ingenuity be encouraged?

MADISON. By granting them premiums--pensions, perhaps.

PINCKNEY. I don't agree--a man who invents an article is entitled to profit by 
the fruit of his labor. I believe that, sir.

PINCKNEY. I believe it will tend to cultivate inventive genius--and without 
such genius there could be no progress.

MADISON. That's true enough.

PINCKNEY. Look at that boat go! Look at it! The man who gives the world 
something as invaluable as a steamboat is entitled to all the protection he 
can get. Our new Constitution must guarantee this right!

MADISON. I intend to submit such a proposal.

PINCKNEY. And so do I.

(Voices up again into cheer as boat toots horn--up and up into.)

VOICE. (reading). September 5, 1787--section 8, article 1. The Congress shall 
have power to promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing to 
authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and 
discoveries!

(Music--swell up and up then out.)

OLDTIMER. And so the Constitution was adopted and the new Federal Government 
met for the first time.

SKIPPER. March 1789.

OLDTIMER. Did you swallow an almanac?

SKIPPER. Nope--just one of the World Is Yours magazines--I get all my dates 
from there.

OLDTIMER. Good for you. Well, no sooner had the new Congress met than they 
were swamped with petitions for patents and copyrights. They soon realized 
that it would be necessary to organize an administrative agency to handle the 
details--and on April 10, 1790, the first Patent Act was passed empowering the 
Secretary of State, the Secretary of War, and the Attorney General to grant 
patents in the name of the United States.

In 1793 a new law was passed which eliminated the necessity of proving an 
invention useful and important before the issuance of the patent right. This 
made the granting of a patent a purely clerical operation and the number 
gradually mounted.

SKIPPER. Well, that wouldn't have affected me. My new self-propelling--

OLDTIMER. Syncro-meshed automatic sling-shot.

SKIPPER. You left out floating power. Well--that's useful and important all 
right.

OLDTIMER. Absolutely. Well, now, in 1802 the Patent Office of the United 
States was established as a distinct unit! 1802--that's a date you can 
remember, Skipper.

SKIPPER. I will.

OLDTIMER. Dr. William Thornton was appointed as its first superintendent--and 
held office until he died in March 1828. He was head of the Patent Office 
during those grim days of 1814 when the British marched into Washington and 
burned all its public buildings with one exception--and that exception--well, 
let me tell you the story. At that time the Patent Office was located in 
Blodgett's Hotel which stood on E Street between 7th and 8th Northwest. (Start 
fade.) It was the morning of August 25 when Colonel Jones marched a detachment 
of troops up to the door of the Patent Office (close fade).

(Tramp of small detachment of troops.)

JONES. Detachment--Halt! (Sound out.) Sergeant MacDonough--Corporal Wilkes.

MACDONOUGH. (Coming in.) Colonel Jones.

WILKES. (Coming in.) Colonel Jones.

JONES. MacDonough--take a platoon up to the attic and set it afire. Wilkes--
take your platoon to the rear of the building and when I give you the signal--
put the torch to it!

THORNTON. You can't do it, sir! I tell you you can't do it!

JONES. I beg your pardon?

THORNTON. You can't burn that building! It would be a crime, sir--a dastardly, 
vicious crime.

JONES. Who are you, sir?

THORNTON. My name is Thornton--Dr. William Thornton--superintendent of the 
Patent Office--the building you are about to burn.

JONES. I am sorry, Dr. Thornton--I have given my orders.

THORNTON. But there's nothing to be gained by burning that building--
absolutely nothing.

JONES. If you have any private property in that building you may take it out.

THORNTON. There is nothing in that building but private property. Nothing but 
the brain children of thousands of artists. I tell you this, sir, that 
building contains nothing but hundreds of models of the arts. It will be 
impossible to remove them--and if you burn them--burn these models that will 
be useful to mankind--all mankind, sir--American, English, French, Chinese, or 
Japanese--if you burn this building it will be as barbarous as was the burning 
of the Alexandrian Library by the Turks who have been ever since condemned by 
all the enlightened nations. Don't do it, sir--I beg of you--don't destroy the 
Patent Office!

JONES (quietly). The British have never been accused of barbarity before--they 
shall not stand so accused now. The Patent Office will be spared.

(Music--Tag and Bridge Up and Up Then Down and Out.)

SKIPPER. Hooray for Dr. Thornton.

OLDTIMER. Yes; the Patent Office was the only Federal building not destroyed 
by the British and it was used by Congress for the entire next session while 
the Capitol was being restored.

SKIPPER. That should have given the Congressmen a lot of good ideas--I mean 
working in the Patent Office, you see?

OLDTIMER. I see--but I don't think it's very funny. Well, now--the Patent Act 
of 1793 was not perfect--the people soon discovered that. Patents were granted 
to almost everyone who asked for them--with little question as to originality, 
novelty, or previous patents. The result was the courts were soon crowded with 
infringement suits. So--as always--Congress rolled up its sleeves, and, in 
1836, passed a new Patent Act--the act that forms the basis of our existing 
patent system.

SKIPPER. That was 1836.

OLDTIMER. That's right. This new law created a systematic examination method 
of granting patents--it established the Patent Office as a distinct and 
separate bureau of the Government with a Commissioner of Patents at the head--
and it provided for a complete organization to make effective the new American 
plan of predetermining the validity of an invention before a grant of patent.

SKIPPER. Predetermining the validity of an invention?

OLDTIMER. That means that they make sure before they grant a patent that the 
idea being patented is original with the applicant.

SKIPPER. You mean they've got to do that before they give me mv patent on my 
sling-shot.

OLDTIMER. You bet they do. And this system of predetermining the validity of a 
patent was something new and original--it formed the basis of our new system--
and our system became the model for most of the civilized world.

SKIPPER. Gee whiz! Grandpa, didn't Lincoln invent something? Sure he did! I 
remember now--some sort of boat, isn't it? It's on exhibit at the Smithsonian?

OLDTIMER. That's right--Lincoln received a patent for a device for lifting 
river boats off sandbars. He was the only President ever to receive a patent.

SKIPPER. Good for him.

OLDTIMER. Well, now--the story of the Patent Office and American inventors 
comes right up to date with just a few changes. In 1849, the Office was moved 
from the State Department to the Interior Department--and on April 1, 1925, it 
was transferred to the Department of Commerce.

SKIPPER. And that's where it is now?

OLDTIMER. Right.

SKIPPER. And how many patents have they granted already--up to date?

OLDTIMER. I saw that figure in the papers the other day--It was over 2 
million.

SKIPPER. Golly--that's a lot of gadgets.

OLDTIMER. You bet it is--only we mustn't forget this: That among those 2 
million gadgets are some of the most monumental and important discoveries of 
mankind. Can you name some?

SKIPPER. Sure. Let's see--the telephone--Alexander Graham Bell! The electric 
light--Thomas A. Edison! The sewing machine--Elias Howe! Er--the reaper--
McCormick! Er--let's see--the telegraph--Samuel F. B. Morse!

OLDTIMER. Yes--and more. Charles Goodyear's vulcanizing process; Wright 
Brothers' airplane; George Westinghouse and the air brake--and the list could 
go on indefinitely. But don't forget this--most of the 2 million patents 
granted by the patent office are granted to men and women--just plain folks--
who have had ideas. Good or bad--they were original--and they were patented. 
Yes; I know a story about just such an invention--a story about a gentleman 
named Samuel Clemens.

SKIPPER. You mean Mark Twain.

OLDTIMER. Mark Twain is right. One day in 1871, Mark Twain was seated in his 
study hunched over a paper (fading)--on which were scrawled all sorts of 
strange markings--

(Knock on door.)

TWAIN. Come in.

(Door open and close.)

SELLERS. 'Morning, Sam!

TWAIN. Ah, Colonel Sellers. Well, Colonel--I've news--

SELLERS. About your book?

TWAIN. Books be hanged! I have something better--yes, sir--I've filed an 
application for a patent for my new Improvement in Adjustable and Detachable 
Straps for Garments.

SELLERS. What's that?

TWAIN. It's a magnificent thing. Simple--but necessary! It consists of an 
adjustable and detachable strap for vests, pantaloons--or any other garment 
requiring straps.

SELLERS. I don't understand.

TWAIN. Take your coat off--

SELLERS. But--

TWAIN. Take it off--

SELLERS. All right, but--

(Swish of coat off.)

TWAIN. Here--notice this strap at the back of the vest.

SELLERS. What about it?

TWAIN. It's all wrong.

SELLERS. It is?

TWAIN. Certainly. It's too rigid--what happens when you bend over--or put on 
more weight? What happens? Naturally--the strap doesn't give with the 
additional strain--and the vest probably bursts its seams.

SELLERS. Really.

TWAIN. Absolutely. Now--with my invention--an elastic strap--it will be able 
to expand to meet the additional strain. How's that?

SELLERS. I guess it's pretty good.

TWAIN. You bet it is. Why--just think of it--Think of all the vests worn, in 
America and in Europe--and a patented strap for each of them. And then the 
Orient where the people swarm like sands of the desert--and not a single vest 
strap among them yet-- (Knock on door.) What is it? What is it?

(Door opens.)

MAID (colored). 'Scuse me, Mr. Clemens--'dere's a letter just came--looks kind 
o' impohtant.

TWAIN. Let me have it. Ah--from the Patent Office! (Tears letter--takes it 
out.) (Mutters) Dear Mr. Clemens we--and--No! No! Impossible! Impossible!

SELLERS. What is it?

TWAIN. It's impossible--a notice of interference from the Patent Office.

SELLERS. What does it mean?

TWAIN. It means that someone is claiming they thought of the adjustable and 
detachable Strap before I did! They intend to contest my patent! By the 
Saints, Sellers--it's a conspiracy--someone is trying to rob me of my 
invention! I won't permit it! Won't permit it!

SELLERS. You mean someone else thought of the idea before you did.

TWAIN. So they say.

SELLERS. Amazing!

TWAIN. I'll fight them--I'll fight them to the Supreme Court. I tell you 
Sellers--no one is going to steal my invention! This is my invention--my 
Adjustable and Detachable Strap--my brain child--it shall not be kidnapped!

(Music--Tag and Bridge.)

SKIPPER. And did Mark Twain get his patent?

OLDTIMER. He finally did. But I'm afraid he never made any money out of it. It 
just went the way of all the rest of those good ideas patented but never 
profitable.

SKIPPER. Tell me--what inventor received the most patents?

OLDTIMER. Edison--I think--over 1,100.

SKIPPER. Well, I hate to say this--but Mr. Edison's mark is about to be 
beaten. Wait'll I start. Why--just look at this---my very first invention--my 
self-propelling, syncro-meshed, floating power automatic sling shot.

OLDTIMER. Let's see if it works.

SKIPPER. All right. Here--I'll put this pebble into this pocket--pull the 
jigger back--back--back--

(Snap of rubber band--pause--then off mike the crash of glass.)

OLDTIMER. Uh-Oh! Now you've done it!

SKIPPER. Gee!

MOTHER (off mike). Skipper! Skipper! Did you break this window?

SKIPPER (calling). Why, I--

MOTHER. Come into the house this minute.

OLDTIMER. Here's where you catch it.

SKIPPER. Golly, I didn't think it'd go that far.

OLDTIMER. You better get going.

SKIPPER (downcast). Yes, sir--

OLDTIMER. And if you can invent an alibi for breaking that window--then I 
really think you've got a chance to beat Tom Edison.

(Music--Knowledge, knowledge--)

OLDTIMER. Friends, radio appeals to the ear. Print appeals to the eye. In 
other words, catch it by radio and fix it by print. It has been my privilege 
to see the proof of this week's 24-page magazine. It's an issue everyone 
should be proud to have. First of all, there is that new photographic cover 
which certainly dresses up the entire publication in new spring clothes. The 
Patent Office and the Smithsonian Institution have opened their files for use 
and we have some of their finest pictures. Head Curator Carl Mitman wrote the 
major article on the American inventor. In addition, we have other features, 
consisting of page after page of unusual and authentic facts about the 
colorful history of invention in the United States. You may receive this issue 
together with 12 others--covering subjects through June--for $1. The address, 
of course, is World Is Yours, Washington, D. C.
