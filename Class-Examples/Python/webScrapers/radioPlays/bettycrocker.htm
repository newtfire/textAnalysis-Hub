M.C.:     From coast to coast ... General Mills brings you The
          Betty Crocker Magazine of the Air ... featuring Eve Curie,
          the famous daughter of one of the world's most famous 
          women. And here to welcome EVE CURIE ...
          is America's First Lady of Foods ... BETTY CROCKER

                (APPLAUSE)

CROCKER:  Good morning everyone ... and a warm welcome to you 
          all! For just a moment I'm going to ask you to imagine
          that you were someone else. Imagine what it would be
          like if your mother was the greatest woman scientist
          the world has ever known! Marie Curie gave the world
          one of its rarest elements ... radium .. which gave
          mankind the means of fighting its most dreaded disease.
          And she also gave the world a charming and brilliant
          daughter who has never traded on her mother's fame ...
          but has achieved an eminence of her own as an author,
          lecturer, newspaper publisher ... and above all ... a
          French patriot. In just a moment you'll meet Eve Curie
          ... and having met her ... you'll never forget her!

M.C.:     Well, since Mademoiselle Curie is French and I speak
          ze Francais like ze native ... Be-tee Crockair, what 
          is ze menu for ze day?

CROCKER:  (LAUGHS) Well - in native American ... here's my
          menu for today - We start the meal with chilled orange 
          sections. And for the main dish ... tender juicy
          golden brown cod steaks, served with buttered broccoli
          ... and broiled sliced raw potatoes. And for a quick
          and easy dessert ... a big slice of our Gold Medal
          Apricot Streusel Coffee Cake ... golden brown with rich
          crumbs on top and a luscious rich apricot filling.

M.C.:     Um ... those Gold Medal coffee cakes! And in <u>any</u>
          language ... Make mine a big piece. And you know folks,
          if you haven't discovered how wonderful Gold Medal is 
          for everything you bake you're really missing something.
          Because Gold Medal is a perfectly-balanced flour,
          blended from as many as four select wheats. No wonder
          it's America's favorite all-purpose flour by nearly two
          to one over any other brand. And here's something else
          you should know: - over one and a half million tests
          are made annually in the General Mills laboratories and
          kitchens to make sure Gold Medal four is always
          uniform ... with the same superb baking qualities ...
          sack after sack, the year 'round. Get Gold Medal
          "Kitchen-tested" Enriched Flour today, and look for
          that folder of tested Betty Crocker recipes that comes
          in every sack.

CROCKER:  And now ... I want you all to meet our distinguished
          guest ... a very lovely lady ... EVE CURIE!

          (CUE FOR WEST COAST AND MOUNTAIN STATIONS TO CUT AWAY
          FROM NETWORK)

                  (SIX SECONDS OF APPLAUSE)

BUSINESS: (GOOD MORNINGS ALL AROUND)

CROCKER:  We're so delighted that you could drop in for a visit
          this morning, Eve! And welcome back to America, too!
          how long will you be here this time?

EVE:      ABOUT ELEVEN WEEKS ... DOING A LECTURE TOUR.

CROCKER:  Well, Eve ... I know you visited America for the first 
          time with your mother when you were just sixteen. What
          was your first impression of our country?

EVE:      WELL, AS YOU KNOW, BETTY, ON THAT TRIP MOTHER HAD COME
          TO AMERICA TO RECEIVE A MOST WONDERFUL GIFT FROM THE
          WOMEN OF AMERICA ... A $250,000 GRAM OF THE PRECIOUS
          RADIUM SHE HAD DISCOVERED BUT WAS TOO POOR TO BUY TO
          CONTINUE HER RESEARCH. AND THERE WAS SO MUCH
          EXCITEMENT THAT I DIDN'T HAVE A REAL OPPORTUNITY TO GET
          ACQUAINTED WITH AMERICA THEN.

CROCKER:  But on your next visit ... you made a coast to coast
          tour and become one of our most popular speakers! And
          what did you discover about America then?

EVE:      WELL, THE EUROPEAN IDEA USED TO BE THAT AMERICA WAS A
          NATION OF PRACTICAL PEOPLE ALL WRAPPED UP IN MAKING
          MONEY. I DISCOVERED THAT NOTHING COULD BE MORE UNTRUE.
          THIS IS THE MOST SENTIMENTAL AND IDEALISTIC COUNTRY I
          KNOW. IT'S THE ONLY COUNTRY WHERE ONE MAY FIND A
          GENUINE FRESHNESS OF FEELING ... AN IMMEDIATE REACTION
          TO WORLD EVENTS AND SINCERE INDIGNATION OVER WRONGS 
          COMMITTED. I HAVE A DEEP LOVE FOR AMERICA.

CROCKER:  And America has taken you to her heart, too. Eve ... I
          know being the daughter of the world's greatest woman
          scientist must have presented some problems ... with
          so much on her mind ... did your mother ever have time 
          to spend with you and your sister?

EVE:      AS BUSY AS SHE WAS ... MOTHER WAS NOT ONLY A GREAT
          SCIENTIST ... BUT A WONDERFUL MOTHER AS WELL. AND I
          KNOW HOW DIFFICULT IT MUST HAVE BEEN BECAUSE THERE WAS
          VERY LITTLE MONEY.

          YOU KNOW SHE DIDN'T WANT TO TAKE OUT PATENTS ON HER
          DISCOVERIES ... AND MY FATHER WAS KILLED IN A TRAGIC
          ACCIDENT WHEN I WAS JUST 18 MONTHS OLD ... SO WE WERE
          MOTHER'S RESPONSIBILITIES. WE HAD A VERY QUIET LIFE ...
          AND A QUIET AND PEACEFUL HOME ... AND I DO BELIEVE MY
          SISTER AND I SAW MORE OF OUR MOTHER THAN MANY GIRLS DO
          TODAY WHO HAVE SOCIALITE MOTHERS WHO HAVE SO MANY SOCIAL
          ENGAGEMENTS THEY'RE NEVER AT HOME! YOU KNOW?

M.C.:     Miss Curie, I'd like to tell you how much I enjoyed
          your biography of your mother. She was never really
          aware of her great fame, was she?

EVE:      THAT'S TRUE, WIN. SHE DIDN'T MEAN TO BE MODEST. SHE
          JUST WAS. SHE NEVER TALKED ABOUT HERSELF TO US AND I
          DIDN'T KNOW I HAD A FAMOUS MOTHER UNTIL I CAME TO
          AMERICA WITH HER TO RECEIVE THE RADIUM GIFT.

CROCKER:  Well, Eve ... you've achieved a fame of your own ...
          and your modesty is most becoming. The work you did
          for France during the war has already made history ...
          and now you're the co-publisher of the second largest
          daily newspaper in France. Won't you tell us a little 
          bit about it?

EVE:      WE HAVE A CIRCULATION OF ABOUT A HALF MILLION ... AN
          AFTERNOON PAPER ... AND AS YOU KNOW, THE PAPER SHORTAGE
          IS STILL VERY ACUTE ... SO WE HAVE ONLY 4 PAGES. OUR
          "PARIS PRESSE" LOOKS VERY ODD NEXT TO YOUR NICE, FAT
          AMERICAN NEWSPAPERS.

CROCKER:  And is your newspaper set up very much like ours?

EVE:      YES ... AND THE FRENCH LOVE SERIALS ... AND THEY WERE
          STARVED FOR AMERICAN NOVELS BECAUSE THERE WERE NONE
          DURING THE WAR ... SO WE ALWAYS HAVE AN AMERICAN 
          SERIAL RUNNING IN THE "PARIS PRESSE."

CROCKER:  Tell us, Eve ... what are conditions in France today?

EVE:      THE FRENCH LIVE BETTER NOW ... WINNING THEIR FIGHT
          AGAINST COMMUNISM ... SHORTAGES ENDING ... PRODUCING
          MUCH MORE ... IMPORTANCE OF AMERICAN AID ... PERHAPS
          AMERICANS WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHERE THEIR MONEY IS GOING
          ... TELLS BRIEFLY ABOUT FINANCIAL ALLOCATION.

CROCKER:  Thank you, Eve. There has always been a tremendous 
          spiritual bond between America and France ... and I
          can't think of a lovelier ambassador of good will from
          your country to ours ... than Mademoiselle Eve Curie!

EVE:      (THANKS BETTY CROCKER)

CROCKER:  Eve, I understand you have a wonderful new apartment
          in Paris ... Is the housing shortage as bad there as
          it is here?

EVE:      IT'S DESPERATE! YOU KNOW, DURING THE WAR, THE VICHY
          GOVERNMENT DEPRIVED ME OF MY CITIZENSHIP AND MY
          BELONGINGS FROM MY APARTMENT WERE SOLD AT AUCTION ...
          ALL MY MOTHER'S FURNITURE ... IT BROKE MY HEART. SO
          WHEN THE WAR WAS OVER, FOR FOUR SOLID YEARS I HAD A
          ROOM AT A HOTEL AND THEN JUST LAST SPRING I FOUND THIS
          CHARMING APARTMENT ON THE SEVENTH FLOOR ... WHICH IS 
          HIGH FOR PARIS ... I CAN LOOK OUT OVER THE ROOFTOPS ...
          HAVE A BEAUTIFUL VIEW OF THE RIVER SEINE AND NOTRE DAME
          CATHEDRAL!

CROCKER:  It sounds perfectly beautiful! And by the way ... we
          can't let you get away before you tell us the latest
          fashion news from Paris!

M.C.:     For Pete's sake, yes! What's happening to the ladies'
          skirts ... I hope - I hope - I hope!

EVE:      (LAUGHS) WELL, I THINK YOU'LL GET YOUR HOPE, WIN.
          SKIRTS WILL BE SHORTER. SOME OF THE FRENCH DESIGNERS
          ARE MAKING DAYTIME SKIRTS 16 INCHES FROM THE FLOOR ...
          AND THAT'S REVOLUTIONARY IN COMPARISON WITH THE PRESENT
          STYLES.

M.C.:     Well, I can SEE why French designs are so popular!

CROCKER:  And all the French designers are using a great deal of
          embroidery this Spring, aren't they?

EVE:      OH, YES ... AND [I] BELIEVE THIS COUNTRY WILL FEEL THAT
          FASHION INFLUENCE VERY STRONGLY. AND JACQUES FATH ...
          ONE OF THE MORE POPULAR DESIGNERS ... HAS THE
          INTERESTING IDEA OF USING ALMOND SHELL AND WALNUT
          SHELLS FOR TRIMMING ... COMBINING THEM WITH HEAVY GOLD 
          THREAD ... I DOUBT WHETHER THAT BECOMES VERY POPULAR
          ANYWHERE!

M.C.:     Well, it's all right if they give away a nutcracker
          with every dress! And now ...

          (INTO FOOD)

          Not to change the subject <u>much</u> ... but it sure smells
          wonderful in the kitchen this morning and I'm getting 
          even hungrier than usual!

CROCKER:  That's an Apricot Streusel Coffee Cake I have baking
          in the oven, Win ... and it will be done in just a few
          minutes. It's a beautiful light tender quick bread
          with a surprise center of golden apricots and a
          crumbly sweet streusel topping.

EVE:      IS THERE ANYTHING MORE WONDERFUL THAN A FRESHLY BAKED
          COFFEE CAKE AND A PIPING HOT CUP OF COFFEE!

CROCKER:  And, Eve, this Apricot Streusel coffee cake is
          especially delicious! And we're going to make one 
          right now so you can see how it's made. Here are the
          ingredients if you'd like to jot them down: 1 1/2 cups
          sifted Gold Medal Flour, 3/4 cup sugar, 3 teaspoons
          double action baking powder, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1/4 cup
          shortening, 1 egg, 1/2 cup milk, and 1 teaspoon vanilla, 
          1/2 cup strained stewed apricots. Then for the rich
          crumb topping you'll need 1/4 cup brown sugar, firmly 
          packed, 1 tablespoon of Gold Medal Flour, 1 teaspoon of
          cinnamon, 1 tablespoon melted butter and 1/4 cup chopped
          nuts.

M.C.:     Umm ... that's what I smell! Cinnamon 'n' brown sugar
          'n chopped nuts! Apricot Streusel Coffee Cake!

CROCKER:  And here's how it's made. Sift the flour, sugar,
          baking powder, and salt into a bowl ... this way. Then
          cut in 1/4 cup of shortening with a pastry blender or two
          knives until the mixture looks like a meal. Then all you
          do is stir in the egg, milk and vanilla, and pour them
          into the dry ingredients stirring enough so that all the
          ingredients are well blended.

M.C.:     What ... no apricots?

EVE:      Win's a big help around the kitchen, isn't he, Betty?

CROCKER:  (CHUCKLES) I wouldn't know what to do without him. We
          add the apricots now, Win ... and here's the interesting
          part about this coffee cake.

          First ... you spread 1/2 of the mixture into a well
          greased and floured baking pan, 6 x 10 inches ... like
          this. Then we'll spread the apricots over the batter
          well out to the edges of the pan so it covers the batter
          ... this way. Now ... we'll add the rest of the batter
          ... spooning it over the apricot filling ... This is
          much easier than pouring it ... And you know, if there's
          a young baby in the house ...

M.C.:     There is at my house.

CROCKER:  Well ... strained apricot baby food is just right to
          use in this coffee cake ... Then sprinkle the streusel
          topping over the mixture. Now, we're ready to bake
          our Apricot Streusel Coffee Cake in our preheated quick
          moderate oven 375 degrees for 25 to 30 minutes ... So
          we'll just take out the one we baked earlier and put 
          the one we just made into the oven to bake ... There we
          are! ... And here's our Apricot Streusel Coffee cake
          that's all baked and ready to eat! Doesn't it look
          tempting?

                (HOLDS UP CAKE)

                (APPLAUSE)

CROCKER:  Luscious hot coffee cake topped with rich streusel
          crumbs and a layer of golden apricots through the 
          center ... welcome any time .. breakfast, lunch, or
          dinner ... and wonderful for an afternoon snack with
          a big glass of milk.

          And here are some success tips to remember when making 
          this recipe. Mix only enough to blend the ingredients
          ... don't over-mix. And spoon the second layer of
          batter over the apricots ... then spread it ... it's 
          easier this way. Now Win, I'm glad to see you've 
          passed samples of our Apricot Streusel Coffee Cake to 
          Eve Curie and our other guests.

M.C.:     Um-hum and I sampled some myself and as your number one
          Taste Tester I can say it is scrumptious!

          (AD LIB INTO TASTE TEST) 

          (INTO QUIZ)

M.C.:     QUESTION 1. If your husband asked you to make 
          dumplings for dinner tonight what kind of dough would
          you prepare?
          (ALL CORRECT)  a) pie pastry
                         b) rolled biscuit dough
                         c) or drop biscuit dough?

CROCKER:  All three are correct. Dumplings are made from all
          three types of dough ... depending upon the type of
          dumpling desired.

M.C.:     QUESTION 2. Why are bars of baking chocolate marked 
          off in squares?

CROCKER:  To make it easier to measure the chocolate for a recipe.

M.C.:     QUESTION 3. If you were going to make "Hush Puppies"
          which of the following would you need?
                         a) Sugar cane
          (CORRECT)      b) Corn meal 
                         c) Frankfurters?

CROCKER:  You would need corn meal. Hush puppies are thin corn
          pones fried in deep fat, or baked in the oven.

M.C.:     QUESTION 4. If someone said they were sending you 
          some Comices, Anjous, and Boscs, what kind of gift
          would you expect to receive?
          (AS[K] EVE CURIE)

CROCKER:  Winter pears. Comices, Anjous, and Boscs are the three
          types of pears available this time of year.

          And now I'd like to give each of you who participated

          And all this goes to you, too, Eve Curie, for your part
          in the quiz.

          And now, Eve Curie ... I want to thank you for being 
          such a charming guest ... and we want you to have a
          souvenir of your visit to our kitchen ... something to

CROCKER:  Now Win - aren't there some new questions in our All
          You Have To Do Department?

M.C.:     Yes - Betty Crocker - Mrs. MacWolfe of 1815 Beverly
          Road, Brooklyn, New York, asks:

          "What do you have to do to remove corks which have been 
          forced down into bottles?"

          Betty Crocker says:

CROCKER:  Empty the bottle, then pour pure ammonia onto the cork.
          Allow it to stand and the cork will disintegrate and
          can be removed easily.

          THAT'S ALL YOU HAVE TO DO.

M.C.:     And Mrs. Henry Regan of New York City ... would like to
          know:

          "What do you have to do to prevent water from
          boiling off and burning the bottom of double boilers?"

          Betty Crocker says:

CROCKER:  Put a few of your child's marbles or a metal jar top
          in the water. When the water gets low you'll hear a
          rattle to warn you to refill the pot.

          THAT'S ALL YOU HAVE TO DO.

M.C.:     Mrs. A. A. Roth, 1722 Linden Avenue, Baltimore, Md.,
          wants to know:

          "What do you have to do to remove the scorch caused by
          starch from the bottom of an iron?"

CROCKER:  Cool the iron and rub the bottom of the iron with a
          soft cloth dipped in soap and water or silver cream.

          [THAT'S ALL YOU HAVE TO DO.]

          And I know you'll all want to make a special date to 
          join us on Monday because our guest will be that
          charming and handsome star of the silver screen ...

M.C.:     Aw ... what's he got that I haven't got? Except a
          mustache!

CROCKER:  (LAUGHS) Well, for one thing ... he has an English
          accent ... because ... our guest on Monday is DAVID
          NIVEN! You'll truly enjoy meeting him ... so do be
          with us! I'll be expecting you. This is Zella Layne
          speaking for Betty Crocker.

          (USE THE FOLLOWING ONLY WHEN HITCH IS OMITTED) 

M.C.:     You have been a guest of the Betty Crocker Magazine of 
          the Air ... brought to you Monday through Friday at 
          this time for service, entertainment, and good
          eating by General Mills.
