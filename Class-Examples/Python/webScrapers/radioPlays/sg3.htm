<u>MUSIC:		FIRST PHRASE OF "HOW MILD</u>"

SMITH: 		Our stars tonight...June Allyson and Peter Lawford                                        

<u>MUSIC: 		SECOND PHRASE OF "HOW MILD</u>"

SMITH:		Our play...."Little Women"

<u>MUSIC:		COMPLETE "HOW MILD"</u>

SMITH:		Our hosts the makers of Camel Cigarettes.

QUARTET:	How mild,

		How mild,

		How mild can a cigarette be?

		Make the Camel thirty-day test

		And you'll see!

SMITH:		Not one single ease of throat irritation due to smoking

		Camels -- that's what noted throat specialists reported

		in a coast-to-coast test of hundreds of people who

		smoked only Camels for thirty days! That's how mild

		Camels are!

BARCLAY:	Make a note. Remember your throat. Try Camels today!

<u>MUSIC:		INTO PLAY THEME AND FADE OUT INTO</u>:

SMITH:		And now, while you discover the smoking enjoyment of

		Camel Cigarettes, for your listening enjoyment the Camel

		Screen Guild Theatre brings you a story that children for

		many generations have loved, a warm and tender portrait

		that you will all remember. The Camel Screen Guild

		Theatre is proud to present Louisa Mae Alcott's "Little

		Women" starring June Allyson and Peter Lawford.

<u>MUSIC:		FULL INTO PLAY THEME .. AND DOWN TO HOLD UNDER</u>

MARMEE: 	(SOFTLY) My little women .... My four very precious little

		women..Sometimes I see them still as they were in those days..

		dark days for us..trying days, with their father still away in

		some distant Army Camp..And yet, even in those days, Christmas

		came again. And since I was busy at the Army Hospital - (<u>BUZZ</u>

		<u>OF GIRLS' VOICES UNDER:)</u> - my little women decorated the tree

		for themselves. (<u>MUSIC: CUTS</u>)

JO:		Amy, it needs another string of popcorn here.

AMY:		And a few more angels. I'll paint them, Jo.

BETH:		I think it's a beautiful Christmas tree!

JO:		Well it's nice, Beth, but - (STOPS)

MEG:		But what, Jo?

JO:		Meg - Christmas won't be Christmas without any presents.

MEG:		No..(SIGHS) It's so dreadful to be poor!

JO:		Well, I can tell you one thing: We won't always be poor! Some

		day I'll be a famous writer and make my fortune selling stories!

		And you'll all ride around in fine carriages! And have

		servants and money and dozens of dresses!

MEG:		I should like <u>that</u>.

JO:		So..there's no use fretting now..Come on, let's rehearse our

		Christmas play! Amy, I wrote a new scene for you. It's

		wonderful!

AMY:		(ANGUISHED) Oh, <u>no</u>!

JO:		It's perfectly simple. All you have to do is shout, 'Roderigo!

		Roderigo, save me!' - and faint!

AMY:		(A MONOTONE) 'Roderigo - Roderigo, save me' - and faint....I

		can do that. I've planned my costume, too. It's absolutely

		plain, with all the colors of the rainbow in it ....

[2]

JO:		Impossible....

AMY:		Why? I'm a princess, am I not?

JO:		You're a princess, but you don't know it. You think

		you're a servant girl working for Beth - I mean Hagar,

		the witch.

AMY:		A princess <u>always</u> knows she's a princess.

JO:		Well, you don't .... Look - Beth has just left the stage

		with her kettleful of simmering toads....you're locked

		in the tower.... Suddenly I enter - I'm Hugo, the

		villain - and you cry out in horror, 'Roderigo!

		Roderigo, save me' - and faint....Then Roderigo --

		that's Meg - enters.

AMY:		Meg, Roderigo? I thought Meg was Don Pedro, my father.

JO:		She is. But you don't know it.

AMY:		Does Meg know?

MEG:		(HELPFUL) Of course I do.

AMY:		Then I went to know, too. Why shouldn't I?

JO:		Because if you know who you are, the play is over!

AMY:		Well, it's too long anyway.

JO:		Amy, please! After all, it's my play and - and -

AMY:		And what?

JO:		(EXCITED) Look - you can see him through the window!

MEG:		Who?

JO: 		That boy next door! He's watching us again!

MEG: )		Where?
     )
AMY: )		Let me see!
     )
BETH:)		I want to see him!

[3]

JO:		I certainly would like to know him. I'd like to know a

		<u>boy</u> for a change!

MEG:		Jo - that's brazen: .... (RIGHTEOUSLY) They say in the

		village he's a very wild sort .... He ran away from

		school, and they couldn't trace him anywhere .... and 

		finally they found him in an Army hospital - wounded.

JO:		How perfectly splendid! I would like to do that!

AMY:		A fine soldier you'd make!

MEG:		And now he's staying with his grandfather, Mr. Lawrence -

		and while he's recovering, he has a tutor.

JO:		I wonder how I can get to know him .... (THINKING)

		Perhaps our cat might get lost....and he might

		bring it back .... and we might get to talking ....

MEG:		I don't think that's very romantic.

JO:		No one said anything about <u>romance</u>.... (SHOUTS) Yoo hoo!

		Hello ! ....

MEG:		(SHOCKED) Jo, you’re disgracing us!.... What will he 

		<u>think</u>?

JO:		(SMILING) He’ll think I’m awful. But he <u>did</u> wave back!

<u>MUSIC		ACCENTS... AND .. FADES OUT INTO</u>:

LAURIE: 		(TO SELF) There must be some way to get to know them..

		They always seem to be having so much fun.... Perhaps

		one of these days I can -

BROOKE: 		(SLIGHTLY OFF, QUIETLY) Laurie - ?

LAURIE:		(STARTLED) Oh - hello, Brooke....

BROOKE:		(COMING IN) At the window again? Your grandfather's

		not going to care much for that. After all, you're

		supposed to be studying.

[4]

LAURIE:		Studying! Hang it all, Brooke, it's Christmas Eve!

BROOKE:		That's no excuse....(SUDDEN SMILE).....But, I have a

		suggestion....

LAURIE:		A suggestion?

BROOKE:		Perhaps if we started your studies earlier, we might finish

		earlier. Then, by four o'clock, you could give your

		undivided attention - (SMILES) - to the view!

LAURIE:		(SMILING) And we’ll start this very moment! ... Look - she's

		out there now! That's the one I like to watch! See her!

BROOKE:		Yes..though it's a strange way to spend Christmas Eve -

		shovelling snow off the walk.

LAURIE:		(ADMIRINGLY) She swings that shovel just like a boy......

		Interesting, isn't she?

BROOKE:		Mm...yes...but, the other one is <u>pretty</u>. She must be the

		oldest, I think...You know, I've been wondering if.......

LAURIE:		Look! She's seen us! She's smiling up at us! (SUDDENLY)

		Brooke, I'm going to talk to her! (<u>WINDOW SLIDES UP</u>)

BROOKE:		Careful, Laurie - your throat!

LAURIE:		I'm all right! ... (CALLS) Hello, there.

JO:		(OFF, SHOUTS) Hello!.....
 
LAURIE:		(CALLS) Isn't that hard work - for a girl?

JO:		(OFF) That's all we have in this family!...(THEN) Why

		don't you come out and help me?

LAURIE:		(CALLS) Can't. I have the quinsy.

JO:		(OFF) Oh, what a shame!

LAURIE:		(CALLS) Isn't catching, though..I can have visitors - only I

		don't know anyone.

JO:		(OFF) You know me.....almost!

[5]

LAURIE:		(CALLS, EAGERLY) Could you come over and keep me

		company? I'd be very happy!..(LOW) Brooke, you think

		she'll really come?

BROOKE:		I don't know, Laurie, I -

JO:		(OFF, SHOUTING EXCITEDLY) Marmee!....Marmee!....

BROOKE:		(SMILING) I think she'll come.

<u>MUSIC:		ACCENTS....AND FADES OUT INTO</u>:

LAURIE:		I'm so glad you were able to come and visit. Let me

		take your coat... ....

JO:		Thank you.

		(EFFICIENTLY) Well, I've come to entertain you. I'll

		read aloud and you can listen.....I do love to read

		aloud.

LAURIE:		I'd rather just talk .... if you don't mind.

JO:		Oh, no! I love to talk, too!

LAURIE:		(SMILING) If you'll come in here.....(<u>STEPS</u>) .... This 

		is the drawing room ......

JO:		Christopher Columbus! What richness! Why, this is a

		palace! It's marvelous! So roomy! And so full of

		<u>things</u>! I call this splendor - I really do!

LAURIE:		(SMILING) It's just a room....Will you have some tea?

JO:		(WORLDLY) Of course. (<u>DISHES CLINK</u>)

LAURIE:		Sugar? How many lumps?

JO:		One, please.....Uh - two...<u>three.</u>

LAURIE:		(SMILING) Three it is.......

JO:		Thank you....(WORLDLY AGAIN) Well, Mr. Lawrence....now

		do tell me all about yourself .... Of course I know all about

		your school and the Army...in fact, <u>everything</u>....But

		before that - what?

[6]

LAURIE:		Well, I used to live in Europe with my parents and -

JO:		Europe! I'm going to Europe, you know!

LAURIE:		Really? When?

JO:		Oh, I don't know exactly. You see, my Aunt March - I

		just started to work for her as companion, and what a

		fidgety nervous soul she is, too - well, anyway, my

		Aunt has rheumatism, and the doctors thought baths

		might - Cookies? Thank you! Oh, not that she hasn't 

		got a bath - she has a very nice one - Did you take

		any baths while you were there?

LAURIE:		(PUZZLED) Baths?

JO:		I mean for your rheumatism.

LAURIE:		(AMAZED) I haven't got rheumatism.

JO:		Neither have I, but you see I figured baths wouldn't do 

		me any harm - I mean - that is to say, while I was - 

		Mmmm, these cookies <u>are</u> good! - because I've always

		wanted to go to Europe - not for the baths, of course -

		not at all - for my writing. It's so good for writers.

		You see, my Aunt March - oh, but you don't know Aunt

		March.... What were you going to say, Mr. Lawrence?

LAURIE:		Nothing....Except, I'm not Mr. Lawrence. I'm Laurie.

JO:		Well..Laurie, then....And I'm Jo. That's short for

		Josephine, of course....

LAURIE:		(SMILING) Of course....

JO:		Tell me - how are you getting along with your grandfather,

		Laurie?

LAURIE:		Oh, fine..once I got used to him....You know, he's -

		well - he's....

[7]

JO:		(VERY CONFIDENTIAL) Oh, yes, I know.....

LAURIE:		(SMILING) I suppose we shouldn't even dare say it in

		front of his portrait.

JO:		(STUDYING PORTRAIT) He does look grim, doesn't he? I

		can see how his face might frighten a lot of people...

		but I can't imagine being afraid of him...Of course,

		every time I've ever seen him he's been barking at

		something...but somehow...well....I rather like him.

MR. L:		(SLIGHTLY OFF) Thank you, ma'am.

JO:		(GASPING) Oh!..

LAURIE:		(AGHAST) Grandfather!

MR. L:		(COMING IN) So you think my face frightens people,

		young lady?

JO:		(SCARED, BUT BRAVE) Yes sir...frankly..I do....You
 
		understand I don't think you mean to frighten them, but
 
		your face...you asked me, sir, and...yes, I do think so.

MR. L:		And I bark, do I?

JO:		I have heard you bark...yes, sir...Perhaps you don't bark
 
		all the time, but you do bark...yes, sir.
 
MR. L:		But with all that....you rather like me, do you?

JO:		Yes, sir. I do. I really do - in spite of everything.
 
MR. L:		(SUDDEN SMILE) And I like you...Will you have a cup of tea?

JO:		Thank you, I had one...I was just going.....

[8]

LAURIE:		(EAGERLY) Wait a minute - I'll walk home with you, Jo.

MR. L:		No, no - you stay indoors, young man -

LAURIE:		But, Grandfath-----

MR. L:		(GALLANT) I should be enchanted to see Miss March home,

		myself....Shall we go, my dear?

JO:		(HAPPILY) Thank you...(FADING) Goodbye, Laurie....

LAURIE:		(STARING AFTER THEM) Goodbye.....

<u>SOUND:		FADING STEPS...DOOR OPENS. CLOSES....WELL OFF MIKE</u>

BROOKE:		(PAUSE...THEN SLIGHTLY OFF) Laurie?...(COMING IN)

		Did she come, Laurie? What happened?

LAURIE:		(SLOWLY, STILL DAZED) You won't believe it, Brooke....

		A miracle.

<u>MUSIC:		ACCENTS...AND DOWN, TO CONTINUE UNDER:</u>

MARMEE:		(SOFTLY) Yes....it was a miracle...Our home, that for

		so many months had known only the voices of my little

		women, now frequently echoed to men's voices, too... Mr.

		Laurence was suddenly quite neighborly. And Laurie was

		a constant visitor....Brooke came with him, too, as a

		rule. It wasn't hard to see why....The way he and Meg

		smiled at each other made me happy - and a little sad...

		Young Laurie smiled at Joe the same way. But the months

		went by, and she gave him no encouragement......Jo was

		busy, you see....(SCRATCHING PEN)....She was writing.

		(<u>MUSIC: CUTS</u>)

<u>SOUND:		SCRATCHING PEN HOLDS FOR A MOMENT...STOPS</u>

[9]

JO: 		(READING) 'And yet 'tis whispered that when the gondolas

		glide through the fatal waters, these same waters still

		run crimson with the blood of Lady Viella and her gallant

 		lover, slain by the phantom hand...(A SOB)....The End!

		(SHE SOBS)

BETH: 		(SLIGHTLY OFF, WONDERING) Jo - ?

JO:		(CONTROLLING SOBS) Yes, Beth...Come in....

BETH:		(COMING IN) You're crying....What's the matter?

JO:		My story.

BETH: 		(SYMPATHETIC) Oh....Poor Jo... Is it that, bad?

JO:		It's wonderful!

BETH:		(BEWILDERED) Oh .... Well, Laurie's waiting for you

		downstairs. 

JO:		Oh, bilge! I <u>told</u> him not to bother me!

BETH:		He says he's going to wait until you come down.

JO:		Let him! I wish he'd realize I haven't time for his

		nonsense.

BETH:		But he's waiting, Jo! What'll I tell him?

JO:		Tell him I went up in smoke.

BETH:		(WORRIED) You aren't really, are you?

JO:		(LAUGHS) No, my darling...(FIRM) But I am simply <u>not</u>

		coming down. And the sooner Mr. Laurence understands

		that - (<u>DOOR FLINGS OPEN, SLIGHTLY OFF</u>

MEG:		(SLIGHTLY OFF, AGITATED) Jo - Beth - !

JO:		(QUICKLY) Meg - what is it?

MEG:		(COMING IN) Oh, it's dreadful, Jo! A telegram from

		the Army......

[10]

JO:		Father ! --

MEG: 		He's in the hospital - in Washington. Marmee's leaving at

		once. You'd better come down.

<u>MUSIC:		SHARP CHORD...AND FADE OUT INTO</u>

GROUP:		(BUZZ OF VOICES...ENTIRE FAMILY)

MARMEE:		(DISTRACTED, TIRED) There....I think I'm all packed now...

		Mr. Brooke, if you'll carry the suitcase out...

BROOKE:		I'll be glad to, Mrs. March.

MEG:		I'll help you, Brooke.

MARMEE:		(TROUBLED) I do wish Jo would come back. She's been gone

		since -    (<u>DOOR SLAMS, OFF</u>)

LAURIE:		That must be Jo - she <u>always</u> slams the door!

MARMEE:		(CALLS) Jo? Is that you? We're here in the -

AUNT M:		(SLIGHTLY OFF) Nonsense! Can't you see it's not Jo!

MARMEE:		Aunt March!

AUNT M:		(COMING IN) Well? Where's that bad-tempered daughter of

		yours?

MARMEE:		I thought she was with you!

AUNT M:		Well, she isn't ....(GRUFF) Here - take this envelope.

		You'll need more than you asked for. There'll be other

		expenses besides your train fare.

MARMEE:		Thank you, Aunt March...(PUZZLED) But why didn't Jo bring

		it?

AUNT M:		Because we had words, that's why! As always she was rude

		and impolite. She ran out before I could - (<u>DOOR SLAMS OFF</u>)                                       

[11]

JO:		(OFF) Marmee!....

AMY:		There she is !....(CALLS) In here, Jo!

JO:		(COMING IN, BREATHLESS) I've been running so, I -

		Aunt March!

AUNT M:		Yes, Miss. I had to get dressed and ride all the way

		over here, just because you were so obstinate.

JO:		But, Aunt March....

AUNT M:		I'm not interested in explanations! (FADING) Good

		day!....(<u>FADING STEPS..DOOR SLAMS, OFF...UNDER:</u>)

AMY:		Jo, where have you been?

BETH:		Yes, we were worried!

JO:		(EMBARRASSED) Well, Aunt March croaked as she always

		does, and I lost my temper....so I decided to get some

		money on my own....Here, Marmee. This will pay for

		your fare.

MARMEE:		Thirty dollars!....Where did you get it?

JO:		(QUICKLY) I didn't beg, borrow or steal. I only sold

		what belonged to me.

MARMEE:		What?

JO:		Well..if I take my bonnet off....

MARMEE:		Your hair!....Your beautiful hair!....Oh, my Jo!

BETH:		(NEAR TEARS) Your beautiful, beautiful hair!

JO:		Now don't wail, Beth. It doesn't affect the fate of

		the nation....Really, I like it short.

LAURIE:		Christopher Columbus! You look like a porcupine!

JO:		Really? I feel deliciously light and cool.

LAURIE:		But, Jo -

[12]

MARMEE:		(GENTLY) Laurie, dear.... her hair will grow back....and

		it'll be as lovely as ever .... But, Laurie, she'll never be

		more beautiful than she is now.

BROOKE:		(SLIGHTLY OFF) Mrs. March, you'd better come along.

		Mr. Laurence has the carriage outside.

MARMEE:		Yes - yes, I'm coming ... Amy - Beth - Jo - take care of

		things...(FADING) Goodbye, my darlings...

AMY: )		Goodbye, Marmee...
     )
BETH:)		Goodbye...(<u>DOOR CLOSES...OFF</u>)

JO:		(SOFTLY) Goodbye, Marmee...(BREAKING) Goodbye ....

BETH:		(SOFTLY) Don't cry, Jo...Father will be all right...

JO:		(SOBBING) I'm not crying for father, Beth....

AMY:		What then?

JO:		(SOBBING) My hair!

<u>MIDDLE COMMERCIAL</u>

SMITH:		Now a brief intermission, and time for a smoke! Are

		you enjoying a mild cigarette?

QUARTET:	How mild,

		How mild,

		How mild can a cigarette be?

		Make the Camel thirty-day test                                        

		And you'll see!

SMITH:		Not one single case of throat irritation due to smoking

		Camels - that's what noted throat specialists reported

		in a coast-to-coast smoking test!

BARCLAY: 	Hundreds of men and women made the test. They smoked an

		average of one to two packs of Camels a day -- Camels

		exclusively! Each week, noted throat specialists

		examined their throats carefully and they reported not

		one single case of throat irritation due to smoking

		Camels!

SMITH:		Find out for yourself how mild Camels are by making a

		thirty-day test of your own. You'll enjoy the rich,

		full flavor of Camel's costly tobaccos -- and you'll know

		how mild a cigarette can be!

BARCLAY: 	Make a note. Remember your throat. Try Camels today!

SMITH:		Camel cigarettes now present the Screen Guild Players in

		Act II of "Little Women" starring June Allyson and

		Peter Lawford.

MARMEE:		(SOFTLY) Dear, gallant Jo...the bravest of my little women..

		the one who loved us most..Dear Jo, who could dream

		thousand new stories - and never see the ending of our own.

		I was sitting in my room that day. Their father had been

		home for a week, and at last I'd gotten back to my sewing...

		She burst into the room like a hurricane! And when I looked

		up startled -- (<u>MUSIC CUTS</u>)

JO:		(DESPERATE, ANGUISHED) Marmee, do something - go downstairs

		quick! Brooke is kissing Meg! And Marmee - she likes it!

<u>MUSIC:		FADES OUT INTO:</u>

LAURIE:		(GENTLY) Jo..(NO ANSWER) Jo!?

JO:		(TONELESS) Yes, Laurie..

LAURIE:		I saw you leave the wedding and come outside...I thought

		perhaps you wouldn't mind if I came out too....

JO:		(TONELESS) No, I don't mind...

LAURIE:		(TRYING TO RALLY HER) Don't feel badly, Jo. Even if Meg is

		married, you know, you've still got me..of course, I'm not

		good for much, but I'll stand by you all the days of my life.

JO:		(NEAR TEARS) I know you will. You don't know what a comfort

		you are to me, Laurie.

LAURIE:		Jo...will you listen to what I want to tell you?

JO:		(FRIGHTENED) No..no, Laurie...don't say it...don't

LAURIE:		I will, and you must hear me..it's no use, Jo. We've got

		to have it out, and the sooner the better.

JO:		(CONTROLLED) All right..say what you like, then..I'll

		listen.

[15]

LAURIE:		I've loved you ever since I've known you, Jo. Couldn't help

		it. I've tried to show you, but you wouldn't let me. Now

		I'm going to make you hear, and give me an answer.

JO:		Laurie...Laurie...I wanted to save you this...I never wanted

		you to care for me so...

LAURIE:		I know I'm not half good enough for you, Jo, but - well - if

		you love me, you can make me anything you like.

JO:		(GENTLY) I wouldn't change you, Laurie... I wouldn't change

		you at all...

LAURIE:		Then Jo - please!

JO:		Oh, Laurie... I'm so sorry...so desperately sorry... But I

		can't say I love you when I don't...

LAURIE:		Really and truly, Jo?

JO:		Really and truly, Laurie... I don't think I'll ever marry.

[16]

LAURIE:		(PASSIONATELY) Oh yes, you will - I know you will! You'll

		meet some good-for-nothing no-account fool, and you'll

		fall in love, and you'll work and live and die for him!

		I know you will because it's just your way! And I'll have

		to stand by and see it!... (ABRUPT FADE) Well, I'll be

		hanged if I do!

JO:		(ALARMED, CALLS) Laurie - where are you going?

LAURIE:		(OFF, SAVAGELY) To the devil!

<u>MUSIC:		SHARP CHORD...AND DOWN, TO CONTINUE UNDER</u>:

MARMEE: 	(SAD SMILE) Laurie didn't go to the devil... He went to

		Europe instead. And when Aunt March went over the

		following month, my Jo was faced with her first great

		problem - whether to go to Europe with Aunt March, or to

		go to New York as I had promised her - to live and work

		and write in her spare time... (<u>MUSIC RESOLVES INTO PIANO</u>)

		She chose Now York.

<u>MUSIC:		PIANO HOLDS BRIEFLY, THEN CUTS, AS: (BOOK FALLS)</u>:

BHAER:		(PUZZLED) Yes?...

JO:		Oh, I'm sorry - I dropped my book - I...I'm the new

		governess - I'm Josephine March - do you live here, too?

[17]

BHAER:		(SMILING) Ja - my name is Friedrich Bhaer..They call me

		Professor - I, too, teach...

JO:		How splendid! But of course that isn't all I do..I'm really

		a writer - a professional one.

BHAER:		So?

JO:		Oh, yes! But I do wish you hadn't stopped playing. It was

		so beautiful...What is it?

BHAER:		It is a song, really - the words are by Goethe.."Nur wer

		die Sehnsucht kennt"...do you understand German?

JO:		No, I don't.

BHAER:		Then I will try to say them for you in English..(<u>PIANO</u>

		<u>STARTS SOFTLY</u>) Let me see now.. 'Nur wer die Sehnsucht 

		kennt'...'Only who knows what longing is'..'Weis was Ich

		leide'...'can know what I suffer'...'Allein'...'alone and

		parted far from joy and gladness..my senses fail, a burning 

		fire devours me....'

JO:		(SOFTLY) 'My senses fail, a burning fire devours me'...

		(<u>MUSIC STOPS</u>) If only I could write something like that -

		something that would set other hearts on fire!... 

BHAER:		You truly like to write, then?

JO:		Oh, yes! Writing is my life! I've scribbled ever since I was

		a child!...Some of my stories have been published. And I just

		sold another to the Weekly Volcano.

BHAER:		The Weekly Volcano?..You must forgive my ignorance, but -

		what is that?

JO:		Why, it's a magazine, of course!

BHAER:		Oh..(SMILES) You see, one can always learn...

JO:		Yes, indeed! That's why I came to New York - to see and hear

		and learn ....

[18]

BHAER:		(SMILING) Then perhaps we can be of help to each other...I

		mean - well, since we are both to be living here anyway -

		perhaps you can teach me about magazines - and I can teach

		you about music - yes?

JO:		(FERVENT) Oh, yes! I think that would be wonderful!

<u>MUSIC:		ACCENTS..AND DOWN, TO CONTINUE UNDER</u>:

<u>SOUND:		SCRATCHING PEN... TO HOLD UNDER</u>:

JO: 		(AS SHE WRITES) '..And Marmee, you have no idea of how

		exciting these months have been..Of course, Amy is learning

		a good deal in Europe, but I doubt if she's had such a

		teacher as I have..Professor Bhaer continues to be ever so

		kind. One week he takes me to the theatre - and another to

		the Opera - and it's all so wonderful..Sometimes I feel I've

		known him all my life, when it really hasn't been quite a

		year..of course, that's because we talk so much..At least

		<u>I</u> talk.. I'm sure that by now he knows every one of you

		through me - Meg and Amy and Beth - and you and father -

		and even Laurie.. Only, he's always so quiet when I talk of

		Laurie..But I am running out of things to tell him, so you

		had better send me some news..Your letter says that Beth

		isn't well..I'm sure it will prove nothing serious..(<u>FADING</u>

		<u>AS MUSIC BULLS</u>) Be sure to keep me informed about her...

		Write me often..I miss you so much..With all I have here,

		I miss you dreadfully ....

<u>MUSIC:		UP FULL..AND FADE OUT INTO</u>:

BHAER:		(SLIGHTLY OFF, HESITANT) Miss Josephine?...

JO:		(STRANGELY LISTLESS) Yes, Professor Bhaer?

BHAER:		(COMING IN) May I come in? I want to talk to you..(AWKWARDLY)

		I - I read your latest story in the Volcano..as I promised..

[19]

JO:		(BRIGHTENS A LITTLE) Did you like it?

BHAER:		Miss Josephine, I must be honest with you..I was

		disappointed.

JO:		Oh....

BHAER:		Why do you write such artificial characters - such

		contrived plots?.. 'The Duke's Vengeance'.. villains,

		murderers, fainting women...

JO:		(SOBS SUDDENLY)

BHAER:		Oh, Miss Josephine - please - I am so sorry - I didn't want

		to hurt you...

JO:		(SOBBING) It isn't you..It has nothing to do with you..I -

		I had a letter..

BHAER:		(ANGRY WITH SELF) You have had bad news - and then a stupid

		professor comes blundering and makes things worse!

JO:		(CONTROLLING SELF) No, I want the truth. If I can't stand

		the truth, I'm not worth anything..Please...

BHAER:		Well - first I say to myself, maybe I have no right to

		speak..But then I say, I maybe have no right to be silent..

		because she has talent.

JO:		You really think so?

BHAER:		Otherwise I would not say it. You know that..and I say to
 
		you, even sweep mud in the street before you are false to
 
		that talent! Only say to yourself, I will never write one
 
		single line which I have not felt first in my own heart!...

		(GENTLY) You will do that, my little friend?

JO:		I - I'll try...

BHAER:		You will write about the simple, beautiful things you know?

JO:		(SLOW) The things I know..the things I've seen all my life

		.. (PAUSE, QUIETLY) I'm going home.

[20]

BHAER:		(STRICKEN) Home? You are leaving us?

JO:		(SIMPLY) That's why I was crying - it was in the letter...

		My family needs me. Beth is sick.

<u>MUSIC:		SHARP CHORD...AND DOWN TO CONT. UNDER</u>:

MARMEE:		(SOFTLY) Beth was very sick...We lost her the week after

		Jo came home......Those were sad, dark months for me...my

		heart was heavy for the one who had gone - and heavier

		still for the one who remained..My Jo was so changed -

		so quiet now...Day after day she closed her door on us,

		and I could hear the scratching of her pen as she wrote..

		it was as though she lived only for her work, nothing

		else. Even when I told her the news from Europe...

		(<u>MUSIC CUTS</u>)

JO:		Oh, but Marmee - that's wonderful!.. Laurie and Amy - why,

		they were meant for each other! Really, I couldn't be
 
		happier!

MARMEE: 	(QUIETLY) And a few months from now when they come back

		as man and wife ..... Jo - are you sure?                                    

JO:		(SURPRISED) Of course I'm sure...(SMILES) Oh, I know

		what you're thinking. But you're wrong, Marmee. All that

		matters now is my writing.. (PROUDLY) In fact, I'm off to

		the Post Office this very moment.

MARMEE:		The Post Office --?

JO: 		To mail my novel. It's finished. I'm sending it off ....
 
		(SMILES) You can read it when it comes back.

MARMEE:		Maybe it won't come back - maybe they'll publish it, Jo!

JO: 		Oh, I'm not sending it to a publisher. I'm sending it to

		Professor Bhaer.

[21]

MARMEE:		Professor Bhaer? Why?

JO:		(QUIETLY) Because I promised him.

<u>MUSIC:		(ACCENTS..AND FADES OUT INTO:</u>)
  
JO:		(HAPPILY) Amy, you look simply wonderful! Europe and

		marriage both agreed with you, I think! Now, tell me all

LAURIE:		(COMING IN) Here you are, Jo, dear - something for you.

JO:		How nice! ...Thank you, Laurie ....
 
LAURIE:		Oh, it isn't from me.
 
JO:		Then - what -- ?

AMY:		Open it, Jo - don't just look at it!

<u>SOUND: 		PAPER WRAPPER BEING PULLED OFF</u>

JO:		(UNWRAPPING IT) I can't imagine what..Why, it's a book! 

MARMEE:		'My Beth'...by Josephine March....

ALL:		(AD LIB) Jo, it's your book!...They published it!...How

		wonderful!.. Published!....

JO:		(TIGHT, TENSE) Laurie - who left this with you?

LAURIE:		A man. He had a sort of accent. He ---

JO:		Where is he?

LAURIE:		He wouldn't come in. He went away.

JO:		Oh, no! He couldn't have! (FADING) He <u>couldn't</u> have!...

JO:		(OFF, SHOUTING) Professor Bhaer!..Professor Bhaer - wait!

		..(COMING IN) I don't understand! You were going away

		without even seeing me? ....

BHAER:		I - I didn't want to intrude..You have guests...

JO:		Just my family - and they want to meet you.

BHAER:		No, please - I think --

JO:		You see, we're having a sort of party. My sister Amy just

		got back from Europe - she is married to that boy I told you

		about and --

BHAER:		(CUTS IN, TENSE) To - to that Laurie?

JO:		Yes, that's the one - so you see --

BHAER:		But - But I always thought that - you and he --

JO:		You <u>couldn't</u> have! I <u>told</u> you!

BHAER:		(VOICE TREMBLING) Yes..Yes, you told me.

JO:		It's the first time we've all been together in ages, so you

		must come in and -- (<u>MUSIC SNEAKS IN UNDER</u>:)

BHAER:		<u>Please</u>..please - just a minute before - that is - I have

		something to say to you..I mean, would you - Oh, I have no

		right to think you will -- but dare I hope that you and I --
 
		I know I should not ask - you are so young, lovely, so alive

 		- and I have so little to give you - nothing but my heart
 
		which is so full and these empty hands...

JO:		(SOFTLY, SIMPLY) They <u>won't</u> be empty..if I put <u>my</u> hands in

<u>CLOSING COMMERCIAL</u>

SMITH:		Our stars Peter Lawford and June Allyson will return to 

		the microphone in just a moment.

QUARTET:	How mild,

		How mild,

		How mild can a cigarette be?

		Make the Camel thirty-day test

		And you'll see....

		Smoke Camels and see!

SMITH:		Yes, smoke Camels and see how mild, how flavorful,

		how thoroughly enjoyable a cigarette can be!

BARCLAY:	Among the millions who enjoy Camels are many, many

		doctors. More doctors smoke Camels than any other

		cigarette, according to a nationwide survey. One hundred

		thirteen thousand, five hundred and ninety-seven doctors

		were asked, what cigarette they smoked. The brand named

		most was Camel!

SMITH:		Say, friends, there's still time to buy the Camel
                                                      
		Christmas carton for the smokers on your list. It's

		bright and cheery, with a space right on the carton for

		your greeting.

<u>MUSIC:		TAG</u>

[24]

SMITH:		And now a final word of thanks to our stars who have

		found the time in this busy season to come and appear in

		the Screen Guild Theatre tonight...June and Peter -

		believe me, you've made this a Merry Christmas for all

		of us.

ALLYSON:	Thank you, Verne, but I can't help but think of the many

		people whose lives are brightened all year round by the

		Motion Picture Relief Fund and it's Country House and

		Hospital - the greatest cause in our industry. That's

		one reason why all of us in Hollywood are happy to

		appear on this radio program and share in the fine work

		it makes possible.

LAWFORD: 	Yes, that's one reason, June. The other is a swell

		sponsor. Each week the makers of Camels send gift

		cigarettes to servicemen's and Veterans' hospitals.

		This week, the Camels go to: Veterans' Hospitals,

		Mountain Home, Tennessee and McKinney, Texas....U.S.Army

		Station Hospital, Camp Kilmer, New Jersey....and U.S.

		Naval Hospital, Jacksonville, Florida.

ALLYSON:	Happy smoking, fellows. Your free cigarettes are on

		their way to you now with the compliments of Camels!

LAWFORD: 	And a Merry, Merry Christmas to all of you!

		(APPLAUSE)

<u>MUSIC:		THEME</u>
