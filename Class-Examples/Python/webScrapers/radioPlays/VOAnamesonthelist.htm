ANNOUNCER: The Voice of the Army!

MUSIC: MARCH THEME ... THEN BEHIND SINGER--

SINGER:
The Voice of the Army is on the air
Calling Americans everywhere!
Maybe you're just the one we are looking for
To volunteer and help win the war!
While our brave soldiers fight throughout the universe
Won't you serve as a U. S. Army nurse?
The Voice of the Army is calling you 
To get in step with the march to victory!

MUSIC: UP AND OUT

ANNOUNCER: Today, "The Voice of the Army" presents the distinguished American 
actress Miss Helen Hayes in a story of the U. S. Army Nurse Corps. It's with 
considerable pride that we present Miss Hayes as Lieutenant Margaret English 
in "Names on the List."

MUSIC: WARM INTRODUCTION ... STRINGS ... GENTLY OUT BEHIND--

MARGARET: Hello, soldier. (TO HERSELF) Let's see, Private Alan Wickes. (TO 
ALAN) Hello, Alan.

ALAN: (UNHAPPY) I suppose I gotta talk or you'll be sayin', "Cat got ya 
tongue?" That's what the other one always said. "Cat got ya tongue?" 

MARGARET: No. No, you don't have to talk if you don't want to.

ALAN: That's good. (BEAT) You the new nurse?

MARGARET: (YES) Mm hm.

ALAN: Oh.

MARGARET: Want a light?

ALAN: (QUICKLY, DEFENSIVELY) I can manage.

SOUND: MATCH STRIKES

MARGARET: That's an interesting-looking pipe.

ALAN: Yeah.

MARGARET: Get it over there?

ALAN: Yeah.

MARGARET: Collect pipes?

ALAN: (ANNOYED) Look ---- it's a pipe. I smoke pipes. I've always smoked 
pipes. It's interesting-looking and I got it over there. It was my best 
friend's. He was killed.

MARGARET: Oh. I'm sorry, Alan.

ALAN: Sure. You're sorry, I'm sorry, he's sorry. I lost an arm; maybe we're 
sorry about that, too. Let's let it go at that.

MARGARET: We're going to be able to do something for you.

ALAN: Here it comes. (EXHALES) Lesson Number One: Point out to the patient 
advances made in modern prosthetics. Tell him one of those grappling hook arms 
is just as good as the real thing; better even! All right, maybe it is! Only 
let's not talk about it. See?

MUSIC: SYMPATHETIC BRIDGE

COLONEL: Well, nurse? How's it going?

MARGARET: With the boy?

COLONEL: (YES) Mm hm.

MARGARET: Not too well, Colonel.

COLONEL: I told you it wouldn't be--

MARGARET: (COMPLETES THE SENTENCE) --exactly easy. No, it isn't.

COLONEL: (BEAT) And, uh, how's it going with you?

MARGARET: I'm all right. It's kind of hard at mail time. Dick used to write so 
regularly. I'd always know there'd be a letter from him.

COLONEL: Of course.

MARGARET: I got several letters -- even after the news that he was missing. 
That was the hardest of all. (BEAT) Then <u>they</u> stopped coming, too.

COLONEL: I know.

MARGARET: But I'm so sure he's safe. It <u>couldn't</u> happen to us. I read the poem 
and I <u>know</u> it couldn't happen to us.

COLONEL: (PUZZLED) You read the poem?

MARGARET: Oh, yes. "How do I love thee?"

COLONEL: Hm?

MARGARET: Elizabeth Barrett Browning.

COLONEL: (UNDERSTANDS) Oh. Oh, "How do I love thee? Let me count the ways." Mm 
hm.

MARGARET: You see, that's how we happened to meet, Dick and I. I guess I never 
told you about that.

COLONEL: No.

MARGARET: It's really just one of those sentimental stories that sound silly 
to everybody except the people it happened to. For them, it's important.

COLONEL: Tell me about it.

MARGARET: Really?

COLONEL: (YES) Mm hm.

MARGARET: Well, it was way back when I was a student nurse in New York. That 
seems a hundred years ago now.

COLONEL: (CHUCKLES QUIETLY)

MARGARET: That day, I was looking over the ten-cent counter of a little 
secondhand bookstore down in Greenwich Village; you know the kind. And then I 
heard someone asking for Mrs. Browning's "Sonnets."

DICK: (SLIGHTLY OFF) It was a little blue book. It was here last week. Er, 
"Sonnets from the Portuguese."

MARGARET: I looked around. It was a young man. (SLOWLY) A very nice-looking 
young man, I thought, with curly brown hair, and a nose that turned up just a 
little at the end, and a lovely smile.

DICK: (CLOSER) It was, uh, right on this shelf somewhere.

CLERK: (MUSES) "Sonnets from the Portuguese." Er-- Ah, yes. There - there it 
is. The young lady has it.

MARGARET: (SURPRISED) Oh.

CLERK: Did you wish to buy it, miss?

MARGARET: Well, I--

DICK: (TO CLERK) Oh, that's all right. Please. I - I wouldn't think of--

MARGARET: But it's quite all right. If you'd like it, why--

DICK: No, I, er, wouldn't dream of--

MARGARET: But really, I--

DICK: No, I assure you. I-- (CHUCKLES)

MARGARET: (CHUCKLES)

CLERK: Well, if either of you wants it, it's ten cents.

MARGARET: (CHUCKLES)

DICK: Look, I, er, have a wonderful idea. Let's buy it together. We'll each 
put up five cents and we'll each own a fifty percent interest. Fifty-fifty, 
what do you say? (FADES OUT)

MARGARET: (TO COLONEL) We each put up our five cents, Colonel, just as crazily 
as that.

COLONEL: (CHUCKLES)

MARGARET: And Dick decided we'd have to go to lunch together to discuss the 
details of our partnership. And then-- Well, three months later we were 
married. (LIGHTLY) And I always teased Dick by saying, the only reason we <u>were</u> 
- was to put an end to the eternal problem of the custody of Mrs. Browning.

COLONEL: (CHUCKLES) That's wonderful.

MARGARET: Well, I like this little book. (DEEPLY) Especially now.

COLONEL: That's the same one?

MARGARET: The same. Faded blue cover -- faded a little more. I always like to 
have it with me. (BEAT, LIGHTLY) Well, guess I'd better go on up to our 
problem child.

COLONEL: (LIGHTLY) Not going to try poetry on him, now? 

MARGARET: (MERRILY) I might.

MUSIC: ROMANTIC BRIDGE

MARGARET: Hello, Alan.

ALAN: Hello.

MARGARET: You don't have to talk. I'm just going to sit here for a while and 
read, if you don't mind.

ALAN: I don't mind. (BEAT) What are you reading?

MARGARET: (BEAT) A book.

ALAN: What book?

MARGARET: I don't think you'd like it.

ALAN: How do you know I wouldn't like it?

MARGARET: It's poetry.

ALAN: What makes you think I wouldn't like a book of poetry?

MARGARET: I don't know. I just didn't think so.

ALAN: (BEAT) Why don't--? Why don't ya--? (DISMISSIVE, "NEVER MIND") Ahhhh, 
no.

MARGARET: What? Go ahead.

ALAN: Well-- Why don't you read out loud? (BEAT) Would you mind?

MARGARET: (PAUSE, THEN READS) 
How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of being and ideal grace.

SOUND: TURNS PAGE OF BOOK

MARGARET: (READS) 
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candle-light.
I love thee freely, as men strive for right.
I love thee purely, as men turn from praise.
I love thee with the passion put to use
In my old griefs, and my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints. I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life; and, if God choose,
I shall but love thee better after death.
(BEAT, TO ALAN) 
Well?

ALAN: Well?

MARGARET: (DREAMILY) It just kinda does something to ya, doesn't it?

ALAN: (BITTERLY) Yeah, it does something to ya, all right. It turns your 
stomach; all that phony sentimentality!

MARGARET: (SHOCKED) Alan, I thought you wanted me to read it.

ALAN: Sure. I went for that sort of thing once, but I forgot. Anyway, who do 
you think you're kidding? (MOCKINGLY) "How do I love thee? Let me count the 
ways." (DISGUSTED) Sure, I love thee -- with one arm!

MARGARET: (REPRESSED ANGER) I'm sorry it doesn't mean anything to you, because 
it means a great deal to me.

ALAN: (EXPLODES, QUICKLY) Well, why don't you do something?! Why don't you 
slam the book down and stalk out and report me to the colonel?! Why don'tcha?!

MARGARET: (SUDDENLY SYMPATHETIC) I don't want to. (BEAT) Alan, why do you keep 
fighting inside yourself? Why don't you let us try?

ALAN: Why don't you--?! (TEARFUL) Why don't you leave me alone?

MUSIC: STORMY BRIDGE

COLONEL: Private Wickes?

ALAN: Yes, Colonel?

COLONEL: There's something I must speak to you about.

ALAN: Oh. I suppose she told you I was rude to her yesterday.

COLONEL: No. No, Lieutenant English didn't say anything. She wouldn't.

ALAN: Huh?

COLONEL: (POINTEDLY) It so happens that Lieutenant English -- who's husband 
has been missing for six weeks -- got word late last night that he had been 
killed in action. (BEAT, CRISPLY) If you can't feel any consideration for her, 
I hope at least you can be civil. (MORE CASUAL) That's all I wanted to say. Of 
course, um, you won't mention this to her. You understand? You don't know 
about it.

ALAN: (MOVED, CHASTENED) No, sir. I don't know - a thing about it.

MUSIC: SYMPATHETIC BRIDGE

MARGARET: Hello, Alan.

ALAN: (SURPRISED, FRIENDLY) Oh. I wondered if you'd come in.

MARGARET: Did you?

ALAN: Yeah. (BEAT) I'm a pretty tough patient.

MARGARET: (NO KIDDING) No. (BEAT) Can I puff your pillows up a bit?

ALAN: Don't bother.

MARGARET: Oh, I'm sorry, I keep forgetting.

ALAN: No, I didn't mean that; I just meant-- I didn't want ya to bother.

MARGARET: No bother. Here.

ALAN: (BEAT, EXHALES) Thanks.

MARGARET: (SURPRISED) Hm?

ALAN: (EXHALES SELF-CONSCIOUSLY) Thanks. (BEAT) Would you hand me my pipe?

MARGARET: Here you are. Oh, it's a different one.

ALAN: Uh, I - I'm still so clumsy; spilling matches on the floor. Would you--?

MARGARET: Of course.

SOUND: MATCHBOX OPENS ... MATCH STRIKES ... PIPE LIT

ALAN: (PUFFS, EXHALES) That's good. I like a pipe. I got whole collection back 
home.

MARGARET: Have you a meerschaum?

ALAN: You <u>know</u> about pipes?

MARGARET: My husband-- (BEAT) My husband was very fond of pipes, too.

ALAN: Yeah, I've got a meerschaum. (BEAT) Nurse?

MARGARET: Yes, Alan?

ALAN: Would you read to me?

MARGARET: (SURPRISED) Read to you?

ALAN: Yes.

MARGARET: I've nothing to read here.

ALAN: (UNDERSTANDS) Oh. You don't want to.

MARGARET: (INSISTS) I've nothing to read.

ALAN: You've got a book in your pocket.

MARGARET: That's--

ALAN: "Sonnets from the Portuguese."

MARGARET: I'll go get something else.

ALAN: No, read from that.

MARGARET: Well--

ALAN: Read - "How do I love thee?"

MUSIC: SNEAKS IN ... QUIETLY STIRRING

MARGARET: I'll get something else.

ALAN: Please read it to me.

MARGARET: No, I - I--

ALAN: Please. (BEAT) Please?

MARGARET: (PAUSE, THEN READS, INCREASINGLY EMOTIONAL)
How do I love thee? Let me count the ways.
I love thee to the depth and breadth and height
My soul can reach, when feeling out of sight
For the ends of being and ideal grace.
I love thee to the level of every day's
Most quiet need--
(FALTERS, REPEATS THE LINE)
--to the level of every day's
Most quiet need, by sun and candle-light--
(BREAKS DOWN AND WEEPS ... CONTINUES BRIEFLY BEHIND ALAN--)

ALAN: 
I love thee freely, as men strive for right.
I love thee purely, as men turn from praise.
I love thee with the passion put to use
In my old griefs, and with my childhood's faith.
I love thee with a love I seemed to lose
With my lost saints. I love thee with the breath,
Smiles, tears, of all my life; and, if God choose--
(TO MARGARET)
--and, if God choose?

MARGARET: (WITH A NEW STRENGTH) 
--and, if God choose,
I shall but love thee better after death.

MUSIC: UP AND OUT

ANNOUNCER: (SOLEMNLY) Two names on a list. Two men, two soldiers. A Major 
English, a Private Wickes, unknown to each other. And yet -- as you heard -- 
their stories were not wholly unrelated.

MUSIC: BOISTEROUS MARCH THEME ... THEN OUT BEHIND--

ANNOUNCER: You've just listened to "Names on the List," and now we'd like you 
to listen to our star, Miss Helen Hayes, who has a personal message for you 
about the Army Nurse Corps.

HAYES: No American mother can be unmindful of the debt of gratitude we all owe 
to the women of the Army Nurse Corps. Now, as the good news continues to roll 
in in ever-increasing proportions, we must not forget the bad news that 
inevitably must accompany it -- our casualties. As for these wounded men, the 
war will still be with them for a long, long time to come. This is a need only 
registered nurses can fill, but there are <u>other</u> ways of helping. Senior cadet 
nurses may take their final six-months' training in army hospitals and 
graduates of Red Cross training courses may serve as nurse's aides in both 
civilian and military hospitals. The need for army nurses is urgent today. The 
men of our army, and their wives and mothers, ask you to think this over most 
carefully. You're needed now. Won't you help? 

ANNOUNCER: If you will accept an appointment as a lieutenant in the Army Nurse 
Corps, write the Surgeon General, U. S. Army, Washington Twenty-Five, D. C. or 
apply at any Red Cross procurement office.

MUSIC: BOISTEROUS MARCH THEME ... UNTIL END

ANNOUNCER: This closes another program in the series "The Voice of the Army"!
