and a CHURCH CHOIR



ANNOUNCER: And now stay tuned for the program that has rated tops in 
popularity for a longer period of time than any other West Coast program in 
radio history -- the Signal Oil program, "The Whistler," transcribed by the 
Signal Oil Company for Christmas Eve to enable the entire production staff of 
"The Whistler" to spend Christmas Eve at home with their families.

MUSIC: WHISTLER THEME ... FOLLOWED BY DOUBLE DRUM BEAT

ANNOUNCER: (ECHO) Signal, the famous "Go Farther" gasoline, invites you to sit 
back and enjoy another strange story - by The Whistler. 

MUSIC: WHISTLER THEME REPEATED WITH ECHO ... THEN ORCHESTRA IN BG

WHISTLER: I am the Whistler, and I know many things, for I walk by night. I 
know many strange tales hidden in the hearts of men and women who have stepped 
into the shadows. Yes, I know the nameless terrors of which they dare not 
speak.

MUSIC: TYMPANI ROLL ... THEN QUIETLY BEHIND ANNOUNCER--

ANNOUNCER: And now, for the Signal Oil Company, the Whistler brings you a most 
unusual story -- one of the most heartwarming stories of our times, especially 
appealing this Christmas Eve -- "Three Wise Guys."

MUSIC: TAG ... THEN BEHIND WHISTLER--

WHISTLER: 'Twas the night before Christmas and all through the house, not a 
creature was stirring, not even a mouse. Even Broadway, that glamorous avenue 
of make-believe in faraway New York, seemed empty, deserted. Most cafés and 
eating places were closed. But the doors of an occasional refuge for those 
hearty souls who prefer to walk alone were still open. Such a place was Good 
Time Charley's Bar on Forty-Ninth Street where on another Christmas Eve a 
series of unusual events began, ending in one of the most unusual stories Good 
Time Charley had ever listened to. At the moment Charley is listening to the 
voice of a man named Al.

SOUND: CLINK OF GLASSES ... THEN INTERMITTENTLY IN BG

AL: As is well known to one and all, Charley, I am not one to complain, but it 
strikes me that Broadway would bring very little tonight on the open market. 

CHARLEY: I know you ten, maybe fifteen years, Al, and till now I don't know 
you know there <u>is</u> an open market.

AL: Ah ha, for the past twelve months that I know of, I am one hundred percent 
legitimate. Honest, legitimate Al. 

CHARLEY: Want another "rock candy and rye," without the rock candy?

AL: I, er, very seldom indulge in alcoholic beverages. But, in answer to your 
question, <u>yes</u>.

SOUND: BOTTLE ON GLASS AS CHARLEY POURS DRINK

CHARLEY: Haven't seen you for a year, Al. Want to run over that part again 
where you tell me you're playin' it straight for the past twelve months? 

AL: (DRINKS, EXHALES) As of last Christmas Eve, I am a one hundred percent 
honest ticket scalper. I do not make a killin', but I get that good warm 
feelin' that comes with bein' one hundred percent legit.

CHARLEY: It feels good to play it straight? 

AL: Cozy. 

CHARLEY: You wanna tell me about it, Al? 

AL: I do not mind if I do, Good Time Charley. It all begins a year ago tonight 
right here in your strictly high-class drough. Blondy Swanson was here with 
me, remember?

CHARLEY: Yeah, I think I do remember, Al.

AL: Now, Blondy Swanson is one of the gentry which operates on that side of 
the law as very few calls right, though Blondy himself always feels this is a 
matter of opinion. But Blondy is not concerned with his racket a year ago 
tonight. You are busy chauffeuring the bar, Good Time Charley, so maybe you do 
not notice the sad scene. Yep -- it is last year, just about this same time, 
when Blondy comes in here, his big frame pretzeled with grief. 

SOUND: FADE IN CROWDED BAR BACKGROUND

BLONDY: (DEJECTED) Hullo, Al. 

AL: Well, hiya, Blondy. I see you are not so happy tonight. Why not join me in 
a medicinal rock candy and rye? Er, without the rock candy. I am fightin' off 
a touch of grippe.

BLONDY: Okay, Al. I got a bad case of memories tonight. If rye can pack away 
the grippe, maybe it can take a load off my memories.

AL: (CALLS) Hey, Charley?! Two more rock candies and ryes! Er, without the 
rock candy!

CHARLEY: (OFF) I'll slide 'em down.

AL: Are these conversational memories, Blondy, or shall we give 'em the clam?

BLONDY: Do you recall a doll named Clarabelle Cobb, Al? 

AL: Miss Clarabelle Cobb? Of course I do. She is well known to one and all on 
Broadway as a leadin' light with George White's Scandals some years back. 

BLONDY: Yeah. Well, Christmas Eve is an anniversary for me. It was on 
Christmas Eve that Clarabelle left me -- to marry an honest guy in Akron, 
Ohio. 

SOUND: DRINKS SLIDE DOWN THE BAR

CHARLEY: (OFF) There ya are.

AL: Oh. Drink up, Blondy. 

SOUND: AL AND BLONDY DRINK AND EXHALE

AL: Up to now, I remember Miss Clarabelle Cobb as a doll with Class A 
judgment. Why did she put distance between her and you?

BLONDY: Well, Clarabelle was a gal that didn't care as much about how <u>much</u> 
money you had as she did where you got it. She felt that my roll was ample, 
but tainted.

AL: This is why she puts on the exit? 

BLONDY: Right. I can see now that she was right, but now it's too late.

AL: But there must be other dolls as beautiful and desirable -- and not such 
quizmasters as to where the scratch comes from.

BLONDY: I'll never look at another doll again, Al! They're - they're for other 
guys.

SOUNDS: DUTCHMAN'S STEPS APPROACH BEHIND-- 

DUTCHMAN: Hey, Blondy! 

BLONDY: Huh?

DUTCHMAN: Blondy Swanson! 

BLONDY: (PLEASED) Well, if it ain't the Dutchman! Well, look, Al! 

DUTCHMAN: Hi, Al, Blondy. Yuletides all around. 

AL: Why, I cannot believe my eyes, Dutchman. I have not seen you in these 
parts for maybe a whole calendar or so. 

DUTCHMAN: I've been detained in the west. Oh, it's a sad story. And I can see 
that all you two guys need is one more sad story. But you're not gonna hear 
none. I got good news for ya.

BLONDY: Then you have come to the right place, Dutchman. I always get kinda 
down on Christmas Eve.

DUTCHMAN: What I'm gonna tell ya, will give ya a big lift. Blondy, you and me 
have pulled a few fast deals together, but I got one tonight that's the 
softest touch of all. Oh, you can listen, Al. We'll cut you in, too.

AL: Oh, ho ho! I have turned down soft touches before. But, not wishing to be 
rude, I will hear you out.

DUTCHMAN: Some months back, three others guys and me knocked off a tin safe in 
a factory over in Pennsylvania. It was a cinch haul on account of we received 
a dead center tip. The tip was on the level. So we stashed fifty G's in our 
grip sack and get set to hit the open road.

BLONDY: Somethin' detained ya? 

DUTCHMAN: The cops. After hot blastin' from both sides, I find myself alone, 
on the lam, with fifty G's in the grip sack. But it's not a clean getaway, and 
I figure it's better to find a hidin' place for the dough, not wantin' to be 
caught with the goods.

AL: I am beginnin' to get the idea. You're suggestin' that the three of us go 
for this dough tonight and cut it three ways.

DUTCHMAN: That's the idea. It's in an unpopulated barn, under the floorboards. 
When I decide to go get it, the first guy I think of is you, Blondy. How about 
it?

BLONDY: I must admit I got no other plans, Dutchman. Nice of you to think of 
me. Count me in.

DUTCHMAN: How 'bout you, Al?

AL: Er, I am not generally known as a spoilsport, but this prospect frankly 
holds no appeal for me. I do not wish to join the party.

DUTCHMAN: This your final answer? 

AL: Yes, Dutchman. You may quote me. I will not go with you. 

MUSIC: BRIDGE ... QUOTES "WE THREE KINGS" ... THEN BEHIND AL--

AL: (TO CHARLEY) Well, Good Time Charley, that's the way it went. I am <u>certain</u> 
I will not leave your bistro that night, I am negative to the whole scheme, 
and am nixin' it loud and clear to one and all. 

SOUND: RUNNING AUTO INTERIOR BACKGROUND

AL: So imagine my surprise at some later point to find myself warm and cozy in 
the back seat of the Dutchman's ancient velocipede, doggin' it through the 
snow-covered country side. The whole settin' is so peaceful I am catchin' 
small doses of snooze. But in between times I cannot help but overhear the up-
front conversation of Blondy and the Dutchman.

BLONDY: You sure this is the right road, Dutchman? 

DUTCHMAN: Certainly I'm sure. I can fly this road blind if necessary.

BLONDY: You are not flying blind now so you must have noticed that the 
radiator is percolatin' again. I think we better stop and take on another load 
o' snow.

DUTCHMAN: Uhhhh, guess we'll have to. But I sure hate these delays.

SOUND: AUTO ENGINE WINDS DOWN TO A STOP ... CAR DOORS OPEN

MUSIC: FROM OFF, A CHURCH CHOIR SINGS A HYMN ... CONTINUES IN BG

DUTCHMAN: (GROANS AS HE PICKS UP SNOW)

BLONDY: Hey, Dutchman! Listen. (BEAT) Must be comin' from that little church. 

DUTCHMAN: (UNINTERESTED) Yeah, yeah. Come on, help put this snow in the 
radiator. 

BLONDY: Sounds real pretty, that kind of singin'. 

DUTCHMAN: You think that's pretty? Wait till ya hear real music -- the kind 
money makes when it's crisp. 

MUSIC: BRIDGE ... QUOTES "WE THREE KINGS"

SOUND: RUNNING AUTO INTERIOR BACKGROUND

AL: (WAKES WITH A SNORT) Hey! Hey, Blondy, Dutchman? Where - where are we? 

DUTCHMAN: In Pennsylvania, Al, not far from that barn where I stashed the 
factory payroll.

AL: How can you tell? I for one see very little but darkness around and about.

BLONDY: I got to agree with Al, Dutchman. I got a feeling we're lost. Maybe we 
better give the whole scheme up.

DUTCHMAN: You two give up easy. I tell ya, I know for certain we're close to 
that barn. I can tell by that big fat star I've been followin' for the last 
few miles.

AL: Oh, yeah. I am seein' a small light ahead, but I observe if this is a 
star, it is hangin' very low to the ground.

BLONDY: I still got a feeling we are lost. Why don't we go back to Good Time 
Charley's, which is a lot easier to find.

DUTCHMAN: I don't care how low this star is hangin'. I know it's leadin' me 
straight. I'm runnin' this show, so you two better seal up. There, look! I'm 
right as rain. This is the barn.

SOUND: AUTO ENGINE WINDS DOWN TO A STOP BEHIND--

AL: I do not wish to start an exchange of words, but that star you followed 
turns out to be nothin' more than a light from the window of said barn.

DUTCHMAN: (CONCEDES) Ah, okay! So somebody's livin' in the barn. I'll take 
care of them if they're too hard to get along with.

SOUND: DURING ABOVE, CAR DOORS OPEN ... FOOTSTEPS THROUGH SNOW TO BARN, IN BG

BLONDY: Uh, I vote for gettin' out o' here.

AL: I am not dressed to call on strangers myself. 

DUTCHMAN: Come on, and cut the gab. 'Sides, maybe there's only animals in the 
barn. I don't see no human footprints in the snow, 'cept ours. 

SOUND: FOOTSTEPS OUT

DUTCHMAN: (BEAT, LOW) I'll be doggone. Look through that window, Blondy. Is 
that a doll in there?

BLONDY: Let me see. (BEAT) Yeah. Yeah, she's a doll. Not only that, I don't 
think she's feelin' in the pink either. Now that we are here, let us go inside 
and see if there's anything we can do for her.

DUTCHMAN: I don't care nothin' about a sick doll. I want to lay my mitts on 
the grip sack with the fifty G's in it. Come on.

SOUND: STEPS TO BARN DOOR, WHICH OPENS ... FOOTSTEPS IN

CLARABELLE: (WEAKLY) Who - who's that? (NO ANSWER, WORRIED) Who <u>are</u> you? 

BLONDY: We mean no harm. We-- 

SOUND: BLONDY TAKES A STEP, THEN STOPS

BLONDY: (DOUBLE TAKE, STUNNED, SLOWLY) We-- Well, for-- If it ain't Miss 
Clarabelle Cobb -- in person. 

MUSIC: FIRST ACT CURTAIN

ANNOUNCER: Friends, to all of you who have opened your homes to "The 
Whistler," not only throughout the year, but even tonight on Christmas Eve, 
the Signal Oil Company has asked me to express their sincere appreciation for 
this privilege and pleasure. And we of the cast want to add our thank you, 
too. During the eight consecutive years that "The Whistler" has been broadcast 
by Signal Oil Company, many of us have celebrated Christmas with many of you a 
number of times. And believe me, we're mighty proud that you consider us part 
of your entertainment family. Tonight on behalf of Signal Oil Company -- and 
the independent Signal dealers who serve you in the states of California, 
Oregon, Washington, Idaho, Nevada, Arizona, and Utah -- I want to convey 
warmest season's greetings. May the many blessings of living in these United 
States of America enrich your holiday season and the New Year. 

MUSIC: WHISTLER THEME ... THEN ORCHESTRA BEHIND WHISTLER--

WHISTLER: Yes, Al, that isolated barn in the snow-swept Pennsylvania 
countryside -- so far removed from Good Time Charley's Bar where you're now 
enjoying Charley's rock candy and rye, without the rock candy -- held a 
surprising development for you, Blondy Swanson, and the Dutchman, didn't it? 
The three of you had driven there that Christmas Eve a year ago to claim the 
fifty thousand dollar payroll the Dutchman had hidden there. The presence of 
Miss Clarabelle Cobb in the barn at your arrival was something not even her 
ex-boyfriend, Blondy Swanson, could fathom immediately. And you were even more 
puzzled than Blondy, weren't you, Al? Only the Dutchman seemed to have the 
faintest understanding of what it's all about -- so you turned to the 
Dutchman.

AL: Dutchman, I am not understandin' all this. Why do you not inform us?

DUTCHMAN: Listen, Al, you and Blondy better clear out of here for a while. 
Take a walk in the snow. I guess I'll have to take care of this doll.

BLONDY: Huh? Hey, look, Dutchman, I haven't seen Clarabelle for a long time. 
If you think I'm gonna leave her now and go for a walk with Al, you are nuts!

AL: Besides which, Dutchman, this doll is clearly at grips with some strange 
malady. I do not think it is polite the three of us should visit in this 
manner at this time.

DUTCHMAN: Listen, I came here to get fifty G's -- not a sick doll and a lot of 
lip from you two. This won't take long, so blow.

BLONDY: But, Dutchman--!

DUTCHMAN: I'm gettin' fed up with you, Blondy. I know what I'm doin'. I've 
delivered seven of the eight kids my wife's had. And I never needed no doctor. 
This one'll be a cinch. Now, will you get out o' here?

MUSIC: BRIDGE

SOUND: AL AND BLONDY'S FOOTSTEPS IN THE SNOW

AL: (SIGHS) I cannot help but say this is quite a night for surprises, Blondy.

BLONDY: Yeah.

AL: I for one can take winter sports or leave them to someone else--

BLONDY: (INTERRUPTS) Al? 

AL: Yeah, Blondy?

BLONDY: We could take the Dutchman's car there. Ya think Clarabelle would be 
better off if we get her a doc?

AL: Well, I am new in this racket, Blondy, but if you want an inexperienced 
opinion, I will say--

BABY: (CRYING, IN THE DISTANCE)

BLONDY: (STARTLED) What was that? 

AL: What? 

BABY: (CRYING, IN THE DISTANCE)

BLONDY: That! 

AL: Well, Blondy, I am new in this racket, but if you want an inexperienced 
opinion, I will say Miss Clarabelle Cobb is a cinch mother. Come on, let's get 
back to the barn. 

SOUND: AL AND BLONDY'S HURRIED FOOTSTEPS IN THE SNOW

MUSIC: BRIDGE

CLARABELLE: (WEEPS, SOBS)

BLONDY: Oh, I wish you wouldn't cry, Clarabelle. No sense cryin'.

CLARABELLE: (TEARFUL) Oh, Blondy--

BLONDY: I know if all of a sudden I found myself with a brand new kid, I 
wouldn't be cryin' -- 'special' since it's such a - such a beautiful kid.

CLARABELLE: You - you really think he's beautiful, Blondy? 

BLONDY: I sure do. (BEAT) He - he's sleepin', huh? 

CLARABELLE: Uh huh. Bless his heart. (SOBS, TEARFUL) If he only gets a break! 

BLONDY: Aw, don't worry about him, Clarabelle. A beautiful kid like that? 
They'll <u>love</u> him in Akron!

CLARABELLE: Oh, Blondy, there's so much I want to tell you. 

BLONDY: Yeah, but maybe <u>you</u> ought to sleep now yourself, huh? 

CLARABELLE: Not till I tell ya, Blondy. You gotta know about everything: Why 
I'm staying here in Dr. Kelton's barn; about Joe, my husband. He's in such 
trouble, Blondy. He-- (SOBS) He's in jail!

DUTCHMAN: (LOW) Come on, Al, let's go find the grip sack. I know right where 
it is.

MUSIC: BRIDGE

DUTCHMAN: Hey, look, Al; this is more like it. 

SOUND: SHUFFLE OF MONEY IN SACK

DUTCHMAN: Yeah, it's all there -- fifty thousand bucks. 

AL: A very likely safe.

DUTCHMAN: Ah, this is all that counts -- a fat swatch of cash. Especially if 
it's mine. Come on, let's get Blondy and clean out of this barn.

SOUNDS: BLONDY'S STEPS APPROACH 

BLONDY: (ANGRY) You ain't goin' anywhere with that dough, Dutchman! 

DUTCHMAN: (BEAT, TENSE) You wanna play that again, Blondy? 

BLONDY: Same song. I said you ain't goin' anywhere with that dough. 

DUTCHMAN: You tell me what he said, Al. I don't like what I'm hearin'.

AL: Blondy has mouthed the same identical words two times around, Dutchman, 
and I for one get the impression he means it.

BLONDY: I do. You didn't tell us the whole story of this dough and how you 
came by it, Dutchman.

DUTCHMAN: Now listen, Blondy--

BLONDY: No, I <u>been</u> listenin'. I heard everything you said about this factory 
payroll job you pulled, and you never did say anything about trussin' up the 
bookkeeper at the factory that night.

DUTCHMAN: So what? 

BLONDY: Not only that, you make it look like it's an inside job and leave the 
bookkeeper to take the rap. 

DUTCHMAN: So? They gotta nail somebody for it. Why are <u>you</u> buildin' such a 
case for this cluck bookkeeper? 

BLONDY: This cluck bookkeeper, Joseph Hatcher, happens to be Clarabelle's 
husband. That's <u>his</u> kid you delivered, Dutchman. 

DUTCHMAN: No kiddin'?

BLONDY: No kiddin'! 

AL: Did - did Miss Clarabelle Cobb tell you all this, Blondy?

BLONDY: She told me plenty. This Joseph Hatcher's been coolin' in the clink 
ever since. He was doin' a special bookkeepin' job for this factory. Came here 
from Akron to do it. He's a right guy, an honest guy. (BEAT) Or can you 
understand that, Dutchman?

DUTCHMAN: Here, Blondy -- here's somethin' honest I understand!

AL: (NERVOUS) Hey!

DUTCHMAN: Yeah, a gun.

AL: Easy, Dutchman. 

DUTCHMAN: Shut up, Al. Now look, Blondy, I've been patient with you. I know 
you're soft for this doll and that's your business, but you're interferin' 
with mine, Blondy, and I don't like that. Now let's get out of here, with the 
dough, and quick. (NO RESPONSE) I said come on, let's get goin'. 

AL: Dutchman, please -- put the iron away. It is not in keepin' with the 
season to pull a heater on Blondy. In addition to which, this shoutin' is apt 
to wake that kid who is a pretty tired character like his mama.

DUTCHMAN: Now <u>you're</u> goin' soft, Al. What's with you two?

BLONDY: Listen, Dutchman. Clarabelle's husband don't know she's livin' in this 
barn. When she heard they'd salted him away on a bum rap, she came here to try 
to help him. Then she found out she was goin' to have a kid and she looked up 
a doc here -- guy named Kelton. Clarabelle's got no dough, but Doc Kelton 
gives her first-rate care, all up to now. Even fixes it so she can stay in his 
barn. It is not great, but it beats livin' in a snowbank.

DUTCHMAN: (A CHANGE OF HEART, HAS HEARD ENOUGH) Ohhhh, stow it, will you? 

AL: (GENTLY) The heater, Dutchman. Hide it, huh? 

DUTCHMAN: (GRUMBLES, THEN RELENTS) Yeah, yeah, okay, okay. But I'm still 
runnin' this show, wise guys, and this is what we do. Blondy, here's the grip 
sack. Take my crate out there and find this Doc Kelton character. Pay him off 
for what he's already done for the doll. Give him some more for takin' care of 
her and the kid from here on in. Then bring the grip sack back here and we'll 
blow. 

BLONDY: (PLEASED) Yeah. You bet, Dutchman. 

DUTCHMAN: And you can tell this doctor a couple of things for me. Tell him to 
get Clarabelle and the kid to a hospital where they belong. 

BLONDY: Sure, Dutchman. Sure!

DUTCHMAN: And tell him till now we didn't need no doc. That the Dutchman took 
care o' things perfect! And that mama and kid are doin' nice. Real nice.

MUSIC: SECOND ACT CURTAIN ("WE THREE KINGS")

ANNOUNCER: For all of you who play canasta, or have been thinking of taking up 
the game, there's a little Christmas gift for you at your nearest Signal 
service station. It's a twelve-page booklet on that exciting new version of 
canasta, Hollywood Three-Deck Canasta, which is replacing the old two-deck 
game practically everywhere it's been tried. In fact, Robert Lee Johnson, the 
only Pacific Coast member of the National Canasta Laws Commission, says of 
this game, "You'll never know how much fun cards can be until you've played 
this exciting new three-deck game. It has completely replaced two-deck canasta 
with all my friends in Hollywood." And, friends, the booklet I mention is 
written by the man who devised this new game, so the rules are both complete 
and authentic. Right now, in fact, this booklet is being sold by leading 
department stores in thirty-two states, but you needn't buy a copy. One is 
waiting for you, free while supply lasts, at any Signal service station. It is 
the hope of your Signal dealer that this fun-packed new version of canasta 
will add to the card-playing pleasure of your holidays. 

MUSIC: TAG ... THEN BEHIND WHISTLER--

WHISTLER: It was almost midnight on Christmas Eve at Good Time Charley's bar 
on West Forty-Ninth Street, as Al continued his amazing account of the story 
of that other Christmas Eve that crossed the lives of Blondy Swanson, Miss 
Clarabelle Cobb and her newborn son, the Dutchman, and his grip sack 
containing fifty thousand dollars. As Al continued talking to Good Time 
Charley, a faraway look came into his eyes.

SOUND: BOTTLE ON GLASS AS CHARLEY POURS ANOTHER DRINK FOR AL

AL: (TO CHARLEY) So you see, Good Time Charley-- (DRINKS, EXHALES) That's 
good.

SOUND: GLASS SET DOWN

AL: (RESUMES, TO CHARLEY) It is no more than small wonder that since all this 
takes place a year ago this very night, me, Blondy, and the Dutchman have 
settled down to one hundred percent legitimate endeavors.

CHARLEY: (UNIMPRESSED) Yeah, sure, and why not? A three-way split on almost 
fifty stolen G's is a cinch beginnin' to the straight and narrow.

AL: (CHUCKLES) You are laboring, as they say, under a misapprehension, Good 
Time Charley. I see now where it is only fair I tell you the rest of this 
story.

MUSIC: BRIDGE ... "WE THREE KINGS" ... THEN BEHIND AL--

AL: (TO CHARLEY) After Blondy makes the deal with Doc Kelton to get Miss 
Clarabelle Cobb and her brand new kid out of that barn and into a Class A 
hospital arrangement, the three of us are once again in the Dutchman's hot 
rod, beatin' it along the streets of some pint-sized burg in Pennsylvania, 
thinkin' to leave this territory for them as wants it.

SOUND: RUNNING AUTO INTERIOR BACKGROUND

DUTCHMAN: Ya know, maybe age is catchin' up with me. I oughta feel great right 
now. We still got nearly fifty thousand clams in that grip sack, but somehow I 
don't feel great at all. You <u>did</u> bring the grip sack back from Doc Kelton's, 
Blondy?

BLONDY: Yeah. Yeah, sure I did, Dutchman. The grip sack's in the back seat 
with Al.

DUTCHMAN: Funny, it don't feel good, and it should. 

AL: Perhaps a touch of rock candy and rye -- er, without the rock candy -- 
would warm your heart, Dutchman. 

DUTCHMAN: Well, maybe so. Pass up the bottle. 

AL: I am willing to do this, but the bottle will be of small comfort -- as it 
is empty.

DUTCHMAN: Oh. Well, thanks for nothin'. Oh, well -- I'll just nudge the motor 
and we'll blow this burg; get back to native territory. New York ought to look 
pretty good.

SOUND: DURING ABOVE, POLICE SIREN FADES IN ... THEN IN BG

BLONDY: Hey! Better slow down, Dutchman. The law is gainin' on ya.

DUTCHMAN: Oh, great. Never saw such a night in my life. 

SOUND: POLICE CAR PULLS ALONGSIDE ... SIREN OUT AS CARS SLOW TO A STOP

OFFICER: (APPROACHES) That red light back there was no Christmas tree 
ornament. You should have stopped. 

MUSIC: DURING ABOVE, ORGAN PLAYS A HYMN, FROM NEARBY CHURCH ... THEN IN BG

DUTCHMAN: Uh, sorry, officer.

OFFICER: And you're in a church zone clearly marked for twenty miles an hour. 
Forty is too much. 

DUTCHMAN: We's hurryin' home for Christmas, officer.

OFFICER: (SKEPTICAL) Carrying toys for the kiddies in this tub, huh? I'll bet. 
I better have a look around.

MUSIC: ORGAN GENTLY OUT WITH--

SOUND: CAR DOOR OPENS

OFFICER: (JUST AS HE THOUGHT) Uh huh. Uh huh! What's in this grip sack? 

DUTCHMAN: Oh, why, er, nothin', officer. As empty a grip sack as you'll ever 
run into. 

OFFICER: Yeah.

SOUND: OFFICER OPENS SACK BEHIND--

DUTCHMAN: No need to open it. It's empty. 

OFFICER: Well, you're right about that, mister. There's nothin' in there. 

DUTCHMAN: Yeah. (DOUBLE TAKE) Huh?

BLONDY: Easy, Dutchman.

DUTCHMAN: But-- You sure? It's empty?

OFFICER: Sure, I'm sure. Weren't you? 

DUTCHMAN: Oh, yeah. Sure, sure. I was sure, I just wanted you to be sure. 

OFFICER: Yeah. Carryin' nothin' but empties, huh? You guys empty this bottle 
all by yourselves? 

AL: This bottle is once full of medicine, officer. I myself have been wardin' 
off a touch of the grippe. I am now, uh, "in the pink," as the sayin' goes. 

OFFICER: (ANNOYED) Oh, wise guys, huh? Three wise guys. You know, if it 
weren't practically Christmas, I'd haul you in. Go on now, get out of our 
town. (AN AFTERTHOUGHT, DRY) Oh, yeah, and merry Christmas, three wise guys.

DUTCHMAN: Yeah, yeah, same to you. 

SOUND: POLICE AUTO ENGINE STARTS UP ... CAR IN GEAR AND DRIVES OFF

BLONDY: Uh, Dutchman, I-- 

DUTCHMAN: You know, Blondy, a while back you accused me of not tellin' you the 
whole story of that factory payroll job. Seems to me you forgot to tell me 
somethin' pretty important, too. What is it about that grip sack bein' empty 
of nearly fifty G's that I ought to know?

BLONDY: Well, I figured to fill you in, Dutchman. You see--

MUSIC: DURING ABOVE, SNEAK IN CHURCH CHOIR SINGING "O COME ALL YE FAITHFUL" 
FROM OFF ... CONTINUES IN BG

AL: Hey, look, Blondy, Dutchman. It's that same little church. 

BLONDY: Yeah.

DUTCHMAN: Yeah. 

MUSIC: CHOIR FILLS A PAUSE ... THEN IN BG

DUTCHMAN: Ya know somethin'? It's a miracle. I don't know yet what happened to 
that nearly fifty G's in the grip sack, but if that copper had caught us with 
that dough, we'd be on our way to the clink right now.

AL: An astute observation. 

BLONDY: Yeah. Well, you see, Dutchman, when I called on Doc Kelton tonight, I 
left all the dough with him. The whole fifty G's. Told him to give it back 
where it belongs. Told him enough more that the doc is sure he can spring 
Clarabelle's husband out of jail. So him and Clarabelle and the new kid can be 
together.

MUSIC: CHOIR GENTLY OUT

DUTCHMAN: Hey, this, er-- This Doc Kelton is a right guy? 

BLONDY: Oh, I'll say he is. Why, he even agreed to give us a head start for 
the Pennsylvania border before he notifies the law. 

AL: This is a right guy?

DUTCHMAN: Yeah. And we better oblige the doc -- and ourselves -- by makin' the 
border ahead of the cops.

SOUND: AUTO ENGINE STARTS UP ... CAR IN GEAR ... RUNNING AUTO INTERIOR 
BACKGROUND

DUTCHMAN: Hey, ya know, that copper was right. Three wise guys, he called us. 
If we wasn't pretty wise, we'd've had all that cash on us when he pulled us 
over to the curb. I think it's a good idea we stay right on bein' three wise 
guys. I'm through stretchin' my luck. From here on in, I'm gonna play it 
straight. And I'm still runnin' this show, so you two wise guys are goin' 
straight with me. Okay?

BLONDY: Okay. 

AL: Agreed. 

DUTCHMAN: (SATISFIED) Huh. (CHANGES SUBJECT) Wonder how far it is to the 
border. They got a lot of funny little burgs here in Pennsylvania. What was 
that one we just left, Blondy? 

BLONDY: Oh, I saw a signboard back there a ways. That burg is known as, uh, 
uh, Bethlehem. 

MUSIC: FOR PUNCTUATION ... CHIMES AND THEN ORCHESTRA ... "JOY TO THE WORLD" 
... THEN BEHIND WHISTLER--

WHISTLER: And so, on a night before Christmas in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, 
three wise guys were strangely touched by the spirit of the season -- a spirit 
born in another Bethlehem nearly two thousand years ago. And tonight, on the 
eve of another Christmas, may we hope that this same eternal spirit will 
someday bring to wise guys throughout the world the understanding that the 
future of the peoples of earth rests in good will toward all men.

MUSIC: UP, FOR CURTAIN ... THEN WHISTLER THEME ... THEN OUT BEHIND ANNOUNCER--

ANNOUNCER: Let that whistle be your signal for the Signal Oil program "The 
Whistler" each Sunday night at this same time. Signal Oil Company has asked me 
to remind you: This week it's especially important to drive at sensible 
speeds, be courteous, and obey traffic regulations, so some avoidable accident 
doesn't mar the holiday season for you. 

MUSIC: TAG ... THEN IN BG, UNTIL END

ANNOUNCER: Remember what I said at the beginning of the program, friends, that 
you'd find tonight's story unusual and heartwarming? Now, wasn't I right? I'm 
sure many of you recognized it as one of the late and great Damon Runyon's 
most famous tales. The radio adaptation was by Kathleen Hite. Featured in 
tonight's story were Bill Forman, John Brown, Marvin Miller, and Jack Moyles. 
"The Whistler" was transcribed and directed by George W. Allen, with music by 
Wilbur Hatch, and was transmitted to our troops overseas by the Armed Forces 
Radio Service. The Whistler is entirely fictional and all characters portrayed 
on "The Whistler" are also fictional. Any similarity of names or resemblance 
to persons living or dead is purely coincidental. Remember at this same time 
next Sunday another strange tale by the Whistler. Marvin Miller speaking for 
the Signal Oil Company.
