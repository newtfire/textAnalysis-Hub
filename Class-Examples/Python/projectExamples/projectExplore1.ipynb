      "Come on. We have worked to do.\n",
      "No, I'm just happy you were able to \n",

      "Not at all!\n",

      "Oh please! Really?\n",
      "Fry, that's offensive to our people. \n",
      "Isn't it?\n",
      "Oh no not at all. If anything, I'm more \n",
      "impressed.\n",
      "It's all so sad. What happened to our \n",
      "people?\n",
      "I heard you from my room. What's wrong?\n",
      "Please, is it bout the fate of our people? \n",

      "No.\n",

      "I know.\n",
      "Fry if it's obvious to you with your \n",
      "learning disability then of course it's \n",
      "obvious to me! He's crude and gross \n",
      "and he treats me like a slave.\n",
      "I can't. If I leave Alkazar then that's \n",
      "the end of the Cyclops race. And I won't \n",
      "let that happen. Even if that means \n",
      "a lifetime of unhappiness.\n",

      "Yeah!\n",
      "But why did you have all five weddings \n",
      "on the same day?\n",
      "Alright Alkazar, I just have one last \n",
      "question for you.\n",
      "If you can change form, why didn't you \n",
      "change it in the one place that counts?\n",
      "Thanks for saving me from that creep \n",

      "to the park. But oh, no, the park was \n",
      "too phoney. We had to see the real moon.\n",
      "Fry, face it. The moon is a dump. It's \n",
      "a boring dried up wasteland. And the \n",
      "only reason anybody ever comes here \n",

      "That's right, you shouldn't have. I \n",
      "still don't get what the big attraction \n",

      "Alright, but I wanna lick the beaters.\n",
      "Fry, what are you doing?\n",
      "Yeah, actually. You're doing OK. The \n",
      "core reactor temperature's nominal, \n",
      "the blinker's off.\n",
      "Is that what this is all about? Please, \n",
      "just cut it out now.\n",

      "there is absolutely, positively no way \n",
      "that you and I will ever, ever -\n",

      "I guess not.\n",
      "OK. Let me just take the ship out to \n",
