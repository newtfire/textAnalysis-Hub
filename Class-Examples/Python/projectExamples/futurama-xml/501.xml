Mice.</info>

<info>Planet Express: Balcony. Its a scorching hot day and the crew 
are standing on the balcony in swimsuits. Leela is standing by 
an empty kiddie pool.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Hurry up with the water, I'm steaming 
in my own shell I am, it's that hot 
it is!</speak>

<info>Leela rips open a packet of Instant Pool Water (Just Add Water 
- Dead Leaves Included.)</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Heyya!</speak>

<info>She empties the packet into the pool and squirts it with the 
hose. The pool fills with water with dead leaves floating on 
top. Enter Fry and Bender.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Man it's hot! <info>(different voice.)</info> How 
hot is it? <info>(normal voice.)</info> It's so hot 
I poured McDonalds Coffee in my lap 
to cool off.  Jonny Carson said it.</speak>

<info>Nibbler starts to drink the pool water.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
No! Nibbler, don't drink the pool water! 
It's full of chlorine!</speak>

<info>Nibbler finishes off the water and belches a green gas - chlorine! 
Everyone except Bender coughs and falls over unconcious. Bender 
laughs.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Lightweights! Oh wait - chlorine!</speak>

<info>He instantly rusts and falls over.</info>

<info>Planet Express: Meeting Room. The crew are slouched around the 
table sweating. Farnsworth is attaching an old filmstrip to Bender.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Perhaps this movie will help us take 
our minds off the heat.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER"><info>(JITTERY)</info>
Focuuus!</speak>

<info>The movie is projected onto a screen with the title "Global 
Warming Or: None Like It Hot."</info>

<info>In the movie a little girl called Suzie walks out of an ice 
cream shop with a cone. It melts before she can take a lick. 
She cries. A man laughs. The regular filmstrip narrator walks 
into the frame.</info>

<speak who="NARRATOR"><info>IN MOVIE</info>
You're probably wondering why your ice 
cream went away. Well Suzie, the culprit 
isn't foreigners, it's global warming!</speak>

<speak who="SUZIE"><info>IN MOVIE</info>
Gwobal wappa?</speak>

<speak who="MAN"><info>IN MOVIE.</info>
Uh, yeah! Meet Mr Sunbeam. He comes 
all the way from the sun to visit Earth.</speak>

<info>As he speaks there is a scene of a sunbeam in a hat with a briefcase. 
It walks from the sun to Earth and raises its hat.</info>

<info>He walks away from the Earth but is stopped by gas things.</info>

<speak who="GAS"><info>IN MOVIE</info>
Not so fast Sunbeam! We're Greenhouse 
Gases! You ain't going nowhere!</speak>

<info>More gases arrive and they beat up Mr Sunbeam.</info>

<speak who="MAN"><info>IN MOVIE</info>
Pretty soon Earth is chock full of sunbeams......their 
rotting corpses heating our atmosphere.</speak>

<info>The gases laugh and the scene changes to a classroom.</info>

<speak who="SUZIE"><info>IN MOVIE</info>
How do we get wid of the gweenhouse 
grasses?</speak>

<speak who="NARRATOR"><info>IN MOVIE</info>
Fortunately our handsomest politicians 
came up with a cheap, last minute way 
to combat global warming. Ever since 
2063 we drop a giant ice cube into the 
ocean every now and then.</speak>

<info>The movie cuts to a shot of a giant ice cube being dropped into 
the ocean.</info>

<speak who="SUZIE"><info>IN MOVIE</info>
Just like Daddy puts in his drink every 
morning! <info>(sadly)</info> And then he gets mad.</speak>

<speak who="NARRATOR"><info>IN MOVIE</info>
Of course, since the greenhouse gases 
are still building up, it takes more 
and more ice each time.  Thus solving 
the problem once and for all.</speak>

<speak who="SUZIE"><info>IN MOVIE</info>
But...</speak>

<info>The movie quickly ends with the caption "The End."</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Well, we just need one of those big 
ice cubes. Someone should call the losers 
who are supposed to deliver it.  Hello?</speak>

<info>Nixon's head appears on the screen.</info>

<speak who="NIXON"><info>ON SCREEN</info>
President Nixon here.  I'm hiring you 
losers to deliver the ice. And hurry 
up! I'm sweating like J. Edgar Hoover 
trying to squeeze into a new girdle!</speak>

<info>He cuts off.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
You heard the good news everyone! Save 
the Earth, et cetera et cetera!  Bye!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Wait! Where do we get the ice?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
The wha? Oh Halley's Comet of course. 
The only sufficient source of ice cubes 
that don't have bugs in them!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Wow! Mining a comet, that sounds fun!</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Yes there's no safer occupation than 
mining. Especially when you're on a 
snowball whipping through space at a 
million miles an hour!  Safe!</speak>

<info>Halley's Comet. The ship flies in for it's landing. It has a 
giant cup tied to it. It lands. The cargo lift comes down. Bender 
moves a piece of machinery off the ship and onto the comet.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Deploying ice drill.</speak>

<info>He presses a button. The machine sprouts legs and grows to the 
same height as the ship. A thing comes out of the top of it. 
It turns into and ice dispenser.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Wow! That ice dispenser's so big, the 
ice crushes you!  Yakov Smirnov said 
it!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
No he didn't.</speak>

<info>Bender pushes the giant cup onto the ice dispenser.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Activating ice drill.</speak>

<info>The drill drills through the surface. Only a bit of grit comes 
through the dispenser.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Oh my God! It's out of ice! Like some 
outer space Motel 6!</speak>

<info>Leela gasps.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Completely out of ice?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
This could mean the end of the bana 
daquiri as we know it...also life.</speak>

<info>Planet Express: Lounge. The crew are still sweltering. On the 
TV Morbo's head is inflating and deflating.</info>

<speak who="LINDA"><info>ON TV</info>
With Halley's Comet out of ice, Earth 
is experiencing the devastating effects 
of sudden intense global warming.</speak>

<speak who="MORBO"><info>ON TV</info>
Morbo is pleased but sticky. The scorching 
heat has melted the polar ice caps causing 
floods of biblical proportions.</speak>

<info>The shot changes to a swamped city with an ark floating through 
it.</info>

<speak who="GAY SAILOR"><info>ON TV</info>
They called me crazy for building this 
ark.</speak>

<speak who="MAN"><info>ON TV</info>
You are crazy, you built it with same 
sex animal couples!</speak>

<speak who="GAY SAILOR"><info>ON TV</info>
Hey! There are parts of the Bible I 
like and parts I don't like.</speak>

<info>The shot changes to a live windmill landscape.</info>

<speak who="MORBO"><info>ON TV</info>
Direct your attention now to the African 
turtles seen here migrating to cooler 
homes in Holland.</speak>

<info>A turtle rolls onto the back of its shell and can't get up.</info>

<speak who="BENDER"><info>(CRYING)</info>
That poor turtle!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Bender? Are you crying?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER"><info>(CRYING)</info>
Uh no! Never!</speak>

<info>He wipes his eyes with windscreen wipers.</info>

<speak who="MORBO"><info>ON TV</info>
Morbo wishes these storward nomads peace 
among the Dutch tulips!</speak>

<speak who="LINDA"><info>ON TV</info>
I'm sure those windmills will keep them 
cool.</speak>

<info>Outside Planet Express. The crew sit on some steps. The temperature 
reaches 120 Farenheit.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Well everybody, I just saved a turtle, 
what have you done with your lives?</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
You went all the way to Holland already?</speak>

<info>Bender points at his feet. He is wearing clogs. He dances.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Bender a turtle isn't yourself. Why 
do you care about it?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Because I also care deeply of things 
that remind me of myself. Like poor 
little Shelly here.</speak>

<info>He strokes the turtle.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
What could you possibly have in common 
with this walking soup mix?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
For one thing, we both have a tough 
outer shell.  But lead a rich, inner 
life. Also...well you know...</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
You're both alcoholic, whore-mongering, 
chain smoking gamblers?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
No! Its just...neither of us can get 
up when we get knocked on our back.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
What? I've seen you get up off your 
back tons of times.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Those times I was slightly on my side.</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
Interesting. Maybe we should test this 
erectile disfunction of yours Bender.</speak>

<info>Everyone gets up and moves towards Bender.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Uh, that's not necessary, really! I 
think I hear my factory recalling me.</speak>

<info>Amy crouches behind Bender and he trips over her and he and 
the turtle land on their backs.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Oh! That's what I get for sharing my 
vulnerability with you people.</speak>

<info>A Civil Defence van drives past.</info>

<speak who="VAN">
Calling all scientists, calling all 
scientists. Be advised there will be 
a worldwide conference on global warming 
in Kyoto, Japan.</speak>

<info>A man runs to the van.</info>

<speak who="MAN">
I've got a degree in homeopathic medicine!</speak>

<speak who="VAN">
You've got a degree in baloney!</speak>

<info>The van sprays the scientist with a water cannon.</info>

<speak who="AMY">
Professor Farnsworth, you're a scientist!</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Forget it, I'm not going! I have my 
reasons! Shut up all of you!</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
Strange. You haven't acted suspicious 
since I found those "ape bones" in the 
basement.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
My hip hurts! I'm in the middle of cooking 
a turkey! I have warranty cards to fill 
out! I'm not just making excuses! Alright 
I'll go!</speak>

<info>Outside Conference Centre. Scientists from all over the world 
arrive. Photographers take photos of them and fans in the crowd 
wave papers for them to sign. Joan Rivers' Head is commentating 
the star studded event.</info>

<speak who="CROWD">
Oh God I can't believe it! I love you!</speak>

<info>Farnsworth steps out of a limo.</info>

<speak who="RIVERS">
Oh oh! It's Hubert Farnsworth! He's 
looking fab in a standard white lab 
coat and dark slacks! His wristwatch 
is Casio.</speak>

<info>Cut to: Conference Centre. The scientists are gathered in a 
huge room. The Civil Defence van pulls up on the stage.</info>

<speak who="VAN">
Thank you all for coming! It is my pleasure 
to introduce the host of the Kyoto Global 
Warming Convention, the inventor of 
the environment and First Emperor of 
the Moon - Al Gore!</speak>

<info>Al Gore's Head in a jar rises up from the middle of the stage.</info>

<speak who="GORE">
I have ridden the mighty Moon Worm.</speak>

<info>The audience goes wild.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Good for him!</speak>

<speak who="GORE">
My fellow Earthicans, as I discuss in 
my book, Earth In The Balance and the 
much more popular Harry Potter And The 
Balance Of Earth we need to defend our 
planet against pollution. As well as 
dark wizards.</speak>

<info>The audience cheers and a dark wizard who looks like Tim The 
Enchanter from Monty Python And The Holy Grail sulks.</info>

<speak who="DARK WIZARD">
Sure! Blame the wizards!</speak>

<speak who="GORE">
That's why I'm offering a bag of Moon 
Saphires to the scientist who can solve 
this problem once and for all.  Lovely 
aren't they?</speak>

<speak who="DARK WIZARD">
Sapphires?  With those I could open 
the Gate Of Kerash!</speak>

<speak who="GORE">
First up is Professor Ogden Wernstrom.</speak>

<info>Wernstrom walks onto the stage.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Wernstrom!</speak>

<speak who="WERNSTROM">
Ahem. Ladies and Gentlemen. I have placed 
in orbit a giant mirror that will reflect 
40% of the sun's rays. Thus cooling 
Earth. Observe.</speak>

<info>He presses a button and the roof opens up. The audience is blinded 
by the sunlight. Fry starts to pant.</info>

<info>Cut to: Space Mirror. The mirror moves around and starts to 
reflect the rays.</info>

<info>Cut to: Conference Centre. The room falls into shadow and Wernstrom 
dusts off his hands.</info>

<speak who="WERNSTROM">
Problem solved.</speak>

<info>He laughs.</info>

<info>Cut to: Space Mirror. A piece of debris hits the mirror. It 
starts to spin and reflects more sunlight onto the Earth in a 
concentrated beam.</info>

<info>Cut to: City Street. A man shields his eyes.</info>

<speak who="MAN">
Ooo, that's a little bright.</speak>

<info>The sunlight scorches the street and blows the man up.</info>

<info>Cut to: Conference Centre. The sunbeam cuts its way through 
the building. The audience run around panicking. Gore continues 
talking.</info>

<speak who="GORE">
Alright, What else we got?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Professor, you're a Professor. You must 
have some ideas.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Absolutely not! I won't speak! I've 
got nothing to hide!</speak>

<speak who="GORE">
Our next speaker is -</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
I demand the floor!</speak>

<speak who="GORE">
Yes, it's your turn to speak.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Well nuts to me. I'm taking the stage! 
I know the source of the greenhouse 
gases. But in my shame I've kept it 
secret for 75 long years. Ohhh, it haunts 
my memory still.</speak>

<info>He holds a ray gun up to his head.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Professor no, don't do it!</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Don't do what? Don't use this memory 
ray so I can remember what happened 
back then?</speak>

<info>He shoots himself. A blue glow envelopes his head.</info>

<info>Flashback - 75 years ago.</info>

<info>Mom's Friendly Robot Company: Farnsworth's Lab.</info>

<info>A prototype C3PO-like robot wakes up on the table. It looks 
around and sees Farnsworth.</info>

<speak who="PROTOTYPE">
Oh dear. Might I favour master with 
a tender kiss on the forehead?</speak>

<info>It kisses Farnsworth.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Oh dear, I've failed again.</speak>

<info>He presses a button and the robot is crushed � la the Terminator 
in The Terminator.</info>

<speak who="PROTOTYPE">
Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear.</speak>

<info>Mom's Office. Mom is bashing Farnsworth's head on her desk.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Ooo, ouch, stop!</speak>

<info>Time Lapse. Farnsworth finishes making the first working robot.</info>

<info>The robot wakes up, drinks beer and belches fire.</info>

<speak who="MOM">
What was that?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
A flaming burp.</speak>

<speak who="MOM">
Does it always do that?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Its not always a burp. We still have 
one problem though. This robot will 
never meet emission standards.</speak>

<speak who="MOM">
Crap spackle!  We'll just call it a 
sport utility robot and classify it 
as a light truck!</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Well...I suppose the environment can 
take one more for the team.</speak>

<info>He starts to clean the robot.</info>

<info>Mom lies on a table.</info>

<speak who="MOM">
Take me now you stud!</speak>

<info>He climbs on and they both...um. The robot carries on drinking.</info>

<info>Flashback ends.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Oh this is all my fault!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
That's awful Professor. Especially the 
making out part.</speak>

<speak who="GORE">
Yeah, I didn't need to hear that.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
All modern robots descend from my original 
smog blasting designs. And that's the 
cause of global warming today.</speak>

<speak who="WERNSTROM">
Uh, so the robots are to blame. As I 
suspected.  We are left with only one 
possible course of action. Grim though 
it be.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
I got a good feeling about this!</speak>

<speak who="WERNSTROM">
We must immediately and permanently 
shut down, dismantle and destroy all 
robots!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
No!</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Wait, surely there's a better -</speak>

<info>The Civil Defence Van interrupts him.</info>

<speak who="VAN">
The conference is over.</speak>

<speak who="GORE">
I must go now, to help collect cans 
on Jupiter. Peace out ya'll!</speak>

<info>His jar sprouts rockets and he blasts off.</info>

<speak who="AUDIENCE"><info>(CHANTING)</info>
Destroy all robots! Destroy all robots!</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
Poor Bender.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Be brave my friend.</speak>

<info>The turtle goes into its shell. So does Bender.</info>

<info>Planet Express: Lounge. Bender is still in his body. The crew 
are trying to coax him out.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Come on. You've got to come out of your 
chest sometime.  Would you do it for 
a Bender snack?</speak>

<info>She opens it and tempts him with it. He reaches out to grab 
it but the crew all grab his arm.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Ah ha!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Gotcha!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER"><info>FROM INSIDE</info>
Let me go! I don't even want the stupid 
beer!  Yes! You tried to trick me into 
coming out of my chest. But who has 
the beer now?  I've got mail.</speak>

<info>He reaches into his chest cabinet and pulls out a card with 
the words "It's A Party" on it.</info>

<speak who="AMY">
Ooo, it's a party. Apparently.</speak>

<info>Nixon's head appears in the card.</info>

<speak who="NIXON"><info>IN CARD</info>
Do you like to party? To boogie down? 
Well I'm throwing an all night beach 
raver for my robot pals. It all goes 
down Saturday on the isolated Galapogas 
Islands where there will be no escape 
- from the fun! All robots must attend!</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Strange. Why would Nixon, an awkward, 
uncomfortabble man suddenly throw a 
party? One of the most social events 
imaginable. It's a trap is why! They're 
going to deactivate all the robots! 
I don't hear any gasping.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
We all figured that out.</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Ohh!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Well, I'm off.</speak>

<info>Fry blocks the door.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Wait. We could hide you! We'll pile 
fruit on you and claim you're a bowl.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
No. I'm going to the party.</speak>

<info>Fry puts a banana skin on Bender's head.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
I won't let you.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Fry, as you know, there are lots of 
things I'm willing to kill for. Jewels, 
vengence, Father O'Mally's weedwhacker. 
But at long last I've found something 
I'm willing to die for. This mindless 
turtle.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Bender, this world isn't good enough 
for you.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Not even close. Goodbye everybody. Don't 
touch my stuff after I'm dead!  <info>(shouting)</info> 
It's booby trapped.</speak>

<info>Robot Party. The robots party on a ship. Then they cross the 
desert on camels. Then they swing through a jungle. Then they 
go to a fair. Then they party on the Galapogas islands. Bender 
looks at his turtle.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Poor guy. Maybe you'd feel better if 
I had a drink.  Crummy kegg it's completely 
ta -  Oh you're a robot.</speak>

<speak who="KEGG">
Don't stop!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Ew!</speak>

<info>Nixon takes the stage.</info>

<speak who="NIXON">
Attention happenin' robots. Who's got 
what it takes to party with Nixon?  
You fellas enjoy yourselves for the 
next two hours. And be sure not to leave 
the island, uh for at least two hours! 
I'm going out to pick up some smokes. 
Uh really good smokes! Two hours.  OK 
headless body of Agnoo, lets blow this 
joint!</speak>

<info>The body growls and carries Nixon to a helicopter. Bender watches 
the helicopter fly away.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Nah, I'm not really in the -</speak>

<info>She shakes him around. Bender panics.</info>

<info>Nixon's Helicopter. It is now flying through space towards Wernstrom's 
mirror.</info>

<speak who="WERNSTROM">
Per your orders I have modified my mirror 
to fire a colossal electromagnetic pulse 
at the Galapogas. Every robot will be 
instantly and painfully terminated. 
Now for your part of the bargain.</speak>

<speak who="NIXON">
Oh, very well. Agnoo, you belong to 
Wernstrom now.</speak>

<info>Agnoo growls.</info>

<info>Galapogas Islands. Bender is talking to his turtle.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
I have to say goodbye now. There ain't 
not turtles where daddy's a-going. <info>(whispering)</info> 
Don't tell anybody but Nixon's about 
to shut all robots off and -</speak>

<info>A boom mic robot hangs over Bender.</info>

<speak who="MIC">
What??</speak>

<info>There is bedlam with the robots.</info>

<speak who="ROBOT #1"><info>(SHOUTING)</info>
We're gonna die!</speak>

<speak who="ROBOT #2"><info>(SHOUTING)</info>
Nixon's not bringing the smokes!</speak>

<info>Bender takes control.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Shut up and pay attention to me! Bender. 
Look, I love life and its pleasures 
as much as anyone here, except perhaps 
you Hedonismbot.  But we need to be 
shut off! Especially you Hendonismbot!</speak>

<speak who="HEDONISMBOT">
I apologise for nothing!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
We pollute too much. We're destroying 
the world and killing the turtles.</speak>

<speak who="PREACHERBOT">
To hell with the turtles!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
No one insults the turtles!</speak>

<info>He punches Preacherbot.</info>

<speak who="PREACHERBOT">
Oh mercy.</speak>

<info>He pulls out a knife and he and Bender fight.</info>

<speak who="HEDONISMBOT">
Let the games begin!</speak>

<info>It chuckles. The Planet Express ship flies in and lands. Fry 
and Leela carry the Professor out and stand him in front of the 
microphone on the stage.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Everyone listen!</speak>

<info>The robots stop fighting. Bender punches Preacherbot again. 
He falls over.</info>

<speak who="PREACHERBOT">
Aw damn!</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
I've devised a way to save you and to 
stop global warming at the same time! 
Granted you're all blasting out greenhouse 
gases.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
You're one to talk!</speak>

<info>Preacherbot hits him with a chair. He falls over onto his back. 
He tries to get up but can't.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
But we can use those very gases to save 
the planet. If you all vent your exhaust 
directly upward in one burst it should 
thrust the Earth further from the sun, 
thus cooling it.  By my calculations 
we'll need the full force of every last 
robot. So quickly, everyone point your 
exhaust vents straight upwards.  Now 
vent! Vent like the wind!  Harder! Harder!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Why isn't this working?!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Some lazy or polite robot is holding 
it in.</speak>

<info>Bender is still on his back, unable to vent.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Help! Help!!</speak>

<info>Cut to: Nixon's Helicopter. Wernstrom is turning the mirror 
towards the robots.</info>

<info>Cut to: Galapogas Islands. The robots continue to vent but to 
no avail.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
A billion robot lives are about to be 
extinguished! Oh the Jedi's are going 
to feel this one!</speak>

<info>Bender and the turtle are still on their backs.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
I'm sorry buddy. At least we'll die 
on our backs, helpless.  Huh? What the 
hell are you doing?  Hey are you trying 
to make me look bad?  Ah ha! I'm even 
greater than I thought I was! And now 
to fullfill my destiny.</speak>

<info>He stands on his hands and vents. The flame grows bigger and 
the Earth moves.</info>

<info>Nixon's Helicopter.</info>

<speak who="NIXON">
Fire!!  What the??</speak>

<speak who="WERNSTROM">
We missed.</speak>

<info>Agnoo growls.</info>

<info>Galapogas Islands. The skies have cleared and the crew are standing 
on the stage. Nixon is with them.</info>

<speak who="NIXON">
Professor, for saving the Earth and 
foiling me, I proudly, yet angrily, 
present you with Earth's new highest 
honour: The Polluting Medal Of Pollution.</speak>

<info>He hangs the medal around Farnsworth. The industrial chimneys 
on the medal blow smoke in Farnsworth's face making him cough.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Thank you. I deserve this!</speak>

<info>The robots cheer.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Hey Professor! Now that the Earth's 
orbit is further from the sun won't 
that make the year longer?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Why yes! One week longer to be exact.</speak>

<speak who="NIXON">
In that case I hereby declare it Robot 
Party Week!</speak>

<info>The robots cheer and dance to Buster Poindexter and his Banshees 
Of Blue's Hot Hot Hot. Then they vent.</info>

<info>THE END</info></xml>
