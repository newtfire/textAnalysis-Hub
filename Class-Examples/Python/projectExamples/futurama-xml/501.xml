                         Perhaps this movie will help us take

                         You're probably wondering why your ice

               <note>As he speaks there is a scene of a sunbeam in a hat with a briefcase.

                         Fortunately our handsomest politicians 
                         came up with a cheap, last minute way 
                         to combat global warming. Ever since 
                         2063 we drop a giant ice cube into the 
                         ocean every now and then.
 
               
               <note>The movie cuts to a shot of a giant ice cube being dropped into 
               the ocean.</note>
 
               
                                     SUZIE <note>IN MOVIE</note>
                         Just like Daddy puts in his drink every 
                         morning! (sadly) And then he gets mad.
 
                         
               
                                     NARRATOR <note>IN MOVIE</note>
                         Of course, since the greenhouse gases 
                         are still building up, it takes more 
                         and more ice each time.  Thus solving 
                         the problem once and for all.

               <note>The movie quickly ends with the caption "The End."</note>

                          I know the source of the greenhouse

                         secret for 75 long years. Ohhh, it haunts 
                         my memory still.

                         But we can use those very gases to save 
                         the planet. If you all vent your exhaust 
                         directly upward in one burst it should 
                         thrust the Earth further from the sun, 
                         thus cooling it.  By my calculations 
                         we'll need the full force of every last 
                         robot. So quickly, everyone point your 
                         exhaust vents straight upwards.  Now 
                         vent! Vent like the wind!  Harder! Harder!
