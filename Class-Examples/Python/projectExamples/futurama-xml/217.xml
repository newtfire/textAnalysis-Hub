               <note>Outside Mmm TV Studio. There is a large sign on the door with 
               a picture of Neptunian chef Elzar and "Elzar Live! Now Taping." 
               Smartly dressed people walk through the VIP Entrance and Fry, 
               Bender and Leela walk through the P Entrance, which is just a 
               normal door right next to the VIP Entrance.</note>
 
               
               <note>Cut to: Mmm TV Studio. At the back of the room people sit in 
               bleachers. Fry, Bender and Leela take a seat at a table near 
               the front.</note>

                         Wow! I'm finally gonna see my favourite 
                         chef, TV's Elzar. Oh this is the greatest 
                         nanosecond of my life. No, this one 
                         is - no, this one. Wait...that one was 
                         slightly worse. Ah, so far so good on 
                         this one.

                         some reason.

                         Leela, a little help is nothing to be 
                         embarrassed about. Like, maybe I could
