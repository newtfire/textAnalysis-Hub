               <note>Planet Express: Lounge. Fry and Bender sit on the couch while 
               Leela perches on the end of it. Fry tears open a pack of Styro-Pak 
               Cookies.</note>

                         Fry, I know those cookies are fresh-a-licious 
                         but they produce an awful lot of trash.

               out and puts it in a weird looking machine. He throws the packet 
               on a pile of other packets. He rips open a pack marked "Bottom" 
               and puts it in the other side of the machine. He rips open a 
               pack marked "Middle," puts it in the middle of the machine and 
               pulls a lever on the machine. The machine compresses the cookie 
               sections and makes a cream filled cookie. He pulls it apart a 
               licks out the cream from the middle. Bender sprays his antenna 
               with something and slicks it back.</note>

                         For this highly controversial mission, 
                         you'll be towing the Juan Valdez, an 
                         orbitting supertanker full of rich Columbian 
                         dark matter.

                         Dark matter oil? What if we hit something? 
                         The tanker could leak!

                         Impossible!  The tanker has 6000 hulls. 
                         So, unlike me, it's entirely leak-proof! 
                          Now, once you've hauled the tanker 
                         past the protestors -

                         That's right. Being a captain is about 
                         intuition and heart. A good captain 
                         can't have either one. That's why cold, 
                         logical Bender is perfect for the job.

               <note>Montage The penguins fish for fish. They slide down an ice bank 
               and dive into the water. Bender slides down halfway but his antenna 
               gets stuck in the ice and he stops, causing a pile-up of penguins 
               behind him. Next he prepares to sit on some eggs to keep them 
               warm but accidentally squashes them instead. He looks embarrassed 
               and covers the yolk stain on him with his tux tails. In the water 
               penguins catch one or two fish in their beaks and Bender uses 
               his antenna to harpoon three at once. Back on land Bender stands 
               up. There are two baby penguins underneath him. He sees another 
               penguin regurgitate food for the little ones. He picks up a fish 
               and throws it into his mouth which acts as a blender. At the 
               end of the day Bender sits with the group of penguins and chatters.</note>

                         Folks it's worse than we thought. Seems 
                         dark matter is nature's sex drug. It's 
                         like a perverted trail mix of penguin 
                         estrogen, penguin Viagra and Spanish 
                         penguin fly. Why, it's making them ultra-fertile.

                         Well your garden variety penguin lays 
                         one egg a year. Since the spill our 
                         penguins have been laying six eggs every 
                         15 minutes.  Also the eggs hatch in 
                         only 12 hours.  Also the males are laying 
                         eggs.

                         If the birds keep multiplying soon there'll 
                         be too many to count.  Before long they'll

                         (in penguin) We will fight them on the 
                         beaches! We will fight them on the glaciers!

                         They used to be such peaceful birds. 
                         I suppose this was your doing.

                         Yep. It's like I taught 'em. If it ain't

                         Well, at least it'll help reduce their

                         Granted. We can't take off without our

                         So Leela, were you able to help the

                         Well sure. I mean...not really...I mean...nature 
                         will work itself out. It can't screw 
                         things up any worse than we did trying 
                         to fix things right?

                         Ah, quit your worrying. Thanks to my

                         do just fine.
