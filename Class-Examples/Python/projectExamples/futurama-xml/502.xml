                         Ahem! For my next trick, notice I have 
                         nothing up my sleeves......and nothing 
                         in my head.  So if my lovely assistant 
                         will kindly supply me with an ordinary, 
                         non-fake pitcher of milk......behold 
                         the milk has vanished! Exiled, perhaps, 
                         to another dimension!

                         it was used to gently discipline the

                         it was also used to move pizzas and

                         His name was Seymour. He was once intimate 
                         with the leg of a wandering saxaphonist. 
                         He had wet dog smell, even when dry. 
                         And he was not above chasing the number

                         were my friend. But if you love your

                         play fetch!

                         Indeed. You see, that fossil was made 
                         of dolomite. The tough black mineral 
                         that won't cop out when there's heat 
                         all about. By contrast, observe the 
                         lava's affect on this ice swan.  Of 
                         course, that would have melted even 
                         at room temperature. I just wanted to 
                         get rid of it. But had it been made 
                         of that righteous mineral dolomite, 
                         there's a slim chance it might have 
                         survived.

                         Fry, what's wrong?

                         Think about it. Seymour lived a full 
                         life after I was gone. He probably added 
                         new songs to his repertoire.

                         But that's a good thing. Walking On 
                         Sunshine sucks noodles!

                         I had Seymour 'til he was three. That's 
                         when I knew him and that's when I loved 
                         him.  I'll never forget him. But he 
                         forgot me a long long time ago.

               <note>Flashback - January 2nd 2000. The song I Will Wait For You from 
               the film Les Parapluies de Cherbourg plays. Seymour sits outside 
               Panucci's Pizza waiting for Fry to come back. It changes to summer, 
               then autumn, a snowy and rainy winter and back to spring. Panucci 
               gives Seymour a slice of pizza. It goes through autumn and winter 
               again. Seymour starts to age a little. The "U" from the "Panucci's 
               Pizza" sign falls on a man. An aged Panucci pats Seymour on the 
               head. Seymour continues waiting for Fry to return, and closes 
               his eyes...</note>
