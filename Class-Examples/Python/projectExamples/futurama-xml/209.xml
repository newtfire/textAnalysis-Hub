                         You mean you have to choose between 
                         a life without sex and a gruesome death?

                         Well it was nice of you to let me reattach 
                         your arm, Fry. Especially after I made 
                         a complete eel out of myself.

                         Yes biggie. I learned to feel things 
                         I'd never felt before: Love, jealousy, 
                         passion for disembowling. I owe it all 
                         to you.  There! I pronounce the operation 
                         a success.

                         I may not know from emotions but when 
                         it comes to medicine, forget about it.

                         I don't mean to nitpick, super-doc, 
                         but do you think maybe you could take 
                         one more whack at this?
