"The Simpsons".</info>

<info>Planet Express: Lounge. An advertisement plays on TV. A plumberbot 
reaches down a toilet with his arm and a jingle plays.</info>

<speak who="SINGERS">
Call Robo-Rooter when you flush your 
towel ...</speak>

<speak who="PLUMBERBOT">
... And we can also help with an impacted 
bowel.</speak>

<info>He whirls his hand around.</info>

<speak who="SINGERS">
Robo-Rooter!</speak>

<info>Fry and Bender sit on the couch. Bender drinks back beer while 
Fry eats something.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Mmm. Mmm! Now this is what I call a 
thousand years of progress: A Bavarian 
creamdog that's also self-microwaving!</speak>

<info>He presses a button on the side of the creamdog and it microwaves 
itself, as well as Fry's face, which is left with black scorch 
marks. He takes another bite. Bender tip his empty bottle upside-down.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Aw, jeez. Let's just pray I have the 
energy to get myself another beer.  
Oh, what is this? The Middle Ages?</speak>

<info>He just about manages to move under the stream of beer. Enter 
Amy and Leela in gym gear.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Look at you guys. No offence, Fry, but 
you've become a fat sack of crap.</speak>

<info>Fry licks some cream off his finger.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Sack?</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
And, Bender, your beer belly's so big 
your door won't even close. And that 
doesn't even make sense.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Come on. We're taking you pigs to the 
gym.</speak>

<info>Enter Zoidberg wearing a vest and sweatbands around his head 
an wrists.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
The gymnasium? Excellent, excellent. 
For some reason I'm frisky as a squid 
on Tuesday.</speak>

<info>He clacks his claws.</info>

<info>Outside NNY Dumbell Club. Fry, Leela, Bender, Amy and Zoidberg 
walk into the gym. A sign in a gym window advertises "New - Windowless 
Rooms For Ugly Exercisers".</info>

<info>Cut to: NNY Dumbell Club. They pass some gym patrons, including 
a six-legged alien on a running machine, a woman using a Kegelcizer 
and a punch bag with arms and gloves repeatedly punching Larry 
in the stomach.</info>

<speak who="AMY">
Hey, who's up for a nice hot steam?</speak>

<info>Zoidberg shakes his head.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
We crustaceans don't like steam. I'm 
going to go work out with the Nautilus!</speak>

<info>A nautilus appears behind him with a basketball.</info>

<speak who="NAUTILUS">
What up, Dr. Z?</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Yo, yo, yo! Whassup whassup! Give up 
the rock!</speak>

<info>The Nautilus passes him the ball and Zoidberg runs off chuckling.</info>

<info>NNY Dumbell Club Steam Room. Leela, Amy and Fry relax in the 
steam.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Co-ed steam rooms! I love the future!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Uh, Fry, you're in the womens' steam 
room.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Ah, futuristic!</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
Psst, look what life was like before 
genetic engineering.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Those poor 20th century women.</speak>

<info>Fry crosses his legs, embarrassed.</info>

<info>Outside Steam Room. Amy walks out of the steam room with a towel 
wrapped around her and sees a man in a steam machine.</info>

<speak who="AMY">
<info>(sexfully)</info> Hey, handsome. Is there room 
in there for two?</speak>

<info>The man snorts.</info>

<speak who="MAN">
You wish!</speak>

<info>The machine opens and there really is no room for Amy. The man 
has a huge blubbery gut that has been forced into the shape of 
the machine. He gets out of the machine and his gut falls back 
into its natural shape. Amy shudders.</info>

<info>NNY Dumbell Club Weight Room. Fry lifts some weights. Enter 
Leela.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Hey, Leela, look who's the super-stud!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Hmm, somebody must have turned down 
the gravity. I'll fix it for you.</speak>

<info>She turns the Gravistat from "Lo" to "Norm". Fry drops the weights 
on his neck and starts to choke. Enter Zoidberg.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Give me that.  More weight!</speak>

<info>Leela and Bender put some more weights on the end. A big fin 
comes out of the top of Zoidberg's head like The Creature From 
The Black Lagoon.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Hey, Dr. Zoidberg, what's that jazz 
on your head?</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Enough with the questions. More weight! 
More!  More!</speak>

<info>He growls and his pupils go crazy.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Maybe you could do more rips with less 
weight.</speak>

<info>Zoidberg growls and cuts the dumbell. Amy and Fry scream and 
fall to the ground.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Hey, looks like Zoidberg's finally coming 
out of his shell.  Get it?  He's coming 
out--</speak>

<info>Zoidberg gets up and knocks Bender over then runs rampage around 
the room, knocking over equipment and people.</info>

<info>Cut to: NNY Dumbell Club Bike Room. People calmly pedal on the 
exercise bikes. Enter a growling Zoidberg, making them peddle 
faster, not really going anywhere.</info>

<info>Cut to: NNY Dumbell Club Pregnercise Pool. Randy leads a session 
in the pool full of pregnant women.</info>

<speak who="RANDY">
Nice and gentle, we don't want any unnecessary 
stress.  Is there a doctor in the gym?</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
I'm a doctor!</speak>

<info>Randy trembles and four more women give birth.</info>

<info>Planet Express: Farnsworth's Lab. Zoidberg sits on the lab table 
with his claws bound. The rest of the staff stand around him.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
I wonder why Dr. Zoidberg is acting 
this way. Out of all of us he always 
seemed the most normal.</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
I am normal. <info>(sexfully)</info> Amy, take of 
these rubber bands and I'll show you 
how normal I am!</speak>

<info>Amy's clothes have been ripped to shreds and her hair is a mess.</info>

<speak who="AMY">
Fool me seven times, shame on you. Fool 
me eight or more times, shame on me.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Maybe he has a parasite.</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
Maybe he is a parasite!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
It's always so sad when a friend goes 
crazy and you have to have a big clam-bake 
and cook him! Yee-haw!</speak>

<info>He puts his chef hat on. Farnsworth walks past with a syringe.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Now, now, this won't do. Let me just 
give old Zoidy a sedative.</speak>

<info>He tries to poke the syringe needle into Zoidberg but it just 
breaks on his shell.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Ah, much better. You can take off these 
rubber bands now.</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
I'll do it.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
<info>(simultaneously)</info> Stop!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
<info>(simultaneously)</info> No, Amy!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Moron!</speak>

<info>Farnsworth puts a stethoscope on Zoidberg's head.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Mm-hm...  Oh-ho!  Aha! There's the problem.</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Give it to me straight, Professor. Is 
it fin rot? It's fin rot, isn't it? 
Tell me it's not fin rot!</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Relax, my chiton-y chum. There's no 
problem. You're just heavy with male 
jelly.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Bleck!</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
It must be mating season for Zoidberg's 
people. A chaotic time when his behaviour 
is dictated by the tiny brain in his 
rump.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Eck!</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
There's only one thing we can do...</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
I'll get the water boiling!</speak>

<info>He starts to leave, now wearing an apron with a lobster on it 
as well as his hat.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
...We, by which I mean you, will have 
to rush him to his ancient homeworld 
which will shortly erupt in an orgy 
of invertebrate sex.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Oh, baby, I'm there!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Fry, do you even understand the word 
"invertebrate"?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Nope, but that's not the word I'm interested 
in. <info>(shouting)</info> Uh, no need to pack pants, 
people. Let's roll!</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
Dr. Zoidberg said I should hold these 
while he's gone.</speak>

<info>She holds up the rubber bands. The staff stare at her, gobsmacked. 
Bender slaps his head in disbelief.</info>

<info>Cut to: Outside Planet Express. Zoidberg growls and the others 
scream.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
<info>(from inside)</info> Moron!</speak>

<info>The ship flies down to the sandy world of Decapod 10. Most of 
the planets surface is water, with a few sandy island dotted 
here and there. The buildings are made of sand.</info>

<info>Cut to: Decapod 10 Planetary Spaceport. The ships landing gear 
extends and it skids along the sandy runway until it comes to 
a stop in a parking space. The Fry, Leela, Bender and Zoidberg 
walk out and are greeted by a Decapod man standing underneath 
a banner that says "Welcome Maters!" The man puts a garland over 
Zoidberg, whose fin has disappeared.</info>

<speak who="DECAPOD MANM #1">
Welcome home, old friend. Just 19 hours 
until the mating frenzy!</speak>

<info>He points to a giant water clock that is slowly filling with 
water.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Excellent, excellent!</speak>

<speak who="DECAPOD MAN #1">
See you there Doctor--</speak>

<info>He says something in the Decapodian language.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Is that how you say "Zoidberg"?</speak>

<info>The man runs off crying.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
You didn't have to call attention to 
his speech impediment.</speak>

<info>Zoidberg's Car. Fry and Zoidberg sit in the front and Bender 
and Leela in the back.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
You're looking less nuts, crabby.</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
I'm feeling less nuts, thank you, because 
tomorrow I will be depositing my jelly 
in the cloacal vents of a female. <info>(sexfully)</info> 
If you catch my drift.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Who's the lucky lobsterina?</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
I don't know yet. But I shall attract 
one this afternoon with an erotic display.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
It's amazing that your people can fall 
in love so fast.</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Love? That word is unknown here. I'm 
simply looking for a female swollen 
with eggs to accept my genetic material.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
You and me both, brother!</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Ah, my old scuttling grounds! Let's 
pull over.</speak>

<info>He pulls over. Rather than a normal hover car, he is driving 
a car with 10 legs along the sides.</info>

<info>Decapod 10 Surface. They look into a rock pool.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
I used to hang out here as a larva. 
It looked so much bigger back then. 
Who's the tough guy now, Vinnie?</speak>

<info>He eats it.</info>

<info>Claw-Plach Arena. Zoidberg, Fry, Bender and Leela look into 
an arena where spectators watch two Decapodians fighting.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Look! Outdoor theatre! Let's get tickets. 
Oh, let's do!</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
No, it's the ceremony of Claw-Plach, 
where my species fight to the death 
over matters of honour. Also whether 
abbreviations count in Scrabble. <info>(angry)</info> 
They don't!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
I didn't come here to see any activity 
involving two guys. Where do you people 
do your erotic display?</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Same place as your species: The beach.</speak>

<info>Decapod 10 Beach. Fry, Leela and Bender lie on sunbeds. Zoidberg 
comes out of a male changing room wearing a grass skirt and a 
shell necklace.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
How do I look?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Like whale barf.</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Then the illusion is complete.</speak>

<info>He walks off, clacking his claws.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Hey, I wonder if these guys are here 
to watch the erotic display too.</speak>

<info>He points at a group of Decapods with cameras and binoculars.</info>

<speak who="DECAPOD MAN #2">
Aw, yeah! Aw, wow!</speak>

<info>Zoidberg puts a shell on a mound of sand.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Perfect! This oughta make me stand out. 
Craw!</speak>

<info>Other men "craw" on the beach and women take interest. Fry chuckles.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Look how ridiculous they look.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Please, he's no different from the rest 
of you organisms; Shooting DNA at each 
other make babies. I find it offensive.</speak>

<info>Another woman walks past Zoidberg.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Craw!</speak>

<speak who="DECAPOD WOMAN #1">
Keep your jelly away from my eggs!</speak>

<info>She walks off and another woman who sounds like Amy replaces 
her.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Craw?!</speak>

<speak who="DECAPOD WOMAN #2">
So not interested.</speak>

<info>She walks off and a third woman approaches Zoidberg.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Craw!</speak>

<speak who="DECAPOD WOMAN #3">
Hmph. I've heard that line before!</speak>

<info>Zoidberg sighs.</info>

<info>Time Lapse. The sun is setting and the other Decapod men hold 
their mates in their arms along the beach. Zoidberg doesn't.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Cra-- Oh, what's the point?</speak>

<info>His fin goes back into his head and he sits down on the mound. 
Fry, Leela and Bender watch.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Why is Zoidberg the only one still alone?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
'Cause he's a loser, that's why. He's 
the lobster equivalent of Fry.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Hey! I can get any girl I want anytime 
I want. I'm just too busy.</speak>

<info>He starts playing with a yo-yo and the string gets tangled. 
He snarls and starts to untie it. Zoidberg sees another woman 
and his fin goes up again.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Edna?! Edna, it's me, Zoidberg. Remember? 
From high school?  You used to laugh 
at me because my face was covered with 
barnacles!</speak>

<info>Edna gasps.</info>

<speak who="EDNA">
Zoidberg? Well I didn't know you were 
back in town. I heard you went off and 
became a rich doctor.</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
I've performed a few mercy killings. 
So, as long as I'm in town I was wondering 
if maybe ... craw?</speak>

<speak who="EDNA">
Oh, gee, yeah, I'm just going through 
a lot of things right now and-- Look, 
Zoidberg, I carry more eggs than any 
other female and I owe it to our race 
to pick a mate who's stuffed with male 
jelly. Maybe a rock star.</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Or maybe a doctor?</speak>

<speak who="EDNA">
I'm sorry, Zoidberg. You're just an 
inferior male specimen. Nice seeing 
you again.</speak>

<info>She leaves. Zoidberg's fin goes down and he sits and starts 
to cry.</info>

<info>Ships Mess. Later that night, Zoidberg sits at the table and 
the others stand around.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
<info>(crying)</info> No one will ever want to mate 
with me, not with a puny claw like this. 
Did you see those other guys? They looked 
like giant claws with bodies attached.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
At least you didn't smell as bad as 
them.</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
<info>(crying)</info> You're right, my stink gland 
is weak. Smell!</speak>

<info>He forces her face into his armpit and she struggles and gags.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Listen, Doc, if you wanna score you 
gotta fake like you're in love.  Just 
look her in the eye, start crying and 
say <info>(fake crying)</info> "I've never been so 
happy".</speak>

<info>Leela takes her hand away and scoffs.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
If a guy ever did that to me I'd know 
it. Wait a second. They've all been 
doing that to me. Even Sean!</speak>

<info>She bursts into tears and runs out of the room.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Hmm, this "love" intrigues me. Teach 
me to fake it.</speak>

<info>Ships Rec Room. Fry has set up the room to look like a classroom. 
On a board at the front he has written "First Date: Champagne, 
Flowers, Lame Conversation". Zoidberg sits at a desk ready to 
learn.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
OK, you're on a date. What's the first 
thing you do?</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Ask her to mate with me.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
No. Tell her she's special.</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
But she's not. She's merely the female 
with the largest clutch of eggs.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Well, tell her that. And then?</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Then mating.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
No. Make up some feelings and tell her 
you have them.  Yes?</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Is desire to mate a feeling?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
You're not even trying!</speak>

<info>Zoidberg buries his head in his claws and groans.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
It's all so complicated with the flowers 
and the romance and the lies upon lies.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
OK, OK, don't worry. The love meister 
will take you under his wing.</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
What? Now there's a bird involved?</speak>

<info>Outside Edna's Apartment Building. Zoidberg stands outside the 
sand building and Fry hides under a giant shell with his back 
to the building.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
OK, go ahead.</speak>

<info>Zoidberg throws an octopus at Edna's French window. She opens 
it and walks out onto the balcony.</info>

<speak who="EDNA">
What the--? Dr. Zoidberg, your mating 
display failed. Why are you trying to 
talk to me?</speak>

<info>Zoidberg shrugs.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
<info>(shouting)</info> I have no idea.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
<info>(whispering)</info> You just wanna talk, it 
has nothing to do with mating.</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
<info>(shouting)</info> I just wanna talk, it has 
nothing to do with mating. <info>(whispering)</info> 
Fry, that doesn't make sense.</speak>

<speak who="EDNA">
Dr. Zoidberg, that doesn't make sense. 
But OK.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
<info>(whispering)</info> Start with a compliment: 
Tell her she looks thin.</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
<info>(shouting)</info> You seem malnourished. Are 
you suffering from internal parasites?</speak>

<speak who="EDNA">
Why, yes. Thanks for noticing.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
<info>(whispering)</info> Now ask her how her day 
was.</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Why would I wanna know?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
<info>(whispering)</info> You wouldn't. Ask anyway.</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
<info>(shouting)</info> How was your day?</speak>

<speak who="EDNA">
Well first I got up and had a piece 
of toast. Then I brushed my teeth. Then 
I went to the store to buy some fish. 
Then...</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Fry, look what you did, she won't shut 
up.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
<info>(whispering)</info> That's normal. Just nod 
your head and say "Uh-huh"</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Uh-huh, uh-huh.</speak>

<speak who="EDNA">
...And then you threw an octopus at 
my window. You know, Zoidberg, it's 
crazy but when you talk this way your 
obvious deficiencies as a male seem 
... less obvious. Your genes seem less 
detrimental.  You even stink more.</speak>

<info>Zoidberg looks at Fry.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Do I ask her to mate now?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
<info>(whispering)</info> Third date!</speak>

<info>Red Primate. At the restaurant that is "For The Land Food Lover 
In You", Zoidberg and Edna are on a date, joined by Fry, Leela 
and Bender. They sit around a table. Other Decapodians are eating 
at other tables. Bender finishes telling a story.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
So I returned his artificial heart and 
ever since then I've been known by the 
name of Honest Bender.</speak>

<info>Everyone laughs and Fry slips Zoidberg a piece of paper.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
<info>(reading)</info> I'd like to propose a toast 
to ... coat check number 84.</speak>

<info>He raises his glass.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
<info>(whispering)</info> Turn it over.</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Oh, Edna! <info>(reading)</info> Of all the slimy, 
gross crab monsters on this planet, 
you are apparently the hottest.</speak>

<info>He raises his glass again. Edna, Leela and Bender glare at him.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Oy.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
That's the most beautiful thing I've 
ever heard.</speak>

<speak who="EDNA">
Yes, well ... excuse me, I've got to 
powder my mouth flaps.</speak>

<info>She gets up and leaves. Zoidberg sighs.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Uh, me too.</speak>

<info>She runs after Edna.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
I'm confused, Fry. I'm feeling a strange 
new emotion. Is it love when you care 
about a female for reasons beyond mating?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Nope. Must be some weird alien emotion.</speak>

<info>Red Primate Women's Room. Edna powders her mouth flaps.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Zoidberg said some dumb stuff but he's 
a nice guy, really. It's just that Fry's 
been telling him what to say and Fry's 
a ... do you have idiots on your planet?</speak>

<speak who="EDNA">
Fry? You mean words of such beauty came 
from the blowhole of that hideous alien?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Yeah ... What? Look, never mind the 
words. Zoidberg's a doctor. A doctor 
honey.</speak>

<speak who="EDNA">
Hmm.</speak>

<info>Edna's Apartment Building Corridor. Fry stands outside her door 
and reads a message on a fish. "Fry - Let's discuss Zoidberg 
- Edna." He drops the fish and it wriggles back into the water. 
Fry rings the doorbell which sounds like a sonar beep.</info>

<speak who="EDNA">
<info>(from inside)</info> Come in.</speak>

<info>She growls sexfully.</info>

<info>Cut to: Edna's Apartment. Fry walks in and looks around. The 
room is decorated like a fish tank. Edna pulls open some curtains 
and walks towards Fry. She is dressed in a dark blue teddy and 
fishnet tights.</info>

<speak who="EDNA">
<info>(sexfully)</info> Hello, Fry. Can I interest 
you in some surf and turf?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
No thanks. I just came to tell you that 
Zoidberg's really great. He's got male 
jelly coming out the wazoo.</speak>

<speak who="EDNA">
Well that is where it comes out but 
jelly isn't everything.  I know Zoidberg's 
magical words were really yours. Teach 
me to love you, squishy poet from beyond 
the stars!</speak>

<info>She runs towards him and he ducks behind the chair. She starts 
edging towards him and he moves around the chair.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Uh, I'm flattered, really. If I was 
gonna do it with a big, freaky mud bug 
you'd be way up the list!</speak>

<speak who="EDNA">
Hush, you romantic fool! Engage your 
mandibles and kiss me!</speak>

<info>She dives on him and they land on a couch. Her mouth flaps snake 
around Fry's head and she kisses him. Fry struggles to get away. 
Enter a smartly-dressed Zoidberg carrying flowers and champagne.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Edna, I couldn't stand it any longer. 
I--  <info>(angry)</info> Fry!</speak>

<info>He gets so tense his claws clip the bottle neck and it falls 
to the floor and breaks.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Dr. Zoidberg, it's not how it looks.</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
<info>(angry)</info> Her caviar is on your neck!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
But--</speak>

<speak who="EDNA">
Oh, it's true, Zoidberg. We can't hide 
it any longer. Fry and I have fallen 
in love and we're going to mate tomorrow.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
What?!</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
<info>(angry)</info> Fry!  I challenge you to Claw-Plach!</speak>

<info>He clacks his claws.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
English please?</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
A fight to the death.</speak>

<info>He clacks his claws again.</info>

<speak who="EDNA">
And if you survive, we'll make sweet 
love!</speak>

<info>She clacks her claws. Fry pulls on his hair and screams.</info>

<info>Decapod 10 Surface. Decapod guards hold Fry in chains and march 
Fry to the Decapod Emperor's throne. Bender and Leela watch.</info>

The law is clear. Fry and Zoidberg shall 
fight to the death for the claw of the 
beautiful Edna.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
But I don't want her!</speak>

<speak who="DECAPOD EMPEROR">
Once invoked, the sacred tradition of 
Claw-Plach can not be taken back. It 
is a recent tradition - only 18 years 
old - but it is a tradition none the 
less.</speak>

<info>Claw-Plach Arena. Decapodians have filled the amphitheatre to 
watch the fight. A Decapod child waves a big foam claw. Zoidberg 
walks into the arena and the crowd cheers. The soldiers throw 
Fry in and Zoidberg moves towards him with his claws at the ready.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Get ready, Fry. I'm going to rip your 
swim bladder out and show it to you.</speak>

<info>Leela leans over the edge of the bleachers.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Dr. Zoidberg, this is madness. You're 
being irrational.</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
<info>(shouting)</info> Of course I'm being irrational! 
I'm in love!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Aww.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Leela!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Right, right.  You have to stop this 
madness.</speak>

<speak who="DECAPOD EMPEROR">
Listen, lady, as you can plainly see 
I'm a highly desirable male, groaning 
with jelly. Yet I embrace a life of 
celibacy in order to uphold our crazy 
traditions. One of your friends must 
die.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Fate is cruel and unyielding and what 
must be must be. <info>(shouting)</info> Takin' all 
bets! I'm giving 9-2 on Zoidberg, the 
crab with the jab! The Great Red Hope, 
come on baby!</speak>

<info>Spectators wave their money at Bender. Zoidberg takes Fry aside.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Fry, it's been years since medical school 
so remind me: Disembowelling in your 
species - Fatal or non-fatal?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Fatal.</speak>

<info>Zoidberg holds some cash up to Bender.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Large bet on myself in round one!</speak>

<info>Edna stands by the Emperor.</info>

<speak who="DECAPOD EMPEROR">
Edna, have you anything to say before 
begins the Claw-Plach?</speak>

<speak who="EDNA">
I do. I just want to say that today 
I got up and I had a piece of toast. 
Then I brushed my teeth--</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
<info>(shouting)</info> Shut up!</speak>

<speak who="EDNA">
I love you, Fry!</speak>

<info>Zoidberg growls and reaches his claws out to Fry. Guards restrain 
him.</info>

<speak who="DECAPOD EMPEROR">
Fry, having guessed what animal I was 
thinking of, you shall have first choice 
of weapon.  And you, doctor?</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
I choose my own claws! I want the tactile 
pleasure of chopping him right here 
in the gonads!</speak>

<info>He points at Fry's neck.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Shh! Nobody correct him!</speak>

<info>Bender leans over the bleachers.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Fry, I've never asked you for anything 
before but if it's not too much trouble, 
when it comes to the ninth round just 
let him win.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
But it's a fight to the death!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Oh, so this is suddenly all about you. 
Sheesh!</speak>

<info>He storms off.</info>

<speak who="DECAPOD EMPEROR">
Please rise for the national anthem.</speak>

<info>Decapodians hold their hands to their hearts and a woman plays 
the incidental music from the Star Trek episode Amok Time on 
an organ.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Uh-oh.</speak>

<speak who="DECAPOD EMPEROR">
<info>(shouting)</info> Let Claw-Plach begin!</speak>

<info>Fry and Zoidberg circle each other. Zoidberg spins his claws 
around and Fry does the same with his nutcrackers and whacks 
himself in the eye. Zoidberg scratches a "Z" in Fry's shirt � 
la The Mark of Zorro then scratches "DR" above it. Fry squeals 
and backs away. A bright light starts to shine in his eye. He 
squints and tries to avoid it.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Hey!</speak>

<info>In the stands Bender is reflecting the sunlight off his arm 
and into Fry's face. He chuckles. Leela slaps him.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Ow!</speak>

<info>In the arena Zoidberg takes a dive at Fry and Fry dodges. Zoidberg 
lands in the mud and Fry chuckles. Zoidberg stands on his hands, 
kicks off his sandals and starts chasing Fry, clacking at him 
with his foot claws. The crowds cheer.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
<info>(shouting)</info> Come on, Fry! Die with dignity!</speak>

<info>Zoidberg carries on chasing Fry.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Aha!  Oops!</speak>

<info>He grabs Zoidberg around the neck with the nutcrackers and Zoidberg 
grabs Fry's neck with his claws locking the two together in a 
struggle.</info>

<speak who="EDNA">
<info>(screaming)</info> Nooo! I can't stand to look.</speak>

<info>Zoidberg looks up at her.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Huh?</speak>

<info>Fry dodges his grasp and gains the upper hand by grabbing him 
from behind with the nutcrackers and bringing him to his knees. 
The crowd chants.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Psst, Fry. Take a dive.</speak>

<info>Fry grins and tightens the nutcrackers. Sweat pours down Zoidberg's 
face and the crowd chants.</info>

<speak who="CROWD">
<info>(chanting)</info> Claw-Plach! Claw-Plach! Claw-Plach! 
Claw-Plach!  Claw-Plach! Claw-Plach!</speak>

<info>The crowd gasps.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
My fellow fish monsters. Far be it for 
me to question your stupid civilisation 
or its dumb customs. But is squeezing 
each others brains out with a giant 
nutcracker really going to solve anything? 
Dr. Zoidberg is my friend. And though 
a woman has come between us, I say we'll 
always remain friends. And you know 
why?  One reason.</speak>

<info>Zoidberg cuts his arm off with one clean click of the claws. 
Fry looks at his lifeless arm on the ground and pulls his shirt 
up around his wound.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
You bastard! I'll kill you! You bastard!</speak>

<info>He picks up his dismembered arm and starts beating Zoidberg 
around the head with it. Zoidberg kicks him away and starts to 
choke him.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Wait! Stop! Everyone is gone.</speak>

<info>Zoidberg looks around the empty arena.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Edna? Honey?</speak>

<info>Cut to: Decapod 10 Beach. The mating frenzy meter has filled 
with water.</info>

<info>Cut to: Claw-Plach Arena. They hear the craws of Decapodians.</info>

<info>Cut to: Decapod 10 Beach. They run to the beach and gasp.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Edna?</speak>

<info>Edna and the emperor are holding claws. They scuttle into the 
water along with thousands of other Decapods. They all disappear 
underwater and the sea fills with a green slime.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Ew!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Oh, my God!</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
The frenzy!  Oh, the greatest experience 
in life and I missed it.</speak>

<info>He bursts into tears.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Aw. I'm sorry, Doc.</speak>

<info>He pats him on the back with his severed arm.</info>

<info>Time Lapse. The four walk along the empty beach and seagulls 
fly around them. Zoidberg injects Fry with some St. Jonah's Morphine 
For Children.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Ow, ow! Ah!</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
The frenzy is over. How will I ever 
get rid of my male jelly now?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
I'll lend you this.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Fry!</speak>

<info>A seagull grabs his arm and tries to pull it away from Fry.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Hey, hey.</speak>

<info>Bender is covered in bird faeces.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Shoo! Get away! Hey! What's with the 
flying jerks?</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
They come to feast after the frenzy. 
Once my species passes on its genes, 
it dies.</speak>

<info>He points to the sea which is littered with the corpses of Decapodians.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
You mean you have to choose between 
a life without sex and a gruesome death?</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Yes.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Tough call.</speak>

<info>The ship flies away from Decapod 10.</info>

<info>Cut to: Ships Medical Room.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Well it was nice of you to let me reattach 
your arm, Fry. Especially after I made 
a complete eel out of myself.</speak>

<info>Fry is lying on a table while Leela and Bender watch. He shrugs.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
No biggie.</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Yes biggie. I learned to feel things 
I'd never felt before: Love, jealousy, 
passion for disembowling. I owe it all 
to you.  There! I pronounce the operation 
a success.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Hooray!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Yeah!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
<info>(laughing)</info> Yeah!</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
I may not know from emotions but when 
it comes to medicine, forget about it.</speak>

<info>Fry look at his arm.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
I don't mean to nitpick, super-doc, 
but do you think maybe you could take 
one more whack at this?</speak>

<info>He points at his arm. Zoidberg has attached it to his other 
arm so he has two on the same side. Zoidberg turns around with 
his laser-saw.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
For you, my friend, anything.</speak>

<info>The ship flies towards Earth. Fry screams from inside.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
<info>(from ship)</info> My legs!</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
<info>(from ship)</info> Alright, alright, third 
time's the charm.</speak>

<info>He saws again and another limb falls off and splats.</info></xml>
