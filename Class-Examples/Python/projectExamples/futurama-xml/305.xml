               for Hermes' morning meeting. Nibbler licks himself in the middle 
               of the table.</note>

                         People, we got a problem: Little Nibbler's

                         Now well all love Nibbler, so it's only 
                         fair that we all pitch in and clean 
                         it up together. Still, I propose we

                         He always seemed so full of life. Laughing, 
                         singing, begging for scraps. And now

                         Too true, Femputer. You're so wise. 
                         Kill 'em all, I say. Good riddance! 
                         Did I mention I'm not a man? I'm a manbot. 
                         It's an understandable mistake. You 
                         can let me down now, thanks.

                         And that's how I got my new shell. It 
                         looks just like the shell I threw out 
                         yesterday and I found it in the same 
                         dumpster, but this one had a live raccoon 
                         inside.  Pretty good story, eh, Hermes?

                         It's funny how the battle of the sexes 
                         was only resolved when a Manbot and 
                         a Fembot realised they loved each other.

                         not here. All I know is this gold says 
                         that was the best mission ever!
