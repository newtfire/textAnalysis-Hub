<info>Planet Express: Meeting Room. The staff are sat around the table 
for Hermes' morning meeting. Nibbler licks himself in the middle 
of the table.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
People, we got a problem: Little Nibbler's 
been coughing up hairballs.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Well, so has Fry. What's the big deal?</speak>

<info>Nibbler coughs up a huge one. In amongst the green gloop is 
a white cane. Fry makes an impressed whistle.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
He's got me beat!</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
Now well all love Nibbler, so it's only 
fair that we all pitch in and clean 
it up together. Still, I propose we 
make Zoidberg do it. All in favour?</speak>

<info>Everyone except Zoidberg raises their hands.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Yeah!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Alright, yup.</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
All opposed?  All abstaining?</speak>

<info>Again no one votes. Leela taps Zoidberg on the shoulder.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Dr. Zoidberg? Are you OK?</speak>

<info>He keels over and rests on Fry's shoulder. Fry looks at him.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
He's dead.</speak>

<info>Everyone gasps.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
What?</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
Oh no!</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
He always seemed so full of life. Laughing, 
singing, begging for scraps. And now 
this.</speak>

<info>He takes off his glasses and cries. The door opens and Zoidberg 
walks in wearing a towel. But his body is white-pink and is wobbling 
around like lobster jelly.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Why with all the crying?  So that's 
where I left my shell.</speak>

<info>He wobbles over to the table. Leela picks up the shell.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
I didn't know you could take this thing 
off.</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
It was starting to get a little cramped 
in there so I molted, why not? Ah, the 
fresh air feels good!</speak>

<info>He wobbles around.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Stop doing that!</speak>

<info>Zoidberg tucks his shell under his arm.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
So long. I'm off to toss this old shell 
in the dumpster and maybe pick up those 
potato chips Amy didn't finish yesterday.</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
Those were toenail clippings.</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
A feast is a feast.</speak>

<info>He turns around and leaves. His shell has a huge hole down the 
back of it. As he walks out his towel falls off. The sound of 
a phone ringing comes from the lounge.</info>

<speak who="AMY">
Hey, that's my cellphone!</speak>

<info>She runs off.</info>

<info>Cut to: Planet Express: Lounge. Amy runs in and picks her tiny 
cellphone up off the huge CellMate. She answers.</info>

<speak who="AMY">
Hello?  Hello? Who is this?  Hello? 
Hello?</speak>

<info>They hang up and she curses. Leela walks in.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
What's wrong? Did you swallow your phone 
again?</speak>

<info>She sits down.</info>

<speak who="AMY">
Some guy's been calling and hanging 
up 10 times a day for a year.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Men who call too much are the worst 
... I bet.</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
I just wish a decent guy would call 
me instead of this spleeze-ball who 
has me too terrified to even answer 
the phone.  Hello?</speak>

<info>The same heavy breathing comes from the other end again.</info>

<info>Kif's Quarters. On the Nimbus, Kif sits on his bed holding the 
phone and trembling. He tries to say something but just gasps 
and stutters.</info>

<speak who="AMY">
Hello? Is anyone there?</speak>

<info>Kif hangs up.</info>

<speak who="KIF">
I love you.  Why must I be such a coward?</speak>

<info>He cries. Enter Zapp.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Kif, I'm headed to the men's room and 
I'll be needing an attendant so-- Oh, 
I'm sorry. You're crying like a woman. 
It's alright. I've always thought myself 
as a father figure to some of my more 
pathetic men. Kif, old friend, let's 
rap.</speak>

<info>He sits on Kif's bed. Kif sighs.</info>

<speak who="KIF">
Well, I'm in love with this girl--</speak>

<info>Zapp bursts out laughing and pats Kif on the back.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
<info>(laughing)</info> Oh, that's rich! <info>(talking)</info> 
Go on.</speak>

<speak who="KIF">
I met her a year ago...</speak>

<info>Flashback. The Titanic escape pod flies away from the doomed 
ship.</info>

<speak who="KIF">
<info>(voice-over)</info> ...when we were escaping 
from that cruise ship you piloted directly 
into a black hole.</speak>

<info>Amy and Kif watch from the escape pod as the Titanic is sucked 
into the black hole.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
<info>(voice-over; proud)</info> Yes! It was in all 
the papers.</speak>

<info>Back on Earth the escape pod has landed outside the Planet Express 
building. Bender dumps the Countess De La Roca's fake bracelet 
in a bin and walks into the building with the other staff. Amy 
kisses Kif and gives him her number.</info>

<speak who="AMY">
Call me.</speak>

<info>Kif takes the paper and she goes inside. He trembles and gasps 
and breathes heavily some more.</info>

<info>Flashback ends. Zapp goes along with the story.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Uh-huh, uh-huh. Mm-hmm, uh-huh.</speak>

<speak who="KIF">
I've finished talking, sir.</speak>

<info>Zapp sees something on Kif's wall.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Belay that remark!  Your Amy knows my 
Leela? I have formed an idea!</speak>

<info>Nimbus Bridge. Leela is on the viewscreen, Zapp is in his chair 
and Kif hides behind it. Amy walks in behind Leela.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
I'm calling to negotiate a double date. 
You and me, Kif and Amy.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Forget it.</speak>

<info>Cut to: Planet Express: Meeting Room. She turns away from the 
screen.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Then let the negotiations begin. I 
propose we go out on 10 dates.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
How about zero?</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Nine.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Zero.</speak>

<info>Cut to: Nimbus Bridge.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Seven.</speak>

<info>Cut to: Planet Express: Meeting Room.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Zero.</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Eight?</speak>

<info>Amy leans down at Leela's side.</info>

<speak who="AMY">
<info>(whispering)</info> Please, Leela? Kif's like 
the sweetest guy who's ever liked me.</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Five, and that's my final offer ... 
four.</speak>

<info>Leela sighs.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
One.</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Two.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
One half.</speak>

<info>Cut to: Nimbus Bridge.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
I'll take it.</speak>

<info>Cut to: Planet Express: Meeting Room.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
We'll meet you tonight for part of 
dinner and the first half of a movie.</speak>

<info>He hangs up and Amy grins.</info>

<info>Le Palm D'Orbit Coat Check. Le Palm D'Orbit is a restaurant 
orbiting a big, green planet. The main part of the restaurant 
looks like the Encounter Restaurant at Los Angeles airport. A 
centipede-like alien leaves his coat at the coat check which 
charges a 25 cent surcharge for every sleeve over nine. Zapp 
walks in wearing his formal off-white DOOP uniform. Kif wears 
a tie and jacket over his regular velour uniform and carries 
some flowers and a box of chocolates.</info>

<speak who="KIF">
Um, sir? I don't go out on many dates 
and, um, what if I can't think of anything 
to say?</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Here's my personal book of pickup lines. 
Say as many of them as you can as fast 
as you can. Don't stop for any reason.</speak>

<speak who="KIF">
Maybe I'll just give her these flowers.</speak>

<info>Zapp takes them and hits Kif with them.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Wrong, wrong, wrong! And what's that? 
Candy? Candy's for dorks! Give me that. 
Mmm!</speak>

<info>Le Palm D'Orbit. The restaurant pilot is also the maitre d'. 
He takes his hands off the wheel to hand some people a menu. 
Amy and Leela are already at the table. Amy wears a light blue 
dress and Leela wears her black jacket. Zapp and Kif arrive.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Hello, beautiful. I got these for you.</speak>

<info>He hands her Kif's flowers and sits down.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Thanks.</speak>

<info>She sets fire to them and puts them in Zapp's glass of water.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Well, well. This looks to be one disturbingly 
erotic date.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Half-date.</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Waiter, bring us a bottle of wine.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Half-bottle.</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
And some oysters on the half-shell.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Quarter-shell.</speak>

<speak who="KIF">
Oh, and I'd like--</speak>

<info>Zapp puts his hand over Kif's mouth.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Kif's not hungry. <info>(quietly)</info> Kif, this 
place is expensive. <info>(talking)</info> I'd like 
two steaks and the ladies will have 
some very sensual salads -- with low-cal 
sensual dressing.</speak>

<info>Amy smiles at Kif and he giggles.</info>

<info>Time Lapse. It's Kareoke Night at the restaurant and Morbo sings 
Lipps Inc's Funkytown.</info>

<speak who="MORBO">
<info>(singing)</info> Oh, won't you take me to funkytown,

Oh, won't you take me to funkytown.

</speak><info>The song ends and the audience applauds.</info>

<info>(talking)</info> Thank you.

<info>At the table the meals have arrived.</info>

<speak who="AMY">
Kif, you're so quiet. You haven't said 
a word all night.</speak>

<speak who="KIF">
Well, um, um ... hello.</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
'Cause I was really hoping we could 
talk and stuff.</speak>

<info>Kif stutters and gasps then drinks a glass of wine and takes 
out Zapp's book. Zapp smirks and picks his teeth with a toothpick.</info>

<speak who="KIF">
Amy, <info>(reading)</info> if I said you had a beautiful 
body would you take your pants off and 
dance around a little?</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
What?!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Lieutenant Kroker!</speak>

<info>Zapp winks at Kif and gives a thumbs up. Kif gasps and reads 
some more.</info>

<speak who="KIF">
<info>(reading)</info> I find the most erotic part 
of the woman is the boobies</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
Kif!</speak>

<speak who="KIF">
Oh, my!</speak>

<info>Leela stands up.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
This half-date is entirely over. Amy? 
Conference!</speak>

<info>They walk away and Kif groans.</info>

<speak who="KIF">
Is there nothing we can do, sir?</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
There's only one sure-fire way back 
into a woman's heart and parts beyond. 
I speak of course, of kareoke.</speak>

<speak who="KIF">
<info>(determined)</info> My years in the DOOP Boys' 
Chorus will not have been in vain!</speak>

<info>Cut to: Le Palm D'Orbit Women's Room. Leela and Amy apply lipstick 
with a handy device that doesn't touch their lips.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Alright, enough lipstick. Let's storm 
out.</speak>

<info>Cut to: Le Palm D'Orbit. They walk out of the women's room and 
notice Kif starting to sing Bonnie Tyler's Total Eclipse Of The 
Heart.</info>

<speak who="KIF">
<info>(singing)</info> Once upon a time I was falling 
in love,

But now I'm only falling apart...

</speak><speak who="AMY">
Oh, that's so emotional!</speak>

<speak who="KIF">
<info>(singing)</info> ...There's nothing I can do,

A total eclipse of the heart--

</speak><info>Zapp walks onto the stage and pushes Kif aside. Kif drops the 
mic and Zapp catches it and spins it around.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Amateur hour's over.  Let me show you 
why they call me "The Velour Fog"! Hit 
it!</speak>

<info>The jukebox changes to some different music. Zapp smokes a cigarette 
and starts singing The Kinks' Lola.</info>

<info>(spoken-word)</info> I met her in a club down in old Soho,

Where you drink champagne and it tastes just like Coca-Cola,

C-O-L-A .. .Cola.

<speak who="MAN">
Aw, give us a break!</speak>

<speak who="WOMAN">
Get off!</speak>

<speak who="CHEF">
He sickens me!</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
<info>(spoken-word)</info> She walked up to me and 
she asked me to dance,

I asked her her name and in a dark brown voice she said

<info>(singing)</info> Leela!

L-E-E-L-A, Leela!

Lee-Lee-Lee-Lee-Leela!

Ba-ba-ba-dum-ba-dum-bum!

</speak><info>People get out of their seats and run around screaming.</info>

Leelaaa!

<info>He breaks the glass and a man presses a button for the emergency 
escape pods. People spill into them.</info>

<info>Cut to: Outside Le Palm D'Orbit. The escape pods eject and fly 
off into space.</info>

<info>Cut to: Le Palm D'Orbit. Zapp finishes singing. The restaurant 
is deserted.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
We're going home. Call us a space taxi.</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
No need. There's not a restaurant built 
I can't fly. Where to, ladies?</speak>

<speak who="KIF">
Please, sir. Let's just divide up the 
check and--</speak>

<info>Zapp starts pressing buttons on the steering controls.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Let's see what this eatery can do.</speak>

<info>Cut to: Outside Le Palm D'Orbit. The headlights and indicators 
flash, the windscreen wipers swish back and forth and windows 
open and close. The restaurant blasts forwards and knocks a few 
ships away from the car park.</info>

<info>Cut to: Le Palm D'Orbit.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Ah, she's built like a steakhouse, but 
she handles like a bistro.  She's out 
of control!</speak>

<info>Cut to: Outside Le Palm D'Orbit.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
<info>(from inside)</info> You win again, gravity!</speak>

<info>Everyone screams as the restaurant tumbles towards the green 
planet.</info>

<info>Planet Express: Lounge. The next day, Fry, Bender and Hermes 
sit watching TV. Zoidberg walks in still without a shell and 
carrying a purple J. Crab catalogue.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Look what arrived: My new shell catalogue. 
So let's try some on already!  Ah! Muy 
macho! Hey, gringos! Here comes El Zoido 
to ruin your drinking water!</speak>

<info>He points claws at them like guns and imitates gunfire.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Whoa, whoa, whoa! I'm Mexican and I 
find that offensive.</speak>

<info>He opens his chest cabinet. "Hecho En Mexico" is etched on the 
inside of his door. He closes it and it falls off.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
You Latins are so hot-blooded!  This 
one's like a summer guy!</speak>

<info>He turns around revealing his lobster ass.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
Look, you fat fish. The Planet Express 
health plan only covers one kind of 
replacement shell.</speak>

<info>He changes the shell to a simple white shell with a barcode 
and "Shell" printed on it. Zoidberg groans and Hermes closes 
the catalogue. Zoidberg wobbles out towards the meeting room.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
I can't believe Leela and Amy aren't 
back yet from their half-date. I'm gonna 
call the restaurant.</speak>

<info>He picks up the phone and dials Le Palm D'Orbit. The dial tone 
changes to the "unavailable" beeps.</info>

<speak who="OPERATOR">
The number you have dialled has crashed 
into a planet. Please make a note of 
it.</speak>

<info>Fry and Bender gasp. Fry gets up.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
We gotta go rescue them!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Eh, I don't know.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Bender! Think of the se�oritas!</speak>

<info>Bender leaps up.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
V�monos!</speak>

<info>Planet Surface. Kif, Amy, Zapp and Leela sit amid the burning 
wreckage of Le Palm D'Orbit.</info>

<speak who="KIF">
So, Amy, um, well--</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
It's always a line with you!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
What planet is this anyway?</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
<info>(mumbling)</info> I 'unno. <info>(talking)</info> This whole 
sector is uncharted.</speak>

<speak who="KIF">
It is not uncharted, you lost the chart!</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Well, nothing to do now but repopulate 
the human race.  Just me and you!  <info>(whispering)</info> 
And maybe you.</speak>

<info>Crashing sounds come from the woods around them and the ground 
starts to shake.</info>

<speak who="AMY">
What is it?</speak>

<info>She looks at the water in her cup which ripples like the glass 
of water in Jurassic Park. Leela watches a puddle ripple and 
it gives the impression that she has two eyes. Zapp's gut jiggles. 
They all tremble and hide behind a piece of wreckage. Growling 
comes from the woods and a huge foot stomps on the group's campfire. 
The foot belongs to a huge woman -- an Amazonian. Her name is 
Kug and she has a blue hairdo and wears very little. Two others 
are with her: Ornik, a darker Amazonian with dreads and Tonk, 
a blonde.</info>

<speak who="KUG">
Me hear people. But me not see people.</speak>

<speak who="THOG">
No big deal. Everybody make mistake.</speak>

<info>They turn to leave. Leela gestures for Amy and Kif to keep quiet. 
Zapp peers over the top of the wreckage with a big grin on his 
face. He turns on the charm.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Well, hello! I usually don't say this 
but you are the most beautiful trio 
of gigantic ladies I've ever laid eyes 
on.  <info>(reading)</info> I find the most erotic 
part of a woman is the boo--</speak>

<info>Kug grabs him by the head and drags him away. Ornik drags Kif 
by his feet and Tonk carries Amy and Leela over her shoulders.</info>

<info>The Planet Express ship flies erratically towards Amazonia.</info>

<info>Cut to: Ships Cockpit. Bender runs around panicking while Fry 
steers wildly and presses random buttons. Alarms wail.</info>

<info>Cut to: Amazonia Surface. The ship flies towards the smoking 
wreckage of Le Palm D'Orbit and smacks down onto the ground, 
the landing gear lowering just a little too late. Fry and Bender 
run down the steps and see the wreckage.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Oh, no! Any sign of Leela or Amy?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
No. But what do you make of this?</speak>

<info>He picks up a giant hairclip.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
I don't know. But it might have something 
to do with this.</speak>

<info>He holds up a huge can of Tab.</info>

<info>Time Lapse. Bender peers through some huge grass blades and 
gasps.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Oh, your God!</speak>

<info>Fry looks through the grass. In front of them several Amazonians 
have gathered. Kug, Thog and Ornik lead Amy, Leela, Zapp and 
Kif into a ring at the front of the crowd. Around them is an 
Amazonian city, with buildings made of wood and straw.</info>

<speak who="KUG">
Move! Go!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Alright, here's the plan--</speak>

<info>Something grunts.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
What kind of moronic plan is that?  
Wow!</speak>

<info>The Amazonian hits them with her club.</info>

<info>Time Lapse. Fry and Bender are in chains with Zapp and Kif. 
Leela and Amy are freed.</info>

<speak who="THOG">
Women go free. Men stay in chains.</speak>

<speak who="ORNIK">
We take them to our leader. She know 
what do.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Pfft. A female leader?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Fry, shut up.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Yes, captain!</speak>

<info>Amazonian City. The Amazonians lead Leela, Amy and the prisoners 
past the buildings.</info>

<speak who="THOG">
This capital city planet Amazonia.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Where are all the men in your society?</speak>

<speak who="ORNIK">
Men die out many year ago.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
With all these women around they were 
probably nagged to death. Are you with 
me, fellas?</speak>

<info>He, Zapp and Fry laugh. The women glare at them and they suddenly 
stop laughing.</info>

<info>Outside Basketball Pitch. The group watch a woman bounce a basketball.</info>

<speak who="THOG">
Here stadium, where our women basketball 
teams play.</speak>

<speak who="KUG">
We no can dunk, but good fundamentals.</speak>

<speak who="ORNIK">
That more fun to watch.</speak>

<info>Zapp, Fry and Bender laugh.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
<info>(laughing)</info> Oh, God, you're killing me! 
Ow! God, you're killing me!</speak>

<info>Outside The Drollery Domicile.</info>

<speak who="THOG">
This our comedy club. Humour here funny 
in different way.</speak>

<speak who="ORNIK">
It not reinforce stereotypes.</speak>

<speak who="KUG">
Comedy come from character, real situations. 
Not abstract craziness.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Translation: Boring!  <info>(laughing)</info> That's 
a good one!  Ow!</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
This women-only planet is sounding better 
and better.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
I'm already looking for apartments.</speak>

<info>She looks through a free "Westside Cave Rentals" brochure.</info>

<info>Outside Femputer Temple. The stone temple has a woman's face 
carved into it and smoking boobies.</info>

<speak who="THOG">
Here live vengeful, all-knowing leader. 
She decide men's fate.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Is she hot?</speak>

<speak who="THOG">
That not important. She all-knowing.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
In other words, "No".  Ow!</speak>

<info>Femputer Temple. Leela, Amy and the Amazonians and their prisoners 
walk into the dimly-lit building. Amazonians stand around the 
room. Three Amazonians bow before a wall and the wall turns around 
revealing a huge piece of technology with dials and flickering 
lights.</info>

<speak who="THOG">
<info>(chanting)</info> All hail Femputer.</speak>

<speak who="KUG AND ORNIK">
<info>(chanting)</info> All hail Femputer.</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
You all obey a big computer?</speak>

<speak who="KUG">
Yes. It appear mysteriously just about 
time men die out.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
So why did you make it your leader?</speak>

<speak who="ORNIK">
It seemed like different kind of politician.</speak>

<speak who="KUG">
Not beltway insider.</speak>

<info>Thog holds something up to the Femputer.</info>

<speak who="THOG">
Femputer, we bring offering of bath 
beads and scented soaps.</speak>

<speak who="FEMPUTER">
Your gift pleases Femputer. Femputer 
demands to know why there are men on 
her planet.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
It was an accident, ma'am.</speak>

<speak who="FEMPUTER">
That does not fempute. Femputer will 
return after deciding your punishment.</speak>

<info>She spins around out of sight.</info>

<info>Time Lapse. Kif, Zapp, Fry and Bender are shackled to the wall.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Leela, I'm through making fun of women. 
Now I want them to help me.</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
Should we do something?</speak>

<info>Ornik chokes Fry with a strap.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
There's no hurry.</speak>

<info>Kug tightens the strap around Zapp's neck.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Yes! A little tighter.  Tighter. Perhaps 
a hard spanking is in order?  Too hard!</speak>

<info>She turns to Amy and Leela.</info>

<speak who="KUG">
Men strange. You have them on your planet?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
<info>(ashamed)</info> I'm afraid so.</speak>

<speak who="KUG">
What they for?  Oh, you mean "snu-snu".</speak>

<info>The other Amazonians murmur.</info>

<speak who="THOG">
We hear tell men used for snu-snu. But 
all we have go on are ancient legend 
and subscription to Cosmo.</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Just FYI, I could be used for snu-snu.</speak>

<speak who="THOG">
Silence. You want die like last men 
visit Amazonia?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
What'd they die of?</speak>

<speak who="KUG">
Crushed pelvises.</speak>

<info>In the corner some happy little skeletons lie against the wall 
with broken pelvises. One enjoyed himself so much he is still 
holding the cigarette.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Yes!</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Oh, thank you, Lord in heaven!</speak>

<info>The Femputer returns.</info>

<speak who="FEMPUTER">
After lengthy femputations, I, Femputer, 
have decided the fate of the men. Femputer 
sentences them to death.  By snu-snu!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
<info>(cheering)</info> Yay!</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
<info>(cheering)</info> Yeah!  <info>(talking)</info> What are 
you, gay?</speak>

<speak who="FEMPUTER">
Death to the men. Death by snu-snu.</speak>

<info>The prisoners whimper.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Although the snu-snu part's gonna be 
pretty good.</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Baby, it'll blow your mind.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Femputer, be reasonable. Sure men are 
annoying and they wreck up whatever 
planet they're in charge of. But most 
of these men are sorta my friends. They 
don't deserve to die.</speak>

<speak who="FEMPUTER">
Hmm. Perhaps men are not as evil as 
Femputer thinks.</speak>

<speak who="THOG">
But they make fun women's basketball.</speak>

<speak who="FEMPUTER">
What?! Did you explain how the women's 
good fundamentals make up for their 
inability to dunk?</speak>

<speak who="ORNIK">
Yes. They still laugh.</speak>

<speak who="FEMPUTER">
The men must die.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Too true, Femputer. You're so wise. 
Kill 'em all, I say. Good riddance! 
Did I mention I'm not a man? I'm a manbot. 
It's an understandable mistake. You 
can let me down now, thanks.</speak>

<speak who="KUG">
He big jerk like man.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
I sure am. But check the crotch.  Nothing.</speak>

<speak who="FEMPUTER">
Very well, release him. As for the others, 
take them to the snu-snu chambers.</speak>

<info>Kif's jaw drops in fear followed by Zapp's and Fry's. Zapp and 
Fry change to happy smiling, then back to fear, then happy, then 
fear...</info>

<info>Outside Snu-Snu Chambers. The Amazonians carry Fry, Kif and 
Zapp towards the snu-snu chambers under the moonlit sky.</info>

<info>Snu-Snu Chambers. Fry, Zapp and Kif stand in their underpants 
with their hands tied behind them and their feet bound. Several 
Amazonians have gathered to watch along with Amy, Leela and Bender.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
<info>(crying)</info> I'll miss you, meatbag.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Me too, meatbag.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Goodbye, friends. I never thought I 
would die like this. But I'd always 
really hoped.</speak>

<info>Femputer gives instructions over the Sonya loudspeaker.</info>

<speak who="AMAZONIANS">
<info>(chanting)</info> Snu-snu, snu-snu, snu-snu!</speak>

<info>Thog starts untying Kif's hands.</info>

<speak who="KIF">
Amy. Before I die, I have to tell you: 
I didn't mean to say those awful things 
on our date. They were all Zapp's idea.</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
Really? Honest and true?</speak>

<speak who="KIF">
Yes. And-And that person calling and 
hanging up, was me. I was just too nervous 
to say hello because I love you.</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
Oh, Kif!</speak>

<speak who="THOG">
It Thog's first time.  Be gentle!</speak>

<info>She flings him over her shoulder and walks into the snu-snu 
chamber. Ornik and Kug drag Fry and Zapp into two other chambers.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
We've got to do something. Bender, maybe 
you can interface with the Femputer 
and reprogram it to let them go.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Maybe you can interface with my ass. 
By biting it!  Alright, I'll go!</speak>

<info>He walks off mocking Amy's curse. Ornik and Kug walk out of 
the chambers and two new women walk in. Fry and Zapp groan from 
inside then cheer.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
<info>(from inside)</info> Ooh! Yeah!</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
<info>(from inside)</info> Oh, baby!</speak>

<info>They groan and scream again.</info>

<info>Outside Femputer Temple. Bender runs up one side and hides behind 
one of the stone boobies. Two guards sit on the steps.</info>

<speak who="GUARD #1">
How Tonk look?</speak>

<speak who="GUARD #2">
Tonk look good. Me fat.</speak>

<speak who="GUARD #1">
No, you look good. Tonk fat.</speak>

<info>Bender mocks them with the yack-yack gesture. They walk down 
the steps and Bender sneaks inside.</info>

<info>Cut to: Femputer Temple. The Femputer is facing outwards.</info>

<speak who="FEMPUTER">
Intruder! Stay away from the mighty 
Femputer! Guards!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Time to override the CPU and reprogram 
this Femputer.</speak>

<info>He takes out a pipe and starts hitting the Femputer.</info>

<speak who="FEMPUTER">
Hey, whoa, whoa! Stop it! Stop it! Hey, 
cut that out!</speak>

<info>A panel falls down revealing a hollow section of the Femputer 
with a bed, a curtain and lots of levers. Also a Fembot.</info>

<speak who="FEMBOT">
Cease hitting Femputer!</speak>

<info>She turns around and sees Bender and screams.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
You're no Femputer, you're a Fembot!</speak>

<speak who="FEMBOT">
<info>(ashamed)</info> It's true. I disguised myself 
as a Femputer so I could rule the Amazonians.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
But why?</speak>

<speak who="FEMBOT">
Why? Why? I came here from a faraway 
planet. A planet ruled by a chauvinistic 
Manputer that was really a Manbot. Have 
you any idea how it feels to be a Fembot 
living in a Manbot's Manputer's world?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
What?</speak>

<speak who="FEMBOT">
And now, my meddling Manbot, there's 
the question of what to do with you!</speak>

<info>She narrows her eyes and moves towards him. He backs away, waving 
his arms and panicking.</info>

<info>Snu-Snu Chambers. The Amazonians are queued up waiting for their 
snu-snu. Fry and Zapp walk out, gasping.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
<info>(gasping)</info> We need rest. The spirit is 
willing but the flesh is spongy and 
bruised.</speak>

<speak who="ORNIK">
It time snu-snu!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Can't we just cuddle?  <info>(screaming)</info> Nooo!</speak>

<info>She carries him inside. Kug picks up Zapp. He groans and she 
takes him in.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
We can't wait for Bender. It's time 
for a woman's touch.  Yah! Hi-yah! Yah, 
yah yah!</speak>

<info>An Amazonian picks her up by her ponytail, throws her on the 
floor and sits on her. Amy walks past on stilts. She has put 
a bone through her hair and torn her dress.</info>

<speak who="AMY">
<info>(disguised, deeper voice)</info> Me next snu-snu. 
Out me way.</speak>

<info>She walks into a snu-snu chamber.</info>

<info>Cut to: Kif's Snu-Snu Chamber. Thog looks under a bed.</info>

<speak who="THOG">
Where go beautiful man?  Me want snu-snu!</speak>

<info>She pokes him with a broom and he runs around the ceiling, his 
hands and feet sticking to it. Amy walks in. She sees Kif and 
Thog and gasps. She jumps off the stilts and holds out her arms.</info>

<speak who="AMY">
Kif! Jump!</speak>

<info>He lands in her arms.</info>

<speak who="KIF">
My hero!</speak>

<info>They kiss and run.</info>

<info>Outside Femputer Temple. Amy runs past the steps still carrying 
Kif with the Amazonians chasing her.</info>

<speak who="THOG">
<info>(shouting)</info> Me not get snu-snu! Get him!</speak>

<info>They chase her around the side of the temple. Ornik, Kug and 
another group of Amazonians block her path. She gasps and ducks 
through a crack in the wall.</info>

<info>Cut to: Femputer Temple. Amy runs towards the Femputer and the 
Amazonians run in and corner her. Thog gets on her knees in front 
of the Femputer.</info>

<speak who="THOG">
Mighty Femputer. Small girl steal green 
kissy man. We kill her now?</speak>

<speak who="FEMBOT">
<info>(from inside)</info> Come back later. Leave 
me alone.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
<info>(from inside)</info> Yeah, get lost!  <info>(spookily)</info> 
Ooh! I'm a scary Femputer. Release the 
prisoners!  <info>(from inside)</info> And bring 
gold. Lots of gold.</speak>

<speak who="THOG">
Gold? Why Femputer want gold?</speak>

<speak who="FEMBOT">
<info>(from inside)</info> You heard the man.</speak>

<info>They giggle again. Amy and Kif smile and walk out.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
<info>(from inside)</info> C'mon! Gimmie some of 
that!</speak>

<info>Planet Express: Lounge. Hermes and Zoidberg stand at the water 
cooler.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
And that's how I got my new shell. It 
looks just like the shell I threw out 
yesterday and I found it in the same 
dumpster, but this one had a live raccoon 
inside.  Pretty good story, eh, Hermes?</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
Stick to someone else, you windy barnacle�</speak>

<info>Leela, Bender and Farnsworth sat at the table.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
It's funny how the battle of the sexes 
was only resolved when a Manbot and 
a Fembot realised they loved each other.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Yeah. By the way, if she calls, I'm 
not here. All I know is this gold says 
that was the best mission ever!</speak>

<info>He closes his door. Inside and on the table are big bars of 
gold. On the couch Kif yawns and puts his arm around Amy. She 
giggles.</info>

<speak who="AMY">
It sure was.</speak>

<info>Fry and Zapp stand nearby in body casts and leaning on crutches.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Oh, yeah!</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
I had snu-snu!</speak>

<speak who="KIF">
So, um, Amy, w-what do you wanna do 
now?</speak>

<info>Amy whispers something in his ear and smiles. He gasps and stutters.</info>

<info>THE END</info></xml>
