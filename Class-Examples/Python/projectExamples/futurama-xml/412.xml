<info>Opening Credits. Caption: Where No Fan Has Gone Before.</info>

<info>In the establishing shot, Star Trek-like music plays and the 
Planet Express ship flies through space with the trademark warp 
nacelles featured in Star Trek attached to it.</info>

<speak who="SHATNER">
<info>(voice-over)</info> Shatner's log, airdate 
... unknown.</speak>

<info>Cut to: Ships Cargo Bay. The room has been converted to resemble 
a court setting. Zapp Brannigan is judge while Bender and Leela 
sit with the heads in jars of William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, 
George Takei, Walter Koenig, DeForest Kelley and Nichelle Nichols.</info>

<speak who="SHATNER">
The impossible has happened. It would 
take days to recount the events I have 
witnessed. So, settle in. It all began--</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Quiet, you! This court martial is now 
in session. The honourably sexy Zapp 
Brannigan residing. Bring in the accused.</speak>

<info>Kif wheels in Fry in the wheelchair used by Captain Pike in 
the Star Trek episode The Menagerie. Fry looks paralysed. The 
heads gasp.</info>

<speak who="TAKEI">
Oh, my!</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Philip J. Fry, you stand accused of 
travelling to the forbidden planet Omega 
3, a crime punishable by 12 concurrent 
death sentences. Do you understand the 
charges?</speak>

<info>Kif leans over Fry's shoulder.</info>

<speak who="KIF">
One beep for "yes", two beeps for "no".</speak>

<info>Fry beeps once.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">"Yes". So noted. Do you plead guilty? 
Double "yes". Guilty! I will now carry 
out the punishment. Kif, my gun.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Wait! He plead not guilty.</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Order!  Order in the court! Very well 
then, Mr. Fry. Please recount the events 
that led you to be guilty.</speak>

<info>Fry beeps in Morse code.</info>

<info>Flashback. "A Few Days Earlier".</info>

<info>Rent-A-Wreck Video. Fry, Leela, Bender and Zoidberg look at 
the videos on the shelves.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
The Professor said he was taking a brief 
nap, so we only have time for six movies.</speak>

<info>Bender scoops up some videos.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Lets take these six Jim Carrey movies 
and record over them.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
You know what movies average out to 
be really good? The first six Star Trek 
movies!</speak>

<info>The rest of the crew gasp, a camera zooms in on Fry and other 
customers panic.</info>

<speak who="CLERK">
<info>(shouting)</info> Everybody hit the deck!</speak>

<info>Everybody falls to the floor.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
<info>(whispering)</info> Sh! Those words are forbidden!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
What words? Star Trek?</speak>

<info>A klaxon goes off and a red light flashes.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Sh!</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Shut your gills!</speak>

<info>A siren is heard from outside.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
That sound! It's patrol car 718! Hide 
him!</speak>

<info>Leela and Zoidberg grab Fry and stuff him in Bender's chest 
cabinet.</info>

<info>Cut to: Outside Rent-A-Wreck Video. Leela, Bender and Zoidberg 
leave as Smitty and URL pull up and run into the shop without 
noticing them.</info>

<info>Flashback ends.</info>

<info>Fade to: Ships Cargo Bay. Fry is still beeping.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
The court is intrigued. Perhaps we could 
hear more about these forbidden words 
from someone with a sexilly seductive 
voice.</speak>

<info>Nichelle Nichols is about to speak.</info>

<speak who="TAKEI">
With pleasure. You see, the show was 
banned after the Star Trek wars.</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
You mean after the vast migration of 
Star Wars fans?</speak>

<speak who="NICHOLS">
No, that was the Star Wars trek.  By 
the 23rd century, Star Trek fandom had 
evolved from a loose association of 
nerds with skin problems into a full-blown 
religion.</speak>

<info>On the screen, a service is held at the Church Of Trek.</info>

<speak who="PRIEST">
And Scotty beamed them to the Klingon 
ship where they would be no Tribble 
at all.</speak>

<speak who="CONGREGATION">
All power to the engines.</speak>

<speak who="NICHOLS">
As country after country fell under 
its influence, world leaders became 
threatened by the movements power.  
And so the Trekkies were executed in 
the manner most befitting virgins.</speak>

<info>On the rim of a volcano two men throw Trekkies into the flames.</info>

<speak who="MAN">
He's dead, Jim!  He's dead, Jim!  He's 
dead, Jim!</speak>

<speak who="NICHOLS">
Finally, the sacred texts were banned.</speak>

<info>The episodes are put inside a torpedo casing.</info>

<speak who="TAKEI">
The last copies of the 79 episodes and 
six movies were dumped on the forbidden 
world Omega 3. Along with that blooper 
reel where the door doesn't close all 
the way.</speak>

<info>As he speaks a ship that looks like an Eagle from Space 1999 
fires the torpedo. It hits the planet like Spock's coffin hit 
the Genesis planet in Star Trek: The Wrath Of Khan. The video 
ends.</info>

<speak who="NIMOY">
Thus, Star Trek was forever scoured 
from human memory.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Another classic science-fiction show 
cancelled before its time.</speak>

<info>Zapp tuts.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
I've never heard of such a brutal and 
shocking injustice that I cared so little 
about. Next witness.</speak>

<speak who="KIF">
Bender the robot, please take the stand.</speak>

<info>Fry steps out of the wheelchair, perfectly healthy.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
She's all yours, buddy!</speak>

<info>Bender gets in.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
I'd only met the defendant, Fry, once, 
but I knew he was up to no good.</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Please use the beeps.</speak>

<info>Bender grumbles and starts to beep.</info>

<info>Flashback.</info>

<info>Fade to: Head Museum. Fry runs into the 20th century room.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Mr. Nimoy, I came as soon as I heard 
what happened centuries ago. I can't 
believe your show was banned.</speak>

<speak who="NIMOY">
I have absolutely no idea what you're 
talking about.</speak>

<info>A camera tracks Fry but he ignores it.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
You know? 1966? 79 episodes, about 30 
good ones.</speak>

<speak who="NIMOY">
Oh, really, I've done too many things 
to remember one particular TV series. 
But if-if you want to discuss my books 
of poetry--</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Come on! Remember that episode where 
you go high on spores and smacked Kirk 
around?</speak>

<speak who="NIMOY">
No. Perhaps you're thinking of my one 
man show about Vincent van Spock-- Uh, 
uh, I mean van Gogh! Damn!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Aha! You can't escape it!</speak>

<speak who="NIMOY">
<info>(crying)</info> Oh, you're right, I can't.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Uh, jeez, don't get upset. I mean, OK 
I outwitted you, but--</speak>

<speak who="NIMOY">
<info>(crying)</info> No, it's my fellow cast members. 
300 years ago they left Earth behind.</speak>

<info>Flashback ... again.</info>

<info>Fade to: Launch Pad. Star Trek cast members' heads in jars are 
loaded into a rocket.</info>

<speak who="SHATNER">
This planet doesn't appreciate us anymore, 
Leonard.</speak>

<speak who="NIMOY">
Bill, you are, and always shall be, 
my friend. But I just signed a six-month 
lease on my apartment. I can't walk 
away from a commitment like that.</speak>

<speak who="SHATNER">
Very well, my friend.</speak>

<info>His jar is loaded into the rocket. The rocket blasts off leaving 
Nimoy behind.</info>

<info>Flashback ends.</info>

<info>Fade to: Head Museum. Nimoy sobs.</info>

<speak who="NIMOY">
<info>(crying)</info> Why did the world turn its 
back on our obvious greatness?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
I'm literally angry with rage! Your 
co-stars may be gone but we can still 
get those episode tapes back for the 
whole world to see. Come on!</speak>

<speak who="NIMOY">
Oh!</speak>

<info>He grabs Nimoy's jar from the shelf, tucks it under his arm 
and runs out. Jonathan Frakes' jar hops forward.</info>

<speak who="FRAKES">
Yes! Front row!</speak>

<info>Ships Cockpit. The ship is in the hangar and Fry starts to power 
it up.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
You can't go to Omega 3; It's forbidden! 
I forbid you!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
But we have to! The world needs Star 
Trek to give people hope for the future.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
But it's set 800 years in the past!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Yeah, why is this so important to you?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
'Cause it-it taught me so much. Like 
how you should accept people, whether 
they be black, white, Klingon or even 
female. But most importantly, when I 
didn't have any friends, it made me 
feel like maybe I did.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Well, that is touchingly pathetic. I 
guess I can't let you go alone.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
I'll go too, with Leonard's permission, 
of course.</speak>

<info>Nimoy nods.</info>

<info>The ship flies into a solar system.</info>

<info>Cut to: Ships Cockpit.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
We're entering the Omega system.</speak>

<info>An alarm goes off.</info>

<speak who="COMPUTER VOICE">
Warning: You are now in forbidden space.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Forbidden shmer-shmidden! What are they 
gonna do, write a letter? <info>(sarcastic)</info> 
Ooh, I'm so scared!</speak>

<info>The ship shakes and another alarms goes off.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
I've lost control of the ship!</speak>

<info>Bender panics.</info>

<info>Cut to: Omega 3 Surface. The ship hits the surface, flips over 
and lands upside down. The crew get out, Fry carrying Nimoy. 
Bender lights a cigar and Leela gasps.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Oh, dip!</speak>

<speak who="NIMOY">
Dip, indeed!</speak>

<info>They look around in amazement. There are Star Trek props and 
sets everywhere.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
It's all stuff from that forbidden show.</speak>

<speak who="NIMOY">
So many cardboard sets, so many memories. 
If only the others--</speak>

<speak who="SHATNER">
I guess that's my cue.</speak>

<info>He steps out of the "Guardian of Forever" prop with a body and 
wearing a yellow Star Trek uniform.</info>

<speak who="NIMOY">
Bill!</speak>

<speak who="SHATNER">
L-Dog!</speak>

<speak who="NIMOY">
<info>(laughing)</info> Hey! This is wonderful!</speak>

<speak who="SHATNER">
Oh, man.</speak>

<speak who="NIMOY">
I feel like hugging you.</speak>

<speak who="SHATNER">
Well I would except you have no body! 
And we're both men.</speak>

<info>Nichelle Nichols steps out, also with a body. She is followed 
by the other actors.</info>

<speak who="NIMOY">
Nichelle! George! Walter! DeForest! 
Welshy!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Welshy?</speak>

<speak who="NICHOLS">
We did some musical reunion specials 
in the 2200's but the guy who played 
Scotty had trouble yodelling.</speak>

<speak who="TAKEI">
Ever since then, Welshy has been a welcome 
participant in our escapades.</speak>

<info>Welshy says something in Welsh.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
I can't believe it! How'd you all end 
up here?</speak>

<speak who="SHATNER">
We were on our way to Welshy's cousin's 
house to stay in the guest room when 
our ship was pulled down to this planet 
and crashed, just like yours.</speak>

<speak who="KOENIG">
When we woke up, we had these bodies.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Say it in Russian!</speak>

<info>Koenig sighs.</info>

<speak who="KOENIG">
Ven ve voke up ve had these wodies.</speak>

<info>Fry squeals.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Now say "nuclear wessels"!</speak>

<speak who="KOENIG">
No!</speak>

<speak who="TAKEI">
You'll love it here. Everything is provided 
for us. And we never age. Check out 
these abs!</speak>

<info>He rips his shirt revealing his body.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Yowza!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
But who's doing all this for you?</speak>

<speak who="SHATNER">
You know, we never thought about it. 
We're famous celebrities -- we're used 
to this sort of treatment.</speak>

<info>A deep, booming voice interrupts them.</info>

<speak who="MELLLVAR">
It is I!</speak>

<info>Everyone gasps and looks up. Above them is a hovering, green 
cloud.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Whoa! What a cheesy effect!</speak>

<speak who="MELLLVAR">
I am not an effect! You doubt my power?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
I do.</speak>

<info>Melllvar zaps Welshy with a bolt of lightning and he falls over.</info>

<speak who="WELSHY">
<info>(shouting)</info> Aye!</speak>

<info>Fry runs to him and holds him.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
<info>(screaming)</info> Welshy!</speak>

<info>Flashback ends.</info>

<info>Ships Cargo Bay.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
This court will now hear some very sensual 
testimony from this court's ex-lover, 
Turanga Leela.</speak>

<info>Leela is already in the wheelchair.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Go  yourself.</speak>

<info>She beeps.</info>

<info>Flashback.</info>

<info>Fade to: Omega 3 Surface. The flashback continues from earlier.</info>

<speak who="MELLLVAR">
Behold another power, different from 
the one you saw earlier.</speak>

<info>Melllvar floats over Nimoy's jar and gives him a body and a 
blue uniform.</info>

<speak who="NIMOY">
Hey! A body! Buff, tan. Yeah, this is 
mine alright!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Alright, you gas, what's the deal?</speak>

<speak who="MELLLVAR">
Centuries ago, the videotaped adventures 
of the Enterprise crew rained down upon 
my planet. Over and over, I watched 
them. Especially the five with the energy 
beings. I am Melllvar! Seer of the tapes, 
knower of the episodes! Tremble before 
my encyclopaedic knowledge of Star Trek!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Tremble? I laugh. Nobody knows more 
about Star Trek than me!</speak>

<speak who="MELLLVAR">
I beg to differ.  Long have I waited 
for the one who played Spock. At last, 
we can begin.</speak>

<info>A banner reading "Welcome To Trekfest 3002" appears behind him, 
hanging from a prop.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Cool! A Star Trek convention!</speak>

<speak who="NIMOY">
Uh, Melllvar, can you give us some idea 
of how long this is going to last?</speak>

<speak who="MELLLVAR">
Until time stops.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
What?</speak>

<speak who="SHATNER">
He can't do this!</speak>

<speak who="NIMOY">
You can't be serious!</speak>

<speak who="MELLLVAR">
Now, we have a full schedule of events--</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Uh, can people who hate Star Trek leave?</speak>

<speak who="KOENIG">
Good question!</speak>

<speak who="MELLLVAR">
No, you have to stay even longer.</speak>

<info>Bender and Koenig groan.</info>

<info>Time Lapse. The actors sit at a long table for autographs. Nimoy 
snores. Melllvar gets Takei's autograph and Fry stands behind 
him, nervous.</info>

<speak who="MELLLVAR">
Um, uh, sign it to Melllvar. "Melllvar" 
has three "L's".</speak>

<speak who="TAKEI">
I think I've done enough conventions 
to know how to spell "Melllvar".</speak>

<info>Time Lapse. The cast and Melllvar are standing in front of a 
backdrop having their photo taken by Bender.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Say "nerd"!</speak>

<speak who="ALL">
Nerd!</speak>

<info>Time Lapse. Shatner is on a stage spoken-wording Eminem's The 
Real Slim Shady.</info>

<speak who="SHATNER">
<info>(spoken-word)</info> I'm Slim Shady,

Yes, I'm the real Shady,

All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating,

So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up,

Please stand up,

Please stand up.

</speak><speak who="KOENIG">
How can you do a spoken-word version 
of a rap song?</speak>

<speak who="MELLLVAR">
He found a way.</speak>

<info>Time Lapse. Fry and Melllvar are playing "Ambassador Sarek's 
Trivia Challenge" with Leela as questionmaster. Fry has 500 points 
and Melllvar has 300.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
For one hundred quatloos: Who did the 
captain maroon on Ceti Alpha V?</speak>

<info>Shatner leaps up.</info>

<speak who="SHATNER"><info>(SHOUTING)</info>
Khaaan!</speak>

<info>Fry buzzes.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Uh ... Khan?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Correct.</speak>

<info>Fry's score goes up to 600.</info>

<speak who="MELLLVAR">
My button has broken. The trivia contest 
has ended. I-I now have a surprise. 
You will perform a fan script, written 
by the ultimate Trek fan.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
You have my fan script?</speak>

<speak who="MELLLVAR">
I meant me! Melllvar is the ultimate 
fan!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
<info>(smug)</info> Oh, I was confused because the 
scoreboard says something different.</speak>

<info>Melllvar growls.</info>

<speak who="MELLLVAR">
Trivia contest over! Take your scripts! 
We have limited rehearsal time. Now, 
I didn't make enough copies of the script 
so George and Walter will have to share.</speak>

<info>Takei reluctantly shares.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Uh, you probably don't want us to see 
you rehearsing, or it'll give away the 
ending.</speak>

<speak who="MELLLVAR">
That's right! The ending must not be 
ruined.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
We'll go wait in the ship.</speak>

<speak who="MELLLVAR">
OK.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Not 'til I get my 600 quatloos!</speak>

<info>Leela and Bender grab Fry and pull him away.</info>

<info>Ships Cockpit. The ship flies away from the planet.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
This is wrong. We shouldn't have abandoned 
them there.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
I dunno, I'm feeling pretty good about 
it.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
I didn't wanna leave them either, Fry, 
but what are we supposed to do?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Well, usually on the show someone would 
come up with a complicated plan then 
explain it with a simple analogy.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Hmm. If we can re-route engine power 
through the primary weapons and reconfigure 
them to Melllvar's frequency, that should 
overload his electro-quantum structure.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Like putting too much air in a balloon!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Of course! It's so simple!</speak>

<info>The ship turns around and heads back to the planet.</info>

<info>Omega 3 Surface. The cast are on the set of the Enterprise bridge 
rehearsing with their scripts.</info>

<speak who="SHATNER">
<info>(reading)</info> Alas, my ship, whom I love 
like a woman, is .. .disabled.  Oh, 
Lord!</speak>

<speak who="NIMOY">
<info>(reading)</info> Fascinating, captain, and 
logical too. Yet we need some help.</speak>

<speak who="TAKEI">
<info>(reading)</info> Look, captain, Melllvar will 
help us.</speak>

<info>He turns around and points to the door. It eventually opens 
and Melllvar floats through.</info>

<speak who="KOENIG">
<info>(reading)</info> Keptin, I wope he will welp 
our ... vessel.</speak>

<speak who="MELLLVAR">
Wessel!  You're not acting hard enough!</speak>

<speak who="NIMOY">
Melllvar, you have to respect your actors. 
When I directed Star Trek IV I got a 
magnificent performance out of Bill 
because I respected him so much.</speak>

<speak who="SHATNER">
And when I directed Star Trek V I got 
a magnificent performance out of me, 
because I respected me so much!</speak>

<info>The other actors roll their eyes.</info>

<info>Ships Jeffries Tube. Bender welds something in the Planet Express 
ships equivalent to Scotty's tube.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
<info>(shouting)</info> OK! I'm done re-kafoobling 
the energy motron ... or, whatever.</speak>

<info>Cut to: Ships Cockpit.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Fire!</speak>

<info>She pauses then presses the "FIRE!" button on the control panel 
herself.</info>

<info>Orange phaser beams diverge from the ship.</info>

<info>Cut to: Omega 3 Surface. The fan script performance continues.</info>

<speak who="NICHOLS">
<info>(reading)</info> My, what a handsome energy 
creature you are. I love you.  Hey, 
you wrote it!</speak>

<info>Melllvar grows in size and the actors step backwards.</info>

<info>Cut to: Ships Cockpit. The ship shakes. Fry gets the obligatory 
console exploding in his face like in Star Trek. Smoke comes 
out of machinery and sparks fly.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Its not working! He's drawing straight 
from our weapons.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Like a balloon and ... something bad 
happens.</speak>

<info>Melllvar turns into a giant green hand � la Apollo in the Star 
Trek episode Who Mourns For Adonis?.</info>

<info>Cut to: Ships Cockpit. Fry and Leela scream.</info>

<info>Cut to: Outside Ship. The ship backs away. The hand grabs and 
pulls it back down to the planet.</info>

<info>Cut to: Omega 3 Surface. The ship crashes and the engine falls 
off. The crew crawl out from underneath.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Yup!</speak>

<info>Melllvar and the Star Trek actors are nearby.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
So, uh, how's rehearsal going?</speak>

<speak who="MELLLVAR">
Lousy. Here I've been admiring a bunch 
of actors while you, a crew of genuine 
space heroes, risked your lives to save 
them.</speak>

<speak who="NIMOY">
Hey! We've done heroic things too.</speak>

<speak who="NICHOLS">
Yeah! In the third season I kissed Shatner!</speak>

<speak who="MELLLVAR">
Silence! My whole world has turned upside-down. 
I have but one option.</speak>

<speak who="KOENIG">
Keep them and let us go?</speak>

<speak who="MELLLVAR">
No! To determine who is more worthy 
of my fanatical devotion I shall pit 
you together against each other in armed 
combat ... To the death!</speak>

<info>Everyone gasps.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Where'd you get an idiotic idea like 
that?</speak>

<speak who="MELLLVAR">
Episodes 19, 46, 56 and 77.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Great list. Except, you forgot episode 
66!</speak>

<info>He chuckles.</info>

<speak who="MELLLVAR">
I was getting to that one!</speak>

<info>He zaps Welshy's corpse and it explodes.</info>

<info>Flashback ends.</info>

<info>Ships Cargo Bay.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
So Melllvar ordered a battle to the 
death. I assume no one survived.</speak>

<info>Leela sighs.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Can we get on with this? My foot's getting 
tired!</speak>

<info>Flashback.</info>

<info>Fade to: Omega 3 Surface.</info>

<speak who="MELLLVAR">
This will be your standard battle to 
the death. The only weapons: Whatever 
you can find. But I warn you, do nothing 
until I have signalled the start of 
combat. OK, start.</speak>

<info>The Star Trek cast and Planet Express crew run off in different 
directions.</info>

<info>Time Lapse. The actors hide behind a covered wagon on a Western 
set. A tumbleweed blows by. Shatner rips his shirt.</info>

<speak who="KOENIG">
I don't have much experience at fighting-- 
Except with you guys.</speak>

<speak who="SHATNER">
I have an idea. Wasn't there an episode 
where I threw my shoe at the enemy?</speak>

<speak who="NIMOY">
You mean Doohan?</speak>

<info>They both laugh and high five.</info>

<speak who="SHATNER">
Whoever it was, I did it like this.</speak>

<info>He takes a boot off and throws it at Takei's face.</info>

<speak who="TAKEI">
Ow!</speak>

<info>Shatner hops.</info>

<speak who="SHATNER">
My foot's cold!</speak>

<info>By the "Guardian of Forever" prop, Leela drops a pile of sticks 
next to Fry.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
There, we can make these into spears.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
And we can tie these caterpillars together 
to make bow strings for bows and arrows.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
And we can use this machine gun to shoot 
them! Yee-haw!  That was fun!</speak>

<info>On a rock-face, the actors separate. Shatner, Nichols and Takei 
remain. Shatner holds a bamboo stick.</info>

<speak who="NICHOLS">
What if I distract them with my famous 
fan dance?</speak>

<speak who="SHATNER">
Oh, that's good, good, good, good. And 
then, George, you give them a karate 
chop!</speak>

<speak who="TAKEI">
I find that offensive. Just because 
I'm of Japanese ancestry you assume 
I know karate. Have I ever led you to 
believe I've studied karate?</speak>

<speak who="SHATNER">
Well, no, but you never talk about yourself.</speak>

<speak who="TAKEI">
<info>(sadly)</info> Maybe if you showed a little 
interest.</speak>

<info>Elsewhere, Fry tries out his bow and arrow.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Well, here goes nothing.</speak>

<info>He tries to fire the arrow but the bow breaks and the caterpillars 
crawl all over his face. He falls over. Nichols appears from 
behind some rocks and does the fan dance from Star Trek V.</info>

<speak who="NICHOLS">
<info>(sexfully)</info> Hello, boys!</speak>

<info>She dances. Bender zooms in.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Whoa!</speak>

<info>Takei sneaks up behind him and chops him on the shoulder.</info>

<speak who="TAKEI">
Hi-yah!</speak>

<info>Bender screams. On a cliff, Leela and Shatner edge their way 
around a rock, facing opposite directions. They bump into each 
other and turn around. Leela screams and Shatner gasps.</info>

<speak who="SHATNER">
There's no right way to hit a woman.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Then do it the wrong way.</speak>

<speak who="SHATNER">
Fine. Yah!</speak>

<info>He kicks her and knocks her down. She gets back up.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Is that all you've got? Hi-yah!</speak>

<info>She does a roundhouse on him and hits him in the eye. He groans 
and raises his fists, ready to hit her.</info>

<speak who="SHATNER">
See you in h--</speak>

<info>Leela hits him in the face. He hits back and she dodges his 
punch and kicks him in the chest. He flies back and hits the 
ground. She jumps on him and repeatedly hits him in the face. 
Fry fights DeForest Kelley while Bender takes on Nimoy, Koenig 
and Takei.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Come on, Walter!</speak>

<speak who="NIMOY">
Take that!</speak>

<info>He hits Bender with a stick. Fry pushes Kelley away and Nichols 
cartwheels onto him, yelling. She locks his head between her 
thighs and pulls his hair.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
It hurts!</speak>

<speak who="NIMOY">
Let's see if this actually works!  Hm. 
Ow! Ow! Ow!</speak>

<speak who="KOENIG">
My face!</speak>

<speak who="TAKEI">
Ow! My face too!</speak>

<info>Shatner and Leela are both down. Shatner gets up and offers 
her his hand.</info>

<speak who="SHATNER">
May I?  Oh!</speak>

<info>She picks up a rock and holds it over him.</info>

<speak who="MELLLVAR">
Excellent! Excellent!</speak>

<info>Shatner holds out his hand.</info>

<speak who="SHATNER">
Leela, please. This is exactly what 
Melllvar wants. We're just pawns in 
his diabolical game of checkers. Can't 
we resolve our differences some other 
way?</speak>

<info>A bigger pink energy cloud wearing ugly glasses appears next 
to Melllvar.</info>

<speak who="MELLLVAR">'S MOTHER
Melllvar! Dinner time!</speak>

<speak who="MELLLVAR">
Aw, but Mom, I'm playing with my collectables!</speak>

<speak who="MELLLVAR">'S MOTHER
Now!</speak>

<info>Melllvar groans and disappears.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
All this time we thought he was a powerful 
super-being, yet he was just a child.</speak>

<speak who="MELLLVARS">'S MOTHER
He's not a child, he's 34!</speak>

<info>She disappears.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Alright, Koenig, I've wanted to do this 
for years!</speak>

<info>He grabs him by his shirt and holds up his fist. Fry grabs his 
arm.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Bender, wait! This is our chance to 
escape, before Melllvar comes back. 
But we all need to work together.</speak>

<info>Time Lapse. They run onto the cliff and find Leela and Shatner 
making out. Shatner rubs Leela's back.</info>

<speak who="SHATNER">
I love you so much!</speak>

<info>Nimoy clears his throat.</info>

<speak who="NIMOY">
Hello?</speak>

<info>They both look up.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
We've decided to work together.</speak>

<speak who="NIMOY">
Uh, so did they.</speak>

<info>Shatner gets up and elbows Nimoy.</info>

<speak who="SHATNER">
Now, how do we escape?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
We can't use our ship; We have life 
support but the engines are wrecked.</speak>

<speak who="TAKEI">
Ironic Because our engines work but 
our life support systems don't.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Hey, if your engines work--</speak>

<speak who="TAKEI">
And your life support systems work--</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Stop! You're just goin' around in circles! 
<info>(to himself)</info> Think, Fry, think! Everyone's 
depending on you.</speak>

<info>Time Lapse: Takei and Leela finish welding warp nacelles onto 
the hull of the Planet Express ship.</info>

<info>Time Lapse. The ship takes off but stalls and falls.</info>

<info>Cut to: Ships Cockpit.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
We're too heavy. You guys need to lose 
some weight, fast!</speak>

<info>Cut to: Omega 3 Surface. The side door of the ship opens and 
the decapitated bodies of the Star Trek cast are thrown out.</info>

<info>Cut to: Ships Cockpit. The actors heads are in jars. Fry wheels 
in the video case.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Look, Leonard, we're light enough to 
keep the tapes! Isn't that great?</speak>

<speak who="NIMOY">
I'm living in a gefilte fish jar.</speak>

<info>The ship flies away from the planet.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
We did it!</speak>

<info>Everyone cheers.</info>

<info>Behind the ship, another ship de-cloaks. There is the sound 
of Melllvar laughing and the ship shoots at the Planet Express 
ship.</info>

<info>Cut to: Ships Cockpit.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Melllvar's got a spaceship!</speak>

<speak who="MELLLVAR">
Yes, in mint condition. And you made 
me take it out of the package!</speak>

<info>He shoots at them some more. The ship approaches a familiar 
ship.</info>

<info>Cut to: Ships Cockpit.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
The Nimbus! We're saved!</speak>

<info>A screen comes down from above Leela's head.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
You're under arrest. Prepare to be 
boarded.</speak>

<info>Flashback ends.</info>

<info>Ships Cargo Bay.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
So I boarded you, eh. What happened 
next?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
You started this stupid court martial. 
Now if you don't mind, we're still fighting 
Melllvar!</speak>

<info>Melllvar strafes the ship.</info>

<info>Cut to: Ships Cockpit. Everyone runs in.</info>

<info>Leela turns the ship around, back the way they came. Melllvar 
follows, shooting more.</info>

<info>Cut to: Ships Cockpit. Everyone falls over.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
One more hit and we're done for!</speak>

<speak who="TAKEI">
Let's take 'em out with us. Do you guys 
have a self-destruct code? Like "destruct 
sequence 1-A, 2-B, 3--"</speak>

<info>Bender's head explodes, leaving some wires, coils and his mouth 
poking out of his body.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Thanks a lot, Takei, now everybody knows!</speak>

<speak who="MELLLVAR">
If I can't have the original cast of 
Star Trek, no one will! Prepare to die!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Wait! If they mean that much to you, 
why do you wanna kill them?</speak>

<speak who="MELLLVAR">
Because I ... I ... I dunno what I'd 
do without them.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Melllvar, you can't let a TV show be 
your whole life. You can do anything 
you want. Look at Walter Koenig: After 
Star Trek, he became an actor.</speak>

<speak who="KOENIG">
Not just an actor, but a well-rounded 
person, with my own friends and credit 
cards and keys.</speak>

<speak who="MELLLVAR">
Well, I guess I could move out of my 
parents' basement ... maybe get a temp 
job.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Whoa, whoa! One step at a time.</speak>

<speak who="MELLLVAR">
I thank you, Fry. You know, you and 
I are of a kind. In a different reality 
I could have called you "friend".</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Episode 10, Balance Of Terror.</speak>

<speak who="MELLLVAR">
More like episode nine, loser! In your 
face! Victory is mine!</speak>

<info>He turns his ship around and flies away, laughing.</info>

<info>Cut to: Ships Cokpit. Everyone watches him return to the planet</info>

<speak who="SHATNER">
I wonder, my friends, was he really 
such an evil energy gas?</speak>

<speak who="NICHOLS">
He did give us eternal youth.</speak>

<speak who="KOENIG">
24-hour Laundromat.</speak>

<speak who="TAKEI">
A full assortment of rum, both spiced 
and regular.</speak>

<speak who="NIMOY">
Truly, it was a paradise.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
And all you had to put up with was one 
really annoying Star Trek fan.</speak>

<info>The heads catch on.</info>

<speak who="SHATNER">
Let's get the hell outta here!</speak>

<info>The ship flies away like at the end of every Star Trek episode.</info>

[Closing Credits. A pseudo-Star Trek theme plays over stills 
from the episode. An additional shot of Kif comes up, parodying 
the shot from the Star Trek episode The Corbomite Manoeuver.</xml>
