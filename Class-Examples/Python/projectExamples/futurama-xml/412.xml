                         Centuries ago, the videotaped adventures 
                         of the Enterprise crew rained down upon 
                         my planet. Over and over, I watched

                         I didn't wanna leave them either, Fry, 
                         but what are we supposed to do?

                         Well, usually on the show someone would 
                         come up with a complicated plan then 
                         explain it with a simple analogy.

                         Hmm. If we can re-route engine power 
                         through the primary weapons and reconfigure 
                         them to Melllvar's frequency, that should 
                         overload his electro-quantum structure.

                         Melllvar, you have to respect your actors. 
                         When I directed Star Trek IV I got a 
                         magnificent performance out of Bill 
                         because I respected him so much.

                         I find that offensive. Just because 
                         I'm of Japanese ancestry you assume 
                         I know karate. Have I ever led you to 
                         believe I've studied karate?

                         Melllvar, you can't let a TV show be 
                         your whole life. You can do anything 
                         you want. Look at Walter Koenig: After 
                         Star Trek, he became an actor.

                         Not just an actor, but a well-rounded

                         cards and keys.
