<info>Planet Express: Meeting Room. The crew are sat around the big 
table. Enter Farnsworth with a sheet of paper.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Good news everyone, the university is 
bringing me up on disciplinary charges! 
Wait, that's not good news at all.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Whatever you did Professor, I'm sure 
there's a reasonable explanation.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Yes but they won't listen. Everyone's 
always in favour of saving Hitler's 
brain but when you put it in the body 
of a great white shark <info>(sarcastic)</info> ooo, 
suddenly you've gone too far.</speak>

<info>The ship flies towards Mars and cruises over the Mars University 
sign.

[Cut to: Mars University Car Park. The ship lands in the car 
park.</info>

<info>Mars University: Hallowed Hall. Farnsworth stands before several 
Mars University staff members under a spotlight. He wears a top 
hat and they are dressed formally for the tribunal.</info>

<speak who="VERNON">
Professor Farnsworth, do you know why 
we've called you here today?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Listen to me you pompous frauds, if 
I'm going down, I'm taking you all with 
me. Dean Vernon, I know the truth. It 
was you driving your hover-car that 
night, not your horse. Dean Epsilon, 
I know all about your "Department Of 
Pool Boy Studies." And Dr Wernstrom...Werrrnstrom!</speak>

<speak who="VERNON">
Actually Professor, we merely called 
you here to say......surprise.</speak>

<info>The room is filled with formally dressed people. To one side 
a band is ready to play and Farnsworth is in the middle of the 
room. Behind them "Happy Birthday" is displayed on a huge screen.</info>

<speak who="MAN #1">
Surprise!</speak>

<speak who="MAN #2">
Happy birthday!</speak>

<info>Behind Farnsworth the Planet Express crew hold a banner reading 
"Happy Sesquicentennial Professor Farnsworth!"</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
Surprise!</speak>

<info>Farnsworth ignores them.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
And you Coach Smalley, or should I say 
"Coach hairpiece"?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
No Professor, it's a surprise party 
for your 150th birthday.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
<info>(muttering)</info> Hundred and...what? Oooh!</speak>

<info>Time Lapse. Bender takes the mic in the middle and the other 
staff have been replaced by Leela, Fry, Farnsworth and Zoidberg. 
A picture of Farnsworth adorns the big screen. Bender plugs a 
mic into himself.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Good evening I'm -  Whoa, sorry. I'm 
Bender and I'll be MC-ing this roast. 
Y'know, they say you can judge a man 
by the company he keeps, so here's the 
Professor's oldest friend: A grotesque, 
stinking lobster!</speak>

<info>Zoidberg takes his place and appears on the screen.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Good evening ladies and germs.  That 
wasn't a joke, I was talking to Dean 
Streptococcus.  Now I'm not saying Professor 
Farnsworth is old, but if you consider 
his age he's likely to die soon!  Hey 
Ringo, that was the joke. Oh, it's showtime 
at the Apollo all over again.</speak>

<info>He sits down. Bender gets back up.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Where would the Professor be without 
students who love and respect him? Right 
there!  But seriously, of all the former 
crew members of the Professor's delivery 
ship, our next speaker is by far the 
most alive. Captain Muskie?</speak>

<info>A man who is a dead ringer for the wheelchair-bound Captain 
Pike from the Star Trek two-parter The Menagerie takes the mic. 
His wheelchair beeps once like Pike's and the audience howls 
with laughter. Zoidberg turns to Dean Vernon.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
I wouldn't wanna follow that guy!</speak>

<info>Bender laughs.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
And now, a man who needs no introduction. 
<info>(whispering)</info> Fry, get up there!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Oh.  Thank you. Y'know, when I was first 
asked to make a film about my nephew, 
Professor Farnsworth, I thought "Why 
should I?" Then later Leela made the 
film. But if I had made the film, you 
could bet there would have been a lot 
more topless women on motorcycles!  
Roll film!</speak>

<info>He sits down, the lights dim and behind him the film counts 
down in AL1. The title Hubert Farnsworth: A Living Obituary appears 
on the screen and it changes to a view of New New York in the 
29th century.</info>

<info>A picture of acne-faced Farnsworth dressed in a Dungeon Master 
T-shirt appears. Fry points at the screen.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
<info>(whispering)</info> Dork alert!</speak>

<info>The picture changes to Farnsworth a few minutes before.</info>

<info>The picture freezes and is followed by the caption "Hubert J. 
Farnsworth. To Be Continued...?" The picture ends and everyone 
applauds. Farnsworth looks away from the screen with sadness.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
How 'bout a few words Professor?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Eh wha?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
I said "words."</speak>

<info>Farnsworth stands up and the audience applauds.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Uh, what a pleasure it is to see my 
lifetime of accomplishments summed up 
in a 3-minute film. My best years are 
behind me. So much left undone. So little 
time.</speak>

<info>He sits down and hangs his head. Bender applauds.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Funny funny stuff.</speak>

<info>Planet Express: Lounge. Farnsworth sits glumly on the couch 
with the rest of the crew surrounding him.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
My life is over.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
No it isn't. You have another 10 years 
left.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Leela! He could live another 100 years!</speak>

<info>He winks theatrically.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
No, he couldn't. When you turn 160, 
robots from the Sunset Squad take you 
to a mysterious planet and you never 
return.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Wow, a whole planet of old people. Where 
is it?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
<info>(spookily)</info> Nobody knows!</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
So many loves half-loved. So many inventions 
half-invented. That damn time machine 
alone set me back 15 years.</speak>

<info>He points to a cobweb covered contraption in the corner that 
looks like the time machine from H.G. Wells' Time Machine.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
If only it'd worked. You could go back 
and not waste your time on it.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
There's no one to carry on after I'm 
gone. No one to take care of my work 
and my research and my fabulous fortune. 
By God, that's it! I've got to name 
a successor.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
A successor?</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
A successor to the Professor?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
There's no time to lose. I'm off to 
my lab to build a successor-naming machine!</speak>

<info>Planet Express: Meeting Room. Everyone except Farnsworth is 
at the table.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Man, the Professor's been in his lab 
for days.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
I hope he didn't die. Unless he left 
a note naming me his successor. Then 
I hope he did die.</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
You? The successor? Over my empty shell! 
The Professor will pick me. Only I have 
his lobster-like tenacity!</speak>

<info>He clacks his claws.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
Up yours Zoidberg. Up wherever your 
species traditionally crams things. 
The only successful way to choose a 
successor is with a limbo contest.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
What?</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
Kingston rules. Two men go down, one 
come up.</speak>

<info>He gets up off his chair and limbos towards the kitchen.</info>

<info>Cut to: Planet Express: Kitchen. He limbos underneath the oven. 
Leela puts a bin in front of it and leans against it.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Look, the Professor trusts me with a 
giant spaceship. He wouldn't trust the 
rest of you with his dentures.</speak>

<info>Cut to: Planet Express: Meeting Room. Amy has Farnsworth dentures 
in her mouth.</info>

<speak who="AMY">
Yesh he would.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Sorry everyone but need I remind you? 
Blood is thicker than water.</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG"><info>WRITING</info>
Blood...thicker...water.</speak>

<info>Planet Express: Corridor. On the lab door is a sign reading 
"Mice Please Enter Through Maze." Farnsworth's monogrammed towel 
hangs on a rail to the side.</info>

<info>Cut to: Planet Express: Farnsworth's Lab. The crew are all assembled 
for the successor naming.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Everyone, I have a very dramatic announcement. 
So anyone with a weak heart should leave 
now. Goodbye.</speak>

<info>He turns to leave.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Uh, Professor?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Oh yes, the announcement! As you all 
know, I am not long for this world...</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Yes, we know.</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
True mon!</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
Buh!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
One foot in the grave.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
...So I've picked my successor. It's 
someone in whom I have great faith - 
even though his mind is undeveloped 
and he's accomplished nothing.  My closest 
living relative...</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Oh yeah!</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
My clone, Cubert Farnsworth.</speak>

<info>Fry gasps and Farnsworth throws a huge switch. Electrical gadgets 
fizzle and a huge glass tank slides up along the wall. The lights 
go on and the crew gaze at a chubby orange-haired boy suspended 
in water in the tank. They gasp.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
He's horrible!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Crud. Can I at least be in charge of 
your dentures?</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
You wish!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Where did Cubert come from?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
12 years ago I began the cloning process 
by removing some skin cells from one 
of the shaplier growths on my back.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Wait, if he's your clone then why doesn't 
his nose look like yours?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
I left him in his first tube too long 
and he got squished up against the side.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Is he dumb or just ugly?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Let's find out.</speak>

<info>He presses a button and the water drains out of the tank. Cubert 
coughs and splutters. The crew stare at him.</info>

<speak who="CUBERT">
What? You've never seen a genius's wiener 
before?</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
No.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Never.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Well, once in the park.</speak>

<info>Planet Express: Hangar. The hangar doors are open and Leela 
works on the ship in a hover-cradle. Fry and Bender roll pennies 
against the hangar wall. Fry grumbles. Zoidberg takes a ketchup 
sachet out of a box, opens it and sucks the ketchup out.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Mmm!</speak>

<info>Cubert walks into the hangar from the lab.</info>

<speak who="CUBERT">
As long as I'm going to be in charge 
here, let me examine my so called "crew," 
if it can so be called. First of all, 
Dr Zoidberg, do you even have a medical 
degree?</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
I lost it...in a volcano.</speak>

<speak who="CUBERT">
And why do we need a bending robot around 
here anyway? What possible use do we 
have for you?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Uh...me no speaka the English.</speak>

<speak who="CUBERT">
And why does our space pilot have only 
one eye? There's someone I'd like you 
to meet. His name is depth perception!</speak>

<info>He laughs.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Why you little -!</speak>

<info>She takes a swipe at him but misses.</info>

<speak who="CUBERT">
Wow, that hurt - the air!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Im pending para un bending!</speak>

<info>Farnsworth leans over the railings.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Oh Cubert, come in here. I have something 
amazing to show you.</speak>

<speak who="CUBERT">
What is it? A compitent employee? I 
doubt that very much!</speak>

<info>He laughs and leaves. The crew mutter and grumble.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Little twerp.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Aye chihuahua!</speak>

<info>Planet Express: Attic. Farnsworth and Cubert stand among Farnsworth's 
countless inventions.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
As my successor I'm trusting you to 
carry on my work. These are just some 
of the half finished inventions you'll 
spend your life finishing.</speak>

<info>Cubert looks at the smelloscope.</info>

<speak who="CUBERT">
I didn't realise you were the inventor 
of the junk heap.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
That's my prizewinning smelloscope. 
If a dog craps anywhere in the universe, 
you can bet I won't be out of the loop. 
And this is my universal translator. 
Unfortunately so far it only translates 
into an incomprehensible dead language.</speak>

<speak who="CUBERT">
Hello.</speak>

<speak who="UNIVERSAL TRANSLATOR">
Bonjour!</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Crazy gibberish!</speak>

<speak who="CUBERT">
Don't you have any worthwhile inventions?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Why certainly. Step over here.</speak>

<info>Outside Ship. The ship cruises away from Earth. Cubert and Farnsworth 
stand on the ship's hull near the engines.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
These are the dark matter engine I invented. 
They allow my starship to travel between 
galaxies in mere hours.</speak>

<speak who="CUBERT">
That's impossible. You can't go faster 
than the speed of light.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Of course not. That's why scientists 
increased the speed of light in 2208.</speak>

<speak who="CUBERT">
Also impossible.</speak>

<info>Ship's Engine Room. Farnsworth admires the dark matter engines.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
And what makes my engines truly remarkable 
is the afterburner which delivers 200% 
fuel efficiency.</speak>

<speak who="CUBERT">
That's especially impossible.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Not at all. It's very simple.</speak>

<speak who="CUBERT">
Then explain it.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Now that's impossible. It came to me 
in a dream and I forgot it in another 
dream.</speak>

<speak who="CUBERT">
Your explainations are pure weapons 
grade balognium. It's all impossible.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Nothing is impossible. Not if you can 
imagine it. That's what being is a scientist 
is all about.</speak>

<speak who="CUBERT">
No, that's what being a magical elf 
is all about.</speak>

<info>Elzar's Fine Cuisine. The crew and Cubert are in the middle 
of their meal. Bender looks around and sees Elzar talking to 
some other diners.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Oh my God, oh my God! It's Elzar, the 
TV chef! Oh kill me now people!</speak>

<info>Elzar joins them.</info>

<speak who="ELZAR">
How we doing here?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Oh Elzar, everything's so good!</speak>

<speak who="ELZAR">
What are you, an ass kissing machine?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Yes sir, good one sir!</speak>

<info>Elzar leaves.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Oh it's a gem of an evening! I feel 
so wonderful having someone to take 
over my life work! And it's all thanks 
to Cubert.</speak>

<speak who="CUBERT">
Look Professor. I may be identical to 
you in every possible way but that doesn't 
mean I'm anything like you.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
You...wha?</speak>

<speak who="CUBERT">
I don't want to be an inventor. I want 
to be something useful like a teacher's 
aide or a prison guard or a science 
fiction cartoon writer.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
But-But what about my hopes and my dreams 
and my wonderful inventions?</speak>

<speak who="CUBERT">
In your entire life your only half-decent 
invention was me and I didn't turn out 
like you wanted either.</speak>

<info>Farnsworth looks away from Cubert and a tear trickles down his 
face. The other look on sadly. Elzar appears in the doorway.</info>

<speak who="ELZAR">
You folks still doing alright?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Oh yes Elzar.</speak>

<speak who="ELZAR">
Good 'cause it turns out I forgot to 
cook that chicken.</speak>

<info>Planet Express: Attic. A storm rages outside the building. Farnsworth 
puts a tape in a camcorder and steps in front of it.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Bad news everyone. By the time you watch 
this tape, I'll be gone. Leaving by 
nothing but a history of failure and 
my original hipbones. You see, I've 
been lying about my age. I'm not actually 
150. I'm 160. Oh vanity, thy name is 
Professor Farnsworth. And now that I've 
nothing to live for, I've alerted the 
Sunset Squad robots to take me away.</speak>

<info>Cut to: Outside Planet Express. A Sunset Squad ship flies through 
a hole in the stormclouds and stops next to the attic balcony. 
The door opens and something climbs out, holding a scythe.</info>

<info>Cut to: Planet Express: Attic. Farnsworth takes the tape out 
of the camera and puts it in an envelope. There is a flash of 
lightning and the windows fly open. Farnsworth gasps, turns around 
and sees the cloaked Reaperbot. It beckons him. Farnsworth puts 
the envelope, labelled "To My Crew," on a table and starts to 
follow the Reaperbot outside.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Goodbye cruel world.  Goodbye cruel 
lamp.  Goodbye cruel velvet drapes, 
lined with what would appear to be some 
sort of cruel muslin......and the cute 
little pompom curtain pull cords, cruel 
though they may be a -</speak>

<info>The Reaperbot lifts him over his shoulder and knocks him out 
on the window.</info>

<info>Planet Express: Farnsworth's Lab. The remaining crew and Cubert 
watch Farnsworth's message on a hologram communicator similar 
to the one in A New Hope.</info>

<speak who="HOLOFARNSWORTH">
And now that I've nothing to live for, 
I've alerted the Sunset Squad robots 
to take me away.</speak>

<info>The crew gasp.</info>

<speak who="AMY">
What?</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
Oh no!</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Oh.</speak>

<speak who="HOLOFARNSWORTH">
I know you're all very upset, especially 
Bender.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
<info>(unmoved)</info> Well, life goes on. Except 
for you!</speak>

<info>He laughs.</info>

<speak who="HOLOFARNSWORTH">
I'm sure that Bender has just made a 
cutting remark but he doesn't know I 
taped over his soap operas to record 
this message.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
You bastard!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
We've gotta get him back.</speak>

<speak who="CUBERT">
Impossible. No one knows where they 
take those old geezers.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Nothing is impossible. You'd know that 
if you really took after the Professor, 
like I do.</speak>

<speak who="CUBERT">
You're his uncle dummy, he takes after 
you.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Uh...what?</speak>

<speak who="CUBERT">
Wait a second, that means I also take 
after you!</speak>

<info>He screams.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Quiet. I think I know how to find the 
Professor.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Lay it on us big boots.</speak>

<info>Outside Planet Express. The smelloscope points around the sky 
and Leela sniffs.</info>

<info>Cut to: Planet Express: Attic. The rest of the crew are with 
her.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
If the smelloscope can pick up the Professor's 
odour, we may have a chance to save 
him.</speak>

<info>Cubert scoffs and snorts.</info>

<speak who="CUBERT">
I think not. As you probably already 
don't know, odours are made up of particles 
that can't travel through the vacuum 
of space.</speak>

<info>Bender electrocutes him and he screams.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
I'm zeroing in on him.  Bengay...mothballs......letters 
to the editor. It's the Professor!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
To the flying machine!</speak>

<info>The smelloscope has been mounted to the laser turret and the 
ship flies at high speed through space.</info>

<info>Cut to: Ship's Cockpit. Fry operates the smelloscope like a 
periscope. He sniffs.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
To the left!  No to the up!  U-turn, 
U-turn!</speak>

<speak who="CUBERT">
We'll never find this place. Robots 
are very good at keeping secrets.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
No we're not you little bed wetter. 
Oops I'm sorry.</speak>

<info>Leela points through the windscreen.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
There it is! The Near-Death Star!</speak>

<info>Near-Death Star Landing Pad. The massive structure looks like 
the Death Star from A New Hope with huge spikes along the circumference. 
The ship circles a sizable dome and lands on a landing pad outside.</info>

<info>Cut to: Ship's Cockpit. Bender and Leela put on Reaperbot cloaks.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
OK, we'll tell them the Professor escaped 
and we're bringing him back. Fry, you'll 
have to dress up like a 160 year old 
man.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
I'm on it!</speak>

<info>He pulls his trousers up around his chest and starts acting 
frail and decreped.</info>

<speak who="CUBERT">
<info>(sarcastic)</info> My God, the illusion is 
so perfect I almost forgot I was looking 
at an idiot!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Now they may ask for a DNA sample.</speak>

<info>Fry pulls his trousers higher.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
I'd like to see them find it!</speak>

<speak who="CUBERT">
This is impossible, we don't even hae 
a sample of the Professor's DNA.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
I think I know where to get some.</speak>

<info>He pulls out a big syringe and points it at Cubert.</info>

<info>Cubert's screams echo around the Near-Death Star.</info>

<info>Outside Near-Death Star Guest Drop Off. Bender, Fry and Leela 
walk towards the opening door and past a sign reading "After 
11pm Use Slot." Fry is wearing a lab coat, thick glasses and 
is bending over. The is a big hump in his back.</info>

<info>Cut to: Near-Death Star Drop Off. The trio walk in through the 
door. Cubert starts talking from under the lab coat.</info>

<speak who="CUBERT">
Why do I have to be the hump?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
'Cause you're too ugly to be a wart.</speak>

<info>He laughs, followed by Bender and Leela. They carry on walking 
across a large bridge towards the centre of the dome. They hear 
whirring noises and look over the side. Machines scoop up old 
people, strip them, bath them, dress them in night gowns and 
finally place them in rocking chairs. The chairs move along a 
conveyor belt towards a large tube in the middle of the dome. 
There are conveyor belts going deep into the dome.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Your medicare dollars at work.</speak>

<info>They reach some barrierbots and guardbots. A barrierbot lowers 
a barrier in front of them.</info>

<speak who="BARRIERBOT #1">
Halt! Identify this guest.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Uh, this is Professor Hubert Farnsworth. 
He escaped.</speak>

<speak who="BARRIERBOT #1">
Escaped? No one escapes.</speak>

<speak who="BARRIERBOT #2">
This guest does not look 160.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
What? I'm old. Listen. <info>(old man voice)</info> 
Hey you kids, get off the lawn!</speak>

<speak who="BARRIERBOT #1">
Hmm, it is true that old people are 
often concerned that there are children 
on their lawns.</speak>

<speak who="BARRIERBOT #2">
There's no denying that. But we'll still 
need to verify his identidity with a 
DNA sample.</speak>

<info>Bender holds up a jar labelled "Tissue Sample." The jar is filled 
with Cubert's blood.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Got a hot steaming batch right here!</speak>

<info>He puts it near Barrierbot #2.</info>

<speak who="BARRIERBOT #2">
We only need one cell!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Eh, keep the change buddy.</speak>

<speak who="CUBERT">
Stupid robot.</speak>

<info>A guardbot turns around with its gun.</info>

<speak who="BARRIERBOT #1">
Did you hump just say something?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Uh....I-I've got talking hump syndrome.</speak>

<speak who="BARRIERBOT #1">
Ah, THS.</speak>

<info>Bender drops some of Cubert's blood into a machine and it dings 
and displays "Hubert J. Farnsworth."</info>

<speak who="BARRIERBOT #2">
Identity confirmed. Return this shambling 
shuffleboarder to his room.</speak>

<info>Barrierbot #1 raises his barrier.</info>

<speak who="BARRIERBOT #1">
7152 Maple Drive.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Sounds nice.</speak>

<speak who="BARRIERBOT #1">
Prepare to be surprised.</speak>

<info>Near-Death Star: Maple Drive. Maple Drive is filled with tens 
of thousands of immense grave-like structures, each containing 
thousands of small drawers, exactly like the rest of the Near-Death 
Star. Fry takes his glasses off and he Bender and Leela look 
around in awe.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
So this is where they stick old people. 
It's horrific.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
At least it keeps them from driving.</speak>

<info>Time Lapse. They climb into a hover vehicle and Leela flies 
it up the side of a gravestone. She reverses it past drawer number 
7150, Ava Porter b.2790 d.Soon; past number 7151, Eloise Porter 
b.2856 d.Soon and finally stops it next to drawer number 7152, 
Hubert J. Farnsworth b.2841 d.Soon. She puts her hands on the 
handle and turns to the others.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Brace yourself for the worst.</speak>

<info>She pulls the drawer out. Farnsworth is lying in it with at 
least 24 tubes connected to him in various places. They all scream.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
And yet he looks so natural.</speak>

<speak who="CUBERT">
What's happening?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
He's hooked up to a life-support system. 
We have to disconnect him very very 
carefully, or the shock could kill him.</speak>

<info>A guardbot appears behind them in a flying machine.</info>

<speak who="GUARDBOT #1">
Freeze!  Seize them!</speak>

<speak who="GUARDBOT #2">
Seize them!</speak>

<speak who="GUARDBOT #3">
Seize them!</speak>

<speak who="GUARDBOT #4">
Seize them!</speak>

<speak who="GUARDBOT #1">
Get them - I mean seize them!</speak>

<info>They round another corner and a guardbot hits a gravestone.</info>

<speak who="GUARDBOT #2">
Aww I'm so bad at this!</speak>

<info>His hover-ship explodes. Leela looks behind at the other guardbots 
and steers the ship past some huge machines loading old people 
into their final resting places. She ducks and dives over and 
under them and another guardbot meets his doom.</info>

<speak who="GUARDBOT #3">
Uh-oh!</speak>

<info>His ship hits a machine and explodes. Leela turns the ship upwards.</info>

<info>Cut to: Near-Death Star Guest Drop Off. She smashes the ship 
through barrierbot #1 and he screams and feebly lifts what remains 
of it up and down. Leela, Bender, Fry and hump's hover-ship speeds 
towards the door. It starts to close.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
We're probably going to make it, but 
we might not.</speak>

<info>Cubert looks out the top of the lab coat.</info>

<speak who="CUBERT">
It's impossible, we'll never fit.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Will too.</speak>

<info>He and Bender duck and Cubert smashes his head on the closing 
door, screams and flies back.</info>

<info>Cut to: Outside Near-Death Star Guest Drop Off. Cubert is lying 
on the Professor, dazed.</info>

<speak who="CUBERT">
Told you.</speak>

<info>He blacks out. The hover-ship flies towards the landing pad.</info>

<info>Ship's Cockpit. Leela runs into the cockpit followed by Bender 
carying Farnsworth, followed by Fry dragging Cubert. He drops 
Cubert and his heads hits the floor with a thunk.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Come on Leela, step your big boot down 
on the gas pedal.</speak>

<info>And she does.</info>

<info>Cut to: Near-Death Star Landing Pad. The ship takes off and 
the landing gear goes up. The guest drop off door opens and three 
guardbots fly out. Guardbot #1 opens fire on the ship and two 
laser pulses hit the ship's engine, causing it to shut down. 
The ship falls onto the landing pad and the guardbots start buzzing 
around it.</info>

<info>Cut to: Ship's Cockpit. An alarm beeps and a red light flashes.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
They've blown out one of our engines!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Fix it fix it fix it fix it fix it fix 
it! Fix it fix it fix it!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Only the Professor knows how to fix 
it. We have to wake him up.</speak>

<info>She grabs Farnsworth's night shirt and shakes him around. Fry 
blasts him with an airhorn and Bender empties a chest cabinet-ful 
of water over him.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Try shocking him.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
<info>(shouting)</info> Your social security cheque 
is late! Stuff costs more than it used 
to. Young people use curse words!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Damnit, we'll have to fix the engine 
ourself.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
We can't you bastard, no one knows how 
it works. It's impossible.</speak>

<info>Cubert comes around and puts his hand in the air.</info>

<speak who="CUBERT">
Nothing is impossible. I understand 
how the engines work now. It came to 
me in a dream.  The engines don't move 
the ship at all. The ship stays where 
it is and the engines move the universe 
around it.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
That's a complete load.</speak>

<speak who="CUBERT">
Nothing's a complete load. Not if you 
can imagine it. That's what being a 
scientist is all about. Right Professor?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Eh...whuh...</speak>

<info>Cubert closes the access panel.</info>

<speak who="CUBERT">
Let's ride!</speak>

<info>Cut to: Near-Death Star Landing Pad. The ship's engines power 
up and they begin to move the universe in a flow-mo sequence 
lifted from The Matrix. The ship flies away, it's exhaust blasting 
the guardbots away. Near-Death Star defenses fire on the ship 
and repeatedly miss as it makes its getaway.</info>

<info>Planet Express: Meeting Room. Cubert and Farnsworth walk in 
from the lounge.</info>

<speak who="CUBERT">
Good news everyone, he's made a complete 
recovery.</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
Yeah!</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
Wow!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
All right!</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
I'm as spry as a 140 year old.  See? 
I only broke one ankle.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
So what were they doing to you in that 
awful drawer?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Oh, they had me hooked up to a bizarre 
virtual world that seemed absolutely 
real.</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
What was it like?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
It was as though I was living in a facility 
in Florida with hundreds of other old 
people. All day long we'd play bingo, 
eat oatmeal and wait for our children 
to call.</speak>

<info>Everyone gasps in horror.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
It's a hundred times more horrible than 
anything I could imagine.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Oh my yes. Thank you all for saving 
me. Especially you my little clone. 
No matter what you decide to do with 
your life, I'm still proud of you.</speak>

<info>Cubert hugs Farnsworth.</info>

<speak who="CUBERT">
I've already decided. Dad, when I grow 
up I wanna be just like you.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Don't worry son. You will. Incidentally, 
you might want to read up on a condition 
known as "wandering bladder."</speak>

<speak who="CUBERT">
Why?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
No reason. No reason at all.</speak>
