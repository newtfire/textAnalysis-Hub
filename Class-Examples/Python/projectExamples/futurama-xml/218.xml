                         I hate the Planet of the Moochers. They 
                         take you out for a drink, but when the 
                         check comes, their wallet's always in 
                         their other pants - which they borrowed 
                         from me!

                         Popplers can't talk. Leela must be hallucinating 
                         from not eating enough Popplers. Here, 
                         eat some now.

                         Look, Leela, even if you heard one talk, 
                         that doesn't mean it's intelligent. 
                         I mean, parrots talk and we eat them, 
                         right?

                         Yeah. Maybe it just learned to talk

                         Hear me out. There are many good reasons 
                         to eat. Hunger, boredom, wanting to 
                         be the world's fattest man. But not 
                         revenge. Are we no better than they? 
                         Besides, Leela's my friend.
