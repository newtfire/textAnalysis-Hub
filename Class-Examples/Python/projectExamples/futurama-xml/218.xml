<info>Ship's Cockpit. The Planet Express ship flies away from a dark 
brown world surrounded by green clouds. Fry and Leela talk.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
I hate the Planet of the Moochers. They 
take you out for a drink, but when the 
check comes, their wallet's always in 
their other pants - which they borrowed 
from me!</speak>

<info>He is indeed only wearing his underwear on his lower half. Bender 
climbs up the ladder from the galley wearing his chef's hat and 
an apron which says "Heil To The Chef".</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Dinner ready?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Nah, those lousy Moochers cleaned out 
our pantry. All they left was baking 
soda and capers. And here it is!</speak>

<info>He holds up a plate piled high with the stuff.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Ugh!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Ugh! Great. We're two days from Earth 
with no food.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Problem solved: You two fight to the 
death and I'll cook the loser. (whispering 
to Leela) Work his gut; I like it tender.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Maybe that planet over there has a 
drive-thru. A Burger Jerk or a Fishy 
Joe's or a Chizzler or something.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Ah, don't get your hopes up. We're a 
billion miles from nowhere.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Yeah. It's probably only got a Howard 
Johnson's.</speak>

<info>Planet Surface. The ship flies over the planet's lush forests 
which are covered by an orange-brown haze. It lands in a clearing.</info>

<info>Time Lapse. Leela scans the area. Fry walks off into the woods.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Well, it's a type-M planet, so it should 
at least have Roddenberries.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
I'm experienced at foraging. I used 
to find edible mushrooms on my bath 
mat.</speak>

<info>Bender arrives with a sack over his shoulder.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
I found some rocks. You guys eat rocks, 
right?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
No.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
<info>(tempting)</info> Not even if they're sautï¿½ed 
in a little mud?</speak>

<info>He bounces a bucket of mud up and down. Fry pushes some leaves 
apart.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Here's something. It looks like a ditch 
full of fried shrimp.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
What are you, blind? It looks more like 
a hole full of fried prawns.</speak>

<info>Leela picks it up and scans it with her armband. It makes a 
noise like a truck.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Hm. This thing I wear on my wrist says 
they're not poisonous.</speak>

<info>She puts it in her mouth and starts chewing.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Well? How are they?  Oh, they're great! 
They're like sex! Except I'm having 
them!</speak>

<info>Bender sniffs one.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
You know what these would go great with? 
Rocks.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Look! Here's more!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
The planet's covered with 'em.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Let's bring back a couple of pocketfuls.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
No, a whole Bender-ful!</speak>

<info>He opens his chest door and starts filling his cabinet.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
No. Only what we need. Stuff the ship.</speak>

<info>Outside Planet Express. The ships comes in ready to land. There 
is a crate strapped to the roof. The hangar roof opens.</info>

<info>Cut to: Planet Express: Hangar. Hermes stands at a control panel 
wearing earphones and a mic.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
Planet Express ship, you are cleared 
to land.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Roger!</speak>

<info>The ship lands.</info>

<info>Planet Express: Lounge. The whole crew are gathered around the 
table eating the things.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
Oh, man, I'm inhaling these things! 
You guys scored some primo stuff here.</speak>

<info>Zoidberg eats some.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
They're tastier than an unguarded penguin 
nest. What do you call them?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
We haven't thought of a name yet.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
They're tasty, right? Let's call 'em 
"Tasty-cles".</speak>

<info>Hermes gasps.</info>

<speak who="AMY">
Ew!</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
No!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
We can't call them that.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Why not?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
It sounds too much like those frozen 
rocky mountain oysters on a stick. You 
know, Test-cicles?</speak>

<info>Hermes types something on a computer.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
According to government records, the 
only names not yet trademarked are "Popplers" 
and "Zittzers".</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
I know, we'll call them Popplers!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Good idea.</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Oh, yeah, why not?</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
You sure picked it.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Swish!</speak>

<info>Zoidberg crams some more into his mouth.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Call them what you want. I call them 
a free meal.</speak>

<info>Bender grabs his claw.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Whoa, whoa, slow down there, Sigmund. 
I can't stand idly by while poor people 
get free food. We gotta sell these things!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Hey, yeah.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Good idea.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Bender's a genius.</speak>

<info>New New York City Street. Fry and Bender have set up a hover-cart 
selling fresh Popplers. They sell a bag to a guy and Fry holds 
some cash.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Hey, business is great.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Ah, great is OK, but amazing would be 
great.</speak>

<info>They look across the street and see a queue forming at a hot 
dog stand.</info>

<speak who="VENDOR">
Please, don't push, there's hot dogs 
for everyone.</speak>

<info>Bender grumbles and crosses the road. The vendor hands a man 
a hot dog.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Hey, Mac, where do you want those rat 
droppings you ordered?</speak>

<info>The man throws his hot dog down and the people in the queue 
cross the road to the popplers stand.</info>

<speak who="WOMAN">
That's disgusting.</speak>

<speak who="VENDOR">
Wait a minute. You're not the guy who 
delivers the rat droppings.</speak>

<info>Bender chuckles and walks back across the road. A short man 
with stubble is talking to Fry.</info>

<speak who="MAN">
What are you selling? Popplers? Never 
heard of 'em.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Eat it or beat it.</speak>

<info>Fry hands the man a bag and he eats some.</info>

<speak who="MAN">
Mmm, these are great. Boys, this is 
your lucky day. I'm Joe Gillman.</speak>

<info>He points at a Fishy Joe's sign where he is dressed as a pirate 
and eating a sandwich with an entire fish in it.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Wow! You're some guy who eats at Fishy 
Joe's?</speak>

<speak who="GILLMAN">
Hell, no. I am Fishy Joe! I've got a 
fast-food franchise on every planet 
in the known universe. Uh, except McPluto.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Hey, Fishy. I've been meaning to write 
you about your in-store kiddie parks. 
The slides won't support an adult robot.</speak>

<speak who="GILLMAN">
Good point, not interested. But these 
Popplers, these are great. How much 
you sell 'em for?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
A dollar a dozen.</speak>

<speak who="GILLMAN">
You'll never make money that way. You 
supply 'em to me and I'll sell 'em for 
two bucks a dozen at my restaurants. 
I'll even pay you a dollar a dozen.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Yes! I'm gonna be rich.  You too but 
it's hard to get excited about that.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
How do we sign?</speak>

<info>Montage Scene. The Popplers popularity starts to grow. An Over 
X Popplers Served sign is placed outside Fishy Joe's. It turns 
to one. Fry and Bender record an advertising jingle.</info>

<speak who="FRY AND BENDER">
<info>(singing)</info> Pop a Poppler in your mouth

When you come to Fishy Joe's

What they're made of is a mystery

Where they come from no-one knows

You can pick 'em

You can lick 'em

You can chew 'em

You can stick 'em

If you promise not to sue us

You can shove one up your nose.

</speak><info>In space, Bender paints "Poppler" on the ships tail and scrubs 
out "Planet", making it Poppler Express. The ship speeds through 
space carrying a crate of live Popplers. The sign turns over 
to over one million sold. People buy Popplers from tube-thru 
window. Zoidberg arrives and turns his pockets inside out.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
I can't pay.</speak>

<info>Behind him, people shake their fists at him.</info>

<speak who="WOMAN">
Move it, man. Come on!</speak>

<info>The ship flies out into space and comes back to Earth with a 
U-Yank trailer. It flies over the city and crashes into a billboard 
which says "Fishy Joe's. Over 3.8 x 10^10 Popplers Served".</info>

<info>Cut to: Ship's Cockpit.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Leela! That's the second billboard you've 
crashed into this week!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Sorry. I was distracted by those protesters 
outside our building.</speak>

<info>Outside Planet Express. The ship and U-Yank trailer land inside 
while a crowd of hippies congregate outside with placards saying 
"Stopp Before You Popp", "Eating Is Murder" and "Popplers Are 
Peoplers Too!"</info>

<speak who="HIPPIE #1">
Disgusting!</speak>

<speak who="HIPPIE #2">
You should be ashamed!</speak>

<info>Farnsworth leans out of the lounge window.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
<info>(shouting)</info> Hey! Unless this is a nude 
love-in, get the hell off my property!</speak>

<info>The leader, a guy called Free Waterfall Jr., laughs.</info>

<speak who="WATERFALL JR">.
You can't own property, man!</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
I can, but that's because I'm not a 
penniless hippie.</speak>

<info>Leela, Fry and Bender arrive at the window.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
<info>(shouting)</info> What do you people want?</speak>

<speak who="WATERFALL JR">.
<info>(shouting)</info> We're with Mankind for Ethical 
Animal Treatment.  Popplers are living 
creatures. You gotta stop harvesting 
them for food!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
<info>(shouting)</info> Or what?</speak>

<speak who="WATERFALL JR">.
<info>(shouting)</info> Or we'll boycott Fishy Joe's.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
You're vegetarians, who cares what you 
do?</speak>

<speak who="WATERFALL JR">.
Shut up.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Animals eat other animals. It's nature.</speak>

<speak who="WATERFALL JR">.
No, it isn't. We taught a lion to eat 
tofu.  The point is, you shouldn't eat 
things that feel pain.</speak>

<info>Bender throws a brick at him and he clutches his head.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
<info>(shouting)</info> OK, we won't eat you.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
I'll go get some more bricks.</speak>

<info>Cut to: Planet Express: Lounge. Leela walks over to the table 
and picks up some Fishy Joe's buckets.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Fry, I wish you'd throw out these week-old 
Popplers. They're getting big and scaly. 
Ooh, there's one left.</speak>

<info>She picks it up. It uncurls itself. It has eyes and a mouth.</info>

<speak who="POPPLER">
Mama!</speak>

<info>Leela gasps and lets go of it. It lands in some honey mustard 
sauce, laughs, and swims around in it. She clasps her hands to 
her mouth and licks her fingers.</info>

<info>Time Lapse. Leela runs into the lounge later where the rest 
of the crew are eating Popplers.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Stop! Stop eating Popplers!</speak>

<info>She throws Fry's, Zoidberg's and Farnsworth's buckets off the 
table and smacks them out of Hermes' and Amy's hands.</info>

<speak who="AMY">
Why?</speak>

<info>Leela smashes Bender's beer.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
My booze!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Popplers are intelligent. This one called 
me mama.</speak>

<info>She has the Poppler wrapped in a Tender 'n' Juicy napkin.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Congratulations. I assume Amy is the 
father.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Popplers can't talk. Leela must be hallucinating 
from not eating enough Popplers. Here, 
eat some now.</speak>

<info>He picks up a bucket. Leela turns away.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
No!</speak>

<info>Bender squeezes her mouth open and tips some Popplers into her 
mouth.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
I said "eat"! Come on, mange!</speak>

<info>Leela throws the bucket into a bin, gasps and runs over to it.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Sorry, babies.</speak>

<info>She puts it on the table.</info>

<speak who="AMY">
Leela, maybe you should lie down.</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Yes, listen to the father.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
I'm telling you, it spoke to me. Come 
on, little Poppler, say "mama".</speak>

<info>She tickles it. Fry tuts and leans back in his chair.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Look, Leela, even if you heard one talk, 
that doesn't mean it's intelligent. 
I mean, parrots talk and we eat them, 
right?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Yeah. Maybe it just learned to talk 
as a parlour trick. Like Fry.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Like Fry! Like Fry!</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
There's one way, and only one way, to 
determine if an animal is intelligent. 
Dissect its brain!</speak>

<info>The Poppler reaches out to Leela.</info>

<speak who="POPPLER">
No, mama. Stop grandpa!</speak>

<info>Everyone but Farnsworth, who is sharpening a knife, gasps.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Enough chit-chat. Restrain the specimen!</speak>

<info>Fishy Joe's. Diners fill up on Popplers.</info>

<speak who="MAN">
Mmm, good.</speak>

<speak who="WOMAN">
Give me some of that special sauce.</speak>

<info>A Horrible Gelatinous Blob eats some Popplers and the fat guy 
from the Titanic reaches inside him and takes a Poppler. The 
Horrible Gelatinous Blob growls, grabs the man and eats him.</info>

<info>Cut to: Outside Fishy Joe's. Leela wears a "Free The Popplers!" 
sign.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
<info>(shouting)</info> Stop eating Popplers! They 
can talk!</speak>

<info>A man dressed as a Poppler and holding a tray of free samples 
walks up behind her.</info>

<speak who="MAN">
<info>(shouting)</info> Don't stop to talk! Eat Popplers!</speak>

<info>A man takes a Poppler and eats it.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Hey, cut it out!</speak>

<speak who="MAN">
<info>(shouting)</info> Take a coupon, cut it out! 
Ow! Ow!</speak>

<info>He falls over and some dogs eat the Popplers on the floor.</info>

<info>Time Lapse. Fry handcuffs himself to the Fishy Joe's door.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
People, I won't let you enter. Popplers 
are as intelligent as you or me.</speak>

<info>A smartly-dressed man pushes him aside.</info>

<speak who="SMARTLY DRESSED MAN">
You maybe!</speak>

<info>The door Fry cuffed himself to is a revolving door. The door 
drags him around and around.</info>

<info>Time Lapse. Bender rings his head like a town crier's bell.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Hear me, hear me! Stop eating Popplers! 
Stop eating them with honey mustard 
sauce......stop eating them with tangy 
sweet and sour sauce. Stop eating the 
new fiesta Poppler salad. Stop taking 
advantage of the money-saving 12-pack. 
Stop enjoying Popplers on the patio, 
in the car, or on the boat. Wherever 
good times are had!  Ow!</speak>

<info>The bomb opens a little flag that says "Please Don't Eat Popplers" 
comes out.</info>

<info>Planet Express: Lounge. Everyone except Leela sits around the 
TV to watch Datenight, presented by Linda.</info>

<speak who="LINDA">
Tonight on Datenight: Popplers. Eating 
them. Is it alright to? We have with 
us the CEO of Fishy Joe's, Mr. "Fishy" 
Joseph Gillman......Noted anti-eating 
activist, Free Waterfall Jr......And 
the discoverer of Popplers, Captain 
Turanga Leela.</speak>

<info>Leela appears on the screen.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Turanga?</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
That's her name, Philip.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Philip?</speak>

<speak who="LINDA">
Fishy Joe, is it wrong to eat intelligent 
animals?</speak>

<speak who="GILLMAN">
Absolutely not, Linda. I don't think 
anyone's here to make that claim.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
I am.</speak>

<speak who="WATERFALL JR">.
Me too.</speak>

<speak who="GILLMAN">
Listen...</speak>

<speak who="WATERFALL JR">.
Shut up...</speak>

<speak who="GILLMAN">
...we're talking about a snack...</speak>

<speak who="WATERFALL JR">.
...shut up...</speak>

<speak who="GILLMAN">
...that's low in fat...</speak>

<speak who="WATERFALL JR">.
...shut up.</speak>

<speak who="GILLMAN">
...and high in profit.</speak>

<speak who="WATERFALL JR">.
You're crazy, man. He is crazy.</speak>

<speak who="GILLMAN">
There's not even any strong evidence 
that these Popplers are intelligent.</speak>

<speak who="WATERFALL JR">.
Shut up shut up shut up shut up shut 
up...</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
That's not true. I have one right here 
that can talk.</speak>

<speak who="WATERFALL JR">.
...shut up...</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Come on, say "mama".</speak>

<speak who="POPPLER">
Ca-ca!</speak>

<speak who="LINDA">
OK, we'll have to bleep that.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Look, I'm saying eating meat is wrong...</speak>

<speak who="WATERFALL JR">.
Shut up.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
I don't think anyone's here to make 
that claim.</speak>

<speak who="WATERFALL JR">.
I am.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
But eating an intelligent animal is 
different.</speak>

<speak who="WATERFALL JR">.
Shut up shut up shut up shut up shut 
up...</speak>

<speak who="GILLMAN">
Oh, don't force your tired philosophy 
on us. I mean, the only reason we don't 
eat people is because it tastes lousy.</speak>

<speak who="WATERFALL JR">.
You're all nuts. Shut up, let me talk.</speak>

<speak who="LINDA">
You shut up, please.</speak>

<speak who="WATERFALL JR">.
No, you shut up, please.</speak>

<speak who="GILLMAN">
Popplers are no smarter than any other 
animal I've served. And that includes 
cats.</speak>

<info>Another rectangle forces itself in behind Linda. The Poppler 
is in it.</info>

<speak who="POPPLER">
Ca-ca head. Mean, old ca-ca head.</speak>

<speak who="GILLMAN">
Sir, I'm making a point. If these gutter-mouthed 
creatures are so smart, why don't they 
defend themselves, eh?</speak>

<info>He grabs a bucket of Popplers and starts eating.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Stop it!</speak>

<speak who="WATERFALL JR">.
I call murder on that.</speak>

<speak who="GILLMAN">
Look, I'm willing to grant that it's 
murder. The real issue is: Who's gonna 
stop me?</speak>

<info>He laughs. There is a crash and the studio starts shaking.</info>

<info>Cut to: New New York City Street. Shadows creep over buildings 
and nine Omicronian saucers descend from the sky.</info>

<info>Cut to: Planet Express: Lounge.</info>

<speak who="LINDA">
We seem to be experiencing technical 
difficulties.  And, crap like I've never 
seen!</speak>

<info>The screen cuts to static and then to Lrrr, standing behind 
his old-fashioned microphone.</info>

<speak who="LRRR">
People of Earth, I am Lrrr of the planet 
Omicron Persei 8.  Turn down that TV, 
Nd-Nd.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Dear Lord, they're back!</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
We're doomed!</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
Dooomed!</speak>

<info>Bender takes a breath.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Doooo...!</speak>

<speak who="LRRR">
Now then, the creatures you call "Popplers" 
come from a nursery planet in our sector</speak>

<info>Nd-Nd grabs the mic.</info>

<speak who="ND-ND">
You monsters have been eating our babies!</speak>

<info>Cut to: Datenight Studio. Leela, Waterfall and Gillman watch 
the Omicronians on a TV.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Eck!</speak>

<info>Gillman spits out half a Poppler and puts the mush on the other 
half he is holding.</info>

<speak who="ND-ND">
We demand justice. As you ate our children, 
so shall you be eaten by us!</speak>

<speak who="LRRR">
We will begin with the firemen, then 
the math teachers, and so on in that 
fashion until everyone is eaten.  Transmission 
over!  Well, that went OK. I tell you, 
when you know you can't scratch, that's 
when you really have to, huh?  Oh, yeah, 
oh, that feels a lot better. What? It's 
still on?</speak>

<info>He growls and the TV cuts to static.</info>

<info>DOOP Headquaters: Secret Conference Room. Outside, a sign has 
been change from "Democratic Order Of Planets United Against 
The Omicronian Menace" to "Democratic Order Of Planets Welcomes 
The Omicronian Menace". In the small room, Zapp Brannigan sits 
across a table from Lrrr and Nd-Nd. Omicronians and Kif stand 
behind them.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
As chief negotiator, I speak for all 
of Earth when I mourn the regrettable 
loss of the Omicronian young. We share 
your pain.  Mmm.  If we could undo the 
damage... These would be great with 
quack-a-mole.</speak>

<speak who="LRRR">
<info>(shouting)</info> Stop eating our young! And 
it's pronounced guacamole!</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Alright, I'm putting them away.  Now, 
uh, what is it you want?</speak>

<speak who="LRRR">
We demand -  We demand to eat one human 
for each Omicronian that was eaten.</speak>

<info>Zapp cleans his teeth with a toothpick.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Fair enough. How many is that?</speak>

<info>Kif taps him on the shoulder.</info>

<speak who="KIF">
198 billion, sir.</speak>

<speak who="LRRR">
Very well. You will provide us with 
198 billion humans. And, uh, small fries.</speak>

<speak who="ND-ND">
Lrrr!</speak>

<speak who="LRRR">
Oh, alright, cottage cheese!</speak>

<speak who="KIF">
Sir? <info>(whispering)</info> There aren't that 
many human beings.</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
A though occurs: There aren't that many 
humans.</speak>

<speak who="LRRR">
We're willing to wait a few weeks while 
you shore up the numbers.</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Hmm. 198 billion babies in a few weeks. 
We'll need an army of super-virile men 
scoring 'round the clock! I'll do my 
part. Kif, clear my schedule.</speak>

<info>Kif takes out an Etch-A-Sketch and shakes it.</info>

<info>DOOP Headquarters: Main Room. Hundreds of people sit waiting 
for the negotiations to end. Fry is slumped in a chair.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
I wish they'd just wipe out humanity 
and get it over with. It's the waiting 
I can't stand.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
That's stupid.</speak>

<info>The door to the secret conference room opens. Zapp, Kif, Lrrr 
and Nd-Nd walk out. Everyone cheers and Zapp waves.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
My fellow Earthlings, we have reached 
an agreement. Using the twin guns of 
grace and tact, I blasted our worthless 
enemies with a fair compromise.  They 
will not eat everyone on Earth.</speak>

<speak who="LRRR">
I filled up on nuts at the negotiation.</speak>

<info>Nd-Nd shakes her head.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Instead, they will eat only a single 
human of their choice.</speak>

<speak who="LRRR">
We choose to eat the first Earthling 
who ate our offspring.  Here is the 
culprit, as photographed by our nanny-cam 
satellite.  She must be sacrificed, 
but the rest of you shall be spared.</speak>

<info>Everyone cheers, except Leela, who boos.</info>

<info>Madison Cube Garden. The sign outside reads "Slurm Concert Series 
Present: An Evening With A Human-Eating Monster". Inside, the

a table and chairs on it. Linda presents the TV coverage from 
a commentary box.</info>

<info>The door opens. Lrrr, Nd-Nd and some other Omicronians walk 
out, waving. Nd-Nd sits at the table and the other Omicronians 
sit down behind her. Lrrr stands at a mic.</info>

<speak who="LRRR">
Greetings, Earth morsels.</speak>

<info>The crowd boos.</info>

<speak who="MAN">
<info>(shouting)</info> You suck!</speak>

<speak who="LRRR">
Get a job!</speak>

<info>Backstage, Bender peeps through the curtain and then turns around.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
I'll miss you, Leela.  I know you're 
just a carbon-based life form but I'll 
always think of you as a big pile of 
titanium.</speak>

<info>He sobs. Fry puts his arm around him.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
What Bender means is, you're really 
brave, and smart, and beautiful, and 
a great friend.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
<info>(crying)</info> Just like titanium!</speak>

<info>He cries into Fry's lap.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
This is all a big load. I was the one 
trying to save the Popplers.  You were 
sucking them down like the fat hog you 
are and you were stepping on them for 
fun.  You both should be in here instead 
of me.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
<info>(whispering to Fry)</info> Someone's acting 
awfully aluminum.</speak>

<info>Enter Zapp.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Leela, my sweet, I've come to save you. 
I have a devious plan!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Oh, great, Captain Moron has a plan. 
Why don't you tell it to Wingus and 
Dingus here?</speak>

<info>Zapp turns to Fry and Bender.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Wingus? Dingus? Listen up. We're gonna 
give the aliens the old switcheroo!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
You mean -</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Correct. I found a giant hideous ape 
that looks exactly like Leela.</speak>

<info>Kif wheels in a cage holding an orang-utan that is wearing a 
white tank top, black trousers and boots like Leela's.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
It doesn't look anything like me. The 
hair is all wrong.</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Don't worry. Kif is an expert stylist, 
as you can plainly see.  Mmm!</speak>

<info>Kif groans and walks into the cage. He puts a sheet around the 
orang-utan, squirts some shampoo onto its head and starts rubbing 
it in.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
You know, this might actually work. 
The Omicronians seem to have trouble 
telling one person from another.</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
True. At the negotiations, they thought 
Kif here was the statesman and I was 
a jabbering mental patient. Isn't that 
right, Kif?</speak>

<speak who="KIF">
Please, I'm creating.  Voila!</speak>

<info>The orang-utan grabs a banana, eats it and scratches itself.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Bingo!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
That's Leela!</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
I'm seeing double!</speak>

<info>On the other side of the curtain, Lrrr sits at a table.</info>

<speak who="LRRR">
I grow hungry! Bring on the one called 
"Leela".</speak>

<info>A waiter fills his wine glass.</info>

<speak who="WAITER">
That comes with salad or soup.</speak>

<speak who="LRRR">
Uh, salad.</speak>

<speak who="WAITER">
Ranch or vinaigrette?</speak>

<speak who="LRRR">
Vinaigrette!</speak>

<speak who="WAITER">
Balsamic or raspberry?</speak>

<info>Lrrr picks up a laser from under the table and vapourises the 
waiter. Zapp pulls on the cage with the Leela-ape inside. Nd-Nd 
takes it out and puts it on the table. The crowd sees and murmurs.</info>

<speak who="WOMAN #1">
<info>(murmuring)</info> What's going on here? It's 
very strange.</speak>

<info>Zapp whispers into the microphone.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
<info>(whispering)</info> People of Earth: Shh!</speak>

<speak who="WOMAN #1">
<info>(murmuring)</info> Oh, I get it.</speak>

<speak who="WOMAN #2">
<info>(murmuring)</info> I understand.</speak>

<info>Lrrr looks back and forth between a photo of Leela and the orang-utan. 
They are both sat in the same pose.</info>

<speak who="LRRR">
Hmm. Yes, this is one. Definitely. I 
recognise her slumping posture and hairy 
knuckles.</speak>

<info>Leela is taken aback and looks at her own knuckles. Lrrr puts 
a lot of salt on the orang-utan.</info>

<speak who="ND-ND">
<info>(sarcastic)</info> Would you like some human 
with your salt?</speak>

<info>Lrrr picks up the orang-utan and opens his mouth.</info>

<speak who="LINDA">
This is it. If the aliens fall for Zapp's 
ploy, the Earth will be saved. Brought 
to you by Fishy Joe's. Ride the walrus.</speak>

<info>Lrrr is about to eat the orang-utan when some idiot shouts from 
the crowd.</info>

<speak who="WATERFALL JR">.
Wait, stop! It's a trick! That's not 
Leela.</speak>

<info>The crowd boos and Lrrr puts the orang-utan back on the table. 
Waterfall Jr. runs onto the stage.</info>

<speak who="LRRR">
W-What's happening? I'm losing the crowd.</speak>

<speak who="WATERFALL JR">.
It's an orang-utan. One of Mother Earth's 
most precious creatures.</speak>

<info>He hugs the orang-utan and it starts to scratch his hair and 
eat his fleas. Lrrr puts on a pair of glasses. Zapp grabs Waterfall 
Jr. by the hair and drags him away.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Why'd you open your bong hole you smelly 
hippie? You'd sacrifice a beautiful 
woman to save a moderately-attractive 
monkey? You must've smoked some bad 
granola.</speak>

<speak who="LRRR">
The one called "Smelly Hippie" is right. 
This is a monkey!</speak>

<info>Nd-Nd eats it whole.</info>

<speak who="ND-ND">
Yes. Definitely.</speak>

<speak who="LRRR">
Where is the real female?</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
I'll never tell.</speak>

<info>He crosses his arms and Lrrr points a laser to his head.</info>

<speak who="LRRR">
Where is the real female?</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
I'll get her for you.</speak>

<info>He runs off.</info>

<info>Time Lapse. Zapp pushes Leela's cage out onto the stage.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
I realise this may hurt our chances 
of consummating our relationship again.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Go consummate yourself.</speak>

<speak who="LRRR">
Stop talking, you're getting cold.</speak>

<info>He reaches into the cage and grabs Leela around the waist.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Please! I just paid off my car!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
No!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
I can't look!</speak>

<info>He takes his eyes out, puts them in his chest cabinet and looks 
back towards Leela. Lrrr puts Leela in his mouth.</info>

<speak who="POPPLER">
Stop!  People of Earth. I am Jrrr of 
the planet Omicron Persei 8. Could someone 
lower this thing for me?  Now then, 
if Leela gets eaten, I get eaten.</speak>

<info>The Omicronians gasp.</info>

<speak who="ND-ND">
Little one, get out of there. I'm going 
to count to blorks!</speak>

<speak who="JRRR">
But elder one -</speak>

<info>Nd-Nd starts counting off her fingers.</info>

<speak who="ND-ND">
Flingle. Glorg. Glorg and a gloob.</speak>

<speak who="JRRR">
Hear me out. There are many good reasons 
to eat. Hunger, boredom, wanting to 
be the world's fattest man. But not 
revenge. Are we no better than they? 
Besides, Leela's my friend.</speak>

<speak who="LRRR">
<info>(mumbling)</info> Is this true, Earthling?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
<info>(mumbling)</info> Yeah, it is.</speak>

<info>He takes her out of his mouth.</info>

<speak who="LRRR">
Leela's garbled words have opened my 
eyes.</speak>

<info>The crowd cheers and Leela spits out and pokes Jrrr, who giggles. 
Waterfall Jr. holds the mic and strokes his hair.</info>

<speak who="WATERFALL JR">.
OK, that's a start. That's very Earth-friendly. 
Now everyone join hands. Join hands, 
please. I'd like to lead you all in 
some swaying. Come on, pay attention. 
I said do it! Yeah...</speak>

<speak who="LRRR">
Is he your friend too?</speak>

<speak who="JRRR">
No.</speak>

<info>Lrrr eats Waterfall Jr. He pokes his head out of Lrrr's mouth.</info>

<speak who="WATERFALL JR">.
This is not happening.</speak>

<info>Lrrr swallows him and everyone cheers and applauds. Lrrr clutches 
his stomach.</info>

<speak who="LRRR">
I think there was something funny in 
that hippie.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Thank you, Jrrr.  I hope you'll always 
think of me as your mom.</speak>

<speak who="JRRR">
When my species grows up, we eat our 
moms!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Whoop!</speak>

<info>She tosses Jrrr to Nd-Nd.</info>

<speak who="LRRR">
People of Earth - oh, that hippie's 
starting to kick in - we've all learned 
a valuable lesson today, I realise now 
that - dude! My hand are huge!  The 
can touch anything but themselves.  
Oh, wait.</speak>

<speak who="ND-ND">
Let's go.</speak>

<info>She pulls her cape across her and she and the other Omicronians 
walk off. A heavily stoned Lrrr stares at his cape and feels 
it.</info>

<speak who="LRRR">
Whoa!</speak>

<info>Nd-Nd pushes him off the stage.</info>

<info>Outside Madison Cube Garden. Four Omicronian ships head off 
into space and another follows, weaving around the sky.</info>

<speak who="LRRR">
Whoa, I feel like I'm flying!</speak>

<info>Planet Express: Meeting Room. The crew sit around the table 
and Bender puts a plate with a cover on the table.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
A toast to Leela. She showed us it's 
wrong to eat certain things.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Hear, hear!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Let's get drunk!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Aww, thanks, guys. Pass the veal, please.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Here you go.</speak>

<info>He passes a plate over.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Mmm, let me get some of that suckling 
pig.</speak>

<info>Amy passes it to him. Bender holds up a plate.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Who wants dolphin?</speak>

<info>Everyone gasps.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Dolphin? But dolphins are intelligent.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Not this one. He blew all his money 
on instant lottery tickets.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
OK.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Oh, OK.</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
That's different.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Good, good.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Pass the blowhole.</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
Can I have a fluke?</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
Hey, quit hogging the bottle-nose.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Toss me the speech centre of the brain!</speak>
