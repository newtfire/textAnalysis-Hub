<info>Planet Express: Meeting Room. The staff are sat around the table. 
Zoidberg is wearing a suit.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Good news, everyone! Today marks our 
dear friend Dr. Zoidberg's 10th year 
with Planet Express. Huzzahs are in 
order.</speak>

<info>The crew react uninterestedly.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
<info>(unenthusiastic)</info> Huzzah!</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Hooray for me! Hooray for Zoidberg!</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
I will now read the mandatory speech. 
<info>(reading)</info> Dear employee: Has it really 
been five, 10 or 15 years? If not, please 
disregard this and get back to work. 
Distribute token of appreciation and 
applaud.</speak>

<info>He gives Zoidberg an envelope and claps. Zoidberg opens it and 
takes out two coupons.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Look! Coupons! I can get two oil changes 
for the price of one! Now if I could 
only afford the one ... and the car. 
Ah, the years! So many memories, so 
many strange fluids gushing out of patients' 
bodies--</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
Yes, yes. Now here's your pension statement. 
It's empty because you haven't paid 
into it, you dumb stinkbug!</speak>

<info>Zoidberg wipes away a tear.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
You kept track of it all these years!</speak>

<info>He hugs Hermes. Fry smacks his head.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Oh, no, I'm boned! I haven't paid into 
the pension either. What'll I do when 
I retire?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
I thought you were retired.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Hey, I don't see you planning for your 
old age.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
I got plans. I'm gonna turn my on/off 
switch to "off".</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Well I'm gonna take action. It's time 
to check on my retirement fund.  Damn! 
Still only $100.</speak>

<speak who="FRANKLIN">
<info>(on bill)</info> A penny saved is a penny earned. 
Also, could you get some athlete's foot 
cream for my face?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
He's right! I've gotta start investing 
wisely.</speak>

<info>Outside 7^11. Fry and Bender sit on the kerb. Bender drinks 
beer.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Well, I'm down to my last lottery ticket. 
Cherry.  Cherry!  Mule. Crud!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
So, you got six bucks left to retire 
on. I recommend Tender Vittles.</speak>

<info>Big Apple Bank.</info>

<speak who="TELLER">
You're opening a retirement account 
for $6? I'm sure a wealthy ...  ... 
mule farmer like yourself is aware that 
we charge a $10 monthly fee.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
<info>(shrugging)</info> You gotta spend money to 
make money.</speak>

<info>The teller presses some buttons.</info>

<speak who="TELLER">
Here you are, sir. Your account is now 
overdrawn by $4.</speak>

<info>An orange robot in the queue behind Bender becomes impatient 
and nudges Bender.</info>

<speak who="ROBOT">
Gee, I've seen lines move faster in 
a sperm bank.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
That's for sure--  Roberto! Is that 
you?</speak>

<speak who="ROBERTO">
Bender! Hey, man!</speak>

<info>He punches Bender's body a few times and then in the head which 
makes it spin. Bender stops it from spinning and laughs.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
You old lunatic! How you been?</speak>

<speak who="ROBERTO">
Not bad, not bad.  Everybody on the 
floor! This is a stick-up!</speak>

<info>The customers scream and do as he says. Fry screams and hides 
behind a plant. Bender seems oblivious.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Yeah, I'm doing OK too.  I'm taking 
a Chinese cooking class at the Learning 
Annex.</speak>

<speak who="ROBERTO">
Cool. Ca-Can you give me a hand here?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Sure thing, pal.</speak>

<info>He picks up the bag. Fry moves behind the plant.</info>

<speak who="ROBERTO">
Hey, you! Red!  Quit watering that plant 
and get the door!</speak>

<info>Fry runs for the door and kicks a woman on the way.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Well, nice talking to you.</speak>

<speak who="ROBERTO">
Same here.  You guys are alright! Here's 
something for your trouble.</speak>

<info>He gives then a bag each and leaves.</info>

<info>Cut to: Outside Big Apple Bank. Roberto runs off down the street.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Hey, thanks, buddy!</speak>

<info>Police cars pull up around the door and Smitty and URL jump 
on Fry and Bender.</info>

<info>Cut to: Big Apple Bank.</info>

<speak who="SMITTY">
Freeze, punks! You're under arrest!</speak>

<speak who="NIXON">
<info>(on $1000 bill)</info> Shoot them in the back! 
Quick! While they're not looking!</speak>

<info>Famous Original Ray's Superior Court. Fry and Bender are represented 
by the Hyper-Chicken lawyer. Bender is wearing a tie and jacket.</info>

<speak who="BAILLIF">
Court is in session. The Honourable 
Judge Whitey presiding.</speak>

<speak who="WHITEY">
The charge is bank robbery. Now, my 
caddie chauffeur informs me that a bank 
is a place where people put money that 
isn't properly invested. Therefore, 
robbing a bank is tantamount to that 
most heinous of crimes: Theft of money!</speak>

<info>He bangs his gavel.</info>

<info>Time Lapse. The surveillance camera is in the witness box.</info>

<speak who="HYPERCHICKEN">
As the surveillance camera for the bank 
what all the judge was a-jawing about, 
could ya'll tell us what you done seen 
the day of the crime?</speak>

<speak who="CAMERA">
Well, let's see. My memory's a little 
fuzzy, but it went exactly like this:</speak>

<info>It projects a black and white picture of Fry and Bender taking 
the money from Roberto. The court gasps.</info>

<speak who="HYPERCHICKEN">
Your Honour, I move that I be disbarred 
for introducing this evidence against 
my own clients.</speak>

<info>Time Lapse. Fry is in the witness box.</info>

<speak who="HYPERCHICKEN">
Mr. Fry, do you recognise the robot 
a-huggin' on you in this here hologram?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
I sure do! That's the real robber and 
I'll never forget his name as long as 
I live. And that name is--</speak>

<info>The projection goes off and Fry gasps. He sees a badly-disguised 
Roberto at the back of the court. He waves his knife at Fry. 
Fry chokes.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
<info>(shouting)</info> Fry! Just give a name. You 
don't wanna look stupid on Court TV!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
You're right. You're right. It was--</speak>

<info>A mobile phone playing Mozart's Eine Kleine Nacht Musik as a 
ringtone goes off. It is Judge Whitey's.</info>

<speak who="WHITEY">
Yes? What? You say if I testify I'll 
be killed? Oh. It's for you.</speak>

<info>He holds it out to Fry. Fry takes it.</info>

<speak who="ROBERTO">
...and the other hamburger will...</speak>

<info>Roberto is sat among other people who don't seem to notice he 
is talking on his phone.</info>

<speak who="ROBERTO">
...also be made of your lungs. So long, 
pal.</speak>

<info>He hangs up. Fry gulps and leans into the mic.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
I refuse to testify on the grounds that 
my organs will be chopped up into a 
pattï¿½.</speak>

<speak who="WHITEY">
Ah, the 67th Amendment.</speak>

<info>The Hyper-Chicken leans into Bender.</info>

<speak who="HYPERCHICKEN">
I may be a simple country Hyper-Chicken 
but I know when we're finger-licked. 
Whattya say we plead insanity?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
A few months in an insane asylum? I 
could do that standing on my head.</speak>

<speak who="HYPERCHICKEN">
If you start now, it might help our 
case.</speak>

<info>Time Lapse. The Hyper-Chicken pecks and scratches at the floor.</info>

<speak who="WHITEY">
Counselor, what evidence do you offer 
to support this new plea of insanity?</speak>

<speak who="HYPERCHICKEN">
Well, for one, they done hired me to 
represent them.</speak>

<info>Whitey bangs his gavel.</info>

<speak who="WHITEY">
Insanity plea is accepted. Mr. Bender, 
I hereby commit you to the asylum for 
criminally insane robots until such 
time as you are deemed cured.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Yahoo! The system fails again!</speak>

<speak who="WHITEY">
And, Mr. Fry, I sentence you to the 
home for criminally insane humans.</speak>

<speak who="BAILIFF">
Your Honour, that facility has been 
full ever since you ruled that being 
poor is a mental illness.</speak>

<speak who="WHITEY">
Order! Order! The only poor people 
I want to hear about are the people 
who tend to my pores at the spa. Just 
send them both to the robot loony bin 
and let's go.</speak>

<info>Two men wrap Fry and Bender in bubblewrap and one stamps "Defective 
Electronics" on Fry's forehead. They are put into a cardboard 
box and it is taped up. The men then "roll" the box out of the 
room by tipping it onto each side.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
<info>(from box)</info> Ow! My head! Ow! My feet! 
Ow! My head! Ow! My feet!</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Keep your chin up!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
<info>(from box)</info> Ow! My chin!</speak>

<info>Hal Institute For Criminally Insane Robots. Fry, Bender and 
other robots move through a room along a conveyor belt. Fry taps 
Bender on the shoulder.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
I don't belong here, Bender. This is 
an asylum for insane robots!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Well, you meet half the qualifications.</speak>

<info>He laughs. The robots move through a door with a sign saying 
"Physical Exam" over the doorway.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Oh, good, a physical! Once they examine 
my fragile, naked, pink body, they'll 
see I'm not a--</speak>

<info>A chute sucks his clothes clean off his body leaving him with 
nothing but his naked pink skin. He moves along the belt, through 
the door and screams.</info>

<info>Montage: In another room, Bender is picked up by a magnet and 
taken through the ceiling somewhere. The magnet tries to pick 
up Fry but just prods him. Fry screams. Later, a drill bit drills 
through Bender's head as he hums. Fry is next and screams when 
he sees the drill. The drill goes into his mouth and rotates 
inside. Next is a gamma ray scan. Bender passes through and we 
see a bat flying around in his chest cabinet. Fry gets one next. 
His stomach acid starts to boil.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
What the--?</speak>

<info>He burps.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
<info>(shouting)</info> I find that offensive!</speak>

<info>Hal Institute: Dr. Perceptron's Office. Dr. Perceptron, a doctor 
of Freudian Circuit Analysis has what looks like a cheap plasma 
ball for a head and a casing that looks like a white coat. He 
speaks in a robotic voice. Fry falls through a hatch in the ceiling 
and lands in the floor. He hauls himself up.</info>

<speak who="DR PERCEPTRON">
Greetings. I am Dr. Perceptron. Let 
me give you something to help you relax.</speak>

<info>He presses a button and Fry gets an electric shock.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Look! There's been a terrible mistake. 
I'm a human being. See?  I'm all squishy 
and flabby. Also, I complain a lot.</speak>

<speak who="DR PERCEPTRON">
Yes, you do. You need to relax more. 
Terrific. Now, consider the following: 
You were admitted to this robot asylum. 
Therefore, you must be a robot. Diagnosis 
complete.</speak>

<info>The plasma in his head goes off. Fry grabs his arms.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
I do other human stuff! I age! See?</speak>

<info>He indicates his face. The door opens and a robot nurse comes 
in.</info>

<speak who="NURSE RATCHET">
I'm Nurse Ratchet. Please come with 
me, won't you?</speak>

<info>A panel in her chest opens and a straight jacket on an arm comes 
out and wraps itself around Fry. She retracts it by using her 
arm as a winch.</info>

<info>Hal Institute Corridor. Nurse Ratchet is holding Fry against 
her in his straight jacket. They move past other cells.</info>

<speak who="NURSE RATCHET">
We'll meet your roommate next, shall 
we? His name is Malfunctioning Eddie.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
The car dealer? Wow! I guess his prices 
really were insane.</speak>

<speak who="NURSE RATCHET">
He's very excitable.  So don't say anything 
to excite him.</speak>

<info>Fry steps in.</info>

<info>Cut to: Hal Institute Cell. The door closes. The cell is a tiny 
space, the right size for a robot. Malfunctioning Eddie is standing 
with a cigarette, shaking a little. He holds out his hand.</info>

<speak who="MALFUNCTIONING EDDIE">
Pleased to meet you.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Actually, we've met once before.</speak>

<speak who="MALFUNCTIONING EDDIE">
What?</speak>

<info>He explodes.</info>

<info>Hal Institute Day Room. Bender passes a group of robots playing 
cards, a sign that says "You Don't Have to Be Crazy to Mutter 
to Yourself Here But it Helps", a robot caressing a column and 
various others.</info>

<speak who="HAIRBOT">
I'm a pretty girl. I'm a pretty girl. 
I'm a pretty girl.</speak>

<info>Bender sits with Fry.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Whoa! Someone had a busy day.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
My roommate exploded. Oh, you gotta 
help me, Bender. How can I prove I'm 
human?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
You could drop dead. That'd show 'em.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
I don't wanna!</speak>

<speak who="UNIT 2013">
Hey, man. I believe you're a human.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
You do?</speak>

<speak who="UNIT 2013">
Sure. They don't believe I'm a human 
either. Name's Unit 2013. C'mon. Lemme 
introduce you around.  Fry, meet Norm. 
How's it going, pal? Still picking up 
transmissions from the CIA on your teeth?</speak>

<speak who="NORM">
They just won't stop!</speak>

<info>He opens his mouth and his teeth have little revolving satellite 
dishes on them.</info>

<speak who="WOMAN">
The CIA cafeteria menu for the week 
of May 15th is as follows: Monday, shepherd's 
pie. Tu--</speak>

<speak who="UNIT 2013">
Cuckoo!</speak>

<info>They look at an Abraham Lincoln robot in the corner.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Let me guess: He thinks he's Lincoln?</speak>

<speak who="UNIT 2013">
Well, he's supposed to. Problem is he's 
got multiple personalities; all of them 
Lincoln.</speak>

<info>The robot stands up.</info>

<speak who="LINCOLNBOT">
I was born in 200 log cabins.</speak>

<info>Hal Institue Cafeteria. Fry and Unit 2013 queue for dinner.</info>

<speak who="UNIT 2013">
And this here is Frankie. He's convinced 
he's a lunchroom worker, so they put 
him to work in the lunchroom. <info>(patronising)</info> 
How is work in the lunchroom, Frankie?</speak>

<speak who="FRANKIE">
It's alright.</speak>

<speak who="UNIT 2013">
Poor Frankie!</speak>

<info>Frankie ladels some oil onto Fry's tray. Fry then sits at a 
table with a Pay 'n' Chew vending machine, the Lincolnbot, Bender, 
Unit 2013 and some other robots.</info>

<speak who="MAD HATTERBOT">
Change places!</speak>

<info>The robots move around the table. They knock into Fry and he 
spills his oil on his gown.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Bender, I can't take much more of this! 
I want outta here!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Are you crazy? This place is great! 
Electroshock whenever you want it, two 
Lincolns for every Napoleon.  Ah! Sweet 
light crude!</speak>

<info>He takes some money sticking out from the vending machine pay 
slot and wipes his mouth with it.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
But I'm not a robot like you. I don't 
like having discs crammed into me. Unless 
they're Oreos - and then only in the 
mouth! Don't you understand? I'm gonna 
die here!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Ah, quit your bellyaching and take it 
like a robot.</speak>

<info>Fry growls.</info>

<speak who="MAD HATTERBOT">
Change places!</speak>

<info>The robots move again and Fry spills more oil.</info>

<info>Hal Institute Visitors' Room. A banner advertises "Gibberish 
Translators Available". Victor sits with Malfunctioning Eddie.</info>

<speak who="VICTOR">
The doctor says you are making great 
strides with your exploding problem.</speak>

<speak who="MALFUNCTIONING EDDIE">
Well the way I see it=--</speak>

<info>He explodes and Victor falls back on his chair. At another table 
are Fry, Bender, Leela, Farnsworth, Amy and Hermes. Fry has his 
arms wrapped around his legs and has very pale skin. Bender is 
wearing a Napoleon hat and has one of his arms inside his door. 
One of Malfunctioning Eddie's arms lands in the middle of the 
table.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
You gotta get me out of here. I would 
have starved to death if not for that 
sick vending machine robot.  Gimmie! 
Gimmie!</speak>

<info>He dives for it and eats it, wrapper and all.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
Poor Fry! He's got the munchies for 
freedom!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
We're all trying to help you. We've 
petitioned the governor but he doesn't 
want to appear soft on people who've 
been falsely imprisoned.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
At least I have friends on the outside. 
Bender's been no help at all.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Je suis Napoleon!  No, seriously, I'm 
not.</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
Bender! You should be more ashamed of 
yourself than usual.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Ah, lighten up, honey. I'm just trying 
to get through a difficult time using 
humour.</speak>

<info>Nurse Ratchet wheels past.</info>

<speak who="NURSE RATCHET">
Visiting hours are over. Time for our 
medication disks.</speak>

<info>The Planet Express staff get up to leave. Fry grabs Farnsworth.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
<info>(shouting)</info> Help me! For God's sake, 
help me!</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Oh, don't worry, Fry. I too once spent 
a nightmare-ish time in a robot asylum. 
But now it's nearly over. So long.</speak>

<info>He leaves.</info>

<info>Hal Institute Cell. It is night and Fry and Malfunctioning Eddie 
are sleeping. Fry mutters in his sleep.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
<info>(sleep-talking)</info> Thirty days hath September, 
April, June and ... wonder ... is that 
peanut butter ... what am I gonna do? 
<info>(talking)</info> Oh, God! What? What? What 
is it now?</speak>

<info>The door opens. Nurse Ratchet and Dr. Perceptron are outside.</info>

<speak who="DR PERCEPTRON">
You are being released.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Finally! Sweet justice! Sweet, juicy 
justice!</speak>

<speak who="DR PERCEPTRON">
Not you. Him.</speak>

<info>He points at Malfunctioning Eddie.</info>

<speak who="MALFUNCTIONING EDDIE">
Me? What a surprise.  Look!</speak>

<info>Cut to: Hal Institute Corridor. Eddie rolls out of the cell.</info>

<speak who="MALFUNCTIONING EDDIE">
I barely exploded at all.</speak>

<info>He and Perceptron roll away.</info>

<speak who="DR PERCEPTRON">
We can control that with medication.</speak>

<speak who="NURSE RATCHET">
Fry? Are we ready to meet our new roommate?</speak>

<info>A porter pushes a metal box to the cell doorway.</info>

<info>Cut to: Hal Institute Cell. The door of the box opens revealing 
Roberto. Fry gasps.</info>

<speak who="ROBERTO">
Hi, Red!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Roberto! W-W-W-What are you doing here?</speak>

<info>Roberto steps out and holds up his knife.</info>

<speak who="ROBERTO">
I got busted robbing that bank again.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Why would you hold up the same bank 
twice?</speak>

<speak who="ROBERTO">
Ah, that first time was just to case 
the joint and rob it a little.  What's 
the matter? You scared?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
N--, n--, n--</speak>

<speak who="ROBERTO">
Noticeably? I'll say! Now stand back, 
I gotta practice my stabbing.</speak>

<info>He stabs at the air and makes nutcase noises. Fry ducks and 
dodges the knife.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
No! Please! Help! Stop it! Please!</speak>

<info>Bender bangs from the next cell.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
<info>(shouting; from cell)</info> Hey! Keep it down 
in there! I'm tuning my banjo!</speak>

<info>He tunes it and Fry keeps dodging the knife.</info>

<speak who="ROBERTO">
Jeez, Red. Quit cowering. You call yourself 
a robot?</speak>

<info>He stabs some more.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
I'm not a robot! <info>(shouting)</info> I'm not 
a robot!</speak>

<info>He screams.</info>

<info>Hal Institute: Dr. Perceptron's Office. The other Planet Express 
staff are there.</info>

<speak who="DR PERCEPTRON">
In answer to your question, Hermes, 
yes, your friend is cured.</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
Oh!</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
What a relief!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Thank God!</speak>

<info>The door opens and Fry walks in with an emotionless look on 
his face.</info>

<speak who="DR PERCEPTRON">
You'll notice he no longer suffers delusions 
of humanity.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
<info>(mechanical voice)</info> Affirmative. I feel 
nothing. I am a robot. Beep, beep, beep 
...</speak>

<info>The Planet Express staff gasp.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
You've made a terrible mistake. He's 
a human being, not a machine. Oh, Fry!</speak>

<info>She holds Fry to her chest and he "beeps" faster. Nurse Ratchet 
pushes Bender in a wheelchair past the door. He sings and plays 
the banjo.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
<info>(singing)</info> Gonna sing a little tale about 
a battle called Waterloo. <info>(talking)</info> 
Bonjour, y'all!</speak>

<info>Planet Express: Zoidberg's Office. Fry is sat on the examination 
table and the other staff stand around.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Listen to me, Fry. Just because you 
think you're a robot, doesn't make you 
a robot. After all, I think I'm a doctor 
but that doesn't make me a doctor. These 
fancy clothes do!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
<info>(mechanical voice)</info> Negative. I must 
be a robot. Why else would human women 
refuse to date me?</speak>

<info>Leela strokes his hair.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Oh, lots of reasons.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
<info>(mechanical voice)</info> Bio-units, terminate 
noise exchange. It is time for you to 
ingest sandwiches from my compartment.</speak>

<info>He unzips his trousers, takes out two sandwiches and offers 
them to the others. They back away.</info>

<info>Hal Institute Day Room. Bender tunes Norm's teeth with a screwdriver.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Here we go. Just a minute. Aha!</speak>

<speak who="COMMENTATOR">
And down the stretch, it's Daddy's 
Little Grandpa, followed by Perennial 
Loser, and bringing up the rear, it's 
Lasty!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Come on, Lasty!</speak>

<speak who="ROBERTO">
Hey, Bender.</speak>

<info>He is pushing a hover-bed. Bender turns around and fakes surprise.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Roberto! Ooh, what a surprise to see 
you in here! Especially 'cause I didn't 
squeal on you, remember? Remember all 
that squealing I didn't do? Remember? 
Do ya?</speak>

<speak who="ROBERTO">
Yeah, yeah. Now lie down and play dead. 
And don't ham it up!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Uh, sure.  Anything for you, buddy.</speak>

<info>Enter Dr. Perceptron.</info>

<speak who="ROBERTO">
Wait here, Bender. I need to get a disguise.</speak>

<info>From offscreen come the sounds of Roberto beating up Perceptron 
and making the nutcase noise. He comes back to the hover-bed 
wearing Perceptron's body casing and head ball. He starts pushing 
the bed through walls. Bender opens one side of his visor.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Uh, what's with the get-up?</speak>

<speak who="ROBERTO">
I'm in disguise 'cause I'm thinking 
of escaping. You in? Or do I gotta kill 
ya so you don't squeal?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
I'm in! I'm in!  So when were you planning 
the breakout?</speak>

<speak who="ROBERTO">
I'm thinking maybe a few seconds ago.</speak>

<info>Bender looks up and sees they are a few hundred yards from the 
institute in amongst several trees. A siren goes off and Bender 
jumps off the bed.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Quick! Let's keep escaping!</speak>

<info>They run off into the woods.</info>

<info>Cut to: Outside Hal Institute. Tracker dogs sniff some nuts 
and bolts and run off after Bender and Roberto with two men following.</info>

<info>Cut to: Woods. Bender and Roberto come to a ravine. There is 
a small boat tied to the side. They jump and go straight through 
it and into the river.</info>

<info>Time Lapse. Clear of the woods, they run into a barn. Seconds 
later they crash through the back and take off in a biplane. 
The biplane does an inside loop and crashes through the barn 
doors. Roberto and Bender carry on on foot.</info>

<info>Planet Express: Hermes' Office.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
Times two, carry the one ...</speak>

<info>He presses a "carry the one" button on his calculator and looks 
up to see Fry standing beside him.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Oh, you sad, worthless human.</speak>

<info>He picks up the calculator and throws it into a conveniently-located 
incinerator.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
What are ya--? Sacred hog of Prague! 
That was my anniversary gift to LaBarbara!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Fear not! For I shall assist ye!</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
Robots don't say "ye"!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Relax, mammal. My robotic software shall 
meet your calculatory needs.  What is 
the meaning of this symbol?</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
That's a plus sign, you pointy-haired 
loony! Quit thinking you're a robot!</speak>

<info>Fry narrows his eyes.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
I'll show ye!</speak>

<info>Planet Express: Hangar. Farnsworth, Amy and Leela work on the 
ship. Leela tries to unscrew a nut on the side of the steps. 
She grunts and squirts some pi-in-1 oil onto it. Fry takes the 
spanner from her and throws it into another incinerator.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Stand back. I'm a tool-bot.</speak>

<info>He tries to unscrew the nut with his hands. He takes the oil 
from Leela, squirts some onto his arms and puts it in his inside 
pocket. He tries the nut again.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
You're not a tool-bot. You're not a 
food-motron. You're not a robot of any 
kind.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Yes, I am. I simply haven't discovered 
my primary function yet.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
OK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to 
remind Fry of his humanity the way only 
a woman can.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
You're going to do his laundry?</speak>

<info>Amy slaps him.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
<info>(sexfully)</info> Fry, this is for you.</speak>

<info>She kisses him. Fry smiles and Leela smiles back, thinking she's 
cured him.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Beep.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Oh, for God's sake!</speak>

<info>Planet Express: Lounge. Fry sits on the couch and finishes another 
bottle of beer. He throws it down on the floor at Zoidberg's 
feet.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
By a scallop's forelocks! What's with 
all the beer, Fry?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
<info>(drunk)</info> Alcohol fuels my power cells. 
And as a mighty robot, I--  Beep.</speak>

<info>He starts to snore.</info>

<info>New New York City Street.</info>

<speak who="ROBERTO">
Thanks for helping me escape, Bender.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Oh, it was nothing.</speak>

<speak who="ROBERTO">
<info>(shouting)</info> It was not nothing! <info>(talking)</info> 
I wanna repay you. Let me get you something 
in here.</speak>

<info>He drags Bender into the Big Apple Bank.</info>

<info>Cut to: Big Apple Bank.</info>

<speak who="ROBERTO">
<info>(shouting)</info> Hands up! This is a stick-up 
again!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Wow! Hitting the same place three times? 
I admire your style, Roberto.</speak>

<info>Roberto walks to the teller.</info>

<speak who="ROBERTO">
Gimmie the remaining dough. And the 
calendars ... and that pen. Try to tear 
it so most of the beads are on my end!</speak>

<info>The teller ducks and URL and Smitty stand up behind her with 
their lasers armed.</info>

<speak who="URL">
Police! You're busted!</speak>

<speak who="SMITTY">
And don't try anything. This glass here 
is laser-proof.  Fire lasers!  Duck! 
Lasers!</speak>

<info>Roberto pulls the glass clean off the mount and with his arm 
still poking through he grabs the money.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Come on! I got a place where I like 
to hide after crimes.</speak>

<info>They run out. URL and Smitty fire at them again and Roberto 
uses the glass as a sheild until they are out of the door.</info>

<info>Planet Express: Lounge. The staff watch Fry sleeping on the 
overturned couch.</info>

<speak who="AMY">
Aw! He looks like a little insane drunken 
angel.</speak>

<info>Enter Bender and Roberto.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
<info>(panting)</info> Hey, everybody. Meet my good 
pal, Roberto.</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
Hey, mon.</speak>

<speak who="ROBERTO">
Nice to meet you.</speak>

<speak who="SMITTY">
<info>(on megaphone; from outside)</info> Come out 
with your hands up.</speak>

<speak who="ROBERTO">
<info>(shouting)</info> Hostages!</speak>

<info>Outside Planet Express. Police cars surround the building. Roberto 
stands at the window with his knife at Zoidberg's neck.</info>

<speak who="ROBERTO">
Back off! I got hostages!</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Hooray! I'm helping!</speak>

<speak who="SMITTY">
<info>(on megaphone)</info> Do you have any better 
hostages?</speak>

<info>The megaphone is built into URL.</info>

<info>Cut to: Planet Express: Lounge. Roberto turns around.</info>

<speak who="ROBERTO">
To show them who's crazy, I'm gonna 
execute some of you. How 'bout you?</speak>

<info>He nicks Farnsworth's neck.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Ouch! That's going to bleed when my 
heart beats.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Wait! Take me first!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Yes! Take her first.</speak>

<speak who="ROBERTO">
Shut up! Stop telling me how to do this!</speak>

<info>Time Lapse. More police cars have arrived outside. Roberto has 
everyone except Fry tied up in the middle of the room. They mutter 
in fright.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Oh, the fear!</speak>

<info>Roberto kneels next to Bender.</info>

<speak who="ROBERTO">
I'm thinking of a number between one 
and ten. Guess it and you die first. 
Go!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Um ... OK. Fixty ... six ... ish?</speak>

<speak who="ROBERTO">
56? 56? Oh, man! Now that's all I can 
think about! I'm gonna kill you, you 
... no good ... 56-ing--</speak>

<info>Bender squeals. Roberto jabs at his with the knife and Bender 
extends his head on a cable, dodging the knife.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Don't kill me yet! I'm starting to come 
down with Stockholm syndrome ... handsome!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Halt, fellow robot!</speak>

<info>He stands up from behind the couch.</info>

<speak who="ROBERTO">
Hey, Red. You're just in time to join 
the hostage situation. Which side you 
wanna be on?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
The side that kicks your twisted, metal 
ass!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Fry! Stay back. He's too powerful.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Negative, bossy meat creature. I know 
now what my primary function is: I am 
a battle-droid. Sworn to protect the 
weak from crazy robots.</speak>

<speak who="ROBERTO">
I'm not crazy! Don't call me crazy! 
I'm just not user-friendly!</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
Fry! Don't be a hero! It's not covered 
by the health plan!</speak>

<speak who="ROBERTO">
Let's see how much of a robot you really 
are!</speak>

<info>He runs at Fry and stabs him in the chest. Everyone gasps. Fry 
doesn't react. Roberto pulls the knife out and doesn't see the 
tin of oil that is still in Fry's pocket. The oil starts to leak 
through his jacket.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
No knife can penetrate my skin-tanium 
armour.</speak>

<info>He starts walking towards Roberto, spinning his arms and making 
a mechanical noise. Roberto backs away.</info>

<speak who="ROBERTO">
Help! Help! He is a battle-droid! Somebody 
help me! Mommy! I'm sorry I spilled 
the transmission fluid, Mommy! No! No! 
Don't weld me to the wall, Mommy!</speak>

<info>He throws the knife at Fry and it slices open his arm. Fry doesn't 
notice and keeps walking towards him. He screams and jumps through 
the window.</info>

<info>Cut to: Outside Planet Express. Roberto falls and lands in the 
road. His left eye and right arm are broken. He whimpers and 
collapses.</info>

<speak who="SMITTY">
<info>(on megaphone)</info> We're willing to listen 
to your demands.</speak>

<info>He starts to put the receiver back into URL's body.</info>

<speak who="URL">
Hey, baby. Wash that off before you 
put it back.</speak>

<info>Cut to: Planet Express: Lounge.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
Who's brave now?</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
Hooray!</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Bravo!</speak>

<info>Fry starts to untie them.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
You did it, Fry.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Congratulations, buddy. You're a credit 
to my race.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
<info>(mechanical voice)</info> It was nothing. I-- 
<info>(normal)</info> Blood? Robots don't have blood. 
I must be a, a--</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
A squid?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
A human! Oh, my God! I'm a human!</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Also good.</speak>

<info>Time Lapse. The police cars clear away. Zoidberg cuts a bandage 
that he has wrapped around Fry's wound.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Thanks for saving us, Fry.</speak>

<info>She kisses him on the cheek.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
I'm gonna continue never washing this 
cheek again.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Buddy, you may be wrapped in greasy 
skin, but inside, you've got the heart 
of a robot.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Aw. Thanks, Bender.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Just like inside me, I've got the heart 
of a human.  What?</speak>
