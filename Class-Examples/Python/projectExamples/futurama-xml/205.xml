               (talking) It's gonna be many a year before someone flushes another

                         That was a disgusting story.

                         And it's all thanks to Bender. I love 
                         you, Bender.

                         I love you too.  Get that stupid chip 
                         out of me before I kill myself!

                         Bender, you won't believe this, but 
                         the empathy chip burned out. The emotion 
                         you felt for Nibbler was actually your 
                         own.

                         Looks like Bender learned an important 
                         lesson about respecting other people's 
                         feelings afterall.

                         No, I'm wrong. The empathy chip was 
                         running at triple capacity.

                         And I still barely felt anything. Goodnight, 
                         losers!

                         You know, Bender may not have learned 
                         anything from me, but I think I actually 
                         learned something from him.  (shouting) 
                         So long, jerkwads!
