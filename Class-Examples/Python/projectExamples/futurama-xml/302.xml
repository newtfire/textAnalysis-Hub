                         It's shameful, I agree. In the olden 
                         days, I proudly fought alongside female 
                         troops, shoulder to, uh, shoulder. Alas, 
                         after a series of deadly blunders caused 
                         by distracting low-cut fatigues and 
                         lots of harmless pinching, the army 
                         decided women weren't fit for service. 
                         Not when I'm in charge.

                         The elders tell of a young ball much 
                         like you. He bounced three metres in 
                         the air. Then he bounced 1.8 metres 
                         in the air. Then he bounced four metres 
                         in the air. Do I make myself clear?
