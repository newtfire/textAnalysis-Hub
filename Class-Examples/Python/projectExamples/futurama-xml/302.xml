<info>7^11. Bender looks in the beer fridges while Fry looks at the 
gum and candy rack.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Hm, Spider, Hubble, Nitrogum...ooh, 
Big Pink! It's the only gum with the 
breath-freshening power of ham.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
And it pinkens your teeth while you 
chew.</speak>

<info>The till clerk is dressed in a perspex box and is serving a 
sergeant at the till.</info>

<speak who="CLERK">
Alright, sergeant, $100 worth of pixie 
stix and porno mags with your 5% military 
discount comes to $95.  That'll be 40 
cents.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
I believe you're forgetting about our 
5% military discount.</speak>

<speak who="CLERK">
Well that's only for people in the military.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
What?! This is the worst kind of discrimination. 
The kind against me!</speak>

<speak who="CLERK">
Alright, look. Our policy is, if for 
any reason you're not completely satisfied, 
I hate you.</speak>

<info>He presses a button and a conveyor belt takes Fry and Bender 
through the doors onto the street.</info>

<info>Cut to: Outside 7^11. Bender's head falls off and rolls into 
the gutter.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
OK, now I'm mad.</speak>

<info>He screws it back on.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Full price for gum? That dog won't hunt, 
Monsignor.</speak>

<info>Earth Army Recruiting Center. Over the decades, army recruitment 
poster have changed. The one hanging outside the building has 
the caption "Join The Army. What Are You, Chicken? Buk Buk Buk". 
Inside, there is a line of people waiting to sign up. Hanging 
on the wall is a banner showing the Earth Army's employee of 
the month - in a coffin witht he Earth flag draped over it.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Hello. We're here because we...uh...love 
our planet!</speak>

<info>He and Fry chuckle. The man pushes their papers towards them.</info>

<speak who="MAN">
Sign here on the dotted line, patriots. 
Then I'll give you your discount cards.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Just out of curiosity, we could use 
the cards to buy gum, then immediately 
quit the army, right?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
You know, playing you all for chumps?</speak>

<speak who="MAN">
Correct. There's no obligation.  Unless, 
of course, war were declared.</speak>

<info>A siren sounds and a red light flashes.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
What's that?</speak>

<speak who="MAN">
War were declared.</speak>

<info>South Street Spaceport. Kif and Zapp check off the new recruits 
as they board the Nimbus. Leela, Hermes, Amy and Farnsworth follow 
Bender and Fry as they carry their bags towards the ship.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Now be careful, Fry. And if you kill 
anyone, make sure to eat their heart, 
to gain their courage. Their rich, tasty 
courage.</speak>

<info>He licks his lips.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
I don't want you to worry about your 
jobs while you're away. That's why I'm 
firing you now.</speak>

<info>He hands them their pink slips then turns away and starts to 
cry.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
I wanna enlist. My friends always die 
if I'm not there to save them.</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Sorry, but the army's instituted a men-only 
policy.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
What?!</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
It's shameful, I agree. In the olden 
days, I proudly fought alongside female 
troops, shoulder to, uh, shoulder. Alas, 
after a series of deadly blunders caused 
by distracting low-cut fatigues and 
lots of harmless pinching, the army 
decided women weren't fit for service. 
Not when I'm in charge.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
You know, Zapp, someone ought to teach 
you a lesson.</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
If it's a lesson in love, watch out. 
I suffer from a very sexy learning disability. 
What do I call it, Kif?</speak>

<info>Kif sighs.</info>

<speak who="KIF">
Sex-lexia.</speak>

<info>Time Lapse. The last soldiers board the ship, the boarding gangways 
are removed and the ship takes off.</info>

<info>Nimbus Briefing Room. Zapp stands on a platform before the troops. 
The Earth flag hangs behind him.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Men, you're lucky men. Soon you'll all 
be fighting for your planet. Many of 
you will be dying for your planet. A 
few of you will be forced through a 
fine mesh screen for your planet. They 
will be the luckiest of all.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Great, we're gonna die.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
And this ham gum is all bone.</speak>

<info>He spits it out.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Now to present the logistics of our 
mission, the Commander-in-Chief. Please 
welcome the original Gerber Baby, Earth 
President Richard M. Nixon.</speak>

<info>Kif sits Nixon's head in a jar on a stool.</info>

<speak who="NIXON">
This is the brass ring, fellas......planet 
Spheron 1!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Cool effect!</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
It's a desolate, ugly little planet 
with absolutely no natural resources 
or strategic value. Questions?</speak>

<speak who="SOLDIER #1">
Why is this godforsaken planet worth 
dying for?</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Don't ask me, you're the one who's going 
to be dying.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Uh, just so we'll know, who's the enemy?</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
A valid question.  We know nothing about 
their language, their history or what 
they look like. But we can assume this: 
They stand for everything we don't stand 
for. Also, they told me you guys look 
like dorks.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
They look like dorks!</speak>

<info>He starts waving his fists around and Fry has to hold him back.</info>

<info>Nimbus Training Room. Zapp, Kif and Nixon watch the soldiers 
training on gym equipment.</info>

<info>Time Lapse. The soldiers drop a little water onto some green 
blobs and they inflate into tents. Fry swallows his and downs 
a glass of water. The tent inflates in his mouth and he mumbles.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
What's the matter, private? Tent got 
your tongue? <info>(chuckling)</info> Tent got your... 
<info>(talking)</info> Kif, write that down and send 
it to Humour In Uniform.</speak>

<info>Time Lapse. The soldiers learn to assemble their guns. Bender 
quickly does his but attaches his arm to it as well. He sighs.</info>

<info>Time Lapse. Fry puts on a helmet that obscures his vision and 
holds a lightsaber. Kif releases a probe and it buzzes around 
Fry. Fry swings for it, misses a few times and chops it in half. 
Sweets fall out of it and the other soldiers scoop them up off 
the floor and eat them. Fry looks around in confusion.</info>

<info>Time Lapse. An exhausted Fry and Bender sit out the obstacle 
course. The soldiers run past them, through the tyres, through 
the tunnels, under the barbed wire and through the ring of fire. 
Another soldier breaks away from the group and runs past Fry 
and Bender.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Whoa! Check out that guy. He makes Speedy 
Gonzales look like Regular Gonzales.</speak>

<info>The soldier passes the finish line and Kif stops the stopwatch.</info>

<speak who="KIF">
That new recruit is phenomenal, sir.</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Yes. He edged out my old mark by two 
seconds......and 16 minutes...and 12 
hours. I do plan to finish someday, 
Kif. Good hustle, soldier.</speak>

<info>He pats the soldier's bum and he turns around and slaps Zapp. 
The soldier has purple hair, a purple beard and wears a visor 
across his eyes. Shock, horror, it's actually Leela. Not that 
Zapp notices.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
<info>(disguised, deeper voice)</info> Uh, sorry, 
sir. I was still in attack mode. You 
know how testosterone is.</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
As a bubbling Crock-Pot of male hormones, 
I sure do. What's your name, private?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
<info>(disguised, deeper voice)</info> Lee --  ..la...man. 
La Man...Lemon! Lee Lemon, sir.</speak>

<info>She salutes.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Lemon, you're a man's man. You're a 
man's man's man. More importantly, your 
hand, while firm and masculine, is soft 
as a velvet child. What lotion do you 
use?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
<info>(disguised, deeper voice)</info> Pert and Popular, 
sir.</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Roger that. Kif, get me ten cases of 
Pert and Popular.</speak>

<speak who="KIF">
What shall I do with your Jergens, sir?</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Squirt it on some homeless man with 
dry elbows.  Private Lee Lemon may well 
be the finest recruit I've seen in all 
my years of service. That young man 
fills me with hope and some other emotions 
that are weird and deeply confusing 
to me.</speak>

<speak who="KIF">
Ew.</speak>

<info>Nimbus Mess Hall. Zapp watches the soldier through some binoculars. 
He looks at Leela, sitting at a table alone and zooms in.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
<info>(sexfully)</info> Hello!</speak>

<info>Nixon is sat with Zapp at the table. Kif pours some wine into 
Zapp's glass and then pours some into Nixon's jar. He slurps 
it.</info>

<speak who="NIXON">
Mmm. Now that's a nice rosï¿½. So, anyway, 
we open up the panda crate, wouldn't 
you know it, the damn thing's dead! 
Up-chucked it's bamboo. True story.</speak>

<info>Zapp isn't paying attention and is still looking through the 
binoculars.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Uh-huh, uh-huh. That's whatever you 
were talking about for you.</speak>

<info>Fry, Bender, soldier #1 and a hick carry their trays to Leela's 
table.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Mind if we sit with you?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
<info>(disguised, deeper voice)</info> Uh, hey, why 
the hell would I? We're all guys here. 
Sweaty, hairy, gassy guys.</speak>

<info>They sit down.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Good point...I guess.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
You're my kind of soldier, Lemon. A 
foul-mouthed, barrel-chested, beer-bellied 
pile of ugly muscle.</speak>

<speak who="HICK">
So. Any you fellas got a special lady 
back home?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Well, I sort of a have a thing for this 
girl I work with.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Really? <info>(disguised, deeper voice)</info> What 
type is she? You know, blonde, or Chinese, 
or cyclops?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Cyclops.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
<info>(disguised, deeper voice)</info> Aw, she sounds 
sweet.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
But sweet girls aren't for you, eh? 
You hard-fighting, hard-farting, ugly, 
ugly son of a --</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
<info>(disguised, deeper voice)</info> Stop! Stop 
flattering me!</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
<info>(shouting)</info> Ten hut!  Well, well, well. 
If it isn't Lee Lemon. The flaming star 
of Brannigan's Rough Rangers. Say, uh, 
Lemon, do you like to read? I just got 
a great book on tape. It's about life 
in ancient Greece and --</speak>

<info>The alarm sounds and everyone runs off.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
<info>(disguised, deeper voice)</info> Sir, the alarm. 
I think I'd better --</speak>

<info>Zapp puts his finger to her mouth.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Shh. Don't talk. Just go.</speak>

<info>The Nimbus goes into orbit around Spheron 1.</info>

<info>Nimbus Briefing Room. The soldiers are in full battle uniform 
and holding their guns.</info>

<speak who="NIXON">
We are now in position above Spheron 
1. This is the moment we were training 
for all yesterday afternoon.</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
And now for the battle plan. As you 
all know, the key to victory is the 
element of surprise. Surprise!</speak>

<info>He presses a big red button and the floor beneath the soldier 
opens up.</info>

<info>Cut to: Spheron One Surface. The Nimbus is a few metres off 
the ground. The soldiers land in a heap on the ground. The floor 
closes up again.</info>

<info>Time Lapse. The soldiers stand alone on the vast planet surface. 
The ground is quite rocky and the sky is green.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
It's creepy here.</speak>

<speak who="SOLDIER #1">
This is the worst part. The calm before 
the battle.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
And then the battle's not so bad?</speak>

<speak who="SOLDIER #1">
Oh, right. I forgot about the battle.</speak>

<info>He whimpers. The ground begins to shake and there is a loud 
banging sound.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
What's happening?</speak>

<speak who="HICK">
Holy shoot! Looky!</speak>

<info>Thousands of pink balls bounce towards them.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
The enemy! They're balls!</speak>

<info>The balls knock several troops over. Other soldiers blast them 
with their guns and they deflate like burst balloons. Fry's gun 
splurts out red bursts that go nowhere.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Charge your gun, Fry.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Oh, right.</speak>

<info>He winds a handle on the side of his gun and it plays Pop Goes 
The Weasel as it charges. A red pulse blasts out of the gun and 
a horse neighs. Zapp is sat on the horse which is standing on 
a hovering platform. Zapp is carrying a sword.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Watch where you're shooting, private. 
You spooked Felicity.  There, there, 
boy.</speak>

<info>More balls knock over more soldiers. Eight of them gang up on 
soldier #1 and he groans in pain. Leela kicks them away and soldier 
#1 quivers on the ground. He holds up a watch to Bender.</info>

<speak who="SOLDIER #1">
<info>(hoarse)</info> Give this to my son.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
You got it!</speak>

<speak who="SOLDIER #1">
<info>(hoarse)</info> Wait. I didn't tell you where 
he lives.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Hey, I think your son might also like 
those boots.</speak>

<info>Time Lapse. The battle rages on. The soldiers charge their guns 
and Pop Goes The Weasel plays over and over.</info>

<speak who="HICK">
Cover us, buddy. You've got the only 
wounded-up positron shooter.  Fry, you 
emu-bellied coward!</speak>

<info>The balls knock over him, Bender and Leela. Four balls line 
up behind a bomb. Another ball pushes the first four balls and, 
like a Newton's Cradle, the bomb is pushed away. It rolls past 
Fry and stops between Leela, Bender and the hick. They scream 
and the fuse burns away. Bender crawls towards it.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
<info>(shouting)</info> Bender! No!</speak>

<info>Bender opens his chest cabinet.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
If they put me on a stamp, tell them 
to use the young Bender.</speak>

<info>He covers the bomb, it explodes and his chassis expands.</info>

<info>DOOP Camp. The M*A*S*H theme tune plays. A helicopter lands 
on a helipad.</info>

<speak who="P.A. ANNOUNCER">
<info>(on tannoy)</info> Incoming wounded. All operating 
personnel report to tent four, repeat, 
four. I mean five! Repeat, four.</speak>

<info>Two medics carry soldier #1 from the helicopter on a stretcher.</info>

<info>Tent Four. Fry watches through the window. A jellyfish woman, 
from the race from A Flight To Remember and The Lesser Of Two 
Evils is a nurse.</info>

<speak who="NURSE">
Are you ready to operate, doctor?</speak>

<info>The doctor washes his claws. Claws? It's Zoidberg!</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
I'd love to, but first I have to perform 
surgery.  I kid, I kid!</speak>

<info>The nurse puts some gloves on his claws and they break.</info>

<info>Time Lapse. A human doctor operates on a mule, a robot doctor 
operates on soldier #1 while Zoidberg operates on the hick.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Scalpel.  Blood bucket.  Priest. Next 
patient.</speak>

<info>The robot doctor, iHawk, has a martini permanently attached 
to his left hand.</info>

<speak who="IHAWK">
Gee, Zoidberg. Leave some for the enemy 
to kill.</speak>

<speak who="NURSE">
Leave Dr. Zoidberg alone. He has twice 
the training you do.</speak>

<speak who="IHAWK">
Yeah, he's a doctor and a butcher!</speak>

<info>He laughs and soldier #1 joins in. Zoidberg groans.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
See, this is how it starts. First with 
he jokes, then comes the heavy stuff.</speak>

<info>iHawk laughs then turns a switch on his body from "irreverent" 
to "maudlin".</info>

<speak who="IHAWK">
When will the killing end?</speak>

<info>Cut to: Outside Tent 4. Fry is still outside. Zapp arrives, 
still on his horse. Kif is standing beside the horse.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Look at this sissy, Kif. While others 
were fighting and dying pointlessly, 
he was hiding in a hole, wallowing in 
a pool of his own cowardice.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
That wasn't cowardice.</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
I'm depromoting you, soldier. Kif, what's 
the most humiliating job there is?</speak>

<speak who="KIF">
Being your assistant.</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Wrong! Being your assistant! Private 
Fry, you will henceforth serve as Kif's 
assistant.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
That doesn't sound too bad.</speak>

<speak who="KIF">
<info>(uncharacteristically nasty)</info> You speak 
when I tell you to, you filthy worm!</speak>

<info>Tent Four.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
I'm afraid he's gone.</speak>

<info>He pulls the sheet over the hick.</info>

<speak who="HICK">
Whoa, doc, I ain't dead.</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Excuse me, I believe I'm the doctor.</speak>

<speak who="IHAWK">
Believe it all you want, that won't 
make it true.  <info>(mauldlin)</info> This isn't 
a war, it's a murder.  <info>(irreverent)</info> 
This isn't a war, it's a moider!</speak>

<info>The nurse wheels Bender in. His chassis is still mis-shapen 
from the explosion.</info>

<speak who="HICK">
Bender, old buddy. Hang in there.</speak>

<info>The nurse hooks Bender up to a beer drip and he groans. Zapp 
walks in with Nixon's head.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Here lies the bravest soldier I've seen 
since my mirror got grease on it. I 
hereby order that in Bender's honour, 
he be melted down and made into a statue 
of himself.</speak>

<speak who="NIXON">
Slow down there, Starsky, I'm up to 
something here. I want this robot fixed. 
Fixed like Kennedy fixed the 1960 election. 
Damn bean-eating war hero!</speak>

<speak who="NURSE">
Are you read to operate, doctor?</speak>

<speak who="IHAWK">
I'd love to, but first I have to perform 
surgery.</speak>

<info>He laughs.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
That's my joke! I'll kill you!</speak>

<info>He jumps at iHawk and clacks his claws.</info>

<info>Officers' Club. Zapp sits with Nixon and drinks a scotch as 
the battle continues outside.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Ah! Pre-war scotch!  Welcome, Lieutenant 
Bender. You're looking sharp.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
I got wheels! With clickety-clack-ers.</speak>

<info>Kif brings Zapp another scotch.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Damnit, Kif, where's the little umbrella? 
That's what makes it a scotch-on-the-rocks!</speak>

<speak who="KIF">
Actually, sir --</speak>

<info>He groans as Zapp plants the glass firmly in the middle of his 
forehead.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Make me a new one.</speak>

<info>Kif signs and walks back to the bar where Fry is cleaning glasses 
with a cloth.</info>

<speak who="KIF">
Use a brush, you dunderhead! And mix 
these mixed nuts. I see two almonds 
touching!</speak>

<info>Back at Zapp's table...</info>

<speak who="NIXON">
Now, listen here, Bender. This war is 
in danger of going all quagmire on me. 
So I'm sending you on one last mission.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Hot diggidy daffodil!</speak>

<speak who="NIXON">
A mission of peace.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
<info>(disappointed)</info> Oh!</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
You'll be negotiating with the aliens' 
mysterious leaders, the Brain Balls. 
They've got a lot of brains and they've 
got a lot of cutzpa!</speak>

<speak who="NIXON">
Accompanying you will be our top peace 
negotiator, Henry Kissenger.</speak>

<info>Kif wheels in Kissenger's head in a jar.</info>

<speak who="KISSENGER">
How are you?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Is he any good?</speak>

<speak who="NIXON">
Looking like that, he talked his way 
into Jill St. John's bed. Nuff said!</speak>

<info>Helicopter. Bender and Nixon's helicopter lifts off and flies 
away.</info>

<info>Shower Block.</info>

<speak who="NIXON">
<info>(singing)</info> I'm so dizzy, my head is spinning. 
Like a whirlpool it never ends.</speak>

<info>Kif scrubs Zapp's back with a brush.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
A little lower. Lower. Lower. A lot 
lower. Too low...! Lower!</speak>

<info>Kif sighs. Fry sings and scrubs Kif's back.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
<info>(singing)</info> I'm walking on sunshine, whoa-oh.</speak>

<info>He hums. Leela walks in wearing a bathrobe and her Lee Lemon 
hat and visor and gasps. She turns to go.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Private Lemon, no need to leave.  My 
stall just became free.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
<info>(disguised, deeper voice)</info> Maybe you 
should put on a towel, sir.</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Right. Right!  I'm about to try the 
new lotion you recommended. <info>(sexfully)</info> 
If I should accidentally put too much 
on my hands, perhaps I could rub it 
onto you.</speak>

<info>Leela gags. Kif carries Nixon's jar.</info>

<speak who="NIXON">
Brannigan!</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Hm?</speak>

<speak who="NIXON">
My God, cover yourself. I didn't live 
a thousand years and travel a quadrillion 
miles to look at another man's gizmo.</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Uh, sorry, Mr. President, I didn't realise. 
Kif, raise him up about nipple-high.</speak>

<info>Behind them, Leela showers with her back turned.</info>

<speak who="NIXON">
Come on, Brannigan. Stuff yourself into 
a uniform. We've gotta get off this 
planet before the bomb goes off.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
<info>(disguised, deeper voice)</info> Bomb?! What 
bomb?</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
The one we had the doctors implant in 
that gullible Bender robot.</speak>

<info>Fry gasps. Zapp's horse kicks the shower stalls and Leela runs 
out and wraps a towel around herself. Zapp looks her up and down 
and purrs.</info>

<speak who="NIXON">
Zapp. Zapp!</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Hm?</speak>

<speak who="NIXON">
Inspect the troops later. It's time 
to activate the bomb.</speak>

<info>Zapp takes a remote control out of his uniform pocket and presses 
a button.</info>

<info>Brain Ball Headquarters. Bender and Kissenger are sat around 
a table with three Balls.</info>

<speak who="KISSENGER">
Now, as for economic cooperation --</speak>

<info>The bomb inside Bender beeps and his antenna flashes.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Whoa! Scuse me.</speak>

<info>He bangs his chest and the bomb starts to tick.</info>

<info>DOOP Camp.</info>
    
<speak who="P.A. ANNOUNCER">
<info>(on tannoy)</info> Attention: All personnel 
evacuate the planet immediately. And 
not just because it's meat loaf night.</speak>

<info>Zapp is sat on his horse and Kif is sat on his mule, holding 
Nixon's jar.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Come along, Lemon before this whole 
dump blows up.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
<info>(disguised, deeper voice)</info> Uh, commander? 
Could you tell me when the bomb is exploding?</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Of course, my significant soldier. The 
bomb is voice activated. It will detonate 
the instant the robot unwittingly speaks 
a certain word.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
What's the word...uh...sir?</speak>

<info>He salutes.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
It's the one word the robot uses more 
than any other. We got it from this 
convenient database of his 10 most frequently-used 
words.  Number 10, chump; number nine, 
chumpette; number eight, yours; number 
seven, up; number six, pimpmobile; number 
five, bite; number four, my......number 
three, shiny; number two, daffodil. 
And Bender's number one most frequently 
uttered word, the word which, if uttered, 
will blow up this entire planet: Ass.</speak>

<info>Fry gasps.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
We don't have long!</speak>

<info>Brain Ball Headquarters.</info>

<speak who="BRAIN BALL #1">
We demand bouncing, followed by rolling, 
followed by rolling of the third type.</speak>

<speak who="KISSENGER">
Say what?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
My chair's too hard. It's a real pain 
in the...uh, whattya call it? Lower 
back! Yeah, that whole region.</speak>

<info>DOOP Camp. Soldiers board helicopters and they take-off towards 
the Nimbus. Fry crouches behind some barrels until most of the 
helicopters are gone.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
OK, I gotta break down that gate, beat 
up those three guards, steal that chopper 
and rescue Bender.  Hey, I did it! Wait, 
that's not me.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
<info>(shouting)</info> Come on. We gotta save Bender.</speak>

<info>She climbs onto the helicopter.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
You wanna save him too, Lemon? You barely 
know him.</speak>

<info>Leela pulls him onto the helicopter.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Fry, don't you recognise me?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Hermes?</speak>

<info>Zapp arrives.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Lee? When will I see you again?  The 
two of you are good friends? But I thought 
we would be good friends. <info>(contemptuous)</info> 
Well, let's see how friendly you get 
when you're sharing a prison cell!</speak>

<info>He holds up some handcuffs. Leela punches him in the stomach, 
smacks him about the face and kicks him to the ground.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Hey, Zapp!</speak>

<info>Zapp groans. Leela pulls of her helmet and fake beard.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Leela!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Leela!</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
So it's you I've been attracted to! 
Oh, God, I've never been so happy to 
be beaten up by a woman.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Let's do it again sometime.</speak>

<info>She closes the door and takes off.</info>

<info>Brain Ball Headquarters.</info>

<speak who="BRAIN BALL #2">
The elders tell of a young ball much 
like you. He bounced three metres in 
the air. Then he bounced 1.8 metres 
in the air. Then he bounced four metres 
in the air. Do I make myself clear?</speak>

<speak who="KISSENGER">
Mr. Ambassador, our people tell the 
same story. Oy.</speak>

<info>Bender paces around shaking his fists.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
These balls are making me testy. If 
they don't stop bouncing and jiggling, 
I swear I'm gonna shove this treaty 
up their -- Wait a second. Where do 
you shove things up a ball?</speak>

<speak who="KISSENGER">
This isn't a productive area of discussion.</speak>

<info>Helicopter. The helicopter closes in on the Brain Ball HQ, and 
hundreds of balls bounce underneath.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
We're here. I followed the bouncing 
balls.  I'll keep the chopper at a safe 
altitude while you parachute down.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
OK, my best friend's life is at stake. 
I can finally prove that I'm not a coward. 
Will you push me?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
<info>(shouting)</info> I already did!</speak>

<info>Cut to: Outside Brain Ball Headquarters. Fry falls.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
<info>(shouting)</info> Thank you!  At last, war 
has made me into a man.</speak>

<info>He cheers as he bounces towards the building.</info>

<info>Cut to: Brain Ball Headquarters.</info>

<speak who="KISSENGER">
Please, gentlemen. We must put an end 
to the bloodshed. We have all seen too 
many body bags and ball sacks.</speak>

<speak who="BRAIN BALL #1">
We cannot condone bouncing of the seventh 
variety.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Enough of this crap! I'm catching the 
next pimpmobile outta here! But before 
I go I have one thing to say.  Bite 
my shiny metal --</speak>

<info>Enter Fry on his ball.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Stop! You can't say the next word.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Up yours, chump, I said it 906 times 
before lunch.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Bender, if you say the A-word and you'll 
blow this planet straight to the H-word!</speak>

<info>He opens Bender's chest door, revealing the armed bomb. They 
gasp.</info>

<speak who="KISSENGER">
Young man, you have the bravery of a 
hero and breath as fresh as a summer 
ham.  What? What is funny?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Bender's got the upper hand now.  The 
name of the game is "Make Bender Happy 
Or He Blows Up The Planet".  I'd rather 
die and take everybody with me than 
sit here one more minute listening to 
these idiots talk about bouncing!</speak>

<speak who="BRAIN BALL #1">
Please, stay calm. There's no need to 
bounce of the handle.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
That's it, I'm saying it! A is for --</speak>

<speak who="BRAIN BALL #1">
Wait, stop! We give in to all of Earth's 
demands. The war is over. Our home planet 
is yours.</speak>

<info>Bender laughs.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
All right! Hey. Wait a minute! This 
is your home planet? We're the evil, 
invading aliens?</speak>

<speak who="BRAIN BALL #2">
Correct.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Then I guess you learned a valuable 
lesson: Don't mess with Earth.</speak>

<speak who="BRAIN BALL #1">
May you bounce in peace.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Get the hell off my planet.</speak>

<info>Cut to: Outside Brain Ball Headquarters. The balls on the surface 
bounce and fly off the surface and away from the planet.</info>

<info>Newspaper Headline: "War Over! Balls Thoroughly Licked!" There 
is a picture of a bruished Zapp giving the thumbs up.</info>

<info>Planet Express: Farnsworth's Lab. Bender lies on a table and 
Farnsworth welds something in his chest cabinet. The other staff 
gather around watching.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Well, that's it. Let's reactivate him. 
<info>(shouting)</info> Wake up!</speak>

<info>He slaps Bender. Bender yawns and sits up.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Hey, chumps and chumpettes. Did you 
get the bomb out? Can I go back to saying 
the word I love to say?</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
I'm sorry but we couldn't remove it.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
It's stuck in there with glue or something. 
I don't know.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
<info>(ironic)</info> Well, this is just great! What's 
the point of living if I can't say "ass"? 
Hey, I didn't blow up! Ass, ass, ass, 
ass, ass! Alright! I'm back in the saddle!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
We couldn't disarm the bomb so we reset 
the word that triggers it.</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
It's from the list of words you almost 
never say.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
That's using your ass. So, what's the 
word?</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
We think it's better if you don't know.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Oh, come on. I'm not gonna say it. Please? 
Oh, is it "please"?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
No.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Hm, words I never say. Oh, I know! "Thanks"!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Bender, stop trying to destroy the world.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Is it "sorry"? 
No. "Funderful"? Uh, "nonalcoholic"?</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
Quit it!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Bender!</speak>

Stop it, mon!</speak>
