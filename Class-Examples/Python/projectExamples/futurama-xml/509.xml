<info>Planet Express: Hangar. Bender and Fry prepare for a game of 
Virtual Golf. Bender is all kitted out in golf gear. He takes 
his club from Fry and puts the ball on the tee.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
A hush comes over the crowd. The only 
sound is Bender calling everyone else 
a jerk and he swings!  And he slices 
it into the water, oh man!</speak>

<info>He plugs himself into the game and appears on the screen. He 
jumps into the lake. Enter Hermes and Farnsworth.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Bad news everyone. You're not good enough 
to go on your next mission.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Hooray!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Not good enough!</speak>

<info>They high-five. Leela descends from above in a harness.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Why? Says who?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Because. And says me. It's an extremely 
dangerous mission that killed my last 
crew. And you're not nearly as good 
as them.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Woohoo!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
We live to suck another day!</speak>

<info>They both do a happy dance. Leela disconnects Bender from the 
game.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
We're just as good as any of those crews 
you sent to their deaths. What's the 
mission?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Collecting honey. Ordinary honey.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
That doesn't sound so dangerous.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
This is no ordinary honey. It's produced 
by vicious space bees. A single sting 
of their hideous neuro-toxin can cause 
instant death!</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
And that's if you're not allergic! You 
don't wanna know what happens then, 
oh no no, God no!</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Your insides will boil out of your eye 
sockets like a science fair volcano!</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
I didn't want to know1</speak>

<info>He bursts into tears.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
These bees are larger than most Buicks 
and twice as ugly!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Larger than an American sedan?  How 
big is the honey comb?</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
Honey comb's big. Yeah yeah yeah.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
It's not small?</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
No no no.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
It'll take more than deadly deadly bees 
to keep us from doing our job. Come 
on boys!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
But Leela we're no good!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Listen, I'm scared too. But I'm more 
scared of disappointing myself.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
I'm not scared of that at all!</speak>

<info>She pushes him towards the ship.</info>

<info>Ship's Cockpit. The ship flies towards the space beehive and 
lands just inside. Swarms of bees fly past with their space pollen. 
Leela paints yellow and black stripes on Bender.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Now bees communicate by dancing.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Like my parents. Oh wait, that was hitting!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
So this language cartridge will let 
you distract them.</speak>

<info>She installs the cartridge into the slot in the back of Bender's 
head.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Ah good! I always have thoughts and 
feelings that can only be expressed 
through dance! <info>(in bee)</info> You stink! Bender's 
great! Deal with it!</speak>

<info>He laughs.</info>

<info>Beehive. Leela and Fry are wearing the red spacesuits and they 
make their way into the hive carrying a long hose. A bee flies 
in front of them and they gasp.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Bender quick! Waggle something!</speak>

<info>As Bender talks Fry and Leela make their escape.</info>

<speak who="BENDER"><info>(IN BEE)</info>
Hello fellow bees. How's the abdomen? 
Swollen with nectar I trust?</speak>

<speak who="BEE"><info>(IN BEE)</info>
Duh!</speak>

<info>Time Lapse. The crew get closer to the centre of the hive.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Leela let's turn back. There's absolutely 
no shame in wussing out.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Relax, everything'll be fine!</speak>

<info>They look up and see a ship caked in honey. It has a familiar 
logo on the tail.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Oh my God! The old Planet Express ship!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
There's the black box!</speak>

<info>She picks it up and plays it.</info>

<speak who="MAN"><info>ON TAPE</info>
Captain, the bees have us surrounded! 
Oh the Professor was right, we're not 
as good as his old crew!</speak>

<speak who="CAPTAIN"><info>ON TAPE</info>
Well I aim to prove him wrong! It'll 
take more than a few deadly deadly bees 
to -  Oh Lord!</speak>

<info>He screams some more and Leela switches the tape off.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Uh, couldn't make that out. Too much 
static!</speak>

<info>Fry and Bender aren't so sure.</info>

<info>Time Lapse. The crew crawl into part of the honey comb. It drips 
with honey.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Ew!</speak>

<info>They arrive at the end of the tunnel and gasp.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
We found it! The honey comb hideout!</speak>

<info>Time Lapse. Leela puts the hose into a river of honey and the 
hose sucks it up. Fry looks at something else.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Hey what's this goop?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Royal jelly. They feed it to the queen.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Bees make honey and jelly? Huh. How 
come nothing humans make taste good? 
Help! I can't swim in jelly as far 
as I know!</speak>

<info>Leela pulls him out.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Look!  It's a baby queen! Aww she's 
so cute! You adorable wittle itty bitty 
fuzzy wuzzy -</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Leela! Stop bonding and lets go! I got 
jelly in my underpants!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
I'm taking this bee with us. With queen 
we can build a hive and make more honey 
ourselves. Let me just pack her a lunch 
and we'll go.</speak>

<info>She dips a jar into the jelly.</info>

<speak who="BENDER"><info>(IN BEE)</info>
Pick up the pace lady! I'm sick of shaking 
my booty for these fat jerks!  I didn't 
mean you're all fat. Just fatso there.</speak>

<info>He points at a fat bee.</info>

<speak who="BEES"><info>(IN BEE)</info>
He insulted our fat queen!</speak>

<speak who="QUEEN"><info>(IN BEE)</info>
You try keeping your figure after 10,000 
kids!</speak>

<info>The bees dive at the crew. They duck. Bender runs away. The 
queen tries to sting him. Bender grabs a hold of her sting. She 
shakes him around.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
This is where we distinguish ourselves 
from the last crew. Activate emergency 
high speed self contained escape pack 
crisis response unit! Quick!</speak>

<info>She flies off with a jet pack. Fry turns his on but he is wearing 
it the wrong way and flies off upside down. The bees chase him 
and Leela. Fry hits the sides of the honey comb on the way through 
the tunnels and Bender hangs onto the queen's sting screaming. 
Leela dodges a bee and it hits the comb and explodes.

[Cut to: Outside Ship. Leela and Fry fly towards it.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Good luck Bender!</speak>

<info>They fly through the cargo bay hatch.</info>

<info>Cut to: Ship's Cargo Bay. Leela closes the hatch.</info>

<info>Cut to: Outside Ship. The ship tries to take off but the honey 
holds it down. The queen prepares her sting.</info>

<info>Cut to: Ship's Cargo Bay. Her sting comes through with Bender 
on the end.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
I'm back baby!</speak>

<info>Cut to: Outside Ship. The cargo bay hatch closes, the queen 
falls from the ship and they take off. The bees sting the ship 
and dent it. The ship speeds away from the hive, blowing the 
bees back.</info>

<info>Ship's Cockpit. Fry cheers and Leela puts the baby queen in 
a little pet basket.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
We made it! We're alive!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Burn on that old crew! The only things 
they did better than us were suck and 
die!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Leela we got lucky this time but you 
should be more careful. I don't want 
anything to happen to you.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Thanks, but I can look out for myself. 
Frankly I can smell danger a mile away.</speak>

<info>The bee unfolds it's sting.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Look out!  You want her you'll have 
to go through me.</speak>

<info>The bee goes through Fry and he and Leela fall to the floor. 
The bee writhes around on the floor, dying. Bender quickly throws 
it into the airlock and jettisons it. It floats away into space 
and a space truck hits it. Leela looks where the sting hit her.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
You call that a wound? That's a boo 
boo top! But thanks for trying to save 
me Fry! Fry?  He's...he's dead.</speak>

<info>She and Bender kneel beside him.</info>

<speak who="BENDER"><info>(CRYING)</info>
Who will make Bender waffles just the 
way he likes them now?</speak>

<info>Orbitting Meadows National Cemetery. Fry's funeral has begun. 
He is in an open casket. Mourners that include Leo and Inez Wong 
and two Trisolians pay their respects to him. Leela cries.</info>

<speak who="LEELA"><info>(CRYING)</info>
It was all my fault! He died because 
of me!</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
No no no no no no no.  I'm lying to 
make her feel better.</speak>

<info>Leela cries more.</info>

<info>Time Lapse. Hermes and LaBarbara pay their respects to Fry. 
Hermes puts piece of burning paper on the coffin.</info>

<speak who="LABARBARA">
Husband, can't you go anywhere without 
lighting something up?</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
It's an old Jamaican accounting tradition. 
We burn his timecard. That way his zombie 
doesn't come back looking for his final 
paycheque.</speak>

<info>They leave and Amy and Zoidberg stand beside Fry.</info>

<speak who="AMY">
He looks so natural. It's funny to think 
he's clammed full of sawdust and preservatives.</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
I only wish I could have removed the 
stinger.</speak>

<info>They look at Fry's body, the huge sting sticks out of him.</info>

<info>Time Lapse. Father Changstein el Gamahl of the First Amalgamated 
Church begins the eulogy.</info>

<speak who="PRIEST">
I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman 
I have no problem telling his most intimate 
friends all about him.</speak>

<info>The congregation cries.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
Soothe us with sweet lies.</speak>

<speak who="PRIEST">
It may comfort you to know that Fry's 
death took only 15 seconds. Yet the 
pain was so intense that it felt to 
him like 15 years. And it goes without 
saying that it caused him to empty his 
bowels.  We now commend Fry's body to 
the ages.</speak>

<info>The coffin turns around and is ejected into space. Scruffy plays 
Walking On Sunshine on the bagpipes.</info>

<speak who="AMY">
He's walking on sunshine now.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
This makes me the oldest member of my 
family.</speak>

<info>He cries and hugs Bender.</info>

<speak who="AMAZONIAN">
Him do good snu-snu.</speak>

<info>Behind her the radiator from the Miss Universe pageant, Petunia, 
the girl from The Hip Joint, Morgan Proctor and Michelle aren't 
so sure.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
All those times I said "Kill all humans" 
I'd always whisper "except one." And 
Fry was that one. And I never told him 
so.</speak>

<info>He cries and hugs Farnsworth. Terry does his swooshy coat thing.</info>

<speak who="TERRY"><info>(DRAMATICALLY)</info>
Farewell from the world of tomorrow!</speak>

<info>Leela's Bedroom. She tickles Nibbler and wipes her eye with 
half a hanky. She puts the other half on her bedside table and 
sees the jar of honey.</info>

<speak who="LEELA"><info>(CRYING)</info>
They say a spoonful of space honey helps 
ease the pain.  It's good.  I feel funny. 
Haha funny!</speak>

<info>She laughs and then faints.</info>

<info>Leela's Dream. Leela floats towards Fry's coffin and it opens.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Leela?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Fry? I thought you were dead.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Nope, I'm better than ever. Before the 
accident I couldn't do this!</speak>

<info>He sticks his hand through the sting wound.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Impressive! But it does sorta support 
my You-Are-Dead theory.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Then I'll prove I'm alive! By telling 
you something only I could know. There's 
a surprise for you in my locker. I got 
it at a Swedish novelty shop before 
we left.</speak>

<info>Behind him his locker appears. He opens the door and pulls out 
a gift-wrapped box and hands it to Leela. She gasps.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
It's too beautiful to open! Can I open 
it?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Sure. There's just one thing I want 
you to.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
What?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
I want you to wake up.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Wake up? But I'm not -</speak>

<info>Cut to: Leela's Bedroom. She wakes up. It's the middle of the 
night. Nibbler rolls of the bed.</info>

<info>Planet Express: Locker Area. The crew sans Bender are gathered 
around Fry's locker.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
In my dream Fry said he hid a gift for 
me in my locker. If it's true then he 
must still exist in some form.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Oh course he still exists. As a frozen 
corpse in outer space!  Oh, I made myself 
sad.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Well, here goes.</speak>

<info>She opens the locker. It is empty. The crew sigh.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Bupkiss!</speak>

<info>Enter Bender counting some cash and whistling.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Well, I feel better now. Pawning all 
the stuff in Fry's locker helped give 
me closure.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Was there anything in there that might 
have been a gift for me?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
No. Nothing. Not at all. No way Jos�! 
Here it is.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
You took this from Fry's locker?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Hey the guy's dead! There's no law against 
grave robbing!</speak>

<info>Leela opens the gift. It's a squeezy toy.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
That proves it. Fry is alive somewhere 
and he's reaching me in my dreams.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Bullpies!</speak>

<info>Planet Express: Farnsworth's Lab. He helps Leela onto a table.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Lay down here and we'll do some tests. 
If Fry is out there then Leela's brain 
could be acting as a five pound ouija 
board.</speak>

<info>Leela lies back on the table.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Is this some sort of brain scanner?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Some sort yes. In France it's called 
a "guillotine."</speak>

<info>He pulls a lever. Leela gasps and jumps out of the way, narrowly 
missing the blade.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Professor! Can't you examine my brain 
without removing it?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Yes. Easily.</speak>

<info>He scans her brain with a small scanner thing.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Hey, what if Fry wasn't actually dead 
when we buried him? Y'know like Julia 
Roberts?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Well I suppose there's a slim -  I don't 
believe it!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
What is it? Is Fry alive in some other 
dimension or something?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
No. According to this gizmometer, Fry 
is dead and nothing can bring him back! 
Remarkable.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
But, my dream. Your science can't unprove 
that! How could I have know the gift 
was in Fry's locker?</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
Easy! He told you about it before he 
died! And your grief roasted mind blocked 
it out.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Are you saying I'm going crazy?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
No no, no one's saying that! But I'm 
certainly thinking it loudly.</speak>

<info>Leela's Bedroom. She tosses and turns in her sleep.</info>

<info>Cut to: Leela's Dream. Back in space Fry appears to her like 
the Cheshire Cat, just his hair and mouth.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Hi Leela! I'm just gonna keep talking, 
even if you can't hear me. Blah blah 
blah, blah blah blah blah blah.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Shut up, I can hear you. The Professor 
says you're just a dream.</speak>

<info>Fry appears fully.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Oh yeah?  Could a dream take you dancing 
in an illusion garden?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Well yes, technically. It's still very 
sweet of you.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Then what if we shared a sleigh ride 
across the ice fields of Hiperia?</speak>

<info>The dream changes to an icy landscape. Fry and Leela are pulled 
along in a sleigh by a woolly mammoth. Fry hands Leela a mug 
and tears open a packet of cocoa.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Oh Fry you must be alive! I've never 
been treated so romantically by my own 
imagination before!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Here, take my jacket. You look a little 
cold.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Thank you. It's all so beautiful I forgot 
how many hundreds of degrees zero it 
must be. I just wish I could convince 
the others you're alive.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
You can. All you have to do is wake 
up.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
No no! Don't say that! This is real!</speak>

<info>Cut to: Leela's Bedroom. She wakes up and sends Nibbler flying 
off the bed.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Not another dream!  Fry's jacket! The 
one he was buried in! My dream was real! 
He's alive!</speak>

<info>Her neighbour thumps the wall.</info>

<info>Planet Express: Meeting Room. Bender is on fire. Hermes, Amy, 
Zoidberg and Farnsworth blast him with fire extinguishers.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
That's better!</speak>

<info>He lights a cigar. Enter Leela with Fry's jacket in a jacket 
jacket.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Fry's alive! I have proof!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
You do not!</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
I'm from Jamaica, the show-me island. 
So show me you're blowing it out your 
fanny.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
But he gave me his jacket. Look.</speak>

<info>She opens the jacket jacket and pulls out...her own green jacket.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
That's not Fry's jacket. Fry's jacket 
is red! That's your jacket. An off the 
rack lime green affair.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
But Fry...his jacket...and when I woke 
up it was on me.</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
You're under a lot of guilt stress Leela. 
Here, work it off.</speak>

<info>He hands the squeezy stress toy and she squeezes it.</info>

<speak who="LEELA"><info>SQUEEZING</info>
I am not under stress dammit!</speak>

<info>The toy explodes.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
What?</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
I said everything's going to be alright.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Oh. Maybe I am freaking out a little.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
A little? You're screwier than my Aunt 
Rita! And she's a screw!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
I need to calm down. I'd better take 
some more of that space honey.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
You've been taking space honey? Be careful 
you purple haired imbecile!</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
One spoonful calms you down, two spoonfuls 
help you sleep, but three spoonfuls, 
you'll go into a sleep and never wake 
up! Never!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER"><info>(AMY'S VOICE)</info>
Never!</speak>

<info>Leela gasps.</info>

<info>Planet Express: Lounge. Leela takes a spoonful of honey.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
One spoonful to calm me down.  OK, I've 
got a pretty good calm going! Two spoonfuls 
to help me sleep.  Uh oh, still awake. 
I guess one more spoonful couldn't hurt. 
Oh my gosh! I'd better get a sponge! 
Fry?  Is that you? I don't need a sponge!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Why and I sticky and naked? Did I miss 
something fun?</speak>

<info>Planet Express: Farnsworth's Lab. Farnsworth scans Fry with 
the gizmometer.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Incredible! According to the gizmometer, 
Fry touched the royal jelly in the space 
hive, leaving an imprint of his DNA 
and brainwaves. Then, when it spilled 
on the couch, it recombined with trace 
amounts of Fry's hair and skin -</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
And blood! Don't forget about Fry's 
blood!</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Yes Bender, thank you. In short, the 
various fluids Fry left in the couch 
caused the royal jelly to regenerate 
his entire being!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Neat!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
This is great! My buddy's alive and 
his credit cards are valid again!  Lets 
go get hammered!</speak>

<info>The crew cheer.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
I should warn you: I'm a mean drunk.</speak>

<info>They leave, leaving Fry and Leela alone.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Fry, I'm so glad I didn't kill you.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Me too.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Feeling responsible for your death was 
driving me mad. But now everything is 
alright.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Uh, not everything.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
What? What do you mean?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
You have to wake up.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Wake up? Oh no! No! It can't be!</speak>

<info>Cut to: Planet Express: Lounge. Leela wakes up on the couch. 
The royal jelly wasn't spilt and Fry didn't come back to life. 
The two spoonfuls did help her sleep. She gasps and looks around.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Poo.</speak>

<info>Planet Express: Meeting Room.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
I'm cracking up. In my dreams I'm happy 
because Fry is alive, but when I'm awake 
my mind plays tricks on me.</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
Oh take it easy Leela.</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
In every life we have some trouble.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
But when you worry you make it double.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH"><info>(SINGING)</info>
The landlord says your rent is late...</speak>

<speak who="HERMES"><info>(SINGING)</info>
He might have to litigate.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER"><info>(SINGING)</info>
But don't worry!</speak>

<info>He opens his chest cabinet and a bee flies out and stings Farnsworth's 
head.</info>

<speak who="BEE"><info>(SINGING)</info>
Bee...</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH"><info>(SINGING)</info>
...happy!</speak>

<info>His head explodes and the meeting room goes dark.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG"><info>(SINGING)</info>
Ain't got no cash,

Ain't got no style,

Ladies vomit when I smile,

But does Zoidberg worry?

</speak><info>The bee stings him.</info>

<speak who="BEE"><info>(SINGING)</info>
Bee...</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG"><info>(SINGING)</info>
...happy!</speak>

<info>He explodes. Hermes holds Amy and skates around as the bee flies 
alongside.</info>

<speak who="HERMES"><info>(SINGING)</info>
Don't worry now Amy!</speak>

<info>The bee stings him and he explodes.</info>

<speak who="AMY"><info>(SINGING)</info>
OK! I'm happy!</speak>

<info>The bee stings her and she explodes.</info>

<info>Streamers and glitter falls around the table and Bender dances 
on it.</info>

<speak who="BENDER"><info>(SINGING)</info>
Take us home Bender! Don't worry!</speak>

<speak who="BEE"><info>(SINGING)</info>
Bee...</speak>

<info>It stings him.</info>

<speak who="BENDER"><info>(SINGING)</info>
...happy!</speak>

<info>He explodes in a rather nice display of fireworks. The smoke 
clears and everyone is back at the table again.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Uh, were you just singing?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
No I was telling you not to worry. I'm 
not allowed to sing - court order.</speak>

<info>Ship's Cockpit. Leela takes off in the ship. She is nervous 
and jittery.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
I'll find Fry's coffin, take his corpse 
and keep it under my mattress to remind 
me he's really dead. That'll prove I'm 
not insane.</speak>

<info>Outside Ship. Leela stands at the airlock in her spacesuit and 
looks out at Fry's coffin, floating like the monolith from 2001: 
A Space Odyssey. She jumps out and floats to it. She puts her 
hands on it.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
OK, it's just an ordinary coffin. Containing 
my ordinary dead friend, who I killed.</speak>

<info>She opens the coffin. Inside are lots of colours going by very 
fast like in 2001: A Space Odyssey. Leela stares.</info>

<info>Cut to: Leela's Bedroom. She wakes up from what was another 
dream.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
What happened? Why am I in my apartment?</speak>

<info>Farnsworth's, Zoidberg's, Hermes' and Amy's faces appear on 
her walls.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Stop it! Stop it!</speak>

<info>She tears their faces down like wallpaper. Bender appears on 
the floor.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
You killed Fry!</speak>

<info>She grabs the hoover and sucks him up.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
OK, I'm insane! But I'm still sane enough 
to know it.  The only time I feel alright 
is in my dreams. With you.  Three spoonfuls. 
Then I can dream forever.  One.  Two 
Here goes. Goodbye waking world.</speak>

<info>The spoon moves towards her mouth. Fry's photo suddenly starts 
talking.</info>

<speak who="FRY">'S PHOTO
Leela! No!  Listen to me, you don't 
want to lie in bed like a vegetable 
and do nothing the rest of your life. 
I've tried it. Bedsores hurt!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA"><info>(CRYING)</info>
Then what am I s'posed to do?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">'S PHOTO
Fight it!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA"><info>(CRYING)</info>
I can't!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">'S PHOTO
You can! The Leela I know doesn't give 
up this easily.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
OK. I'll try.  Go away!</speak>

<info>She throws the jar at it. The jar and the bee break and the 
one bee becomes a swarm. Leela picks up Fry's photo and holds 
it tightly.</info>

<speak who="FRY">'S PHOTO
I don't know if you can hear me Leela 
but there's something I wanna tell you. 
I love you.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA"><info>(CRYING)</info>
I'm so scared Fry I don't know what 
to do.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">'S PHOTO
Just wake up Leela. Please. Just wake 
up.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA"><info>(CRYING)</info>
I don't understand what you mean!</speak>

<info>She hugs the photo.</info>

<info>Cut to: Hospital Room. Leela is in a bed and Fry is sat at her 
side. His jacket is draped around her and she is in a coma.</info>

<speak who="FRY"><info>(CRYING)</info>
Just wake up. Please. Just wake up Leela.</speak>

<info>Her eyelid flutters and opens. She looks around.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Fry. You're alive!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Leela! You're awake!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Of course I'm awake. You wouldn't stop 
waking me.  Where am I?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
In the hospital. The ambulance brought 
you here right after the bee stung you.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
But the bee stung you. It barely touched 
me.</speak>

<info>Fry lifts up his shirt. There is a patch where his wound was.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Stinger went right through me and you 
got all the poison. My new spleen came 
from a guy who liked to motorcycle.</speak>

<info>He makes revving noises. Enter the rest of the crew.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
Sweet three toed sloth of ice planet 
Hoth! She's awake!</speak>

<info>They all cheer.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
You were in the best coma I've ever 
seen!</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
The doctor said you'd never wake up.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Really? How long was I out?</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
Two weeks. Fry never left your side 
for a minute.</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
And he talked non-stop, like a parrot 
of the sea he was.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
I though that if you heard a familiar 
voice, it might help keep your mind 
together. But, who knows if it really 
got through.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
It got through Fry.  It got through.</speak>
