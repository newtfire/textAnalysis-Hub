                         a runaway semi, driven by the Incredible 
                         Hulk.

                         It's explosive! Maybe we could escape 
                         by setting fire to the distillery and 
                         blowing this whole place to rubble! 
                          Let's get a little kindling going!

                         Bender, I understand your desire to 
                         be remembered. But you don't need a 
                         statue for that.

                         No. You have your legacy as a brutal 
                         tyrannical dictator. And that will outlive 
                         any monument.
