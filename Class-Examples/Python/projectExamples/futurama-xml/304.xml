<info>Outside Greasy Sue's Truck Stop. The Planet Express ship flies 
along the Historic Root 66 - a space road. C.W. McCall's Convoy 
plays. The ship leaves the space lane and heads for the truck 
stop and flies through the airlock.</info>

<info>Cut to: Greasy Sue's Truck Stop Forecourt. The ship lands.</info>

<speak who="MAN #1"><info>ON RADIO</info>
Breaker breaker, this is the Duck. Uh, 
you wanna back off them hogs?</speak>

<info>Time Lapse. Leela gets the Dark Matter fuel pump and starts 
pumping it into the ship.</info>

<speak who="MAN #1"><info>ON RADIO</info>
Ten-four, five miles or so.</speak>

<speak who="MAN #2"><info>ON RADIO</info>
Ten, roger!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Hmm, I'd better check the fluid levels. 
<info>(shouting)</info> We're OK on Coke syrup.</speak>

<info>Bender puts an Ethanol &amp; Tonic pump into his mouth and use his 
fingers as a lighter to light a cigar. His fingers won't work 
though.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Oh man, come on!  Comin' through!</speak>

<info>Cut to: Greasy Sue's Truck Stop Men's Room. Fry wanders in and 
sees a dispenser. He decides to get a "Fresh" Egg Salad Sandwich. 
He inserts 25 cents and the sandwich comes out.</info>

<info>Cut to: Greasy Sue's Truck Stop Forecourt. Leela puts the dark 
matter pump back and Fry starts up the ship's steps with his 
sandwich.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
What's that black cracker?</speak>

<info>Fry eats it.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
A tomato.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
You're not gonna eat a sandwich from 
a truck stop men's room are you?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Eh, what's the worst thing that could 
happen?  Ugh, it's like there's a party 
in my mouth and everyone's throwing 
up!</speak>

<info>Leela picks up a windscreen mop and flies up to the windscreen 
on a hover-cradle. She brushes of a spacefly, a small ringed 
planet and the Voyager space probe. Sal and a group of other 
truckers watch her.</info>

<speak who="TRUCKER #1">
Looky there! It's one of them things 
like on our mudflaps!</speak>

<speak who="TRUCKER #2">
Yosemite Sam?</speak>

<speak who="SAL">
Stands back! I'm gonna puts my moves 
on her.  Whoas!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
That jerk! No one hoots at my captain 
unless they're prepared to take it to 
the next level!</speak>

<info>He rolls up his sleeves and then he rolls up his trouser legs.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Fry please. That's sweet but I'd rather 
not even dignify them with an ass whooping!</speak>

<speak who="SAL">
Hey sexy mama! Let's get busy and freaky 
in that order!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Hey jumbo! How would you like it if 
Leela said you were sexy and she wanted 
to make love with you?</speak>

<speak who="SAL">
Eh, I gots five minutes. She looks pretty 
good for a truck stop chick!</speak>

<info>The other truckers laugh.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
You take that back! She does not look 
good for a truck stop chick!</speak>

<info>The truckers laugh harder. Leela cringes.</info>

<speak who="SAL">
Yeah you're right. She don't gots enough 
meat for a guy like me.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
She does too! She's loaded with meat! 
She's got more meat than a cow!  Ow!</speak>

<info>The truckers laugh.</info>

<speak who="SAL"><info>(LAUGHING)</info>
More meat than a cow!</speak>

<info>Planet Express: Lounge. Fry and Bender sit on the couch.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
I can't please Leela no matter what 
I do! I just want her to like me.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Well there's always hope.  C'mon we 
gotta go fix the plasma fusion boiler.</speak>

<info>Planet Express: Basement. The boiler rocks and steam hisses 
from it. Fry and Bender walk down the steps and find Scruffy 
"reading" Zero-G Juggs.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Who are you?</speak>

<speak who="SCRUFFY">
Scruffy. The janitor.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Well why aren't you fixing the boiler?</speak>

<speak who="SCRUFFY">
Schedule conflict.</speak>

<info>He thumbs through the magazine.</info>

<info>Time Lapse. The boiler has stopped hissing. Bender uses his 
arm to wrench the pipes tightly together.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
There. Fixed forever.</speak>

<info>Part of the boiler flies off. Fry and Bender gasp. Steam starts 
filling the room.</info>

<speak who="SCRUFFY">
Scruffy's gonna die the way he lived. 
Oh marmalade!</speak>

<info>Planet Express: Zoidberg's Office. Fry is sat on the table with 
a huge pipe sticking out of him. The crew are gathered around. 
Enter Zoidberg.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Oh the hypochondriac's back. So what 
is it this time?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Well my lead pipe hurts a little?</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
That's normal. Next patient.</speak>

<info>Sawing sounds come from the pipe and it suddenly breaks off 
leaving a hole through Fry's body. Bender peers through the hole. 
It suddenly fills itself in. Everyone gasps in amazement.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
He's a witch!</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Fry, did you eat anything unusual recently?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
No.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
What about that bathroom egg salad from 
the truck stop?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
I've had better.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Egg salad? Hmm. Zoidberg will have to 
examine your gastrointestinal tract. 
Come everyone, give Fry some privacy.</speak>

<info>He walks out through a door and everyone except Fry and Zoidberg 
follow. There is a large mirror next to the door.</info>

<info>Cut to: Observation Room. The others walk into a darkened room 
and take a seat. The mirror in Zoidberg's office is a two-way 
mirror and they all look through and watch.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
If you can't see well enough through 
the two-way mirror, there'll be a close-up 
on this video screen.</speak>

<info>The screen flickers on and a video picture of Fry's butt appears.</info>

<info>Cut to: Zoidberg's Office. Zoidberg examines Fry's chest with 
a stethescope. He hears the sound of a truck reversing and beeping.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Hmm. We'll need to have a look inside 
you with this camera.  Guess again.</speak>

<info>Fry realises where the camera is going to go and suddenly has 
a worried look on his face.</info>

<info>Cut to: Observation Room. The others are shovelling popcorn 
in their mouths and watching the goings on on the screen. Hermes 
scoops some popcorn out of the box with a Jai Alai scoop. The 
camera pushes it's way up the end of Fry's digestive tract.</info>

<speak who="AMY">
Gross!</speak>

<info>The camera continues burrowing through Fry's guts and the mesmerised 
crew tilt as the camera moves from side to side.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Watch for any subtle irregularity in 
Fry's bowel.</speak>

<info>The camera pushes through a finds a subtle irregularity. A miniature 
city in Fry's bowel made from cutlery he has been eating. Lights 
twinkle on buildings and a monorail goes past.</info>

<speak who="AMY">
It's gorgeous. That place used to be 
a big dump.</speak>

<info>On the screen little worms appear on the top of the buildings.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Oh, eww!</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
Worms? Eww! Puke-a-tronic!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
So the eggs in that egg salad sandwich 
were -</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Correct! Worm eggs! And the mayonaise 
was probably none too fresh either.</speak>

<info>Enter Zoidberg who looks on the screen.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
It's nauseating man!  Is there no way 
to get rid of the disgusting maggots?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Only one. We'll have to travel deep 
inside Fry, in this!</speak>

<info>He pulls a sheet off a table. In the middle of the table is 
a tiny green speck. The crew step closer to get a better look. 
Farnsworth holds a magnifying glass over the speck and reveals 
it to be a miniaturised version of the Planet Express ship.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Shotgun!</speak>

<info>Planet Express: Farnsworth's Lab. Bender, Hermes and Amy look 
inside some rucksacks as Farnsworth speaks to them.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
In each gastro-survival kit, you'll 
find a rain slicker, a disposable fun 
camera, and something to protect you 
against bacteria.... - a harpoon!</speak>

<info>Pullback to reveal the trio are tiny droid versions of themselves 
standing on a glove of a net suit suit Farnsworth is wearing. 
The real Hermes and Amy also wear net suits suits while Bender 
is directly hooked into the system.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Yo, old guy. Why do we have to use those 
tiny micro-droids? Can't you just shrink 
us?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Oh my no. That would require extrememly 
tiny atoms. And have you priced those 
lately? I'm not made of money - leave 
me alone!</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Me next!</speak>

<info>He steps into a platform next to a machine. A huge ring rises 
from the platform and scans Zoidberg. The machine beeps and a 
small egg like those ones you get little toys in comes out the 
other side. Zoidberg pulls the top off the egg. Inside is the 
Zoidberg-droid. Farnsworth picks it up and puts it on his glove. 
His own droid walks towards the group .</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Anyhoo, your net suits will let you 
experience Fry's worm-infested bowels 
as if you were actually wriggling through 
them.</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
There's no part of that sentence I didn't 
like.</speak>

<info>Planet Express: Meeting Room. The big table is empty. But...</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Is everyone present?</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
Right on!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Uh-huh.</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
Definately.</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Yes.</speak>

<info>On the big table is a little big table which the miniaturised 
crew are sat around.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Heres the plan:  We'll enter the ear, 
drip down the back of the throat and 
make for the bowel. There, we'll irritate 
the pelvic splachnic ganglion and cause 
an intestinal spasm, expelling - among 
other things - the parasites.</speak>

<info>The hologram shuts off.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
I'll tell Fry to wash out - among other 
things - his ear.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
No, Fry can't know anything about the 
mission. If he finds out, the worms 
will try to defend themselves. They 
know everything he knows.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
They know how to make ice cream soup?</speak>

<info>Farnsworth looks up.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Leela, your role is to distract Fry 
so he doesn't notice what we're up to.</speak>

<info>Leela is still her normal size though from the droids' point 
of view she is huge.</info>

<speak who="LEELA"><info>(ECHOING)</info>
Can do!</speak>

<info>She salutes.</info>

<speak who="AMY">
Leela, you should really try a facial 
scrubs, for your pores.</speak>

<info>Leela blows and Amy tumbles away from the table, screaming.</info>

<info>Planet Express: Lounge. Fry sits at the table and drinks a can 
of Slurm. He throws the empty can behind him and picks up another 
one of the four cans in front of him. Enter Leela. She points 
at something.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Look! A starling!</speak>

<speak who="FRY"><info>LOOKING AWAY</info>
Really?</speak>

<info>Leela blows the Planet Express ship through a tube like a blow 
dart. It flies through the air and into his ear.</info>

<info>Cut to: Fry's Ear. The ship struggles through a sea of earwax. 
Around it, earwax drips from the walls of the ear.</info>

<info>Cut to: Miniature Ship's Cockpit. The Amy-droid pilots the ship 
while the other droids stand around.</info>

<speak who="AMY"><info>(WHISPERING)</info>
OK Professor.</speak>

<info>Cut to: Planet Express: Lounge. Fry turns to Leela.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
What about what?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Uh...what if we go for a walk possibly 
because it's such a lovely day, perhaps.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
I'd love to!</speak>

<info>He puts his finger in his ear and wriggles it around.</info>

<info>Cut to: Fry's Ear. Fry's finger closes in on the ship and the 
droids scream from inside it.</info>

<info>Cut to: Miniature Ship's Cockpit. The crew grab hold of things 
to keep them steady.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
We gotta get someplace where he won't 
stick his finger!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
It's hopeless! Abandon ship!</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Wait, we just have to get past the eardrum!</speak>

<info>Cut to: Fry's Ear. The ship cuts through the wax with Fry's 
finger right behind them. The ship pops through the eardrum, 
leavin a hole behind. A worm on a crane repairs the hole quick 
as a flash.</info>

<info>Cut to: Fry's Brain. Hermes and Farnsworth look out of the ship 
through the window.</info>

<speak who="HERMES"><info>FROM SHIP</info>
What are those worms doing to Fry's 
brain?</speak>

<speak who="HERMES"><info>FROM SHIP</info>
My God! Soon he'll be smarter than Cher!</speak>

<info>Street. Fry picks some flowers from a stall.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Ah, the scent of a rose. Curious how 
an aromatic chain of hydrocarbons can 
evoke our deepest emotions.  For you.</speak>

<info>She takes them.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
That's such a beautiful thought Fry. 
And what's more amazing you expressed 
it without spewing crumbs at me!</speak>

<info>Cut to: Fry's Nose. The ship speeds through the tunnels of Fry's 
head.</info>

<info>Cut to: Miniature Ship's Cockpit.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Brace yourselves everyone. We're entering 
the interior of Fry's nose!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
We're at finger alert five.</speak>

<info>A red light engulfs the room and an alarm wails.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Let's just pray nothing stimulates the 
delicate smell receptors. <info>(whispering)</info> 
Nobody make a smell.</speak>

<info>Cut to: Street. Fry sniffs the flowers.</info>

<info>Cut to: Fry's Nose. Balls of pollen fly up and batter the ship. 
The crew scream from inside.</info>

<info>Cut to: Miniature Ship's Cockpit.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Quick! We can escape through that nasal 
capillary into the sinus.</speak>

<info>Cut to: Fry's Nose. Amy turns the ship around and the ship heads 
for the hole.</info>

<info>Cut to: Miniature Ship's Cockpit.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
Strange. Usually you don't know anything 
about human anatomy.</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
I learned it from a decongestant commercial. 
<info>(echoing)</info> "Soothing action, action, 
action action..."</speak>

<info>Cut to: Fry's Capillary. The ship moves through the tube between 
two red blood cells.</info>

<info>Cut to: Fry's Vein. The ship is blown out of the capillary with 
the blood cells and is battered around the tube.</info>

<info>Cut to: Miniature Ship's Cockpit. The crew hold on tightly.</info>

<info>Cut to: Fry's Heart. The ship flies into the relatively calm 
eye of the storm. The heart beats around them and the ship glides 
through the heart with the red blood cells.</info>

<info>Cut to: Minature Ship's Cockpit. Bender peers out through the 
window.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Where are we, the ass?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
We're in the heart. Better known as 
"the love muscle."</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Where the food is digested.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
We should be safe, just so long as nothing 
makes it beat faster.</speak>

<info>Cut to: Street. Fry and Leela look down at a puddle in the road 
next to the kerb. Fry steps into it and holds out his hand to 
Leela. She smiles and take hold of it. Fry's heart starts beating 
faster.</info>

<info>Cut to: Fry's Heart. The heart beats faster and the ship is 
thrown around.</info>

<info>Cut to: Miniature Ship's Cockpit: Bender throws his arms in 
the air.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Abandon ship!</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
No! Set course for that cholesterol-encrusted 
valve.</speak>

<info>Cut to: Outside Miniature Ship. Zoidberg opens the turret hatch 
and scrapes cholesterol off the roof of the valve and spreads 
it on a cracker.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
It's good cholesterol but it spreads 
like bad cholesterol!</speak>

<info>He gobbles the cracker. The ship flies past worms who are busy 
scrubbing the valve.</info>

<info>Fry's Muscles. The ship glides past some worms who are working 
Fry's muscles while listening to music.</info>

<speak who="AMY"><info>FROM SHIP</info>
Look! They're jazzercising Fry's muscles!</speak>

<info>Cut to: Miniature Ship's Cockpit.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
He'll be as strong and flexible as Gumbo 
and Hercules combined!</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Gumbercules? I love that guy!</speak>

<info>Outside Construction Site. Fry and Leela walk down the street. 
Leela suddenly stops and groans.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Ugh! It's that jerk from the truck stop! 
Let's cross the street and try to blend 
in with that crowd of pimps.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
I don't think so.  Sir, I believe you 
owe this lady an apology.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Fry no! He's bulging with what could 
be muscles!  Ooo!</speak>

<speak who="SAL">
I gots your apologys right heres!  Sorrys 
ma'am. I've learnsed a lesson about 
not ogling cans that I won't soons forgets.</speak>

<info>Fry's Stomach. The crew look through the ship's windscreen.</info>

<info>The ship crosses a boundary and an alarm wails and red lights 
flash. Worm ships converge on the ship and open fire on it. The 
projectiles just bounce off the ship's hull.</info>

<info>Cut to: Miniature Ship's Cockpit.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Abandon ship!</speak>

<info>He heads for the door but Hermes and Zoidberg restrain him.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
No, don't give up now! we're but a stones 
throw from the pyloric sphinchter.</speak>

<info>He points to a hole in Fry's stomach.</info>

<info>Cut to: Fry's Stomach. The worm ships continue firing and their 
ammo still bounces off the ship. The hole begins to close.</info>

<info>Cut to: Miniature Ship's Cockpit. The crew hold on as they are 
thrown around.</info>

<info>Cut to: Fry's Stomach. The little ship goes most of the way 
through the hole but it closes around it. The worm's ammo pushes 
it through.</info>

<speak who="BENDER"><info>FROM SHIP</info>
Hooray!</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG"><info>FROM SHIP</info>
Hooray!</speak>

<speak who="HERMES"><info>FROM SHIP</info>
We made it!</speak>

<info>The momentum from the worm ships' engines propels them towards 
the closed hole and they crash into it and explode � la the alien 
ships on the mothership in Independence Day.</info>

<info>Cut to: Fry's Bowels. The ship races through the tunnels and 
cruises over the worm city. It lands.</info>

<info>Time Lapse. The crew emerge from the ship with laser rifles.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
There it is! The stately capitol of 
Fry's bowel. A heavily guarded fortress 
surrounding the pelvic splachnic ganglion.</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
I've heard of that, who said I haven't?!</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
If we can stimulate that nerve, the 
bowel will convulse, expelling the entire 
worm society.</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
But what about the worms in the other 
parts of his body?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Listen, this is gonna be one hell of 
a bowel movement. Afterwards he'll be 
lucky if he has any bones left!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
All right, let's mush some worms!</speak>

<info>He cocks his laser and fires on the worm building.</info>

<info>Cut to: Worm Building Balcony. The worms' mayor runs out onto 
the balcony and waves his arms around.</info>

<speak who="WORM MAYOR">
Worms to battlestations!</speak>

<info>Worm soldiers lean out of windows with lasers and a firefight 
ensues.</info>

<info>Outside Coffee Shop. Fry and Leela sit at a table outside the 
caf� which is across the street from the Planet Express building. 
Fry takes a sip of coffee. He picks a bit off his muffin and 
tosses it to some owls on the ground nearby. They hoot and eat 
it. Leela pours another cup of coffee for her and Fry. She smiles.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
I had a great time today. The flowers, 
the puddle, the way you hurt that guy. 
But can I ax you something?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Anything.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Why did you do all that stuff?</speak>

<info>Fry sighs.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Leela, there's something I've wanted 
to tell you for a long time but every 
time I try I get nervous and my mouth 
feels like it's stuffed with peanut 
butter, even when it's not.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
What is it? Is it about Bender?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
No, it's about you and me.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
And Bender?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Bender's not involved.  Leela...I love 
you.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
You do?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Yes. But it's only recently I've been 
able to articulate my thoughts. I love 
you Leela and I always have.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Fry, that's the sweetest, most wonderful 
- wait! Recently? Like since you ate 
that toilet sandwich?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Yeah! I don't know why but my life really 
turned around that day!</speak>

<info>Leela thinks for a moment.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Stay here.</speak>

<info>She runs back inside the Planet Express building. Fry sighs 
and a waitress approaches with a jug of coffee.</info>

<speak who="WAITRESS">
Freshen your nocatina?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Please......I need something to settle 
my stomach.</speak>

<info>Cut to: Worm Building. The crew sans Zoidberg have made it inside 
the fortress and continue firing at the worm defence. They stop 
at a door.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
The nerve is through here. Where's Zoidberg?</speak>

<info>Enter Zoidberg riding one of Fry's sperm.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Yippie-ki-yay! You'll never guess where 
I've been!</speak>

<info>Planet Express: Farnsworth's Lab. Leela scans herself on the 
droid machine, leans out a window and blows her droid into Fry's 
coffee cup across the street.</info>

<info>Cut to: Outside Coffee Shop. Fry takes a sip of his coffee.</info>

<info>Pelvic Splachnic Ganglion Room. The crew are still outside. 
There is the sound of a battering ram on the door.</info>

<info>The door falls in. Bender is the battering ram! He rubs his 
head.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
There it is! The pelvic splachnic ganglion. 
Tickle it and get ready for the ride 
of your lives!</speak>

<info>Enter Leela with one arm behind her.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Don't even think about tickling that 
ganglion!</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Leela, you're just in time to help. 
If we don't get rid of the worms now, 
they'll burrow so deep into the bowel 
that not even Hermes' famous jerk prunes 
could dislodge them!</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
I call it "Carribean Drain-o"!</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Fry will be stuck with the worms forever.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Perfect.</speak>

<info>She pulls an axe out from behind and chops off the Farnsworth-droid's 
head. She smashes the rest of it's body up, spins around and 
knocks off the Zoidberg droid's head.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Ouch!</speak>

<info>She takes another swing at Hermes' head and with one swing, 
knocks off Bender's and Amy's heads. She continues smashing up 
the pile of droid parts on the floor.</info>

<info>Cut to: Planet Express: Farnsworth's Lab. The crew flail around 
on the floor in their net suits. Then take off their helmets.</info>

<speak who="AMY">
I'm OK.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Leela you ignorant dope! Now the worms 
will be in Fry forever.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
So? Did you ever stop to think that 
Fry is better off with worms?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Oh that's stupid!</speak>

<info>The door opens and Fry appears.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
If anyone wants to tell me what's going 
on here, I'll be in the lounge.</speak>

<info>The door closes.</info>

<info>Planet Express: Meeting Room. The crew are sat around the big 
table.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Of all the parasites I've had over the 
years, these worms are among the - hell! 
They are the best! Leela, how can I 
ever repay you for saving them?</speak>

<info>Leela trails her finger around the table.</info>

<speak who="LEELA"><info>(SEXFULLY)</info>
I'll think of something.</speak>

<info>The gaze into each others eyes. Bender rubs his chin.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
'Ello! What's all this then?</speak>

<info>Leela's Apartment Building. Fry and Leela stand in a corridor 
outside Leela's apartment. She holds the flowers from earlier.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Apartment 1I. The old me would have 
made a joke about that!</speak>

<info>They walk in. Fry stops and stares in astonishment.</info>

<info>Cut to: Leela's Living Room. The walls are white and there is 
a single chair in the middle of the room facing a TV on the wall.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
I'm thinking of having a window installed.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
I think the view's perfect already.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Oh, that's the corniest thing I've ever 
heard! Let me show you the bedroom.</speak>

<info>Fry holds her back.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Wait. In a minute.</speak>

<info>They sit down. Fry pulls out a case and opens it. Something 
blue is inside.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
A holophonor? Only a few people in the 
whole universe can play that. And they're 
not very good at it.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
They don't have you to inspire them.</speak>

<info>He assembles the holophonoer and begins to play. The holophonor 
sounds a bit like a violin. A flare of blue-green light comes 
out of the end of the holophonor and swirls around above Fry 
and Leela's heads. The spiral opens out into an image of a formally 
dressed Fry and Leela dancing on the rings of a planet. They 
dance and the planet flies away into the distance. The image 
fades to the night sky of a planet. The clouds in the sky merge 
into outlines of Fry and Leela. The outlines kiss and a flash 
radiates from their lips. The holophonor has changed to an undersea 
setting. Two seals that look like Fry and Leela swim around with 
each other. They swim to the top of the sea and leap into the 
air beneath the full moon in the sky. A wave sweeps past the 
moon and spills onto the shoreline. On the beach a clam shell 
opens and in it's pearl the formally dressed Fry and Leela dance 
some more. Fry lifts Leela into the air and the pearl flashes 
into hundreds of white sparks that fall around the mesmerised 
Leela's head. Fry's sonnet ends and Leela is speechless. She 
takes Fry's hand and walks with him into the bedroom.</info>

<info>Leela's Bedroom. Fry and Leela make out on her bed.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
I don't have words to say how wonderful 
you are Fry. I haven't felt this happy 
since double-soup Tuesday at the orphanarium.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
When I'm with you, everyday seems like 
double-soup Tuesday.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Oh Fry, I love what you've become.</speak>

<info>She hugs him.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
What I've become.</speak>

<info>He sighs.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
What is it?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
There's just something I have to find 
out.</speak>

<info>He gets up and walks out of the apartment. Leela stands in her 
bedroom doorway and sadly watches him go.</info>

<info>Planet Express: Farnsworth's Lab. Fry stands on the scanner 
platform and the machine scans him. He takes his droid out of 
the egg and drops it down the back of his trousers.</info>

<info>Fry's Bowels. Fry's droid looks across at the Worm city and 
walks towards the main building.</info>

<info>Cut to: Outside Worm Building. Guards surround him.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Who controls this bowel?</speak>

<speak who="WORM GUARD #1">
Who wants to know?</speak>

<info>Fry points at a gold statue of himself. Underneath the statue 
is the inscription "The Known Universe." The statue is in the 
same pointing pose as Fry is. The worms gasp and bow.</info>

<info>Worm Building: Stately Room. The Worm Mayor sits on a throne 
and Fry stands before him with guards around him.</info>

<speak who="WORM MAYOR">
I am the Lord Mayor of Cologne.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
You mean colon?</speak>

<speak who="WORM MAYOR">
State your business!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Your excellency, have you ever been 
in love?</speak>

<speak who="WORM MAYOR">
No. I thought I was once but then I 
remember our species reproduces with 
a cloud of spores.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Well, a wonderful girl loves me. But 
I need to know if it's really me she 
loves, or just what you worms have made 
of me. That's why with all due respect, 
I'm asking you to leave.</speak>

<speak who="WORM MAYOR">
Listen you, I was born here. I raised 
a cloud of children here. My ancestors 
came over here on the sandwich.  No 
one can make me leave!</speak>

<info>He gets up off his throne and lunges at Fry. Fry ducks and grabs 
a sword of the wall and begins fighting with the Worm Mayor. 
The Worm Mayor backs him against an elevator. Fry hits the open 
button and they both go inside, still fighting.</info>

<info>Cut to: Elevator. Fry closes the door, blocking out the other 
guards. He looks at the other buttons, Brain, Lungs, Liver, Ball 
Room. He presses the brain button.</info>

<info>Cut to: Fry's Brain. Worms continue to tune-up Fry's brain. 
The elevator doors open and the Worm Mayor and Fry continue to 
fight. Worms head for the fight, drawing their spears. The Worm 
Mayor grins as Fry is backed up against a nerve. He climbs the 
nerve and the worms follow him up. Fry reaches the top of the 
nerve and has nowhere left to go. He hold out his sword.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Everyone out of my body or the brain 
gets it!</speak>

<speak who="WORM MAYOR">
He's bluffing. No creature would willingly 
make an idiot out of itself.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Obviously you've never been in love! 
Ow!  Ow!  Ow!  Now, the hand-eye co-ordination 
lobe.</speak>

<info>He cuts it and starts staggering around cutting some more nerves. 
He batters the catwalk.</info>

<speak who="WORM GUARD #1">
Stop it man!</speak>

<info>Fry hits the catwalk again and it falls. The worms surround 
him with their swords. He crawls into a corner.</info>

<speak who="WORM MAYOR">
You've damaged your brain Universe, 
but no more than a week of binge drinking 
or five minutes on a cell phone.</speak>

<info>Fry stand up and draws his sword at another lobe.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
I was just working my way towards the 
medulla oblongata - control centre of 
the heart and lungs. And if I kill myself, 
you die with me.</speak>

<info>The worms scream.</info>

<speak who="WORM GUARD #2">
Wait a minute man!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
I hope Satan has a nice colon, 'cause 
that's where you're gonna be living!</speak>

<info>He holds his sword back over his shoulder, ready to cut the 
medulla oblongata. The Worm Mayor stares in disbelief. Fry pulls 
back his sword and the Worm Mayor gives in.</info>

<speak who="WORM MAYOR">
Stop! We'll leave.  But one day you'll 
be eating a fast-food burger and boom! 
You'll be crawling with us again! Ever 
wonder what makes special sauce so special? 
Yo!</speak>

<info>He points at himself. He gestures to the worms and they leave.</info>

<info>Leela's Bedroom. Leela is fast asleep on her bed. She is wearing 
sexy, near see-through underwear. On her face is an open book 
called True Stories Of Courageous Animals. She snores loudly. 
Enter Fry. She awakens.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Fry? I missed you. Did you find out 
what you needed to find out?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
I'm about to.  Leela, let me play for 
you one for time.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
You don't have to do that. I'm still 
seduced from before.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Please, it's important to me.</speak>

<info>He plays. Rather than the soothing, romantic music that played 
earlier in the day, Fry now plays creepy, unromantic music. The 
swirls come from the end of the holophoner and the head of Frankenstein's 
monster appears. He groans and screams then disappears.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
What's that supposed to mean?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
I don't know. I got nervous and started 
thinking about neck bolts.  Wow! Did 
you see that vase break? It was all 
like -</speak>

<info>He makes smashy sounds. Horrified, Leela pulls the blanket around 
herself.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
What's happened to you?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Nothing. I got rid of the worms.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
What? Why would you do that?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Leela, I had worms. I needed to know 
who you loved. Me or them.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Well...which of you wrote me that sonnet?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
I did. I think. It was probably about 
50/50. But that's how I really felt 
about you, I swear!</speak>

<info>He reaches out to Leela but she moves back and sighs.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
I don't know.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Please. Give me a chance to be romantic 
on my own. I've got a baggy of massage 
oil, and I'm gonna give you my super 
back rub, just like a I used to give 
Amy when I was going out with her, and 
she always seemed... - Uh-oh!</speak>

<info>She angrily holds out his holophonor to him.</info>

<info>Robot Arms Apartments: Fry and Bender's Apartment. Bender stands 
in the doorway of Fry's room wearing pyjama bottoms. Fry sighs.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Sorry you struck out sausage link. If 
it's any consolation, my life is great! 
Babes! Bucks! I got it all!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Well, at least I learned Leela's a lost 
cause. I give up.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
There you go!  Goodnight. I gotta get 
up early to go parasailing with movie 
stars!</speak>

<info>The door closes. Fry picks up a book called My First Holophonor 
and leans it up on a chair. He pulls the chair towards him and 
plays his holophonor. Smooth harmonic music comes from the holophonor. 
The holophonor swirls form a pink ball in the air. A smile trickles 
around the ball. A single eye opens in the middle of it and some 
purple hair held up in a ponytail appears on top. Fry smiles 
at the image of his love and continues playing.</info>

<info>THE END</info></xml>
