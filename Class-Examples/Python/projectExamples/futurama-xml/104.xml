<info>Restaurant. Leela is sat at a table with a date, a man called 
Doug.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
This place was a great choice. The food 
is amazing. And such generous portions.</speak>

<speak who="DOUG">
You like the meal just wait until you 
try these after dinner mints.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
You know, Doug, most guys are put off 
by my eye. It's nice to finally meet 
someone who's open-minded.  Ew!</speak>

<info>Opening Credits. Caption: presented in BC [Brain Control</info> where 
available.]

<info>Planet Express: Kitchen. Amy, Leela and Fry stand around drinking 
coffee.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
What was wrong with your date last night?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
I don't know. Something I couldn�t quite 
put my finger on. Possibly his vile 
lizard tongue.</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
You're too picky.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Yeah. If you rule out every guy with 
a lizard tongue or a low I.Q. or an 
explosive violent temper, of course 
you're gonna be lonely.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
There's nothing wrong with having high 
standards. Now can we please stop --</speak>

<info>Cut to: Planet Express: Meeting Room. Amy, Fry and Leela walk 
in. The others are sitting around the table.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
The female Leela's problem is purely 
medical. Soon she will drop her eggs 
and they will hatch and all will be 
well.</speak>

<info>Amy, Leela and Fry sit down.</info>

<speak who="AMY">
You just have to give guys a chance. 
Sometimes you meet a guy and think he's 
a pig. But then later you realise he 
actually has a really good body.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Thank you all for the inspiring advice, 
but I'm perfectly happy with my life 
the way it is.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
That sounds like a cry for help.</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
Let's all take her out tonight. There's 
lots of great places to meet people.</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
The Federal Sex Bureau.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
A saucy puppet show.</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
The rotting carcass of a whale.</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
Hmm, I'll pick!</speak>

<info>The Hip Joint. A nightclub on Jetsons-esque stilts with hovering 
platforms and strobe lighting. Everyone except Fry is wearing 
outfits with grooby rings.</info>

<speak who="AMY">
Oh, wow, it's totally retro.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Why's everyone wearing those rings?</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
Guh! Because nobody wears them anymore! 
Rings are stupid!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
I think they look cool.</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
Shh! Don't let anyone hear you say that!</speak>

<speak who="MAN">
Hey, did that guy just say rings are 
cool?</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
Nope, he said they're stupid.</speak>

<info>The man shows a thumbs up.</info>

<speak who="MAN">
Cool!</speak>

<info>Time Lapse. Leela, Amy and Bender are sat at a table with drinks.</info>

<speak who="AMY">
So what do you think of that guy by 
the bar?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
I don't know. Maybe?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Forget it, he's gay.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
What?! How can you tell?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
I just know these things. I've got what 
they call gaydar.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
There's no such thing.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
No?  OK, I got a lock on him.  Yep! 
He's gay!</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
Are you sure?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Definitely. Unless I'm getting interference 
from a gay weather balloon.</speak>

<info>Fry talks to a woman at the bar.</info>

<speak who="WOMAN">
You're from the 20th century? That's 
incredible! I'm from the 21st century.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
No way! We've got so much in common.</speak>

<speak who="WOMAN">
We sure do. Remember when those cyborgs 
enslaved humanity?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Uh, yeah! That rings a bell.</speak>

<info>Back at the table, a well-built man has joined the others.</info>

<speak who="AMY">
This is Bolt Rolands. Bolt is a hyper-sled 
racer with 10 wins on the pro circuit.</speak>

<speak who="BOLT">
Hello, beautiful!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
<info>(whispering)</info> I think she means 10 wins 
on the gay circuit.</speak>

<info>Bolt chuckles.</info>

<speak who="BOLT">
I wish! Those cats can really fly.</speak>

<info>Zoidberg is sitting alone at the bar. He tries to pick up a 
drink but his claws just knock the glass over. He folds his arms 
and sulks. A lobster in a tank catches his eye and he stares 
and smiles, lovestruck. At the table, a green cloud is hovering 
where Bolt was.</info>

<speak who="AMY">
This is M-5438, an entity of pure energy.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
That's great - really - but he's just 
not what I'm looking for.</speak>

<speak who="M-5438">I understand. One day you will evolve 
beyond your physical body, and on that 
day I hope you will pick up the phone.</speak>

<info>He flies away. Amy sighs.</info>

<speak who="AMY">
You're impossible.</speak>

<info>Bender's gaydar beeps.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Just as well; I think he comes from 
a dimension that's big on musical theatre.</speak>

<info>Outside The Hip Joint. Everyone is leaving: Amy with M-5438, 
Zoidberg with the lobster and Fry with the 21st century woman. 
Bender is already outside.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Psst, I need the apartment tonight. 
Go see a saucy puppet show.</speak>

<info>He hands Bender some cash.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Can do!</speak>

<info>The Hip Joint. Leela is the only person left in the room. A 
janitor passes by her table, sweeping.</info>

<speak who="JANITOR">
My, my, my! What's a beautiful lady 
like you --  Oh, my! Eurgh! I'm sorry, 
I thought you had two eyes.</speak>

<info>He runs off.</info>

<info>Planet Express: Meeting Room. It's the next morning and everyone 
is sat around the table drinking coffee.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
So, Leela, you must have had your pick 
of the litter last night at closing 
time.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Could you guys please stop talking about 
my personal life?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Yes, let's all talk about Leela's personal 
life later. But right now we have business 
to attend to.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
A delivery?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
No. A tax-deductible mission of charity.</speak>

<info>He flicks a switch, the lights dim and a holographic image of 
a planet is projected over the table.</info>

<speak who="COMPUTER VOICE">
This is Vergon 6.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
This is Vergon 6.</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
Buh!</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
It's a sunny little doomed planet, inhabited 
by a number of frisky little doomed 
animals.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Animals?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
That's right. Animals in desperate need 
of rescue. You see, Vergon 6 was once 
filled with a super dense substance 
known as dark matter, each pound of 
which weighs over ten thousand pounds.</speak>

<info>The holographic Vergon 6 is filled with a black sphere.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Wait! What about the animals?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Well, dark matter is extremely valuable 
as starship fuel. That's why it was 
all mined out, leaving the planet completely 
hollow.</speak>

<info>The holographic dark matter dwindles to nothing.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Yes, but what about the animals?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
The wha?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
The animals.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
I didn't say anything about animals. 
Now it seems that the planet will collapse 
within three days. Incidentally, this 
will kill all the animals.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
So we have to bring back two of each 
kind. Just like Noah's Ark.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Why two?  Oh!</speak>

<info>He giggles.</info>

<info>Ships Cockpit. The ship is en route to the planet. Bender and 
Fry lean across the cockpit discussing things.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
I bet you Leela's holding out for a 
nice guy with one eye.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
That'll take forever. What she oughta 
do is find a nice guy with two eyes, 
then poke one out.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Yeah, that'd be a timesaver.</speak>

<info>Leela is sat right behind them.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Do you mind?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Here you go.  You can use this as an 
eye-poker.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Thank you. But I don't care how many 
eyes a man has - as long as it's less 
than five. All I'm looking for is a 
guy who's adventurous, self-confident...</speak>

<info>Cut to: Outside Ship. The ship flies on.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
...maybe a snappy dresser.</speak>

<info>As the ship flies away a larger ship - the Nimbus - flies over 
the top.</info>

<info>Cut to: Nimbus Bridge. The captain - Zapp Brannigan - stands 
admiring himself while his first officer Kif seems to do all 
the work. They both wear red uniforms. Kif is a spindly little 
green alien and Zapp's physique is mostly made up of a huge, 
poorly contained gut.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
These new uniforms are pretty snappy, 
eh, first officer?</speak>

<speak who="KIF">
I suppose, captain. I'm as big a fan 
of velour as you are. Now what do you 
want to do about that unidentified ship?</speak>

<info>The Planet Express ship flies across the viewscreen.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Destroy them!  Mmm! That's got a nice 
feel to it.</speak>

<info>Time Lapse.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Captain's journal; star date 3000.3.</speak>

<speak who="KIF">
Who are you talking to, sir?</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
You! Aren't you getting this?  We have 
detected a vessel attempting to break 
the security cordon around Vergon 6. 
I'm anticipating an all-out tactical 
dogfight, followed by a light dinner...ravioli, 
ham, sundae bar.</speak>

<info>Cut to: Ships Cockpit. The crew can see the Nimbus through the 
windscreen.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Hey, look! That's Zapp Brannigan's ship.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Wow! The Zapp Brannigan?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Uh-huh!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Who's the Zapp Brannigan?</speak>

<info>Cut to: Nimbus Bridge. Zapp and Kif watch the ship approach.</info>

<speak who="KIF">
Shall I fire on them now, sir?</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Not yet, Kif. In the game of chess, 
you can never let your adversary see 
your pieces.  What?</speak>

<info>Cut to: Ships Cockpit.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
They say Zapp Brannigan single-handedly 
saved the Octillian system from a horde 
of rampaging Killbots.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Wow!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
A grim day for robot-kind. Ah, but we 
can always build more Killbots!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
He's the most decorated captain in the 
whole Democratic Order Of Planets.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
<info>(teasing)</info> Leela's got a boyfriend!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
No I don't. But I think we ought to 
meet with him and see if he'll help 
us rescue those animals.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Well just in case you guys hit it off 
you'll wanna take this with you.</speak>

<info>He holds up the fork.</info>

<info>Cut to: Nimbus Bridge.</info>

<speak who="KIF">
Sir, they're headed straight for us.</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
A well-calculated move straight out 
of Sun Tzu's classic text The Art Of 
War, or my own masterwork: Zapp Brannigan's 
Big Book Of War.  But the one thing 
their captain doesn't realise and never 
will is that --</speak>

<speak who="KIF">
Sir, they've docked with us and have 
come aboard.</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Then I have risked all and lost. Kif, 
old man, I'll be in the escape pod. 
If that wicker chair I like survives 
the slaughter, have it sent to my P.O. 
box.</speak>

<info>The door opens and the Planet Express crew walk in. Zapp screams 
and hides behind a chair. Leela looks around and sees Kif.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Hello, I'm Leela, captain of the Planet 
Express delivery ship. We've come aboard 
to plead for your assistance.</speak>

<speak who="KIF">
Well, if there's anything --</speak>

<info>Zapp jumps in front of Kif.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
I'm in command here. Zapp Brannigan. 
Has my fame preceded me or was I too 
quick for you?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Oh, not at all. I'm just so uh...really 
thrilled to meet you!</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
You're an impressive piece of captain. 
Beautiful and deadly - a potent combination.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
<info>(flattered)</info> You don't mean that!</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
But I do. I doubt I've seen more than 
three or four captains sexier than you, 
and only one who was deadlier.</speak>

<info>He takes her hand and Fry leans in.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
I heard that one time you single-handedly 
defeated a horde of rampaging somethings 
in the something something system.</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
The Killbots? A trifle! It was simply 
a matter of outsmarting them.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Wow! I never would have thought of that!</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
You see, Killbots have a preset kill 
limit. Knowing their weakness, I sent 
wave after wave of my own men at them, 
until they reached their limit and shutdown. 
Kif, show them the medal I won.</speak>

<info>Kif sighs and points to a medal on Zapp's uniform.</info>

<info>Nimbus Mess Hall. Leela, Zapp, Fry and Bender sit at a table, 
looking down at the rest of the crew who are eating. Kif is grating 
cheese over Zapp's food.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
More, please.  A little more...more...keep 
going.</speak>

<info>He carries on.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Captain Brannigan, we really need to 
talk to you about our mission.</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Whatever it is, I'm willing to put wave 
after wave of men at your disposal. 
Right men?</speak>

<info>He raises his glass to the crew.</info>

<speak who="CREWMAN">
<info>(shouting)</info> You suck!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
We're hoping to save the animals of 
Vergon 6 from extinction. And if you 
could just --</speak>

<info>Zapp spits out his drink.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Vergon 6?! This light dinner is over.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Wait! What's wrong?</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
The Democratic Order Of Planets prohibits 
interfering with undeveloped worlds. 
It's a little rule known as "Brannigan's 
Law".</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
But people already interfered. That 
planet was mined completely hollow.</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Yes, by a Democratic Order Of Planets 
mining crew.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
This doesn't make any sense.</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
I don't pretend to understand Brannigan's 
Law. I merely enforce it.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Fine! We'll save the animals without 
your help.</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
I'm afraid I can't allow that. Guards!</speak>

<info>Guards grab Leela, Fry and Bender.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
What just happened?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
He's throwing us in prison.</speak>

<info>Fry sighs.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Dang! Can I get this wrapped up?</speak>

<info>He holds up his plate and Zapp nods.</info>

<info>Nimbus Brig. Leela touches the force field around the doorway 
and gets electrocuted.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Ow! I might've liked Zapp Brannigan 
if he weren't a pompous dimwit who threw 
me in prison.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
You really are too picky.</speak>

<info>Nimbus Corridor.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Kif, follow me up to the observation 
deck. I've got some musing to do.</speak>

<info>Zapp climbs a ladder and Kif accidentally looks up his skirt.</info>

<speak who="KIF">
Oh, jeez!</speak>

<info>Cut to: Nimbus Observation Deck.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
I'm facing a formidable female adversary, 
Kif. Suggestions?</speak>

<speak who="KIF">
I fail to see any problem sir. You already 
imprisoned her under directive B10.81.</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
You mean Brannigan's Law?</speak>

<speak who="KIF">
Right, that law.</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Which one?</speak>

<info>Kif sighs.</info>

<speak who="KIF">
Brannigan's Law.</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Kif, you're my best and most loyal friend 
but you've earned my contempt once again. 
As my prod�g� you should know that the 
only way to deal with a female adversary 
is to seduce her.  This time we are 
sure she's a woman, right?</speak>

<speak who="KIF">
Yes.</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Good! Invite her to my quarters. Oh, 
and have the boy lay out my formal shorts.</speak>

<speak who="KIF">
The boy, sir?</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
You. You lay out my formal shorts.</speak>

<info>He disappears down the ladder.</info>

<info>Nimbus Corridor. Kif walks past crewmembers with Leela following 
him.</info>

<speak who="KIF">
The jackass wants to see you in his 
quarters.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Good. This will be my chance to reason 
with him, captain to captain.</speak>

<speak who="KIF">
And he wants you to wear this.</speak>

<info>Kif holds up a skimpy little outfit. Leela ignores it and knocks 
on Zapp's door.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Come and get it!</speak>

<info>Cut to: Zapp's Quarters. The doors open and Leela walks in. 
The room is filled with candles and other crap. Zapp lies on 
his hovering heart-shaped bed under a huge portrait of himself 
that is similar to the portrait of JFK.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Welcome to my humble chamber. Or as 
I call it, "the Love-nasium". Shampagin?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
I didn't realise you were such a coin-a-sewer.</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Well I have studied abroad. Or two!</speak>

<info>He laughs. Leela fakes a laugh and throws her champagne on the 
floor while Zapp isn't looking.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Captain...</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Uh-huh?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
...if we could speak seriously for a 
moment...</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Uh-huh?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
...I'd like you to reconsider letting 
us rescue those animals.</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Mm-hm.  I like your style. I find it 
very...<info>(whispering)</info>...erotic.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
What?</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
<info>(shouting)</info> Erotic!</speak>

<info>Cut to: Kif's Quarters. Zapp's words echo around the ship. Kif 
gets frustrated and bangs the ceiling with a broom handle.</info>

<info>Nimbus Brig. Fry and Bender are still inside.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
We can definitely escape, Bender. All 
you have to do is bend the hatch off 
this steam pipe.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Hey, yeah!</speak>

<info>He bends the hatch off and the steam rushes out of it and starts 
filling the room.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
No good! It's full of steam!</speak>

<info>Zapp's Quarters. Leela impatiently paces back and forth.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
You look like a woman who enjoys the 
finer things. Come over here and feel 
my velour bedspread.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
I'm not really in the mood.</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Leela, it's real velour. Just let yourself 
go.</speak>

<info>He rolls over onto his back.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Can I please just go back to prison?</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
You'd rather sit in prison than spend 
one evening with the Zapper?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Much rather!  What are you doing?</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
<info>(crying)</info> Oh, God, I'm pathetic. Sorry. 
Just go. You want the rest of the shampagin?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
No, and it's pronounced "sham-pane".</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
<info>(crying)</info> Oh, God, no!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Its not a big deal.</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
<info>(crying)</info> I get so lonely. I just thought 
you - a fellow captain - would understand.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Oh, forget it.</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
<info>(crying)</info> Yeah, it's great ordering people 
around and stuff but through it all 
you're completely alone.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
It comes with the job.</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
<info>(crying)</info> I'm just so lonely!</speak>

<info>He cries more.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Oh, come on, cheer up, it's not that 
bad.</speak>

<info>Nimbus Brig. The room is still full of steam.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
You wanna try escaping again?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Nah, I'm comfy.</speak>

<info>They are wearing towels enjoying the steam room they've created.

<speak who="FRY">
Man, Leela's been gone a long time. 
I hope she's at least making progress 
with Zapp Brannigan.</speak>

[Cut to: Zapp's Quarters. The morning after the night before... 
Leela wakes up. She turns her head and sees she's lying in Zapp's 
bed. With him. He is still asleep and has a big grin on his face. 
She screams.</info>

<info>Time Lapse. Leela has got dressed and is sneaking out. Zapp 
wakes up.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Good morning, lover.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Uh, listen, Zapp.</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Now you're officially my woman. Kudos! 
I can't say I don't envy you.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Zapp, last night was a mistake.</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
A sexy mistake.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
No, just a regular mistake. For a split 
second my common sense was overwhelmed 
by pity.</speak>

<info>Zapp laughs.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
A split second is all it takes. That's 
why sooner or later you'll come crawling 
back to the Zapper.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
The only kind of crawling I'm doing 
to you is away - from!</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Leela, you're obviously confused and 
aroused.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Look, I'm going down to Vergon 6 to 
save those animals whether you like 
it or not.</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Go ahead. I won't stop you.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Threaten all you -- wait, what?</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
We both know you won't make it halfway 
to Vergon 6 before the craving sets 
in. Then you'll come crawling back for 
another taste of sweet, sweet candy...Bam!</speak>

<info>He points at his crotch.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Eurgh!</speak>

<info>She storms out. Zapp chuckles.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Kif!</speak>

<info>Kif appears in the doorway.</info>

<speak who="KIF">
Yes --  Yes, captain?</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
I have made it with a woman. Inform 
the men.</speak>

<info>Nimbus Brig. Kif lets Fry and Bender out of the cell.</info>

<speak who="KIF">
The fatso says you're free to go.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Really? Why?</speak>

<speak who="KIF">
<info>(quietly)</info> "Why" indeed.</speak>

<info>He looks at Leela then walks off.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
What does that mean?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
<info>(defensively)</info> Nothing.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
So should we get our stuff and head 
down to the planet?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
<info>(defensively)</info> We just talked, OK?!</speak>

<info>The ship flies down to Vergon 6, through the green cloudy sky. 
The planet is surreal and Dali-like.</info>

<info>Vergon 6 Surface. Leela, Fry and Bender stand beside the ship 
with huge nets.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Alright. We don't have much time to 
collect these animals. The planet is 
supposed to collapse in approximately 
two hours ago.</speak>

<info>Montage The crew hunt for the animals. First, Bender tries to 
find the purple fruit snake but it finds him first and eats him. 
He stands up inside the snake and drags it back to the ship. 
Fry tries to get the windy shrimp but it blows him away. Leela 
tries to get the four legged mimic which looks like a horse but 
copies people's heads and movements. Fry holds a net and tries 
to decide which one is the mimic. Leela points at the mimic and 
it points back at her. Fry looks...and throws the net over Leela. 
Later, Leela ticks off the final animal on the checklist.</info>

<info>Time Lapse. The checklist is filled. A small animal comes out 
from behind some plants. It is mostly black, has one huge nostril 
in the middle of its face and a three eyes, one of them on a 
long stalk coming out of the middle of it's head.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Hello there.  Hmm, he doesn't seem to 
be on the checklist.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
So you're saying we can cook him?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Yeah, a barbecue! I'll wear my hilarious 
apron.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
No! I don't care how hilarious your 
apron is, we're not cooking him.  Aww, 
I'll call him Nibbler.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Aww! <info>(whispering to Fry)</info> I'll fire up 
the grill!</speak>

<info>Time Lapse.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
I hope he'll be OK in there with all 
those big animals.</speak>

<info>Ships Cargo Bay. Leela opens the outer door, puts him in and 
closes it. The other animals surround Nibbler. He sniffs at them 
and then eats one whole.</info>

<info>Nimbus Observation Deck. Zapp is looking at Leela through a 
telescope.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Y'know, Kif, once my woman returns I 
won't have much time to hang out with 
the boys anymore.</speak>

<speak who="KIF">
That's a shame, sir.</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
So let's make the most of our time together, 
shall we?  Never mind. Just give me 
a back rub.</speak>

<info>Vergon 6 Surface. Bender carries a two-headed flamingo.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
I found a pair of Hermaphlamingoes.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Good. That's the last species.</speak>

<info>Ships Cargo Bay. The crew look inside and gasp in horror. The 
bay is nearly empty apart from Nibbler.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Hey. What the?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Where'd they all go?</speak>

<info>Nibbler eats the Hermaphlamingoes, making lots of disgusting 
noises. The crew watch and cringe.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Nibbler!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
I can't believe we flew halfway across 
the galaxy and enjoyed a steam just 
to get lunch for that stupid animal!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
He's pending for a bending.</speak>

<info>He rolls up his sleeves and chases Nibbler. He runs to Leela 
and she picks him up.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Leave him alone. It's not his fault 
that he's an unstoppable killing machine. 
Is it, snoogums?</speak>

<info>The ground shakes, rocking the ship.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
The planet's kerploding!</speak>

<info>Cut to: Vergon 6 Surface. Fry runs out through a door and falls 
through the ground. Bender reaches into the hole and pulls him 
back up.</info>

<info>Cut to: Ships Cockpit.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Prepare for lift-off.  We're out of 
fuel. Bender, I told you to fill the 
tank before we left.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Yeah, I'll do it when we get back.</speak>

<info>The ground shakes again.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Man, lucky for us Zapp Brannigan's nearby.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
No way, forget it! I refuse to go crawling 
back to him!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
What? What are you talking about?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
<info>(defensively)</info> Nothing. We just talked.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
So what's your problem? It's not like 
you slept with him.  Oh, my God!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
How could you, Leela? I thought you 
had some standards. I mean, jeez, he's 
a dumb, gross gorilla!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
That's enough. Don't you think I feel 
bad enough already?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
No!</speak>

<info>The ground shakes more violently.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Alright, alright I'll call him.  I mean 
if living is that important to you.</speak>

<info>Nimbus Bridge.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
And that's why you'll never make captain, 
Kif.  Hmmm.</speak>

<info>Leela face appears.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Hello, Zapp?</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Well, well, well!</speak>

<info>Cut to: Ships Cockpit.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Zapp, we're out of fuel...</speak>

<info>Cut to: Nimbus Bridge.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
...and Vergon 6 is about to implode. 
We need your help.</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
So, crawling back to the Big Z like 
a bird on its belly. Delicious.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Bird's don't crawl.</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
They've been known to.</speak>

<info>Cut to: Ships Cockpit.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Look, are you going to rescue us or 
not?</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Can't you ask a little more...sexfully?</speak>

<info>Fry and Bender encourage Leela.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
<info>(sexfully)</info> Please...</speak>

<info>Cut to: Nimbus Bridge.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
...Big Z?</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Certainly. But first you'll have to 
get rid of that thing.  That's the law, 
Leela. And Brannigan's Law is like Brannigan's 
love: hard and fast!...</speak>

<info>Cut to: Ships Cockpit.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
...Now put that greasy rat outside 
and we'll tow you to safety.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
I would never abandon a helpless animal. 
Y'know, Zapp, once I thought you were 
a big pompous buffoon. Then I realised 
that inside you were just a pitiful 
child. But now I realise that outside 
that child is a big pompous buffoon!</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
And which one rocked your world?</speak>

<info>Leela growls and slams down the receiver and his face fizzles 
off the screen.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Wow, way to tell that guy off. Now what's 
your secret escape plan?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Uh, I guess to sit here and wait for 
death.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Can do!</speak>

<info>He puts his feet up and reclines in his chair. There is a huge 
bang and the ship jerks backwards.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
What the hell was that?</speak>

<info>Ships Cargo Bay. There is a big round black blob in Nibbler's 
litter tray.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Pew!</speak>

<info>He fans the air in front of his nose.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
I don't believe it! It's dark matter.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
So this guy just unloaded a steaming 
pile of starship fuel?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
His species must've filled the entire 
planet with it. Did you do that, you 
cute little --  Come on. That should 
be more than enough fuel to get us outta 
here. Bender, pick it up and put it 
in the engine.</speak>

<info>Bender mutters to himself and drags the dark matter across the 
floor towards the engine room.</info>

<info>Cut to: Ships Engine Room. Bender throws the dark matter into 
the boiler.</info>

<info>Cut to: Ships Cockpit. The fuel gauge fills up, Leela throttles 
forward and the ship lifts off, moments before the ground collapses. 
They fly away from the planet and it explodes. The crew cheer.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
We made it!  And some of the animals 
survived.</speak>

<info>She looks through the binoculars and sees some animals standing 
on a tiny fragment of rock.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
So a couple of animals didn't die and 
Leela got lucky. That's what I call 
a successful mission!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
We're heroes!</speak>

<info>Leela's Quarters. Leela writes in her diary. Nibbler is on her 
lap and she is stroking him.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
<info>(thinking)</info> Dear Captain's Diary. I may 
not have found love on this mission 
but I did find a cute little companion 
who excretes starship fuel. And that's 
just as good.</speak>

<info>She pauses for a moment then tears the page out, screws it up 
and throws it in the bin.</info>

<info>Outside Nimbus.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Captain's journal; star date...uh...</speak>

<info>Kif sighs.</info>

<speak who="KIF">
April 13th.</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
April 13th...point two.</speak>

<info>Cut to: Nimbus Bridge.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
We have failed to uphold Brannigan's 
Law. However, I did make it with a hot 
alien babe. And in the end is that not 
what man has dreamt of since first he 
looked up at the stars? Kif, I'm asking 
you a question!</speak>

<info>Kif sighs.</info>

<info>THE END</info></xml>
