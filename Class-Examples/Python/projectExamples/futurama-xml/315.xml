               <note>Smith steps out into the road and is hit by a car. He wakes 
               up in a casino in front of a one armed bandit. He pulls the lever 
               and three bars come up. The machine spews coins out into his 
               lap. He laughs.</note>

                         I just saw something incredibly cool. 
                         A big floating ball that lit up with 
                         every colour of the rainbow, plus some 
                         new ones that were so beautiful I fell 
                         to my knees and cried.

                         It's simple. You can download a celebrity's 
                         personality and appearance into a blank 
                         robot.

                         Humans dating robots is sick. You people 
                         wonder why I'm still single?? It's 'cause 
                         all the fun robot sisters are dating 
                         humans!

                         Bender, this is Fry's decision. And 
                         he made it wrong, so it's time for us 
                         to interfere in his life.

                         Gee Mavis, your house is across the 
                         street, that's an awfully long way to 
                         go for making out.

                         Did you notice what went wrong in that 
                         scene? Ordinarily Billy would work hard 
                         to make money from his paper route then 
                         he'd use the money to buy dinner for 
                         Mavis, thus earning the slim chance 
                         of performing the reproductive act. 
                         But in a world where teens can date 
                         robots why should he bother? Why should 
                         anyone bother? Let's take a look at 
                         Billy's planet a year later.  Where 
                         are all the football stars?  And where 
                         are the biochemists?  They are trapped 
                         - trapped in a soft, vice-like grip 
                         of robot lips. All civilisation was 
                         just an effort to impress the opposite 
                         sex. And sometimes the same sex. Now, 
                         let's skip forward 80 years into the 
                         future. Where is Billy?
 
               
               <note>The scene changes to a post-apocalyptic world. Billy is an aged 
               man but he is still with his Monroebot and still making out with 
               her.</note>

                         The next day Billy's planet was destroyed 
                         by aliens.  Have you guessed the name 
                         of Billy's planet? It was Earth. Don't
