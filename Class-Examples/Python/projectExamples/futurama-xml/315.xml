Of This Episode.</info>

<info>Planet Express: Lounge. The Scary Door opening credits roll.</info>

<info>Smith steps out into the road and is hit by a car. He wakes 
up in a casino in front of a one armed bandit. He pulls the lever 
and three bars come up. The machine spews coins out into his 
lap. He laughs.</info>

<speak who="SMITH"><info>ON TV</info>
A casino where I'm winning? That car 
must've killed me. I must be in heaven! 
A casino where I always win? That's 
boring. I must really be...in hell!</speak>

<info>A bearded man appears at his side.</info>

<speak who="MAN"><info>ON TV</info>
No Mr Smith. You're not in heaven or 
hell. You're on an aeroplane.</speak>

<info>He pulls a curtain across. Smith looks out the window and sees 
a gremlin tearing up the plane's wing.</info>

<speak who="SMITH"><info>ON TV</info>
There's a gremlin destroying the plane! 
You've gotta believe me!</speak>

<speak who="MAN"><info>ON TV</info>
Why should I believe you? You're Hitler!</speak>

<info>He holds up a mirror. Smith's reflection is indeed that of Hitler.</info>

<speak who="SMITH"><info>ON TV</info>
No!  Eva Braun! Help me!</speak>

<info>She takes of her facemask, revealing she is a human-fly. Smith 
screams. All of the Planet Express crew except Fry sit watching 
the TV.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Saw it comin'!</speak>

<info>Enter Fry.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
I just saw something incredibly cool. 
A big floating ball that lit up with 
every colour of the rainbow, plus some 
new ones that were so beautiful I fell 
to my knees and cried.</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
Was it out in front of Discount Shoe 
Outlet?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Yeah.</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
They have a college kid wear that to 
attract customers.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Well I don't care if it was some dork 
in a costume. For one brief moment I 
felt the heartbeat of creation. And 
it was one with my own.</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
Big deal.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
We all feel like that all the time. 
You don't hear us gassin' on about it.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
How can you people be so blase? Here 
you are in the year 3000 or so, yet 
you just sit around like its the boring 
time I came from.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Boring? Wasn't that the period where 
they cracked the human genome and boy 
bands roamed the Earth?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Yeah. But now its the distant future. 
Why aren't we out doing everything I 
ever dreamed of?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Hey, you know what might be fun?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
No. Why would I know that?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Let's take the rest of the morning off 
and take Fry to do everything he ever 
wanted to do.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
<info>(sexfully)</info> Everything?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Except that.</speak>

<info>A huge space station orbits a big green planet. "Sal's Wrecking 
Co" is painted on the side.</info>

<info>Cut to: Sal's Wrecking Co. Sal straps Fry into a seat.</info>

<speak who="SAL">
Sos your fantasy's always been to destroys 
a planet huh?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Yeah, what did they ever do for me?</speak>

<info>He aims a gun at the planet, fires and blows the planet to smitherenes. 
He laughs while the crew look on with blank expressions.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Wow, the most humdrum activities look 
almost exciting through your eyes. What 
should we do next?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
I wanna see the edge of the universe!</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
Ooo! That sounds cool.</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
It's funny. You live in the universe, 
but you never do these things til somebody 
comes to visit.</speak>

<info>The Edge Of The Universe. The ship approaches a black/white 
boundary.</info>

<info>The ship cruises towards the edge of space and lands in a parking 
space. The crew get out and walk to a wall seperating space from 
the nothingness after it. Fry puts some money in some binoculars 
and looks through them. He sees a Planet Express from a parallel 
cowboy universe wave. Our crew wave back.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Far out! So, there's an infinite number 
of parallel universes?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
No, just the two.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Oh, well, I'm sure that's enough.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
I'm sick of parallel Bender lording 
his cowboy head over me! Let's move 
on to Fry's next fantasy.</speak>

<info>Jurassic Kiddie Park. Fry rides a Tyranosaurus Rex.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
<info>(shouting)</info> Yeehah! Bow before your master, 
puny mortals! Whoo! Giddy-up! Ha ha! 
Woohoo! Whoopie!</speak>

<info>A mother and daughter look on.</info>

<speak who="GIRL">
Mommy, why is that man like that?</speak>

<speak who="MOTHER">
Don't look at him!</speak>

<info>Fry dismounts and hops over the wall to his friends.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
That was fun. Let's give him a treat!</speak>

<info>He puts 5 cents in a Dino-Feed machine and gets a pig out of 
it. He holds it up to the dinosaur which walks over to it. The 
pig squeals.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Keep your palms flat.</speak>

<info>The dinosaur gobbles up the pig. Fry laughs.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
The tongue tickles.</speak>

<info>He laughs some more. He pulls his arms down - but his hands 
aren't there.</info>

<info>Outside Hand Crafters. The crew leave the store. Fry's new hands 
have a slightly darker skin tone.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
These new hands are great. I'm gonna 
break them in tonight.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Yes it's been quite an hour and a half.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
I've only got two fantasies left: Be 
invisible in a chocolate factory and 
be romantically linked with a celebrity.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
I could pound your head 'til you thinks 
that's what happened.</speak>

<info>He pulls an iron bar out of his chest cabinet.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
OK.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Wait, hold on. It is actually possible 
to meet any celebrity you want.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
It is?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Of course! You should read a blimp sometime.</speak>

<info>She points to a passing blimp advertising downloadable celebrities 
at nappster.com.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Download a celebrity from the internet? 
What part of that do I understand?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
It's simple. You can download a celebrity's 
personality and appearance into a blank 
robot.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Hey, I have an idea. Let's do that!</speak>

<info>Planet Express: Farnsworth's Lab. Leela and Fry put on the net 
suits.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Onto the internet you go!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Oh and while you're there pick me up 
a few credit card numbers.</speak>

<info>Farnsworth logs Fry and Leela in.</info>

<info>Cut to: Internet Browser. Fry and Leela materialise outside 
pentagon.web, a top secret site which has just been hacked. They 
walk past oldtrek-vs-newtrek.web where two trekkies have an important 
debate.</info>

<speak who="TREKKIE #1">
No way! Kirk could kick Picard's ass!</speak>

<speak who="TREKKIE #2">
Eh, at least Picard had the guts to 
admit he was bald!</speak>

<speak who="TREKKIE #1">
You take that back!</speak>

<info>Fry and Leela come to eBay.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Ooo! eBay!</speak>

<info>Cut to: eBay. The Milky Way galaxy is up for sale.</info>

<speak who="AUCTIONEER">
Are there no further bids for this exquisite 
galaxy?  Sold to the Being Of Inconceivable 
Horror.</speak>

<info>The Being Of Inconceivable Horror laughs.</info>

<speak who="AUCTIONEER">
Yes.</speak>

<info>The Being Of Inconceivable Horror laughs harder.</info>

<info>Cut to: Internet Browser.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
So where's the celebrity dating place?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Let's search the web.  Over there.</speak>

<info>Leela and Fry walk inside nappster.com.</info>

<info>Cut to: nappster.com.</info>

<speak who="SALESMAN">
Welcome to Nappster. Let's see what 
celebrities we've got in stock.  Can 
I interest you in Gwyneth Paltrow?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Nah. I read in Newsweek that she drinks 
human blood.</speak>

<speak who="SALESMAN">
Then uh, how about Cleopatra? Who's 
beauty destroyed mighty empires.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
I'd prefer someone from the era of shaved 
underarms. Do you have anything with 
a more Lucy Liu feel to it?</speak>

<speak who="SALESMAN">
Nah, nothing like that. Though we do 
have Lucy Liu.  Only woman ever to be 
named People magazine's woman of the 
year twice. In 2003, and then again 
in 2063.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
I'd like the 2003 model.</speak>

<info>An image of Lucy Liu appears.</info>

<info>Cut to: Planet Express: Farnsworth's Lab. Fry and Leela takes 
off their net helmets.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Wahoo! I've found her! What do I do 
now?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Download her. Let's just put a blank 
robot in the drive.</speak>

<info>He lifts a basic robot out of a box of ten and hands it to Fry. 
Fry puts it in the drive. Lucy Liu is downloaded from the net 
and she appears on the robot. Fry gasps.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
It worked!</speak>

<speak who="LIUBOT">
You're one sexy man <info>(mechanical voice)</info> 
Philip J. Fry!</speak>

<info>She leaps into his arms and kisses him. She pushes him to the 
floor.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
<info>(muffled)</info> It worked perfectly!</speak>

<info>Time Lapse. Fry is still dumbstruck and he gazes at his Liubot 
with his mouth wide open.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Well, you downloaded Lucy Liu. Are you 
just going to stare vacantly at her 
and not say anything?</speak>

<info>Fry guffaws.</info>

<speak who="LIUBOT">
I find your slack-jawed stare very attractive 
<info>(mechanical voice)</info> Philip J. Fry.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Did you hear that? She likes me!</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Well duh! She's programmed to like you!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
But this is Lucy Liu! Perhaps the only 
good actress of the 21st century! She's 
more than just a piece of software.</speak>

<speak who="LIUBOT">
Would you like to take a moment to register 
me?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Uh, not right now.</speak>

<speak who="LIUBOT">
I'll remind you later you hot stud you!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
So uh, what do you feel like doing?</speak>

<speak who="LIUBOT">
Would you like to take a moment to register 
me?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
I said later!</speak>

<info>Dinkin' Donuts. Fry and the Liubot are on a date. Fry is gobbling 
donuts.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Then when I feel so stuffed I can't 
eat anymore, I just use the restroom, 
and then I can eat more.</speak>

<speak who="LIUBOT">
You should write a book Fry. People 
need to know about the <info>(mechanical voice)</info> 
can eat more.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Oh Lucy! You're just like I always thought 
you'd be from your movies.</speak>

<speak who="LIUBOT">
My personality is mathematically derived 
from my movies, proportionally weighted 
by box office receipts.</speak>

<info>Fry stares blankly then bites into a donut.</info>

<info>Montage Fry and the Liubot date to Wham!'s Love Machine. First 
they drop steaks into the octopus tank at the Brooklyn Aquarium 
and the octopus eats it a wiggles it's tentacles around. Next 
Fry eats a hotdog while the Liubot runs down a street with him 
on her shoulders. In the Planet Express lounge Fry has a toy 
soldier war. He throws one at a fan and it richochets off in 
another direction. Liubot dives on Fry and pushes him under the 
table.</info>

<info>Time Lapse. Fry and Liubot are sat on the couch.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
You're cute!</speak>

<speak who="LIUBOT">
You're cute!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
You!</speak>

<speak who="LIUBOT">
You!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
You!</speak>

<speak who="LIUBOT">
You!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
You!</speak>

<info>The rest of the crew watch in horror.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Oh dear! She's stuck in an infinite 
loop and he's an idiot. Well, that's 
love for you.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Humans dating robots is sick. You people 
wonder why I'm still single?? It's 'cause 
all the fun robot sisters are dating 
humans!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Bender, this is Fry's decision. And 
he made it wrong, so it's time for us 
to interfere in his life.</speak>

<info>Planet Express: Meeting Room. Leela breaks the news to Fry.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
She doesn't really love you. She can't. 
She's just a machine that -</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Well, so what if I love a robot? It's 
not hurting anybody.</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
My God! He never took middle school 
hygiene. He never saw the propaganda 
film.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
It's just lucky I keep a copy in the 
VCR at all times!</speak>

<info>He presses a button and a film title appears on the screen: 
I Dated A Robot!. In the movie a couple sit in a caf� and stare 
into each other's eyes. A narrator walks into the scene.</info>

<speak who="NARRATOR"><info>IN MOVIE</info>
Ordinary human dating. It's enjoyable 
and it serves an important purpose. 
But when a human dates an artificial 
mate, there is no purpose. Only enjoyment. 
And that leads to...tragedy.</speak>

<info>The woman behind him turns into a blank robot and the man downloads 
a celebrity onto it.</info>

<speak who="BILLY"><info>IN MOVIE</info>
Neato! A Marylin Monroebot!</speak>

<speak who="MONROEBOT"><info>IN MOVIE</info>
Ooo! You're a real dreamboat (mechanical 
voice) Billy Everyteen!</speak>

<speak who="NARRATOR"><info>IN MOVIE</info>
Harmless fun? Let's see what happens 
next!</speak>

<info>The scene cuts to Billy's bedroom. He is kissing the Monroebot. 
Enter his mother.</info>

<speak who="BILLY"><info>IN MOVIE</info>
No thank Mom, I'd rather make out with 
my Monroebot.</speak>

<info>Enter his dad.</info>

<speak who="BILLY"><info>IN MOVIE</info>
No thanks dad, I'd rather make out with 
my Monroebot.</speak>

<info>Enter his girlfriend, Mavis, from the caf�.</info>

<speak who="MAVIS"><info>IN MOVIE</info>
Billy, do you want to come over tonight? 
We can make out together.</speak>

<speak who="BILLY"><info>IN MOVIE</info>
Gee Mavis, your house is across the 
street, that's an awfully long way to 
go for making out.</speak>

<speak who="NARRATOR"><info>IN MOVIE</info>
Did you notice what went wrong in that 
scene? Ordinarily Billy would work hard 
to make money from his paper route then 
he'd use the money to buy dinner for 
Mavis, thus earning the slim chance 
of performing the reproductive act. 
But in a world where teens can date 
robots why should he bother? Why should 
anyone bother? Let's take a look at 
Billy's planet a year later.  Where 
are all the football stars?  And where 
are the biochemists?  They are trapped 
- trapped in a soft, vice-like grip 
of robot lips. All civilisation was 
just an effort to impress the opposite 
sex. And sometimes the same sex. Now, 
let's skip forward 80 years into the 
future. Where is Billy?</speak>

<info>The scene changes to a post-apocalyptic world. Billy is an aged 
man but he is still with his Monroebot and still making out with 
her.</info>

<speak who="BILLY"><info>IN MOVIE</info>
Farewell!</speak>

<info>He dies.</info>

<speak who="NARRATOR"><info>IN MOVIE</info>
The next day Billy's planet was destroyed 
by aliens.  Have you guessed the name 
of Billy's planet? It was Earth. Don't 
Date Robots!</speak>

<info>A caption appears on the screen with the same words on it and 
the movie ends. The space pope is displayed on the screen with 
Crocodylus Pontiflex written around him in English and alien.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Did that make any impression on you 
Fry? Fry?</speak>

<info>She turns around. Fry and Liubot are making out. Liubot giggles.</info>

<speak who="LIUBOT">
Ooo!</speak>

<info>Farnsworth holds up another tape.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
I knew I should have shown him Electro 
Gonhorrhea: The Noisy Killer.</speak>

<info>Planet Express: Lounge. Bender sits in a chair with his legs 
crosses holding a cigar. He puts on a weird voice as he speaks.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
What is the world coming to? That Fry's 
a sicko pervert I tell you, dating a 
robot. It's an atrosmacy.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
But Fry's our friend Bender.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Aww jeez would you stifle there meatbag?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
You stifle Bender.</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Hooray! Finally you're standing up to 
him.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Although he is completely right.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
We've got to stem this tidal wave of 
moral decay. It's time to shut down 
nappster.com!</speak>

<info>Nappster HQ. Enter Bender, Leela and Zoidberg.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Who's in charge of this dump?</speak>

<info>Jeff Jervis CEO stands up.</info>

<speak who="JERVIS">
That'd be me. If you're an investor 
you can dump your money in the hole 
there.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Listen you fat internet nerd.</speak>

<speak who="JERVIS">
Listening.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Your company promotes wrong love! If 
you don't shut down right now the only 
thing wired about you will be your jaw!</speak>

<speak who="JERVIS">
You can't shut us down. The internet 
is about the free exchange and sale 
of other people's ideas. We've done 
nothing wrong!</speak>

<info>Lucy Liu suddenly cries out from behind a door marked Authorized 
Personnel Only.</info>

<speak who="LIU"><info>FROM ROOM</info>
Help! I'm being held prisoner!</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Someone in trouble is!</speak>

<speak who="JERVIS">
No stay out! There's a guy going for 
the Tetris world record in there!</speak>

<info>He covers the door with himself and part of a sign covering 
the nappster sign falls away. Nappster is really kidnappster! 
Bender pushes Jervis out the way and he Leela and Zoidberg run 
in.</info>

<info>Cut to: Kidnappster HQ. The room is filled with heads in jars.</info>

<speak who="WOMAN">
Who are you?</speak>

<speak who="CHEECH">
Don't hurt us!</speak>

<speak who="LIU">
Help me! They've been holding me prisoner 
for 800 years!</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
The real Lucy Liu! The one you can see 
a movie of in the popcorn stadium!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
So what's your problem?</speak>

<speak who="LIU">
Those sweaty nerds are making illegal 
copies of us. <info>(crying)</info> It hurts!</speak>

<info>Jervis knocks on the door.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Its a bluff.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
We can't take that chance. Move people 
move!</speak>

<speak who="GEORGE MICHAEL">
Please pick me up before you go go!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
She asked first.</speak>

<info>She picks up Liu's jar and activates a pressure alarm. She replaces 
Liu's jar with that of Madeline Albright. Someone downloads her 
and she screams.</info>

<info>Cut to: Nerd's Bedroom. Albright is downloaded onto a blank 
robot. There is a table and candles in the room.</info>

<speak who="NERD">
Uh, are you Lucy Liu?</speak>

<info>The Albrightbot sees the table and smiles.</info>

<speak who="ALBRIGHTBOT">
Sure!</speak>

<info>Outside Nappster HQ. Bender, Leela and Zoidberg climb out of 
a window with Liu's head and run away.</info>

<info>Cut to: Nappster HQ. Jervis and another man watch them on the 
screen.</info>

<speak who="JERVIS">
Oh we're doomed. They got the head, 
they uncovered the sign! Soon the whole 
world will learn we're cyber criminals! 
And we would have gotten away with it 
if it weren't for those meddling adults.</speak>

<speak who="MAN">
We'll stop them. They like Lucy Liu, 
we'll give them all the Lucy Liu they 
can handle! Hand me that backup disk.</speak>

<info>He puts the disk in the drive and changes the Liu-Mo-Tron setting 
to Erotic Assassin.</info>

<info>Cut to: Street.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Did you see me escaping? I was like 
-</speak>

<info>He woops.</info>

<speak who="LIU">
Thanks for rescuing me, especially you 
Bender. <info>(sexfully)</info> Mmm, quite a masculine 
piece of metal aren't you?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Hey don't look at me like that. If you're 
thinking of crossing the line with Bender 
you can forget it. Bender don't bend 
that way.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Hey look its another Lucy Liubot.</speak>

<speak who="LIUBOT #2">
<info>(mechanical voice)</info> I am Lucy Liu. Give 
me your spines.</speak>

<info>She leaps into the air and lands between the four.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Hey what the?</speak>

<info>She kicks him. She moves towards Bender and he backs away. She 
starts punching him.</info>

<speak who="LIUBOT #2">
<info>(mechanical voice)</info> Take this and that 
and one of these.</speak>

<info>She grabs him between her legs and slams him against the pavement.</info>

<speak who="LIU">
Hey cut it out! I don't need this kind 
of publicity!</speak>

<info>The Liubot gets up and moves towards Leela. She kicks her in 
the face and trips her over. She gets up.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Alright Liu. Time to kick your frosty 
well toned ass! Heyya!</speak>

<info>She kicks her and the two get into a fight. Leela gains the 
upper hand and kicks the Liubot against a fire hydrant.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Then along came Bender!</speak>

<info>He turns the fire hydrant on and the Liubot starts to inflate.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Looks like you're retaining water.</speak>

<info>He snips it with his claws and it explodes. They cheer.</info>

<speak who="LIU">
That was incredible Bender. You're like 
Jackie Chan before he got all doughy.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Aw shucks. I wasn't afraid of that robot. 
I'm pretty brave when you get past my 
macho exterior!  It's an army of Lucy 
Lius!</speak>

<info>Leela and Zoidberg scream.</info>

<speak who="LIU">
They're horrible!</speak>

<info>The Liubots start flipping over cars and kicking over mailboxes.</info>

<info>A Liubot throws a man through a window.</info>

<info>Cut to: Newsstand. The Liubots chase people down the streets. 
Zapp Brannigan turns on the sexlexia.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Now that's a wave of destruction that's 
easy on the eyes.</speak>

<info>A Liubot grabs him by the throat.</info>

<info>She throws him across the street and he gets stuck between a 
sewer grate.</info>

<info>Loew's-N-Plex. Fry and his Liubot are at the cinema watching 
the 2007 classic Charlie's Angels III: The Legend Of Charlie's 
Gold.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
This is the best movie I've ever seen. 
It has a vampire and an explosion!</speak>

<speak who="LIUBOT">
It's amazing the way you (mechanical 
voice) notice two things.</speak>

<speak who="ALEX"><info>IN MOVIE</info>
No! Don't open that coffin! It's ticking!</speak>

<speak who="NATALIE"><info>IN MOVIE</info>
I have to Alex. That coffin's not going 
to open itself!</speak>

<info>The coffin opens itself. A vampire sits up.</info>

<speak who="VAMPIRE"><info>IN MOVIE</info>
Bleurgh!</speak>

<info>He explodes. Fry and Liubot are making out again. Enter Bender, 
Leela, Zoidberg and Lucy Liu.</info>

<speak who="LIU">
Let's hide in here. It'll add to my 
box office gross!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Fry?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Aww, you guys came to watch me make 
out! That is so sweet.  Wait a minute! 
Is that the head of who I think it's 
of?</speak>

<speak who="LIU">
Read the jar Evelyn Wood! Dr Z?</speak>

<info>Zoidberg clacks.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Fry, a herd of Lucy Liu are destroying 
the city. Is yours acting normally?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Let me see.  Yep. Why do you ask?</speak>

<speak who="ALEX"><info>IN MOVIE</info>
Mr Mayor, if you want to see a real 
vampire look in the mirror!</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Why?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
And Nappster says illegal copies never 
hurt anybody.</speak>

<speak who="FRY"><info>(SHOUTING)</info>
Quick, this way!</speak>

<info>They all run to the projector room. The Liubots follow.</info>

<info>Cut to: Corridor. Fry stops and so do the Liubots. He picks 
up a sign.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Sorry laides, employees only.</speak>

<info>A Liubot eats the sign. Fry screams and runs up the stairs. 
They run after him. He runs into the projector room and closes 
the door behind him.</info>

<info>Cut to: Projector Room.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Oh no. They're forming a human pyramid...of 
robots.</speak>

<info>The Liubots climb on each other.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Dammit! We weren't counting on them 
being as smart as they are sexy!</speak>

<speak who="LIU">
A dangerous mistake to make.</speak>

<info>Zoidberg presses a button and a door opens. A huge bag of popcorn 
is behind it.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
At least we've got food.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Dr Zoidberg cut open that bag!</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Hooray!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
And don't eat it.</speak>

<info>Zoidberg sighs and cuts the bag. He is knocked over by the high 
pressure popcorn that shoots out from the bag. The popcorn flies 
out the window and knocks over the pyramid of Liubots.</info>

<info>The Liubots are completely submerged under popcorn. Everyone 
cheers.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Life was bad but now its good forever!</speak>

<info>The Liubots eat their way out of the popcorn and start firing 
it at the projector room. Everyone screams and ducks.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
You'll be safe in here sweetheart.  
Get lost Pavorotti!</speak>

<info>He throws the head over his shoulder and puts Liu's head in.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Lucy Liubot, if I don't survive the 
corn I want you to know that I love 
you as much as a man can love a computerised 
image of gorgeous celebrity. Which it 
turns out is a lot.</speak>

<speak who="LIUBOT">
Oh Fry, I love you more than the moon 
and the stars and the <info>(mechanincal voice)</info> 
poetic image number 37 not found.</speak>

<info>She stands up and the popcorn starts hitting her. She starts 
walking towards the projection window.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
What are you doing darling? Get down!</speak>

<info>The Liubot points the projector at the other Liubots. They starts 
to swell up.</info>

<info>They explode. Fry's Liubot flickers on the floor.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
You saved us. Are you alright?</speak>

<speak who="LIUBOT">
Yes my love. I'll be just (mechanical 
voice) massive corn clog in port seven.</speak>

<speak who="LIU">
Are you the last copy of me?</speak>

<speak who="LIUBOT">
Yes.</speak>

<speak who="LIU">
Erase her Fry.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
What?? No!</speak>

<speak who="LIU">
Fry, when you downloaded her without 
my permission you stole my image. And 
in the end that's all I really have. 
That and the largest gold nugget in 
the world - one mile in diameter.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
But I just downloaded her because I 
love you.</speak>

<speak who="LIU">
If you love the real Lucy Liu and not 
what you've seen in movies, genre stradling 
lawyer shows and kiss ass articles in 
People magazine, you'll blank out that 
robot.</speak>

<info>Fry starts to cry. The Liubot flickers.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
I'm sorry. Hug me Liubot.</speak>

<info>She does. Fry reaches behind her hair and presses the erase 
button.</info>

<speak who="LIUBOT">
I'll always remember you Fry (mechanical 
voice) memory deleted.</speak>

<info>Her image flickers away just leaving a battered blank robot.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
I know it hurts buddy. But at least 
you're not in a sick relationship with 
a robot anymore.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Uh huh. And I guess now maybe I can 
get to know the real Lucy Liu.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Pft! Yeah at our wedding!</speak>

<speak who="LIU">
It's true. Bender and I are in love.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
But, but!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Don't be a prude Fry!</speak>

<info>He kisses Liu's jar while Fry looks on, eyes twitching.</info>

<info>THE END</info></xml>
