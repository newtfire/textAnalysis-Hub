               <note>Ship's Cockpit. The ship flies towards a star and stops a short 
               distance from it. Bender, Leela and Farnsworth are sat on the 
               couch. Fry and Zoidberg stand at either side.</note>

                         I've never seen a supernova blow up. 
                         But if it's anything like my old Chevy 
                         Nova, it'll light up the night sky!

                         could you go make some popcorn?

               rapidly moves backwards from September 21st 3002. The ship passes 
               hundreds of different types of clocks. The timehole opens again 
               and ship emerges, the crew dazed and disorientated.</note>

                         Yes we tore the universe a new space-hole 
                         alright! But it's clenching shut fast. 
                         Our only hope of getting back to our 
                         own time is to go through it in oh say......exactly 
                         24 hours.

                         No problem. The ship's fixed except 
                         for the cup holder and I think I can 
                         have that operational within 10 hours.

                         You've got 8. But a more urgent concern 
                         is the microwave.  Without a working 
                         one we have no hope of returning to 
                         the future.

                         Well, I'm sure we can buy a microwave 
                         from somewhere around here.  Meanwhile 
                         you guys sneak onto the army base and 
                         rescue Bender's body.

                         Oh, poor Bender. He must be so lonely 
                         right now. Trapped a thousand years 
                         in the past. Hey! Wait a second!

                         He's alive!  Bender. What was it like 
                         lying in that hole for a thousand years?

                         Well, now everything is back as it was. 
                         And if history doesn't care that out 
                         degenerate friend Fry is his own grandfather, 
                         then who are we to judge?
