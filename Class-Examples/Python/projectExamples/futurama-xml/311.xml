<info>Planet Express: Lounge. On the TV, Morbo and Linda present an 
early morning breakfast programme called Good Morning Earth. 
They are wearing pyjamas and sit in a cosy sitting room set.</info>

<speak who="MORBO">
...So I gave the cookies to Fawn and 
the kids and they couldn't believe it 
-- they were delicious. But, I digress. 
<info>(shouting)</info> Tremble, puny earthlings! 
One day my race will destroy you all!</speak>

<info>Leela, Fry and Bender eat while they watch. The doorbell rings.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Could one of you guys get that?</speak>

<info>They both shake their heads she narrows her eye at them.</info>

<info>Planet Express: Entrance Foyer. Leela opens the door and looks 
around but there doesn't appear to be anyone there. She hears 
a squealing noise, looks down and gasps.</info>

<info>Cut to: Outside Planet Express.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
It's a doorbell baby!  Hello, little 
guy. You know, I was abandoned as a 
baby too, so --</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Garbage, huh? I'll take care of it.</speak>

<info>He starts stamping on the basket.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Bender, stop! It's a baby!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
A baby what?  Ow!</speak>

<info>Leela bends down and unwraps the blankets. There is no baby 
inside. Instead, there is a green card with a sad looking kid 
on it holding up an empty food dish. Written along the top of 
the card is "Cookieville Minimum-Security Orphanariumï¿½.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Oh, it's just a card -- from the orphanarium 
I grew up in.</speak>

<info>The card speaks with a child's voice.</info>

<speak who="CARD">
Leela, you're invited to reunion at 
Cookieville Minimum-Security Orphanarium. 
Please stand clear of self-destructing 
basket.</speak>

<info>The basket explodes.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
A reunion at your old orphanarium, eh? 
You gonna go?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
No way, jose-bot. I never wanna see 
those other orphans again! Not after 
the way they used to pick on me.</speak>

<info>Flashback: In the kids' playground at the orphanarium (where 
everything is broken) the kids stand around young Leela, pointing 
and chanting.</info>

<speak who="KIDS">
<info>(chanting)</info> One-eye! One-eye! One-eye!</speak>

<speak who="KIRK">
Nice depth-perception, one-eye!</speak>

<info>He laughs.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
How can you make fun of me, Kirk? You're 
blind!</speak>

<speak who="KIRK">
My eyes may not work, but at least I 
got two of them!</speak>

<info>He laughs again. Leela sighs.</info>

<info>Flashback ends.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Aww. That's terrible, Leela. But imagine 
the look on their faces when you show 
up with two friends who eat all the 
hors d'oeuvres.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Well, I wouldn't mind rubbing my success 
in a few choice faces.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Set a course for adventure!</speak>

<info>Cookieville Minimum-Security Orphanarium Lobby. There a broken, 
leaking pipes running across the ceiling, the windows are barred 
up and owls scavenge around the floor. Leela is wearing a purple 
suit.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Eww!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
What a dump!</speak>

<info>Leela sighs.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Just like old times. Gosh. The bars 
on the windows seemed so much thicker 
back then.  Mr. Vogel? Remember me?</speak>

<speak who="VOGEL">
Leela! You're worthless and no one will 
ever love you!</speak>

<info>They both laugh.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
You used to say that all the time!</speak>

<speak who="VOGEL">
Oh, those were happier days.</speak>

<info>Cookieville Minimum-Security Orphanarium Gymnasium. A "Welcome, 
Orphans" banner has been strung up across the ceiling and the 
room has been decorated with balloons and streamers. There is 
a sign that says "Please Abandon Coats In Lobby" next to the 
buffet table where Fry and Bender stand.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Mmm! The gristle-in-a-blanket isn't 
half bad.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Mmm! And try one of these Popsicle sticks. 
They've absorbed quite a bit of flavour.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Hey, look. It's our old group picture.</speak>

<info>They look at a black and white photo of the orphans and a younger 
Vogel. Fry squints.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
I don't see you anywhere.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
That's me over in Cootietown.</speak>

<info>She points at herself, standing apart from the group. Bender 
points at someone in the back row.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Whoa! Get a load of this average-looking 
guy!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
That's Adlai Atkins. I used to have 
kind of a crush on him.</speak>

<info>Flashback. The scene continues from earlier with the kids still 
chanting.</info>

<speak who="KIDS">
<info>(chanting)</info> One-eye! One-eye!</speak>

<speak who="FRENCH GUY">
Stupid as a French guy!</speak>

<speak who="KIDS">
<info>(chanting)</info> One-eye! One-eye! One-eye! 
One-eye! One-eye! One-eye! One-eye! 
One-eye!</speak>

<info>Adlai chants with the others and Leela looks at him with lovey 
eyes and sighs.</info>

<info>Flashback ends.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Well, it's time to say hello to the 
old gang.</speak>

<info>She gulps down her drink, then Bender's and then the water from 
a vase of flowers. On the other side of the gym, the orphans 
have turned into bums.</info>

<speak who="MAN #1">
So, watcha been up to since you left 
the orphanarium?</speak>

<speak who="MAN #2">
Uh, living in a box, fighting the shakes. 
You?</speak>

<speak who="MAN #1">
Selling kidneys, teeth; whatever falls 
out of me.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
And what am I up to, you ask? Well I'm 
a very successful space captain.</speak>

<speak who="MAN #2">
Oh.</speak>

<speak who="MAN #1">
Wow.</speak>

<speak who="MAN #3">
How nice for you, Leela.</speak>

<speak who="WOMAN">
<info>(patronising)</info> That's so good for a person 
with one eye.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Hey! You can't feel sorry for me! I'm 
a space captain and you're all a bunch 
of losers.</speak>

<speak who="MAN #1">
Uh, right, right. We're the losers!</speak>

<info>He coughs and a tooth falls out of his mouth. Kirk arrives.</info>

<speak who="KIRK">
Well, if it isn't old one-eye!</speak>

<info>He laughs.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Oh, yeah? Well, shut up, cane boy!</speak>

<speak who="MAN #3">
He can't hear you. He's deaf now.</speak>

<speak who="ADLAI">
Leave Leela alone. She's leading a perfectly 
normal life. She's not gussied up, duded 
out, getting down or where it's at. 
Now, run along.</speak>

<info>The other five leave.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Thanks, Adlai. I guess you never really 
outgrow being an eyeball -- oddball!</speak>

<speak who="ADLAI">
Nonsense. You're a space captain. That's 
a fine, conventional profession.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Well, you know. It's just for a package 
delivery service.</speak>

<speak who="ADLAI">
Ah-ah. A package is just a box until 
it's delivered.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Huh. I'd never thought of it that way. 
So what do you do these days?</speak>

<speak who="ADLAI">
Oh, I'm a doctor.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
A tall doctor, you say?</speak>

<info>She brushes her fingers through her hair. At the bar, Bender 
drinks down one glass while another is being refilled. Vogel 
stands behind Fry with 12 kids.</info>

<speak who="VOGEL">
Sir, you seem pretty stable. Have you 
thought about adopting one of our kids?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Sure haven't.</speak>

<speak who="VOGEL">
Well keep adoption in mind. It's a great 
way to have kids without having sex.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
<info>(thoughtful)</info> Really?</speak>

<speak who="VOGEL">
Plus, the government will help out with 
a small stipend of $100 a week.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
$100 a week?</speak>

<info>He spits out his drink, has it refilled, drinks it and spits 
it out again. Aldai and Leela look at the group photos.</info>

<speak who="ADLAI">
I'm so sorry I teased you back then. 
Let me make it up to you. I can fix 
it so that no one ever makes fun of 
you again.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
You mean by beating them up? Because 
I've broken that blind kid's nose like 
10 times and it doesn't make any difference.</speak>

<speak who="ADLAI">
No, I specialise in phaser eye surgery. 
I can build you a paraffin eye and graft 
it on with skin from your foot. It won't 
be able to see but you'll look like 
a perfectly normal two-eyed person.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Me? Perfectly normal?</speak>

<info>She touches her eye and it squelches. Fry eats more of the hors 
d'oeuvres and turns around when he hears laughing kids. Bender 
is with the kids.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Sons, daughters, meet Uncle Fry.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Hey, why are those kids following you? 
Do you have candy stuck to your ass?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
No. It's called parenting. Come on, 
dumplings. We've got 12 government stipends 
to collect.</speak>

<speak who="KIDS">
<info>(cheering)</info> Yay!</speak>

<speak who="BOY">
Our daddy's a giant toy!</speak>

<info>Planet Express: Meeting Room. The staff sit around the conference 
table.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Phaser eye surgery is a capital idea. 
I'm sure Leela's tired of morons gaping 
at her eye all the time.</speak>

<info>He stares open-mouthed at her.</info>

<speak who="AMY">
I think cosmetic surgery's great, Leela. 
I used to be too cute, so I had cuteness-reduction 
surgery here......and here.</speak>

<info>She points to her nose.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
You guys are crazy. Leela doesn't need 
surgery. You look great the way you 
are.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Oh, that's so sweet, Fry. But for once 
in my life, I just wanna look normal.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
But you're better than normal, you're 
abnormal. If you ask me, you shouldn't 
care what other people think.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
You're right! I'll start by not caring 
what you think!  I'm getting the surgery.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Thatagirl!</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
Right on!</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Wonderful. And while you're under the 
knife, you could also get an ink pouch 
to help you escape your enemies.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
That's the stupidest idea I've ever 
heard you imbecile!</speak>

<info>He raises a rolled-up newspaper at Zoidberg. Zoidberg sprays 
ink at his face and runs off, whooping.</info>

<info>Taco Bellevue Hospital. There is a sign outside that says "Normal, 
Healthy Baby? Super-Size It For 49c!" Inside, the Planet Express 
staff and Adlai stand around Leela's bed. The entire top half 
of Leela head is covered with bandages.</info>

<speak who="ADLAI">
Now we'll find out if the operation 
was a success. Hold on to your hats. 
Oh, I'm sorry, this is the wrong patient. 
Oops.</speak>

<info>He scribbles on a new pupil with a marker pen.</info>

<speak who="AMY">
Leela, those eyes look so great on you.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Bah! I think she looked fine before.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
No.</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
Uh-uh.</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
Wrong.</speak>

<info>Leela looks at herself in a mirror.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Wow, look at me. Although I don't have 
the hang of blinking yet.</speak>

<speak who="ADLAI">
You'll get it. Personally, I try not 
to blink too much because it seems flashy. 
But when I do, I enjoy it.</speak>

<info>She tries again and succeeds this time. She gasps.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
I did it! I blunk!</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
And just in time to screw up this picture 
I took!</speak>

<info>He shows her a photo of her blinking.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Hooray!</speak>

<info>Montage Scene. Leela gets accustomed to her new life to Roy 
Orbison's Pretty Woman. She carries a box marked "Leela's Monocles" 
through the front door of her apartment building at drops it 
in the bin. Later, she comes out of the Eye Robot wearing two 
pairs of sunglasses, a pair of binoculars and carrying a pair 
of theatre specs. She walks past Mom's sons and winks at them. 
They stop and bump into each other.</info>

<speak who="WALT">
Ow!</speak>

<speak who="IGNER">
Ow!</speak>

<speak who="LARRY">
Ow!</speak>

<info>Amy shows Leela how to apply eyeliner. She puts it across her 
eyes first and watches Leela try. Leela smears it all the way 
across her brow. Amy shakes her head, licks her finger, and rubs 
it off in the middle. Leela smiles. On the street, Leela bumps 
into Kirk. She takes his hand and feels her face with it. He 
groans with disappointment.</info>

<info>Planet Express: Lounge. Zoidberg, Hermes, Amy and Fry are sat 
on the couch.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
I've never felt so unremarkable! Today 
I actually blended in with a crowd!</speak>

<info>She laughs. Bender walks in with the kids.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Kids, meet the jerkbags I work with.</speak>

<speak who="KIDS">
<info>(chanting)</info> Hello, jerkbags!</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
Oh, they're so cute! What are their 
names?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Kids have names?</speak>

<speak who="NINA">
My name's Nina, and his name's Albert 
--</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
And from now on, you're all named Bender 
Jr.!  Looky here! My first government 
stipend cheque! 12 baby humans, 1200 
wing-wangs!</speak>

<info>Sally, a girl with an ear on her face, tugs Bender's arm.</info>

<speak who="SALLY">
Daddy Bender, we're hungry.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
What is it with you kids? Every other 
day, it's food, food, food!  Oh, fine. 
I'll get you some stupid food.</speak>

<speak who="ALBERT">
Can we have Bender burgers again?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
No. The cat shelter's on to me!</speak>

<info>Planet Express: Hangar. Fry scrubs one of the landing feet and 
Leela welds something along the ships side. Adlai comes in wearing 
a grey Hawaiian shirt.</info>

<speak who="ADLAI">
Hello, Leela. I was in a nearby tailor 
getting one of my Hawaiian shirts toned 
down, so I thought I'd drop in for your 
follow-up exam.</speak>

<info>Leela giggles.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
That's so handsome of you.</speak>

<speak who="ADLAI">
Just follow the light with your eyes. 
Perfect! You know, a guy could fall 
head-over-heels for a gal like you. 
As for me, I'm somewhat interested 
myself.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
What are you saying?</speak>

<speak who="ADLAI">
I've never been good with words, which 
is why I'm in such a delicate conundrum. 
Will you go out with me this Sunday?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Sure!</speak>

<info>Fry gasps.</info>

<speak who="ADLAI">
I don't know what else to say, so I'll 
just say it. Okey-dokey, see you then.</speak>

<info>He leaves.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
This is so unfair! I liked you back 
when you were a cyclops! That guy's 
only interested now that you have two 
eyes.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
You're just jealous!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
No, I'm not! Oh, wait, I am. But my 
point remains valid!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Fry, I just wanna try dating a normal 
man, who if you go somewhere with him 
no one says he's crummy. I think I deserve 
that once in life.</speak>

<info>Zoidberg holds her arm.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Be careful with Adlai, Leela, he's a 
doctor, they're very poor.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Actually, most doctors are rich.</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
What? When did this happen? You're joking, 
right?  That's not funny!</speak>

<info>O'Zorgnax's Pub. Bender takes the kids in.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
OK, they've got everything you need 
here: Booze, a couple of peanuts, they 
got a crapper in the back -- that's 
one of the things you kids do, right?</speak>

<speak who="ALBERT">
Yeah.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Then knock yourself out.  Hey! Hey! 
Only eat enough to barely keep yourselves 
alive! I'm trying to make a profit here.</speak>

<info>He sits on a stool and reads a newspaper.</info>

<speak who="NINA">
Daddy! Bethany's hitting me!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Here.</speak>

<info>He hands her a blernsball bat and she runs off with it, laughing. 
A fembot sits next to Bender.</info>

<speak who="FEMBOT">
These kids yours?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Yeah.</speak>

<speak who="FEMBOT">
Ooh. I'm attracted to a man with responsibility!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
That's me, baby! Let me just ditch the 
kids in an alley and we can go have 
some fun.</speak>

<info>A boy taps Bender.</info>

<speak who="BOY">
Daddy Bender?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Son, daddy's trying to score with a 
cheap floozy right now, so we need you 
to cram a Tinkertoy in it!</speak>

<speak who="BOY">
I love you, Daddy Bender!</speak>

<info>He hugs him. The other kids start hugging him too.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Hey, what the hell are you doing? Quit 
hugging me!</speak>

<speak who="FEMBOT">
I guess you're busy. I'll catch you 
later.</speak>

<info>She leaves.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
You morons! I don't know what you're 
trying to pull here but I got half a 
mind to hug each and every one of you 
and see how you like it!</speak>

<speak who="KIDS">
<info>(cheering)</info> Yay!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
<info>(grumbling)</info> Oh, come on!</speak>

<info>Adlai's Car. He drives Leela away from the city.</info>

<speak who="ADLAI">
I thought I'd take you someplace ordinary 
-- a place no one could object to.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
That sounds wonderful.</speak>

<info>Outside Municipal Arboretum. Adlai opens the gate and lets Leela 
through. On the fence is a sign that reads "Yes, We Have Looking 
At Trees".</info>

<info>Municipal Arboretum. A couple stop by an Altairean Bouquet Tree.</info>

<speak who="MAN">
I'd like and extra-beautiful bouquet 
for my extra-gorgeous sweetheart.</speak>

<info>The tree hands the man some flowers and he hands them to the 
woman. They walk away and Leela and Adlai arrive.</info>

<speak who="ADLAI">
Average, please.</speak>

<info>The tree hands him a bunch and he hands them to Leela. She smells 
them.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Oh, Adlai, I've had a wonderful time 
today. No one's stared at me or avoided 
staring at me or tried to burn me. You 
make me feel so not weird.</speak>

<speak who="ADLAI">
Leela, you're 999,999 in a million!</speak>

<info>She smiles and they lean in to kiss. Adlai pecks her on the 
lips and she freezes for a moment then smiles weakly.</info>

<info>Elzar's Fine Cuisine. Adlai and the Planet Express staff sit 
around a table, though Bender is not with them.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Thanks for coming out to get to know 
my boyfriend. Isn't he dreamy?</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
<info>(mesmerised)</info> Totally.</speak>

<info>He eats a cracker.</info>

<speak who="ADLAI">
Uh, listen: I just want you all to know 
your Leela's one standard lady.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Oh, Adlai, stop!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
What's so wonderful about Leela being 
normal? The rest of us aren't normal 
and that's what makes us great. Like 
Dr. Zoidberg: He's a weird monster who 
smells like he eats garbage and does.</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Damn right!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
And the professor's a senile, amoral 
crackpot.  Hermes is a Rastafarian accountant.</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
Tally me banana.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Amy's a klutz from Mars.</speak>

<info>Amy drops the glass she is drinking from and it smashes.</info>

<speak who="AMY">
Sploops!</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
And Fry, you've got that brain thing.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
I already did! So, Leela, do you wanna 
be like us? Or do you wanna be like 
Adlai with no severe mental or social 
problems whatsoever?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
That's the dumbest question I ever heard!</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
She's right!</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
No doubt about it.</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
Duh!</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
Daylight come!</speak>

<info>Bender runs through the restaurant carrying a high chair.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Coming through, watch your heads!</speak>

<info>He wangs Zoidberg on the head as he passes him.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Help! I'm under attack!</speak>

<info>He sprays the others with ink. Bender is sat with the kids at 
another table.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Remember your manners, kids. Forks go 
in the left pocket, spoons in the right.</speak>

<info>Elzar arrives with a plate of food.</info>

<speak who="ELZAR">
Which one of you cutie muffins gets 
the children's spicy squab?</speak>

<info>A little boy comes out of Bender's chest door.</info>

<speak who="LITTLE BOY">
Me!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Ah-ah-ah! What do we say when someone 
gives you something?</speak>

<info>The boy turns to Elzar.</info>

<speak who="LITTLE BOY">
'Bout time!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
That's my boy!</speak>

<info>He closes the door on him.</info>

<speak who="ELZAR">
And here's your check. Bam!</speak>

<info>Bender looks at it and gasps. Albert taps his arm.</info>

<speak who="ALBERT">
I gotta go poopy!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Well you should've gone poopy before 
it was time to run out on the check! 
C'mon! Go, go! Through the kitchen!</speak>

<info>They leg it.</info>

<speak who="ELZAR">
<info>(shouting)</info> You little crooks! If I catch 
you I'm going to make cutie-muffin gumbo!</speak>

<info>They run past the other table and Bender laughs as they run 
through the door.</info>

<speak who="ADLAI">
You know, seeing that strange robot 
force 12 children to do his bidding 
makes me think about kids of our own.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Us? Me? You? Kids?</speak>

<speak who="ADLAI">
That's correct. It's time to stop living 
this vida bachelor loca, settle down 
and have kids.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Oh, Adlai, this is the most beautiful 
moment of my life!</speak>

<info>Zoidberg woops and sprays her with ink.</info>

<info>Fry and Bender's Spare Room. The room has six bunk beds in it. 
The kids run around screaming and laughing and bouncing on the 
mattresses. Fry and Bender play poker. Albert jumps on Bender.</info>

<speak who="ALBERT">
Daddy Bender, I want a piggy back ride.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Daddy's tired. Let's just have another 
dog pile on Fry.</speak>

<info>The kids dive on Fry.</info>

<speak who="SALLY">
Tell us a story, Daddy Bender.</speak>

<speak who="KIDS">
<info>(chanting)</info> Story! Story! Story!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Alright, fine, gather round.</speak>

<info>The kids cheer.</info>

<speak who="NINA">
We wanna hear this one again!</speak>

<info>She hands him something and he opens it and clears his throat.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
<info>(reading)</info> "Bender's Arrest Record" by 
the police. On March 3rd at 2pm, Bender 
was caught shoplifting!</speak>

<speak who="ALBERT">
Yeah, show us the picture!  There he 
is!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
OK, kids. It's 9:00, you know what that 
means. Daddy's sick of looking at you 
so go to bed.  The grown-ups have to 
talk. Come on, Ma.</speak>

<info>He and Fry leave.</info>

<info>Cut to: Fry and Bender's Lounge. On the door is a newspaper 
clipping with a photo of Fry on it. The headline reads "Primitive 
Human Found In Cryo-Tube". Bender slides the door shut.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Now to figure out how much money I'm 
raking in off those twerps!  Oh, I need 
a calculator.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
You are a calculator.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
I mean a good calculator. Minus the 
food, the bunny rabbit wallpaper -- 
I'm getting 100 bucks a kid and they're

<info>Adlai's Lounge. He and Leela sit at a table doing a jigsaw.</info>

<speak who="ADLAI">
You know, doing this jigsaw puzzle of 
a pacifier factory makes me want to 
have children with you all the more.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Adlai, I was thinking. Since we're both 
orphans, maybe we should adopt a child.</speak>

<speak who="ADLAI">
Adoption? Yes, that's acceptable. Heck, 
it's more than acceptable. It's adequately 
satisfactory!</speak>

<info>Robot Arms Apartments Corridor. Adlai opens Fry and Bender's 
door and he and Leela go in. There is a sign above the door that 
says "Honest Bender's Stolen Car Parts Boutique" and scribbled 
below it "And Orphanarium".</info>

Hello? Imperial Dragon Restaurant? I've 
got a herd of you-know-whats for sale...Let 
me check.  Oh, aren't you a cutie?  
About 35lbs.  What?!</speak>

<info>Fry points and Bender panics and hangs up.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Hi, Bender. We'd like to adopt a child.</speak>

<info>Bender stands up.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Well, you've come to the right place 
because Honest Bender's Orphanarium 
means discount orphans. Now, little 
lady. What do I have to do to send you 
home with 12 orphans today?</speak>

<speak who="ADLAI">
Uh, I'm afraid we only want one.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Whatever you say, chief. I'll show you 
what I got in stock.</speak>

<info>He walks into the kids' room.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
I remember this from when we were kids: 
The warden would trot you out in front 
of prospective parents and they'd judge 
you like a piece of meat.</speak>

<info>The kids are lined up. Albert steps forward.</info>

<speak who="ALBERT">
I'm Albert.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Kind of fatty.</speak>

<info>Bender pushes Nina forward.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Then how about this little number? Pure-bred 
human. No vampire in there.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Uh, um.</speak>

<speak who="ADLAI">
Hmm.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
If you're strapped for cash, you might 
wanna consider this irregular unit. 
Cursed with a third ear but so full 
of that emotion that I understand is 
called "love".</speak>

<speak who="SALLY">
One time, I did a hundred jump ropes.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Oh, I can't decide. We're gonna have 
to think about it.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
OK, kids, grown-ups gotta talk, time 
for bed.</speak>

<speak who="ALBERT">
But it's 10 in the morning!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
I said hit the hay!</speak>

<info>The kids run.</info>

<info>Cut to: Fry and Bender's Spare Room. The kids get into bed and 
Bender flicks the light off.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Oh, they're all so adorable.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Yeah. You know, it's times like this 
I can hardly bear to let them go. Goodnight, 
you princes of Maine, you kings of New 
New England.</speak>

<info>Fry and Bender's Lounge. The police break down the door.</info>

<speak who="SMITTY">
You're under arrest for child cruelty, 
child endangerment, depriving children 
of food, selling children as food and 
misrepresenting the weight of livestock.</speak>

<info>Time Lapse. Smitty slaps the cuffs on Bender and the other police 
lead Fry and the kids out.</info>

<info>Prison Cells. Smitty locks Fry, Bender and the kids in a cell.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Officer, would it be alright if we adopted 
one of the kids?</speak>

<speak who="SMITTY">
Might as well. They're just gonna rot 
in the evidence locker.</speak>

<info>He and URL leave. The kids laugh and point at Sally.</info>

<speak who="KID #1">
Nice ear!</speak>

<speak who="KID #2">
Hey, freaky ears!</speak>

<speak who="KID #3">
How's you ear?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
I've made up my mind. Let's adopt her.</speak>

<info>She points at Sally.</info>

<speak who="ADLAI">
Her? But there's plenty of normal ones.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Come on, Adlai. She could really use 
a mom and dad.</speak>

<speak who="KIDS">
<info>(chanting)</info> Ear-face! Ear-face! Sally 
won the ugly race!</speak>

<speak who="ADLAI">
On the other hand, the children bring 
up a good point. She does have an ear 
on her face.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Well? So what? She may be different 
but she still deserves a good home.</speak>

<speak who="ADLAI">
Oh, alright. If you really want that 
one, I can give her an operation to 
make her acceptable.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
She doesn't need an operation! She's 
fine the way she is!</speak>

<speak who="ADLAI">
Oh, and I suppose you were fine the 
way you were?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Damn right I was!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Yay!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Shut up, Fry. Now look, Adlai. I'm proud 
to be different. And I just wished I'd 
realised that when I was her age.</speak>

<speak who="SALLY">
I also have a tail!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Now take me to the hospital and put 
my eye back the way it was. Right now!</speak>

<speak who="ADLAI">
Why should I do that?</speak>

<info>Leela slams him against the bars.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Listen, buddy. By the end of the day, 
one of us is going to have one eye.</speak>

<info>Outside Cookieville Minimum-Security Orphanarium. People are 
crowded around the front door as Vogel makes a speech.</info>

<speak who="VOGEL">
In recognition of Bender's generous 
gift of 12 orphans and a government 
cheque for 1200 wing-wangs, I hereby 
rename this building the Bender B. Rodriguez 
Orphanarium!</speak>

<info>The crowd cheers and Vogel shakes Bender's hand. Leela's eye 
is back to how it was before.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
It's good to have the old weird-looking 
Leela back.</speak>

<info>They hug.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Aww! You're a true friend, Fry. I guess 
there's nothing wrong with being a little 
weird.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Leela, there's nothing wrong with anything.</speak>

<info>The kids say goodbye to Bender.</info>

<speak who="ALBERT">
We'll miss you, Daddy Bender.</speak>

<speak who="NINA">
We know robots don't have emotions but 
we drawed you this picture!</speak>

<info>She shows him a crude picture of him and the kids.</info>

<speak who="SALLY">
So if you ever miss us, even just a 
teeny bit, you can look at it.</speak>

<info>Bender takes the picture.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Hey, I smoke a cigar, not a candy cane. 
Sheesh!  Hey, what the? Get away! Come 
on! I just got all the gum off of there! 
Hey! Hey! <info>(shouting)</info> I hate you! I hate 
you all!</speak>
