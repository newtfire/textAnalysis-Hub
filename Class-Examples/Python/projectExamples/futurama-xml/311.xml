                         Listen, buddy. By the end of the day, 
                         one of us is going to have one eye.

                         In recognition of Bender's generous 
                         gift of 12 orphans and a government 
                         cheque for 1200 wing-wangs, I hereby 
                         rename this building the Bender B. Rodriguez 
                         Orphanarium!

                         It's good to have the old weird-looking 
                         Leela back.

                         Aww! You're a true friend, Fry. I guess 
                         there's nothing wrong with being a little 
                         weird.

                         So if you ever miss us, even just a 
                         teeny bit, you can look at it.

                         Hey, I smoke a cigar, not a candy cane. 
                         Sheesh!  Hey, what the? Get away! Come 
                         on! I just got all the gum off of there! 
                         Hey! Hey! (shouting) I hate you! I hate 
                         you all!
