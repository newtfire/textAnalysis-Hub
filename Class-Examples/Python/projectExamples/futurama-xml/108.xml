<info>Planet Express: Meeting Room. The crew are sat around the table.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Good news, everyone. Tomorrow you'll 
be making a delivery to Ebola 9, the 
virus planet.</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
Why can't they go today?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Because tonight's a special night and 
I want all of you to be alive. It's 
the Academy of Inventors annual symposium.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Wow! I love symposia.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
It's the event of the scientific season. 
Every member presents an invention and 
the best one wins the Academy prize.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Sounds boring.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Oh, my, yes. But not this year, because 
my latest invention is unbeatable. Behold! 
The death clock.  Simply jam your finger 
in the hole and this readout tells you 
exactly how long you have left to live.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Does it really work?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Well it's occasionally off by a few 
seconds. What with free will and all.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Sounds like fun. How long do I have 
left to live?</speak>

<info>He puts his finger in the hole and the clock dings.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Ooh! Dibs on his CD player!</speak>

<info>Opening Credits. Caption: Mr. Bender's Wardrobe By Robotany 
500.</info>

<info>Academy of Inventors. The room is filled with doctors and professors 
all wearing white lab coats. Bender is wearing a top hat and 
is talking to Farnsworth.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Oh, my, yes.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Who's the gross nerd?</speak>

<info>He points to a picture of a geek on the wall.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
That's me at the very first symposium. 
I'm the Academy's oldest living member, 
you know. These youngsters all look 
up to me.</speak>

<info>Enter an old man.</info>

<speak who="WERNSTROM">
Well, well, well. Look who decided to 
show his wrinkled face.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Why don't you just leave me alone, Wernstrom?!</speak>

<speak who="WERNSTROM">
Face it, Farnsworth, you're over the 
hill. It's time to leave science to 
the 120-year-olds.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
You young turks think you know everything. 
I was inventing things when you were 
barely turning senile.</speak>

<info>Wernstrom laughs.</info>

<speak who="WERNSTROM">
Go home before you embarrass yourself, 
old man. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm 
going to take a nap before the ceremonies.</speak>

<info>He leaves.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Who's that jerk?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
A hundred years ago he was my most promising 
student at Mars University. But then 
after one fateful pop-quiz...</speak>

<info>Flashback: Mars University. A younger Farnsworth hands a younger 
Wernstrom a piece of paper.</info>

<speak who="WERNSTROM">
A-minus? No one gives Ogden Wernstrom 
an A-minus!</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
I'm sorry but penmanship counts.</speak>

<speak who="WERNSTROM">
I swear I'll have my revenge even if 
it takes me a hundred years.</speak>

<info>Flashback ends.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
And here it is: Slightly over 99 years 
later and still no revenge. I'm essentially 
in the clear.</speak>

<info>Academy of Inventors Auditorium. Bender, Fry and Leela are sat 
at a table. Bender is wearing a top hat and is reading the wine 
list. A waiter takes his order.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
I've been perusing your fortified wine 
list and I've selected the '71 Hobo's 
Delight, the '57 Chateau Par-tay and 
the '66 Thunder Chevitz.</speak>

<speak who="WAITER">
Exquisite choices, sir.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
And mix them all together in a big jug.</speak>

<info>Time Lapse. The lights in the auditorium are now dimmed and 
Ron Popeil's head in a jar is on the stage.</info>

<speak who="POPEIL">
Welcome to this year�s Academy of Inventors 
Annual Symposium, I'm your host, Ron 
Popeil, inventor of Mr. Microphone, 
the spray-on toupee and - of course 
- the technology to keep human heads 
alive in jars.  But wait, there's more. 
We've got a whole line-up of inventors 
tonight, starting with that up and coming 
young star, Ogden Wernstrom.</speak>

<info>The audience applauds and Wernstrom stands up and walks onto 
the stage. Fry boos him.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
<info>(shouting)</info> More wine!</speak>

<speak who="WERNSTROM">
Distinguished members of the Academy, 
I present to you, the Reverse SCUBA 
Suit. Observe!  Fetch!  Now, sit!  I 
said sit!  Bad fish!</speak>

<info>He hits the fish with a newspaper and it sits. The audience 
applauds. Farnsworth groans.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Don't worry, Professor, it's no competition 
for your death clock.</speak>

<speak who="WERNSTROM">
And what will you be presenting this 
evening, grandpa?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Let's just say it'll put you young whippersnappers 
in your place!</speak>

<speak who="WERNSTROM">
I just hope it's not as lame as that 
death clock you presented last year.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Uh, last year, you say?</speak>

<speak who="WERNSTROM">
That's right.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Oh, my! Did it put you young whippersnappers 
in your place?</speak>

<speak who="WERNSTROM">
Hardly! We laughed until our teeth fell 
out. Come along, Cinnamon.</speak>

<info>His fish follows him.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Oh, dear, I'll have to invent something 
new in the next ten minutes. Perhaps 
some sort of death clock.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Uh, Professor...?</speak>

<info>Time Lapse. A man on the stage demonstrates a helicopter hat. 
He turns a handle and flies away. The audience applauds.</info>

<speak who="POPEIL">
Our last presentation comes from our 
oldest member, Professor Hubert Farnsworth. 
Professor?</speak>

<info>A spotlight falls on Farnsworth. He is scribbling something 
on a piece of paper.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Just a second, just a second.</speak>

<speak who="WERNSTROM">
Pencils down, prune-face.</speak>

<info>Farnsworth snarls and runs onto the stage.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Uh, yes, here I am, OK, now, hello there. 
Now, we all know telescopes allow us 
to see distant objects. But what if 
we want to smell distant objects? Well 
now we can! Thanks to my new invention...the 
Smellescope.</speak>

<info>He puts a piece of paper on a projector. The audience starts 
talking.</info>

<speak who="MAN">
Oh, I say!</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
The odour travels past this coffee stain 
here, around the olive pit and into 
this cigar burn. And this appears to 
be a, doodle of myself as a cowboy. 
But the Smellescope is brilliant, I 
tell you! Think of the astronomical 
odours you'll smell thanks to me.  Oh, 
my!</speak>

<info>He puts it back on the projector. It is smudged. The audience 
laughs again.</info>

<speak who="WERNSTROM">
I've waited a hundred years for this, 
Farnsworth. I give your invention the 
worst grade imaginable: An A-minus-minus.</speak>

<info>The audience laughs. Farnsworth walks off the stage.</info>

<info>Time Lapse. Ron Popeil is back on the stage. A trophy is beside 
him.</info>

<speak who="POPEIL">
And now for the presentation of the 
award. Listen, folks, I'm practically 
giving this prize away to Dr. Wernstrom, 
for his fish thingy.</speak>

<info>Wernstrom picks up the trophy and shakes his fish's leg. Farnsworth, 
outside, sighs and walks away.</info>

<info>Planet Express: Meeting Room. Fry, Bender, Leela and Farnsworth 
are sat around the table.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Perhaps 149 is just too old to be a 
scientist.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Yep!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
No, Professor, don't give up. There 
were plenty of times in my century when 
I was gonna give up but I never did. 
Never! Hey, are you even listening to 
me? Oh, I give up!</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
By God, you're right! I'm going to build 
that Smellescope!</speak>

<info>Planet Express: Attic.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Eureka!</speak>

<info>Fry, Leela and Bender run in.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Did you build the Smellescope?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
No, I remembered that I'd built one 
last year. Go ahead. Try it. You'll 
find that every heavenly body has its 
own particular scent. Here, I'll point 
it at Jupiter.</speak>

<info>Fry sniffs.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Smells like strawberries.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Exactly! And now Saturn.</speak>

<info>Fry sniffs.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Pine needles. Oh, man, this is great! 
Hey, as long as you don't make me smell 
Uranus.</speak>

<info>He laughs.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
I don't get it.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
I'm sorry, Fry, but astronomers renamed 
Uranus in 2620 to end that stupid joke 
once and for all.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Oh. What's it called now?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Urectum. Here, let me locate it for 
you.</speak>

<info>Fry chuckles.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
No, no, I think I'll just smell around 
a bit over here!  Hmm.  Hmm.</speak>

<info>He sniffs again and starts gagging.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
What is it?  Oh, jeez! Oh, man! Remarkable! 
A stench so foul is right off the funk-o-meter. 
I dare say Fry may have discovered the 
smelliest object in the known universe.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Ooh, ooh, name it after me!</speak>

<info>Leela sniffs.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
I think it's moving.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Hmm, perhaps the computer can calculate 
its trajectory.  My God! Whatever it 
is it's headed straight for us. With 
enough force to reduce this entire city 
to a stinky crater. We have less than 
72 hours.</speak>

<info>Fry, Leela and Bender gasp.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Well, lets get looting!</speak>

<info>He picks up a TV and runs out.</info>

<info>Planet Express: Meeting Room. The crew are sat around the table 
looking at a hologram of the Earth.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
So this thing's gonna destroy the whole 
city?  What the heck is it?</speak>

<info>Farnsworth taps a keyboard.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Ah! Just as I thought. The answer lies 
in this movie I found on the Internet.</speak>

<info>He plays the movie. The New York skyline of 2000 is displayed 
on the screen, along with the title The Great Garbage Crisis 
Of 2000.</info>

<speak who="NARRATOR">
New York City: the year 2000. The most 
wasteful society in the history of the 
galaxy and it was running out of places 
to empty its never-ending output of 
garbage.  The landfills were full. New 
Jersey was full. And so, under cover 
of darkness, the city put its garbage 
out to sea on the world's largest barge. 
The repulsive barge circled the oceans 
for 50 years but no country would accept 
it. Not even that really filthy one. 
You know the one I mean. Finally, in 
2052, the city used its mob connections 
to obtain a rocket and launch the garbage 
into outer space. Some experts claim 
the ball might return to Earth someday, 
but their concerns were dismissed as 
"depressing".</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Wow! You got that off the Internet? 
In my day the Internet was only used 
to download pornography.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Actually that's still true.</speak>

<info>He resumes the movie.</info>

<speak who="FEMALE SCIENTIST">
Now that the garbage is in space, doctor, 
perhaps you can help me with my sexual 
inhibitions.</speak>

<speak who="MALE SCIENTIST">
With gusto!</speak>

<info>They both strip down to their underwear. Leela turns the lights 
back on. Fry groans.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
So that's the situation. Due to the 
short-sightedness of Old New York, New 
New York is going to be destroyed by 
a giant ball of garbage.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Fry, what the hell were you people thinking 
back then? How could you just throw 
your garbage away?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Hey, hey, gimmie a break! What do you 
do with it?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
We recycle everything. Robots are made 
from old beer cans.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Yeah! And this beer can is made outta 
old robots.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
And that sandwich you're eating is made 
of old discarded sandwiches.  Nothing 
just gets thrown away.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
The future is disgusting.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Typical 20th century attitude.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Hey! You have no right to criticise 
the 20th century. We gave the world 
the lightbulb, the steamboat and the 
cotton gin.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Those things are all from the 19th century.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Yeah, well, they probably just copied 
us.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Please! There's no time for this now. 
This is an emergency. We must warn the 
mayor.</speak>

<info>Citihall: Mayor's Office. The Mayor, a short balding man in 
a green suit, sits behind his desk.</info>

<speak who="POOPENMEYER">
Garbage ball, huh? That sounds serious.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Very serious, Mayor Poopenmeyer.</speak>

<speak who="POOPENMEYER">
I gotta be sure this isn't another scientific 
fraud like global warming or second-hand 
smoke.  Send in my science advisor.</speak>

<info>Enter Wernstrom.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Wernstrom!</speak>

<speak who="WERNSTROM">
Well, well, well! Come to present your 
latest napkin, Professor?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
No, I'm here because a giant trash ball 
is heading straight for us. Smell for 
yourself.</speak>

<info>Farnsworth wipes the Smellescope. Poopenmeyer sniffs and leaps 
back.</info>

<speak who="POOPENMEYER">
Hey! Holy jeez!</speak>

<speak who="WERNSTROM">
That smell could be anything; A faulty 
stench coil, some cheese on the lens, 
who knows?</speak>

<info>A woman walks in with a cassette player.</info>

<speak who="WOMAN">
Mr. Mayor, we just got this transmission 
from Neptune.</speak>

<speak who="MAN">
Giant...garbage ball.....passed close 
by...horrible stench......</speak>

<speak who="WOMAN">
The transmission cuts out there, sir. 
No, I, guess it keeps going.</speak>

<info>The voice chokes again. The message cuts out.</info>

<speak who="WOMAN">
There we go.</speak>

<speak who="POOPENMEYER">
My God! The senile old man is right.</speak>

<speak who="WERNSTROM">
Do you mean him or me?</speak>

<speak who="POOPENMEYER">
Him!</speak>

<info>He points at Farnsworth. Wernstrom grumbles.</info>

<info>New New York Street. People are crowded around a shop watching 
TV's through the window. On the TV, two newscasters present a 
report. One is a blonde human woman wearing a pink suit and the 
other is an alien that looks like one from This Island Earth. 
He has a huge green head with veins poking out of it and big 
eyes.</info>

<speak who="LINDA">
Next, New New York in crisis. Morbo?</speak>

<speak who="MORBO">
Thanks, human female. Puny Earthlings 
were shocked today to learn that a ball 
of garbage will destroy their pathetic 
city of New New York.</speak>

<speak who="LINDA">
Makes me glad we live here in Los Angeles.</speak>

<speak who="MORBO">
Morbo agrees!</speak>

<info>They both laugh.</info>

<info>Citihall: Mayor's Office. A large hologram of the garbage ball 
is projected in the middle of the room. A military man is there 
with the others.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Can't we just shoot a missile at it?</speak>

<speak who="MILITARY MAN">
We've simulated that on a supercomputer 
but the ball is just too damn gooey. 
A missile would go right through it.</speak>

<info>The hologram shows a missile squelching through the garbage 
ball.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
But suppose we send a crew to plant 
an explosive precisely on the fault 
line betwen this mass of coffee grounds 
and this deposit of America Online floppy 
disks.</speak>

<info>The simulation explodes.</info>

<speak who="MILITARY MAN">
In theory, it could work.</speak>

<speak who="WERNSTROM">
Uh, in theory, perhaps. But you'll never 
find a crew willing to take on a mission 
so suicidal-y dangerous.</speak>

<info>Farnsworth smiles and looks at his crew.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Oh, crap!</speak>

<info>Planet Express: Hangar. The crew are assembled in front of the 
ship.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Now, you'll only have one chance to 
destroy the ball. After that, it will 
be so close to Earth that blowing it 
up would cause garbage to rain over 
the entire planet, killing billions.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
<info>(ironic)</info> Oh, boo-hoo!</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Now here's the bomb I've prepared. Once 
you activate it, you'll have 25 minutes 
to get away.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
That's all? But --</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Now, now, there'll be plenty of time 
to discuss your objections when and 
if you return.</speak>

<info>The crew suit up in orange spacesuits and walk towards the ship. 
Fry and Leela carry their helmets under their arms and Bender 
carries his head under his.</info>

<info>The ship clears the atmosphere and flies towards the garbage 
ball. It looks like the asteroid from Armageddon.</info>

<info>Ships Cockpit.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Odour at magnitude 8.  Magnitude 12. 
Magnitude 31.  We're breaking up. Turn 
on the anti-smell device.</speak>

<info>The sound of an air freshener goes off and the ship stops shaking.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Hmm, sporty!</speak>

<info>Garbage Ball Surface. The ship cruises in and lands. The steps 
go down, the door opens and the crew look around.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Wow!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Look at all this filth.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
It's not filth. It's a glorious monument 
to the achievements of the 20th century. 
Look! A real Beanie Baby.  Oh! A Mr. 
Spock collector's plate!  Some Bart 
Simpson dolls!</speak>

<info>He runs over to a pile of them. Bender picks one up and pulls 
the string.</info>

<speak who="DOLL">
Eat my shorts!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
OK  <info>(� la Homer Simpson)</info> Mmm! Shorts!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Fry, this stuff was garbage when it 
was new. Let's blow it up already!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
This junk isn't garbage! I can dig in 
any random pile and find something great.</speak>

<info>He digs in a pile and comes out with a six pack holder around 
his neck, like a seagull. Leela cuts him free.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
<info>(gasping)</info> Alright, let's get to work.</speak>

<info>Time Lapse. The crew walk across the surface, reading a map.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Let's see. If that's Hypodermic Ridge 
then the bomb must go right here.  Get 
ready to run. We've got 25 minutes. 
Uh, 15 minutes.  5 minutes.  6h minutes?</speak>

<info>Bender pulls the bomb out of the ground. He turns it upside 
down.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
There's your problem. The Professor 
put the counter on upside-down.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
That idiot! It wasn't set for 25 minutes, 
it was set for 52 seconds.</speak>

<info>Fry screams.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
We're gonna die! <info>(calmly)</info> Right?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Right!</speak>

<info>Fry screams again.</info>

<info>Time Lapse. The timer is at 19 seconds. Bender screams.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
It's gonna blow!</speak>

<info>He throws it to Fry. Fry throws it back. Bender throws it at 
Leela and it hits her helmet.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Hey, watch it! You'll put somebody's 
eye out!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
OK, OK, keep your space pants on. I'll 
take care of this.</speak>

<info>Bender throws the bomb into space but it hits a passing comet 
and bounces back into his hands. He throws it up again and it 
explodes. The crew sigh with relief.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
We're saved!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Yeah, but this garbage ball's unstoppable 
now. New New York is done for.</speak>

<info>They watch as the garbage ball moves closer to Earth. Bender 
scratches his butt.</info>

<info>Outside Planet Express. A crowd of people stand on the street 
with a banner saying "Welcome Home Heroes" with "Heroes" crossed 
out and replaced with "Losers".</info>

<info>Citihall: Mayor's Office.</info>

<speak who="LINDA">
All in all, this is one day Mittens 
the kitten won't soon forget!</speak>

<info>Morbo and Linda chuckle.</info>

<speak who="MORBO">
Kittens give Morbo gas. In lighter 
news, the city of New New York is doomed. 
Blame rests with known human Professor 
Hubert Farnsworth and his tiny, inferior 
brain.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Oh, how could I have put that bomb timer 
on upside-down? I could swear I followed 
the manual precisely.  I'm a dried up 
husk of a scientist. This is all my 
fault.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
No, it's my fault too. I'm sure I threw 
out more than my share of that trash 
up there. Also, one month my toilet 
broke and it just went straight in the 
garbage can.  Leela was right. The people 
of the 20th century were idiotic slobs. 
Especially me.</speak>

<speak who="POOPENMEYER">
Enough! You all failed miserably. It's 
time to put a real scientist in charge.</speak>

<info>Enter Wernstrom.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Wernstrom!</speak>

<speak who="WERNSTROM">
The very same.</speak>

<speak who="POOPENMEYER">
Dr. Wernstrom, can you save my city?</speak>

<speak who="WERNSTROM">
Of course. But it'll cost you. First 
I'll need tenure.</speak>

<speak who="POOPENMEYER">
Done.</speak>

<speak who="WERNSTROM">
And a big research grant.</speak>

<speak who="POOPENMEYER">
You got it.</speak>

<speak who="WERNSTROM">
Also, access to a lab and five graduate 
students, at least three of them Chinese.</speak>

<speak who="POOPENMEYER">
Um, alright done. What's your plan?</speak>

<speak who="WERNSTROM">
What plan? I'm set for life! Au revoir, 
suckers!</speak>

<info>He walks out.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
That rat! Do something!</speak>

<speak who="POOPENMEYER">
I wish I could but, he's got tenure!</speak>

<info>New New York Street. People stop and stare into the sky as a 
hamburger and other pieces of garbage plow through buildings. 
A fish skeleton falls in front of Zoidberg. He checks to see 
no one is looking and eats it.</info>

<info>Cut to: Citihall: Mayor's Office. A pizza slice splats against 
the window.</info>

<speak who="POOPENMEYER">
It's time to take action.  Stephanie, 
cancel the maid for today. Have her 
come tomorrow.  Well, I'm out of ideas. 
Anyone?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Wait! If we could build an object the 
exact size, density and consistency 
of the garbage ball, it might just knock 
the ball away without smashing it to 
bits.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
But where can we find a substance the 
exact density and consistency as garbage?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Alas, I don't know.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Uh, what about garbage?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Good Lord! A second ball of garbage! 
That just might work!</speak>

<speak who="POOPENMEYER">
But garbage isn't something you just 
find lying in the streets of Manhattan. 
This city's been garbage-free for 500 
years!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Then it's time to make some more.</speak>

<speak who="POOPENMEYER">
Make garbage? But how?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Stand back and watch the master! This 
Slurm can.  Now it's garbage. These 
papers.  Garbage. This picture of your 
wife.  Pure garbage. Now you try it.</speak>

<info>Poopenmeyer picks up a pencil and drops it on the floor.</info>

<speak who="POOPENMEYER">
By God, I think the boy's got something. 
Come on, everyone! The fate of the city 
is at stake!</speak>

<info>He turns a chair on it's side.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Good!  Don't finish that cruller, throw 
it away  Bender. Drink that beer and 
drop the bottle on the ground.  Very 
nice.</speak>

<speak who="POOPENMEYER">
Get that robot some more beer!  We've 
trashed this room but that's just the 
start. We've got to get Fry's message 
to the people.</speak>

<info>Woman's Kitchen. Fry is on TV.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
People of New New York. Take a lesson 
from the 20th century. Stop all this 
pain-in-the-ass recycling and throw 
your garbage on the floor.</speak>

<info>The woman scrapes her food onto the floor.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Go ahead. Just chuck it any old place 
like I used to. Your city is counting 
on you.</speak>

<info>The man empties his cats litter tray out of the window.</info>

<info>Printing Press. The newspapers are printed with the headline 
"City Urged To Litter!" and the conveyor belt dumps them outside 
the building.</info>

<info>Cut to: Outside Printing Press. They land in a heap and are 
bulldozed away.</info>

<info>Launch Pad. The new garbage ball has been stuck on top of a 
rocket. </info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
If my calculations are correct, this 
garbage ball will knock the other garbage 
ball directly into the sun.</speak>

<speak who="WERNSTROM">
And if my calculations are correct, 
we're all going to die horribly.</speak>

<info>He laughs then realises what he's said.</info>

<speak who="POOPENMEYER">
Alright, places everyone. Prepare for 
launch.</speak>

<info>Farnsworth counts down.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Five, four, three, two, three, four, 
five, six...</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Just fire the damn thing.</speak>

<info>Fry tries to push the button but misses it.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Oops!</speak>

<info>He pushes it again. The rocket takes off and heads towards the 
other garbage ball. Fry's heart beats. Farnsworth's heart beats, 
but a lot slower than Fry's. Bender's "heart" beats like a drum.</info>

<info>In space, the new garbage ball hits the old one and knocks it 
away from the Earth. It slingshots around several planets and 
flies into the sun.

[Launch Pad. Farnsworth sniffs through the Smellescope.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Burning garbage!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
It worked!</speak>

<info>Everyone except Wernstrom cheers.</info>

<info>Outside Citihall. The Mayor and the Planet Express crew are 
standing on the steps. Poopenmeyer is finishing a speech.</info>

<speak who="POOPENMEYER">
And so, on behalf of the entire city, 
I thank you, Professor Farnsworth. I 
now present you with the Academy prize, 
which we confiscated from Dr. Wernstrom 
after it became apparent that he was 
a jackass.</speak>

<info>He hands Farnsworth the trophy.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Yes! In your face, Wernstrom!</speak>

<speak who="WERNSTROM">
I'll get you, Farnsworth. Even if it 
takes me another hundred years.</speak>

<info>He and his five graduate students - three of them Chinese - 
shake their fists.</info>

<speak who="POOPENMEYER">
And, Fry, we owe you a tremendous debt 
as well. If not for your 20th century 
garbage-making skills, we'd all be buried 
under 20th century garbage.</speak>

<info>The crowd cheers.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Should we really be celebrating? I mean, 
what if the second garbage ball returns 
to Earth like the first one did?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Who cares? That won't be for hundreds 
of years.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Exactly! It's none of our concern.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
That's the 20th century spirit!</speak>

<info>He and Farnsworth hold the award up and the crowd cheers and 
applauds.</info>

<info>Closing Credits. We'll Meet Again from the film Dr Strangelove 
Or: How I Learned To Stop Worrying And Love The Bomb plays over 
them.</info></xml>
