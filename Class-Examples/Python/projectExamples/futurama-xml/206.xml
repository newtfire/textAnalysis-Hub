<info>Ships Rec Room. Fry and Bender play a futuristic version of 
chess. The pieces are holograms and include an Omicronian, a 
Trisolian, a Horrible Gelatinous Blob, one of Kif's people and 
one of Zoidberg's people.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Hmm. Horsey to pointy guy six.  Check.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Hmm. Get him, boys!</speak>

<info>Fry screams as Bender's pieces leap off the board and knock 
him to the floor and beat him up.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
<info>(hoarse)</info> Good move.</speak>

<info>Planet Express: Lounge. Fry lies on the couch next to Bender 
and Leela leans against the wall reading Cosmopolitan. The door 
opens.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Good news, everyone.  We have a mission 
to further the noble cause of intergalactic 
peace.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Nope. Watching cartoons.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Sorry.</speak>

<info>Leela tips them off the couch.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
What's the mission?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
It's a delivery for the Democratic Order 
Of Planets.</speak>

<info>He points at the label on the package that says "DOOP." Fry 
looks at it.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
DOOP? What's that?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
It's similar to the United Nations from 
your time, Fry.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Uh...</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
Or like the Federation from your Star 
Trek programme.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
<info>(getting it)</info> Oh!</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Tonight is the ribbon-cutting for the 
DOOP's new headquarters.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
What are we delivering?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Something without which no ribbon-cutting 
ceremony could proceed. The ceremonial 
oversized scissors.</speak>

<info>He takes them out of the box and Leela takes them from him.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
We'll get them there as quickly as we 
can.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Alright, but don't run with them.</speak>

<info>The Planet Express ship flies towards the ultra-modern new DOOP
space station located in the Neutral Zone and docks.</info>

<info>New DOOP Headquarters. The crew walk into the huge reception 
area.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Wow! There's a million aliens. I've 
never seen anything so mind blowing. 
Ooh, a reception table with muffins!</speak>

<info>He runs across the room. Glab, one of Kif's people, stands at 
a podium. A grey man dressed in grey and an orange DOOP sash 
stands behind her.</info>

<speak who="GLAB">
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the 
ribbon-cutting ceremony of the DOOP's 
magnificent new headquarters. A fitting 
home for an organisation that has fostered 
peace throughout the universe. Even 
between the Insectoids and the Space 
Lizards.</speak>

<info>A spotlight falls on a Space Lizard who is eating an Insectoid. 
He spits out the Insectoid and shakes it's hand. Everyone applauds. 
At the bar Fry picks at a muffin and chats up someone.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
So, what's it like on planet Amazonia?</speak>

<info>The woman is a huge ten-foot tall Neanderthal wearing leopard-skin 
and carrying a club.</info>

<speak who="AMAZONIAN">
Big rats there. Me crush with club.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
That's so interesting. Maybe we could 
get to know each other over a coffee.</speak>

<speak who="GLAB">
I can think of no better place for this 
centre of diplomacy than here in orbit 
around the Neutral Planet.  What are 
your thoughts on this momentous occasion, 
Your Neutralness?</speak>

<speak who="NEUTRAL PRESIDENT">
I have no strong feelings one way or 
the other.</speak>

<info>Everyone cheers, except one man.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
I hate these filthy Neutrals, Kif. With 
enemies you know where they stand but 
with Neutrals, who knows? It sickens 
me.  Halt.  Why, Leela. I do believe 
we've met.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
<info>(whispering)</info> He means you guys did it.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
If you don't mind, we're here to deliver 
the scissors for the ribbon-cutting.</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Then you're under arrest.</speak>

<info>He snatches the scissors away.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
What for?</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
How do I know these scissors aren't 
part of some Neutral plot?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
But they're not even sharp. Who could 
I possibly hurt with them?</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
The Yarn People of Nylar 4?  So, a plan 
to assassinate a weird-looking alien 
with scissors. How very Neutral of you.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
What?</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
It was almost the perfect crime, but 
you forgot one thing: Rock crushes scissors 
... but paper covers rock ... and scissors 
cut paper. Kif, we have a conundrum. 
Search them for paper, and bring me 
a rock.</speak>

<speak who="KIF">
Why?</speak>

<info>Zapp stares at Leela.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
So beautiful, yet so neutral.  Drag 
them to the ship.</speak>

<speak who="GLAB">
And now, to cut the ribbon, the legendary 
DOOP captain who just returned from 
a triumphant carpet-bombing of Eden 
7, Zapp Brannigan.</speak>

<info>Everyone applauds and looks around in confusion. Zapp has gone.</info>

<info>Nimbus Bridge. The Nimbus has moved away from the headquarters. 
Leela, Fry and Bender are handcuffed on the deserted bridge. 
Zapp paces around.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
What makes a man turn neutral? Lust 
for gold? Power? Or were you just born 
with a heart full of neutrality?</speak>

<info>Kif points at the reception area on the viewscreen.</info>

<speak who="KIF">
Um, sir, you're supposed to be cutting 
the ribbon right now.</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
No matter. I'll simply cut it from here 
with the ships laser.</speak>

<info>He presses a button and a console comes out of the floor. Outside 
the ship a huge laser appears from a hatch.</info>

<speak who="KIF">
Sir, I don't think that's wise.</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Kif, if there's one thing I don't need 
it's your I-don't-think-that's-wise 
attitude.</speak>

<info>He grabs a handle on the console and moves it through Stun, 
Kill and Hyperdeath ï¿½. He presses the "Fire" button and shoots 
a laser beam towards the space station.</info>

<info>Cut to: New DOOP Headquarters. The laser cuts the ribbon and 
everyone applauds. The laser carries on cutting and cuts a huge 
stone statue of Glab in half. Everyone gasps. The laser carries 
on cutting and everyone stands gobsmacked. The station starts 
rumbling and explodes. The reception area breaks off and hurtles 
off into space with everyone still screaming.</info>

<info>Cut to: Nimbus Bridge.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Whoopsie-daisy.</speak>

<info>Former DOOP Headquarters. The building in Weehauken, New Jersey, 
is a ruin with boarded up windows and cracks in the walls. The 
DOOP representitives are gathered for Zapp's trial, which Glab 
precides. She bangs her gavel.</info>

<speak who="GLAB">
Zapp Brannigan, you stand accused of 
blowing up DOOP headquarters. How do 
you plead?</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Absolutely 99% not guilty.</speak>

<speak who="GLAB">
Then the prosecutor will call his first 
witness.</speak>

<info>The prosecutor is a giant, green, chicken with tiny glasses 
perched on his beak. He stands up and speaks with a strong Southern 
American accent.</info>

<speak who="HYPERCHICKEN">
Your Honour, I'm just a simple Hyper-Chicken 
from a backwoods asteroid but if it 
please the court I reckon I'll call 
the entire jury.</speak>

<info>Everyone gasps and murmurs.</info>

<speak who="GLAB">
I'm going to allow this.</speak>

<speak who="HYPERCHICKEN">
Members of the jury ...  ... did y'all 
happen to catch a gander at who blew 
up that there DOOP headquarters?</speak>

<info>They point at Zapp.</info>

<speak who="JUROR #1">
<info>(simultaneously)</info> That's the guy, right 
there.</speak>

<speak who="JUROR #2">
<info>(simultaneously)</info> Oh, yeah, right there.</speak>

<speak who="SMALL GLURMO #1">
<info>(simultaneously)</info> That one.</speak>

<speak who="HYPERCHICKEN">
And are y'all gonna vote to convict 
him?</speak>

<speak who="NEPTUNIAN">
<info>(simultaneously)</info> You'd better believe 
it.</speak>

<speak who="JUROR #1">
<info>(simultaneously)</info> You bet.</speak>

<info>Glab bangs her gavel.</info>

<speak who="GLAB">
The jury is instructed to disregard 
its own testimony.</speak>

<speak who="HYPERCHICKEN">
Your Honour, the prosecution rests.</speak>

<info>He clucks and covers his face with his wing.</info>

<speak who="GLAB">
The evidence against Zapp Brannigan 
is strong. However, in light of his 
years of service, and the incompetence 
of this hillbilly prosecutor, I'm afraid 
I must dismiss all charges.</speak>

<info>The crowd murmurs.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Dismiss all charges? Your Honour, I 
know the case is closed and you've rendered 
your verdict, but I wanna testify.</speak>

<speak who="GLAB">
I'm going to allow this.</speak>

<info>Time Lapse. Leela is sat in the witness box.</info>

<speak who="HYPERCHICKEN">
Now, Miss Leela, on the date in question, 
were you or were you not wearing a hoop 
skirt?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
That's a stupid question. What matters 
is Zapp Brannigan is the sorriest captain 
I've ever seen, and I saw the idiot 
blow up DOOP headquarters with my own 
eye.</speak>

<info>The crowd gasps. Zapp stands up.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
I'd like to cross-examine the witness.</speak>

<speak who="GLAB">
I'm going to allow this.</speak>

<info>Zapp paces past Leela.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
We've met before have we not?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
<info>(reluctantly)</info> Yes.</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
And on that occasion, did you have sex 
with someone? May I remind you you are 
still under oath.</speak>

<info>Leela sighs.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
<info>(reluctantly)</info> Yes.</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Please point out the person in this 
courtroom you had sex with.  And his 
name is?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Zapp Brannigan.</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
The very same Zapp Brannigan who did 
not blow up DOOP headquarters. I rest 
my case.</speak>

<speak who="GLAB">
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you 
may begin your deliberations.</speak>

<info>The jury files out through one door and returns immediately 
through another. Small Glurmo #1 is the foreman.</info>

<speak who="SMALL GLURMO #1">
Your Honour, we have reached a verdict. 
We find the defendant ... guilty.</speak>

<info>Leela hoots.</info>

<speak who="GLAB">
Zapp Brannigan, you are hereby stripped 
of your rank as captain and dismissed 
from the DOOP.</speak>

<info>Zapp cries as he turns and walks towards the door. He stops 
before he reaches it and turns to the court.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
I'd like to make one final statement. 
Kif c'mere and hold up the flag.  And 
wave it a little for God's sakes. My 
friends, you can take away a man's title 
and his uniform but you can never take 
away his integrity or his honour. Plus 
it was mostly Kif's fault.</speak>

<info>Kif drops the flag.</info>

<speak who="KIF">
What?</speak>

<speak who="GLAB">
Kif Kroker, you are also stripped of 
your rank and dishonourably discharged.</speak>

<info>Kif stammers and sighs.</info>

<info>Outside Former DOOP Headquarters. Zapp and Kif emerge from the 
building in civilian clothes.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
One day a man has everything, the next 
day he blows up a $400 billion space 
station and the next day he has nothing. 
It makes you think.</speak>

<speak who="KIF">
No, it doesn't.</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Come, Kif, it's time to begin our life 
as civilians.  That's an order, soldier.</speak>

<info>Kif reluctantly follows.</info>

<info>Montage Zapp and Kif wander through the streets of New New York 
to Harry Nilsson's Everybody's Talkin' ï¿½ la Midnight Cowboy. 
They stare into the window of a cafe and watch people eating 
then turn to passers-by on the street. Kif starts to dance and 
Zapp holds up a pot which passers by drop money into. Later that 
night, Zapp stands on a street corner and a limo pulls up. The 
window goes down and Zapp winks and offers himself to Hattie. 
She shakes her head and points at Kif. Kif gasps and Zapp ushers 
him into the car. The door closes and it speeds off.</info>

<info>Planet Express: Hangar. Fry and Bender wash the ship.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Hey, Bender?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Yeah?</speak>

<info>Fry squirts him with the hose and he giggles and throws his 
sponge at Fry, who ducks. The sponge flies over his head and 
hits Leela in the face.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Alright, this is the third hose fight 
I've broken up today and the second 
one using actual hoses. Now move your 
lazy asses and start scrubbing the ship 
like I ordered you to.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
You don't have to get so mad, Leela.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Yeah, Fry already wiped off some of 
the dirt with his finger.</speak>

<info>He points at a doodle Fry has done of Leela and speech bubble 
with "Yak Yak Yak" in it. Leela growls. The doorbell rings and 
she goes to answer.</info>

<info>Cut to: Planet Express: Entrance. She opens the door to a down-and-out 
Zapp and Kif.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Zapp?</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Leela, I didn't know where else to turn. 
You're the only woman who ever loved 
me.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
I never loved you.</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
I mean physically.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
What do you want?</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Just let me work for a little food. 
Perhaps I could paint a fence, or service 
you sexually, or mop the floors.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
You don't know how to do any of those 
things.</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Kif might.</speak>

<info>Leela prepares to press the slam button when Farnsworth turns 
up.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Leela, who are you talking to?</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Just a broken-down hobo who's hit rock-bottom. 
And his commanding officer.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Why, you're that disgraced starship 
captain.  Having him on staff will distract 
people from our horrendous safety record. 
Come in.</speak>

<info>Planet Express: Meeting Room. Zapp and Kif join the crew around 
the big table.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
I'd like everyone to meet our new employees. 
<info>(whispering)</info> Which ones are new?</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
The green dude and the fat man.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Hmm, I could swear I've never seen that 
robot before either.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
I'm Bender. You know? The lovable rascal.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Oh, yes, yes. My good friend, of course. 
Anyway, whoever you all are, I have 
good news. You'll be making a delivery 
to Stumbos 4, a planet with such high 
gravity you'll most likely be crushed 
under the weight of your own hair. Enjoy.</speak>

<info>The ship flies towards the green planet.</info>

<info>Cut to: Ships Cargo Bay. Zapp peers around the doorway and watches 
Leela pilot the ship. He turns away and the door closes.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
So, this Leela. I know she's a very 
sensuous woman but what manner of captain 
is she?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
She's really strict.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
And mean.</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
I see. Does she by any chance give the 
crewmembers spankings?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
No, she just makes us do work and stuff.</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Good, good. But should she ever institute 
some sort of bare-bottom spanking policy 
let me go in your place. I won't have 
my comrades harmed.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Hey, this guy's alright!</speak>

<info>He takes some bottles of Lï¿½brau out of his chest cabinet and 
passes them around.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Here's to us poor schmoes working for 
the man. Even if he is a hot, sexy, 
female man.</speak>

<info>They guzzle down the beers.</info>

<info>The ship goes into orbit around the planet.</info>

<info>Cut to: Ships Cockpit. Kif stands next to Leela.</info>

<speak who="KIF">
I've computed out landing co-ordinates, 
Captain.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Thanks, Kif. Very nice work.</speak>

<info>Kif sighs then stops.</info>

<speak who="KIF">
Wait, what?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
I said "very nice work".</speak>

<speak who="KIF">
This is the happiest day of my life.</speak>

<info>He hugs her.</info>

<info>Stumbos 4 Surface. The ship lands and the landing gear creaks 
and groans under the immense gravity.</info>

<info>Cut to: Ships Cargo Bay. Leela has assembled Fry, Bender and 
Zapp and holds a clipboard.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
OK, crew, listen up. Your job is to 
delivery these 40 pillows to that hotel.</speak>

<info>She points through the window at a hotel on a hill. Bender holds 
a pillow.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
They're not very heavy but you don't 
hear me not complaining.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
They're not heavy in here because we 
have an anti-grav pump. But once you 
get out on the surface the gravity will 
be very intense.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Hey, no prob', this lead apron'll protect 
me.</speak>

<info>Leela rips it off him.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
I don't want any screw-ups. Use the 
hover-dolly and just deliver one pillow 
at a time.</speak>

<info>She leaves.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Hey, here's an idea, let's deliver all 
the pillows at once.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Yeah!</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
That's using the old noodle!</speak>

<info>Stumbos 4 Surface. The ships cargo lift comes down and Zapp 
pushes the hover-dolly off it with all the pillows on it. The 
three are hit by the enormous gravity. Bender struggles to stay 
upright but his legs are crushed under him. Fry tries as well 
but his legs buckle. Zapp struggles too.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Come on, girdle. Hold!</speak>

<info>His girdle breaks and his huge flabby gut spills out from under 
his sweatshirt. He groans. So does the hover-dolly. Then it breaks.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Uh-oh.</speak>

<info>Leela and Kif walk down the ships steps. Her hair is pushed 
flat and Kif is squished.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
What the hell happened?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Some breaking occured, the dolly was 
involved, that's about all we know.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
I told you dumb apes not to overload 
it. Each of those pillows weighs 150lbs 
here.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Alright, don't get your panties in a 
knot. We'll just use the back-up dolly.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
I'll start loading up the pillows.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
No way, Jack. You disobeyed an order, 
so now you have to deliver all 40 pillows 
by hand.</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Let me ask you a serious question, Leela: 
Does the company that made your bra 
make a girdle as well? I ask because 
a friend of mine--</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Just get to work.</speak>

<info>Time Lapse. Fry, Zapp and Bender drag the pillows across the 
surface, leaving huge furrows in the ground.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
<info>(mocking)</info> I'm Leela, get to work, neh 
neh neh.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
I agree.</speak>

<info>Ships Cockpit. Leela looks bored stiff listening to Kif.</info>

<speak who="KIF">
The point is, it's just so humiliating 
working for that man. Once, he actually 
ordered me to ... shave his armpits 
while he was in the bathtub. So, I said--</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Y'know, why don't we talk about something 
besides Zapp for a while?</speak>

<speak who="KIF">
Oh, alright. Um ... well ... how 'bout 
then, um...OK, well, there he was in 
the tub, alright?</speak>

<info>Leela sighs.</info>

<info>Stumbos 4 Surface. Zapp, Fry and Bender continue the delivery. 
They struggle and stop. Thunder cracks above.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Ah, some good old high-gravity rain. 
That'll cool us off.</speak>

<info>He holds his tongue out and the heavy rain knocks him to the 
ground. They crawl under a rock out of the rain.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
This is all Leela's fault.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Yeah. If she had let us use the back-up 
dolly, we could have broken it, given 
up and gone home by now.</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Y'know boys, a good captain needs many 
skills, such as boldness, daring and 
a velour uniform. And I'm not convinced 
Leela has any of those things.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Ah, Leela's not that bad. I just wish 
she didn't make us work so much.</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Back when I was captain all I asked 
from my men was their complete loyalty. 
If I had that, then for all I cared 
they could sit around the whole day 
drinking beer in their underpants.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Beer?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Underpants?</speak>

<info>He and Bender look at each other and grin.</info>

<info>Ships Cockpit.</info>

<speak who="KIF">
But now, Zapp's not captain anymore. 
I'm free!  Oh, you hear that? I'm actually 
laughing!</speak>

<info>Enter Zapp, Fry and Bender.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
This is a mutiny.</speak>

<info>Kif sighs.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
You're outta here, lady. Zapp's the 
new captain.</speak>

<info>Zapp handcuffs Leela. Fry already has his shirt off and raises 
a beer.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
All hail the new captain.</speak>

<info>He unzips his trousers and lets them fall down.</info>

<info>The ship speeds away from Stumbos 4.</info>

<info>Cut to: Ships Cockpit. Zapp is sat in the pilot's seat.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Leela, you might be a formidible do-er 
of the nasty but I am forced to relieve 
you of your post.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
On what grounds, you slobbering oaf?</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Failure to prevent a mutiny. Throw her 
in the brig.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
We don't have a brig.</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Then throw her in the laundry room, 
which will hereafter be referred to 
as "the brig".</speak>

<info>Ships Laundry Room. Bender and Fry lead Leela inside.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
You really don't want me to be captain 
anymore?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
You got it, genius.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
But, didn't I do a good job?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
You were mean and you yelled and you 
made us do all that work.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Sometimes a captain needs to do those 
things. Besides I, I thought we were 
friends.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Yeah, well, you shouldn't have been 
such a mean captain then.</speak>

<info>He turns and leaves.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Don't worry, Leela, soon we'll be able 
to look back on this and laugh.</speak>

<info>He walks out, looks back and laughs insanely.</info>

<info>Cut to: Ships Cockpit. Fry and Bender return. Zapp is wearing 
his DOOP uniform.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Back in my old uniform, and it nearly 
still fits. Even after all that fattening 
hobo cuisine.</speak>

<info>Kif, back in his uniform too, holds up Zapp's other clothes.</info>

<speak who="KIF">
What shall I do with your civilian clothes, 
sir?</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Take them to the laundry-brig.  So, 
do I have your loyalty, men?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
To the ends of the universe.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Ten hundred percent!</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
That's not nearly loyal enough. I order 
you to sit around and drink beer until 
you're as loyal as Kif here.</speak>

<info>He hands them some beers and Kif returns.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Yes, sir, sir!</speak>

<speak who="KIF">
Um, may I have a beer, sir?</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
No. You're loyal enough already. Meanwhile, 
I have a plan. We will single-handedly 
attack our archenemy the Neutral Planet.</speak>

<speak who="KIF">
Oh, jeez.</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Once the neutral war machine lies in 
ruins, I'll be a hero again and the 
DOOP will reinstate me as captain.</speak>

<speak who="KIF">
But, sir, that plan makes no sense.</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Maybe not to you, Kif, but if I recall 
correctly, you were court-martialed 
in disgrace.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Ooh, burn!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Nailed you, buddy!</speak>

<info>They clink their bottles.</info>

<info>The Planet Express ship flies towards the neutrally grey Neutral 
Planet.</info>

<info>Cut to: Ships Cockpit. Zapp is in the pilot's seat and Fry and 
Bender man their stations.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Prepare to continue the epic struggle 
between good and neutral.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
This is awesome! We're gonna be like 
pow-pow-pow, and they're gonna be like 
...  ... and then we'll have pancakes 
to celebrate and I'll be like...</speak>

<info>He makes pancake-eating noises.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Precisely. Now, in the name of all that 
is good and honourable, we'll call the 
Neutral President with a message of 
peace, then blast him.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Yes sir, sirdy-sir-sir-sir!</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Fly the white flag of war.</speak>

<info>The white flag is hoisted on a flagpole atop the ships laser 
turret.</info>

<info>Neutral Capitol. The Neutral headquarters, located in Neutropolis, 
bears the motto "Live Free Or Don't". The Neutral President's 
office is quite small and decorated with various shades of grey. 
He sits at his desk and an aide stands next to him. Zapp is on 
a huge wall screen.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
This is Zapp Brannigan of the good 
ship ... Planet Express Ship. I come 
swinging the olive branch of peace.</speak>

<speak who="NEUTRAL PRESIDENT">
All I know is my gut says maybe.</speak>

<info>Cut to: Ships Cockpit. Zapp turns the communication screen off.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
What now, chief?</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Now we crash the ship into their headquarters, 
killing them in a hellish firestorm 
from which no living thing can escape.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Good, good, then what?</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Then your mission is complete. I, meanwhile, 
will have ejected to safety, wearing 
the only spacesuit on board.</speak>

<info>Fry and Bender cheer and high-five.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Wait a second. Is this plan gonna kill 
us?</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Of course. What do you think I meant 
by "loyalty"? Now help me into the only 
spacesuit. It looks a bit sweaty in 
there so you may need to apply baby 
powder.</speak>

<info>Ships Laundry Room. Leela, still handcuffed, folds some sheets 
while Kif pours some washing powder into a cup. Fry and Bender 
run in.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Leela, we want you to be captain again.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Let me guess. He cancelled naptime? 
He ran out of beer?  So he's about 
to kill us?</speak>

<info>They nod.</info>

<info>Ships Cockpit. Zapp is now wearing the spacesuit. Enter Leela, 
Kif, Fry and Bender.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
We want Leela to be captain again.</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
So it's mutiny is it? I never thought 
I'd see the day. Come, Kif, let's eject. 
I found a children's spacesuit you can 
wear.</speak>

<speak who="KIF">
To be honest, sir, I'd rather stay here 
with Captain Leela. She actually listens 
to what I have to--</speak>

<info>Leela shoves the helmet on his head and Zapp puts the suit on 
him which is decorated with stars and planets. He picks him up 
using a handle on the back and Kif kicks and mumbles before finally 
sighing. They leave the room and fly away from the ship. Leela 
wrestles with the wheel.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Oh, no! He's disabled the steering. 
We're gonna crash!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Leela save me ... and yourself, I guess 
... and my banjo.  And Fry.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
OK, OK. We have one chance. Are you 
willing to do what I say as captain?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Absolutely.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Even if I make you work hard?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
As your God is my witness.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Then go get the hover-dolly you didn't 
break and load all the dark matter into 
the left engine.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Oh, man, that crap's heavy.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
And warm.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Just do it.</speak>

<info>The ship streaks through the planet's atmosphere and starts 
to burn up.</info>

<info>Cut to: Neutral Capitol. An alarm dings and the aide runs in.</info>

<speak who="NEUTRAL PRESIDENT">
If I don't survive, tell my wife, "Hello".</speak>

<info>Ships Cockpit. Leela turns on the communication screen.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Hurry! I don't wanna die at the age 
of 25.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Honey, unless we hit a time warp, I 
wouldn't worry about it.</speak>

<info>Cut to: Ships Engine Room. Fry and Bender pull the dolly towards 
the left engine.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
It's too low.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Quick.</speak>

<info>He lies underneath the dolly and Fry works him like a car jack, 
tipping the pellets into the fire.</info>

<info>Cut to: Outside Ship. The ships engine flares up and it turns 
away from the planet.</info>

<info>Ships Cockpit.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
You did it! You actually did it!</speak>

<info>Fry and Bender cheer and high-five.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
And no one will have to punish anyone 
for the mutiny.</speak>

<info>Former DOOP Headquarters. Everyone is back in the courtroom 
again.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
And so, when Captain Leela panicked, 
perhaps distracted by female troubles, 
my quick thinking allowed me to do whatever 
I did to save the day.</speak>

<speak who="GLAB">
Captain Leela, is this rambling story 
of magic and heroism true?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Well, actually--</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
<info>(whispering)</info> That a girl! If they don't 
take him back we can keep him as captain.</speak>

<info>Zapp winks at Leela and click-clicks. She stands up.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Your Honour, it's all true: My female 
incompetence, Zapp's cat-like reflexes, 
the stuff that made no sense, all of 
it.</speak>

<info>The crowd gasps.</info>

<speak who="GLAB">
In that case, Zapp Brannigan, I hereby 
restore your rank and parking privileges.</speak>

<info>She bangs her gavel and the crowd cheers. Fry hugs Bender and 
high-fives Leela.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Oh, foo!</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Come, Kif, we've got work to do.</speak>

<info>He mimes shaving his armpits and tosses Kif the razor. Kif sighs 
and turns to Leela.</info>

<speak who="KIF">
I-I'll call and tell you about it.</speak>

<info>She sighs.</info>

<info>Planet Express: Hangar. Leela looks over the railings and watches 
Fry and Bender scrub the ship.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Leela, I just want you to know that 
even though you're mean, you're the 
best captain ever.</speak>

<info>Leela smiles.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Yeah, you're one dynamite lady. Can 
we have a week off?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
No.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Please?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Come on, Captain.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Oh, alright.</speak>

<info>Farnsworth passes behind her.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
No time off.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Aw, man.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Let's mutiny!</speak>

<info>THE END</info></xml>
