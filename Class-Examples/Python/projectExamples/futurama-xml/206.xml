                         Let me ask you a serious question, Leela: 
                         Does the company that made your bra 
                         make a girdle as well? I ask because 
                         a friend of mine--

                         The point is, it's just so humiliating 
                         working for that man. Once, he actually

                         Y'know boys, a good captain needs many 
                         skills, such as boldness, daring and 
                         a velour uniform. And I'm not convinced 
                         Leela has any of those things.
