               rendition of The Grumpy Snail comes from Fry's room. Bender, 
               wearing pyjama trousers, pokes his head around the corner from 
               his room.</note>

                         I know I should but I just can't. Remember 
                         when I had those stomach worms that 
                         made me smart? I could play the holophonor 
                         and it made Leela like me.  Hey Bender, 
                         as long as you know, I have a holophonor 
                         recital Tuesday and I'd really like 
                         to have somebody there. Please?

               <note>Time Lapse. Everyone sits down and watches the kid with the 
               untidy hair play Beethoven's F�r Elise on his holophonor. The 
               holographic smoke whirls around and forms a picture of an elegantly 
               dressed man and woman. The man plays an open grand piano and 
               the woman sits on it. Some steps fly around the back of the man 
               and the woman gets up and walks up them. The man follows her 
               as they climb into the clouds. A barrel rolls under them and 
               scores 100 points for each like in the Donkey Kong game. The 
               audience applauds. Bender leans over to the kid's mother.</note>

                         No catch. I'll merely pick a robot at 
                         random from somewhere in the universe 
                         - probably one you've never even met 
                         - and then I'll remove his hands and 
                         switch them for yours.  It's just the 
                         sort of guy I am, what do you say?

               her,
 
               But if I keep them,

               And she marries him,

               Then he probably won't want me dating her.
