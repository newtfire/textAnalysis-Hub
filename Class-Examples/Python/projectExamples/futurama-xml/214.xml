                         the Professor at her but she kept on 
                         coming. So had to hit her with this

                         You're right. Nothing is over so long 
                         as there's one thin ray of hope.

                         you'd come here rather than follow proper

                         I'm afraid he's lost in the master in 
                         pile. And it would take some sort of 
                         giant mechanical atomic powered sorting 
                         machine to find him.

               With a foot and a half of water.

               Everyone was alright but I cried all night

               It blew my alphabet blocks out of order.

               And they said "This boy's born to be a bureaucrat,

               Born to be all obsessive and snotty."

               I made my friends and relations file long applications

               To get into my 10th birthday party.

                         Bureaucrat Conrad you are technically 
                         correct - the best kind of correct. 
                         I hereby promote you to grade 37.  And 
                         as for you. (shouting) Guards!  (talking) 
                         Bring me the forms I need to fill out 
                         to have her taken away!

                         Well, it looks like I'll be needing 
                         my heroic bureaucrat back. At severely 
                         reduced pay of course.

                         What about me? Can I come back at severely 
                         reduced pay?
