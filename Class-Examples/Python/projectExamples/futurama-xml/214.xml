<info>Planet Express: Hermes' Office. Hermes takes a form out of the 
in-tray.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
Finally, the last form of the day. Welcome 
to stampy-town. Population - five!  
And now for the finishing touch.  Ah, 
the cycle of bureaucracy.  Sweet gorilla 
of Manila! A letter from the Central 
Bureaucracy!  <info>(reading)</info> Attention Hermes 
Conrad, you are about to recieve a letter 
from the Central Bureaucracy.  My God! 
It's from the Central Bureaucracy!</speak>

<info>Planet Express: Lounge. Fry and Bender sit on the couch with 
their feet up watching TV. Enter Leela.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
I'm having a poker game tonight with 
some friends from my old cryogenics 
job. You guys interested?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
I don't know. I only gamble with chumps.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
I'll play.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
I'm in.</speak>

<info>Enter Zoidberg.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Leela, Fry, robot. No matter what it 
is you're doing tonight, I'm available.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
We're playing poker. but I'm warning 
you, my friends are serious players.</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Bah, big shots. I say let the dice do 
the talking.</speak>

<info>Time Lapse. A green card table has been set up in the middle 
of the room. Leela rips open a packet of Cruditï¿½s and pours a 
powder onto the table. She adds water and a plant grows from 
the powder and drops things like fruit and pretzels onto a tray. 
Enter Hermes humming.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Wow, you look happy. Is someone fired?</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
Better. The Central Bureaucracy is conducting 
an inspection tomorrow. I'll finally 
be promoted to grade 35, the 35th highest 
grade there is.</speak>

<info>He starts to walk out the other door.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Hermes, wait! We're having a poker party. 
Stay and whip off a batch of your famous 
jerk dip.</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
Sorry. I spent all day putting my office 
in order. Now I got to go home and relax 
the traditional Jamaican way - a glass 
of warm milk and good night sleep.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Jamaican? I thought you were some kinda 
outer space potato man.</speak>

<info>The doorbell rings.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Ah that must be my old boss.</speak>

<info>Planet Express: Entrance. Leela opens the door. Enter Ipgee 
in his cryogenics uniform.</info>

<speak who="IPGEE">
Hello Leela, you're fired.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
I know.</speak>

<speak who="IPGEE">
I'm sorry but it's just that you're 
over a year late for work at this point.</speak>

<info>Enter Terry and Lou in their lab coats.</info>

<speak who="TERRY"><info>(DRAMATICALLY)</info>
Let the games begin!</speak>

<info>Planet Express: Lounge. The poker players are sat around the 
table.</info>

<speak who="IPGEE">
So I told Leela, "Your request for a 
date is most flattering but I must decline." 
These office romances never work out. 
Afterall, that is how I met my horrible 
wife.</speak>

<info>Everyone except Leela laughs.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
But you never wore your ring. I didn't 
know you had a wife.</speak>

<speak who="IPGEE">
And my wife doesn't know I have a job. 
I keep my personal and professional 
lives serparate.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
C'mon, let's deal. You'll have plenty 
of time to talk when you're poor.</speak>

<info>He puts on some shades.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
What's with the specs Bender?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
They're my lucky shades. I stole them 
off some lucky guy while his lucky seeing 
eye dog was taking a whiz.</speak>

<info>He takes the deck from Ipgee, puts them in his mouth, shuffles 
them and deals them by spitting them out around the table.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Hey!</speak>

<info>Four of his cards are stuck in an apple he is holding. Bender 
spits one more card at him and it cuts off the fork in his hair. 
Zoidberg fumbles with the hand he is dealt.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
I can't spell anything with these cards.</speak>

<info>Time Lapse. The game continues and Zoidberg has lost the shirt 
off his back. Bender on the other hand enjoys a winning streak 
as he wears Zoidberg's shirt and has a few piles of chips in 
front of him. He hums.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Finally, I have a good claw. See?  Three 
human females, a number and a king giving 
himself brain surgery.</speak>

<info>Fry tuts.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
It doesn't matter how many human females 
you have, Bender's on a hot streak.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Uh, what can I say? Must be my lucky 
shades!  Nothing, nothing, crap, crap, 
garbage.  Read 'em and leak saltwater!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Oh man!</speak>

<speak who="TERRY">
My baby's milk money!</speak>

<info>Bender takes his winnings and chuckles.</info>

<speak who="IPGEE">
Oh I am broke. What will I tell my horrible 
wife?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
If I were you I'd be more worried about 
that tapeworm going to town on your 
intestines.</speak>

<info>He starts to shuffle the pack again.</info>

<speak who="IPGEE">
Let me see those glasses.</speak>

<info>Bender chokes on the cards and spits them out. Terry and Lou 
stand up.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Um...uh...</speak>

<info>Ipgee takes the glasses and looks through them.</info>

<speak who="IPGEE">
Oh my various gods! X-Ray specs!</speak>

<info>Bender scoops up his winnings and starts backing away from the 
cryogenisists.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Guys, I swear those are prescription. 
I need them for reading stuff - on the 
other side of stuff.</speak>

<info>He walks back towards the door and backs into Zoidberg.</info>

<speak who="LOU">
Cheater!</speak>

<speak who="IPGEE">
Get him!</speak>

<speak who="TERRY">
Break his neck!</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
No don't hurt him! He's my best friend!</speak>

<info>Bender pushes him over and legs it.</info>

<info>Cut to: Planet Express: Corridor. Bender stops outside Hermes' 
office, hides inside and closes the door behind him. Ipgee, Terry 
and Lou follow him.</info>

<info>Outside Planet Express. The next morning Hermes walks into the 
building, changes the sign from "Closed" to "Opening Soon" to 
"Open."</info>

<info>Cut to: Planet Express: Corridor. Hermes walks towards his office 
and opens the door. Files and papers fall out.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
Great cow of Moscow!</speak>

<info>Cut to: Planet Express: Hermes' Office. The room is a wreck. 
Electrical things sizzle, filing cabinets are overturned and 
papers are littered around the room. Bender is in pieces. His 
head pops out of his body.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Uh, it was ghosts! Big ones! And a tornado!</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
Oh! I'll never pass inspection now! 
They'll bust me lower than a limbo stick 
- at carnival time.  <info>(crying)</info> And that's 
as low as limbo sticks get.</speak>

<info>Fry puts his hand on Hermes' shoulder.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Aw hey c'mon don't worry. We'll watch 
you clean up.</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
It's too late. The inspector will be 
here in exactly one second.</speak>

<info>Cut to: Planet Express: Corridor. The door opens and a woman 
wearing a dark green suit walks in. Her hair is in a tight bun 
and she wears glasses.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
Who the hell are you?</speak>

<speak who="MORGAN">
Morgan Proctor, bureaucrat grade 19.</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
Hermes Conrad, bureaucrat grade 36.</speak>

<info>They exchange papers and stamp them.</info>

<speak who="MORGAN">
Enough friendly banter. Shall we begin 
the inspection?</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
This way please.</speak>

<info>He ushers her into his office.</info>

<info>Cut to: Planet Express: Hermes' Office.</info>

<speak who="FRY"><info>(WHISPERING)</info>
Jeez Hermes, you seem awfully calm about 
this.</speak>

<speak who="HERMES"><info>(WHISPERING)</info>
Don't worry. I have a plan.</speak>

<info>Planet Express: Attic Balcony. Hermes stands on the railings 
around the balcony.</info>

<speak who="HERMES"><info>(SHOUTING)</info>
I'm going to jump!</speak>

<info>The crew look up from street level.</info>

<speak who="AMY"><info>(SHOUTING)</info>
No!</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG"><info>(SHOUTING)</info>
No!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER"><info>(SHOUTING)</info>
Do a flip!</speak>

<info>Cut to: Outside Planet Express.</info>

<speak who="LEELA"><info>(SHOUTING)</info>
Don't do it Hermes! You have so much 
to live for!</speak>

<info>Cut to: Planet Express: Attic Balcony.</info>

Farnsworth <info>(shouting)</info> ...Other people need it you know.

<info>At street level LaBarbara's car screeches to a stop.</info>

<speak who="LABARBARA"><info>(SHOUTING)</info>
Husband! Nooo!</speak>

<info>Cut to: Outside Planet Express.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
Outta my way wife...!</speak>

<info>Cut to: Planet Express: Attic Balcony.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
...I wasn't cut out to be a bureaucrat 
anyway. I'm only anal 78.36% of the 
time. I'm not worthy to stamp a form. 
So I'll stamp the pavement with my flabby 
body.</speak>

<speak who="MORGAN"><info>(SHOUTING)</info>
Bureaucrat Conrad...!</speak>

<info>Cut to: Outside Planet Express.</info>

<speak who="MORGAN"><info>(SHOUTING)</info>
...If you complete your death transaction 
with out filing a suicide and/or falling 
accident permit, you will be posthumously 
demoted.</speak>

<info>Cut to: Planet Express: Attic Balcony.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
Life. Death. Either way I'm demoted 
to a tiny cubicle.</speak>

<info>Planet Express: Meeting Room. Hermes sits at the table shaking.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
Sweet something of...of someplace.</speak>

<speak who="MORGAN">
As your superior I hereby relieve you 
of duty. Consider yourself on paid vacation.</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
Oh! The ultimate penalty.</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
I recommend the health cure on Spa 5, 
the sauna planet. Here, read.</speak>

<info>He hands a leaflet to LaBarbara.</info>

<speak who="LABARBARA">
Spa 5? Is it good?</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Oh, it's wonderful! I don't know anything 
about it but they send me a bucket of 
krill for every patient I send.</speak>

<speak who="MORGAN">
Naturally I'll have to assign a bureaucrat 
to fill in for Hermes while he's away. 
I assign me, I accept, welcome aboard.</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Then it's settled. Hermes will relax 
and Zoidberg will eat! Hurrah!</speak>

<info>Planet Express: Morgan's Office. Morgan changes Hermes' name 
thing so it has her name on it. Fry, Leela and Bender are with 
her.</info>

<speak who="MORGAN">
I've been reviewing your corporate records. 
Regarding last Monday's delivery, why 
did it take twice as long as scheduled?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Fry got his head stuck in a crater.</speak>

<speak who="FRY"><info>(ASHAMED)</info>
I thought it would fit.</speak>

<info>Morgan scribbles something down on a piece of paper.</info>

<speak who="MORGAN">
And during this period of head-crater 
interaction, what were you doing?</speak>

<info>She points at Bender.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Martini drinking contests with the autopilot. 
I would've had him this time but we 
ran out of olives.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
I can explain.</speak>

<speak who="MORGAN">
You really think you can explain how 
you left port without a full compliment 
of olives? I think not.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA"><info>(QUIETLY)</info>
What is this, high school?</speak>

<speak who="MORGAN">
Locker check!</speak>

<info>Planet Express: Locker Room. Morgan opens Leela's locker. There 
is a small purple bag on the top shelf and Leela's green jacket 
is hanging in the bottom. The zip is halfway up the coat. Or 
halfway down. Depends how you view life.</info>

<speak who="MORGAN">
Why isn't this jacket in alphabetical 
order?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
What?</speak>

<speak who="MORGAN">
The zipper. It should be at the bottom.</speak>

<info>She pulls it down and closes the locker. She opens Bender's 
locker. On the shelf is a nut. She picks it up and shakes her 
head.</info>

<speak who="BENDER"><info>(ASHAMED)</info>
Hey, sometimes a guy gets lonely.</speak>

<info>Morgan closes his locker and opens Fry's. Loads of empty cans 
fall out and Slurm dribbles over them. Some socks and a blernsball 
cap fall out too and flies buzz around the pile of rubbish. Morgan 
steps back and looks horrified.</info>

<speak who="MORGAN">
I - I've never seen anything like this. 
Why is there yoghurt in this cap?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Uh, I can explain that. See, it used 
to be milk and, well, time makes fools 
of us all.</speak>

<speak who="MORGAN">
You are all dismissed. Fry, I will speak 
to you alone.</speak>

<info>Fry gasps as Bender and Leela walk out and Morgan locks the 
door.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Uh wait, this is the other Fry's locker. 
I'm Phry with a "Ph."</speak>

<info>Fry gasps and pushes Morgan away.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
What the hell's going on? I thought 
you were anti-dirty not pro-dirty.</speak>

<info>She pushes him against the lockers.</info>

<speak who="MORGAN">
I'm surrounded by neat freaks everyday. 
There's nothing kinkier to me than a 
filthy slop-jock like you!</speak>

<speak who="FRY"><info>(BASHFUL)</info>
Oh stop!</speak>

<info>She kisses him again then moves away and puts her glasses back 
on.</info>

<speak who="MORGAN">
Now listen you filthy pig. No-one can 
know about us. If anyone asks I'll deny 
it.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Just like very other girl I've dated.</speak>

<info>Outside Spa 5 Fitness Camp. From outside the building looks 
like a pleasant fitness spa with nice trees and a sunny sky. 
The sign indicates it is recommended by Dr Zoidberg.</info>

<info>Spa 5 Fitness Camp. A woman keeps everyone fit and healthy...</info>

<info>The fitness camp is a huge mine. People there looking to get 
healthy chip away at the walls of the mines. LaBarbara peddles 
on a bike which powers a conveyor belt and carries away everything 
the miners chip off the walls.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
Curse that Dr Zoidberg! If I get out 
of here, he'll be looking down the business 
end of a shrimp fork!</speak>

<info>An Australian guy dressed in a vest and a hat turns around.</info>

<speak who="AUSTRALIAN GUY">
Give him one for me too mate. I don't 
know why I go to him.</speak>

<info>A laser bolt flies past the two and hits the mine wall.</info>

<info>They work harder.</info>

<info>Planet Express: Meeting Room. Morgan, Farnsworth, Leela, Fry 
and Bender are sat around the table.</info>

<speak who="MORGAN">
...and for those six and a half reasons, 
I am demoting Leela to co-pilot.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Co-pilot? Under who?</speak>

<speak who="MORGAN">
The autopilot.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
That drunk?!</speak>

<info>Bender laughs.</info>

<speak who="MORGAN">
Mr Bender you are now in charge of co-ordinating 
the Professor's bodily functions.</speak>

<info>Bender suddenly stops laughing.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
That's a full time job.</speak>

<speak who="MORGAN">
And Fry, as for you, I am promoting 
you to executive delivery boy. You will 
no longer go on deliveries and you will 
have your own office next to mine.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
All right!</speak>

<info>He stands up and looks at Leela for a high five. She doesn't 
respond. He turns to Bender. He doesnt respond either.</info>

<speak who="MORGAN">
Mr Bender would you high five him so 
we can continue this meeting?  And on 
the rebound?  Meeting adjourned.</speak>

<info>Planet Express: Fry's Office. Fry has his feet up on his desk 
and drinks a can of Slurm. He burps and wipes his mouth with 
his tie.</info>

<speak who="AMY">
I can't figure why she's so nice to 
you Fry.</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
She's a hateful monster this Morgan. 
She scolded and hit me. I tell you she's 
risking my friendship with her.</speak>

<info>Enter Bender covered in mud and twigs.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Bender, what happened to you?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Morgan made me walk the Professor. There 
we were in the park when suddenly some 
old lady says I stole her purse. I chucked 
the Professor at her but she kept on 
coming. So had to hit her with this 
purse I found. Ah, the point is it's 
Morgan's fault. That pencil pushing 
scazwag.  Why if she were here I'd - 
Uh oh is she behind me?</speak>

<info>He feels behind his head.</info>

<speak who="MORGAN">
No. I'm in front of you!</speak>

<info>Bender squeals.</info>

<info>Robot Arms Apartments Corridor. The doorbell rings and Fry answers 
it. Morgan is there.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Morgan? It's 3am.</speak>

<info>Cut to: Fry and Bender's Apartment.</info>

<speak who="MORGAN">
I know. A skunk knocked over my garbage 
and suddenly all I could think of was 
you.  My God, it's so...repulsive.  
So uh, this is where you eat?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Eat and sleep.</speak>

<info>He pulls the sheet away.</info>

<speak who="MORGAN">
Oh Fry!</speak>

<info>She kisses him and pushes him onto the bed.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Uh wait, Bender's my rooommate. He could 
be back any second.</speak>

<speak who="MORGAN">
Not likely. I ordered him to flush out 
the Professor's earwax.</speak>

<info>She takes off her glasses, pulls her hair out of the bun and 
starts unbuttoning her suit.</info>

<info>Cut to: Robot Arms Apartments Corridor. Bender approaches his 
apartment holding something and walks in.</info>

<info>Cut to: Fry and Bender's Apartment.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Hey Fry, I made you a candle with - 
What the?  Oh now I see! Now I get 
it. Now the pieces are falling into 
place. The office, the promotion, that 
dwarf in my book club who steals my 
opinions.  It's all coming together 
now!</speak>

<info>Outside Robot Arms Apartments. Morgan zooms off in a taxi.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
I must say this opens my eyes! Another 
case closed my dear Watson.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Morgan, come back! He's stuck in a loop!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
For I was blind but now I see!</speak>

<info>Outside Planet Express.</info>

<speak who="BENDER"><info>FROM INSIDE</info>
The cat's out of the bag now!</speak>

<info>Cut to: Planet Express: Fry's Office. Bender leans back in a 
chair with a cigar in his mouth.</info>

<speak who="MORGAN">
Mr Bender about last night. that was 
just a...a misunderstanding.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Oh you didn't understand? Well let me 
explain. You......were having sex with 
you.</speak>

<info>He points at Morgan.</info>

<speak who="MORGAN">
No. You see, a bureaucrat of my rank 
isn't supposed to fraternize.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
That's what makes it so juicy. Its the 
forbidden fruit angle everybody loves. 
First I'll say "You'll never guess who 
saw Fry and Morgan doing it!" and they'll 
say "Who Bender, who?" and I'll say 
"It was lovable......old Bender."</speak>

<info>Morgan has put something in the back of his neck. A 3.5" disk 
comes out of the back of Bender's head and Morgan takes it.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Hey, what did you do to him?</speak>

<speak who="MORGAN">
I downloaded his brain. Everything that 
is Bender is right here. His mind, his 
memories, his in-your-face interface.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
But, but...Bender need brain...for...smart 
making!  What did you do now? Stop doing 
things!</speak>

<speak who="MORGAN">
I sent the disk to be filed at the Central 
Bureaucracy. I did what I had to do 
Fry. He was a bad robot.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
No, he was a bad friend. I want him 
back right now.</speak>

<speak who="MORGAN">
Then you should have filed a request 
20 years ago.</speak>

<info>Fry growls.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
I'm sick of you and your bureaucracy.</speak>

<info>He slides everything off his desk. Morgan grins.</info>

<speak who="MORGAN">
Dirty boy! Dirty boy!</speak>

<info>She dives on him.</info>

<info>Time Lapse. Morgan is gone and the rest of the crew are there.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
You and Morgan were having an affair?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
I couldn't help it. She loved me because 
of the part of me that's a slob and 
I loved her because of the part of me 
that's desperate.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Poor Bender. Without his brain he's 
become all quiet and helpful. We've 
got to go to the Central Bureaucracy 
and get that disk back!</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
Yeah!</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Oh yes we must, yes.</speak>

<info>There is a long pause.</info>

<speak who="AMY">
Why?</speak>

<info>Everyone looks around trying to think.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Well, those arguments aside, we're still 
going.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
You can't just waltz into the Central 
Bureaucracy. It's a tangled web of red 
tape and regulations. I've never been 
but a friend of mine went completely 
mad trying to find the washroom there.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Then we'll need a guide. Someone who's 
been there before.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Oh I've been there. Lot's of times!</speak>

<info>He laughs insanely.</info>

<info>Spa 5 Fitness Camp. Hermes watches the Australian guy pushing 
a mining cart.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
Look at that. The carts go out full 
but they come in empty. It's criminally 
inefficient.</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
But don't you see? They could increase 
efficiency 4% if they used the empty 
carts to haul in heavy mining machinery.</speak>

<info>He pulls a chain and a huge drill head falls into Australian 
Guy's cart. He grumbles.</info>

<speak who="AUSTRALIAN GUY">
Oh Lord!</speak>

<info>Hermes smiles.</info>

<info>Outside Central Bureaucracy. The building is a huge white cube 
with "Central Bureaucracy Est. 2159 A.D. License Pending" engraved 
on it. The queue to get in snakes back for miles. Fry, Leela, 
Farnsworth, Amy and Bender join the end of it behind an old man 
with a Methusala-like beard.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Man, how long is this gonna take?</speak>

<speak who="OLD MAN">
I'm still waiting on my birth certificate.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Well it doesn't look like I'll make 
it inside with the rest of you. Uh but 
good luck. Just leave me where I drop.</speak>

<info>The queue moves backwards.</info>

<speak who="OLD MAN">
Oh great, someone had a baby!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Come on, I have a better idea.</speak>

<info>Time Lapse. The crew are right outside the building now. Leela 
talks to a grade 53 bureaucrat.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Excuse me? We're from the Planet Express 
delivery company. We're here to deliver 
a robot.</speak>

<info>The bureaucrat laughs.</info>

<speak who="GRADE 53">
Looks like we've got a new office cut 
up!</speak>

<info>He opens a door and the crew walk inside.</info>

<info>Cut to: Central Bureaucracy Corridor. The corridors are lined 
with thousands of filing cabinets and message tubes snake around 
overhead with red tubes flying through them. A bureaucrat screams.</info>

<speak who="GRADE 41">
Look out, look out! I'm going to crash 
my slow-mobile! I had to swerve to avoid 
you.</speak>

<info>He slowly heads for a pile of boxes.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
While you're crashing, could you tell 
us where all these canisters end up?</speak>

<speak who="GRADE 41">
Oh you want Central Filing.</speak>

<info>The grateful crew walk on.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
OK.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
OK.</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
OK thanks.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Wonderful.</speak>

<speak who="GRADE 41"><info>(SCREAMING)</info>
Nooo!</speak>

<info>He eventually hits the pile of boxes and they wobble.</info>

<info>Time Lapse. The crew ask a grade 20 for directions.</info>

<speak who="GRADE 20">
Central Filing? Of course I know where 
that is. I'm a grade 20.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Where is it?</speak>

<speak who="GRADE 20">
I can't tell you. What do I look like? 
A grade 16?</speak>

<info>A red tube lands next to Leela. She sighs.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
We're getting nowhere slowly. Here, 
I'll address this to the Central Filing 
room.  Then we'll track it using my 
wrist-lojack-amater.</speak>

<info>She sends the tube away and points her wrist thing around.</info>

<speak who="WRIST THING">
Cold. Cold. Warmer. Hot hot hot hot 
hot hot.</speak>

<info>Time Lapse. The crew run through a dark corridor following the 
message tube. A huge metal door in front of them starts to close. 
They duck under it and Leela drags Farnsworth through. Bender 
walks straight through it leaving a Bender-shaped hole.</info>

<info>Time Lapse. The crew pass a sleeping Beholder-like creature 
from Dungeons &amp; Dragons. Bender walks into it. It wakes up, growls 
and starts shooting blue lights from the things on it's head. 
The crew walk out and the Behold - another bureaucrat shouts 
after them.</info>

<speak who="GRADE 11">
Please don't tell my supervisor I was 
sleeping.</speak>

<info>Outside Central Filing. The crew stop outside the door.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
This is it. We'll just run in, grab 
Bender's disk and run out. Got it?</speak>

<info>The crew nod in agreement. Leela opens the door and everyone 
gasps.</info>

<info>Cut to: Central Filing. The message tubes all converge in the 
middle of the room and there are tens of thousands of red tubes 
in a huge pile. The room towers so high into the air that there 
is a bi-plane flying around the clouds near the ceiling.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
We'll never find that disk will we Bender?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
You're right. Nothing is over so long 
as there's one thin ray of hope.</speak>

<speak who="MORGAN">
Lost something?  I should have known 
you'd come here rather than follow proper 
procedure. And I did know. And that's 
why I came here.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Listen Morgan, We're through, you're 
an evil heartless woman and I never 
wanna see you again. However would you 
help us get Bender back for old times 
sake?</speak>

<info>Morgan points at the pile of red tubes.</info>

<speak who="MORGAN">
I'm afraid he's lost in the master in 
pile. And it would take some sort of 
giant mechanical atomic powered sorting 
machine to find him.</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
You rang?</speak>

<info>On another level of Central Filing Hermes and LaBarbara spin 
around in a swivel chair.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Dammit Hermes, just jump already. Stop 
hogging that healthy liver.</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
No, I want to live. Organising that 
forced labour spa rekindled my lifelong 
love of bureaucracy.</speak>

<speak who="LABARBARA">
My Hermes got that hellhole running 
so efficiently that all the physical 
labour is now done by a single Australian 
man.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
But how did you know we were here?</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
Dr Zoidberg brought us.</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
It was me, I'm the hero!</speak>

<info>The bi-plane flies past Zoidberg and stops next to the crew. 
The wings are a desk and behind it a small man sits.</info>

<speak who="NUMBER 1">.0
Request for explanantion of incident 
meeting?</speak>

<info>The bureaucrats gasp and duck behind their desks. Morgan gasps.</info>

<speak who="MORGAN">
Number 1.0.</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
Number 1.0, I hereby petition you for 
an emergency sort-and-file, under regulation 
2 point -</speak>

<info>Number 1.0 waggles his finger at Hermes.</info>

<speak who="NUMBER 1">.0
Don't quote me regulations. I co-chaired 
the committee that reviewed the recommendation 
to revise the colour of the book that 
regulation's in. We kept it grey.</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
Sir please, I must located the disk 
with my friend's brain on it.</speak>

<speak who="NUMBER 1">.0
Very well. But your bureaucratic licence 
will be revoked if you fail to sort 
the master in pile by closing time. 
1pm.</speak>

<info>Leela looks up at a clock. It is 12:56pm.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
That's only four minutes from now.</speak>

<info>Hermes takes off his jacket.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
Requisition me a beat.</speak>

<info>Number 1.0 turns on some music and Hermes slides down a tube 
into the in pile.</info>

<info>(singing)</info> When I was born there was a hurricane in Kingston Town

With a foot and a half of water.

Everyone was alright but I cried all night

It blew my alphabet blocks out of order.

And they said "This boy's born to be a bureaucrat,

Born to be all obsessive and snotty."

I made my friends and relations file long applications

To get into my 10th birthday party.

<info>He scoops up some red tubes, slides down a tube and drops them 
into some filing cabinets. LaBarbara pop up from one of them.</info>

<speak who="LABARBARA"><info>(SINGING)</info>
But something changed when my man turn 
pro.</speak>

<speak who="HERMES"><info>(SINGING)</info>
I was sortin' but I wasn't smilin'.</speak>

<info>He throws a tube to LaBarbara and she catches it.</info>

<speak who="LABARBARA"><info>(SINGING)</info>
He forgot that it's not about badges 
and ranks.</speak>

<speak who="HERMES"><info>(SINGING)</info>
It's supposed to be about the filing! 
People!</speak>

<info>He jumps onto Number 1.0's desk and starts juggling the tubes.</info>

We didn't choose to be bureaucrats,

No that's what almighty Jah made us!

We treat people like swine,

And make 'em stand in line,

Even if nobody paid us!

<info>He dives off the desk into the pile of red tubes.</info>

They say the world looks down on the bureaucrats,

They say we're anal, compulsive and weird.

But when push comes to shove,

You gotta do what you love,

Even if it's not a good idea! <info>He slides down the pile and throws 
the red tubes around the crew like a knife thrower.</info> Zoidberg!

<speak who="ZOIDBERG"><info>(SINGING)</info>
They said I probably shouldn't be a 
surgeon.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH"><info>(SINGING)</info>
They poo-pooed my electric frankfurter.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA"><info>(SINGING)</info>
They said I probably shouldn't fly with 
just one eye.</speak>

<info>A tube hits her in the eye.</info>

<info>Hermes inserts a message tube and Bender bends it sending the 
red tubes flying off in a different direction. Hermes rips off 
his shirt revealing a grooby Jamaican shirt underneath.</info>

<speak who="HERMES"><info>(SINGING)</info>
Everybody sing Jamaica!</speak>

<info>He limbos under the flying tubes.</info>

<speak who="EVERYBODY"><info>(SINGING)</info>
Jamaica!</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
Just the bureaucrats, Jamaica!</speak>

<speak who="BUREACRATS"><info>(SINGING)</info>
Jamaica!</speak>

<speak who="HERMES"><info>(SINGING)</info>
The grade 19s!</speak>

<info>Morgan looks around and reluctantly joins in.</info>

<speak who="MORGAN">
Jamaica.</speak>

<info>Hermes starts a conga line with the bureaucrats.</info>

<speak who="HERMES"><info>(SINGING)</info>
Sing me home!

When push comes to shove,

You gotta do what you love,

Even if it's not a good idea!

</speak><info>He picks up a red tube, takes Bender's disk out of it and throws 
it into Bender's head. Bender's personality reactivates.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
I'm Bender baby, please insert liquor!</speak>

<info>The crew cheer Hermes.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Yeah!</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
Congratulations.</speak>

<speak who="NUMBER 1">.0
Congratulations indeed but you finshed 
with one second to spare so I'm demoting 
you. A good bureaucrat never finishes 
early.</speak>

<info>He changes Hermes' badge from 36 to 38.</info>

<speak who="AMY">
That's OK Hermes. At least we have you 
back.</speak>

<speak who="MORGAN">
Not yet you don't. I'm still acting 
bureaucrat of Planet Express. And I 
have some changes to make. First, Fry, 
you're fired. Second -</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
Not so fast! When I was sortin' I came 
upon a certain document filed by one 
Morgan Proctor.  Form B: Notification 
Of Romantic Entanglement.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
That's right, she fraternized me!</speak>

<speak who="MORGAN">
That form isn't about you. It refers 
to my high school prom date. It was 
a regulation date that ended in regulation 
disappointment.</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
Yes but you only stamped it four times!</speak>

<info>He slaps the paper down on Number 1.0's desk and the bureaucrats 
gasp. Morgan is horrifed and steps away from the desk.</info>

<speak who="MORGAN">
No! No! I was young and reckless.</speak>

<info>Number 1.0 looks at the form.</info>

<speak who="NUMBER 1">.0
Bureaucrat Conrad you are technically 
correct - the best kind of correct. 
I hereby promote you to grade 37.  And 
as for you. <info>(shouting)</info> Guards!  <info>(talking)</info> 
Bring me the forms I need to fill out 
to have her taken away!</speak>

<info>He takes off in his desk and flies away.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Well, it looks like I'll be needing 
my heroic bureaucrat back. At severely 
reduced pay of course.</speak>

<info>The crew cheer.</info>

<speak who="LABARBARA">
It's better than nothing!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
What about me? Can I come back at severely 
reduced pay?</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
You got it mon! In fact, severely reduced 
pay all around!  Come on wife, let's 
blow this joint!</speak>

<info>She jumps on and they kiss and hover off somewhere.</info>

Now it's time for my song! <info>(singing)</info>
