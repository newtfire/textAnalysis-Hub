                         It was self defence Mom. Just look at 
                         the letter the Principal sent.  We were 
                         in science class and we had just finished 
                         building a minature black hole.

                         I was thinking Benderbrau if it's an 
                         ale, Botweiser if it's a lager.

               game from the late 1980's. They throw a paper to a woman, then 
               they are chased by a dog (which is then eaten by the space monster 
               from The Empire Strikes Back). Back on Earth Sal delivers more 
               papers to them. At Maple Craters they pass Bret Blob's house. 
               He throws some slime at them and it hits their hovercraft. Cubert 
               hands a paper to Dwight and he throws it through the Blobs' window. 
               Cubert and Dwight laugh. Back on Earth Sal delivers even more 
               papers. Then they are presented an award at the Paperboys Of 
               The Week ceremony. Their photo makes the front page of the Daily 
               Supernova with the headline Paperboys Win Award On Slow News 
               Day. They throw the last paper to the last house and fly back 
               to Earth.</note>
