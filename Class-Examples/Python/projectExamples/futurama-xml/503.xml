<info>7^11 Store. Fry, Bender and Leela peruse the beer fridge.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Ah beer! So many choices! And it makes 
so little difference.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
How 'bout Lï¿½brau? It has dots on it.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Overruled. The choice of champions is 
Pabst Blue Robot!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
I can't drink that! The metal shavings 
make my throat bloody.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
<info>(mocking)</info> Waah waah! Baby wants a Zima!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Hey hey! We can all fight when we're 
drunk. Now listen: Why don't we just 
brew our own beer?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
You can brew your own beer?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Sure, the kids at the orphanarium used 
to do it all the time.</speak>

<info>Bender stares for a while then his head springs off.</info>

<info>Planet Express: Lounge. Hermes, LaBarbara, Farnsworth, Cubert 
and Hermes' son Dwight are there. Dwight has dreads and wears 
a shirt made of the Jamaican flag.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
Cursed bacteria of Liberia. My own son 
suspended from boarding school.</speak>

<speak who="DWIGHT">
It's not my fault Dad.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
And you Cubert. I cloned you from one 
of my warts and I can send you straight 
back in there.</speak>

<speak who="CUBERT">
Nuh-uh!</speak>

<info>Enter Zoidberg.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
What's going on? Is this angry yelling 
or busted hearing aid yelling?</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
I'm afraid it's both.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
<info>(shouting)</info> What?</speak>

<speak who="LABARBARA">
Now hold on, everyone cool your daiquiris! 
Let's give the little vermin a chance 
to explain themselves.</speak>

<speak who="DWIGHT">
It was self defence Mom. Just look at 
the letter the Principal sent.  We were 
in science class and we had just finished 
building a minature black hole.</speak>

<speak who="CUBERT"><info>ON TV</info>
That was easy.</speak>

<info>Bret Blob, a horrible gelatinous blob, scoffs.</info>

<speak who="BRET"><info>ON TV</info>
Pretty scrawny black hole. It must be 
hungry.</speak>

<speak who="CUBERT"><info>ON TV</info>
Duh! Black holes don't need food.</speak>

<speak who="BRET"><info>ON TV</info>
Neither do nerds!</speak>

<info>He picks up Cubert and Dwight's lunch boxes and throws them 
in the black hole. The black hole disappears.</info>

<info>Bret laughs.</info>

<speak who="CUBERT"><info>ON TV</info>
That's it Bret. You've compressed our 
lunches to a singularity for the last 
time! Salt him Dwight!</speak>

<info>He and Dwight pick up some jars of salt and shake it over Bret. 
He dissolves into a green puddle.</info>

<speak who="BRET"><info>ON TV</info>
When I resolidify, I'm gonna put you 
in a world of goop!</speak>

<info>Cubert and Dwight scream.</info>

<speak who="CUBERT">
See? That bully started it. We couldn't 
fight back with brawn so we used our 
brains!</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
I've warned you not to use those things!</speak>

<info>Planet Express: Kitchen. Fry, Bender and Leela are starting 
their beer.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Let's see. We've got our malt, our hops...we 
just need a big disposable tub to mix 
it in.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Yo!</speak>

<info>He leans back so his chest cabinet is horizontal. Fry and Leela 
pour in the ingredients.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Now it needs to boil for a couple hours.</speak>

<info>Bender hops onto the gas hob and turns it on. He whistles. Enter 
Farnsworth, Hermes, Dwight and Cubert. Dwight is playing a computer 
game.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
Dwight, you remember the crew?</speak>

<speak who="DWIGHT">
<info>(unenthusiastically)</info> Eh...</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Crew, you remember Cubert?  Wonderful! 
And I'm sure you won't mind being their 
legal guardians for a month!</speak>

<info>He and Hermes run out.</info>

<speak who="CUBERT">
Well, well.  If it isn't my old friend 
stretchpants......no pants and...He 
looks at Fry.]...idiot!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
We're making beer! I'm the brewery.</speak>

<speak who="DWIGHT">
I heard alcohol makes you stupid.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
No I'm...doesn't.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Actually Dwight you're right. Alcohol 
is very very bad...for children. But 
once you turn 21 it becomes very very 
good! So scram!</speak>

<info>Dwight and Cubert walk out the room muttering.</info>

<speak who="DWIGHT">
Aw man!</speak>

<speak who="CUBERT">
Stupid...</speak>

<info>Cut to: Planet Express: Farnsworth's Lab. Farnsworth is fiddling 
with a machine.</info>

<speak who="CUBERT">
Hey Dad! What useless contraption are 
you half-baking today?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Eh wha? Oh! This is my latest invention. 
A device that lets anyone sound exactly 
like me!</speak>

<info>Cubert tries it out.</info>

<speak who="CUBERT">
<info>(Farnsworth's voice)</info> Good news everyone! 
I'm a horse's butt!</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
I am? That's not good news at all you 
little...</speak>

<info>He shakes his fist and Cubert screams in Farnsworth's voice 
and runs away. Dwight looks at the machine.</info>

<speak who="DWIGHT">
What's this device's marketability? 
Who's the target consumer?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
There is no target consumer! Only targets. 
Targets that will tremble as their new 
master hands down edicts in my glorious 
booming voice!  Now quit pestering me 
you scoundrels!</speak>

<info>Hermes' Office. He is stamping and singing.</info>

Hermes; <info>(singing)</info> Stamp it...file it...oh yeah! Send it overnight!

<info>Enter Cubert and Dwight. Dwight sees a pile of papers.</info>

<speak who="DWIGHT">
Can I collate that?</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
No!</speak>

<speak who="CUBERT">
Can I shread these contracts?</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
No!</speak>

<info>Cubert shreads them anyway. Dwight picks something up.</info>

<speak who="DWIGHT">
Wow! A powerstamper!</speak>

<info>He turns it on. It stamps objects around the room, including 
Hermes' head.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
Now look at all the work I gotta do! 
Ow!</speak>

<info>Cut to: Planet Express: Corridor. Dwight and Cubert run out 
of Hermes' office laughing.</info>

<info>Planet Express: Kitchen. Bender belches foam. Leela tastes it.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Mmm. The ingredients are cooked. And 
they've picked up some of your natural 
robot flavourings. Time to add the yeast.</speak>

<info>Fry takes Bender's antenna off and Leela puts a funnel in then 
tips the yeast in.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Yeast? You mean I'll have a lifeform 
growing inside me? <info>(crying)</info> It's so 
beautiful.</speak>

<info>He blows his nose. Leela wrist thing rings. She presses a button.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Talk to me.</speak>

<info>Cut to: Planet Express: Attic Balcony. Dwight and Cubert are 
sat with the machine that mimics Farnsworth's voice. It is Cubert 
who is talking to Leela.</info>

<speak who="CUBERT">
<info>(Farnsworth's voice)</info> Sorry I can't come 
down to say goodbye, but I'm busy inventing 
useless junk.</speak>

<info>He passes the machine to Dwight.</info>

<speak who="DWIGHT">
<info>(Farnsworth's voice)</info> And I smell bad.</speak>

<info>They laugh.</info>

<info>Outside Planet Express. The ship takes off.</info>

<info>Time Lapse. A week later the ship lands.</info>

<info>Cut to: Planet Express: Hangar. The crew emerge from the ship. 
Farnsworth and Hermes stand at the bottom of the steps with Cubert 
and Dwight. Cubert is playing on Dwight's game. Leela takes it 
from him, squeezes it and breaks it.</info>

<speak who="CUBERT">
Hey!</speak>

<info>She grabs both of them by their shirts.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
If you were my kids you'd get quite 
a talking to...from your father......when 
he got home from the senate.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Oh bother, what have they done now?</speak>

<info>Bender rolls his sleeves up.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Those pork dumplings sent us on a fake 
delivery.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
The address was on Dogdoo 8 but the 
universe ends right after Dogdoo 7!</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
Child man, is this true?</speak>

<speak who="DWIGHT">
Yeah, but why are you mad at us? Your 
dummy brigade wasted a week on an obviously 
fake mission!</speak>

<info>Cubert points at Bender.</info>

<speak who="CUBERT">
Plus, you're making bootleg beer inside 
company property!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
<info>(shouting)</info> Lies! Lies and slander!</speak>

<info>He belches foam.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Accusing gentle Bender of a misdeed? 
That's the last straw! You boys have 
been underfoot long enough!</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
You jerked the words right outta my 
mouth. We're their fathers and its high 
time we acted like it.</speak>

<info>Bender rubs his hands together with glee.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Ooo-hoo! Here comes violence!</speak>

<info>Hermes clears his throat.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
Get a job you lazy kids!</speak>

<info>Dwight and Cubert gasp in horror. Bender is disappointed.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
I guess if you want children beaten......you 
have to do it yourself.</speak>

<info>Outside Planet Express. Dwight and Cubert have set up something 
and put a white sheet over it. They lead Farnsworth and Hermes 
to some chairs.</info>

<speak who="CUBERT">
Come on Dad, shuffle faster!</speak>

<speak who="DWIGHT">
You don't wanna miss the unveiling of 
our new company do you?</speak>

<info>Hermes and Farnsworth sit down.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
Company?  <info>(mocking)</info> How cute! What will 
you be pedalling? Lemonade? Shoe shines? 
Cootie insurance?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
<info>(mocking)</info> Perhaps they've constructed 
a teddybear hospital!</speak>

<info>They laugh.</info>

<speak who="CUBERT">
Actually, we're starting a competing 
delivery company.</speak>

<info>He pulls the sheet off to reveal a logo that says Awesome Express. 
Hermes and Farnsworth look at each other and stand up.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
Welcome to the world of business!</speak>

<info>He and Farnsworth start kicking the logo.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Who's going to use a delivery service 
with a kicked sign? Nobody that's who!</speak>

<speak who="DWIGHT">
But we already have a client signed 
up! We're delivering the Daily Supernova.</speak>

<info>He holds up the newspaper. On it is a headline: Space Monster 
To City: Grrrrr!. Beside it is a picture of a Godzilla-like creature. 
Hermes chuckles.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
So your delivery company is just a cute 
harmless paper route?</speak>

<info>Farnsworth wipes his brow.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Phew!</speak>

<speak who="DWIGHT">
No. Its a serious business.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
<info>(mocking)</info> Yes its a tremendous responsibility 
alright!  What if a paper were to land 
in a puddle?</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
<info>(mocking)</info> Civilisation as we know it 
might get splashed!</speak>

<info>He and Farnsworth laugh and ruffle their sons' hair.</info>

<info>Planet Express: Balcony. Cubert and Dwight have set up a new 
sign.</info>

<speak who="DWIGHT">
Why do they always treat us like dumb 
kids? We're practically old enough to 
find the Fox Network infantile!</speak>

<speak who="CUBERT">
Ah we'll show 'em. All Awesome Express 
needs is a sturdy interstellar delivery 
craft!  Voila! You got a quarter?</speak>

<info>Dwight pulls out a coin. Cubert rips out the ad and puts it 
in an envelope with the quarter and puts the envelope in the 
mailbox. It flies off down a message tube.</info>

<speak who="DWIGHT">
Man, that ad said to allow four to six 
seconds for delivery.</speak>

<info>Cubert snorts.</info>

<speak who="CUBERT">
More like seven!</speak>

<info>A mail tube shoots out of the box and knocks Cubert off his 
feet.</info>

<info>Planet Express: Lounge. Bender is sat on the couch. His casing 
is a little bigger than usual and he looks pregnant. Enter Fry 
and Leela.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
I'm really starting to swell up with 
beer. I must look ridiculous.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
No, you have a healthy glow.</speak>

<info>Bender belches.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Oh my God! I just felt it ferment!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Ooo! Let me feel.  Have you thought 
about what to name it?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
I was thinking Benderbrau if it's an 
ale, Botweiser if it's a lager.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
I hope it's a lager so I can take it 
to a ball game.  Ooo! I felt that one!</speak>

<info>Outside Planet Express. At the back of the building Dwight and 
Cubert finish putting together their hovercraft. They are wearing 
spacesuits.</info>

<speak who="CUBERT">
Uh, there's a crack in the hull here. 
That could cause explosive decompression.</speak>

<speak who="DWIGHT">
Put a sticker on it.</speak>

<info>He hands Cubert a sticker for Mom's Moron Oil For Dumb Robots. 
Farnsworth and Hermes walk around the corner.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
Off on your first delivery eh? You be 
careful my little tinkler.  Remember 
we used to call you that huh? Tinkler?</speak>

<info>A Daily Supernova van pulls up. Sal throws out a bundle of papers.</info>

<speak who="SAL">
Gets movin'! Those newspapers won'ts 
deliver themselveses! Only the Sunday 
edition can dos that.</speak>

<info>He drives off.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Goodness there must be 50 papers in 
that bundle! That's a big number, 50.</speak>

<speak who="CUBERT">
Yeah if you're an idiot!</speak>

<info>He and Dwight climb into the hovercraft. Dwight counts down.</info>

<speak who="DWIGHT">
3. 2. 1.</speak>

<speak who="CUBERT">
All systems go.</speak>

<speak who="DWIGHT">
Blast off!</speak>

<info>The hovercraft blasts off. It is pedal powered. Dwight and Cubert 
pedal and it flies up into the sky.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
<info>(shouting)</info> See you at din-din!</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
<info>(shouting)</info> I'm blowing you a kiss.</speak>

<info>He blows it. Cubert "sees" it coming towards him and screams.</info>

<speak who="CUBERT">
Take evasive action!</speak>

<info>He and Dwight pedal around to avoid the kiss.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
<info>(shouting)</info> It's closing in! You can't 
avoid it! It's a cheek-seeker. And...gotcha!</speak>

<info>Cubert screams and spits.</info>

<info>Montage Dwight and Cubert fly their hovercraft through a posh 
estate called Maple Craters in a sequence lifted from the Paperboy 
game from the late 1980's. They throw a paper to a woman, then 
they are chased by a dog (which is then eaten by the space monster 
from The Empire Strikes Back). Back on Earth Sal delivers more 
papers to them. At Maple Craters they pass Bret Blob's house. 
He throws some slime at them and it hits their hovercraft. Cubert 
hands a paper to Dwight and he throws it through the Blobs' window. 
Cubert and Dwight laugh. Back on Earth Sal delivers even more 
papers. Then they are presented an award at the Paperboys Of 
The Week ceremony. Their photo makes the front page of the Daily 
Supernova with the headline Paperboys Win Award On Slow News 
Day. They throw the last paper to the last house and fly back 
to Earth.</info>

<info>Planet Express: Meeting Room. The crew are sat at the table. 
Bender is knitting a beer bottle cover.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
Business is down. So I filed papers 
to have you all reclassified as slaves.</speak>

<info>Enter Dwight and Cubert with a wheelbarrow with a big lump in 
it covered by a sheet.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Well, well, well. If it isn't our little 
muchkin moguls!</speak>

<info>He tickles them.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
What's the trouble men? Need some penny 
rolls for your profits?</speak>

<speak who="CUBERT">
Actually, thank's to Dwight's brilliant 
accounting and my unaccountable brilliance......our 
paper route now has over a million customers!</speak>

<info>He pulls the sheet off the wheelbarrow, revealing the lump to 
be a huge pile of money. Hermes and Farnsworth stand gawping 
at it, dumbstruck.</info>

<speak who="DWIGHT">
We're finally making more money than 
you guys! Aren't you impressed now Pops? 
Aren'tcha? Aren'tcha?</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
Uh, in a small way yes. But you still 
don't have your own building, your own 
conference table or...or one of those 
things!</speak>

<info>He points at Zoidberg.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Hello!</speak>

<info>He waves.</info>

<info>Planet Express: Balcony. Dwight and Cubert lean against the 
wall with their wheelbarrow.</info>

<speak who="DWIGHT">
Our Dads are never impressed, no matter 
what we do.</speak>

<speak who="CUBERT">
Maybe we should start a fire.</speak>

<speak who="DWIGHT">
If we really want to impress them we'll 
have to crush them with strategy...Dwight 
Lightning!</speak>

<info>He pulls out a pad with "Dwight Lightning" written on the front.</info>

<speak who="CUBERT">
Very well. But I get to name the next 
strategy.</speak>

<info>Planet Express: Lounge. Leela, Fry and Bender are sat watching 
a TV programme.</info>

<speak who="ANNOUNCER"><info>ON TV</info>
This week on The Real World: The Sun.</speak>

<speak who="MAN"><info>ON TV</info>
Argh! I'm burning to death!</speak>

<info>Leela scoffs.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
You know how much an apartment that 
big would cost on the Sun?</speak>

<info>Fry turns the TV off. Enter Farnsworth and Hermes.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
People, as you know our young sons have 
become great successes in the very same 
field as us.</speak>

<speak who="FRY"><info>SIMULTANEOUSLY</info>
That's great!</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
Naturally, we're humiliated.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
That's why we need you, our loyal crew, 
to make Planet Express 800% more profitable.</speak>

<info>Hermes sets up a chart.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
We'll start by slashing salaries. And 
this time I mean really slash.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Uh guys, I don't know how to tell you 
this. So I'll just let Fry blurt it 
out thoughtlessly.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
We don't work for you anymore!</speak>

<info>Hermes gasps.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
What?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Dwight and Cubert made us a better offer. 
We're paperboys now.</speak>

<info>Enter Cubert and Dwight.</info>

<speak who="CUBERT">
Incoming! We got papers to stuff team! 
Hup two hup two!</speak>

<info>The Awesome Express team get up.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Yes sir!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
On our way!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
We're on it Mr Farnsworth!</speak>

<info>Planet Express: Meeting Room. Farnsworth and Hermes address 
the crew.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Folks, the situation is grim but we 
shall prevail, thanks to you, our crack 
team of loyal dregs!</speak>

<info>Scruffy sits with his feet on the table, Amy puts make up on 
and Zoidberg sits, listening. Hermes looks at Scruffy.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
I don't even know who this guy is!</speak>

<speak who="SCRUFFY">
I'm Scruffy, the janitor.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Yes, of course you are. Now we've got 
to buckle down and save Planet Express.</speak>

<speak who="SCRUFFY">
I'm on break.</speak>

<info>He picks up a bag of Potato Chips and slowly munches them.</info>

<info>Enter the Awesome Express crew.</info>

<speak who="CUBERT">
Sorry to interrupt this "whirlwind of 
activity" but we have an announcement.</speak>

<info>Dwight walks over to Hermes.</info>

<speak who="DWIGHT">
I direct your attention to these forms, 
which I'm presently engaged in handing 
to you.</speak>

<info>Hermes takes the forms and reads them.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
Sweet guineapig of Winnipeg! They've 
taken over our company!</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Balderdash! I never agreed to that!</speak>

<speak who="DWIGHT">
No. But you did declare yourself dead 
three years ago as a tax dodge.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Tax dodge nothing! You take one nap 
in a ditch in the park and they start 
declaring you this and that.</speak>

<speak who="CUBERT">
Either way I technically inherit your 
building and your spaceship. Which mean 
Planet Express is now......Awesome Express!</speak>

<info>Hermes and Farnsworth gasp.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
<info>(angry)</info> You rotten kids! <info>(nicely)</info> Will 
you be hiring?</speak>

<speak who="DWIGHT">
No.</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
<info>(angry)</info> You rotten kids!</speak>

<info>Awesome Express: Hangar. Leela sprays the ship red. Bender and 
Fry finish loading the papers onto the cargo bay lift.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
There. One million papers. Folded and 
loaded!</speak>

<info>Cubert jet packs up to Leela with something in his hands.</info>

<speak who="CUBERT">
Hey Leela, help me apply these flame 
decals I got in my cereal. They'll make 
the ship go faster.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
And what's your scientific basis for 
thinking that?</speak>

<speak who="CUBERT">
I'm 12.</speak>

<info>Cut to: Outside Awesome Express. Hermes and Farnsworth walk 
across the street, carrying boxes of their stuff. The ship blasts 
off and they watch. Farnsworth sighs.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Did I ever tell you how I used to own 
that ship?</speak>

<info>They walk away.</info>

<info>Cut to: Street. They walk past a dumpster. Zoidberg pops out 
of it and watches Farnsworth and Hermes walk by sadly.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
There but for the grace of God.</speak>

<info>He dives back in and gobbles up some scraps.</info>

<info>Awesome Express: Lounge. Fry and Bender are sat on the couch 
watching All My Circuits. Bender sings to his bump to the tune 
of Hush Little Baby.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
<info>(singing)</info> Hush little brewsky don't 
you leak. Daddy wants to drink for at 
least a week.  Oh my God! I think it's 
time!</speak>

<info>Leela runs in.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Hurry Leela, get some coasters and cold 
mugs.</speak>

<info>Awesome Express: Meeting Room. Bender lies on the table with 
his head on Leela's lap. Fry puts the beer in bottles. Bender 
cries in pain.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Push Bender push!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
You're doing great!</speak>

<info>Bender cries again.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
It feels like I'm trying to push a water 
bed out of me.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Almost there. Just two more bottles.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Is it OK? I can't hear anything.</speak>

<info>The last of the beer drains from Bender. Fry holds a bottle 
up.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
It's an ale! 5 gallons, 6 ounces!</speak>

<info>He slaps a Benderbrau label on the bottle then hands the crate 
of beer to Bender who hugs it.</info>

<info>Enter Dwight and Cubert.</info>

<speak who="DWIGHT">
Hey, what's goin' on? This is a delivery 
company not a delivery room!</speak>

<speak who="CUBERT">
We just busted our bums delivering a 
million newspapers and this is how you 
greet us? With a bunch of frosty cold 
beers?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Hey wait a second. How did you deliver 
a million papers in one hour?</speak>

<speak who="CUBERT">
Uh...we just did OK? 'Cause we're awesome! 
Yeah!</speak>

<speak who="DWIGHT">
Yeah awesome!</speak>

<info>The phone rings. Leela answers.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Hello, Awesome Express, the rude, crude 
delivery dudes! How may I direct your 
call?...What's that?...You haven't gotten 
your paper?...In how long?...</speak>

<info>Five more phones ring. Dwight and Cubert act nervously.</info>

<info>The Conrads' Dining Room. LaBarbara, Hermes and Farnsworth sit 
at the table eating. Farnsworth holds up his empty plate.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Uh, might a homeless old man have a 
touch more beef bourguignon? And another 
tequila slammer?  Please?</speak>

<speak who="LABARBARA">
Don't you sweet talk me you wrinkly 
old tube sack!</speak>

<info>Hermes holds up his glass.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
Might I have one too wife?</speak>

<speak who="LABARBARA">
Ah you're both pathetic, being jealous 
of your own offspring. Now you should 
be happy they became successes, instead 
of following in your footstamps.</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
Oh it's true. But they grow up so fast. 
We just wanted a few more years of being 
better than them.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
They're so stinking talented they don't 
even need their fathers anymore.</speak>

<info>He and Hermes hug and cry. Cubert and Dwight run in and run 
into their father's arms.</info>

<speak who="CUBERT">
Dad! We screwed up!</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
You did? Tough luck suckers!</speak>

<speak who="DWIGHT">
Please, help us Pops. We agreed to deliver 
way more papers than we can handle.</speak>

<speak who="CUBERT">
<info>(crying)</info> But we couldn't handle them 
so we started dumping the extras in 
a crater on the Moon.</speak>

<info>He cries more.</info>

<speak who="DWIGHT">
<info>(crying)</info> And now everyone's yelling 
at us about our missing papers!</speak>

<speak who="CUBERT">
<info>(crying)</info> And now we don't know what 
to do!</speak>

<info>Hermes and Farnsworth laugh very loudly then sigh. They put 
their sons on their laps.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Why did you boys do all this?</speak>

<speak who="DWIGHT">
<info>(crying)</info> We just wanted you to be proud 
of us.</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
Proud of you? You ruined us with sleazy 
business practices and a complete disregard 
for human decency. But, of course we're 
proud of you.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Damn right we are! Now come on. Let's 
go do a little Father/Son weaseling 
out of this.</speak>

<info>The newly repainted Planet Express ship flys away from Earth 
and hovers over the crater on the Moon.</info>

<info>The cargo bay hatch opens and a net comes out and wraps around 
the papers. It hoists them out of the craters and the ship flies 
off. As they approach Maple Craters the port torpedo door opens 
and a gun pops out.</info>

<info>Ship's Torpedo Room. Hermes is sat behind the gun with the papers 
scattered around the room.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
OK boys, let me show you how a paper 
man does it.</speak>

<info>He grabs the gun and shoots the papers to the houses.</info>

<info>Cut to: Maple Craters. Some papers hit the doors, some hit cars 
and one hits the little prince from the novel of the same name. 
He tumbles away into the void of space.</info>

<speak who="BOY">
Au revoir!!</speak>

<info>Cut to: Ship's Torpedo Room.</info>

<speak who="DWIGHT">
Can I use the gun Dad?</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
Aw what kind of father would I be if 
I said no?</speak>

<info>He lifts Dwight into the chair.</info>

<info>Cut to: Maple Craters. Dwight fires the papers to their houses.</info>

<info>Cut to: Ship's Torpedo Room.</info>

<speak who="DWIGHT">
Only one house to go. We did it!</speak>

<info>He, Cubert, Hermes and Farnsworth cheer. The screen beeps and 
displays the Blob house. Inside Bret Blob lifts weights.</info>

<speak who="DWIGHT">
Run away! That bully Bret Blob lives 
there!</speak>

<speak who="CUBERT">
He's ugly, mean, stupid, stink, mucus! 
And last week...we sort of...broke his 
window.</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
Alright, alright. What do we do when 
we break somebody's window?</speak>

<speak who="DWIGHT">
<info>(sheepish)</info> Pay for it?</speak>

<info>Hermes laughs.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
Heavens no! We apologise! With nice 
cheap words!</speak>

<info>Outside Blob House. Hermes rings the doorbell. Bret answers.</info>

<speak who="BRET">
I thought I heard the doorbell but I 
see it was the dorkbell!</speak>

<info>He laughs. Cubert and Dwight laugh nervously.</info>

<speak who="DWIGHT">
Man, we had it coming Bret!</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Now now, no need to give us the business. 
We'd like a word with you daddy.</speak>

<speak who="BRET">
Whatever. <info>(shouting)</info> Daaad!</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
Don't worry boys. I'm sure his father 
is a perfectly normal reasonable man.</speak>

<info>Horrible Gelatinous Blob comes out of the door with his tentacles 
waving.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Mr Blob, our sons have come to apologise 
for damaging your window. They've learned 
their lesson and they want to make amends.</speak>

<speak who="CUBERT">
<info>(ashamed)</info> Sorry sir.</speak>

<speak who="DWIGHT">
<info>(ashamed)</info> Yeah, sorry.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Now see here. We assured our sons that 
you'd accept their apology.</speak>

<info>He laughs. Farnsoworth and Hermes move their sons aside.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
No one gives my son that option!</speak>

<info>He and Hermes roll up their sleeves.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
Bring it on Jello-pop!</speak>

<speak who="CUBERT">
Yeah go Dad!</speak>

<speak who="DWIGHT">
Show 'em who's boss!  Get 'em...Pops!</speak>

<info>Horrible Gelatinous Blob eats Hermes and Farnsworth.</info>

<info>Taco Bellevue Hospital. Farnsworth and Hermes are in a room 
in body casts and traction.</info>

<speak who="CUBERT">
That was incredible! You are the bravest 
dads in the entire trauma centre!</speak>

<speak who="DWIGHT">
You guys almost had him...until he digested 
you.</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
Aww, you're good kids.  If I could feel 
anything right now, it would be pride. 
I was wrong! I can still feel pain!</speak>

<info>A knock at the door. Enter the Blobs. Horrible Gelatinous Blob 
pushes Bret in. Horrible Gelatinous Blob is carrying flowers. 
Hermes screams.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
He's coming to finish the job. Someone 
toss me out the window!</speak>

<info>Hermes and Farnsworth mull it over.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
I suppose.</speak>

<info>Enter Bender with a crate of Benderbrau.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Hey chumps! I heard you were on the 
ass end of an ass kicking so I figured 
you could use a couple of these babys!</speak>

<info>He hands Farnsworth and Hermes a bottle each.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
Oh why not! Might as well live it up 
as long as I 've got this catheter in 
me!</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Uh, won't join us Mr Blob?</speak>

<info>Bender hands him a bottle.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
This is what makes life worth clinging 
to. Three fathers, enjoying a day out 
with their sons.</speak>

<info>Hermes, Farnsworth, Bender and Horrible Gelatinous Blob clink 
their bottles.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
It would seem we've taught our boys 
a lesson about life: Man or Blob, it's 
whats inside that counts.</speak>

<info>They drink their beer. Cubert and Dwight struggle and whimper. 
Bret has eaten them.</info>

<info>THE END</info></xml>
