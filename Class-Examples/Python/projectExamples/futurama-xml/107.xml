<info>Outside Robot Wash. Bender inserts a coin and chooses his wash 
program from regular, deluxe and sub-standard. He selects deluxe 
and steps onto a conveyor belt. It moves forward and Rose Royce's 
Car Wash plays. Bender pushes down his antenna and sings his 
own words.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
<info>(singing)</info> Going through the 'bot wash!</speak>

<info>Cut to: Robot Wash.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
<info>(singing)</info> Goin' through the robot wash!

C'mon, y'all and sing it with me

'Bot wash! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

'Bot wash, yeah!

</speak><info>A huge drying machine dries him. He sees an undercoating machine 
and puts a quarter in. The machine clamps around his legs and 
he is in ecstasy as the machine does the undercoating.</info>

<info>Cut to: Outside Robot Wash. He comes out the other side of the 
Robot Wash and it hangs a pine tree air freshener around his 
neck. He turns round and admires his shiny metal ass.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Ah!  Aww!</speak>

<info>Planet Express: Lounge. Bender sits down to watch Essence of 
Elzar, a cooking show presented by Neptunian chef Elzar and a 
not-so-subtle parody of Essence Of Emeril. Elzar has black hair, 
and the usual four arms a Neptunian has.</info>

<speak who="ELZAR">
Hey, I'm Elzar! Welcome to the show! 
You know, you don't have to drive all 
the way to Neptune for great Neptunian 
food. Today we're gonna kick it up a 
notch as I show you how to fricassee 
a mouth-watering Neptunian slug.  Now 
while you grease the pan and preheat 
your oven to 3500 degrees you're gonna 
separate the yolk from your genetically-enhanced 
eggplant and then give the whole thing 
a good blast from your spice weasel 
- bam!</speak>

<info>Enter Fry and Leela. Leela is wearing a green top instead of 
her usual white one.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Hey, what you watching?</speak>

<info>Bender quickly turns off the TV.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Uh, nothing!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Is that a cooking show?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
No, of course not! It was...uh...porno! 
Yeah that's it!</speak>

<info>Leela turns the TV back on and sees the programme.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Bender! I didn't know you liked cooking! 
That's so cute!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
<info>(ashamed)</info> Oh, it's true! I've been hiding 
it for so long.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Its OK, Bender, I like cooking too.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER"><info>(WHISPERING)</info>
Pansy!</speak>

<speak who="ELZAR">
Of course, your most important ingredient 
is this baby right here: the Neptunian 
slug. You can get it in a can but to 
really do things right you gotta strangle 
yourself a fresh one.  Now this is why 
you gotta use cast-iron cookware.</speak>

<info>He starts hitting the slug between it's eye stalks with a frying 
pan. Bender watches and is spooked when the slug does something 
to Elzar.</info>

<info>Planet Express: Hermes' Office. Outside the office a sign flashes 
indicating there is a chewing out happening inside.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
Bender, man. It has come to my attention 
that this company has been paying you 
to do nothing but loaf about on the 
couch.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
You call that a couch? I demand a pillow!</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
I'm sorry but if you want to continue 
drawing a salary you gotta do more than 
watch the cooking shows all day.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Hmm.</speak>

<info>He rubs his chin.</info>

<info>Planet Express: Lounge. Leela and Fry are sat at the table while 
Bender stands next to it wearing a chef's hat and an apron.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
You're gonna be the ship's cook?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Yeah! We're gonna kick it up a notch. 
Bam!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
I know you like cooking shows but you're 
a robot, you don't even have a sense 
of taste.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Honey, I wouldn't talk about taste if 
I was wearing a lime green tank top.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Bam!</speak>

<info>Little Neptune Street. Fry, Leela and Bender walk through an 
area of New New York City where bums and lowlifes hang around.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
So this is Little Neptune?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Yep. Every chef knows that this is the 
place to get exotic gourmet ingredients.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Among other things.</speak>

<info>In an alleyway a crack addict stands in front of what looks 
like a normal vending machine but is actually a crack dispenser. 
He inserts a coin and the machine starts twisting a tube of crack 
out but it jams. The crack addict starts clawing the glass.</info>

<speak who="CRACK ADDICT">
Come on, man, don't hold out on me like 
this!</speak>

<info>Fry walks past a man who wears a long coat.</info>

<speak who="ORGAN DEALER">
Psst! You want to buy organ?  Fresh 
and cheap. Ready for transplant!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Ooh! What's this?</speak>

<speak who="ORGAN DEALER">
Ah! Is X-Ray eyes. See through anything!</speak>

<info>Fry reads the label.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Wait a minute! This says Z-Ray.</speak>

<speak who="ORGAN DEALER">
Z is just as good. In fact, is better. 
Is two more than X.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Hmm, I can see where that would be an 
advantage. Do you take cash?</speak>

<info>He takes out his wallet but Leela quickly pulls him away and 
they carry on walking.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Fry, you have to be more careful. We're 
not in the 20th century. You don't know 
how things work here.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
I'm not a little kid, Leela. I grew 
up in this city. These are my people. 
What up?</speak>

<speak who="ALIEN">
Word!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
See?</speak>

<info>Little Neptune Market. The trio look around at what is on offer.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Wow! You guys sell every kind of meat 
here except human!</speak>

<info>In an aisle Leela picks up a jar.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
What's this spice for?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Oh! That's ridiculous. <info>(whispering)</info> 
I'll take two pounds!</speak>

<info>At the meat counter Bender looks at tubbed slug and I Can't 
Believe It's Not Slug. He looks up at the salesman.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Hey, buddy. I'm looking for fresh slug.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Whatever.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Yeah, yeah, either one's fine.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Hey, have you seen Fry?</speak>

<info>Cut to: Little Neptune Street. Fry is back with the organ dealer 
in the alley.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Now that you mention it, I do have trouble 
breathing underwater sometimes. I'll 
take the gills.</speak>

<speak who="ORGAN DEALER">
Yes, gills. Then, uh, you don't need 
lungs anymore, is right?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Can't imagine why I would.</speak>

<speak who="ORGAN DEALER">
Lie down on table. I take lungs now, 
gills come next week.  <info>(shouting)</info> Nurse!</speak>

<info>A huge man comes over and holds down Fry's arms.</info>

<speak who="NURSE">
Let's do it.</speak>

<speak who="ORGAN DEALER">
You may feel small pain --</speak>

<info>Leela punches him in the face and he falls over. Then she kicks 
the nurse to the floor. The organ dealer runs away down the alley 
and throws his scalpel back at Leela. She dives out of the way 
and it flies into Bender's chest cabinet. He closes the door.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
<info>(shouting)</info> Thank you!</speak>

<info>Planet Express: Lounge. Fry sits at the table while Leela scolds 
him.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
What the hell were you doing? I warned 
you to stay away from those guys.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
I'm capable of making my own decisions, 
Leela. Did you ever stop to think I 
might be happier with gills?</speak>

<info>Enter Farnsworth.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Good news, everyone...</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Uh-oh, I don't like the sound of that.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
...you'll be making a delivery to the 
planet Trisol...</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Here it comes.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
...A mysterious world in the darkest 
depths of the Forbidden Zone.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Thank you, and goodnight.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Uh, Professor, are we even allowed in 
the Forbidden Zone?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Why, of course! Its just a name! Like 
the Death Zone or the Zone Of No Return. 
All the zones have names like that in 
the Galaxy Of Terror!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Uh, Professor...</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Off you go, pleasant trip.</speak>

<info>Ships Cockpit. Zoidberg and Amy join the crew on the mission. 
Bender is not with them. Fry leans back in his chair and shouts 
down a hole in the floor.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
<info>(shouting)</info> Hey Bender how's dinner coming?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Almost ready!</speak>

<info>Cut to: Ships Galley. Bender is wearing his chef's hat and a 
new apron which says To Serve Man. He takes the Neptunian slug 
out of a pot of boiling water, puts it on a plate and puts an 
apple in its mouth.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Now for a dash of salt!  Uh-oh!</speak>

<info>Ships Mess. The crew are all ready to eat. Bender carves the 
tiny, deflated slug. Leela leans in to the rest of the crew.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
<info>(whispering)</info> Listen, this is Bender's 
first meal and he's a little sensitive. 
So let's be supportive, OK?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Yeah, OK.</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Alright.</speak>

<info>They start eating.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
<info>(shouting)</info> Oh, dear God!</speak>

<info>She spits the slug out and so does everyone else.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
That's the saltiest thing I've ever 
tasted. And I once a big heaping bowl 
of salt!</speak>

<info>Everyone guzzles down a glass of water and once again they spit 
it out.</info>

<speak who="AMY">
Bender, is this salt water?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
It's salt with water in it if that's 
what you mean.</speak>

<info>Fry waves his hand in front of his eyes.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
My vision's fading. I think I'm gonna 
die.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
There was nothing wrong with that food. 
The salt level was 10% less than a lethal 
dose.</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Uh-oh, I shouldn't have had seconds.</speak>

<info>The ship speeds towards the Planet Trisol.</info>

<info>Trisol Surface. The ship lands on a landing pad in a desert.</info>

<info>Cut to: Ships Cockpit.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
OK, Fry, here's the package to deliver 
and for once in your life be careful. 
This is my first visit to the Galaxy 
Of Terror and I'd like it to be a pleasant 
one.</speak>

<info>She slaps Fry who is mimicking her with his hand.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Ow!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Don't touch anything or talk to anyone. 
Just go to the palace, drop it off and 
come right back.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Jeez, will you lay off! I was delivering 
things before you were born! I think 
I know what I'm doing.</speak>

<info>He walks off without the package and quickly returns for it.</info>

<info>Trisol Surface. Fry is walking across the desert in the sweltering 
heat.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Stupid slug. I've never been so thirsty. 
Oh, come on! Go down already!  Ah!</speak>

<info>On the other side of him two other much larger suns rise over 
the horizon.</info>

<info>Time Lapse. Fry nears the Trisol Palace, climbs the huge staircase 
and enters the palace.</info>

<info>Cut to: Trisol Palace Throne Room. It is deserted.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Hello? Anybody home?</speak>

<info>He reads the package address. It is addressed to the Emperor. 
He decides to leave it on the throne. He sees a bottle of water 
beside the throne, looks around, then drinks the entire contents. 
Two pools of water close in on him and form into humanoid shapes. 
Guards.</info>

<speak who="GUARD #1">
The royal bottle is empty!</speak>

<info>The second guard gasps.</info>

<speak who="GUARD #2">
You drank our Emperor!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
No! It wasn't me!</speak>

<info>He burps a small bubble of the Emperor. He pops it and laughs 
nervously.</info>

<info>Time Lapse. More guards have come in.</info>

<speak who="GUARD #1">
You drank our Emperor! You assassinated 
him.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
I didn't mean to. He just looked so 
cool and refreshing.</speak>

<speak who="GUARD #3">
I'm sure he was.</speak>

<speak who="GUARD #1">
But now he's gone and your fate is sealed. 
All hail the new Emperor.</speak>

<info>The guards bow to Fry.</info>

<speak who="GUARDS">
<info>(chanting)</info> Hail! Hail! Hail!</speak>

<info>Time Lapse. Fry is sat on the Emperor's throne with two Trisolian 
women at his side fanning him. The rest of the Planet Express 
crew have arrived.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
So after I specifically asked you not 
to touch anything, you drank a bottle 
of strange blue liquid? It could have 
been poisonous acid!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
It could have been. But chances were 
equally good it was an Emperor.</speak>

<info>Enter a Trisolian.</info>

<speak who="MERG">
Excuse me, Your Majesty, I am Merg, 
the High Priest. If I might interject?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
You might.</speak>

<speak who="MERG">
I humbly advise that as your first act 
you choose a capable Prime Minister. 
I suggest Gorgak, the previous appointee.</speak>

<speak who="GORGAK">
I will be a forceful and effective administrator.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
You know, Fry, I've often thought about 
becoming a Prime Minister.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
I gotta go with Bender.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Yes! In your face, Gorgak!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
That's it, Fry. As your captain I order 
you back to the ship. You are in way 
over your head.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Gee, you think so, Captain? I'd better 
check with my Prime Minister.</speak>

<info>Bender is now sat being fanned.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Stay the course, pal!</speak>

<speak who="GORGAK">
Your Highness, a package came for you.</speak>

<info>He hands Fry the same package he was supposed to deliver earlier.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Hey, thanks!  Wow! This got here just 
in time.</speak>

<info>He hangs it on a column next to his throne.</info>

<info>Trisol Palace Harem. The room is full of shelves which are full 
of bottles of Trisolians. Merg is with Fry.</info>

<speak who="MERG">
This is Your Majesty's harem. You may 
choose any of these maidens to be your 
royal consort.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Umm, how about that one?</speak>

<info>He points to a random bottle.</info>

<speak who="MERG">
Oh! I didn't realise Your Majesty was 
into that sort of thing!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
On second thought, I'll take that one.</speak>

<info>He points to another random bottle.</info>

<speak who="MERG">
Hey, whatever you say, I'm not here 
to pass judgement.</speak>

<info>Trisol Palace Throne Room. The crew are lounging around enjoying 
themselves. Amy is stirring a glass of water with her finger. 
Leela paces up and down.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Does anyone else think it's odd that 
a shiftless 25-year-old delivery boy 
could drop out of the sky, kill the 
emperor and be rewarded instead of punished?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
You don't have to beat around the bush, 
Leela, we all know who you're talking 
about...uh, me, right?</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
I don't think you have anything to worry 
about. These people seem really mild-mannered.</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
They are mild. In fact, you're soaking 
in one right now.</speak>

<info>Amy screams and takes her finger out of the glass. Gorgak appears 
from it.</info>

<speak who="GORGAK">
You touched me in ways I've never been 
touched before.</speak>

<info>Enter Merg.</info>

<speak who="MERG">
Ah, there you are, Your Majesty. It's 
time to begin preparing for tomorrow's 
coronation ceremony.</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
A fancy dress gala! I'll wear my formal 
shell.</speak>

<speak who="MERG">
Fry will be enthroned tomorrow at the 
setting of the three suns when we Trisolians 
enter our nocturnal phase.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
There won't be a lot of long-winded 
speeches, will there?</speak>

<speak who="MERG">
Only one. The absolutely flawless recitation 
from memory of the royal oath. By you.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Will there be cake?</speak>

<info>Trisolian Banquet Hall. It is the Pre-Coronation Gala. Trisolians 
perform on a stage. Zoidberg talks to two Trisolians.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Yeah, I know.</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
Hi!</speak>

<info>She wiggles her fingers. Fry pours a glass of something for 
Merg.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
There you go.</speak>

<info>The Trisolians playing the liquid harmonica with themselves 
as the liquid finish. The audience applauds and Gorgak takes 
the stage.</info>

<speak who="GORGAK">
And now, get ready to laugh til your 
sides leak with our planet's foremost 
political satirist, Florp!</speak>

<info>He leaves and Florp walks onto the stage.</info>

<speak who="FLORP">
So what is the deal with people from 
under the orange sun? They're all... 
But us guys from under the red sun, 
we're like... Right? Am I right?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Oh, yeah! Yeah, he's right!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
<info>(whispering)</info> Fry, I have to talk to 
you. You're in terrible danger.</speak>

<info>Trisol Palace Corridor. On the walls of the corridor are paintings 
of past Trisolian Emperors.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
You see Emperor Plon here?  He met his 
end when he was drunk by Emperor Strug. 
And before he could even wipe his mouth, 
Strug was drunk by Shwab.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
So?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Look at all these guys. Do you have 
any idea what the average length of 
their reigns was?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
80,000 years?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
No. One week.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Damn! I knew you wouldn't have asked 
unless it was really high or really 
low.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Every Emperor ascended to power by assassinating 
the previous one. And guess who's next?</speak>

<info>She points at Fry's portrait. Fry looks at some empty frames 
labelled Fry's Assassin and Fry's Assassin's Assassin. He points 
at the last one.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Well at least my assassin will get what's 
coming to him.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
You're in tremendous danger, you idiot! 
Half of these Emperors were drunk at 
their own coronation.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Hey, I plan on having a few brewskis 
myself.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
No, they were assassinated. In fact, 
the law says you'll be killed on the 
spot if you fail to recite the oath 
from memory.</speak>

<info>She holds up a book called Oath Vol. I.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Yeah, I was going to thumb through that 
later.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
That is completely reckless. Don't you 
ever think ahead?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Hell, no. If I stopped to think ahead, 
I wouldn't be Emperor. And I wouldn't 
even be here in the year 3000. It's 
just like the story of the grasshopper 
and the octopus. All year long the grasshopper 
kept burying acorns for winter while 
the octopus mooched off his girlfriend 
and watched TV. But then the winter 
came and the grasshopper died and the 
octopus ate all his acorns and also 
he got a racecar. Is any of this getting 
through to you?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
I give up! You're gonna get yourself 
killed and this time I won't be here 
to save you.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Who asked you to? I told you a hundred 
times to stop treating me like a baby. 
Now go. Go gather your nuts you nagging 
grasshopper.</speak>

<info>Leela angrily throws down the book.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
That's it! I'm never helping you again! 
If anyone except you needs me, I'll 
be in the ship.</speak>

<info>She storms off.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
I'll be fine. It's not like anyone's 
gonna drink me.  Quit it!</speak>

<info>He knocks the straw away from his neck and it disappears back 
into the hole in the painting.</info>

<info>Trisol Palace Front Balcony. The Planet Express crew sans Leela 
are gathered with Fry. Merg is on a podium facing across the 
Trisolian Surface where millions of Trisolians are gathered to 
hear Fry's oath.</info>

<speak who="MERG">
People of Trisol, it is my honour to 
present your new Emperor!</speak>

<info>The Trisolians applaud Fry, who takes Merg's place on the podium. 
Fry clears his throat.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
What up?</speak>

<info>Silence from the crowd.</info>

<speak who="MERG">
Stick to the oath.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Right! I, Fry, who drank Bont the Viscous, 
who drank Ungo the Moist, who guzzled 
Zorn the Stagnant...</speak>

<info>Time Lapse. The suns are nearly set. Fry is still reciting the 
oath by reading it from his arm.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
...who slurped Hudge the Dewy, who enjoyed 
a soup composed principally of Throm 
the Chunky, do solemnly swear to rule 
with honour and insanity - uh, integrity!</speak>

<speak who="MERG">
Congratulations, Your Highness.  I now 
present you with your royal unisex robe. 
Long live Fry The Solid!</speak>

<info>He puts the robe on Fry. The Trisolians cheer. The suns begin 
to go down.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Hey, look. The suns are setting. I can 
finally switch to hard liquor!</speak>

<info>He gets a bottle out of his chest cabinet. The three suns set 
and the Trisolians begin to turn a lighter shade of blue.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Check out the glowing freaks. It's beautiful! 
Hey, what's that?</speak>

<info>He points at Fry's stomach. It is turning blue and growing a 
face. The Trisolians gasp and quickly return to normal shade.</info>

<speak who="MERG">
The Emperor Bont! He's still alive.</speak>

<speak who="BONT">
Of course I'm alive. Now cut this creep 
open and drain me out!</speak>

<info>Guards close in on Fry. Fry clutches his stomach.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
My tummy hurts!</speak>

<info>The guards and Merg chase Fry, Amy, Zoidberg and Bender up the 
steps.</info>

<speak who="BONT">
They're over here, they're running up 
the stairs.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Shut up, you!</speak>

<info>He punches Bont, hurting Fry.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Ow!</speak>

<info>Cut to: Trisol Palace Throne Room. The crew get inside the palace 
and bolt the door.</info>

<info>Cut to: Outside Throne Room.</info>

<speak who="MERG">
Let us in!</speak>

<info>Cut to: Trisol Palace Throne Room.</info>

<speak who="MERG">
Fry must die so that Bont may live.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
What am I gonna do?</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
We've gotta get the Emperor out of your 
body before they kill you!</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Relax, Fry. I'll simply spin you in 
a high-speed centrifuge separating out 
the denser fluid of His Highness.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
But won't that crush my bones?</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Oh, right, right, with the bones! I 
always forget about the bones.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Hey, why don't you just sweat him out?</speak>

<speak who="BONT">
Forget it! As Emperor I refuse to be 
dripped out through somebody's armpit.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
I could vomit or urinate. Would you 
feel better about that?</speak>

<speak who="BONT">
Slightly. But my favourite so far is 
the bone-crushing.</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
What about crying?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
That's a great idea! Crying.</speak>

<speak who="BONT">
Fine. That or the bone one.</speak>

<info>Cut to: Outside Throne Room. Trisolians are throwing themselves 
at the door. As they hit it they turn into pools of water. They 
regroup themselves and stand up.</info>

<speak who="MERG">
Keep it up, men. The veneer is starting 
to peel.</speak>

<info>Gorgak throws himself at the door but can't re-solidify.</info>

<speak who="GORGAK">
Oh, dear!</speak>

<info>Cut to: Trisol Palace Throne Room. Fry is trying to cry.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
It's no use. I wanna cry but I'm just 
too macho.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
I'll make you cry, buddy!  You're a 
pimple on society's ass and you'll never 
amount to anything.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
What do you mean? I was Emperor of a 
whole planet.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Good point. But here's a disturbing 
reminder: Everyone you knew or loved 
in the 20th century is dead.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
These things happen.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
OK, Fry, grab a Kleenex for this one, 
'cause there's no God and your idiotic 
human ideals are laughable!</speak>

<info>He laughs evily.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Phew! That's a load off my mind.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Man, I guess it's harder than I thought 
to make someone cry.</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
You did your best, Bender.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Up yours, bimbo!</speak>

<info>Amy bursts into tears.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Let's face it, we're in hot butter here. 
We should call Leela for help.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Cram it, lobster!  That is a good idea. 
I'll go call her.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
She'll never help me. She's still mad 
that I told her never to help me.</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
C'mon. Leela's not the type to hold 
a grudge.</speak>

<info>Ships Cargo Bay. Leela is punching and kicking a punch bag with 
Fry's photo taped to it. The phone rings.</info>

<speak who="OPERATOR">
Collect call from...</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
I'm not giving my name to a machine.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
I'll accept.</speak>

<info>Bender appears on the phone screen.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Fry's in trouble...</speak>

<info>Cut to: Trisol Palace. Bender is sat on a chair in front of 
the payphone.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
...and he needs help. Now, I don't like 
you and you don't like me.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
I like you.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
You do? Look are you going to help or 
not?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
I don't know why I should. I mean after 
what he --</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Wait, wait, wait, wait.  What is it 
you like best about me?</speak>

<info>Trisol Palace Throne Room. Enter Bender.</info>

<speak who="AMY">
Is she coming?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
I'm not sure. But I do know that she 
likes my in-your-face attitude.</speak>

<info>There is a rumbling from outside. The crew gather around a window 
and look out. The Trisolians are pulling a giant lemon juicer-like 
thing towards the palace.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
What the hell is that?</speak>

<speak who="BONT">
Its the Juice-A-Matic 4000. It'll strain 
my juices from you while filtering out 
the pulp. By which I mean, your shredded 
remains.</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Of course! Why didn't I think of that!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
This is the saddest day of my life. 
And I still can't cry.</speak>

<info>Fry sits in his throne but a splashing noise from outside attracts 
the others to the window.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Wait a second. Here comes Leela.</speak>

<info>Cut to: Outside Trisol Palace. Leela kicks her way through the 
crowd of Trisolian guards, splashing them to oblivion. They swarm 
her.</info>

<info>Cut to: Trisol Palace Throne Room.</info>

<speak who="AMY">
Oh, no. They have her totally outnumbered.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
I can't believe it. She's risking her 
life for me after the way I treated 
her. I don't deserve this. I feel terrible.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
You do? Hmm.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Is she alright?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
I don't know. Perhaps I'll look out 
this window. Oh, dear God in heaven, 
they're swarming all over her.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
No. No!</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
What are you talking about, Bender? 
She's al --  <info>(muffled)</info> Oh!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
They're strapping her to juicer. Oh, 
they're putting some ice cubes in the 
glass under it.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
This can't be happening.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
It can and, for all you know, it is. 
I'm sorry, Fry. She's dead.</speak>

<info>Fry starts to cry and Amy catches his tear in the bottle.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
All Leela ever wanted to do was help 
me. But I was to proud, too stupid to 
accept it.  I wish I had died instead 
of her.</speak>

<info>He starts to cry. Enter Leela via the window.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
What are you talking about?</speak>

<info>Fry stops crying.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Leela! You're alive!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Of course I'm alive.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
I told Fry you were dead so he would 
cry out the Emperor but you had to go 
and wreck it by surviving.</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
We only got two drops.</speak>

<info>There is a bang at the door. The Trisolians begin leaking in 
through a hole. Bont chuckles.</info>

<speak who="BONT">
It's only a matter of time now.</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
I'll handle this!</speak>

<info>He tries to block the leak with his claw and eventually gets 
it under control by forcing one of his mouth flaps into the hole.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Listen, Fry, I think I can get us out 
of this if you're willing to let me 
help you.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Thanks, Leela. From now on, I'll take 
all the help you're willing to give. 
I know you just want what's best for 
me.  Ow! What was that for?  Hey, come 
on!  That hurt!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
I know. Amy, get the bottle.</speak>

<info>She carries on beating Fry up while Amy holds the bottle under 
his eye.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
<info>(crying)</info> Oh, now I understand.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Come on. Everybody help out Fry.</speak>

<info>She slaps him again, Zoidberg pinches his leg with his claw 
and Bender stubs out a cigar on his arm.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
<info>(crying)</info> Thanks, everybody. I love you 
all. You guys are true -- ow! Cut it 
out, Bender! That's a tender area!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
How we doing, Amy?</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
Great! We're one-tenth of the way there.</speak>

<info>Time Lapse. Leela, Zoidberg and Bender are tired out. Amy keeps 
kicking the Emperor out of Fry. She pants.</info>

<speak who="AMY">
OK, it's your turn.</speak>

<info>She points to someone. A Trisolian starts to hit Fry with a 
chair.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Hey, wait a minute! Who are you?</speak>

<speak who="BONT">
I'm the Emperor! Thanks for crying me 
out.</speak>

<info>Fry looks at his stomach and sees it's back to normal.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Oh, you're welcome.</speak>

<info>Bont hits him with the chair again.</info>

<info>Cut to: Outside Trisolian Palace. The crowds have gone. Fry 
cries in pain from inside.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Hey! Save some for me!</speak>

<info>THE END</info>
