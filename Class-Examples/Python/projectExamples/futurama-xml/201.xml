                         But she saved all our lives. Without 
                         her, we're light enough to get away.

                         Don't cry, Bender. Nobody really knows 
                         what happens in a black hole. It's possible 
                         she's still alive in another dimension 
                         somewhere. Right, Professor?

                         At least I'll always have her bracelet! 
                          What do you think it's worth?
