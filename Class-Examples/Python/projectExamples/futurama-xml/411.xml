               TV. A graphic of the sun peeking over the Earth appears on the 
               screen then it changes to Morbo and Linda in the regular Good 
               Morning Earth studio.</note>

                         Welcome back. Our next guest has been 
                         teaching the world to cook for over 
                         20 years. But apparently my uh, wife 
                         hasn't been listening.

                         universe's largest bottle. I put a tiny 
                         spaceship inside to keep it from being 
                         boring.

                         Bender, hear me well, I shall train 
                         you. But first you must forget everything 
                         you know about cooking.

               Best � la The Karate Kid. First he learns to peel hover potatoes 
               blindfolded � la Luke's Jedi training in A New Hope. Spargle 
               puts a salad under Bender's ass and Bender grinds some peppercorns 
               by putting them in his mouth and twisting his head. The groud 
               pepper drops onto the salad from his ass. Spargle gives him the 
               thumbs up. Next Bender chops a vegetable very quickly with a 
               knife and ends up chopping up half his arm as well. Spargle takes 
               the knife from him, shows it to some hobos and robos and then 
               chops a tomato like someone would in those sharp knife adverts.

                         Wait! Everyone must know. I broke the 
                         Professor's bottled ship.  And what 
                         is worse, I framed my dearest friend 
                         Fry! (crying) I can never repay him 
                         his ten dollars. So I must take the 
                         only honourable path. what the killing 
                         myself.  Here I go already.  Huh?

                         And that's how I defeated Elzar - thanks 
                         to Spargle's magic liquid.

                         Yes, we were there. And we just finished 
                         watching it on TV.

                         Hmm. Let me see that vial Bender.  Good 
                         Lord! According to the spectrolizer, 
                         Spargle's magic ingredient was...water. 
                         Ordinary water!

                         Ah, so the real gift Spargle gave you 
                         was confidence. The confidence to be 
                         your best.

                         Yes, ordinary water. Laced with nothing 
                         more than a few spoonfuls of LSD.

                         The important thing is, by my standards, 
                         I won fair and square. Now, who wants 
                         brunch? Cooked with plenty of..."confidence"?
