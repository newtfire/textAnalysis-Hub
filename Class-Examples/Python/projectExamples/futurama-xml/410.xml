               a pair of binoculars. Leela, Bender and Farnsworth sit at the 
               table.</note>

                         Oh put down the binoculars Fry. The 
                         wall of that strip club isn't going 
                         to collapse twice in one day.

                         I know, and I've grown to accept that. 
                         Now I'm more interested in that new 
                         pizza parlour across the street. Kinda 
                         makes me pine for my days as a pizza 
                         delivery boy. "Here's you pizza," I'd 
                         say. "I didn't order any," they'd say. 
                         And then I'd be off to my next adventure.

                         For starters, only use quality ingredients. 
                         Case in point: No more live bees.  Oregano 
                         works equally well. And when you put 
                         pizzas in the oven, don't get in with 
                         them.

                         Ah, here we are - the worst player in 
                         history. If I can be just a little better
