                         Oh my. Anyway, your immunity is due

                         made you your own grandfather.

                         Yes you do! You came back in time to 
                         knock me into that freezer. Now I came 
                         back in time to stop you.

                         I did not come back in time. My people 
                         lack that ability.

                         But, I know you in the future. I cleaned 
                         your poop.

                         Quite possible. We live long and are 
                         celebrated poopers. You will meet me 
                         when I'm a thousand years older.

                         Please. Our saviours foresee that in 
                         a thousand years, at one moment, the 
                         fate of the universe will depend on 
                         you. Since you will not live that long 
                         I must freeze you now.
