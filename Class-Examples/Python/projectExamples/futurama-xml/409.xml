                         Back in the 1980's I was the toast of 
                         Wall Street. I was having whiskey with 
                         Boesky and cookies with Milken. But 
                         then, I was diagnosed with terminal 
                         boneitis.

                         There was no cure at the time. One drug 
                         company was close but I arranged a hostile 
                         takeover and sold off all the assets. 
                         Made a cool hundred mil.  Naturally 
                         I froze myself until a cure was found.

                         Look, everyone wants to be like Germany 
                         but do we really have the pure strength 
                         of will?

                         This isn't a business, I've always thought
