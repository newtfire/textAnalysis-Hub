<info>Lodgatorium Comfort Dome Inn: Corridor. A man attatches a "5" 
to a sign reading "Planet Express tockholders Meeting" so the 
third word reads "5tockholders."</info>

<speak who="MAN">
Yes, good thing I noticed the similar 
shapes.</speak>

<info>Cut to: Lodgatorium Comfort Dome Inn: Ballroom A. Hermes hosts 
the stockholders meeting. Present are the Planet Express crew 
and Hattie.</info>

<info>The curtain opens and he pushes him forward.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Ohh!</speak>

<info>The stockholders cheer.</info>

<speak who="AMY">
There he is!</speak>

<speak who="HATTIE"><info>(SHOUTING)</info>
Take it off!</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Where am I?</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
Move forward. Walk into the light.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Oh God! I'm dead. Well, no matter.  
<info>(reading)</info> Thank you all for coming. 
I don't recognise any of you, nor can 
I recall why I am here. Now without 
further ado, a film highlighting Planet 
Express Inc.'s latest fiscal year.</speak>

<info>The stockholders applaud and a film comes on showing the Planet 
Express ship flying over some water away from a sunset.</info>

<speak who="NARRATOR"><info>IN FILM</info>
Planet Express is on the move. For this 
young, hip delivery compnay, tomorrow 
is today and today is yesterday. You 
heard me.  It was a year of soaring 
profits and significant one time losses.</speak>

<info>The ship takes off from Amazonia and immediately crashes.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
I'll not only help you find it, I'll 
help you do more to it!</speak>

<info>Lodgatorium Comfort Dome Inn: Corridor. Fry and Zoidberg walk 
out of Ballroom A and Fry sees a sign outside Ballroom B.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Ooo, a bot-mitzvah. Shalom hunger, shalom 
free food!</speak>

<info>He walks in and Zoidberg follows. A robot blocks Zoidberg's 
path.</info>

<speak who="ROBOT #1">
No shellfish!</speak>

<info>He slams the door.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
That is so unfair!</speak>

<speak who="PIG">
Tell me about it.</speak>

<info>Cut to: Lodgatorium Comfort Dome Inn: Ballroom B. The Jewbots 
dance around the bot-mitvah bot and Fry gets some food from the 
buffet.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
So what's the deal? You guys don't believe 
in Robot Jesus?</speak>

<speak who="ROBOT #2">
We believe he was built and that he 
was a very well programmed robot but 
he wasn't our Messiah.</speak>

<info>Cut to: Lodgatorium Comfort Dome Inn: Ballroom A. The film is 
still going on. The Planet Express ship soars into space with 
fireworks trailing behind it.</info>

<speak who="NARRATOR"><info>IN FILM</info>
And so our company flames onwards. Planet 
Express: Limitless potential, boundless 
horizons, the unstoppable juggernaut 
of the corporate universe.</speak>

<info>The Planet Express ship passes through a ring and forms the 
company logo. The film ends.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
It's been a terrible year people. The 
company is on the verge of bankruptcy.</speak>

<info>The stockholders gasp.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
But the movie -</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
Was a substantial loss for the company. 
The blue slice represent s the money 
we earned from shipping packages while 
the green slice represents an $8 bank 
error in our favour.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
This toads the wet sprocket. What about 
our thousands of shares of stock?</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
Worthless.</speak>

<info>The stockholders gasp.</info>

<speak who="BENDER"><info>(SHOUTING)</info>
I'll kill you!</speak>

<speak who="HATTIE">
I own one share of Planet kajiggers 
so I'm entitled to some answers. Question 
1: Why does no one visit me in my home?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
'Cause your apartment smells like Polygrip 
and cat pee.</speak>

<info>Lodgatorium Comfort Dome Inn: Corridor. Fry sees a sign outside 
Ballroom C for a cryogenic support group. He gasps.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
This is perfect for me.</speak>

<info>He was actually looking at the free food sign underneath. Zoidberg 
follows him in.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Question: Do you have to have been cryogenically 
frozen to get the free -  You didn't 
let me finish. I was going to say "to 
get the free food."</speak>

<info>Cut to: Lodgatorium Comfort Dome Inn: Ballroom C. Fry gobbles 
down the food at the buffet while the support group discusses 
things.</info>

<speak who="JOE">
My name's Joe and I'm a defrostee.</speak>

<speak who="EVERYONE">
Hello Joe.</speak>

<speak who="JOE">
When I was frozen giant carrots ruled 
the Earth. But now they don't. It takes 
some getting used to.</speak>

<info>He sits down and the group applauds. Fry has sat down with a 
plate of food. Another man stands up.</info>

<speak who="THAT GUY">
Back in the 1980's I was the toast of 
Wall Street. I was having whiskey with 
Boesky and cookies with Milken. But 
then, I was diagnosed with terminal 
boneitis.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Boneitis? Pft! That's a funny name for 
a horrible disease.</speak>

<speak who="THAT GUY">
There was no cure at the time. One drug 
company was close but I arranged a hostile 
takeover and sold off all the assets. 
Made a cool hundred mil.  Naturally 
I froze myself until a cure was found. 
Now here I am, ready to sleaze my way 
back to the top, 80's style!</speak>

<info>He sits down next to Fry.</info>

<speak who="CAVEMAN">
As a caveman frozen in a glacier I face 
different challenges. <info>(crying)</info> The hardest 
thign was seeing my wife on display 
in the British Museum.</speak>

<info>The group murmurs.</info>

<speak who="THAT GUY">
Sure do! We can dance!</speak>

<info>He hums the Safety Dance tune and they both laugh.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Y'know that dance wasn't as safe as 
they said it was.</speak>

<speak who="THAT GUY">
I tell you, two go-go 80's Reganauts 
like us, we could rule this world!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
No question.</speak>

<speak who="THAT GUY">
If only someone would give us a shot.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
They're scared of our raw power. Oh 
but if you want a job, I could beg everyone 
at the company where I work.</speak>

<speak who="THAT GUY">
Awesome. Awesome to the max!</speak>

<info>Lodgatorium Comfort Dome Inn: Ballroom A. Enter Fry and That 
Guy.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
And finally, the post office meter is 
for business mail only.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Aw come on! I got a lot of ransom notes 
to send!</speak>

<speak who="HATTIE">
Enough talk. It's time for action. I 
move that everyone come to my apartment 
to snuggle my cat.</speak>

<speak who="SCRUFFY">
Second.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
I move that your cat stinks and is ugly.</speak>

<speak who="SCRUFFY">
Second.</speak>

<speak who="HATTIE">
I move that we vote on a new Chief Executive 
Officer and oust this old creep. And 
also that make cat smells good and is 
pretty.</speak>

<info>Scruffy thinks.</info>

<speak who="SCRUFFY">
Second.</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
Very well. I nominate the Professor.</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
Second.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Second.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Second.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
I'm your man.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
I vote my 10,000 shares for the Professor.</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
Yeah the Professor!</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Me!</speak>

<info>Hermes writes 50,000 on a chart for Farnsworth.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
I nominate That Guy. Not just because 
he has a suit but because he knows about 
business and stuff and he has a tie. 
My shares still count if they went 
through the washing machine right?</speak>

<info>Hermes starts a new chart for That Guy next to Farnsworth's 
and write 10,000 under his name.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
Well, if I know anything about which 
number is bigger than the other number, 
I'd say that -</speak>

<speak who="SCRUFFY">
Hold on there. Scruffy votes his 40,000 
shares for the mysterious stranger.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
40,000? How come you have four times 
as much stock as the rest of us?</speak>

<speak who="SCRUFFY">
Scruffy believes in this company.</speak>

<info>He sniffs and wipes away a tear. Hermes changes That Guy's score 
to 50,000.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
Then we have a tie. And in the event 
of a tie the Professor, as the current 
CEO remains -</speak>

<speak who="HATTIE">
I demand the floor. I may only have 
one share but I get to vote same as 
anyone. And I'm voting against the cat 
hater.  Isn't that right kitty?  Hey! 
You ate my change!</speak>

<info>She shakes the cat and the money inside it jingles. Hermes changes 
That Guy's score to 50,001.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
Then it's settled. The new chief executive 
officer of Planet Express corporation 
is That Guy.</speak>

<info>That Guy hums Safety Dance.</info>

<info>Planet Express: Meeting Room.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
Please welcome our new chief executive 
officer, That Guy.</speak>

<info>Fry applauds and hoots. The rest of the crew glare at him.</info>

<speak who="THAT GUY">
Let's cut to the chase. There are two 
kinds of people: sheep and sharks. Anyone 
who's a sheep is fired. Who's a sheep?</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Uh excuse me? Which is the one people 
like to hug?</speak>

<speak who="THAT GUY">
Gutsy question, you're a shark. Sharks 
are winners and they don't look back 
'cause they don't have necks. Necks 
are for sheep.  I am proud to be the 
shepherd of this herd of sharks and 
I am gonna lead you to the top of this 
industry of...of...</speak>

<speak who="FRY"><info>(WHISPERING)</info>
Package delivery.</speak>

<speak who="THAT GUY">
Package delviery? Oh God!  Fantastic! 
Now the first order of business is to 
blame everything on the guy before me. 
Professor?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
I'll ruin you like I ruined this company.</speak>

<speak who="THAT GUY">
Terrific. Question number one: What 
was your overall business plan?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Uh, um, uh business plan, uh, yes. I 
keep it here - right next to my heart.</speak>

<info>He opens a drawer and pulls out a file next to a jar with a 
heart in it. He hands the file to That Guy.</info>

<speak who="THAT GUY">
This isn't a business plan, it's an 
escape plan.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
So long suckers!</speak>

<info>He climbs down a ladder and runs across the hangar floor laughing 
insanely.</info>

<speak who="THAT GUY">
Fry, as a fellow 80's dollar jockey, 
I'm making you my new vice chairman.</speak>

<info>Fry cheers.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
I'm rollin' up the corporate ramp.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Ohh!</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
It's the end of the line!</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
We're ruined!</speak>

<speak who="SCRUFFY">
What fevered dream is this that bids 
to tear this company in twain?</speak>

<info>He leans back and starts reading National Pornographic.</info>

<info>Outside Giorgio Armonster. Exit Fry and That Guy from the shop 
sporting 80's style suits. The monster waves them off.</info>

<speak who="MONSTER">
Thank you come again!</speak>

<speak who="THAT GUY">
That's what I call a hostile makeover! 
Hair gel?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
No thanks I make my own.</speak>

<info>He slicks his hair back.</info>

<info>Ship's Cockpit.</info>

<speak who="THAT GUY">
This company's gonna shoot straight 
to the top and stay there! Like Cindy 
Lauper! I ask you: Who is the number 
one delivery service on Earth?</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Is it Planet Express master?</speak>

<info>That Guy laughs.</info>

<speak who="THAT GUY">
Is this guy a shark or what? Seriously 
though we stink out loud. Here's the 
big enchirito.  Mom's Friendly Delivery 
Company.</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
We can't compete with Mom! Her company 
is big, and evil. Ours is small and 
neutral.</speak>

<speak who="THAT GUY">
Switzerland is small and neutral. We're 
more like Germany; ambitious and misunderstood.</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
Look, everyone wants to be like Germany 
but do we really have the pure strength 
of will?</speak>

<speak who="THAT GUY">
I say we do! Now are we gonna let ourselves 
be beaten by an old lady?</speak>

<info>Zoidberg bows.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Yes my liege!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
No we're not. And as vice chairman, 
I believe I speak for the entire board 
when I issue this challenge to Mom. 
Look at my butt!</speak>

<info>He presses it up against the window and cheers.</info>

<info>Cut to: Mom's Office. Mom, Walt, Larry and Igner look out the 
window.</info>

<speak who="MOM">
You call that a pressed ham? Walt, hit 
the retaliate button.</speak>

<info>Walt looks at a control panel.</info>

<speak who="WALT">
Uh, um, hmm lets see.</speak>

<speak who="MOM">
Any button they all retaliate!</speak>

<info>Walt presses a random button.</info>

<info>Cut to: Outside Mom's Building. The sign on the top of the building 
with Mom bottle-feeding a parcel like a baby suddenly turns eeevil. 
The bottle turns towards the Planet Express ship and fires lasers 
at it. The crew scream from inside and the ship flies away.</info>

<info>Madison Cube Garden. Fry and That Guy are sitting in the VIP 
section with Zapp, Calculon, Morbo and Jackie Anderson watching 
the big ape fight. The apes fight and scream. Fry hoots.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Woo yeah! Hit him hit him hit him!  
Now this is the high life! Watching 
apes mangle each other near celebrities!</speak>

<speak who="THAT GUY">
In my day we went to coke parties but 
the principle's the same.</speak>

<info>An ape screams and throws it's trike at Calculon.</info>

<speak who="CALCULON">
Get your stinkin' trike off me you damn 
dirty ape.</speak>

<speak who="THAT GUY">
Listen big guy, now that you're my prod�g�, 
it's time I cut you in on the secret 
to success. Any guesses?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Uh, work really really hard?</speak>

<speak who="THAT GUY">
No.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Oh thank God!</speak>

<speak who="THAT GUY">
It's all about appearances. That's why 
its time to update our company's stodgy 
image and give it the sleek dazzling 
veneer of the 1980's!</speak>

<info>Planet Express: Meeting Room. Enter Fry and That Guy on rocket 
powered chairs. The rest of the crew are asleep at the table. 
Fry claps and they suddenly wake up.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
This company's on the fast track to 
the It List! Blast back kudos all around!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Uh hello? We haven't made one delivery 
since you two took over.</speak>

<speak who="THAT GUY">
Delivery has nothing to do with the 
delivery business. Image people, image! 
Scope out this new ad!</speak>

<info>He presses a button on the remote and an advert comes on the 
big screen. A Planet Express-ified version of Apple's 1984 ad. 
A woman runs into a building with a Planet Express package. Mom 
is on a huge screen.</info>

<speak who="MOM"><info>ON AD</info>
We are all one. With one mind, one purpose 
and one act. Our enemy shall be eaten 
by scorpions!  We shall bow down and 
worship to ourselves.  We shall prevail!</speak>

<info>The package hits the screen and it explodes. A man in the audience 
stands up.</info>

<speak who="MAN"><info>ON AD</info>
Hey! We were watching that!</speak>

<info>The scene freezes and a new Planet Express logo appears on the 
screen � la the FedEx logo only this time it's PlanEx.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
That was terrible! People won't even 
know what we do.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
I don't even know what we do. Nah just 
kidding, what are like a bus or something?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Did you approve that awful ad Fry?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Yes I did Leels! And I'll tell you why. 
Because it grows the brand.</speak>

<info>That Guy pats his shoulder.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Oh Lord!</speak>

<info>Zoidberg growls.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
This company's circling the drain I 
tell you. I'd sell my stock right now 
for a sangwich!</speak>

<speak who="THAT GUY">
Sold!</speak>

<info>He gets a sandwich out of a Miami Vice lunchbox and hands it 
to Zoidberg.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
A complete sangwich?  You got fleeced! 
I would have settled for a hard roll 
with ketchup inside!</speak>

<info>Mom's Office. She runs on a running machine while looking at 
Mentor magazine and Prot�g� magazine. That Guy and Fry are on 
each cover.</info>

<speak who="MOM">
What is this moose drip?  The new delivery 
kings? I'm sick of hearing about those 
turtle squirts!</speak>

<speak who="IGNER">
But they're kings mommy!</speak>

<speak who="MOM">
Jam a bastard in it you crap!</speak>

<info>She slaps them.</info>

<info>Elzar's Fine Cuisine: Private Dining Room. That Guy and Fry 
are seated in a cosy little room.</info>

<speak who="ELZAR">
Enjoy our private dining room folks! 
This is where we serve our richest most 
successful chumps!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Tonight, that's us!</speak>

<speak who="THAT GUY">
What have you got that's really overpriced?</speak>

<speak who="ELZAR">
Everything.</speak>

<speak who="THAT GUY">
Bring me that.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Make it two. And a glass of all your 
water.</speak>

<info>Elzar leaves and That guy pulls out some card from his jacket.</info>

<speak who="THAT GUY">
OK, lets work on your execu-speak. I'm 
worried about "blank."</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Don't you worry about "blank" let me 
worry about "blank."</speak>

<speak who="THAT GUY">
Very good. I also would have accepted 
"Blank? Blank?! you're not looking at 
the big picture!"</speak>

<info>Mom coughs from behind Fry and he and That Guy look up.</info>

<speak who="FRY"><info>(WEAKLY)</info>
What a pleasant surprise!</speak>

<speak who="MOM">
Shut up booger blaster! It's time the 
three of us had a talk.</speak>

<speak who="THAT GUY">
I'll handle this Fry. You get back to 
the farm, shift some paradigms, revolutionise 
outside the box.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
I'm on it. But if you need me you know 
where I'll be.</speak>

<info>He walks through a door to the wine cellar and falls down the 
steps.</info>

<info>Planet Express: Fry's Office. Fry irons his tie.</info>

<info>Enter Leela, Bender, Hermes, Zoidberg, Amy, Scruffy and Farnsworth.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">

<speak who="FRY">

Let me worry about blank!</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
That Guy is nothing but a flashy con 
man! And you've been hypnotised by his 
swinging blogney!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">

<speak who="SUZ"><info>ON INTERCOM</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Thanks doll.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
I don't care what Ms Johnson says, Thst 
Guy's turning this place into some kind 
of...business.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
This isn't a business, I've always thought 
of it as more of a source of cheap labour. 
Like a family.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
You're right Professor. We might not 
be a traditional family like the Murphy's 
next door or the lesbian coven across 
the street but we are a family, and 
That Guy understands that.</speak>

<info>That Guy appears on a screen.</info>

<speak who="THAT GUY"><info>ON SCREEN</info>
Everyone's fired and we're out of business.</speak>

<info>Everyone gasps.</info>

<speak who="AMY">

<speak who="THAT GUY"><info>ON SCREEN</info>
I'm gonna sell Planet Express to Mom 
so she can gut the company and eliminate 
us as competitors.</speak>

<speak who="MOM"><info>ON SCREEN</info>
Don't let the door hit you on your way 
out. 'Cause I don't want ass prints 
on my new door!</speak>

<info>The screen cuts out and the ex-crew glare at Fry. He presses 
the launch button on his chair and it takes off, struggles, and 
crashes down again. Everyone glares harder. Fry presses the intercom.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Uh Ms Johnson? Please bring in some 
more chair fuel.</speak>

<info>Planet Express: Locker Area. Everyone clears out their lockers.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
I had no idea the company would be sold. 
I was just an innocent suck up. You've 
gotta believe me!</speak>

<info>Leela slams her door shut.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Just leave us alone and let us clear 
out our lockers.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Yeah.</speak>

<info>He slams Hermes' door shut and chuckles. Amy clears out her 
locker and puts her stuff in a box a man is holding for her.</info>

<speak who="AMY"><info>(CRYING)</info>
It's so sad, where will I go? What will 
I do?</speak>

<speak who="LACKEY">

Oh. That'll be fun.</speak>

<info>Planet Express: Fry's Office. Fry sighs and presses the intercom

Am I still a good person?</speak>

<speak who="SUZ"><info>ON INTERCOM</info>
I don't know sir. I'm a program built 
into the intercom.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
I've got to redeem myself. Somehow, 
sometime, for some reason. I'll block 
this takeover!</speak>

<speak who="SUZ"><info>ON INTERCOM</info>
Mr Fry, your 2 o'clock magician is here.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Believe it or not, I have more important

my hands.  Reschedule.</speak>

<info>The Planet Express ship flies towards the Intergalactic Stock

<speak who="AMY">
Oh no.</speak>

<speak who="THAT GUY">
I neglected to mention that the shares 
I bought from Dr Zoidberg gave me majority 
control.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Zoidberg owned 51% of the company?</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
The shares were worthless and he kept 
asking for toilet paper.</speak>

<speak who="MOM">
And now if Momcorp shareholders will 
cast their ballots.</speak>

<info>She selects Yes and the Momcorp vote goes up to 99.7% Yes. Walt

<info>The securitybots take the crew away leaving only a sleeping 
Farnsworth and Hattie in their seats.</info>

<speak who="MOM">
Momcorp will now purchase all outstanding 
shares of Planet Express at the current 
market price which is...</speak>

<info>On the screen behind her PLNX 107 appears.</info>

<speak who="JOR">-EL
107.</speak>

<info>Cut to: Outside Business Centre. The securitybots drop the crew 
onto the floor.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Ow! And also it hurt my feelings!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
They are? Oh my God! I'm a millionaire! 
Suddenly I have an opinion about that 
capital gains tax!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Yeah all right!</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
I'm even richer!</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Oh! I have no shares!  Wait! My sangwich! 
Has it also appreciated in value?  Please 
oh please!</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
You didn't even refrigerate it you spineless 
lobster!</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
You had to drag spines into this!</speak>

<info>He cries. Fry appears on the overhead monitors. He clears his 
throat.</info>

<speak who="FRY"><info>ON SCREEN</info>
As vice chairman of Planet Express I'd 
like to say a few words. There comes 
a time for every man who becomes rich 
and deserts his friends, when he goes 
back how it was. For me, that time is 
now....</speak>

<info>Cut to: Intergalactic Stock Exchange Business Centre. Fry turns 
to That Guy.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
...So I ask you, as a friend, won't 
you stop this deal?</speak>

<speak who="THAT GUY">
Fry I'm an 80's guy. Friendship means 
to me that for two bucks I'd beat you 
with a pool cue 'til you got detached 
retinas. The deal will go ahead as - 
My bones!</speak>

<info>The crowd gasps.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Oh my God! His boneitis!</speak>

<speak who="THAT GUY">
I was so busy being an 80's guy, I forgot 
to cure it.  My only regret is...that 
I have...boneitis!</speak>

<info>He stops twisting.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
He's dead.</speak>

<info>The crowd gasps.</info>

<speak who="MOM">
Pry out his fillings, feed him to the 
jackals and lets get on with the sale.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
I don't think so. 'Cause as vice chairman 
of the company I gain voting control 
of his shares.</speak>

<speak who="MOM">
Don't be a fool you idiot!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
I'll be whatever I wanna do! That Guy 
was the greatest businessman that ever 
lived and before his mysterious death 
he taught me everything he knew.  But 
some things I had to learn myself.  
I learned that money is fine but in 
the end what counts is people... ...People 
you love... ...You can't put a price 
on that... So I'm giving up control 
of the company... ...to a man of enourmous 
experience... ...Professor... ...Hubert 
Farnsworth.</speak>

<info>Farnsworth is still asleep but is now wearing a sleeping cap 
and bunny slippers. He wakes up.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Oh uh what? I'm awake, I'm awake!</speak>

<info>The stock price goes haywire. Tape falls from the ceiling an 
the Planet Express crew slide down on it.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Fry, stop doing the right thing you 
jerk!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Let Mom buy the company! We all wanna 
be filthy stinking rich!</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Trust me two out of three doesn't cut 
it!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
You mean you'd rather be rich than work 
together?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Hell yeah!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
In my whole life this company was the 
only place I ever really felt at home. 
If being millionaires is more important 
to you than our...</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
It is!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
...friendship, then I'll sell Planet 
Express, for you.</speak>

<speak who="HATTIE">
Millionaires nothing! The stock's only 
worth three kajiggers!</speak>

<info>The crew mumble.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Oh come on!</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
My Jah! It's worth less now than when 
it was worthless!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
It is? Yahoo! We're poor no matter what 
I do! The deal is off!</speak>

<info>He selects no and the Planet Express vote changes to 100% for 
No.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Aha! Once again the conservative sangwich-heavy 
portfolio pays off for the hungry investor! 
Oh! I'm ruined.  Why? Why?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Look, so we're not millionaires. At 
least we all still get to work together!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Shut your fat mouth!</speak>

<info>The crew walk out muttering.</info>

<speak who="FRY"><info>(SHOUTING)</info>
See you guys Monday!</speak>
