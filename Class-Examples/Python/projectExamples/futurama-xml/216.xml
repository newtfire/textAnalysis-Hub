<info>Planet Express: Lounge. Nibbler sits on Leela's lap and she 
picks tufts out of his fur. Bender does the same to Fry. Enter 
Hermes.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
Exciting news, people! The pet licence 
I requsitioned for Nibbler has arrived.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Hermes, that's sweet. I didn't know 
you cared about Nibbler.</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
Dream on, woman. I'd like to put the 
little bastard in a sack and toss the 
sack in a river and hurl the river into 
space. But I do like filling out requisitions 
and these were some doozies!  Great 
Jah's dreadlocks! There's been a mix-up. 
This isn't a pet licence, it's a fishing 
licence. And it's mandatory!</speak>

<info>The Planet Express ship takes off and heads out to sea. It stops 
a short while later and the cargo bay lift comes down with Bender, 
Fry and Farnsworth standing on it.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Ah! The exact centre of the Atlantic 
Ocean. This seems the logical place 
for fish to congregate.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
So we're in international waters?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Indeed so.</speak>

<info>Bender whips out a radio and talks into it.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Falcon, this is Blue Raven, the goose 
has nested. Repeat, the goose has nested. 
Hey, guess what you're accessories 
to?</speak>

<info>Time Lapse. On the roof of the ship, the crew pull out their 
fishing equipment from the gun turret.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
The sun, the sea air, good friends.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Leela's right, fishing blows. Whattya 
say we make it interesting?</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
Why not?</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
Yeah.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Yeah, cool.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Everybody kick in five bucks.  There, 
wasn't that interesting?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Bender!</speak>

<info>Fry chuckles.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
This contest is as good as over. I once 
caught a fish this big.</speak>

<info>He stretches out his arms.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Oh, yeah? I once caught a fish this 
big!</speak>

<info>He extends his arms the length of the ship. Leela opens a case.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
I'm afraid you're both out of your league, 
boys, 'cause you're looking at a woman 
who owns her own harpoon.</speak>

<info>She twists the top of the harpoon onto the bottom.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Harpoon, my ass!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
OK.</speak>

<info>And she does. He screams in pain and jumps into the water. Hermes 
looks at five buckets.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
Let's see now, which bait to use?  Crickets? 
Squid? Chicken necks?</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Excuse me, if I might be so bold, I'm 
willing to offer my services as a bait 
critic.  These sardines for example 
are bland and tasteless.  And these 
dry, stringy nightcrawlers, though juicy 
...  ... very very juicy--</speak>

<info>He sticks his head in the bucket and gobbles the bait.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
I don't believe this! It's eating my 
bait!  Beat it, you mooching crawdad!</speak>

<info>Zoidberg runs away and woops. Bender presses a button on his 
fishing rod.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Hey, Fry, check out my laser-guided 
fishing rod.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
<info>(whispering)</info> Quiet, Bender, you're scaring 
away the fish.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Fine. I'll head over to the other side. 
<info>(shouting)</info> Good luck fishing on this 
side!</speak>

<info>He walks away and Fry casts his line and chuckles.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
I can hit a fish between the eyes from 
20 yards!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Oh, yeah? I can hit a shrimp!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
A shrimp?  I find it a bit hard to believe 
that--</speak>

<info>Bender's line hits Fry between the eyes and knocks him over. 
Leela spins her harpoon around and sees something in the water.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Aha!  Gather round, chumps! I got the 
winner!</speak>

<info>An old boot comes out of the water on the end of the harpoon. 
Leela sighs.</info>

<speak who="AMY">
Oh, so this is where you shop for your 
boots?</speak>

<info>Fry reels in a little fish.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Couple more of those and you'll have 
yourself a fish stick!</speak>

<info>He laughs.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Hey, a fish this fine belongs in a fish 
nugget-style chunklet. And anyway, it's 
bigger than anything you've caught. 
Ow! My small intestine!</speak>

<info>Leela tries again with the harpoon.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Bingo! Whatever it is, it's 20 times 
heavier than a boot.</speak>

<info>She pulls out a crate marked "Boots 10 Pair" and sighs.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
You'll never catch anything with that 
primitive technology. What you need 
is this fish pheromone.  The most potent 
aphrodisiac known to fishkind.  Uh-oh!</speak>

<info>Several fish leap up to his head. He screams and knocks them 
off. Zoidberg comes up behind him and sniffs him.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
<info>(sexfully)</info> I'm so into you!</speak>

<info>He wraps his mouth flaps around Farnsworth's head and slurps.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Oh, my!</speak>

<info>Fry reels in his line. There is big fish attached to it.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
<info>(shouting)</info> Hey, Bender, I just caught 
a fish this big!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Quit exaggerating, Fry. Ah, screw this! 
If I'm not gonna catch a fish, I might 
as well not catch a big fish.  There. 
Like most of life's problems this one 
can be solved with bending.</speak>

<info>He ties the ships tether line to the hook.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Bender, be careful. That's the ships 
diamond filament tether. It's unbreakable.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Then why do I have to be careful?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
It belonged to my grandmother.</speak>

<info>Bender takes some food from Hermes' hands, attaches it to his 
hook and throws it into the sea.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
My manwich!</speak>

<info>Time Lapse. Dusk approaches. Fry is asleep in a chair with his 
rod next to him, Amy is asleep, Hermes is asleep with sign hanging 
around him saying he will be awake at 7pm. Bender snoozes, his 
door opening and closing. Leela casts her harpoon again.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Wake up, everyone! I've got something. 
And this time it's alive!  Dr. Zoidberg, 
since when do you even wear boots?</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
I wasn't wearing it. <info>(ashamed)</info> I was 
eating it.</speak>

<info>Leela sighs and lets go of the rope.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Come on, let's go home.</speak>

<info>Amy wakes up and screams.</info>

<speak who="AMY">
Sunburn! My fabulous body! It's ruined! 
What happened to my parasol?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
I don't know. It wasn't here when I 
took your umbrella.  What? I put sunblock 
on you.</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
Well it didn't work!</speak>

<info>She turns around and stomps off. On her back Bender has spelled 
out "Honk If Bender Is Great" in sunblock. He giggles.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Come on, Bender. Pull in your line and 
let's go.</speak>

<info>Bender tries to pull in the line.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Hey, I'm snagged.</speak>

<info>The line starts to whirr away.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
It's not snagged, the mechano man has 
caught something!  Sweet Zombie Jesus! 
It's huge!</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
It's coming up!</speak>

<info>A huge fish leaps up from the water and over the top of the 
ship. The staff gasp.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
Oh, that's big!</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
A colossal-mouth bass!</speak>

<info>The bass heads back under the water and the tether starts winding 
away.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
It's diving!</speak>

<info>The ship shakes and tilts forward.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
It's pulling us under! Everyone into 
the ship!</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Wait! I'll save us! By cutting the unbreakable 
diamond filament!  Well, at least I'll 
die with my friends. Hello?</speak>

<info>The others shut the turret door behind them and the water line 
creeps towards Zoidberg. He climbs in and shuts it behind him. 
The ship lurches forward and disappears under the water and the 
staff scream. Something floats to the surface.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
<info>(from ship)</info> My Speedos!</speak>

<info>Ships Cockpit. The room is glowing red and a klaxon beeps. Leela 
watches the depth gauge.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Depth at 45 hundred feet, 48 hundred, 
50 hundred! 5000 feet!</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Dear Lord, that's over 150 atmospheres 
of pressure.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
How many atmospheres can this ship withstand?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Well it's a spaceship, so I'd say anywhere 
between zero and one.</speak>

<info>The ships hull creaks around them.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
What's that? Is someone bending girders?</speak>

<info>More creaking. The depth gauge reaches 6000ft and breaks. Farnsworth's 
glasses break and so do Bender's eyes. He screws some new ones 
in.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
We'll be crushed if we don't equalise 
the pressure.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
How do we do that?</speak>

<info>Pipes burst around the room and the water floods in.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
That should do it.</speak>

<info>The water gets higher.</info>

<speak who="AMY">
We're all gonna die!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Wait, I'll be back in a minute.</speak>

<info>He takes off his jacket and swims under the water. A toilet 
flushes and the water level drops. The staff cheer and Fry walks 
back in, zipping up his shorts.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
You did it, Fry!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Did what?</speak>

<info>The ship hits some rocks and everyone is thrown across the room, 
screaming. The ship comes to a rest on the ocean floor. Bender 
looks out the window.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
People, it's far far worse than we thought; 
My fish got away.</speak>

<info>Ship Corridor. Bender fixes the electricity and the lights come 
back on, Leela mops the floor and Fry tapes up a crack in the 
hull.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
There, good as new! Except we're three 
miles below the surface, we don't have 
any food and the ship won't work underwater.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
<info>(restrained)</info> Tempers are wearing thin. 
Let's just hope some robot doesn't kill 
everybody.</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
The important thing is that we don't 
panic. There are rules for situations 
like this.  Now, the first order of 
business is lunch. I suggest a nice 
lobster Zoidberg, I mean lobster Newburg, 
I mean Doctor Zoidberg.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
OK, everyone, calm down. The Professor 
and I will get to work on the ship. 
Bender, Zoidberg, since you can survive 
underwater, you'll go out and look for 
food.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
I'd better go too. They don't know what 
I like.</speak>

<info>He opens the airlock.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
Fry, no! The pressure will crush you 
like a green snake under a sugarcane 
truck.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Not necessarily. This is chance for 
Fry to test out my experimental anti-pressure 
pill.</speak>

<info>He pulls out a huge black pill.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
I can't swallow that.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Well then good news! It's a suppository.</speak>

<info>Seabed. Fry, Bender and Zoidberg walks across the ocean floor. 
Fry holds a bag of air. Zoidberg picks up a fish and puts it 
Bender's chest cabinet.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
How are you doing there, Fry?  Glad 
to hear it.  Aha!</speak>

<info>He puts it in Bender's chest cabinet. Bender sees an electric 
eel and grabs it. It shocks him.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Aw, yeah!</speak>

<info>Zoidberg sees a little glowing thing.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Yum, yum, yum!  Uh-oh!  Look at me, 
I'm Dr. Zoidberg, homeowner!</speak>

<info>Time Lapse. The trio search for food next to a sunken wreck. 
Fry lifts a skull and crossbones flag.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Careful, Fry, I think that flag might 
be poisonous.</speak>

<info>Bender emerges from the boat wearing a pirate hat and an eyepatch 
and carrying some bottles.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Ahoy, mateys! I shanghaied us some hearty 
grub.  Arr! The laws o' science be a 
harsh mistress!</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Say, robot, old buddy? Could you help 
me move a couch?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Uh, OK, but I'm not carrying it upstairs.</speak>

<info>He climbs into the shell leaving Fry alone. Some seaweed parts, 
revealing a mermaid. She laughs and swims away and Fry blubbers. 
Zoidberg and Bender emerge from the shell.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
What is it, Fry?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
<info>(blubberling)</info> Mermaid.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
You want some lemonade? You saw a big 
parade?</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Your student loans have been repaid? 
Then how 'bout lending your old pal 
Zoidberg a few bucks, Mr Millionaire!</speak>

<info>Ships Mess. The crew are eating. Fry is still blubberling.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Fry, swallow your food. Then talk.</speak>

<info>Fry swallows.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
A mermaid!</speak>

<info>Amy laughs.</info>

<speak who="AMY">
You think you saw a mermaid?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
No, I did see a mermaid! She was wearing 
a tube top and she had a beautiful scaley 
tail. And I think she had hair extensions.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Yeah, right!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Sure she did.</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
OK, Fry!</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
You're simply hallucinating, you ... 
moron.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
What's so far-fetched about mermaids? 
I mean, there's all sorts of weird sea 
creatures here in the future. Like Dr. 
Zoidberg.</speak>

<info>He through the window at Zoidberg. He is wearing a sunhat and 
has built a window box on his shell and is landscaping a garden. 
He turns around and waves.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
I'm afraid Fry is suffering from ocean 
madness.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Every time something good happens to 
me you say it's some kind of madness, 
or I'm drunk, or I ate too much candy. 
Well I saw a real mermaid and I wish 
for once my friends would have decency 
and kindness to believe me.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
<info>(whispering)</info> Ocean madness.</speak>

<info>Fry storms out.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
He may have ocean madness but that's 
no excuse for ocean rudeness.</speak>

<info>Fry's And Bender's Quarters. Fry lies awake while Bender snores.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
<info>(muttering)</info> Ocean madness, yeah right. 
It's always something, ain't it?  <info>(talking)</info> 
It's her! Bender, wake up! She's here! 
Wake up!  Oh! oxygen!</speak>

<info>He picks up a suitcase.</info>

<info>Cut to: Seabed. Fry steps outside the airlock and closes the 
door behind him. His suitcase floats away and he screams. The 
mermaid puts something in his mouth.</info>

<speak who="MERMAID">
Here you go, darlin'.</speak>

<info>Fry breathes.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Hey! I can breath and talk, just like 
a fish!</speak>

<speak who="MERMAID">
Oh, you speak fish?</speak>

<info>She says something in fish.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
What?</speak>

<speak who="MERMAID">
I'm sorry, my accent's atrocious. Hi, 
my name's Umbriel!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
I'm Fry. So, uh, am I gonna drown?</speak>

<speak who="UMBRIEL">
Course not. Just stay calm and let the 
currents relax your every muscle.</speak>

<info>Fry relaxes.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Aw, yeah!</speak>

<speak who="UMBRIEL">
Did it just get warmer?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
I can't believe you're really real. 
I like your tail.</speak>

<speak who="UMBRIEL">
Oh, you're sweet. I like those wiggly 
doo-dads comin' outta your hips.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Oh, Thanks. They're called pants.</speak>

<info>Time Lapse. Fry and Umbriel sit next to a glowing vent.</info>

<speak who="UMBRIEL">
This here's a volcanic vent. The water 
comes out at over 4000 degrees.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
No kidding.</speak>

<info>He relaxes.</info>

<speak who="UMBRIEL">
Did it just get colder?  Tell me more 
about that bizarre land-y world you 
come from. Is there water there too?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Sure, sometimes it falls from the sky.</speak>

<speak who="UMBRIEL">
Hm.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
And sometimes it doesn't.</speak>

<info>She gasps.</info>

<speak who="UMBRIEL">
Oh, Mr. Fry! You do go on!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
You know what I like best about you, 
Umbriel? You find me fascinating even 
when I'm not claiming to be a jewel 
thief or a lion tamer.</speak>

<speak who="UMBRIEL">
Lions? There are sealions on the land?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Yup. We call them land-sealions ... 
I tame them!</speak>

<info>Montage: Fry and Umbriel date to Donovan's Atlantis. They watch 
a squid and whale fight, swim on the back of a flat fish and 
Fry spells out words to Umbriel with glowing fish. They look 
into each other's eyes and kiss.</info>

<info>Ships Galley. Bender reads The Atlantic Monthly while Leela, 
Amy and Hermes are gathered around something. Enter Farnsworth.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
I'm almost finish reconfiguring the 
ships propulsion system. We can leave 
as soon as the paper-m�ch� is dry.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Where's Fry?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
I didn't kill him. Professor?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
No, I've been busy.</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
He must've gone out looking for that 
mermaid. The poor demented honky.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
It's ocean madness alright. Sailors 
call it aqua dementia, the deep down 
crazies, the wet willies, the screaming 
moist!</speak>

<info>As she speaks the crew leave. Bender slams the door behind him.</info>

<info>Cut to: Ship Corridor. Leela joins the rest of them. Farnsworth 
opens the door to the airlock.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
We'll form a search party. Now, we'll 
need oxygen.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
I got it covered.  In the event of an 
emergency, my ass can be used as a floatation 
device.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Ooh, that reminds me: You've all taken 
your pressure pills, right?</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
Yes! Stop asking!</speak>

<info>Seabed. The crew stand outside the ship wearing their oxygen 
masks. Zoidberg sniffs around like a dog.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
I've got his scent! Over here where 
the water gets warmer. This way!</speak>

<info>The staff follow him across the seabed. They peek over a mound 
and gasp. Ahead of them is a city.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
<info>(awestruck)</info> Bend me!</speak>

<info>Amy says something in Chinese.</info>

<speak who="AMY">
Dude! An ancient sunken city!</speak>

<info>The crew look at a partly-obscured sign that reads "City Of 
Atl".</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Could it possibly be? Are the old legends 
true?  It is! It's the fabled lost city 
of Atlanta!</speak>

<speak who="MERMAN">
Howdy, y'all!</speak>

<info>City Of Atlanta. The crew are greated by another merman.</info>

<speak who="COLONEL">
Welcome to Atlanta. Folks round these 
parts call me the Colonel.  Here, have 
some breathers, courtesy of our Chamber 
of Commerce.</speak>

<info>He hands them the same breathing gear Umbriel gave Fry earlier. 
They put them in.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
This is uncomfortable and humiliating. 
Now, if they could put it in the form 
of a suppository.</speak>

<speak who="COLONEL">
Y'all enjoy your stay! Tourism's our 
main source of income round here so 
see the sights, spend some money. Please 
don't leave!</speak>

<info>Fry and Umbriel come out of Krispy Kreme.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Fry! Oh, I just knew you were still 
alive! <info>(whispering)</info> I owe you 10 bucks, 
Hermes!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Hey, you guys, the most amazing thing 
happened. It's two-for-one Tuesday at 
Krispy Kreme! Plus there's mermaids.</speak>

<speak who="COLONEL">
Nice out of town folks, I'd like you 
to meet my daughter, Umbriel. Umbriel, 
these are some Yankees.</speak>

<info>Time Lapse. The staff, Umbriel and the Colonel wander around 
the city.</info>

<speak who="AMY">
So, Fry, Atlanta was an American city 
in your time?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
I think it was just an airport. They 
had a place where you could buy nuts.</speak>

<speak who="UMBRIEL">
No! Ancient Atlanta was more than just 
a Delta hub. It was a vibrant metropolis, 
the equal of Paris or New York.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
That's right, honey! Whatever you say.</speak>

<speak who="UMBRIEL">
Look at these fabulous ruins. Turner 
Field, the Coca-Cola bottling plant, 
the, uh, the airport.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
But tell us: How could a city with such 
a ... fabulous airport, end up underwater?</speak>

<speak who="COLONEL">
Ah, now that's a story that can only 
rightly be told in a Chamber of Commerce 
video narrated by folk-rock trubadour 
Donovan.</speak>

<info>He presses a button and Donovan appears on the screen and strums 
the tune to Atlantis with slightly different lyrics.</info>

<speak who="DONOVAN">
Atlanta was a city, landlocked, hundreds 
of miles from the area we now call the 
Atlantic Ocean,

Yet so desperate the city's desire for tourism that they moved 
offshore, becoming an island and an even bigger Delta hub,

</speak><info>On the screen, helicopters lift the city and land it in the 
ocean. The scene changes to years later. The island is packed 
with buildings.</info>

Until the city over-developed and it started to sink,

Knowing their fate, the quality people ran away,

Ted Turner, Hank Aaron, Jeff Foxworthy, the guy who invented 
Coca-Cola, the magician and the other so-called gods of our legends,

Though gods they were -- and also Jane Fonda was there.

<info>A boat with the people on pulls away and the city sinks.</info>

The others chose to remain behind on their porches with their 
rifles, and one day evolve into mermaids, and sing and dance 
and ring in the new.

<speak who="MERMAIDS">
Hail Atlanta!</speak>

<info>The video ends.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
The magician?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Wouldn't it take millions 
of years to evolve into mermaids?</speak>

<speak who="UMBRIEL">
Normally, yes, but the caffine really 
sped things up.  That stuff's wonderful.</speak>

<info>Colonel's House. The staff are seated around a dining table 
with the Colonel and Umbriel.</info>

<speak who="COLONEL">
So when Umbriel first brought home this 
carpet bagger, I was again' it. But, 
damnit, if old legs here ain't grown 
on me!</speak>

<info>He pats Fry on the back.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Aw, shucks, Colonel.</speak>

<info>He spits tobacco and the spitoon dings.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
Well, it's all very nice here but we 
should be going. I miss me wife and 
me oxygen.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Yes, we all miss our loved ones and 
gases. Come on, Fry.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Wait. I'm not going with you.</speak>

<info>Everyone gasps.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
But, Fry, what about us? What about 
your life on the surface? You don't 
belong down here.</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
She's right, I mean sure they got the 
Braves but it's a third-rate symphony.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Fry, you half-mad, half-insane maniac, 
be reasonable. Don't you realise that 
if you stay at this depth your body 
will permanently adapt to the pressure?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Realise it? I don't even understand 
it!</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
It means you'll never be able to return 
to the surface.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
I don't care. I'm staying. I've got 
everything I want right here.</speak>

<info>He hugs Umbriel.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
<info>(shouting)</info> I'm bored! Let's go!</speak>

<info>Outside Colonel's House. On the porch Fry shakes hands with 
his old friends as they leave.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
You know, Fry, I've got a little place 
just outside town. You could come visit, 
maybe?</speak>

<info>Fry looks at the Colonel who shakes his head.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Sorry, Zoidberg. I'm trying to join 
the country club.</speak>

<info>Bender hugs Fry.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
<info>(crying)</info> Oh, Fry!  I'll miss you!</speak>

<info>He leaves and the Colonel waves.</info>

<speak who="COLONEL">
Y'all come back now, y'hear?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
<info>(shouting)</info> Let's go, damnit! Let's go!</speak>

<info>Ships Airlock. Farnsworth opens the door and the crew walk in. 
Zoidberg stops outside.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Well, I guess this is goodbye for me 
as well.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Whatever.</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
Later.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Bye.</speak>

<info>Cut to: Seabed. Zoidberg turns away sadly and the door closes 
behind him. He screams. His shell is a burned ruin.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
No! My home! It burned down!  <info>(crying)</info> 
How did this happen?</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
That's a very good question.</speak>

<info>Bender picks something up.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
So that's where I left my cigar.</speak>

<info>He smokes it.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
That just raises further questions!</speak>

<info>Umbriel's Bedroom. Fry and Umbriel sit on her bed.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
You know, Umbriel, these last 24 hours 
have been the happiest days of my life.</speak>

<speak who="UMBRIEL">
Oh, Fry! I want you to make a mer-woman 
outta mer-me.</speak>

<info>She gets under the sheet and her top floats away.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Mercy! I do believe I'm gettin' the 
vapours!</speak>

<info>He tears his clothes off and dives under the sheets. He and 
Umbriel kiss and her tail flaps around.</info>

<speak who="UMBRIEL">
What the hell is that?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Yeah I'm a little confused too. How 
do I ... y'know ... with the tail and 
all?</speak>

<speak who="UMBRIEL">
I'm not your first am I? I mean, I-I 
lay my eggs and leave and you release 
your fertiliser.</speak>

<info>Outside Colonel's House. Fry runs away from the house.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
<info>(gasping)</info> Why couldn't she be the other 
type of mermaid, with the fish part 
on top and the lady part on the bottom?</speak>

<info>The Colonel and Umbriel open the door.</info>

<speak who="UMBRIEL">
Now who's gonna escort me to the Debutante 
Ball?</speak>

<speak who="COLONEL">
Well what about that rich young dugong 
from Macon?</speak>

<info>Ships Cockpit.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
There! The engine modifications are 
complete.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Prepare for launch.</speak>

<info>Cut to: Seabed. The ship takes off from the rocky bed. The engine 
has been modified to flap around like a fish tail. Fry misses 
the ship.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Wait! Wait for me! Don't leave me here!</speak>

<info>He sees Bender's fish hook and chases it. He leaps up and grabs 
it and it pulls him upwards. The giant bass swims up behind him, 
he screams and the bass eats him.</info>

<info>Port. The bass is hanging from a giant set of scales. Mayor 
Poopenmeyer, photographers and other people are crowded around 
Bender.</info>

<speak who="POOPENMEYER">
And so, in honour of his record-breaking 
catch, I'm proud to award Bender this 
cheque for $1000.</speak>

<info>He shakes Bender's hand and photographers take photos. The crowd 
cheers. The bass spits out Fry followed by Hermes' manwich.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
It's you!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Hey, buddy!</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
My manwich!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Fry, are you alright? What happened?</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
What about Umbriel?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Well, it turns out I loved her, but 
I wasn't in love with her.</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
<info>(whispering)</info> Trouble in bed.</speak>

<info>Leela nods.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Ah, it's great to have you back, buddy.</speak>

<info>He puts his arms around Fry. Poopenmeyer looks at the scales.</info>

<speak who="POOPENMEYER">
Wait a-- This is no record! Gimmie back 
that cheque! I'm giving it to some giant 
orphans.</speak>

<info>He snatches the cheque from Bender. Fry starts struggling.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Ow! Bender, you're hurting me. Ow!</speak>

<info>He chokes. The bass' gills open. Zoidberg is inside.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Hey! I'm trying to sleep in here!</speak>

<info>THE END</info>
