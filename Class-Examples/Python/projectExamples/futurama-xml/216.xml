                         Exciting news, people! The pet licence 
                         I requsitioned for Nibbler has arrived.

                         Hermes, that's sweet. I didn't know 
                         you cared about Nibbler.

                         Dream on, woman. I'd like to put the 
                         little bastard in a sack and toss the 
                         sack in a river and hurl the river into 
                         space. But I do like filling out requisitions 
                         and these were some doozies!  Great 
                         Jah's dreadlocks! There's been a mix-up. 
                         This isn't a pet licence, it's a fishing 
                         licence. And it's mandatory!

                         Ah! The exact centre of the Atlantic 
                         Ocean. This seems the logical place 
                         for fish to congregate.

                         I think it was just an airport. They

                         No! Ancient Atlanta was more than just 
                         a Delta hub. It was a vibrant metropolis,
