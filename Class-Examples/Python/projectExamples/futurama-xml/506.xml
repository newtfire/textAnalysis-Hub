                         right up!" This sounds too good to be 
                         true I thought. He said I looked like 
                         a smart young man. "So is it a deal?" 
                         I enquired. Two hours later he was gone, 
                         with 60 of my dollars. But I have the 
                         miracle cream...

                         Thank you mysterious heroes. The value 
                         of the Gemerald you saved is slightly 
                         greater than the cost of the damage 
                         you caused to this museum. A net gain

                         But, should superheroes commit crime? 
                         Even to save lives? I need moral guidance. 
                         Bender?

                         Hmm, the thought of stealing anythig 
                         fills Superking with disgust. But if 
                         it must be so, then let a museum heist 
                         be pulled!
