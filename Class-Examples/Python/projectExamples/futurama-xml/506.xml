<info>Planet Express: Meeting Room. Leela dials the videophone and 
it connects. The SewerCom logo appears on the screen.</info>

<speak who="SEWERCOM ANNOUNCER">
<info>(Pleasant Female Voice)</info> Your call is 
being <info>(Gruff Alien Voice)</info> connected 
<info>(Pleasant Female Voice)</info> by SewerCom 
- Reach out and touch the sewers.</speak>

<info>Leela's parents, Morris and Munda, appear on the screen.</info>

<speak who="MUNDA"><info>ON SCREEN</info>
Look Morris, it's Leela calling.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Hi Mom, hi Dad! Ready for your big trip 
to the surface?</speak>

<speak who="MORRIS"><info>ON SCREEN</info>
We're excited honey but we don't wanna 
embarrass you. I mean your mother and 
I are basically monsters.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Dad, relax. You are being so mutant!</speak>

<speak who="MUNDA"><info>ON SCREEN</info>
I found this adorable little bag to 
wear over my head.  And it was on sale!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
No one's wearing anything adorable over 
their head. Now listen, I could never 
ever be ashamed of my parents. I'll 
see you this weekend.</speak>

<info>Planet Express: Lounge. Zoidberg, Bender and Fry have a game 
of poker at the table while Hermes and Amy relax on the sofa. 
Enter Leela.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Hey, guess who I just got off the videophone 
with?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
No.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
My parents! They're coming up from the 
sewers for a visit Sunday.</speak>

<info>Everyone gasps and reacts in horror.</info>

<speak who="AMY">
Are you off your rocket? Your parents 
are mutants. It's illegal for them to 
come above ground 'cause they're inferior 
genetic scum..uh present company excluded 
of course!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
I'm getting them a special one-day surface 
permit from Citihall.</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
Ooo, while you're there, could you pick 
me up a licence to kill?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Sure. Bare hands or weapon?</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
Uh, what does piano wire count as?</speak>

<info>Enter Farnsworth.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Good news anyone, the Swedish robot 
from pi-kea is here with the supercollider 
I ordered.

    </speak><speak who="PI-KEA ROBOT">
Enjoy your affordable Swedish crap!</speak>

<info>As it rolls out, one of it's wheels falls off and it's shelf 
breaks. Fry, Leela and Bender open the box. Fry picks up the 
instructions.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Let's see what tools we'll need.  Uh-huh, 
Uh-huh,  Uh-huh! Alright, we're all 
set.</speak>

<info>Bender takes a board out of the box and puts it down.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Nothing like the rustic wholesomeness 
of working with one's own hand.</speak>

<info>His hand starts spinning like a circular saw and he cuts the 
board in half.</info>

<info>Time Lapse. Fry and Leela tighten the last nut with Bender.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Ah, there, finished. And with only six 
missing pieces!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Those Swedes sure know how to put in 
almost everything you need.</speak>

<info>Leela rubs her arm.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Man, I'm sore all over. I feel like 
I just went ten rouns with Mighty Thor.</speak>

<info>Fry rubs his shoulder.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
I feel like I was mauled by Jesus.</speak>

<info>Planet Express: Zoidberg's Office. Zoidberg rummages through 
a cupboard and produces a tube of ointment.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
I've got just the thing, genuine miracle 
cream I bought from a travelling salesman. 
"Come one come all," he said, "Step 
right up!" This sounds too good to be 
true I thought. He said I looked like 
a smart young man. "So is it a deal?" 
I enquired. Two hours later he was gone, 
with 60 of my dollars. But I have the 
miracle cream...</speak>

<info>The wall explodes and a charred Farnsworth tumbles through it 
and lands in a crumpled heap on the other side of the room.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Bad news nobody, the supercollider super-exploded. 
I need you to take it back and exchanged 
it for a wobbly CD rack and some of 
those ransid meatballs.</speak>

<info>He climbs back through the hole.</info>

<info>Street. Leela and Fry tow the pi-kea box on a trolley when a 
mugger steps out in front of them with his hat covering something 
in his hand.</info>

<speak who="MUGGER">
Excuse me? Hi! Do you have a minute? 
I live in Jersey City and my car broke 
down and I need to get back because 
my Aunt's real sick and she needs this 
medicine but I need money for the bus. 
So I'm mugging you. Hand over your wallets.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
I don't believe that story for a second.</speak>

<speak who="MUGGER">
It doesn't matter, I'm mugging you.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
There's no bus to Jersey City.</speak>

<speak who="MUGGER">
Give me your wallets now or my robot'll 
shoot.</speak>

<info>He pulls his hat off his hand, revealing a small robot names 
Andrew with a gun.</info>

<speak who="ANDREW">
Don't make me hurt you.</speak>

<info>Fry and Leela shriek. Fry fumbles for his wallet.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
I'm too scared to find my pocket. Here, 
I'll just take of my pants and give 
you those.</speak>

<info>He starts to unzip them. The mugger cringes and puts his hand 
to his face.</info>

<speak who="MUGGER">
Hey! I don't like what I'm seeing. Give 
it to him Andrew!  Give it to him again 
Andrew!  What the...? Laser proof shirts 
huh? I'll show you.</speak>

<info>He picks up a pipe and hits Leela with it. It harmlessly bends 
as it hits her.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
What the? Hey! Quit it!  Heyya!</speak>

<info>She grabs the mugger between her legs, spins him around and 
throws him against a wall.</info>

<speak who="MUGGER">
Foiled. And after years of planning.</speak>

<speak who="ANDREW">
You're outta the game!</speak>

<info>Planet Express: Hangar. Fry sits on the steps while Leela paces 
around.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
How did we manage to survive? What gave 
us those strange powers?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Maybe we're all wearing magic rings 
but they're invisible rings so we don't 
even realise it. Also you can't feel 
the rings.</speak>

<info>Leela picks up Zoidberg's miracle cream and rubs some on her 
neck. She reads something on the tube and gasps.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Fry, shut up and look at this! <info>(Reading)</info> 
May cause superpowers in humans!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Wow! A superpowers drug you can just 
rub into your skin? You'd think it'd 
be something you have to freebase.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Let's see, which powers do we have? 
Super-strength?</speak>

<info>Fry karate chops a table in half and Leela kicks a hole in the 
wall.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Yup.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Uh-huh. Lickety speed?</speak>

<info>The both run very fast to the other end of the hangar.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Check.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Yes sir!  Ability to command a loyalty 
of sea creatures?</speak>

<speak who="FRY"><info>(SHOUTING)</info>
Hey Zoidberg, get in here!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Ain't got that.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Nope!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Wow, superpowers! I'll be able to pack 
my day with twice as many humdrum activity.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Leela, I think you're missing the big 
picture. When you were a kid what was 
your biggest fantasy?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
To have parents.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Whatever. The correct answer is: To 
be a superhero. We have superpowers 
and we're Americans. This is our chance.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Hmm, I have been looking for a way to 
serve the community that incorporates 
my violence. Let's do it!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
You'll barely regret this!</speak>

<info>Enter Bender.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Hey, a friend of mine said he mugged 
you today and you had superpowers.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
It's true. Thanks to this funky fresh 
cream.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Now me and Leela are forming an awesome 
crime-fighting duo.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Wow, crime-fighting. Cool. You say you're 
a duo? Yeah duos are good. Of course 
sometimes they're a little short handed. 
See ya. With two humans you'd think 
there'd be a robot in there...to balance 
things out. But, whatever.  I have these 
three costumes you could use. But, I 
guess I'll just throw one away.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
We'd love to have you on the team Bender. 
But aren't you more on the supply side 
of crime?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Plus the cream won't give you superpowers, 
you're a robot.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
So? I'm already super-strong. And my 
arms do this.  Also I got this going.</speak>

<info>His cabinet door opens and closes by itself. Fry and Leela shrug 
at each other.</info>

<info>Planet Express: Roof. The trio, in their superhero garb, stand 
on the roof looking across New New York.</info>

<speak who="LEELA"><info>(SHOUTING)</info>
Listen up New New York! There's a new 
group of superheros in town! And we're 
-</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
<info>(shouting)</info> Sorry! <info>(whispering)</info> A new 
era of justice has begun.</speak>

<info>In a similar style to old superhero TV series', we see crime 
happening across the city. A narrator fills us in on who is going 
to stop this crime...</info>

<info>The scene changes to a backdrop with The New Justice Team's 
logo on it. Fry bursts through it.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Captain Yesterday!</speak>

<info>Leela bursts through.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Clobberella!</speak>

<info>Bender bursts through and pushes Leela aside.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
And Superking! The best one of the three!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Wow!</speak>

<info>Scenes: Park. The New Justice Team's theme tune starts playing 
and the scene cuts to a park where Petunia is sitting on a bench 
feeding some rats. A thief snatches her bag.</info>

<speak who="SONG">
Go Go New Justice Team,</speak>

<info>Captain Yesterday swoops in front of the thief.</info>

>Go team, go team, team team team,

<info>The thief dodges him and heads for a travel tube.</info>

Who's the newest Justice Team,

The New Justice Team!

<info>Captain Yesterday runs along the top of the tube. The thief 
looks up and sees him and Captain Yesterday follows him underwater.</info>

Captain Yesterday is fast,

Also he is from the past,

Not just fast but from the past...

He runs ahead to the end of the tube.]

...Captain Yesterday!

<info>Captain Yesterday turns the tube towards a police station and 
the thief flies out and into it. Superking takes Petunia's bag.</info>

Superking has the power,

'Cause all the kings have all the power,

All the power of Superman,

Also he's a robot, ain't it cool?

Superking you rule!

<info>Scenes: Street. Clobberella looks down from a rooftop and sees 
an alien's cat is stuck up a tree.</info>

<speak who="SONG">
Clobberella beats you up,

Clobberella beats you up!

Who does she beat up?

You!

<info>Clobberella brings the cat safely down from the tree and hands 
it to the alien. The alien eats it.</info>

Clobberella!</speak>

<info>Scenes: Rooftops. The New Justice Team jump from rooftop to 
rooftop.</info>

<speak who="SONG">
Citizens never fear,

Crazy do-good freaks are here,

Until they run out of steam...

</speak><info>Fry and Leela fall from a rooftop into a bin.</info>

...Miracle cream, miracle cream,

Gives the power to the team!

<info>Clobberella takes the miracle cream out of her boot and she 
and Captain Yesterday rub it on themselves and spring back into 
action.</info>

It's effects wear off for sure,

So they just slop on some more.

The New Justice Team!

<info>Bender lands in front of them.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Ta-da!</speak>

<info>Street. A crook is put into the back of a police van. Crowds 
cheer the New Justice Team.</info>

<speak who="WOMAN"><info>(SEXFULLY)</info>
Captain Yesterday, I find your skintight 
highwaters incredibly sexy! Let's get 
together sometime!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Sure. I'm listed in the phone book so 
once I reveal my real name to you along 
with my home address and a copy of my 
birth certificate -</speak>

<info>Leela pulls him away from the woman.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Are you crazy?? We have to keep our 
secret identities secret.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
From everybody?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Especially from everybody.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Give several reasons why.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
For one, superheroes cause a lot of 
collateral damage, and we don't wanna 
get our butts sued.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Or do we...? No I guess not.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Also, if our identities get out, every 
crook in the city will be after us. 
Or, God forbid, our loved ones.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Superking has no need for loved ones. 
How ya doin' kid?</speak>

<info>Mayor's Office. Mayor Poopenmeyer signs the permits for Leela.</info>

<speak who="POOPENMEYER">
There you go. Two one-day mutant surface 
passes.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Thank you Mayor Poopenmeyer.</speak>

<info>Poopenmeyer's phone rings.</info>

<speak who="POOPENMEYER">
Mayor here...what's that? Horrible crime 
in the works? Ruthless villain? Citizens 
in danger? That's fantastic news!  Because 
I get to summon The New Justice Team!</speak>

<info>He presses the nose on a clown picture. Bender's antenna wobbles. 
He clasps his hands around it.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Shh!</speak>

<speak who="POOPENMEYER">
Uh, they're usually here by now.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Well, so long. Keep in touch.</speak>

<info>They start to leave.</info>

<speak who="POOPENMEYER">
Wait, stay and meet the superheroes. 
There's three of you and three of them 
so it'll be perfect.  Is this clown 
on? Where are those daring crimestoppers?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Oh, I completely forgot, I left my apartment 
on fire!</speak>

<info>She leaves.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Uh, as for me, I'm late for my LSAT's.</speak>

<info>He leaves.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
And I can't take life anymore.</speak>

<info>He runs and jumps through the window and flies back through 
another one as Captain Yesterday. Clobberella and Superking run 
in on the other side of the room.</info>

<speak who="POOPENMEYER">
Clobberella! Captain Yesterday! My liege! 
You're just in time!  We've received 
a tip that the Museum of Natural History 
will be robbed tomorrow at exactly 9am. 
The target: The priceless Quantum Gemerald!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Who's the perp?</speak>

<info>The hologram changes.</info>

<speak who="POOPENMEYER">
A dangerous villain know as The Zookeeper, 
who commits crimes aided by a pack of 
highly trained animals.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Pack of highly. Got it!</speak>

<speak who="POOPENMEYER">
His crew includes a badger with a troubled 
past and nothing left to lose, an elephant 
who never forgets - to kill! And a seldom 
used crab named Lucky aka Citizen Snips.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
You can count on us Mr Mayor! Justice 
away!</speak>

<info>She and Fry runs out with Bender gasping and puffing behind 
them.</info>

<speak who="BENDER"><info>(GASPING)</info>
Hold the elevator!</speak>

<info>Planet Express: Restroom. Leela addresses an envelope to her 
parents and puts the surface passes in. Then she flushes it down 
the toilet.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
We're in here too.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Uh, Leela, how you gonna meet your folks 
tomorrow? We've already scheduled the 
Zookeeper for a 9am foiling at the museum.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Not a problem. I've cleverly arranged 
to meet my parents right there at the 
same museum at 10.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
9, 10 a big fat hen.  The name...Bender!</speak>

<info>Museum Of Natural History. People go about their business in 
the museum whilst The New Justice Team sit atop a giant ant which 
is suspended from the ceiling.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
I can't believe the Zookeeper is this 
late for his own heist. It's just rude! 
Total hell! It's 10! I'm supposed to 
meet my parents and I'm still in my 
secret costume!  There they are!</speak>

<info>Morris and Munda look around, disappointed.</info>

<speak who="MUNDA">
How could Leela not be here? Do you 
think she forgot?</speak>

<speak who="MORRIS">
Relax. I'm sure she's just ashamed of 
us.</speak>

<speak who="SECURITY GUARD">
Yo! Freakjobs! Hit the nearest manhole! 
Pronto like.</speak>

<speak who="MORRIS">
But we have passes that allow us to 
be up here. From the mayor himself.</speak>

<info>Munda hands the passes to the security guard.</info>

<speak who="SECURITY GUARD">
I dunno...I never heard of no mayor.</speak>

<info>Enter the Zookeeper.</info>

<speak who="RANDY">
The Zookeeper!</speak>

<speak who="ZOOKEEPER">
Sorry I'm late, long story. Now everybody 
hit the deck! I'm cutting the entire 
line and stealing the exhibit.</speak>

<info>The New Justice Team drop to the floor in front of him.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
You're not stealing anything! Nobody 
hit the deck!</speak>

<speak who="ZOOKEEPER">
Ah, superheroes! Or should I say superzeroes!</speak>

<speak who="FRY"><info>(SADLY)</info>
That was uncalled for.</speak>

<speak who="ZOOKEEPER">
Animals, attack.</speak>

<info>He blows a silent whistle and animal exhibits come to life and 
break out of the glass cases. They run rampage.</info>

<speak who="TOUR GUIDE">
Please to not feed the animals!</speak>

<info>An elephant picks her up and eats her. In a scene lifted from 
Batman The New Justice Team spring into action. A yak charges 
towards Fry and he punches it. YAK!. Bender picks a fight with 
a boxing kangaroo.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
You're going down my friend! Down Under!</speak>

<info>He laughs. The kangaroo punches him. 01001010!!!</info>

<speak who="TEDDY ROOSEVELT">
Man boxing a kangaroo is a peculiar 
spectacle. But a kangaroo boxing a robot? 
Now I'm afraid you've lost me!  <info>(shouting)</info> 
Citizen Snips!</speak>

<info>The Zookeeper lifts a grate and pushes a snake through the hole. 
The snake reaches into the Quantum Gemerald's case and takes 
it.</info>

<speak who="ZOOKEEPER">
Nice job Fingers!</speak>

<info>He kisses it.</info>

<speak who="MUNDA">
I'm scared and confused. I think we've 
wandered into an off-Broadway play.</speak>

<speak who="MORRIS">
No there are way too many people here.</speak>

<info>The Zookeeper runs up a flight of stairs.</info>

<speak who="ZOOKEEPER">
Later, if anyone asks how I got away, 
tell them right now!</speak>

<info>Clobberella and Captain Yesterday leap in front of him.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Forget it Zookeeper! You're going into 
captivity!</speak>

<speak who="ZOOKEEPER">
Fool! A quip without putting me behind 
bars would have been far more delicious! 
Here catch!</speak>

<info>He throws the Gemerald over the side of the stairs. Fry leaps 
for it and goes over the edge too.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
No, Fry you can't fall fast enough!</speak>

<info>She runs down the stairs while the Zookeeper runs off in another 
direction. Bender hold out his arms at the bottom of the staircase.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
I got it I got it!  I don't got it!</speak>

<info>Leela dives in front of him and catches the Gemerald. Fry falls 
on top of Bender. Everyone cheers.</info>

<speak who="TEDDY ROOSEVELT">
You've saved the Gemerald!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Yet the Zookeeper escaped. Thus proving 
that the deadliest animal of all is 
the Zookeeper!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
You can get off me anytime.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Oh no! My parents are leaving! I've 
gotta go change back into street-Leela.</speak>

<info>She turns to leave but Mayor Poopenmeyer and several photographers 
block her path.</info>

<speak who="POOPENMEYER">
Thank you mysterious heroes. The value 
of the Gemerald you saved is slightly 
greater than the cost of the damage 
you caused to this museum. A net gain 
for our great city!</speak>

<info>The crowd cheers and Poopenmeyer kisses Bender's hand. People 
take photographs. Leela looks around sadly.</info>

<info>Outside Museum Of Natural History. Morris sets some cones out 
by a manhole.</info>

<speak who="MUNDA">
It's good that Leela doesn't love us. 
She'll be less sad when we die.</speak>

<info>Morris lifts the manhole cover and helps Munda into it. He climbs 
in after her, takes the cones and replaces the cover. Leela comes 
out of the museum just as they disappear.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Mom? Dad? I showed up! And I got the 
audio tour for Treasures Of Liberachi's 
Tomb!</speak>

<info>She looks around and sighs. She sits down on the step and cries.</info>

<info>Turanga House. Leela is with her parents.</info>

<speak who="MORRIS">
Sweetie, it's OK. You don't have to 
apologise for standing us up on the 
only visit to the surface we'll ever 
have.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
I wanna tell you why I didn't show up. 
But I can't. Just please believe me 
that it was a very good reason. I'm 
sorry I disappointed you.</speak>

<speak who="MUNDA">
Leela, you could never disappoint us.</speak>

<speak who="MORRIS">
We're so proud of everything that you 
are. And we always will be. You're our 
baby girl.</speak>

<info>They both smile.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Oh, I can't take it! Mom, Dad, I'm Clobberella!</speak>

<info>She rips her clothes off revealing her Clobberella outfit. Munda 
gasps.</info>

<speak who="MORRIS">
Galloping gators!</speak>

<speak who="MUNDA">
You're a superhero?  Well that's wonderful! 
But did you have to make the costume 
so revealing?</speak>

<info>Morris puts his arm around Leela.</info>

<speak who="MORRIS">
Look at me! Proud dad of a superhero! 
We should print up T-Shirts! And F-Shirts 
for our friends with two arms on the 
same side!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
No, listen. It's very important that 
you never ever tell anyone. Under any 
circumstance.</speak>

<speak who="MORRIS">
What if I've had a few?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Dad, you drink? No. Not even then.</speak>

<speak who="MORRIS">
Alright. My sucker is sealed.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
In fact, I shouldn't even be wearing 
this around here.  It was brisk, I dressed 
in layers.</speak>

<speak who="MUNDA">
That's my girl!</speak>

<info>Lake Mutagenic. Morris, Raoul and the Leg Mutant sit in a boat 
fishing.</info>

<speak who="MORRIS">
So uh, anyway, my daughter's Clobberella.</speak>

<speak who="RAOUL">
Leela is Clobberella?</speak>

<speak who="LEG MUTANT">
You're pulling me!</speak>

<speak who="MORRIS">
Shh, keep it under your sock. It's a 
big secret. That's why I'm only telling 
you two.</speak>

<info>Cut to: Shore Of Lake Mutagenic. A big eared mutant and a big 
mouthed mutant overhear.</info>

<speak who="BIG EARED MUTANT">
Oh my God! That guy's daughter is Clobberella! 
But don't tell anyone.</speak>

<speak who="BIG MOUTHED MUTANT">
Gotcha!</speak>

<info>Planet Express: Meeting Room. Farnsworth, Fry, Leela and Bender 
sit around the table. The Zookeeper appears on the screen.</info>

<info>Fry, Leela and Bender gasp.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
I don't remember much buddy, and you're 
no looker!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Uh Professor, isn't it time for your 
nap?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Yes dammit!</speak>

<info>He falls asleep. His chair flies out of the room.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Zookeeper! How did you know our real 
identities?</speak>

<info>He claps and a parrot lands on his shoulder.</info>

<speak who="PARROT"><info>ON SCREEN</info>
Leela told her parents. Leela's parents 
blabbed.</speak>

<info>The Zookeeper gives it a cracker.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Leela, is the person that parrot is 
mimicking telling the truth by proxy?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA"><info>(SADLY)</info>
Yes. My parents were so hurt, I couldn't 
help it! <info>(angry)</info> But I distinctly told 
them not to tell anyone.</speak>

<info>Bender puts on his Superking crown.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
We are not amused.</speak>

<info>He claps and gorilla comes in pulling a cage. In the cage are 
Leela's parents. Leela gasps.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Mom! Dad!</speak>

<speak who="MUNDA"><info>ON SCREEN</info>
Leela please forgive us! Especially 
your father who's the one who told thank 
you very much Morris.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Are you alright? Has he hurt you?</speak>

<speak who="MORRIS"><info>ON SCREEN</info>

Even to save lives? I need moral guidance. 
Bender?</speak>

Hmm, the thought of stealing anythig 
fills Superking with disgust. But if 
it must be so, then let a museum heist 
be pulled!</speak>

<speak who="MUNDA">
We're just happy to be involved in your 
life.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
No no, it's my fault for telling you 
I was a superhero.</speak>

<speak who="MORRIS">
That's true.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
I just couldn't stand to have you to 
think I was ashamed of you.</speak>

<speak who="MUNDA">
That's OK sweetie, but, it's natural 
for children to be a little ashamed 
of their parents.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Oh yeah!</speak>

<speak who="MORRIS">
Just like it's natural for parents to 
be a little disappointed in their children...n-not

<speak who="LEELA">
