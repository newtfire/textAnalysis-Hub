               <note>Ship's Cockpit. The ship streaks away from Earth and Leela casually 
               hums to herself whilst Fry monitors the controls. The ship suddenly 
               shakes and the two are thrown to the floor. An alarm wails and 
               two ships fly past and prepare to turn around. Leela gasps.</note>

                         I'm going too fast. I've gotta lose

                         Well, there is perhaps one way. Have

                         They are an ancient order who believe 
                         God exists in the depths of space. They 
                         have built the universe's most powerful 
                         radio telescope, high in the Himalayas, 
                         to search for him.

                         Bender, being God isn't easy, if you 
                         do too much, people get dependent. And 
                         if you do nothing, they lose hope. You 
                         have to use a light touch, like a safecracker 
                         or a pickpocket.

                         Oh no the monks. We forgot to let them 
                         out of the laundry room.

                         Do we have to? I mean they're monks. 
                         I'm sure their God will let them out 
                         or at least give them more shoes to 
                         eat.

                         Fat chance. You can't count on God for 
                         jack. He pretty much told me so himself. 
                         Now come on. If we don't save those 
                         monks no one will!

                         When you do things right, people won't 
                         be sure you've done anything at all.
