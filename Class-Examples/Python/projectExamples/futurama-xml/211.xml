<info>Opening Credits. Caption: The Show That Watches Back.</info>

<info>Planet Express: Lounge. A show called Cop Department is on TV.</info>

<info>Fry, Bender and Leela sit slumped on the couch. The coffee table 
is filled with dishes, uneaten burgers and boxes of Chinese food. 
On the TV is a dazed centipede-like alien with a blurred face.</info>

<speak who="ALIEN"><info>ON TV</info>
C'mon man, I didn't fire off no laser.</speak>

<speak who="SMITTY"><info>ON TV</info>
Then why is there a smoking hole in 
your ceiling sir?</speak>

<info>The camera points to the ceiling.</info>

<speak who="ALIEN"><info>ON TV</info>
What? Crazy upstairs lady must've been 
shooting down.</speak>

<speak who="URL"><info>ON TV</info>
Sir, you're on the top floor of this 
particular domicile.</speak>

<info>The alien's wife walks in.</info>

<speak who="ALIEN">'S WIFE <info>ON TV</info>
You get that  camera out of my house!</speak>

<speak who="SMITTY"><info>ON TV</info>
Just relax ma'am.  Sir, sir, put down 
the lamp.</speak>

<info>The alien smashes the lamp.</info>

<speak who="ALIEN"><info>ON TV</info>
OK. OK, I'm co-operating.</speak>

<speak who="SMITTY"><info>ON TV</info>
That's it, now put up your hands.</speak>

<info>The alien puts it's 20 hands in the air and URL moves towards 
him, cuffs at the ready.</info>

<speak who="URL"><info>ON TV</info>
Nice and slow. Aww yeah!</speak>

<speak who="SMITTY"><info>ON TV</info>
And while you're at it, unblur your 
face.</speak>

<speak who="ALIEN"><info>ON TV</info>
Aw man.</speak>

<info>He unblurs his face. It wasn't a TV effect!</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Hey Bender, I thought you said you were 
in this episode.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Nah, this week I'm on Caught On Tape 
3 because of what I did in the coffee 
pot.</speak>

<info>Fry spits out his coffee. On the TV URL walks the alien out 
of the building.</info>

<speak who="ALIEN"><info>ON TV</info>
I'm sorry, I'm really sorry. I'm just 
going through some things.</speak>

<info>Smitty opens the car door but the alien head butts him and runs 
into some bushes. URL lifts up a shoe.</info>

<speak who="URL"><info>ON TV</info>
I'm goin' in.</speak>

<info>The Cop Department logo appears on the screen.</info>

<info>The picture changes to a traffic-packed New New York.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
<info>(tense and impatient)</info> Shut up and get 
to the point!</speak>

<info>A woman looks around the street.</info>

<speak who="WOMAN"><info>ON TV</info>
It's like stepping back stepping back 
into the year 2000!</speak>

<info>A cowboy riding a hover-moped and carrying a harpoon pulls up. 
More cowboys follow him.</info>

<speak who="COWBOY"><info>ON TV</info>
Time for the mammoth hunt dudes!</speak>

<info>They ride off and start attacking a robotic mammoth on the streets. 
It roars. A hot air balloon flies over head. Inside are actors 
playing Albert Einstein and Hammurabi, an ancient king of Babylonia 
who reigned around 2000BC, rather than AD.</info>

<speak who="EINSTEIN">
Let's disco dance Hammurabi!</speak>

<speak who="HAMMURABI">
Dy-no-mite!</speak>

<info>And they do. The Past-O-Rama logo appears on the screen, a play 
on the title logo of an unpopular cartoon series from the early 
21st century.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Sounds like your kinda place Fry. Wanna 
go?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Nah. If I ever wanna go back to the 
year 2000 I'll just freeze myself again.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
C'mon Fry, I really wanna see it. You 
know how I yearn for a simpler time. 
A time of barn dances and buggy rides, 
before life was cheapened by heartless 
hi-tech machines.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
But Bender you are -</speak>

<info>Bender hods his hands to his ear units and shakes his head.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah 
blah blah blah blah...</speak>

<info>Outside Past-O-Rama. The place has a Disneyland-esque theme 
to it and a slogan adorns a sign: "It's Da Boom!"</info>

<info>Cut to: Past-O-Rama Street. Bender, Leela and Fry walk around 
the streets, crowded with other tourists. They pass shops such 
as 47th Street Butter Churns, Iowa Bagel Co and a cinema playing 
Star Wars 9: Yoda's Bar Mitzvah.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Cool, it's just like the good old days!</speak>

<info>A man jumps Fry with a knife.</info>

<speak who="MUGGER">
Give me your wallet or I'll cut you!</speak>

<info>Fry laughs.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Hey Leela, get a picture of me being 
"mugged."</speak>

<info>He dangles his wallet in front of the mugger and Leela takes 
a photo.</info>

<speak who="MUGGER">
I'll take the camera too.</speak>

<info>He takes it and runs out through an exit. Fry laughs until he 
realises what has happened. He clears his throat.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Learning is fun.</speak>

<info>Time Lapse. Leela points at a screen with Dow: 11,107 on it.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Ooo, ancient Wall Street.</speak>

<info>The Dow drops to 7,539 and stockbrokers crowd around the windows 
inside.</info>

<speak who="STOCKBROKER #1">
No!</speak>

<speak who="STOCKBROKER #2">
I'm ruined!</speak>

<info>They throw themselves out of the window. The Dow goes back up 
to 11,108 and they fly back through the windows with jet-packs.</info>

<info>Time Lapse. The trio have joined a tour group. The guide is 
dressed in old fashioned very pre-20th century American clothing.</info>

<speak who="TOUR GUIDE">
I direct your attention to this ancient 
and mysterious tablet which has yet 
to be deciphered.</speak>

<info>He points to a parking sign. Leela turns to Fry.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Do you know what it means?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Yeah I asked a cop once. It means "Up 
yours kid."</speak>

<info>Bender puts his arms around Fry and Leela.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
I gotta say I'm really enjoying the 
day out with you people - Hey, a suicide 
booth! So long suckers.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Uh, sorry Bender that's just a phone 
booth.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
<info>(disappointed)</info> Oh.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
What were they used for?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
In New York? Bathrooms.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Oh. I-I'll be out in a sec.</speak>

<info>She walks into the phonebox.</info>

<info>Past-O-Rama XLIInd Street Subway. A guy with an afro stands 
next to some graffiti on the wall that just says "graffiti." 
On the same wall are two signs, one advertising "Learn Spanglish" 
and the other advertising "Laser Tentacle Surgery" in AL1. Bender, 
Fry and Leela stand by a turnstile.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
<info>(reading)</info> Tokens only. <info>(talking)</info> How 
does this work?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
I'll show you.  Whup.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Ohh, it's a turnstile.</speak>

<info>He hops over it and Leela follows with some fancy vaulting.</info>

<info>Past-O-Rama Subway Train. Leela, Bender and Fry look around 
the messy train car.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
What's this?  Another bathroom?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
No, it's a mobile apartment with no 
rent.</speak>

<info>He lies down on a seat and puts a newspaper over him. Bender 
hits him.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
C'mon Fry get up!</speak>

<info>Fry snarls like a grumpy homeless person and turns away from 
him.</info>

<info>Past-O-Rama Street. They walk out of the subway and head elsewhere.</info>

<info>Past-O-Rama Tresures Of The Holy Tomb. The 20th century museum 
seems to be themed on Ancient Egypt. Leela reads a tour leaflet.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Wow! The burial chamber of the 20th 
century's greatest spiritual leader 
- Al Sharpton.</speak>

<info>Bender looks at a glass case of jewellery.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Wow. Now this guy had taste!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
It says he was mummified in ceremonial 
vestments.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
We sometimes called it a jogging suit.</speak>

<info>Past-O-Rama Traffic Pavilion. Fry, Leela and Bender watch a 
holo-film of a busy New York street, packed with cars.</info>

<speak who="NARRATOR">
<info>(voice-over)</info> They traffic jams of Old 
New York were a public forum of free 
interchange of opinions.</speak>

<info>In the holo-film the cars honk their horns.</info>

<speak who="NARRATOR">
<info>(voice-over)</info> It all started with Gerald 
Ford's famous invention, the "automocar" 
......which was powered by a tank of 
burning fossils. Here we see a 20th 
century assembly line where cars were 
constructed by primative robots.</speak>

<info>A metal door goes up and behind it robots dressed like cavemen 
bang car frames with clubs.</info>

<speak who="ROBOTS">
<info>(chanting)</info> Ooga ooga ooga ooga ooga 
ooga...</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
We've come a long way baby!</speak>

<info>The walkway moves on.</info>

<speak who="NARRATOR">
<info>(voice-over)</info> The fruit of the robots' 
labour was this......the stately 1992 
Latoura.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Hey, my girlfriend had one of those! 
Actually it wasn't her's it was her 
dad's. Actually she wasn't my girlfriend. 
She just lived next door and never closed 
her curtains.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Fry, remember when I told you about 
always ending your stories a sentence 
earlier?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
C'mon, let's sneak in for a closer look.</speak>

<info>He peers in through the car's window. A man dressed in medieval 
clothes stands behind him.</info>

<speak who="MAN">
Sir, we don't touch the antiques sir. 
You - oh!  I'm sorry. You work here. 
I should have realised from that ridiculous 
getup you're wearing.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Hey! This is from Miller's Outpo - uh, 
I mean, yeah, I work here alright!</speak>

<info>The man hands him some keys.</info>

<speak who="MAN">
Here, move this rust bucket outside 
behind Saint Koch's cathedral.</speak>

<info>He moves away but takes one last look at Fry and laughs.</info>

<info>Cut to: Car. Fry and Bender climb in the front and Leela sits 
in the back.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Did you drive much in the 20th century 
Fry?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Nope.  No one in New York drove. There 
was too much traffic.  Nice! Listen 
to that baby purr!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
There's a baby in there huh?</speak>

<info>Fry looks in behind him, in the rear-view mirror and behind 
him again.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
It's just like riding a bicyc -</speak>

<info>Cut to: Past-O-Rama Traffic Pavilion. The car lurches forward 
and smashes through the wall.</info>

<info>Cut to: Past-O-Rama Street. The three scream as the car speeds 
past people and cuts up a taxi being pulled a rickshaw driver, 
with a couple sat on the roof. The car mounts the pavement and 
they carry on screaming.</info>

<info>Cut to: Past-O-Rama Theatre. 26 dancebots can-can to a packed 
theatre hall. The car ploughs through the wall and drives across 
the stage, cutting off the dancebots' legs. The dancebots fall 
to the floor.</info>

<info>Cut to: Past-O-Rama Street. The car spins out of control past 
a three-card-mont�-bot and finnaly crashes into something and 
comes to a stop.</info>

<info>Cut to: Car. The airbags inflate in the front and the three 
groan.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
I think I got whiplash.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
You can't have whiplash, you don't have 
a neck.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
I meant ass whiplash.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
I'm just glad we hit something. I thought 
we'd never stop.</speak>

<info>He opens the door and gets out.</info>

<info>Cut to: Past-O-Rama Street. Bender and Leela get out too. There 
is a huge smoking dent in the front of the car. The trio gasp. 
The thing that made the dent was another bending unit. It is 
Bender's exact double, except for a goatee. The bending unit 
rubs it's ass.</info>

<speak who="BENDING UNIT">
Ow! I think I got whiplash.</speak>

<info>He falls unconcious.</info>

<info>Planet Express: Lounge. Fry, Zoidberg, Leela and Hermes impatiently 
pace around the room while Bender casually sits on the couch 
reading a magazine. Fry looks at a clock. 6:24. 6:25. Enter Farnsworth 
and Amy, wearing masks and work aprons. Farnsworth holds a blowtorch.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
How's that robot I ran over?</speak>

<info>Farnsworth lifts his mask.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
We did all we could.</speak>

<info>Fry gasps.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
You mean he's -</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Good as new? Yes.</speak>

<info>Planet Express: Farnsworth's Lab. The crew are assembled in 
the room.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Leela, Zoidberg, the rest of you, this 
is Flexo.</speak>

<info>He points to Flexo who is sat on a worktop.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
Sweet llamas of the Bahamas! Except 
for that stylish beard, he looks just 
like Bender!</speak>

<info>Flexo hops off the worktop. His voice is exactly like Bender's.</info>

<speak who="FLEXO">
No duh dreadlock, we're both bending 
units.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Hey brobot, what's you serial number?</speak>

<speak who="FLEXO">
3370318.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
No way! Mine's 2716057!</speak>

<info>They both laugh. Fry joins in then stops.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
I don't get it.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
We're both expressable as the sum of 
two cubes.</speak>

<info>Flexo cheers and they high five.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
So uh, Flexo. Sorry about crushing your 
body like that. You OK now?</speak>

<speak who="FLEXO">
Well I don't feel as bad as you look! 
Nah I'm just messing with you kid. 
You're alright. That's some face you 
got though, I think they got a cream 
for that.  Nah, you're great.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Well just let me know if there's anything 
I can do to make it up to you.</speak>

<speak who="FLEXO">
Actually your little stunt did a number 
on my back. You mind rubbin' it for 
me?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Uh...sure.</speak>

<info>He starts rubbing Flexo's shoulders.</info>

<speak who="FLEXO">
Aw yeah, that's it. A little lower.</speak>

<info>Lower.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
How's that?</speak>

<speak who="FLEXO">
Lower. Yeah that's it. A little lower 
though.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Uh I can't get any lower than this.</speak>

<speak who="FLEXO">
I'll say, you're rubbing my ass!</speak>

<info>He and Bender burst out laughing and high five again.</info>

<info>Outside Electric Ladyland Laptop Dances. A robot advertises 
what is inside.</info>

<speak who="ROBOT #1">
Hey, check it out here, six beautiful 
devices. They know what you like and 
they'll do it to within a tolerance 
of one micron!</speak>

<info>Electric Ladyland Laptop Dances. In the smokey strip club a 
Fembot does a fan dance with real fans.</info>

<speak who="ROBOT #2">
Yeah spin those fans baby!</speak>

<info>Another robot dog whistles.</info>

<speak who="ROBOT #3">
Alright mama!</speak>

<speak who="ROBOT #4">
Gyrate baby!</speak>

<info>Flexo and Bender smoke cigars. Fry coughs.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
I don't like this place. It's 120 degrees 
and there's very little oxygen.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Shut up and hoot.  Hubba-hubba, she 
is built! In Mexico I believe.</speak>

<speak who="FLEXO">
And that ain't silicon. It's tungsten 
- and plenty of it!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
<info>(unsure)</info> Uh, yeah. Look at that exhaust 
fan.</speak>

<speak who="FLEXO">
Eww!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Pervert.</speak>

<speak who="FLEXO">
Yoo-hoo!</speak>

<info>He waves a dollar and puts it into the stripperbot.</info>

<speak who="STRIPPERBOT">
Thanks moderate spender. Please select 
erotic transaction.</speak>

<speak who="FLEXO">
Yeah, how 'bout a lapdance for my pal 
here?</speak>

<info>The stripperbot moves towards Fry.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Uh, no, that's alright.  Ow! Ow!</speak>

<info>Planet Express: Meeting Room. The next morning Fry sits at the 
table with a plaster on his head and holding an icebag to it 
and wearing a neck brace.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
I'm telling you there's something about 
Flexo I don't like.</speak>

<info>Enter Flexo and Bender.</info>

<speak who="FLEXO">
Hey Fry, think fast.  Get it? It's chlorine!</speak>

<info>He and Bender laugh and leave. Zoidberg laughs.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
It's funny because it's poisonous!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Yeah keep laughing brineshrimp but he's 
bad news. I regret ever running him 
over.</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
Take a rage dump man. He's no worse 
than Bender.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
He's much worse. He drinks, he smokes 
and he posts naked pictures of me on 
the internet.</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
That's Bender alright.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
I'm talking about Flexo.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Oh I get it, this is cute. You're jealous 
of Bender's new friend!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
No I'm not. Mark my words. Flexo's evil. 
He's the evil Bender.</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
Rage dump!</speak>

<info>Farnsworth appears on the big screen.</info>

<info>Everyone looks around in confusion.</info>

<info>Planet Express: Farnsworth's Bedroom. Farnsworth sits on his 
four-poster bed while the crew and Flexo are gathered around.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Everyone get in bed with me. I have 
something to show you.  Feast your eyes 
on this!</speak>

<info>Everyone gasps.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
It's beautiful.</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
And huge.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Can I touch it?</speak>

<info>Behind the curtains Farnsworth holds a big glowing atom.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
So what is it already?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
It's a single atom of jumbonium. And 
element so rare, the nucleus alone is 
worth more than $50,000.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
How much more?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
100,000. That's why I hid it here. Under 
my mattress.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Uh Professor, can we discuss this somewhere 
else?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Why certainly.</speak>

<info>Planet Express: Farnsworth's Bathroom. Farnsworth sits in the 
bath still holding the atom a toy scale model of the Planet Express 
ship floats in the bath with him.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
The atom sits atop this dime stored 
tiara which will be awarded to the winner 
of this years Miss Universe pageant 
on the planet Tova 9.  Your job is to 
deliver it, safe and sound.</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
Wow, when I was a little girl on Mars 
I dreamed of being Miss Universe.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
That's kinda pathetic.</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
Aw come on Leela. Deep down all girls 
wanna be Miss Universe.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Not me.</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
Really? Maybe it's just cute girls.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Due to the atom's tremendous value, 
Planet Express would go bankrupt if 
it was stolen. Therefore we'll need 
to hire on additional security for the 
mission.</speak>

<info>Flexo raises his hand.</info>

<speak who="FLEXO">
Oh oh Mr Professor, right here!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Uh, maybe we should stick with people 
we know and trust. I mean, Flexo's great 
but -</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Flexo's great you say? Well that's good 
enough for me.  Welcome aboard lad.</speak>

<info>Flexo cackles.</info>

<info>The ship speeds away from Earth en route to Tova 9.</info>

<info>Cut to: Ship's Cargo Bay. Leela puts the atom in a transparent 
safe and locks it. She turns around, holding a laser.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Space banditos have been operating in 
this quadrant so you'll each take 8-hour 
shifts guarding the safe. First Bender, 
then Flexo, then Fry.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Wait, I don't like the sound of that. 
Let's just go alphabetically.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
OK. First Bender, then Flexo, then Fry.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Wait, let's go by rank.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
OK. First Bender, then Flexo, then Fry.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Flexo outranks me?</speak>

<speak who="FLEXO">
That's "Flexo outranks me, sir"!</speak>

<info>He pokes Fry. Then some more.</info>

<info>Time Lapse. Bender's shift has started. He stands with his laser 
poises, rotating his head around. The cargo bay door opens. Enter 
Fry. Bender points the laser at him.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Halt. Who goes there?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Don't point that at me.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Fry who?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Look, I know Flexo's your friend but 
I don't trust him alone with the atom.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
My God Fry just 'cause the guy's got 
a beard you label him as evil? Well 
I got a label for you pal. An ugly little 
word called "prejudice."</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
I'm not prejudiced.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Ah save it for the cross burning Adolf!</speak>

<info>Time Lapse. Fry is gone and Bender sits with his feet on the 
safe reading Pentiumhouse magazine. Enter Flexo.</info>

<speak who="FLEXO">
Keeping an eye on the safe?</speak>

<info>Bender puts down the magazine. He only has one eye.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
You know it!</speak>

<info>He points at his other eye sitting on a crate the other side 
of the cargo bay, watching the safe.</info>

<speak who="FLEXO">
Well, looks like it's my shift. You 
lie down and go offline for a while.</speak>

<info>Bender yawns.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Alright.</speak>

<info>He picks up his eye and walks out the room whistling. The door 
closes behind him and Flexo laughs as he looks at the atom. Fry 
jumps out from behind a crate.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Caught you!  I saw you looking at the 
atom!</speak>

<speak who="FLEXO">
So? I look at lots of atoms. Shouldn't 
you be resting up for your shift?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Oh-ho you'd like it if I went to sleep 
wouldn't you?</speak>

<speak who="FLEXO">
Whatever it takes to shut your yapper. 
Nah, I'm just kidding you, you're a 
joker.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Yeah well here's a funny joke. I'm gonna 
sit right here till it's my shift.</speak>

<speak who="FLEXO">
Suit yourself skinbag.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
That I will.</speak>

<speak who="FLEXO">
Good.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Good.</speak>

<speak who="FLEXO">
Good.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Good.</speak>

<speak who="FLEXO">
Good.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Good.  Good.</speak>

<info>Time Lapse. Flexo sits with the laser, bored, while Fry paces 
up and down. Fry's watch beeps.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Well, that's eight hours.</speak>

<info>He snatches the laser from Flexo.</info>

<speak who="FLEXO">
Yeah eight hours of solid boredom.  
Nah, I'm kidding, you're a wonderful 
man.</speak>

<info>He leaves and Fry sits down.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Finally, the atom is safe.</speak>

<info>He falls asleep immediately.</info>

<info>The ship flies towards Tova 9.</info>

<info>Outside Miss Universe Pageant. The ship lands on a landing pad 
near a sign informing people that "Contestants May Not Exceed 
More Than 50% Implant."</info>

<info>Cut to: Ship's Cargo Bay. The ship shakes as it lands and Fry 
wakes up. He screams. The safe is broken and the atom is gone. 
Leela runs in.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
What is it?  My God! Did you hear maracas?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
No.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Then it wasn't space banditos.  Bender, 
lock down the ship, don't let Flexo 
escape.</speak>

<info>Behind her Bender is wearing a blue scarf around his neck.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Aye aye captain. It appears that Flexo 
has outwitted us all. Especially me...Bender.</speak>

<info>Time Lapse. Leela and Fry look at the broken safe.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
How could Flexo have stolen the atom?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
He must have used a sleep ray on me. 
Sleep rays exist in the future right?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
No.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Then I must've fallen asleep.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Well you were sure right about Flexo 
being evil.</speak>

<info>Bender peers around the doorway, the bottom of his face and 
his body obscured by the wall.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
I locked down the ship but he may have 
already gotten away.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
OK, thanks Bender. Let's fan out and 
look for him.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Roger that, I got a map of the ship 
right here.</speak>

<info>He walks into full view carrying a big map that hides his body 
and lower face. Leela walks over to him and whispers to him.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
<info>(whispering)</info> Keep an eye on Fry. We 
can't rule out the possibility that 
he did it.</speak>

<info>Ship's Medical Lab. Leela sneaks in with her laser at the ready. 
She flicks on the lights and positions herself by a cupboard 
marked "Emergency Supplies."</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Aha!</speak>

<info>She opens the cupboard but all that is in there is a clown suit.</info>

<info>Leela's Quarters. Fry snoops around by a chest of drawers.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Aha!  Uh searching...hmm.</speak>

<info>Enter Leela.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Fry? Why are you looking for Flexo in 
my underpants drawer?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
I didn't find him here 10 minutes ago 
so I thought it was time to check again.</speak>

<info>Leela slaps his hand. Bender walks in with the map covering 
him again.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Well, he wasn't in the uh, kitchen room.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
<info>(suspicious)</info> Say Bender, can I hold 
that map for a second?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Any leave me high and dry in case of 
a scavenger hunt? I think not.</speak>

<info>Fry starts pulling at the map but Bender holds onto it, with 
it still covering his face.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Give it up!</speak>

<info>They struggle for a bit and Fry eventually pulls it away, revealing 
Bender to be wearing his green turtleneck that covers his chin.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Alright, take it. Sheesh.</speak>

<info>He leaves. Fry eyes him suspiciously.</info>

<info>Ship's Cargo Bay. Leela and Fry inspect the safe again.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Well, looks like Flexo got away clean.</speak>

<info>Bender is stood behind Fry wearing another scarf.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
It's a darn shame.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
He must have jumped ship with the atom 
the second we landed.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Or maybe, he never left at all!  Wait 
a minute. You're Bender.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Of course, who said I wasn't?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
But why were you wearing that scarf, 
that turtleneck and this fruity number?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
It's a little thing called "style." 
Look it up sometime.</speak>

<info>He puts the scarf back on.</info>

<info>Outside Miss Universe Pageant. A screen advertises the Miss 
Universe pageant tonight and the Miss Parallel Universe pageant 
tomorrow. Flexo runs into the building laughing evily.</info>

final finalist, Miss Earth's Moon, the

<info>The Crushinator rolls in and crushes some shoes.</info>

<speak who="CRUSHINATOR">
<info>(mechanical voice)</info> Thank you Bob Barker, 
I'm as happy as a girl can be. End statement.</speak>

<speak who="BARKER">
Which one of these lovely womanoids 
will take home the lovely tiara?</speak>

<info>From the side of the stage Leela peers around the curtains and 
gestures to Barker.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
<info>(whispering)</info> Downplay the tiara.</speak>

<speak who="BARKER">
Uh, we'll find out after these subliminal 
messages.</speak>

<info>Bob Barker's Dressing Room. The Planet Express crew are with 
him.</info>

<speak who="BARKER">
So you lost the atom huh? You're garbage, 
human garbage! Do you braindead space 
jockeys have any idea how much that 
thing is worth?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
100,000?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
200,000?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
200,001?</speak>

<info>Barker looks at Leela.</info>

<speak who="BARKER">
You're closest without going over.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Well, we'll be leaving now. If you'll 
just sign this form saying you received 
the atom.</speak>

<speak who="BARKER">
I'm not signing squat. You find me that 
damn tiara before the pageant ends.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
But Mr Barker -</speak>

<speak who="BARKER">
Enough out of you. I may be against 
the fur industry, but that won't stop 
me from skinning you alive! As long 
as no one wears the skin.</speak>

<info>A woman wheels him out.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Well gentlemen, it appears we're boned.</speak>

<info>Flexo wanders past the open door.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Flexo!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Get him!</speak>

<info>Cut to: Miss Universe Pageant. Miss Unnamed Planet #2859-B plays 
the William Tell tune on a bugle. She stops and takes her hands 
away revealing the bugle to be her nose. The judges give their 
scores. Florp from planet Trisol gives her an 8, Calculon gives 
her a nine and Zapp Brannigan holds up a "Room 715" sign and 
shakes the keys to the room sexfully.</info>

<speak who="BARKER">
Next up in what is generously called 
the "Talent Competition," performing 
a traditional gangster rap, Miss - what

<info>Flexo runs onto the stage followed by Bender, Fry and Leela. 
The women scream and Bender dives on Flexo.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Got you!</speak>

<info>They get up and try punching each other, each moving exactly 
the same way and getting nowhere.</info>

<speak who="WOMEN">
<info>(chanting)</info> Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! 
Fight!</speak>

<info>Leela points a laser at the two robots. They have their hands 
at each others throats, covering any suspicious goatee that might 
help tell them apart.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Shoot him, he's choking me!</speak>

<speak who="FLEXO">
No shoot him, he's choking me!</speak>

<info>They struggle and beads of sweat trickle down Leela's face.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
I don't know which one to shoot.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Flexo! Shoot Flexo!</speak>

<info>Bender and Flexo fence each other using their antennas and they 
break through a wall.</info>

<info>Cut to: Miss Universe Dressing Room. The Miss Universe contestants 
run away screaming, covering themselves with towels. An Amazonian 
seperates them.</info>

<speak who="AMAZONIAN">
Women only room!</speak>

<info>She lifts them up.</info>

<info>Cut to: Miss Universe Pageant. The jellyfish creature Zoidberg 
hooked up with in A Flight To Remember is in the middle of her 
rap. Bender and Flexo fly out through the hole in the wall and 
knock her over. They cover each others chins again.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Alright, enough of this.  There's the 
atom!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Aw jeez.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Bender? You stole the atom?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Yeah but I can explain, it's very valuable.</speak>

<speak who="FLEXO">
I saw him snatch it while Fry was asleep. 
That's why I ran to tell Bob Barker.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Whoa whoa, you mean Bender is the evil 
Bender? I am shocked, shocked! Well 
not that shocked.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
I'm sorry we suspected you Flexo. It's 
just, what with the beard and all.</speak>

<speak who="FLEXO">
Don't even bother. You people sicken 
me. I put my life on the line to guard 
that atom and this is how you repay 
me? Well you can go rot for all I care. 
Nah, I'm just kidding, you guys are 
alright.</speak>

<info>He walks off laughing.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
I'm so confused. The Bender I liked 
turn out to be evil and the Bender I 
hated was good. How can I live my life 
when I can't tell good from evil?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Eh, they're both fine choices, whatever 
floats your boat.</speak>

<info>He takes out a cigar and smokes it.</info>

<info>Miss Universe Pageant Backstage. Bob Barker reads a book the

<speak who="FLEXO">
Wait, but I -</speak>

<speak who="BARKER">
Take him away.</speak>

<info>Miss Universe Pageant. The contestants are all lined up ready 
for the winner to be announced.</info>

<speak who="BARKER">
Alright, let's put an end to this pathetic 
hoedown. Brannigan read the thing.</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
And the winner is...</speak>

<info>He starts to open the envelope. Leela, Fry and Bender watch 
from the side of the stage.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
It figures. Who else but Zapp Brannigan 
would be judging the most chauvinistic, 
degrading, dehumanising -</speak>

<info>Zapp turns around.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Huh? Leela?</speak>

<info>Everyone applauds and a spotlight moves to Leela.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Wait, you're making a -  Ooo! Look at 
that.  I feel like a princess.</speak>

<info>She starts to cry and walks on the stage and waves to the applauding 
audience.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Wait. What are you people, idiots? I'm 
still going mano a mano with this envelope. 
Miss Vega 4.  <info>(singing)</info> There it is, 
Miss Universe. There it is, looking 
weird.</speak>

<info>The tiara sinks into Miss Vega 4. Fry, Leela and Bender watch. 
Leela sighs.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
I almost had that tiara.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Me too.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Well, you guys might both be losers 
but I just made out with that radiator 
woman from the radiator planet.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Fry, that's a radiator.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Oh.  Is there a burn ward within 10 
feet of here?</speak>
