               <note>Madison Cube Garden. It's Earth's 3004 Olympic Games (Plus Opening 
               Act). Crowds cheer as an athlete carrying the Olympic torch runs 
               up the steps to light the Olympic flame. He opens a hatch in 
               the side, ignites the pilot light and turns the flame up like 
               a hotplate. The crowds cheer.</note>

                         So who should I root for? America or 
                         one of those countries I learned about 
                         at the Food Court?

                         Husband, you haven't been an Olympic 
                         class limboer for 20 years! Quit lying 
                         to your podgy self.

                         It does seem like Jamaica will be able 
                         to field a strong limbo team without 
                         you.

                         Yeah, isn't that basically all Jamaicans 
                         do?

                         Jamaicans have other interests. Which 
                         is why the limbo team got detained at 
                         the airport.

                         win a medal either. Even at bending 
                         - the thing I was built to do. I'm so 
                         embarassed. I wish everybody else was

                         Fembots?  Methinks a clever Manbot suitably 
                         disguised might win those events! But 
                         the charade would require subtlety, 
                         nuance, grace.

                         Yes Humorbot. If you ask me, women today 
                         are too stuck up to go out and jiggle 
                         their jello like everybody wants them 
                         to. In fact, should I do it now?  Alright 
                         then!  Woo! Look out baby! Work it out! 
                         Oo shake that thing! You gotta use it

                         I marry Calculon, divorce him, take 
                         half his money and turn back into a 
                         guy. It's sort of a two-person pyramid 
                         scheme.
