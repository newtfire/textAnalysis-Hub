<info>Planet Express: Lounge. Late at night Fry and Bender sit on 
the couch. The are four Slurm cans on the coffee table. Fry drinks 
from another one and they watch All My Circuits on the TV. Calculon 
opens the door to his bedroom.</info>

<speak who="CALCULON">
Honey unit, I'm home.  Monique!</speak>

<info>Monique is in bed with Boxy. She pulls the sheets up around 
her.</info>

<speak who="MONIQUE">
Calculon!</speak>

<info>Boxy beeps.</info>

<speak who="CALCULON">
Oh, how I wish I could believe that. 
You may be my evil half-brother, but 
there's no law against murdering the 
other half.</speak>

<info>The screen changes to the All My Circuits logo.</info>

<speak who="ANNOUNCER #1">
All My Circuits will be right back 
after this word from...</speak>

<info>The screen changes to an advert.</info>

<speak who="ANNOUNCER #2">
... Slurm! It's highly addictive!</speak>

<info>A hand takes a can of Slurm off the screen. The hand belongs 
to a surfing slug. Two babes on a beach watch him.</info>

<speak who="BABE">
Look! It's Slurms MacKenzie!</speak>

<speak who="DIXIE">
He's the original party worm!</speak>

<info>Slurms surfs onto the beach between the girls and they stroke 
him.</info>

<speak who="SLURMS">
Whimmy-wham-wham-wazzle! Let's party!</speak>

<info>He and the babes dance on the beach and are joined by other 
dancing people. They all drink cans of Slurm.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Look at that worm go. Who says there 
are no more heroes?</speak>

<info>On the TV Slurms surfs with the two babes.</info>

<speak who="SLURMS">
Hey, dudes, you can win a chance to 
party with me, Slurms MacKenzie, at 
the Slurm bottling plant on planet Wormulon!</speak>

<info>A still picture of Slurms playing a guitar with the babes and 
a crate of Slurm appears on the screen with the words "Win A 
Trip."</info>

<speak who="ANNOUNCER #2">
Just look for the winning bottle-cap 
inside specially-marked cans of Slurm.</speak>

<info>Back on the board the babe shakes something out of her Slurm 
can and shows it to the camera. It is a bottle-cap with "You 
Win!" printed on it. She gasps.</info>

<speak who="BABE">
I won!</speak>

<info>Disclaimers appear on the screen. "Slurm Has Been Found To Cause 
Cancer In Laboratory Humans", "Employees Of Slurm Corp. And Their 
Families Are Eligible To Enter And Will Probably Win" and "The 
following species are ineligible: Space wasps, space beavers, 
any other animal with the word 'Space' in front of it, space 
chickens and the elusive yak-face" in alien language #1.</info>

<speak who="SLURM ANNOUNCER #2">
No purchase necessary unless you wish 
to enter the contest. Odds of winning 
mathematically insignificant.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
I like those odds.  Rats. Just another 
tooth.  Aah!</speak>

<info>He smiles a big toothless smile.</info>

<info>Opening Credits. Caption: Live From Omicron Persei 8.</info>

<info>Planet Express: Meeting Room. The staff sit around the table 
watching Fry guzzle down another can of Slurm. Fry shakes the 
can upside-down and looks inside. "You're A Loser" is printed 
on the bottom. He groans.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
I gotta find that golden bottle-cap.</speak>

<info>He throws the can behind him, opens another one and starts drinking 
it.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
I've never seen anyone so addicted to 
Slurm.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
This is nothing. Back in high school 
I used to drink a hundred cans of cola 
a week. Right up until my third heart 
attack.</speak>

<info>The door opens and Bender stands in the doorway clutching his 
door and groaning. His antenna is wilted and he is a slightly 
redder colour.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Bender, what's wrong?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
I'm sick.</speak>

<info>He sneezes and his eyes pop out and back in again.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
You poor baby. Let me check if you have 
a fever.  Ow!</speak>

<info>Farnsworth opens Bender's door with his lab coat acting as a 
glove.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
According to Bender's temperature gauge, 
which I suggest you use next time, Leela, 
he's running a fever of ... 900 degrees.</speak>

<info>He closes the door and Bender groans. Hermes fluffs a cushion 
on a couch in the corner.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
Bender, mon, lie yourself down.  You're 
payin' for that!</speak>

<info>Planet Express: Zoidberg's Office. Bender sits on the examination 
table and the rest of the staff gather around.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
I'll have a look, but I remind you, 
I'm an expert on humans not robots.</speak>

<info>He shines a torch into Fry's eye.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
I'm not Bender, I'm Fry.</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Really? I though you were the robot.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Nope. Human.</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Alright, alright, spare me your life 
story.  Now what seems to be the trouble?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
My tummy hurts and I've been having 
this burning electrical discharge.</speak>

<info>Zoidberg runs a stethescope across Bender's casing.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Hmm. Don't worry, you'll be fine.  <info>(muttering)</info> 
Oh boy. <info>(quietly)</info> I didn't have the 
heart to tell him: It's fin fungus. 
He'll be floating upside-down by morning.</speak>

<info>He walks off tutting. Amy turns to Bender.</info>

<speak who="AMY">
You should try homeopathic medicine, 
Bender. Take some zinc.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
I'm 40% zinc.</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
Then take some Echinaea or a St. John's 
wort.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Or a big fat placebo. It's all the same 
crap.</speak>

<info>Bender coughs and a sound comes from his chest cabinet.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Hey, what's rattling around in there?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
It may well be the cause of Bender's 
illness. But more importantly, it's 
a flimsy pretext to try out my latest 
invention. To the laboratory!</speak>

<info>He shuffles off very slowly and the rest quickly pass him.</info>

<info>Planet Express: Farnsworth's Lab. Farnsworth holds up a torch-like 
object to the rest of the crew.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
I call this the F-ray. It's like an 
X-ray only it allows you to see through 
anything - even metal. Now, the neutrino 
beam it emits is a tad dangerous, so 
you'll all need protective goggles. 
You may feel a slight stinging sensation 
- all of you-- All of you!  Aha! There's 
the cause of your illness.</speak>

<info>Amy looks.</info>

<speak who="AMY">
Hey, that's my watch!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
I was wondering where I put that.  Hey, 
now I feel much better! Thanks, Professor. 
And, Amy, I'm sorry I took your watch.</speak>

<info>She smiles and hugs him. Bender steals her earrings and chuckles. 
She moves away and he tosses the earrings down his throat and 
coughs. Fry and Bender stay with Farnsworth while the others 
leave. Farnsworth takes off his suit.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Well, I've got to go take this suit 
to the decontaminators. You two lock 
up the F-ray and for the love of God 
don't let it fall into the wrong hands.</speak>

<info>He hands it to them. They look at each other and chuckle.</info>

<info>New New York City Street. Fry and Bender walk down the busy 
street with the F-ray. Bender holds it up.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
What should we point it at first?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
I 'unno. Try it on me.  Ow! My sperm!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Wow, neat! Mind if I try that again?</speak>

<info>He points it at Fry's crotch again but nothing happens.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Huh, didn't hurt that time.</speak>

<info>Bender watches a Fembot walk past.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Whoa, mama! Hold still, sexy lady.</speak>

<info>He points the F-ray at her and gasps.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
What's wrong?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
That's no lady!</speak>

<speak who="FEMBOT">
Damn chico, one more upgrade and I'll 
be more lady than you can handle! Why 
you so stupid, stupid?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Hey, bite my shiny metal ass!</speak>

<speak who="FEMBOT">
You couldn't afford it, honey.</speak>

<info>It snaps it's fingers and walks off.</info>

<info>7^11. Outside the convenience store some people queue outside 
a suicide booth and a sign advertises the shop as being "Open 
28 Hours". Inside Bender and Fry use the F-ray to look inside 
products such as Mom's Friendly Robot Oil, Bachelor Chow, Robo 
Fresh, Tanning Butter, Mr Baked Beans and Glagnar's Human Rinds. 
Fry groans.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
All this prolonged exposure to radiation 
is making me thirsty.  Ah, if only there 
was some way of knowing which can had 
the winning bottle-cap inside.</speak>

<info>Bender stops pointing the F-ray at some Hot Logs and turns to 
Fry.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Huh, w-what? I didn't hear you. I was 
too busy using this F-ray to look inside 
of things.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Wait a second. I'm getting an idea. 
N-No, false alarm. No. Yeah. No. Yeah. 
No. Wait. No. Yeah. Yeah. No ... no. 
Yes!</speak>

<info>Montage Fry points the F-ray at the stack of Slurm cans and 
shakes his head in disappointment. In the street, Bender takes 
a can of Slurm from a small boy with a red balloon. The boy cries, 
Bender points the F-ray at the can and hands it back to the boy 
when he sees there is nothing inside. The boy stops crying. Bender 
points the F-ray at the balloon and it bursts and the boy cries 
again. Fry points the F-ray at a Slurm dispenser but there is 
no winning cap inside. Bender extends his arm into the coin tray 
and takes a handful of coins. Back in the street Bender points 
the F-ray at a Slurm blimp. It explodes and he and Fry run away.</info>

<info>Planet Express: Lounge. Leela and Farnsworth sit at the table 
playing 3D Scrabble, a version of 3D Chess from Star Trek. On 
the top level are the words "ONE" and "EYE"; On the second row 
is "MATT" and "AREA"; On the third is "POOP" and "ONLY" and on 
the fourth is "DONUT," "ONE" and "EMU". The letters on Farnsworth's 
rack spell "FUUTAMA". The door opens and Bender slams the F-ray 
onto the table, upsetting the letters.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Ah, this thing stinks.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
We checked 90,000 cans of Slurm and 
all we won was this junk.  I never wanna 
see another can of Slurm again. Man, 
am I thirsty.</speak>

<info>He walks over to the fridge and takes out a refreshing can of 
Slurm. He starts guzzling it back and suddenly starts to cough 
and choke.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Fry, are you alright?</speak>

<info>Bender picks up the F-ray and points it at Fry's neck. A Slurm 
bottle-cap with "You Win" written on it is lodged in his throat.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
You did it, Fry! You found the winning 
bottle-cap! We won!</speak>

<info>Fry cheers and wheezes.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
<info>(wheezy)</info> Hooray!</speak>

<info>He faints.</info>

<info>The Planet Express ship flies towards the Slurm planet. The 
planet has a ring and the "Slurm" logo is painted on it. The 
ship disappears into the atmosphere.</info>

<info>Cut to: Outside Slurm Factory. The ship descends from the clouds, 
the landing gear comes down and it lands outside the Slurm factory 
which bears an uncanny resemblance to the Wonka factory in Willy 
Wonka And The Chocolate Factory. A banner reading "Welcome Contest 
Winners!" has been hung above the gates. Fry, Bender, Leela, 
Amy and the rest of the staff walk out of the ship down the steps.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Ooh, look at that!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Hey!</speak>

<info>Outside the gates are four worms. Two of them play a fanfare 
and the gates open. A path leads from the gates up to a building. 
On the steps of the building two worms roll out a red carpet. 
The end of the carpet reaches the gates and a worm dressed like 
Gene Wilder in Willy Wonka And The Chocolate Factory pops out.</info>

<speak who="GLURMO">
Welcome to the planet Wormulon. I'm 
Glurmo, your golly-rific guide to the 
splend-tacular Slurm factory.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Uh-huh. Can we have our free Slurm now?</speak>

<speak who="GLURMO">
You'll have all the Slurm you can drink 
later on when you're partying with my 
good friend Slurms MacKenzie.</speak>

<info>He moves aside and behind him is Slurms and the babes. Slurms' 
party music plays.</info>

<speak who="SLURMS">
Alright! Whimmy-wham-wham-wazzle! Lay 
some skin on me, dudes!</speak>

<info>Fry and Bender do. Some worm slime comes off on Fry's hand.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Wow! The original party worm!  Are you 
ready to get down, get funky with us?</speak>

<speak who="GLURMO">
He'd better be, that's what we pay him 
for. Right, Slurms?</speak>

<info>Slurms cringes and starts waving his arms around.</info>

<speak who="SLURMS">
Right!</speak>

<speak who="GLURMO">
In fact, Slurms has to party all night, 
every night - or he's fired!</speak>

<speak who="SLURMS">
<info>(tired)</info> Rock on!</speak>

<speak who="GLURMO">
But before the party, you're all in 
for a fun-derful treat: A VIP tour of 
the Slurm factory!</speak>

<info>He slides back through the gates and the staff follow.</info>

<speak who="SLURMS">
Enjoy the tour, dudes!  I'm gonna go 
lie down.</speak>

<info>Slurm Factory Entrance. Glurmo and the staff are gathered in 
the dim room.</info>

<speak who="GLURMO">
Welcome, my friends, to the wondrous 
world of whimsy that we like to call 
"Slurms Centralised Industrial Fabrication 
Unit".</speak>

<info>Behind him some worms open some doors.</info>

<info>Cut to: Slurms Centralised Industrial Fabrication Unit. The 
crew walk through the door and gasp. The room looks like the 
huge room in Willy Wonka And The Chocolate Factory. Slurm cans 
grow on trees and a river of Slurm flows down the middle.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Oh, my!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Look! Flowers! And a boat!</speak>

<info>The boat is a small paddle boat. The crew walk to the river 
bank and are about to get on the boat when they see some small 
creatures across the river carrying barrels of Slurm. They have 
orange faces and green hair and look like the Oompa-Loompas from 
Willy Wonka And The Chocolate Factory. They wave.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Who are those horrible orange creatures 
over there?</speak>

<speak who="GLURMO">
Why those are the Grunka Lunkas. They 
work here in the Slurm factory.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Tell them I hate them.</speak>

<info>Time Lapse. The staff and Glurmo are now on the boat and it 
sails down the green river.</info>

<speak who="GLURMO">
As we sail down the river of Slurm you'll 
see our mix-ologists at work.  They 
take 900 of the finest ingredients, 
add a touch of child-like delight and 
mix it all with glacial spring water 
from our glacial spring water generator. 
Then, last of all, we add the secret 
ingredient that makes Slurm so deliciously 
addictive.</speak>

<info>A Grunka Lunka tips up a barrel labelled "Secret Ingredient" 
into a cauldron of Slurm ingredients but another pulls a curtain 
across before anyone can see anything.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
So, what's the secret ingredient?</speak>

<speak who="GLURMO">
It's whatever your imagination wants 
it to be.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Oh. But what is it really?</speak>

<speak who="GLURMO">
<info>(sternly)</info> That's not for you to know. 
<info>(normal)</info> Now, over here the Grunka Lunkas 
are inducing Wumpus berries to release 
their flavour, using sensual massage.</speak>

<info>He points to some Grunka Lunkas who rub piles of purple berries.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
<info>(whispering)</info> Psst, those berries. Those 
are the secret ingredient, right?</speak>

<speak who="GLURMO">
No.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
You positive?</speak>

<speak who="GLURMO">
Yes.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
I'm just asking cause they look kind 
of secret.</speak>

<speak who="GLURMO">
Enough! There will be no further questions.</speak>

<info>Fry raises his hand.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Why?</speak>

<info>Leela points across him.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Hey, look! The disgusting little men 
are starting to sing.</speak>

<info>On the river bank six Grunka Lunkas line up and dance and sing.</info>

<speak who="GRUNKA LUNKAS">
<info>(singing)</info> Grunka Lunka dunkity-do,

We've got a friendly warning for you,

Grunka Lunka dunkity-dasis,

The secret of Slurm's on a need-to-know basis.

</speak><speak who="GRUNKA LUNKA #1">
<info>(singing)</info> Asking questions in school 
is a great way to learn ...</speak>

<speak who="GRUNKA LUNKA #2">
<info>(singing)</info> ... If you try that stuff 
here you might get your legs broke.</speak>

<speak who="GRUNKA LUNKA #1">
<info>(singing)</info> We once found a dead guy face 
down in the Slurm ...</speak>

<speak who="GRUNKA LUNKA #2">
<info>(singing)</info> ... It could easily happen 
again to you folks.</speak>

<speak who="GRUNKA LUNKAS">
<info>(singing)</info> So keep you head down,

And keep your mouth shut,

Grunka Lunka lunka dunkity dot!

</speak><info>Glurmo leans over the side of the boat and waves his cane.</info>

<speak who="GLERMO">
<info>(shouting)</info> Hey, I don't pay you to sing! 
You just used up today's bathroom break!</speak>

<info>The boat disappears into a tunnel.</info>

<speak who="GRUNKA LUNKA #2">
Hard ass.</speak>

<speak who="GLURMO">
I heard that!</speak>

<info>The Grunka Lunka whimpers and runs away.</info>

<info>Slurm Factory Tunnel. The tunnel is lined with huge barrels 
of Slurm.</info>

<speak who="GLURMO">
Now on your right, you'll see the Slurm 
Master checking the Slurm for colour 
and bouquet.</speak>

<info>An old worm with a long, white beard holds a glass of Slurm. 
Fry watches and licks his lips.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
So thirsty.</speak>

<speak who="GLURMO">
Then he tastes it. He tastes it and 
tastes it, then tastes it some more.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Uh, could I have some Slurm, please?</speak>

<speak who="GLURMO">
No food or drink allowed on the tour. 
You'll have to wait until you're partying 
with Slurms MacKenzie.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
When will that be?</speak>

<speak who="GLURMO">
Soon enough.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
That's not soon enough.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Hey, what's behind that door?</speak>

<info>She points at a door with a "Keep Out" sign on it. It is guarded 
by two worms.</info>

<speak who="GLURMO">
Nothing.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Is it the secret ingredient?</speak>

<info>Five Grunka Lunkas dance across in front of the door.</info>

<speak who="GRUNKA LUNKAS">
<info>(singing)</info> Grunka Lunka dunkity dingredient,

You should not ask about the secret ingredient.

</speak><speak who="BENDER">
OK, OK, we get the point.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
I was just curious because of the armed 
guards.</speak>

<speak who="GRUNKA LUNKAS">
<info>(singing)</info> Grunka Lunka dunkity darmed 
guards--</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
<info>(shouting)</info> Shut the hell up!</speak>

<info>Time Lapse. Fry sneaks to the back of the boat while Glurmo 
talks to Hermes.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
So you're telling me I could fire my 
whole staff and hire Grunka Lunkas at 
half the cost?</speak>

<speak who="GLURMO">
That's right. They think they have a 
good union but they don't. <info>(whispering)</info> 
They're basically slaves.</speak>

<info>Fry leans over the back of the boat but can't quite reach the 
Slurm.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
What are you doing?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
I'm dying of thirst. Grab my feet and 
dunk my head in so I can drink.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
No. That's moronic.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Fine. I'll let go and swim around in 
the Slurm and drink as much as I want. 
Help! I can't swim!</speak>

<info>He disappears under the water and Leela sighs and dives in after 
him. Underwater, she swims towards Fry and pulls him back towards 
the surface by his hair. She comes up gasping for air, followed 
by a gasping Fry, followed by Bender who whistles.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Bender, why did you jump in?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Everybody was doing it. I just wanted 
to be popular.</speak>

<info>A whirlpool sucks them underwater and they scream. They are 
pulled through a hole in the bottom of the Slurm river.</info>

<info>Cut to: Wormulon Cave. The trio fly out of a pipe and land on 
a grate. Slurm pours out of the pipe and into the grate.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Ow!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Where are we?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
And why is the Slurm pouring into this 
sewer?</speak>

<info>Fry wrings some Slurm from his hair into his mouth and spits 
it straight out.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
This isn't Slurm at all!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Something's rotten on the planet Wormulon. 
Look at this.</speak>

<info>On the other side of the cave are two doors. One marked "Real 
Factory" and the other marked "Fake Factory".</info>

<info>Cut to: Slurm Factory Tunnel. Leela quietly opens the fake factory 
door and they peer around it. It is the door from earlier that 
was marked "Keep Out". On the other side one of the worm guards 
smokes while another knits. A Grunka Lunka sleeps and two others 
play poker.</info>

<info>Cut to: Wormulon Cave. She closes it again.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
This all must have something to do with 
the secret ingredient.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
My God. What if the secret ingredient 
... is people?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
No. There's already a soda like that: 
Soylent Cola.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Oh. How is it?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
It varies from person to person.</speak>

<info>Slurme Shoppe. In the gift shop the rest of the staff browse 
the Slurm merchandise available. Amy looks at some worm keyrings 
while Farnsworth looks at an Enjoy Slurm towel.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Ooh!</speak>

<info>On the other side of the shop Glurmo watches Hermes look at 
some worm mugs and Slurm T-shirts. He is already wearing a worm 
blernsball cap. The T-shirt sizes range from S to M to L and 
also Mutant which has four arms. Hermes leaves with his two-armed 
T-shirt and Zoidberg inquires about a two-armed Hebrew Slurm 
T-shirt he is wearing.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Do you have any that aren't so tight 
around the thorax?</speak>

<speak who="GLURMO">
Yes, over in-- Say, weren't there more 
people in your group at the start of 
the tour?</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
Hey, yeah. Fry, Leela and Bender are 
missing.</speak>

<info>Glurmo narrows his eyes.</info>

<speak who="GLURMO">
If you'll excuse me.</speak>

<info>He slides out, leaving a trail of slime behind him. Amy turns 
around with a box of Slurm glasses and slips on the slime and 
falls over and screams. The glasses smash.</info>

<info>Wormulon Cave. Leela, Fry and Bender creep down the dark tunnels. 
They see torchlight up ahead. Bender gasps.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
<info>(whispering)</info> Quick.</speak>

<info>They duck behind a rock. Two guards slide along the roof of 
the cave with a torch and laser. They pass them without seeing 
them and Bender breathes a sigh of relief.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Look! Slurm! Finally!  Oh, yeah! I'm 
never going 12 minutes without a Slurm 
again.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
It's the end of the line. This must 
be where they put in the secret ingredient.</speak>

<info>Behind her is a door marked "Slurm Production Chamber".</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Well, whatever it is, it's even better 
fresh.  Mmm, still warm.</speak>

<info>Leela opens the door.</info>

<info>Cut to: Slurm Production Chamber. They walk in and gasp. In 
the middle of the room is a huge worm wearing a crown and scoffing 
handfuls of Wumpus berries. Some worms massage the middle of 
her body and the secret ingredient comes out the other end of 
her and into Slurm cans.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Ew!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Blech!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Oh, Lordy!</speak>

<info>Fry gulps back some more Slurm.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Fry!  Fry!</speak>

<info>He spits it out again and they watch the Slurm Queen producing 
the drink.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
That's the secret ingredient of Slurm?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
That's the only ingredient of Slurm.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Ew!</speak>

<info>He consoles himself by drinking from the can again. Leela knocks 
it out of his hand and the Slurm Queen turns around and roars. 
She hits them with her back end and they duck out of the way. 
She takes another swipe at Leela and she jumps out the way to 
Fry and Bender. The Slurm Queen takes another swing and they 
run out the door screaming. Fry runs back in to pick up the can 
of Slurm but the Slurm Queen knocks it out of his hands. He groans 
and runs out again.</info>

<info>Cut to: Wormulon Cave. The three run around a corner and guards 
fire their lasers at them. They come to a ravine and nearly fall 
into it.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
I'll save us!  Oh, that feels good!</speak>

<info>They reach the other side and Bender retracts his arms and legs.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Thanks, Bender!</speak>

<info>Bender coughs and Fry and Leela reluctantly hand him some cash.</info>

<info>Time Lapse. They run around another corner.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
The exit! We made it.</speak>

<info>Cut to: Slurm Production Chamber. The "exit" leads back to where 
they began.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Uh, your majesty, I brought the prisoners.</speak>

<info>Fry and Leela turn their heads towards him and Fry smiles. Glurmo 
appears from behind the Slurm Queen.</info>

<speak who="GLURMO">
Well, my curious friends, you learned 
the secret of Slurm. That concludes 
the portion of the tour where you stay 
alive.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
You wish, you slimy worm! Heyya!</speak>

<info>She karate chops Glurmo's head off. The decapitated head grows 
a body and the body grows a head, forming two Glurmos. A guard 
hands the new head a hat. The Glurmos pin Leela to the floor. 
Guards point lasers at Fry and Bender's backs. Bender groans.</info>

<speak who="SLURM QUEEN">
Good work, Glurmo. You have pleased 
your queen.</speak>

<speak who="SMALL GLURMO #2">
Thank you, your majesty.</speak>

<speak who="SMALL GLURMO #1">
Thanks, ma'am.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
How can you trick people into drinking 
something that comes out of your behind? 
It's disgusting.</speak>

<speak who="SLURM QUEEN">
Is it? Honey comes from a bee's behind. 
Milk comes from a cow's behind. And 
have you ever used toothpaste?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Who's behind does that come from?</speak>

<speak who="SLURM QUEEN">
You don't wanna know.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Look, we just came to party with Slurms 
MacKenzie. By the way, when is that 
scheduled?</speak>

<speak who="SLURM QUEEN">
<info>(shouting)</info> Never!  To the torture cave!</speak>

<info>Torture Cave. Bender has been tied to a conveyor belt. It moves 
towards a machine which converts metal into Slurm cans.</info>

<speak who="SLURM QUEEN">
You, my metal friend, will have the 
honour of becoming 174 Slurm cans.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Ah, this trip is turning into a big 
letdown.</speak>

<info>Leela is raised in a harness and suspended over a vat of purple 
goo. The Glurmos stand by a control unit.</info>

<speak who="SLURM QUEEN">
As for you, you will be submerged in 
Royal Slurm which, in a matter of minutes, 
will transform you into a Slurm Queen 
like myself.</speak>

<speak who="SMALL GLURMO #1">
But, your highness, she's a commoner. 
Her Slurm will taste foul.</speak>

<speak who="SLURM QUEEN">
Yes! Which is why we'll market it as 
New Slurm. Then, when everyone hates 
it, we'll bring back Slurm Classic, 
and make billions!</speak>

<info>She and the Glurmos laugh. Small Glurmo #1 pushes a lever down 
and Leela is lowered into the purple Slurm. Fry watches.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
What about me?</speak>

<speak who="SLURM QUEEN">
You are free to go ...</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Yes!</speak>

<speak who="SLURM QUEEN">
... if you can resist this concentrated 
super Slurm!  It's so delicious, you'll 
eat until you explode! Oh, which reminds 
me, put a tarp over that sofa, will 
you? Bon app�tit!</speak>

<info>One of the Glurmos forces a spoonful of the Slurm into Fry's 
mouth. Fry struggles then smiles.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Mmm!</speak>

<speak who="SLURM QUEEN">
Farewell! Oh, and congratulations again 
on winning the contest.</speak>

<info>She and the Glurmos laugh insanely and leave.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Fry, untie us, quick!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Here I come.  Let me just-- One more 
taste.</speak>

<info>He takes three.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
You pig. Stop stuffing your craw and 
save us.</speak>

<info>Fry walks towards her then changes his mind and sticks his head 
into the tub. Bender moves closer to the machine.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
I can't see what's happening. Are we 
boned?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Yeah, we're boned.</speak>

<info>Fry lifts his head out of the tub and looks around. He sees 
Bender then Leela then looks back at the Slurm, A tear trickles 
down his face and splashes into the Slurm.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
I can't stop eating this delicious ooze. 
But I'm not gonna let you die.</speak>

<info>He moves towards the control unit, dragging the tub with him 
and shovelling handfuls of Slurm into his mouth.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Hurry!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
What's happening?  Just in time!</speak>

<info>He looks down and screams. There is a hole in the middle of 
his casing. Fry looks through it. While he is distracted, Leela 
tips the tub of Slurm over and it disappears down a drain.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
<info>(screaming)</info> Nooo!  <info>(talking)</info> I could 
fit if I didn't have these damn arms!</speak>

<info>He starts gnawing at his arms. Leela lifts him up off the floor.</info>

<info>Wormulon Cave. The trio run through the tunnel.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
We're close to the exit. I can smell 
those filthy orange guys.</speak>

<info>Ahead of them is Slurms MacKenzie and the babes.</info>

<speak who="SLURMS">
Stop right there!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Slurms MacKenzie?</speak>

<speak who="SLURMS">
Shh! I want you to take me with you.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Say what?</speak>

<speak who="SLURMS">
I'm partied out. All I want is to stay 
home and rent videos and watch them 
with a few friends. Is that so much 
to ask?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Forget it pal.  It says on this bottle-cap 
you have to party with us.</speak>

<speak who="SLURMS">
Alright, when we get to Earth. But please 
don't invite too many people, I wanna 
keep it small.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
No can do, Slurms!</speak>

<info>He pats him on the back. The cave starts to shake and the Slurm 
Queen bursts through the wall. Everyone screams.</info>

<speak who="SLURMS">
This way!</speak>

<info>He ushers them into another part of the cave. A sign above reads 
"Danger Cave-In Area". The Slurm Queen follows but gets stuck. 
She squirts some Slurm around her body as lubricant and squeezes 
through.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
She's gaining on us.</speak>

<info>Slurms stops running.</info>

<speak who="SLURMS">
Go on without me, I'll hold her off.</speak>

<info>Everyone else stops.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
But she'll crush you like a worm ... 
crushing a smaller worm.</speak>

<speak who="SLURMS">
It's alright. I'm so tired of partying. 
So very tired.  I'll save you the only 
way I know how: By partying!  Babes.</speak>

<speak who="DIXIE">
Yes, Mr. MacKenzie?</speak>

<speak who="SLURMS">
You've served me well these 40 years, 
but this time I've got to party alone.</speak>

<speak who="BABE">
But--</speak>

<speak who="SLURMS">
There'll be other parties for you. Now 
go. Go!</speak>

<info>They run away and Slurms dances and the Slurm Queen closes in. 
The tunnel starts to collapse and Slurms turns the volume up 
to maximum. More rocks fall from the roof. Bender turns around.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Party on, Slurms!</speak>

<info>He salutes.</info>

<speak who="SLURMS">
Party on, contest winners. Party on.</speak>

<info>Bigger rocks falls from above and they pile up in the tunnel. 
One crushes Slurms and he yelps. The Slurm Queen slams into the 
pile of rocks.</info>

<speak who="SLURM QUEEN">
No! We're ruined! They know our disgusting 
secret!</speak>

<info>She cries. The Glurmos arrive in time to see her drinking her 
own Slurm.</info>

<info>The Planet Express ship speeds away from Wormulon.</info>

<info>Cut to: Ships Cockpit. Hermes, Zoidberg and Amy sit on the couch, 
Bender relaxes at his station while Fry and Farnsworth use the 
phone.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Commissioner, my crew has made a horrific 
discovery: It seems that Slurm is produced 
in a colossal worm hiney!</speak>

<info>On the screen, the commissioner sits in his office in front 
of a seal with "Bureau Of Soft Drinks, Tobacco, Firearms" written 
around it.</info>

<speak who="COMMISSIONER">
Hmm, "hiney", you say? Why, with your 
testimony we'll finally be able to outlaw 
this insidious Slurm.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Outlaw Slurm?  Uh, don't pay any attention 
to him sir ...</speak>

<info>Cut to: Commissioner's Office.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
... Grandpa's making up crazy stories 
again.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
I'm not your grandpa, you're my uncle! 
From the year 2000!</speak>

<info>Fry makes the cuckoo gesture.</info>

<info>Cut to: Ships Cockpit.</info>

<speak who="COMMISSIONER">
OK, grandpa, we'll take care of the 
"bad worms," don't you worry.</speak>

<info>He grins and hangs up. Fry opens another can of Slurm.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Ah, I just wish Slurms MacKenzie were 
here to enjoy this with me.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Yeah, that Slurms sure loved to party. 
Whattya say we all party one last time 
for him?</speak>

<info>Leela raises a can.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
For Slurms!</speak>

<info>The rest raise their cans.</info>

<speak who="AMY">
<info>(simultaneously)</info> For Slurms!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
<info>(simultaneously)</info> For Slurms!</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
<info>(simultaneously)</info> For Slurms!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
<info>(simultaneously)</info> For Slurms!</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
<info>(simultaneously)</info> Whammy-wazzle!</speak>

<info>Slurms' music plays and the babes run in from the side and start 
dancing. Bender drinks a can.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Hey, that's not that bad.</speak>

<info>The Slurm trickles out of the hole in his casing. Fry is lying 
on the floor underneath so the Slurm runs straight into his mouth.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Mmm!</speak>

<info>He smiles.</info>

<info>THE END</info></xml>
