                         As we sail down the river of Slurm you'll 
                         see our mix-ologists at work.  They 
                         take 900 of the finest ingredients, 
                         add a touch of child-like delight and 
                         mix it all with glacial spring water 
                         from our glacial spring water generator. 
                          Then, last of all, we add the secret 
                         ingredient that makes Slurm so deliciously 
                         addictive.
