               <note>Planet Express: Lounge. Fry and Bender sit on the couch with 
               their feet up on the table. There are crumbs, Chinese take-away 
               boxes and a burger on the table. A creepy Twilight Zone-esque 
               show starts on the TV. The opening titles are a star field background 
               with various objects flying past the camera.</note>
