<info>Fry's Bedroom. Fry is awoken by squeaking bed springs from the 
apartment next door. He growls.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
I can't take it anymore! They've been 
at it for hours!  <info>(shouting)</info> Give it 
a rest, you two!</speak>

<info>Cut to: Next Door Apartment. The robots next door are sat playing 
poker. They have springy bodies which are constantly squeaking. 
One of the robots oils his springs.</info>

<speak who="ROBOT">
<info>(shouting)</info> Sorry!</speak>

<info>Fry's Bedroom. Fry is asleep.</info>

<info>Fade to: Fry's Dream. He is in a packed lecture hall. An old 
teacher stands at the front of the room. She wears frosted half-moon 
glasses and has grey hair.</info>

<speak who="TEACHER">
Good morning, class. I trust you've 
all prepared for today's final exam.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Uh, excuse me? I missed a few lectures. 
Uh, what subject is this?</speak>

<speak who="TEACHER">
Ancient Egyptian algebra.</speak>

<info>She points to the blackboard, revealing it is filled with Egyptian 
hieroglyphs. Fry gasps.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
What a nightmare!</speak>

<speak who="TEACHER">
Mister Fry, are those your underpants? 
Young man, I think it's time you learned 
a lesson about Lightspeed brand briefs.</speak>

<info>She pulls down a poster showing the briefs.</info>

<speak who="ANNOUNCER">
<info>(voice-over)</info> Lightspeed fits today's 
active lifestyle. Whether you're on 
the job......or having fun... Lightspeed 
briefs. Style and comfort for the discriminating 
crotch.</speak>

<info>Like an advertisement, a pair of lightspeeds appear in front 
of a flashing background.</info>

<info>Cut to: Fry's Bedroom. The dream ends and Fry suddenly wakes 
up.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
What a weird dream! I'll never get back 
to sleep.</speak>

<info>He falls asleep instantly.</info>

<info>Planet Express: Lounge. The crew are sat around the table.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
So you're telling me they broadcast 
commercials into people's dreams?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Of course.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
But, how is that possible?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
It's very simple. The ad gets into your 
brain just like this liquid gets into 
this egg.  Although in reality it's 
not liquid, but gamma radiation.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
That's awful. It's like brainwashing.</speak>

<info>Leela wipes the yolk from her hair.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Didn't you have ads in the 20th century?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Well, sure, but not in our dreams. Only 
on TV and radio. And in magazines and 
movies and at ball games and on buses 
and milk cartons and t-shirts and written 
in the sky. But not in dreams. No siree!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Quit squawking, flesh wad, nobody's 
forcing you to buy anything.</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
Yeah. I mean we all have commercials 
in our dreams but you don't see us running 
off to buy brand name merchandise at 
low, low prices.</speak>

<info>After a long silence they get up and run out.</info>

<info>Alien Overlord &amp; Taylor. A department store. Enter the Planet 
Express staff who are immediately preyed on by a saleswoman at 
the cosmetics stand.</info>

<speak who="SALESWOMAN">
Hi! Care to sample the latest fragrance 
from Calvin Clone?</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
No thanks.</speak>

<info>The saleswoman sprays her. Amy curses in Chinese and walks away 
rubbing her eyes.</info>

<speak who="SALESWOMAN">
And you, sir?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
No thanks I --</speak>

<info>The saleswoman sprays him. Bender sprays her back with oil, 
covering her face. She coughs and splutters.</info>

<info>Time Lapse. Leela is sat on a chair at the cosmetics stand. 
A cosmetologist brushes away her fringe.</info>

<speak who="COSMETOLOGIST">
What a lovely face. We just need to 
draw attention away from the eye area.</speak>

<info>She zaps Leela with something and then holds up a mirror. Leela 
sees her reflection and sighs. The woman has plastered her face 
in lipstick so she looks like a clown. In the menswear department 
Fry picks up a box of the briefs.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Cool.  Can I try these on before I buy 
them?</speak>

<speak who="SALESMAN">
I'm afraid I can't let you open the 
package. But you can try on the demo 
pair.</speak>

<info>He pulls out a pair of smelly underpants and sprays them with 
deodorant.</info>

<info>Fitting Room. Fry puts the briefs and is impressed.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
: Ooh! Ho ho ho!</speak>

<info>He sees his reflection in the mirror - a muscled man surrounded 
by women. Then he sees the notice: Objects In The Mirror Are 
Less Attractive Than They Appear and sighs.</info>

<info>Alien Overlord &amp; Taylor. In the robot accessories department, 
Bender, wearing a green sweater, picks up a few cans of Mom's 
Old Fashion Robot Oil from a pile and hides them under the sweater.</info>

<speak who="AMY">
Hey, Bender! Great new sweater.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
New? What sweater? I came in with it. 
I don't know you people!</speak>

<info>He walks off. A hovering CCTV camera follows him. Back in the 
menswear department, Fry is buying the Lightspeeds.</info>

<speak who="SALESMAN">
$30, please.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
$30? I can't afford that. Unless... 
Do you take Visa?</speak>

<speak who="SALESMAN">
Visa hasn't existed for 500 years.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
American Express?</speak>

<speak who="SALESMAN">
600 years.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Discover card?</speak>

<speak who="SALESMAN">
Sorry we don't take Discover.</speak>

<info>Amy, Leela, Zoidberg and Bender walk up behind him.</info>

<speak who="AMY">
Hey! You're springing for Lightspeed? 
Pretty ritzy!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
No, I can't afford them. Being poor 
sucks. What kind of world is this where 
they advertise things not everybody 
can afford?</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
Quiet. There's an ad coming on.</speak>

<info>On the screens an old woman, the same woman from on the tins 
of oil - Mom - sits in a chair knitting. She is wearing a huge 
green dress and an apron around her front. Behind her on the 
wall is a picture of three men dressed in the same grey clothes.</info>

<speak who="MOM">
Hello shoppers. It's me, Mom!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Hey who's the rocker jockey?</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
Guh! It's Mom. The world's most huggable 
industrialist.</speak>

<speak who="MOM">
Call me old fashioned, but when my 
robot starts to squeak like an old screen 
door well, that's when I reach for a 
can of Mom's Old Fashioned Robot Oil.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Mmm, tasty!</speak>

<speak who="MOM">
And remember: Mom's oil is made with 
10% more love than the next leading 
brand!</speak>

<info>She smiles.</info>

<speak who="ANNOUNCER">"Mom", "love" and "screen door" are 
registered trademarks of Mom Corp.</speak>

<info>The tins under Bender's sweater squeak.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Hey, Bender. Sounds like you could use 
a little of that oil.</speak>

<info>Some tins fall out of Bender's sweater. Seven hovering CCTV
cameras surround him. He looks up at them.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
I'm boned.</speak>

<speak who="SMITTY">
Freeze scuzzbot!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Uh, there's obviously been some sort 
of a mistake here.  I'm sure there's......I 
say I'm sure there's......that is, I'm 
sure there's...a very...reasonable...</speak>

<info>And some more.</info>

<info>Outside New New York Police Department. On a sign outside is 
Ask About Our Generous Brutality Settlements.</info>

<info>Cut to: New New York Police Department. At the front desk Fry 
counts some money.</info>

<speak who="AMY">
Do we have enough money to pay Bender's 
fine?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
78, 79. 79.50. Crud! We're 50 cents 
short.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
I'd love to chip in, but Bender stole 
my wallet.</speak>

<info>Fry sees something through a window, a building called Big Apple 
Bank.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Hey, that's my old bank. Maybe my account's 
still open.</speak>

<info>Big Apple Bank. Fry steps forward to the desk and has a retina 
scanned.</info>

<speak who="TELLER">
Hmm. We don't seem to have your retina 
scan, your fingerprint or your colonic 
map on file.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Yeah, well, I did open the account over 
a thousand years ago. What about my 
ATM card?</speak>

<info>The teller pulls out an old ATM machine from under the desk 
and blows the dust off it.</info>

<speak who="TELLER">
Do you still remember your PIN number?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Sure! It's the price of a cheese pizza 
and a large soda back where I used to 
work, Panucci's Pizza.</speak>

<speak who="TELLER">
OK, you had a balance of 93 cents...</speak>

<info>Fry looks at Amy and Leela.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Alright!</speak>

<speak who="TELLER">
...and at an average of 2 and a quarter 
percent over a period of 1000 years, 
that comes to...$4.3 billion.</speak>

<info>Fry stares for a moment and suddenly starts hyperventilating 
and foaming at the mouth. Then he faints.</info>

<info>Planet Express: Lounge. The crew are gathered in celebration, 
wearing top hats and drinking champagne.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
To Fry.</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
Cheers!</speak>

<info>They raise their glasses.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
I know Fry's rich, but do we really 
have to wear these top hats?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Maybe you don't understand just how 
rich he is. In fact, I think I'd better 
put on a monocle.</speak>

<info>And he does.</info>

<info>Le Spa. Fry lives the high life. At Le Spa Fry and Leela get 
a relaxing massage and Bender gets a buffing.</info>

<info>Famous-Painting-Shooting. Next, Fry and Leela walk down a corridor 
past many famous paintings. Fry stops at the Mona Lisa, points 
to it and buys it. The corridor is just a wall in the open countryside 
with paintings hanging on it. A man loads the painting into a 
catapult and fires it. Fry, Bender and Leela raise their lasers 
and shoot it, blasting it to pieces.</info>

<info>Original Cosmic Ray's Pizza. The Planet Express staff are gathered 
around a table for lunch.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Pizza dinner on me!  Just keep the tab 
under $50 million.</speak>

<speak who="ROBOT CHEF">
Yo!  I haven't got all day. What kind 
of pizza yous guys want?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Uh, yeah. We'll have one with everything 
but anchovies and one with my all time 
favourite topping, anchovies!</speak>

<speak who="ROBOT CHEF">
<info>(mechanical voice)</info> Invalid selection. 
<info>(normal voice)</info> Yo, what are you talking 
about?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Anchovies? You know? Those little headless 
fish?</speak>

<speak who="ROBOT CHEF">
<info>(mechanical voice)</info> Does not compute. 
Does not compute.</speak>

<info>His head explodes.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
I'm sorry, Fry, but the anchovy has 
been extinct since the 2200's.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
What?!</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Oh, my, yes. Fished to death. Just about 
the time your people arrived on Earth 
wasn't it, Zoidberg?</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
<info>(defensively)</info> I'm not on trial here.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
So none of you has ever had anchovies? 
Oh, man! You don't know what you're 
missing. They were all salty and oily 
and they melted in your mouth and --</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Stop! Stop! I admit it! My people ate 
them all! We kept saying "One more can't 
hurt" and then they were gone. We're 
sorry!</speak>

<info>He holds his claws to his head and hangs it in shame. Fry sighs.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
I just wished I could've showed you 
guys how great they were. I may be rich 
but I still can't buy back all the things 
I miss from the 20th century.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Maybe you're forgetting just how rich 
you are.  Huh? Huh?</speak>

<info>Outside Historic 20th Century Apartments. A banner outside advertises 
"With Original Asbestos". On the steps Fry shakes hands with 
the landlord and moves in.</info>

<info>Historic 20th Century Apartment. Amy, Bender and Leela are already 
in there. Amy picks up the telephone is puzzlement and puts the 
receiver over her eyes. Enter Fry.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
So? What do you think?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
I know you spent a lot of money on this 
place, Fry, but it's awfully primitive. 
The floors are made of such hard wood.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Hey! Get a load of this pathetic 20th 
century TV!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
What's wrong with it?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Well, aside from causing eye cancer, 
these things had a lousy low-definition 
picture.</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
That's true. On a TV like this I bet 
you couldn't even make out my obscene 
tattoo.</speak>

<info>She rolls her sleeve up to reveal her obscene tattoo which appears 
blurry. Bender whistles and Leela chuckles.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
That's cute!</speak>

<info>Staadgi &amp; Staadgi Auctioneers. In the crowded room Fry bids 
for something.</info>

<speak who="AUCTIONEER">
Sold!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Yes!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
I just don't get it. Who was this Ted 
Danson? And why would you pay $10,000 
for his skeleton?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
I have an idea for a sitcom.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Ah, leave him alone, Leela. So he's 
going a little wacko with his money. 
It's OK.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
You're just saying that because he bought 
you that antique robot toy.</speak>

<info>Bender chuckles.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Yeah, it is cute.</speak>

<info>He starts playing with a "Knock 'Em, Sock 'Em" toy. One little 
robot punches the other's head off and Bender screams.</info>

<speak who="AUCTIONEER">
Now, our final item: This unopened can 
of Angry Norwegian brand anchovies circa 
1997.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Anchovies?!</speak>

<speak who="AUCTIONEER">
The last known can in existence guaranteed 
fresh and edible. Do I hear $10,000?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
15,000!</speak>

<speak who="MAN">
20!</speak>

<info>A rich Decapodian woman stands up.</info>

<speak who="DECAPODIAN WOMAN">
30! No, 40!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
50,000!</speak>

<info>The other bidders whisper to each other.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Are you crazy? It's a can of old fish.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Don't tell me how to spend my money.</speak>

<speak who="AUCTIONEER">
50 going once, twice...</speak>

<info>He raises his gavel but is interrupted by Mom.</info>

<speak who="MOM">
75,000.</speak>

<info>The room gasps. Mom is stood at the back of the room with the 
three men from the picture in the ad.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Oh, my God, it's Mom! I've never seen 
her in person before.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
100,000.</speak>

<info>More whispering from the bidders.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Fry, you can't bid against Mom. She's 
the richest, most powerful person in 
the world. And she's so adorable.</speak>

<info>Mom looks in her purse.</info>

<speak who="MOM">
Well, I suppose I could go as high as...300,000.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
500!</speak>

<speak who="MOM">
Oh, mercy be. A million.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Two.</speak>

<speak who="MOM">
Six.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
14!</speak>

<speak who="MOM">
I can see the nice young man really 
wants those little fish. Nevertheless, 
I'll bid 23 million.</speak>

<info>Fry stands up and raises his hand.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
One jillion dollars.</speak>

<info>The bidders gasp in shock.</info>

<speak who="AUCTIONEER">
Sir, that's not a number.</speak>

<info>The bidders gasp again.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Oh. In that case, 50 million.</speak>

<info>Mom turns to three men behind her.</info>

<speak who="MOM">
Well, boys, your old mother knows when 
she's been beat.  You win, young man. 
I tip my bonnet to you.</speak>

<info>The other bidders murmur.</info>

<speak who="BIDDER #1">
Isn't she adorable?</speak>

<speak who="BIDDER #2">
Isn't she sweet?</speak>

<info>The auctioneer bangs his gavel.</info>

<speak who="AUCTIONEER">
What a class act! Sold! To the gentleman 
who bought every item in today's auction.</speak>

<info>Fry stands up an cheers himself but the other bidders boo him.</info>

<info>Historic 20th Century Apartment. Fry wanders around the room 
in the dark and picks up a box.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Now for some good old 20th century TV.</speak>

<info>He puts a video tape into the VCR.</info>

<speak who="ANNOUNCER">
Do you remember a time when chocolate 
chip cookies came fresh from the oven? 
Petridge Farm remembers.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Ah, those were the days.</speak>

<speak who="ANNOUNCER">
Do you remember a time when women couldn't 
vote and certain folk weren't allowed 
on golf courses? Petridge Farm remembers.</speak>

<info>A knock at the door.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Fry? Are you there?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Eh?</speak>

<info>Enter Leela and Bender. Fry turns the TV off.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
You haven't been to work in three days. 
What have you been doing?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
I've been sitting right here. I picked 
up my life exactly where I left off 
a thousand years ago. Now if you'll 
excuse me it's 8 o'clock. Time to get 
biz-ay!</speak>

<info>Fry turns the stereo on and listens to Baby Got Back by Sir 
Mix-a-lot. Leela turns it off.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
You can't just sit here in the dark 
listening to classical music.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
I could if you hadn't turned on the 
lights and shut off the stereo.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Fry, this isn't healthy. You're living 
in the past.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
I'm rich! I can live whenever I want.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
But we're your friends and we live here 
in the year 3000.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Yeah. Now are you gonna come to the 
squid fights with us or sit here wallowing 
in your prehistoric junk?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Junk? Maybe you can't understand this 
but I've finally found what I need to 
be happy, and it's not friends: It's 
things.</speak>

<info>He gets up and walks towards the door. Bender turns around.</info>

<speak who="BENDER"><info>(SADLY)</info>
I'm a thing.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Just leave me alone.</speak>

<info>Fry opens the door and Leela and Bender walk out.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Fry please.   My ponytail's caught in 
the door.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
I don't need them. Not when I have my 
antique videos, my bucket of fossilised 
KFC and 50 million dollars worth of 
anchovies.</speak>

<info>He kisses the tin of anchovies.</info>

<info>Mom's Friendly Robot Company Building Corridor. Mom walks towards 
her office, followed by her sons.</info>

<speak who="MOM">
Mercy me, what a day.</speak>

<info>Cut to: Mom's Office.</info>

<speak who="MOM">
Could you shut the door, Igner dear? 
I think I feel a draught coming on. 
Holy crap, that bastard's itchy!  Walt! 
Cream soda!</speak>

<info>Walt is the oldest. He has a full head of black hair.</info>

<speak who="WALT">
Right away, mother.  Larry, get your 
mother a cream soda.</speak>

<speak who="LARRY">
But Mom said --</speak>

<info>Walt slaps him.</info>

<speak who="WALT">
You heard me.</speak>

<info>Mom drinks the can of soda, throws it down then lights a cigarette.</info>

<speak who="IGNER">
What's wrong, Mommy?</speak>

<speak who="MOM">
It's those damned anchovies. That dirtbag, 
Fry, must know their secret. And I won't 
rest until I get my hands on them. No 
one messes with Mom!</speak>

<info>She laughs evily. Walt laughs with her. Larry and Igner join 
in. Walt slaps Larry.</info>

<speak who="WALT">
Quiet, you!</speak>

<info>Time Lapse. Mom is now sat behind a huge desk.</info>

<speak who="MOM">
As you boys know, one of the cornerstones 
of my empire is Mom's Old Fashioned 
Robot Oil. Think of it: 10 billion robots. 
Each one needing an oil change every 
3000 miles. You don't have to do the 
math to know that's a buttload of oil.</speak>

<speak who="IGNER">
Can I wear your fat suit?</speak>

<speak who="MOM">
<info>(shouting)</info>: No, Igner, put that down.</speak>

<info>Igner drops the fat suit arm.</info>

<speak who="IGNER">
Aww.</speak>

<speak who="WALT">
What does this have to do with the anchovies?</speak>

<speak who="MOM">
I'm getting to the freaking anchovies. 
A single drop of the anchovies natural 
oil would lubricate 10 robots permanently.</speak>

<speak who="LARRY">
Wow, it's a shame they went extinct.</speak>

<speak who="MOM"><info>(SHOUTING)</info>
No it isn't, shut your filthy trap! 
<info>(talking)</info> Thank you, Walt. If anyone 
ever got a hold of anchovy DNA, they 
could chop out the oil-making gene, 
stick it in a bunch of third world kids 
and bam! Cheap effective robot oil. 
Enough to put dear old Mom out of businness.</speak>

<speak who="WALT">
My God! This Mr. Fry must be a mastermind 
of the highest order.</speak>

<info>Cut to: Historic 20th Century Apartment. Fry is sat in the dark 
watching Sanford &amp; Son.</info>

<speak who="FRED">
Esther, you ugly!</speak>

<info>Fry laughs.</info>

<info>Cut to: Mom's Friendly Robot Company Building: Mom's Office.</info>

<speak who="MOM">
We have only one option: We'll have 
to bankrupt Mr Fry, so he'll be forced 
to sell the anchovies to us.</speak>

<speak who="WALT">
Mother, you are one clever old skag!</speak>

<speak who="MOM">
And don't you forget it!</speak>

<speak who="LARRY">
But how are we supposed to get Fry's 
money out of the bank?</speak>

<speak who="MOM">
That part will be easy, thanks to the 
nice people at Mom's Old Fashioned Video 
Surveillance Unit.</speak>

<info>She puts another tape in. The scene at Big Apple Bank replays 
on the TV.</info>

<speak who="TELLER"><info>ON TV</info>
Do you still remember your PIN number?</speak>

<speak who="FRY"><info>ON TV</info>
Sure! It's the price of a cheese pizza 
and a large soda back where I used to 
work, Panucci's Pizza.  It's the price 
of a cheese pizza and a large soda --</speak>

<info>Mom turns the TV off.</info>

<speak who="MOM">
You know what needs to be done.</speak>

<speak who="LARRY">
What?</speak>

<speak who="MOM"><info>(SHOUTING)</info>
Get his PIN number, you idiots!  <info>(talking)</info> 
Now I'm off to some chairty BS for knocked-up 
teenage sluts.</speak>

<info>Historic 20th Century Apartment. There is a knock at the door.</info>

<speak who="WALT"><info>FROM OUTSIDE</info>
Mr. Fry. It's those three plumbers you 
called for.</speak>

<speak who="LARRY"><info>FROM OUTSIDE</info>
We're here to tighten your drains.</speak>

<info>The sounds of Walt's hand meeting Larry's face is heard. Fry 
opens the door.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
I didn't order any --</speak>

<info>Walt and Igner jump on Fry and pin him to the floor.</info>

<speak who="WALT">
Quick! Give him the tranquilliser.</speak>

<info>Larry puts some tablets in Fry's mouth and strokes them down 
his throat.</info>

<speak who="LARRY">
That's a good boy.</speak>

<info>Fry falls unconscious.</info>

<info>Pizzeria Set. Fry comes around and sees a disguised Walt wearing 
a fake handlebar moustache.</info>

<speak who="WALT">
Wake up, Mr. Fry.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Where am I?</speak>

<speak who="WALT">
You're in the good old year 2000, working 
here at Panucci's Pizza. You fell asleep 
on the job.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
That sounds like me but, I thought I 
got frozen. Wasn't I in the future?</speak>

<speak who="WALT">
No, you only "dreamed" you were in the 
year 3000.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
So I'm really back? That's exactly what 
I wanted, I guess. Who are you?</speak>

<speak who="WALT">
I'm Mr. Panucci.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
You are? Did you grow a moustache since 
last night?</speak>

<speak who="ANDERSON">
Hurry up, please. I wanna get back to 
the head museum.</speak>

<speak who="LARRY">
Don't worry, Miss Anderson, this won't

back in the year 2000 and your head's 
still on your body, and you want a cheese 
pizza.</speak>

<info>He picks up the jar and puts it on Igner's head.</info>

<speak who="FRY">

<info>Walt, Larry, Igner and Anderson laugh. Fry is unsure of what

<info>The limo speeds off and Fry blacks out into a dream.</info>

<info>Cut to: Fry's Dream. Pizza's, 1077's and anchovy tins float 
around him. Leela's and Bender's heads float towards him.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Oh, I had a nightmare I was in the year 
2000 and you guys never existed. I'm 
so glad I'm awake now and you're really 
here.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Since when do you care about us?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
We thought you only cared about cans 
of anchovies and stuffy old songs about 
the buttocks.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
No, that's not true!</speak>

<info>Leela and Bender float away.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Goodbye-eee!</speak>

TV.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Bender! Leela! Don't leave me. Wait 
a minute! Hey, buddy what year is this?</speak>

<speak who="REPOBOT">
Uh, 3000.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
3000? Yes! I'm still in the future! 
Life is wonderful!  Wait! What are you 
doing with my stuff?</speak>

<speak who="REPOBOT">
Uh, check bounced. We're taking it all 
back.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Oh, no, my ATM card! My secret PIN number! 
1077. I've got nothing left. Except...</speak>

<info>Planet Express: Lounge. Leela and Bender are sat on the couch 
and Farnsworth is sat at the table.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
You're Fry's relative. Do you have any 
idea how he got so crazy?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Uh, wha? Oh, yes, they say madness runs 
in our family. Some even call me mad! 
And why? Because I dared to dream of 
my own race of atomic monsters. Atomic 
supermen with octagonal-shaped bodies 
that suck blood out of...</speak>

<info>He walks out still blabbering. Enter Fry.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Leela! Bender! I missed you so much!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
You did? What happened?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
I was robbed. They got everything except 
these.</speak>

<info>He holds up the anchovies.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Who did?</speak>

<speak who="MOM">
Hello, Fry.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
It's Mom.</speak>

<speak who="MOM">
I felt terrible when I heard about your 
money troubles and I thought maybe I 
could help out a sweet young man by 
buying his anchovies.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Sorry. But the anchovies aren't for 
sale.</speak>

<speak who="MOM">
What? Listen, you little bastard. I 
control the robot oil business and I 
won't let you ruin me. How much do you 
want?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
You might as well put that chequebook 
away, because I've discovered something 
even more important. My friends. And 
they aren't worth even a penny to me. 
That's why these anchovies are going 
on a pizza, so I can share the food 
I love with the people I like.</speak>

<speak who="MOM">
Holy hell! You're going to eat them? 
Oh, well. Just make sure you eat them 
all. You're a growing boy. Toodle-oo! 
Dumb ass!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
What a nice lady!</speak>

<info>Time Lapse. The whole staff except for Zoidberg are gathered 
around the table. Fry opens the tin of anchovies.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
OK, my friends. Get ready for the most 
delicious extinct animal you've ever 
tasted.</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
I don't know, I've had cow.  Ew! Gross!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Ah, no one likes them at first but they'll 
grow on you.</speak>

<info>Enter Zoidberg. He sniffs.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
That stench. That heavenly stench!  
More!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
There aren't any more. And there never 
will be.</speak>

<info>Zoidberg tips the table over and moves towards Fry, raising 
his claws.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
More! More! More! More!</speak>
