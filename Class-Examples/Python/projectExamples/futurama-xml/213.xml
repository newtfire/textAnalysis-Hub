                         Hey everyone jam a sock in your spit 
                         faucets.  Not long ago I spent my lonely 
                         nights renting slash flicks with Rat 
                         Man and his girlfriend. But then a beautiful 
                         woman arrived and - stop eating pig! 
                         And she brought new hope for me and 
                         our once great civilisation. Now a million 
                         centuries of Cyclops destiny depend 
                         on the answer to one question......Leela, 
                         will you marry me?
