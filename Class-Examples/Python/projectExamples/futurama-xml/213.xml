<info>Outside Planet Express. The Mailbot pushes the mail through 
the letterbox.</info>

<info>Cut to: Planet Express: Entrance. Nibbler barks as the letters 
come through the letterbox. They hit him and he runs away scared.</info>

<info>Cut to: Planet Express: Meeting Room. He runs in, runs around 
the table and is trodden on by Farnsworth who has just come through 
another door.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Good news everyone! Several years ago 
I tried to log on to AOL, and it just 
went through! Wheee! We're online!</speak>

<info>Planet Express: Farnsworth's Lab. The crew climb into what looks 
like some VR suits.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Go ahead! Get into these net suits. 
I designed and tested them myself.</speak>

<info>Leela sniffs her glove.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
It smells like burning recess monkey.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Really? I guess when you're around it 
all day you stop noticing. Off you go.</speak>

<info>He presses a button and the crew disappear into the web.</info>

<info>Cut to: Outside Internet Browser. The crew have turned green 
and are holographic.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Hey!</speak>

<info>He puts his arm through himself and laughs. He ties his arms 
in knots.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Behold! The internet!</speak>

<info>He presses the enter button and a white light engulfs the crew.</info>

<info>Cut to: Internet Browser. The crew stand on a Tron-like clifftop.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
My God! It's full of ads!</speak>

<info>The ads caw like birds and dive at the crew � la Alfred Hitchcock's 
The Birds. Amy and Zoidberg scream as the ads flutter around 
them. Hermes limbos out the way of one. Leela kicks the No Way 
and No buttons on the ads. One chases Bender around. Another 
flies at Fry and wraps itself around him. Leela pulls him free.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Follow me!</speak>

<info>The rest of the crew follow her and they fly off the clifftop 
towards the internet.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
It's immense.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
It's got every piece of information 
anyone could ever want.</speak>

<info>Fry sees the porn sites.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
So I see!</speak>

<info>He flies down to the porn sites and Bender and Hermes follow 
him.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
What? What's going on here?</speak>

<info>He sees a sign advertising Sardine On Mackeral Action, warbles 
and flies towards it.</info>

<info>Time Lapse. The crew wander around the porn infested internet. 
Amy sees a site called Amy Wong Naked. She pokes her head through 
the door.</info>

<speak who="AMY">
Hey, that's me!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
No it isn't. I just took some pictures 
of your face and stuck them on someone 
else's body.</speak>

<info>Leela sticks her head into the website.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Hey!</speak>

<info>Outside Adult Chatrooms. The crew join the queue. At the front 
of the queue several underage kids dressed as adults go in.</info>

<speak who="MAN">
Are you over 18?</speak>

<speak who="KID">
Yes.</speak>

<speak who="YOUNGER KID">
Yes.</speak>

<info>A baby spits its dummy out, gurgles and walks in.</info>

<info>Adult Chatrooms.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
I'm telling you Fry they've got a chatroom 
for everybody. And here it is.</speak>

<info>He and Fry walk into a Filthy Filthy Chatroom.</info>

<speak who="AMY">
Ew, that is so gross!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Yeah. I'll stick with this one thank 
you.</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
Yeah.</speak>

<info>They walk into a plain ordinary Filthy Chatroom.</info>

<info>Filthy Filthy Chatroom. Bender looks around chuckling. He pulls 
down a menu and selects a sexy nurse disguise. He taps a man 
on the shoulder.</info>

<speak who="BENDER"><info>(SEXFULLY)</info>
Hi, I'm a naughty nurse and I really 
need someone to talk to. 9.95 a minute.</speak>

<speak who="MAN #2">
Ooo, you're a dollar naughtier than 
most.</speak>

<info>He hands "her" some cash and Bender pockets it.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
So how 'bout them Knicks?</speak>

<info>Filthy Chatroom. Amy sits at a bar and a man makes a winky smiley 
face at her. She groans.</info>

<speak who="NERD #1">
Hello? Are there any girls in this room 
at all?</speak>

<speak who="NERD #2">
Yeah, bring on the hot chicks 'cause 
I'm a hot stud.</speak>

<speak who="NERDS">
Yeah!</speak>

<speak who="NERD #3">
So are we!</speak>

<info>Leela pushes her way to the centre of the crowd.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
I'm a woman if that's what you mean. 
I don't like to play games so I'll 
just say I'm a cyclops, I'm a spaceship 
captain, I'm the only one of my species 
and I'm interested in meeting a man.</speak>

<speak who="NERD #4">
A woman. I'm scared.</speak>

<info>Internet Browser. The crew fly away from the chatrooms.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Well, thanks to the internet, I'm bored 
with sex. Is there a place on the web 
that panders to my lust for violence?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER"><info>(SARCASTIC)</info>
Is the space pope reptilian?</speak>

<info>Outside Death Factory III. The crew walk towards a colluseum-like 
gaming zone.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
Get ready for fun Fry. Nowadays we have 
a type of game played entirely on video.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
We call it a "video game."</speak>

<speak who="FRY"><info>(SARCASTIC)</info>
Uh, "video game" you say? Well golly 
gee, you mighty spacemen of the future 
will have to show me how it works.</speak>

<info>Death Factory III. Fry has pretty much got the hang of the game. 
He runs around the death factory, laughing and dodging machines 
and shooting lasers from his fingers. He rolls under some squashy 
things, shoots some crates, shoots Donkey Kong and swings away 
on a rope. Amy shoots at him but misses. He shoots back and she 
shatters like glass. Another nerd shoots at him and Fry shoots 
back and shatters him. Hermes puts his finger to Fry's head but 
Fry leaps into the air, spins around and shatters Hermes. Bender 
and Leela shoot at him. Zoidberg slides down a rope chasing Fry 
and shooting.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
The doctor is in!  The doctor is out.</speak>

<info>He shatters. Farnsworth's head appears in the game.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Everyone please sign off, we have a 
delivery. Plus I have to use the phone 
-  Leela please tell the others that 
-</speak>

<info>She shoots him. She kicks Bender into a machine and goes through 
the workings � la Modern Times. He comes out the other end like 
a slinky. He rolls down some steps and into some boiling lava. 
Farnsworth appears again and before he can speak Leela and Fry 
shoot him. Fry shoots at Leela but misses. She shoots back and 
he ducks behind a machine. Leela folows him warily. Someone backs 
into her and she screams and turns around. It is another cyclops.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Who are you?</speak>

<speak who="CYCLOPS">
I saw you in the chatroom but you left 
before I had a chance to talk to you. 
After all these years of searching for 
another Cyclops.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
I can't believe it. I've dreamed of 
this moment all my life.</speak>

<speak who="CYCLOPS">
Do you think perhaps you and I - ?</speak>

<info>Fry shoots and shatters the Cyclops. He laughs and ducks behind 
a machine.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Fry, you idiot. Ever since I was abandoned 
on Earth I've been searching for who 
my people are and where they come from. 
Then I finally meet another Cyclops 
and you blast him. You wrecked my one 
chance to learn who I am.</speak>

<info>Fry slowly walks behind the machine, finger at the ready.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Oh Leela. I feel terrible. If there's 
anything I can ever do -  Gotcha!  I 
won! I'm the greatest!</speak>

<info>Cut to: Planet Express: Farnsworth's Lab. Everyone else has 
taken off their netsuits. Fry is still in his, jumping around 
and laughing like an idiot.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Come on. We have worked to do.</speak>

<info>She pulls his goggles away and snaps them back.</info>

<info>Ship's Cockpit. Leela doesn't speak to Fry.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Are you still mad at me for wrecking 
your once in a lifetime chance to learn 
the meaning of your existence?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
No, I'm just happy you were able to 
win a video game. Now lets concentrate 
on getting this desperately needed popcorn 
to the people of Cineplex 14 OK?</speak>

<info>The video screen comes down from the ceiling.</info>

<speak who="VOICE">
Leela, you've got mail.  It's not spam!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Huh?  It's him!</speak>

<speak who="CYCLOPS"><info>ON SCREEN</info>
To: Leela. Subject: Hello. I am Alkazar. 
Fortunately I wrote down your screenname 
before I was dispatched by that oaffish 
moron.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Kicked your ass!</speak>

<speak who="ALKAZAR"><info>ON SCREEN</info>
Leela we have much to discuss. Please 
come join me on the planet of your birth. 
Co-ordinates follow.</speak>

<info>Some co-ordinates appear on the screen and the email ends.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Too bad we gotta make that urgent popcorn 
delivery.</speak>

<info>She thinks about it and pulls a lever.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
It'll get there.</speak>

<info>Cut to: Outside Ship. The cargo bay hatch opens and a crate 
of popcorn flies out. She ship turns around and flies away. The 
popcorn crate explodes and forms a spiral of popcorn.</info>

<info>Ship's Steps. The ship has landed on Planet Cyclopia, the door 
opens and the crew look at the planet. Ruins of a city with vines 
climbing them greet them.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
After a whole life of searching I may 
finally have found where I belong.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Too bad it's a dump.</speak>

<info>Cyclopian Surface. Leela, Fry and Bender make their way through 
the vines and arrive in the middle of a city.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Look at that statue. It's only got one 
eye.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Lazy sculptor!</speak>

<speak who="ALKAZAR">
Welcome home Leela.</speak>

<info>She turns around. He is standing on a baclony.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Alkazar?  Are you real? Or am I seeing 
single?</speak>

<info>She pokes him in the eye.</info>

<speak who="ALKAZAR">
Ow! Of course I'm real!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
After all this time. Somebody else with 
one eye who isn't a clumsy carpenter 
or, uh, a kid with a BB gun.</speak>

<info>They hug.</info>

<speak who="ALKAZAR">
It's alright Leela. You'll never be 
alone again.  Let me introduce you to 
yourself.  Do you mind if your servants 
walk?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Not at all!</speak>

<info>The lizards pull them away. Bender steals the crown from the 
top of the statue and chuckles.</info>

<info>Time Lapse.</info>

<speak who="ALKAZAR">
We are the last remaining Cyclopses. 
Our planet is Cyclopia. This is our 
capital, Cyclops City. Stop me if I'm 
going too fast for you.</speak>

<info>Leela looks around.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
There's so much information and yet 
somehow I feel as if I know it all already.</speak>

<speak who="ALKAZAR">
This sacred mosaic depicts our goddess 
of beauty.</speak>

<info>The mosaic looks like Botticelli's The Birth of Venus.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Hmm, you got any sacred artwork of her 
from the back?</speak>

<speak who="ALKAZAR">
Her perfect eye reminds me of yours 
Leela. Had our race survived, you would 
have been a temple priestess or a supermodel.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Oh please! Really?</speak>

<info>The carriage moves on. Bender takes the jewel from the middle 
of the mosaic eye.</info>

<info>Time Lapse. Alkazar shows them another statue.</info>

<speak who="ALKAZAR">
And there's the pirate Purple Beard, 
scourge of the six seas.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
What's over that hill?</speak>

<speak who="ALKAZAR">
The Forbidden Valley. A holy sancturary 
where no one may tread.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Is that anything like a cemetary 'cause 
I gotta take a leak.  Ow!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Fry, that's offensive to our people. 
Isn't it?</speak>

<info>He nods and she slaps Fry again.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Ow!</speak>

<info>Outside Alkazar's Castle.</info>

<speak who="ALKAZAR">
This is my home. I hope you don't think 
less of me because I live in a giant 
castle.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Oh no not at all. If anything, I'm more 
impressed.</speak>

<info>Cut to: Alkazar's Castle. He throws open the doors. The castle 
is full of jewels. Bender's eyes zoom in.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Ooo! I'm gonna need to make some room!</speak>

<info>He opens his chest cabinet and takes out a goldfish bowl, a 
toaster, and another two goldfish bowls.</info>

<info>Cut to: Alkazar's Bedroom.</info>

<speak who="ALKAZAR">
In here's where I dream my lonely dreams 
and cook my simple meals.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
It's all so sad. What happened to our 
people?</speak>

<info>Alkazar looks at her and moves over to the window and looks 
out. A tear trickles down his face.</info>

<speak who="ALKAZAR">
Its too painful to speak of now. Come, 
I'll show you your quarters.</speak>

<info>They leave. Bender sees a sword on the wall, checks no one is 
look and swallows it. The sword is a little too long and Bender 
can't walk properly. He clanks as he walks out.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Ow!  Ow!  Ow!</speak>

<info>Leela's Quarters. It is the middle of the night. Leela hears 
Alkazar crying and wakes up. She gets up and goes out to him.</info>

<info>Cut to: Alkazar's Balcony. Leela puts her hand on his shoulder.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
I heard you from my room. What's wrong?</speak>

<speak who="ALKAZAR">
It's just - no Leela. I don't want to 
see tears in your perfect eye.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Please, is it bout the fate of our people? 
Because I'm very interested in that.</speak>

<speak who="ALKAZAR">
Well OK. But it's chilly and you're 
going to be all wet from the tears. 
Let's go into my chamber.</speak>

<info>They walks inside.</info>

<info>Alkazar's Bedroom. Leela and Alkazar are sat on Alkazar's bed. 
Alkazar tells the story.</info>

<info>Flashback. Cyclops City is a thriving community with families, 
fountains and buskers.</info>

<speak who="ALKAZAR"><info>(VOICE OVER)</info>
It wasn't long ago. Our people were 
happy and prosperous...</speak>

<info>The flashback cuts to a dark planet with rocky terrain and lots 
of large molehills.</info>

<speak who="ALKAZAR"><info>(VOICE OVER)</info>
...but the eyeless mole people of Subterra 
3 grew jealous of our visual proness. 
They fired missile in all directions 
hoping to hit Cyclopia.</speak>

<info>A mole man presses a button and several hundred missiles are 
launched from the planet.</info>

<speak who="ALKAZAR"><info>(VOICE OVER)</info>
Unfortunately, one of the 40 planets 
hit, was ours.</speak>

<info>On Cyclopia a Cyclopian scientist looks through a telescope 
at the sky.</info>

<speak who="CYCLOPIAN">
How far away do you think it is?</speak>

<speak who="SCIENTIST">
A trillion miles?</speak>

<info>The missile lands right behind them and explodes.</info>

<info>Flashback ends.</info>

<speak who="ALKAZAR">
Things got hot. You look a little hot, 
you can take off that jacket.  Our people 
don't like to be hot. Anyway, just before 
the impact...</speak>

<info>Flashback. In a Cyclopian hospital a doctor delivers a baby.</info>

<speak who="ALKAZAR"><info>(VOICE OVER)</info>
Our smartest scientists managed to save 
one baby</speak>

<info>The doctor puts the baby in a rocket and the parents wave it 
goodbye.</info>

<info>Flashback ends.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Alkazar, I used to be a baby, it might 
have been me!</speak>

<info>Flashback. Cyclops City is in flames.</info>

<speak who="ALKAZAR"><info>(VOICE OVER)</info>
Fortunately I was employed as a pool 
cleaner at the time and when I emerged 
from retrieving a dead possum, I found 
I was the only one left.</speak>

<info>Alkazar sees the flames, screams, and falls to his knees in 
a very overdramatic way.</info>

<info>Flashback ends.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
It's so tragic.</speak>

<speak who="ALKAZAR">
Yes, but the real tragedy is that our 
race ends with us.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
It doesn't have to.</speak>

<speak who="ALKAZAR">
What do you mean?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
You're a male and I'm a female.</speak>

<speak who="ALKAZAR">
I'm still not following you.</speak>

<info>She pushes him onto the bed and kisses him.</info>

<info>Time Lapse. Morning has broken. Leela and Alkazar are in bed. 
Alkazar is asleep. Leela wakes up.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Wake up my king.</speak>

<info>Alkazar wakes up and coughs.</info>

<speak who="ALKAZAR">
Oh jeez what a night. Make me some coffee 
would you.</speak>

<info>He puts his head back on the pillow.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Uh, sure OK. What do you take with that?</speak>

<speak who="ALKAZAR">
Pancakes and sausage. Kitchen's in the 
basement, pans are in the attic.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Maybe after breakfast we can talk about 
rebuilding our civilisation.</speak>

<info>Alkazar snores loudly.</info>

<info>Alkazar's Dining Room. Fry and Bender eat with Leela and Alkazar. 
Fry eats a pancake.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Mmm! Great pancakes Leela!</speak>

<speak who="ALKAZAR">
Yeah they'll come in handy if I need 
to cover any tiny manholes.  Listen 
hun, we don't want to look like slobs 
in front of the other species do we?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
No.</speak>

<speak who="ALKAZAR">
So get to work on these dishes. And 
then organise my collection of naked 
celebrity photos by name and what you 
can see.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Look Alkazar.</speak>

<speak who="ALKAZAR">
Call me Al.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Look Al. I know you've been living alone 
a long time and I can sympathise but 
I'm not your maid.</speak>

<speak who="ALKAZAR">
You're right, I'm sorry. It looks like 
the relationshipisn't going to work 
afterall. So much for the Cyclops race. 
I thought it was a pretty good race 
but -</speak>

<info>Leela gets up.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
OK OK, I'll do the dishes.  Hey where'd 
they go?</speak>

<info>Bender walks out clanking...</info>

<info>Outside Alkazar's Castle. Fry and Bender watch Leela pegging 
out the washing.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Ah, Leela's experiencing the greatest 
joy a woman can feel: Worshipping some 
lowlife jerk.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
He may be some lowlife jerk but I don't 
trust him. I think he's hiding something 
and I'm gonna find out what it is.</speak>

<info>Outside Forbidden Valley. Fry strolls up to the gate and reads 
the No Trespassing sign. He laughs.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Try and stop me!</speak>

<info>He hops over the gate and a trap door opens underneath him and 
he falls down a deep hole.</info>

<info>Alkazar's Living Room. Alkazar is sat on a couch staring at 
a TV. Enter Leela dressed up like Peg Bundy from Married...With 
Children.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Al? I did my hair the way you wanted 
it.  Who are these people?</speak>

<info>There is a pig, a rat man and a rat woman sat on another couch.</info>

<speak who="ALKAZAR">
Friends.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Hey, where'd you get this couch and 
that TV set and all this stuff?</speak>

<speak who="ALKAZAR">
They were giving it away on the street 
corner. Just like you Leela.</speak>

<info>Alkazar's friends cheer and hoot.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Too bad they weren't giving away the 
three things you actually need: Mouthwash, 
a back wax and stain-proof underwear.</speak>

<info>More hooting.</info>

<speak who="RAT WOMAN">
You go girl!</speak>

<speak who="ALKAZAR">
By the way your pal Fry fell into the 
dungeon. Feed him a taco so he doesn't 
die and stink up the place.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Come on Al, can't you let the little 
guy out?</speak>

<speak who="ALKAZAR">
Jeez Leela, twice in one day? I'm not 
Superman!</speak>

<info>The rats and pig cheer widly. Leela leaves.</info>

<info>Outside Dungeon. Leela crouches down to a little barred window 
which Fry is behind. He eats his taco.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Why were you sneaking into my people's 
forbidden valley?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
'Cause I think Alkazar's hding something. 
Listen Leela, you may not like it, you 
may not believe it, you may not wanna 
hear it but Alkazar's a jerk, he's bad 
for you. He -</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
I know.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
You do?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Fry if it's obvious to you with your 
learning disability then of course it's 
obvious to me! He's crude and gross 
and he treats me like a slave.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Then dump his one eyed ass.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
I can't. If I leave Alkazar then that's 
the end of the Cyclops race. And I won't 
let that happen. Even if that means 
a lifetime of unhappiness.</speak>

<info>A toilet flushes.</info>

<info>The pig and rats hoot.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
I'll break up with him at dinner.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
I'll be there.</speak>

<info>Time Lapse. Fry is at dinner. The table is right next to his 
window.</info>

<speak who="ALKAZAR">
Yo Leela, what gives? Pig says your 
slop tastes like crap.</speak>

<speak who="PIG">
Yeah, like crap.</speak>

<info>Fry tugs Leela's leg.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
C'mon Leela you deserve better than 
this guy! Dump him already!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
I'm trying.</speak>

<info>Alkazar taps his glass.</info>

<speak who="ALKAZAR">
Hey everyone jam a sock in your spit 
faucets.  Not long ago I spent my lonely 
nights renting slash flicks with Rat 
Man and his girlfriend. But then a beautiful 
woman arrived and - stop eating pig! 
And she brought new hope for me and 
our once great civilisation. Now a million 
centuries of Cyclops destiny depend 
on the answer to one question......Leela, 
will you marry me?</speak>

<speak who="FRY"><info>(WHISPERING)</info>
No! No!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Yes! I Will!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Ohh!</speak>

<info>The table applauds. Alkazar and Leela kiss. Rat Woman elbows 
Rat Man.</info>

<speak who="RAT WOMAN">
They're getting married!</speak>

<info>Rat Man looks surprised.</info>

<info>Outside Alkazar's Castle. A limo pulls up and Amy, Farnsworth, 
Zoidberg and Hermes climb out.</info>

<speak who="AMY">
Congratulations Leela!</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Hello!</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
Oh this is great!</speak>

<info>Pre-Wedding Chug-A-Thon. Everyone helps themselves to the buffet. 
Leela puts a decoration on top of the wedding cake of a Cyclops 
woman buffing a Cyclops man's shoes. Fry attracts her attention.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Pst, Leela. you've got to get me out 
of here. It's horrible, eating scraps, 
letting my waste drop wherever it falls 
like an animal in the zoo.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Animals go in the corner.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
The corner! Why didn't I think of that?</speak>

<info>Leela sighs.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Look Fry I'd like to help you but it's 
my wedding and I'm kind of busy.  Here, 
try to be happy for me. That way at 
least one of us will be.</speak>

<info>Cut to: Dungeon. Leela walks away from the window.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
That's it! It's time for this bird to 
walk.</speak>

<info>He hits the bottle against the door trying to get it open. The 
cork flies out of the bottle, out of the dungeon and hits the 
door release button. The door opens. Fry laughs and tip the bottle 
over his head. The door starts to close again. He screams and 
scrambles through it.</info>

<info>Cut to: Outside Alkazar's Castle. Fry runs out and looks around. 
Bender is leaning against a tree. Rope is holding his door shut 
because its so full of stuff he's stolen. There is also a sack 
next to him. Fry sees him.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Bender come on. We've got to get some 
dirt on Alkazar. Lets go and find out 
what makes the Forbidden Valley so forbidden.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Uh no thanks I'm good.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
But there's probably some cool forbidden 
stuff you can steal.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
I don't know Fry. For the first time 
in my life I feel like I've stolen enough.</speak>

<speak who="ALKAZAR">
Well, this is the real me. But I can 
explain. We all have needs. Mine was 
to make it with five weirdos and have 
them scrub my five castles. I gave you 
all what you wanted and of course I 
made a few bucks letting Pig watch through 
the two way mirror. Can any of you sa 
you wouldn't have done the exact same 
thing in my position?</speak>

<info>Bender cries.</info>

<speak who="BENDER"><info>(CRYING)</info>
He's a saint!</speak>

it costs to rent a tux that changes 
shape?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Alright Alkazar, I just have one last 
question for you.</speak>

<speak who="ALKAZAR">
What's that?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
If you can change form, why didn't you 
change it in the one place that counts?</speak>

<info>Everyone cheers and hoots.</info>

<info>Ship's Cockpit. The ship flies away from the planet, with Amy 
at the controls. Bender admires his sack of loot. Leela sits 
on the arm of the couch with Fry and Farnsworth.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Thanks for saving me from that creep 
Fry.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Hey, that's what I do.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
I guess I was so desperate to find out 
who I really was, I forgot who I really 
was.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
No harm done. In the many decades you'll 
work to repay me for that shipment of 
popcorn you destroyed, you'll have plenty 
of time to search for your true home.</speak>

<info>Leela gets up and stares out of the window.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Yeah. I mean, how many planets can there 
be?</speak>

<info>She looks out into the vastness of space and the ship glides 
away.</info>
