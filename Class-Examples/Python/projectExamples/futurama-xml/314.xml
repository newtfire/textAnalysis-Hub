               barbecuing and fishing. The Planet Express crew are there. Hermes

                         So, Leela, how about a romantic ride 
                         in one of those swan boats? They're 
                         kinda dangerous but I finally mastered 
                         them.

                         Leela, I want you to know I think the

                         really wonderful. I got you something.

                         Perhaps we could explode the whole damned 
                         nebula. What do you think, Curly Joe?

                         No, man. An explosion big enough to 
                         destroy that mama would take out half 
                         the universe.

                         By God, Sweet Clyde is right. An implosion 
                         might just form a black hole that would 
                         stop more Chronitons from escaping.
