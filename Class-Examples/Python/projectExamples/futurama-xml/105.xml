<info>Ships Cockpit. Fry and Leela are standing in front of the couch 
looking out of the windscreen into open space.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
What do you think of the view, Fry?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
It really puts things in perspective. 
I mean, from up here an entire world 
can seem utterly insignificant.</speak>

<info>A small planet splats onto the windscreen like a fly onto a 
car. Leela presses a button and the windscreen wiper cleans it 
off.</info>

<info>Opening Credits. Caption: Featuring Gratuitous Alien Nudity.</info>

<info>Madison Cube Garden Pitch. The crew are sat watching what could 
be a baseball game between the New New York Yankees and the Mars 
Greenskins...</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Hey, nice seats! We're close enough 
to when you knock a player down with 
a beer bottle, he stays down.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
I don't get this. Is blernsball exactly 
the same as baseball?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Baseball? God forbid!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Face it, Fry. Baseball was as boring 
as mom and apple pie. That's why they 
jazzed it up.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Boring? Baseball wasn't -- hmm, so they 
finally jazzed it up?</speak>

<info>A player hits the ball. Fry jumps up, cheering.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Home run! Ha ha! Yay! Right?</speak>

<info>The ball is attached to a piece of elastic and springs back. 
A player catches it and the momentum carries him so he flies 
through the air with the ball. He reaches out and hits a base.</info>

<speak who="UMPIRE">
Out!</speak>

<info>The crowd cheers and Leela writes on her scorecard.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
What just happened? Why is the ball 
on that springy thing?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
It's traditional. Just like aluminium 
bats and the seventh inning grope.</speak>

<info>Another hit. A player jumps to catch the ball but misses it 
and is caught by Bender.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
I got me a souvenir!  Aww, here you 
go, kid!</speak>

<info>He hands the player to the boy.</info>

<info>Madison Cube Garden Corridor. Zoidberg comes out of the Gents 
and approaches a vendor.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
I'd like a jumbo squid log, please.</speak>

<speak who="VENDOR">
We don't sell those.</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Alright, alright. Let me have one of 
your young on a roll.</speak>

<speak who="VENDOR">
We're outta rolls.</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Fine! Just give me something crawling 
with parasites.</speak>

<info>Cut to: Madison Cube Garden Pitch. Back in the bleachers, Zoidberg 
eat a hotdog and purrs. The others have hotdogs too. Fry takes 
a bite.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Mmm, at least hotdogs haven't changed.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Hey, buddies, who wants popcorn?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA"> Oh, I'll have some.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Me!</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Oh, yes!</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Yes, please, popcorn!</speak>

<info>Popping noises come from Bender's chest cabinet. He opens it 
and takes out a large tub of popcorn.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Anyone want butter on that?</speak>

<info>He pumps his antenna.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Hey, I'm starting to get the hang of 
this game. The blerns are loaded, the 
count's three blerns and two anti-blerns 
and the infield blern rule is in effect, 
right?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Except for the word "blern" that was 
complete gibberish.</speak>

<info>Something beeps. The blernsball falls into a hole and some things 
come up in the pitch. The crowd cheers.</info>

<speak who="MAN">
Multi-ball!  Multi-ball!  Blern! Blerrrn!</speak>

<info>Another player rides a hover-cycle around the pitch with the 
bases exploding behind him. A bullpen opens and someone comes 
out riding a huge spider. Fry scratches his head in confusion. 
Leela writes on her score card.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Alright! Yes! Miller's on a pace to 
hit 70 blerns!</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
He's good, alright. But he's no Clem 
Johnson. And Johnson played back in 
the days before steroid injections were 
mandatory.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Clem Johnson? That skin bag wouldn't 
have lasted one pitch in the old Robot 
Leagues! Now Wireless Joe Jackson, there 
was a blern hitting machine!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Exactly! He was a machine designed to 
hit blerns! I mean, come on, Wireless 
Joe was nothing but a programmable bat 
on wheels.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Oh, and I suppose Pitchomat 5000 was 
just a modified howitzer?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Yep.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
You humans are so scared of a little 
robot competition you won't even let 
us on the field.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
What are you talking about? There's 
all kinds of robots down there.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Yeah, doing crap work! They're bat boys, 
ball polishers, sprinkler systems. But 
how many robot managers are there?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
11?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Zero!  And what a surprise! Look who's 
scraping up the filth. Is it a human 
child? I wish!</speak>

<info>Farnsworth suddenly leans forward, clutching his chest.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Oh, dear Lord!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
What's wrong?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
It's...my...new pager.</speak>

<info>He takes his pager out of his lab coat and turns it on. A holographic 
image of Hermes appears in front of him.</info>

<speak who="HOLOHERMES">
This is Hermes. A package just came 
in. Everyone is to return to the office 
immediately.  Get away, you filthy bird! 
Shoo! Shoo! Professor, turn me off, 
quick!</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
I'm sorry, wha?</speak>

<info>Holo-Hermes screams. The bird takes off with him and carries 
him towards the roof.</info>

<speak who="HOLOHERMES">
<info>(shouting)</info> See you at the office!</speak>

<info>Planet Express: Meeting Room. The staff are sat around the table.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Admit it: You all think robots are just 
machines built by humans to make their 
lives easier.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Well, aren't they?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
I've never made anyone's life easier 
and you know it!</speak>

<info>Enter Farnsworth and a bandaged Hermes, who holds a box with 
a Planet Express label on it and "Chapek 9" written on it.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Great news, everyone. You'll be delivering 
a package to Chapek 9, a world where 
humans are killed on sight.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Why is that great news?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
I'm glad you asked that question, Fry. 
You see, Chapek 9 was colonised centuries 
ago by a murderous crew of radical robot 
separatists.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Oh, so just 'cause a robot wants to 
kill humans that makes him a "radical"?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Hey, hold on. I understand these robots 
hate humans, but how do they feel about 
humanoid aliens?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
They're not fans.</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
That's why Bender will have to make 
the actual delivery.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Oh, I get it, make the robot do all 
the work!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
This is the first actual work you've 
ever had to do around here.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Well I'm not doing it! It's a robot 
holiday.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Really? Which one?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Only Robanukah. The holiest two weeks 
on the robot calendar.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Oh, come on, Bender. Last month it was 
Robomadom and before that Robonza.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Man, that one was a blast!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
It wasn't just a blast. It was a sacred 
tribute to my ancestral prototypes which 
happened to take the form of a drinking 
contest.</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
Now, look here, Bender. I respect your 
diversity to the extent the law requires 
but you used up all your days off when 
you had that bout with Roberculosis.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Alright, I'll go. But so help me, I'll 
hold a grudge against every last stinking 
one of you for the rest of your lives.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Well then it's settled. So long, everyone!</speak>

<info>Ships Cockpit. The ship approaches Chapek 9.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
So let me get this straight: This planet 
is completely uninhabited?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
No. It's inhabited by robots!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Oh. Kinda like how a warehouse is inhabited 
by boxes.</speak>

<info>Bender mutters to himself.</info>

<info>The ship hovers above the surface of Chapek 9. The cargo bays 
bomb-bay doors open.</info>

<info>Ships Cargo Bay. Leela holds a remote control to operate the 
magnetic winch.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
OK, Bender, we're here. It's time to 
get to work.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Yes, Miss Leela. Tote that space barge, 
lift that space pale.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Now we can't land on the surface because 
those robots will kill Fry and me. So 
we'll have to stay up here and lower 
you with the winch. And remember: You 
don't know humans, you don't work for 
humans, and, above all, you don't like 
humans.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
<info>(ironic)</info> I'll try to keep that in mind!</speak>

<info>He steps on the winch and Leela lowers it to the ground.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Hmm, he seems pretty angry.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Yeah, but I guess I'd be kinda angry 
too if I had to go to some uninhabited 
planet.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Maybe we ought to do something nice 
for him.</speak>

<info>Ships Cockpit. Leela and Fry have decorated it with banners, 
paper bending unit chains and a beer bottle Menorah.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
There! This oughta show that stupid 
robot we care about him.</speak>

<info>The phone beeps.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Ah, Bender must be done with the delivery.</speak>

<info>Leela answers the call. Bender's face appears on the screen.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
I'm in trouble. They found out I work 
with humans and -- oh, no! Oh, no!</speak>

<info>He screams and is dragged off into the darkness. The phone cuts 
to static.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Oh, my God! We have to go down and rescue 
him.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
No, we can't! They'll kill us on sight.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
W-what are we gonna do?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
I don't know! I don't know! It's not 
an easy decision. If only I had two 
or three minutes to think about it.</speak>

<info>Ships Cargo Bay. Fry and Leela are dressing up in boxes and 
things.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
OK. If we're going to save Bender, we've 
got to look and act exactly like robots.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
<info>(mechanical voice)</info> I am fully operational, 
captain.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
We'll have to walk like robots, talk 
like robots and, if necessary, solve 
complex differential equations like 
robots.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
I can sorta dance like a robot. Will 
that help?</speak>

<info>He sort of dances like a robot. Leela sighs.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Fry, first of all this is serious. And 
second of all:</speak>

<info>She dances like a robot.</info>

<info>Cut to: Chapek 9 Surface. Fry and Leela lower themselves to 
the surface on the winch and come face to face with a huge robot 
complex. They walks towards it and Fry sees his reflection in 
the colander Leela is wearing on her head.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Man, we look stupid. We should've gotten 
store-bought costumes.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Yeah, but there wasn't a Woolworth's 
in this quadrant.</speak>

<info>Cut to: Outside Robot complex. They reach the gates of the complex 
but are stopped by two huge robot guards.</info>

<speak who="GUARDBOT #1">
Halt!</speak>

<speak who="GUARDBOT #2">
Be you robot or human?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Robot...we be.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Uh, yup! Just two robots out roboting 
it up!  Eh?</speak>

<speak who="GUARDBOT #1">
Administer the test.</speak>

<speak who="GUARDBOT #2">
Which of the following would you most 
prefer? A: A puppy, B: A pretty flower 
from your sweetie, or C: A large properly-formatted 
data file?</speak>

<speak who="GUARDBOT #1">
Choose!</speak>

<info>Fry and Leela whisper to each other about the answer.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
<info>(whispering)</info> C!  <info>(talking)</info> Is the puppy 
mechanical in any way?</speak>

<speak who="GUARDBOT #2">
No. It is the bad kind of puppy.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Then we'll go with that data file.</speak>

<speak who="GUARDBOT #2">
Correct.</speak>

<speak who="GUARDBOT #1">
The flower would also have been acceptable.</speak>

<speak who="GUARDBOT #2">
You may pass.</speak>

<info>The guardbots fold up like transformers and move to the side 
of the gates. Fry and Leela enter the complex.</info>

<info>Cut to: Robot Complex. Fry and Leela walk down an empty corridor.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Now if you see any robots, just stay 
out of their way.  <info>(shouting)</info> So far, 
so good.</speak>

<info>Time Lapse. A robot construction worker is giving directions 
to a robot crane which is building a Tetris wall.</info>

<speak who="CONSTRUCTIONBOT">
Little to the right, there you go.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Have you seen this robot?</speak>

<info>She shows him a picture of Bender dressed as a magician pulling 
a rabbit out of a hat.</info>

<speak who="CONSTRUCTIONBOT">
Sorry, can't help you.  Hey, watch it! 
Don't drop that there!  Oh!</speak>

<info>Time Lapse. Fry and Leela walk past a sign that says "got milk? 
then you're a human and must be killed".</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Come on, Fry, walk like a robot.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
I can't. I have to go to the bathroom.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Robots don't have bathrooms.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Oh, right. I wonder where they smoke 
in high school.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Listen. Just go behind those garbage 
cans. I'll stand guard.</speak>

<info>Fry does. A robot approaches Fry.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Hurry up, Fry!</speak>

<speak who="ROBOT">
Sir? Are you aware that you're leaking 
coolant at an alarming rate?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Uh...</speak>

<speak who="ROBOT">
Lemme just patch you up with some hot 
resin.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
I think the leak's stopping itself. 
Wait. Wait. Yeah, there we go. Wait. 
Yeah!</speak>

<speak who="ROBOT">
What sort of robot turns down a free 
blast of searing-hot resin?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
I'm sorry. My friend and I have to go 
and perform some mindless repetitive 
tasks.</speak>

<info>The robot chuckles.</info>

<speak who="ROBOT">
Sounds like a romantic evening. I won't 
keep you.</speak>

<info>The robot zooms away and churns up dust. Leela sneezes. The 
robot turns around and growls. Leela kicks it over and she and 
Fry run off. An anti-human patrol van comes and picks up the 
robot.</info>

<speak who="PATROL OFFICER #1">
Get the humanoid.</speak>

<speak who="PATROL OFFICER #2">
Get the intruder.</speak>

<speak who="ANNOUNCER">
Intruder alert! Intruder alert!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Quick! Let's duck in here!</speak>

<info>They run into a cinema <info>(Now Showing: It Came From Planet Earth)</info>.</info>

<info>Cinema Auditorium. The movie showing is similar to the popular 
horror movies of the 1950's complete with all-American college 
boy and his beautiful yet naive girlfriend. Both robots. The 
robot audience is wearing 3-D glasses.</info>

<speak who="ANNOUNCER">
We interrupt this sound file to bring 
you a terrifying announcement: A non-metallic 
being has been sighted in the vicinity 
of Make Out Point.</speak>

<speak who="RUSTY">
Say, Wendy. Your chassis is a little 
scuffed. Mind if I polish it for you?</speak>

<info>The bushes rustle.</info>

<speak who="WENDY">
Did you here that, Rusty? It sounded 
like a human.</speak>

<speak who="RUSTY">
Relax, Wendy. Humans will never come 
to our defenceless little town. Its 
perfectly safe to let our guard down 
-- even for a second.</speak>

<info>A human - actually a robot actor wearing a human costume - appears 
out of some bushes. Wendy screams and it growls, tears off Rusty's 
head and eats it.</info>

<speak who="HUMAN">
I will eat and digest you all with 
my system of mighty organs. Behold!</speak>

<info>It opens itself up revealing human organs. The audience gasps.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Wow, the 3-D's great!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Mine's not working.</speak>

<info>She moves the 3-D glasses back and forth over her eye. In the 
movie the "human" stumbles around, breathes fire and finally 
collapses. It has an arrow in its back. Wendy and an army robot 
approach it.</info>

<speak who="ARMY ROBOT">
Funny, isn't it? The human was impervious 
to our most powerful magnetic fields, 
yet in the end he succumbed to a harmless 
sharpened stick!</speak>

<info>He pulls the stick out of the "human" and chuckles.</info>

<speak who="WENDY">
I'm just glad the nightmare is over.</speak>

<speak who="ARMY ROBOT">
It'll never be over, Wendy. Even now 
humans are lurking in our playgrounds, 
our breezeways, perhaps even...our movie 
theatres!</speak>

<info>He points into the camera at the audience. They scream.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
God help us!</speak>

<info>Outside Cinema. The movie has ended and the robots are filing 
out.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
OK. Keep an eye out for Bender.</speak>

<speak who="ROBOT #1">
So, what did you think of the movie?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Umm, too much romance, not enough human 
killing.</speak>

<speak who="ROBOT #2">
Yeah, it was a real chick flick.</speak>

<info>A loud fanfare.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
What's that?</speak>

<speak who="ROBOT #1">
What do you mean "What's that?"? It's 
5 o'clock: Time for the daily human 
hunt.</speak>

<info>The robots all take out pitchforks, maces and fire torches and 
file off in the same direction. Fry and Leela follow.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Try to stay with the crowd so no one 
notices how crummy you look.</speak>

<info>She is talking to a robot that looks like Fry disguised as a 
robot.</info>

<speak who="ROBOT #3">
Aww, that was uncalled for!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
I'm over here.</speak>

<info>The robots congregate around a platform.</info>

<speak who="ROBOT #4">
I heard a human was draining coolant 
behind garbage can 738.</speak>

<speak who="ROBOT #5">
I heard they unscrew our lug nuts at 
night and eat them at their human brunches.</speak>

<speak who="ROBOT MAYOR">
Welcome to a very special human hunt. 
We have with us today a guest who's 
irrational hatred for humans makes me 
look like a human sympathiser!  A newly-arrived 
refugee from Earth, lets hear it for...Bender!</speak>

<info>Bender emerges from the shadows and stands at the microphone.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
It's him! He's OK!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Death to humans!</speak>

<info>The crowd cheers.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Ahh! It's good to hear his voice!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Many said I was too extreme when I first 
called for the annihilation of the human 
species, as well as some of the more 
cunning monkeys. But after living on 
Earth I can tell you that I am, if anything, 
too merciful!</speak>

<info>The crowd cheers.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
My God! He's become evil.  I mean eviler!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Thank you! Thank you! And if you enjoyed 
that diatribe then you'll want to purchase 
my spoken word album, just 18.95! Act 
now and you'll get this Bender action 
figurine.</speak>

<info>He pulls the string</info>

<speak who="BENDER FIGURINE">
Bite my shiny metal ass!</speak>

<info>The robots wave cash.</info>

<speak who="ROBOT #6">
<info>(shouting)</info> Oh, I want one!</speak>

<info>Bender takes the money and hands out the figurines from a box.</info>

<speak who="ROBOT MAYOR">
Let the hunt begin!</speak>

<info>Robots rush off with clubs and start to hit bushes and look 
under rocks.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Now, your basic human is between three- 
and 25-feet tall and is made of a hairy, 
oily goo wrapped in a t-shirt.</speak>

<speak who="ROBOT #1">
Is it true they bite your neck, suck 
your transmission fluid and then you 
become a human?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Sure, why not?</speak>

<info>They look in some bracken.</info>

<speak who="ROBOT MAYOR">
Anything in the trap?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Nothing. Today's active humans prefer 
a low-calorie bait.</speak>

<speak who="ROBOT MAYOR">
Well that makes 146,000 unsuccessful 
hunts in a row. But I've got a good 
feeling about tomorrow.</speak>

<info>Bender sees a building.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Wait! What's that?</speak>

<speak who="ROBOT MAYOR">
That's the old abandoned adult book 
store. Nothing in there except a few 
mouldy old shreds of robot pornography.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Hmm, sounds like a breeding ground for 
humans. I'd better check it out.</speak>

<info>Adult Book Store. Bender is looking at robot porn - circuit 
diagrams.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Oh, yeah! You're a bad girl, aren't 
you?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Psst! Bender!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Huh? Wha? You! What the hell are you 
doing here?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
We've been looking for you. Last we 
heard you were under arrest as a human 
sympathiser.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
I was. But they let me go when I told 
them I killed a million billion humans.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Good for you. Now let's all get back 
to the ship.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
What for?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
We're rescuing you.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
I don't wanna be rescued.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Say what?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
I love this planet. I've got wealth, 
fame and access to the depths of sleaze 
that those things bring.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
But, Bender, we're your friends.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Friends? That activates my hilarity 
unit! I'm just a machine to you. You're 
no more friends with me than you are 
with the toaster or the phonograph or 
the electric chair.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
That's not true.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Well that's how it feels to me.</speak>

<info>There is an awkward silence.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Bye, Bender. I'll miss you.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Go on, get out of here before you get 
caught.</speak>

<info>Enter the Robot Mayor and some other robots.</info>

<speak who="ROBOT MAYOR">
Bender, good news: Your album just went 
gold! What the?</speak>

<speak who="ROBOT #1">
It's the humans!</speak>

<speak who="ROBOT MAYOR">
Bender! Do something!</speak>

<info>Bender grabs Fry and Leela.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Uh...got you...you murderous flesh piles!</speak>

<info>Robot Hall of Justice. Fry and Leela are in a cage. The judge 
is a Mac computer.</info>

<speak who="ROBOT MAYOR">
Your Honour, I intend to demonstrate 
beyond 0.5% of a doubt that these humans 
before us are guilty of the crime of 
being humans. Come to think of it, I 
rest my case!</speak>

<speak who="JUDGE">
Thank you, prosecutor. I will now consider 
the evidence.</speak>

<info>He begins to consider. A blue bar moves across his screen.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Hey, wait a minute! Isn't anyone going 
to defend us?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Yeah! I mean he might not have a case 
but I'm genuinely not a human.</speak>

<speak who="ROBOT MAYOR">
Quiet, human!</speak>

<info>The judge stops considering. A prompt box shows up on his screen: 
Sorry A System Error Occured [Restart</info> The court gasps in shock.]

<speak who="ROBOT BAILIFF">
Uh-oh! He froze up again!</speak>

<speak who="ROBOT MAYOR">
Try control alt delete.</speak>

<speak who="ROBOT #1">
Jiggle the cord.</speak>

<speak who="ROBOT #2">
Turn him off and on.</speak>

<speak who="ROBOT #3">
Clean the gunk out of the mouse.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Call technical support.</speak>

<speak who="ROBOT BAILIFF">
OK, OK, he's back online.</speak>

<speak who="JUDGE">
I find the defendants - guilty!</speak>

<info>The court cheers.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
No!</speak>

Look! One eye! Count them: One! Not

<speak who="JUDGE">
The humans are hereby sentenced to live 
as robots live on Earth. They will perform 
tedious calculations and spot-weld automobiles, 
until they become obsolete and are given 
away to an inner-city middle school.</speak>

<info>The court cheers again.</info>

<speak who="ROBOT MAYOR">
Great work, Bender! You've taught us 
to hate humans all over again!</speak>

<info>Bender chuckles and sighs. The bailiff pulls a lever and Fry 
and Leela fall through the floor.</info>

<info>Cut to: Room. It is pitch black. Fry and Leela hit the floor.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Are you alright?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Oh, yeah.</speak>

<info>The lights come on. Fry is upside down. They are sat before 
five tall robots. Leela gasps.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Who are you?</speak>

<speak who="BLUE ELDER">
We are the robot elders.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
You don't look very old.</speak>

<speak who="BLUE ELDER">
Thanks. We try to take care of ourselves.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
What's going on here?</speak>

<speak who="RED ELDER">
Silence! Bring in Bender.</speak>

<info>The doors open. Enter Bender.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Alright, let's make this quick, I'm 
due at the opening of a mini-mall. Hey! 
What is this?</speak>

<speak who="BLUE ELDER">
Silence! It is time to put the humans 
to death.</speak>

<info>Fry and Leela gasp.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
But the judge already sentenced us at 
the trial!</speak>

<speak who="RED ELDER">
Silence! That was just a show for the 
public. We are the true rulers of this 
planet, hand carved from meteorites 
by the Robot Founders over four centuries 
ago.</speak>

<speak who="BLUE ELDER">
Silence! Come forward Bender. You will 
have the honour of executing the prisoners.</speak>

<speak who="GREEN ELDER">
Silence! I concur!</speak>

<speak who="YELLOW ELDER">
Here: Use the ceremonial killer-ma-jig.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Uh, I'm a little tired right now. Would 
it be alright if I just gave 'em a savage 
beating?</speak>

<speak who="BLUE ELDER">
No! The Elders have spoken. Show us 
the killing skills than have made you 
a media darling.</speak>

<speak who="GREEN ELDER">
Do it now! Kill them before they bring 
down our whole society!</speak>

<speak who="ELDERS">
<info>(chanting)</info> Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! 
Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do 
it! Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Aww!  I can't kill them. Plenty of humans 
have mistreated robots but not these 
two. They're my friends. Humans are 
no threat to us. They're stupid, putrid 
cowards.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Damn right!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
The fact is, humans are completely harmless.</speak>

<speak who="BLUE ELDER">
We're well aware of that.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
You are?</speak>

<speak who="BLUE ELDER">
Of course. But they're useful to us 
as a scapegoat to distract the public 
from their real problem.</speak>

<speak who="GREEN ELDER">
Like our crippling lug nut shortage.</speak>

<speak who="ORANGE ELDER">
And a corrupt government of incompetent 
Robot Elders.</speak>

<speak who="YELLOW ELDER">
Duh, that's for sure.</speak>

<speak who="BLUE ELDER">
Quiet, Jimmy.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Well, I'm glad we got all that out in 
the open. We'll just let ourselves out.</speak>

<speak who="GREEN ELDER">
Silence! You all know too much.</speak>

<speak who="BLUE ELDER">
Elders: Execute function, control, shift, 
kill!</speak>

<info>They form a line and sharp things come out of their arms. They 
move towards Fry, Leela and Bender who back away. Fry suddenly 
leaps forward.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Stop! Take one more step and I'll breathe 
fire on you!</speak>

<info>The Elders exchange glances.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
He'll do it. He's crazy!</speak>

<speak who="YELLOW ELDER">
Can they really breathe fire or did 
we make that up?</speak>

<speak who="BLUE ELDER">
Gee, I can't remember anymore! It might 
just be from that stupid movie.</speak>

<speak who="ORANGE ELDER">
Was that the original or the re-make?</speak>

<info>The crew sneak away.</info>

<speak who="BLUE ELDER">
I don't -- hey! They're getting away.</speak>

<info>Chapek 9 Surface. Outside the robot complex, Fry, Leela and 
Bender run towards the winch with hundreds of robots chasing 
them. They jump onto it and Leela presses the button.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
So long, suckers!  Uh, hello, suckers!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Hey, hold on a second, I forgot to deliver 
the package.</speak>

<info>He hands the parcel to a robot. It loses its balance and falls, 
along with the rest of the robots. The parcel bursts open.</info>

<speak who="ROBOT #7">
Lug nuts! Precious lug nuts!</speak>

<speak who="ROBOT #8">
Hooray for the humans!</speak>

<info>Ships Cockpit. The ship speeds out of orbit of Chapek 9. Bender 
sees the decorations.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Wow, I can't believe you guys did all 
this for me! This is the best Robanukah 
ever!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
We wanted to show you that we really 
do respect your robot heritage.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Aww, thanks! You do know that I made 
Robanukah up to get out of work, right?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Of course.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
But that doesn't make it any less meaningful.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
In that case, let the dancing begin! 
Hey, you guys are good. How the hell 
do you do that?</speak>

<info>The crew enjoy the party and take several photos of the occasion.</info>

<info>THE END</info></xml>
