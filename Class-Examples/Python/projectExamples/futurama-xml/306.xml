                         Hmm. I'm not quite sure. Perhaps seeing 
                         things from a new perspective has reminded 
                         me of life's beauty. Or perhaps my new 
                         posture is causing blood to pool in 
                         the back of my brain, resulting in a 
                         mild delirium. Incidentally, you have 
                         a dime up your nose.

                         That's right, baby. I ain't your lover 
                         boy, Flexo, the guy you love so much. 
                         You even love anybody pretending to 
                         be him.
