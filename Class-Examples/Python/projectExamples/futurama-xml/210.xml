                         Really? Y'know I heard that banking 
                         industry regulations are really very 
                         simple.

                         Oh, no, that's not true. You see, modern 
                         banking regulations are a product of 
                         five different regulatory traditions. 
                         Six if you wanna get technical.

                         It all began in 1410 when a number of

                         There you are, good as new. Except for 
                         your dorsal fin, I'm afraid I couldn't

                         I still don't understand why you wouldn't

                         So, uh, thanks for the ride, Amy. And 
                         I hope there are no hard feelings about 
                         your date, or stuff.

                         It's OK, I had fun. And if I ever feel 
                         lonely I can just look over at this 
                         disfiguring scar and think of you.

                         Seems to be. My neck's just a little
