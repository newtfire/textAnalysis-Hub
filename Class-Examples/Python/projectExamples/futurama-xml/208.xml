                         Thank you, thank you. Let's get started. 
                         Max, play me over.  Looks like someone 
                         forgot to feed Max.  So, people are 
                         getting pretty worried about this Y2K 
                         problem, huh?

                         Pine trees have been extinct for 800 
                         years, Fry. Gone the way of the poodle 
                         and your primitive notions of modesty.

                         Back in 2801, the Friendly Robot Company 
                         built a robotic Santa to determine who'd 
                         be naughty and who'd been nice and distribute 
                         presents accordingly. But something 
                         went wrong.

                         Wait, you fool! Due to a programming 
                         error, Santa's standards were set too 
                         high and he invariably judges everyone 
                         to be naughty.

                         The important thing is we're all together 
                         for Xmas. And even though I'm surrounded 
                         by robots and monsters and old people, 
                         I've never felt more at home.
