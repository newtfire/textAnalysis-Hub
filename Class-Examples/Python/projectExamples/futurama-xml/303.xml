<info>Ship's Cockpit. The ship is in the Planet Express hangar and 
Fry and Bender are messing around in the cockpit. Fry flies a 
scale model of the ship around and makes whoosh-y noises, then 
a crackling radio noise.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Giant Space Robot, this is Captain Fry 
of the USS Planet Express Ship; We come 
in peace.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Tough luck!</speak>

<info>He takes a hammer out of his chest cabinet and knocks the ship 
out of Fry's hands. It lands on the floor and Bender smashes 
it to bits. He and Fry laugh.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Well, we destroyed the toy spaceship. 
Now what are we gonna do?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Hey, look! The keys to the real spaceship.</speak>

<info>Fry sees the keys in the ignition and turns to Bender.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Do you think we should?</speak>

<info>Bender stands up.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
<info>(firmly)</info> Yes, I do.</speak>

<info>Cut to: Planet Express: Kitchen. At the conference table Zoidberg 
reads a book, Hermes sits with an iMac in front of him and Amy 
eats something with chopsticks. In the kitchen, Leela finishes 
washing a "Universe's #1 Space Pilot" mug and puts it next to 
Fry's "Universe's #4307697 Delivery Boy" mug.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Leela, have you seen the keys to the 
spaceship?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
I must've left them onboard.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Eh, wha'? I mean, what?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Relax. The ship's not going anywhere. 
I anchored it with the unbreakable diamond 
tether.</speak>

<info>The ship begins to rumble and slowly rises into the air. Leela 
and Farnsworth gasp.</info>

<info>Cut to: Planet Express: Hangar. The coil of diamond tether starts 
to run out as the ship gets higher.</info>

<info>Cut to: Planet Express: Meeting Room.</info>

<speak who="AMY">
Oh, no!</speak>

<info>She talks in Martian.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
Sweet ghost of Babylon.</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
This isn't good for Zoidberg!</speak>

<info>Cut to: Outside Planet Express. The ship emerges from the hangar 
and flies away. The tether tightens and the ship struggles, eventually 
ripping the building from it's foundations.</info>

<info>Cut to: Ship's Cockpit.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Woo, yeah!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Woo-hoo!</speak>

<info>They laugh.</info>

<info>Cut to: Planet Express: Hangar. The other five fly through the 
air and hit the back wall.</info>

<info>St. Louis. The ship flies under the Gateway Arch and loops the 
loop several times. The Planet Express building spins around 
it and the crew scream from inside.</info>

<info>San Francisco. The building skims the surface of the water by 
the Golden Gate Bridge.</info>

<info>Great Wall of China. The Chinese ignore the ship as it flies 
over. Seconds afterwards, the building crashes through the wall 
and the Mongols ride over it, wielding swords.</info>

<info>Cut to: Ship's Cockpit. Fry sits with his feet on a console 
while Bender literally flies by the seat of his pants.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Hey, Fry, I'm steering with my ass!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
That's the best thing I ever saw!</speak>

<info>Pisa. The ship knocks the Leaning Tower upright and the locals 
shout angrily at them and wave their fists.</info>

<speak who="ITALIAN #1">
You stink!</speak>

<info>The building hits it and knocks it at an angle again and the 
Italians cheer.</info>

<speak who="ITALIAN #1">
Alright, yeah!</speak>

<speak who="ITALIAN #2">
We like you a lot!</speak>

<info>The Leaning Tower topples and crushes some of them.</info>

<info>New New York City. The ship flies past the Statue of Liberty 
and over Manhattan before lowering the building back onto its 
foundations and landing in the hangar.</info>

<info>Cut to: Planet Express: Hangar. The place is a tip. Fry and 
Bender walk down the ship's steps, laughing.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
That was great!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
And no one suspects a thing!  Whoa! 
And that's how we learned our lesson!</speak>

<info>Fry hides behind him and nods.</info>

<info>Time Lapse. Farnsworth berates them.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
You've gone too far this time - all 
three of you!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
What did I do?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
You left the keys in the ignition. I 
mean, look at those two. Wasn't it obvious 
what would happen?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Yeah, Leela.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
We're all very disappointed in you.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
I should fire you three right now, but 
I'm just not that cold-hearted.</speak>

<info>He whispers something to Hermes.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
You're all fired.</speak>

<info>The others' jaws drop.</info>

<info>Outside Planet Express. The three former employees leave through 
the main door. Zoidberg, Amy, Hermes and Farnsworth watch them 
go.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Goodbye, friends. I'll miss you.  Good 
riddance to them. Now Zoidberg is the 
popular one!</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Yes, yes! Let's all talk to Zoidberg.</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
Hey, Dr. Zoidberg, I've been thinking. 
Do you think we could go out?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
So, Zoidberg. What's new?</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
Tell me, Zoidberg: Is it carapace or 
carapass?</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Oh, you know...!</speak>

<info>Park. The jobless Fry, Leela and Bender sit on a bench.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
What are we supposed to do for money? 
All I've got is my frequent taffy eater's 
card, my first moustache......and this 
picture of me and my old girlfriend, 
Michelle, and that ski instructor she 
was just friends with.</speak>

<info>In the photo the ski instructor has his arm around Michelle 
while Fry leans into the photo, waving. Bender unscrews his head 
and holds it out like a bucket to a passing man.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Pardon me, brother. Care to donate to 
the Anti-Mugging-You Fund?  Ow!</speak>

<info>She puts his head back on.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
We don't need to beg, Bender. For God's 
sake, we're not veterans!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Well, what do you suggest? A daring 
daylight robbery of Fort Knox on elephant-back? 
That's the dumbest thing I ever heard!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
No, we can get jobs.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
But we just had jobs!</speak>

<info>Leela opens her backpack.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Fortunately, I still have our old career 
chips.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Our what?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Career chips.  You remember? They assign 
you the job you're best at.  I tried 
to give you one and you ran away.  It's 
how we met!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
And then what happened?</speak>

<info>She sighs.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Just give me your hand.</speak>

<info>She clips him with her implant gun.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Ow!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Baby!  Ow!</speak>

<info>Applied Cryogenics: Ipgee's Office. Leela reapplies to the company 
with the motto "It Seems To Work OK" at exactly 3pm. Fry and 
Bender are with her.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
I'd like to reapply for my old job: 
Counselling defrostees and assigning 
them careers.</speak>

<speak who="IPGEE">
Oh, I was hoping you would come back! 
I even saved your poster of a chimp 
expressing your distaste for Mondays.</speak>

<info>He takes the poster out of his drawer. It has a picture of a 
monkey wearing a tie on it. Above, "I Hate Mondays" is written.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Monday Monkey lives for the weekend, 
sir.</speak>

<speak who="IPGEE">
Just put your hand under the scanner 
so I can verify your career chip.  Calcutta, 
we have a problem.</speak>

<info>"Career: Delivery Boy" is on the screen.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Delivery boy? I must have mixed up the 
chips. It's a simple mis -</speak>

<info>Ipgee scans Fry's chip.</info>

<speak who="IPGEE">
Oh, here's a cryogenic counsellor! Do 
you like Mondays?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
They're OK.</speak>

<speak who="IPGEE">
Then we'll have to redecorate your office. 
How do you feel about it helping to 
be crazy to work here but not being 
necessary?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Hey, let's see what it says about me.</speak>

<info>He takes a severed human arm out of his chest cabinet and Ipgee 
scans it. "Prime Minister Of Norway" appears on the screen.</info>

<speak who="IPGEE">
Welcome aboard, sir.</speak>

<info>Applied Cryogenics: Freezer Room. Terry scrapes some condensation 
from the front of an active freezer tube. Fry is wearing a blue 
uniform and he and Bender are both wearing white coats.</info>

<speak who="TERRY">
Remember, when the tube opens, say...<info>(dramatically)</info>..."Welcome 
to the world of tomorrow!"</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Hey, I was frozen. I think I know what 
people wanna hear when they first wake 
up.  Bathroom's that way.</speak>

<info>The man pushes him out the way and runs.</info>

<info>Applied Cryogenics: Probulator Room. The man is lying naked 
on the table. Hovering above him are some sharp instruments.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
So, while you're on the Probulator, 
tell me, what brings you to the future?</speak>

<speak who="MAN">
Oh, well, I wanted to meet Shakespeare 
and I figured that time was cyclical.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Nope. Straight line.  Ah, the Probulator's 
done.</speak>

<speak who="MAN">
That wasn't so bad.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Oh, wait, it hasn't started yet.  OK, 
it's about to start.</speak>

<info>It dings and the man screams some more.</info>

<info>Applied Cryogenics: Freezer Room. A freezer opens and an old 
man walk out, rubbing his eyes. Bender runs towards him wearing 
a giant fly's head and a cape.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Welcome to the future, human slave. 
Ah, relax, chum. I'm not really a giant 
fly!  I'm a horrible robot!  Kill all 
humans!</speak>

<info>The old man clutches his chest.</info>

<speak who="TERRY">
Dear God! He's having a heart attack!</speak>

<info>Bender pushes the old man into the freezer, turns the dial and 
freezer him.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Ah, they'll probably find a cure for 
that in the future.</speak>

<speak who="TERRY">
We have a cure for it now!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Oh, good. Then you won't mind if I use 
this.</speak>

<info>He puts a gorilla mask on.</info>

<info>Time Lapse. Fry is frozen in a freezer. It pings, unfreezes 
him and opens the door. He yawns and stretches.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Nothing like a power nap.</speak>

<info>He pours himself a coffee and opens the old man's tube. There 
are pizza boxes, milk cartons, beers and cans of Slurm stacked 
around him. Fry pours some milk in his coffee. The old man unfreezes.</info>

<speak who="OLD MAN">
Oh, flies! Flies and gorillas!</speak>

<info>Fry hands him the milk and closes the door. The old man freezes 
again. The door to the Probulator room opens and Bender walks 
out.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Stay beautiful, doll-face!  That Probulator 
sure knows how to please a man. So, 
what's for lunch?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
I ordered a pizza.</speak>

<info>The door opens and Leela walks in, wearing delivery girl garb. 
Her cap has a slice of pizza stuck in it.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Pizza delivery for...I.C. Wiener.  Yeah, 
very funny. Now cough up the $12.95.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Sorry, but if it's not here in half 
an hour, it's free.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
It's only been 23 minutes.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Well, uh, I've got 33 minutes.</speak>

<info>Leela puts the pizza box on the table and presses a button. 
The doodle of a hef starts to talk.</info>

<speak who="CHEF">
It's only been-a 23 minutes, you dumb-a 
canolli. You got a problem, we can take 
it outside.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
OK, I'll fight the box. I think I can 
take him.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Fry, just pay me. I still owe 30 bucks 
on this uniform.</speak>

<speak who="CHEF">
35, you stupid meatball.</speak>

<info>Time Lapse. Bender and Fry walk past the freezers, looking at 
a clipboard.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Who should be unfreeze next?</speak>

<info>They look at a commando-type who is holding a gun and pulling 
a pin from a grenade.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
No.  No!  Oh, my God! It's Pauly Shore!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Alright!</speak>

<info>He puts his gorilla mask on.</info>

<info>Applied Cryogenics: Probulator Room. Pauly Shore is lying on 
the table.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Mr. Shore, I loved you in Bio-Dome. 
You sure caused some trouble in that 
bubble!</speak>

<speak who="SHORE">
Rest assured, if it rhymes, I can cause 
trouble in it.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Hey, now that you're in the future, 
you can go live in an actual bio-dome!</speak>

<speak who="SHORE">
An unattractive prospect. While researching 
for the role, I ran computer simulations 
demonstrating, incontravertably, that 
the whole bio-enclosure concept is fundamentally 
flawed. Be it expressed via dome, sphere, 
cube or even a stately tetrahedron, 
buuuddy!</speak>

<info>He smacks his lips. Fry stares blankly at him.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Oh.  How did you wind up getting frozen?</speak>

<speak who="SHORE">
Well, while filming Encino Man my intellectual 
curiosity re: cryogenics was peaked, 
and I resolved to freeze the weasel.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
The weasel?</speak>

<info>He laughs.</info>

<speak who="SHORE">
Hey, listen, skippy. I was supposed 
to be unfrozen in Hollywood for the 
thousandth anniversary screening of 
Jury Duty II. How come I'm not there?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
I woke you up early so we could hang 
out and do stuff.</speak>

<speak who="SHORE">
Like what?</speak>

<info>Fry turns the Probulator on and Shore screams.</info>

<info>Applied Cryogenics: Freezer Room.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
I love this job.</speak>

<info>Bender is wearing a sheet over his head and looks like a cartoon 
ghost.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Me too.</speak>

<info>A freezer pings.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Showtime! <info>(hoarse)</info> I'll pretend to be 
dying of space plague.</speak>

<info>The freezer opens and Fry gasps.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Boo?</speak>

<info>The condensation clears and the woman inside the freezer wakes 
up.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Michelle!</speak>

<info>Bender looks at the photo inside Fry's wallet.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Oh, my God!</speak>

<info>He steals some cash and hands the wallet back to Fry.</info>

<speak who="MICHELLE">
Fry? Is it really you?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
I don't know. Is it really you?</speak>

<speak who="MICHELLE">
What do you mean you don't know? Are 
you you or not?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Who wants to know?</speak>

<speak who="MICHELLE">
Oh, Fry, it is you!</speak>

<info>She hugs him and they kiss. Bender makes scary ghostie noises.</info>

<info>Time Lapse. Fry and Michelle are sat down.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
I don't get it, Michelle. The last time 
I saw you, you were doing great. You 
had just dumped me and you were well 
on your way to getting you life back 
on track. Why'd you freeze yourself?</speak>

<speak who="MICHELLE">
Oh, Fry. After you left, things took 
a turn for the worse. I got married.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
I'm sorry.</speak>

<info>Flashback. At Michelle's wedding, her new husband slips a ring 
onto her finger and they kiss.</info>

<speak who="MICHELLE">
<info>(voice-over)</info> His name was Charles. He 
attended a law school so prestigious, 
the basketball team was coached by Ruth 
Bader Ginsberg.  I put him through law 
school by working as a dog walker for 
antisocial dogs.</speak>

<info>Flashback ends.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Sorry.</speak>

<info>Flashback. The scene moves to Charles's graduation.</info>

<speak who="MICHELLE">
<info>(voice-over)</info> But soon after Charles 
graduated, our marriage ran into difficulties.</speak>

<info>Charles throws his hat into the air and Michelle catches it 
and sees him kissing another woman.</info>

<info>Flashback ends.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Uh, sorry.</speak>

<info>Flashback. Michelle walks the streets alone at night.</info>

<speak who="MICHELLE">
<info>(voice-over)</info> Desperately depressed, 
I turned to the one thing that could 
lessen my pain: A carnival. Unfortunately, 
a corn dog bone got lodged in the control 
panel of the Spizzler, and I had to 
ride it for eight hours.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
<info>(voice-over)</info> Sorry.</speak>

<speak who="MICHELLE">
<info>(voice-over)</info> But it did give me a chance 
to think...</speak>

<info>Flashback ends.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
I'm sorry.</speak>

<speak who="MICHELLE">
...and I remembered the last time I 
was truly happy; When I was with you.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Aww. So you froze yourself to come look 
for me?</speak>

<speak who="MICHELLE">
No, I did it to get a fresh start. I 
didn't know what had happened to you 
- no one did. The police were going 
to conduct a search but your parents 
felt it was a waste of taxpayer money.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
That's the same reason they kept me 
out of school. So, no one even cared 
that I was gone?</speak>

<speak who="MICHELLE">
Not really. Except for one person.</speak>

<info>She puts her hand on his and they move closer.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Who was it?</speak>

<info>New New York City Streets. Fry and Michelle fly a hover-scooter 
over the city.</info>

<speak who="MICHELLE">
Everything is so different.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Not everything. There's still a roach 
problem.</speak>

<info>A giant roach flies beside them and Fry sprays it.</info>

<speak who="MICHELLE">
Ew!</speak>

<info>Museum Of Really Modern Art. The artwork is on the stomachs 
of lots of fat men. Michelle and Fry look at a painting on Sal.</info>

<speak who="MICHELLE">
Eurgh.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Nowadays, people aren't interested in 
art that's not tattooed on fat guys.</speak>

<speak who="SAL">
I'm on loan from the Louvre.</speak>

<info>Park. Fry and Michelle sit in a horse-drawn carriage. The cab 
man whips the horse and a giant bug whips him. He screams and 
Michelle whimpers.</info>

<info>Planet Express: Meeting Room. Outside the building, repair work 
is being done. Inside, Leela and Bender meet with Farnsworth.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Please, professor. Give us our jobs 
back. We deserve another chance.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Yeah, and if you won't give me another 
chance, perhaps you'd give one to......Og, 
gorilla emperor of Earth!</speak>

<info>The ship lands in the hangar.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
I'm sorry, Og, but I've got a new crew.</speak>

<info>Cut to: Planet Express: Hangar. Farnsworth leans over the railings 
and Hermes, Amy and Zoidberg get off the ship.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
So, how was delivery to Fantasy Planet, 
where everyone's fantasies come to life?</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
Great!</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
Organised!</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
For one beautiful night, I knew what 
it was to be a grandmother. Subjugated, 
yet honoured.</speak>

<info>Cut to: Planet Express: Meeting Room. Bender has the gorilla 
mask under his arm and Farnsworth talks to it.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
You see, Og? Everything's running smoothly, 
yes. And with Fry fired, I can finally 
leave my jigsaw puzzles out without 
him eating the pieces.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Forget about Fry. You can hire us back 
and he'd never have to know.</speak>

<info>Enter Fry.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Hey, guys.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Oh. Hey, Fry!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
So, as Leela was saying, Fry can go 
shove a big old - Ow!</speak>

<info>Leela clocks him with a phone.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
I'm glad you're all here. I wanted to 
introduce you to my on-again-off-again 
girlfriend of the past thousand years, 
Michelle.  Michelle, this is Leela. 
This is Bender.  The professor.  Hermes 
and Amy.</speak>

<speak who="MICHELLE">
Nice to meet you.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
And this is Dr. Zoidberg.</speak>

<info>Zoidberg screams and runs away.</info>

<info>Planet Express: Lounge. Fry sits on the couch and Hermes, Bender 
and Farnsworth stand around him.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
Dating you ex, Fry? Have you lost all 
self-respect?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
All what?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
This can only end badly, Fry. Kids, 
a house -</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
A home invasion by a former roommate.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
But things are different this time. 
Before, she was demanding and possessive. 
But now she wants me to do stuff and 
stay with her all the time.</speak>

<info>Planet Express: Meeting Room. Amy and Michelle sit at the table. 
Zoidberg, wearing a frilly apron, pours them some tea.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
There you go, dearies.</speak>

<info>He hums and leaves. Michelle trembles.</info>

<speak who="MICHELLE">
It's a relief to meet you, Amy. I'm 
just having a hard time adjusting to 
all the strange stuff here in the future.</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
I'm from Mars.</speak>

<speak who="MICHELLE">
I feel so out of place here. I don't 
understand why Fry fits in so well.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Probably because he didn't fit in back 
in your time.</speak>

<speak who="MICHELLE">
That's true. But I used to fit in really 
well.</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Then good luck, sister.</speak>

<info>He screams and walks off. Michelle drops her cup and it smashes. 
Seconds later it reassembles itself. She whimpers.</info>

<info>Applied Cryogenics: Freezer Room.</info>

<speak who="MICHELLE">
Don't take this the wrong way, Fry, 
but your friends are a bunch of freaks.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Yeah, they're great, huh?</speak>

<speak who="MICHELLE">
I just don't belong here. I don't know 
anyone, I can't find a vanishing cream 
that doesn't make me actually vanish. 
I don't even have a job.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Oh, right. I was supposed to assign 
you a job. Let me just get your career 
chip installed.  Hold out your palm. 
What are you scared of? It's just like 
getting your hand pierced.</speak>

<info>Michelle pushes the gun away.</info>

<speak who="MICHELLE">
This world is horrible. Let's start 
over, Fry. Well go someplace where all 
we have is each other.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Ooh, romantic. I'll tell Bender to meet 
us there.</speak>

<speak who="MICHELLE">
It's not a "there". It's a "then".  
The future.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Whoa, whoa, girl. I thought you were 
talking about one of those motels where 
the bed is shaped like stuff.</speak>

<speak who="MICHELLE">
I love you. Don't you love me?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Well, sure. To the extent a man can 
love a woman. But this seems like a 
big step.</speak>

<speak who="MICHELLE">
Fry, why must you analyse everything 
with your relentless logic? Nothing 
matters but our love.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
You're right. Let's do this now and 
let's never regret it.</speak>

<info>They climb into the freezer and kiss. They are frozen in a flash.</info>

<info>Apocalyptic Wasteland. The freezer stands alone in a vast desert. 
The door opens and Fry and Michelle get out and look around. 
The ruins of buildings burn and there are cracks in the ground.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Michelle, I don't regret this. But I 
both rue and lament it.</speak>

<info>Time Lapse. The pair walk the desert.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
The year 4000 is severely disappointing. 
I miss the year 3000 when life was simple 
and brains flew through space and everyone 
ate lasers.</speak>

<speak who="MICHELLE">
It's not that bad. Fate brought us together 
and now fate brought us here.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
No, you brought us here.</speak>

<speak who="MICHELLE">
Whine some more, Fry, I really find 
that attractive in a man. Now come on, 
build us a shelter.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Alright, fine. Everything else sucks. 
At least we can have a nice place to 
live.</speak>

<info>Time Lapse. It is dark and Fry is covered in dirt.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Ooh, there.</speak>

<info>He is standing in a hole.</info>

<speak who="MICHELLE">
You expect me to live in a tiny little 
hole?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
It'd be deeper, but I'm standing on 
a gopher.</speak>

<info>Time Lapse. The next morning, Fry and Michelle are woken up 
by someone poking their faces with sticks.</info>

<speak who="MICHELLE">
Oh, look. Some little kids.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
They'll save us.  We're saved!</speak>

<info>Kids' Den. Fry and Michelle are tied up in the middle of the 
den, which is in the middle of some ruined buildings. One of 
the kids sits on a chair, elevated by some oil drums.</info>

<speak who="BUTCH">
I'm Butch, leader of this place. I took 
your hole and you can't do nothing about 
it.</speak>

<speak who="MICHELLE">
OK.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Mighty sir, we have nowhere to go. Could 
we please join your society?</speak>

<speak who="BUTCH">
Well, alright. But no interfering with 
our grand works.</speak>

<info>Time Lapse. The kids smash an old couch to bits and fight. Butch 
watches them and nods. Fry joins Michelle, who is lying on a 
sun bed.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
I tell you, that Butch runs a pretty 
good civilisation. I think I'll enjoy 
serving under him.</speak>

<info>Michelle groans.</info>

<speak who="MICHELLE">
You know your problem, Fry? You're not 
ambitious. You should be chief.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
What do I need, ulcers?</speak>

<speak who="MICHELLE">
But I want power. I'm tired of the chief's 
girlfriend lording it over me with her 
fancy coyote hide.</speak>

<info>They watch Butch's girlfriend stroking the hide.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Alright, alright. If it'll make you 
happy, I'll overthrow society.</speak>

<info>Time Lapse. Butch laughs.</info>

<speak who="BUTCH">
On what grounds do you challenge my 
authority?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Well, I'm older than you. I can beat 
you up.</speak>

<info>The kids nod.</info>

<speak who="KID #1">
Yeah, I'll bet he could.</speak>

<speak who="BUTCH">'S GIRLFRIEND
He's got arm hair.</speak>

<speak who="BUTCH">
Alright, grandpa. There's only one way 
to settle this. Death rolling!</speak>

<info>The kids cheer.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
What's death rolling?</speak>

<speak who="OROWHEAT">
It's like skateboarding.</speak>

<speak who="ICE">-V
Except half the time, someone dies.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Oh, so it's a little safer than skateboarding.</speak>

<info>Ruined City. At the top of a ruined building, Fry stands on 
a skateboard with wheels and Butch stands on a rocket-propelled 
one.</info>

<speak who="BUTCH">
Last one holding the bandana's the new 
leader.</speak>

<info>He takes his bandana off and Fry holds one end of it.</info>

<speak who="MICHELLE">
My mother always said you were a loser, 
Fry. Now get out there and prove her 
wrong.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
<info>(sadly)</info> Beth said that?</speak>

<speak who="BUTCH">'S GIRLFRIEND
<info>(in Hebrew)</info> One, two, three.</speak>

<info>Butch flies down the ramp, dragging Fry with him. They tug back 
and forth on the bandana as they wind through the ruined streets. 
Butch pulls Fry through a sewer pipe and Fry's hair makes sparks 
on the side of it. They leave the sewer pipe and jump on a highway. 
Two urban defence vehicles drive either side of them and start 
shooting at each other. They flip over and Fry and Butch dodge 
them. Fry rolls down the opposite lane, straight towards an oncoming 
car. He lifts his skateboard onto the other side, missing the 
car. Butch holds onto the bumper of a car and Fry grabs the bumper 
of another one. He coughs as he gets exhaust in his face. The 
cars split and Fry and Butch fly towards a lamppost. The bandana 
wraps around it and their heads hit each other. The kids and 
Michelle gather around.</info>

<speak who="BUTCH">
It's cool. Back off.  <info>(crying)</info> My knee. 
I scraped it.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Aww. Poor little guy. Let me just take 
a look at - aha!  I won! I'm the new 
chief! I'm the tallest and I weigh the 
most!</speak>

<info>The kids takes their guns out.</info>

<speak who="BUTCH">
Hand it over, you giant idiot.</speak>

<info>An armoured car pulls up and honks its horn.</info>

<speak who="BUTCH">'S GIRLFRIEND
Hey, Butch, your mom's here.</speak>

<speak who="BUTCH">
Aw, man.</speak>

<speak who="BUTCH">'S MOM
Come on, kids. You're late for Hebrew 
school.</speak>

<info>The kids groan and drop their guns.</info>

<speak who="OROWHEAT">
I don't wanna go.</speak>

<speak who="BUTCH">'S GIRLFRIEND
Every Monday and Wednesday's the same 
thing.</speak>

<info>They get into the car and drive away.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
I find this post-apocalyptic wasteland 
very confusing. Seriously, I'm weirded 
out.</speak>

<speak who="MICHELLE">
That's because you're a loser. You were 
a loser in the year 2000 and you're 
a loser in the year 4000.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Yeah, but in the year 3000, I had it 
all. Several friends, a low-paying job, 
a bed in a robot's closet. I envied 
no man. But you wrecked everything.</speak>

<speak who="MICHELLE">
Quit standing up for yourself, Fry. 
When we get back to the hole, we are 
going to have a long, boring talk about 
our relationship!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Oh, yeah? Well, listen to this: <info>(whispering)</info> 
I'm leaving you.</speak>

<info>He runs away.</info>

<info>Time Lapse. Fry walks alone through the misty desert.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
There must be people somewhere.</speak>

<info>He climbs a small hill and sees some lights in the distance. 
He slips on some loose stones and bounces down the other side 
of the hill.</info>

<info>Time Lapse. The mist is thicker. Fry falls to the ground. The 
mist clears a little and something comes into view.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Yes! Footprints! And hand prints?  But? 
What's happening?</speak>

<info>He stands up and sees Loew's Gaddafi's Chinese Theater in front 
of him. He steps back. The Planet Express ship lands beside him, 
crushing a floodlight. People scatter. Leela, Bender and Farnsworth 
walk off the ship.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Fry, thank God we found you.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Leela? What are you guys doing here 
in the year 4000?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
It's not the year 4000.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
You were only frozen for two days. Uh, 
by the way, I broke your bed.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
You were in Pauly Shore's tube and they 
were delivering it to his movie screening.</speak>

<info>He points to the sign on the theatre; "Jury Duty II: Trouble 
On The Hubble Starring Dr. Paul Shore. 1000th Anniversary Gala!"</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
But, when they noticed you weren't him, 
they chucked you in a ditch.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
So you're saying these aren't the decaying 
ruins of New York in the year 4000?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
You wish! You're in Los Angeles!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
But there was this gang of 10-year olds 
with guns.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Exactly: You're in L.A.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
But everyone is driving around in cars 
shooting at each other.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
That's L.A.. for you.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
But the air's green and there's no sign 
of civilisation whatsoever.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
He just won't stop with the social commentary.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
And the people are all phoneys. No one 
reads. Everything has cilantro on it 
-  Michelle, baby!</speak>

<speak who="MICHELLE">
It's not working out, Fry.</speak>

<info>The limo drives away. Pauly Shore pokes his head out of the 
sunroof.</info>

<speak who="SHORE">
<info>(shouting)</info> Tis better to have loved 
and lost, n'est ce-pas?</speak>

<info>He laughs.</info>

<info>Ship's Cockpit. Fry looks out of the window as the ship flies 
back to New New York.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
That's it. I've had it with women. From 
now on, I'm concentrating on my career. 
Can I have my old job back?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Why, I've forgotten why I even fired 
you.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
'Cause he destroyed your business, your 
home and all your possessions.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Oh, that's right. Get lost.</speak>

<info>He pulls a lever and the floor opens up beneath Fry. He falls 
out of the ship and screams.</info>

<info>THE END</info></xml>
