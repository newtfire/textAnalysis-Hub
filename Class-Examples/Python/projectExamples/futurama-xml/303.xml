               <note>Ship's Cockpit. The ship is in the Planet Express hangar and 
               Fry and Bender are messing around in the cockpit. Fry flies a 
               scale model of the ship around and makes whoosh-y noises, then 
               a crackling radio noise.</note>

                         An unattractive prospect. While researching 
                         for the role, I ran computer simulations 
                         demonstrating, incontravertably, that 
                         the whole bio-enclosure concept is fundamentally 
                         flawed. Be it expressed via dome, sphere, 
                         cube or even a stately tetrahedron, 
                         buuuddy!
