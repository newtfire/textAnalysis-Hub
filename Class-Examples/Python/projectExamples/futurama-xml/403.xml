                         There. I've finished fine tuning my 
                         What If? machine. It can answer any 
                         What If? question, accurate to within 
                         1/10th of a plausibility unit.

                         Good news everyone. I've discovered 
                         a way to make Bender human using a process 
                         I call "reverse fossilisation."

                         Well, in regular fossilisation, flesh 
                         and bone turn to minerals. Realising 
                         that, it was a simple matter to reverse 
                         the process. I've already tested it 
                         by turning the toaster into a racoon.

                         boots together three times and wish 
                         to go home to Kansas, to live in poerty 
                         with your dirt farming, teetotalling 
                         aunt and uncle.
