                         Zoidberg, how could you? I used to think 
                         you were cool.

                         Wait! People of Earth, listen. Yes,

                         the freedom it represents!

                         Zoidberg, you set us free! I feel like 
                         I could stand to hug you! I can't, but 
                         you know what I'm trying to say.

                         Well, maybe just a taste.  Mmm! Now 
                         that's a grand old flag!  I wonder what 
                         the Shroud of Turin tastes like.
