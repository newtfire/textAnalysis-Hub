                         My fellow Earthicans. After meeting 
                         with top voodoo economists, I have decided 
                         to refund our silk surplus to you, the 
                         taxpayers. That's right! I've sent you 
                         each 300 buckeroos in the form of a 
                         tricky dick fun bill. Knock yourselves
