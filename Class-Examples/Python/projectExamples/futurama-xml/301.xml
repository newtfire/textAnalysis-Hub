<info>Old Building. A robot croaks and his arm shakes. He tries to 
clench his fist but is too weak and his arm falls beside him. 
He is lying in an old four-poster bed. The room around him is 
covered in cobwebs and lit by candles. A human butler stands 
at one side of the bed and a Doctorbot and the Preacherbot stand 
on the other side. The Doctorbot opens the old robot's chest 
cabinet and inside a life-support machine beeps and stops. The 
robot is dead. The Doctorbot closes the robot's eyes.</info>

<speak who="DOCTORBOT">
Notify his survivors.</speak>

<info>Planet Express: Lounge.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
<info>(singing)</info> B-E-N-D-E-R! Be-ender!  B-E-N-D-E-R! 
Be-ender! Sayin' B-E-N-D-ERRR...</speak>

<info>Enter Hermes. He picks up a remote control and mutes Bender. 
Bender carries on dancing, unaware.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
Mail call! Amy, here's your designer 
lingerie catalogue, Fry, Sadie's Bra 
Parade and Leela, Bulk Underpants Outlet.</speak>

<info>Leela snatches the catalogue from him.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
You buy one pound of underwear and you're 
on their list forever.</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
And for Bender, uh-oh: A black-bordered 
envelope.</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
Oh no, someone you know must've died.</speak>

<info>Bender takes the envelope and Hermes un-mutes him.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
I hope it was one of my enemies, those 
guys suck!  Oh no, my uncle Vladimir.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Oh, I'm sorry, Bender. When's the funeral?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Tomorrow, at the family castle. Followed 
by the reading of his will.  Well, I'm 
rich. Goodbye, losers, whom I've always 
hated!  C'mon, it'll be fun!</speak>

<info>Somewhere In Eastern Europe. The Planet Express ship lands in 
a lightning storm. It gets caught in a huge cobweb between some 
trees before landing on a landing pad near a small settlement.</info>

<info>Thermostadt. The crew walk into the capital of the Robo-Hungarian 
Empire. The town is populated by robots, dressed like 11th century 
folk. Bender addresses a robot feeding a horse.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Uh, pardon me, my good simpleton, could 
you take us to yon castle?</speak>

<info>He points to a huge imposing castle on a mountain top. The townsfolk 
mutter and run indoors. An old hunchbacked robot hobbles towards 
the crew.</info>

<speak who="ROBOT #1">
Some say unholy things happen up there.</speak>

<speak who="ROBOT #2">
For example: All of us say that.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Fuf! Superstitious robot mumbo-jumbo.</speak>

<speak who="ROBOT #2">
Mumbo, perhaps. Jumbo, perhaps not! 
With all your modern science are you 
any closer to understanding the mystery 
of how a robot walks or talks?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Yes, you idiot.  The circuit diagram 
is right here on the inside of your 
case.</speak>

<info>The robot slams it shut.</info>

<speak who="ROBOT #2">
I choose to believe what I was programmed 
to believe.</speak>

<info>Mountain. A hover-carriage pulled by two horses skids around 
a corner on a narrow mountain pass. It stops suddenly. Bender 
peeps out of the window.</info>

<speak who="ROBOT #2">
I will go this far and no further.</speak>

<info>They are right outside the front door of the castle.</info>

<info>Castle Cemetery. The crew and Vladimir's other relatives stand 
in the cemetery which is populated by such robots as Blimpf, 
Hovermayor of Thermostadt <info>("I Will Rise Again")</info> and The Red LeBaron. 
Vladimir's gravestone has "Vladimir 2790-3001. Efficient Father 
And Husband" engraved on it.</info>

<speak who="PREACHERBOT">
I now commend Vladimir's remains to 
the earth. Filings to filings; rust 
to rust.</speak>

<info>Four pallbearerbots carry Vladimir's body towards the grave, 
package his body in polystyrene and a cardboard box, stamp "Return 
To Sender" on it and place it in the ground. A Fembot weeps and 
Preacherbot fills the hole.</info>

<info>Execu-tor &amp; Prosecutron Solicitors. Everyone is gathered for 
the reading of the will.</info>

<speak who="SOLICITORBOT">
<info>(reading)</info> To my loyal butler, You There, 
I leave a pittance, to be paid in 20 
equal installments of one-twentieth 
of a pittance each.  To my lazy, spoiled 
son, Tandy, who never learned the value 
of a dollar, I leave my entire $10 million 
fortune.</speak>

<info>Tandy leans over to his wife.</info>

<speak who="TANDY">
<info>(whispering)</info> Is that a lot?</speak>

<speak who="SOLICITORBOT">
<info>(reading)</info> And to my loving nephew, Bender, 
assuming he's not responsible for my 
death, I leave my castle.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Yes! Let's stay there tonight.</speak>

<speak who="SOLICITORBOT">
<info>(reading)</info> On condition that he spend 
one night within its walls.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Oh man, there's always a catch.</speak>

<info>Castle Dining Room. The crew sit around a long table. Lightning 
still crackles outside. Bender sips from a glass.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Ah! I got a good vibe from this place: 
Nice long dinner table, quiet, well-behaved 
spiders, graveyard-adjacent. Yep! It's 
gonna be -</speak>

<info>He drops his glass and screams.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
What is it?</speak>

<info>Bender peeps over the top of the table and points.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
That painting, the eyes are watching 
me!</speak>

<info>Farnsworth walks towards a portrait of Commodore LXIV.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Hmm.  It has motor eye sensors attached 
to motion detectors.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
So does my butt, but I don't frame it 
and put it on the wall! Although... 
What's that?</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
I don't know, but it's infectious!</speak>

<info>He laughs.</info>

<info>Castle Parlour. The crew sit in front of a roaring fire in an 
old parlour. Bender's teeth chatter together.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
No doubt about it, this place is haunted.</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
Don't be silly mon, the last ghost died 
over 200 years ago.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
The last human ghost. But robot ghosts?</speak>

<info>He shudders. The Windows music plays again. Bender gasps and 
points at some blood-red numbers appearing on a wall. Leela and 
Amy turn around.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
<info>(reading)</info> 0101100101. <info>(talking)</info> What 
does it mean?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
It's just gibberish.  <info>(reading)</info> 1010011010?!</speak>

<info>He screams and runs out of the room.</info>

<info>Cut to: Castle Corridor. He runs down the corridor being chased 
by a ghostly toaster with wings and the Windows logo. He runs 
around a corner and gasps.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Uncle Vladimir!</speak>

<speak who="VLADIMIRGHOST">
Come, Bender. You'll like being dead!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
That's what they said about being alive.</speak>

<info>Some robot ghosts appear from paintings on the wall.</info>

<speak who="ROBOT GHOSTS">
<info>(chanting)</info> Join us! Join us! Join us, 
Bender!</speak>

<info>Bender screams and runs away. Again.</info>

<info>Cut to: Castle Cemetery. The crew are digging up the graves 
of other robots. Fry hands Leela the toaster that chased Bender. 
Farnsworth dusts of a piece of sparking equipment.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Just as I suspected. These robots were 
buried in improperly shielded coffins. 
Their programming leaked into the castles 
wiring through this old, abandoned modem 
allowing them to project themselves 
as holograms.</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
Of course! It was so obvious!</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Yes, that sequence of words I said made 
perfect sense. We really should tell 
Bender there's nothing to be afraid 
of.</speak>

<info>Bender runs, screaming, through the middle of the group and 
out onto the moors.</info>

<info>Cut to: Moors. Bender stops running and leans against a wall 
as he catches his breath. He jumps and turns around. Behind him, 
two lights light up. They are the headlights on a car. It races 
towards him.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
<info>(screaming)</info> No!</speak>

<info>The car hits him and Bender goes flying, landing on the ground 
unconscious. The car howls at the moon and honks.</info>

<info>Time Lapse. The next morning the crew find Bender in a crumpled 
mess on the floor.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Bender, wake up!  He's OK! Quick, does 
anyone have any liquor?</speak>

<info>Everyone offers him some. Bender takes a hip flask from Amy.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Bender, what happened?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Somebody tried to run me over. And not 
with a normal hover-car. It crept along 
the ground on round, rubber feet, like 
a wolf!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Poor Bender, you're seeing things. You've 
been drinking too much, or too little, 
I forget how it works with you. Anyway, 
you haven't drunk exactly the right 
amount.</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
Maybe he's right, look at these tracks.</speak>

<info>She points at some tyre tracks. Bender screams.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
I think Bender may be telling the truth.]</speak>

<info>The other five scream.</info>

<info>The ship flies back to New New York City later that night.</info>

<info>Planet Express: Lounge. The next morning, Bender staggers into 
the lounge, where the rest of the crew already are. His eyes 
are bloodshot.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Bender, you look awful. I prescribe 
make-up. Here. It just so happens I 
have my Mary Kay sample case!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Ah, I just need sleep. I had nightmares 
all night about cars running people 
over.</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Many people dream of a fresh, new look. 
And Mary Kay can make those dreams come 
true.</speak>

<info>Enter Leela.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Look at this. They found those same 
rubbery tracks right here in New New 
York.  There was a hit-and-run by the 
robot porno theatre.</speak>

<info>Bender gasps.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Robot porno theatre? I was in that...general 
area, last night. Whoever ran me down 
on those moors must've followed me back 
here.</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
Bender mon, no one's trying to run you 
over. Stop being a big, hallucinating 
baby.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Yeah?! Could a big, hallucinating baby 
do this: <info>(crying)</info> I scared!</speak>

<info>New New York Street. A grey car drives across rooftops and down 
the transport tubes. In an alley two vandals smash up a car with 
a blernsball bat and a crowbar. One laughs.</info>

<speak who="VANDAL #1">
I don't know which I like more: Smashing 
cars or smashing faces.</speak>

<speak who="VANDAL #2">
Well. lucky you don't gotta decide tonight. 
No come on, we got church tomorrow. 
Did you hear something?</speak>

<info>They both look around then carry on walking.</info>

<speak who="VANDAL #1">
Ah, it was probably just a golden marmoset.</speak>

<info>The car revs it's engine.</info>

<speak who="VANDAL #2">
That don't sound like any golden marmoset 
I ever heard.</speak>

<info>They run into a building called The Squatterly.</info>

<info>Cut to: The Squatterly. They close the door behind them, catch 
their breath and high-five.</info>

<speak who="VANDAL #1">
Made it!</speak>

<info>Vandal #2 presses the elevator button.</info>

<speak who="VANDAL #2">
So anyway, what're you wearing tomorrow?</speak>

<info>The elevator doors open. The car is in there. The vandals scream.</info>

<info>Cut to: New New York Street. The car's honk and howl echoes 
around the city.</info>

<info>Impound Lot 136. The next morning Bender wakes up in a puddle 
of oil. He groans and wipes some oil from his mouth.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Where...? What the...?  Transmission 
fluid? Where have I been? What happened?</speak>

<info>Sal kicks him.</info>

<speak who="SAL">
Get outta here, yous lazy bum!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Please, I'm scared.</speak>

<speak who="SAL">
We're all scared, it's the human condition. 
Why do you thinks I put on this tough-guy 
facade? Now beat it!</speak>

<info>Planet Express: Lounge. Bender recounts his tale to Fry and 
Leela.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
I passed out around midnight, which 
is much earlier that usual, and when 
I woke up, I found these in my chest 
cabinet.</speak>

<info>He pulls out some fluffy dice.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Aw, relax buddy. You were probably just 
shooting some big, fuzzy craps.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
No, I think I may have hurt someone. 
Oh Lord, I'm on the verge of a nervous 
meltdown.</speak>

<info>He bangs his head.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Geez Bender, you're scaring me. You're 
going wacko!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
You're right, I need professional help. 
And damn the expense.</speak>

<info>Carnival. Bender's "professional help" is a Circus Fortune-teller 
machine which costs 5c.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Damn the expense!</speak>

<info>He puts 5c in and the gypsy lights up.</info>

<speak who="GYPSY">
My friend, you have nothing to worry 
about. Except a nightmare-ish life of 
unremitting horror!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Phew!</speak>

<speak who="GYPSY">
For, you see, you are a were-car.</speak>

<info>Fry, Leela and Bender gasp.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
A were-car?</speak>

<speak who="GYPSY">
The car that ran you down on the moors 
was also a were-car. It beamed a virus 
to you through its demonic headlights.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
That's crazy!</speak>

<speak who="GYPSY">
Yes. So crazy that it must be true! 
Each midnight, when your clock resets 
to zero, your hardware reconfigures 
into a murderous, four-wheeled car.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
I can't keep running people over. I'm 
not famous enough to get away with it. 
Can't you help me?</speak>

<speak who="GYPSY">
Yes. But you must be willing to pay 
a terrible price.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Yeah, yeah, yeah.</speak>

<info>He puts another 5c in.</info>

<speak who="GYPSY">
Follow me.</speak>

<info>She walks off.</info>

<info>Gypsy's Caravan. She reads Curse Of The Were-Car. For Windows 
98.</info>

<speak who="GYPSY">
According to this ancient read-me file, 
your only hope is to destroy the original 
were-car.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
I'm with you.</speak>

<speak who="GYPSY">
In its death throes, the dread car will 
beam out the virus's uninstall program, 
thus ridding you of the curse.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Otherwise, I can never die?</speak>

<speak who="GYPSY">
Who said that? Sure you can die. You 
want to die?</speak>

<info>She points a laser at him.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
No! I wanna live! There's still too 
many things I don't own!</speak>

<speak who="GYPSY">
Then live on, forever cursed. Each night, 
your attacks will become more gruesome 
until, one dark night you are doomed 
to kill your dearest friend.</speak>

<info>Fry gulps.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
I wouldn't wanna be me right now.</speak>

<speak who="GYPSY">
Now go! Go!  Uh, could one of you just...? 
Ah, forget it. I'll just sleep here.</speak>

<info>She starts to snore and the others leave.</info>

<info>Fry and Bender's Lounge. Leela finishes welding Bender to the 
wall.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
There. No rampaging for you tonight.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Wouldn't it make sense to weld everyone 
except me to the wall?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Just relax, Bender. Tomorrow we'll pry 
you down, have a nice breakfast and 
then go hunt down and slaughter that 
ancient evil.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
It'll be a rich, full day.</speak>

<info>Outside Robot Arms Apartments. Fry and Leela leave the building.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Well, goodnight. I'm gonna go make my 
dinners for the next month and freeze 
them.</speak>

<info>The two part company. Above them, the huge digital clock displays 
11:58:48, 49, 50, 51, 52...</info>

<info>Cut to: Fry and Bender's Lounge. Bender stirs in his sleep. 
His internal clock reaches midnight and the were-car routine 
begins. He wakes up. His arm turns into a wheel, as do his other 
limbs. He falls from the wall and his casing forces itself into 
the shape of a car chasis. His head stretches and his eyes turn 
into headlights. They light up and the engine purrs.</info>

<info>Cut to: Robot Arms Apartments Corridor. The Bender-car bursts 
through the wall and drives down the corridor.</info>

<info>Cut to: Outside Robot Arms Apartments. Bender smashes through 
the front doors and speeds off down the street. He howls and 
honks at the moon.</info>

<info>Cut to: New New York Street. Leela walks through the deserted 
city and gulps when she hears the honking. Fry turns as he hears 
it. Leela walks around a corner and comes to face to face with 
the Bender-car. She dives out of the way. Fry appears.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
<info>(shouting)</info> Bender, no!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
<info>(shouting)</info> Fry, stay back!</speak>

<info>Bender tears after her. He chases her into an alley and she 
comes to a dead end.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
<info>(shouting)</info> You jerk. I thought I was 
your best friend. What kind of two-timing 
kill-mobile are you?</speak>

<info>Bender drives at Leela and she screams. She runs through a gap 
in the fence and into a junkyard.</info>

<info>Cut to: Park Avenue Junk. Leela jumps onto a mattress and springs 
out of Bender's way. Bender crashes into some rubbish. He shakes 
it off and looks around for Leela. Leela drives up behind him 
in a crane and lifts him up with the grabber. Bender growls and 
honks.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
I can't believe this. Bender is supposed 
to murder his closest friend, which 
I thought was me. But he went straight 
for you. He didn't even try to second-degree 
murder me.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Could you give me some help? I think 
Bender crushed my foot.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Stop rubbing it in.</speak>

<info>Time Lapse. The next morning Bender is nearly back to normal, 
though his right arm is still a wheel. He wakes up, screams and 
shakes it back to normal. Leela lowers him to the ground.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Oh God. Fry, I'm so glad to see you. 
I didn't hurt you did I?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Not physically. But why don't you ask 
your new best friend, Leela?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
I tried to run you over?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
It was very sweet of you, Bender.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Fry, it doesn't mean anything. I have 
love enough for two.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Words. Nothing sweet, sweet words that 
turn into bitter orange wax in my ears.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Enough with the feelings, you two. If 
we're gonna cure Bender we've got to 
go back to the castle and hunt down 
the original were-car.</speak>

<info>Thermostadt. The ship lands outside the town and Fry, Bender 
and Leela walk through the street. The robots make the sign of 
the cross but the crew take no notice.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Yeah, yeah, yeah.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Cursed, got it.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Whatever.</speak>

<info>Outside Old Shack. The trio follow some tyre tracks to the garage 
door of a rickety, old shack.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
The tracks lead here.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Thanks, eagle eye.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Now it's daylight, so he should be in 
robot form. But be careful. Many robots 
are stupid and violent.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
<info>(sarcastic)</info> I wish I was stupid and 
violent. Then we'd see what's what, 
I'd pound him till -</speak>

<info>He screams and someone rams a pitchfork at him.</info>

<speak who="YOKELBOT">
Get ye to your house, ye ignorant villagers.</speak>

<info>He pokes Bender with his pitchfork.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
We are not ignorant villagers, we're 
sophisticated New New Yorkers. Whup 
his butt!</speak>

<info>They dive on the robot and punch him.</info>

<speak who="YOKELBOT">
Stop! What are ye doing?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
We're whaling on the original were-car, 
which is you, you jerk.</speak>

<speak who="YOKELBOT">
Ye think me be he?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
S�.</speak>

<speak who="YOKELBOT">
Nee. I mean, "no". I was given the curse 
many a year ago while on a bird-watching 
trip to the Arctic...</speak>

<info>Arctic. The ship cruises over the icy land, lands and skids 
to a stop outside an igloo.</info>

<speak who="YOKELBOT">
<info>(voice-over)</info> ...I was attacked by a 
vicious, motorised sled. The natives 
called it the abominable snowmobile.</speak>

<info>Igloo. The crew sit with an Inuitbot.</info>

<speak who="INUITBOT">
Yes, it's true. I ran over that bird-watching 
jerk and a hundred others. Even my best 
friend from aromatherapy school.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
I once had a best friend who liked to 
smell things with me.</speak>

<info>He glares at Bender.</info>

<speak who="INUITBOT">
Alas, I'm afraid I'm not the original 
were-car. I received the curse while 
taking a learning annex class from a 
famous robot actor.</speak>

<info>Outside All My Cicuits Soundstage. The crew go in.</info>

<speak who="INUITBOT">
<info>(voice-over)</info> You know him as Calculon.</speak>

<info>Calculon's Dressing Room. Calculon is dressed in period costume. 
He dabs himself with Silver Pancake and Iron Blush.</info>

<speak who="CALCULON">
<info>(dramatically)</info> Oh, fate most cruel, 
would that my boundless acting skills 
would avail me a sword with which to 
slay this wretched curse.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Let's kick him some more.</speak>

<speak who="CALCULON">
No, wait, let me explain. <info>(dramatically)</info> 
It all began one fateful night a thousand 
years ago.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You're a thousand 
years old? Your bio says you're 27!</speak>

<speak who="CALCULON">
Lies! I change my identity and upgrade 
my appearance every few decades to avoid 
suspicion. I was all of history's great 
acting robots: Acting Unit 0.8, Thespo-mat, 
David Duchovny!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Look, are you the original were-car 
or not?</speak>

<speak who="CALCULON">
No, but you are nearing the end of your 
search, for you see I was attacked by 
the original were-car.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Give us a name MacButt!</speak>

<speak who="CALCULON">
The year was 2019, and I was just a 
lowly robot arm...</speak>

<info>Flashback. 2019 - Car Factory.</info>

<speak who="CALCULON">
<info>(voice-over)</info> ...working in an automotive 
research lab. I was working on Project 
Satan......a savage, intelligent military 
vehicle built from the most evil parts 
of the most evil cars in all the world. 
The steering wheel from Hitler's staff 
car, the left-turn signal from Charles 
Manson's VW, the windshield from that 
car that played Knight Rider.</speak>

<info>Flashback ends.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Knight Rider wasn't evil.</speak>

<speak who="CALCULON">
His windshield wipers were. It didn't 
come up much in the show though. Anyway...</speak>

<info>Flashback. 2019 - Car Factory.</info>

<speak who="CALCULON">
<info>(voice-over)</info> ...Only after bringing 
Project Satan to life did they discover 
they had made a horrible mistake.  For 
you see, it was pure evil.</speak>

<info>Project Satan's headlight light up and it rams Calculon. It 
honks and howls.</info>

<info>Flashback ends.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
So what happened to Project Satan?</speak>

<info>Paris. Bender. Leela and Fry stand near the Eiffel Tower looking 
around.</info>

<speak who="CALCULON">
<info>(voice-over)</info> It's either in Paris, or 
much more likely...</speak>

<info>Outside Chrysler Factory.</info>

<speak who="CALCULON">
<info>(voice-over)</info> ...still in the abandoned 
automotive lab.</speak>

<info>The Planet Express ship lands outside the building. Someone 
has sprayed "Anti" in front of "Chrysler".</info>

<info>Chrysler Factory. Rats run around the deserted building. Leela, 
Bender and Fry open the door and walk in.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
You guys distract the were-car and I'll 
kill it by plugging its exhaust pipe 
with this silver potato.</speak>

<info>Time Lapse. The crew peer over a pile of debris.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
<info>(whispering)</info> Psst, there it is.</speak>

<info>Project Satan is parked next to a furnace, sobbing.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
It looks so unhappy. Excuse me? Are 
you Project Satan?  Don't be afraid. 
We know what you are.</speak>

<speak who="PROJECT SATAN">
You do?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Would you like us to...put you out of 
your misery?</speak>

<speak who="PROJECT SATAN">
Misery? What misery? I love killing 
people! Squishing them till their organs 
squirt out like chunky mustard.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Look, everyone love killing people, 
but I don't wanna hurt my friends.</speak>

<info>He puts his arms around Fry and Leela. Fry walks off in a huff. 
A bell rings 12 outside. Bender's arms turn into wheels.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Oh no! It's midnight.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Hey, this is starting to feel pretty 
good!</speak>

<info>His legs morph into wheels and he and Project Satan laugh. Project 
Satan turns to Fry and Leela.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Fry, distract him.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Hey, Project Satan! Over here! I'm 
a blind pedestrian. 20 points!</speak>

<info>Project Satan chases Fry and Leela grabs hold of its back bumper.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Oh no, there's no exhaust pipe!</speak>

<speak who="PROJECT SATAN">
That's right, thanks to Ed Begley Jr.'s 
electric motor, the most evil propulsion 
system ever conceived!  Take whichever 
one you want.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Oh boy, I feel like a car in a candy 
store!</speak>

<info>He chooses Fry and tries to ram him. Fry runs away.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
<info>(gasping)</info> Yes! He chose me! He's trying 
to kill me! Leela, I'm so happy!  <info>(talking)</info> 
Oh, thanks Bender.  <info>(choking)</info> Too tight! 
Too tight!</speak>

<info>Bender's steering wheel starts hitting Fry in the face. Project 
Satan chases Leela into a crash test area and up a huge ramp. 
She dives off the end of it.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Whoa!</speak>

<info>Project Satan screams as he flies over several yellow school 
buses. Bender drives up the other ramp and he, Project Satan 
and Fry scream as they fly past each other. Project Satan drives 
down the other ramp and laughs, then screams as it realises it 
is about to go face-first into a very, very, very, very, very 
hot furnace. It slams its brakes on but doesn't stop in time. 
It lands in the furnace and melts. It's headlight flash purple. 
Bender's antenna beeps as the were-car program uninstalls itself. 
He starts turning back into his normal self.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Uh-oh.</speak>

<info>He runs down the other ramp and falls over, back to his old 
robot self.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Bender, you're cured! But what happened 
to Fry?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
<info>(crying)</info> I must've killed him. He's 
my best friend and I killed him. I never 
felt so empty inside.</speak>

<info>His door opens. Fry is inside.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Bender, I'm alive!  You didn't hurt 
me at all. But I know you wanted to, 
and that's what matters.  Here's to 
you.</speak>

<info>He drinks.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Hey, that's my last beer, you bastard. 
I'll kill you!</speak>

<info>Fry raises his bottle.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
I'll kill you too, buddy. I'll kill 
you too!</speak>

<info>Bender starts to choke him.</info>

<info>THE END</info>
