                         You couldn't have picked a better time 
                         to dump the ship Bender!

                         Eh, the moment seemed right. Call me 
                         old fashioned but I like a dump to be 
                         as memorable as it is devastating.

                         I know, I know. Look Ship, if there's 
                         one thing I learnt from my mutual breakup 
                         with Sean that was totally mutual its 
                         that happiness can only come from within
