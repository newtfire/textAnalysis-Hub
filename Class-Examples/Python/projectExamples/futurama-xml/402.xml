                          In what has become a winter tradition, 
                         members of the Zarlon 7 Polar Bear Club 
                         today took the plunge into a river of 
                         liquid ammonia.

                          In all the tinsel and terror of the 
                         holiday season we too often underestimate 
                         that murderous brute better known as 
                         Santa Claus. With images of last year's 
                         gingerbread massacre freshly baked into 
                         our memories, I remind you to bolt your 
                         doors, say goodbye to your pets and 
                         lock your children in the closet. This 
                         is Walter Cronkite saying "I told you 
                         so".
