                         Oh Lord. Hiking is always such a strain 
                         on the buttocks.

                         It wasn't a bird's nest falling. That

                         I meant the sound Bigfoot just made. 
                         He's been sighted a lot in this area 
                         recently. Just last week a blind hiker 
                         felt him!

                         Of course I do! Bigfoot's my hero. Growing 
                         up, he was the celebrity I most identified 
                         with.

                         Holy macaroni!  I can't believe I'm 
                         seeing Bigfoot! He's in focus! Oh I've 
                         waited my entire life for this moment!

                         Of course not. I'm just gonna tranquilise 
                         him so I can chop off his feet as proof 
                         he exists. Then dump him back in the 
                         wild. He'll do fine.

                         Now leave this gentle sasquatch - or 
                         wood ape - in peace so I can finally 
                         and at long last harvest this pathetic 
                         human's lower horn.

                         Wait. What am I saying? If I poach this 
                         beast's lower horn, am I any better 
                         than that ranger with his demented foot
