<info>The Planet Express ship flies over Duraflame National Forest 
and lands at a camping site.</info>

<info>Forest. The entire Planet Express staff are on a company outing 
and are hiking through the woods.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Oh Lord. Hiking is always such a strain 
on the buttocks.</speak>

<info>He isn't actually walking, he is sat on a giant pair of legs 
about 5ft high. A noise noises.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Shh! What was that sound?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
It wasn't a bird's nest falling. That 
sounds like this.  Aww, they're so cute 
when they're scared!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
I meant the sound Bigfoot just made. 
He's been sighted a lot in this area 
recently. Just last week a blind hiker 
felt him!</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Don't tell me you actually believe in 
Bigfoot you blathering ninny-hammer!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Of course I do! Bigfoot's my hero. Growing 
up, he was the celebrity I most identified 
with.</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Why?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
'Cause he was a loner who hated the 
popular monsters yet longed to be one.</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
<info>(sadly)</info> I can so relate to that.</speak>

<info>He cries and hugs Leela. She isn't impressed.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Ugh, enough emotions! This isn't a fat 
camp for God sake. <info>(quietly)</info> Though 
you wouldn't know it from looking.</speak>

<info>Campsite. The crew set up camp. Zoidberg eats something, Leela 
and Amy set up their pop-up tent, Fry hammers his tent pegs into 
the ground with a frying pan and Bender lazes around with his 
arms and legs tied round a tree so it looks like he is lying 
in a hammock.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Ahh!</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Bender, if you want to sleep in the 
tent tonight, you're welcome to join 
me and Hermes for a little "just friends" 
spooning.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Nah, I'm comfy out here under the stars. 
Real comfy!</speak>

<info>Ranger Station. The Planet Express employees and other campers 
are gathered in the log building. The ranger has set up a projection 
screen at the front of the room and they all sit on rowed benches.</info>

<speak who="RANGER PARK">
Hey I'm Ranger Park the park ranger.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
I get it!</speak>

<speak who="RANGER PARK">
Now since this area's a National Bigfoot 
Reserve we'll start with a short film 
about Bigfoot while I make a few phonecalls.</speak>

<info>He dims the lights and turns on the projector. "Bigfoot" appears 
on the screen.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
That proves it!</speak>

<info>In the movie the Clearcutter cuts down some trees.</info>

<info>Park talks on the phone at the back of the room.</info>

<speak who="RANGER PARK">
It should say "Top Quality Exercycle 
For Sale" and could you put "Top Quality" 
in bold...? You can't? OK whatever.</speak>

<info>In the movie someone photographs the woods.</info>

<info>The movie ends with "The End" and "MMCMLXII "- Most Rights Reserved." 
Park hangs up.</info>

<speak who="RANGER PARK">
I-I gotta call you back.  Alright, questions?</speak>

<speak who="SAL">
Yeah. Have yous ever seens Bigfeet?</speak>

<speak who="RANGER PARK">
Technically no. But I do see him each 
night in my dreams and each day in the 
silent faces of hairy children.</speak>

<info>Farnsworth stands up and shakes his fist.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
<info>(shouting)</info> Bunk! Bunk I say! Bring me 
a bag full of Bigfoot's droppings or 
shut up!</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Shut up!</speak>

<info>Bender stands up and points out the window.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Oh my God its Bigfoot!</speak>

<info>Park holds up a camera and autograph book and runs to the window.</info>

<speak who="RANGER PARK">
Where?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Eh he's gone. He says you should keep 
wasting your life though.</speak>

<speak who="PETUNIA">
Oh! I saw Bigfoot crushing cars at the 
county fair!</speak>

<speak who="RANGER PARK">
What you saw was Bigfoot the monster 
truck. But thanks for a great question.</speak>

<speak who="PETUNIA">
Ohh...</speak>

<info>She walks out muttering. Fry puts his hand up.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Sir, if I may, why don't you set up 
like a billion video cameras in the 
woods and see if he walks by one.</speak>

<speak who="RANGER PARK">
Ah, that would be very expensive. And 
most people who believe in Bigfoot are 
broke.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Hey look! Bigfoot! He's back!</speak>

<info>Park falls for it again.</info>

<speak who="RANGER PARK">
Where?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Up your face!  Everybody do the Bender!</speak>

<info>And he does.</info>

<info>Campsite. Night has fallen. Leela and Amy lie on a blanket while 
the others sit around the fire.</info>

<speak who="AMY">
The sky out here is amazing. Look at 
all those satellites.</speak>

<info>The satellites fly around the sky like shooting stars. A Bachelor 
Chow ad flies by along with a Drink Shiz! ad and one that reads 
Top Quality Exercycle For Sale.</info>

<info>Time Lapse. Everyone has turned in for the night.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Goodnight employess.</speak>

<info>He disappears into his tent.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
Goodnight.</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Goodnight Hubert.</speak>

<info>He and Hermes' silhouettes lie down. Amy's nude silhouette zips 
closed her and Leela's tent. Leela's silhouette sprays her boots 
with something. Fry pokes his head of his tent.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
You doin' alright out there buddy?</speak>

<info>Bender's head lights up like an insectocutor.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Better than these gnats!  That guy won't 
be goin' home to his kids!</speak>

<info>Time Lapse. Everyone is sound asleep. Bender shivers and rotates 
his head around him like an owl. Something coos.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Who's that? A wolf? Or some kind of 
boogen? Oh God I wish I was safe inside 
a tent.  <info>(deep voice)</info> Fry, Fry wake 
up! It's me! Bigface!</speak>

<info>Cut to: Fry's Tent. Fry wakes up.</info>

<info>Cut to: Campsite. Fry emerges from his tent brushing his teeth.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Bigfoot? Bigfoot?</speak>

<info>He runs off into the woods. Bender emerges from the rock, chuckling. 
He crawls into Fry's tent, crawls around panting like a dog and 
finally lies down and turns out the light.</info>

<info>Cut to: Forest.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Bigfoot? Is that you? I'm not like the 
others Bigfoot. I see through your monster 
coatings to the gentle loner inside. 
I bet you have a wounded racoon friend 
that you tenderly nurse back to health 
and go......and in the end they shoot 
you. But you teach us about things. 
Oh, it's a flying saucer. <info>(shouting)</info> 
Excuse me? You can't park here. The 
parking area's over there.  Wow nice 
tube!  Hey. Hey what's the big idea? 
Stop abducting me. Why does your vanity 
plate say "Probe 1"?</speak>

<info>He screams as he disappears inside the ship. The pipe retracts 
back into the ship and it heads skyward.</info>

<info>Campsite. Morning has broken. Everyone crawls out of their tents 
and yawn and stretch. Leela walks down the river and dunks her 
hands in.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
There's nothing so refreshing as the 
clean, crisp taste of old Canadian beer!</speak>

<info>She pulls a bottle out of the river and downs it. Hermes juggles 
a toilet roll in his hands.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
Well, see you in an hour. I gotta go 
do some business behind that tree.</speak>

<info>Behind the tree Hermes attaches the toilet roll to a calculator 
and does some business - calculations. Bender struggles inside 
Fry's tent and finally rips it apart and stands up.</info>

<speak who="AMY">
Bender, wasn't that Fry's tent?</speak>

<info>Bender makes mocking noises.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Bender raises a good point, where is 
Fry?</speak>

<info>Cut to: Forest. Fry stumbles through the thicket with his back 
turned ï¿½ la The Blair Witch Project. A rat pokes its head out 
of a packet of Cheez Nubs and screams.</info>

<info>Cut to: Campsite. Fry reaches the edge of the woods and walks 
into the campsite, still with his back turned. He sounds like 
his nose is blocked.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Amy, you won't believe what happened......it 
was so scary that you wouldn't -  I 
know but listen it gets even scarier.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Fry! What in Sega Genesis happened to 
you?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
That's what I'm trying to tell you. 
See -  Why are you all staring at me 
like that? Is there something on my 
face?</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
Uh...no.</speak>

<info>Fry has no nose.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Someone should tell him.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Tell me what?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Nothing.</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Well I have a lot of experience telling 
patients bad news so, let me break it 
to him gently.  <info>(shouting)</info> Fry you have 
no nose! Your nose is gone! You have 
no nose on your face! Where it is I 
can't say but on your face it's not!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
What?</speak>

<info>He pokes his face and looks at his refelction in Bender's door. 
He screams.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Aww, I think it's sweet! You chopped 
off your nose so you could look more 
like your hero. Me, Bender!</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Which last night?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
In the woods, I was walking. For Bigfoot, 
looking and then aliens beamed me up.</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
Were they little grey dudes with big 
oval heads?  I don't get that gesture. 
Am I wrong?</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Cheer up friend. When we get home a 
high quality prosthesis will have you 
looking good as new.</speak>

<info>Fry smiles.</info>

<info>Planet Express: Meeting Room. Fry is sat at the table wearing 
joke glasses, nose and moustache.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
I'm a pathetic freak. My life is ruined.</speak>

<info>Hermes laughs.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
Man, you are such a jokester!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
I'll never have another moment of happiness.</speak>

<info>Everyone else falls about laughing.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
I know you're trying to mask your pain 
with humour but don't worry. I'm sure 
the Professor can clone you a new nose.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Well there's no sense fretting. Good 
Lord you're ugly! The fact is your nose 
is gone and we'll never find out who 
did it or why.</speak>

<info>Enter Bender panting and gasping.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
<info>(gasping)</info> Guys, guys! There's something 
on television.</speak>

<info>Spin to: Planet Express: Lounge. The crew sit and stand, watching 
a news report.</info>

<speak who="LINDA"><info>ON TV</info>
Alien abductions: Until now, a harmless 
nuisance. But recently they've taken 
on a sinister dimension as unsuspecting 
victims are returned...without noses!</speak>

<info>Behind her a picture of a normal man changes to a picture of 
a man with no nose.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Like me!</speak>

<speak who="MORBO"><info>ON TV</info>
The culprits: Shameless poachers, hunting 
humans without a permit.</speak>

<info>The scene on TV changes to a picture of a grey alien with a 
gun over his shoulder. He holds a nose. Back to the studio.</info>

<speak who="LINDA"><info>ON TV</info>
The valuable nose or "human horn" fetches 
a high price on alien worlds as an aphrodisiac.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
My nose is an aphrodisiac?  I'm gonna 
drop a barf!</speak>

<speak who="MORBO"><info>ON TV</info>
Demand for human horn is great. Due 
in part to titilating scenes from depraved 
alien TV programmes too filthy for Earth 
broadcast. Let's watch.</speak>

<info>The scene changes to two Neptunian lovers on a bed together. 
The man holds up a cushion with two human horns on it. The woman 
gasps.</info>

<info>He grates a horn onto her shoulder and licks it off. They make 
out. Fry turns the TV off.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Blech! We have to track down my nose 
before some alien snarfs it and does 
the worm. Who's in?</speak>

<info>Leela stand up.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Me and Bender and maybe Zoidberg if 
he feels like it.</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
No I'm good.</speak>

<info>The ship flies towards the huge Galalctic Bazaar: Offering Legal 
Items etc. It is a run down space station with things sticking 
out of it.</info>

<info>Cut to: Galactic Bazaar. The place is filled with aliens. The 
trio walk past Joe Camel who tries on some shades. Fry is wearing 
a strap on red nose. They walk past a stall where an alien buys 
something.</info>

<speak who="ALIEN">
Lets see, I'll have a pancreas, two 
sphincters and a large colon.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
It's no use. We've been to ever scuzzy 
bazaar in the galaxy, including Pottery 
Barn.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Wait, what's that?</speak>

<info>She points at The Beast With Two Bucks Sex Shoppe.</info>

<info>Cut to: Sex Shoppe. Enter Fry, Bender and Leela. The salesman 
has a chameleon-like head.</info>

<speak who="SALESMAN">
Welcome friends. How may I pervert you?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Uh, I'm looking for human horn.</speak>

<speak who="SALESMAN">
<info>(whispering)</info> Shh! You're not cops right?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Of course not. In fact he's a crook.</speak>

<info>She points at Bender.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Yep. Stolen Pez anyone?</speak>

<info>He holds up a Calculon-head Pez thing and hands them around. 
The salesman eats it and pulls back a curtain.</info>

<speak who="SALESMAN">
Right this way.</speak>

<info>Back Room. The salesman gets something from off a high shelf 
and unwraps it. Inside is lots of human noses.</info>

<speak who="SALESMAN">
Human horn. So fresh you can still see 
the eyeglass marks.</speak>

<info>Fry looks at the noses.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Nope, uh-uh, eww!  Now look, this is 
the nose we want. Did you sell it to 
somebody?</speak>

<speak who="SALESMAN">
I'm sorry sir but due to the perverted 
nature of our business, customer records 
are strictly confidential.  Right this 
way.</speak>

<info>Cut to: Back Back Room. The salesman pulls another curtain across. 
In the room is a TV and a wall lined with video tapes.</info>

<speak who="SALESMAN">
I video tape everyone who comes in here 
so I can blackmail them later.  Hey, 
I'm a porno dealing monster, what do 
I care what you think? Here's the weirdo 
who bought your horn.</speak>

<info>He puts the tape in the machine. On the screen a familiar alien 
walks into the Sex Shoppe badly disguised. Leela gasps.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
That's Lrrr! Ruler of the planet Omicron 
Persei 8!</speak>

<speak who="LRRR"><info>ON TV</info>
You got any uh, you know...</speak>

<speak who="SALESMAN"><info>ON TV</info>
Speak up! You're muttering!</speak>

<speak who="LRRR"><info>ON TV</info>
I said uh... <info>(whispering)</info> human horn?</speak>

<speak who="LRRR"><info>ON TV</info>
Oh no no, I'm just some guy. Ruler of 
the planet Omicron Persei 8!</speak>

<info>The dealer hands him a horn over the counter. Fry and Leela 
nod to each other.</info>

<info>The ship flies toward Omicron Persei 8 and lands outside the 
castle.</info>

<info>Omicroninan Castle. Lrrr and Nd-Nd sit on thrones. Guards stand 
either side of the trio who stand before Lrrr and Nd-Nd.</info>

<speak who="LRRR">
So let me get this straight: If I buy 
eight caramello bars, you all get to 
go to some camp.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Yep. That's exactly the lie we used 
to get past your guards.</speak>

<info>Fry steps forward and bows.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Oh great space king. I humbly beg you 
to return my human horn.</speak>

<info>Lrrr acts like he doesn't know what Fry is talking about.</info>

<speak who="LRRR">
Uh, human horn? How ridiculous! Why 
would virile male like Lrrr need human 
horn? I don't even know what it's for. 
What is it, something you-you put in 
salad dressing?</speak>

<speak who="ND-ND">
Like you've ever seen a salad.</speak>

<speak who="LRRR">
My weight is appropriate and attractive!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Whoa, you guys have issues!</speak>

<speak who="LRRR">
She has issues! I'm fine! But there's 
no human horn around here so, make friends 
with the door.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
<info>(sadly)</info> Alright. I give up. I guess 
I'll just go home and marry a skunk.</speak>

<info>He cries.</info>

<speak who="ND-ND">
Oh let's just give it to him.  Here.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
My nose! Light of my face!</speak>

<speak who="LRRR">
Uh, what is that? How do you have that 
Nd-Nd?  I've never seen it before. My 
friend left it here.</speak>

<info>Fry takes his nose out of the box and puts it on his face.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Hold still Fry. I can reattach it with 
my emergency face laser.</speak>

<info>She presses a button on her wristamajig and a beam seams the 
nose to Fry's face. It also burns his cheek a little.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Hey! You burned my cheek!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Yeah sorry I wasn't really concentrating.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
No I mean the singed flesh, I can smell 
it!  Those lilacs on the table.</speak>

<speak who="LRRR">
At least someone noticed.</speak>

<speak who="ND-ND">
For the last time I don't like lilacs! 
Your first wife was the one who liked 
lilacs.</speak>

<speak who="LRRR">
She also liked to shut up!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Well, great seeing you, I guess we'll 
be on our -</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Yo, highness! Uh, just out of robo-curiosity, 
why would you use a guy's nose for an 
aphrodisiac instead of his...you know...wing 
dang doodle?</speak>

<speak who="LRRR">
But I thought the horn was the human 
wing dang doodle?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
No sir-chee! The main event, so to speak, 
is downstairs near the wallet. Ever 
seen soccer players line up to block 
a free kick? They ain't covering their 
noses I'll say that much! Well, seeya!</speak>

<info>He starts to leave.</info>

<speak who="LRRR">
Interesting. The trousers conceal a 
tiny secondary horn.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Hey, what've you heard?</speak>

<speak who="LRRR">
<info>(shouting)</info> Guards! Seize him!  Prepare 
to harvest the lower horn!</speak>

<info>Fry looks around scared.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
OK, you can have my nose.</speak>

<info>He pulls it off.</info>

<speak who="LRRR">
Guards!</speak>

<speak who="GUARD #1">
Yeah?</speak>

<speak who="LRRR">
Remove the human's lower horn and prepare 
it to be eaten by me.</speak>

<speak who="ND-ND">
In other words slop a lot of ketchup 
and salt on it!</speak>

<speak who="LRRR">
Then bring it to our royal bedchamber 
and put it in the sock drawer with all 
the other things that have failed to 
arouse my passion for this woman.</speak>

<info>The second guard takes out a whizzy buzzy cutting thing. Fry 
squeals.</info>

<speak who="GUARD #2">
Remove pants!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Wait! I'm usually the first guy to toot 
my own lower horn -</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
<info>(shouting)</info> I'll say!</speak>

<info>He hoots.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
But in this case I just don't think 
it'll do any good.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
<info>(shouting)</info> That's what she said!</speak>

<info>He hoots again.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Let's face it. You two have deep relationship 
problems that can't be solved by an 
aphrodisiac.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
However huge it might be.</speak>

<speak who="ND-ND">
So what do you suggest, painfully single 
human?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Well, why don't you think back to what 
brought you together in the first place?</speak>

<speak who="ND-ND">
Ohh I don't know. Lrrr used to be so 
tender.</speak>

<info>Lrrr groans.</info>

<speak who="LRRR">
I only wrote that poem to test my printer.</speak>

<speak who="ND-ND">
We'd go walking in the woods and Lrrr 
would find injured little tinkle-bunnies 
and nurse them back to health.</speak>

<speak who="LRRR">
Yes but I'm the one who injured them!</speak>

<speak who="ND-ND">
Oh shush. You stepped on them by accident 
and then you cried all night. That's 
the kind of sensitive man you used to 
be.</speak>

<speak who="LRRR">
And you used to wear a size-3 cape. 
<info>(shouting)</info> But not anymore! Now bring 
me that lower horn while I'm still in 
the mood.</speak>

<info>The guard starts the whizzy thing again.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Wh-What if we helped you get your passion 
back without the hassle of mutilating 
me?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Yeah, we know a great place in the mountains. 
We could take you there for a romantic 
dinner under the stars.</speak>

<speak who="ND-ND">
Hmm, sounds interesting. But he would 
never do it.</speak>

<speak who="LRRR">
Like hell I wouldn't. I'm not gonna 
be blamed for not going!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Then it's a deal. We get one night. 
I keep my horn as long as you two end 
up doing the horizontal monster mash.</speak>

<info>Bender hoots, laughs insanely and chuckles.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
I don't get it!</speak>

<info>Forest. Back at Duraflame Lrrr and Nd-Nd are seated at a table 
at night. The trees around them have lights strung around them. 
Enter Bender carrying a box of Monsieur Carton.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Bonjour. May I offer you a box of wine 
for the edge of the table?</speak>

<speak who="LRRR">
No thanks. Just water please. Tap water!</speak>

<speak who="ND-ND">
<info>(sarcastic)</info> Oh big spender!</speak>

<speak who="LRRR">
<info>(shouting)</info> That's it, this date is over! 
Waiter!</speak>

<info>The guards wheel Fry up to the table in a cage. He is dressed 
in a snappy suit.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
So, what can I get you this evening?</speak>

<speak who="LRRR">
Your lower horn!</speak>

<info>Fry squeals.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
I'll just start you off with some bread. 
Some sexy, arousing bread!</speak>

<speak who="LRRR">
Fine but none of that whole-grain goat 
food! And bring plenty of melted butter.</speak>

<info>Nd-Nd groans.</info>

<speak who="ND-ND">
Why don't you just inject some fat straight 
into your ass and cut out the middle 
man!</speak>

<speak who="LRRR">
One of these days Nd-Nd, bang, zoom, 
straight to the third moon of Omicron 
Persei 8!</speak>

<info>Time Lapse. Lrrr and Nd-Nd are still eating and Fry is still 
in his cage. A guard is sat by a tree.</info>

<speak who="LRRR"><info>EATING</info>
Mmm, this jerked chicken is good! I 
think I'll have Fry's lower horn jerked.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
<info>(shouting)</info> It's used to it!</speak>

<info>He hoots. Fry is wheeled to the table.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
So uh, how are you two sneaky poopums 
doing?</speak>

<speak who="ND-ND">
Poorly.</speak>

<speak who="LRRR">
My wife is right for once. There is 
very little magic in the air. Ready 
the lower horn transport vessel.</speak>

<info>A guard pours some ice into a cooler. Fry squeals.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Boy, who knew a cooler could also make 
a handy wang coffin?  Hey, uh mind if 
I stick these in here?</speak>

<speak who="GUARD #1">
Go for it.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Don't worry Fry. Things look bad but 
I still have a trump card. The most 
beautiful love song ever written.  (singing 
badly) And I will always love you......will 
always love you...</speak>

<speak who="ND-ND">
The humans are attacking.</speak>

<speak who="LRRR">
Pluck the lower horn and let's get out 
of here!</speak>

<info>The guard starts the cutter.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Quick Fry, run for it!</speak>

<info>He pushes Fry's cage and it rolls away, bouncing down hills 
and through trees.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Come on freedom cage! Roll me to safety! 
Yes! I never thought I'd escape with 
my doodle, but I pulled it out!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
<info>(shouting)</info> Just like at the movie theatre!</speak>

<info>He hoots and Lrrr grabs Fry.</info>

<speak who="LRRR">
Give me that!</speak>

<info>Fry screams. The guard starts the whizzer and the other opens 
the cooler. Leela gasps. Something growls. Bigfoot emerges from 
the trees.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Bigfoot! He's real! I knew it. The Loch 
Ness Monster's book was right!</speak>

<info>Bigfoot stops and sniffs the Omicronians.</info>

<speak who="LRRR">
Well, hello there my furry friend.</speak>

<speak who="ND-ND">
Look at his adorable little feet.  Yes 
you are a cutie-pie.</speak>

<info>Enter Ranger Park with his camera.</info>

<speak who="RANGER PARK">
Holy macaroni!  I can't believe I'm 
seeing Bigfoot! He's in focus! Oh I've 
waited my entire life for this moment!</speak>

<info>He pulls a gun out from behind him and points it at Bigfoot. 
Everyone mumbles.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
What are you doing with that?</speak>

<info>Lrrr steps forward.</info>

<speak who="LRRR">
You're going to kill this innocent giganto?</speak>

<speak who="RANGER PARK">
Of course not. I'm just gonna tranquilise 
him so I can chop off his feet as proof 
he exists. Then dump him back in the 
wild. He'll do fine.</speak>

<info>He aims the gun. Lrrr steps in front. Nd-Nd stands at his side.</info>

<speak who="LRRR">
You'll have to get through me first.</speak>

<speak who="RANGER PARK">
OK, nighty nght.</speak>

<info>He shoots but the tranquiliser dart bounces off Lrrr. Lrrr vapourises 
the gun.</info>

<speak who="LRRR">
Now leave this gentle sasquatch - or 
wood ape - in peace so I can finally 
and at long last harvest this pathetic 
human's lower horn.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Yeah!</speak>

<info>He screams.</info>

<speak who="LRRR">
Wait. What am I saying? If I poach this 
beast's lower horn, am I any better 
than that ranger with his demented foot 
lust? Yes. But not by enough.</speak>

<info>Park walks behind Bigfoot and cuts off a tuft of his fur.</info>

<speak who="RANGER PARK">
Score!</speak>

<info>Bigfoot scratches himself.</info>

<speak who="LRRR">
This human's lower horn is one of God's 
creatures, a living thing. And all living 
things, large and small...</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
<info>(shouting)</info> In this case "small"!</speak>

<info>He hoots.</info>

<speak who="LRRR">
...have diginity. And a spark of divine.</speak>

<info>He cries.</info>

<speak who="ND-ND">
That's the gentle sensitive poet warlord 
I fell in love with!</speak>

<info>She hugs him and they both crush Fry between them. He squeezes 
his way out. Lrrr and Nd-Nd kiss. Bender, Fry and Leela avoid 
watching.</info>

<speak who="LRRR">
<info>(shouting)</info> Uh, you'll wanna retreat 
to a safe, 500 metre radius!</speak>

<info>They start running.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Well Fry, it looks like you get to hold 
onto your lower horn.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
As usual!  <info>(shouting)</info> Run away!</speak>

<info>They leg it and Bigfoot stays and watches Lrrr and Nd-Nd on 
the floor. Then he walks off into the thick forest.</info>

<speak who="SCIENTIST"><info>ON TV</info>
I have combined the DNA of the world's 
most evil animals, to make the most
