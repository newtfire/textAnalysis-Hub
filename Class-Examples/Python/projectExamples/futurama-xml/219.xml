                         part is, I found my exact feelings expressed 
                         in a greeting card. 
 
               You created me, Mom

               So I guess you're to blame

                         No, Comrade Bender. Liquor is the opiate 
                         of the human bourgeoisie.

                         In the glorious robot workers' paradise, 
                         there will be no liquor. Only efficient 
                         synthetic fuels.

                         Plan? What plan? I thought this was 
                         a spontaneous whirlwind of hot, dry 
                         sex.

                         Look: It started out as a calculated 
                         plot to rummage through your underwear. 
                         But once I got in there, I found more 
                         - much more. And now I want to shout 
                         our love from the rooftops. Perhaps 
                         I'll breed some sort of albino shouting 
                         gorilla.
