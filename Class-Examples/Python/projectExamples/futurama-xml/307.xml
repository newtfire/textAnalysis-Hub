               <note>A planet, Tweenis 12 hangs in the void of space. Glowing cracks 
               start to appear on the surface. There are several explosions 
               and the planet explodes, the shockwave and debris flying out 
               in all directions. A group of glowing, flying brains fly away 
               from what is left of the planet. A caption tells us Tweenis 12 
               was one day's brain flight from Earth.</note>
 
               
               <note>Madison Cube Garden. The Planet Express staff are at a pet show. 
               There are stalls selling cream, Soylent Chow, Kibbles 'n' Snouts 
               and flea collars for giant fleas. Leela carries Nibbler and a 
               big purple bag over her shoulder.</note>

                         There is but one being that can resist 
                         them. A child of destiny whose bizzare

                         to the Brain Spawn attack.  He is the 
                         hope of the universe.  The fate of your

                         his special mind.

                         Wishful thinking. We have long since 
                         evolved beyond the need for asses.  
                         Odd. My stupefaction field is having 
                         no effect on your ability to think.

                         That's right. And I think you'll find 
                         that a little knowledge is a dangerous 
                         thing!  OK, better think of a new plan. 
                         Come on, Fry, think!  Thinking...thinking...

                         Hey! Thinking hurts him. Maybe I can
