               that looks like a metal detector at an airport. It doesn't beep 
               and he casually walks on. Fry walks under and it beeps and red 
               lights flash. He gasps.</note>

                         It's like his personality is totally 
                         different now! Oh, maybe this upgrade 
                         isn't such a good idea.

                         I'd like to give Robot 1-X a big smooch

                         But I destroyed the technology of the 
                         world. I ran on the beach and felt the 
                         sand between my foot cups.

                         Oof. If that stuff wasn't real, how 
                         can I be sure anything is real? Is it 
                         not possible, nay probable, that my 
                         whole life is just a product of my or 
                         someone else's imagination?

                         Well, I guess reality is what you make 
                         of it.  Oh, thanks baby!
