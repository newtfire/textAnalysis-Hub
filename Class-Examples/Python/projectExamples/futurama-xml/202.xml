<info>Planet Express: Meeting Room. Bender, Fry and Leela are sat 
around the table. Bender has a bottle of L�brau. Fry has a can 
of Slurm and isn't wearing his jacket. Enter Farnsworth with 
a large crate on a hover trolley.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Good news, everyone.  We've got a very 
special delivery today.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Who's it going to?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Me.</speak>

<info>Bender dusts off his hands.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Another job well done.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
No, I need it shipped to my office at 
Mars University.  It's a little experiment 
that may well win me the Nobel Prize.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
In what field?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
I don't care, they all pay the same.</speak>

<info>Fry stands next to the box.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Is it dangerous?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Oh, my, no.  Off we go!</speak>

<info>Opening Credits. There is a remixed version of the normal theme. 
Caption: Transmitido en Martian en SAP.</info>

<info>The Planet Express ship flies towards Mars.</info>

<info>Mars University Campus. The ship flies over a sign reading "Mars 
University. Knowledge Brings Fear" and lands in an empty space 
on the campus grounds.</info>

<info>Time Lapse. Farnsworth takes Fry, Leela and Bender on a tour 
of the university grounds. They walk past a statue of a big skulled 
Martian with octopus-like tentacles wielding a huge laser gun 
on horseback.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Very impressive. Back in the 20th century 
we had no idea there was a university 
on Mars.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Well, in those days Mars was just a 
dreary, uninhabitable wasteland, uh, 
much like Utah. But unlike Utah, it 
was eventually made livable, when the 
university was founded in 2636.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
They planted traditional college foliage: 
ivy, trees, hemp. Soon the whole planet 
was terraformed.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Does that mean it's safe to breathe 
the air?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Of course.</speak>

<info>Fry takes some huge breaths.</info>

<info>Outside Wong Library. The building is quite big, with "Socrates 
| Vos Savant | Cognitron" written across the top.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Over here is Wong Library. It has the 
largest collection of literature in 
the Western universe.</speak>

<info>Fry peers through the glass.</info>

<info>Cut to: Mars University: Wong Library. The building is empty, 
save for a single table in the middle of the room with two discs 
labelled "Fiction" and "Non-Fiction" propped up on it. Fry whistles 
impressedly.</info>

<info>Cut to: Outside Wong Library.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Hey look. There's a chapter of my old 
robot fraternity; Epsilon Rho Rho.</speak>

<info>He points to a beaten up frat house with a neon "ERR" sign atop 
it. There is a smashed up car, some kegs, a cable spool being 
used as a table, some kegs, some dustbins, some kegs, some upturned 
chairs and some kegs around it.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
You went to college?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Of course, I'm a bender. I went to Bending 
College. I majored in Bending.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
What was your minor?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Robo-American Studies.</speak>

<info>Outside Epsilon Rho Rho House. Bender knocks on the door and 
a dorky fratbot answers it.</info>

<speak who="FRATBOT #1">
Are you here to fumigate the moose head?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Uh, no, actually I'm an Epsilon from 
way back.</speak>

<info>They both to a crazy handshake full of tugs, whizzes and the 
creation of cosmic clouds.</info>

<speak who="FRATBOT #1">
Eh, close enough. C'mon in.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Thanks. Here's your finger back.</speak>

<info>The fratbot takes it and Bender and the crew follow him in.</info>

<info>Cut to: Epsilon Rho Rho House. The place is a mess.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
All the coolest robots are in this fraternity.</speak>

<info>In another room two other fratbots sit at a table with a chessboard. 
The room is a mess, littered with empty pizza boxes, cans and 
books. A sock hangs over the moose head and there is a dartboard 
hanging on a door with darts jabbed in the wall around it. There 
is a pin-up of a Fembot and a L�brau poster with a human woman 
on it on another wall. One of the other fratbots looks like he 
has glasses painted onto his face and the other one is very fat. 
The glasses one looks at the chessboard. The game hasn't begun.</info>

<speak who="FRATBOT #2">
Mate in 143 moves.</speak>

<speak who="FRATBOT #3">
Oh, poo, you win again!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Uh-oh, nerds!</speak>

<speak who="FRATBOT #1">
Allow me to introduce myself. I'm Gearshift, 
chapter president. This is Oily, and 
this here is Fatbot.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
You're all losers. My name's Bender.</speak>

<info>The fratbots gasp.</info>

<speak who="OILY">
Bender from Bending State Bender? Wow, 
you're a legend around here!</speak>

<speak who="FATBOT">
I heard that in one single night you 
drank a whole keg, streaked across campus 
and crammed 58 humans into a phone booth.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
<info>(modest)</info> Yeah, well, a lot of 'em were 
children. Anyway I should get going.</speak>

<info>Leela comes down the stairs.</info>

<speak who="GEARSHIFT">
No, Bender, wait. We're the lamest frat 
on campus. Even Hillel has better parties 
than us. Please, you've gotta stay and 
teach us how to be cool.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Hmm, OK. But I'll need 10 kegs of beer, 
a continuous tape of Louie Louie and 
a regulation two-storey panty-raid ladder.</speak>

<info>Fatbot wiggles his fingers with excitement.</info>

<speak who="FATBOT">
Oh, boy! Oh, boy! Oh, boy!</speak>

<info>Mars University Campus. Fry, Leela and Farnsworth continue the 
tour.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
I tell you, being here really takes 
me back to my college days.</speak>

<info>Flashback. There is a snake boy stall and a water balloon stall 
where winners get a Bart and Homer Simpson doll. Fry stands by 
a booth called Coney Island Community College. A buck-toothed 
guy leans through a window wearing a gown and hat.</info>

<speak who="MAN #1">
Step right up, who wants to learn physics?</speak>

<info>Fry shrugs and walks in.</info>

<speak who="MAN #2">
Keep your hands inside the car at all 
times.</speak>

<info>Flashback ends.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Good old Coney Island College! Go Whitefish!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Don't take this the wrong way, Fry, 
but you don't seem like the educated 
type.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Oh, yeah?  Read it and weep. I'm a certified 
college dropout.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Please! Everyone knows 20th century 
colleges were basically expensive daycare 
centres.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
That's true. By current academic standards, 
you're merely a high school dropout.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
What?! That's not fair. I deserve the 
same respect any other college dropout 
gets. By God, I'm gonna enroll here 
at Mars University and drop out all 
over again!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
You won't last two weeks.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Aww, thanks for believing in me.</speak>

<info>Mars University Student Registration. A few people queue up 
in front of the enrolment tables for A-L and M-Y. Several aliens 
queue at Z. Fry joins the A-L line and leafs through a course 
catalogue. Amy wanders up behind him.</info>

<speak who="AMY">
Yo, classmate. What you takin'?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Oh, I don't know.  Hey, Professor, what 
are you teaching this semester?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Same thing I teach every semester: The 
mathematics of quantum neutrino fields. 
I made up the title so that no student 
would dare take it.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Mathematics of wanton burrito meals. 
I'll be there!</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Please, Fry, I don't know how to teach; 
I'm a professor!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
See you in class!</speak>

<info>Farnsworth grumbles as he walks off with his crate.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Oh!</speak>

<info>Mars University Campus. That night Bender runs around the Martian 
statue and checks the coast is clear. He beckons to the others 
and they run across the campus with a ladder. They lean it up 
against the side of a building and climb on. The ladder lifts 
them up to a window and they giggle as they peer through.</info>

<speak who="FATBOT">
This is gonna be great!</speak>

<info>Cut to: Sorority House. Sexy blondes pillow fight in their slinky 
underwear, another takes her towel off and steps into the shower 
and another takes a haiband out of her hair and starts typing 
on a Mac. The robots stare towards her chest then suddenly stare 
at the Mac.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Bingo!</speak>

<speak who="FATBOT">
Oh, mama!</speak>

<info>Gearshift wolf whistles. The Mac fizzles and suddenly goes off.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Oh, yeah! Someone's been a bad computer! 
Get a load of that!</speak>

<info>He zooms in and his eyes start to push him away from the glass.</info>

<info>Cut to: Mars University Campus. The ladder tips back and it 
and the fratbots crash into a building. Some guys wearing blue 
blazers and smoking pipes run out of Snooty House. The first, 
Meiderneyer, has brown hair and the second one, Chet, is blonde.</info>

<speak who="MEIDERNEYER">
I say, you've damaged our servants' 
quarters ... and our servants.</speak>

<speak who="CHET">
This time Robot House has gone too far.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Cheese it!</speak>

<info>They run off screaming.</info>

<speak who="FATBOT">
<info>(screaming)</info> They're gonna catch us!</speak>

<info>Financial Aid Dorm: Fry's Room. Fry looks around his new abode.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Hey, pretty nice for a single. Two desks, 
two chairs, a couple of beds.  A woodpecker.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
I think that's probably your roommate.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Oh, right, cool. <info>(shouting)</info> C'mon in, 
roomie!  <info>(talking)</info> What the--?</speak>

<speak who="MONKEY">
I call top bunk!  Ahh!</speak>

<info>Time Lapse. The monkey hums as it empties it's case. It takes 
out a toothbrush and toothpaste, a hairbrush and a hairdryer.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
My roommate's a monkey?</speak>

<speak who="MONKEY">
<info>(sarcastic)</info> Brilliant deduction, you're 
a credit to your species.</speak>

<info>Enter Farnsworth pushing the empty crate.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Ah, Fry, I see you've met Guenter!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
You know each other?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Guenter is my experiment. He was the 
top secret contents of this stinking 
crate.</speak>

<info>He lowers the crate and pats it.</info>

<speak who="GUENTER">
I'd rather live in a crate than share 
a room with this dork.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
So what makes Guenter talk?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Is he genetically engineered?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Oh, please! That's preposterous science-fiction 
mumbo-jumbo. Guenter's intelligence 
actually lies in his electronium hat 
which harnesses the power of sunspots 
to produce cognitive radiation.</speak>

<info>Fry scratches his head in confusion. Guenter scoffs.</info>

<speak who="GUENTER">
You're wasting your breath, Professor. 
He'll never understand a word of it.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
I understood the word "hat"!</speak>

<info>He reaches for the hat and Guenter leaps back.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Please, stop bickering. I arranged that 
you be roommates for a reason: So I'd 
only have to remember one phone number. 
Now shake hands and make up.</speak>

<info>They reluctantly do. Fry holds up a banana.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
You want a banana?</speak>

<speak who="GUENTER">
I don't eat bananas. I prefer banana-flavoured 
energy bars made from tofu.</speak>

<info>Fry narrows his eyes.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
I don't like you.</speak>

<info>Mars University: 20th Century History Lecture Hall. The teacher 
scrawls "20th Century History" on the blackboard with a piece 
of chalk and presses a button which converts it to clean text. 
Guenter is sat to his left and Amy two seats left. Fry chuckles.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
This is gonna be a cakewalk!</speak>

<speak who="TEACHER">
Welcome to the history of the 20th century. 
Look to your left, then to your right. 
Then in nine other directions. One of 
the 12 of you will not pass this class.</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
Boring.  Let's hear about Walter Mondale 
already!</speak>

<speak who="TEACHER">
Be forewarned: The only sure way to 
get an A in this class is to have lived 
in the 20th century.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Swish!</speak>

<info>He swishes his hands. The teacher presses a button in front 
of him marked "Fry" and Fry gets electrocuted.</info>

<speak who="TEACHER">
You were saying, Mr. Fry?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
I'm from the 20th century. Go ahead, 
ask me anything.</speak>

<speak who="TEACHER">
Very well. What device invented in the 
20th century allowed people to view 
broadcast programmes in their own homes?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Ooh ... I know this ... whatyya call 
it? Lite Brite!</speak>

<info>The teacher electrocutes him again. Guenter laughs and points 
his pencil in the air.</info>

<speak who="GUENTER">
I believe the answer is the television.</speak>

<speak who="TEACHER">
Very good Mr ...  ... Guenter.</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
<info>(impressed)</info> Wow! Smart and cute!</speak>

<info>She ruffles Guenter's fur. Guenter smiles cockily at Fry.</info>

<info>Mars University: Mentholyptus Hall. Dean Vernon sits in his 
office at his desk carefully adjusting parts of a model spaceship 
with old-fashioned sails. He is a middle-aged man and wears a 
brown suit and black thick-rimmed glasses.</info>

<speak who="VERNON">
What I love about being dean of students 
is the peace and quiet and the respect 
I receive.  Now what's all this about?</speak>

<info>He puts it on speaker-phone.</info>

<speak who="WOMAN">
Dean Vernon, the students from Robot 
House are here.</speak>

<info>Vernon takes off his glasses.</info>

<speak who="VERNON">
Robot House!</speak>

<info>Enter Bender and the other fratbots.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Hey, dean, nice looking model.</speak>

<info>Vernon quickly pulls it back from the edge of the desk.</info>

<speak who="VERNON">
You keep away from it. You robots are 
a disgrace to this university. Whenever 
a fire alarm is pulled, it's Robot House. 
Whenever the campus liquor store is 
looted, Robot House. Whenever a human 
corpse is desecrated--</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Now, I can explain that.</speak>

<speak who="VERNON">
That's enough out of you. From this 
day forth, Robot House is on dodecatupple-secret 
probation!</speak>

<info>The robots gasp.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
No fair!</speak>

<speak who="FATBOT">
My mom is gonna kill me!</speak>

<info>Vernon puts his glasses back on.</info>

<speak who="VERNON">
Now if you'll excuse me, I have to get 
back to the one thing that's kept me 
sane these past eight years: My model 
ship.</speak>

<info>He looks down. The ship isn't on his desk. His jaw drops when 
he sees Fatbot eating it.</info>

<speak who="GEARSHIFT">
Fatbot! No!</speak>

<speak who="FATBOT">
When I get nervous I get hungry.</speak>

<info>Vernon grits his teeth.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Cheese it!</speak>

<info>Cut to: Mars University: Outside Mentholyptus Hall. The robots 
burst through the doors, run down the steps and away.</info>

<speak who="VERNON">
<info>(shouting; from inside)</info> Robot House!</speak>

<info>Cafe. Fry sits with a brown-haired girl wearing an orange MU 
top and reading an English 101 book. Fry has a tray in front 
of him with a burger, two bananas and some crackers on it.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
So, Chrissy, we seem to be hitting it 
off. If you're not doing anything later 
might I escort you to a kegger?</speak>

<speak who="CHRISSY">
Not even if you were the last man on 
Mars.</speak>

<info>She slams the book shut, gets up and leaves. Fry watches.</info>

<info>Cut to: Outside Cafe. Fry watches Chrissy through the window 
as she writes something on a piece of paper and hands it to Guenter. 
She giggles, chews her pencil bashfully and leaves. Fry watches 
her, dumbstruck. Guenter raps on the window and gets Fry's attention.</info>

<speak who="GUENTER">
<info>(shouting)</info> Hey! You like bananas?</speak>

<info>Cut to: Cafe. Guenter slaps the piece of paper onto the window.</info>

<speak who="GUENTER">
<info>(shouting; from outside)</info> I got her number. 
How do you like them bananas?</speak>

<info>He walks off and Fry growls.</info>

<info>Mars University: Mathematics Of Quantum Neutrino Fields Lecture 
Hall. Farnsworth has drawn a diagram and some algerbra on the 
blackboard under the heading "Today's Lesson: WD or 'Witten's 
Dog'".</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
And therefore, by process of elimination, 
the electron must taste like grapeade.</speak>

<info>He turns around to his class ... who aren't there. The door 
opens and Fry walks in.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Sorry, I overslept.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Until 5pm?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
It's that obnoxious monkey. He kept 
me up all night with his constant thinking. 
Just thinking and thinking. He's trying 
to make me look like an idiot.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Don't be jealous. Without his special 
hat, Guenter might be no more intelligent 
than you.</speak>

<info>Fry sighs.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
I hate that rodent!</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Fry, that monkey is my most important 
experiment. If you two don't stop fighting 
I'll have you both neutered.</speak>

<info>Fry chuckles.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
That'll show him.</speak>

<info>Mars University Parent's Reception. A string quartet plays in 
the corner of the room near a portrait of Vernon holding his 
model ship. The room is well-decorated, with bookshelves lined 
with old books, chanderliers and large armchairs. Guests include 
the boys from Snooty House and the fratbots. Amy is wearing a 
long white dress and introduces her parents to Vernon.</info>

<speak who="AMY">
Dean Vernon, I'd like you to meet my 
parents, Leo and Inez.</speak>

<speak who="VERNON">
Ah, Mr. and Mrs. Wong, I'm so glad we 
could admit Amy in exchange for your 
generous contribution.</speak>

<speak who="MR WONG">
How much more for Phi Beta Kappa?</speak>

<speak who="VERNON">
How much you got?</speak>

<info>Fry scoops up some hors d'evours from the buffet and shovels 
them in his mouth. Guenter sidles up beside him.</info>

<speak who="GUENTER">
Sorry I'm late, I was off at a study 
session ... with Chrissy!</speak>

<info>Fry carries on chewing and narrows his eyes at Guenter.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Oh, I'm glad you made it, Guenter because 
in honour of parents weekend I have 
a special surprise for you.</speak>

<info>He pulls a purple sheet off a cage. There are two monkeys inside.</info>

<speak who="GUENTER">
<info>(horrified)</info> Mom? Dad? What are you doing 
here?  This is so humiliating.</speak>

<info>Fry throws some bananas into the cage.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Now these monkeys I like!  What's that? 
You wanna come out?</speak>

<info>He unlocks the cage.</info>

<speak who="GUENTER">
No! Stop!</speak>

<info>The cage door falls open and the monkeys run out. One jumps 
into the punch bowl and splashes around and another jumps onto 
a snooty boy and knocks him over. The other guests run away.</info>

<speak who="CHET">
I say.</speak>

<info>Fry, Leela and Farnsworth duck.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
What's that they're flinging at us?</speak>

<speak who="GUENTER">
Oh, dear Lord, all over the dean!</speak>

<info>He covers his face.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Hey, uh, Guenter? Why don't you get 
up on the chandelier with your parents 
and I'll take a picture?</speak>

<info>Guenter's parents swing around on the chandelier. He groans 
and runs out.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Well, looks like the party's winding 
down. Let's take a road trip to Tijuana 
and get Fatbot some action.</speak>

<info>Oily and Gearshift high-five.</info>

<speak who="FATBOT">
It's my first time, I'm really nervous.</speak>

<info>He eats the portrait of Vernon. Vernon wipes his face and sees.</info>

<speak who="VERNON">
<info>(shouting)</info> Robot House!</speak>

<info>Financial Aid Dorm Corridor. Fry and Leela stand outside Fry 
and Guenter's room.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
What you did to Guenter was cruel. At 
the risk of sounding like an after-school 
special, I think we learned who the 
real animal was today.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
You mean peer pressure?</speak>

<info>Cut to: Financial Aid Dorm: Fry and Guenter's Room. Fry opens 
the door. The room is dark and Guenter's shadow is cast onto 
the wall. He is holding something and points it at Fry and Leela. 
Fry gasps and hides behind Leela.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Look out! He's got a gun!</speak>

<info>Leela turns the light on. Guenter is sat in the corner of the 
room surrounded by banana skins. The thing he is holding is another 
banana.</info>

<speak who="GUENTER">
<info>(crying)</info> Leave me alone.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Hey, what's going on? I thought you 
didn't like bananas.</speak>

<speak who="GUENTER">
<info>(crying)</info> Of course I do. I try so hard 
to fit in but seeing my parents act 
like that made me realise I'm just a 
primative beast.</speak>

<info>He sobs.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Hey, hey, cheer up. Not everyone turns 
out like their parents. I mean, look 
at me. My folks were honest hardworking 
people.</speak>

<info>He snorts.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Besides, Guenter, you're not like other 
monkeys. You've got the hat.</speak>

<speak who="GUENTER">
<info>(crying)</info> So what? I mean, sure, it looks 
cool and it makes me smart but it doesn't 
make me happy.</speak>

<info>He sobs some more.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
That's so sad. I didn't even know monkeys 
could cry.</speak>

<speak who="GUENTER">
<info>(crying)</info> They can't. It's all the hat.</speak>

<info>And some more. Fry puts his hand on his shoulder.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Look, Guenter, if you're so miserable 
here, maybe you should just go back 
to the jungle.</speak>

<speak who="GUENTER">
The jungle. But I couldn't do that to 
the Professor. I'm his prize experiment, 
and he's like a father to me.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
But he's not your father. That guy in 
the punch bowl was your father.</speak>

<info>Fry spits out a mouthful of punch.</info>

<info>Mars University: 20th Century History Lecture Hall. "Test Today" 
flashes on the board and Guenter scribbles away, hard at work. 
Farnsworth stands at the front with the teacher.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Look at him, I'm so proud.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Thanks, Professor!</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Not you.</speak>

<info>He presses the electrocution button and Fry screams.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
<info>(screaming)</info> Ow!</speak>

<info>Guenter looks up from his paper and sighs. He has drawn bananas 
all over his paper. Fry leans over and takes a peek at Guenter's 
paper and scribbles a crude banana on his paper. He chuckles. 
Guenter stares out of the window at the jungle. He shakes his 
head and tries to concentrate. Farnsworth watches him and smiles. 
Guenter looks back and forth through the window and at Farnsworth, 
starts hyperventilating and finally cracks. He snaps his pencil 
and screams. He throws off his hat, makes monkey noises and jumps 
through a window.</info>

<speak who="STUDENT">
Hey!</speak>

<info>Guenter runs off the campus and into the jungle and Farnsworth 
hangs his head.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Oh, I always feared he might run off 
like this. Why? Why? Why didn't I break 
his legs?</speak>

<info>Financial Aid Dorm: Fry and Guenter's Room. Farnsworth stares 
at a photo of him and Guenter on a log flume ride. He strokes 
the picture.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
<info>(crying)</info> Oh, poor Guenter.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
So he just ran away in the middle of 
the exam?</speak>

<info>Farnsworth sniffs.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
I'm afraid so. All he handed in was 
a paper smeared with faeces. He tied 
with Fry.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
I guess he realised I was right when 
I told him to go back to the jungle.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
You what? After I spent months slaving 
over a hot monkey brain?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Hey, don't blame me. You tried to force 
Guenter to be a human but he's an animal. 
He belongs in the wild. Or in the circus 
on one of those tiny tricycles. Now 
that's entertainment.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
But Guenter's obviously better off being 
intelligent. Tell him, Leela.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Nuh-uh, I'm staying out of this. Now 
here's my opinion: What we should do 
is...</speak>

<info>She leans in and whispers something to them.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
What?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
I said we'll go to the jungle and let 
Guenter decide once and for all.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
What?</speak>

<info>Mars Surface. There is a Big Fraternity Raft Regatta and crowds 
have turned out to watch. The fratbots pull their delapidated 
raft into the river alongside other frats.</info>

<speak who="VERNON">
You all know the rules. Whichever house 
wins the regatta becomes head of the 
Greek Council. And should that house 
currently be on any type of multiple 
secret probation, it will be lifted 
and I will be forced to serve as Grand 
Marshal of a parade honouring them.</speak>

<info>The SS Von Snoot pulls up alongside Bender's raft.</info>

<speak who="CHET">
I say, Robot House, your water craft 
is as ill-designed as you yourselves.</speak>

<speak who="MEIDERNEYER">
Good one, Chet!</speak>

<info>They laugh, chink their glasses and gulp down their champagne.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Oh, yeah? Watch this!</speak>

<info>He rips the top of a keg off, downs the whole thing and belches 
a huge flame. He crushes the keg against his head and the Snootys 
stare.</info>

<speak who="CHET">
Well, I never!</speak>

<speak who="VERNON">
Fraternities, on your marks.</speak>

<info>He fires the starting gun at the fratbots' boat and it starts 
to deflate. The SS Von Snoot sails off.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Hey!</speak>

<info>Mars Jungle. Leela cuts through some thicket and Farnsworth 
and Fry follow.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Wow" The jungles on Mars look just like 
the jungles on Earth.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Jungles? On Earth?</speak>

<info>He laughs. Leela points up a tree.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
I see some movement up there. I think 
it's him.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Stand back.</speak>

<info>He pulls a pin from a grenade and throws it into the bushes. 
It explodes and a purple gas envelopes the tree. Three tucans, 
two parrots, a frog, a lizard, a snake and tiger fall out of 
it flat on their backs.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Oops.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Don't worry. They'll be fine once the 
tranquiliser wears off.</speak>

<info>They walk on and don't notice a huge elephant fall from the 
tree and flatten the other creatures.</info>

<info>Time Lapse. The trio peer through some leaves.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
There's our man!</speak>

<info>They watch Guenter sitting on a rock looking at his reflection 
in a river.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Professor, you'll offer Guenter the 
hat and, Fry, you'll offer him the banana. 
We'll let him choose whether he wants 
to be intelligent or just a mindless 
animal.</speak>

<info>Fry chombles on the banana. Leela gives him a stern look and 
hands him a new one. Guenter scratches himself and sees them.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Come on, Guenter, take the hat.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
No, the banana, the banana!</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Consider the philosophical and metaphysical 
ramifications of the--</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Banana, banana, banana!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Wait, what's that sound?</speak>

<info>They hear a motorboat get closer and closer. It's the fratbots. 
Bender waterskis behind the repaired raft.</info>

<speak who="GEARSHIFT">
<info>(shouting)</info> Hey, Bender, you sure this 
is a short-cut?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
<info>(shouting)</info> Not as sure as I was an hour 
ago!</speak>

<info>The raft zooms past Leela, Fry and Farnsworth and Bender's waterskis 
create a wave that washes over the them and drags them into the 
river. The current catches them and they scream. Downriver the 
fratbots come to a huge waterfall. They scream and go over the 
edge. They hit some rocks at the bottom and disappear underwater. 
The SS Von Snoot sails past towards the finish line.</info>

<speak who="VERNON">
And the winner is ...  ... Robot House?!</speak>

<info>The Snooty boys suddenly fall out of their boat. Leela, Fry 
and Farnsworth are still heading for the waterfall. They grab 
onto a log.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Oh, dear Lord!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
No! No!</speak>

<info>The log wedges itself behind a rock in the middle of the river 
and they stop floating towards the waterfall. They breathe a 
sigh of relief.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Thank God this log is sturdy.  <info>(shouting)</info> 
Put on the hat, Guenter! You're the 
only one who can save us!  <info>(muttering)</info> 
Stupid monkey.</speak>

<info>Guenter puts the hat on his knee.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
No.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Not there.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Keep trying.</speak>

<info>He puts it on his butt and Fry chuckles. Finally he puts it 
on his head.</info>

<speak who="GUENTER">
Eureka! The hat goes on the head. It's 
all so obvious now!</speak>

<info>The log starts to move.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
<info>(shouting)</info> Help us, Guenter!</speak>

<speak who="GUENTER">
Oh, my goodness. <info>(shouting)</info> Hang on. 
I need to do some calculations.  Got 
it!  Grab on!</speak>

<info>They do and Guenter tumbles over the edge, pulling them upwards. 
The vine ties itself around them and a branch.</info>,

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
We're saved!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
'Preciate it Guenter!</speak>

<info>Guenter holds onto the vine as he dangles halfway down the waterfall. 
The vine starts to break and he whimpers.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Oh, no! Hurry, Guenter, climb up the 
vine. You can still save yourself.</speak>

<speak who="GUENTER">
Why bother? I've got nothing to live 
for. I was miserable as a genius, and 
as a monkey, I was so dumb I tried to 
wear a hat on my butt.  <info>(sadly)</info> There's 
just no place for me in this world. 
<info>(normal)</info> Although, on the other hand--</speak>

<info>The vine snaps and he screams as he plummets towards the bottom. 
Farnsworth, Fry and Leela watch him. He hits the water below.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Oh, that poor, sweet monkey. Well lets 
go gather him up. There's no sense letting 
him go to waste.</speak>

<info>He licks his lips.</info>

<info>Time Lapse. They reach the foot of the waterfall and find Guenter 
still alive. His hat is bashed though.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Guenter! You're alive!</speak>

<speak who="GUENTER">
I guess the hat must have broke my fall.</speak>

<info>Farnsworth opens up the hat.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
It seems to be working at only half-capacity, 
but I can fix it.</speak>

<speak who="GUENTER">
No, wait! I like it like this. I actually 
feel sort of happy.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
But what about your super-intelligence?</speak>

<speak who="GUENTER">
When I had that there was too much pressure 
to use it. All I want out of life is 
to be a monkey of moderate intelligence 
who wears a suit. That's why I've decided 
to transfer to business school!</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
<info>(screaming)</info> Nooo!</speak>

<info>Mars University Campus. Dean Vernon keeps his word and reluctantly 
heads the parade honouring the robots of ERR. Fatbot stands at 
the front of the float and waves to everyone. Farnsworth and 
Amy are on the float as well. Guenter leaps on and Farnsworth 
pats him on the head.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
<info>(shouting)</info> Come on, everyone! Big party 
in Robot House!</speak>

<info>The students cheer and start dancing to Lloyd Williams' Shout. 
As they dance Animal House-esque subtitles appear under the main 
characters. "Fry Dropped Out Successfully And Returned To His 
Dead-End Delivery Job" appears under Fry; "Guenter Got His MBA
And Became President Of The Fox Network" appears under Guenter; 
"Fatbot Caught A Computer Virus In Tijuana And Had To Be Rebooted" 
under Fatbot, "Leela Went On One Date With Dean Vernon, But He 
Never Called Again" under Leela and Vernon and finally "His Job 
Done, Bender Stole Everything Of Value From Robot House And Ran 
Off" under Bender.</info>
