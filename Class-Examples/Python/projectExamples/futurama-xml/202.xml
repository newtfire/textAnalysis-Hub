                         Very impressive. Back in the 20th century 
                         we had no idea there was a university 
                         on Mars.

                         Well, in those days Mars was just a 
                         dreary, uninhabitable wasteland, uh, 
                         much like Utah. But unlike Utah, it 
                         was eventually made livable, when the 
                         university was founded in 2636.

                         Please! Everyone knows 20th century 
                         colleges were basically expensive daycare 
                         centres.

                         That's true. By current academic standards, 
                         you're merely a high school dropout.

                         What?! That's not fair. I deserve the 
                         same respect any other college dropout 
                         gets. By God, I'm gonna enroll here 
                         at Mars University and drop out all
