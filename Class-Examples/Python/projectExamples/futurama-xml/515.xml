<info>Opening Credits. A remix is performed by the cast in their character 
voices. Caption: Controlling You Through A Chip In Your Butt 
Since 1999.</info>

<info>Planet Express: Lounge. All My Circuits is on the TV.</info>

<info>Calculon sits at his desk in his office with his face buried 
in his hands. His son Antonio sits on the other side. Weepy soap 
opera music plays.</info>

<speak who="CALCULON"><info>ON TV</info>
Why Antonio?</speak>

<info>Very dramatic music plays. The previously montage fades to a 
bedroom where Monique has yet another passionate affair with 
Boxy. Enter Calculon. Monique pulls the sheets over her.</info>

<speak who="MONIQUE"><info>ON TV</info>
Calculon?! But I thought you were -</speak>

<speak who="CALCULON"><info>ON TV</info>
Egyptian?!</speak>

<info>More dramatic music. The scene changes to Monique and Antonio 
on a yacht. Monique is pointing a laser at Antonio.</info>

<speak who="MONIQUE"><info>ON TV</info>
Before I kill you, I must ask you one 
question. Who am I? For I have...amnesia!</speak>

<info>Even more dramatic music. The scene changes to a room. Monique, 
Antonio and Human Friend sit on a couch and two other robots 
stand behind. Calculon stands in front looking at them all.</info>

<speak who="CALCULON"><info>ON TV</info>
Let me get this straight. Does anyone 
here not have amnesia?</speak>

<info>The rest murmur in confusion.</info>

<speak who="MONIQUE"><info>ON TV</info>
Not sure.</speak>

<speak who="HUMAN FRIEND"><info>ON TV</info>
I 'unno.</speak>

<info>And the same dramatic music. In the Planet Express lounge Cubert 
and Dwight are sat watching All My Circuits with Fry, Leela and 
Bender.</info>

<speak who="CUBERT">
This show is awesome! When I grow up 
I'm gonna have so much amnesia!</speak>

<speak who="DWIGHT">
Me too. I mean, I have it now, but I 
forgot.</speak>

<speak who="CUBERT">
Well mine's louder!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Cram a ham in it you twerps!  Sorry!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Nah, I had it coming.</speak>

<info>On the TV Calculon's birthday party is in full swing.</info>

<speak who="CALCULON"><info>ON TV</info>
Welcome swingers. Pull up a groove and 
get fabulous!</speak>

<speak who="MONIQUE"><info>ON TV</info>
Nude rocks bands, big piles of what 
I assume is talcum powder, it's quite 
a birthday party Calculon.</speak>

<speak who="CUBERT">
Cool! I'm gonna have a fabulatious birthday 
party just like Calculon!</speak>

<speak who="DWIGHT">
Oh yeah? Well I'm gonna show up looking 
good. Just like Monique.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Do you two have to imitate everything 
you see on TV?</speak>

<speak who="CUBERT">
Um, we're 12, so, yes.</speak>

<speak who="DWIGHT">
Hold up Cubert, you're a clone of the 
Professor. Do clones even have birthdays?</speak>

<speak who="CUBERT">
Well duh!</speak>

<speak who="DWIGHT">"Duh" what?</speak>

<info>Cubert looks puzzled.</info>

<info>Planet Express: Farnsworth's Lab. Farnsworth and Hermes, wearing 
goggles and gloves, poke something in a crate with rakes. Enter 
Cubert and Dwight. Hermes puts the lid on the crate.</info>

<speak who="CUBERT">
Dad? Do I have a birthday?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Hmm, you didn't have a birth so technically, 
no.  Oh, don't feel bad. We can celebrate 
the day I extracted you from the cloning 
tank. Or the day I scraped that DNA 
from that growth on my back.</speak>

<speak who="CUBERT">
Ooo, that one!</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Ah yes. It was 13 years ago next week. 
I used this very fork.</speak>

<info>Hermes takes it.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
Aww well isn't that - ew!</speak>

<info>He drops it when he realises what he is saying.</info>

<speak who="DWIGHT">
Hey, next week'll be my birthday too.</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
That's true. If only there were a way 
to have one party for both of you here 
at the office then write it off as a 
business expense. Wait! I thought of 
a way! The way I just said!</speak>

<speak who="CUBERT">
Yeah!</speak>

<speak who="DWIGHT">
Way to go pops!</speak>

<info>They hug their dads.</info>

<info>Cut to: Planet Express: Lounge. Cubert and Dwight run back in 
and leap on the couch. On the TV Calculon and Monique are bathing 
in some pink stuff.</info>

<speak who="CALCULON"><info>ON TV</info>
Oh Monique, why did we wait so many 
years to bathe in champagne?</speak>

<info>He scoops some up in a glass and drinks it. Antonio comes crashing 
in through the ceiling wearing a parachute. He hits the ground 
with a thump.</info>

<speak who="ANTONIO"><info>ON TV</info>
Father, I've discovered the shocking 
secret mother has kept from you for 
200 years.</speak>

<speak who="MONIQUE"><info>ON TV</info>
No! No!</speak>

<speak who="ANTONIO"><info>ON TV</info>
Brace yourself. For when I speak these 
words you may well suffer an attack 
of explosive amnesia. For you see, the 
horrible secret is -</speak>

<info>He stops talking and starts to fizzle. His pupils go crazy and 
he starts groaning. Monique and Calculon glance at each other 
in confusion.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Whoever's directing this is a master 
of suspense!</speak>

<info>Cut to: All My Circuits Soundstage. Antonio fizzles on the set 
while Calculon and Monique are still in the tub. Sal and two 
other guys walk onto the set. Sal hits Antonio twice with a hammer 
then leans on him and talks to the other two.</info>

<speak who="SAL">
He's busteds. Lets get hims outta heres.</speak>

<info>They pick him up and carry him away. He continues groaning.</info>

<info>Cut to: Planet Express: Lounge. The TV changes to static then 
a still image of a robot with one of his eyes popped out and 
the message "Oops! Broken Actor."</info>

<info>The TV cuts into the episode. The Hypno-Toad does nothing except 
sit, hypnotising his audience.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
This show's been going downhill since 
season three.</speak>

<info>Planet Express: Meeting Room. A "Happy Growth-Scraping Day" 
banner has been strung up along the back wall. LaBarbara and 
Amy fly up to the ceiling on rocket packs and hang streamers. 
Enter Zoidberg in tramp garb.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Look who's here everyone! It's Zoidberg, 
the lovable tramp!</speak>

<info>Hermes, Leela, Farnsworth, Cubert and Dwight applaud.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Since when are you performing at children's 
parties?</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Performing? What? Please, if someone 
could spare me money to buy shoes -</speak>

<info>The five look away and Zoidberg sighs.</info>

<speak who="DWIGHT">
This party pukes.</speak>

<speak who="CUBERT">
Yeah! The guests were supposed to be 
here three hours ago.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Well that doesn't mean that no one is 
coming and that you two are total losers. 
Who gave you that idea?</speak>

<info>The doorbell rings.</info>

<speak who="DWIGHT">
All right! They must've all come as 
a group.</speak>

<info>Cut to: Planet Express: Hangar. Cubert and Dwight stand by side 
door.</info>

<speak who="CUBERT">
Welcome swingers! Pull up a groove and 
get fabulous!</speak>

<info>He chuckles and opens the door. No one is there. He hears a 
squeaking and looks down. Tinny Tim hobbles towards the door 
with a green envelope.</info>

<speak who="TINNY TIM">
Good day fellows. Someone dumped this 
invitation in my begging cup. Happy 
growth-scraping day to all!</speak>

<info>Cubert and Dwight sigh.</info>

<info>Planet Express: Meeting Room. The rest of the crew are gathered 
around with glasses and food. Hermes, LaBarbara and Farnsworth 
talk.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
Fire 'em all.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Mm-hm, mm-hm.</speak>

<info>Cubert, Dwight and Tinny Tim sit around the table, bored. Enter 
Bender with the TV.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
<info>(gasping)</info> Guys, guys something's happening 
on television again.</speak>

<info>He puts the TV on the table and plugs the plug into his ass 
socket. The TV flickers on just in time for Entertainment And 
Earth Invasion Tonite. Morbo and Linda sit in the studio. The 
studio backdrop features flying saucers hovering over the Hollywood 
sign.</info>

<speak who="MORBO"><info>ON TV</info>
Welcome to Entertainment And Earth Invasion 
Tonite. Across the galaxy my people 
are completing the mighty space fleet 
that will exterminate the human race! 
But first, this news from Tinseltown.</speak>

<info>Footage of Antonio's breakdown appears behind Linda.</info>

<speak who="LINDA"><info>ON TV</info>
Following Antonio Calculon Jr's breakdown 
on set, the popular TV show All My Circuits 
will hold an open casting call for child 
robots to replace him.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
An open casting call for child robots? 
Tinny Tim? Are you thinkin' what I'm 
thinkin'?</speak>

<speak who="TINNY TIM">
What's that sir?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
That I, Bender, am perfect for the role!</speak>

<speak who="TINNY TIM">
You raised my hopes and dashed them 
quite expertly sir!  Bravo!</speak>

<info>Outside All My Circuits Casting Office. Bender, Leela and Fry 
sit in a room filled with childbots.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Bender, your swarthy Latin charm will 
only get you so far. There's a lot of 
famous child acting units here.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Look, there's Macaulay Culckon.</speak>

<info>He points at a spotty little robot whos hands are permanently 
attached to his face and has a permanent shocked expression like 
Macaulay Culkin's face in the posters for Home Alone and Home 
Alone 2: Lost In New York.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
He's just not cute since he got puberty 
installed.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Psst. There's that robot child actor 
who grew up an robbed a convenience 
store!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
And there's that robot child actor who 
grew up and became a convenience store!</speak>

<info>The robberbot puts some cash into the 7^11 vending machine.</info>

<speak who="ROBBERBOT">
Lottery ticket please.</speak>

<info>The 7^11 machine prints out the ticket. A woman walks out of 
the casting office.</info>

<speak who="CASTING DIRECTOR">
We're ready for the first audition. 
<info>(reading)</info> Emoteitron Jr?</speak>

<info>The robot gets up and his mother stops him.</info>

<speak who="MOMBOT">
Hold on precious, let's make you look 
nice for the lady.  What's this?  What 
did I tell you?  No more hanging wires!</speak>

<info>All My Circuits Casting Office. Emotitron Jr stands in front 
of the table where the casting director and Calculon are sat.</info>

<speak who="CASTING DIRECTOR">
In this scene, you've just found out 
your real father is Calculon's fourth 
evil identical septuplet, Sleazy Martinez. 
OK...take us there!</speak>

<info>The robot looks at his script.</info>

<speak who="EMOTITRON JR">
Now that I know the truth father, I 
must ride south and join the robo-banditos 
at Veracruz.</speak>

<speak who="CALCULON">
Well, I thought he was good but the 
audience seems to have turned on him.</speak>

<speak who="CASTING DIRECTOR">
But I don't think -</speak>

<speak who="CALCULON">
Next!</speak>

<info>Time Lapse. Night has fallen and Macaulay Culkon is auditioning.</info>

<speak who="MACAULAY CULKON">
...at Veracruz, so, if you'll kindly 
hand me my poncho -</speak>

<speak who="CALCULON">
Sorry kid you're flailing out there. 
90 actors and they all got boo-ed. 
I just wish we could get this Bender 
I keep hearing about. They say he's 
the greatest.</speak>

<speak who="CASTING DIRECTOR">
Well there is a robot named Bender here 
but he's much too old -</speak>

<speak who="CALCULON">
Send him in forthwith!</speak>

<info>Cut to: Outside All My Circuits Casting Office. Bender is right 
outside the door.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
<info>(shouting)</info> Boo! Not as good as Bender! 
Boo!</speak>

<info>The door opens and the casting director is standing there.</info>

<speak who="CASTING DIRECTOR">
Mr Bender?</speak>

<info>Bender screams.</info>

<info>All My Circuits Casting Office.</info>

<speak who="CASTING DIRECTOR">
Have you ever been on TV before?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Once, when I took those hostages.</speak>

<speak who="CALCULON">
I saw that! You were good. Let's hear 
you audition.</speak>

<info>The casting director hands Bender a script. Bender thumbs through 
it.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Banditos eh? Aw this is great! 'Cause 
I happen to have a flawless Spanish 
accent!  <info>(bad Spanish accent)</info> I will 
say adios Padre! Come Jesus ye faithful. 
Tonight we eat...guacamole by the El 
Rio!</speak>

<speak who="CALCULON">
That was so terrible I think you gave 
me cancer! I don't care how popular 
you are, you will never work on my show!</speak>

<speak who="CALCULON">
However, you've got the job. Welcome 
aboard son!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Fathero!</speak>

<info>He hugs Calculon.</info>

<info>All My Circuits Soundstage. Outside a red light is on and a 
sign indicates Taping In Progress, All Welcome (Writers Keep 
Out). On a hospital room set Calculon and Bender prepare for 
a scene.</info>

<speak who="CALCULON">
Bender I'd like you to meet our director......who's 
name I never learned.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Yo! I read the script and I think it 
would help my character's motivation 
if he was on fire.</speak>

<speak who="DIRECTOR">
Uh, don't worry 'bout the script baby, 
we re-wrote your part to better suit 
your acting abilities.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
So now my character has a British accent?</speak>

<speak who="DIRECTOR">
No, now your character's in a coma. 
Get in bed and don't move.  And...action!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
<info>(muttering)</info> Stupid dumb coma...coulda 
been British.</speak>

<info>Calculon moves to his bedside.</info>

<speak who="CALCULON">
Alas that mine only son should sink 
into an irreversible, permanent...coma.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
<info>(quietly)</info> Permanent? That's completely 
out of character for Antonio. I'm gettin' 
up.</speak>

<speak who="CALCULON">
Curse the tragic wildebeast accident 
that -</speak>

<info>Bender sits up on the bed.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Hey everyone! Antonio here but you can 
call me "Bender"! I got ants in my butt 
and I needs to strut.  C'mon baby!  
C'mon!</speak>

<info>The director stands watching, gobsmacked while a woman behind 
him leafs through the script. Calculon stares at Bender.</info>

<speak who="CALCULON">
I'm not familiar with the type of thing 
I'm seeing.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Bite my shiny metal ass!  Ooo yeah! 
C'mon baby, do that, oo yeah!</speak>

<speak who="DIRECTOR">
<info>(shouting)</info> Cut!  That's the worst coma 
acting I've ever seen. I'll have to 
shoot it again.</speak>

<speak who="CALCULON">
No! No, no, no I don't do two takes.</speak>

<speak who="DIRECTOR">
But this guy was -</speak>

<speak who="CALCULON">
Amateurs like you do two takes, I do 
one take. Print it, I'll be in my three 
storey trailer.</speak>

<info>He takes a bouquet of flowers from a woman.</info>

<info>All My Circuits Editting Room. Calculon and the director watch 
Bender's antics.</info>

<speak who="BENDER"><info>ON TV</info>
Bite my shiny metal ass!  Ooo yeah! 
C'mon baby, c'mon yeah!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Now that's hospital dancing.  Pretty 
good eh Calcky?</speak>

<speak who="CALCULON">
Good? I've seen better acting from extras 
in Godzilla movies.  I don't even remember 
shooting this scene.</speak>

<speak who="DIRECTOR">
We didn't. That's security camera footage 
from your dressing room.</speak>

<speak who="CALCULON">
He stole the scene and my money? That's 
it! I demand you fire this felonious 
ham!</speak>

<info>An alarm beeps and a red light starts to flash.</info>

<speak who="DIRECTOR">
The network Execubots are coming!</speak>

<speak who="CALCULON">
Dear God!</speak>

<info>Enter three huge clunky robots on tracks.</info>

<speak who="BETABOT">
Presenting the president of the network.</speak>

<info>A man walks in, places a iBook on a desk and leaves. A modem 
in the iBook beeps and the network president, the iBook itself, 
starts to speak.</info>

<speak who="NETWORK PRESIDENT">
Greetings gentlemen, you already know 
my Execubots. Executive Alpha, programmed 
to like things that are seen before.</speak>

<speak who="ALPHABOT">
Hey hey hey.</speak>

<speak who="NETWORK PRESIDENT">
Executive Beta, programmed to roll dice 
to determine the fall schedule.</speak>

<info>Betabot rolls two dice.</info>

<speak who="BETABOT">
More reality shows.</speak>

<speak who="NETWORK PRESIDENT">
And Executive Gamma, programmed to underestimate 
middle America.</speak>

<speak who="GAMMABOT">
It's funny but is it going to get them 
off their tractors?</speak>

<info>The president plays a clip of Bender dancing on his screen.</info>

<speak who="NETWORK PRESIDENT">
Now, who put this obnoxious dancing 
robot on my network?</speak>

<speak who="DIRECTOR">
We were about to fire him sir.</speak>

<info>The president's screen has changed to a picture of a family 
in front of a TV screen.</info>

<speak who="NETWORK PRESIDENT">
Silence hack! We've been monitoring 
our Nielsen families carefully and during 
the 12 seconds Bender was on screen, 
viewer eyeball focus was up 90%.</speak>

<speak who="CALCULON">
Sir, children watch this show. Bender's 
no role model, he's a filth monger!</speak>

<speak who="NETWORK PRESIDENT">
At our network, we love filth! Filthy 
rich that is! Being filthy rich that 
is!  "Bite my shiny metal ass" could 
be a catchphrase.</speak>

<speak who="ALPHABOT">
80% likely.</speak>

<speak who="GAMMABOT">
It will play in Peoria.</speak>

<info>Betabot rolls his dice.</info>

<speak who="BETABOT">
Gameshows are back.</speak>

<speak who="NETWORK PRESIDENT">
We need this edgy, sweeps-ready robot 
on our network. Bender? Can you continue 
to drink, smoke and steal things on 
TV?</speak>

<info>Bender takes Calculon's wallet.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Yes I can.</speak>

<info>Musical To Black Flag's TV Party Bender's status as a cult icon 
rockets. On the side of the All My Circuits soundstage, men paste 
a huge picture of Bender over the cast picture. An episode of 
the show is broadcast where Human Friend is getting married, 
only for his bride to turn out to be Bender in the middle of 
the ceremony. He lifts his veil, lights a cigar and pulls out 
a copy of Playbot. Cubert, Dwight and Tinny Tim watch in the 
Planet Express lounge and cheer. At the 7^11 fine Bender tobacco 
products include Bender Smokes, Benderillos and Bender's Favorite. 
A kid points at the Bender's Favorite. Cubert, Dwight and Tinny 
Tim carry on watching All My Circuits. Bender is creditted as 
Starring Bender as "Bender." He walks into a restaurant where 
Calculon and Monique are dining and tips there table over along 
with the two of them. He drinks back a bottle of beer and randomly 
fires a laser into the air. Cubert, Dwight and Tinny Tim cheer 
and tip the table in the lounge over. The cover story on TV Week 
Monthly is Bender: TV's Rowdiest Robot Opens Up About Drinking, 
Smoking &amp; His Feud with Jay. Inside his chest cabinet is beer, 
cigars and Jay Leno's gagged head in a jar. In another episode 
Bender spits his cigar at Human Friend. It bounces off him and 
back into Bender's mouth.</info>

<info>Planet Express: Lounge. Cubert, Dwight and Tinny Tim laugh at 
Bender's antics. Dwight pulls out a pack of cigars perhaps.</info>

<speak who="DWIGHT">
Yo, check out what I jacked from my 
Dad.</speak>

<speak who="CUBERT">
A cigar!</speak>

<speak who="TINNY TIM">
Ripping!</speak>

<info>Dwight lights the cigar, takes a puff and impersonates his hero.</info>

<speak who="DWIGHT">
Look! I'm Bender!</speak>

<info>He suddenly vomits and faints. Enter Farnsworth and Hermes.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
Ras H. Tafari. What's goin' on here?</speak>

<info>Farnsworth picks up the cigar in his feet and hands it to Hermes.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
The ruffians smoked one of your cigars.</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
That's not a cigar. Uh...and it's not 
mine!</speak>

<info>He puts it in his inside pocket.</info>

<speak who="CUBERT">
Hey Dad, bite my shiny metal ass!</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
What? Such an act would be most uncomfortable 
for both of us! Where did you learn 
such language?</speak>

<speak who="TINNY TIM">
From Bender my good jerkwad.</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
Bender eh? That guy's really startin' 
to twist my dreads.</speak>

<info>Time Lapse. Farnsworth and Hermes are gone, replaced by Fry, 
Leela, Zoidberg and Bender on the couch. Cubert, Dwight and Tinny 
Tim sit on the floor all watching TV.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
OK OK OK, get ready for this part.</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Quiet robot, Bender's on TV.</speak>

<info>On the TV Calculon and Monique enter a cabin covered in snow.</info>

<speak who="MONIQUE"><info>ON TV</info>
Oh Calculon, it's so good to get away 
from the city and that beastly, yet 
intriguing, Bender.</speak>

<info>She gasps. Bender is guzzling down a kegg of beer on the other 
side of the room. He cheers and lights his finger like a lighter.</info>

<speak who="BENDER"><info>ON TV</info>
Try this kids at home!</speak>

<info>A "Don't Try This Kids At Home" caption appears underneath. 
Bender lights his alcoholic breath and his head catches fire, 
followed by the rest of his body. The screen pulls back. The 
All My Circuits episode was just another clip on Entertainment 
And Earth Invasion Tonite.</info>

<speak who="LINDA"><info>ON TV</info>
Is television sensation Bender a bad 
role model for Earth children?</speak>

<info>Bender spins a pair of scissors around on both of his hands. 
Zoidberg leans away from him.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
That's crazy.</speak>

<speak who="LINDA"><info>ON TV</info>
A new protest group, Fathers Against 
Rude Television, says "Hell yes!"</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Pft. What kind of bozos would start 
a Bender protest group?</speak>

<info>Enter Farnsworth and Hermes.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Good news everyone. Hermes and I have 
started a Bender protest group.</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
That was uncanny.</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
Fathers Against Rude Television don't 
want our kids watching Bender's high 
definition filth.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
And for what? Some kind of cheap laugh? 
That's not what F-A-R-T is all about.</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
No sir, not us FARTers.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Whoa, whoa, whoa. You can't censor me 
just 'cause I'm an obscenely bad role 
model.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
As unclean as it makes me feel, I agree 
with Bender. Kids don't turn rotten 
just from watching TV.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Yeah. Give a little credit to our public 
schools.</speak>

<info>Planet Express: Attic Balcony. Dwight, Cubert and Tinny Tim 
sit slumped against the attic dome under the moonlight. Cubert 
sighs.</info>

<speak who="CUBERT">
Our dads are all pumped up on dorkosterum. 
We're just trying to be cool like Bender.</speak>

<speak who="DWIGHT">
Yeah, and it's not even working. Smoking 
and drinking make us barf.</speak>

<speak who="TINNY TIM">
Gentle jerkwads. I know how to emulate 
Bender without barfing. We could commit 
a burglary.</speak>

<speak who="DWIGHT">
Hey, yeah!</speak>

<speak who="CUBERT">
Bender loves to burgle!</speak>

<speak who="DWIGHT">
Hold up though. Who could we rob? We 
don't even know anyone with cool stuff.</speak>

<speak who="CUBERT">
Duh! We know someone who runs on pure 
cool fuel. Bender!</speak>

<speak who="DWIGHT">
Whoa!</speak>

<speak who="TINNY TIM">
We'll rob Bender!</speak>

<info>Cubert laughs.</info>

<speak who="DWIGHT">
TV gave us the idea.</speak>

<info>Robot Arms Apartments Corridor. Cubert, Dwight and Tinny Tim 
sneak towards Fry and Bender's apartment with a sack.</info>

<speak who="CUBERT">
OK. It's crime time.</speak>

<info>He, Dwight and Tinny Tim put on some crude Bender face masks. 
Cubert opens the apartment door and they sneak in.</info>

<info>Cut to: Fry and Bender's Lounge. Fry plays a console game with 
one hand while reading a Space Boy comic. He takes a swig of 
beer. Tinny Tim, wearing his Bender mask, walks past Fry carrying 
Bender's chair. Fry doesn't look up.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Hey Bender.  Hey Bender.  Hey Bender. 
Hey Bender.</speak>

<info>Planet Express: Hangar. Cubert and Dwight's new party gets started. 
They open the door and Tinny Tim, some Cookieville orphans and 
Brett Blob walk in. Dwight and Cubert choose classical music 
for the party and play Bust A Move by Young MC.</info>

<info>Cut to: Planet Express: Meeting Room. The room is filled with 
more kids. Brett plays Bender's banjo then hits one of his gold 
bricks with it, breaking the banjo. He and some others laugh. 
Albert smokes one of Bender's Zuban cigars and throws up. Tinny 
Tim takes a copy of Playbot out of a box marked "Bender's Adult 
Periodicals." He sees a spread inside and his eye litterally 
pop out. Enter Hermes and Farnsworth. The music stops.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
What's going on in here?  Oh. Now I'm 
really outraged.</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
Where did you requisition this party? 
And Zoidberg, what are you doing here?</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
I'm networking. Let me give you my card.</speak>

<info>He pulls out a scrap of card with "ZoiDBERg" written on it and 
offers it to Sally and Nina. Neither of them bother taking it.</info>

<speak who="CUBERT">
Relax Dad, we just invited a few friends 
over.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Hmm. There's something wrong with your 
story but I can't put my finger on it. 
Of course! You don't have friends!</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
Yeah. Why do these popular kids consider 
you cool all of a sudden?</speak>

<speak who="DWIGHT">
Uh...we're just cool is all!</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Balderdash! I'll be the judge of who's 
cool, using the cool-o-meter!</speak>

<info>He takes a box with a needle on it out of his pocket. He scans 
over the orphans and the box beeps and the needle moves halfway 
around the gauge; he scans Zoidberg, who waves, and the beeping 
stops and the needle flops back down again; he scans more orphans 
and the needle goes back halfway. Finally he scans Tinny Tim, 
Dwight and Cubert and the machine beeps rapidly and the needle 
goes right around to maximum. A huge thumbs up pops out the side 
of the machine.</info>

<speak who="COOL">-O-METER
Oh yeah!</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Good Lord, I'm getting a reading of 
over 40 mega-Fonzies!</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
Everybody out!</speak>

<info>The kids groans and file out along with Zoidberg.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
So do you guys know about anything else 
going on, because I'm totally still 
ready to party.</speak>

<info>Hermes taps a girl on the shoulder and makes her hand something 
over. She hands him a lava lamp and runs out.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
There's enough cool stuff here to furnish 
a happenin' pad. Where did it all come 
from?</speak>

<speak who="TINNY TIM">
Don't tell comrades. All for one and 
one for all!</speak>

<info>Dwight and Cubert look at each other and cave.</info>

<speak who="DWIGHT">
We stole it!</speak>

<speak who="TINNY TIM">
Oh crumb!</speak>

<info>Bender's loot safe opens and Bender himself steps out of it 
and yawns and stretches.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
What? What's going on?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
I'll tell you what. Our boys have taken 
up stealing! One of the worst and coolest 
of crimes.</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
And all from watching you on TV you 
cool jerk.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Hey lay off me. TV would stink if everyone 
on it was a positive role model. Bender 
is about entertainment baby! You can't 
hold me responsible for what kids do 
when - hey! This is my stuff they stole! 
That's the last straw! Bender should 
not be allowed on television!</speak>

<info>Outside Planet Express. At the back of the building hundreds 
of angry dads are crowded around to hear Bender make a speech. 
The back of the hangar has been opened so the ship is right behind 
him. Bender stands at a podium with Farnsworth and Hermes right 
beside him.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Bender must be stopped. I've gone too 
far. Who does that guy think I am?  
C'mon! We're gonna march all the way 
to Hollywood and make them stop forcing 
their filthy me down our throats.</speak>

<info>He turns around and heads towards the ship.</info>

<info>Cut to: Planet Express: Hangar. Bender marches up the ship's 
steps followed by Hermes, Farnsworth and the other members of 
FART.</info>

<info>The ship takes off from the hangar, flies up into space and 
back down the other side of North America to Hollywood.</info>

<info>Cut to: Outside Television Studios. The FART mob march out of 
the ship chanting.</info>

<speak who="FART MOB">
<info>(chanting)</info> Down with Bender! Down with 
Bender! Down with Bender! Down with 
Bender!</speak>

<info>The stop marching when they reach a security barrier. Bender 
takes care of it.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
This mob's with me.</speak>

<speak who="SECURITY GUARD">
Go ahead.</speak>

<info>He raises the barrier and the mob carries on marching.</info>

<speak who="FART MOB">
<info>(chanting)</info> Down with Bender! Down with 
Bender! Down with Bender! Down with 
-  - Bender! Down with Bender!</speak>

<info>Cut to: All My Circuits Soundstage. On a hospital set Calculon 
is dressed as a doctor. Boxy is wearing a tuxedo and is in bed 
and a formally-dressed Fembot that looks like Boxy is in another 
bed.</info>

<speak who="CALCULON">
As a doctor and captain of this hospital 
shift, I now pronounce you man and wife 
with six months to live.</speak>

<info>His eyes widen in shock. Enter the FART mob.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Listen up Hollywood. We're an exciting 
new mob.</speak>

<info>The mob agree.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Yeah!</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
You'd better believe it!</speak>

<info>Calculon looks shocked.</info>

<speak who="CALCULON">
Great Shatner's ghost!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
We demand that all TVs be equipped with 
a v-chip that blocks Bender from appearing 
on the screen.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Booya!</speak>

<info>Enter the network president and his Execubots.</info>

<speak who="NETWORK PRESIDENT">
I'm afraid the answer is a gritty in-your-face 
no.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Then I quit.</speak>

<speak who="NETWORK PRESIDENT">
Then you don't quit.  I think you'll 
be finishing the scene now Mr Bender 
and don't skimp on the nasty.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
There'll be no further nasty.  We still 
have the option of resorting to violence.</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
What makes you think that'll work?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
I saw it on TV in that episode where 
Bender shot Calculon! How cool is that?</speak>

<info>Bender dances around smoking a cigar.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Ooo yeah baby c'mon -</speak>

<info>He panics as Farnsworth points his laser at him.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Quit the show!</speak>

<speak who="NETWORK PRESIDENT">
Do the scene.</speak>

<info>Bender puts his hands up.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
I'm a cold blooded punk!</speak>

<speak who="NETWORK PRESIDENT">
I once put a laugh track on a sitcom 
that had no jokes in it.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Hey look, the prop guy has a lamp!</speak>

<info>The Execubot turns around with the president in his hands.</info>

<speak who="NETWORK PRESIDENT">
Really?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Wha?</speak>

<info>Bender yoinks the guns from their hands.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Aha!</speak>

<info>Farnsworth gasps.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
I was using that!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Listen up, 'cause I've got a climactic 
speech! You, cameraman, keep the camera 
rolling. You, director, gimmie my motivation.</speak>

<speak who="DIRECTOR">
You're angry.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Perfect.  Viewers of the world, do smoking 
and drinking on TV really make me cool? 
Of course they do.  How 'bout committing 
crimes and violence? Again, the answer 
is "yes." But do we really want our 
kids exposed to that kind of trash on 
TV? I say absolutely not!  Uh...on the 
other hand, most - perhaps all the blame 
rests with the parents. That's right 
you!  And so I ask you this one question: 
Have you ever tried simply turning off 
the TV, sitting down with your children, 
and hitting them?</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
<info>(ashamed)</info> We're just so busy.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Well make time.</speak>

<speak who="DIRECTOR">
And...cut!</speak>

<info>Calculon applauds.</info>

<speak who="CALCULON">
Good enough. Splice in some reaction 
shots of me and shove it on the air.</speak>

<info>Planet Express: Lounge.</info>

<speak who="BENDER"><info>ON TV</info>
...Have you ever tried simply turning 
off the TV, sitting down with your children, 
and hitting them?</speak>

<info>Archive All My Circuits footage of Calculon reacting to something 
completely different is spliced in. The whole crew, Cubert, Dwight 
and Tinny Tim watch the TV.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
Well, I'd say we all learned a valuable 
lesson about TV there.</speak>

<speak who="CUBERT">
What was it?</speak>

<info>As Hermes defends himself on the TV there is more archive footage 
of Calculon reacting to something in a poker game.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Uh...that we should all take TV a little 
less seriously. And more importantly, 
turn it off once in a while.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Hear hear!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Yeah!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Damn right!</speak>

<info>On the TV Calculon reacts to something on a snowy mountain.</info>

<speak who="DWIGHT">
So, should we turn it off now?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Well, uh, that depends what's on.</speak>

<info>Fry flicks through the channels with the remote.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Nothing good.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Ah let's just keep watching.</speak>

<info>They all turn back to the screen and watch Everybody Loves Hypno-Toad.</info>

<info>Closing Credits. The crew perform Black Flag's TV Party while 
watching Everybody Loves Hypno-Toad.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">

a couple of brews!</speak>
