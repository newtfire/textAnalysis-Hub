<info>Outside Planet Express. The top of the tower explodes in a huge 
fireball and electricity zaps around the rest of the building.</info>

<info>Cut to: Planet Express: Meeting Room. Bender is sat at the table 
snoring as the room shakes and bits of ceiling fall on him.</info>

<info>Cut to: Planet Express: Lounge. Fry and Leela sit on the couch. 
Plaster is still falling from the ceiling and the building is 
still shaking.</info>

<speak who="FRY"><info>(SHOUTING)</info>
I know you've rejected me a lot before 
but frankly I wasn't sure we were right 
for each other either, but now I am! 
So how 'bout a date tonight?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
<info>(shouting)</info>: Sorry I think I, um, I think 
I left my toaster on.</speak>

<speak who="FRY"><info>(SHOUTING)</info>
C'mon Leela, what's the real reason 
you won't go out with me?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA"><info>(SHOUTING)</info>
Look, I'm embarrassed to admit this 
but you forced me to. I can't go out 
tonight because ......I have sweaty 
boot rash!</speak>

<info>On the other side of the room Amy looks up from the table.</info>

<speak who="AMY">
No spluh! Why do you think I'm sitting 
over here in the stink-free zone?</speak>

<info>Fry laughs.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
So, will you go out with me?</speak>

<info>Planet Express: Meeting Room. The crew are sat around the table. 
Farnsworth is covered in dirty stains and tries to rub them off 
with a cloth.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Good news everyone, I'm still technically 
alive! Yes!  But I need to you to dispose 
of this crazy ass experiment that almost 
killed me.  You'll have to throw it 
into the sun itself, for only the thermonuclear 
inferno of the sun has enough energy 
to ensure its total destruction!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
I can hit it with a shovel!</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
That's not good enough.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
This one time I pounded a guy into the 
ground like a stake with a shovel!</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Yes yes!</speak>

<info>Zoidberg lifts the lid slightly.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
So what's in the box already?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
No peeking!  I don't know what's in 
there but I'm sure our minds would be 
unable to comprehend -</speak>

<info>Hermes lifts the lid and Farnsworth hits his hand with the hammer.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
Ow! You hurt my collater!</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
I don't care.  Listen well: No matter 
what happens, no matter how great your 
curiosity, you are forbidden to look 
in this box. Forbidden!  Pretty tantilising 
though!</speak>

<info>Planet Express: Farnsworth's Lab. The box is on a stool and 
Bender, Zoidberg, Fry, Leela and Hermes stand around it.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Whatever's in there it's the only thing 
I've ever wanted.</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
In my experience boxes are usually empty. 
Or maybe with a little cheese stuck 
to the top. And one time pepperoni! 
What a day that was!  <info>(shouting)</info> Give 
me the box!</speak>

<info>Hermes fires a laser into the air.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
Scram you lousy green snakes!  Here 
Leela, take this and use it to shoot 
those guys.</speak>

<info>He hands her the laser.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Right! If they try to look in the box.</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
Whatever.</speak>

<info>Planet Express: Meeting Room. Fry sits at the table while Bender 
paces around restlessly.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Let's just forget about the box. The 
Professor said to stay away.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Fry, how can you be so naive? He was 
joking. Get it?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
No.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
That's what makes it so funny!  OK he 
wasn't joking now shut up and follow 
me.</speak>

<info>Planet Express: Basement. Bender removes the hatch from a superheated 
steam pipe and climbs in. Fry follows.</info>

<speak who="FRY"><info>FROM VENT</info>
Ow it's hot! The butter in my pocket 
is melting!</speak>

<info>Cut to: Planet Express: Farnsworth's Lab. Above the room Bender 
removes the grate.</info>

<info>Cut to: Vent. Bender takes out his eyes and replaces them with 
bendy periscope type eyes.</info>

<info>Cut to: Planet Express: Farnsworth's Lab. Bender's eye emerge 
from the vent and he scans the room. Leela is asleep in the corner. 
Bender chuckles. He extends his arms down the box, picks it up 
and brings it back into the vent. Fry groans from the heat.</info>

<info>Planet Express: Basement. Bender puts the box on a crate in 
the middle of the room</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
We thank you Bender for the gift we 
are about to receive!</speak>

<info>He lifts the lid and he and Fry gasp. Fry pulls something out.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Tangled up Christmas lights! We can 
take shifts untangling them!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Unlabled booze! Widemouth too!</speak>

<info>He downs the bottle and Fry starts on the lights.</info>

<info>Cut to: Planet Express: Farnsworth's Lab.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
That oughta keep those dopes occupied. 
I can guard the real box in peace now 
that no one's curious about it.</speak>

<info>She walks across the room and places the box back on the stool 
and picks up a magazine called Nosy Enquirer. She hums as she 
reads it. She looks up at the box but goes back to the magazine 
and hums louder.</info>

<info>Time Lapse. The next morning Leela is still in the lab guarding 
the box. A clock rings 7am.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Well, I got through the night and no 
one looked in the box. Not even me. 
The person who gave up her whole evening 
to watch it. A whole evening of TV gone. 
What a mockery of justice it is that 
I can't take even a little tiny peek! 
I need coffee.  OK. Heads I look, tails 
I don't.  Oh yeah! Heads! I mean - alright 
then!  No. I have a duty not to look. 
But then again, I promised the coin 
I would.  Oh it's deep. Deeper than 
a small box should be.</speak>

<info>She is sucked inside the box and screams.</info>

<info>Cut to: Universe 1: Farnsworth's Lab. Everything goes all wobbly 
and the box changes colour from yellow to light blue. Leela is 
ejected from it. She lands face first onto the floor. She is 
unaware that she has fallen into a parallel universe inside the 
box.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Ouch! My lawyer will hear about this!</speak>

<info>Enter Fry. But his hair is black and his jacket is green.</info>

<speak who="FRY 1">
Leela, what have you done?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Nothing. What do you mean "why was I 
looking in the box?"</speak>

<speak who="FRY 1">
I mean your hair. It's all different-y.</speak>

<info>Enter Bender. But he is gold.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Bender? Is that you?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER 1">
You know it! Large and in charge!</speak>

<info>Enter Farnsworth with a scar around his head.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH 1">
Leela? Oh, there's a woman for you! 
Always dying her hair instead of not 
looking in a box.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
I didn't dye my hair. This is how I 
always look.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER 1">
No, that's how you always look.  This 
throws my entire perception of reality 
into question. Clone? Robot? Or long 
lost twin? Taking all bets! I also offer 
video poker!</speak>

<info>Time Lapse.</info>

<speak who="FRY 1">
It's some guy wearing a Leela costume! 
Get him!</speak>

<info>Leela whips out Hermes' laser and points it at them.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Hold it! You have this all wrong. I 
just fell into the box and then I fell 
out somehow.</speak>

<speak who="FRY 1">
You shut up sir.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH 1">
No wait, I've got it! I know what's 
in the box. Oh I've been as dumb as 
Fry!</speak>

<speak who="FRY 1">
Am not!</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH 1">
It contains a parallel universe! And 
when you create a parallel universe 
it's almost always populated by evil 
twins!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
No look, I am not evil. My loan officer 
said so.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH 1">
Oh you'd like us to believe that wouldn't 
you Leela? Or should I say Eveela?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER 1">
Oh this is awful. Somewhere there's 
a Bender more evil than me. I do my 
best dammit!</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH 1">
Leela?  The good Leela.  I want you 
to snoop around the other universe and 
find out how evil they are.  Here.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
I tell you they're not evil. But don't 
be confused. They are jerks.</speak>

<info>Leela 1 dives into the box.</info>

<info>She punches him.</info>

<info>Enter Leela 1 via the box. She points the laser back into it.</info>

<speak who="LEELA 1">
Come out of your universe with your 
hands up!</speak>

<info>Enter Fry, Bender, Amy, Zoidberg and Farnsworth. They put up 
their hands.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Oh wow. It's like that drug trip I saw 
in that movie when I was on that drug 
trip.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Astonishing. I must have created a parallel 
universe!</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH 1">
Baldercrap! I created your universe! 
All you created was my fist parallel 
to your face!</speak>

<info>He weakly punches him.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Ow.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Look. It doesn't matter who created 
what. The important thing is - yah!</speak>

<info>She kicks the laser out of Leela 1's hand. Leela 1 leans back 
to Farnsworth 1.</info>

<speak who="LEELA 1"><info>(WHISPERING)</info>
We're exactly the same. I know all her 
moves. Therefore, I've got the upper 
hand.</speak>

<info>Both Leelas fly at each other, collide and land in a heap on 
the floor.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH 1">
Now now, perfectly symmetrical violence 
never solved anything.</speak>

<info>Universe 1: Meeting Room. Both crews sit around the table.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Let's recap what's happened so far. 
As you can see I accidentally created 
a box containing your universe.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH 1">
While I, in a simultaineous blunder 
created a box containing your universe.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
This is getting confusing. Why don't 
we call our universe "Universe A" and 
this universe "Universe B"?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER 1">
Hey, why can't we be universe A?</speak>

<speak who="FRY 1">
Yeah!</speak>

<speak who="AMY 1">
Yeah!</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG 1">
We want the best letter!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
We called it first. Besides, this place 
kinda feels like a "B" y'know?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA 1">
Alright, you can be crummy universe 
A. And we'll be universe 1!</speak>

<speak who="FRY 1">
Or "The Mongooses," that's a cool team 
name. The Fighting Mongooses!</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Wait a minute. If our universes are 
identical then why did our Leela look 
into the box and your Leela didn't?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA 1">
Well to be honest I tossed a coin. It 
came up tails so I didn't look.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
That's weird. Mine came up heads so 
I did.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Interesting. Apparently the key difference 
between our universes is that coin flips 
have opposite outcomes.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
That explains fruity here!  I tossed 
a coin to pick my finish. Foghat grey!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER 1">
Hey! Bite my glorious golden ass!</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Your people and your slight differences 
disgust me. I'm going home. Where's 
that blue box with our universe in it?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH 1">
Oh you'd like to get back to your evil 
universe wouldn't you? And destroy your 
box with our universe inside it.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Nonsense! I would never do such a thing 
unless you would already have been going 
to do that!</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH 1">
Wha?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
You heard me!</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH 1">
In any case, I've hidden the box and 
it will remain hidden unitil I'm convinced 
you're not evil!  Everyone, keep an 
eye on your evil counterpart.</speak>

<info>Farnsworth turns to the A crew.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
And you all do the same!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA 1">
Um, can Fry and I watch our parallel 
selves together? We have plans tonight.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
You guys are dating?</speak>

<speak who="FRY 1">
Oh no no no. We're married.</speak>

<info>Leela 1 puts her arms around him. They kiss. Fry and Leela's 
jaws drop.</info>

<info>Universe 1 Street. Bender A and Bender 1 walk down the street 
while all the time watching each other.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
I've got my eye on you boy!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER 1">
Don't even think about it lunch-pail! 
You'd be dead before you hit the ground!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Good point. Whatyya say we just hit 
a strip joint?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER 1">
I was waitin' for one of us to say that! 
Bender A, you're a prince among robots! 
Can you forgive me for distrusting you?</speak>

<info>They hug.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Aw, I can't stay mad at what is essentially 
me. I love me!</speak>

<info>They take each others wallets and chuckle.</info>

<info>Universe 1: Lounge. The two Amy's paint their toenails.</info>

<speak who="AMY 1">
This is so great! I always wanted an 
imaginary friend!</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
I'm not imaginary, I'm parallel! We're 
exactly the same, right down to the 
-  Splech! Is that pink nail polish?</speak>

<info>Amy 1 points at Amy's yellow toenails.</info>

<speak who="AMY 1">
Is that not pink nail polish? The Professor's 
right, you are evil! And shallow!</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
I am not evil!</speak>

<info>Universe 1 Elzar's. The Frys and Leelas sit at a table.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
So Fry, Leela, how'd you two get together?</speak>

<speak who="FRY 1">
Funny story. I asked Leela out a million 
times and she just kept rejecting me.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA 1">
I'd make up things like "I have sweaty 
boot-rash" or "I have to meet the President"!</speak>

<info>She laughs. Fry glares at Leela.</info>

<speak who="FRY 1">
Oh man, you never heard such excuses! 
But, like a dope, I believed her. Looking 
back on it now it's kinda funny!</speak>

<speak who="FRY"><info>(SARCASTIC)</info>
It sure is, right Leela? Funny. Ha ha 
ha ha!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA 1">
Then one night when Fry asked me out 
the only excuse I could think of involved 
ghosts. I knew he wouldn't buy it so 
I did what I always do in those situations.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Oh Lord!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA 1">
I flipped a coin. It came up heads and 
we went out.</speak>

<info>Fry turns to Leela.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
You mean you flipped the coin too? And 
it was tails? So that's why you said 
you had to meet that ghost.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA 1">
You really missed out on something Leela. 
That date was magical.</speak>

<speak who="FRY 1">
One year later I gave Leela a diamond 
scrunchy, and we were married.</speak>

<info>Leela 1 turns around and shows Leela the scrunchy.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Woo!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
One year later I got beat up at a Neil 
Diamond concert by a guy named Scrunchy!</speak>

<info>Universe 1 Farnsworth's Lab. The two Farnsworth's fiddle around 
with the chandelier controls and the lights brighten and dim.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH 1">
Well that was pointless.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Say, I hope you won't think it "evil" 
of me to ask how you got that stylish 
head wound!</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH 1">
Oh this old thing? I was experimenting 
to see if I could remove my own brain!</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Of course! I had the same idea! I flipped 
a coin to decide if I should proceed 
but it came up tails - so I didn't. 
How'd it go?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH 1">
Well getting the brain out was the easy 
part. The hard part was getting the 
brain out!</speak>

<info>He laughs insanely. Farnsworth chuckles.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Oh you!</speak>

<info>Universe 1 Alley. The two Zoidbergs sit in a dumpster.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG 1">
So, tell me about yourself!</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Well don't look into it but I'm a respected 
internal medicine doctor! Ooo a can!</speak>

<info>He picks up the can and slurps the contents of it.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG 1">
As for me I design mansions, then live 
in them.  <info>(crying)</info> I'm lying! I'm an 
appalling failure!</speak>

<info>Zoidberg cries too.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG"><info>(CRYING)</info>
Me too! A big fat one.</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG 1">
And those co-workers. Always looking 
down on us Zoidbergs. What are they? 
From Nob Hill?</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
They're all like "Stop spraying me with 
ink Zoidberg!" "Put on pants Zoidberg!" 
"Don't touch our fancy box Zoidberg!"</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG 1">
Oh that box! Too good for us is it?</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Bah! Someday they'll watch! From down 
in the gutter they will, as King Zoidberg 
caresses their fancy box.</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG 1">
You know, maybe a certain blue lobster 
saw where Professor hid the box!</speak>

<info>Zoidberg laughs evily and Zoidberg 1 joins in.</info>

<info>Universe 1 Meeting Room.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH 1">
Good news everyones!</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
After carefully reading the scriptures, 
we've concluded that none of us are 
evil!</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH 1">
Yes, the Bible is the real good news! 
Anyhow, you're all free to go back to 
your own universe.</speak>

<info>Enter Hermes 1.</info>

<speak who="HERMES 1">
What's goin' on here? Why aren't you 
all out destroying the Professor's box?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA 1">
Hermes, aren't you confused about the 
fact thats there's two of everybody?</speak>

<speak who="HERMES 1">
No. Now like my granny used to say back 
in her tall paper shack on Montego Bay 
"If you want a box hurled into the sun, 
you got to do it yourself!"</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH 1">
Your granny can go to hell! I've hidden 
the box so that no one can destroy the 
home universe of my handsome friend 
here!</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Oh go on! Wait a second. If your Hermes 
was about to destroy the box containing 
our universe...</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH 1">
Then your Hermes...</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Oh my!</speak>

<info>Cut to: Planet Express: Hangar. The hangar doors open and Hermes 
walks up the steps into the ship.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
Like granny said "If you want a box 
hurled into the sun, you got to do it 
yourself!" God rest her zombie bones.</speak>

<info>Universe 1: Farnsworth's Lab.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
So we go through the box and stop Hermes?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Right. Good thing Professor B there 
hid it in the sealed clam tank. No one 
but a crazy lobster would look there!</speak>

<info>In the tank Farnsworth 1 opens a giant shell. There is nothing 
inside.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH 1">
It's gone!</speak>

<info>Cut to: Universe 1 Alley. Zoidberg 1 is sat on a bin holding 
the box and wearing a Slurm cup on his head. Zoidberg A bows 
to him.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
All hail Zoidberg! The king with the 
box!  Now it's my turn maybe?</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG 1">
The box says no.</speak>

<info>Ship's Cockpit.</info>

<info>Universe 1 Farnsworth's Lab.</info>

<speak who="HERMES 1"><info>(CRYING)</info>
If I know parallel Hermes, he's at the 
sun by now.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER 1">
Our universe is doomed!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER AND BENDER 1">
Dooooomed!</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH 1">
Now don't give up yet you cry babies. 
The box is gone but we still have one 
preposterously slim hope.</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
Is it a kind of hairspray?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
No. We must attempt to create another 
box containing our universe! Doy!</speak>

<info>Time Lapse. Farnsworth pulls the switch on the multi-purpose 
nose making machine and the lights dim. Several boxes come out 
of it on a conveyor belt. The two Farnsworths scream madly while 
everyone else remains calm.</info>

<info>Time Lapse. Several boxes are on the floor. Fry picks one up 
and pokes his head inside it.</info>

<speak who="FRY 1">
Well? Is that your universe in there?</speak>

<speak who="FRY"><info>FROM BOX</info>
Nope. Too cold.</speak>

<info>He pulls his head out. It is frozen in a block of ice. Farnsworth 
puts his head in one.</info>

<info>Leela runs by with her head in a box and tentacles emerging 
from it.</info>

<speak who="HERMES 1">
Oh man it's hopeless! We'll never find 
your universe in time! Plus, this box 
is stuck on my fat head.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH 1">
Yes it's the apocalypse alright. I always 
thought I'd have a hand in it!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER 1">
I'm not sad. Because I finally found 
someone as great as me! It's like I 
always say: "Make new friends and keep 
the old. One is silver..."</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">"...and the other's gold!"</speak>

<info>They hug and cry. Enter Zoidbergs with the right box.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG 1">
Why with the long faces?</speak>

<info>Leela 1 gasps.</info>

<speak who="LEELA 1">
The idiots have the box!</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
I think she means you.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH 1">
Grab them!</speak>

<info>They surround the two Zoidbergs and back them against the shelves 
containing the other universes. The shelves wobble and Universe 
#25 falls off and lands on Zoidberg, taking him and Universe 
A with it.</info>

<info>He picks up the box and drops it over his head. He runs around 
with his legs sticking out and woops. He runs into the shelves 
and all the other boxes fall off.</info>

<speak who="AMY">
Splug! Which one did they go into?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH 1">
We'll have to search a universe. Everyone, 
grab a length of wire first so you can 
find your way back.</speak>

<info>They each grab a wire anchored to his lab table and jump into 
a parabox.</info>

<info>Universe 25. The Zoidbergs come in via a box and leave via another 
box. Amy 1 follows and looks around.</info>

<speak who="AMY 1">
Hello? Did you see two smelly lobsters?</speak>

<speak who="HERMES 25">
We didn't see anything.......ever!</speak>

<info>Universe 1729. Enter Fry.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Yo, did two shellfish in scrubs go by?</speak>

<info>The people in this universe have giant wobbly heads.</info>

<speak who="FRY 1729">
Hell no.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA 1729">
Shut up!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER 1729">
Beat it jerk!</speak>

<info>Universe 31. Enter Leela. This universe is populated by blocky 
robot versions of the crew.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Uh, have you robot versions of yourselves 
seen any extra Zoidbergs around here?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Uh, access denied.</speak>

<info>Fry 31's head explodes.</info>

<info>Universe XVII. The Professor's lab resembles an ancient Greek 
study and Farnsworth XVII is hard at work writing something on 
a blackboard. Enter the Bender's behind him.</info>

<speak who="BENDER 1">
Hey man look what I snagged from the 
leprachaun universe!</speak>

<info>He opens his chest cabinet and pulls out a crock o' gold.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Yeah leprachaun universe is fine...if 
you haven't seen pirate universe!</speak>

<info>He pulls out a treasure chest. Bender 1 gasps.</info>

<speak who="BENDER 1">
Faith and begota!</speak>

<info>They leave. Farnsworth XVII turns around from the blackoard.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH XVII">
Quae?</speak>

<info>Universe 420. Enter the Zoidbergs.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Quick, into another box!</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG 1">

<speak who="FRY">
So? Heads or tails?</speak>

<info>Leela looks at the coin.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">

<info>Fry smiles. Farnsworth reaches into the parabox and Farnsworth 
1's hand comes out.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Ready?</speak>

<info>The paraboxes fold into each other. Farnsworth now holds the 
blue box.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">

<info>She snatches the box away and the room shakes again.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Yes, all that is and ever shall be is 
in that box! And the box itself is probably 
worth something too. We must cherish 
it, as we cherish every moment of our 
lives.</speak>

<info>Planet Express: Lounge. Zoidberg, Bender and Leela are sat on 
the couch. Bender changes the channel. Enter Fry with a beer. 
He sees there is no space left on the couch so he sits on the 
parabox. The universe goes all squishy.</info>
