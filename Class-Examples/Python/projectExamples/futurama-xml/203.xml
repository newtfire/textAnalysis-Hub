                          Call me cocky, but if there's an alien 
                         out there I can't kill, I haven't met 
                         him and killed him yet. But I can't 
                         go it alone.  That's why I'm ordering 
                         every available ship to report for duty. 
                         Anyone without a ship should secure 
                         a weapon and fire wildly into the air.

                         satisfied with the events we have seen. 
                         Overall I would rate it a C+, OK, not 
                         great.  As a result, we will not destroy 
                         your planet. But neither will we provide 
                         you with our recipe for immortality.

                         of the episode, everything's always 
                         right back to normal.
