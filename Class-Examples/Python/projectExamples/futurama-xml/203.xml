<info>A view of the WNYW television building in New York. The caption 
"Earth: 1999" appears on the bottom of the screen.</info>

<info>Cut to: WNYW Corridor. Fry hums as he walks through the corridor 
carrying a pizza box and a six pack of beer. He opens a door 
marked "WNYW Control Room". Next to the door an "On Air" sign 
is lit up.</info>

<info>Cut to: WNYW Control Room. He walks through the door. In the 
room is a technician surrounded by broadcasting equipment.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Pizza delivery! Wow, so this is a real 
TV station, huh?</speak>

<speak who="TECHNICIAN">
Well, it's a Fox affiliate.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
What are you showing right now?</speak>

<info>The technician presses a button and a show's title appears on 
some screens.</info>

<speak who="TECHNICIAN">
Single Female Lawyer. It's the season 
finale. Wanna watch?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Ah, I dunno. That's a chick show. I 
prefer programmes of the genre "world's 
blankiest blank".</speak>

<speak who="TECHNICIAN">
She is wearing the world's shortiest 
skirt.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
I'm in!</speak>

<info>He sits down and the technician tosses him a can of Lï¿½brau. 
On the screen is a judge and the single female lawyer, who bears 
an uncanny resemblance to Calista Flockhart. In fact the entire 
show is pretty much Ally McBeal.</info>

<speak who="JUDGE">
Counselor, I remind you that it's unethical 
to sleep with your client. If you really 
care about the outcome of the case, 
you should sleep with me.</speak>

<speak who="SINGLE FEMALE LAWYER">
Your Honour, it's bad enough to proposition 
a single female lawyer in court, but 
this is a unisex bathroom.</speak>

<speak who="JUDGE">
Overruled, counselor!</speak>

<info>He grabs her and they kiss. A cubicle door opens and a stenographer 
appears with a machine.</info>

<speak who="STENOGRAPHER">
Could you repeat that last part?</speak>

<info>Fry yawns and stretches and knocks over a can of beer. The equipment 
fizzles, crackles and the screens turn to static.</info>

<speak who="TECHNICIAN">
Oh, my God! You've knocked Fox of the 
air!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Pfft! Like anyone on Earth cares.</speak>

<info>In a pullback sequence lifted from Contact the WNYW transmitter 
transmits the signal through the clouds, away from Earth, and 
out of the solar system to a planet called Omicron Persei 8 which 
intercepts the signal 1000 years later.</info>

<info>Cut to: Omicronian Living Room. Two huge green aliens, Lrrr 
and Nd-Nd, watch Single Female Lawyer on their small oval TV.</info>

<speak who="STENOGRAPHER">
Could you repeat that last par--</speak>

<info>The picture cuts to static. Lrrr hits the TV with his fist.</info>

<speak who="LRRR">
This is an outrage! I demand to know 
what happened to the plucky lawyer and 
her compellingly short garment.</speak>

<info>The static on the TV changes to the Fox logo.</info>

<speak who="FOX ANNOUNCER">
Due to technical difficulties, we now 
bring you eight animated shows in a 
row.</speak>

<info>Lrrr growls and vaporises the TV with a laser.</info>

<info>Opening Credits. Caption: Proudly Made On Earth.</info>

<info>Planet Express: Lounge. Fry and Bender lie back on the couch. 
Fry is holding a can of Slurm and Bender a can of beer. Enter 
Hermes.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
What in the name of Bob Marley's ghost? 
Get to work, you lazy boat bag!</speak>

<info>He rolls up the paper and hits Bender with it.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Ow!</speak>

<info>Fry chuckles. Hermes hits him.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Ow! Hey, quit it, Hermes. It's Labor 
Day.</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
Labor Day? That phoney-baloney holiday 
crammed down our throats by fat-cat 
union gangsters?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
That's the one.</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
Hot damn, a day off!</speak>

<info>He takes off his jacket and shirt and sits between Fry and Bender. 
Bender hands him a beer. Enter the rest of the crew wearing and 
carrying various things. Zoidberg is dressed in an old fashioned 
green striped swimsuit and is wearing a lobster rubber ring around 
his waist; Amy is wearing a pink bikini and carrying a fold-up 
chair; Leela is wearing her green swimsuit with the hole around 
the navel and is carrying a picnic bag; Farnsworth is carrying 
a red parasol and wearing 3/4 length shorts, though he is still 
wearing his lab coat and slippers.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Who's up for one last summer beach trip?</speak>

<info>Bender and Hermes leap up.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Aw, yeah!</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
Ready Freddy!</speak>

<info>He unzips his trousers and they fall around his ankles revealing 
his swimming trunks underneath. Fry stays on the couch.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
<info>(unenthusiastic)</info> Eh, I think I'll just 
stay here.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Fry, you're wasting your life sitting 
in front of that TV. You need to get 
out and see the real world.</speak>

<info>She walks between him and the TV. Fry peers around her.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
But this is HDTV. It's got better resolution 
than the real world!</speak>

<info>Leela sighs.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Everyone's too polite to say anything 
but you're covered with bed sores.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Not covered!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Just get in the car.</speak>

<info>Car. Leela drives the crew across the desert in a dark blue 
convertible. With her in the front are Farnsworth and Fry. Fry 
has taken off his red jacket and swapped it for red shorts. Amy, 
Hermes and Zoidberg sit in the back and Bender lies across the 
three of them.</info>

<info>Monument Beach Car Park. Leela parks in the packed car park 
and the crew get out.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Ah, here we are: Monument Beach!</speak>

<info>Fry gazes at the beach. People climb the Sphinx of Giza and 
alongside it is St Peter's Tower, the White House, Randy's Donuts, 
the Heads of Easter Island, the Leaning Tower of Pisa and Mount 
Rushmore.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Wait, Mount Rushmore and the Leaning 
Tower of Pisa? I didn't know they were 
both in New York!</speak>

<info>Leela unpacks some things from the boot.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
They are now. In the 2600's New Yorkers 
elected a super-villain governor, and 
he stole most of the world's monuments.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Truly a great man. Look at him up there.</speak>

<info>He looks up at the super-villain and whistles. The governor's 
head has been carved into the mountain next to the other presidents' 
heads.</info>

<info>Monument Beach. Leela lies on a sunbed and picks up a tube of 
Tanning Butter from the arm. She squeezes some onto her legs 
and hums as she rubs it in. Zoidberg picks up a chunk of real 
butter and rubs it across his head and groans. Hermes walks across 
in front of Zoidberg, Amy and Leela with a metal detector. It 
beeps rapidly.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
Aha!  Found you!</speak>

<info>Bender's head pops up from the sand.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
OK, now you go hide.  Nice knowin' you.</speak>

<info>He runs to a sunbed, picks up a drink and closes his eyes.</info>

<info>Time Lapse. Farnsworth and Zoidberg versus Amy and Leela in 
a beach volleyball game. Amy passes to Leela and she bashes it 
over the net. It hits Farnsworth in the head and knocks him over. 
He groans. The ball lands on Zoidberg's claw and bursts. He frowns 
and throws it into a pile of at least 20 other burst balls. Farnsworth 
stands up.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Come on, Zoidberg, I passed it right 
to you.</speak>

<info>Zoidberg scoffs.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
I've had it with this game! I'm going 
for a scuttle!</speak>

<info>He crouches down and scuttles into the water.</info>

<info>Time Lapse. Leela is back on her sunbed and Bender is on his.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
OK, everyone, come and get it!</speak>

<info>He opens his door. He has turned his chest cabinet into a grill 
and there are four cooked burgers on a wire rack. He takes one 
out and puts it in a bun and hands it to Fry. Fry takes a bite.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Ah, just like my dad used to make ... 
until McDonald's fired him.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Bite my red-hot glowing ass.  Wait a 
minute. Red-hot glowing ass?  <info>(calmly)</info> 
I'll be right back!  Ow ow ow ow ow 
ow ow ow ow!  Aw, yeah!</speak>

<info>Amy, Leela and Fry eat their burgers while Farnsworth sleeps. 
Nibbler watches, licking his lips. Amy's burger slips out of 
the roll and onto her chest. Nibbler leaps up.</info>

<speak who="AMY">
No, Nibbler!  <info>(whispering)</info> Psst, Professor, 
I need another bikini.</speak>

<info>Farnsworth wakes up.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Eh ... wha?  Oh, oh, OK, I think there's 
one can left.  Oh, my.</speak>

<info>She sprays the straps on her back and turns around.</info>

<speak who="AMY">
There. How do I look?</speak>

<info>Farnsworth wiggles his glasses.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Like a cheap French harlot.</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
French?!</speak>

<info>Time Lapse. Fry finishes sculpting a sandcastle. A blonde guy 
stands over him and kicks the sandcastle in his face. Leela gasps 
and Fry spits the sand out. The guy turns to Leela.</info>

<speak who="BULLY">
Say, doll-face, how'd you like to make 
time with a real man?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
No. I'm not attracted to bullies. No 
matter how big and ...  ... handsome 
they are.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
It's OK, Leela, go ahead. I got a lot 
of work to do.</speak>

<speak who="BULLY">
Uh, sir, you don't understand. I'm a 
professional beach bully. I pretend 
to steal your girl, you punch me, I 
go down, she swoons, you slip me 50 
bucks.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
50 bucks?! Not even if she was my girlfriend. 
You take her.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Fry! Although I suppose we could go 
for a walk along the beach.</speak>

<speak who="BULLY">
Uh, no thanks, ma'am, I'm actually gay.</speak>

<info>He runs off and Leela sighs.</info>

<info>Seabed. Zoidberg scuttles around the water and happens upon 
a pile of eight fish skeletons. He starts slurping them.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Uh-oh.  Help! Help!  Bender, you gotta 
spring me. I'll never survive in here; 
I'm too pretty!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Alright, alright, I'll bust you out. 
Cheese it!</speak>

<info>Then run off.</info>

<info>Monument Beach. Fry finishes reconstructing his sandcastle.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Voila. The greatest sandcastle ever 
built. This is the kind of castle King 
Arthur would have lived in -- If he 
were a fiddler crab.</speak>

<info>Leela and Farnsworth gather round.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
It's very nice. We should get a picture 
before the tide comes in.</speak>

<info>Amy, Zoidberg and Bender arrive.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Ooh, yeah. Anyone have a camera?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Right here, buddy.  Wait, I wanna be 
in the picture too.  Pretend you're 
happy.</speak>

<info>They smile.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Yay!</speak>

<info>The smiles fade when a huge shadow creeps over them. The camera 
goes off as the crew look up and see a huge grey alien saucer 
flying low overhead. The centre of it starts to open up. Everyone 
watches as it stops above the White House. The middle opens up 
and it blows up the White House ï¿½ la Independence Day. Everyone 
screams.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Oh, my God!</speak>

<info>Hermes pokes his head up through the sand.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
What in Babylon?</speak>

<info>People flee as a fleet of saucers reduce the monuments to rubble 
and knock over the Leaning Tower of Pisa. A smaller saucer flies 
past the staff and destroys Fry's sandcastle. Fry falls to his 
knees and scoops up the sand.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
<info>(screaming)</info> Nooo!</speak>

<info>Car. The crew return to New New York with alien saucers chasing 
them.</info>

<info>Outside Planet Express. The car does a 180-degree skid outside 
the building and the crew run inside.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
Faster!</speak>

<info>A saucer blows up the car.</info>

<info>Cut to: Planet Express: Lounge. Fry peeps through the blinds 
and turns to the rest.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
We're all gonna die, aren't we?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Oh, I should think so. Although last 
time aliens invaded all they did was 
force the most intelligent of us to 
pair off and mate continuously. <info>(chuffed)</info> 
Oh, yes!</speak>

<info>He sprays his throat. Bender turns on the TV to the news. Linda 
presents with a smile.</info>

<speak who="LINDA">
Once again, today's winning lotto number 
was 4. In other news, alien saucers 
continue to rain destruction upon Earth. 
We now go live to an emergency address 
by Earth President McNeal.</speak>

<info>A picture in the corner fills the screen. McNeal, a middle-aged 
man with brown hair and a croaky voice, addresses people from 
different nations. A "President McNeal" caption is on the bottom 
of the screen.</info>

<speak who="MCNEAL">
Ladies and gentlemen, our course is 
clear. The time has come to knuckle 
under. To get down on all fours and 
really lick boot. Give our alien masters 
whatever they want a--</speak>

<info>The TV cuts to static briefly then changes to Lrrr. His is now 
wearing a big red cape and is surrounded by several other Omicronians. 
He speaks into an old-fashioned microphone.</info>

<speak who="LRRR">
People of Earth, I am Lrrr of the planet 
Omicron Persei 8.  Is this thing on? 
Now then: We want the one you call 
"McNeal". Give us McNeal or we will 
lay waste to your cities with our anti-monument 
laser. We demand McNeal!</speak>

<info>The picture cuts out then back to a totally flabbergasted McNeal.</info>

<speak who="MCNEAL">
Uh, as I was saying ...  ... mankind 
would sooner perish than kowtow to outrageous 
alien demands for this McNeal ... whoever 
he is. Am I right?  And now, the man 
who will lead us in our proud struggle 
for freedom, fresh from his bloody triumph 
over the pacifists of the Gandhi Nebula, 
25-star General Zapp Brannigan!</speak>

<info>He steps aside and Zapp takes the podium. The people cheer and 
applaud.</info>

<speak who="MAN">
Yeah!</speak>

<info>Fry applauds and Leela groans.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Hey, look, Leela, it's that idiotic 
windbag you slept with.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
The Earth is under attack. Can't we 
just forget about that?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Evidently not.</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Call me cocky, but if there's an alien 
out there I can't kill, I haven't met 
him and killed him yet. But I can't 
go it alone.  That's why I'm ordering 
every available ship to report for duty. 
Anyone without a ship should secure 
a weapon and fire wildly into the air.</speak>

<info>Leela stands up.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Well, you heard the windbag: We've been 
drafted. Everyone into the ship.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on. I refuse 
to fight. I'm a conscientious objector.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
A what?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
You know, a coward.</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Since this is an emergency all robots 
will now have their patriotism circuits 
activated.</speak>

<info>He holds up a remote control, points it at the camera and presses 
the button. Bender's antenna top flashes red and beeps and he 
stands up.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
It is every robot's duty to give his 
life for the good of humanity.  Oh, 
crap!</speak>

<info>A fleet of ships, including a yellow school bus and the Planet 
Express ship, fly away from Earth towards the hangar bay of the 
orbiting Nimbus.</info>

<info>Nimbus Hangar Bay. The ships are moored and Zapp gives the assembled 
recruits a briefing. He walks down the ranks with Kif at his 
side.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
We're all from different cultures here. 
Some of you are white, some of you are 
black.  You're brown.  And you're silver. 
But I don't care if your skin's red 
or tan or Chinese. You're all going 
to have to learn to die together.  Am 
I right, soldier?</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Well actually I--  Sir, yes sir! Sir!</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Remember, our mission is simple: Destroy 
all aliens!</speak>

<info>Kif raises his hand.</info>

<speak who="KIF">
Um, uh, not me, sir.</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Oh, yes, right. Nobody destroy Kif ... 
<info>(quietly)</info> unless you have to.  <info>(talking)</info> 
Oh ho ho! The luscious Captain Leela. 
This is turning into one very sex-ay 
struggle for the future of the human 
race!</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Thanks, but I'm not technically human.</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Right, right. Nobody destroy Leela either.</speak>

<info>Nimbus Crew Bunkroom. The recruits are assembled around the 
beds.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
The key to victory is discipline, and 
that means a well-made bed. You will 
practise until you can make your bed 
in your sleep.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
You mean while I'm sleeping in it?</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
You won't have time for sleeping, soldier. 
Not with all the bed-making you'll be 
doing.</speak>

<info>Nimbus Briefing Room. The recruits are dressed in DOOP uniforms 
and Zapp briefs them ï¿½ la the briefing in Star Wars. He points 
at a display of an Omicronian saucer.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
The alien mothership is in orbit here. 
If we can hit that bullseye the rest 
of the dominoes will fall like a house 
of cards. Checkmate.  Now, like all 
great plans, my strategy is so simple 
an idiot could have devised it. On my 
command all ships will line up and file 
directly into the alien death cannons, 
clogging them with wreckage.</speak>

<info>Fry raises his hand.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
W-Wouldn't it make more sense to send 
the robots in first a--</speak>

<info>Bender starts to choke him ï¿½ la Homer Simpson to Bart in The 
Simpsons. His antenna flashes again and he stops choking Fry 
and salutes.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
Sir, I volunteer for a suicide mission. 
Aw, cut it out!</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
You're a brave robot, son. But when 
I'm in command every mission's a suicide 
mission. Which reminds me.  Leela, perhaps 
before we head into battle you'd like 
to make love to me, in case one of us 
doesn't come back.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Maybe we should wait 'til afterwards, 
in case neither of us comes back.</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Here's hoping.</speak>

<info>He salutes by tapping his heart, saluting from his head and 
blowing a kiss.</info>

<info>The fleet flies around the moon towards the Omicronian mothership 
ï¿½ la the X-Wing approach in Star Wars.</info>

<info>Cut to: Ships Laser Turret. Fry is at the controls wearing a 
helmet that looks like Luke Skywalker's.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
I'm gonna be a science-fiction hero, 
just like Uhura, or Captain Janeway, 
or Xena!</speak>

<info>Leela is on a small screen.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Fry, this isn't TV, it's real life. 
Can't you tell the difference?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Sure, I just like TV better.</speak>

<info>He makes gunfire noises.</info>

<info>The fleet attacks. Lasers fly in the Star Wars-esque battle. 
The Omicronians fire back on the fleet and blows up two ships 
flanking the Planet Express ship. It peels away, narrowly avoiding 
another laser beam.</info>

<info>Cut to: Ships Cockpit. Leela wrestles with the controls as alarms 
beep and smoke pours from the ceiling. She brushes the hair out 
of her eye and looks across the room.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Bender, damage report.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
The auxiliary power's out, and they 
spilled my cocktail.</speak>

<info>He looks at the tipped over glass lying on the computer and 
the olive rolls off the edge.</info>

<info>Cut to: Ships Laser Turret. Fry narrows his eyes.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Alright, scumwads. This one's for Bender's 
cocktail!</speak>

<info>The Planet Express ship flies straight towards the saucer and 
Fry lets rip with 12 blasts from the laser. Leela turns the ship 
away and the Omicronian saucer creaks, groans and finally explodes 
in a spectacular fireball, complete with the obligatory flying 
tyre.</info>

<info>Cut to: Ships Laser Turret. Fry looks back at the explosion 
and cheers.</info>

<info>Cut to: Ships Cockpit. Leela stands up and waves her arms around.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
We did it! We won!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
<info>(sadly)</info> Yeah, but it'll never bring 
back my martini.  <info>(normal)</info> Well, who 
wants a martini?</speak>

<info>He takes a cocktail mixer out and shakes it.</info>

<info>Time Lapse. Fry, Leela and Bender chink their glasses and raise 
a toast. The communication screen comes down from the ceiling.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Good work, everyone. The mothership 
is destroyed.</speak>

<info>Through the window they see several white dots filling the starfield.</info>

<info>The dots form a circular shape outside and it flips over, revealing 
it to be another Omicronian saucer that is so huge it dwarfs 
the Nimbus.</info>

<info>Cut to: Nimbus Briefing Room.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
What the hell is that thing?</speak>

<speak who="KIF">
It appears to be the mothership.</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Then what did we just blow up?</speak>

<info>Kif checks the screen beside him.</info>

<speak who="KIF">
The Hubble Telescope.</speak>

<info>The battle continues. The real mothership destroys more ships 
and a Slurm lorry.</info>

<info>Cut to: Nimbus Briefing Room. Zapp and Kif watch the battle 
on screen.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
<info>(shouting)</info> Stop exploding, you cowards!</speak>

<info>Cut to: Ships Cockpit. Leela drops her martini glass.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
This is hopeless.  If we're gonna get 
blown to bits, we might as well do it 
in the comfort of our own home.</speak>

<info>She pulls a lever on the seat.</info>

<info>The ship jerks to a stop and reverses back towards Earth.</info>

<info>Planet Express: Lounge. Farnsworth is talking to a woman, a 
man and a robot who bear a striking resemblance to Leela, Fry 
and Bender. The woman is blonde and has two eyes; the man has 
brown hair that is combed down and he wears a green jacket; the 
robot is very crude and clunky.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
You'll be the captain, you'll be the 
delivery boy, and you'll be the alcoholic, 
foul-mouthed--  Oh, God, you're alive. 
I mean, thank God you're alive!  Sorry, 
check back in three days, a week at 
the most.</speak>

<info>They leave and Lrrr crackles onto the TV.</info>

<speak who="LRRR">
We want McNeal! Stop stalling!</speak>

<info>The scene changes to the news studio.</info>

<speak who="LINDA">
And now a rebuttal from President McNeal.</speak>

<info>McNeal addresses the same people as before. Zapp is back with 
them.</info>

<speak who="MCNEAL">
The people of Earth remain united in 
my refusal to hand over myself. Total 
annihalation is a small price to pay 
compared with--</speak>

<info>Zapp steps forward and puts a sack over McNeal. As he drags 
him away the people applaud and a man kicks the sack.</info>

<info>Outside Capitol Building. An Omicronian saucer is parked at 
the back of the building and there is a door at ground level. 
Zapp puts the sack down, knocks and runs a few feet back.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
<info>(shouting)</info> Here he is! Come and get 
him!</speak>

<info>The door opens and Lrrr and Nd-Nd are standing behind it. McNeal 
wriggles out of the sack and gasps.</info>

<speak who="LRRR">
You are not McNeal.</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
<info>(simultaneously)</info> Huh?</speak>

<speak who="MCNEAL">
<info>(simultaneously)</info> Huh?</speak>

<speak who="ND-ND">
You are not the one we want.</speak>

<speak who="MCNEAL">
Oh, thank you. Thank you, glorious 
masters! I--</speak>

<info>Lrrr whips out a laser and vaporises McNeal. He crumbles into 
a pile of smoking dust. Zapp squeals and takes a step back.</info>

<speak who="LRRR">
Give us McNeal!</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
That was McNeal.</speak>

<speak who="ND-ND">No, McNeal: The single female lawyer.</speak>

<speak who="LRRR">
She wears miniskirts and is promiscuous.</speak>

<info>Zapp rubs his chin.</info>

<speak who="ZAPP">
<info>(sexfully)</info> Really?</speak>

<info>Cut to: Planet Express: Lounge. The staff are watching on TV.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Miniskirts? That sounds familiar.</speak>

<info>Cut to: Outside Capitol Building.</info>

<speak who="LRRR">
Surely you know McNeal. She is an unmarried 
human female struggling to succeed in 
a human male's world.</speak>

<speak who="ZAPP">
Maybe that's just her excuse for being 
incompetent.</speak>

<speak who="LRRR">
<info>(shouting)</info> Silence! <info>(talking)</info> We will 
accept no more decoys.  This is the 
McNeal.</speak>

<info>Cut to: Planet Express: Lounge. Fry stares at the headshot.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Wait, I know her.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
You do not, you big fat liar. You don't 
know anyone. All you do is watch TV.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
That's where I know her from. She's 
Jenny McNeal. She was a character on 
a TV show back in the 20th century, 
Single Female Lawyer.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
Well if they're hoping to see a TV show 
that hasn't existed for a thousand years, 
pfft, they are royally boned.</speak>

<speak who="LRRR">
We will raise your planet's temperature 
by one million degrees a day, for five 
days, unless we see McNeal at 9pm tomorrow 
-- 8 central!</speak>

<info>The staff gasp.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
<info>(disappointed)</info> I'm beginning to think 
there'll be no forced mating at all.</speak>

<info>Lrrr and Nd-Nd's saucer hovers above New New York.</info>

<info>Cut to: Planet Express: Meeting Room. The entire staff are assembled 
around the table. Leela paces around.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
They're going to destroy the entire 
Earth if they don't see some stupid 
TV show about some bimbo lawyer?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
It's crazy! How could they even know 
about a show from a thousand years ago?</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Well, Omicron Persei 8 is about a thousand 
light years away. So the electro-magnetic 
waves would just recently have gotten 
there. You see--</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Magic. Got it.</speak>

<info>Amy types "single female lawyer" into a search engine and a 
page pops up.</info>

<speak who="AMY">
Check this out: Back in 1999 the season 
finale of Single Female Lawyer was interrupted 
by technical problems. Apparently some 
zidiot spilled Coke on the transmitter.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Beer -- I would think.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
They must just wanna see that episode. 
Let's find a tape and give it to 'em.</speak>

<info>Amy searches some more.</info>

<speak who="AMY">
There aren't any copies left.</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
No, there wouldn't be. Most videotapes 
from that era were damaged in 2443 during 
the Second Coming of Jesus.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Y'know, I saw the first 30 seconds of 
that episode. If I could make up an 
ending, maybe we could act it out ourselves.</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
I could make the costumes.</speak>

<info>He cuts some material with his claw.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
I have an old five-megawatt broadcasting 
tower in the attic.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
<info>(dramatically)</info> And I, I could be an 
acting coach!</speak>

<info>He whizzes his hand around.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Let's put on a show.</speak>

<info>Planet Express: Hangar. The ship has been moved to make way 
for a courtroom set. Hermes and Farnsworth makes some last minute 
perfections to the set, Bender arranges things on the defendant's 
table and Zoidberg wheels a clothes rail loaded with frilly things 
past Fry, Leela and Amy. Fry is sat on a chair with the script.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
OK, Leela, you'll be starring as Jenny--</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Uh-uh, forget it. A: I'm camera shy, 
and B: I get tongue tied in front of 
an audience armed with death rays.</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
Plus, you don't really have the thighs 
for a miniskirt.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Gimme the script.</speak>

<info>She snatches it from Fry.</info>

<info>Planet Express: Attic Roof. Farnsworth leans through a hatch 
and hooks up a satellite dish and points it at the nearby saucer.</info>

<info>Cut to: Outside Omicronian Saucer. Lrrr climbs a ladder up to 
the roof and jabs an aerial into it.</info>

<info>Planet Express: Hangar. On the courtroom set Fry calls for his 
cast.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Places, everyone.</speak>

<info>Amy puts the finishing touches to Leela's make-up. She is dressed 
in a green suit and high heels.</info>

<speak who="AMY">
OK ... all set!</speak>

<info>Leela turns around. Amy has attached a googly eye to the side 
of Leela's face. She flicks the pupil and it rolls around.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Lights!  Camera one!  Camera two!  Camera 
three!</speak>

<info>Something whirrs in Bender's head but nothing else moves.</info>

<info>Omicronian Saucer. Lrrr and Nd-Nd sit in recliners in front 
of a TV screen with six other Omicronians sat around them.</info>

<speak who="LRRR">
Prepare the water cooler, that we may 
gather around it later and discuss things.</speak>

<info>He pulls the recliner lever and flicks the TV on. Bender holds 
up a crude sign with "Single Female Lawyer" written on it and 
sings.</info>

Fighting for her client,

<info>He swaps the sign to one that says "Written and Directed by 
Fry."</info>

Wearing sexy miniskirts...

<info>Cut to: Planet Express: Hangar.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
<info>(singing)</info> ...And being self-reliant.

<info>(talking)</info> Hey I'm pretty good!

</speak><info>He takes the sign away and the episode begins. Farnsworth is 
the judge, Zoidberg is the prosecutor and Leela is the defendant. 
Farnsworth and Leela are holding their scripts.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
Uh, <info>(reading)</info> Jenny McNeal, you are 
charged with jury-tampering in last 
week's case ...  ... on account of your 
hot, naked affair with the foreman. 
How do you plead?</speak>

<info>Leela stands up and looks at her script.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Your Honour, I move for a mistrial, 
on the grounds that I'm also having 
a hot, naked affair with the foreman 
of this jury.</speak>

<info>Amy and Hermes sit in the jury box with 10 cardboard people. 
Hermes waves.</info>

<speak who="HERMES">
<info>(sexfully)</info> I'll see you during the recess!</speak>

<info>Cut to: Omicronian Saucer.</info>

<speak who="LRRR">
If McNeal wishes to be taken seriously 
why does she not simply tear the judge's 
head off?</speak>

<speak who="ND-ND">It is true what they say; "Women are 
from Omicron Persei 7, men are from 
Omicron Persei 9".</speak>

<info>Cut to: Planet Express: Hangar.</info>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
<info>(reading)</info> Your witness, Prosecutor Ramirez.</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Gracias.  Single Female Lawyer, where 
were you on the night of August 23rd?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Sleeping with you.</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
Aha!</speak>

<info>He jabs his claw in her fake eye and pulls it off her face. 
He sniffs it and eats it. Leela leafs through the script in a 
panic.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
Uh, g-- uh, getting back to the, uh, 
matter, uh-uh, if it please the court 
... <info>(whispering)</info> Fry, there's nothing 
else here. You only wrote two pages 
of dialogue.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Well, it took an hour to write. I thought 
it would take an hour to read.</speak>

<info>Leela sighs.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
What are we supposed to do now?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
I don't know, I don't know. Just say 
anything. As long as it's compelling, 
mesmerising, a tour de force.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Uh...</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
<info>(reading)</info> What say you, Single Female 
Lawyer?</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
I say ... I'm giving up the law.  And 
I'm giving up being single. Your Honour, 
will you marry me?</speak>

<info>Amy and Hermes gasp. Bender makes dramatic incidental music 
noises. Fry buries his face in his hands.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
No, no! Go to commercial!</speak>

<info>Bender puts the Single Female Lawyer card in front of the camera.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
We'll be back after this word from Crazy 
Bender's Discount Stereo.</speak>

<info>He retracts his eye.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
Married? Jenny can't get married.</speak>

<speak who="LEELA">
Why not? It's clever, it's unexpected.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
But that's not why people watch TV. 
Clever things make people feel stupid, 
and unexpected things make them feel 
scared.</speak>

<info>Lrrr crackles onto the screen.</info>

<speak who="LRRR"><info>ON TV</info>
Attention, McNeal. Your unexpected marriage 
plan scares us. You stole our hearts 
as a single female lawyer, and so shall 
you remain -- or else!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
You see? TV audiences don't want anything 
original. They wanna see the same thing 
they've seen a thousand times before.</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
<info>(ï¿½ la Arnold Jackson)</info> Whatchoo talkin' 
'bout, Fry?</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Trust me on this. While other people 
were out living their lives, I wasted 
mine watching TV, because deep down 
I knew it might one day help me save 
the world. Plus, I would have lost my 
Workman's Comp if I hadd gone outside. 
Now just read these cue cards.</speak>

<info>He scrawls something on some big cards with a black marker.</info>

<info>Time Lapse. The cast take their places. Fry holds up the cue 
cards.</info>

<speak who="FRY">
And action!</speak>

<speak who="FARNSWORTH">
<info>(reading)</info> Miss McNeal, I'm afraid I 
must decline your offer of marriage. 
For, you see, I'm dying. Cough, then 
fall over dead.</speak>

<info>He smiles and just stares ahead.</info>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
<info>(reading; unmoved)</info> My God, he's dead.</speak>

<info>Farnsworth checks his pulse.</info>

<speak who="LEELA">
<info>(reading)</info> I will now make my closing 
statement. With my fiancï¿½ deceased ... 
... I hereby return to my single female 
lawyer career. No matter what any man 
says.</speak>

<speak who="HERMES">
We find the defendant vulnerable yet 
spunky!</speak>

<speak who="ZOIDBERG">
<info>(cheering)</info> Hooray!</speak>

<speak who="AMY">
<info>(cheering)</info> Hooray!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
And ... cut!</speak>

<speak who="BENDER">
<info>(singing)</info> Single Female Lawyer,

Having lot's of sex--

<info>(talking)</info> Huh?

</speak><info>Lrrr cuts onto the TV. Nd-Nd drinks from the water cooler behind 
him.</info>

<speak who="LRRR"><info>ON TV</info>
Attention, McNeal. We are reasonably 
satisfied with the events we have seen. 
Overall I would rate it a C+, OK, not 
great.  As a result, we will not destroy 
your planet. But neither will we provide 
you with our recipe for immortality.</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Way to overact ,Zoidberg!</speak>

<speak who="LRRR"><info>ON TV</info>
And now we must return to our planet, 
to catch the end of a thousand-year-old 
Leno monologue.</speak>

<info>He sweeps his cape over him and runs offscreen.</info>

<info>Cut to: Street. The Omicronian saucers fly away and people come 
out from hiding. A white man hugs a black man, a Jew hugs an 
Arab and a clown hugs a nun.</info>

<info>Cut to: Planet Express: Lounge. The crew watch and cheer.</info>

<speak who="BENDER">
You did it, Fry!</speak>

<speak who="FRY">
Yep.  It was just a matter of knowing 
the secret of all TV shows; At the end 
of the episode, everything's always 
right back to normal.</speak>

<info>Pullback: New New York is a burning ruin. There is a crashed 
ship in the river and the flaming arm of the Statue Of Liberty 
crumbles away.</info>

<info>THE END</info></xml>
