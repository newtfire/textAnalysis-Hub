MUSIC: Screen Guild Players Theme

ANNOUNCER: Lady Esther presents The Screen Guild Players! ... The Screen Guild 
play tonight: "Casablanca!" The starring players ...

HUMPHREY BOGART: This is Humphrey Bogart.

INGRID BERGMAN: This is Ingrid Bergman.

PAUL HENREID: And this is Paul Henreid.

APPLAUSE

MUSIC OUT

ANNOUNCER: Tonight Lady Esther presents The Screen Guild Players in Warner 
Brothers' exciting story of romance and intrigue in wartime Africa, 
"Casablanca" -- with the original stars of the picture: Paul Henreid as Victor 
Laszlo, Ingrid Bergman as Ilsa Lund, and Humphrey Bogart as Rick Blaine.

MUSIC IN

ANNOUNCER: Barely escaping the conquering Germans' entrance into Paris, Rick 
Blaine fled to Casablanca. There, months before the American troops landed, he 
was operating Rick's American Cafe. Casablanca swarmed with refugees and 
Casablanca's more permanent foreign residents did a land office business in 
exit visas and letters of transit. Rick, however, avoided involvement in that 
dangerous business, until the night our story began. He was in his office 
above the cafe where he could watch and hear the crowd below when his 
headwaiter called to him...

CARL: Oh, Rick!

RICK: Yes, Carl?

CARL: The Prefect of Police, Captain Renault, would like to speak to you.

RICK: Well, send him in.

CARL: Yes, sir. Oh, Rick will see you, Captain Renault.

RENAULT: Thank you, Carl. Hello, Rick.

RICK: Hello, Louis. Why the formality?

RENAULT: Well, I have some unpleasant news for you, Ricky.

RICK: You mean you're looking for more graft?

RENAULT: Oh, no, no, no, no. At least, not right now. Uh, my men arrested 
Ugarte on his way to your roulette wheel, Ricky.

RICK: Well, except to Ugarte, what's so unpleasant about that?

RENAULT: Oh, in itself nothing. But we arrested Ugarte for murdering two 
German couriers and stealing their letters of transit. Ugarte did not have 
those letters of transit when he was arrested and he's seen no one but you, 
Ricky, since the murder.

RICK: What are you building up to, Louis? Arresting me?

RENAULT: No, not immediately, at any rate. I just want to give you a word of 
advice. Ugarte was going to sell those letters tonight to Victor Laszlo.

RICK: Laszlo? Here? In Casablanca?

RENAULT: Yes. Why, you know, Ricky, this is the first time I've ever seen you 
so impressed.

RICK: As head of the underground movement, Laszlo's impressed half the world.

RENAULT: Yes, it's my duty to see that he does not impress the other half. 
Rick, Laszlo must never reach America. He stays in Casablanca.

RICK: Twenty thousand francs says he doesn't.

RENAULT: Oh, make it ten thousand. After all, I'm only a poor corrupt 
official.

RICK (chuckles): All right, it's a bet.

RENAULT: Well, no one else would dare supply Laszlo with exit visas, Ricky, 
and since he can't leave Casablanca without them, make certain that you don't 
give him those letters of transit.

RICK: But I--

RENAULT: Oh, you needn't deny it, Rick. I'm certain you have the letters.

RICK: Even if I had those letters, Louis, you know I stick my neck out for 
nobody.

RENAULT: Yes, to date. But I suspect, Ricky, under that cynical shell, you're 
a sentimentalist. Now, if you'll come downstairs with me, I'll introduce you 
to Major Strasser and Victor Laszlo and his charming companion, the most 
beautiful woman who has ever come to Casablanca.

MUSICAL BRIDGE IN AND OUT

SAM (sings and plays piano):
You must remember this
A kiss is still a kiss
A sigh is just a sigh
The fundamental things apply
As time goes by

RICK: Sam! Sam!

MUSIC STOPS

SAM: Yes, boss?

RICK: I thought I told you never to play that song again.

SAM: Well, boss, you see, I didn't really--

ILSA: Sam is not to blame, Rick. I asked him to play it.

RICK: You--? Ilsa?

ILSA: Yes, Rick. Ilsa.

RICK: What are you doing in Casablanca?

ILSA: Just traveling through. With Victor Laszlo.

RICK: Where is he?

ILSA: He'll be right back. He's looking for someone.

RENAULT: Well, I found your wandering escort, Mademoiselle Lund. Ricky, I have 
the honor of introducing--

ILSA: We're old acquaintances, Captain Renault.

RENAULT: Oh, you know each other? Well, then, Ricky, do you also know--?

ILSA: This is Mister-- Mister Victor Laszlo.

LASZLO: One hears a great deal about Rick in Casablanca.

RICK: And about Victor Laszlo everywhere. I congratulate you.

LASZLO: What for?

RICK: Oh, your work.

LASZLO: Thank you. I try.

RICK: We all try. You succeed.

RENAULT: I can't get over you and Mademoiselle Lund knowing each other, Ricky. 
Under the circumstances, it worries me.

RICK: Well, it needn't.

ILSA: Let's see, the last time we met--

RICK: Was at the "La Belle Aurore"?

ILSA: How nice. You remembered. But, of course, that was the day the Germans 
marched into Paris.

RICK: I remember every detail. The Germans wore gray, you wore blue.

LASZLO: I don't wish to be the one to say it, Ilsa, but it's late. We'll come 
again, Monsieur Blaine.

RICK: Any time.

ILSA: Will you say good night to Sam for me, Rick?

RICK: I will.

ILSA: There's still nobody in the world who can play "As Time Goes By" like 
Sam.

RICK: I'll tell him.

MUSICAL BRIDGE

RICK (drunk): That's what she said, Sam. Nobody can play "As Time Goes By" 
like you. 

SAM: Aren't you gonna stop drinkin' and go to bed, boss?

RICK: No! Play "As Time Goes By," Sam.

SAM: Oh, I don't think I can remember it, boss.

RICK: If she can stand it, I can. Play it! I-I got a date with a memory ...

PIANO PLAYS

RICK: ... in Paris.

SAM (sings and plays piano):
You must remember this
A kiss is still a kiss
A sigh is just a sigh
The fundamental things apply
As time goes by

MUSICAL BRIDGE indicating a FLASHBACK

ILSA: Now, I really know the meaning of happiness, Richard. It's being here in 
Paris with you.

RICK: And the German army, fifty miles away. Who are you really, Ilsa? What 
were you before you came to Paris?

ILSA: Ha ha! At the beginning, we said no questions, Richard.

RICK: You know, I can't help wondering why I should be so lucky, why I should 
find you waiting for me to come along.

ILSA: Why there is no other man in my life? Well, that's easy. There was. He's 
dead.

RICK: I'm ... sorry. I know we said no questions. I'll never ask another.

MUSIC

ILSA: Richard, you must leave Paris before the Germans arrive. You're on their 
blacklist.

RICK: Ah, their roll of honor.

ILSA: Oh, don't joke, Richard. You must leave.

RICK: Oh, no, no, no. <u>We</u> must leave.

ILSA: Yes. Yes, of course.

RICK: Now, the train for Marseilles leaves at five. Say, why don't we get 
married in Marseilles?

ILSA (dissolving into tears): Oh, no. Oh, that's too far ahead to plan.

RICK: Ilsa? What's the matter?

ILSA: Nothing, darling. Nothing. Mm. It's just that I love you so much. Oh, 
it's a crazy world. Anything can happen. If you shouldn't get away-- If 
something should keep us apart, wherever you are, wherever I'll be, I want you 
to know, Richard ...

MUSIC UP AND DOWN

ILSA: Kiss me ... as if it were the last time.

SEGUE BACK TO SAM AT THE PIANO

SAM (sings and plays piano):
You must remember this
A kiss is still a kiss
A sigh is just a sigh
The fundamental things apply--
(abruptly stops playing)
Boss! Wake up! 

RICK (groans)

SAM: Boss, you gotta wake up. That lady's here. This ain't no memory in Paris 
-- she's right here.

RICK: Ah, you're as drunk as I am, Sam.

ILSA: No. No, he's not, Rick. I'm here. I left Victor at the hotel and came 
back. I'm-- I have to talk to you.

RICK: Funny about your voice, how it hasn't changed. I can still hear it: 
"Richard, dear, I'll go with you anyplace. We'll get on a train together, 
we'll never stop."

ILSA: No, please, please. I can understand how you feel.

RICK: You understand how I feel. How long was it we had?

ILSA: I didn't count the days.

RICK: Well, I did. Every one of them. Mostly, I remember the last one. You and 
I were going to run away from Paris together. 

ILSA: Oh ...

RICK: But you didn't me at the station, did you?

ILSA: Please, Rick...

RICK: There was a wow finish. Me standing on the platform, the last train 
about to pull out. But you didn't show up and Sam had to push me on the train.

ILSA: Ohh, the Rick I loved in Paris would let me explain ... but this Rick, 
looking at me with hatred-- I'll be leaving Casablanca soon. We'll never see 
each other again.

RICK: You'll see me before you go.

ILSA: No, Rick.

RICK: Oh, yes, you will. Some night you'll lie to Laszlo and come to me.

ILSA: No. No, you see Victor Laszlo's my husband. And was, even when I knew 
you in Paris.

MUSICAL BRIDGE

RICK: Well, Laszlo, I wondered when you'd come to see me.

LASZLO: Captain Renault and Major Strasser kept me busy for the past twenty-
four hours.
 
RICK: Well, there's no use fencing around. You've come about those letters of 
transit, haven't you?

LASZLO: Yes, I have.

RICK: You and Strasser and Renault. Seems to be the general impression in 
Casablanca that I have those letters.

LASZLO: Suppose we assume that you have them.

RICK: All right, go ahead.

LASZLO: You must know it's very important I get out of Casablanca.

RICK: Why you more than any of the others stuck here?

LASZLO: It's my privilege to be one of the leaders of a great movement. You 
know what I've been doing. You know what it means to the work, to the lives of 
thousands and thousands of people that I reach America and--

RICK: Don't you ever wonder if what you're fighting for is worth all this?

LASZLO: You might as well question why we breathe. If we stop breathing, we 
die. If stop fighting today's enemies, the world will die.

RICK: What of it? Then it'll be out of its misery.

LASZLO: You know, Monsieur Blaine, you sound like a man trying to convince 
himself of something he doesn't believe in his heart. That wasn't always your 
attitude. You ran guns to Ethiopia. You fought against the Fascists in Spain.

RICK: I was well-paid on both occasions.

LASZLO: The winning side would have paid you better. Isn't it strange that you 
always happen to be fighting on the side of the underdog?

RICK (chuckles): Well, let's say that I'm a poor businessman.

LASZLO: Are you businessman enough to appreciate an offer of a hundred 
thousand francs for those letters?

RICK: Oh, I appreciate it. But if you offered me a million francs, I wouldn't 
accept it.

LASZLO: Very well, then. You have the letters of transit. You won't give them 
to me. But I want Ilsa to be safe. Monsieur Blaine, I ask you as a favor to 
use the letters to take her away from Casablanca.

RICK: You love her that much?

LASZLO: Yes, I love her that much.

RICK: Oh. Sorry, but it's no deal.

LASZLO: But why?

RICK: I suggest that you ask your wife.

LASZLO: My wife?

RICK: Yes.

[Under the last two lines, we hear male voices singing "Die Wacht am Rhein" -- 
the German national anthem. This continues under the following dialogue:]

RICK: Who's singing that song?

LASZLO: Probably Strasser and his Gestapo agents. They followed me here.

RICK: Well, don't start anything. I don't want any trouble in here that'll 
force Renault to close my joint.

LASZLO: You have no objections to your band accompanying me while I sing, do 
you?

RICK: No, go ahead. I'm neutral. If one customer can sing, they can all sing.

LASZLO: They all <u>will</u> sing. (to Sam) Are you ready?

SAM: Yeah, we're ready, Mister Laszlo.

LASZLO: Then, play it!

[The band plays, Laszlo sings the French national anthem, La Marseillaise, 
quickly joined by others in the cafe, who drown out the singing Nazis.]

LASZLO AND THE CAFE PATRONS (singing):
Amour sacré de la Patrie,
Conduis, soutiens nos bras vengeurs,
Liberté, liberté cherie,
Combats avec tes defénseurs;
Combats avec tes défenseurs.
Sous drapeaux, que la victoire
Acoure à tes mâles accents;
Que tes ennemis expirants
Voient ton triomphe et notre gloire! 
Aux armes citoyens!
Formez vos bataillons,
Marchons, marchons!
Qu'un sang impur
Abreuve nos sillons.

APPLAUSE

ANNOUNCER: And so ends Act One of "Casablanca" starring Ingrid Bergman, 
Humphrey Bogart, and Paul Henreid. In just a moment, we will hear Act Two. But 
first, here is a word from our hostess, Lady Esther.

LADY ESTHER: Don't you just love this time of the year when everything seems 
to be taking on new life, new beauty? You know, your skin is changing, too, 
these days, from the winter-weary dryness of February and March to the lovely 
Spring-like freshness of April. And what a pity it is for anyone to hide that 
fresh young look of the skin, that lively awakening April look of the skin, 
with a mask-like face powder. Does the powder you use accent the fresh 
delicate tones April brings to your skin? Or does it hide them, cruelly cover 
them up, make your skin look a little pasty and drab? Now, if you want to keep 
that Springtime look to your skin, if you want your skin to look fresh as a 
daisy all day long, and young and lovely as all awakening nature around you, 
try Lady Esther Face Powder. I know your heart will miss a beat when you look 
in your mirror for Lady Esther Face Powder brings out all the subtle delicate 
charm that nature gives your skin this time of the year. Women say it's by far 
the most flattering face powder they've ever used. You see, Lady Esther Face 
Powder isn't just mixed in the usual way. It's blend by hurricanes, color and 
powder particles whirl together with the force and speed of hurricanes. The 
result is a powder so smooth and fine in texture, it hides little lines and 
blemishes. So rich and exciting in shade, it adds instant life and beauty to 
your appearance. So, if you want to see the miracle of Springtime take place 
right on your own skin before your own mirror, treat yourself to Lady Esther 
Face Powder.

MUSIC: Screen Guild Players Theme

ANNOUNCER: And now the curtain rises on the second act of "Casablanca" 
starring Humphrey Bogart as Rick Blaine, Ingrid Bergman as Ilsa Lund, and Paul 
Henreid as Victor Laszlo. 

MUSICAL BRIDGE

ANNOUNCER: Angered by the manner in which the patrons at Rick's cafe joined 
Victor Laszlo in singing the Marseillaise, Major Strasser forced Captain 
Renault to close Rick's place and ordered Victor Laszlo and Ilsa Lund to 
remain in their hotel.

ILSA: Victor, I'm frightened. Please don't go to the underground meeting 
tonight.

LASZLO: To tell you the truth, my dear, I'm frightened, too. So shall I hide 
here in our hotel room or shall I carry on the best I can?

ILSA: Whatever I would say, you'd carry on.

LASZLO: Since our friend Rick has refused to part with those letters of 
transit, what else am I to do?

ILSA: Did - did Rick give you any reason?

LASZLO: He suggested I ask you.

ILSA: Ask <u>me</u>?

LASZLO: Yes. Ilsa, when I was in the concentration camp, were you lonely in 
Paris?

ILSA: Yes, Victor, I was.

LASZLO: I know how it is to be lonely. I love you very much, my dear.

ILSA: Yes. Yes, I know. Victor, whatever I do, will you believe that--?

LASZLO: You don't even have to say it. I'll believe. I must get to the 
underground meeting now. Good night, my dear.

ILSA: Good night.

MUSICAL BRIDGE 

DOOR OPENS, FOOTSTEPS

ILSA: Hello, Rick.

DOOR CLOSES

RICK: Well, I told you you'd be around to see me but this is a little ahead of 
schedule.

ILSA: Richard, I had to see you.

RICK: Oh, I'm "Richard" again? (savagely) We're back in Paris.

ILSA: Please!

RICK: Your unexpected visit isn't connected by any chance with the letters of 
transit, is it?

ILSA: Richard, you can ask any price but you must give me those letters!

RICK: I went all through that with your husband. There's no deal.

ILSA: Richard, we loved each other once. If those days meant anything at all 
to--

RICK: I wouldn't bring up Paris if I were you. It's poor salesmanship.

ILSA: Please! Please, listen to me! If you knew what really happened--

RICK: I wouldn't believe you no matter what you told me. You'll say anything 
now to get what you want.

ILSA: Oh, Richard, don't you understand? You're our last hope! If you don't 
help us, Victor Laszlo will die in Casablanca!

RICK: What of it? I'm going to die in Casablanca. It's just the spot for it. 
Now, if you-- Well, well, I - I see you've come prepared for anything. Give me 
that gun.

ILSA: No. I tried to reason with you. I tried everything. Now, if you don't 
give me those letters, I'll shoot.

RICK: Go ahead. 

ILSA: Get me those letters.

RICK: Oh, they're - they're right here in my pocket, I don't have to. You want 
them, you'll have to kill me to get them. If Laszlo, if the underground means 
so much, you won't stop at anything. And if you don't shoot fast, I'm gonna 
take that gun away from ya. Now, give it to me.

ILSA: Oh ... oh, Richard ... I tried to stay away ... 

MUSIC UNDER

ILSA: I thought I - I would never see you again, that you were out of my life. 
If you knew what I went through the day you left Paris, how much I loved you, 
how much I still love you.

MUSIC UP AND DOWN

ILSA: We had been married only three weeks when Victor got word that they 
needed him in Prague. He was captured almost immediately and sent to a 
concentration camp. Then came word he was dead. I was lonely before but then I 
had nothing left, not even hope, until I met you.

RICK: But why didn't you tell me all this in Paris?

ILSA: Victor made me promise to keep our marriage a secret. He was afraid that 
if the Gestapo found out I was his wife, it would be dangerous for me and 
those working with us. I kept my promise.

RICK: And then you got word he'd escaped?

ILSA: Yes. A friend called, telling me that he was ill and hiding in a freight 
car near Paris. I didn't tell you because you wouldn't have left Paris and 
they would have caught you. Well, you know the rest.

RICK: It's still a story without an ending. What about now?

ILSA: I'll never have the strength to go away from you again.

RICK: And Laszlo?

ILSA: Oh, you'll help him now, won't you, Richard?

RICK: Yes.

ILSA: He'll have his work, all the things he's been living for.

RICK: All except you.

ILSA: I can't fight it anymore. I don't know what's right any longer. You'll 
have to think for both of us, Richard. For all of us.

RICK: I've already made up our minds and I think I can arrange everything with 
Renault.

MUSICAL BRIDGE

RICK: Here's the set-up, Louis. I'm selling out my place and leaving 
Casablanca on tonight's plane.

RENAULT: What?

RICK: And I'm taking Ilsa Lund with me. Ilsa's Victor Laszlo's wife. Louis, 
I'll make a deal with you.

RENAULT: What is it?

RICK: I want to be sure Laszlo doesn't escape this time. Now, if you could get 
him on a real criminal charge, would - would that be a feather in your cap?

RENAULT: It most certainly would. Germany-- um, Vichy would be grateful.

RICK: Then be at my place a half hour before the plane leaves. I'll arrange 
for Laszlo to be there, thinking I'll sell him the letters of transit. When I 
hand them to him, that'll give you the criminal grounds for making the arrest.

RENAULT: Ricky, I'll miss you -- apparently, the only one in Casablanca that 
has even less scruples than I.

RICK: Thanks. Oh, and, uh, by the way, Louis, come for Laszlo alone. See, I'm 
- I'm taking no chances on a double cross -- even from you.

RENAULT: Double cross? Why, Ricky--!

RICK: Well, you might get ideas about slapping me in the jug for selling those 
letters, you know. Well, don't forget -- a half an hour before plane time, 
alone.

RENAULT: Don't worry, Ricky. This is an honor I'll share with no one.

MUSICAL BRIDGE

LASZLO: Monsieur Blaine, I don't know how to thank you.

RICK: There's no time for that. You won't have any trouble in Lisbon, will 
you?

LASZLO: No, that's all arranged.

RICK: Good. Well, here are the letters.

LASZLO: Monsieur Blaine, I--

RENAULT: Victor Laszlo, you're under arrest on the charge of accessory to the 
murder of the couriers from whom those letters were stolen.

RICK: Now, just a minute. Nobody's gonna be arrested, Louis, not for a while 
yet.

RENAULT: Wha--? Rick, put that gun down. Have you lost your mind?

RICK: Stay where you are, Louis. I wouldn't like to shoot you. But I will if 
you take one more step toward me. Keep your hands away from your pistol.

RENAULT: Well, I suppose you know what you're doing but I wonder if you 
realize what this means, Rick?

RICK: Perfectly. In fact, Captain Renault, we'll take you along as our hostage 
so there won't be any trouble at the airport.

MUSICAL BRIDGE

AIRPORT NOISES - A CAR PULLS UP - PEOPLE GET OUT

RICK: Only ten minutes till the plane leaves. We have to hurry.

LASZLO: I'll go get the luggage aboard. Coming, Ilsa?

ILSA: No, I'll wait here with Rick and the captain.

LASZLO: I'll be right back.

FOOTSTEPS AWAY

RICK: Those letters of transit are in blank, Louis. You fill in the names. 
That'll make it even more official.

RENAULT: Ah, you think of everything, Ricky.

RICK: The names to fill in are ... Mr. and Mrs. Victor Laszlo.

ILSA: Mister--? But why <u>my</u> name, Richard?

RICK: 'Cause you're getting on that plane.

ILSA: But I--! What about you?

RICK: I'm staying here to keep Captain Renault company till the plane leaves.

ILSA: No, no, Richard! What has happened to you? Last night, we--

RICK: Last night, we said a - we said a great many things. Did you mean 
everything <u>you</u> said? 

ILSA: You know I did.

RICK: You said I'd have to do the thinking for all of us. Well, my thinking 
adds up to you getting on that plane with Victor.

ILSA: No! But, Richard--

RICK: I know what you're gonna say, that - that you belong here with me.

ILSA: Yes.

RICK: But if you stayed here, we'd both land in a concentration camp. Isn't 
that right, Louis?

RENAULT: I'm afraid that Major Strasser would insist.

ILSA: You're only saying this to make me go.

RICK: I'm - I'm no good at being noble, Ilsa. I'm saying it because it's 
right. 

ILSA: What about us?

RICK: We'll always have Paris. If we didn't have it, we lost it, till you came 
to Casablanca. We got it back last night.

ILSA: When I said that I would never leave you ...

LASZLO: Everything is in order. Are you ready, Ilsa?

RICK: Laszlo, there's something I'd like you to know before you leave.

LASZLO: I know, Monsieur Rick. Ilsa has told me all I need to know about you 
and herself. I don't ask you to explain anything.

RICK: Well, I'm going to anyway. Might make a difference to you later. Last 
night, Ilsa tried everything to get those letters. When nothing else worked 
she did her best to pretend that she was still in love with me. That was all 
over long ago. For your sake, she tried to pretend it wasn't. I - I tried to 
let her pretend. We couldn't even fool ourselves.

ILSA: Richard ...

LASZLO: Monsieur Blaine, welcome back in the fight. This time our side will 
win. Shall we board the plane, Ilsa?

ILSA: Yes, Victor. I'm ready. God bless you, Richard.

RICK: Goodbye.

FOOTSTEPS AWAY

RENAULT: Well, I suppose you know this isn't going to be pleasant for either 
of us, Ricky. I have to arrest you, of course.

RICK: When the plane leaves, Louis.

RENAULT: Sooner, I'm afraid, Ricky. Here comes Major Strasser.

RICK: You'd better keep quiet, Louis, I'd hate to have to shoot you now.

STRASSER: Why did you ask me to come to the airport, Captain?

RENAULT: Well, I was afraid Victor Laszlo might be leaving on this plane, sir.

RICK: Sort of a double double cross, eh, Louis?

STRASSER: Of all the ridiculous ideas, Captain.

RENAULT: Possibly. Nevertheless, he's on the plane.

STRASSER: Well--! Why do you stand there?! Why don't you stop him?!

RENAULT: Ask Monsieur Rick.

RICK: Stay where you are, Strasser!

STRASSER: Herr Blaine! I would advise you not to interfere with an officer of 
the Third Reich!

RICK: I'm a true neutral, Strasser. I was willing to shoot Captain Renault and 
I'm willing to shoot you.

STRASSER: But you'll shoot too late.

RENAULT: Well... nice shooting, Ricky. But I'm afraid my gendarmes heard those 
shots.

AIRPLANE TAKES OFF

RENAULT: Well, after this affair dies down, Ricky, I think you'd better 
disappear from Casablanca. I can arrange your transportation to a Fighting 
French garrison in Brazzaville.

RICK: All right, Louis. I could use a trip. But, uh, don't forget, you still 
owe me ten thousand francs for our bet on Laszlo's escape.

RENAULT: Oh, well, uh, we'll need that to get to Brazzaville.

RICK: <u>We'll</u> need it?

RENAULT: Certainly. I can be as silly a sentimentalist as you.

RICK: You know, Louis, I think this is the beginning of a beautiful 
friendship.

MUSIC AND APPLAUSE

ANNOUNCER: Thanks to Warner Brothers for "Casablanca" and our sincere 
appreciation to Ingrid Bergman, Paul Henreid, and Humphrey Bogart for 
appearing with the Lady Esther Screen Guild Players tonight.

INGRID BERGMAN: It was our pleasure, Mr. Bradley. We know how these programs 
benefit the Motion Picture Relief Fund. And we know, too, how important the 
Relief Fund is to our profession. We're happy to give our services. Now, 
before you hear about the next week's program, please listen to a word from 
one of our best known beauty authorities, Lady Esther.

LADY ESTHER: Thank you, Miss Bergman. When you hear a woman say in delight, 
"Why that's sheer flattery!", you can be sure she's received a compliment that 
delights her very soul. Now, it's not only sheer flattery when a person pays 
you a wonderful compliment but it's flattery, too, when a new hat makes you 
look smarter and more intriguing or when a face powder makes you seem a lot 
younger, a lot more interesting and attractive. You know, surveys show that 
women have found Lady Esther Face Powder to be the utmost in sheer flattery 
for their skin. Many of them say they prefer Lady Esther Face Powder because 
of the delicate smoothness of its texture. Others speak of the warmth and 
liveliness of the Lady Esther shades. But the smoothness of texture and the 
beauty of shades are both the result of one thing: the Lady Esther Twin 
Hurricane Method. By this method, the color and powder particles are blown 
together with the fury and speed of hurricanes into a finer, smoother blend 
than ever was known before. A powder of such delicate texture it clings to 
your skin like soft mists, a powder so truly blended that the shade looks 
clear, fresh and alive on your skin. Try Lady Esther Face Powder and when you 
look in your mirror I know you'll exclaim with delight, "Why this is sheer 
flattery!"

MUSIC

ANNOUNCER: Next week, the Lady Esther Screen Guild Players will present that 
great farce comedy, "Nothing But the Truth" starring lovely Lucille Ball and 
that great protector of the truth, the man who never tells lies, Frank Morgan. 
Humphrey Bogart will soon be seen in Warner Brothers' production "Action in 
the North Atlantic." Ingrid Bergman, Humphrey Bogart and Paul Henreid can 
currently be seen in the Warner Brothers' picture "Casablanca." We wish to 
thank the two hundred members of the Fighting French in our audience tonight 
who sang the Marseillaise. Music on tonight's program was arranged and 
conducted by Wilbur Hatch. The Screen Guild Players are presented every Monday 
night at this time by Lady Esther. To save materials, buy the largest size of 
Lady Esther Face Cream. This is Truman Bradley speaking for Lady Esther, 
saying thank you and good night.
