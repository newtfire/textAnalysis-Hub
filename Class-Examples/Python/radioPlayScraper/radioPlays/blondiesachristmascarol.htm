"<u>BLONDIE</u>" 
MONDAY, DECEMBER 25, 1939 
4:30 - 5:00 P.M. 
7:30 - 8:00 P.M. 

GOODWIN: AH, AH, AH -- DON'T TOUCH THAT DIAL -- THIS IS THE "BLONDIE" PROGRAM 
BROUGHT TO YOU BY THE CAMEL CIGARETTE PEOPLE. 

<u>ORCHESTRA: (THEME...EIGHT BARS...THEN UNDER FOR:</u>)

GOODWIN: BEFORE WE DROP OVER TO THE BUMSTEAD HOUSE TO VISIT CHIC YOUNG'S 
FAMOUS CHARACTERS "BLONDIE" AND "DAGWOOD," A WORD FROM THE MAKERS OF CAMEL 
CIGARETTES.

DIFFERENT CIGARETTES HAVE DIFFERENT WAYS OF BURNING. SOME BURN FAST. SOME MORE 
SLOWLY. SOME JUST SORT OF IN BETWEEN. BUT IT HAS BEEN SETTLED BY RECENT 
IMPARTIAL LABORATORY TESTS THAT CAMEL CIGARETTES ARE SLOWER BURNING -- TO PUT 
IT EXACTLY AS REPORTED, CAMEL CIGARETTES BURNED TWENTY-FIVE PER CENT SLOWER 
THAN THE AVERAGE OF THE FIFTEEN OTHER OF THE LARGEST-SELLING BRANDS TESTED -- 
SLOWER THAN ANY OF THEM. THE EFFECTS OF THIS SLOWER BURNING ARE THAT CAMELS 
GIVE EXTRA COOLNESS -- EXTRA MILDNESS, A MILDNESS THAT DEALS GENTLY WITH YOUR 
TASTE AND YOUR THROAT -- AND EXTRA FLAVOR, TOO. YOU'LL FIND THAT THESE EXTRA 
ADVANTAGES ARE CONVINCINGLY PRESENT WHEN YOU TURN TO CAMEL CIGARETTES. AND 
THERE'S AN ECONOMY SIDE TO SMOKING SLOW-BURNING CAMELS, TOO. WE'LL HEAR MORE 
ABOUT THAT -- LATER. 

<u>ORCHESTRA: (UP FOR CURTAIN</u>) 

GOODWIN: AND NOW -- SINCE OUR WEEKLY VISIT TO THE BUMSTEADS FALLS ON CHRISTMAS 
DAY...WE FIND THEM...SURROUNDED BY EX-CHRISTMAS PACKAGES AND WHAT CAME OUT OF 
THEM!....DAGWOOD IS ON THE COUCH...RELAXING AFTER DINNER...SOMEWHERE, NOT 
QUITE FAR ENOUGH OFF -- BABY BEATS A TOY DRUM (<u>DRUM IN</u>) AND AT THE DESK -- 
BLONDIE IS CHECKING OVER SOME FIGURES OF HER OWN... 

BLONDIE: DAGWOOD? 

DAG: (SLEEPY) HMMMMM? 

BLONDIE: I'VE BEEN GOING OVER THE LIST OF PEOPLE WHO SENT US CHRISTMAS CARDS 
-- AND THE LIST OF PEOPLE WE SENT CARDS TO. 

DAG: UHUH. 

BLONDIE: YOU CAN'T WIN DAGWOOD. 

DAG: EH? 

BLONDIE: IT'S ALWAYS THE SAME WAY. THIS YEAR <u>WE</u> SENT <u>THREE</u> CARDS TO PEOPLE WHO 
DIDN'T SEND <u>US</u> ANY. 

DAG: OH WELL....WE GOT PLENTY. 

BLONDIE: THAT ISN'T IT DAGWOOD. SIX PEOPLE SENT <u>US</u> CARDS THAT WE DIDN'T SEND 
ANY <u>TO</u>! ISN'T THAT TERRIBLE? 

DAG: WELL WE COULD SEND THREE EXTRAS WE GOT TO THREE PEOPLE WE DIDN'T AND COME 
OUT THREE AHEAD. 

BLONDIE: OH NO DAGWOOD...WE'LL HAVE TO MAKE UP FOR IT NEXT YEAR. 

DAG: LOOK BLONDIE! LET'S NOT START FIGURING ON <u>NEXT</u> YEAR YET! HUH? I'M ALL 
TIRED OUT FROM <u>THIS</u> ONE! (<u>DRUM AS IT PASSES DOOR AND DOWN AGAIN</u>) <u>HEY</u>...WHO 
<u>GAVE</u> BABY DUMPLING THAT DRUM? 

BLONDIE: MR. FUDDLE. 

DAG: AHA. SPITE WORK! 

BLONDIE: OH NO DAGWOOD! 

DAG: I BET IT <u>WAS</u> -- JUST BECAUSE I GAVE THEIR LITTLE ALVIN A <u>BUGLE</u>! 

BABY: (COMING IN) (<u>DRUM UP WITH HIM</u>) LOOKIT DADDY! LOOKIT MOMMIE! I'M A 
PARADE! 

BLONDIE: YES -- WE SEE YOU BABY. 

DAG: WE <u>HEAR</u> YOU TOO! GO BE A PARADE OVER AT FUDDLES! 

BLONDIE: NOW DAGWOOD! IT'S CHRISTMAS. 

DAG: I KNOW -- BUT I WAS UP PRACTICALLY ALL NIGHT HELPING SANTY CLAUS AND.... 

BABY: (<u>DRUM OUT</u>) DID YOU SEE HIM DADDY? 

DAG: OH SURE. 

BABY: DID HE SAY WHAT HE WAS SO MAD ABOUT? 

DAG: HOW'S THAT BABY? SANTY NEVER GETS MAD. 

BABY: HE WAS LAST NIGHT -- I HEARD HIM. 

BLONDIE: OH DEAR! <u>WHAT</u> DID YOU HEAR BABY? 

BABY: WELL I HEARD A BIG BUMP AND IT WOKE ME UP...AND THEN I HEARD SANTY 
HOLLERING THAT HE STEPPED ON A ROLLER SKATE! 

DAG: OH -- YEAH. 

BLONDIE: YOU MUST REMEMBER NOT TO LEAVE THOSE SKATES AROUND BABY. SUPPOSE 
SANTY DID GET MAD AND NEVER CAME BACK? 

BABY: OH HE'LL FORGET IT BY NEXT YEAR. (<u>DRUMS AGAIN</u>) (<u>GROWS LOUDER</u>)

DAG: GOSH! THEY PUT STRONG STUFF IN THOSE DRUMS DON'T THEY? DON'T THEY <u>EVER</u> 
BREAK? 

BABY: IT'S BECAUSE I'M SUCH A GOOD DRUMMER I KNOW JUST HOW HARD TO HIT IT. 
(<u>MARCHES OFF WITH DRUM</u>) HERE I GO...BUT I'LL BE BACK. 

DAGWOOD: (CALLS) NO HURRY! (<u>DRUM FADES BUT NOT OUT</u>) BOY! I'M TIRED! IF IT WAS 
QUIET I BET I'D SLEEP FOR A WEEK. WHAT ARE YOU FIGURING NOW, BLONDIE? 

BLONDIE: JUST MAKING SURE WE SENT A PRESENT TO EVERYBODY WHO SENT US ONE. WE 
DID. 

DAGWOOD: WE SENT ONE EXTRA, TOO. TO DITHERS. CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT GUY NOT 
GIVING US A PRESENT THIS YEAR, BLONDIE? 

BLONDIE: I GUESS HE JUST OVERLOOKED IT. 

DAGWOOD: HE DID NOT. HE IS JUST TOO MEAN TO GIVE OUT. 

BLONDIE: OH NO, DAGWOOD, IT WAS JUST SOME MISTAKE. 

DAGWOOD: YOU KNOW WHO DITHERS REMINDS ME OF? THAT OLD BIRD IN DICKENS' 
"CHRISTMAS CAROL" -- SCROOGE! 

BLONDIE: <u>DAGWOOD</u>! 

DAGWOOD: YES, SIR. YOU KNOW AUNT BESSIE SENT BABY A COPY OF THAT STORY. 

BLONDIE: I KNOW. 

DAGWOOD: AND WHILE YOU WERE GETTING DINNER I READ IT TO BABY. I READ IT TWICE. 
AND SCROOGE REMINDED ME OF DITHERS <u>BOTH</u> <u>TIMES</u>! (<u>DRUM BUILDS AGAIN</u>) OH, GOLLY. 
HERE COMES THE DRUM BACK! 

BLONDIE: I'LL TRY TO KEEP BABY QUIET IF YOU WANT A LITTLE NAP, DAGWOOD. 

DAGWOOD: A LITTLE NAP? I'M SHORT A WHOLE NIGHT'S SLEEP. (<u>DRUM UP</u>) 

BLONDIE: (<u>OVER DRUM</u>) BABY! BABY! NOT SO LOUD. POOR DADDY'S TIRED. <u>STOP</u> NOW! 
(<u>DRUM OUT</u>) 

BABY: WELL, BUT, MOMMIE...THIS IS ABOUT ALL I HAVE TO PLAY WITH --

BLONDIE: WHY, BABY DUMPLING YOU HAVE <u>LOTS</u> OF TOYS. 

BABY: THEY'RE MOST ALL BROKEN NOW, MOMMIE. 

DAGWOOD: WHY DID YOU BREAK THE <u>QUIET</u> ONES <u>FIRST</u>? 

BLONDIE: HERE'S YOUR TOY TELEPHONE. YOU COULD PLAY WITH THAT. MAKE BELIEVE 
CALL UP SOMEBODY. 

BABY: OKAY, MOMMIE. WAIT'LL I PUT DOWN MY DRUM. (<u>THROWS IT DOWN</u>) 

DAGWOOD: OOOOH! LISTEN, BABY. CALL UP MOMMIE ON THAT TOY PHONE AND ASK HER TO 
KEEP THE HOUSE QUIET. DADDY WANTS A NAP. 

BABY: OKAY, DADDY. (<u>RINGS TOY PHONE</u>) HELLO! IS THIS YOU, MOMMIE? 

BLONDIE: HELLO! YES, BABY! 

BABY: HEY, MOMMIE! IS IT OKAY FOR DADDY TO GO TO SLEEP ON THE COUCH WITH HIS 
SHOES ON? 

BLONDIE: WELL -- ON CHRISTMAS I GUESS IT IS. 

BABY: OKAY. G'BYE. HEY, MOMMIE...READ ME A STORY?

BLONDIE: WELL, WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE? 

BABY: THAT BOOK AUNT BESSIE SENT. CHRISTMAS CAROL. 

BLONDIE: DADDY SAID HE READ YOU THAT TWICE. 

DAGWOOD: I DID. IT'S A FINE STORY -- BUT TWICE IN ONE DAY IS ENOUGH. I KNOW IT 
BY HEART! 

BABY: <u>YOU</u> READ IT, MOMMIE. 

BLONDIE: OH, ALL RIGHT. I'LL READ SOFTLY SO DADDY CAN SLEEP. 

BABY: HERE IT IS. START HERE WHERE IT TELLS ABOUT MEAN OLD SCROOGE, MOMMIE. 

BLONDIE: ALL RIGHT...IT SAYS, "SCROOGE! A SQUEEZING -- WRENCHING -- GRASPING 
-- SCRAPING -- CLUTCHING -- COVETOUS OLD SINNER! HARD AND SHARP AS FLINT".... 

DAGWOOD: (SAYS IT <u>WITH</u> HER) "HARD AND SHARP AS FLINT...."

BLONDIE: GOODNESS. I THINK DADDY <u>DOES</u> KNOW IT BY HEART. 

DAGWOOD: (SLEEPY) REMINDS ME OF DITHERS... 

BLONDIE: SSSH, DAGWOOD. 

BABY: GO ON, MOMMIE... 

BLONDIE: WELL, "HE CARRIED HIS OWN LOW TEMPERATURE ALWAYS ABOUT WITH HIM. HE 
ICED HIS OFFICE ON DOG DAYS AND DIDN'T THAW IT ONE DEGREE AT CHRISTMAS..." 

DAGWOOD: (SLEEPY) OLD "SCROOGE -- DITHERS." 

BLONDIE: "THE HEAVIEST RAIN AND SNOW AND HAIL AND SLEET COULD BOAST OF THE 
ADVANTAGE OVER HIM IN ONLY ONE RESPECT. THEY OFTEN "CAME DOWN" HANDSOMELY --

DITHERS: 'TAIN'T FUNNY TO ME, CRATCHIT! WAKE UP! 

DAGWOOD: I -- I WISH I COULD... 

DITHERS: TROUBLE IS I KEEP THIS OFFICE TOO HOT FOR YOU. 

DAGWOOD: <u>HOT</u>? LOOK AT THE FROST ON THE WINDOWS, MR. SCROOGE. 

DITHERS: NONSENSE, CRATCHIT...THAT'S JUST A LITTLE FOG OUTSIDE. IT'S FOGGY ALL 
OVER LONDON TODAY. 

DAGWOOD: LONDON? OH -- OH YEAH...

DITHERS: YOU ACT TIPSY, CRATCHIT. BEEN DRINKING THE <u>INK</u>?

DAGWOOD: NO, SIR! I <u>NEVER</u> DRINK INK. ANYWAY IT'S FROZEN...

DAGWOOD: TOOOH. YES, SIR? 

DITHERS: WHAT'S THE IDEA OF <u>TWO</u> CANDLES BURNING AT ONCE? ON EACH SIDE OF THE 
LEDGER? 

DAGWOOD: WHY, THAT'S A LITTLE INVENTION OF MINE, MR. SCROOGE. I CAN SEE BOTH 
SIDES OF THE LEDGER AT ONCE THAT WAY. 

DITHERS: <u>BAH</u>! YOU ONLY WORK ON <u>ONE</u> SIDE AT A <u>TIME</u>. (PUFFS) THERE! ONE IS 
ENOUGH! (<u>TOY DRUM HEARD</u>) 

DAGWOOD: LISTEN!...THAT'S SOUNDS LIKE A DRUM. (<u>RHYTHM CHANGES TO HOOF BEATS 
CLOPPING</u>) 

DITHERS: NONSENSE -- THAT'S A HORSE! IT'S SOME FOOL WASTING HIS MONEY ON A 
HANSOM CAB! PROBABLY MY NEPHEW, FRED! 

DAGWOOD: WELL, IT MUST BE NICE TO TAKE A CAB WHEN IT'S SO FOGGY.

DITHERS: BAH! LAST TIME FRED HAD A CAB HE PARKED DOUBLE IN FRONT OF BUCKINGHAM 
PALACE -- AND <u>I</u> HAD TO FIX HIS TICKET! (AUTO HORN FAINT) 

DAGWOOD: LISTEN. THEY MUST HAVE MET ANOTHER CAB! 

DITHERS: THE TRAFFIC IN LONDON TODAY IS A MENACE TO LIFE AND LIMB. I'LL WRITE 
A LETTER TO THE TIMES! 

DAGWOOD: SAY! SPEAKING OF YOUR NEPHEW FRED, REMINDS ME...HE SENT A MESSAGE 
TODAY.

DAGWOOD: IT'S AFTER CLOSING TIME, SIR. AND IT'S A LONG WALK TO CAMDEN TOWN -- 
NOW THAT THE HORSE -- TRAMS HAVE STOPPED RUNNING. 

DITHERS: WHAT? STOPPED? WHY WASN'T I TOLD? 

DAGWOOD: WELL -- RIGHT AFTER YOU GOT ON THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS, MR. SCROOGE -- 
THE TRAMS STOPPED RUNNING. 

DITHERS: WHY? WHAT HAPPENED? 

DAGWOOD: WELL -- YOU GAVE ORDERS TO CUT DOWN THE HORSES' HAY. 

DITHERS: I PUT 'EM IN TRAINING THAT'S ALL. GAVE 'EM ONE HANDFUL LESS EVERY 
DAY. THAT WAY THEY DIDN'T MISS IT -- AND IN A FEW WEEKS I'D HAVE THEM USED TO 
<u>NO</u> HAY! 

DAGWOOD: YES, SIR...BUT JUST WHEN THEY WERE GETTING USED TO IT -- THEY ALL 
DIED! 

DITHERS: BAH! JUST LACK OF COOPERATION, THAT'S ALL! WELL, DON'T STAND TALKING,

DAGWOOD: <u>WHEEEEEEEE</u>!

DITHERS: I FLEW, CRATCHIT. FLEW THROUGH THE AIR! 

DAGWOOD: YOU MUST BE <u>SPOOFING</u>, SIR. 

DITHERS: I <u>NEVER</u> SPOOF, CRATCHIT. I HAD A NASTY EXPERIENCE. I FOUND A GHOST IN 
MY BEDROOM. I WAS COUNTING MY MONEY BEFORE GOING TO BED...AND WHEN I TOOK THE 
PADLOCK OFF MY WALLET... 

BLONDIE: I KNOW. A MOTH FLEW OUT! 

DITHERS: YES -- <u>NO</u>! IT WASN'T A MOTH, IT WAS A <u>GHOST</u>...AND IT DIDN'T COME OUT 
OF MY WALLET IT <u>WAFTED</u> THROUGH THE <u>WALL</u>! BUT THAT'S NOT THE WORST. 

DAGWOOD: NO? 

DITHERS: NO! THIS GHOST SAID THREE OTHER GHOSTS WOULD COME FOR ME! THEY'RE 
COMING TO TAKE ME FOR A RIDE. 

BLONDIE: OH MY! GANGSTER GHOSTS? 

DITHERS: NO, CHRISTMAS GHOSTS. THE FIRST ONE WILL BE THERE WHEN THE CLOCK 
STRIKES <u>ONE</u>. BUT I'LL FOOL HIM. I <u>WON'T</u> BE THERE...I'LL BE <u>HERE!</u>


DAGWOOD: WELL -- THAT'S FOOLING THEM! (TAKE) <u>HEY!</u> MAYBE THEY WILL FOLLOW YOU 
HERE! (<u>CLOCK WHIRS AND STRIKES ONE</u>) TOOOOOH! THERE GOES THE CLOCK! 

DITHERS: AND HERE COMES THE GHOST! I HEAR HIM ON THE STAIRS. (<u>THUMPING SOUND 
SLOW...SOLEMN</u>) 

BLONDIE: MAYBE JUST ONE OF THE NEIGHBORS. 

DITHERS: NO. IT'S THE GHOST! COMING FOR ME! IN A MINUTE HE'LL KNOCK ON THAT 
DOOR. (<u>THUMPING NEAR...THEN OUT</u>) 

DAGWOOD: IF YOU'RE GOING TO KNOCK...<u>KNOCK!</u> (<u>FUDDLE KNOCK HEARD</u>) 

BLONDE: WHY, THAT <u>IS</u> ONE OF OUR NEIGHBORS. 

DAGWOOD: SURE -- FEZZIWIG FUDDLE! HE'S A CARD, TOO! 

DITHERS: DON'T LET HIM IN! 

FUDDLE: (LOW VOICE ON ECHO CHAMBER) I <u>AM</u> IN, OLD SCROOGE-BALL! (LAUGHS) 

BLONDIE: THAT <u>SOUNDS</u> LIKE FEZZIWIG FUDDLE.

DAGWOOD: YEAH -- AND IT LOOKS A LITTLE LIKE HIM! BUT IT KINDA LOOKS LIKE A 
<u>GHOST</u>, TOO.

FUDDLE: (ON ECHO CHAMBER?) WELL, THAT JUST <u>GHOST-A</u> SHOW YOU! (LAUGHS) 

DITHERS: WHAT DO YOU WANT WITH ME? 

FUDDLE: WHY, BUDDY. I'M THE SENIOR MEMBER OF THE FIRM OF <u>GHOST</u> <u>GHOST</u> AND 
<u>GHOST</u>! <u>TOURS</u> <u>DELUXE</u>! HAVE A CARD, CHUM!

DAGWOOD: WHERE ARE THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE FIRM? 

FUDDLE: OH THE OTHER BOYS WILL BE ALONG LATER. NOW WE HAVE TOURS OF CHRISTMAS 
PAST -- PRESENT -- AND FUTURE. I HEAD UP THE <u>PAST</u> DEPARTMENT MYSELF. READY FOR 
A LITTLE EXCURSION, SCROOGEY-WOOGEY? (LAUGHS) 

DITHERS: <u>NO</u>. I DON'T WANT TO GO BACK IN THE PAST. I -- <u>I'VE</u> <u>BEEN</u> <u>THERE!</u>

FUDDLE: WELL -- YOU'D NEVER KNOW THE OLD PLACE NOW! 

DITHERS: BAH! 

FUDDLE: COME ON -- THIS IS FOR FREE! 

DITHERS: <u>FREE?</u> ANY TIPS?

FUDDLE: NARY A TIP, PAL. COME ON! I'LL SHOW YOU SOME NICE SPIRITS. 

DITHERS: NO. YOU'LL GET ME BACK IN THE PAST -- AND THEN MAKE ME WALK HOME!

FUDDLE: NO TRICKS ON OUR PERSONALLY CONDUCTED GHOST RIDES, FRIEND. THAT 
WOULDN'T BE SHOWING THE <u>RIGHT</u> <u>SPIRIT</u>. (LAUGHS) GET IT? 

DAGWOOD: LOOK, MR. SCROOGE, WHY DON'T YOU GO WITH HIM? HE MAKES ME NERVOUS. 

BLONDIE: YES, MR. SCROOGE. A LITTLE FRESH AIR WOULD DO YOU GOOD. 

FUDDLE: DON'T WORRY, FOLKS. HE'LL <u>GO</u> <u>WITH</u> <u>ME</u> OKAY WHEN THE <u>CLOCK</u> <u>STRIKES</u> <u>ONE.</u> 

(<u>WHIRRING SOUND</u>) 

DAGWOOD: IT'S GOING TO STRIKE NOW! 

DITHERS: I'M NOT GOING! I -- I'LL HOLD ON TO DAG CRATCHIT HERE!

DAGWOOD: NO! LISTEN! LEGGO! (<u>WHIRRING STOPS AS CLOCK STRIKES ONE</u>) TOOOOOH! 

BABY: LOOKIT, MOMMIE! THE GHOST IS FADING!

BLONDIE: SO IS MR. SCROOGE! 

DAGWOOD: SO AM <u>I</u>! <u>HELP</u>! (<u>WHISTLE GOING AWAY FAST</u>) 

BABY: THEY'VE ALL GONE, MOMMIE! 

DAGWOOD: (FAINT ON ECHO CHAMBER) OH <u>BLOOOOOOOOONDIE!</u> 

<u>MUSIC: IN THEN SEGUE TO THEME FOR:</u>) 

(<u>CENTRAL COMMERCIAL</u>) 

GOODWIN: THERE ARE SEVERAL REASONS WHY SO MANY THOUSANDS OF SMOKERS ARE 
TURNING TO SLOW-BURNING CAMEL CIGARETTES. EXTRA MILDNESS IS ONE -- ALSO EXTRA 
COOLNESS AND THE EXTRA FINE FLAVOR AND AROMA OF CAMEL'S FINER, MORE EXPENSIVE 
TOBACCOS. BUT DON'T OVERLOOK THIS FACT: SLOW-BURNING CAMELS ALSO GIVE YOU 
ECONOMY. RECENT IMPARTIAL LABORATORY TESTS TELL THE WHOLE STORY. IN THESE 
TESTS, CAMELS BURNED TWENTY-FIVE PER CENT <u>SLOWER</u> THAN THE AVERAGE OF THE 
FIFTEEN OTHER OF THE LARGEST-SELLING BRANDS TESTED -- SLOWER THAN ANY OF THEM. 
THAT MEANS CAMELS GIVE A SMOKING <u>PLUS</u> EQUAL, ON THE AVERAGE, TO <u>FIVE</u> <u>EXTRA</u> 
<u>SMOKES</u> <u>PER</u> <u>PACK</u>. SO JOIN THOSE WHO ARE TURNING TO SLOW-BURNING...TO SLOW-
BURNING CAMEL CIGARETTES. (CHANGE OF PACE) AND TO ALL OF YOU WHO RECEIVED 
CAMELS FOR CHRISTMAS, MAY YOU ENJOY MORE PLEASURE PER PUFF AND MORE PUFFS PER 
PACK IN AMERICA'S NUMBER ONE CIGARETTE...CAMELS.

[MUSIC:] (<u>CURTAIN AFTER CENTRAL</u>)

GOODWIN: AND NOW...BACK IN THE BUMSTEAD HOME. WE FIND BLONDIE STILL READING TO 
BABY DUMPLING...AND DAGWOOD STILL ON THE COUCH...DREAMING THAT HE IS DAG 
CRATCHIT. HE SEEMS TO BE HAVING A DOUBLE FEATURE DREAM. LET'S CATCH THE LAST 
HALF. .. 

DAGWOOD: (SNORES...THEN MUTTERS) HEY -- LEGGO! LEGGO, SCROOGE! TOOOH! (<u>WHISTLE 
COMING BACK</u>) HEY, SCROOGE. OPEN YOUR EYES. WE'RE BACK HOME AGAIN! 

BLONDIE: WELL, DAG CRATCHIT! YOU GAVE ME A TURN. GOING OUT LIKE THAT WITH A 
PERFECT STRANGER LIKE THAT GHOST!

DAGWOOD: I COULDN'T HELP IT, BLONDIE CRATCHIT. 

BABY: HAVE A NICE RIDE, FATHER? 

DAGWOOD: WELL -- YES AND NO. 

DITHERS: <u>NO</u>. BUT DEFINITELY -- <u>NO!</u>

DAGWOOD: SEE -- THE GHOST SHOWED MR. SCROOGE HIS OLD SCHOOL DAYS! BOY! WAS 
LITTLE SCROOGE SMART AT ARITHMETIC! 

DITHERS: OH I DON'T KNOW. 

DAGWOOD: SURE, YOU WERE. LISTEN! THE TEACHER ASKED HIM IF HE HAD FIVE DOLLARS 
TO DIVIDE AMONG NINE OTHER KIDS, HOW MUCH WOULD EACH KID GET. AND SCROOGE 
FIGURED EACH KID WOULD GET THIRTY SEVEN CENTS.

[[BLONDIE: BUT THAT'S NOT RIGHT.

DITHERS: CERTAINLY IT'S RIGHT. LISTEN! I HAVE FIVE BUCKS TO START WITH. I GET 
TEN PER CENT RIGHT AWAY AS THE KIDS' BROKER. THAT LEAVES FOUR FIFTY. CARRYING 
CHARGES ON THE <u>OVERHEAD</u> TO KEEP THE <u>UP</u>-KEEP <u>DOWN</u> IS ANOTHER TEN PER CENT...TO 
ME! THAT BRINGS IT DOWN TO THREE SIXTY! THE ACCOUNTANT WILL NEED ANOTHER TEN 
PER CENT...AND I'M THE ACCOUNTANT! SO THAT LEAVES THREE-TWENTY-FOUR DIVIDED BY 
NINE WOULD BE THIRTY-SEVEN AND A HALF CENTS EACH...<u>BUT</u>... 

DAGWOOD: UHUH.

BLONDIE: BUT WHAT, MR. SCROOGE? 

DITHERS: BUT I DON'T HAVE CHANGE FOR A HALF A CENT SO THAT'S BREAKAGE -- WHICH 
<u>I</u> KEEP...AND THAT GIVES THEM THIRTY-SEVEN CENTS EACH. 

BLONDIE: AND A DOLLAR SIXTY SEVEN FOR <u>YOU.</u> ]]

DITHERS: WELL, I WAS YOUNG AND GREEN IN THOSE DAYS. I COULD MAKE A <u>REAL</u> DEAL 
WITH THOSE KIDS NOW! 

BLONDIE: I SEE WHAT SPOILED YOUR TRIP NOW, MR. SCROOGE! <u>REMORSE!</u>

BLONDIE: LISTEN!

DAGWOOD: YEAH...HERE COMES THE NEXT ONE. THE GHOST OF CHRISTMAS PRESENT! 

(<u>THUMPS OUT...FUDDLE KNOCK ON DOOR</u>) 

BLONDIE: WHY, THAT SOUNDS LIKE THE FEZZIWIG FUDDLE GHOST AGAIN.

DAGWOOD: COME IN. 

FUDDLE: (ECHO CHAMBER) I <u>AM</u> IN, BUDDY. I JUST WAFTED THROUGH THE WALL. 
(LAUGHS) 

DITHERS: YOU'RE THE SAME ONE WHO WAS HERE BEFORE! I THOUGHT <u>YOU</u> WERE THE GHOST 
OF CHRISTMAS <u>PAST!</u>

FUDDLE: WELL -- I'LL TELL YOU! OUR FIRM IS PRETTY BUSY RIGHT NOW...AND I HAVE 
TO DOUBLE UP ON MY ROUTE. 

DAGWOOD: SO NOW YOU'RE THE GHOST OF CHRISTMAS PRESENT, EH? 

FUDDLE: NOPE! THE WAY OLD SCROOGE HAS BEEN ACTING, HE AIN'T GOIN' TO <u>GET</u> ANY 
CHRISTMAS <u>PRESENT</u> (LAUGHS) GET IT? OH I'M HOT AS A FIRECRACKER TONIGHT! 

DAGWOOD: WELL -- IF YOU'RE A FIRECRACKER...WHY DON'T YOU <u>GO</u> <u>OFF</u> (LAUGHS) HOW'S 
THAT? GET IT? 

FUDDLE: <u>NO</u>. 

DAGWOOD: OH! WELL, LOOKIT! LEAVE ME OUT ON THIS NEXT TRIP, WILL YOU? 

FUDDLE: WHAT'S THE MATTER. DIDN'T YOU LIKE THE RIDE? 

DAGWOOD: WELL -- ER -- YOU KNOW HOW IT IS. I'M NOT USED TO FLYING OVER 
HOUSETOPS WITH GHOSTS. 

FUDDLE: GHOSTS FLY A LITTLE <u>HIGH</u> FOR YOU, EH? WELL -- AROUND CHRISTMAS TIME -- 
YOU'VE GOT TO EXPECT <u>HIGH</u> <u>SPIRITS</u>. (LAUGHS) OH I GOT A MILLION! 

DITHERS: GOT A MILLION, EH? WELL, NOW MAYBE WE CAN DO BUSINESS. 

FUDDLE: WE'RE <u>GOING</u> TO DO BUSINESS, POP! <u>MY</u> <u>WAY!</u> GET READY TO <u>REALLY</u> STEP OUT

DITHERS: LISTEN! I DON'T <u>WANT</u> TO SEE ANY MORE SPOOKS!

(<u>WHIRRING OF CLOCK AGAIN</u>) OOOOOOPS GET READY! THERE GOES THE CLOCK! 

DITHERS: NO! NO, I WON'T GO! 

DAGWOOD: DON'T GRAB <u>ME</u> THIS TIME! HOLD ONTO THE TABLE! (<u>CLOCK

BLONDIE: SO IS THE TABLE! (<u>WHISTLE COMING BACK</u>) (<u>BIG THUMP</u>) OH <u>LOOK!</u> 

DAGWOOD: YEAH. THE GHOST SENT BACK THE TABLE. WELL, WE'LL HAVE SOMETHING TO 
EAT CHRISTMAS DINNER OFF OF ANYWAY. 

BLONDIE: YES, BUT WE HAVEN'T ANYTHING IN THE HOUSE <u>FOR</u> CHRISTMAS DINNER! 

DAGWOOD: YOU MEAN THERE ISN'T ANY LITTLE SNACK AT ALL IN THE ICE BOX? 

BLONDIE: ICE BOX? WHAT'S THAT? 

DAGWOOD: OH I FORGOT. THAT'S ANOTHER THING THEY HAVEN'T INVENTED YET. 

BLONDIE: WHAT WILL IT BE WHEN IT <u>IS</u> INVENTED?

DAGWOOD: OH BOY. WHY, IT'LL BE SOMETHING TO KEEP FOOD IN...ALL <u>KINDS</u> OF FOOD 
-- AND <u>SANDWICH</u> <u>MATERIAL!</u> BOY -- CAN I MAKE A SANDWICH -- WHEN I HAVE THE 
STUFF. 

BLONDIE: IT'S A SHAME WE'RE SO POOR, DAG CRATCHIT. 

DAGWOOD: YEAH...NO CHRISTMAS DINNER. I TRIED TO BORROW ONE OF THOSE TWO CROWS 
THE CHIMNEY SWEEP CAUGHT...BUT IT DIDN'T WORK.

BLONDIE: HE NEEDED THEM FOR HIS OWN CHRISTMAS DINNER, I GUESS. 

DAGWOOD: YEAH. HE SAID HIS WIFE'S FOLKS WERE COMING OVER. 

BLONDIE: WELL, DON'T YOU CARE, DAG CRATCHIT. WE'RE BETTER OFF THAN POOR MR. 
SCROOGE! IMAGINE BEING HAUNTED BY FLYING GHOSTS LIKE THAT. 

DAGWOOD: HEY, LISTEN! (<u>THUMPS ON STAIRS AS BEFORE</u>) IT'S ONE OF THE GHOST BOYS 
AGAIN. WHAT DOES HE WANT NOW? <u>SCROOGE</u> ISN'T HERE ANYMORE! (<u>THUMPS OUT...FUDDLE 
KNOCK ON DOOR</u>) 

BLONDIE: WELL, OPEN THE DOOR AND <u>SEE</u> WHAT HE WANTS, DAG CRATCHIT. IT MAKES ME 
NERVOUS WHEN HE FLOATS THROUGH THE WALL. (<u>KNOCK AGAIN...LOUDER</u>) 

DAGWOOD: OKAY. I'M COMING! (<u>DOOR OPENS</u>) WHY, IT'S MR. <u>SCROOGE!</u> 

DITHERS: HA! FOOLED YOU, DIDN'T I? 

BLONDIE: WHY, MR. SCROOGE! HOW DID YOU GET AWAY FROM THAT LAST GHOST? 

DITHERS: <u>BAH!</u> THEY WEREN'T GHOSTS AT ALL. JUST SOMETHING I ET!

DAGWOOD: YOU MEAN YOU WERE DREAMING? 

SCROOGE: THAT MUST HAVE BEEN IT.

BLONDIE: BUT HOW DID <u>WE</u> GET INTO <u>YOUR</u> DREAM?

DITHERS: <u>ANYTHING</u> CAN GET INTO A DREAM, BLONDIE CRATCHIT! <u>LOOK</u>! WANT TO SEE
