ANNOUNCER 
On July 1, 1776, the Continental Congress of the American Colonies faced one 
of the most important crises this country has ever passed through. Upon what 
happened that night depended the fate of the resolution before Congress which 
declared that: "These United Colonies are, and of right ought to be, free and 
independent States, that they are absolved from all allegiance to the British 
Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great 
Britain is, and ought to be, totally dissolved." This was known as the Lee 
Resolution, the fate of which was to be decided by one of the most famous 
rides in history--Caesar Rodney's ride.

Let us begin our story on the morning of July 1, 1776, in the Continental 
Congress at Philadelphia. For nearly three hours the Lee Resolution has been 
the subject of furious debate. The members are all excited, anxious, 
overwrought. The debate has become bitter, for some of the members are 
unalterably opposed to independence. It is about noon when Dr. Franklin rises 
to address the Chair:

FRANKLIN 
Mr. President--

HANCOCK 
Dr. Franklin.

FRANKLIN 
I have sat uneasily, sir, during the furious debate, hoping that the storm 
would subside, and the bright sun of reason would shine upon us through the 
parting clouds. But, sir, I am fearful that the storm is gathering with new 
fury, and that we may be blown too far from our course to steer safely into 
harbor. Perhaps, sir, we should end this debate which seems to bid fair to 
wreck our unity. I move you, sir, that we lay the Lee Resolution on the table.

ALL 
No, no, bring it to a vote!
Yes, lay it on the table!
Let's vote on it now!
Have it over with! [etc.]

HANCOCK [sound of gavel] 
Order! Order! Do I hear a second to Dr. Franklin's motion?

VOICE 
Second!

HANCOCK 
You have heard the motion--are there any remarks?

RUTLEDGE 
Mr. President--

HANCOCK 
Mr. Rutledge of South Carolina.

RUTLEDGE 
I believe, sir, with Dr. Franklin, that the debate has lasted too long; but, 
sir, I am hopeful that with only a little more delay we may secure unanimous 
action on the most important question which has ever been before this body. 
With Dr. Franklin's permission, I suggest an amendment, sir, that the 
resolution be laid upon the table until tomorrow morning. [murmurs and 
comments]

HANCOCK 
Does Dr. Franklin accept the amendment?

FRANKLIN 
Mr. President, I have only one desire in this matter, and that is to see this 
body united and of one mind. If in the peace of a quiet July afternoon and the 
tranquillity of a night's rest we can find that bond which will unite us and 
hold us together, I say, yes--I accept Mr. Rutledge's amendment. Let us vote 
upon the Lee Resolution tomorrow morning.

VOICE 
But the first thing tomorrow morning!

FRANKLIN 
Yes--the first thing tomorrow morning. [murmurs of assent]

HANCOCK [sound of gavel] 
You have heard the motion. Are there any further remarks?

ALL 
Question! Question! Question!

HANCOCK 
Those favoring?

ALL 
Aye--aye--aye--

HANCOCK 
Contrary minded?--Carried! [sound of gavel] 

RUTLEDGE 
And now, sir, I move we adjourn until nine o'clock tomorrow morning.

VOICE 
Second!

HANCOCK 
Before putting Mr. Rutledge's motion to adjourn, I wish to caution all the 
members to the greatest secrecy. Whatever the outcome of our deliberation, we 
can only cause harm to ourselves and to our country by divulging what has been 
done here. The motion to adjourn is before the Congress. Those favoring?

ALL 
Aye--aye--aye--

HANCOCK 
Contrary minded?--Carried! [sound of gavel] Congress is adjourned until nine 
o'clock tomorrow morning.

ALL [confusion and noise] 
It can't be done!
It's useless!
We can never get them to vote with us!
We must be united!
We can never unite on independence!
We must bring this thing about!
Will you join me?
We have no power to vote. [etc.]

FRANKLIN 
Oh, Mr. Rutledge--

RUTLEDGE [off] 
Yes, Dr. Franklin?

FRANKLIN 
Please--may I speak to you?

RUTLEDGE [coming in] 
Of course, Doctor--what is it?

FRANKLIN 
Sit down here, my boy.

RUTLEDGE 
Thank you.

FRANKLIN 
Do you think you can swing the South Carolina delegation for independence?

RUTLEDGE 
I don't know, Dr. Franklin, but I've invited them to my lodging to dine with 
me and talk over the question.

FRANKLIN 
Good, good! Often an excellent meal and a taste of fine wine carry more 
conviction than hours of argument. As I see it now, we must swing South 
Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Delaware into line before tomorrow morning.

RUTLEDGE 
Count on me for South Carolina.

FRANKLIN 
And I'll take care of Pennsylvania. I think I'll try your strategy--I'll 
invite the delegation to dinner.

RUTLEDGE 
Then that leaves Delaware.

FRANKLIN 
I wonder if McKeen of Delaware, who favors independence--

RUTLEDGE 
Yes, I know.

FRANKLIN [going on] 
--can't swing Dr. Reed in the same way.

RUTLEDGE 
Perhaps.

FRANKLIN 
Oh, there's McKeen now. Call him over here--will you, Rutledge?

RUTLEDGE 
Of course. [calling] Oh, Mr. McKeen! Mr. McKeen!

MCKEEN [off] 
Yes?

RUTLEDGE 
Come over here a moment--will you, please?

MCKEEN 
Why, certainly. [coming in] Well, Dr. Franklin, we had a stormy session this 
morning.

FRANKLIN 
All that will be forgotten--

MCKEEN 
In victory.

FRANKLIN 
If only we can make our victory complete.

MCKEEN 
True.

FRANKLIN 
What chance is there for Delaware to join us?

MCKEEN 
None, I'm afraid. Dr. Reed and I are the only delegates here--and he is as 
unalterably opposed to independence as I am in favor of it. The vote of 
Delaware won't count.

FRANKLIN 
What about getting another favoring delegate here by tomorrow? Could you do 
that?

MCKEEN 
Well, Doctor, I'm afraid it's out of the question. Caesar Rodney favors the 
resolution, I know, but he's at home in Dover, Delaware.

FRANKLIN 
Send a postrider for him!

MCKEEN 
It's eighty miles.

FRANKLIN 
Well, that's not impossible. We have until nine o'clock tomorrow morning--it's 
now--let's see--just a little after twelve--that's nearly twenty-one hours.

MCKEEN 
But Rodney was very ill when he went home last week.

FRANKLIN 
Perhaps he's better by now. Write him a letter--send it by the postrider--urge 
upon him the enormous importance of his getting here by tomorrow morning.

MCKEEN 
Well, I can try it.

FRANKLIN 
Do, Mr. McKeen, for we must have unanimous action on this question! We must 
hang together on this, or we'll all hang separately!

MCKEEN 
All right, sir, I'll go to the postrider's at once! Good day.

FRANKLIN 
Good day. And let us pray that Rodney gets here!

ANNOUNCER 
So McKeen hurried to the postrider's stable. Now the postrider was to the 
people of Revolutionary days what the telegraph or the telephone is to us 
today. He carried messages at a very rapid rate, for those days, by changing 
horses every ten or fifteen miles.

As McKeen came up to the post stable, he saw the stableman sitting on a bench, 
hard at work cleaning a saddle.

MCKEEN 
Good day, sir.

URIAH 
Day to ye.

MCKEEN 
I want a postrider.

URIAH 
Wal', postriders are all out, sir.

MCKEEN 
Oh, too bad! When do you expect one back?

URIAH 
Dunno fer certain. Mebbe three or four hours--mebbe longer.

MCKEEN 
But look here--I can't wait that long--I want one right away!

URIAH 
I'm right sorry, sir, but thar ain't nawthin' I kin do about et. Come back 
this evenin' and I kin hev a man fer ye, but not before.

MCKEEN 
But, look here, my man--

URIAH 
My name's Uriah Clarke--at yer service.

MCKEEN 
All right, Mr. Clarke, I've got to have a postrider to carry a very important 
message to Dover, Delaware, to get a man back here from Dover by nine o'clock 
tomorrow morning.

URIAH 
Dover, Delaware, and back?

MCKEEN 
Yes, by nine tomorrow morning!

URIAH 
Why, sir, it's nigh onto eighty mile to Delaware.

MCKEEN 
I know it.

URIAH 
Eighty mile thar and eighty mile back--why, pshaw, sir, we couldn't do thet 
under a whole day--even ef we hed a rider to send out right now--which we 
ain't.

MCKEEN 
Twenty-five pounds if you'll do it!

URIAH 
But how kin we? Ain't I jest told ye we ain't got no riders?

MCKEEN 
Why can't you go?

URIAH 
Law, sir, I ain't rode a trip like thet fer years. It 'ud more than likely 
kill me.

MCKEEN 
Fifty pounds if you'll do it!

URIAH 
No, sir!

MCKEEN 
Name your own sum.

URIAH 
Ye couldn't pay me, sir--not fer thet ride. I know thet road like a book--bad, 
slow, hard on hoss flesh when ye take it easy. I'd stave up half my hosses--
not to mention myself, sir, and I hev a mind fer myself, too.

MCKEEN 
Change riders--change your horses oftener--but make it you must!

URIAH 
Not ef 'twas a matter of life and death, sir.

MCKEEN 
It's more than that!

URIAH 
Eh? What? What ye talkin' about?

MCKEEN 
It's a matter of life and death for a nation--our country!

URIAH 
Is et somethin' to do with Congress, sir?

MCKEEN 
It is.

URIAH 
Wal', sir, I'm a Son of Liberty, and et's my sworn duty to go whar I'm wanted 
fer liberty, and ef thet's et--

MCKEEN 
It is.

URIAH 
Then I'll go.

MCKEEN 
I'll pay your price.

URIAH 
Thar won't be no price! I'll git yer man to Philadelphia tomorrow mornin' ef I 
hev to carry him myself. Who's yer man?

MCKEEN 
Caesar Rodney of Dover, Delaware. Here's a letter for him.

URIAH 
Caesar Rodney--I'll fetch him!

MCKEEN 
Good!

URIAH [going] 
Hey, Jim! Throw a saddle on thet bay mare! [orders fade out]

ANNOUNCER 
For our next scene let us look in at the home of Caesar Rodney in Dover, 
Delaware. It is nearly eight o'clock on the evening of July 1, 1776. Rodney, 
pale and drawn, with the languid air of a man but recently out of a sick bed, 
is sitting in an easy chair. Mrs. Rodney is hovering over him with a 
protecting anxiety--

PRUDENCE 
You're sure you feel strong enough to sit up, Caesar?

RODNEY 
Yes, yes, Prudence, I'm all right, I tell you.

PRUDENCE 
You're sure you're not in any pain?

RODNEY 
No, no, dear, I'm all right--just weak, that's all.

PRUDENCE 
Now, Caesar, you just mustn't overtax your strength--remember this is only the 
second day you've been out of bed.

RODNEY 
Yes, dear.

PRUDENCE 
And the physician said you mustn't overdo.

RODNEY 
All right, dear. I wonder what's happening in Philadelphia.

PRUDENCE 
You must get your mind off Congress. You mustn't worry.

RODNEY 
I know, but--what date's today?

PRUDENCE 
July first--why?

RODNEY 
July first. Why, today the Lee Resolution was to come up for final action! Oh, 
I'm sorry I wasn't there!

PRUDENCE 
What's the Lee Resolution?

RODNEY 
It's the most important motion that's come before the Continental Congress in 
the two years Congress has been sitting.

PRUDENCE 
What's it about?

RODNEY 
Independence.

PRUDENCE 
You mean to say they're even considering such a thing?

RODNEY 
Of course. It's the only thing left for us. We've got to declare our 
independence.

PRUDENCE 
Well, I'm mighty glad you weren't there today to vote for it.

RODNEY 
Why?

PRUDENCE 
You'd just have put a rope around your neck.

RODNEY 
My dear, I've done that long ago. [knocking] See who's at the door, dear.

PRUDENCE 
All right. [knocking] Yes, yes, I'm coming. [door opens]

URIAH [off] 
Does Caesar Rodney dwell here?

PRUDENCE 
Yes, what's wanted?

URIAH 
Kin I see him, ma'm?

PRUDENCE 
He's just out of a sick bed and not very strong.

URIAH 
Et's very important, ma'm.

RODNEY [calling] 
Ask him to come in, Prudence.

PRUDENCE 
Well, just a minute--and don't excite him. Right in this way.

URIAH 
Be ye Caesar Rodney?

RODNEY 
Yes.

URIAH 
Here's a letter fer ye.

RODNEY 
A letter--where from?

URIAH 
Philadelphia. I fetched et all the way since noon today.

RODNEY 
Indeed! [sound of tearing paper]

PRUDENCE 
Now, Caesar, do you think you ought to read that?

RODNEY 
Why not?

PRUDENCE 
It might be something exciting--something you oughtn't to read--it might upset 
you--let me read it first!

RODNEY 
Oh, nonsense! [rattle of paper]

PRUDENCE 
I do wish people could leave a sick man alone--always bothering you!

RODNEY 
Quiet! What's this--what's this? They haven't voted on the Lee Resolution yet! 
They need me! Prudence, my riding boots!

PRUDENCE 
Your riding boots! Have you gone crazy, Caesar?

RODNEY 
Don't stand and argue! Please get my boots--there isn't a moment to lose! I've 
got to be in Philadelphia before nine o'clock tomorrow morning!

PRUDENCE 
You can't go! It'll kill you!

RODNEY 
Where's my riding coat? Hurry up--get my boots!

PRUDENCE 
You shan't go--I won't let you!

RODNEY 
I've got to go--I'm needed. If you won't get the boots, I will!

PRUDENCE 
Oh, please, sir, whoever you are--

URIAH 
I'm Uriah Clarke, ma'm--at yer service.

PRUDENCE 
Please, please, don't let him go! He can't stand it--he's too weak. He's been 
terribly ill--the physician told him he must rest--he could never stand a trip 
like that!

URIAH 
But, ma'm, he's got to git thar. And I give my word thet I'd hev him thar 
tomorrow mornin'.

PRUDENCE 
Your word--what's your word to a man's life!

URIAH 
What's a man's life to the life of his country!

RODNEY [coming in] 
All right, I'm ready--let's start!

PRUDENCE 
Caesar!

RODNEY 
Good-bye, Prudence.

PRUDENCE 
If I can't persuade you to give up this mad--

RODNEY 
You can't, my dear--

PRUDENCE 
Good-bye, and God be with you. [door opens]

URIAH 
Here ye be, sir--this is yer hoss.

RODNEY 
You'll have to give me a hand up--I'm a little weak.

URIAH 
All right, sir. [sound of mounting horses] Ready?

RODNEY 
Ready!

URIAH 
Then we're off. [horses' hoofs, Prudence's fading "Good-bye, good-bye!"]

ANNOUNCER 
And so out into the July night rode Caesar Rodney and the postrider, bound for 
Philadelphia eighty miles away--an hour--two hours--past the first remount 
station--it is nearing eleven o'clock. [sound of horses' hoofs and thunder]

RODNEY 
Is that thunder?

URIAH 
Cal'ate thet's what 'tis.

RODNEY 
I hope it doesn't rain.

URIAH 
'Twon't help us none ef et does.

RODNEY 
I don't see how we can ever make it if it starts raining.

URIAH 
We got to make et--rain or no rain. I give my word of honor to Mr. McKeen. Git 
along, boy--tch--tch.

RODNEY 
It's sprinkling.

URIAH 
I felt et. [another peal of thunder closer] [sound of rain and wind]

RODNEY 
I guess it's on us.

URIAH 
Here--draw up yer hoss!

RODNEY 
What for?

URIAH 
Never mind--do what I say! Whoa, boy, whoa! Here, put on my greatcoat!

RODNEY 
Oh, no, no!

URIAH 
Ye need et. Do as I say. Ye been ill, and I ain't a-goin' to hev ye catchin' 
yer death o' cold--here ye be--now put et on.

RODNEY [giving in] 
But--but what will you do--Uriah?

URIAH 
I'm rugged--I don't need et. [exchanging coat]

RODNEY 
Really, you oughtn't to do this.

URIAH 
I'm a-doin' et--thar ye be! [another clap of thunder and storm noises] She's 
a-comin' down now! Come on, follow me! Giddap, boy!

RODNEY 
Giddap! [sound of horses' hoofs]

ANNOUNCER 
And on into the storm they rode. Another hour--another change of horses. It is 
after midnight and they come upon a stretch of good road--

URIAH 
Here we be on the turnpike.

RODNEY 
Is that as far as we've got?

URIAH 
It's nigh onto thirty mile.

RODNEY 
But we've got fifty miles more! Can we make it?

URIAH 
We got to make et. How ye feelin'?

RODNEY 
I guess I'll--hold out.

URIAH 
Then let's step along a mite and make up some of thet time we lost in the 
storm.

RODNEY 
All right. Tch--tch--come along.

URIAH 
Giddap, boy! [beat of horses' hoofs increases] [to himself] Fifty mile. We got 
to make et, boy--we got to make et--come on--tch--tch--come on--and don't ye 
make a misstep.

RODNEY [off a bit] 
Oh--whoa! Ow! [thud of falling body, a groan]

URIAH 
Whoa, boy! Hey! What's the matter? What's happened?

RODNEY [off] 
Quick! Catch the horse--I'm off.

URIAH 
Hey! Whoa, thar--whoa, thar--stand still thar, boy! Thar--I got ye! [calling] 
Where are ye, Mr. Rodney? What happened? Be ye hurt?

RODNEY 
No--I--I guess I'm all right.

URIAH 
How'd he throw ye?

RODNEY [in] 
I don't know--the saddle slipped--then it came clear off and I came with it.

URIAH 
Here--hold the hosses, will ye--let me see thet saddle! Ah-ha!--Girth broken!

RODNEY 
Can you fix it?

URIAH 
Ain't got time.

RODNEY 
I'm afraid I can't--can't keep a seat bareback.

URIAH 
Here--you climb on my hoss--I'll take your'n.

RODNEY 
But--

URIAH 
Not another word--climb aboard, thar. [sound of getting Rodney on horse] All 
right, boy, stand still. Thar we be! Go along with ye!

BOTH 
Tch--tch--giddap! [sound of horses' hoofs]

ANNOUNCER 
And now five miles farther into the next remount station. Rodney and Uriah 
clatter up to the stable and find the stable closed, with everything dark.

URIAH 
Whoa, boy! Hm--cal'ate they've all gone to bed. Wal', we'll fetch 'em out. 
Hold the hosses a minute!

RODNEY 
All right.

URIAH 
I'll git thet lazy stableman out! Here's where he lives. Hey! Wake up! 
[knocking] Wake up--come on out here. [knocking] Come on--we want a pair of 
hosses--wake up thar.

TOM [off] 
Hey--what's goin' on out there? What do ye want?

URIAH 
We want some hosses--come on out. [door opens]

TOM 
Who is et?

URIAH 
Et's Uriah Clarke of Philadelphia.

TOM 
Oh, hello, Uriah. Kinda late fer ye to be out, ain't et?

URIAH 
Oh, hello, Tom. I'm in a big hurry--come on--saddle me a couple of yer best 
hosses!

TOM 
Pshaw now, I'm right put out.

URIAH 
Eh? What the trouble?

TOM 
I let my last hoss go not two hour ago.

URIAH 
Yer last hoss?

TOM 
Yes, sir--my last fresh one.

URIAH 
Wal', we've got to have two hosses. Give us what ye got.

TOM 
There's nothin' in the stable but two hosses thet come in so tuckered out they 
couldn't hardly eat their corn--ye'll hev to go on with the hosses ye got--
less'n ye want to wait until mornin'.

URIAH 
We got to be in Philadelphia by mornin'.

TOM 
Philadelphia? Ye'll never make et.

URIAH 
We got to--I give my word. If ye can't give me a hoss, let me hev a saddle. We 
broke a saddle girth.

TOM 
All right, Uriah--I'll git ye a saddle! Come on--but ye'll never make 
Philadelphia by mornin'! Not with the roads the way they be!

URIAH 
We got to make et.

TOM 
Here--git this door open! [sound of opening door] There's a saddle fer ye.

URIAH 
Come on--give me a hand--git et on this hoss! [sound of putting saddle on]

TOM 
There ye be!

URIAH 
All right, Mr. Rodney. Let me give ye a hand up. How ye feelin'?

RODNEY 
I guess--I'll make it.

URIAH 
Thar! Good-bye, Tom.

TOM 
Good-bye--good luck.

URIAH 
Tch--tch--giddap! [sound of horses' hoofs]

TOM [off--fading] 
I'll bet ye a new hat ye don't make Philadelphia!

URIAH [yelling back] 
I'll bet ye a hat and a new pair o' boots--come on, boy! [sound of horses' 
hoofs]

ANNOUNCER 
And now two hours later Rodney is riding ahead when his horse stops suddenly--

URIAH [calling] 
What's the matter?

RODNEY 
Listen-- [sound of rushing water]

URIAH 
Pshaw now! Thet brook's kinda doin' business, ain't et?

RODNEY 
The storm has turned it into a torrent.

URIAH 
Wal', we got to git across!

RODNEY 
How?

URIAH 
Let the hosses swim!

RODNEY 
All right.

URIAH 
You drive in fu'st! I'll be right behind ye.

RODNEY 
Tch--tch--giddap!

URIAH 
Lean way over his neck--give him his head!

RODNEY 
Tch--tch--get in there, boy! Go on!

URIAH 
What's the matter? Is he skittish of the water?

RODNEY 
Get in there--go on! He won't go in, Uriah.

URIAH 
Here--let me hev the reins. I'll lead him in with my hoss.

RODNEY 
Here you are.

URIAH 
Come on, boy--come on in--'tain't goin' ter hurt ye! Come on--giddap! [sound 
of splashing water--roar of stream rises]

URIAH 
Go on--swim fer et! Go et, boy! Hold on tight, Mr. Rodney! Go et, boy--go et! 
[sound of water recedes a little--we hear horses' hoofs on solid ground]

URIAH 
Wal'! Thar we be! Made et slicker'n a greased griddle! You all right, Mr. 
Rodney?

RODNEY 
I'm still here.

URIAH 
Mite wet?

RODNEY 
I've been dryer.

URIAH 
All right, take yer reins--we'll ride fast to keep warm. You ready?

RODNEY 
All ready.

URIAH 
Tch--tch--giddap! Come on, boy!

ANNOUNCER 
And now two hours later just as the first streaks of dawn begin to brighten 
the eastern sky our two riders are pushing their horses over a piece of rough, 
stony road. Suddenly Uriah pulls up his horse--

URIAH 
Whoa, thar, boy! Ah, you've done et now!

RODNEY [off a little] 
Whoa! What's happened now, Uriah?

URIAH 
Wal', blamed ef I didn't think thet everything had happened to us thet could 
happen!

RODNEY [coming in] 
What's wrong now? Why are you dismounting?

URIAH 
This blamed hoss has pulled up lame.

RODNEY 
Oh, too bad!

URIAH 
Mebbe he's jest got a stone in his shoe--I'll take a look! Here, boy--lift up 
yer foot! Come on--let me look at et! Thar! No, 'tain't a stone.

RODNEY 
Can't he carry you any farther?

URIAH 
No. He can't hardly hobble. I cal'ate ye better go on without me, Mr. Rodney, 
while I lead this hoss into the next remount station.

RODNEY 
I--I'm a little afraid to try it alone.

URIAH 
Oh, ye kin make et all right--the hosses know the road.

RODNEY 
I know--the horses can make it--but I don't know that I can.

URIAH 
Gittin' wore out?

RODNEY 
I'm afraid so.

URIAH 
Wal', ye got to git to Philadelphia--I give my word.

RODNEY 
All right--I'll go on--I'll try to make it.

URIAH 
Look here--et's six or seven mile to the next remount station--I tell ye what 
I'll do--I'll tie this lame hoss here--and thet hoss of your'n will hev to 
carry double thet far!

RODNEY 
I guess that's the best thing.

URIAH 
Let me hev thet stirrup--

RODNEY 
You all ready?

URIAH 
Let him go.

RODNEY 
Tch--tch--giddap! [sound of horses' hoofs]

ANNOUNCER 
And now let us leave the two riders and their heroic effort against enormous 
odds to reach Philadelphia in time to make the decision for independence 
unanimous. Our next scene is on the steps of the State House, the morning of 
July 2, 1776. The hour for assembling Congress is drawing near. Thomas McKeen 
of Delaware is standing on the steps anxiously waiting and watching for Caesar 
Rodney. Dr. Franklin rides up in his carriage and steps out.

MCKEEN 
Good morning, Dr. Franklin.

FRANKLIN 
Good morning, good morning, my boy. Has Rodney come?

MCKEEN 
Not yet. I've been waiting for an hour.

FRANKLIN 
Oh, I hope he gets here.

MCKEEN 
It is a long, hard ride.

FRANKLIN 
This morning our action must be unanimous and final! One dissenting colony and 
we'll be defeated!

MCKEEN 
How is it with Pennsylvania?

FRANKLIN 
I was able to persuade Dickinson and Morris--we can count on Pennsylvania.

MCKEEN 
You must have given them a good dinner, Doctor.

FRANKLIN 
And good advice. [chuckles] Oh, here comes Rutledge.

MCKEEN 
I hope he's convinced his colleagues from South Carolina.

FRANKLIN 
Good morning, Mr. Rutledge.

RUTLEDGE 
Good morning, Doctor--good morning, McKeen.

FRANKLIN 
I trust, Mr. Rutledge, your dinner of last evening was as productive of good 
results as mine.

RUTLEDGE 
You can count on South Carolina.

FRANKLIN 
Great news, sir!

MCKEEN 
Good!

RUTLEDGE 
The members are beginning to assemble.

ALL [growing from one voice to many] 
Good morning.
How do you do, Doctor?
Good morning, Mr. McKeen.
What news this morning?
Has Rodney come?
How will Pennsylvania vote, Doctor?
Good morning, Mr. Hancock.
Good morning, Dr. Franklin. A fine day, isn't it?
How is it with New Hampshire?
New Hampshire is unanimous, sir.
Good morning, gentlemen.
The hour of assembling is nearly here.
Shall we go in, gentlemen?
How do you do, Dr. Franklin?
Has New York been heard from?
Can we swing Delaware, Mr. McKeen?
Well, it's nearly nine o'clock.
There's no question about it, Mr. Livingston.
No, no, I don't believe we can go so far.
Yes, but we have no alternative. [etc.]
[this thins out but does not stop entirely]

VOICE [calling] 
Come on, gentlemen, we must go in! It's nine o'clock. The session will open in 
a moment.

MCKEEN 
Doctor, ask the members to delay--hold them a few minutes--don't let a quorum 
assemble.

FRANKLIN 
Yes, yes! [louder] Gentlemen, just a moment.

ALL 
Yes, Doctor, what is it?
What do you want, Dr. Franklin? [etc.]

FRANKLIN 
Wait--wait a moment--don't go in just yet--come--do you mind standing here 
with us--no--perhaps--Mr. Adams, take several members and go up Market Street!

VOICE 
Yes, certainly, Doctor--why?

FRANKLIN 
Don't ask me why! We must delay the opening of the meeting. Come back in a 
quarter of an hour!

VOICE 
Of course, sir.

FRANKLIN 
And Livingston, keep the members here on the steps in conversation--don't let 
them go in.

VOICE 
Certainly, Doctor.

FRANKLIN 
Oh, Jefferson, you are always too prompt! My boy, be late this morning--stroll 
about the Square! Take some of your friends with you--sh--don't ask me why--I 
might incriminate myself! It's a beautiful morning for a stroll--you need the 
air, my boy--you need-- [sound of horses' hoofs off, growing louder]

MCKEEN 
Oh, Doctor, look!

FRANKLIN 
Eh? What?

MCKEEN 
Two horsemen coming up Market Street!

FRANKLIN 
Is it by any chance--

MCKEEN 
Yes, yes, it's Rodney--Rodney and the postrider--they're coming!

FRANKLIN 
Good, good! This is a glorious day!

ALL 
Here comes Rodney of Delaware!
Good! That swings Delaware into line!
It looks like unanimous action!
Rodney, Rodney--good work!
[horses' hoofs close, and stop]

URIAH [calling] 
Wal', here we be, Mr. McKeen.

MCKEEN 
Good! You're just in time!

RODNEY 
They haven't voted yet?

MCKEEN 
No, no, the session is just assembling. Come, dismount!

RODNEY 
You'll have to give me a hand.

URIAH 
Here--I'll help ye. [sound of dismounting]

RODNEY 
I--I can hardly stand.

FRANKLIN 
Here, Rodney, take my arm--I seldom have a chance to support young and 
vigorous men now, but I insist on this!

RODNEY 
Thank you, Doctor.

FRANKLIN 
Come--let me lead you in a triumphant entry!

RODNEY 
I'm glad I got here in time.

FRANKLIN 
My congratulations, Rodney--you've ridden to a great victory! Before another 
hour is passed a new nation will be born! [members cheer]

MCKEEN 
Mr. Clarke, I want to thank you. I was almost afraid you wouldn't get him here 
in time.

URIAH 
Why, pshaw, Mr. McKeen, I give ye my word, didn't I? I had to git him here!

ANNOUNCER 
And so Rodney, with his mud-spattered clothes, booted and spurred as he had 
ridden, went into the meeting of Congress and secured the adherence of 
Delaware to the Lee Resolution. When Congress was called to order and the vote 
taken, every Colony voted for independence, and, as New York did not vote at 
all, there was not a dissenting voice in the victory!
