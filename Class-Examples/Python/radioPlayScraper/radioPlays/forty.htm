<u>NOTE TO ANNOUNCER</u>: There will now be a brief pause in the Forty

                   This is WJZ, New York City.

<u>STATION ANNOUNCER</u> (THROUGH MUSIC) 
          Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we invite you on 
behalf of the Bay State Fishing Company, to tune on the program 
of the Forty Fathom Trawlers and share their sea adventures in 
song and story. 

<u>OPENING ANNOUNCEMENT</u>: (GRAHAM McNAMEE) 
          Ahoy there, ladies and gentlemen! This is Graham 
McNamee speaking for the Forty Fathom Trawlers - from the deck 
of the trawler "Spray", flagship of the Forty Fathom fleet. 

          We're homeward bound - coming up to Boston Harbor with 
Old Forty Fathom himself - sometimes known as Captain Bill Haft - 
in command. Captain Haft is a veteran skipper in the Forty Fathom 
service - one of the oldest and best. 

          Most of the boys in the crew are up here on deck now as 
the "Spray" slips on her way through the long, even swell of the 
sea. There's a peculiar feeling of anticipation in the air and it 
occurs to me that the explanation may easily be found down in the 
hold of the "Spray." That's where Captain Haft and his men have got 
a record catch of Forty Fathom Fish stored away on beds of ice. 
(MURMURS OF APPLAUSE FROM CREW) 

          At least we estimate this catch at somewhere mighty near 
a record and we know this landing of the "Spray" will be a special 
event. 

[2]
Homeward bound! I don't suppose it is possible to feel the 
romance of that phrase anywhere but on a ship. It means a great 
deal to these deep-sea fisherman, I can tell you. And here's Mr. 
Sam Spriggs, the radio operator, with his hands full of messages. 
What's up, Sam? 

SPRIGGS: Here's a message for you, Mr. McNamee. 

McNAMEE: Say, I'll bet that's from the office - I was afraid 
         they'd have something to say about my running away on 
         this trip. Let's have it, Sam. 

SPRIGGS: Here you are, Mr. McNamee. 

McNAMEE: Thank you, Hmm. Say, this is great! Just wait till we 
         get in, Sam, and I'll tell you all about it. 

SPRIGGS: Well, you see I know what it is already, Mr. McNamee - 
         I took it down. 

McNAMEE: Oh, of course. What do you think of it? 

SPRIGGS: We'll have a great celebration. 

McNAMEE: Then let's start it right now! How about a song from 
         the boys? 

SPRIGGS: Good! Let's have a song, boys!

(<u>SEA SONG _ QUARTETTE</u>) 

McNAMEE: Good work, fellows! Say! Where's young Peter Pillbeam? 

PETER:   (off) Right here, Mr. McNamee! 

McNAMEE: I wondered what had become of you, Peter. 

PETER:   I was down in the galley talking to Alfred the cook. 

McNAMEE: Down in the galley, eh? That's the most popular place 
         on this ship! 

PETER:   It is with me, all right. But say - what do you think? 
         Alfred's got a great big - - 

SPRIGGS: Never mind about that, Peter! There's a time for 
         everything, you know. 

[3]

PETER:   All right, Cousin Sam. 

McNAMEE: Wait a minute, boys - the fellows are going to sing 
         again. And after that I've got an important announcement 
         to make to you all. Let's go, boys!

(<u>SEA _ QUARTETTE</u>) 

McNAMEE: One good song deserves another, doesn't it? 

SPRIGGS: But what's your announcement, Mr. McNamee? 

McNAMEE: It's a brief one - but I know you'll all be interested. 
         Fellows, I've just had a radiogram from the office - they 
         tell me that special arrangements have been made to send 
         out a radio description of the scene as we land with the 
         "Spray" and her cargo at the Bay State Fishing Company's 
         pier in Boston Harbor. (Applause) And here's the reason - 
         this trip marks the 20th year of service by Captain Bill 
         Haft as a Forty Fathom skipper! (Applause) And thanks to 
         your efforts, it looks like he'll bring a record catch 
         to make the day a really memorable one! (Applause) Here's 
         my suggestion - oh, Clate!

VOICE:   Hello!

McNAMEE: Is the ship's band ready? 

VOICE:   Ay, ay sir! 

McNAMEE: Well then, when Old Forty Fathom comes on deck strike up 
         a march!

VOICE:   Right! We'll do it! 

McNAMEE: And here he comes! Old Forty Fathom!

FEW BARS OF STARS AND STRIPES FOREVER _ ORCHESTRA 

CHEERS _ _ 

CAPT. HAFT: What's the meaning o' this demonstration, lads? 

[4]

McNAMEE: That's the first part of a birthday celebration, Captain. 

CAPT. HAFT: Birthday? Whose birthday? 

McNAMEE: Well Captain it's yours, if you must know. 

CAPT. HAFT: I don't think I understand ye, Mr. McNamee. 

McNAMEE: Captain Haft, this trip rounds out your 20th year as a 
         Forty Fathom skipper. You didn't think we'd let that 
         go by without taking some notice of it, did you? 

CAPT. HAFT: That's kind of you, but I see no reason for makin' 
            a fuss over me - - I've worked hard, and tried to do 
            my duty, that's all. (APPLAUSE) 

McNAMEE: Well, you wait a bit, Captain Haft, and see what 
         happens. Oh, Jim!

VOICE:   Here I am! 

McNAMEE: Suppose we have a song for Captain Haft. 

VOICE:   All right! You know the one, boys. 

(<u>SEA SONG _ QUARTETTE</u>) 

CAPT. HAFT: Thank you, men. I appreciate your singing. 

McNAMEE: I'm sure you're welcome, Captain. I'm sure of that. 
         And if you'll come up to your cabin with me, I'd like 
         to have a little talk with you before we get in. 

CAPT. HAFT: Why, certainly, Mr. McNamee. 

McNAMEE: All right, let's go up. So long, boys. 

ALL: So long, Mr. McNamee, etc.

SPRIGGS: Well, Peter, how do you like the excitement? 

PETER:   It's great, Cousin Spriggs. Say - what's that ship over 
         there - she's flying the same house-flag that we've got. 

SPRIGGS: Let's see - oh, yes (WHISTLE OFF) Hear her whistling to 
         us? That's another Forty Fathom Trawler - the "Breeze" 
         (WHISTLE ON MIKE) Now we answer her - that's the way 
         ships say "hello." 

[5]

PETER:   There's another one on the other side Cousin Spriggs. 
         What might she be? 

SPRIGGS: That's the trawler "White Cap." She's another of the 
         Forty Fathom Fleet. (WHISTLE OFF) There goes her whistle - 
         and we answer - (WHISTLE ON MIKE) I've been talking to 
         them both this morning with my radio. 

PETER:   They ought to get in about when we do, won't they, 
         cousin Spriggs? 

SPRIGGS: I suppose they will - just about. What do you think, 
         Alfred? 

ALFRED:  I don't know, Mr. Spriggs. 

PETER:   Alfred! You came up so quietly I didn't hear you. Say, 
         Alfred, I was down in your galley just a little while ago, 
         and I saw a great big - - 

ALFRED:  Be quiet, Peter - it's not time to 'ave that spoken 
         about. 

PETER:   All right, but I think you and Cousin Spriggs are acting 
         awful mysterious around this trawler. 

SPRIGGS: Well, we've reason to, Peter. And I'll let you in on the 
         secret - it's about our first mate, Mr. Joseph Billings. 

PETER:   About Mr. Billings! Well, I thought so, whatever it is. 

ALFRED:  Yes, you've 'ad a message about 'im on your wireless, 
         'aven't you, Sam? 

SPRIGGS: I sure have, and I'll tell you right now what was in it! 
         Billings is not what he claims to be!

PETER:   Oh, how's that, Cousin Spriggs? 

SPRIGGS: His name isn't Billings, that's what. 

ALFRED:  Then what is he, really? 

SPRIGGS: We'll find that out, soon enough. I've a friend on shore 
         who's been making a few investigations, and I expect a 
         report from him before long. 

[6]

PETER:    Gee! This is exciting, Alfred.

ALFRED:   Per'aps it may be, my boy. You keep a close tongue in 
          you 'ead and you'll come to no 'arm. 

PETER:    All right, Alfred. Look! There he comes - say, he's 
          looking pleased!

BILLINGS: Hello, men.
 
ALFRED:   'Ow d'you do, Mr. Billings.
 
BILLINGS: Quite well, thanks. Oh, say, Spriggs! 

SPRIGGS:  Yes? 

BILLINGS: Get any radio messages for me this morning? 

SPRIGGS:  No - not a one. 

BILLINGS: Hmm. Sure about that? 

SPRIGGS:  Why, certainly. Come up to my room and look over the 
          duplicates, if you like. 

BILLINGS: Oh, I already have. 

SPRIGGS:  What? See here, Billings, you've no right to go prying 
          about the wireless room without my permission. 

BILLINGS: No? Well, it's done now, and no help for it. (GOING 
          AWAY) Let me know if anything comes for me, will you? 

ALFRED:   Good 'eavens, Sam! Do you think 'e saw the message 
          about 'im? 

SPRIGGS:  It didn't do him much good if it did. Except - oh hang 
          it all! 

PETER:    What's the matter? 

SPRIGGS:  Now he's on guard! We'll have to be careful. 

ALFRED:   We will, no fear. 'Ello - we're well down the 'arbor, 
          lads - the pier's in sight! 

SPRIGGS:  So we are - we'll be in any minute now - and here's 
          Captain Haft with Mr. McNamee!

[7] 

CAPT. HAFT: Get ready to make landing, men! 

VOICES:   Ay, ay! 

BILLINGS: Jim! Tom! Ready with the bow lines!

VOICES:   Ay, ay! (RUNNING FEET) 

McNAMEE:  What's all that over on the pier, Sam? 

SPRIGGS:  Looks like they've got it all decorated, Mr. McNamee. 

McNAMEE:  (laughs) You know they have, Sam. For Old Forty Fathom's 
          twentieth birthday on the "Spray" and a record catch in 
          her hold! (APPLAUSE) I wish the members of our audience 
          could see these boys on the "Spray". Every one of 'em 
          has a grin a yard wide! (LAUGHTER) We're up close on 
          the pier now, and we ought to land in just a second. 

CAPT. HAFT: Half speed! (SIGNAL BELL ENGINE DIM IN) 

McNAMEE:  Now we're coming up alongside. (CHEERS OFF) Can you 
          hear the cheers of the men from the other trawlers who 
          are gathered on the pier. Let's see - I recognize a few 
          of these other ships here - (WHISTLES OFF) _ and I guess 
          you can hear them saluting the old "Spray." (WHISTLE ON 
          MIKE) Here's her answering hail! A long blast of the 
          whistle.

CAPT. HAFT: Easy there! Bring her along easy! Hard astern! 

(SIGNAL BELL) 

(SPLASHING AS PROPELLOR REVERSES) 

BILLINGS: Get those lines out, there! 

VOICES:   Ay, ay - easy, Bill! (CHEERS OFF) 

CAPT. HAFT: There she lands - make ready with the conveyors, men! 

McNAMEE:  Just a minute, Captain - ready, boys! Let's have it! 

(MARCH ORCHESTRA - CONVEYOR EFFECT IN) 

[8]

McNAMEE: That was the ship's band of the "Spray" serenading old 
         Forty Fathom and the men of the Forty Fathom Trawlers 
         "White Cap," "Breeze", "Ocean," "Foam" and "Billow." 
         We're moored to the Bay State Fishing Company Pier in 
         Boston Harbor and engaged in putting ashore what is esti- 
         mated as a record catch of Forty Fathom Fish. (CHEERS) By 
         the way, Sam, how much would that be? 

SPRIGGS: Can't tell you exactly, but it would have to be over 
         450,000 pounds, Mr. McNamee. 

McNAMEE: Did you hear that? Four hundred and fifty thousand 
         pounds of Forty Fish out of the cold depths of the 
         ocean! You can hear the conveyors working as the great 
         baskets of fish are swung on to the pier - the scales 
         are near at hand there and the weight of the catch is 
         being recorded. Say, I'm glad I'm on deck this time 
         instead of on the pier - because down there the air seems 
         to be full of baskets of fish and you have to have 
         eyes in the back of your head to keep from being knocked 
         over. At least that is the way I found it. (LAUGHTER) 
         Captain Haft has brought this ship home safely and in 
         so doing has concluded his 20th year as a trawler master 
         for Forty Fathom Fish. That's why the pier is decorated 
         and crowded with friends and well-wishers who are at 
         present waiting for the weight of the catch to be 
         announced. What's that? 

SPRIGGS: The man says they've tallied 400,000 pounds - already. 

McNAMEE: What'd I tell you - 400,000 pounds - come on, Forty 
         Fathom - - got any more down in the hold? 

[9] 

SPRIGGS: They're not unloaded yet! Say, Mr. McNamee, here are some 
         messages from a few of the other trawlers in the fleet. 
         Maybe you'd like to read them. 

McNAMEE: Yes, let's have 'em. This one says - "Heartiest congra- 
         tulations to Captain Bill Haft on his 20th birthday with 
         the company" - from the Trawler "Crest". (CHEERS) Here's 
         another: "Congratulations - the fish send regards" from 
         the Trawler "SURF". (APPLAUSE) Here's one from the Cap- 
         tain and Crew of the trawler "Gale" - "Here's to Captain 
         Bill Haft and the boys on the "Spray". (APPLAUSE) Say, 
         how do you like this - "Come on Bill - give us a record 
         to shoot at!" - from the trawler "Wave." (CHEERS) 

SPRIGGS: Look, Mr. McNamee! 

McNAMEE: Say, what's that! Have they made it? What did he say, 
         Sam? 

SPRIGGS: I'll run down and see. 

McNAMEE: It's a tough job even equaling these fishing records - 
         say, I hope the boys pulled it off for Captain Haft's 
         sake, though. What'd he say, Sam? What? Fine! They've 
         broken the record! (CHEERS) More than 450,000 pounds 
         and not all unloaded yet! I knew they wouldn't let the 
         old Captain down! And here he is! (CHEERS) Oh, Forty 
         Fathom! Forty Fathom! 

CAPT. HAFT: Yes? 

McNAMEE: Just say a few words over the microphone, will you, 
         Captain? 

CAPT. HAFT: Why, surely, if it'll help ye any, Mr. McNamee. 

McNAMEE: It certainly will - ladies and gentlemen, the skipper of 
         this record-breaking trawler is going to speak to you, 
         I don't think there's any further introduction necessary - 

[10] 

         CAPTAIN BILL HAFT - - -

CAPT. HAFT: My friends, I wish to thank ye all for your kind inte- 
            rest. As to records, I wish to say this; the men in 
            the crew of the "Spray" should receive the credit for 
            that. I also wish to say that the masters and crews of 
            the seventeen other Forty Fathom Trawlers in our fleet 
            are quite able to equal or break the record we've been 
            fortunate enough to establish. I take this opportunity 
            of wishing them good luck. I thank you. 

(APPLAUSE) 

McNAMEE: You're very modest, Captain. 

CAPTAIN HAFT: Well, Mr. McNamee, I've followed the sea for a good 
         many years, if that's what you mean. 

McNAMEE: All right, Forty Fathom - just look around, an you'll 
         see what we think of you. All right, Alfred! 

ALFRED:  And 'ere's the birthday cake with 20 candles as I've 
         made myself and kept 'idden in my galley (CHEERS) 

McNAMEE: Oh Jim! See if you and Clate can coax another song out 
         of the boys. 

VOICE:   That's easy - start it up, Jim. 

(<u>SEA SONG - QUARTETTE</u>) 

McNAMEE: And now I have another suggestion - a good rousing sea 
         yarn from Captain Haft himself. 

(ALL:    Give us a yarn, Captain! Let's have a story, Forty 
         Fathom, etc.) 

McNAMEE: You see all these young fellows here from the other 
         trawlers - and our own Peter Pillbeam right here beside 
         me - come on, Forty Fathom, give 'em an old time yarn! 

[11]

CAPT.HAFT: Well, men if you want to hear from me, I'll be glad to 
           oblige. 

ALL:       Sure! Go ahead, etc. 

CAPT.HAFT: Then I'll tell ye an adventure of my own. It happened 
           when I was only a little older than Peter here. 

PETER:     And where did it happen, Captain? 

CAPT.HAFT: In the great icy wastes of the Arctic, my boy - far, far 
           to the North. 

PETER:     I'd like to be hearing more o' that, Captain. 

CAPT.HAFT: Then you shall. You shall hear how a tribe of Esqui- 
           maux rescued a party of white men. 

PETER:     Esquimaux! 

CAPT:      Yes, lad, and strange people they are, living in their 
           ice-block houses and eating seal blubber and walrus meat. 
           Well, this is my story: we were far north on a trading 
           trip and the ice was getting thicker every day when one 
           morning we ran into a blanket of fog ice and the wind 
           started to blow half a gale. 

PETER:     Fog ice? 

CAPT:      Well, Peter, you've seen regular fog, but this was the 
           frozen kind, millions of sharp particles as sharp as 
           needles and thick as a closely knit veil. Facing that 
           icy blast was like having thousands of tiny knives 
           driven into your skin - (WIND EFFECT) - the men could 
           hardly take in sail aloft, they suffered such agony. 
           The ship began to roll and grind in the ice, and things 
           looked bad for us all. I had been stationed for'rd 
           and was trying my best to protect my eyes when suddenly 
           a vague dark mass loomed up ahead. (CONT. ON NEXT PAGE) 

[12]

           Then a terrible crash (CRASH) sounded above the noise 
           of the storm and our good vessel shivered from stem to 
           stern. I knew what had happened when our captain rushed 
           on his bridge and shouted. 

CAPTAIN:   Iceberg! We've hit a 'berg! Every man on deck! Helm 
           hard down! (CRASH) 

MATE:      There she carries away the foremast, Captain! 

CAPTAIN:   She's looming above us - it's a mountain of ice, men! 
           (RUNNING FEET) 

MATE:      We're stove in, Captain! The fo'c'sle's flooding! 

CAPTAIN:   Man the boats! Swing them out! 

MATE:      There's no water, Captain! I can see ice all round us 
           under the fog! 

CAPTAIN:   We're jammed in a pack! (CREAKING NOISE) 

MATE:      She's settling in spite of it! 

CAPTAIN:   So she is! Stand by to abandon ship! 

(VOICES:   Ay, ay, sir! (CONFUSION) 

CAPTAIN:   Load that sledge with grub, men! Over the side with it!
           We'll take to the ice!

MATE:      Easy with the sled, there! 

1stSEAMAN: Easy she goes! 

CAPTAIN:   Get your fur boots and heavy clothes, men! We'll have 
           to tramp for it.
 
2ndSEAMAN: I think there's land to leeward, sir. 

CAPTAIN:   I believe you're right! We'll try it! 

MATE:      Hoist away! Over she goes! (CREAKING OF TACKLE) 

CAPTAIN:   Over you go, men! We couldn't last one night here on 
           deck! 

MATE:      She's half full of water, anyway, Captain - There's no 
           saving her now. 

[13] 

CAPTAIN:   All right, Mate - get to the ice. 

MATE:      (Going off) You're coming too, Captain? 

CAPTAIN:   Yes, in a minute - here, take this compass and strap it 
           to the sledge. 

MATE:      (off) Ay, sir. 

CAPTAIN:   Good-bye old ship - I hate to leave you in this grinding 
           stuff, but there's no help for it. (CRASH) 

MATE:      (shouting off) The mainmast's away! Come on, Captain!

CAPTAIN:   (going off) Ay. Here I come down, Mate. Give me your 
           hand!

MATE:      (at mike) You're just in time, Captain - Where away? 

(Grunting and squeaking of pig) 

CAPTAIN:   By heaven! That's Neb the pig - we've forgotten him! 
           Catch him, some one! We may need his carcass! 

1stSEAMAN: I'll eat my boots first, Captain. He's near human, that 
           pig! (GRUNTING) 

MATE:      There Harvey gets him down! 

CAPTAIN:   Forward, men! He'll follow us!

(SOUND OF SLED PUSHED OVER ICE) 

2ndSEAMAN: Captain! I can't see! This frozen fog has blinded 
           me! 

CAPTAIN:   Push on - hold to the back of the sled. 

MATE:      There the fog lifts, Captain! It's coming off wicked 
           cold, men. Push ahead, there!

1stSEAMAN: Land, land!

2ndSEAMAN: It's mirage, men - we'll never make it! (HUSKILY) My 
           lungs is frosted - I'm for turning back! 

1stSEAMAN: I'd rather die out here than on the ship - push on! 

[14]

MATE:      It's zero or worse, Captain! We'd better turn back 
           before our hands drop off!

CAPTAIN:   Push along there, men. (GRUNTING) The pig's sticking 
           to it! Hear him grunt! (GRUNTING) 

2ndSEAMAN: I'm for giving up - no use.

CAPTAIN:   Make your own choice, men. As for me, I'll go on. 
           There's land ahead. There the ice piles up in front 
           of us. 

MATE:      But there's open water beyond it - we're doomed men! 

1stSEAMAN: I'm choking!

2ndSEAMAN: My face is freezing! God help us! 

CAPTAIN:   There's something moving out there. Bears on the ice, 
           most likely. 

2ndSEAMAN: I can't go on, Captain. Leave me here, I'm sleepy. 
           Save yourselves. 

CAPTAIN:   That man's freezing to death! Don't let him go to sleep, 
           He'll never wake up if he does!

MATE:      What'll we do? 

CAPTAIN:   Slap him in the face. (SLAP) That's right! 

1stSEAMAN: Harvey! Wake up! Wake up!

2ndSEAMAN: Le' me sleep, mates. (SLAP) Hey! Don' do that! 

CAPTAIN:   Load him on the sled, men. Keep shaking him. 

1stSEAMAN: Here you go, Harvey. We won't leave you. 

MATE:      What's that coming toward us? 

1stSEAMAN: Esquimaux!

MATE:      Your bears are two-legged, Captain. But look at their 
           long spears! What are they going to do to us? 

CAPTAIN:   Get round the sled, men. I've got my pistol. If they 
           attack, we'll sell our lives dearly.

           (MUTTERING OF MEN GRUNTS FROM PIG) They may be a friendly 
           tribe - and they may not be. (CALLS) Hello! Hello!
           We want to get to land!

ESQUIMAU CHIEF: (CALLING) Nuteskin! Nuteskin! 

MATE:      There he points back - they must mean "land!" 

CHIEF:     Woneoose! Woneoose! Woneoose! 

CAPTAIN:   (CALLING) Come over! Come over! Courage Harvey, these 
           natives are friends - look at them running over that ice 
           jam! Here they are and smiling! Thank Heaven you were 
           in time, Chief! (SQUEALING AND GRUNTING) Do not hurt that 
           pig - he's going to live if we do. 

CHIEF:     Relinute! Relinute! 

MATH:      See, he points at the ice! 

CHIEF:     Nuteskin! Nuteskin!

MATE:      See where he points! He means <u>land</u>!

CAPTAIN:   I understand him, men - - they're going to take us over 
           the ice to the land! We are saved! (WEAK CHEER) 

(PAUSE) 

PETER:     Gee, Captain - I think the pig deserved a lot of credit, 
           too! (LAUGHTER) 

CAPT.HAFT: Yes, Peter, he was a courageous animal and became a 
           great favorite with our rescuers. Those children of the 
           North took us in, shared their food and shelter with us, 
           and their medicine man frightened poor Harvey into getting 
           well. And in the Spring we were able to make our way 
           overland to a seaport. But we never forgot that day on 
           the ice, or our good Esquimaux friends.

<u>CLOSING ANNOUNCEMENT</u>: 

          You have been listening to another sea-goin' adventure 
of the 40-Fathom Trawlers, broadcast in the interests of 40-Fathom 
Fish each Wednesday at this hour. 

          Day and night the great fleet of 40-Fathom Trawlers bring
these delicious fish from the cold depths of the ocean. Cleaned 
and stowed in ice on the trawlers, the catch speeds to the 40-Fathom 
plant in Boston, where the fish is freed from bones and waste, 
leaving only the snowy sides of tender, white fish meat. These 40-
Fathom Fish are wrapped in pure parchment paper, packed in ice and 
hurried off to your dealer by fast express. 

          You buy 40-Fathom Fish in the same fresh, native cold 
condition in which it came from the depths of the sea. Always fresh - 
never frozen - as easy to cook as bacon and without a shred of 
waste. Just drop it out of the wrapper into the pan, and in eight 
or ten minutes your family can enjoy a genuine shore dinner at 
home. 

          40-Fathom Fish is a cool nourishing summer food, ideal 
for those who wish to reduce. 

          East, West, North, South - from the Atlantic seaboard to 
the Western plains, - ten thousand good meat and fish dealers sell 
40-Fathom Fish. If your dealer hasn't it, ask him to write direct 
to 40-Fathom Fish, Boston. 

          The 40-Fathom recipe booklet prepared by the chef of the 
Ritz-Carlton Hotel in New York gives the private recipes which that 
famous hostelry uses in serving 40-Fathom Fish. For your copy, just 
send a card to Old 40-Fathom, care of this station. 

          Remember not all fish in wrappers is 40-Fathom Fish. For 
your protection, look for Old 40-Fathom and the Big Blue Forty on 
the wrapper.                              FFjr/MEH - 7/24/29
