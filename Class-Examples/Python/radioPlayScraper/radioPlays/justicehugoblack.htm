Justice Hugo Black
Oct 01 1937



ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, we are speaking to you from the residence of 
Claude E. Hamilton, Jr. in Washington, D. C., where, on this occasion, the 
Honorable Hugo L. Black, Justice of the United States Supreme Court, is about 
to address an entire nation. 

On August 12th, 1937, President Roosevelt appointed the senior senator from 
Alabama Associate Justice of the Supreme Court to fill the vacancy created by 
the resignation of Justice Willis Van Devanter.

After a brief but spirited debate, the Senate confirmed the appointment and on 
August 17th Senator Black took the oath of his new office. Justice Black was 
in London on September 13th when the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette published the 
first of a series of articles purporting his alleged affiliation with the Ku 
Klux Klan. Pressed for a reply to these allegations, Justice Black adamantly 
refused to comment in any way on his part in this Number One story of the 
nation.

On September 20th, however, he sailed from England and arrived in Norfolk, 
Virginia, Wednesday. Up to the present moment, the contents of Justice Black's 
first statement have not been divulged, even to the broadcasting companies 
which are carrying his speech. 

The next voice you will hear will be that of the Honorable Hugo L. Black, 
Justice of the United States Supreme Court.

SOUND: PAUSE WHILE ANOTHER NETWORK ANNOUNCER FINISHES HIS INTRODUCTION OFF-
MIKE.

BLACK: Ladies and gentlemen:

The Constitution is the supreme law of our country. The Bill of Rights is the 
heart of the Constitution.

The constitutional safeguard to complete liberty of religious belief is a 
declaration of the greatest importance to the future of America as a nation of 
free people. Any movement or action by any group that threatens to bring about 
a result inconsistent with this unrestricted individual right is a menace to 
freedom.

Let me repeat:

Any program, even if directed by good intention, which tends to breed or 
revive religious discord or antagonism can and may spread with such rapidity 
as to imperil this vital constitutional protection of one of the most sacred 
of human rights.

I believe that no ordinary maneuver executed for political advantage would 
justify a member of the Supreme Court in publicly discussing it. If, however, 
that maneuver threatens the existing peace and harmony between religious or 
racial groups in our country, the occasion is not an ordinary one. It is 
<u>extra</u>ordinary.

During my recent absence on a short vacation abroad, a planned and concerted 
campaign was begun which fans the flames of prejudice and is calculated to 
create racial and religious hatred. If continued, the inevitable result will 
be the projection of religious beliefs into a position of prime importance in 
political campaigns and to reinfect our social and business life with the 
poison of religious bigotry. It will bring the political religionist back into 
undeserved and perilous influence in affairs of government. It will elevate 
the least worthy to political positions because religion or race bars others 
from a password. It will resurrect practices and arguments from which this 
country suffered sorely in the Nineteen Twenties. It will revive the spirit 
which, in 1928, caused a national campaign to be waged largely upon issues 
unworthy of a free people. It will bankrupt many business men whose sole 
offense is that they have religious beliefs which do not accord with the 
prevailing religion in their communities. It will punish the professional man 
whose patients and clients boycott him, not because of lack of professional 
ability, but because there are in his locality few members of his faith or his 
race. It will again set neighbor against neighbor and turn old friends into 
new enemies.

To contribute my part in averting such a catastrophe in this land dedicated to 
tolerance and freedom, I break with precedents of the past to talk with you 
tonight.

An effort is being made to convince the people of America that I am 
intolerant, and that I am prejudiced against people of the Jewish and Catholic 
faiths, and against members of the negro race. These insinuations are advanced 
despite the fact that, for the last eleven years, I have served in the Senate 
of the United States under constant and microscopic public scrutiny.

My words and acts are a matter of public record. I believe that my record as a 
senator refutes every implication of racial or religious intolerance. It shows 
that I was of that group of liberal senators who have consistently fought for 
the civil, economic and religious rights of <u>all</u> Americans, without regard to 
race or creed.

The insinuations of racial and religious intolerance made concerning me are 
based on the fact that I joined the Ku Klux Klan about fifteen years ago. I 
<u>did</u> join the Klan. I later resigned. I never rejoined. What appeared then, or 
what appears now, on the records of the organization, I do not know.

I never have considered and I do not now consider the unsolicited card given 
to me shortly after my nomination to the Senate as a membership of any kind in 
the Ku Klux Klan. I never used it. I did not even keep it.

Before becoming a senator I dropped the Klan. I have had nothing whatever to 
do with it since that time. I abandoned it. I completely discontinued any 
association with the organization. I have never resumed it and never expect to 
do so.

At no meeting of any organization, social, political or fraternal, have I ever 
indicated the slightest departure from my steadfast faith in the unfettered 
right of every American to follow his conscience in matters of religion. I 
have no sympathy with any organization or group which, anywhere or at any 
time, arrogates to itself the un-American power to interfere in the slightest 
degree with complete religious freedom. No words have ever been or will ever 
be spoken by me, directly or indirectly, indicating that any native or 
foreign-born person in our free country should or could be restricted in his 
right to worship according to the dictates of his conscience. I have supported 
candidates for public office without regard to their faith. In my endorsement 
of applicants for governmental positions, I have acted without discrimination 
of any kind or character.

I number among my friends many members of the colored race. I have watched the 
progress of its members with sympathy and admiration. Certainly they are 
entitled to the full measure of protection accorded to the citizenship of our 
country by our Constitution and our laws.

Some of my best and most intimate friends are Catholics and Jews. Shortly 
after I moved to Birmingham, more than a quarter of a century ago, I formed 
one of the most valued friendships of my life with a son of Jewish faith. He 
was one of my closest associates and strongest political supporters. Months of 
our lives were spent together, much of the time in his home. He stood so 
nearly in the place of a father to me that while in the army in 1918 I 
designated this trusted Jewish friend as sole executor of my will. In my 
campaigns for public office his counsel and assistance were always mine. His 
widow who was a guest in my home at the recent inauguration of President 
Roosevelt was one of the first to congratulate me upon my nomination to be a 
Justice of the Supreme Court.

When this statement is ended, my discussion of the question is closed.

I believe the character and conduct of every public servant, great and small, 
should be subject to the constant scrutiny of the people. This must be true if 
a democracy serves its purpose.

It is in this spirit that I now bid those who have been listening to me 
goodnight.
