<u>BACKGROUND</u> 

MORGAN: "Mystery in the Air" starring Peter Lorre...Presented by Camel 
Cigarettes. 

<u>MUSIC: "MYSTERY IN THE AIR" THEME</u> 

CROWD: (MURMUR) 

ARISTIDE: Now, ladies and gentlemen, if you will inspect the forty-seven wax 
images you see before you, I think you will admit they are more life-like, 
more startlingly real, than any you have ever seen before! 

CROWD: (MURMUR OF ASSENT) 

ARISTIDE: But the greatest interest lies in the fact that each one of these 
figures is a fiendish, sadistic murderer!!!!

CROWD: (AWED REACTION) 

ARISTIDE: (FADING) But come -- I begin at the end of the line, and describe 
their horrible crimes in detail. 

CROWD: (MURMUR FADING...CONTINUES UNDER FOLLOWING...) 

LORRE: (SOTTO) Oh -- there he goes -- once more telling people all the bad 
things we did. Oh but it's terrible -- being nothing but figures in a wax 
museum -- with people staring at us all day long, and not one of them - not 
one ever suspects that <u>we</u> <u>are</u> <u>still</u> <u>alive</u>!! 

<u>MUSIC: "MYSTERY THEME" - SWELLS BIG...THEN TO B.G.</u>

<u>FIRST COMMERCIAL</u>:

MORGAN: Each week at this time, Camel cigarettes bring you Peter Lorre in the 
excitement of the great stories of the strange and unusual - of dark and 
compelling masterpieces culled from the four corners of world literature. 

<u>MUSIC: OUT</u> 

MORGAN: Tonight -- "The Mask of Medusa," by Nelson Bond. 

<u>MUSIC: GONG ... THEN SNEAK IN CURTAIN</u> 

ROY: "Mystery in the Air" ... starring Peter Lorre, brought to you by <u>Camel</u> 
<u>Cigarettes</u>! 

MUSIC: CURTAIN UP TO FINISH 

(APPLAUSE) 

ROY: "Experience is the best teacher! Try a Camel - let your own experience 
tell you why more people are smoking Camels than ever before! When you smoke a 
cigarette, it's your "T-Zone" that passes judgment on it. Yes, your "T-
Zone"...that's T for Taste and T for Throat ... is <u>your</u> proving ground for any 
cigarette. If your taste longs for really full, rich flavor in a cigarette ... 
if your Throat would welcome true coolness and mildness in a cigarette ... 
don't miss trying a Camel. You may well find, like so many millions of 
smokers, that Camels suit your "T-Zone" to a T!

<u>MUSIC: "MYSTERY IN THE AIR" THEME TO SHIMMER..THEN UNDER AND OUT</u>

<u>CROWD: LOW, CONVERSATION OF PEOPLE INSPECTING WAX WORKS EXHIBIT</u> 

KARL: (APPROACHING) So, Greta -- how do you like this little fellow, eh? 

GRETA: Oh, he is nice, Karl. I don't believe he ever did anything wrong. 

KARL: (LAUGHS) You women -- always the same. You heard the lecturer say that 
everyone of these figures is the likeness of a real murderer. Maybe this 
little angel poisoned his wife, hey? (LAUGHS) 

GRETA: I don't believe it. He is too innocent looking..... 

KARL: They always are. 

GRETA: Except his eyes...they go right thru me. 

KARL: Come out of here ... before it really gets you. 

LORRE: (SOTTO) Idiots! Morons! Can't they see I am still--? But no, I suppose 
not. I'd like to be alive again, I'd --- "Alive" again? I'm alive right now - 
but I'd be better off dead. I can hear - I can see - I can feel - and I can 
<u>think</u>. But I cannot move - I cannot move at all - (GRUNTING WITH EFFORT) - no 
matter how I try. 

<u>CROWD: MURMUR APPROACHING</u> 

ARISTIDE: And now ladies and gentlemen, if you will regard these recent 
specimens -- and if I may say so myself, they're masterpieces. 

MISS AKINS: (SHRIEKS) 

ARISTIDE: What's the matter, madam?

MISS AKINS: (VERY ENGLISH) That strange looking little one! I was watching him 
and he moved his eyes! 

ARISTIDE: Thank you, madam - that's a true compliment to my artistry. But I 
assure you the gentleman did not move his eyes -- that would be utterly 
impossible. He is made of wax and other substances known only to myself.

MISS AKINS: Rubbish. I am English, my man, and you can't bamboozle me.

ARISTIDE: (SMOOTHLY) I'm sorry if the realism of my exhibits has played tricks 
with your imagination -- 

MISS AKINS: Imagination, fiddlesticks. I tell you I saw -- 

ARISTIDE: (INTERRUPTING) If you doubt that my exhibit is exactly as 
represented, madame, may I return your price of admission? Here you are. 

MISS AKINS: (MOLLIFIED) Oh, thank you so much. 

ARISTIDE: (INSINUATING) Now perhaps, if I might suggest a little fresh air --? 

MISS AKINS: I do feel a bit faint -- all these ghastly crimes, you know - 
(FADING) - I believe I'll go and have a cup of tea. 

ARISTIDE; To resume, ladies and gentlemen, if you will step over this way - 
this way - you will see exhibit number three - the infamous Hatchet Woman of 
Hamburg -- in life she was Frau Helser. (FADING) Over a period of five short 
years she -- shall we say -- liquidated more than seventeen of her close 
friends and neighbors, in the most gruesome manner -- (CONTINUE SPEECH AD LIB 
IN B.G.) 

<u>CROWD: MURMURS..UP AND MOVE OFF</u>

LORRE: (IMITATING HIM) This way - this way - just listen to him - day in, day 
out we stand here while he talks and talks about us. Oh, he is so boring
....All he talks about are those silly, incidental murders we committed. Why 
doesn't he talk about how we did them. Why, here in this room are some of the 
greatest artists in their lines the world has ever known. For example - just 
look at the ones on each side of me. On my left - that's Paul ... Oh he was 
the most skillful man with [a] scalpel in Prague. Oh he was wonderful. - Even 
today they haven't found all the pieces of the bodies he carved up. And on my 
right is the beautiful Magda, who always killed with a German Luger. She used 
but one bullet to a husband, and she did away with five of them. It is an 
honor to stand between such exquisite artists. And as for me ... (SIGHS) I can 
hardly believe it was only three days ago that I walked in here of my own free 
will. My own free will... 

<u>MUSIC: IN AND DOWN UNDER</u> 

<u>SOUND: DOOR OPENS...LITTLE SHOP BELL TINKLES, DOOR CLOSES</u> 

ARISTIDE: Good evening, sir. 

LORRE: (NERVOUS) Oh...er...good evening. 

ARISTIDE: You wish to see my wax figures?

LORRE: Wax figures? 

ARISTIDE: Yes...all around you. 

LORRE: Oh...oh yes, of course. (LAUGHS NERVOUSLY) You mean to say all these 
people are wax? 

ARISTIDE: But certainly. 

LORRE: You know for a moment I thought they were alive. 

ARISTIDE: A very natural mistake. 

<u>SOUND: SIREN...FAR OFF INCREASES DURING NEXT TWO SPEECHES</u> 

ARISTIDE: By the way...is anything the matter? You seem nervous. What's the 
matter with you?

LORRE: I'm not nervous.

<u>SOUND: SIREN REACHES PEAK...LOUD THEN STARTS TO FADE</u> 

LORRE: That's an ugly sound. (RELIEVED) Oh it's late..I'm sure you want to 
close up. I'll go away now, and perhaps some other time... 

ARISTIDE: It is never too late to show my masterpieces. But first I'll lock 
the door and draw the shades... 

<u>SOUND: DOOR BOLTS...SHADES PULLED...SIREN IS BY NOW OUT</u> 

ARISTIDE: There...you don't have to be afraid of being seen... 

LORRE: (STARTLED) Afraid? Why should I be afraid? 

ARISTIDE: I don't know. Why should <u>anyone</u> be afraid? 

LORRE: Well, I am in no hurry. I suppose since I am here, I might... 

ARISTIDE: Look over my collection? 

LORRE: Why not? 

ARISTIDE: Good. Permit me to introduce myself. I am Aristide Zweig, owner of 
this exhibit, artist, and connoisseur of crime. 

LORRE: (LAUGHS. HE IS A LITTLE MORE SURE OF HIMSELF) Artist and connoisseur of 
crime? That's an odd combination. 

ARISTIDE: Not at all...as you shall see. Suppose we begin here -- do you by 
any chance recognize this one? 

LORRE: No. But he is very ugly. 

ARISTIDE: Roger Saunders. Englishman. A Poisoner -- not very imaginative. Next 
to him, here, is Nicholas Rodriguez he killed with the knife --- 

LORRE: Wait a minute -- 

ARISTIDE: What's the matter? 

LORRE: These people -- they all have a strange look. 

ARISTIDE: Strange? How? 

LORRE: As if -- as if they had just seen something horrible and then their 
faces froze ---

ARISTIDE: (LAUGHS SOFTLY) Perhaps they did see something - something that made 
them realize the horror of their crimes. 

LORRE: Crimes? Are these <u>all</u> criminals? 

ARISTIDE: Every one. All forty-six of them - murderers!!!

LORRE: (HE IS BEGINNING TO THINK ARISTIDE IS A LITTLE OFF) You must be very 
interested in murder, to get up a collection like this. 

ARISTIDE: Oh, but I am. It is my mission. 

LORRE: Mission? What are you talking about? 

ARISTIDE: Murder! Murder ... that most horrible of crimes. I hate it...I 
loathe and despise its perpetrators!! It is my mission to show the world these 
fiends in human form...to display them in all their brutal bestiality..that 
men may view them, tremble, and take heed!

LORRE: (HUMORING HIM) Oh, I see... I see. And where do you get your..er..
specimens? From the morgue? 

ARISTIDE: Not from the morgue. I get them here, there, wherever I can find 
them. Usually I have to go out and look for them...as a matter of fact there 
is one now I would like to have very much...for my forty-seventh specimen. 

LORRE: Oh? 

ARISTIDE: Yes...he murdered a defenseless old woman, quite near here...not 
half an hour ago it was. I heard it over my radio. He brutally murdered her, 
and took her life's savings.... 

LORRE: (TENSE AGAIN) Did..did they catch him? 

ARISTIDE: Not yet, but they will. They are watching all the roads. And besides 
that, the old woman's money was in old bills, so old it is now out of 
circulation. When he tries to pass it, they will know. And if they don't catch 
him, I will!!!

LORRE: <u>You</u> will? 

ARISTIDE: Yes...murder must be avenged and exposed..by one means or another! 
But forgive me for going on like this.. sometimes I get carried away. Let's 
get back to this next figure. A most interesting case. This man, Hans 
Schneider, who murdered by air embolism.... 

LORRE: Schneider? Did you say Hans Schneider? 

ARISTIDE: Yes. 

LORRE: I knew him...but he disappeared - he was never captured... never even 
suspected... 

ARISTIDE: None of them were. 

LORRE: Then...then how did you get them here? 

ARISTIDE: I told you, I am an artist. I have my own methods of reproducing 
their likenesses. 

LORRE: (HORRIFIED) Wait..is that a model of Schneider, or <u>is</u> <u>that</u> <u>Schneider</u> 
<u>himself</u>? 

ARISTIDE: (HAPPILY) How in the world did you happen to guess? You're quite 
correct, it <u>is</u> Schneider! 

LORRE: But this is monstrous. 

ARISTIDE: Not at all...you just do not understand. 

LORRE: I understand, you - you dirty hypocrite! You hate murder and yet you've 
killed everyone in this room! 

ARISTIDE: No, I didn't kill them. 

LORRE: How did you do it? Poison? A knife? Or did you dip them into the tallow 
vat alive? 

ARISTIDE: None of those things. They're not dead. 

LORRE: <u>What</u>? What did you say? 

ARISTIDE: They are not dead. They are simply in a state of permanent suspended 
animation. 

LORRE: Are you mad? Are you insane? 

ARISTIDE: It's true. I just let them look, and that's what happened. 

LORRE: Let them look at what? 

ARISTIDE: Did you ever hear of the Gorgon's head? The head of Medusa?

LORRE: Of course. I went to school. I studied Greek mythology. Medusa was once 
a beautiful woman, but she offended Athena, who changed her hair into snakes 
and made her face so hideous...so horrible - that all who looked on her were 
turned to stone. Later Perseus cut off her head. 

ARISTIDE: You are right and the severed head could still turn men to stone. 

LORRE: (LAUGHS) I know..but that was a long time ago. 

ARISTIDE: Would <u>you</u> care to look upon it? 

LORRE: What are you talking about? 

ARISTIDE: Oh, it's here. The Mask of Medusa was found -- long ago, in a wild 
lost grotto in Greece. Where and how does not matter -- but it has been the 
means of fulfilling my sacred mission, the destruction -- the cleansing of the 
world -- of those who slay their fellow men. 

LORRE: Now I know you are mad! 

ARISTIDE: (LAUGHS) Perhaps I am the only sane one in a world gone mad. 

LORRE: (HUMORING HIM) Oh sure, sure, tell me sir, this mask - what does it 
look like? 

ARISTIDE: Oh, I have never seen it myself. The native who gave it to me warned 
me - I do not dare look. 

LORRE: (LAUGHS) I don't blame you. Now suppose we talk a little business, you 
and me, eh? 

ARISTIDE: What do you want? 

LORRE: Your help -- to get me out of Vienna. 

ARISTIDE: How can I help you? 

LORRE: Oh, it's simple. Nobody suspects you - that is, nobody but me. You put 
me in a crate like one of these forty-six models you're so proud of, and send 
it off in a truck. Simple, eh? 

ARISTIDE: But why - why should I do this? 

LORRE: (MENACE) Why? Because you fear the police as much as I do. 

ARISTIDE: You fear the police? You -- are a murderer? 

LORRE: I didn't say that! 

ARISTIDE: (SOFTLY) You are a murderer. 

LORRE: No more than you are. 

ARISTIDE: But I didn't kill them. I told you -- 

LORRE: Yes, yes, it is a fine story. But who is going to believe it. The 
police? Oh no, sir -- oh no. If the police come here -- and I will make sure 
they do come here -- 

ARISTIDE: (INTERRUPTING) It would take money. 

LORRE: Here is money -- all the money you need. 

ARISTIDE: (EXCITED) I thought so. That money -- those old bills!! It <u>was</u> <u>you</u>! 
You are the one who murdered the old woman -- and took her savings. I thought 
so, all along!! 

LORRE: That stupid woman -- if she hadn't resisted me -- she... 

ARISTIDE: (FEVERISHLY) Wait -- I have something in this cabinet I want to show 
you -- 

<u>SOUND: CLICK OF CABINET LATCH</u> 

LORRE: No tricks, you hear me - or the police -- hey, what's in that sack?!! 

ARISTIDE: I didn't want to do this -- I never want to do it -- but it must be 
done! 

<u>MUSIC: EFFECT IN</u> 

LORRE: Don't want to do what? Stop, you --!!!  

ARISTIDE: Look murderer, upon the crimson Mask of Medusa!!! Yes, look -- look 
upon the Mask of Medusa. 

LORRE: You're insane! You're - No, no, put it away - my legs, my hands - I 
can't stand it -- I can't -- (SCREAMS) 

ARISTIDE: Ah...Now I have number forty-seven. 

<u>MUSIC: UP TO CURTAIN</u> 

(<u>APPLAUSE)</u>

MORGAN: In a few moments, Mr. Peter Lorre will bring us the climax of 
tonight's "Mystery In The Air" when Camels present Act Two of - "The Mask of 
Medusa". 

<u>MUSIC: GONG</u> 

ROY: It's been proved time and time again -- in work, in sports, in <u>everything</u> 
we do -- Experience is the Best Teacher. Ace midget-auto racer Walter Ader 
proved it <u>conclusively</u> when two other cars crashed and almost blocked the 
track during a recent championship race. Roaring up at <u>one</u> <u>hundred</u> <u>miles</u> <u>an</u> 
<u>hour</u> - Walter Ader squeaked through an opening only inches wider than his car. 
As Mr. Ader said: 

MAN: Experience is the best teacher .. In choosing cigarettes as well as in 
auto racing! I've smoked most all the brands .. Camel's suit me best! 

ROY: Yes ... experience <u>is</u> the <u>best</u> <u>teacher</u>! Smokers learned how true that is 
-- during the wartime cigarette shortage. Smoking so many different brands ... 
when there was no choice...made folks experts on judging the differences in 
cigarette quality. . Well, that proved to thousands and thousands of smokers 
that there's nothing like Camel's rich, full flavor...nothing like Camel's 
cool mildness. Result --

CHANDLER: (FILTER) More people are smoking Camels than ever before!

ROY: Experience is the best teacher. Try a Camel yourself!

<u>MUSIC: "MYSTERY" THEME TO SHIMMER - THEN UNDER AND OUT</u>

MORGAN: Now a new crowd is viewing the attractions of Aristide Zweig wax 
museum...the lifelike, living but not breathing, images of the forty-seven 
murderers. 

CROWD: (AS IN FIRST SCENE) 

1ST GIRL: Come Hilda...let's go out side...I don't like this place. 

2ND GIRL: Wait, here's one we didn't see. 

1ST GIRL: I don't know how you can stand there looking at them.... the 
murderers!! And their faces...ugh! 

2ND GIRL: This little one isn't so bad, if he was alive I could... 

1ST GIRL: (SHIVERS) He is horrible! Come on... 

2ND GIRL: (FADING) Oh all right. 

LORRE: (SOTTO) I could crush her skull. Stupid idiots. No - it is not pleasant 
to be stared at day after day, by people who know nothing of life or death as 
we know it. The living death...that's what it is, and he -- he is responsible. 
If we could only somehow - somehow get back to normal.. even for a little 
bit....Oh, what we could do, all of us. What we could do. 

<u>MUSIC: IN AND UP FOR TRANSITION</u> 

<u>SOUND: TOWN CLOCK BOOMS 12...OFF CONTINUES UNDER SCENE</u> 

LORRE: (OVER CLOCK) Midnight. How still it is. But..but something odd is 
happening. A little while ago, my mind was blank - I was not thinking about 
anything, but suddenly a thought came into my head...yes suddenly out of 
nowhere. 

MAGDA: (SOFTLY) Yes...we can project our thoughts, if we try. 

LORRE: Who...who is what? 

MAGDA: Magda. Standing next to you... Think, think hard! If we all think 
together, perhaps we can make somebody help us. 

LORRE: Yes, yes of course. Wonderful. Magda - she's wonderful. Forty-seven 
minds trained in crime, all concentrating at once on somebody who comes in 
here to look. If we try, if we try hard enough, we could make him do anything. 
Maybe we could even get him to...no, that's too much to expect. But still.... 

<u>MUSIC: UP FOR TRANSITION</u> 

<u>SOUND: VISITORS MURMURING OFF</u> 

LORRE: Another day has started, but today, I have a feeling of excitement. All 
night long we concentrated and our thoughts were getting stronger and 
stronger. I'm convinced Magda has gotten through to everyone. I have a feeling 
that something is going to happen, and just a little while ago there came the 
thought.... 

MAGDA: (SOFTLY) Zweig is upstairs in his room. We must watch the door. When 
the right one comes, we shall know it at once...be ready! 

LORRE: I'm ready....whatever is going to happen, I'm ready.... 

<u>SOUND: DOOR OPENS. A LITTLE BELL JANGLES..DOOR CLOSES</u> 

LORRE: The door is opening.... maybe this is it. 

ILSE: (LITTLE OFF) (A NEUROTIC GIRL OF ABOUT SEVENTEEN) But, Father.... I'm 
frightened....I do not wish to look.... 

FATHER: (HEAVY, UNIMAGINATIVE) It won't hurt you, Ilse. Teach you maybe to 
get over your stupid fears. You look at these figures..every one of them, you 
understand? 

ILSE: (VERY LOW) Yes, father. 

FATHER: Where is that Lecturer? He should be here. I will find him...(FADING) 
...so that he can tell you all about these criminals. 

ILSE: (GASPS) 

MAGDA: (SOFT) Think..think..hard... 

LORRE: (EXCITED) There's no doubt of it...this little Ilse, she's the one. 
Yes, she's the one we've been waiting for....she has the kind of mind we need. 
Yes. Oh, how exciting...the thoughts are coming in very strong. Keep thinking, 
Magda. 

MAGDA: (SOFTLY) Matches and fire. Matches and fire. Matches and fire. 

LORRE: (OVERLAPPING) We can't be free unless something happens to that 
horrible Mask of Medusa over there in that cabinet. If something could happen 
to that, the spell might be broken. Magda, what are you thinking? 

MAGDA: (SLIGHTLY LOUDER) Matches and fire. Matches and fire. (CONTINUES SAME 
THING IN RHYTHM UNDERNEATH FOLLOWING) 

LORRE: I've got it. Of course, I've got it....fire! (PICKS UP WITH MAGDA) 
Matches and fire. Matches and fire. 

ILSE: (OVER THIS) Father, father..where are you? I feel... strange....

OTHERS: (PICK UP THE CHANT, SOFT, OMINOUS) Matches and fire. Matches and fire. 
(CONTINUE UNDER TO END OF SCENE) 

FATHER: (FADING IN) I beg your pardon, have you seen my daughter? She was here 
a minute ago - a thin girl, about sixteen. 

MAN'S VOICE: I haven't seen her. 

WOMAN: I saw her, just now. Over there by that cabinet, I think it was. She 
had a box of matches in her hand, and -- 

VOICE: (OFF) Fire - fire!! 

LORRE & FIGURES: Ahhh! 

<u>SOUND: PANDEMONIUM, RUNNING FEET, FADE OUT, DOOR SLAMS, CRACKLE OF FLAMES</u> 

LORRE: It's worked! All our trained evil minds concentrating on that one small 
mind - oh, we simply overwhelmed it. Poor little Ilse - she will never know 
why she started that fire, but it is a big wonderful fire and the cabinet is 
burning - it's burning, and what is that? Something is happening - something 
is happening - I have just been able to move the little finger on my left 
hand! Yes, we can move! 

MUSIC: IN FAST AND DOWN 

LORRE: We are free...we can move. All of us...we are moving... we, the <u>walking</u> 
<u>dead</u>!

CAST: ANGRY MURMUR BUILDS THROUGHOUT FOLLOWING:

<u>MUSIC: UP</u>

LORRE: Everyone is moving swiftly on through the flames - towards the stairs. 
Yes, we, a horrible company - oh, how exciting - white faces gleaming in the 
flames... Forty-seven, we are - murderers, all of us, surging forward to get 
the man we all hate. He is a murderer, too - but worse than us...His victims 
stay alive. He condemned all forty-seven of us to a horrible, endless living 
death.

ARISTIDE: The Medusa - what have you done to it? 

LORRE: We've taken care of your Medusa Mask, Aristide, and now we will take 
care of you! 

ARISTIDE: No - please - don't -- I will help you - you don't know the Mask -- 
you fools - I'll help you - you haven't got much time --

MAGDA: (SCREAMS) Listen - it's coming - the Mask is coming!

CAST: AWED REACTION

LORRE: It's coming up the stairs after us! 

PAUL: Kill him - at least we can kill him before -- 

LORRE: No - stop - wait - I have a plan.- get away from the door - let me get 
there!

ARISTIDE: It is here! Close your eyes! 

LORRE: Don't look - don't look at it!

CAST: (SCREAMS OF OTHERS)

MUSIC: PEAK

ARISTIDE: Too late. They looked - and now they're all gone. Everybody has gone 
back as they were before - 

LORRE: Yes, gone. All gone, but you and I. Wait. 

ARISTIDE: What are you going to do? 

LORRE: I'll show you what I am going to do!

<u>SOUND: PAUSE - BUMP - ANOTHER BUMP</u>

LORRE: Look, Aristide - <u>look</u> <u>here</u>. 

ARISTIDE: What...? 

LORRE: You opened your eyes - you saw it! Keep looking, yes, you are looking 
on the crimson Mask of Medusa! 

ARISTIDE: (SCREAMS) Oh, no - no - no!

LORRE: Look - look! (LAUGHS) Now you can't move your feet - (LAUGHS) or your 
hands. Yes, now you are not even able to talk. You have looked upon the Mask 
of Medusa. You have looked-- (CHOKES) I - I - I looked at it, too! 

(SILENCE) 

<u>MUSIC: CRASH OF MUSIC TRANSITION</u> 

LORRE: Well - here we are - all of us -- the finest criminal minds in the 
world...the elite...the cream of crime. Now we are just wax figures in a side 
show. But now there are forty-eight of us! (LAUGHS) Yes - I suppose we should 
feel honored to have with us the great Aristide Zweig. This way he looks quite 
natural, standing over there between Schneider and Paul. At least he doesn't 
bore us with those silly, stupid lectures. No - now he doesn't talk at all. 
Someone called Albert is running the exhibit now - poor Albert is an imbecile 
- Albert doesn't know there <u>was</u> a Mask of Medusa. Oh, we are much more 
intelligent than Albert - he doesn't even know that we are all alive!
