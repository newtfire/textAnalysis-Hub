ANNOUNCER
SCARLETT O'HARA
RHETT BUTLER
AUNT PITTYPAT



ANNOUNCER: ... A more sober, more reflective America reads such historical 
novels as "Gone With the Wind" by Margaret Mitchell, a scene from which is 
dramatized for the first time on the air, with Miss Constance Bennett as 
Scarlett O'Hara and Mr. Robert Montgomery as Rhett Butler.

MUSIC: INTRODUCTION ... ORCHESTRA PLAYS A SOBER "DIXIE" ... THEN BRISK IN BG

ANNOUNCER: "Gone With the Wind," the story of Scarlett O'Hara, daughter of a 
South whose traditions have been shattered by the Civil War.

MUSIC: "DIXIE" UP AND OUT ... THEN GENTLE HARP BEHIND ANNOUNCER--

ANNOUNCER: Scarlett O'Hara -- coquette, vixen; ready to recruit every feminine 
wile to achieve her personal pleasures and stability; who married a man she 
did not love, though fascinated by Rhett Butler, charming scoundrel and 
blockade runner. Then -- her husband is killed. On the evening of his burial, 
Scarlett sits alone in her room, alone with herself, rationalizing, as her 
brain insists on tormenting her.

SCARLETT: (TO HERSELF) For once, it's quiet in the house. Not even any 
quarreling with Peter or Mammy or Cookie. Nothing. And all because Frank is 
lying in his grave -- and I killed him. (INHALES SHARPLY) No, no -- I mustn't 
say that. But he <u>did</u> go out in the night for me. He was caught in that raid 
and shot. God'll punish me for that. God'll punish me for marrying Frank when 
he really loved Suellen. I made him very unhappy and he bore it like a 
gentleman. But I - I really didn't make him entirely unhappy. I gave him our 
child Ella. (EMOTIONAL) Oh, Frank, if you were only alive now, I - I could 
make up for it all. If I could only find someone who would let me put my head 
on his shoulder and cry, I wouldn't see Frank's face; that hurt look. I 
wouldn't see it any more!

SOUND: DOOR KNOCKER, OFF

RHETT: (OFF) Aunt Pitty? I want to talk with Scarlett!

PITTY: (OFF) But the child is lying down now, Captain Butler. She's right 
prostrated.

RHETT: (OFF) She'll see me. You tell her I'm goin' away tomorrow. Tell her 
it's terribly important.

SCARLETT: (CALLS, PLEASANTLY) Rhett, I'll be down directly! (BEAT, TO HERSELF) 
I must put some rouge on. No. No, I'd better not. Aunt Pitty would be shocked. 
(CALLS) I'm comin' down, Rhett!

SOUND: SCARLETT'S STEPS DOWN STAIRS BEHIND--

RHETT: Forgive me for disturbin' you, Scarlett. I'm sorry I couldn't be at 
Frank's funeral.

SCARLETT: I understand.

RHETT: Will ya pardon us, Aunt Pitty?

PITTY: Oh, certainly, certainly. (MOVING OFF) I'll close the door as I go out.

SOUND: DOOR CLOSES

SCARLETT: Why'd ya come, Rhett?

RHETT: I wanted to find out.

SCARLETT: Find out what?

RHETT: What the matter with <u>you</u> is.

SCARLETT: (STUNG) You're - you're a real callous person, Rhett. (EXHALES, 
AMUSED) You're like me.

RHETT: Come on, honey. What is it? Isn't it more than just old Frank dyin'?

SCARLETT: (SUDDENLY EMOTIONAL) Oh, Rhett, I'm so afraid. I - I'm afraid I'll 
die and go to hell.

RHETT: (AMUSED, DRY) You're pretty healthy, and maybe there isn't any hell.

SCARLETT: Oh, but there is, Rhett! You <u>know</u> there is!

RHETT: I know there is, but it's right here on earth.

SCARLETT: (SADLY) I oughtn't to have married Frank. It was wrong. He was 
Suellen's beau and he loved her, not me. But I lied to him: I told him she was 
gonna marry someone else. How could I have done it, Rhett?

RHETT: (AMUSED) So that's how you got Frank! I always wondered.

SCARLETT: I made him do all sorts of things he didn't want to do. I was so 
mean to him, but I'm not really mean. My mother always said that I - I--

RHETT: Your mother? I've often wondered what your mother was like. 

SCARLETT: Oh, Rhett, for the first time I - I'm glad she's dead, so she can't 
see me. She didn't raise me to be mean, Rhett. She'd rather I'd have starved 
than do this. And I so wanted to be like her in every way -- and I'm not like 
her a bit. Not a bit! Mother died, right after the Yankees went through. 
Rhett, you can't imagine. I - I get all cold when I think of it. I can see how 
everything is burned and so still and there's nothin' to eat. Oh, Rhett, in my 
dreams I'm hungry again.

RHETT: Go on.

SCARLETT: I'm hungry and my mind keeps saying, "If I ever get out of this, 
I'll never, never be hungry again," and then - and then the dream goes off 
into a gray mist and I'm - I'm running, running so hard my heart's about to 
burst and somethin' is chasin' me, and I can't breathe but I keep thinkin', 
"If I can just get there, I'll be safe." But - I don't know where I'm tryin' 
to get to.

RHETT: (SERIOUS) Honey, let's get to the bottom of this. You say if you had it 
to do over again, you'd do it differently. But would you? Think, now: would 
you?

SCARLETT: (EXHALES) Oh, I don't know. It's all too mixed up.

RHETT: (ANNOYED) Why don't you tell me the truth? Hasn't your conscience 
bothered you before this?

SCARLETT: Well, I didn't think much about conscience before. I - I guess I 
just reckoned God would understand.

RHETT: (DRY) But you don't credit God with understandin' why you married 
Frank.

SCARLETT: Rhett! How can you talk about God so, when you don't even believe 
there <u>is</u> one?

RHETT: But <u>you</u> believe in a God of Wrath and that's what's important at the 
moment. I'm surprised at you, Scarlett, for sproutin' a conscience this late 
in life. Opportunists like you shouldn't have them.

SCARLETT: What's an opportunist?

RHETT: Person who takes advantage of opportunities.

SCARLETT: Is that wrong?

RHETT: It's always been held in bad taste by those who had the same 
opportunities and didn't take them. Now I'll tell you why I came here this 
evening.

SCARLETT: Why?

RHETT: I'm goin' away.

SCARLETT: Where?

RHETT: To England. And I've got news.

SCARLETT: What news?

RHETT: My news is this: I still want you more than any woman I've ever seen 
and now that Frank is gone, I thought you'd be interested to know it.

SCARLETT: (INDIGNANT) Rhett Butler, you're the most ill-bred man in the world, 
comin' here at a time like this with - with Frank hardly cold in his grave. If 
you had any decency--

RHETT: I'm afraid you miss my point.

SCARLETT: I don't miss anything. Let go of me and get out of here. 

RHETT: Listen, I am askin' you to marry me. Would you be convinced if I knelt 
down?

SCARLETT: (BREATHLESSLY SURPRISED) Oh--

RHETT: (MATTER-OF-FACT) I've always intended havin' you, Scarlett, since the 
first day I saw you at Twelve Oaks -- when you threw a vase and swore, just to 
prove to me you weren't a lady. 

SCARLETT: (ASTONISHED, SUSPICIOUS) You look so calm. Just as-- Just as if you 
were discussin' the weather.

RHETT: (AMUSED) I bare my soul and you're suspicious. (MATTER-OF-FACT) I'm 
goin' away for a long time and if I wait till I return I'm afraid you'll have 
married someone else with money. So I thought, why not me and <u>my</u> money? 
Really, Scarlett, I can't go on all my life, waitin' to catch you between 
husbands.

SCARLETT: (QUIETLY) I don't think I'll ever marry again.

RHETT: Oh, yes, you will. You were born to be married.

SCARLETT: But, Rhett, I don't love you.

RHETT: That's no drawback. You never loved Frank. Did you ever think of 
marrying just for the fun of it?

SCARLETT: Fun! Don't talk like a fool. There's no fun bein' married.

RHETT: (CHUCKLES) I don't know. Why not try marryin' a fine young man who has 
a bad reputation and a way with women?

SCARLETT: (PRIM) You're coarse. And conceited, and-- This conversation's gone 
quite far enough. 

RHETT: Come, Scarlett -- say you'll marry me or I'll stay around here and play 
a guitar under your window every night and sing at the top of my voice, so 
you'll marry me to save your reputation.

SCARLETT: But I don't <u>want</u> to marry anybody.

RHETT: (HUNGRILY) Scarlett O'Hara, you're a fool. (KISSES HER)

SCARLETT: (RESISTS HIS EMBRACE) Oh, don't, Rhett.

RHETT: Scarlett--

SCARLETT: Please.

RHETT: Scarlett--

SCARLETT: Let me go.

RHETT: You're in my arms now. Your clingin' to me is the only solid thing in a 
dizzy swayin' world. You've never felt like this before in your whole life.

SCARLETT: Rhett, please--

RHETT: You've had this comin' to you for years. None of the fools you've known 
have kissed you like this, have they?

SCARLETT: Rhett--

RHETT: Gentlemen all, but what do they know about women? What do they know 
about <u>you</u>? I know <u>you</u>. Say yes, Scarlett. Say <u>yes</u>.

SCARLETT: (BREATHLESS) Yes.

RHETT: (SURPRISED, SUSPICIOUS) You mean it? You don't want to take it back? 
Just why <u>did</u> you say yes? Look at me! Is it my money?

SCARLETT: (QUIETLY EVASIVE) Why, Rhett. What a question.

RHETT: Look up and don't try to sweet talk me!

SCARLETT: You aren't in love with <u>me</u>, are you? Why should I be in love with 
you?

RHETT: No. No, my dear, I'm not in love with you. No more than you are with 
me. And if I were, you'd be the last person I'd ever tell. God help the man 
who ever really loves you. You'd break his heart, my darling.

SCARLETT: (QUIETLY REPROVING) Rhett!

RHETT: (SATISFIED, STARTS OFF) All right. Let me know if you change your mind.

SCARLETT: (SURPRISED) Oh-- Well, aren't - aren't you gonna kiss me goodbye?

RHETT: Don't you think you've had enough kissing for one evening? (DRY) To 
think of a modest, well-brought-up young woman-- (SLY) Well, I told you it 
would be fun, didn't I?

SCARLETT: (ANNOYED) Oh, you're just impossible! And I don't care if you never 
come back!

RHETT: (GENIAL, MOVING OFF) But I <u>will</u> come back. I <u>will</u>. And you'll wait 
until I do.

SCARLETT: (KNOWS HE'S RIGHT; QUIETLY, WARMLY) Rhett--
