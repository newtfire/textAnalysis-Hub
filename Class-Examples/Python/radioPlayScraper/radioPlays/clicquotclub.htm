Episode No. 322 (or thereabouts)

_________________________

In answer to your inquiry of January 22 regarding a reply to Senate Resolution 
129, we feel that a ruling permitting a radio advertiser only the mention of 
his name as sponsor of the program and allowing him no opportunity to go 
farther than that would cause advertising men to question gravely the value of 
great expenditures for radio programs.

In our opinion, the leading network programs of the country offend in fewer 
cases to-day than ever before as regards quantity of sales talk. Programs that 
are developed by capable advertising organizations and produced over the 
leading chains are for the most part following a policy of making the 
commercial argument intriguing and subtle and actually pleasing to listeners 
and are departing from ballyhoo and over-emphasis on the product. Of course, 
there are a few -- and unfortunately those are outstanding -- that have not as 
yet seen daylight on this important element.

However, there are innumerable stations, some affiliated with chains and some 
not, that during periods when they are not carrying chain programs are selling 
to local advertisers time which is used almost exclusively for advertising 
talk, in many cases without any pretense of offering entertainment to 
listeners. Much of the present-day objection to too much air advertising is 
being brought about by this condition, which is very seldom found to be caused 
by anything other than the desire of a station to increase its revenue without 
giving too much thought to the effect of its output upon its audience.

We direct one radio program -- that of the Clicquot Club Co. -- and an 
extremely small amount of advertising copy is put into it. We are inclosing a 
sample script of this week's broadcast to illustrate this statement. On the 
program we do open a bottle of ginger ale and pour it into a glass -- a bit of 
realism that could not possibly offend the listener -- and we restrict our 
announcement to a very reasonable number of words. I doubt if more than 60 to 
90 seconds is taken up with reference to Clicquot Club's product during the 
course of this 30-minute program which has just been presented for the three 
hundred and twenty-second consecutive time over the National Broadcasting 
Co.'s network.

<i>Clicquot Club Eskimos</i>

Friday, January 29, 1932 -- 9-9.30 p. m.

ANNOUNCER (special). Now let us take you in fancy over 3,000 miles of distance 
to the heart of the frozen North -- to Clicquot Club, the night club of Eskimo 
Land.

(Signature: Complete with dog barks and whip cracks.)

ANNOUNCER. Hello, everybody! The barking dogs and carefree Eskimos of the far 
North welcome you once again to Clicquot Club, the one bright spot in Eskimo 
Land. All the Eskimos for miles around are here to-night to enjoy Harry 
Reser's sparkling banjo rhythms, to dance and make merry, and to refresh 
themselves with that sparkling, mellow drink, Clicquot Club -- America's own 
fine ginger ale. So here we go -- off to a bright start with a happy song, 
"The Sun's in My Heart."

(The Sun's in My Heart -- Orchestra with quartette chorus.)

(Interlude music.)

ANNOUNCER. From all over the country came so many requests for more of the 
banjos and the characteristic Eskimo melodies that you are going to hear many 
of them during the weeks to come. Here's one of them now as the Eskimos go on 
enjoying the dance on that slippery, gleaming ice floor of Clicquot Club and 
the orchestra plays "Cupid on the Cake."

(Cupid on the Cake -- Orchestra with baritone vocal chorus.)

(Interlude music.)

ANNOUNCER. You really can't blame the Eskimos for occasionally thinking about 
those warm, sunny lands far to the south. With the thermometer at 40 below, 
who wouldn't envy the life of a languid señor playing his guitar beneath the 
window of some black-eyed señorita. That's why the orchestra, with Tommy 
Stacks singing the lyrics, tells us all about "A Gay Caballero."

(A Gay Caballero -- Orchestra with Stacks vocal.)

(Interlude music.)

ANNOUNCER. Romance comes drifting through the windows at Clicquot Club, along 
with the snowflakes and Arctic breezes. The lights are growing dim in the 
great crystal chandeliers now, and the Eskimos move across the smooth dance 
floor in happy dancing moments as the orchestra plays "Love Songs" in the dim 
half light of this great glistening night club.

(Love Songs -- Orchestra.)

(Trio of signature to fade out for local announcement and back.)

ANNOUNCER. There's a lull for a moment or two in the dancing as the Eskimos go 
back to their tables, eager for the delicious refreshment that sparkles in 
those tall glasses. As they drink a toast to happy, carefree moments, let's 
you and I join them. I have my bottle of Clicquot Club, frosty and cold. Have 
you yours? All ready? Now off comes the cap--

(Opening sound)-- 

and into the glass it goes-- 

(Pouring sound).

Can't you hear it sparkle? That's Clicquot Club ginger ale -- lively and 
mellow always. Well, here's your health! [Pause.] Ah-h-h -- that's delicious. 
Just as good as it sounds. A mellower, smoother flavor -- keener, more 
sparkling life -- that extra something. 

And now the Eskimo quartette bringing you their bit of melody from Clicquot 
Club -- a special arrangement of "Ooh, That Kiss."

(Ooh, That Kiss -- Quartette.)

(Interlude music.)

ANNOUNCER. No evening at Clicquot Club would be complete without that famous 
banjo and Chief Eskimo Harry Reser to draw golden melody from its strings. 
That's why the Eskimos flock around the platform now as Harry tunes up and, 
with the orchestra, brings you that sparklin' tune, "Nola."

(Nola -- Orchestra -- Reser solo -- Banjo featuring.)

(Interlude music.)

ANNOUNCER. Now back to the dance floor again -- the rhythm, the melody, the 
laughing gaiety of the dance. Many a spill on the icy floor and many a pick-
up, too. It's all in fun, you know, and here's the orchestra with "You're My 
Everything" from "The Laugh Parade."

(You're My Everything -- Orchestra.)

(Interlude Music.)

ANNOUNCER. Everything has to end, you know. The last bubble bursts in the last 
tall glass of ginger ale, and the last dance comes all too soon. And so just 
before we're cut off from the world outside for another week, here's a melody 
to remember the Eskimos by -- "Look Me up When You're Down in Tennessee."

(Look Me up When You're Down in Tennessee -- Orchestra.)

(Signature.)

Closing announcement (against trio background):
So another round of pleasure at Clicquot Club draws to a close. Come again and 
join the fun next Friday evening at the same hour. Your invitation to this 
Eskimo night club comes from the Clicquot Club Co., makers of Clicquot Club 
ginger ale -- the mellow, delicious ginger ale on every bottle of which you 
see the Eskimo's smiling face promising you delightful refreshment, mellower 
flavor, that extra something.

This is John S. Young announcing. This program has come from the NBC Studios 
in New York.
