MUSIC: SUSPENSE THEME

ANNOUNCER: Auto-Lite and its ninety-eight thousand dealers bring you Mr. Jack 
Benny in tonight's presentation of-- 

MUSIC: KNIFE CHORD

ANNOUNCER: Suspense! Tonight Auto-Lite, following a popular trend, anticipates 
the strange disappearance of Experimental Rocket Ship Y-Two-Seven-Two-B. The 
time -- the year Two Thousand and Fifty-Three. The place -- the planet Mars. 
The star -- Mr. Jack Benny. 

MUSIC: UP AND OUT

HARLOW WILCOX: Say, Hap, that was quite a speech you made last night. You were 
as dynamic as an Auto-Lite Sta-Ful Battery. 

HAP: Well, that's flattery, Harlow.

HARLOW WILCOX: And what a battery it is, Hap. The Auto-Lite Sta-Ful is the 
power-packed pepster that needs water only three times a year in normal car 
use.

HAP: I really don't deserve such praise, Harlow.

HARLOW WILCOX: Why not? That's the battery with the fiberglass retaining mat 
protecting every positive plate -- to reduce shedding and flaking, and give 
the Auto-Lite Sta-Ful longer life, as proved by tests conducted according to 
accepted life cycle standards.

HAP: I was really good, eh, Harlow?

HARLOW WILCOX: Aw, no one could do any better -- than to visit his nearest 
Auto-Lite battery dealer, who services all makes of batteries. To quickly 
locate him, just call Western Union by number. 

OPERATOR: (FILTER) And ask for Operator Twenty-Five! I'll tell you the name of 
your nearest Auto-Lite battery dealer where you can get an Auto-Lite Sta-
Ful--

HARLOW WILCOX: The battery that needs water only three times a year in normal 
car use. And, remember, from bumper to tail light, you're always right with 
Auto-Lite.

MUSIC: SUSPENSE THEME

ANNOUNCER: And now, Auto-Lite presents, transcribed, "Plan X," starring Mr. 
Jack Benny, hoping once again to keep you in--

MUSIC: KNIFE CHORD

ANNOUNCER: --<u>suspense</u>! 

MUSIC: QUIRKY FUTURISTIC INTRODUCTION, THEN OUT

MARTIAN 1: The card. Do you have the card yet?

MARTIAN 2: Uh, one more run through the machine. 

MARTIAN 1: Turid, when do you think the Earth rocket is arriving?

MARTIAN 2: Tomorrow. But if the Grand Council wanted the card before now, they 
should have asked me before now.

SOUND: COMPUTER NOISILY WHIRS AND SPITS OUT CARD

MARTIAN 1: Is that it? Let me see it.

MARTIAN 2: Mm, here.

SOUND: THEY HANDLE THE CARD

MARTIAN 1: (READS, MILDLY SURPRISED) One-Three-Seven-Five-Six. Xeno. Assembly 
line worker. Atomic escalator factory.

MARTIAN 2: Mm.

MARTIAN 1: Turid! THIS is the man for the job?

MARTIAN 2: He has the specifications called for.

MARTIAN 1: An assembly line worker. Why, it's incredible. Incredible.

MUSIC: QUIRKY FUTURISTIC TRANSITION, THEN OUT

SOUND: SWITCH CLICKS

RECEPTIONIST: Yes? ... Yes. ... Right away.

SOUND: SWITCH CLICKS

RECEPTIONIST: You may go in now, Xeno. The Grand Council is ready for you.

SOUND: FOOTSTEPS, THROUGH DOOR, INTO COUNCIL ROOM ... THEN STOP

VOICE: One-Three-Seven-Five-Six called Xeno, come forward.

XENO: Yes, sir.

SOUND: FOOTSTEPS

VOICE: Xeno, the Grand Council of Mars has a mission for you to perform.

XENO: Me? A mission?

VOICE: You have been selected because of the qualities shown on your Work and 
Identity Card, Form Forty-Two-Dash-A. Set habit patterns, attention to detail, 
no strong emotional or biological drives, and complete suppression of 
imagination.

XENO: Well, I always pride myself that I--

VOICE: Do not speak unless questioned, Xeno. The Grand Council has other 
important matters of state.

XENO: Oh, of course, of course.

VOICE: You have heard the Tele-Perform broadcast that an armed rocket from the 
planet Earth is approaching Mars?

XENO: Hm? Oh - oh, I DID hear something about it, yes.

VOICE: Their course has been plotted as bringing them to a landing on the 
plain outside the city at ten-fourteen tomorrow morning.

XENO: Ten-fourteen? You know, I wouldn't mind seeing that.

VOICE: You will see it, Citizen Xeno. 

XENO: Me?

VOICE: You.

XENO: Well, I'd certainly like to but - I'm due in the atomic escalator 
factory at eight. I'm on stair treads, you know. And, uh--

VOICE: We've arranged a leave from your job.

XENO: Leave? Well, I'm not arguing with the Grand Council but I've got a 
pretty important job there and, uh--

VOICE: One-Three-Seven-Five-Six, you've been selected to meet and deal with 
the Earth rocket.

XENO: Me?

VOICE: You will put Plan X into operation.

XENO: Plan X?

VOICE: Citizen Xeno, every Martian for the last fifty years has been 
thoroughly grounded in Plan X, if and when a rocket should come from the 
Earth.

XENO: Oh. Oh-oh, Plan X! Oh, you see, I thought you said-- Plan X. Of course.

VOICE: Then you understand and accept the responsibility?

XENO: Oh, anything to help out.

VOICE: Those assisting you on the mission will be in contact with you.

XENO: Good, good.

VOICE: Have the other Council members any questions?

COUNCIL: (MURMURS) No. No, I don't believe so.

VOICE: One-Three-Seven-Five-Six called Xeno, you are now officially operating 
under the provisions of ... Plan X.

XENO: Well. Thank you.

MUSIC: QUIRKY FUTURISTIC TRANSITION, THEN IN BG

XENO: (NARRATES) I took the Aerial Transmission Belt directly home. Let them 
get along without me at the escalator factory if they could. Besides, it was 
almost quitting time. I went to bed early that night; er, tomorrow was going 
to be a big day. 

(PLEASED AND PROUD) Plan X. Out of the whole population of Mars, *I* was 
picked to carry out Plan X.

Oh, I'll admit I had my criticisms of the Grand Council in the past but - this 
restored my confidence in them.

Yes, sir. They couldn't have picked a better Martian.

MUSIC: AN ACCENT, THEN OUT

XENO: I think I'll have a second cup of Ostreek, Mother.

MOTHER: Xeno, you haven't time. You'll be late for the factory as it is.

XENO: As I told you, Mother, I'm on leave. Orders of the Grand Council.

MOTHER: Oh, yes, of course. Plan X. But will the Grand Council care if you 
don't get your job back?

XENO: There won't be any trouble. They couldn't replace me in stair treads and 
they know it. Pass the Gore-Rot, will you, Mother?

MOTHER: Here. But it's fattening, Xeno.

XENO: I got a hard task coming up, Mother. I owe it to myself.

SOUND: POURS A DRINK

MOTHER: And you will be careful, Xeno?

XENO: Oh, Mother, if I've told you once, I've told you a thousand times. It's 
just an invasion rocket from that stupid planet Earth. So will you stop 
worrying?

MOTHER: Ah, you're just like your father was, Xeno. Too brave for your own 
good.

XENO: (PLEASED) I am? Well, it's nothing, really.

MUSIC: BRIEF, OMINOUS TRANSITION, THEN IN BG

XENO: (NARRATES) I took my time going over to the field where the Earth rocket 
was to land. I got there at ten - with not another soul around. 

Another few minutes and I had my Pocket Radar Screen working. 

Yup. The Rocket was coming in, right on time.

SOUND: ROCKET ENGINE APPROACHES IN BG

XENO: (NARRATES) Then I could hear it out in space, and soon after that I 
could see it. Bearing our first visitors from Earth. 

Gee, I was thinking, they MUST be a brave crew.

I almost felt sorry for them.

SOUND: ROCKET LANDS

XENO: (NARRATES) It wasn't a bad landing. Not the greatest, but not bad. After 
another ten minutes, a port in the side of the rocket started to swing open 
and I walked over. If I do say it myself, I made quite an impression.

MUSIC: OUT

FIELDING: Commander! Commander, look!

COMMANDER: Great Scott! What is it?

FIELDING: Commander, I - I think we've met our first Martian.

COMMANDER: (TO OTHERS) All right, keep back, everybody! Dr. Fielding and I 
will deal with it -- him -- whatever it is. (TO PARKER) Hand me the Martian 
kit, Parker.

PARKER: All ready, sir.

COMMANDER: Come on, Fielding. And be ready for anything.

FIELDING: Right, Commander.

SOUND: FOOTSTEPS IN SAND

FIELDING: Incredible. Absolutely incredible.

COMMANDER: I'll try to talk to him. (TO XENO, SLOWLY) We - Earth people! We - 
friends! Friends? We come - from - out there! From-- (EXHALES, QUIETLY) Er... 
Oh, blast it, Fielding. I feel like a fool. 

FIELDING: Er, let me try, Commander. (CLEARS THROAT, TO XENO, AS IF TALKING TO 
A CHILD) We bring you - presents! Here! We bring you - BEADS! Cloths of many 
colors! Take - them.

SOUND: HANDLING BEADS AND CLOTHS

XENO: You wouldn't have something a little more - conservative?

COMMANDER: Fielding! He speaks Esperanto!

FIELDING: Incredible. Incredible.

XENO: Gentlemen, welcome to Mars.

COMMANDER: It's - it's almost as if he was expecting us.

XENO: Oh, yes. For some days now. Ever since you left Earth, as a matter of 
fact.

COMMANDER: You hear that, Fielding?

FIELDING: Commander, we may very well be in the presence of a superior race.

XENO: Well, thank you.

COMMANDER: You - you say you expected us? Everyone expected us?

XENO: Oh, certainly.

COMMANDER: But you're here alone.

XENO: Yes. Well, unfortunately, all other adult Martians are - shall we say, 
unavailable.

COMMANDER: For how long?

XENO: Not wishing to pry, but how long are you staying?

COMMANDER: Well-- They've taken to the hills, have they? Huh. No need to be 
afraid of us. No need at all. 

FIELDING: There's, uh, no one in your city, over there?

XENO: Mainly unavailable. But I'll be glad to show you around. Martian 
hospitality, you know. (PLEASANT LAUGH)

FIELDING: (RELIEVED) Amazing. Can we go right away, Commander? I'll get 
Connie.

COMMANDER: You can call her, Fielding, but we don't want to blunder into a 
trap. (CALLS) All right, men! Fall in! (TO PARKER) Parker, take three men and 
stay here for rocket guard.

PARKER: Yes, sir.

COMMANDER: Ready, Fielding?

FIELDING: (APPROACHES) All set, Commander. Er, Connie, I want you to meet our 
first Martian.

CONNIE: Dr. Fielding, I don't believe it!

FIELDING: Miss Morrison, this is, er, er--

XENO: Uh, One-Three-Seven-Five-Six. Called Xeno.

FIELDING: Uh, Miss Morrison, this is - Xeno.

CONNIE: (IMPRESSED, NERVOUS LAUGHTER) How do you do?

XENO: (EQUALLY IMPRESSED) Well ... how do YOU do?

CONNIE: (AMAZED, TO COMMANDER) Incredible! But he's almost handsome in a - 
strange way. And he speaks our language.

COMMANDER: (UNDER HIS BREATH, TO CONNIE) May be a trick of some kind. (CALLS, 
POMPOUSLY) Expedition Force! On to--! To--?!

XENO: (HELPFULLY) It's a little difficult to pronounce.

COMMANDER: (CALLS) On to -- the city!

MUSIC: FUTURISTIC MARCH, FOR TRANSITION, THEN IN BG

XENO: (NARRATES) We marched into the city which, of course, appeared quite 
deserted. Plan X. I showed them a few of the sights -- the canals, the Ogg 
factory, and the Hall of the Grand Council. I was walking alongside of Connie 
-- Miss Morrison -- who was most unlike the women of Mars. (AMUSED) I caught 
myself showing off -- riding the Aerial Transmission Belt with one hand. 
Finally, I took them all to the art museum.

MUSIC: OUT

FIELDING: Oh, Commander! This place! This civilization! It's fantastic, 
fantastic.

CONNIE: Look at this sculpture, Dr. Fielding. The line, the detail -- I've 
never seen anything so beautiful.

XENO: Oh, it's nothing really.

CONNIE: Xeno, you don't mean that you--?

XENO: Well, no. No, no, you see, I work at an atomic escalator factory. I'm in 
stair treads.

COMMANDER: (OFF) Everybody! Over here! Look at this!

SOUND: GROUP WALKS OVER

THE GROUP: Eh? Oh? What is it? Why, isn't that--?

COMMANDER: Xeno! Is - is this what I think it is?

XENO: Hmm? I - I'll have to read the nameplate. ... Oh, yes. Yes, a flying 
saucer. From Nineteen Fifty-Two, your calendar. One hundred years old.

FIELDING: Nineteen Fifty-Two! The Year of the Flying Saucers! Then they DID 
come from Mars!

XENO: Oh, yes.

COMMANDER: But none of them ever landed on Earth. Why?

XENO: Mm, it just didn't seem worthwhile. Nothing personal, of course.

CONNIE: I just can't get over this planet. It's so different from anything we 
imagined.

XENO: Now, here's something you might be interested in. Uh, right over here.

SOUND: GROUP WALKS OVER

COMMANDER: Why-- Looks like a weapon of some kind.

FIELDING: Why, yes.

XENO: Yeah, you see it's a, uh, paralyzer ray. Three hundred years old.

CONNIE: But why do you have it in the museum?

COMMANDER: You don't mean that weapons like this are three hundred years 
obsolete?

XENO: Well, you might say that, yes. You see, no adult Martian has carried a 
weapon for hundreds of years.

FIELDING: Well, why not?

XENO: Why should we?

CONNIE: But to defend yourself?

XENO: Well, we just have no aggressive impulses, that's all.

COMMANDER: Well, if someone struck you, wouldn't you strike back?

XENO: Mm, I couldn't. But it doesn't matter. No one could strike me.

COMMANDER: No Martian, that is.

XENO: Yes. We've never had any trouble.

COMMANDER: Er, Xeno, you're in the diplomatic service?

XENO: The escalator game.

COMMANDER: Yet you were delegated to meet us.

XENO: Yes, by the Grand Council. You see, we stopped having diplomats handle 
our important missions years ago. Again, nothing personal, of course. 
(PLEASANT LAUGH)

COMMANDER: I see. But you ARE empowered to deal with us?

XENO: Deal with you? I certainly am.

COMMANDER: Ah, good. Now, it seems logical to me that we should work out a 
mutual defense pact. Not right now, of course--

ORMY: Mr. Xeno! Mr. Xeno! 

COMMANDER: Who's that?

CONNIE: It looks like children!

ORMY: We have to see you, Mr. Xeno! 

XENO: Ah, just some little friends of mine.

CONNIE: Oh, they're darling!

XENO: What's the problem, Ormy?

ORMY: We're building something and we're all out of uranium. We need some 
right away and--

FIELDING: Xeno! Does he mean REAL uranium?

XENO: Oh, of course, Dr. Fielding. Oh, it won't hurt them a bit.

ORMY: We have to have it right away, Mr. Xeno. We just HAVE to have it!

COMMANDER: This - this city was deserted. Where did these children come from?

XENO: Oh, you know how it is with kids when they get to playing. 

ORMY: You'll get the uranium for us, won't you, Mr. Xeno? Will ya?

FIELDING: Fascinating. What are they playing, Xeno?

COMMANDER: Yes. What's the game?

XENO: I - don't think you've heard of it, Commander. It's called ... Plan X.

MUSIC: FUTURISTIC, FOR AN ENDING, THEN IN BG

ANNOUNCER: Auto-Lite is bringing you Mr. Jack Benny in "Plan X," tonight's 
presentation in Radio's Outstanding Theatre of Thrills, Suspense!

MUSIC: A SUSPENSE ACCENT ... AND OUT

HAP: Say, Harlow, do you like to make speeches?

HARLOW WILCOX: Sure, Hap, especially about the Auto-Lite Sta-Ful Battery. 
Friends, Romans, Motorists! Lend me your ears while I praise the greatest of 
the great -- the incomparable Auto-Lite Sta-Ful. The battery that needs 
water only three times a year in normal car use. The battery that gives longer 
life, as proved by tests conducted according to accepted life cycle standards. 
The famous Auto-Lite Sta-Ful has over three times the liquid reserve of 
ordinary batteries. And because every positive plate is protected by 
fiberglass retaining mats to reduce shedding and flaking, the Auto-Lite Sta-
Ful just naturally gives longer life than ordinary batteries.

HAP: And where can one get this glorious battery?

HARLOW WILCOX: From your nearest Auto-Lite battery dealer who services all 
makes of batteries. To quickly locate him, just phone Western Union and ask 
for Operator Twenty-Five. 

OPERATOR: (FILTER) And I'll tell you where you can get an Auto-Lite Sta-Ful 
-- the battery that needs water only three times a year in normal car use. 

HARLOW WILCOX: And, remember, from bumper to tail light, you're always right 
with Auto-Lite.

MUSIC: SUSPENSE THEME

ANNOUNCER: And now, Auto-Lite brings back to our Hollywood soundstage Mr. Jack 
Benny in Elliot Lewis' production of "Plan X," a tale well-calculated to keep 
you in--

MUSIC: KNIFE CHORD

ANNOUNCER: --Suspense! 

MUSIC: QUIRKY FUTURISTIC INTRODUCTION, THEN IN BG

XENO: (NARRATES) For the next week, I showed the Earth expedition around the 
city, signed a few treaties, and had several long conversations with Miss 
Morrison. Well, not too long, but I felt we were building a solid friendship. 
It was too bad it was coming to an end.

MUSIC: OUT

MOTHER: You're not going out again this evening, Xeno?

XENO: Mother! So I've been out two evenings in a row. Doesn't have to be 
fatal, you know.

MOTHER: This is that time of year you always get that chest cold.

XENO: (DISMISSIVE) Oh, chest cold, chest cold. Anyway, Mother, I have to go 
over to the rocket.

MOTHER: Don't they plan to go back to Earth tomorrow?

XENO: They plan to, yes. Miss Morrison promised to take a little farewell walk 
with me this evening.

MOTHER: Mm, don't let her keep you out in the moonlight too long, Xeno.

XENO: Mother! Why, that's the most ridiculous thing I-- (LAUGHS)

MOTHER: You just don't know how attractive you are.

XENO: Now, Mother, Miss Morrison and I are merely friends. And to think of 
anything beyond that is just--

ORMY: Mr. Xeno! Mr. Xeno! We're almost finished the game, Mr. Xeno!

XENO: Good, good! All finished, Ormy?

ORMY: Just about. It's tomorrow morning at eight forty-five, isn't it?

XENO: Eight forty-five. Anything else you need, Ormy? I mean, any more 
uranium?

ORMY: No. I just wanted to make sure it was eight forty-five. (MOVING OFF) 
Well, see you in the morning, Mr. Xeno! Goodbye, Mrs. Xeno!

XENO: See you in the morning, Ormy!

MOTHER: (CHUCKLES) Such a cute little fellow, Xeno. And smart!

XENO: Is he. Mother, you have NO idea.

MUSIC: FUTURISTIC TRANSITION, THEN IN BG

XENO: (NARRATES) The Earth expedition was camped beside their rocket, getting 
ready for take-off the next day. Connie -- er, Miss Morrison -- waved when she 
saw me coming. I waved back and - then she smiled at me and - I smiled back. 
It was a beautiful evening. We walked out over the plain, Connie and I, and 
then we sat down quite close. Connie lit a cigarette and I opened up a package 
of Gur-Kog.

MUSIC: OUT

CONNIE: Xeno?

XENO: Yes, Connie? Miss Morrison?

CONNIE: (CHUCKLES) Connie. How is it you're not married, Xeno? Don't Martians 
believe in it?

XENO: Oh, definitely. But there's Mother and ...

CONNIE: And what?

XENO: Connie ... you don't find me - a little bit strange?

CONNIE: You mean because you're a Martian? 

XENO: Not exactly. You see, even to Martian girls, I'm a little bit strange.

CONNIE: I find you very attractive, Xeno.

XENO: Really?

CONNIE: You're from a superior race.

XENO: Well ...

CONNIE: The commander may not see it but Dr. Fielding does and I do. Your 
civilization, your culture -- and you.

XENO: Actually, I'm--

CONNIE: What are the other Martians like? You know, I seem to feel there are 
people all around -- watching, waiting -- and yet, we've seen only you.

XENO: And the children, of course.

CONNIE: Yes. And the children. They've been playing around the rocket all day.

XENO: Yes. Yes.

CONNIE: Xeno, what'll happen to this planet - this beautiful planet - when the 
next Earth rocket comes? And the next one?

XENO: Connie--

CONNIE: I'd almost like to stay here. Or I wish we'd never come. None of us.

XENO: Connie, there's something I-- I--

CONNIE: What, Xeno? What is it?

XENO: It's just that-- It's getting cold. Maybe we'd better go back.

MUSIC: SOMBER TRANSITION, THEN IN BG

XENO: (NARRATES) I walked with Connie back to the rocket and then I went home. 
There was a message on the Auto-Phone-a-Pad. The Grand Council wanted to see 
me. At once.

MUSIC: OUT

XENO: You sent for me, gentlemen?

VOICE: One-Three-Seven-Five-Six called Xeno, you are nearing the completion of 
Plan X?

XENO: I hope my work has been satisfactory.

VOICE: You were selected for certain qualifications, Xeno. Set habit patterns, 
attention to detail, no strong emotional drives.

XENO: I remember, yes.

VOICE: You have assumed a responsibility based on those qualifications.

XENO: I suppose you might put it that way.

VOICE: Are you still prepared to discharge that responsibility?

XENO: Well, I-- I think you might as well know that it's been my criticism in 
the past, as well as that of a lot of other taxpayers, that the Grand Council 
interferes entirely too much in the private lives of-- Well-- Well, what I 
mean to say is--

VOICE: Are you prepared to discharge your responsibility?

XENO: What about Connie? I mean, Miss Morrison. Isn't there SOME way--?

VOICE: You know that there is not.

XENO: Well, I-- I suppose not, no.

VOICE: Plan X will then be completed?

XENO: I assure the Grand Council, at eight forty-five tomorrow morning, Plan X 
will be completed.

MUSIC: QUIRKY FUTURISTIC TRANSITION, THEN IN BG

XENO: (NARRATES) I didn't sleep well that night and Mother was worried when I 
hadn't any appetite in the morning. She thought it was the start of one of my 
chest colds. Purposely, I didn't go out to the rocket until almost eight-
forty. They were blasting the motors, getting ready to take off.

MUSIC: OUT

SOUND: ROCKET ENGINE

CONNIE: (RELIEVED TO SEE HIM) Xeno, I thought you weren't coming! 

XENO: I - I overslept, Connie. That is, I didn't really oversleep but, uh--

CONNIE: The children have been here for an hour.

ORMY: We're just about finished playing, Mr. Xeno!

XENO: Oh, good, Ormy. Did you win the game? Plan X?

ORMY: I think so. We'll know in a minute, Mr. Xeno.

CONNIE: They're so intense. Are the children on Mars always that way, Xeno?

XENO: Well, not always, no.

COMMANDER: (APPROACHES) Ah, come to see us off, did you, Xeno? Good boy. We 
counted on you.

XENO: Well, thank you.

COMMANDER: Come over here, Fielding!

FIELDING: Yes, Commander.

COMMANDER: Connie, Fielding -- Xeno here has been so helpful to us that I've 
come to a decision.

XENO: That's very nice of you but I'm pretty well stocked up on beads right 
now.

COMMANDER: A different kind of a present. Xeno, I've decided to invite you to 
come with us - to Earth.

XENO: To - Earth?!

COMMANDER: How 'bout it, Xeno? We're taking off in, er, sixteen minutes - at 
nine o'clock. How 'bout it? 

XENO: Well, it's not that I don't appreciate your thinking of me but Mother 
would worry and, uh--

COMMANDER: You see, we need you, Xeno.

CONNIE: That's not true!

COMMANDER: Well, I'm afraid it is. You see, I think Xeno is a much more 
important man than a worker in an elevator factory.

XENO: Escalator. I'm in stair treads.

COMMANDER: And if we have Xeno along the next time we come back to Mars, we'd 
be much less likely to run into-- Well, an ambush.

FIELDING: I'm afraid he's right, Connie.

CONNIE: He's not right!

COMMANDER: How 'bout it, Xeno?

XENO: Thanks, but no.

PARKER: (OFF) Commander! Those kids! They've got some sort of a - ray gun set 
up!

COMMANDER: Fielding? Is it real, Fielding?

FIELDING: Why, it - it looks like it, Commander.

COMMANDER: Get Xeno over in front of us, quick! Now they can't shoot without 
hitting him. (TO PARKER) Get your gun out, Parker!

PARKER: You mean - the kids, Commander?!

COMMANDER: If we have to, yes! (TO XENO) Tell them not to fire on us, Xeno!

XENO: I'm sorry, Connie. Really sorry.

CONNIE: Oh, it's all right, Xeno. Do what you have to do.

ORMY: Shall we shoot, Mr. Xeno?

COMMANDER: Have your gun ready, Parker!

XENO: It wouldn't do any good, Commander. (TO ORMY) All right, Ormy. Plan X.

SOUND: CRACKLE AND BUZZ OF RAY GUN ... ROCKET ENGINE POWERS DOWN AND SHUTS OFF

COMMANDER: Did you - did you fire, Parker?

PARKER: Me, sir? Fire a gun? Why, I - I couldn't. I couldn't do a thing like 
that.

COMMANDER: No. No, of course you couldn't. I - I don't know what made me ask.

FIELDING: Uh, the rocket -- its motors have stopped. Its motors have stopped, 
Commander.

COMMANDER: Well, we aren't going anywhere. Are we?

CONNIE: Someone said something about going back to Earth.

COMMANDER & FIELDING: (AS IF IT WERE UNTHINKABLE) Back to Earth?!

CONNIE: Oh, no. Course not. Course not.

XENO: Everybody - all right?

CONNIE: What happened, Commander? What happened?

XENO: Nothing really. It's just that Ormy and his little friends built a 
Maturity Ray. It takes people who are, shall we say, less advanced and 
increases their I. Q. by several thousand years.

FIELDING: Ah, it's amazing.

XENO: Child's play.

COMMANDER: Xeno, do you mean to say--?

XENO: Commander, Dr. Fielding, Parker, Connie -- permit me to congratulate you 
-- as fellow Martians. 

FIELDING: (CHUCKLES HAPPILY) Utterly amazing.

XENO: Connie--

CONNIE: Look! Here come the Martians!

COMMANDER: Our fellow Martians! Thousands of them! They're coming to welcome 
us!

XENO: Connie--

CONNIE: Oh, look at them! (BREATHLESS) Oh, they look so handsome! So 
intelligent--! So--!

XENO: Connie--

CONNIE: (HASTILY BRUSHES HIM OFF) Yeah, uh, excuse me, Xeno. (RUSHING OFF) 
I'll be back, Commander! I have to go to them! I'll be back!

MUSIC: AN ACCENT, THEN IN BG

XENO: (NARRATES, A LITTLE SADLY) Well ... she DID like me. For a while. ... 
Before Plan X. ... But she DID like me. Even just for a while. That's 
something, isn't it?
