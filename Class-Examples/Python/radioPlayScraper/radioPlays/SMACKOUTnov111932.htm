<u>ANNOUNCER</u>: GOOD AFTERNOON, EVERYBODY. THE NATIONAL BROADCASTING COMPANY 
PRESENTS MARIAN AND JIM IN SMACKOUT.

<u>ORCHESTRA</u>: THEME

<u>ANNOUNCER</u>: BACK AT SMACKOUT, UNCLE LUKE'S LITTLE GENERAL STORE ON THE 
CROSSROADS OF THE AIR, WE SEE MARIAN AND JIM AND MRS THOMAS IN DEEP 
CONSULTATION. WHAT'S THIS?

MAR: - and he said he'd be back last night. I'm worried about him.

JIM: Forget it. He probably got into a business huddle with these promoters or 
sharks or whatever they were, and decided to stay over.

MRS. T: Yes, that's prob'ly it, Jim. Or maybe -

JIM: Maybe what, Mrs Thomas?

MRS. T: (LAUGHS) Well, this bein' Armistice Day I thought he might a stayed 
over for the parade.

MAR: Oh that's right. He loves parades.

JIM: Yeah. He'll probably fall in and march himself.

MRS. T: That might even be what he went up to the city for. (LAUGHS)

JIM: I don't think so. He was really in earnest.

MAR: Yes, but if he decided to stay over, he should have let us know. He'd 
know we'd be upset about it.

JIM: I'm not upset about it. Luke's probably having the time of his quiet 
life!

MRS. T: Yes. You know there's somethin' about Luke.

MAR: What do you mean, Mrs Thomas?

MRS. T: Well, I..I hardly know how to say it. He's so..so..oh you know. 
Innocent, sort of. Unsophisticated is the word, I guess. Just the type to 
invite these confidence men, and all. Kind of a natural victim, as it twere.

JIM: That's right, too.

MRS. T: On the other hand, Luke has got a wonderful gift of gettin' out of any 
trouble he gets into. Trouble just seems to fly over and set on his shoulder a 
minute and then fly away again.

JIM: (LAUGHS) Over to my shoulder.

MAR: You'd think he'd be worried about the store here.

JIM: Oh no. He knows it's in good hands. I might even say beautiful hands.

MAR: Oh, Jim. Isn't he sweet Mrs. Thomas?

MRS. T: Well, (LAUGHS) Jed used to tell me things like that just before he 
went out and lost two dollars playin' penochle. (LAUGHTER) 

JIM: I'm different, Mrs Thomas. I play cribbage.

MAR: Corned beef and cribbage?

JIM: Nope. Just cribbage. But, joking aside, Luke wouldn't worry about the 
store. He doesn't while he's here, either.

MRS. T: No. The store to Luke is just a place to whittle where he won't git 
rained on. (LAUGHTER)

JIM: I'll tell him you said so, Mrs Thomas.

MRS. T: I told him myself, Jim. Lots of times. (LAUGHS) Say, maybe you folks 
could sing something for me.

MAR: All right, Mrs Thomas. Sit down there and pretend you're Uncle Luke.

MRS. T: Oh, I couldn't do that, Marian. I'm not a bit sleepy. (LAUGHS)

AD LIB TO SONG.

<u>SONG</u>

JIM: You know, I'd give a lot to know just what Luke is working on.

MRS. T: You mean this invention, Jim?

JIM: Yes. That and this conference business with mysterious strangers in the 
dark of the moon.

MAR: Yes, and this million dollar business. Betting us he'd have a million 
dollars. Or a half a million by the first of the year.

JIM: - and he wasn't kidding either.

MRS. T: My stars. Neither would I. I have too much respect for a million 
dollars to joke about it. (LAUGHS)

JIM: And to think that with all our finoogling we haven't been able to find 
out a thing!

MRS. T: Well, maybe after spending forty years inventing useless gadgets -

MAR: Like a pop bottle candlestick. (LAUGHTER)

JIM: - or a self dizzling whizzler.

MRS. T: (LAUGHS) Yes. Maybe after inventing all those things he's finally hit 
on something with some sense to it.

JIM: I dunno. It's a lot to ask. But now that he's - (BELL TINKLES) Oh, hello, 
there Teeny. Come in and join the conference.

AD LIB HELLOES.

TEE: Can I really join the coffernce? Huh? Can I?

JIM: Sure you can, Teeny.

TEE: Gee, that's swell, I guess. What's a coffernce?

JIM: (LAUGHS) We were just talking about Uncle Luke, Teeny.

TEE: Where IS Uncle Luke? Huh? Where is he?

MRS. T: Uncle Luke went to town, Teeny. On business. Maybe he'll be back 
today.

JIM: I hope he is. I'd like to ask him how you wrap up a snowshovel.

MRS. T: Did somebody buy one, Jim? Some pessimist?

JIM: Yeah. I sold one to Mort Toops this morning and after I'd spent fifteen 
minutes trying to wrap it up -

MAR: With Mr Toops laughing all the time...

JIM: - I told him he could take it raw or leave it. 

(LAUGHTER)

TEE: But when is Uncle Luke coming back? Huh? When is he?

MRS. T: I told you, Teeny. Maybe tonight. Maybe tomorrow. Why?

JIM: Have some business with him Teeny?

TEE: No. (GIGGLES) But I betcha he'd like to have me keep an eye on his 
lollypops for him, I betcha.

(LAUGHTER)

MAR: Of course he would, Teeny. Maybe you could do better work if you had a 
lollypop.

TEE: I guess I could too.

JIM: (LAUGHS) Okay, Teeny. Go help yourself. That will be one less to watch.

TEE: Thank you. I better start watching right away, too, I guess. (FADE OUT)

MRS. T: Well, now that we've arranged to have the lollypops guarded why don't 
you sing something again?

AD LIB TO SONG:

<u>SONG</u>

JIM: How was that, Mrs Thomas?

MRS. T: Real good, Jim. Though I must say it seems funny not to have Luke here 
wagglin' his foot.

MAR: He's probably waggling his feet in some dine and dance place in the city, 
Mrs Thomas.

JIM: At least he'll have a tough time finding a horseshoe game there.

MRS. T: Why don't we call him up and ask him how business is? (LAUGHTER)

JIM: Swell idea, Mrs Thomas.

MAR: Let's do it. We'll tell him the store was carried away last night by one 
or more unknown persons. (LAUGHS) You call, Jim.

JIM: Okay. Where's he staying?

MAR: Why...why...I don't know.

JIM: Neither do I. Didn't he tell you?

MAR: No. That's funny. We should have asked him.

JIM: I never thought he'd....do you know where he usually stays in the city, 
Mrs Thomas?

MRS. T: No, I don't, Jim. My stars, he don't usually go only for the day.

JIM: He should have let us know in case anything happened. My fault. I should 
have found out.
 
MAR: - and he'd have thought you were trying to pump him again and wouldn't 
have told you anyway.

MRS. T: We might call the pol- (TELEPHONE RINGS) There's the phone.

JIM: That's probably the old boy now. I'll get it...........hello. Hello. 
Yes..this is Smackout....what? I SAID YES..THIS IS SMACKOUT.....who's calling? 
I didn't get the name....... Who?.....Once more please.....(ASIDE) I can't get 
the name. Who did you want?..........Oh. Well, he's out of the city for a day 
or so on business. ...OUT OF THE CITY, I said.......If you'll leave your name 
I'll .....Hello. HELLO........(CLICK) Can you beat that? He hung up.

MRS. T: Maybe you were cut off, Jim.

JIM: Not a chance. He grunted and hung up. Some foreigner..I could hardly 
understand him.

MAR: That's funny. Who could be.....

JIM: The whole thing looks funny to me. Luke goes away on a little private 
business for one day. Two days pass and no word. Some guy with a garlic accent 
calls up and hangs up when he finds Luke is away......what's it all about?

MRS. T: Oh it's probably nothing. My stars, Luke knows everybody around here.

MAR: I'll tell you, Jim. Call central and ask her where the call came from.

JIM: That's a thought.........Here goes.......Hello. Operator? This is Jim, 
over at Smackout....yeah. Swell, how are you?

MAR: Never mind the social end of it, boy friend.

JIM: - you know the call you just put thru here?....yeah......well, where was 
it from, do you know?....WHAT?. Oh. Thanks a lot. Good bye. (CLICK) (PAUSE)

MRS. T: Well, where was it from, Jim?

MAR: From his expression, I'd say it was from Roumania.

JIM: Listen. It was from the city. The operator said she paid particular 
attention because she couldn't understand him either.

MRS. T: Well my stars. Who would be callin' up from-

JIM: Say either we have cause to be worried or we're all a bunch of jitters.

TEE: (FADE IN) What's jitters, Mr. Jim?

JIM: I wonder if...what, Teeny? Say you'd better be keeping an eye on those 
lollypops.

TEE: Oh gee. I guess I forgot. (FADE) I guess Uncle Luke would......

MRS. T: Well, I know what I'd do. I'd just wait until tonight or tomorrow 
mornin' and then if Luke hasn't shown up.....

MAR: Yes. Then what?

MRS. T: Then..then...well, my stars, I don't know!

JIM: Then we'll stars looking for dirty work. It's a little early to be 
imagining things but that phone call bothers me. I didn't like that muggs 
voice. (FADE OUT) Didn't Luke say anything about where he was going to stay 
when........

-----------
<u>ANNOUNCER</u>: WELL...WHAT IS THIS DISAPPEARING ACT LUKE IS PUTTING ON? IS IT 
INTENTIONAL OR IS IT.......SOMETHING ELSE?

<u>ORCHESTRA</u>: THEME

<u>ANNOUNCER</u>: MARIAN AND JIM WILL BRING YOU FURTHER DEVELOPMENTS ON THE GREAT 
SMACKOUT MYSTERY NEXT.......(?)...........
