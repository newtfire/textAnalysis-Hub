[SOURCE: May 9, 1922 Los Angeles Times article headlined: <b>TO "SMOKE UP" 
CAPITAL CITY / "Miss Sacramento" Sends Invitation by Radio / 
Picturesque "Forty-Nine" Fete Planned / Girl Attorney Sketches the 
Romantic Days</b> 

"Sketching the romantic days of '49 and inviting the Pacific Slope to attend 
the pioneers' celebration in Sacramento from the 23rd to the 28th inst., Miss 
Silvey-Pearle Tinsler, Sacramento attorney, yesterday broadcast an address 
from the Times radio station. Stressing the picturesque and unique features of 
the mammoth fete, she said ..."]



[MISS SACRAMENTO:] Greetings, dear people. I greet you one and all. I am Miss 
Sacramento, and I come to you from out the golden past, bringing to you a 
message from my home in the golden valley of dreams, my home that seventy-
three years ago opened wide its doors and bid your forefathers welcome.

Our mountains freely gave them their gold, our valleys their golden harvests, 
and our streams their floor of golden sands, our skies their golden sunlight, 
and our God the golden right to smile--to live and love. The invitation was 
then most heartily accepted. From out the vast somewhere came men--fearless 
men, builders of empires, seekers of romance, adventurers, soldiers of 
fortune, all seeking, hoping.

Many received, and in return for the gold they got they gave far greater 
values. They gave their hearts, their lives, their all in all that their 
State--our State--might live and be a beacon for the world.

But the old days--my days--are but dreams. My dress is not like your dress. My 
men, bearded, rough, in overalls and boots, if here today would be most ill at 
ease, and yet a host of you owe all to such as these. But my days are gone. 
They are but a memory.

Who has not felt within himself the longing for the days that can come no 
more? If only for a day, to feel that mad desire that lures men on and on in 
their conquest for gold--to step on a virgin soil and build a living, lasting 
monument, and live that free and lawless life that can come no more.

We cannot come to you, so come to us. I will turn back the hands of time, draw 
aside the veil of years and bid you welcome to my home again, just as it was 
in the days of '49.

"The days of the pick, the shovel and the pan.
The days of 'I will' and the days of 'I can'."

Oh, dear people, come, follow me once again, back to yesterday. Forget for a 
time your present-day lives. Come dress as I. Get out your bonnets and your 
calicoes, your mittens and your square hair nets. Men, forgo fine clothes, the 
shave and the shine, and as your great granddaddies were, be mine.

We'll try to bring the old days back again. The old dance hall, the general 
store, the Eagle Opera-house, the horses and the oxen, and the faithful little 
burro. Gambling--well, maybe "Put and Take." But

"Little drops of grape juice,
Little grains of yeast,
Would make a wondrous party,
But now they're both deceased."

But come, look, join in. Be one of us for a few glorious days.

"Let's make believe 'tis yesterday.
Let's dream of olden days.
Let's sing the dear old melodies.
And dress in yester ways.
As in the past let's look for gold.
Let's think we own a mine.
Let's make believe we're back again,
In the days of '49."

When you come to my home in the golden valley of dreams on the 23rd inst., you 
will find the latch string out and waiting for you; walk right in, put on your 
old duge and make yourself at home. Farewell!
