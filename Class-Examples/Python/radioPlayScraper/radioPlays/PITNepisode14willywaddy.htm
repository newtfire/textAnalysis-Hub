ANNOUNCER: Once again, Pall Mall's new fifteen cent cigarette, The Modern 
Blend, takes pleasure in presenting to you Miss Dorothy Thompson, America's 
First Lady of Journalism.

Because Miss Thompson's audience is the fastest-growing audience of any 15-
minute weekly program on the air it is likely that tonight many of you are 
listening in for the first time. To these new listeners and to every man and 
woman who smokes cigarettes ... I want to tell the brief, exciting news about 
Pall Mall's new 15¢ cigarette.

<u>In Pall Malls, fine tobaccos coupled with an amazing new blending method do 
away entirely with the necessity for the artificial flavorings which are used 
in ordinary	blended cigarettes. Pall Mall is the only well-known blended 
cigarette that brings you the full enjoyment of fine, unflavored tobaccos</u>.

Some of you are probably surprised to learn that ordinary cigarettes add elm-
bark, bees-wax, licorice or some of almost 100 different ingredients to their 
tobaccos. But Pall Malls, with finer tobaccos and a new blending method, avoid 
the need of artificial flavorings and thereby give you the smoking pleasure 
which only natural tobacco can produce. That is why smokers who try Pall Malls 
continue to smoke them.

We believe that you also will enjoy Pall Malls more than any cigarette you've 
ever smoked. They cost only fifteen cents for twenty, plus cigarette taxes in 
some states. Remember - They're [better - naturally!

And now - Miss Dorothy Thompson, with PEOPLE IN THE NEWS.

MISS THOMPSON:] I am indebted to one of my correspondents for the subject of 
this evening's broadcast. A woman wrote in and said, "Tell us, please, about 
the underprivileged man. Who is he? How does he live? What does he do? 

Last Friday, in his press conference, when the President was asked about the 
reform of the tax structure, he answered that he was less interested in taxes 
than he was in the third of the nation that is still "ill-fed, ill-housed, and 
ill-clothed." Who are this third of the nation? Well, of course, they live 
here and they live there, they work, or fail to find work at many sorts of 
jobs. But the greatest number of them live in the South, that part of the 
country which is richest in natural resources, richest in its birth-rate, but 
poorest in income. And the largest number of the poorest people, in the 
poorest section of America are share-croppers.

In fact, the share-cropper is the nation's problem child. His income, his 
expenditures, and his whole destiny furnish miles of statistics to the United 
States Department of Agriculture. But this evening I don't want to present the 
share-cropper to you as a statistic. I want to try to make you see him, who he 
is, how he lives. The word share-cropper partly describes him. He is a man 
without land of his own, who nevertheless works the land. He is the product of 
a war -- our own Civil War -- in which seventy years ago we set free three 
million negroes -- and set them free to starve. The former slaves, many of 
them, stayed on the plantations of their owners.

The owners themselves were bankrupt, so they arranged that the slaves should 
to furnished land, and tools, a cabin to live in, and food to keep them alive, 
and that they should plant and harvest a crop under an overseer, and when that 
crop was harvested, share the money that it brought, fifty-fifty, with the 
owner. That system, inherited from slavery, exists in our country right down 
to the present day.

The share-cropper gets his rent and keep. He is never without a roof over his 
head, and he can never starve. But he is generally in debt to the landlord, 
for his food and medicine, and other wants, most of which he borrows from the 
landlord's commissary store, and the landlord himself is usually in debt to 
the banks from which he borrows the money to finance his share-croppers 
between crops. Scores of northern writers have gone south to look at the white 
and negro share-croppers and to fulminate against the system, and most 
enlightened southern planters agree with them. But no one, not even the United 
States government, has been able to offer another immediate solution.

Meanwhile, our sharecropper lives. And our particular sharecropper this 
evening is my friend Willy Waddy, who lives in the flat Arkansas country, on 
the banks of the Mississippi and works twenty acres of cotton and corn on 
shares for the "boss". Willy is a Negro. He lives with his wife, Lagirtha, and 
his three children, Ruby Pearl, Ruth Rebecca, and the little boy, whose name 
is Mankind, in a two-room cabin, one of thousands, dotting the vast, flat, 
land of the Mississippi Delta, treeless except for the fringes of forest 
around it. The land is the richest on the face of the earth. The Mississippi 
river in its perennial floods, has deposited around Willy's house the finest 
soil washed away from the rest of America.

Up to Willy's door, when the crop is growing, billows now the voluptuous pink 
and red blossoms of the cotton, and then its snowy waves, which look like a 
wind-blown sea. And when the cotton is picked again the flat, black land is 
there.

Willy's cabin is made of boards, thinly white-washed. Sunday supplements, and 
old magazines, furnish his wall-paper. Lagirtha cooks her corn pone, fat meat, 
and turnip greens surrounded by faces which record twenty years of the history 
of movie kings and queens. Francis X. Bushman is slightly faded, but next to 
him Joan Crawford and Clark Gable are fresh and vivid. The cabin is poor, but 
Willy's, at least, is immaculate. Three things in that cabin represent Willy's 
pleasure and his culture -- a shotgun, a guitar, and a Bible. For Willy's 
meagre living costs him 120 days work in the year -- grueling work, while it 
lasts, under the southern sun. But when the crop is in, and Willy gets his 
little pile of money, and has paid off his debts, and has left over anywhere 
from nothing at all to seven or eight hundred dollars, Willy is free until the 
next crop must be planted.

He is free to hunt quail and larks, to play his guitar and sing with his 
fellows, to indulge in the church meetings, which are his theatre, his social 
club, and the deep solace of his life. And he is free to talk, and Willy talks 
sheer poetry. He talks about the White Man and Jesus -- Sweet Jesus, who is as 
real and vivid to him as his nearest neighbor. He speculates on the origins of 
the universe; on the birth of man and his destiny; on the humanness of God; 
and on the promises of a glorious life when all the troubles he has seen on 
earth are ended, and "Jesus is jes' settin' up dere on a golden throne waitin' 
to ketch me with open ahms."

Willy may be scared of a bad crop. Willy may have a mean overseer. If the 
price of cotton goes down in Liverpool, a city of which Willy has never heard, 
Willy may have a hard time buying even corn pone and sow-belly. But one thing 
Willy is not afraid of. He is not afraid of life itself. Never, never, never, 
has he questioned whether it is worth-while to be born. Never, or almost 
never, does he end his own life. Suicides amongst plantation negroes are 
almost unknown.

Willy loves his children. He not only loves his own children, but he loves all 
children. There's an economic reason for this. A child in a white family is an 
economic liability. A child in a negro share-cropper's family is an economic 
asset. The more children he has, the more land he is likely to get, and very 
early he puts the children to work. The rural Negro child has no economic 
security. But he has one security which many children do not have: the 
security of love. There are no Negro orphans in the deep south. If one set of 
parents dies -- or disappears -- another immediately present themselves, and 
the adopted child has exactly the status of the others. For the Negro thinks 
of himself as one of a great family, fathered by God.

Willy has no worldly ambition. White folks say he's lazy, but that is totally 
to misunderstand him. Willy is a first-class worker, and labors hard when he 
has to. But he considers the idea of work for its own sake as a white-folks 
mania. Work is a form of penance, that he patiently suffers for the reward of 
doing what he thinks man was put on earth to do: making love; singing songs; 
sleeping in the sun; fishing for catfish in the numerous creeks, and going to 
fish-fries and picnics; shooting rabbits in the cotton stubble; attending 
criminal trials in the court house, with the eager hope that he may be called 
as a witness, riding on trains, for the pure pleasure of the ride, and without 
regard for the destination.

Often he goes to the ticket-office and asks for "six bits worth of ride." The 
statistical bureaus list him as the under-privileged man, but Willy himself 
accepts life as a gift of God; he knows that it's written in the Good Book 
"Take no thought of the morrow". And, obediently, he takes no thought. He 
lives always in the present, which for him is part pain and part intense 
pleasure, covered all over with the wonder and goodness of God.

If Willy has money he spends it. He spends it for wondrous suits of clothes, 
dripping with buttons. For shiny rayon socks and ties, and guitars that sing 
like the harps of heaven. For dresses trimmed with marabou for Lagirtha, and 
long white kid gloves for her to wear when Willy and she and the children go 
to the circus in Memphis.

"What if the money is soon all spent? Isn't money meant to be spent? The Lord 
will take care of his own. Yesterday was a dream. Tomorrow may never come. 
Willy's boss is worried not only about tomorrow, but about next month, and 
even, about next year. To the boss, a big cotton crop this year will mean a 
glutted market and low prices next year. But Willy's existence, poor as it is, 
is poisoned by no such distrust.

Willy is not stupid. His way of life is not the white folks' way of life, but 
he often compares it, shrewdly, to the white man's, and is convinced that his 
is superior. He is skeptical about the power of government, or anyone else, to 
regulate the land. When I asked him, a year ago, what he thought of the 
government's cotton control program, and the plan to pay farmers for ploughing 
under cotton, Willy said, "Well, M'am, us done broke the White Folks and now 
us gwine to break the guv'ment."

Circumstances have made of Willy an actor. He is a master of exquisite and 
intuitive tact. He lives among the dominating White Men, whose moods and mind 
he must read and adjust himself to. He must be prepared to play the clown or 
the tragedian at a moment's notice. All of this he does, with a subtle and 
seemingly artless grace. He can instantly spot a "mean white man" or a kind 
one, "quality folks", or those whom he scornfully calls "poor white trash." He 
has enormous patience, humility, and the gift of laughter. In these, rests his 
enormous genius for survival.

In only one thing does Willy exercise foresight. He joins a burial union, and 
pays dues all his life, to be sure of a splendid funeral, when he is dead. And 
that makes sense, in Willy's cosmos. For Willy has only one certainty. It is 
that he will surely one day mount the golden steps into a golden heaven and be 
taken up into the arms of his saviour. Some time, he knows, he will see the 
good Lord go by in a glistening chariot, drawn by shining white horses, with 
the Lord's long golden hair agleam with lights. For in Willy's vision, God is 
a white man, white as the driven snow, a white man "with grey eyes, and a face 
jes' like a natural man."

And when Willy lies in his casket one day, at the Old Jerusalem Baptist 
Church, he will not lack mourners. They will come from far and wide, and their 
golden voices -- the most beautiful voices on this continent-- will be lifted 
up in joyous song!

"Da blood done set me free! 

Hallelujah!"
