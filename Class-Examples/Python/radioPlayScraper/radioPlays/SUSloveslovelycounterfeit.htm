MUSIC: INTRODUCTION ... THEN IN BG, OUT AT [X]

SOUND: FOOTSTEPS TO DOOR ... KNOCK ON DOOR ... PANEL IN DOOR OPENS

BEN: It's all right, Lefty. Open up.

LEFTY: Oh. It's you, Ben.

SOUND: PANEL SHUTS ... DOOR UNLOCKS AND OPENS ... FOOTSTEPS IN

LEFTY: Come on in, Ben. [X]

SOUND: DOOR CLOSES

BEN: Sol here yet?

LEFTY: No, not yet, but he oughta be pretty soon.

SOUND: DOOR LOCKED

BEN: What's he got on his mind?

LEFTY: I wouldn't know, Ben.  

BEN: Okay.

MUSIC: MARCHING BAND, FOR A PARADE ... FROM OFF, GROWING CLOSER DURING 
FOLLOWING--

SOUND: BUSTLING CROWD ACCOMPANIES THE PARADE MUSIC, IN BG

BEN: Hey, what's that coming down the street?

LEFTY: Oh, that must be those poor suckers, the Citizen's League. They're 
having a political parade. Yeah, there they are; you can see 'em through the 
window.

BEN: That must be Jansen, huh? The guy they're runnin' for mayor?

LEFTY: That's right.

BEN: Who's the doll ridin' with him?

LEFTY: What's the matter? Don't you read the papers?  

BEN: (CHUCKLES) Sure. Yeah, I read "Li'l Abner." Who's that -- Daisy Mae?

LEFTY: Her name is June Lyons. She's his new secretary or something, but 
everybody says she's the brains of his campaign.  

BEN: Yeah? I could use a little brains like that myself.

LEFTY: (CHUCKLES) Not that kind, you couldn't! Not that missionary kind.  

BEN: What about this Jansen?

LEFTY: I keep forgettin' that you're new around here. Jansen doesn't have a 
chance.

BEN: He's putting out a lot of publicity. He must have some dough behind him.  

MUSIC: MARCHING BAND MOVES OFF AND OUT BEHIND--

LEFTY: Yeah, but you can't elect a reform ticket in a town like this, Ben -- 
Sol's machine is too strong -- not unless you got some dirt. Some real dirty 
dirt that smells so bad people can't ignore it. And who's gonna get anything 
on Sol with half of the police force on his payroll?

BEN: Sol isn't even worried, huh?

LEFTY: Ah, why should he be? Sol puts up the dough, Maddux wins again, and Sol 
keeps on running the town.

SOUND: DOOR OPENS, OFF

LEFTY: Ah, that must be Sol now.

SOUND: DOOR CLOSES, OFF ... SOL'S FOOTSTEPS IN

SOL: Hiya, Lefty. Hiya, Benny. 

LEFTY: Hiya.

SOL: See your draft board today?

BEN: Yeah, I saw 'em.

SOL: What'd they say?

BEN: Same thing. I still got that hernia from football.

SOL: Hm! That football hernia comes in pretty handy, don't it?

BEN: What's that crack supposed to mean?

SOL: What's the matter, Benny? Can't you take a joke?

BEN: Sure. I can take a joke.  

SOL: Whatcha got on this afternoon, Benny?

BEN: I guess you forgot. This is my day off.

SOL: I said, whatcha got on this afternoon?

BEN: Nothing that I can remember now. Why?

SOL: Little job.

BEN: What kind of a job?

SOL: I got a tip some friends of mine may be in a little trouble. Something 
about - a bank.

BEN: Why don't you stick to the bookies and the gambling, Sol? You'd be safer.

SOL: Listen, Benny -- any time you think you're big enough to run this 
business, just let me know! I'll be glad to work something out for ya!

BEN: What's the job?

SOL: These kids are gonna crack the Castleton First National just after 
closing time. They got a room here in this hotel -- Room Four-Eighty. They'll 
be back here about three-thirty. You see, I own this hotel and I want you to 
go up and collect the room rent. I'm givin' 'em good protection, so I figure 
it'll come to about twenty grand.  

BEN: Yeah? Well, figure on gettin' somebody else to collect it.

SOL: What?

BEN: I said get somebody else. I don't like guns and I don't like gunsels and 
you know it.

SOL: (EXPLODES) Listen, you punk! You think you're a big guy, don't ya?! A big 
guy with muscles -- and I'm just a little guy, that's what you think, isn't 
it?! But if you try to cross me, I'll have ya crawlin' to me on your knees! 
When I get through with you, you'll-you'll-you'll beg me to use a gun on ya, 
because you're yellow, aren't ya?! Aren't ya?!

BEN: (BEAT, CALMLY) What's the room number?

SOL: Four-Eighty.

BEN: Come on, Lefty.

LEFTY: Yeah, okay. 

SOUND: BEN AND LEFTY'S FOOTSTEPS THROUGH DOOR, WHICH UNLOCKS, OPENS, AND 
CLOSES

LEFTY: (LOW) Gee, that was lousy.

BEN: Skip it.

LEFTY: You're gonna do it, though, aren't ya?

BEN: Sure. I'll see ya up there. Three-fifteen. By the way, what'd you say 
that dame's name was?

LEFTY: What dame?

BEN: That dame with Jansen. That "brains of the opposition."

LEFTY: You mean June Lyons?

BEN: Yeah, that's it.

LEFTY: Now wait a minute, Ben. You know that's poison. If Sol ever thought 
that--

BEN: You know, Lefty, Miss Lyons interests me -- in more ways than one.

MUSIC: BRIDGE ... THEN IN BG

MAN IN BLACK: Tonight for SUSPENSE, Roma Wines are bringing you as star, Mr. 
Humphrey Bogart, whom you have heard in the First Act of "Love's Lovely 
Counterfeit," a radio play from the novel by James M. Cain, which is tonight's 
tale of SUSPENSE presented by Roma Wines.

MUSIC: UP AND OUT

ANNOUNCER: This is Truman Bradley for Roma Wines. Mention the name of Elsa 
Maxwell and you picture a famous hostess, expert in every phase of 
entertaining. Mention a meal featuring fish or fowl and Elsa Maxwell 
pictures-- But let's hear it in her own words.

MAXWELL: The thought of a piping hot fish or chicken dinner naturally calls up 
for me the picture of glasses of chilled Roma Sauterne at each place. Roma 
California Sauterne is delicate, pale gold in color, delightful in bouquet 
and, even more important, exquisite in taste. Roma Sauterne goes perfectly 
with any food and tastes as good whether served in ordinary or fancy glasses. 
The one important thing to remember about this distinguished sauterne is the 
name -- Roma.

ANNOUNCER: Each glassful of golden Roma Sauterne reflects the heritage of all 
Roma Wines. Choice grapes slowly brought to perfection in fertile California's 
choicest vineyards, then gently pressed, then carefully guided with the 
ancient winemaking skill of Roma wineries to the full goodness you enjoy in 
every Roma Wine. Roma Wines do not vary, are always high in quality of 
bouquet, color, and flavor. Yet all this Roma Wine goodness is yours for only 
pennies a glass. No wonder more Americans enjoy Roma than any other wines. R-
O-M-A, Roma Wines.

MUSIC: THEME ... THEN IN BG--

MAN IN BLACK: And now it is with pleasure that Roma Wines bring back to our 
sound stage, Mr. Humphrey Bogart, who in the character of Ben Grace, keeps an 
adventurous rendezvous in "Love's Lovely Counterfeit," a tale well-calculated 
to keep you in--

MUSIC: KNIFE CHORD

MAN IN BLACK: --SUSPENSE!

MUSIC: SECOND ACT INTRODUCTION

SOUND: AUTO ENGINE ... CAR PULLS UP TO CURB ... CAR DOOR OPENS AND BEN CLIMBS 
IN

BEN: All right, get rolling.

JUNE: (UNCERTAIN) Are you, uh--?

BEN: That's right. Get rolling.

SOUND: CAR DOOR SHUTS ... ENGINE REVS AND CAR PULLS AWAY ... AUTO INTERIOR 
BACKGROUND

BEN: So you're June Lyons, the brains of the opposition. 

[JUNE: (CHUCKLES) The least I expected was a blue chin and a broken nose.

BEN: Disappointed?

JUNE: A little.

BEN: (CHUCKLES)]

JUNE: What's this hot tip you told me about over the phone? I don't have much 
time.  

BEN: What's the matter? You worried?

JUNE: Not particularly.

BEN: You don't have to be. I'm not interested in you.

[JUNE: Where are we going?

BEN: Just keep driving around, but keep out of the main part of town.

JUNE: Is it as melodramatic as all that?

BEN: Could be, for me.]

JUNE: Why do you want to see Jansen elected?

BEN: Suppose you let me ask the questions. 

JUNE: All right.

BEN: I'll ask you the same one. Why are you working for Jansen?

JUNE: Oh, I'm just one of those crazy idealists, I guess.

BEN: (CHUCKLES) Just a missionary, huh?

JUNE: Well, Jansen may not be the best man in the world, but at least he isn't 
hooked up with a racketeer like Sol Caspar, the way Maddux is.

BEN: June--

JUNE: Oh, it's June now, is it? What's your name?

BEN: Maybe I'll tell you that later and maybe I won't. Listen, June. If you 
were one of those earnest kids who stand around on street corners handing out 
leaflets I might believe you wanted to reform the world, but you're not. I 
know that you know that electing Jansen isn't going to reform the world or 
even reform Lake City. It just doesn't make that much difference.

JUNE: Well, it does to me. But there's something else, too. 

BEN: Like what?

JUNE: If Jansen wins, of course, I'll get a city job out of it. A good one.

BEN: That's more like it. 

JUNE: But I want to explain why.

BEN: You don't have to explain anything.

JUNE: But I want to. I'm a lawyer -- at least I have a degree from law school 
-- and I want to be a good lawyer. If you start out on your own, it can take 
years. But with the right job at City Hall you can build up a practice in no 
time.  

BEN: Okay. Long as it's the dough you're thinking about, we can do business.  

JUNE: Oh, it isn't just money--

BEN: I know, I know. You're a missionary. 

JUNE: (SELF-CONSCIOUS CHUCKLE)

BEN: Now, listen, if I give you some dirt on Sol Caspar that'll send him up 
for ten years or so, Jansen wins, right?

JUNE: Well, if you can prove it.

BEN: <u>You're</u> going to prove it. Three punks from Chicago are sticking up the 
Castleton First National Bank at about three this afternoon. Sol Caspar is 
hiding them out at his hotel -- Room Four Eighty. If there's any shooting at 
the bank and anybody gets killed, it'll be that much better. You'll have him 
for accessory to murder. You have your people there at four o'clock. I'll take 
care of the rest.

JUNE: Well, if we come out with this and it can't be proved, it's criminal 
libel. And that's all Jansen needs to <u>really</u> lose.

BEN: So, what do you think?

JUNE: I think you're working for Maddux and Caspar.

BEN: Well, that could be, but at least I know my law.  

JUNE: What law?

BEN: The Castleton Bank is insured by the government. That makes the stick-up 
a federal rap. (POINTEDLY) If you want the number of the FBI, I'll give it to 
ya.

JUNE: (REALIZES) Oh.

BEN: And, for your information, my name is Ben Grace and I work for Sol 
Caspar. So I'm not a guy who's in a very good position to go around giving 
phony tips to the FBI. Eh, you can pull right up here.

SOUND: CAR SLOWS, PULLS TO CURB DURING FOLLOWING--

JUNE: Why are you doing this? 

BEN: Because I just decided Sol Caspar is mean. And he's greedy. Is that 
enough?

SOUND: CAR DOOR OPENS ... BEN CLIMBS OUT

JUNE: If you say so. Room Four-Eight-Oh at four o'clock. (BEAT) Ben?

BEN: Yeah?

JUNE: Will I see <u>you</u> - afterwards?

BEN: Don't worry, baby. You'll see me.

MUSIC: BRIDGE

SOUND: FOOTSTEPS TO HOTEL ROOM DOOR WHICH OPENS AND CLOSES

BEN: So this is Room Four-Eight-Oh. Huh. Looks just like Room Four-Eight-One. 
Hiya, Lefty.

LEFTY: Sit down, Ben. You didn't take it too hard, what Solly said, did ya?

BEN: I can't say I liked it. What time is it?

LEFTY: Oh, a couple of minutes to four. It's too bad about you, Ben.  

BEN: What's too bad?

LEFTY: That you don't like trouble. You could go a long way in this racket, 
Ben, because you've got brains. Now, me -- I don't have the brains. 

BEN: (LAUGHS) I wouldn't-- 

LEFTY: Did I ever tell you how I started, Ben?  

BEN: No.

LEFTY: I was a preacher. 

BEN: A what?

LEFTY: Yep, a preacher. So help me. By rights, I still am. Look here, I've got 
the license right here in my wallet. It was one of those hillbilly outfits, 
and the Bishop -- as he called himself -- was so far away from me that he 
never ever heard about me, I guess. Anyway, he never canceled the license.

BEN: (READS) "The Reverend Richard José Gauss." (CHUCKLES) Yeah, that's one 
for the books, Lefty.

LEFTY: (CHUCKLES) I was just a kid. But I got hooked up with one of those big-
time evangelists, and if I'd stuck to it, I could've hit the big time myself. 
[And there's plenty of dough in that racket.] But you know what I did? The 
first time we made a really big take, I tied a handkerchief over my face, got 
me a rod, and sticked up the cash box! (CHUCKLES) And they caught me. That's 
how I know I haven't got brains.

BEN: I wouldn't let it worry you, Lefty.

LEFTY: That's not what's worrying me now, Ben.

BEN: Oh? What is?

LEFTY: What's gonna be happening in here in a couple of minutes. You ever sat 
in on a divvy before, Ben?

BEN: No. I wouldn't be now, except for the manpower shortage.

LEFTY: These are three wild kids, Ben. Chances are they'll be coked to the 
ears and slobberin' at the mouth with being half scared to death and half 
crazy with excitement, thinking how much dough they got, and what big-shot 
public enemies they are. And we -- yeah, you and me -- we gotta walk up and 
take twenty grand away from 'em.  

SOUND: DOOR KNOB RATTLES 

BEN: Mm. All right, here they are. So now we're gonna find out how it's done.

SOUND: DOOR OPENS ... FOOTSTEPS IN AS JOHNNY AND MARTY DRAG ARCH INTO THE ROOM

JOHNNY: (TO MARTY) This is it! Get him in here!

ARCH:  (GROANS IN PAIN) Oh, Johnny -- don't leave me, will ya, Johnny?

SOUND: DOOR CLOSES

JOHNNY: (TO MARTY) Get him over there on the--

ARCH:  (GROANS) Oh, that hurt. (CONTINUES TO GROAN AND BREATHE HEAVILY IN BG)

JOHNNY: (SHARPLY, TO BEN) Who are you?  

BEN: I'm the man that collects the room rent. 

JOHNNY: Yeah? Well, stick 'em up! Frisk him, Marty.

SOUND: MARTY PATS DOWN BEN BEHIND--

BEN: Go ahead. I don't need a rod to handle punks like you.

MARTY: This guy's clean, Johnny.

JOHNNY: What about the other one?

BEN: He's with me and he's got a gun, and don't try to take it away from him 
because it's an old family heirloom and he's fond of it.

JOHNNY: Oh, yeah?  

BEN: Now stop acting like something you've seen in the movies and put that 
cannon away. You might drop it and break somebody's foot.

ARCH: (UP, IN PAIN) Johnny--

BEN: What's the matter with your pal there? 

JOHNNY: He got shot.

BEN: Anybody else?

JOHNNY: No. The guard shot him when we were pullin' out.

ARCH: (DELIRIOUS) Oh-- Oh, Johnny-- 

LEFTY: You'd better get him over there on the bed.

SOUND: THE MEN DRAG ARCH ACROSS THE ROOM

ARCH: (DELIRIOUS) Johnny, we're going too fast, Johnny-- 

BEN: Yeah.

ARCH: We're going too fast. We're going too--

MARTY: He's out of his head.  

BEN: Yeah. (TO JOHNNY) Did you get the dough?

JOHNNY: Did we get the dough? Look at this, wise guy! Forty grand, maybe more. 
[Look at it, touch it, taste it, smell it! What about it, sucker? Did you ever 
see so much dough before in your life? 

BEN: Sure, I work in the mint.] You know how much this room is costing ya?

JOHNNY: How much?

BEN: Twenty grand.  

JOHNNY: Twenty grand?

BEN: That's right. I'll be back after a while to collect it.  

ARCH: (MOANS IN DELIRIUM)

BEN: What are you gonna do with your pal there, with the holes in him?

JOHNNY: I don't know.

ARCH: (DELIRIOUS) Johnny, Johnny, Johnny--

BEN: You know that's bad, don't ya?  

JOHNNY: Why?

BEN: Kid's out of his head already. Suppose he makes trouble -- starts 
screaming or something.  

JOHNNY: You got doctors, haven't ya?

BEN: Sure, but that kind of a doctor-- That's one more guy that will have to 
get a cut. Pretty soon you guys won't have anything left but small change.

JOHNNY: That's what you think! 

BEN: (SLOWLY, DROPPING A HINT) But, of course, maybe the kid'll die.  

JOHNNY: Yeah? Then what do we do? That's even worse!

BEN: Oh, no. No, that'll be easy. [Then we just take him out of here at night 
and dump him someplace. 

JOHNNY: (REALIZES) Oh.

BEN: And if the kid was to die, that would be one less guy who had to get a 
cut, wouldn't it?

JOHNNY: Huh? (BEAT, REALIZES) Yeah.

BEN: Well, come on, Lefty.] (BEAT, TO JOHNNY) We'll be seein' ya.

SOUND: DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES AS BEN AND LEFTY EXIT ... THEIR FOOTSTEPS IN 
AGREEMENT WITH FOLLOWING--

LEFTY: (LOW) I hope you know what you're doing, Ben.  

BEN: I think so. Come on, I got the room next door.

LEFTY: You know you just as good as signed that kid's death warrant, don't ya?

SOUND: 2ND HOTEL ROOM DOOR OPENS 

BEN: That's right.

SOUND: 2ND HOTEL ROOM DOOR CLOSES

LEFTY: The other two will knock him off now before we got time to do it--

ARCH: (FROM OFF, MUFFLED, DELIRIOUS) Johnny, Johnny--

BEN: (LOW) Now, listen, I've got the transom open on the connecting door.

ARCH: (FROM OFF, MUFFLED, CONFUSED) Johnny, whatcha gonna do? Johnny--?! 
(TERRIFIED) No! No! No--

SOUND: GUNSHOT!

LEFTY: (BEAT) They did it.  

BEN: Yeah. Maybe we better call Sol, huh?

LEFTY: I hope you know what you're doin'.

SOUND: STEPS TO PHONE ... RECEIVER UP

BEN: (INTO PHONE) Give me Mr. Caspar. Ben Grace speaking.  

LEFTY: Yessir, I hope you know what you're doin', Ben.

BEN: (INTO PHONE) Sol, this is Ben. You better come up to Room Four Eighty, 
Sol. They want to see you personally. --- I said they want to see you 
personally! --- Well, do you want your dough or don't you? I'm not gonna 
wrestle 'em for it. --- Okay.

SOUND: RECEIVER DOWN ... JOHNNY AND MARTY'S VOICES ARE HEARD MUFFLED IN 
BACKGROUND, URGENTLY BUT INDECIPHERABLY DISCUSSING THE SITUATION

BEN: He'll be right up.

LEFTY: Then what?

BEN: What do you mean "then what"?

LEFTY: Ben?

BEN: Yeah?

LEFTY: If you got any little plans, you know I'm all for 'em, don't ya?

BEN: Sure.

LEFTY: And you know I hope they come off, don't ya?

BEN: Sure.

SOUND: JOHNNY AND MARTY'S VOICES STOP

LEFTY: But if they don't come off, you know where I stand on that, too, don't 
ya?

BEN: Uh huh. Yeah, I know. (DRY) You stand right behind me with a gun in my 
back.  

LEFTY: Just so you know, Ben.  

BEN: I can see how you <u>would</u> have made a preacher, Lefty. You got a terrible 
streak of honesty in you. 

LEFTY: Just so you know, Ben.

SOUND: 1ST HOTEL ROOM DOOR OPENS, OFF

BEN: Now listen, there he is.

JOHNNY: (OFF, NERVOUS) There's been a little trouble, Mr. Caspar.

SOL: (OFF) What kind of trouble? 

JOHNNY: (OFF) Arch here, he just -- died.

SOL: (OFF) Died?

JOHNNY: (OFF) He was shot.

SOL: (OFF) All right, so we'll get him out o' here tonight. You got the dough?

JOHNNY: (OFF) Sure, we got it.

BEN: I got a date with a missionary.

MUSIC: BRIDGE

SOUND: BEN'S FOOTSTEPS TO JUNE'S DOOR WHICH UNLOCKS, OPENS AND CLOSES

JUNE: Ben?

BEN: Hello, baby! Where's my "good evening kiss"?

JUNE: Oh, Ben, please. I want to talk to you.

BEN: What about?  

JUNE: Don't you know?

BEN: Yeah, I guess maybe I do.

JUNE: Oh, we can't go on like this, Ben. It isn't right. It isn't fair to 
Jansen. It isn't fair to-- Well, it isn't fair to me.

BEN: What's so unfair about it?

JUNE: You know what's unfair about it! Mr. Jansen promised the people of Lake 
City that if he got elected, he'd clean up the town.  

BEN: All right, why doesn't he do it? He's had six months.

JUNE: Because he doesn't even know what's going on.  
 
BEN: Great! Then what's the beef?

JUNE: <u>I</u> know what's going on. The horse racing places, and the gambling 
places, and all the other places are just as open as they ever were. (BEAT) 
And I know who's keeping them open.

BEN: Of course you do. I am. Listen, honey, if I wasn't bossing the 
organization, someone else would be. People like to bet, people like to 
gamble.

JUNE: Ben, don't you see? I'm a city official. I have an obligation to the 
people of this community -- for the people who elected Jansen because they 
believed in something.

BEN: Still a missionary, huh?

JUNE: Well, I'm - I'm not a racketeer.

BEN: Maybe not. But you're the next thing to it. 

JUNE: What do you mean?

BEN: Where do you think the dough came from for that car I got you? And the 
fur coat? And this place? 

JUNE: You never told me.

BEN: Did I have to? You knew I didn't get it from a long-lost uncle. Why don't 
you admit it, baby? You're a chiseler.

JUNE: Am I?  

BEN: Sure, just like me. Only I'm honest about it. You're not. 

JUNE: Then I <u>will</u> be. Starting now, starting tonight.

BEN: What are you gonna do? Turn me in? 

JUNE: Oh, Ben--

BEN: Maybe your big mistake was falling in love with me, baby. Now there isn't 
much you can do about it, is there?   

JUNE: Oh, Ben, quit it, please! Get out of it -- for my sake! Just - just 
because <u>I</u> don't like it! Because <u>I</u> hate it.

BEN: (SADLY) Maybe I don't like it either. It's all I know how to do.

SOUND: DOOR OPENS, OFF

JUNE: What was--?

SOL: (QUIETLY MENACING) Hiya, Benny.

SOUND: DOOR CLOSES, OFF ... SOL'S FOOTSTEPS SLOWLY APPROACH DURING FOLLOWING--

BEN: Sol!

SOL: Surprised?

BEN: Kind of. Did you break out?

SOL: Yeah. Just to see you, Benny. Put up your hands. 

BEN: You know I never carry a rod.

SOL: Maybe you sorta wish you did now, huh? Not that you'd have a chance to 
use it.

JUNE: What are you going to do?

SOL: I'm gonna kill your boyfriend, sweetheart! And when I've done that, I'll 
think of something real nice to do to you. 

JUNE: (UNHAPPILY) Oh--

SOL: You sit right there where you are, sweetheart. Benny, you start backin' 
up to that door -- slow. 

SOUND: BEN'S FOOTSTEPS SLOWLY BACK UP DURING FOLLOWING--

SOL: That's a bathroom, isn't it?

BEN: Yeah.  

SOL: (SLOWLY) I think I'll kill ya in the bathtub, Benny. That way it'll be 
quiet. There won't be so much of a mess. Now reach behind you real careful and 
open the door, and when I tell you to start backin' in, you back in.

SOUND: BATHROOM DOOR OPENS

SOL: All right, start backing.  

SOUND: GUNSHOT!

SOL: (REACTS TO BEING SHOT) 

SOUND: ANOTHER GUNSHOT!

SOL: (IN PAIN) 

SOUND: SOL'S BODY FALLS TO FLOOR

BEN: (SURPRISED) June!

SOUND: BEN AND JUNE'S FOOTSTEPS TO BODY

JUNE: Is he--?

BEN: Yeah. (WEAKLY) Since - since when have you been carrying a gun?

JUNE: Just lately. Ben, are you all right?

BEN: (A LITTLE BREATHLESS) Yeah, I just want to sit down a minute. 

JUNE: (TEARFUL) Oh, Ben!

BEN: Now we gotta get out of here, baby.

JUNE: Ben! Ben, listen to me. We'll go away. We'll get out of the country, 
we'll go to Canada--

BEN: Sure.

JUNE: We can get married there. You <u>do</u> want to marry me, don't you, Ben?

BEN: Now, you know I do, baby.

JUNE: You can join the army up there. I'll do something, too. We'll do 
something decent with our lives! Oh, darling, I know it's been partly my 
fault. I know I've been weak, but it isn't too late to begin again, is it?

BEN: (WEAKLY) Maybe not. But your aim on that second shot wasn't too good, 
baby.

JUNE: (CONFUSED) Ben--?

BEN: So there's just one thing that's stoppin' us.

JUNE: Ben, what?!

BEN: The bullet hole in my belly.

MUSIC: BRIDGE 

BEN: (WAKES, GROANS)

DETECTIVE: Well, hello, big shot. You've been in the land of nod, haven't ya?

BEN: (EXHALES) Where am I?

DETECTIVE: City Hospital.

BEN: Yeah? What are you doin' here?

DETECTIVE: Readin' the funny papers, can't you tell?

SOUND: FAINT RUSTLE OF NEWSPAPER

BEN: Why can't you read 'em at home?

DETECTIVE: Because there's been a little thing that we policemen call murder, 
big shot. And you're what we call a material witness. 

BEN: Where's June? June Lyons?

DETECTIVE: She's in a nice cozy cell. When she comes to trial, your statement 
will probably send her up for five or ten years to <u>another</u> nice cozy cell.  

BEN: What statement?

DETECTIVE: Aw, you'll talk.

BEN: Yeah?

DETECTIVE: You know what you got, big shot?

BEN: Sure. I got ventilated with a lead slug.

DETECTIVE: Yeah, but that's not all. You've got peritonitis.  

BEN: Oh. I have? So what?

DETECTIVE: So I've seen guys with peritonitis before. You know what happens? 
First they start gettin' a fever. Then they get kinda lightheaded. Then they 
get thirsty -- terribly thirsty. And after a while you get so you can make 'em 
talk without they hardly know that they're talking. Yeah, you'll talk, all 
right.

BEN: You think so?

DETECTIVE: I know so.

BEN: Where's Lefty Gauss? 

DETECTIVE: You mean your faithful servant? He's right outside. 

BEN: Can I talk to him, alone?

DETECTIVE: Sure, why not?  

SOUND: DETECTIVE RISES AND WALKS TO HOSPITAL DOOR WHICH OPENS

DETECTIVE: Hey, putty nose, your boss wants to see you.

SOUND: LEFTY'S FOOTSTEPS APPROACH

LEFTY: Thanks, you funny, funny fella. Hiya, Ben. How you feeling?

BEN: Not too good. I got some plans to talk over with you, Lefty.  
    
LEFTY: Okay.  

BEN: (TO DETECTIVE) Oh, uh, flatfoot?  

DETECTIVE: Yeah, what'll you have now, big shot?

BEN: You say the D. A. wants me to talk, huh?

DETECTIVE: (IRONIC) Maybe he was just pretending.

BEN: Well, suppose I had some conditions.

DETECTIVE: Like what?

BEN: Well, like I only talk in the apartment where it happened -- June Lyons' 
apartment. June Lyons has gotta be there, and Lefty here, too, to back up some 
things I might say.    

DETECTIVE: That might be arranged.

BEN: You think the D. A. might forget a couple of those little things he's 
been holding against me if I talk?

DETECTIVE: That'd be the general idea.  

BEN: Okay. You can close the door as you go out and tell the D. A. to be 
around in about an hour. I'll talk.

MUSIC: BRIDGE

SOUND: MURMUR OF ASSEMBLED CAST ... OUT BEHIND-- 

DOCTOR: All I'm saying is that I won't be responsible. Dragging a man in his 
condition way out here in an ambulance and lugging him up three flights of 
stairs on a stretcher--

D. A.: Doc, that's the way he wanted it and that's the way it's going to be.  
All right, everybody here? Miss Lyons?

JUNE: Yes.

D. A.: Lefty Gauss? 

LEFTY: Yes.

D. A.: How is he, doctor?

DOCTOR: I've already told you. But he can talk.  

BEN: Stop worrying about me, Mr. D. A. You're breakin' my heart.

D. A.: Are you ready to start, Ben? 

BEN: Uh huh. May I have a glass of water?

D. A.: Yes, of course.

SOUND: BEN DRINKS WATER

BEN: Thanks. All right, I'm ready.

LEFTY: (CLEARS THROAT, THEN QUICKLY) Uh-- Do you--? Do you, Ben, take this 
woman, June, to be thy lawful wedded wife--?

D. A.: What is this?

LEFTY: --to love and to cherish, for better, for worse, 'til death do you 
part?

D. A.: What's going on here?

LEFTY: Quiet!

BEN: I do.

LEFTY: Do you, June, take this man, Ben, to be thy lawful wedded husband, to 
love and to cherish, for better, for worse, 'til death do you part?

JUNE: I do.

LEFTY: I pronounce you--

D. A.: Oh, no, you don't! 
 
LEFTY: (FIERY) Oh, yes, I do! I'm a licensed preacher and this is Miss June 
Lyons' apartment and it's outside the city's jurisdiction -- it's in the 
county! And this marriage license was taken out at the county courthouse one 
minute before they closed today! And when I sign it, brother --- (QUIETLY 
TRIUMPHANT) it's <u>legal</u>. (BEAT, QUICK AND CASUAL) I pronounce you man and wife. 

BEN: I suppose you've heard that a man can't testify against his wife, 
Mr. D. A.?  

D. A.: (DEFEATED) Yes, yes, I know.  

BEN: By the way, ya mind if I kiss the bride? 

D. A.: Oh, go ahead.

JUNE: (DEEPLY MOVED) Oh, Ben. Ben darling. That was the finest--

BEN: Shhh--

JUNE: (THEY KISS) Mmm.

BEN: Ah, that was nice.  

JUNE: Ben, your face is so hot!

BEN: Yeah. (EXHALES) I thought maybe I was gonna make it, baby, but I - I 
guess I'm not. (EXHALES) 

JUNE: (HUSHED) Oh, Ben. Ben! Doctor. Quick, doctor! Doctor!

BEN: (DYING) So long, missionary. (DRY, SLOW) <u>Mrs</u>. Missionary.

JUNE: (HORRIFIED) Oh, no. Oh, Ben-- (STARTS TO CRY, THEN IN BG)

LEFTY: (BROKENLY) Lord, we pray thee to receive this spirit - of our dearly 
departed - and to forgive him his trespasses - as we forgive those who 
trespass against us -- (FADES OUT BEHIND--)

MUSIC: SNEAKS IN DURING ABOVE ... THEN UP FOR CURTAIN

MAN IN BLACK: And so closes Roma Wines' presentation of "Love's Lovely 
Counterfeit," starring Humphrey Bogart and written by James M. Cain. Lurene 
Tuttle appeared as June opposite Mr. Bogart in tonight's study in--

MUSIC: KNIFE CHORD AND UNDER

MAN IN BLACK: SUSPENSE!

MUSIC: OUT

ANNOUNCER: Before Mr. Humphrey Bogart returns to our microphone, this is 
Truman Bradley for Roma Wines. Few hostesses have entertained as extensively 
-- as often -- as the world-renowned hostess Miss Elsa Maxwell. That's why 
these words of hers are significant.

MAXWELL: Back in the horse-and-buggy days, the serving of wine was surrounded 
by all manner of complicated do's and don'ts. Today, it's fashionable to serve 
delicious Roma Wines whenever and however you choose. For example, the 
delicious, versatile Roma California Tokay is a light, moderately sweet, 
flame-bright wine that goes well before or after meals, during the cocktail 
hour -- actually, delightful at any time. Everyone enjoys the velvety smooth 
rich flavor of Roma Tokay, served cool.

ANNOUNCER: While Roma Tokay is different in flavor from other Roma wines, it 
is like them in these respects: always delicious, never varying in fine 
quality, and since Roma Wines cost only pennies a glass, you can serve them 
often. Remember, more Americans enjoy Roma than any other wine. And the next 
time you use vermouth, sweet or dry, choose Roma Vermouth. Zestful, full-
flavored Roma Vermouth is blended, mellowed, and developed with all the 
traditional winemaking skill of the Roma wineries, yet surprisingly low-
priced. Try Roma Vermouth soon, won't you?

BOGART: This is Humphrey Bogart. It's been a great pleasure and privilege to 
appear for the SUSPENSE audience and I hope they'll have me back soon. I'm 
certainly going to make it a point to hear next Thursday's SUSPENSE show, 
which sounds like one of the most unusual of the year. Two of the most 
distinguished ladies of the acting profession will be your stars. There's 
seventy-five years difference between their ages. They are --- Miss Margaret 
O'Brien and Dame May Whitty.

MAN IN BLACK: SUSPENSE is produced, edited, and directed by William Spier. 
Next Thursday, same time, Roma Wines will present Dame May Whitty and Margaret 
O'Brien as co-stars of-- 

MUSIC: KNIFE CHORD AND UNDER

MAN IN BLACK: SUSPENSE!  

MUSIC: OUT

ANNOUNCER: Presented by Roma Wines. R-O-M-A. Made in California for enjoyment 
throughout the world.

MUSIC: THEME AND UNDER UNTIL END

ANNOUNCER: This is CBS, the Columbia Broadcasting System.
