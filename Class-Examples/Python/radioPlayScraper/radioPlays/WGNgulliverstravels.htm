ANNOUNCER. Some may think of it as a child's classic, but [actually] it is 
actually one of the keenest political satires of all time. The NBC University 
of the Air brings you a radio edition of "Gulliver's Travels" by Jonathan 
Swift, another in our series of dramatizations of books that live--the World's 
Great Novels!

(MUSIC. IN AND CONCLUDE)

ANNOUNCER. The NBC University of the Air presents Francis Hackett, critic, 
biographer and novelist, who will turn the first and last page of Jonathan 
Swift's bitterest and best book, "Gulliver's Travels".

HACKETT. Children delight in "Gulliver's Travels" for its gay fantastic 
contrasts. To them it is sheer action, like a Niagara Falls. But the adult 
sees relentless power in it. Later on we'll try to see what this criticism 
means.

GULLIVER. (SLIGHT BRITISH ACCENT . . . ABOUT 35) My name is Lemuel Gulliver. 
For sixteen years and seven months I sailed the seas--first as a surgeon and 
then as captain of a number of vessels. In the year 1699, [I accepted an offer 
from Captain William Prichard, master of the <u>Antelope</u> ...] while making a 
voyage to the South Seas, [... I shall not trouble you with the particulars of 
our adventures in those seas. Let it suffice to say that, in our passage,] we 
ran afoul of a tropic storm [and were shipwrecked].

Our ship was driven on a rock and split asunder. . . . What became of my 
companions I cannot tell, but conclude that they were lost. For my part I swam 
as fortune directed and was pushed forward by wind and tide to a point where I 
found myself within my depth. When I finally struggled to shore I was in so 
weak a condition that I lay down on the grass and fell asleep. . . .

MUSIC. SNEAK IN LILLIPUTIAN THEME: . . . DIMINUTIVE . . . BUT INSISTENT RATHER 
THAN DAINTY . . . LIKE THE HUM OF MILLIONS OF INSECTS . . . BUILDS TO FIT 
NARRATION)

GULLIVER. Some hours later I was awakened by a noise like the silken 
whispering of grass in the wind. I tried to rise only to discover my arms and 
legs fastened securely to the ground and my hair tied down in the same manner. 
At once I became aware of something <u>alive</u> moving on my leg, advancing gently 
forward over my breast, walking boldly up to my chin. By bending my eyes 
downward I was able to perceive that it was a human creature not six inches 
high, with a bow and arrow in its hands. And even while I looked at least 
fifty more of the same kind followed the first. . . . It gradually became 
clear to me that it was these <u>tiny</u> creatures who had made me a <u>prisoner</u>. 
[...who had bound me securely while I slept with cords no thicker than a 
thread of silk.] This is an outrage! Let me up! Let me up!

The Lilliputians--for that was the name of my tiny captors--brought me food 
and drink sent thither by their Emperor's orders, freeing one of my hands so 
that I could eat. As I ate, my anger abated. In Lilliput, as in <u>my</u> <u>own</u> island, 
the state of a man's stomach is likely to govern his thinking. I topped off my 
meal with a hogshead of good wine, then fell asleep. While I slept I was bound 
in chains and carted by 1,500 horses to the palace of the emperor. . . .

(BLARE OF A TRUMPET . . . . THIS IS A "LILLIPUTIAN" TRUMPET AND SHOULD CREATE 
MOOD OF ABSURDITY, LIKE CHILDREN PLAYING AT ROYALTY)

LILLIPUTIAN. (SHOULD SOUND AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE LIKE A MAN SIX INCHES 
TALL. . . . PROJECTING) His Imperial Majesty, Globasto Momaren Evalme Gurdilo 
Sheflin Mully Ully Gue, Most Mighty Emperor of Lilliput, delight and terror of 
the Universe, monarch of all monarchs, at whose nod the princes of the earth 
shake their knees! [...proposes to the Man Mountain lately arrived in our 
celestial dominions the following articles: That said Man Mountain shall not 
depart from our domain-- (FADES OUT BEHIND--)]

GULLIVER. (NARRATING) [One or two of the articles proposed were not altogether 
to my liking, but...] Overwhelmed by the presence of royalty I could only 
prostrate myself at his majesty's feet [and acquiesce]. Impressed by my 
gentleness and good behavior the Emperor set me free. He then had a mind to 
entertain me with one of his country's best loved shows. Redresal, his 
Minister of Private Affairs, ascended to my shoulder to interpret the 
performance for me.

(ROLL OF DRUMS AS IN CARNIVAL SHOW)

(MURMUR AND SQUEALS OF DELIGHT FROM CROWD) 

LILLIPUTIAN. What you are about to witness, Man Mountain, is the annual 
performance of our tight rope walkers.

(MUSIC. FADES IN . . . . SOMETHING SUGGESTING MUSIC PLAYED IN CIRCUSES DURING 
ACROBATIC PERFORMANCES OR JUGGLING ACT . . . BUT MAKE IT DIMINUTIVE IN 
FEELING) 

LILLIPUTIAN. Watch now. There goes the first contestant.

GULLIVER. (CHARMED) Why, he's splendid. Magnificent . . . Tell me, how do your 
people acquire such skill?

LILLIPUTIAN. They are trained in the art from their youth.

(CLAPPING OF HANDS) 

VOICES. (AD LIBS SHOUTS) Bravo! Bravo!

LILLIPUTIAN. You see, in Lilliput, when a political office is vacant, 
candidates petition the Emperor to entertain the court by cutting capers on a 
rope. Whoever jumps the highest without falling off wins the office. That's 
Flimnap, candidate for the office of treasurer, performing now . . . 

GULLIVER. He's superb . . . Colossal . . . He's a sensation.

LILLIPUTIAN. He should be. He's been at it for years. (PAUSE) What is it? Why 
do you frown?

GULLIVER. It's just occurred to me--is this rope dancing really a <u>true</u> test of 
a man's qualifications for public office? 

LILLIPUTIAN. Perhaps they have thought of a better test in your country?

(A PAUSE)

(MUSIC. ROPE DANCE MUSIC UP AND OUT)

GULLIVER. (NARRATING) My first impression of the kingdom of Lilliput was that 
I had never beheld a more entertaining prospect. [The country around was a 
continual flower garden; the towns like the painted scene of a city in the 
theatre.] Surely I thought in this setting of ideal loveliness, these tiny 
doll like people so energetic, so resourceful, must have attained a state of 
happiness and perfection that we larger mortals only dream of. . . . But I was 
doomed to disillusion. I had been there scarcely a month when my friend 
Redresal came to climb up on my shoulder and began to whisper in my ear.

LILLIPUTIAN. (UNINTELLIGIBLE BUT DISTINCT WHISPERING)

GULLIVER. Speak louder, Redresal, I can't hear you.

LILLIPUTIAN. (LOUDER BUT STILL CONFIDENTIAL) Matters of state have to be 
whispered. It would never do to let the people know what is going on.

GULLIVER. What <u>is</u> going on?

LILLIPUTIAN. We labor under two mighty evils--a violent schism at home. . . .

GULLIVER. A <u>schism</u> . . . <u>here</u> in Lilliput!

LILLIPUTIAN. For above seventy moons past there have been two struggling 
parties here . . . the Trameksans and the Slameksans. . . .

GULLIVER. How do they differ politically?

LILLIPUTIAN. Most profoundly. One party adheres to the wearing of high heeled 
shoes. The other low heeled.

GULLIVER. Hmmm. High and low <u>heels</u>.

LILLIPUTIAN. His majesty favors lesser heels in his administration. Therefore 
the animosity of the two parties runs so high they will neither eat nor drink 
with each other . . .

GULLIVER. Is there no hope of a compromise?

LILLIPUTIAN. Neither party will yield a fraction. However, some have professed 
to see hope in the progressive attitude of His Royal Highness, the heir to the 
crown. . . . 

GULLIVER. And how does <u>he</u> stand?

LILLIPUTIAN. (LOWER) He <u>wobbles</u>!

GULLIVER. Wobbles!

LILLIPUTIAN. One of his heels is higher than the other. He has been observed 
to wobble from <u>left</u> to <u>right</u>.

GULLIVER. He sounds like a young man most unusually endowed for political 
leadership.

LILLIPUTIAN. Alas, it's his father, not he that's on the throne. . . Meanwhile 
the country is split in two, and at the same time we are threatened with an 
invasion from the island of Blefescu.

GULLIVER. Blefescu?

LILLIPUTIAN. A neighboring kingdom with which we have been engaged in a most 
obstinate war for six and thirty moons . . .

GULLIVER. Six and thirty moons? Amazing. Even in Europe we are not often able 
to sustain our wars that long. . . . What started your war with the 
Blefescudians?

LILLIPUTIAN. An egg. 

GULLIVER. An egg.

LILLIPUTIAN. Now it is allowed on all hands that the natural way of cracking a 
boiled egg is upon the larger end. . . .

GULLIVER. Naturally.

LILLIPUTIAN. The present emperor's great grandfather, however, during his 
reign published an edict commanding all his subjects to break the smaller end 
of the egg. The people so resented this, that there have been six rebellious 
uprisings wherein one Emperor lost his life and another his crown.

GULLIVER. But how does this matter of the egg affect your country's relations 
with the Blefescudians?

LILLIPUTIAN. The monarchs of Blefescu find it to their advantage to foment 
these civil strifes . . . even sending their spies amongst us.

GULLIVER. (CONSIDERINGLY) Hmmmm. But what of your scholars and philosophers? 
You are a rational people. . . . Can it not be made clear the futility of such 
conflicts? 

LILLIPUTIAN. Many hundreds of volumes have been published upon the subject. 
But the Emperor has ordered all books that do not support the Little-Endian 
point of view suppressed--burned!

GULLIVER. (WISELY) I see. (PAUSE) Now, one more thing--are the <u>majority</u> of the 
Lilliputians with the king on the matter of the egg?

LILLIPUTIAN. Many of them I'm afraid have no political opinions at all, as 
long as they <u>get</u> their eggs. (SIGHS) Some of the younger generations have even 
forgot what the war is about. Meanwhile it is to start all over again. . . . 
The enemy has already equipped a numerous fleet and is preparing to descend 
upon us. . . .

GULLIVER. If there is anything I can do. . . .

LILLIPUTIAN. His Majesty is placing great confidence in your strength and 
valor. . . .

GULLIVER. I am greatly flattered. Please present my humble duty to his Majesty 
and let him know that I stand ready with my life to defend his person and 
state against invaders. . . .

(MUSIC: MARTIAL . . . WITH SAME QUALITY AS "PARADE OF WOODEN SOLDIERS" . . . 
KEEP BEHIND:)

GULLIVER. (NARRATING) When the hour of invasion was at hand I waded out into 
the channel between Lilliput and Blefescu, cut the moorings of the enemy's 
fleet, tied the ships' lines together, then waded back again with the enemy 
vessels in tow. The whole kingdom of Lilliput awaited on the shore to do me 
honor. . . .

(CROWD . . . CHEERS)

(MUSIC: BAND . . . SOMETHING IN THE SPIRIT OF "HE'S A JOLLY GOOD FELLOW" UP & 
SEGUE INTO SOMETHING SOLEMN . . . FOREBODING)

GULLIVER. But, alas, I was to learn how fickle is the public mind . . . how 
short-lived the hero's laurels. . . . Early the next morning . . .

(KNOCK ON DOOR)

GULLIVER. (SLEEPY, CROSS) Who is it? . . . Confound it, I do not wish to be 
disturbed.

LILLIPUTIAN. (OFF) It's I, Redresal. 

GULLIVER. Oh, very well, I'll let you in. . . . But my head feels like a 
cabbage after last night's celebration.

(DOOR OPENED)

GULLIVER. Come up here on my shoulder. What brings you out so early, Redresal?

LILLIPUT. (EXCITED) Lend me your finger, please. I have come under express 
orders from His Majesty.

GULLIVER. What does he want now?

LILLIPUTIAN. He wants you to bring all the rest of the enemy's ships into our 
port at once.

GULLIVER. But, great heavens, that would leave the empire of Blefescu entirely 
undefended.

LILLIPUT. Exactly. His Majesty proposes to reduce that miserable kingdom to a 
province and govern it by a Viceroy. 

GULLIVER. He can't be <u>serious</u>!

LILLIPUT. He says it is our national destiny to rule the world.

GULLIVER. Then he is out of his mind.

LILLIPUT. Not only does he intend to conquer Blefescu, but he is laying plans 
to destroy the entire race of Big-Endians and compel <u>all</u> people to break their 
eggs on the smaller end.

GULLIVER. And if they refuse?

LILLIPUT. They will be exterminated!

GULLIVER. (AFTER A PAUSE) (HE'S ANGRY) You may return to His Majesty and say 
that I refuse his request. I shall never be the instrument of bringing a race 
of free and brave people into slavery.

(MUSIC: HIT)

LILLIPUT. (OFF, LOW, TENSE) Man Mountain! Man Mountain!

GULLIVER. What is it, Redresal? Did you give the emperor my message? 

LILLIPUT. (FADING IN . . . EXCITED BUT LOW) Man Mountain. You must leave 
Lilliput at once. 

GULLIVER. What do you mean?

LILLIPUT. Listen! His Majesty is angry . . . most angry at your refusal. He 
has informed the people that you are a traitor. Articles of impeachment have 
already been prepared against you. The populace is clamoring for your death 
. . . but his Majesty has decided against that. His intention is to blind you 
instead.

GULLIVER. Blind me?

LILLIPUT. By having twenty of his men discharge arrows into your 
eyeballs. . . . Oh, he's clever, is His Majesty . . . Another monarch . . . 
<u>would</u> have had you executed. Not he. He recognizes that the loss of your sight 
will in no wise impair your bodily strength. You will still be useful to him 
. . . in fact he feels you will be even of greater service to him <u>blind</u>.

GULLIVER. (EXPLODING) What a low contemptible mean sniveling treacherous 
selfish race you are . . . (BREAKS OFF) But <u>you</u>, Redresal . . . Why are you 
here?

LILLIPUT. I could not bear to think of you reduced to this state of ignominy. 
<u>You</u> . . . my <u>friend</u>.

GULLIVER. You must have come to warn me at great risk?

LILLIPUT. The risk of my life.

GULLIVER. (MOVED) I am deeply grateful to you. Not only have you saved my 
eyesight, but you have done me a far greater service. Because of you, I can 
still believe in men. Even in Lilliput, among as low specimens of humanity as 
I have yet encountered, you have proved to me there are those [who are not 
governed alone by self-interest] . . . those capable of idealism . . . human 
love . . . and sacrifice. I shall not depart from your country entirely 
cynical.

(MUSIC: SEGUE INTO SEA CHANTEY AS IN BEGINNING . . . DOWN BEHIND)

GULLIVER. I shall not trouble you with an account of my escape from Lilliput 
and my eventual return to England. Suffice it to say, my insatiable desire of 
seeing foreign places would suffer me to continue at home but a short 
while. . . . My next voyage, after many misadventures, brought me to the 
kingdom of the Brobdingnagians--a race of giants as tall as steeple-spires, 
whose voices roared like waterfalls. Because these giants looked upon me as a 
freak, [-- at the court my lot was intolerably humiliating, my behavior 
occasioned gales of laughter, and] I became obsessed with the idea of proving 
to the King and his court that I was, indeed, a Man. . . . [And, at length, I 
hit upon a way to accomplish this.] I offered to reveal to the King the secret 
of an invention . . . an invention that up to this time is the most 
significant achievement of my race.

KING OF BROBDINGNAGIANS. (ECHO . . . AMUSEMENT) Tell me, my diminutive friend, 
what is this wonderful invention?

GULLIVER. Well, sire, between three and four hundred years ago there was 
compounded a certain powder, which, when kindled will fly up into the air with 
a noise and agitation greater than thunder.

KING. (PLEASED) What a diverting idea for feast days and celebrations . . .

GULLIVER. But wait, your Majesty. Ram the proper quantity of this powder into 
a hollow tube of brass or iron and it will drive a ball of lead with such 
violence and speed that <u>nothing</u> can sustain its force. 

KING. (INNOCENTLY) But might that not prove destructive?

GULLIVER. (THIS IS HIS MOMENT) It will rip up pavements, tear houses to 
pieces, lay waste cities, dash out the brains of all who are near. . . .

KING. (LIKE THUNDER) Stop!

GULLIVER. (NOT HEEDING) I . . . I whom you scorn know the ingredients of this 
wonderful powder. <u>I</u> understand the compounding of it. . . . I could teach your 
workmen the formula. . . . 

KING. And what would I want with it?

GULLIVER. You could become the master of the lives, liberties, and fortunes of 
all your people. Whoever disputed your absolute authority [could be--] . . .

KING. Are you too ignorant to understand that I neither have nor want absolute 
authority? . . .

GULLIVER. But, surely, <u>you</u>--a <u>King</u> . . . you cannot be without ambition. You 
must wish to live in the annals of your people. . . . Now, by the use of this 
formula, our Prince of Orange . . .

KING. Be quiet. I command you. And listen to me. I would rather lose my 
kingdom a thousand times over than be privy to your dreadful secret. . . . 
Some evil genius--[some] enemy of mankind--must have been the first contriver 
of this powder. . . . If you value your life, never mention it again. . . .

GULLIVER. (DOWNCAST . . . AND A LITTLE CONTEMPTUOUS) As you will, sire. But it 
is plain to be seen that <u>here</u> you have not reduced politics and the conquest 
of power to an exact science as the more acute wits of Europe have done . . .

KING. (HE'S NO LONGER ANGRY . . . SPEAKS REFLECTIVELY, WITH A TRACE OF 
SADNESS) Power . . . Politics. It is my opinion that whosoever can make two 
ears of corn or two blades of grass to grow where only one grew before 
deserves better of mankind, does more essential service to his country than 
the whole race of politicians put together.

(MUSIC: BRIDGE . . . DOWN BEHIND)

GULLIVER. (NARRATING) I was forced to conclude that the king's narrowness of 
view was the miserably perverted effect of a limited education. More than ever 
now I longed to be among my own kind, among those with whom I could converse 
on equal terms. Deliverance came sooner than I expected. One day while I was 
sunning myself on the beach an eagle picked me up in his beak, carried me many 
miles out to sea, then dropped me. . . . I was rescued from the waves by 
Captain Thomas Wilcocks, a worthy Shropshire man. . . . (SIGHS) But such is my 
restless nature that I had not been at home ten days before . . .

[SOUND. WIND AND WAVES.

1ST SAILOR. Man the capstan and cast off the stern line!

2ND SAILOR. Aye aye, sir!

(MUSIC: BRIEFLY UP AND DOWN BEHIND)

GULLIVER. Yes, I was embarked upon another voyage. And it is part of my 
strange destiny that in time I should have found myself cut adrift by pirates 
and subsequently saved by the inhabitants of Laputa. Now, Laputa is a most 
remarkable place: a flying island suspended several thousand feet above the 
heads of ordinary mortals. The Laputans unlike the Brobdingnagians are most 
scientific. Indeed, they are so wrapped up in intense speculation that they 
never enjoy a minute's peace. They jostle each other in the streets, bump 
heads, and are often in manifest danger of falling off the island. The really 
great thinkers among the Laputans do not walk about at all, however, but are 
shut away in an institution called the Grand Academy of Projectors. Being a 
great admirer of projects myself, I immediately asked to be allowed to visit 
this institution. At the great door I was stopped. 

1ST LAPUTAN. Your pass. Show your identification pass, please. (BEAT) Very 
good. And your travel permit. (BEAT) All in order. Now, you leave the pink 
slip with me. The white you present to the coordinator of pedal activities. 

GULLIVER. Where will I find the research laboratories? 

1ST LAPUTAN. One mile down that corridor, then turn left, then right, then 
left again.

GULLIVER. And the agricultural projects? 

1ST LAPUTAN. Two miles left, at the opposite end of the building. 

GULLIVER. Thank you very much.

(MUSIC. BRIEF TRANSITION ... LOW PIZZICATO STRINGS)

2ND LAPUTAN. Yes, I'm the coordinator of all architectural projects. It was I 
who first introduced the idea of beginning all buildings at the top and 
working down.

(MUSIC. BRIEF TRANSITION ... LOW PIZZICATO STRINGS)

3RD LAPUTAN. My friend, we're down to earth in here! <u>Food</u> is our business. 
Stuff of life, you know. I've just perfected a method of plowing so simple 
you'll wonder you did not think of it yourself. Now, the farmer plants his 
field with a crop of acorns, turns a drove of hogs loose in the field, the 
hogs root for their feed, and plow up the field! (LAUGHS) Simple, isn't it? 

(MUSIC. BRIEF TRANSITION ... LOW PIZZICATO STRINGS)

4TH LAPUTAN. Our aim is to perfect a universal language. Now, I hold that by 
leaving out verbs and participles-- 

5TH LAPUTAN. (INTERRUPTS) Nonsense, Professor X! You're only wasting your time 
with minor changes of that sort. I propose that we abolish words altogether.

4TH LAPUTAN. No! Unthinkable! 

5TH LAPUTAN. (INSISTS) Abolish words altogether -- and carry about in a sack 
on our backs such objects as are necessary to express a thought. <u>There's</u> your 
universal language! 

4TH LAPUTAN. Oh, no no no no no -- you can't do it, you can't do it, I tell 
you! <u>They</u> won't let you do away with words. 

5TH LAPUTAN. <u>Who</u> won't let me, pray? 

4TH LAPUTAN. (SADLY) Oh, the women, the women. 

(MUSIC. BRIEF TRANSITION ... LOW PIZZICATO STRINGS)

1ST LAPUTAN. The school of political projectors? Right through that door.

SOUND. DOOR OPENS

6TH LAPUTAN. (GIVING A SPEECH) I propose that, as a solution to all political 
problems, we endeavor to persuade the people to choose leaders for their 
wisdom, capacity, and virtue. That we teach office holders to consult the 
public good. That we reward merit, ability, and eminent service, and exhort 
leaders to place their own interest on the level of that of the people. 

7TH LAPUTAN. I protest! This man is a radical! 

SOUND. CROWD OF LAPUTANS JEER AND BOO

(MUSIC. BRIDGE)

GULLIVER. (NARRATING) Except for the fantastic ideas I heard expounded in the 
school of political projectors, I must say I was impressed with the Grand 
Academy of Laputa. The only inconvenience is that none of the projects of any 
of the projectors has yet been brought to perfection, and in the meantime the 
whole country lies miserably waste: the houses in ruins and the people without 
food and clothes. However, I dare say in time they will get around to doing 
something about that, too.]

(MUSIC: UP AND DOWN BEHIND)

GULLIVER. I left on the last of my travels. [I come...to that part of my 
voyages which is most likely to test the listener's credulity. That's because] 
This adventure took place in a country where <u>horses</u> (called in that land 
Houyhnnms) are the masters and <u>men</u> (called Yahoos) are the beasts of burden, 
and there was also a profound difference between their conception of good and 
evil and our own. It took me the better part of a year, to gain sufficient 
respect from the Houyhnnm at whose home I stayed, for him to discuss these 
matters with me. For at first he considered me only a cleaner and slightly 
more rational Yahoo than those he kept in his stable. The whole race of 
Yahoos, he insisted, were the most treacherous and irrational of all 
brutes . . . 

HOUYHNNM. (DEEP VOICE . . . PROFOUNDLY WISE . . . GENTLE) All you need do is 
throw among five Yahoos as much food as would be sufficient for fifty. Instead 
of eating peaceably, they will fall to quarreling and fighting . . . each 
single one determined to have it <u>all</u> to himself . . .

GULLIVER. Is that why you keep your Yahoos apart from each other? 

HOUYHNNM. That . . . and their general belligerency. Until we were forced to 
restrain them, endless battles were waged between Yahoos of one neighborhood 
and those of another. And when these were terminated they would return home 
and fall to fighting among themselves.

GULLIVER. I'm afraid the Yahoos of my own country are inclined toward similar 
behavior.

HOUYHNNM. And, yet, you tell me that in your country the Yahoos are the 
masters and the Houyhnnms the beasts of burden? How can that be?

GULLIVER. What you fail to recognize is that in my country the Yahoos are 
civilized . . .

HOUYHNNM. Civilized? What is civilized? So many of your words I don't 
understand-- Lying, deceit, power, lust, government, malice, envy, evil. . . . 
But go on--tell me what is <u>civilized</u>?

GULLIVER. Amongst us we have wonderful things such as you Houyhnnms have never 
dreamed of: Magnificent castles, gorgeous clothing, the noblest, most costly 
meats and drinks; Our ships go to the ends of the earth to bring these 
luxuries back for the rich. . . . 

HOUYHNNM. Rich? What is rich?

GULLIVER. A rich Yahoo is one who has enough money to buy these luxuries I 
have described.

HOUYHNNM. (DISAPPOINTED) Then they are not free to all.

GULLIVER. Oh, by no means.

HOUYHNNM. How many of you Yahoos do enjoy them?

GULLIVER. About one in every thousand, I should say. The bulk of our people 
live miserably by laboring every day for small wages.

HOUYHNNM. Wages?

GULLIVER. Money. The most prized and precious substance amongst us.

HOUYHNNM. (REFLECTING) What you say amazes me. Now, among us Houyhnnms it is 
our supposition that all animals have a title to their share in the 
productions of the earth. But, then, of course, we are not civilized. . . . 
Tell me--those Yahoos who do not have the luxuries you describe--how do they 
feel?

GULLIVER. They are in a continual ferment of endeavor to earn sufficient money 
to live as the rich do.

HOUYHNNM. And of what does this endeavor consist?

GULLIVER. There are numerous kinds--begging, robbing, stealing, cheating, 
foreswearing, flattering, forging, gaming, hectoring, voting, libeling, 
scribbling, star-gazing. . . . Then there are the recognized professions, of 
course . . . like doctoring. . . . 

HOUYHNNM. Please explain.

GULLIVER. Well, it is part of our civilization that we eat when we are not 
hungry, drink without provocation of thirst, sit whole nights imbibing strong 
liquors. . . .

HOUYHNNM. Most extraordinary.

GULLIVER. All of which disposes us to sloth, inflames our bodies and prevents 
digestion. . . . Then there are diseases to which husbands or wives grown 
weary of their mates are subject. . . .

HOUYHNNM. Incredible . . .

GULLIVER. All of which makes the profession of doctoring a most lucrative one 
amongst us Yahoos. . . . But I must tell you of another profession--the law.

HOUYHNNM. Law?

GULLIVER. Listen well, for this profession has a peculiar jargon of its own 
that no other mortal can understand. [...which they take special care to 
multiply, so that it will take thirty years to decide whether a field left me 
by my ancestors belongs to me or to a stranger three hundred miles away.]

HOUYHNNM. (WEARILY) Please . . . spare me . . . I do not feel equal to hearing 
about the law today. . . . To be frank, your whole discourse has only 
increased my abhorrence for the whole species of Yahoos. For the Yahoos 
amongst <u>us</u>, I have always felt a kind of pity for their ignorance. But the 
Yahoos of <u>your</u> country, you say, pretend to reason. Instead of reason it seems 
to me you are possessed only of some quality fitted to increase your natural 
vices, as the reflection from a troubled stream returns the image of an ill-
shapen body, not only larger but more distorted. . . . Do you realize that for 
all your talk of civilization, all your fine words, you have never mentioned 
the one word we Houyhnnms prize most deeply--<u>love</u>.

GULLIVER. (WONDERINGLY) Love!

HOUYHNNM. That is the law of our land. We need no other. Amongst us, love is 
not confined to any particular object, but universal to the whole race. We 
show the same affection for our neighbor's issue as for our own . . . and 
wherever a Houyhnnm goes--to whatever part of our land--he looks upon that as 
his home. . . . Thus we live together without conflict in peace and happiness. 

GULLIVER. (REPEATING) Peace . . . happiness! (SADLY) Now <u>you</u> are using words 
with which <u>I</u> am not familiar. 

(MUSIC: UP AND DOWN BEHIND)

GULLIVER. But in time, dwelling amongst the Houyhnnms, I was to learn the full 
meaning of peace and happiness. I enjoyed perfect health of mind and body. I 
did not feel the treachery or inconstancy of a friend. I had no occasion of 
bribing or flattering to procure the favor of a great man or his minion. I 
wanted no fence against fraud or oppression. . . . In the midst of all this 
happiness and when I looked upon myself to be fully settled for life, my host 
sent for me one morning, a little earlier than his usual . . . . . 

HOUYHNNM. (SADLY) It is with great sorrow that I must tell you what I 
must. . . . You will have to leave us.

GULLIVER. Leave you? Go from this peaceful country. . . . Oh, no. [Not that!] 
Don't send me away.

HOUYHNNM. It is the opinion of the majority of the Houyhnnms that we 
jeopardize our well-being by keeping you here. It is feared that you--since 
you have the rudiments of reason, added to the natural depravity of a Yahoo--
that you may influence the other Yahoos to rise up against us. . . .

GULLIVER. A thought of that kind never entered my mind. I swear it! (PLEADING) 
I'm happy here with you. I wish to live out the balance of my days without 
striving or conflict.

HOUYHNNM. So I told the other Houyhnnms. But they replied that you yourself 
had told us that <u>your</u> <u>kind</u> excels in the art of lying and dissimulation. How 
can you be trusted? . . . You must go.

(MUSIC: UP AND DOWN SOFTLY BEHIND. . . . SHOULD HAVE A LYRICAL, HAUNTING 
QUALITY.)

[GULLIVER. The Houyhnnms allowed me the space of two months to build myself a 
boat. When the day came for my departure, my host, with several of his 
neighbors, escorted me to the shore. When the wind was right, I set my little 
sail. My host and the others continued on the shore till I was out of sight. 
And far, far out at sea -- with flowing tears and heart sunk in grief -- I 
heard their last farewell.

(MUSIC: UP AND DOWN BEHIND.)]

GULLIVER. Thus, gentle listener, I have given thee a faithful account of my 
travels for sixteen years and above seven months; wherein I have not been as 
studious of ornament as of truth. I could, perhaps, have astounded thee with 
strange, improbable tales but I chose to relate plain matter of fact in manner 
and style. . . . It is my belief that a traveler's chief aim should be--not to 
form wonderful descriptions of both land and sea--but to make men <u>wiser</u> and 
<u>better</u>.

[MUSIC. UP FOR CURTAIN.]

ANNOUNCER. As we close the covers of our radio edition of "Gulliver's 
Travels," here again is FRANCIS HACKETT, who will tell you what this great 
book means to him.

FRANCIS HACKETT. Behind this fantasy, as I judge it, Jonathan Swift desired 
most of all to show man, the conceited animal, how unwise he was in his 
conceit. That was his great idea. He wasn't preachifying. He was inventing a 
story, a parable. This was intelligent. Ten books wouldn't have been written 
about Swift in the past ten years if he hadn't been supremely, enormously 
intelligent.

Swift was no poet. He wasn't exposing a good man under the tragic whip of 
Fate, as the Book of Job does. He was taxing average man, neither good nor 
bad, men like ourselves, with being cold, cruel and stupid, vain and absurd. 
He was beating down the bad citizen, just as jeering Aristophanes had done, or 
Juvenal in a depraved Rome. Or as Rabelais, who made him laugh, or Cervantes, 
whom he loved.

Swift didn't live in an age of poetry and faith. He lived in an age like this 
one, an age of arrogant reason. "Gulliver's Travels" was read by Voltaire in 
London, in a first edition hot off the press. Voltaire understood what enraged 
Swift. It was human folly; the fact that supposedly intelligent men bicker and 
wrangle politically, that they drift into terrible wars and terrible debt, 
that they are insolent in power, that party strife is blind and that justice 
is deaf.

At one time Swift was a great political columnist in London but he was sent 
back to the sticks in Ireland. In my home town, Kilkenny, I have often seen 
the name that he carved as a little schoolboy on his desk in Kilkenny College. 
He was to carve his name in literature when he raised a cry to Heaven against 
the iniquities under which the poor Irish groaned. Swift invented the term, 
"sweetness and light." It was for this he ploughed the hard heart of man. He 
and Voltaire ploughed it for a great event in the next generation, belief in 
the Rights of Man, and the American Revolution.

(MUSIC. TRANSITION ... THEN BEHIND ANNOUNCER.)

ANNOUNCER. "Gulliver's Travels" was adapted for radio by Frank Wells. The 
music was composed by a Leo Kempinski and the orchestra directed by Bernard 
Berquist. The entire production was under the direction of Homer Hecht. 
Gulliver was played by Harry Elders, the Lilliputian by Johnny Coons, the King 
of the Brobdingnagians by Leo Curley, and the Houyhnnm by Curt Cooper. Others 
were Sydney Ellstrom, Wiley Hancock, George Cluge, Burr Lee, Ted Bliss, Cliff 
Norton, and Ray Suber, and this is Dave Garroway. The program came to you from 
Chicago and was a presentation of the National Broadcasting Company and its 
independent affiliated stations.

Peace just doesn't happen. It must be worked for and maintained. That is why 
Congress has authorized the largest peacetime army in American history. And 
remember -- you have to be <u>good</u> to be in the regular army today.
