MUSIC: CHORD

ANNOUNCER: --SUSPENSE! 

MUSIC: CHORD FADES OUT

SOUND: HOSPITAL ROOM DOOR OPENS ... NURSE AND SUPERINTENDENT'S STEPS IN

DRIVER: Nurse? 

NURSE: Yes. There's someone to see you. 

DRIVER: Yeah? 

NURSE: This is Superintendent Andrews of the state institution. 

DRIVER: Oh. What - what d'you got there? 

SUPER: I've set up a dictaphone out in the hall. Careful of the wire, nurse, 
when you close the door, please. 

NURSE: The doctor said [not to keep him]-- 

SUPER: Yes, yes, I'll make it as brief as possible. You may go now, nurse. 

NURSE: Very well.

SOUND: NURSE'S STEPS TO DOOR, WHICH CLOSES AS SHE EXITS

SUPER: Oh, do you mind if I hook up this microphone at the head of the bed? 

DRIVER: Suit yourself, fella. 

SOUND: MICROPHONE HOOKED TO BED

SUPER: Well, it was a choice between a dictaphone and a stenographer, and I 
figured that in your condition-- 

DRIVER: I don't feel too bad. (BEAT) Well, go on, ask your questions. 

SUPER: Now, I - I understand you were driving the bus. Er, tell me what 
happened.

DRIVER: You mean I can tell it in my own way? 

SUPER: That's right. 

DRIVER: Great. I had an uncle once, you know, that was a writer. He wouldn't 
have gone near this kind of a story, though, with a ten-foot pen. No, he went 
in for <u>happy</u> endings. 

MUSIC: OMINOUS TRANSITION ... THEN IN BG--

DRIVER: (NARRATES) Uncle Mort wouldn't even have liked the beginning of this 
one. Kind of dreary-like up there at the asylum that afternoon. Do you 
remember? There'd been quite a snowfall the week before. And, far as the eye 
could see, everything was a dirty gray, like a corpse that's been waitin' too 
long for the undertaker. Well, around four o'clock it got so dark the lights 
had to be turned on in the asylum. (<u>SOUND: WIND MOANS</u>) And then the wind 
started moanin' like a lonely banshee. Fine day for a murder, as the fella 
said. 

MUSIC: UP FOR AN ACCENT ... THEN BEHIND DRIVER--

DRIVER: (NARRATES) Well, there were three passengers sittin' in the bus when I 
went outside for the return trip -- two men and a woman. Maybe I ought to call 
her a girl 'cuz she wasn't really much more than that. Anyway, these three 
passengers all had return tickets and I went down the aisle collectin' them. 

SOUND: WIND CONTINUES IN BG ... DRIVER'S STEPS IN BUS AISLE, IN AGREEMENT WITH 
FOLLOWING--

DRIVER: Tickets, please. May I have you tickets, please? 

GIRL: (NERVOUS) Driver? Driver, how soon do we start? 

DRIVER: Right away, miss. 

WILLARD: (FIDGETY) But we're two minutes late already, driver! Oh, these 
little jerkwater bus lines never keep to their schedules. Now we'll never get 
out of these mountains before that blizzard lets loose. 

DRIVER: Can I have your ticket please, mister? 

GIRL: Do you really think there'll be a storm? 

WILLARD: Why, sure, sure, it can't fail. And, lady, when they have snow up in 
these godforsaken mountains-- Well, this morning on the bus coming up, a man 
was telling me--

SOUND: BUS ENGINE STARTS 

DRIVER: (OFF) Well, here we go, folks! 

SOUND: RUNNING BUS INTERIOR ... THEN IN BG

MUSIC: IN AND BEHIND DRIVER--

DRIVER: (NARRATES) The windbag was sittin' right across the aisle from the 
girl, second row from the front. Halfway back in the bus sat the third 
passenger, all huddled up in his overcoat. He didn't open his trap. Well, that 
was the picture as we swung out onto the highway for the return trip. And this 
guy in back of me seemed to be itchy to start a conversation with somebody as 
soon as we got rollin'. 

WILLARD: Well-- (CLEARS THROAT) Might as well get acquainted, miss. (CHUCKLES) 
Fifty miles before we get down to civilization, you know. Er, John Willard is 
the name. (NO RESPONSE) I said, er--

GIRL: (DISTRACTED) What? Oh. I - I beg your pardon. Were you speaking to me? 

WILLARD: Well, er, yes.

GIRL: I'm afraid I - I was [thinking of]-- 

WILLARD: (INTERRUPTS, SYMPATHETIC) Yeah, sure, sure. These visits to the 
asylum, they're always depressing, aren't they? 

GIRL: Well, this - this is my first time. 

WILLARD: Oh? Er, some friend? 

GIRL: My husband. 

WILLARD: (TAKEN ABACK) Husband--? Oh, well now, that's too bad. I - I hope 
he-- 

SOUND: DURING ABOVE, ASYLUM SIREN BEGINS TO WAIL ... CONTINUES IN BG

WILLARD: (STARTLED) Hey, what's that? 

GIRL: (ALARMED) Some kind of a siren! 

DRIVER: (AMUSED) Yeah, that's the asylum alarm, all right. 

GIRL: But, driver, what--? 

DRIVER: One of the inmates must be playin' hide-and-seek with the keepers. 
Happens every once in a while.

WILLARD: Gosh. What if it's my brother? 

DRIVER: Oh? He the "bustin' out" kind? 

WILLARD: Well, it kind of upsets him to see one of the family. But then if we 
don't come to see him, it upsets him even more.

DRIVER: I see what you mean. 

GIRL: (WORRIED) Do they--? Do they always catch them?

DRIVER: (LIGHTLY) Well, they tell me the place has never lost a customer yet. 

GIRL: Oh. 

SOUND: ASYLUM SIREN OUT ... SLOWLY APPROACHING POLICE SIREN, IN BG

GIRL: (SADLY) You know, a moment ago I - I was praying that it wasn't Jim, but 
now I don't know. Even if they had to-- Well, I mean, it would-- It would be 
better than seeing him as he was today. Anything would be better than--

WILLARD: (INTERRUPTS) Listen, listen! 

DRIVER: Hey, that's a police siren. 

WILLARD: Sounds like they're almost on top of us. (BEAT) Yes, there they are. 
There they are. 

SOUND: POLICE SIREN GROWS LOUDER

GIRL: Look out! Look out, they're going to pass us!

DRIVER: Pass nothin'. They're flaggin' me down. 

SOUND: BUS PULLS TO A STOP ... SIRENS OUT AS POLICE PULL TO A STOP

DRIVER: All right, just keep your seats, everybody. 

WILLARD: (BREATHES NERVOUSLY) They're guards! 

GIRL: (DISMAYED) With rifles. 

SOUND: BUS DOOR OPENS ... HARSH WIND BLOWS A LITTLE LOUDER, BRIEFLY ... 
GUARDS' STEPS ONTO BUS, THEN IN AGREEMENT WITH FOLLOWING--

1ST GUARD: Hey, we're, uh-- We're lookin' for somebody.

DRIVER: Yeah, we heard the asylum alarm. Is someone, er--?

1ST GUARD: Seen anyone along the road? 

DRIVER: Not even a jackrabbit. 

GIRL: Officer, who escaped? 

1ST GUARD: Gregg. Albert Gregg. 

GIRL: (RELIEVED) Oh. 

WILLARD: Whew! What a relief.

1ST GUARD: Hey, Hawley, take yourself a walk down the aisle and keep your 
rifle ready when you look behind those back seats. 

2ND GUARD: (MOVING OFF) Are you kiddin'?

SOUND: GUARD'S STEPS DOWN AISLE ... THEN IN AGREEMENT WITH FOLLOWING--

DRIVER: When was this comin'-out party? 

1ST GUARD: I don't know. Maybe as much as a couple hours ago.

WILLARD: Does this Gregg have a gun? 

1ST GUARD: Can't guarantee he hasn't. But it was a file that sprung him. A 
tiny steel file. He must have been workin' away at the bars since the day he 
was committed, a month ago. 

GIRL: (GRIM, HALF TO HERSELF) His stay was short. 

2ND GUARD: (OFF) Nobody back here. 

1ST GUARD: Okay. Now check the gents for identification. You know how it is, 
driver. Ya can't take chances. 

DRIVER: Oh, of course not. Here's mine. 

1ST GUARD: (MILDLY SURPRISED AND AMUSED) Huh? Oh, okay, driver. 

2ND GUARD: (OFF) Uh, your name Frank Kenniston? 

KENNISTON: (BEAT, SNIDE, OFF) You can read, can't you?

2ND GUARD: (OFF) Huh! Friendly cuss, ain't you? 

DRIVER: (LOW, TO 1ST GUARD) You know, that's the first peep that passenger has 
let out. I was beginnin' to think he was a deaf-mute. 

1ST GUARD: Yeah? Well, here, driver. You can have this stuff back.

DRIVER: Oh, thanks. 

2ND GUARD: (CLOSER, READS I.D.) "John Willard"? 

WILLARD: Yes, sir. 

2ND GUARD: (SATISFIED) Okey-doke. (TO 1ST GUARD) Come on, Denton, let's scram. 
We gotta find Gregg before he finds anybody.

1ST GUARD: Yeah. Hey, driver, you can turn around now and go back.

GIRL: Go back? 

DRIVER: Go back? Why? 

WILLARD: Oh, no, no-- 

1ST GUARD: This Gregg is a killer. [A ruthless, senseless killer.] What I mean 
is, when the mood strikes him, <u>he</u> strikes. 

DRIVER: Well, what's that gotta do with us turnin' back? 

1ST GUARD: Didn't I tell you this man kills even without reason? Now he's got 
plenty of reason. He's got to get out of these mountains but quick. If he's 
down the road, there are lots of ways he could stop a bus. I say turn back. 

WILLARD: (EXPLODES) But that blizzard's liable to break any minute now. We 
could be snowbound up here for days! And if I have to spend another-- Even a 
night! One night in that asylum, so help me, they'd have to keep me there. 
(DESPERATELY) Oh, listen, driver. Listen to me, please--

DRIVER: (INTERRUPTS) Just a second, Mr. Willard. You're just one passenger. 
There are three. Now, let's take a vote. What about you, miss? 

GIRL: (HELPLESSLY) I - I-- Whatever you say. 

DRIVER: Mr., er, Kenniston? 

KENNISTON: (GRIM) I say keep going. 

DRIVER: That settles it. 

2ND GUARD: Hurry up, Denton. 

GIRL: Wait a minute. Uh, what - what does this "Killer Gregg" look like? 

1ST GUARD: Oh, our description says, er, slight build, weight about a hundred 
and forty. 

2ND GUARD: Uh, dark hair, brown eyes, twenty-seven years old. (TO 1ST GUARD) 
Denton, get the lead out of your breeches. 

1ST GUARD: Yeah, but you know I still think-- 

2ND GUARD: (INTERRUPTS) We warned 'em, didn't we? Now if they meet up with 
him, it's <u>their</u> funeral. 

SOUND: GUARDS' STEPS OFF THE BUS

DRIVER: (AMUSED) Yeah. Well, we can take care of ourselves, fellas. 

MUSIC: FOREBODING ... THEN BEHIND DRIVER--

SOUND: BUS ENGINE STARTS ... RUNNING BUS INTERIOR BACKGROUND

DRIVER: (NARRATES) Well, after the guards left I really set that bus to 
rollin'. Out of the mirror up above the driver's seat I could see that the 
girl was plenty scared. But she had nerve, I'll say that for her. (<u>SOUND: BUS 
TIRES SQUEAL ROUNDING CURVES ON SNOWY ROAD</u>) When we slid around some of those 
snowbanked curves, her lips would be drawn so tight the lipstick had a white 
border. But she didn't say boo. (<u>SOUND: TIRES OUT</u>) Willard, the windbag across 
the aisle from her, gave up trying to draw her into a conversation. And as for 
the third passenger -- that English guy, Kenniston, sittin' halfway towards 
the back there -- he kept actin' like a clam afraid of losin' its oyster. 
Might as well have had lockjaw -- if you get what I mean. 

MUSIC: UP TO FILL A PAUSE ... THEN BEHIND DRIVER--

SOUND: WIND HOWLS HARSHLY, IN BG

DRIVER: (NARRATES) Well, we hadn't gone more than another mile or two before 
the wind started to rise and kept it up until you'd have thought all the 
devils in hell were tryin' to break loose. It got black as the inside of a 
tomb, until the snow started to fall. But with that wind whippin' it around, 
it didn't exactly "fall." Mister, that's what I call a blizzard.

SOUND: RUNNING BUS INTERIOR AND HOWLING WIND, IN BG

WILLARD: (EXPLODES) This is getting on my nerves! What have we got here anyway 
-- a collection of zombies?! Somebody say something! 

GIRL: (PENSIVE) Ah, I was just going to say--

WILLARD: (INTERRUPTS) You were going to say that the weather is rotten. 

DRIVER: Yeah, and she can say <u>that</u> again. 

GIRL: But that isn't what I was going to say.

WILLARD: No? What then, lady? 

GIRL: It - it occurred to me <u>why</u> the guards asked for identification. 

WILLARD: Huh?

GIRL: The description of Killer Gregg: slight build, hundred and forty pounds, 
dark hair, brown eyes, twenty-seven years old--

WILLARD: So what?

GIRL: It's a remarkable thing. That description would fit you, Mr. Willard. 

WILLARD: Huh? (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY) Oh? 

GIRL: And Mr. Kenniston, too. 

KENNISTON: What's that? Me? 

GIRL: That's a peculiar thing. Isn't it, driver? 

DRIVER: Yeah. Come to think of it, both of them <u>could</u> fit that description. 
And I've also heard that he's got a very soft face -- almost like a woman. 

WILLARD: (SUSPICIOUS) What do <u>you</u> think, Mr. Kenniston?  

KENNISTON: I don't happen to feel like talking. 

WILLARD: Yeah? Well, personally I think-- The more I think of what she said, 
the more remarkable it becomes. 

DRIVER: Yeah, she's got somethin' there. 

WILLARD: Only remarkable isn't the word. 

GIRL: Well, what do you mean, Mr. Willard? [What are you thinking?]

WILLARD: This man Gregg may be insane, but he's not dumb. Now, put yourself in 
his place. He knows he hasn't got a ghost of a chance making a getaway in the 
asylum clothing, see? So he <u>borrows</u> the wardrobe and identification of some 
stranger. Do you follow me? 

DRIVER: We're way ahead of you, Willard. 

GIRL: It - it wouldn't be difficult for a killer.

DRIVER: I should say not, but that still isn't the end of his problems, see? 
He's fightin' against time. 

WILLARD: (EXCITEDLY) Yes! He's got to get out of these godforsaken mountains, 
down to civilization, before they can throw a noose around the whole area. And 
he knows -- he knows! -- if he's brought back alive, he'll be wearing a 
straitjacket -- (SOBERLY) until he's old as Methuselah. 

DRIVER: (AMUSED) You've got quite an imagination, Willard. 

WILLARD: Yeah? Well, thanks. (RESUMES INTENSELY) Now, the odds that Gregg will 
be able to get himself transportation are mighty slim, <u>except</u>--! (QUIET 
REALIZATION) Except for this bus line. So let's suppose--

KENNISTON: You've got a great imagination, all right. You've got it all 
figured out. Bit too pat, if you ask me. Remember please, sir -- <u>you're</u> the 
one who was so dead set against turning back. 

WILLARD: (EXPLODES, DEFIANT) Really, Kenniston? Well, I leave it to the lady 
here and the driver! Do I act like a lunatic?! Huh? (NO ANSWER) Well?! 

DRIVER: (AMUSED) Search me. 

GIRL: (THOUGHTFUL) There were times -- long periods of time -- when Jim 
didn't, either. My husband I mean. That was the terrible part of it. He'd be-- 
He'd be just like the old days and we'd be so happy together and then-- And 
then all of a sudden, just without warning, he - he-- 

DRIVER: (LIGHTLY) Oh, I heard o' lots of cases like that. Why, they tell me 
that sometimes it takes half a dozen of those, er, special doctors-- Those, 
er-- 

WILLARD: (UNHAPPY) Psychiatrists? 

DRIVER: Yeah, psychiatrists! Yeah. Well, sometimes they gotta put a person 
under a microscope and study 'em for a long time before they can be sure, one 
way or the other. (CHUCKLES) And many's the time they make mistakes. Why, I 
heard of one time when-- 

WILLARD: (EXPLODES) Shut up! Nobody's gonna talk like that about me! It's 
Kenniston that's been acting crazy! And I'll bet it wouldn't take a half a 
dozen psychiatrists to--!

SOUND: OMINOUS RUMBLE, IN BG

GIRL: (INTERRUPTS) But-- What's that?! 

WILLARD: Huh?

SOUND: DURING ABOVE, OMINOUS RUMBLE BUILDS UP ... THEN GROWS LOUDER, IN BG

KENNISTON: An avalanche!

DRIVER: An avalanche! 

GIRL: No!

DRIVER: It's comin' down on us! Look out! 

SOUND: PASSENGERS SCREAM IN TERROR AS THE AVALANCHE CRASHES THUNDEROUSLY INTO 
THE BUS

MUSIC: BIG ACCENT! FOR AN AVALANCHE ... THEN TAPERING OFF ... FILLS A PAUSE 
... THEN BEHIND ANNOUNCER--

ANNOUNCER: For SUSPENSE, Roma Wines are bringing you as star Elliott Reid, in 
"Return Trip," a radio play by Maurice Zimm, Roma Wines' presentation tonight 
in radio's outstanding theatre of thrills, SUSPENSE!

MUSIC: UP FOR SUSPENSE TAG ... THEN OUT

TRUMAN BRADLEY: Between the acts of SUSPENSE, this is Truman Bradley for Roma 
Wines. Nowadays, renewing old friendships interrupted by the war is a popular 
American pastime. For most of us, hardly a week goes by without some friend of 
pre-war vintage dropping in to say hello. Well, that's one of the reasons so 
many Americans keep Roma California sherry on hand, <u>always</u>. For the gold and 
amber radiance and tempting nutlike richness of Roma sherry capture the very 
spirit of gracious hospitality. And Roma sherry does more than welcome guests. 
Roma sherry is the perfect first call to dinner -- the happy, mellow, moderate 
wine that suits your every entertaining need. Like the other fine Roma 
California dessert wines -- Roma port, Roma muscatel, and Roma tokay -- Roma 
sherry is a true wine, from just the luscious goodness of the finest grapes, 
patiently guided to taste perfection by Roma winemaking skill and resources 
unmatched in America. That's why Roma is America's favorite wine -- why more 
Americans enjoy Roma than any other wine. So insist on Roma, R-O-M-A, Roma 
Wines, and enjoy unvarying goodness at reasonable cost, <u>always</u>. 

MUSIC: THEME, IN BG

ANNOUNCER: And now Roma Wines bring back to our Hollywood sound stage Elliott 
Reid, starring with Wally Maher as Mr. Willard, Cathy Lewis as the girl, and 
Raymond Lawrence as Mr. Kenniston, in "Return Trip," a tale well-calculated to 
keep you in--

MUSIC: CHORD 

ANNOUNCER: --SUSPENSE!

MUSIC: CHORD FADES OUT

DRIVER: (GENIAL) Well, superintendent, what do you think of the yarn so far? 

SUPER: (BUSINESSLIKE) Let's hear the rest of it.

DRIVER: Okay, okay -- if you'll help me get a swig of that water.

SUPER: Sure. 

DRIVER: The way they got me rigged up here-- 

SOUND: GLASS OF WATER

DRIVER: Ah, thanks. (DRINKS, EXHALES) 

SOUND: GLASS OF WATER SET DOWN

DRIVER: (EXHALES) Let's see now, where was I? Oh, yeah. (LIGHTLY) Acts two, 
three, and four comin' up.

MUSIC: GRIM TRANSITION ... THEN BEHIND DRIVER--

DRIVER: (NARRATES) Well, after the avalanche struck, I just sat there grippin' 
the steering wheel, sort of stunned. There wasn't a sound except for the wind 
-- (<u>SOUND: HARSH WIND BLOWS, NEVER STOPPING, IN BG, THROUGHOUT ALL OF NEXT 
SCENES</u>) -- and that was muffled by the snow barrier that packed us in. Even on 
the far side, the bus was buried up to the middle of the windows. Well, all 
this was only a matter of seconds, I suppose. And then suddenly the quiet was 
broken by the most gosh-awful racket. (<u>SOUND: PANICKING PASSENGERS YELL AND 
POUND ON WINDOWS, IN BG</u>) It was as if somebody had up and given the signal for 
my passengers to go completely nuts!

GIRL: (HYSTERICAL) Get me out of here! <u>Get</u> <u>me</u> <u>out</u> <u>of</u> <u>here</u>!

KENNISTON: Look out! Willard's got an axe!

GIRL: The axe! Take it away from him!

SOUND: POUNDING STOPS ... VIOLENT SCUFFLE, IN BG

DRIVER: (WITH EFFORT) Let go of it, Willard! Let go of that axe or I'll--!

WILLARD: No! No!

SOUND: DRIVER STRIKES WILLARD

WILLARD: (GROANS IN PAIN, FALLS UNCONSCIOUS)

SOUND: BODY AND AXE THUD TO BUS FLOOR

DRIVER: (EXHALES) That did it. 

GIRL: (EXHALES, WITH CERTAINTY) He's the one! He is the one! 

KENNISTON: Lucky I saw him grab that fire-axe. That's what the district 
attorney likes to call a - a lethal weapon.

DRIVER: And then some! 

WILLARD: (WAKES, GROANS)

DRIVER: Step back. He's comin' to. 

KENNISTON: Tie him up. 

DRIVER: You'll find a rope in the dashboard compartment. Get it for me.

SOUND: KENNISTON'S STEPS AWAY 

WILLARD: (GROGGY) Driver, I'll report you for this. 

DRIVER: (AMUSED) You will, huh? 

WILLARD: I was going to smash a window so we could get out of here. 

DRIVER: (SKEPTICAL) Oh, yeah? 

WILLARD: Sure. What did you think I--? (REALIZES) Oh. Oh, so that's it, eh? 

SOUND: KENNISTON'S STEPS RETURN

KENNISTON: Here's the rope, driver.

WILLARD: Now look here! Wait a minute, you can't do this! You can't tie me up, 
you fools! I'm not Killer Gregg! 

GIRL: (UNCERTAIN) May-maybe he isn't. 

DRIVER: Maybe. But like that guard said, we can't take chances. (TO WILLARD) 
If you're innocent, mister, you can prove it to the authorities. 

WILLARD: If we ever live that long! Have you forgotten we're trapped here by 
an avalanche in a blizzard that could go on and on and on?! 

DRIVER: Just the same, I-- 

GIRL: (SUDDENLY LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY) This is ridiculous! (KEEPS LAUGHING, IN 
BG)

DRIVER: (MYSTIFIED) Hey, missy -- you feelin' all right? 

GIRL: No. (STOPS LAUGHING, APOLOGETIC) I'm not crazy, driver. But I guess I 
<u>was</u> a little. Actually, there's no proof that - that Killer Gregg is on this 
bus. 

DRIVER: (CONCEDES) Well, if you put it that way--

GIRL: It's all my fault and I'm sorry. My - my only excuse is that I was just 
so upset by seeing Jim, my husband--

KENNISTON: (INTERRUPTS) Well, I still say-- 

GIRL: (INTERRUPTS) No, no, no. Now - now, we've got to start acting like 
rational human beings. Let - let poor Mr. Willard up from the floor. 

SOUND: WILLARD HELPED TO HIS FEET BY DRIVER

WILLARD: (EXHALES, RELIEVED) Thanks, lady.

DRIVER: (RELUCTANT AGREEMENT) Well, all right. But I'm warning you, Willard -- 
no funny stuff.

WILLARD: Oh, snap out of it, driver, will you? We've got to get out of this 
mess. Hand me that axe. 

DRIVER: Do I look that dumb? 

WILLARD: Oh - oh, all right, all right. Then use it yourself. Smash a window 
so we can crawl out. 

DRIVER: (LIGHTLY) Willard, even <u>you</u> don't look that dumb! What makes you think 
the windows won't open? 

WILLARD: Huh? 

GIRL: Then open one! 

DRIVER: What for? To let in the blizzard? 

WILLARD: But we've got to get out of here, driver! 

DRIVER: Not me! It would take a bear to make even a city block in that 
windswept hell. 

GIRL: Well, we can't stay here! 

DRIVER: Why not? We're not freezin' -- yet. 

KENNISTON: The driver's right. Our best chance is to sit pat until the storm 
lets up. 

WILLARD: Yeah, but what if it doesn't, huh? (HYSTERICAL) What if it lasts 
longer than we do? What then, huh?! What then?! What then?! 

DRIVER: Shut up! Blowin' your top won't do any good, Willard. Nobody's ever 
confused me with Pollyanna, but things could be worse. This is as good an 
igloo as any, and if and when the weather clears-- Well, we can send out a 
party for help.

KENNISTON: Or maybe a road-clearing crew will come to our rescue. 

GIRL: Yes! Yes, I - I suppose that that's the sane thing to do: wait here. 

KENNISTON: How about you, Willard? (POINTEDLY SUSPICIOUS) You also decided to 
do the "<u>sane</u>" thing? 

WILLARD: (GRIM) I don't like that crack, you. One more like it and I'll--! 

DRIVER: (INTERRUPTS) Look, we're not startin' that again! Now, it's gonna be a 
long night and we might just as well make ourselves comfortable and try to get 
some sleep.

WILLARD: (SCORNFUL) Hah! Sleep! 

DRIVER: Cut it out! (GENTLY, TO GIRL) Now, miss, you take the backseat. It's 
the only one that runs the full width of the bus. You can use your lap robe 
for a quilt. 

GIRL: All right, driver. (TO ALL, CALMLY) I - I want to apologize again to 
everyone for the way I behaved. I-- Casting suspicion-- 

DRIVER: Forget it. You need any help? 

GIRL: No. No, thank you. 

SOUND: GIRL'S STEPS BEHIND--

GIRL: I just don't know what came over me, starting that idiotic talk. Please 
believe that I didn't-- (STOPS SHORT, STUNNED) Why-- 

DRIVER: (BEAT) What's the matter? 

WILLARD: (NO ANSWER) Why are you staring at the floor? 

SOUND: THEIR SLOW STEPS TO GIRL

KENNISTON: Well? Say something! 

GIRL: (QUIETLY TENSE) Look. Look! 

DRIVER: A file! 

KENNISTON: A tiny steel file! 

WILLARD: The one that Gregg--? 

GIRL: (REALIZES, SLOWLY) After the avalanche hit, there was a mad scramble. 
One of you lost it then. One of you <u>is</u> Gregg! Killer Gregg! 

SOUND: GIRL'S HURRIED STEPS TO BUS DOOR

GIRL: (WILDLY) Let me out of here!

SOUND: GIRL KICKS AND POUNDS VIOLENTLY ON DOOR ... THEN IN BG

GIRL: (HYSTERICAL) Oh, let me out of here! Please let me out of here! Oh, I've 
just got to get out of here! (ET CETERA ... CONTINUES IN BG)

MUSIC: SNEAKS IN DURING ABOVE ... SLOW AND GRIM, IN COUNTERPOINT TO THE GIRL'S 
HYSTERIA ... THEN BEHIND DRIVER--

DRIVER: (NARRATES) Well, we just let her wear herself out, kickin' and bangin' 
on the door. Nobody said a word. Willard and Kenniston just stared at me, and 
at each other. (<u>SOUND: GIRL'S VOICE FADES OUT AND HER POUNDING CEASES ... WIND 
BLOWS EVEN HARDER THAN BEFORE, IN BG</u>) By and by, the girl stopped her fussin' 
-- and then she stood and stared at the three of us in rotation. It would have 
made your flesh crawl. And outside, the blizzard was gettin' worse, if 
possible. Finally, I reached into the watch pocket of my pants and brought out 
the old timepiece. 

WILLARD: What - what time is it, driver? 

DRIVER: (WITH DIFFICULTY, SQUINTING) Eh, broke the crystal. It still says a 
quarter of four.

GIRL: (CHECKS HER OWN WATCH, UNEMOTIONAL) It's - it's five-thirty. Only an 
hour and a half since we started out. (WITH DISMAY) An hour and a half. 

KENNISTON: (GRIM) Five-thirty in the afternoon. At the very best, we're stuck 
until morning. 

WILLARD: (REALIZES, SHAKEN) Fourteen-- Sixteen hours. 

GIRL: (MISERABLE) Might as well be forever.

DRIVER: (REASSURING) Look, miss -- we just got to make the best of it. I still 
think you ought to go back to the rear seat. 

GIRL: (DOUBTFUL) And sleep? 

DRIVER: If you can. 

KENNISTON: Willard, the driver, and myself will be keeping a rather close eye 
on each other -- in the light of recent developments. You'll be all right. 
Here, driver, give me that axe. 

DRIVER: Huh? 

KENNISTON: Let her have it for her protection. 

WILLARD: Sure. Sure, let her have it. 

GIRL: (QUIETLY EAGER) Yes. Yes, give it to me. 

DRIVER: (AMUSED) Okay. You holdin' on to the file, too? 

KENNISTON: 'Course she is. The file could also be a - lethal weapon. 

SOUND: WIND CONTINUES, IN BG

MUSIC: IN AND BEHIND DRIVER--

DRIVER: (NARRATES) Well, she took the axe and the file back to the rear seat 
with her, and we all sat down to wait. Those were the longest seconds of the 
longest minutes of the longest hours that ever-- Well, somehow it got to be 
nine o'clock -- ten -- eleven. Finally, it was midnight. 

MUSIC: UP FOR A BRIEF TRANSITION ... THEN BEHIND DRIVER--

DRIVER: (NARRATES) Ever fought against sleep? With the cold numbing you and 
the wind lulling ya? Sometimes even the fear of sudden death can't win against 
those odds. Time and again, the girl's eyes would close -- just for a second! 
-- and then they stayed closed longer. And her head nodded and her body 
slumped over against the corner of the seat. I got up and started down the 
aisle.

SOUND: WIND STILL BLOWING FIERCELY, IN BG ... DRIVER'S SLOW FOOTSTEPS, THEN 
OUT WITH--

KENNISTON: (TENSE) Where are you going? 

DRIVER: (LOW) Ssh, Kenniston! Can't you see she's asleep? 

KENNISTON: (LOW, INSISTS) Where are you going? 

DRIVER: Her lap robe slipped to the floor; I was gonna pick it up and cover 
her so she wouldn't freeze. Any objections? 

KENNISTON: <u>I'll</u> do it. 

DRIVER: Oh, no, you won't. 

WILLARD: Go ahead, driver.

DRIVER: (AMUSED, LIGHTLY) See, Kenniston? Willard thinks <u>I</u> should do it. That 
makes it two to one. 

SOUND: DRIVER'S STEPS TO GIRL 

DRIVER: (BENDS WITH A GRUNT, THEN ADJUSTS ROBE, QUIETLY) There.

GIRL: (WAKES WITH A START, PANICS, GASPS AND GRUNTS WITH EFFORT AS--) 

SOUND: WILD SCUFFLE! ... GIRL SLAPS AND CLAWS AT DRIVER

DRIVER: Help me! Help me with this wildcat! Get that file away from her before 
she jabs my eyes out!

GIRL: (GASPS AND GRUNTS, IN BG, OUT AT [X])

MUSIC: BIG ACCENT ... THEN BEHIND DRIVER--

DRIVER: (NARRATES) She was like a devil on a pinwheel -- and I was lucky to 
tear loose before she did any more than nick me about the face. [X] Afterwards 
when Willard told her what I was up to, she apologized. But I didn't go near 
her again all the rest of that night. (<u>SOUND: WIND FINALLY DIES OUT</u>) Well, 
about five o'clock the blizzard stopped. And at seven, the sun managed to 
break through. Then we held a council of war.

GIRL: We can't send out for help. 

WILLARD: Why not? 

GIRL: Don't you see, Mr. Willard? If we split up the men, whichever of you is 
Gregg would have too good an opportunity -- whether he goes or stays. 

WILLARD: <u>You</u> could go -- alone. 

GIRL: I'd never make it. 

KENNISTON: We could all go together. How about that, driver? 

DRIVER: (RELUCTANT) Well-- No, I'd - I'd rather stick with the bus, Kenniston. 
But before we decide anything, let's get out and look around. 

MUSIC: QUIETLY HOPEFUL ... IN AND THEN IN BG--

DRIVER: (NARRATES) We got a window open on the far side of the bus and crawled 
through; the girl first. She was still clutchin' the axe and the file.

GIRL: (OFF, EXCITED) Come here! Come here and look!

DRIVER: What?
WILLARD: Huh?

GIRL: (OFF) Another few yards and we would have escaped the avalanche 
entirely. We can shovel our way out! I'm <u>sure</u> we can!

DRIVER: (NARRATES) There were two shovels in the tool compartment at the tail 
guard of the bus. 

SOUND: SHOVELS IN SNOW ... WILLARD & KENNISTON GRUNT AND GASP WITH EFFORT AS 
THEY DIG, IN BG

DRIVER: (NARRATES) That only let two men shovel at a time, with the third man 
gettin' a breather meanwhile. It took a lot of shovelin'. 

MUSIC: OUT

SOUND: GRUNTING AND SHOVELING CONTINUES, IN BG

KENNISTON: What's the matter, driver? Hurt your hand? 

DRIVER: Oh, nothing much. Just feels good to take off those stiff leather 
gloves. 

KENNISTON: Nasty blisters you got on that right hand. On the thumb and [first 
two] fingers.

DRIVER: (SHARPLY) Say, Kenniston, are you shovelin' or talkin'? We'll never 
get out of here at this rate. 

KENNISTON: Well, it's your turn anyway. (EXHALES) I'm tired.

DRIVER: Not as tired as Willard looks. I'll relieve <u>him</u>. 

WILLARD: No. No, that's all right. I can keep going yet for a while. 

DRIVER: Okay then. Kenniston? 

KENNISTON: Here.

SOUND: HANDS OVER SHOVEL

GIRL: Let me take a turn. I know I won't be much help, but I can at least try. 

WILLARD: Oh, no, no, no. You're mountin' guard. Though I'm sure you could do 
as well as Kenniston. (STOPS DIGGING, REALIZES) Kenniston! Where's Kenniston?! 

GIRL: Why, he's right-- <u>Stop</u> <u>him</u>! 

MUSIC: ACCENT ... THEN IN BG--

SOUND: RUNNING STEPS IN SNOW, BRIEFLY

DRIVER: (NARRATES) Kenniston was making a mad dash through the snow. Willard 
dropped his shovel and tore after him. I yelled for Willard to let him go, but 
I don't think he even heard me. For a while it looked like Kenniston was gonna 
make it, but then he floundered and fell in a snowdrift -- and before he could 
get underway again Willard nailed him.

WILLARD: (WITH EFFORT) Oh, no, you don't!

SOUND: BRIEF FISTFIGHT AND GRUNTING AS WILLARD BEATS KENNISTON UNCONSCIOUS

MUSIC: UP AND OUT

SOUND: DRIVER'S HURRIED STEPS APPROACH

WILLARD: (PLEASED) Heh! Well, he'll stay put for a while. 

DRIVER: What'd you do, knock him out? 

WILLARD: Well, what else was there to do?

GIRL: (APPROACHES, BREATHLESS) Is he--? (SEES) Oh.

WILLARD: I knew all the time it was Kenniston. 

GIRL: You think his - his running away proves it?

WILLARD: It's the same as if he confessed! He knew it was his last and only 
chance. 

GIRL: Well, what are we gonna do with him now? 

WILLARD: Tie him up. Then we're gettin' him and the bus out of here. 
(REALIZES) Say--! Say, I wonder-- I wonder if there's a <u>reward</u>.

MUSIC: BRIEF TRANSITION ... THEN IN BG--

SOUND: SPEEDING BUS INTERIOR BACKGROUND

DRIVER: (NARRATES) In no time at all, we had the bus clear and headed for 
civilization. Those snow-covered mountain roads weren't exactly my idea of a 
speedway, but I gave my motor the gun. Willard and the girl didn't take their 
eyes off Kenniston. I kept watchin' him, too, out of the mirror over the 
driver's seat. 

MUSIC: OUT

DRIVER: (TO WILLARD) It looks like he's comin' to. 

WILLARD: Don't worry, driver. Those knots I made in the rope won't give. 
(POINTEDLY) Besides, I'm keeping the axe handy just in case. 

GIRL: He's opening his eyes.

DRIVER: (NERVOUSLY) Watch him now! Watch him! 

KENNISTON: (WAKES, GROANS) Yes, watch me -- and listen to me, too! 

DRIVER: (THREATENING) Shut up, Kenniston -- or I'll stop this bus and put you 
out for good.

KENNISTON: Not before I've had my say! Willard--? And you, too, lady! Why do 
you think I tried to make a break for it?

GIRL: Because <u>you</u> are-- 

WILLARD: (SHARPLY) You're Killer Gregg! 

KENNISTON: You fools! You blind stupid fools! Was it <u>my</u> watch that had its 
crystal smashed at a quarter to four yesterday afternoon? 

DRIVER: So it was mine. So what?

KENNISTON: At a quarter to four yesterday afternoon, Killer Gregg waylaid the 
<u>real</u> driver of this bus and took his place! 

WILLARD: What? 
GIRL: Oh, no.

KENNISTON: That's how the crystal came to be broken! 

DRIVER: (SAVAGELY) Shut up, Kenniston! You can't talk your way out of this! 

GIRL: It - it could be a coincidence. 

WILLARD: Sure, sure! 

KENNISTON: That's what I thought, too -- coincidence! -- until I noticed the 
blisters on the thumb and first two fingers of the right hand! A <u>file</u> would 
make blisters like that. A file held in the right hand of <u>Killer</u> <u>Gregg</u>! 

SOUND: BUS SUDDENLY SPEEDS UP ... CONTINUES IN BG

GIRL: (HORRIFIED) Look at him! Look at him! It's true!

WILLARD: (REALIZES, IN HORROR) Gregg-- Gregg!

DRIVER: (WILDLY) Don't come a step closer, any of ya! You make the slightest 
move and I'll crash the whole lot of us!

KENNISTON: Don't do it, Gregg! Stop the bus! We won't do anything!

DRIVER: (RAVING MADLY) It was a perfect plan! It had to work! If only that 
avalanche hadn't come along! But I'll still make it. I'll make it even if I 
have to--

SOUND: PASSENGERS SCREAM ("Look out!" "That turn!" "No, no!") ... TIRES 
SQUEAL! AND METAL CRUNCHES! AND GLASS SHATTERS! AS BUS LEAVES THE ROAD AND 
ROLLS DOWN A HILL, CRASHING THUNDEROUSLY AT THE BOTTOM

MUSIC: BIG ACCENT ... BRIEF SOMBER TRANSITION ... THEN OUT BEHIND--

DRIVER: (RELIVING THE MOMENT WITH BREATHLESS HORROR) It rolled over and over 
and over and over. The bus -- and the glass -- all smashed. And everybody was 
all mangled and-- (GIBBERS UNEASILY)

SUPER: (GRIM) All right, all right. Go to sleep now. 

DRIVER: Sleep? Who can go to sleep? (QUIETLY MAD) Who can go to sleep? (WITH 
PLEASURE) Anyway, I outlived those three. (CHUCKLES MADLY) [Killer Gregg -- 
that's me!] <u>Killer</u> <u>Gregg</u>-- (LAUGHS INSANELY AT GREAT LENGTH)

MUSIC: SLOWLY TOPS THE HYSTERICAL LAUGHTER ... CURTAIN

ANNOUNCER: <u>SUSPENSE</u>! 

MUSIC: KNIFE CHORD! ... THEN BEHIND--

MUSIC: CHORD OUT

TRUMAN BRADLEY: This is Truman Bradley for Roma Wines. These days of hard-to-
get meat and butter offer a real challenge to the American housewife who takes 
pride in her meals. That's why so many smart women serve Roma California 
burgundy with dinner. They know that even the simplest meals taste better, 
become more enjoyable, when served with a fine robust Roma burgundy. Discover 
for yourself the satisfying taste harmony of Roma burgundy with food. The next 
time you serve a savory pot roast, oven-browned meat loaf, or a piping hot 
dish of spaghetti heaped with a spicy sauce, bring out all its flavorful 
goodness with a bottle of red Roma burgundy. Or, if you prefer a lighter wine, 
let Roma California claret or famous Roma Zinfandel add magic taste and 
friendliness to your next meal. Remember, Roma, America's favorite wine, costs 
no more than ordinary wines. So insist on Roma, R-O-M-A, America's first 
choice in wine.
