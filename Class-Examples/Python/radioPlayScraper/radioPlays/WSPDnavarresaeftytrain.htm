(A five-minute radio sketch on Safety) 

By Genevieve Givins, Navarre School, Toledo, Ohio. Broadcast over Station WSPD, 
Toledo, February 15, 1929, under the auspices of the Toledo Safety Council. 




Scene: At a railway station. Train about to leave. 

CONDUCTOR: (Calls) All aboard for the Navarre Safety Train. All aboard! All 
aboard!

DON: Pardon me, sir, but where does this train go? 

CON: This train goes to Happiness Town. This is the Navarre Safety Train and 
only careful people may get on. All aboard! All aboard! Wait a minute, wait a 
minute. Show your ticket. Where do you want to go? 

DON: I want to go to Careless Town. Isn't that on this road? 

CON: No, sir, it is not. This road leads to Happiness. You're on the road to 
Sorrow. You can't get on this train. . . . Ticket, please. 

MYRTLE: I'm from Careful Town. I stop at the curb, look left and right before 
I cross the street. I never cross in the middle of the block. May I get on 
your safety train? 

CON: You certainly may. We have no room for jaywalkers, but you are not one. We 
stop at Careful Town, where you come from. 

BRUCE: I want to go to Fire Town. May I get on? 

CON: That depends on your ticket. Do you go by way of Careful Town or Careless 
Town? 

BRUCE: I really don't know. How can I tell?

CON: Do you keep gasoline in cans painted red and marked plainly? 

BRUCE: Yes, I do. 

CON: Do you keep your basement free of rubbish? 

BRUCE: Yes, I do. 

CON: Do you keep matches in a tin box away from the stove? 

BRUCE: Yes, I do. 

CON: Do you use a searchlight instead of matches when you smell gas? 

BRUCE: Yes, I do. 

CON: Then I'm sure that you are going the Careful way. You may get on this 
safety train. . . . Why, goodness, lady, you seem to be all out of breath. 

MABEL: Oh, dear, I was afraid I'd miss the train, I was so busy around the 
house, I had to hustle. Mary broke a bottle in her haste, but I took time to 
pick up the broken glass and put it in the barrel, right away. 

John left a marble on the floor, so I had to pick it up. I don't want any one to 
fall because he stepped on a marble. 

I had to hold the ladder for Ida. She was hanging curtains and was going to step 
on the radiator from a chair. She had a magazine on the chair, and that often 
causes accidents. The magazine slips and the person falls. So I told her to get 
a ladder and I'd hold it for her.

James brought home some medicine, and I noticed it was marked poison. So I took 
the time to put a pin in the cork before putting it in the medicine cabinet. Now 
if some one goes to get medicine at night the pin will tell that poison is in 
that bottle. So many little things to do, but it pays to be careful. 

CON: You must be from Careful Town. This is the right train. All aboard! 

JUNIOR: Let me on, I'm in a hurry! 

CON: Wait a minute, why the hurry? Where are you going? 

JUNIOR: I'm on my way to Broken Limbs. 

CON: Broken Limbs! That's not on the road to Happiness. It must be on the Sorrow 
Road. How do you get there? 

JUNIOR: Oh, we coast into busy streets where autos go by. We make slides in 
driveways. We roller-skate in the streets. We hop trucks. Sometimes we hitch our 
sleds to autos. Some of our boys ride bicycles carelessly. Why some even ride to 
death. Throwing snowballs and using bean-blowers comes in our class, too. Often 
eyes are injured in this way. We find many ways of getting to Broken Limbs. 

CON: You can't get on this train. This is the Navarre Safety Train. We do not go 
your way. No, you can't get on. This is the Navarre Safety Train. All aboard! All 
aboard! This train goes by way of Careful Town and stops at Happiness. All aboard! 
All aboard! 

(During this last call, the bell rings, the whistle blows and the puff of the 
train is heard. Let it grow less and less to show that the train is moving into 
the distance.)
