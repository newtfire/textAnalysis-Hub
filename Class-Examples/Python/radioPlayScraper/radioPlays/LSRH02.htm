<h2>Manhattan Patrol: The Mannington Case</h2><pre>Lucky Strike Hour
Manhattan Patrol: The Mannington Case (Episode 01)
Jun 14 1932

[part 1]

(<u>MUSICAL SIGNATURE</u>)

<u>HOWARD CLANEY</u>: Ladies and gentlemen, the LUCKY STRIKE Hour presented for your 
pleasure by the manufacturers of LUCKY STRIKE Cigarettes! This inaugurates the 
great new series of LUCKY STRIKE thrills. During each week we will bring you 
sixty modern minutes with the world's finest dance orchestras and a new pilot 
of the Magic Carpet, Walter O'Keefe, star of the "Third Little Show," and, in 
addition, the melodrama and mystery of real New York police cases on Tuesdays,
your New York correspondent Walter Winchell on Thursdays, and Bert Lahr, 
Broadway's craziest comedian on Saturdays. We introduce the new pilot, Mr. 
Walter O'Keefe!

	<u>MR. WALTER O'KEEFE!!</u>

WALTER O'KEEFE: How are you Uncle Sam and HOW is the Missus? This is one of 
your nephews, Uncle Sam, just one of your own boys -- Walter O'Keefe, and I'm 
sitting right on top of the world if I DO say so myself, - and I certainly DO 
say so myself - and WHY NOT? Why not I ask you? The other Mr. LUCKY STRIKE 
swept down Broadway, lifted me up on the carpet, flew me over to Fifth Avenue 
and said, "Walter, get off Broadway, get out into the great open spaces .. 
jump into the driver's seat of the Magic Carpet and take the whole continent 
for a ride. How about it Walter?" I said "OKAY LUCKY STRIKES ... It's a deal." 
And LUCKY STRIKES handed me my driving license and yelled, "You're on your own 
... OKAY O'Keefe." So Uncle Sam, there's the story. Get the missus, get the 
youngsters, get the neighbors, get the spirit, get the thrill of a ride on the 
Magic Carpet. Did you hear me say RIDE Uncle Sam ... well that's what you're 
in for ... a wild exciting ride up the highways and down the byways in search 
of music, melody, mirth, merriment AND melodrama. Oh honestly, we've got a 
melodramatic knock 'em down and drag-em-out on this program that packs a 
wallop like that famous one two punch of Jack Dempsey's, but I can't spare 
time to tell you now because YOU'RE ON YOUR WAY ... and tonight all roads lead 
to Chicago, the dear old windy City, where the Republican Party has got Miss 
Prosperity in the pulmotor to shoot some life into her. She isn't dead, ladies 
and gentlemen -- she just fainted and I'll bet by now she's down on the floor 
of the College Inn dancing to the contagious music by Joe Sanders and his 
Nighthawks. There's a lad for you ... he was the toast of Kansas City ... he 
has been the toast of little Old New York, and right now he's the toast of the 
Windy City on Lake Michigan.    In other words, HE IS THE TOAST.    So now the 
Magic Carpet picks up and gives you Joe Sanders and his band on toast.

	ON WITH THE DANCE, JOE SANDERS (WHISTLE) OKAY, CHICAGO!

<u>JOE SANDERS</u>: Welcome, Magic Carpet and welcome to you, Walter O'Keefe! And 
welcome everybody to the city of the conventions, and to the College Inn where 
we'll play -- (TITLES)

(______________)
(______________)
(______________)
(______________)
(______________)

<u>JOE SANDERS</u>: Ready for the fast hop from Chicago to New York? Fine! Then, 
let's go! 

(WHISTLE) OKAY, O'KEEFE! [...]

<u>WALTER O'KEEFE</u>: [...] Ah ladies and gentlemen, we've taken you all over the 
world in search of entertainment. This marvelous, miraculous MAGIC CARPET has 
wiped out Time and Space by quick excursions to England, Germany, France, 
South America and the four points of the continent ... BUT .... toNIGHT we've 
even found a new field of thrills. Here's where we loop the loop, slip into a 
tailspin and dump you right into the clutches of the Underworld. You'll hear 
revolvers crackling and sputtering like a forest fire. HERE you have murder 
and mystery .... It's got everything ..... EVERYTHING ...... I tell you. It is 
going to make your hair stand on end .....    YEESS ..... and if you haven't 
GOT any hair don't be surprised if your toupee ..... TOUPAY .... takes off and 
flies up into the chandelier.

Sitting beside me in the pilot seat is one of America's authorities on crime 
detection, Mr. Dominick Henry, former Deputy Chief Inspector of the New York 
Police Department. Inspector Henry's record as a police officer includes many 
mentions of his bravery in capturing criminals but he is probably most famous 
for his cleaning-up New York's tough tenderloin district. He is here at the 
request of the Police Commissioner of New York City, the Honorable Edward P. 
Mulrooney. Take over the controls, kind sir!

	(WHISTLE) OKAY, INSPECTOR HENRY!

<u>INSPECTOR HENRY</u>: The stories which you will hear as a regular part of this 
program each Tuesday night are dramatizations of real police cases taken from 
the files of the New York Police Department. Everything in these programs is 
real life except that for obvious reasons fictitious names are used 
throughout. Commissioner Mulrooney has generously placed at the disposal of 
the sponsors of this program the complete records and files of each case. The 
Commissioner hopes that by presenting these stories, every member of this vast 
audience will not only be entertained, but will again be impressed most 
forcibly by the fact that crime does not pay. These dramas will reproduce the 
loud speaker voice as it is heard in the police cars. The New York Police 
Department has gone to considerable expense and effort in perfecting the use 
of radio for direct communication with police cars, and they are enthusiastic 
about the results; so it is fitting that the science of radio which brings 
these thrilling stories to you, is also being used successfully in the 
prevention and detection of crime in the City of New York.

BARRY: Mrs. Schinker.

MACK: Is she all right?

BARRY: Yes. (RINGS BELL) But be ready to draw fast in case we run into Whitey

	(CLOSES DOOR)

RUDD: Any of the roomers in?

MRS. SCHINKER: Not now .....

RUDD: Sure?

MRS. SCHINKER: (TRACE OF ANXIETY IN VOICE) Positive .... Why?

RUDD: I'm not going to beat around the bush, Mrs. Schinker. We know you are an 
honest woman. We're a couple of detectives and we want some information.

MRS. SCHINKER: But .... But ... But ......

RUDD: It's all right. Take a good look at this picture. Have you ever seen 
this face before?

MRS. SCHINKER: Why, that's Mr. Murray!

RUDD: Hm .... These fellows change their names easier than their faces.

MRS. SCHINKER: Ya, him and Mr. Taylor have occupied that room for more than a 
year.

RUDD: Good .... Take me to their room .....

MRS. SCHINKER: They ain't here no more .... Last Sunday night they suddenly 
told me they vas leaving for Florida.

RUDD: What time?

MRS. SCHINKER: Between eight and nine.

RUDD: What part of Florida?

MRS. SCHINKER: I don't know.

MRS. SCHINKER: They didn't say nothing about that.

RUDD: What telephone did they use?

MRS. SCHINKER: My family phone.

RUDD: Coin box?

MRS. SCHINKER: No .... We each wrote down our calls when we made them and 
settled up at the end of the month.

RUDD: Would you mind letting me see that telephone note-book, Mrs. Schinker?

MRS. SCHINKER: (FADING IN) This is it -- right here.

RUDD: Thank you. Let's pick out the calls they made ... Mm ... m .... 
Boulevard - 4232 .... Mm ... Boulevard 4232 ...... That's running along pretty 
frequently through here the past two weeks. It seems to be the only number 
they've called more than once.

MRS. SCHINKER: That's a <u>ten</u> <u>cent</u> call .... Out in Forest Hills.

RUDD: Get the dope on that number, Mack.

MACK: (FADE) Right, Barry.

RUDD: And now, Mrs. Schinker, tell me, did you ever hear either of these men 
call anybody by name when telephoning to Forest Hills?

MRS. SCHINKER: Ya, I did.

RUDD: Man or woman?

MRS. SCHINKER: Always a woman .... They called her Grace.

MACK: (EXULTANTLY .... SOMEWHAT OFF SCENE) I got it, Barry. It's down in my 
note-book.

MRS. SCHINKER: (SUDDEN ALARM) Can you excuse me one minute, gentlemen? I have 
my pies in the oven ....

RUDD: Certainly, Mrs. Schinker ....... All right, Mack, what did you find out 
about that Boulevard number?

MACK: The name is Frank Jackson ....

RUDD: (HEIGHT OF SPECULATIVE INTEREST) And a fashionable suburb .... Now what 
kind of a tie-up can a fellow like Whitey have out there.....

MACK: Want me to go out there, Barry?

RUDD: No .... You stay here and get everything you can from Mrs. Schinker .... 
get a description of Whitey's pal. Then check up on the stolen jewelry again.

MACK: What are <u>you</u> going to do?

RUDD: (OPENING DOOR .... PEP IN VOICE) Come out side a minute.

	(CLOSES DOOR)

RUDD: I'm going to get out to Forest Hills fast on that Grace Jackson clue 
.... I'll get in and have a talk with her somehow .... Among other things, I 
want to see whether she's attractive or not .... and how much!

	(TAXI FADES IN)

RUDD: Hey, taxi!

	(TAXI DRAWS UP AND STOPS)

RUDD: (FAST ACTION) So long, Mack .... I'm going out over the Queensboro 
bridge .... Get in touch with me through Headquarters when you're finished.

<u>SOUND INTERLUDE</u>: (HOLLOW RUMBLE OF TRAFFIC OVER THE QUEENSBORO BRIDGE ABOVE 
EAST RIVER ... BACKGROUND OF HARBOR CRAFT HORNS AND WHISTLES ..... )

<u>SCENE FIVE</u>: GRACE JACKSON'S HOME IN FOREST HILLS

MOTHER: Well, Grace, I think I'd better be starting back to Jamaica.

GRACE: All right, Mother .... I'll just keep right on packing, if you don't 
mind.

	(DOOR BELL RINGS)
 
GRACE: (TENSELY) That's the front door. I don't want to see  anybody now. 
Mother, don't let them see you from the window.

MOTHER: (OFF MIKE LOOKING OUT WINDOW ON PORCH) He's a nice looking man, 
whoever he is .... Maybe he's the one who  telephoned. The one who owes Frank 
money ....

GRACE: Oh! Well, perhaps I'd better see him!

	(DOOR BELL RINGS AGAIN .... PAUSE WHILE SHE GOES TO DOOR AND 
	OPENS IT .... AD LIB INDISTINCT VOICE OUTSIDE .... THE STRANGER 
	STEPS IN HALL AND DURING FEW SENTENCES FADE INTO MIKE WITH HER.)

RUDD: Waters is my name, Mrs. Jackson. As I was telling you on the telephone, 
I want to see your husband.

GRACE: But I told you that my husband is in Florida .....

RUDD: O-h .... So that's what you were trying to tell me ..... That connection 
was bad. I thought you said he was <u>going</u> to Florida. That's unfortunate 
because I'm not often in New York.

GRACE: I'm sorry .... Is there anything I can do?

RUDD: I'm afraid not, Mrs. Jackson. I've owed him some money for some little 
time but I don't know just how much. When is he getting back?

GRACE: Not until March.

RUDD: Makes it sort of lonesome for you, having him away so long, doesn't it?

GRACE: Yes, but I'm going to Florida myself.

RUDD: Oh, really! Soon?

GRACE: Next week.

RUDD: Fine .... (WITH A LOOKING AROUND TONE OF VOICE) This is a mighty 
comfortable home you have here, Mrs. Jackson. Looks as though Frank hasn't 
been missing that money much that I've been owing him.

GRACE: If you don't know how much you owe him, I'll be glad to take a part 
payment and give you a receipt.

RUDD: (DRAWLS) N-o .... I've got to have a talk with Frank first to straighten 
out a few little things. Perhaps, I can do it by mail. If you'll just give me 
his address, I'll get in touch with him.

GRACE: (MUTTERING AS SHE WRITES) All right ... I'll just jot it down for you! 
(PAUSE) 41 Roberts Street, Miami Beach, Florida ..... There .... Now if you'll 
excuse me, I expect some friends for tea.

RUDD: I understand .... (FADE) I must be moving along myself anyhow .... 
(SIGNIFICANTLY) Maybe I'll be seeing you again, Mrs. Jackson?

	(DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES) .... (PAUSE)

MOTHER: Grace, why did you tell him that you were going to Florida next week 
when you're leaving tonight?

GRACE: (NERVOUS TENSENESS ... EXCITED) Because I don't believe in telling 
anybody my business. (DETERMINATION) Besides, I've decided to go sooner than 
tonight. I've got my bags packed and I'm going to leave right now!

really go to Florida? .... Just where have Whitey and Tyson gone? .... Has 
Barry Rudd overlooked some hidden clue? ... Stand by .... Lucky Strike Dance

O.K. O'Keefe

[...]

WALTER O'KEEFE: Whew .... Whaddye mean OKAY O'KEEFE ..... I call it a mess. 
Why ... why it's the most unheard-of thing I ever heard of. First of all they 
murder a cop .... then poor Mrs. Schinker, the landlady of the boarding house, 
has to go and burn those pies of hers, I suppose in the next installment 
Detective Barry Rudd will come in disguised as a Tomato Surprise on a short 
wavelength Eastern Standard Time. Speaking of time, I'm thinking of you people 
out there on the sunkist slopes of California .... four hours behind our time 
here ... I can see the picture. Sitting down to a dinner with a table full of 
those luscious vegetables from the Imperial Valley and here LUCKY STRIKE 
brings you a murder, a blonde, and some burned apple-strudel for dessert. Go 
right on with your dinner, California -- this mystery will be solved later in 
this hour. We'll untangle this mess before you get to the coffee and 
cigarettes, but UPSADAISY everybody .... bundle up and get in the buggy .... 
THE MAGIC CARPET can't stop now .... It's in high, rushing you right back to 
the College Inn in Chicago where Joe Sanders and his Nighthawks have been 
listening in on this awful murder. They have caught the spirit of this thing 
and so for their first number they will murder "Hello Gorgeous" by special 
permission of the composer.

	ON WITH THE DANCE, JOE SANDERS (WHISTLE) OKAY, CHICAGO! 

<u>JOE SANDERS</u>: (WITH A LAUGH) You call it murder but we call it dancing - 
dancing to "Hello Gorgeous" and - (TITLES) We're off!

(HELLO GORGEOUS)
(______________)
(______________)
(______________)

<u>JOE SANDERS</u>: And if you call THAT murdering music, Walter O'Keefe, let's hear 
what you do to the English language!

	(WHISTLE) OKAY, NEW YORK!

WALTER O'KEEFE: Joe .... I never heard you play so well before. I think it 
must be that crowd of Republicans around dear old Chi .... Say Joe ..... 
there's a little bit of Winchell in all of us. I just heard a rumor about the 
new Republican slogan for this campaign .... find out if it's true .... what 
the country needs is a good laugh and this slogan should give it to them. The 
slogan is as follows: "Don't swap toboggans while you're sliding down hill." 
Find out Joe ... but meanwhile let's you and I lie down and rest while Howard 
Claney uses twenty seconds ..... no more, no less .... to talk about the LUCKY 
STRIKE Platform.

<u>HOWARD CLANEY</u>: Your LUCKY STRIKE brings you a choice selection of more than 
forty choice tobaccos from all over the world --- Every leaf carefully aged 
and blended, then "IT'S TOASTED" -- the famous LUCKY STRIKE purifying process 
which makes LUCKY STRIKE pure, delicious, extra mellow-mild.

<u>WALTER O'KEEFE</u>: Howard, that's talking Turkey or maybe it's just good old-
fashioned United States ..... and now you Americans, young or old, hot or 
cold, the MAGIC CARPET under the direction of that old Armenian rug-maker, 
O'Keefe, once again skedaddles over the skies [...] while I gather my old 
friends and my new friends on the MAGIC CARPET and toss them back into the 
loving arms of the underworld. By the way, ladies and gentlemen, if you DO 
light a LUCKY now, be careful .... don't forget all about it and let it burn 
down to your fingers because for the next few minutes you're going to forget 
home and mother and the first-of-the-month's bills in the supreme thrill of 
watching New York's smartest detectives hot on the trail of the cop-killers. 
You already know about the policeman that's been murdered, you remember the 
way that snaky blonde dashed off for the train ... heaven only knows what the 
solution is ..... not even Evangeline Adams .... but come on boys and gels, 
let's get in at the finish. Hop on, grab on, clutch on ..... but GET on the 
MAGIC CARPET while we swoop down on the files of Police Headquarters in New 
York City. Look out! Here it comes! On with the show, Detective Rudd!

RADIO-CAR VOICE: All .... Police cars .... Stand by ..... All .... Police cars 
.... Stand by ..... The Great Mannington Case .... Patrolman Mannington killed 
.... in restaurant hold-up ... Police making every effort to locate murderers 
-- Whitey and Tyson ..... Only clue leads to Grace Jackson ...... Lucky Strike 
Magic Carpet ..... Proceed at once ..... To Detective Barry Rudd's apartment 
......

	(POLICE SIREN)

<u>SCENE SEVEN</u>: BARRY RUDD'S APARTMENT IN MANHATTAN

MACK: (DISGUSTED) Well, it's four days, Barry, since Whitey's dame gave you 
the slip in Forest Hills.

RUDD: Yes .... and I'm more convinced than ever that she's gone to join Whitey 
.... wherever he is. We've simply got to locate her!

MACK: So I suppose I gotta go back to Forest Hills to gather rust and icicles 
for another night.

RUDD: What's the matter, Mack, want a night off or something?

MACK: No .... I want a night <u>on</u> .... on the job .... Where the job is. And 
that's in Miami, Florida, not out in Forest Hills watching a deserted house.

RUDD: Not quite deserted, is it, Mack?

MACK: Except for that Swede Kitchen canary ... She ain't said four words in 
four days.

RUDD: Somebody has trained her carefully. (SIGNIFICANTLY) And because she is 
well trained, she's worth watching. That's why I'm keeping that house watched 
twenty-four hours a day.

MACK: And in the meantime somebody else grabs off all the glory and all the 
sunshine in Miami ... where Mrs. Grace Jackson is just about pulling into 
right now. And where Grace is, we'll find Whitey and Tyson, (CLIMAX OF 
DISGUST) So what's the use of going on and watching that house.

RUDD: (WITH DECISION) I'm watching it because everybody else is watching 
Florida ... just as Whitey and Tyson and Grace Jackson want them to do .... If 
that girl had intended to go to Florida she wouldn't have gone to such pains 
to get out of town so quickly.

MACK: That's just a guess, Barry.

RUDD: All right. (QUICK CHANGE OF PACE) What do you call this?

MACK: Mm .... Looks like a department store sales slip.

RUDD: Read the items.

MACK: One skiing cap ... One pair of skates ... Well?

RUDD: Not much use in Miami, are they?

MACK: No .... But ....

RUDD: That ski-cap and those skates were bought by Mrs. Grace Jackson the day 
before she beat it.

MACK: Say ... where did you get this slip?

RUDD: Picked it up in the living room out there when she was writing her 
husband's Florida address for me.

MACK: Do you think she fell for that story?

RUDD: No .... I just used it to get inside the house so I could study her 
style .... She has a lot of it ....

	(TELEPHONE RINGS AND RUDD PICKS UP RECEIVER)

Hello ... Hello .... Oh, that you, Levine?

MACK: (SURPRISED) <u>Levine</u>? What the blazes ... Has Lena closed up the 
house and gone off to Florida, too?

RUDD: Yes ... Yes ... Great work, Levine. No ... No need of hanging around out 
there any more ... Sure ... drop over.

	(HANGS UP RECEIVER)

MACK: (EXCITED) What's happened, Barry? What's happened?

RUDD: (SNAPPING INTO ACTION) Levine saw Lena leave the house with a package 
and followed her .... She didn't mail it in Forest Hills but got on the train 
for Penn Station .... Levine trailed her to the Main Post office, where she 
sent the package Parcel Post -- Special delivery.

MACK: Did he get the address?

RUDD: Of course ... The package has been sent to Mrs. Grace Jackson .... And 
get <u>this</u> ..... the address isn't Miami, Florida.

MACK: Where is it?

RUDD: It's Old Forge.

MACK: (AMAZED) <u>Old Forge</u>?

RUDD: (TRIUMPHANT PUNCH) Yes ... Up in zero weather in the woods near Moose 
River ... Up where skiing caps and skates come in handy. How soon can you get 
your grip packed, Mack?

MACK: (EAGERLY) It's packed ... Except that I'll pull out the bathing suit and 
stick in a pair of ear-laps and an oil stove .... Let's go!

<u>SOUND INTERLUDE</u>: (WINTER SOUNDS ... TINKLE OF SLEIGH BELLS AND HORSES' HOOFS 
AND FROZEN SNOW ... REPEATS.)

<u>SCENE EIGHT</u>: POST OFFICE NEAR OLD FORGE

VOICE: Hello, Postmaster .... Got a letter for Joseph A. Dean?

POSTMASTER: Dean .... D-e-a-n .... Here you are. Here's <u>your</u> mail, Mrs. 
Trumbull.

MRS. TRUMBULL: Thank you, Mr. Osgood ... Pretty cold winter, ain't it? 

POSTMASTER: Third day in a row under zero ... (RAISING VOICE) How's Daniel's 
lumbago?

MRS. TRUMBULL: Not good enough to let him shovel a path around the house ... 
He says it ain't, anyway .... Goodbye ....

POSTMASTER: Goodbye, Mrs. Trumbull .... (DOOR CLOSES ... PAUSE) Anything you 
gentlemen want? I'm going to close the post office now.

RUDD: Yes ... But we didn't want to ask about it until we were alone with you. 
You're the Postmaster?

POSTMASTER: (SUSPICIOUSLY) Yes .... What can I do for you?

RUDD: (WINNINGLY) You can be a big help to us, Mr. Osgood .. My name is Barry 
Rudd ... Mack here and I are New York detectives and we're going to take you 
into our confidence.

POSTMASTER: Oh you are? .... Well, before I take you into mine, I'll have to 
have some proof you're what you say you are.

RUDD: Absolutely right, Mr. Osgood. Show him your papers and shield, Mack ... 
Here are mine.

POSTMASTER: (MOSTLY CONVINCED AS HE MUTTERS OVER PAPERS BUT NOT ENTIRELY) Mm 
... Well ... I guess you're what you say you are ... But you never can tell 
these days .... I've been reading about that New York Policeman who was shot 
in a hold-up a week ago. Those murderers even took his shield and revolver.

RUDD: Well, these shields were issued to us, don't worry!

POSTMASTER: Y-e-s ... I'm satisfied you chaps are what you say you are ... you 
know, as some of us was a-saying the other  night over at Van Auken's Tavern, 
bandits like them have got to be caught.

RUDD: That's what <u>we</u> think.

POSTMASTER: Yes, sir, because once criminals can get away with shootin' up the 
Police, what's going to happen to Law and Order.

RUDD: Well, how about helping us to get on the trail of the boys who killed 
Patrolman Mannington?

POSTMASTER: (AMAZED) Me? Me help you? Why those boys are down in Florida.

RUDD: Who told you that?

POSTMASTER: The newspapers ....

RUDD: I see! Well, we have some other ideas about that! A special delivery 
package was mailed to Mrs. Grace Jackson from New York yesterday. Did she get 
it?

POSTMASTER: (MORE AMAZED) Why ... why, yes .... But... but ....

RUDD: How long ago?

POSTMASTER: About two hours! She owns a bungalow out in the woods past Old 
Forge on the River Road.

RUDD: Anybody with her?

POSTMASTER: Two men.

RUDD: Did you get a good look at them?

POSTMASTER: Yes ... They came in to stamp their feet and get warm while Mrs. 
Jackson was signing for the package and talkin' to me.

RUDD: Here, take a good look at this picture ... Is that one of 'em?

POSTMASTER: (PAUSE) By the jumpin' Jake, it is! The same cocky, stuck-up face 
... Sort of looked on <u>me</u> as a hick ....

RUDD: (COMEDY PLAY) N-no!

POSTMASTER: Yes! The other one was shorter and a mite heavier, with freckles.

MACK: (WITH EAGER SNIFF OF COMBAT) They're the boys we're after, all right.

POSTMASTER: (FLABBERGASTED) But ... But I don't understand it ....  Mrs. 
Jackson is a nice girl, with good looks and a good reputation and plenty of 
money ... Doesn't seem as if she'd be associatin' with gunmen ....

RUDD: (WITH DECISION) Well, she is! Now look here, Mr. Osgood, let's 
understand one thing ... Not one word to anybody about this. Not even to your 
wife!

POSTMASTER: Count on me, boys ... (FADE) Excuse me while I just go back and 
get my keys...

RUDD: (CUTTING THROUGH TO DECISION) Tell you what we'll do, Mack .... We'll go 
out by the lake and get a line on that bungalow this afternoon .... And then 
I'm for dropping down on it with a couple of State Troopers tomorrow at dawn!

<u>SOUND INTERLUDE</u>: (HOWLING BLASTS OF WINTER WIND)

<u>SCENE NINE</u>: BUNGALOW AT DAWN ... RUDD, MACK AND TWO STATE TROOPERS HAVE DRIVEN 
OUT AND ARE DOING LAST BIT ON FOOT .....

1. APPROACH TO BUNGALOW PLAYED IN CAUTIOUS VOICES

2. INSIDE BUNGALOW VOICES ARE FAST, TENSE AND ON THE ALERT ALWAYS.

<u>SOUNDS</u>: (FEET CRUNCHING IN DEEP SNOW)

MACK: Pretty hard going in this snow, Barry.

RUDD: (VOICE OF CAUTION) Shh----. There's the bungalow right ahead. Let's hold 
up a minute.

TROOPER WADE: Yeah ... They can certainly pick up the four of us if we wake 
them up.

RUDD: One of you troopers ... you, Rogers .... watch the outside of the house 
... and you, Wade, follow Mack and me.
 
MACK: (SOBERLY) Barry, there's just one thing I want to say ....

RUDD: What is it, Mack?

MACK: When you and me crash the door, let me go first ..... You've got brains, 
and if anything should happen you'd be a lot more loss than I'd be ...

RUDD: Ah ... Forget it, Mack ... Forget it. Ready, everybody?

VOICE: Ready.

WADE: Ready.

RUDD: All right ... Let's move fast ... and remember ... quiet.

	(LONG PAUSE, BROKEN ONLY BY MACK CRUNCHING INTO DEEP SNOW)

RUDD: Steady, Mack.

	(DOG BARKS)

MACK: (ALARMED) Holy Mackeral! That's done it! We've got to rush it now, boys.

RUDD: Come on!

VOICE: (OFF SCENE) Who's that?

RUDD: Take the door, boys!

	(FAST RUSH OF THREE PAIR OF FEET ACROSS PORCH AND TERRIFIC 
	CRASH AS THEY CATAPULT THEMSELVES THROUGH DOOR)

MACK: (EXCITEDLY) There he is, in the bed, there!

RUDD: Jump him!

MACK: (THROWING HIMSELF ON FIGURE IN BED) I've got him.

TYSON: Let me up.

MACK: It's Tyson.

RUDD: (IN COMMAND) Pin him ... Come on, Wade, - Whitey must be in the back 
room.

	(BANG FROM REAR ROOM)

WADE: Look out, Rudd.

	(BANG, BANG FROM REAR ROOM)

RUDD: Ouch!

MACK: (ANXIOUSLY) Did he get you, Barry?

RUDD: Only in the left hand ... (RAPIDLY) But it's too late to rush him ... 
Stay out of range of the passageway, Wade. Help Mack put the cuffs on Tyson 
... I'll keep the passageway covered. If we can't get into the back room yet, 
we'll mighty well see that Whitey can't get out.

MACK: (ROUGHLY) Stand still in the corner, there, Tyson.

TYSON: (COMPLAINING) It's cold ... Let me get my clothes off the bed. I'll go 
along peacefully .... There's no crime I've committed. You boys have busted 
into the wrong place ... Let me get my clothes before I freeze ...
 
MACK: All right, but be quick about it.

RUDD: (CLICK OF COMMAND) Stop! Stand where you are, Tyson. I'll keep him 
covered, Mack, while you pull that bed out from the wall ....
 
MACK: All right ... Here goes ...

	(THUD OF HEAVY REVOLVER DROPPING TO FLOOR)
 
RUDD: See what that was that dropped to the floor, Mack ...
 
MACK: (PICKING UP REVOLVER) It's a thirty-eight Colt.

RUDD: I thought he was after more than his clothes. Now clap the cuffs on him.

	(CLICK OF HANDCUFFS)

MACK: I got him ... They're on!

RUDD: (RAISING VOICE) We've got Tyson, Whitey ... So you might as well 
surrender.

WHITEY: (DEFIANTLY FROM BACK ROOM) Come in and try to take me!

RUDD: (DETERMINEDLY) All right, we'll go in ... March in there, Tyson, ahead 
of us ....
 
TYSON: I won't ....

MACK: (ROUGHLY THRUSTING HIM TOWARD PASSAGE CONNECTING FRONT AND BACK ROOMS) 
Get up there .... Step up there, Tyson. We're going to march in for your pal 
Whitey behind you.

TYSON: (HALTS AFTER TWO STEPS ... ALARM AND PROTEST IN VOICE) I won't go ... I 
won't go another step. You're murdering me without a chance for an even 
break ...

MACK: A swell break you birds gave Mannington for his life. Come on now ... 
March .... (PAUSE)

	(SUDDEN FUSILLADE OF SHOTS AND SHATTERING OF GLASS AS RUDD 
	HAVING SLIPPED OUT AND AROUND TO WHITEY'S WINDOW STARTS 
	SHOOTING IT OUT WITH HIM ... TEN SHOTS IN ALL ... RUNNING 
	THROUGH NEXT TWO SPEECHES)

WADE: (WHEN SHOOTING BEGINS) What's that? Where's Barry? Hey ... Barry!

MACK: Where'd he go? .... Hey Barry ... (EXCITED)

	(GROAN AND THUD IN BACK ROOM ... THEN MOMENT OF COMPLETE 
	SILENCE ... FIRST BREAK IN SILENCE WHEN RUDD HURRIES BACK 
	ACROSS PORCH INTO ROOM)

RUDD: (FADING IN) It's O.K., boys, I got him coming out the window. Where's 
Mack?

WADE: He went into the back room.

MACK: (RAISING VOICE FROM BACK ROOM) You sure got him, Barry. (RETURNING TO 
OTHERS AND FADING IN RAPIDLY) He's dead, all right.

RUDD: Anybody else in there with him?

MACK: No.

RUDD: Then bang on that other door and tell my friend, Mrs. Jackson to come 
out.

	(DOOR OF THIRD ROOM OPENS)

GRACE: (INDIGNANTLY) You don't have to tell me ... <u>What</u> do you mean by 
breaking into my bungalow?

TYSON: Say, what do you birds think you're going to do to me?

RUDD: You're under arrest, charged with the murder of Patrolman Mannington ... 
And we're going to arrest Mrs. Jackson as an accomplice!

GRACE: An accomplice! How ridiculous! Your whole breaking into my bungalow is 
ridiculous. Why, you're the man who called himself Waters when you came to my 
home in Forest Hills ....

RUDD: That's right. Remember you invited me to call on you in Florida.

GRACE: I am going to Florida.

RUDD: Oh, no, you're not ... You're going with us to New York where your 
friend Tyson's going to face a jury.

TYSON: (DEFIANTLY) There isn't a jury they can get together that'll convict 
me. <u>You haven't a scrap of evidence</u>!

RUDD: Oh, no? How does it happen that Mannington's gun was parked alongside 
your bed.

TYSON: (WITH DEFIANT LAUGH) How are you going to prove that that's 
Mannington's rod?

RUDD: By the number on it.

TYSON: There's no number on it.

MACK: (DISGUSTED) That's right, Barry. He's filed the number off.

RUDD: W-e-l-l ... Here's something that he didn't file the number off.

GRACE: Give me that watch ... It's my husband's.

RUDD: Then why did you throw it out the window into the snow?

MACK: (SURPRISED) She did that, did she?

RUDD: Yes ... But I had the luck to be slipping around the house for Whitey 
just when she threw it out.

GRACE: (VIOLENTLY) I didn't throw that watch out ... I was frightened and 
opened the window to jump out ... My husband's watch was on the sill and fell 
out. (TIGERISH) Give it to me!

RUDD: (STERNLY) Stand where you are, Mrs. Jackson. Keep your eye on her, Wade. 
(SIGNIFICANTLY) This is a gold hunting-case watch ... and there was a gold 
hunting-case watch stolen from one of the customers in Tony's restaurant the 
night of the hold-up ... Have you got your note-book there, Mack?

MACK: Sure.

RUDD: Look up the figures on that watch and let's check them with this one.

MACK: Here's the arithmetic ... Case number 8-8-0-6-3.

RUDD: That's right - 8-8-0-6-3.

MACK: And the number of the movement is 6-600-4-0-6.

RUDD: 6-600-4-0-6. That checks all right.

MACK: A bookkeeper couldn't balance the figures prettier.

RUDD: (SHARPLY .. AS TYSON MAKES QUICK ATTEMPT TO THROW OFF HAND CUFFS AND GET 
AWAY) Oh, no, you don't, Tyson!

TYSON: (GASP OF EFFORT) Let go of me ....

RUDD: No use pulling on those bracelets, Tyson ... Come on, let's get back to 
New York where this watch will tell a lot more than <u>time</u> to a jury!

RADIO CAR VOICE: The Mannington Case ... Grace Jackson talked freely ... On 
long ride to city ... Tyson convicted ... Paid supreme penalty ... Next week 
... Chase with Barry Rudd ... over two continents after amazing criminal ..... 
Stand by ......
