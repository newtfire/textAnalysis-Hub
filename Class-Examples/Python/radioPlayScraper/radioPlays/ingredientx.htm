THE BOARD ROOM

SIR GEORGE: (bluff and hearty) Afternoon, Wilkinson

WILKINSON: (an over anxious worrying little man) Afternoon, Sir George.

SIR GEORGE: We the first?

WILKINSON: Apparently. Except for Stanton, of course. I've just been having a 
word with him.

SIR GEORGE: Stanton?

WILKINSON: The secretary.

SIR GEORGE: Of course. Couldn't quite connect the name for the moment. That's 
the worst of being on so many boards, you know. Mix 'em all up.

WILKINSON: Very easy thing to do.

SIR GEORGE: Well, what had he got to say?

WILKINSON: Not much. Cautious. But I understand the Chairman is to make this 
whole situation clear this afternoon.

SIR GEORGE: Good.

WILKINSON: There's no doubt it's wonderful stuff, this synthetic rubber of 
ours.

SIR GEORGE: Is it? I dare say.

WILKINSON: You haven't--?

SIR GEORGE: Do I look like a man that'd wear goloshes?

WILKINSON: (laughing) Good, Sir George, good.

SIR GEORGE: It's selling, though.

WILKINSON: We can't deliver it fast enough, so Stanton says. In fact-- 

SIR GEORGE: Well?

WILKINSON: Of course, I don't know anything, but you know what the Chairman is 
like.

SIR GEORGE: I do. What do you mean?

WILKINSON: He's taken on some large orders, so I hear in the city.

SIR GEORGE: All the better.

WILKINSON: (slowly) Ye-es. Better to go slow to start with, I always say.

SIR GEORGE: Rubbish, sir. Strike while the iron's hot.

WILKINSON: That's all very well, Sir George, but you know, this stuff is still 
more or less in the experimental stage, and-- Here's Stanton now.

STANTON: Afternoon, gentlemen.

SIR GEORGE: Afternoon, Stanton. Well, how are things with Synthetic Rubber, 
Limited, this afternoon?

STANTON: Er - satisfactory, I think, Sir George. The Chairman is going to lay 
all the facts before---

BRUCE: (hard, domineering) Boy!

BOY: Yes, B'wana.

BRUCE: Whisky peg.

BOY: Yes, B'wana.

BRUCE: Is B'wana Anderson there?

BOY: Go look see, B'wana.

BRUCE: Say B'wana Bruce want palaver. Savvy?

BOY: Yes, B'wana.

BRUCE: Blast this heat! A hundred and-- (He whistles) The white man's grave!

BOY: Whisky peg, B'wana. B'wana Anderson he come now.

BRUCE: Good. Hallo, Anderson. Boy! Whisky peg for B'wana Anderson.

BOY: Yes, B'wana.

ANDERSON: Good afternoon, sir.

BRUCE: Heard about the Doc?

ANDERSON: Fever?

BRUCE: Yes.

ANDERSON: I thought as much last night. This blasted country! It never seems 
to get you, sir.

BRUCE: It did, once. I've had it too often. Hardened. Wait till you've been 
here as long as I have.

ANDERSON: God forbid!

BOY: Whisky peg, B'wana.

BRUCE: Here's luck.

ANDERSON: Luck! Yes. I guess that's what we live on. That and whisky.

BRUCE: And a damned good combination too. Look here, I was wanting to see you. 
Hand over that map, will you? Thanks. How much have we got this week?

ANDERSON: About thirty tons.

BRUCE: Not enough. Now look here. This is roughly six miles to the inch. 
Here's the old pit and pit A -- where the river bends round. Now in my opinion 
the vein, or whatever you call it, <u>must</u> follow the course of the river. What 
do you think?

ANDERSON: I should say it's doubtful.

BRUCE: Well, you're a geologist, but you don't know everything, thank God. And 
anyway, we can always go look see.

ANDERSON: What is the idea, sir?

BRUCE: More dirt, my boy. I'm going to follow up this river and tap every bend 
as far as we can get.

ANDERSON: We haven't the labour.

BRUCE: We'll <u>get</u> the labour.

ANDERSON: But -- even if we get it, how'd you get the stuff down to the coast? 
The carriers-- 

BRUCE: Carriers, hell! A damned lot of lazy niggers. I've been father and 
Mother and Aunt Martha combined to this fancy dress parade so far, but now 
there's going to be a change. Drive, my boy. Drive, drive, drive!

ANDERSON: D'you think the natives'll stand for it?

BRUCE: They'll <u>have</u> to stand for it if I say so. Now see here. I want you to 
take little Robinson and half a dozen of these misbegotten exhibits and go up 
as far as--

afternoon, my lord.

LORD INGLEBY: (a fussy foolish old man) A'ternoon, Stanton. A'ternoon, George.

SIR GEORGE: Afternoon, Ingleby.

LORD INGLEBY: Just a minute, Stanton. There was something I particularly 
wanted to ask you.

STANTON: Yes, my lord.

LORD INGLEBY: This -- this synthetic rubber, now. What is it made of?

STANTON: Well, my lord, I'm afraid I--

LORD INGLEBY: Is the Chairman going to tell us? In my opinion the Chairman 
<u>ought</u> to tell us. Lady Ingleby was asking me only the other day what it was 
made of, and, 'pon my word, I didn't know.

STANTON: You remember, my lord, we agreed to leave the secret of the formula 
with the--

LORD INGLEBY: Yes, yes, yes. I know. But I think the Chairman ought to tell 
us. This Ingredient X now. We're getting that from Africa now, aren't we?

STANTON: (nervously) Yes, my lord, but of course we don't want anybody to--

LORD INGLEBY: No, no, no. Of course not. I'm as secret as the grave, but at 
the same time, I think the Chairman ought to--

SAILOR: Two points it is, sir.

(A whistle sounds, very high and shrill)

2nd SAILOR: Yes, sir?

FARRAR: Tell the steward if my soup isn't damned hot, I'll wring his neck.

2nd SAILOR: Yes, sir.

DEAN: (3rd officer) Hallo. Anything doing?

FARRAR: Not much.

DEAN: Been coming over a bit green, hasn't it?

FARRAR: She's dam' badly loaded, that's what it is. If I were the First, I'd 
be dam' well ashamed to send a dingy full of trippers across the Serpentine 
with a list like this, let alone a ruddy four thousand ton tramp.

DEAN: Has it shifted?

FARRAR: No, but it will, you mark my words. When you've been at sea as long as 
I have, me lad-- 

DEAN: I shall have been by next week.

FARRAR: Less of it. I'm turning in. It'll be all hands before tonight or I'm a 
Dutchman. Come and cock your eye at the chart, and then I'm off.

DEAN: Seen anything?

FARRAR: A floating palace about half an hour ago. P. and O. Gosh, some people 
don't know they're born. Look out!

DEAN: Getting up, isn't it?

FARRAR: It <u>would</u>! This'll just do in any chances we ever had of getting home

JONES: (a financier) So I told him I'd stand in ten thousand.

HARRIS: (another financier) You think it's as safe as all that?

JONES: Nothing's safe, my boy, but at the price it's worth risking.

HARRIS: What about Synthetic Rubber, Limited? Are you doing anything in that?

JONES: I took a few of the original shares. They're holding their first Annual 
Meeting today, I hear.

HARRIS: Going?

JONES: I may look in.

HARRIS: What do you think of it?

JONES: The rubber or the company?

HARRIS: Either.

JONES: It's early days yet. But there's a lot of money in it if the stuff's 
all right.

HARRIS: You bet there is.

ANDERSON: Hallo, Doc. How's the fever?

DOCTOR: Rotten. I say. How many mosquitoes are there in this infernal room? 
I've counted four millions.

ANDERSON: You've missed one, haven't you?

DOCTOR: I dare say. What's the news?

ANDERSON: Never is any in this God-forgotten hole. I say, Doc, it'll be about 
half-past two in the afternoon at home now, won't it?

DOCTOR: About that. Why?

ANDERSON: Think of Piccadilly Circus at this moment! All the people and the 
cars and--

DOCTOR: I'd rather think about a gallon of iced lager at the Café Royal.

ANDERSON: Gosh, yes. It seems like a million miles away.
 
DOCTOR: It is! Pass me that quinine, there's a good fellow, thanks.

ANDERSON: Oh, by the way, there <u>is</u> some news. I'm off up the river.
 
DOCTOR: What?

ANDERSON: The Chief wants to open up some more pits, and I'm off to look for 
the dirt higher up.
 
DOCTOR: Not what I should call healthy.

ANDERSON: What do you mean?
 
DOCTOR: Malaria. Niggers. Personally, I should say we've reached the limit of 
safety, and then some, where we are. They got a couple of the Swahili carriers 
this morning.

ANDERSON: Snakes?
 
DOCTOR: No. Niggers. Poisoned arrows out of the bush. They hadn't a chance.

ANDERSON: The swine! I've a good mind to--
 
DOCTOR: Take it easy, my boy. There's only one thing <u>you</u> can do.

ANDERSON: What's that?
 
DOCTOR: Sit down and wait until your own turn comes.

ANDERSON: Cheerful, aren't you!
 
DOCTOR: What's the thermometer?
 
ANDERSON: A hundred and ten.
 
DOCTOR: Is that all? I'm shivering. Blast this fever. I shall be light-headed 
before night. When are you off?

ANDERSON: I'm going out to tell off the boys for the trip now.
 
DOCTOR: Well, good luck.

ANDERSON: Thanks. Anything I can do before I go?

DOCTOR: You might leave the rest of the quinine where I can reach it. Thanks. 
And if you <u>could</u> kill off a few of the mosquitos-- Oh well, never mind.

ANDERSON: I say, Doc.

DOCTOR: Well?

ANDERSON: Why do we come here, anyway?

DOCTOR: God knows. Good-bye.

ANDERSON: Cheerio.

THE LABORATORY

MORRIS: (a business man) Well, how's the analysis going on?

FEWIN: (a chemist) All right -- up to a point.

MORRIS: What do you mean, up to a point? Is it rubber or <u>isn't</u> it?

FEWIN: Oh, it isn't rubber -- not natural rubber, that is. But as far as I can 
see it possesses all the usual properties of rubber.

MORRIS: (brusquely) We know that. Then the question is, what is it made of?

FEWIN: I don't know.

MORRIS: You don't know! Look here, you're an analytical chemist, and it's your 
job to know. What do you think I'm paying you for?

FEWIN: (coolly) Because you hope to make a million out of the formula for 
synthetic rubber -- if I can get it for you.

MORRIS: All right, all right. There's no need to get huffed. What's the result 
of the new tests?

FEWIN: The same as before. Every time I come up against this -- this stuff -- 
this new ingredient -- whatever it is. I can give you the whole formula, but 
for that -- weights, proportions, everything.

MORRIS: But what <u>is</u> this ingredient -- this new stuff?

FEWIN: I tell you I don't know. It's -- well, it's new, that's all there is to 
it.

MORRIS: Rubbish. There isn't anything new. Try again. Take more time.

FEWIN: It's not a question of time. If there's an analytical chemist in London 
can tell you what that stuff is, I'll eat all the rubber, real or synthetic, 
within ten miles. As far as I can see, it's a new element. It simply doesn't 
respond to any known tests.

MORRIS: But -- where do they get it from?

FEWIN: That's their secret.

MORRIS: Look here, Fewin, we <u>must</u> get it. I don't care how much I spend, we've 
simply got to--

MAC.: (a Scotsman) It is.

DEAN: I say, Mac, can you give her some more steam? There's a hell of a head 
sea meeting her.

MAC.: D'ye think we don't know that, down in the engine room? Man, we're fair

WILKINSON: But what <u>was</u> it? Anything to do with us?

WILKINSON: Not serious?

ANDERSON: How's it going, Robby?

ROBINSON: (A cheery youth) O.K. We've smashed up one of the wheel-barrows, 
though.

ANDERSON: How?

ROBINSON: Owen Nares there dropped it over the cliff. He looked pretty sick 
when I told him I'd stop it out of his wages.

ANDERSON: Serve him right. Does he think we bring wheel-barrows six hundred 
miles from the coast for him to smash? Clumsy devil!

ROBINSON: You sound cheerful. Anything doing?

ANDERSON: Yes, there <u>is</u>. I've got a little picnic party for you.

ROBINSON: Too hot. I say, I wish it would rain.

ANDERSON: You know dam' well it won't rain for six months yet. What do you say 
to a trip up the river?

ROBINSON: What river?

ANDERSON: The Thames, of course. Maidenhead. Dinner at Skindles. <u>This</u> river, 
you fathead.

ROBINSON: Why?

ANDERSON: The Chief is going to open up-- LOOK OUT! (There are two or three 
revolver shots.) By gad! They've got him!

ROBINSON: What was it?

ANDERSON: Didn't you see? He missed <u>you</u> by inches. It's got that chap through 
the neck, anyway. That arrow's poisoned. I shouldn't watch him die, if I were 
you. It isn't pretty. Makes you think.

ROBINSON: Did you get him?

ANDERSON: Don't think so. I'm a rotten shot with a revolver. But I expect I 
put the wind up him pretty thoroughly.

ROBINSON: Did you see him?

ANDERSON: Only a glimpse. Up country bush-nigger. I say, it looks healthy for 
our trip up the river, what?

ROBINSON: What trip?

ANDERSON: I was telling you. We're off for a couple of days prospecting, my

BRUCE: What's the matter?

ANDERSON: The boys won't go. 

BRUCE: What?
 
ANDERSON: It's wind up. Those swine got another while I was down with Robby's 
gang. They nearly got him.
 
BRUCE: Blast! Poison? 

ANDERSON: Yes. Poisoned arrow. The poor devil was dead in three minutes.  
That's three to-day, and the boys are getting nervy. 

BRUCE: Didn't you bag the fellow? 

ANDERSON: I had a pot at where I thought he was, but might as well let fly at 
a shadow.

bit, and leave the river until things have settled down?

up, too.

BRUCE: I know you will, laddie. What about Robinson?

ANDERSON: Of course, he's a bit new to it, but he's all right.
 
BRUCE: It wouldn't do to back out now. Tonga's a good nigger, but if you cave 
in before the best nigger in the world, he'll take advantage of it. It's a  
question of prestige. Besides, things <u>won't</u> settle down. Those bush-niggers 
are out to get us, and we've got to make the best of it and try to get them 
first, that's all. As for your double shifts, we can't do it. It'd kill even 
the natives to work in the heat of the day, and we'd go over like nine-pins.  
We <u>must</u> have more dirt. I've just got urgent cables from home. Here you are.

THE BOARD ROOM

CHAIRMAN: --with regard to the question of Ingredient X, raised by Lord 
Ingleby, I am afraid that I can add very little to what is already known to 
the Board. The manufacture of our product, synthetic rubber, depends 
absolutely upon this ingredient. I am not a chemist, and I cannot explain the 
matter scientifically, but it was the accidental discovery of Ingredient X, as 
we call it, which put our scientific staff upon the track of synthetic rubber. 
This ingredient, which is, I understand, a hitherto unknown element, we obtain 
from a district some six hundred miles from the west coast of Africa, and we 
have concession rights from the Government concerned. As a matter of fact, 
gentlemen, the concession rights are purely a matter of form, because the 
Government which granted them exercises no sort of control upon the natives in 
the interior, and can afford no protection to our representatives on the spot. 
The country is difficult and the inhabitants are an extremely mixed lot. We 
have given to our representative, Mr. Bruce, the fullest powers, with 
instructions to preserve the friendliest relationship with the natives. The 
very life of our company depends upon the continued supply of Ingredient X, 
and it is therefore vital that we should avoid friction of any kind with the 
local tribes. This should not be difficult. The native mind is simple and 
naturally kindly, like that of a child, and readily responds to acts of 
kindness and--

BRUCE: Probably not. It doesn't matter. Most of the boys will be streaking for 
the coast by this.

CHAIRMAN: Now that we have definitely secured the goodwill of the natives, it 
is time, I think, to enlarge our activities. And in this connection, 
gentlemen, I am not without a certain anxiety -- a passing anxiety, it is 
true, but for the moment sufficiently serious. I need not hide from you that 
there are certain firms, very large firms, who view our activities with 
mistrust, and who would welcome the -- er -- extinction of Synthetic Rubber, 
Limited. I have reason to believe that our products are being largely bought  
up by these firms, and Mr. Carrington, our manager, has some extremely large 
orders to meet. We expect the steamship <u>Yuanda</u> to reach port by Christmas at 
the latest, with a large consignment of Ingredient X, and I have cabled to Mr. 
Bruce to treble the output at his end. In the meantime, gentlemen, I do not 
wish to disguise from you that the non-arrival of the <u>Yuanda</u> would place us in 
a very awkward position with regard to our contracts, a position which--
