???? I've been having these weird thoughts lately... Like, is any of this for real or not?
Voice So much to do, so little time... Take your time. Don't be afraid. The door is still shut. Now, step forward. Can you do it?
Voice Power sleeps within you...
Voice If you give it form...
Voice It will give you strength.
Voice Choose well.
Voice The power of the mystic. Inner strength. A staff of wonder and ruin. Is this the power you seek?
???? Yes.
Voice Your path is set.
Voice Now, what will you give up in exchange?
Voice The power of the warrior. Invincible courage. A sword of terrible destruction. You give up this power?
???? Yes.
Voice You've chosen the power of the mystic. You've given up the power of the warrior. Is this the form you choose?
???? Yes.
Voice You gained the power to fight.
Voice All right! You've got it. Use this power to protect yourself and others.
Voice There will be times you have to fight. Keep your light burning strong.
Voice Behind you!
???? I can't open it...
Voice Hold on. The door won't open just yet. First, tell me more about yourself.
??????? What's most important to you?
???? Friendship.
??????? Is friendship such a big deal?
????? What do you want outta life?
???? To be strong.
????? To be strong, huh?
????? What are you so afraid of?
???? Being indecisive.
????? Being indecisive? Is that really so frightening?
Voice You want friendship. You want to be strong. You're afraid of being indecisive. Your adventure begins in the dead of night. Your road won't be easy, but a rising sun awaits your journey's end.
???? Sounds good.
Voice The day you will open the door is both far off and very near.
Voice The closer you get to the light, the greater your shadow becomes.
Voice But don't be afraid. And don't forget...
Voice ---But don't be afraid.
Voice You hold the mightiest weapon of all.
Voice So don't forget...
Voice You are the one who will open the door.
???? Whoa!
???? Gimme a break, Kairi.
Kairi Sora, you lazy bum. I knew that I'd find you snoozing down here.
Sora No! This huge, black THING swallowed me up! I couldn't breathe! I couldn't--
Sora Ow!
Kairi Are you still dreaming?
Sora It wasn't a dream! Or was it? I don't know.
Sora What was that place? So bizarre...
Kairi Yeah, sure.
Sora Say, Kairi, what was your hometown like? You know, where you grew up.
Kairi I've told you before, I don't remember.
Sora Nothing at all?
Kairi Nothing.
Sora You ever want to go back?
Kairi (thinking) Hmm. Well, I'm happy here.
Sora Really...
Kairi But you know... I wouldn't mind going to see it.
Sora I'd like to see it too. Along with any other worlds out there. I wanna see 'em all!
Kairi (facing him) So what're we waiting for?
???? Hey!
Riku Aren't you guys forgetting about me? So, I guess I'm the only one working on the raft.
Riku And you're just as lazy as he is!
Kairi (giggling) So you noticed. Okay, we'll finish it together.
Kairi I'll race you!
Sora Huh?
Riku What, are you kidding?
Kairi (giggling) Ready? Go!
Kairi So, can you gather the rest of the supplies? Sora, are you listening to me?
Sora Yeah, I heard you.
Kairi Okay, here's what you need to go find: Two Logs, One Cloth, One Rope. Bring everything back here. If you need help, just ask. I'm counting on you!
Wakka Hey, what's happening man?
Selphie Ah, the breeze feels great!
Selphie Aww, I can’t believe I lost!
Tidus Hey, Sora! You feelin' lucky today!
Tidus Man, I’m really off today.
Sora Aww, man. Now the score’s 0 to 1!
Kairi Thanks, Sora! I found something today, too. Here, it's yours.
Kairi Tired? Want to call it a day?
Sora Yeah, let's go home.
Kairi Okay. It is getting late. We'll finish up tomorrow.
Sora So, Kairi's home is out there somewhere, right?
Riku Could be. We'll never know by staying here.
Sora But how far could a raft take us?
Riku Who knows? If we have to, we'll think of something else.
Kairi So, suppose you get to another world. (giggle) What would you do there?
Riku Well, I haven't really thought about it.
Riku It's just... I've always wondered why we're here on this island. If there are any other worlds out there, why did we end up on this one? And suppose there are other worlds... Then ours is just a little piece of something much greater. So we could've just as easily ended up somewhere else, right?
Sora (laying down on the tree) I don't know.
Riku Exactly. That's why we need to go out there and find out. Just sitting here won't change a thing. It's the same old stuff. So let's go.
Kairi You've been thinking a lot lately, haven't you?
Riku Thanks to you. If you hadn't come here, I probably would've never thought of any of this. Kairi, thanks.
Kairi You're welcome.
Riku Sora.
Riku You wanted one, didn't you?
Sora A paopu fruit...
Riku If two people share one, their destinies become intertwined. They'll remain a part of each other's lives no matter what.
Riku C'mon, I know you want to try it.
Sora What are you talking--
Donald Good morning, Your Majesty.
Donald It's nice to see you this morn--
Donald What!
Donald Wake up, Goofy, wake up! This is serious!!
Goofy Hey there, Donald. G'morning.
Donald We've got a problem, Goofy! But don't tell anyone...
Goofy (ignoring Donald) Queen Minnie?
Donald Not even the queen.
Goofy Daisy?
Donald (shaking his head furiously) No, it's top secret!
Goofy (calling over Donald's shoulder) G'morning, ladies.
Donald What?
Riku Hey, Sora. Our raft still needs a name. Let's see... How about Highwind? What would you call it?
Sora Me? Well...hm... Excalibur!
Riku Hey, how about...
Sora The usual?
Riku Let's do it!
Kairi You guys at it again? All right, I'll be the judge. The usual rules apply. Take any route you want... First one to tag that tree and make it back here wins.
Sora If I win, I'm captain! And if you win...
Riku I get to share the paopu with Kairi.
Sora Huh?
Riku Deal? The winner gets to share a paopu with Kairi.
Sora Wha... Wait a minute...
Kairi Okay! On my count:
Kairi Three! Two! One! Go!
Sora Now the score’s 1 to 1!
Riku Man, lighten up. It’s just a name, after all.
Kairi (smiling) Today we collect provisions for our trip! Let’s see. Sora, you’re looking for... One Seagull Egg, Three Mushrooms, Two Coconuts, Three Fish, and fill this up with Drinking Water. But not from the ocean!
Kairi Bring everything back here. If you need help, just ask.
Selphie Hey, Sora. Have you heard about the legendary power of the paopu fruit? They say if you share it with someone you really care for, it binds you together forever and ever through eternity! It's so romantic. I gotta try it sometime.
Tidus I think you've gotten stronger, but odds are you're still no match for Riku. We took him on three-to-one last time, and he whipped us all. Well, I guess Kairi can always count on him.
Wakka Me and Tidus, we are gonna do a little explorin' today. You know, to the secret place at the base of that tree. There's gotta be something there, ya?
Sora Wh-who’s there?
????? I’ve come to see the door to this world.
Sora Huh?
????? This world has been connected.
Sora Wh-What are you talking about?
????? Tied to the darkness... Soon to be completely eclipsed.
Sora Well, whoever you are, stop freaking me out like this. Huh?
Sora Wh-Where did you come from?
????? You do not yet know what lies beyond the door.
Sora So, you’re from another world!
????? There is so very much to learn. You understand so little.
Sora (glaring) Oh, yeah? Well, you’ll see. I’m gonna get out and learn what’s out there!
????? A meaningless effort. One who knows nothing can understand nothing.
Kairi This? I’m making a necklace of thalassa shells. In the old days, sailors always wore thalassa shells. They were supposed to ensure a safe voyage. See this?
Kairi It’s a charm to help us find each other if we ever get separated. The three of us will always be together.
Kairi Thanks, Sora! I found something today, too. Here, it’s yours.
Kairi Tired? Want to call it a day?
Sora Yeah, let’s go home.
Kairi Okay, tomorrow’s the big day. We should rest up!
Kairi You know, Riku has changed.
Sora What do you mean?
Kairi Well...
Sora You okay?
Kairi Sora, let’s take the raft and go—just the two of us!
Sora Huh?
Kairi (giggling) Just kidding.
Sora What’s gotten into you? You’re the one that’s changed, Kairi.
Kairi Maybe... You know, I was a little afraid at first, but now I’m ready. No matter where I go or what I see, I know I can always come back here.
Kairi Right?
Sora Yeah, of course!
Kairi That’s good.
Kairi Sora, don’t ever change.
Sora Huh?
Kairi I just can’t wait. Once we set sail, it’ll be great.
Daisy Oh, dear! What could this mean?
Minnie It means we’ll just have to trust the king.
Goofy Gawrsh, I sure hope he’s all right.
Donald Your Highness. Don’t worry. We’ll find the king and this key.
Minnie Thank you, both of you.
Donald Daisy, can you take care of the—
Daisy Of course. You be careful, now, both of you.
Minnie Oh, and to chronicle your travels, he will accompany you.
?????? Over here!
?????? Cricket’s the name. Jiminy Cricket, at your service.
Minnie We hope for your safe return. Please help the king.
Donald You’re coming, too!
Goofy Gawrsh, Jiminy, your world disappeared, too?
Jiminy It was terrible. We were scattered. And as far as I can see, I’m the only one who made it to this castle.
Donald (sternly) Goofy?
Goofy Oh, right... I gotcha. Ya mean, while we’re in other worlds, we can’t let on where we’re from. We’ve gotta protect the world border.
Donald Order.
Goofy Right. World order.
Goofy I guess we’ll need new duds when we get there.
Donald Hello up there? Donald Duck to launch crew! Anytime you’re ready.
Donald Blast off!!
Kairi I just can’t wait. Once we set sail, it’ll be great.
Sora A storm?
Sora Oh, no, the raft!
Sora’s Mom Sora, dinner’s ready. Come on down. Sora?
Sora What’s that?
Sora Riku’s boat. And Kairi’s!
Sora Where’s Kairi? I thought she was with you!
Riku The door has opened...
Sora What?
Riku (facing Sora) The door has opened, Sora! Now we can go to the outside world!
Sora What are you talking about? We’ve gotta find Kairi!
Riku (abruptly) Kairi’s coming with us!
Riku Once we step through, we might not be able to come back. We may never see our parents again. There’s no turning back. But this may be our only chance. We can’t let fear stop us! I’m not afraid of the darkness!
Sora (uneasily) Riku...
Voice Keyblade... Keyblade...
Sora Kairi!
Kairi Sora...
Sora Whoa!
Goofy Look, a star’s goin’ out!
Donald Come on. Let’s hurry.
Donald Where’s that key...
Goofy Hey, ya know, maybe we ought to go find Leon.
Goofy Uh, Donald. Ya know, I betcha that...
Donald Aw, what do you know, you big palooka?
Goofy What do I know? Hmm...
Goofy (calling) Come on, Pluto.
Sora What a dream...
Sora This isn’t a dream!
Sora Where am I?
Sora Oh, boy.
Sora Do you know where we are?
Sora Hey...
Sora This is totally weird... I’m in another world!
??? Hey there, how can I... Aw, it’s only a kid.
Sora I’m not a kid! And the name’s Sora!
??? Okay, okay, simmer down. So why the long face, Sora? You lost or somethin’?
Sora No! Well, maybe. Where are we?
??? Huh?
Sora Traverse Town... So, gramps, is this really another world?
??? Don’t call me gramps! The name’s Cid!
Cid Anyway... Not sure what you’re talkin’ about, but this sure ain’t your island.
Sora Hmm... Guess I’d better start looking for Riku and Kairi.
Cid Well, good luck with whatever it is you’re doing. If you ever run into trouble, you come to me.
Sora It’s those creatures from the island!
Goofy (looking around) Doesn’t look like he’s here.
Donald Keep looking!
Donald Hmph. Where is he?
Goofy (calling) Leeeooon!
Donald Not here, either.
Goofy This could take a while...
Donald (calling) Leeeon! Mister Leon?
Goofy (calling) Where are you?
Cid Still haven’t found ‘em? Keep your chin up. Take another look around town.
?????? They’ll come at you out of nowhere.
Sora (whirling around) Who are you?
?????? And they’ll keep on coming at you, as long as you continue to wield the Keyblade.
?????? But why? Why would it choose a kid like you?
Sora What’s that supposed to mean?
?????? Never mind. Now, let’s see that Keyblade.
Sora What? There’s no way you’re getting this!
?????? All right, then have it your way.
?????? Hey, you found it. Nice going, Leon.
Leon Still... It looks like things are worse than we thought. A lot worse.
Riku Where...am I?
Riku (calling) Sora! Kairi!
Goofy Gawrsh, there’s nobody here. Sure is spooky!
Donald Aw, phooey. I’m not scared.
?????? Excuse me. Did the king send you?
Kairi Come on, lazy bum. Wake up.
Kairi You okay?
Sora I guess...
Kairi Those creatures that attacked you are after the Keyblade. But it’s your heart they really want, because you wield the Keyblade.
Sora I’m so glad that you’re okay, Kairi.
Kairi Kairi? Who are you talking about?
?????? I’m the great ninja Yuffie.
Sora Huh?
Yuffie I think you might’ve overdone it, Squall.
Leon That’s Leon.
Sora The Keyblade...
Yuffie Yeah, we had to get it away from you to shake off those creatures. It turns out that’s how they were tracking you.
Leon (crossing his arms) It was the only way to conceal your heart from them. But it won’t work for long.
Leon Still hard to believe that you of all people are the chosen one.
Leon Well, I suppose beggars can’t be choosers.
Sora Why don’t you start making sense! What’s going on here?
Aerith Okay, you know there are many other worlds out there besides your castle and this town, right?
Donald Yeah.
Goofy But they’re supposed to be a secret.
Aerith They’ve been secret because they’ve never been connected. Until now.
Aerith When the Heartless came, everything changed.
Sora The Heartless?
Yuffie The ones who attacked you, you remember?
Leon Those without hearts.
Yuffie The darkness in people’s hearts—that’s what attracts them.
Leon And there is darkness within every heart.
Yuffie Hey, have you heard of someone named Ansem?
Goofy Ansem?
Aerith He was studying the Heartless. He recorded all of his findings in a very detailed report.
Goofy Gawrsh, uh, can we see it?
Aerith (shaking her head) It’s pages are scattered everywhere.
Donald Scattered?
Aerith To many worlds.
Goofy Oh, then maybe the king went to find ‘em.
Aerith Yes, those were my thoughts exactly.
Goofy We’ve gotta find him quick!
Donald Wait!
Donald First, we need that key!
Aerith That’s right. The Keyblade.
Sora So...this is the key?
Yuffie (nodding) Exactly!
Leon The Heartless have great fear of the Keyblade.
Leon That’s why they’ll keep coming after you no matter what.
Sora Well, I didn’t ask for this.
Yuffie The Keyblade chooses its master. And it chose you.
Leon So tough luck.
Sora How did all this happen? I remember being in my room...
Sora Wait a minute! What happened to my home? My island? Riku! Kairi!
Leon You know what? I really don’t know.
Yuffie Hey, cheer up! I’ve heard that the Keyblade can open all sorts of locks. Give it a try the next time you find a treasure chest or door lock!
Leon Sooner or later, the Heartless will find you. You’d best prepare yourself.
Sora Prepare myself?
Leon To fight for your life. Are you ready?
Sora I’m ready!
Leon Yuffie, let’s go join Aerith. She should be there now with the other visitors.
Yuffie Leon!
Leon Yuffie, go!
Aerith Yuffie?
Leon Sora, let’s go!
Leon Don’t bother with the small fry. Find the leader! Let’s go!
Goofy Gawrsh, are these the Heartless guys?
Donald Let’s go get ‘em, Goofy!
Donald & Goofy The key!
Sora So, you were looking for me?
Donald & Goofy (nodding) Uh-huh!
Leon (arms crossed) They, too, have been seeking the wielder of the Keyblade.
Goofy Hey, why don’t you come with us? We can go to other worlds on our vessel.
Sora (facing downward) I wonder if I could find Riku and Kairi...
Donald Of course.
Goofy (to Donald) Are you sure?
Donald (to Goofy) Who knows? But we need him to come with us to help us find the king.
Leon Sora, go with them. Especially if you want to find your friends.
Sora (halfheartedly) Yeah, I guess.
Donald But you can’t come along looking like that. Understand?
Donald No frowning. No sad face. Okay?
Goofy (interjecting) Yeah, ya gotta look funny, like us!
Donald This boat runs on happy faces.
Sora Happy?
Goofy (pointing) That’s one funny face!
Sora (standing up) Okay, why not? I’ll go with you guys.
Donald (holding out a hand) Donald Duck.
Goofy (doing the same) Name’s Goofy.
Sora (doing the same) I’m Sora.
Goofy All for one, one for all.
????? That little squirt took down that Heartless! Who’d have thought it?
????? Such is the power of the Keyblade. The child’s strength is not his own.
?????? Why don’t we turn him into a Heartless?
?????? That’ll settle things quick enough.
???? And the brat’s friends are the king’s lackeys. Swoggle me eyes, they’re all bilge rats by the look of them.
????? You’re no prize yourself.
???? Shut up!
?????????? Enough.
?????????? The Keyblade has chosen him. Will it be he who conquers the darkness? Or will the darkness swallow him? Either way, he could be quite useful.
Leon Make sure you’re prepared for the journey ahead of you. We don’t know how far the Heartless have spread.
Yuffie Check out the shops here. They’ve got some pretty neat stuff!
Aerith This is from all of us.
Aerith Spend it as you see fit. And this is from Leon.
Yuffie Good luck!
Aerith I hope you find your friends.
Leon Look out for each other. Keep your spirits up.
Donald The gummi ship is outside that gate.
Sora The what?
Donald That’s our ship.
Goofy Wait ‘til you see it!
Donald Hold on. Sora, this is for you.
Donald Now you can use magic, too. Goofy, give him that other thing.
Goofy What?
Donald You know!
Goofy Oh, yeah.
Goofy Abilities allow you to do all sorts of things. Guess we should look for ‘em along the way, huh?
Sora Okay, is that it? Let’s get going!
Donald Not ‘til we’re ready!
Jiminy (to himself) Well, I see big adventures coming their way! Looks like it’s up to me to keep track of it all in my journal!
Leon There are Dalmatians named Pongo and Perdita living in the Second District...
Sora What’s wrong?
Leon They’re quite upset, these Dalmatians. They’ve lost their puppies.
Yuffie Squall can’t stop worrying about them.
Leon Call me Leon.
Aerith Sora, would you look for the puppies?
Leon Help them out.
Aerith Please, find the puppies for him.
Yuffie Squa--I mean, Leon--is really cute sometimes.
Donald We travel to different worlds on the gummi ship.
Goofy The Heartless ships often give us a hard time.
Donald Always be on the lookout during flight.
Goofy Your journey will be documented until you reach your destination.
Donald Seek out the missions each world has to offer!
White Rabbit Oh, my fur and whiskers! I’m late, I’m late, I’m late!
White Rabbit Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear! I’m here, I should be there.
White Rabbit I’m late, I’m late, I’m late! The queen, she’ll have my head for sure!
Sora How did he get so small?
Doorknob No, you’re simply too big.
Donald It talks!
Doorknob Must you be so loud? You woke me up.
Goofy (cheerfully) Good morning.
Doorknob Good night! I need a bit more sleep.
Sora Wait, what do we have to do to grow small?
Doorknob Why don’t you try the bottle...over there?
White Rabbit Court is now in session!
Alice I’m on trial? But why?
White Rabbit Her Majesty, the Queen of Hearts, presiding!
Queen of Hearts This girl is the culprit. There’s no doubt about it. And the reason is...because, I say so, that’s why!
Alice That is so unfair!
Queen of Hearts Well, have you anything to say in your defense?
Alice Of course! I’ve done absolutely nothing wrong!
Alice You may be queen, but I’m afraid that doesn’t give you the right to be so...so mean!
Queen of Hearts (yelling) Silence! You dare defy me?
Sora Hey, guys, we should help her out.
Donald Yeah, but the--
Goofy We’re outsiders, so wouldn’t that be muddling?
Donald Meddling!
Goofy Oh, yeah. A-hyuck! And that’s against the rules.
Queen of Hearts The court finds the defendant...
Queen of Hearts Guilty as charged!
Queen of Hearts For the crimes of assault and attempted theft of my heart...
Queen of Hearts (yelling) Off with her head!
Alice No! No! Oh, please!
Sora (running in) Hold it right there!
Queen of Hearts (angrily) Who are you? How dare you interfere with my court?
Sora Excuse me. But we know who the real culprit is!
Goofy Uh-huh. It’s the Heartle—
Sora Anyway, she’s not the one you’re looking for.
Queen of Hearts That’s nonsense. Have you any proof?
Queen of Hearts Bring me evidence of Alice’s innocence! Fail, and it’s off with all of your heads! Gather as much or little evidence as you please. Report back here once you’re ready.
Alice Who are you?
Sora I’m Sora.
Goofy I’m Goofy, and that there’s Donald.
Alice Pleased to meet you, though I do wish it were under better circumstances. I’m sorry you got mixed up in this nonsense.
Sora Why are you on trial in the first place?
Alice I should like to know the very same thing! Apparently I was guilty from the moment I took the stand!
Sora That’s crazy! So, where are you from?
Alice Hmm, curious. I can’t quite remember. You see, I found this mysterious rabbit hole. When I tried to peek inside, I tumbled in head over heels... And I found myself here.
Sora So you’re from another world!
Goofy That’s funny. Maybe you don’t need a ship, then.
Donald I don’t get it.
Alice What do you mean another world?
Card Soldier Enough! The defendant will be silent!
Donald (yelling) Who are you?
Cheshire Cat Who, indeed? Poor Alice. Soon to lose her head, and she’s not guilty of a thing!
Sora Hey, if you know who the culprit is, tell us!
Cheshire Cat The Cheshire Cat has all the answers—but doesn’t always tell. The answer, the culprit, the cat all lie in darkness.
Sora Wait!
Cheshire Cat They’ve already left the forest. I won’t tell which exit. There are four pieces of evidence in all. Three are a cinch to find. The fourth is tricky. Big reward if you find them all.
Donald Should we trust him?
Cheshire Cat To trust, or not to trust? I trust you’ll decide!
Cheshire Cat Well, look what you’ve found. Nice going.
Sora Now we can save Alice.
Cheshire Cat Don’t be so sure! She may be innocent, but what about you?
Sora What do you mean?
Cheshire Cat I won’t tell. But I’ll give you something.
Card Soldier Are you ready to present evidence before the queen?
Sora Yes.
Card Soldier Very well. Counsel, step up to the podium.
Queen of Hearts Now, show me what you have found.
Queen of Hearts Well, that’s certainly a lot of evidence, but I’m still not impressed. Cards! Bring forth my evidence!
Queen of Hearts Hmm, checking all five would only be a waste of time. All right, then. Choose the one you wish to present. I’ll decide who’s guilty based on that evidence.
Sora What? After all the trouble of collecting it?
Queen of Hearts (yelling) You dare object? Then you will lose your head! Now, choose! One box!
Queen of Hearts Are you certain? No second chances!
Sora I’m sure.
Queen of Hearts Now we shall see who the real culprit is.
Queen of Hearts What in the world was that?
Sora There’s your evidence. Alice is innocent.
Queen of Hearts Rrrrrrrgh... Silence! I’m the law here!
Queen of Hearts Article 29: Anyone who defies the queen is guilty!
Donald (jumping up and down) That’s crazy!
Queen of Hearts (shouting) Seize them at once!
Queen of Hearts Cards! If they touch the tower, you lose your heads!
Queen of Hearts Get them, you fools! Quit joking around!
Queen of Hearts (angrily) Why, you!
Donald She must’ve gotten kidnapped while we were fighting.
Queen of Hearts (slamming her fist) You fools!
Queen of Hearts Find the one who’s behind this! I don’t care how!
Card Soldier I just looked away for a moment, and...
Sora Have you seen Alice?
Cheshire Cat Alice, no. Shadows, yes!
Goofy Where did they go?
Cheshire Cat This way? That way? Does it matter? Left, right, up, down! All mixed up thanks to the shadows! Step deeper into the forest to the deserted garden. You might find shadows in the upside-down room!
Flower Give me a potion and I’ll make you bigger.
Cheshire Cat They’re hiding somewhere. And the momeraths outgrabe. Want to find the shadows? Try turning on the light.
Cheshire Cat It’s too dim. Make it brighter.
Sora What next?
Cheshire Cat One more lamp that you need to light.
Cheshire Cat All the lights are on. You’ll see the shadows soon. They’ll arise in this room, but somewhere else. The shadows might go after that doorknob, too.
Cheshire Cat You’ll have a better view from higher up.
Cheshire Cat The shadows should be here soon.
Cheshire Cat Are you prepared for the worst? If not, too bad!
Doorknob What a racket. How’s a doorknob to get any sleep?
Donald What was that?
Sora You hear that? Sounded like something closed.
Goofy This gummi ain’t like the others. No, sir.
Donald Okay, I’ll hold on to it.
Cheshire Cat Splendid. You’re quite the hero. If you’re looking for Alice, she’s not here. She’s gone! Off with the shadows, into darkness.
Sora No...
Donald Let’s go back to our gummi ship. We might find her in another world.
Goofy We've gotta go to a save point to return to our ship.
Sora Um...
???? (without looking) Good timing. Give me a hand, will ya? Move that pedestal over there for me.
???? I gotta spruce this place up for the games.
Sora It weighs a ton!
Sora It’s way too heavy!
???? What? Too heavy? Since when have you been such a little—
Philoctetes Oh. Wrong guy. What’re you doing here?
Philoctetes This here’s the world-famous Coliseum—heroes only! And I got my hands full preparing for the games. So run along, pip-squeaks.
Philoctetes Look, it’s like this.
Philoctetes Heroes are coming from all over to fight ferocious monsters right here in the Coliseum.
Donald (crossing his arms) You’ve got heroes standing right in front of you.
Goofy Yup. He’s a real hero chosen by the Keyblade!
Donald (pointing to himself) And we’re heroes, too.
Philoctetes (shocked) Hero? That runt?
Sora What’s so funny? I’ve fought a bunch of monsters!
Philoctetes Hey, if you can’t even move this...
Philoctetes You can’t call yourself...
Philoctetes A hero!
Philoctetes Okay, so it takes more than brawn.
Philoctetes Well, well, let’s see what you can do. This trial is tough. You got what it takes? You ready?
Sora I’m ready!
Philoctetes Okay, kid. Let’s see what you’ve got.
Philoctetes The rules are simple: Bust all the barrels within the time limit. Ready? Go!
Philoctetes Not bad! For a beginner, that is.
Philoctetes Hey, you’re better than I thought!
Philoctetes You know, you ain’t bad, kid.
Sora Looks like I’m headed for the games.
Philoctetes Afraid not.
Sora (surprised) Why not?
Philoctetes Two words: You guys ain’t heroes.
Sora Come on!
Philoctetes Wanna become a real hero? Start by mastering this spell.
Hades Rather a stubborn old goat, wouldn’t you say?
Donald Who are you?
Hades Whoa, hold on there, fuzz boy. Wait, let me guess. You want to enter the games, right?
Hades Well, then, hey, get a load of this.
Sora A pass?
Hades It’s all yours.
Hades Good luck, kid. I’m pulling for you, little shorty.
Philoctetes Hey, how’d you get this?
Sora Can we enter the games now?
Philoctetes Well... I guess so. We start with the preliminaries! Some real weirdos signed up for the games. Better watch yourself.
Philoctetes You’re no heroes yet, but you ain’t doing bad. Lucky you came to me for coaching.
Philoctetes Something tells me he’ll be a tough one to beat. Who knows, maybe you’ll end up facing him.
Philoctetes Say, you’re better than I thought, kid! Wish he was here to see this.
Sora Who?
Philoctetes Hercules. He’s a hero if ever there was one. Too bad he’s off visiting his father.
Hades That little punk is your next opponent, okay?
Hades Now, don’t blow it. Just take him out.
Cloud The great god of the Underworld is afraid of a kid? Sorry, but my contract says—
Hades (snappy) I know! You think I don’t know? I wrote the contract! I know it says you’re only required to kill Hercules in this tournament. But you’ve gotta fight that kid to get to him. Come on.
Hades Hey, it’s like that old goat says: Rule 11: It’s all just a game, so let loose and have fun with it!
Hades I mean, a casualty along the way is no big deal, right?
Hades Geez. Stiffer than the stiffs back home. Still, suckers like him are hard to come by...
Cloud That’s the best you can do?
Hades Oh, right, there was one other rule I forgot: Accidents happen.
Philoctetes Herc!
Hercules Phil, get them out of here!
Philoctetes Whew, that was close! That was Cerberus, the guardian of the Underworld. Herc should be able to handle him. But then again, maybe not... This doesn’t look good. I hope Herc’s okay. Wish I could go in!
Philoctetes Kid, you’re not entering the arena, are ya? This ain’t just some match. This is for real!
Sora I’m not afraid. You can decide if I’m hero material or not.
Philoctetes Careful, kid!
Philoctetes Kid, I got two words of advice for you: Attack!
Philoctetes Thus, I do hereby dub thee junior heroes, and confer upon thee full rights and privileges to participate in the games. Further—
Donald Hey! What do you mean junior heroes?
Philoctetes You rookies still don’t understand what it takes to be a true hero.
Goofy So, what does it take?
Hercules Well, that’s just something you’ll have to find out for yourselves. Just the way that I did.
Sora No problem. We’ll start by proving ourselves in the games.
Philoctetes There ain’t gonna be any games for a while.
Philoctetes Gotta clean up the mess from that last battle first.
Sora Okay, we’ll be back.
Philoctetes I still can’t believe that squirt actually beat Cerberus.
Hercules (to Phil) Just between us, I’d already worn Cerberus down by the time the little guy jumped in.
Philoctetes My lips are sealed.
Sora Hey, are you all right?
Cloud Yeah.
Sora So why did you go along with him, anyway?
Cloud I’m looking for someone. Hades promised to help. I tried to exploit the power of darkness, but it backfired.
Cloud I fell into darkness, and I couldn’t find the light.
Sora You’ll find it. I’m searching, too.
Cloud For your light?
Cloud Don’t lose sight of it.
Sora How about a rematch sometime? Fair and square, no dark powers involved.
Cloud I think I’ll pass.
Hades He’s strong, he’s kind.
Hades He’s always there for you, and he’s handsome to boot.
Hades He’s perfect. Perfect. Perfectly infuriating! He makes me crazy.
Hades Wait a minute. What are you worried about? All the pieces are in place. Relax. Here’s what you do. Let Hercules train the kid. In the next games, I’ll take care of them both.
Hades Who invited you to the party? Stay out of this. This is my show.
?????????? As you wish. Fight to your heart’s content.
Goofy Hey, Donald, maybe King Mickey’s down there.
Donald In a backwater place like that? No way! Let’s move on.
Sora Hold on. Riku and Kairi might be down there. Let’s just check it out.
Donald Forget it! We’re on an important mission!
Sora Just land!
Donald No!
Sora Come on!
Donald Aw, phooey!
Sora We’re landing!
Donald Don’t touch that! Nooo!
Sora Oww...my head...
Sora Donald? Goofy?
?????? Sabor, danger.
Sora Um...thank you.
?????? (slowly) Thank you.
Sora Huh? Uh, what is this place?
?????? This place, this place.
Sora Okaaay... Where did the others go?
Sora Look, I got separated from my friends. Have you seen them?
Sora (miming) Friends...
?????? (mimicking) Friends!
Sora Right, my friends! There’s two of ‘em. The loud one is Dona—
Sora You know what? Never mind. I’m looking for my friends, Riku and Kairi.
?????? (slowly) Look for Riku, friends?
Sora (nodding) Right!
?????? Kairi, friends?
Sora Uhh...right...
?????? Friends here.
Sora Really!?
Sora Huh?
?????? Friends here.
Sora Not sure I understand, but show me! Take me to Riku and Kairi!
?????? (pointing to himself) Tarzan. Tarzan go.
Sora (pointing to himself) And I’m...Sora. Tarzan go, Sora go go!
Goofy Gawrsh, where are we?
Goofy I sure hope Sora’s okay.
Donald (sitting up) Aw, who needs him? We can find the king without him.
Donald Huh?
Tarzan Jane!
Jane Tarzan!
Jane Oh, and who is this?
Sora Uh, hi there. I’m—
Jane Oh, you speak English! So, then, obviously, you’re not related to Tarzan...
Jane Are you here to study the gorillas?
??????? Highly doubtful.
Goofy Sora!
Sora Goofy! Donald!
??????? A circus of clowns. Not much use for hunting gorillas.
Jane (frowning) Mr. Clayton, we’re studying them, not hunting them. This is research.
Jane Well, the more the merrier. Do make yourselves at home.
Sora Well, anyway...
Donald & Sora (grouchily) I’m staying.
Sora (surprised) Huh?
Goofy Sora, look what we found. Look at this.
Sora What’s that?
Goofy A gummi block. It’s the same stuff used to build our ship.
Sora So that means...
Donald The king could be here. So, we’ve gotta work together to look for him. For now.
Sora Fine. I’ll let you tag along. For now.
Jane Apparently Tarzan was raised in the jungle by the gorillas. Communicating with him still isn’t easy, but he’s learning.
Sora So he was speaking in gorilla back there...
Jane Ah, that’s right. You’re looking for your friends?
Sora He said Riku and Kairi are here. And one word I couldn’t understand...
Jane (showing them the projector) Why don’t we try this? We’ll show Tarzan some slides and see if any of them match that word. Oh, what happened to the slides?
Clayton Clayton’s the name. I’m a hunter, not a researcher. What? No, I am not trying to hunt the gorillas. But they’re so rare! I’d just like to get a look at them.
Goofy What’s wrong, Sora?
Sora What? Um...nothing. (thinking) This place... It just looks so familiar. But how? I’ve never been off my island.
Jane Well, Tarzan?
Sora Where are my friends, Riku and Kairi?
Sora Hey, I thought—
Clayton (entering) That leaves just one place.
Clayton Young man, we’ve been in this jungle for some time now. But we have yet to encounter these friends of yours. I’d wager they’re with the gorillas. But Tarzan refuses to take us to them.
Jane Really, Mr. Clayton. Tarzan wouldn’t hide—
Clayton Then take us there! Take us to the gorillas.
Clayton (miming) Go-ril-las.
Jane Tarzan...are you sure?
Tarzan Tarzan go see Kerchak.
Jane Kerchak?
Clayton He must be the leader. Perfect. I’ll go along as an escort. After all, the jungle is a dangerous place.
Tarzan Kerchak, please listen to me. I know the nesting ground is secret, but I trust them. You see, I want to help them because...because... well, they need us.
Goofy Uh... Did you get that?
Donald No.
Tarzan Kerchak.
Tarzan (defeated) Kerchak...
Goofy (thinking) He seemed sorta distracted by something.
Donald (thinking) Was he looking toward the tree house?
Donald What’s the big idea?
Tarzan Wait, Kerchak. Please!
Clayton (miming nervously) You don’t understand. I was only trying to... Ah. A snake slithered by, you see. I saved that poor gorilla’s life.
Jane (angrily) How could you do such a thing!
Clayton Now, Miss Porter, as I told you, I was not aiming at the gorilla.
Jane (angrily) You are not to go near the gorillas again!
Clayton All because of one mishap? Come, now...
Clayton What am I doing with these imbeciles?
Clayton Blasted gorillas! I’ll hunt down every last one of them! I’ll track them down somehow.
Clayton I’ll stake my life on it.
Sora Heartless!
Jane Don’t mind Mr. Clayton. He’s not a bad person—just a bit impetuous.
Jane I do hope Mr. Clayton is safe...
Sora Hey, where’s Jane?
Goofy What’s wrong, Tarzan?
Tarzan Something coming. Jane, danger. Jane near... Near tree house.
Donald Sounds like trouble. Let’s go.
Jane Tarzan!
Jane Clayton came to the tent, and... That’s the last thing I remember.
Sora (surprised) Clayton?
Tarzan Gorillas trapped. Terk ran.
Jane We must help the gorillas!
Sora No!
Sora Clayton?
Tarzan Not Clayton!
Tarzan Not Clayton!
Clayton Lazy beast!
Tarzan Tarzan, home.
Sora This is your home? But that means...
Goofy Huh?
Jane The waterfalls... They’re echoing all the way here.
Tarzan Friends there. See friends.
Jane Oh, now I’ve got it. (recites Mangani word) means heart. Friends in our hearts...
Tarzan Heart...
Sora (disappointed) Oh, so that’s what it meant.
Tarzan Friends, same heart. Clayton, lose heart. No heart, no see friends. No heart, no friends.
Sora (to Donald) Sorry about what I said.
Donald I’m sorry too.
Goofy Yeah. All for one, huh?
Donald A gummi!
Goofy But it’s sure not thing king’s.
Jane I think someone has a new admirer.
Donald No, no, no, no! Daisy would kill me!
????? What drew the Heartless to that world?
?????????? The hunter lured them there. It was his lust for power that was the bait. But it seems the bait was too tasty for his own good.
????? Yeah, he got chomped instead!
????? A weak-hearted fool like him stood no chance against the Heartless. But the boy is a problem. He found one of the Keyholes.
?????????? Fear not. It will take him ages to find the rest.
?????????? Besides, he remains blissfully unaware of our other plan.
?????? Yes, the princesses...
?????????? They are falling into our hands, one by one. Speaking of which...
Sora Well, guess we’d better get going.
Jane Where is your ship, anyway?
Donald Well, uh... Not too far.
Tarzan Sora, Tarzan, friends
Sora The gummi block that came out of that glowing hole... It’s not like the others. Wonder what it’s used for.
Donald I dunno.
Goofy Maybe Leon’ll know.
Donald Hmm... He might. Back to Traverse Town, then?
Sora I wanna be pilot!
Donald Hey, stop it!
Sora Oh, come on! I’m the Keyblade master.
Donald I don’t care who you are! No!
Goofy Here we go again...
Yuffie Leon’s probably at the underground cavern. He trains there often. You know, the channel in the alleyway is connected to the cavern.
Leon So, you found the Keyhole.
Sora Yeah. The Keyblade locked it automatically.
Aerith Good.
Leon Every world among the stars has a Keyhole. And each one leads to the heart of that world. There must be one in this town as well.
Sora What do you mean?
Aerith It was in Ansem’s report.
Leon (crossing his arms) The Heartless enter through the Keyhole and do something to the world’s core.
Sora What happens to the world?
Aerith In the end, it disappears.
Sora, Donald & Goofy What!
Leon That’s why your key is so important.
Aerith Please lock the Keyholes. You’re the only one who can.
Sora I don’t know...
Leon Seeing other worlds would probably serve you well.
Donald Yeah!
Goofy We gotta find your friends! And King Mickey!
Sora I guess you’re right... Okay!
Sora Hey, Leon. This gummi block’s different from the others. Do you know what it’s for?
Aerith Ask Cid. He should know.
Leon Wait, Sora. Take this with you.
Leon This stone holds some mysterious power. I’ve been carrying it for luck. I want you to hold onto it.
Sora How do you use it?
Sora Uh, Leon?
Moogle A big tournament is being held somewhere, kupo.
Cid What’ve you got there? Hey! Well, if it ain’t a gummi block.
Donald Yup.
Goofy What’s this one for?
Cid You’re kiddin’ me! You’re flyin’ a gummi ship and you don’t know nothin’ about navigation gummis? Bunch of pinheads. Interspace ain’t no playground.
Sora There’s a lot we don’t know. So what! We have to use the gummi ship to go to other worlds. We don’t have a choice.
Cid Whoa, easy.
Cid I didn’t know. No hard feelings, all right? Well, I guess I could lend y’all a hand, then.
Sora Thanks.
Cid Basically, with navigation gummis, you can go to new places. You want one on your ship, right?
Cid I’ll install it for you. But I got this thing I gotta go deliver first.
Sora What do you need to deliver?
Cid Just this book. It’s real old. When the guy brought it in, it was practically falling apart. Too beat up to restore it to the way it was. But overall, I did a decent job puttin’ it back together. Anyway, you mind deliverin’ it for me? It’s the old house past the Third District. Look for a big fire sign.
Sora Wh-What was that?
Cid Hmm? The bell at the gizmo shop is ringing. Go check it out if you want, but deliver that book for me first. When you’re done, stop by the house in the Third District. I’ll be there.
Kairi There’s something about this musty place...
Kairi It reminds me of the secret place back home, where we used to scribble on the walls. Remember?
Sora Kairi?
Goofy Sora?
?????? Well, well.
?????? You’ve arrived sooner than I expected.
Sora Wha... You knew we were coming?
?????? Of course.
Sora Are you...a Heartless?
Donald He doesn’t look like one.
?????? Oh, my. No. My name is Merlin. As you can see, I am a sorcerer. I spend much of my time traveling. It’s good to be home. Your king has requested my help.
Goofy King Mickey?
Merlin Yes, indeed. Donald, Goofy. And who might you be, young man?
Sora I’m Sora.
Merlin Ah. So, you have found the key.
Donald What did the king ask you to do?
Merlin Just a moment...
Merlin Presto!
Merlin There, now. Ahem.
Merlin Your king asked me to train you in the art of magic. We can start anytime you like. Let me know when you’re ready to begin the training. Oh, and one more thing.
????? Hello. I’m the Fairy Godmother. Your king asked me to help, too. I will assist throughout your journey.
Merlin I do not know how much I can be of help, but do stop by anytime.
Merlin Oh, that book... So, Cid asked you to bring this. Thank you. You wish to know what kind of book it is? I don’t even know, myself. In fact, it’s not mine. Somehow it found its way into my bag one day. It was such a curious book, I asked Cid to repair it for me. Well, I guess I’ll put it here somewhere, for now. This book holds a great secret. The missing pages will unlock it.
Merlin I’ll leave the book over there. Do look at it whenever you like. My best regards to Cid for repairing it for me. Oh, and about that stone of yours... You should ask the Fairy Godmother about that.
Sora Do you know what this is?
Fairy Godmother Oh, the poor thing! He has turned into a summon gem.
Sora A summon gem?
Fairy Godmother This little creature lived in a world that was consumed by darkness. When a world vanishes, so do its inhabitants. But this one has such a strong heart, he became a gem instead of vanishing with his world.
Sora Can he regain himself?
Fairy Godmother Yes, but only his spirit. Now, watch!
Fairy Godmother Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!
Fairy Godmother Whenever you call, he will help you. If you find any more of these, bring them to me. Don’t worry, when their worlds are restored they will return there. Sora, please help save them.
Sora Don’t worry, I will.
???? Think, think. Think, think.
Sora Hi there. What’s wrong?
???? Nothing. Just thinking.
Sora Oh.
???? I was thinking of how to say goodbye to Pooh.
Sora Pooh?
Pooh (answering) Yes?
Sora (sitting beside him) Wait a second. You’re Pooh?
Pooh Yes, I’m Winnie the Pooh. Pooh for short. Who are you?
Sora I’m Sora.
Pooh Oh. Hello, Sora. Have you come to say goodbye to Pooh, too?
Sora Well, no. Why would I do that? We’ve only just met.
Pooh Because everyone’s gone away.
Sora What do you mean?
Pooh Well, we all lived here in the Hundred Acre Wood. And we’d take walks together, or play Pooh sticks... And every day, I’d eat some honey. Just one small smackeral would taste very good right now.
Pooh But now everyone’s gone. All my friends, and my favorite Hunny Tree too. Everyone must’ve gone away while I was napping, I think... So, who knows?
Pooh Maybe I shall end up going away somewhere as well. But I wonder, how do I say goodbye to myself?
Pooh Think, think, think.
Pooh Oh, my tumbly is getting rather rumbly.
Pooh Oh, bother. There’s no more honey left. If only the Hunny Tree would visit... Then I could eat my fill.
Owl Let me guess: You’d like to know what happens next. Unfortunately, some of the pages are missing, so I can’t tell you yet. The pages are scattered over many worlds. Would you find them for us?
Merlin You’d best go see Cid before going anywhere else.
Riku There you are. What’s going on?
Sora Riku!
Riku Hey, hey, cut it out.
Sora I’m not dreaming this time, right?
Riku I hope not. Took forever to find you.
Sora Riku!
Sora Wait a second, where’s Kairi?
Riku Isn’t she with you?
Riku Well, don’t worry. I’m sure she made it off the island, too.
Riku We’re finally free. Hey, she might even be looking for us now.
Riku We’ll all be together again soon. Don’t worry. Just leave everything to me. I know this—
Sora (proudly) Leave it to who?
Riku (walking closer) Sora, what did you—
Sora I’ve been looking for you and Kairi, too, with their help.
Riku Who are they?
Donald Ahem. My name is—
Sora We’ve visited so many places and worlds, looking for you.
Riku Really? Well, what do you know? I never would have guessed.
Goofy Oh, and guess what? Sora’s the Keyblade master.
Donald Who would’ve thought it?
Sora (stomping his foot) What’s that mean?
Riku So, this is called a Keyblade?
Sora Huh?
Sora Hey, give it back.
Riku Catch!
Sora Whoa!
Sora Okay, so you’re coming with us, right? We’ve got this awesome rocket. Wait ‘til you see it!
Donald (rudely) No, he can’t come!
Sora (stomping his foot again) What?
Donald Forget it!
Sora Oh, come on! He’s my friend!
Donald I don’t care!
Goofy Huh? He’s gone.
Sora Riku?
Sora Nice going. Oh, well. At least, he’s okay.
Sora And who knows? Maybe we’ll run into Kairi soon, too.
Cid You guys ever hear of Maleficent?
Cid I hear she’s in town.
Sora Who is she?
Cid A witch, man, she’s a witch!
Leon She’s the reason this town is full of Heartless. Don’t take her lightly.
Aerith She’s been using the Heartless for years.
Leon We lost our world, thanks to her.
Cid One day, a swarm of Heartless took over our world!
Leon That was nine years ago.
Cid I got out of that mess and came here with these guys.
Donald That’s awful!
Leon Our ruler was a wise man named Ansem. He dedicated his life to studying the Heartless.
Cid His report should tell us how to get rid of the Heartless.
Sora Where’s this report?
Leon We don’t know. It got scattered when our world was destroyed.
Cid I’m sure Maleficent’s got most of the pages.
Maleficent You see? It’s just as I told you. While you toiled away trying to find your dear friend, he quite simply replaced you with some new companions. Evidently, now he values them far more than he does you.
Maleficent You’re better off without that wretched boy.
Maleficent Now, think no more of him and come with me. I’ll help you find what you’re searching for...
Cid So, you delivered that book? That navigation gummi’s installed and ready to go. You find another one, you bring it to me. I threw in a warp gummi for the heck of it. Now you can jump to worlds you’ve been to before. Well, better get back to my real job. What’s my real job? You’ll see. See me at the First District.
Aerith I’ve been thinking about the bell in the Second District.
Sora That one that rang a bit ago?
Yuffie The one above the gizmo shop. There’s a legend about it, you know.
Aerith But it’s all boarded up. Nobody can get in there.
Cid Heck, go check it out. Ring it three times to see if anything happens.
Cid Hey, now that was quick! Now you know. I’m in the gummi block business. Workin’ on your gummi ship sure was great. Come again and I’ll give you a big discount.
Cid Go ahead, take it. It’s a special giveaway.
Cid Hey, got another navigation gummi there, eh? I’ll bet you want it installed.
Sora Yeah, please.
Cid Hmm... Looks like this is another one of those blocks that come in sets. You gotta find the mate to this one.
Jiminy Well, well, as I live and breathe! If it isn’t Pinocchio!
Pinocchio (looking up) Oh. Hi, Jiminy.
Jiminy What in the world are you doing down here?
Pinocchio (thinking) Um... Playing hide-and-seek.
Jiminy I just don’t believe it. And here I was, up all night, just worried sick about you. Why of all the—
Jiminy Pinocchio!
Jiminy (sternly) Pinocchio! Are you telling me the truth?
Pinocchio Yes!
Jiminy Then tell me, what is this?
Pinocchio It was a present.
Jiminy No fibbing, now! You know you’re not supposed to tell lies. A lie only grows and grows, ‘til you get caught! Plain as the nose on your face!
Pinocchio But if you want something, why wait? Why not just take it?
Jiminy Oh, my! Who told you that? You need some advice from your conscience!
Pinocchio That’s right! You’re my conscience, Jiminy! I’ll never tell lies as long as you’re around.
Jiminy You need to be good so you can become a real boy. You promised Geppetto you would be, right?
Pinocchio Oh! Do you know where Father is?
Jiminy He’s not with you?
Pinocchio Jiminy, let’s go find Father!
Jiminy Now, hold on! There are all sorts of dangers and temptations out there! I’ll go find Geppetto, so you just wait here. These fellows here will be helping me.
Sora We will?
Jiminy Well, shall we go, Sora?
Sora You could’ve asked us first...
Philoctetes I never thought you’d do it. Not bad.
Hercules Phil, you’re just as stubborn as ever. Don’t pretend you’re not happy for them!
Philoctetes Ahem! Now, kid, you’ve still got a long way to go. The next round’s startin’ soon. Next time it’ll be the real thing.
Maleficent And the Keyhole?
????? The Heartless are searching for it now. I’m certain we’ll find it soon enough. So that just leaves...
Iago Jafar! I’ve looked everywhere for Jasmine. She’s disappeared like magic!
Jafar The girl is more trouble than she’s worth.
Maleficent You said you had things under control.
Jafar Agrabah is full of holes for rats to hide in. But why worry about Princess Jasmine? With her or without her, surely this world will be ours when we find the Keyhole.
Maleficent We need all seven princesses of heart to open the final door. Any fewer is useless.
Jafar Well, if the princess is that important, we’ll find her.
Jafar Find Jasmine and bring her to me at once.
Maleficent Don’t steep yourself in darkness too long. The Heartless consume the careless.
Jafar Your concern is touching, but hardly necessary.
??????? Who’s there? Hello?
??????? I’m Jasmine. My father is the sultan of Agrabah.
Goofy Uh... So that makes you a princess.
Jasmine But he has been deposed by Jafar, who now controls the city.
Goofy Jafar?
Jasmine You haven’t heard of him? He’s the royal vizier. He’s gained evil powers and seized Agrabah. He’s desperately looking for something— something he calls the Keyhole. Jafar caught me trying to escape, but he helped me.
Sora Who helped you?
Jasmine We were hiding nearby, but he left a while ago to take care of something... Oh, I hope Aladdin’s all right.
Jafar Aladdin? Where might I find this street rat?
Jafar Jasmine, allow me to find you more suitable company, my dear princess. These little rats won’t do, you see.
Sora Jasmine, run!
Jafar Ah, the boy who holds the key.
Donald The carpet flew off toward the desert. Let’s follow it, Sora!
Goofy Gawrsh, not again!
Aladdin Genie, get rid of these guys!
Genie Wish Number One, coming right up!
Aladdin I see... Thanks, Sora.
Sora Aladdin, what’re you doing out here?
Aladdin Same old stuff. Hunting legendary treasure. Just paid a visit to the Cave of Wonders.
Aladdin I found that magic carpet, and this lamp.
Aladdin Legend has it that whoever holds the lamp can summon the—
Genie Please, kid, leave the intros to a professional. (winking) The one and only GENIE OF THE LAMP!
Genie Rub-a-dub-dub the lamp and have your dearest wishes granted.
Genie Today’s winner is...Aladdin! Congratulations!
Donald Any wish?
Genie Patience, my fine feathered friend.
Genie Any three wishes ! A one wish (one genie disappears), a two wish (two disappear), a three wish. Then I make like a banana and split!
Genie Our lucky winner made his first wish—
Genie (aside) And let me tell you, what a doozy that wish was—
Genie (echoing) So he has two left.
Genie So, master, what’ll you have for Wish Number Two?
Aladdin Hmm, how about making me a fabulously wealthy prince?
Genie Oooh! Money! Royalty! Fame!
Genie Okay, you asked for it! A hundred servants and a hundred camels loaded with gold!
Genie Just say the word and I’ll deliver it in 30 minutes or less, or your meal’s free.
Genie Hey, I’ll even throw in a cappuccino!
Aladdin (chuckling) No, thanks!
Genie Okay.
Aladdin I think I’ll put that on hold until we reach Agrabah.
Goofy Uh, why a prince?
Aladdin You see, there’s this girl in Agrabah named Jasmine. But she’s a princess, and I’m... Aww, she could never fall for a guy like me.
Donald Oh. Princess?
Goofy Jasmine?
Sora Oh, that’s right! She’s in trouble, Aladdin!
Aladdin What? Well, c’mon, let’s get going!
Genie Ah, fresh air! The great outdoors!
Sora I guess you don’t get out much, huh?
Genie Comes with the job. Phenomenal cosmic powers. Itty-bitty living space. It’s always three wishes, then back to my portable prison. I’m lucky to see the light of day every century or two...
Aladdin Say, Genie, what if I use my last wish to free you from the lamp? What do you think?
Genie (smiling) You’d do that?
Aladdin Genie, it’s a promise. After we help Jasmine.
Aladdin So, Jafar is after Jasmine and this Keyhole.
Genie Keyhole, eh? I could swear I’ve heard about that somewhere before...
Donald Really? Where?
Genie Now, where was it? It’s only been 200 years...
Sora Well, anyway, we’ve got to stop Jafar before it’s too late.
Jafar Setting your sights a little high, aren’t you boy? Back to your hole, street rat. I will not allow you to trouble the princess any more.
Aladdin (shouting) Jasmine!
Jasmine I’m so sorry, Aladdin.
Aladdin (rubbing the lamp) Genie, help Jasmine, please!
Genie (cheerfully) One wish left! You’re making this really easy, you know.
Jafar (smirking) So sorry, boy. I’m afraid your second wish has been denied.
Genie I’m sorry, Al.
Jafar And now, I bid you all farewell. Attack!
Sora Courage!
Aladdin Jasmine!
Aladdin To the desert! Come on, let’s move!
Jafar My first wish, Genie! Show me the Keyhole!
Maleficent That boy again?
Jafar He’s more persistent than I expected. Why not explain the situation to that boy Riku? Doing so may actually prove useful to our--
Sora Wait a second. Are you Maleficent?
Aladdin Jafar, let Jasmine go!
Jafar Not a chance.
Jafar You see, she’s a princess—one of seven who somehow hold the key to opening the door.
Goofy Open...
Donald ...the door?
Jafar But you fools won’t live to see what lies beyond it. Genie! My second wish. Crush them!
Aladdin Genie, no!
Genie Sorry, Al. The one with the lamp calls the shots. I don’t have a choice.
Genie I’m really sorry about this. Run!
Jafar Genie!
Jafar My final wish! I want you to make me and all-powerful genie!
Aladdin The lamp! Get Jafar’s lamp!
Jafar Iago! Keep the lamp away from them!
Iago Yeah, yeah, I hear you!
Iago Nag, nag! It’s all he ever does!
Iago Ugh! Is it hot in here, or is it just me?
Iago Water! Water!
Jafar Keep moving!
Iago I don’t need your help, all right!
Sora Okay, Jafar! Back to your lamp!
Aladdin Jasmine? Jasmine!
Goofy Whoa, we’d better get out of here!
Aladdin Jasmine!
Aladdin So, Jasmine’s no longer in Agrabah. Sora, let’s go find her.
Sora (sadly) Sorry. I can’t take you with me.
Aladdin Wh-Why not?
Goofy I sure wish we could...
Donald But we can’t. If we take him to another world, we would be...
Goofy Muh... Mudd—
Donald Meddling!
Sora Aladdin, we’ll find Jasmine. I promise.
Genie (patting Aladdin’s back) Uh, earth to Al. Hello? You still have one wish left. Look, just say the word. Ask me to find Jasmine for you.
Aladdin I...I wish...
Aladdin For your freedom, Genie.
Genie (surprised) Al!
Aladdin A deal’s a deal, Genie. Now you can go anywhere you want. You’re your own master. But if you can, it’d be great if you could go along with them and help Sora find Jasmine.
Genie Sorry, Al. I’m done taking orders from others. But... A favor, now that’s entirely different.
Genie I guess I could give that a try.
Genie After all, we’re pals, right, Al?
Aladdin Genie...
Genie (smiling) Just leave it to me!
Hades That smarmy vizier could’ve had ‘em—if someone had stuck around to give him a hand.
Riku Hey, I did my part. I brought the princess, didn’t I?
Maleficent Jafar was beyond help, consumed by his own hatred. One should beware of letting it burn too fiercely.
Hades Whoa, whoa, whoa. Lighten up. I’m as cool as they come, okay? By the way, kid, have we got something special for you.
Riku Huh?
Maleficent We had a deal, yes? You help us, and we grant you your wish...
Riku Kairi!
Maleficent Go to her. Your vessel is waiting.
???? Just remember, this is no pleasure cruise. It won’t be a pleasant voyage.
Riku (to Maleficent) Why are you doing all this for me? What’s the catch?
Maleficent (turning to face him) Catch? What’s the catch?
Maleficent Silly, boy. You’re like a son to me. I only want you to be happy.
Riku I seriously doubt that.
Maleficent Believe what you wish. But lest we forget, I kept my end of the bargain.
Aladdin Here. Take this with you.
Aladdin Sora, please find Jasmine for me.
Sora Could this torn page be from Merlin’s book?
Goofy Let’s return to town and give it to him.
?????? Hello, i-is anyone there?
?????? Wh-Wh-What am I to do? I’m all alone. (calling) Pooh? Pooh? Where are you? It’s me, Piglet.
Piglet Oh dear! I was j-just... N-Never mind. I’m sorry!
Sora Don’t be scared. You’re looking for Pooh, right?
Piglet You know Pooh?
Piglet Oh, y-you see, I-I have something for him. I have to take it to Pooh right away!
Piglet (calling) Oh, Pooh!
Pooh Oh, I believe I smell a delicious something—a something like honey!
Piglet Pooh!
Pooh Hello, Piglet. How have you been?
Piglet Oh, I-I’m so glad to see you. I thought you’d gone away. I brought wh-what you asked for.
Pooh Thank you, Piglet. Now I can finally have some honey.
Piglet Really? B-But how?
Pooh I shall hold on to the balloon, and fly like a bee up the Hunny Tree, see.
Piglet But if you take their honey, won’t the bees be angry?
Pooh Hmm...
Pooh Oh!
Pooh If you could only chase away those bees, I’m quite certain I could get a small morsel of honey. Would you help me get some honey?
Sora Sure!
Pooh Oh. Hello there, Owl.
Owl Good day, Pooh. What are you doing? Using a balloon to get some honey? Splendid idea! Allow me to offer a few pointers.
Owl Ahem! Now, Pooh can get honey by floating up this tree with his balloon. The honey is inside the tree hollows, not the beehives you see here.
Owl There’s quite a lot of honey in these holes. If Pooh gets too close, the bees will come out to protect their honey. If they get to Pooh, they’ll pop his balloon. Lock onto the bees and swat them away. The more time Pooh has at each hollow, the more honey he can eat. There’s more honey higher up, too. If jumping from branch to branch proves difficult, try the Rush command. Rush can help you catch up to Pooh quickly. But it isn’t fully reliable. Good luck.
Pooh (giggling) It is rather funny what I will do for honey.
Fairy Godmother Oh, another summon gem? Let’s help this little one. Here we go! Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!
Fairy Godmother If you find any more of these stones, bring them to me.
Donald What is that?
Sora Wow, it’s huge!
Goofy It’s a giant whale!
Jiminy It’s Monstro! He’s a whale of a whale, and vicious besides!
Donald Whoa! Sora, get us out of here!
Sora Too late! He’s going to swallow us!
Sora It’s true! I saw it with my own eyes!
Riku You sure you didn’t just hear it this time?
Sora What difference does it make? There’s a huge monster in there, I tell you!
Riku All right. Suppose there really is a monster... Think we can beat it by ourselves, Sora?
Sora No problem. Let’s do it!
Sora Listen! There! Can you hear it growling?
Riku Shh, quiet.
Riku We’ve gotta be careful.
Riku See that? It was just the wind making that noise.
Sora Aw, man. I wish it was a monster! Hold on! What’s that over there?
Riku A window, or maybe a door? It won’t open.
Sora (looking around at the empty walls) Geez, is that really all that’s in here?
Riku What do you expect in a boring place like this?
Riku Hey, Sora.
Sora (looking back at him) Hm?
Riku When we grow up, let’s get off this island. We’ll go on real adventures, not this kid stuff!
Sora Sure. But isn’t there anything fun to do now? Hey, you know the new girl at the mayor’s house? Did you hear?
Donald Knock it off!
Goofy Hey, Sora. Are you okay?
Sora What are you guys doing? Where are we, anyway?
Sora Whoa!
Goofy Uh, ya know, I think that big ol’ whale Monstro just swallowed us. And for today’s weather: expect showers.
Goofy Heavy showers!
Donald Hey! Who’s there?
Pinocchio It’s me.
Donald Oh, it’s just Pinocchio. ...Pinocchio!?
Jiminy Pinocchio?
Jiminy Pinocch, where are you going? Pinocch! Come on, everybody! After him! Quick!
???????? What have you got there, Pinocchio?
Pinocchio With this, we can get out of her, Father.
???????? Really? With this big block? You think so?
Sora It’s true.
Sora So, how did you end up here, Pinocchio?
???????? Oh, my. So the whale swallowed all of you, too? My goodness.
Sora Yeah, looks like it.
???????? My name is Geppetto. I’m Pinocchio’s father. When we got separated, I traveled all over, looking for him.
Geppetto Thank goodness we’re together again.
Geppetto So, you seem to know Pinocchio quite well. I hope he was a good boy in my absence.
Geppetto Well, we’ve all had quite a journey. Right, Pinocchio?
Geppetto Pinocchio? I warned him not to wander off here. He can be a naughty boy. Even so, he’s very precious to me.
Sora What are you doing? Come on, let’s go back.
Goofy You know, Geppetto’s awfully worried about you.
Sora (sternly) Pinocchio, stop fooling around! This is no time for games!
Riku But, Sora, I thought you liked games.
Riku Or are you too cool to play them now that you have the Keyblade?
Sora Riku! Wh-What are you doing here?
Riku Just playing with Pinocchio.
Sora You know what I mean! What about Kairi? Did you find her?
Riku Maybe. Catch us and maybe I’ll tell you what I know.
Sora Come on!
Maleficent Why do you still care about that boy? He has all but deserted you for the Keyblade and his new companions, after all.
Riku I don’t care about him. I was just messing with him a little.
Maleficent Oh, really? Of course you were.
Maleficent Beware the darkness in your heart. The Heartless prey upon it.
Riku Mind your own business.
Sora Riku! What’s the matter with you? What are you thinking? Don’t you realize what you’re doing?
Riku I was about to ask you the same thing, Sora. You only seem interested in running around and showing off that Keyblade these days. Do you even want to save Kairi?
Sora I do.
Riku You up for this?
Sora No problem. Let’s do it!
Pinocchio Get me out of here!
Pinocchio Help! It’s scary in here!
Geppetto Pinocchio! Pinocchio! Please! Give me back my son!
Riku Sorry, old man. I have some unfinished business with this puppet.
Geppetto He’s no puppet! Pinocchio is my little boy!
Riku He is unusual. Not many puppets have hearts. I’m not sure, but maybe he can help someone who’s lost theirs.
Sora Wait a minute. Are you talking about Kairi?
Riku What do you care about her?
Sora Hey, let Pinocchio go, Riku.
Riku A puppet that’s lost its heart to the Heartless... Maybe it holds the key to helping Kairi. How about it, Sora? Let’s join forces to save her. We can do it, together.
Riku (stopping) What? You’d rather fight me? Over a puppet that has no heart?
Sora Heart or no heart, at least he still has a conscience.
Riku Conscience?
Sora You might not hear it, but right now it’s loud and clear. And it’s telling me you’re on the wrong side!
Riku Then you leave me no choice.
Jiminy Pinocchio! Pinocchio!
Pinocchio (weakly) Jiminy... I’m not gonna make it.
Pinocchio Oh! I guess I’m okay!
Donald Run!
Sora Riku! Riku, where are you?
Riku So, Kairi’s like a lifeless puppet now?
Maleficent Precisely.
Riku And her heart was...
Maleficent Taken by the Heartless, no doubt.
Riku Tell me! What can I do?
Maleficent There are seven maidens of the purest heart. We call them the princesses of heart. Gather them together, and a door will open to the heart of all worlds. Within lies untold wisdom. There, you will surely find a way to recover Kairi’s heart. Now, I’ll grant you a marvelous gift.
Maleficent The power to control the Heartless.
Riku Soon, Kairi. Soon.
Goofy I sure hope Pinocchio and Geppetto are okay.
Donald Yeah, hopefully they landed safely somewhere.
Sora Riku...
Fairy Godmother Oh, another summon gem? Let’s help this little one. Here we go! Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!
Fairy Godmother If you find any more of these stones, bring them to me.
?????? Nobody’s home! And I’m out of honey!
Piglet Look, Rabbt’s house c-came back! But it looks like Rabbit isn’t home. Pooh’s been calling and calling, but the house says no one’s there.
Pooh (calling) Nobody’s home?
?????? That’s right, Nobody!
Pooh Who is this person named Nobody?
Pooh Nobody, have you seen Rabbit?
?????? No! No Rabbit here! There’s no one here!
Pooh Hello, Rabbit!
Rabbit Why, P-Pooh. What a pleasant surprise... Nice to see you, too, Piglet. And...
Rabbit Is this a new friend? P-Pooh, I’m sorry, but... I’m all out of honey at the moment.
Pooh Sora, do you smell honey?
Rabbit H-Honey? Now, how did that get up there? Would you like some Pooh? Don’t feel you have to, of course.
Pooh Oh, thank you, Rabbit. I would like just a small smackeral. I’m quite hungry.
Rabbit Um, Pooh Bear...
Rabbit You’re not eating the whole pot, are you?
Rabbit Once you start, there’s no stopping you, is there...
Rabbit (defeated) Ohh... Out of honey again.
Piglet H-Help! Please help Pooh!
Pooh Oh, help and bother. I’m stuck again. I came in through this hole, so it must have shrunk.
Piglet Oh, wh-what to do?
Rabbit All this because he can’t stop liking honey so much!
Pooh Oh, how will I eat honey if I’m stuck here? When it’s lunch time, perhaps you could bring me a honey jar.
Rabbit No honey ‘til you’re unstuck!
Rabbit If Pooh doesn’t slim down, my house will stay plugged up forever! If only there were something we could do...
Rabbit Wait, I know! A bit of carrot top juice will do the trick! I have a carrot patch on the other side of the stream. Carrot top juice is just the ticket to slimming down a Pooh!
Rabbit Oh, no!
?????? Hey, there! Name’s Tigger! T-I-double-guh-RR. That spells Tigger!
Tigger Well, now! I don’t think I’ve ever seen you before!
Pooh Hello, Tigger. You’ve just bounced my new friend Sora.
Tigger Hey, Pooh! Say, you’re lookin’ mighty uncomfy today. Is that some new exercise? Why, bouncin’ around is a lot more fun.
Sora Wh-Why do you bounce around so much, Tigger?
Tigger Why? ‘Cause bouncin’ is what Tiggers do best!
Tigger Speaking of which, my bouncin’ spot has gone and disappeared! So for now, this’ll be my new bouncin’ ground.
Rabbit Tigger’s bouncing will ruin my vegetables! And if we don’t give Pooh some carrot top juice, he’ll be stuck forever.
Rabbit Please help me! Keep Tigger away from my carrots!
Owl This is quite a fix. But I have just the solution. Pay attention, now.
Owl Sora, you’ll have to protect this carrot patch. If Tigger bounces on a carrot twice, it’ll be buried.
Owl Once...
Owl Twice!
Owl Just like that. Protect the carrots from Tigger’s bounces and you’ll receive points. How you ask? It’s elementary!
Owl Simply get to the carrots before Tigger lands on them. There are fifteen carrots here. Your score depends on how many you save, and how many times you block Tigger. Oh, and one more thing.
Owl The Rush command is the key to a high score. Select Rush while near a carrot that isn’t buried yet. You’ll dash to the target area before Tigger lands. Well, good luck!
Tigger How about those bounceroonies? They were good even for a Tigger.
Rabbit Thank you so much. Now I’d better make that carrot top juice. I’ll get the carrots, so please wait inside the house.
Rabbit Oh, what a day! I gave Pooh the carrot top juice. All we have to do now is push him out. Just a little push should do.
Rabbit First my vegetable patch and now this...
Pooh Oh, bother. Where am I? It’s ever so dark in here. Well, it isn’t so bad, I suppose. There is plenty of honey.
Hercules That was great! Looks like Phil’s trained another great hero!
Sora Is strength the most important part of a hero?
Philoctetes Well, what you really need is a strong heart. What makes a strong heart? If you have to ask, you’re not a hero yet!
Sora Stop talking in riddles!
Philoctetes It’s not a riddle!
Donald Okay, guys. Prepare for landing.
Sora Land where? In the sea? We’ll drown!
Donald Not with my magic, we won’t. Just leave it to me.
????? Come on, Sebastian!
Sebastian Ariel, wait! Slow down! Don’t leave me behind!
Ariel Relax, Sebastian. They don’t look like one of them. Right, Flounder?
Flounder I don’t know. There’s something weird about them.
Sora What do you mean?
Ariel They do seem... a little different. Where are you from?
Sora (nervous) We’re from kind of far away. And we’re not really used to these waters.
Ariel Oh, I see. In that case... Sebastian can show you how we swim around here.
Sebastian Ariel, King Triton will not like this!
Ariel Oh, don’t worry.
Sebstian Easy for you to say... Okay, it’s time you learn how to swim properly. Practice swimming with Flounder. Try to tag him. All right. Begin.
Sebastian Good job. Now let’s move onto self-defense.
Ariel Sebastian!
Sebastian Class is over. Good luck!
Ariel Those creatures chased us here.
Sebastian Oh, no! Those monsters might be heading for the palace, too!
Ariel We’d better head back right away!
Flounder But, wh-what if we run into more on our way back?
Ariel I’m sorry, but we need your help. Please come to the palace with us. The trident markers on the walls point the way there. We won’t get lost as long as we follow them. Okay, let’s get going.
Triton That was too close. As long as I have my trident, I will not tolerate those creatures inside this palace.
Ariel Daddy!
Triton Oh, Ariel! When will you listen? It’s dangerous out there!
Triton Strange creatures lurk outside.
Sebastian (clearing his throat) Behold. You swim before the ruler of the seas: His Majesty, King Triton.
Triton And who are they?
Ariel They helped us fight off those creatures.
Triton (warily) They don’t look familiar.
Sora We’re from an ocean very far away.
Goofy (swimming around) Yup. We came to find the Keyhole.
Triton (stunned) The what?
Ariel What’s that?
Goofy A-hyuck! Well, it’s a—
Triton (angrily) There’s no such thing! Certainly not here!
Ariel But, Daddy...
Triton Ariel, not another word! You are not to leave the palace. Is that clear?
Triton Perhaps I’m being too strict... I’m just concerned for her safety.
Sebastian Of course, Your Majesty. But I must admit, now I’m quite curious about this Keyhole.
Triton That need not concern you, Sebastian. Have you anything to report?
Sebastian Just as you suspected, Your Majesty, they seem to be coming from Ursula’s grotto.
Triton I knew it. That sea witch is up to no good again.
Triton I see exile from the palace has taught her nothing.
Sebastian Yes, she poses serious danger.
Triton (sternly) And I told you to keep Ariel away from such danger, did I not?
Sebastian (nervously) Your Majesty, please, I, uh...
Ariel Come to my grotto. I want to show you something.
Ariel There it is. See?
Ariel Look at all the wonderful things Flounder and I’ve collected. I think it’s all from the outside world.
Ariel Someday, I’m going to see what’s out there. I want to see other worlds. Does that sound strange?
Sora No. Not at all. I used to feel the same way.
Ariel Used to?
Sora I mean...I still do.
Ariel Hey, why don’t we try looking for that Keyhole you were talking about?
Sora But your father said—
Ariel Oh, he treats me like a little girl. He never wants to let me do anything. He just... He just doesn’t understand.
Flounder There’s this really big fish who can swim against the current. But he’s scared of those weird things swimming around. So if we chase them away, I think the big fish’ll play with us. Maybe if you grab onto him, he’ll take you somewhere.
Ursula Those impudent fools will never find the Keyhole.
Ursula But the girl could prove useful. And I’ve got the Heartless on my side.
Ursula Triton, my old friend... Your day is coming.
Ariel Hm. Its shape reminds me of something...
Triton Ariel, you’ve disobeyed me again!
Triton I told you not to leave the palace!
Ariel Daddy, no!
Ariel (sadly) How could you...
Triton Young man, you’re not from another ocean. You’re from another world. Aren’t you?
Sora (surprised) Huh?
Triton Then you must be the key bearer.
Sora How did you know?
Triton You may fool Ariel, but you can’t fool me. You don’t know your dorsal fin from your tail.
Sora Aw...
Triton As the key bearer, you must already know... One must not meddle in the affairs of other worlds.
Sora Of course I know that, but...
Triton You have violated this principle. The key bearer shatters peace and brings ruin.
Goofy Aw, Sora’s not like that.
Triton I thank you for saving my daughter. But there is no room in my ocean for you or your key.
Flotsam My, my, the poor child suffers such deep sorrow.
Jetsam What a pity. If only there were something we could do...
Flotsam Wait. Maybe she can be of some help.
Jetsam Yes. Maybe she can be of some help to you.
Ariel Who’re you talking about?
Flotsam Oh, she would surely help you.
Jetsam She’d make all your dreams come true.
Flotsam & Jetsam Ursula can help...
Ursula You called, my dear?
Ariel (daunted) You’re Ursula? I was just wondering if—
Ursula It’s all right. Helping others is what I live for. Let me guess. You wish to see other worlds. That shouldn’t be too hard. After all, your new friends came from another world.
Ariel What?
Ursula But they had special help—that mysterious key.
Ursula Now, now. Cheer up, sweetie. You have something special, too.
Ursula Now listen carefully. I think the Keyhole they seek is somewhere in the palace.
Ursula Now, my dear, if you can take me there without your daddy knowing...
Ursula I can help you get to these other worlds you long for.
Ursula The trident is mine at last! And I couldn’t have done it without your help, my dear.
Ariel Ursula, no! I didn’t want this!
Ursula Why not? Aren’t you tired of following your dear daddy’s orders?
Ursula Oh, yes. We had a deal, didn’t we? Time for a little journey—to the dark world of the Heartless!
Flotsam We cannot find the Keyhole.
Jetsam The Keyhole is not here.
Ursula What?
Ursula Why, we have company. I’m afraid you’re a little late, handsome!
Ariel Daddy!
Triton (feebly) The trident... We must get it back.
Sora Come on, let’s go!
Ariel Wait, I’m going with you! My father is hurt and it’s all my fault. I have to stop Ursula!
Sebastian That’s right. I’m right behind you, Ariel.
Triton Ursula draws power from her cauldron. To defeat Ursula, you must strike her cauldron with magic.
Sora What is that thing?
Sebastian Need some help? I’ll show you how it’s done.
Donald Come out! You can’t run!
Sebastian Your time has come!
Ursula Sea and wind, hear my command!
Ursula Get up and fight!
Ursula No... Impossible!
Ursula You’ll pay for this!
Ariel Let’s go. We must get the trident back.
Ursula You pathetic fools! I rule the seas now!
Ursula The sea and all its spoils bow to my power!
Ursula Hey, you. Not so fast! Get ready for this!
Ursula Hmph... Slippery little morsel.
Ursula You dare to strike me!
Ursula This won’t be pretty!
Ariel Daddy, I’m so sorry.
Sora Please don’t be angry with her.
Triton It’s my fault. You followed Ursula because... I wouldn’t let you follow your heart. And when you found that crystal, I lost my temper and destroyed it.
Goofy Oh, yeah, the crystal! Why did you destroy it?
Triton The crystal held the power to reveal the Keyhole. The Keyhole is dangerous. I had to keep you away from it at any cost.
Ariel Daddy...
Triton Key bearer, I have one more request: Seal the Keyhole. My trident also holds the power to reveal the Keyhole. Will you do it?
Sora Of course. That’s what we had in mind from the start.
Ariel Where is the Keyhole, Daddy?
Triton You should know better than anyone. It’s in your grotto.
Goofy Really... Sora, let’s go.
Ariel Tell me, Sora. Your world, what’s it like?
Sora Oh, about that... Sorry for lying to you.
Ariel (smiling) It’s okay. Besides, if you can travel to other worlds, maybe I can, too.
Ariel So many places I want to see... I know I’ll get there someday. I’ll find a way somehow. I’m sure of it.
Sebastian (sighing) Well, if you find it, do me a favor and leave me out of it.
Ariel This is from my collection. I want you to have it.
Sora I think my magic is as good as Donald’s now.
Donald No way! Not in a million years.
Goofy Why don’t you go see Merlin? Work more on your magic.
Merlin You’re making excellent progress. Here’s something for your effort.
Merlin Keep it up.
Piglet Look, Pooh. Something is floating this way.
Pooh I think you’re right, Piglet. What could it be?
Pooh (waving) Why, it looks like Eeyore! Hello, Eeyore, if it is you.
Eeyore Hello, Pooh. Yes, it’s me. Could you pull me out? That is, if it’s not too much trouble. Of course, you don’t have to if you don’t want to.
Eeyore Thank you, Pooh. Thank you, other you. You know, floating along out there, it seemed like something was missing...
Eeyore And something’s still missing.
Piglet Why, Eeyore’s tail is gone! Is that what’s missing?
Eeyore Let’s see... Yep, lost it again. Wonder where it went this time. It’s not much of a tail, though I’m sort of attached to it. But I don’t know why anybody’d look for it. Probably won’t find it anyway...
Pooh Sora, why don’t we all look for Eeyore’s tail?
Owl Lost something?
Owl Searching from a high place is the quickest way to find it!
Sora Owl, can you fly up high and help us find Eeyore’s tail?
Owl Sorry, but my eyes aren’t what they used to be. Too much reading, you know. But I can offer good advice! Of course, you don’t have to if you don’t want to. See that swing up there? Take Pooh there.
Owl You’re a bit too big for the swing, but Pooh should fit nicely. I’ll tell you more when you get there.
Owl Here’s what to do. First, get ready to push.
Sora How?
Owl Like this.
Sora Like this?
Sora How’s this?
Owl Not bad, not bad! Here’s the next step. If you time it right, Pooh will swing higher and higher. Try it! Push too soon, Pooh won’t go any higher. Push too late, he’ll go too high.
Eeyore Hm? That looks familiar...
Pooh How’s it looking?
Sora There we go.
Eeyore It’s not much of a tail, but it’s mine. Thanks, everyone.
Pooh I wish we could put the Hundred Acre Wood back the way it was, too!
Pooh (shivering) Brrr! I think I spend too much time on the swing.
Pooh Thank you, Sora. This is nice and warm. You’ve helped us so much. This is just something to say thank you.
Goofy This sure is a spooky place. I’ll bet the people here are scary- lookin’ too.
Donald Don’t worry. We look spooky, too. If they scare us, we’ll scare them right back!
Goofy You think so?
????? And now, allow me to introduce...
Mayor The master of terror... the king of nightmares—Jack Skellington!
Mayor Bravo, Jack! Bravo! Those ghosts will be a big hit at this year’s Halloween!
Jack Thank you, thank you! But their movement still needs work. It’s not scary enough.
Jack I want to strike bone-chilling terror.
Jack I’m going to consult the doctor.
Mayor Then I’ll go attend to the decorations.
Jack I don’t understand. Maybe the guidance system was damaged in the explosion.
Finkelstein Nonsense. My devices are always perfect!
Jack Oh, I’ve got it! Why, of course! The Heartless need a heart! Doctor, do you think we can add a heart to that device?
Finkelstein Certainly. A heart’s not all that complicated.
Finkelstein Let’s get to work.
Jack (reading) To make a heart, first take a container with a lock...
Finkelstein We need the key to this thing first!
Donald You’re really gonna unlock it for them?
Sora Why not? If they succeed, we won’t have to fight the Heartless, right? Besides, I want to see the Heartless dance, too. Don’t you?
Donald Not really.
Jack My! That was amazing! Uh, and you are...
Sora Sora.
Jack Well done, Sora! I’d like you to be a part of this year’s Halloween.
Sora (pointing) What’s this Heartless doing here?
Jack Oh, the Heartless came to town just recently. What’s frustrating is I can’t get them to dance with me. So the doctor and I are trying to improve the guidance system. He’s quite a genius! Okay, Doctor, let’s continue. The ingredients for a heart: Pulse.
Jack Emotion.
Finkelstein Terror.
Jack Fear.
Jack Hope and despair.
Jack Mix them all together, and we have a heart!
Finkelstein It failed!
Finkelstein Maybe we’re missing some ingredients. Let’s try adding memory.
Finkelstein (calling) Sally! Sally! Good-for-nothing girl! Don’t know why I bothered creating her!
Finkelstein Sally’s got the memory we need. See if you can track her down.
Jack (patting his chest) No problem. Sora, would you like to come along?
Sora Sure.
Mayor (yelling into his megaphone) Jack! Jack! We have a major crisis! The Heartless are completely out of control! We can’t stop them!
Jack Hmm... Maybe our experiment triggered something. Everything will be fine, Mayor. You have nothing to worry about.
Sora Let’s check this place, too, once the Heartless here are out of our way.
Jack Zero! Have you seen Sally anywhere?
Sally Is something wrong, Jack?
Jack (excitedly) No, everything’s going great. We’re going to have the best Halloween ever. All we need now is your memory.
Sally Memory? You mean this?
Sally Jack, I have a bad feeling about this. Why don’t you try something else? There’s still time.
Jack Nothing could beat what I’ve got planned!
Jack Once we give the Heartless a heart, they’ll dance just as I envision it.
Jack Trust me. You’re going to love it!
Sally I have a bad feeling about this. If only Jack would reconsider... I’m happy if he’s happy, but I’m just so worried about him. I’m worried about him because I...well, I just am. Jack, why not have these kids star in the festival instead? They both look rather frightful. And funny, too. They’d be better than the Heartless.
Lock Lock!
Shock Shock!
Barrel Barrel!
Barrel Did you hear that?
Lock Yeah, I sure did! A heart! What should we do?
Shock Gosh, you really are stupid! Isn’t it obvious?
Barrel Tell Oogie Boogie.
Finkelstein Yes. This is it. Now, just one more ingredient. We need surprise to complete the heart. The mayor should know where it is.
Oogie Boogie A heart? That bonehead Jack is really making a heart? I’ll be jiggered! That works for me!
Oogie Boogie Ohh, when I get my hands on that...
Oogie Boogie Well, I’ve got no hands, but I’m still gonna nab that heart and control the Heartless.
Mayor Ghost rise from those tombstones. Check the tombstones in the order the ghosts appear. If you get it wrong, you’re in for a surprise!
Mayor Splendid! Now go look at the pumpkin.
Finkelstein Yes. This is it.
Finkelstein There you go. This time it’s sure to work.
Barrel Ya!
Finkelstein The nerve of those little hooligans, stealing my work!
Sora We lost them!
Jack Zero, after them, quick!
Jack I knew Oogie Boogie was behind this!
Shock We were just following orders! Oogie Boogie told us to steal the heart. It’s all Barrels fault! It was his idea to tell Oogie Boogie about the heart.
Lock Yeah, that’s right!
Barrel B-But you guys said—
Shock You should be ashamed!
Lock Oogie Boogie made us do it. We had no choice.
Barrel Oogie Boogie told us not to give away his hiding place. Oh, and we’re not supposed to talk about the lever, either.
Barrel What’s he going to do with the heart? Beats me. I’d stay away from Oogie Boogie if I were you.
Shock Hey, I was just following Oogie Boogie’s orders! We don’t have the heart! Oogie Boogie has it!
Lock There’s no way I’m gonna take you to him! If I did that, Oogie Boogie would eat us too.
Shock You’ll never find the green door!
Jack Oogie Boogie, give me back the heart!
Oogie Boogie You want it? Well, then come on over and get it!
Oogie Boogie Now, let’s see if I can get their attention. (calling) Oh, Heartless!
Oogie Boogie This is it?
Oogie Boogie (yelling) Nobody disrespects me! Nobody!
Oogie Boogie C’mon, baby!
Oogie Boogie Buzzsaw!
Oogie Boogie Bone Soldiers!
Jack So, that heart was a failure after all.
Jack Huh?
Sora Whoa! How did he get so big?
Jack Look! It’s brimming with the power of darkness! Oogie Boogie is drawing power from those dark globs!
Sora So we just have to destroy those things, right?
Jack Sally, why didn’t I listen to you?
Sally Don’t feel bad, Jack. We’ll come up with another plan for Halloween. Next time, we’ll do it together.
Jack I guess we have no choice. We’ll have to cancel the Heartless Halloween festival for now. Here, I want you to have this.
Jack Visit us any time, Sora. Next year’s Halloween will be the scariest ever!
Finkelstein Emotion, memory... We put in all the necessary ingredients. What else do you need to make a heart? What is a heart, anyway? I can’t figure it out.
Goofy Uh, a big ship is catching up to us.
Donald Quit gawking! That’s a pirate ship!
Sora It’s going to ram us! Hold tight!
Riku I didn’t think you’d come, Sora.
Riku Good to see you again.
Sora Where are Donald and Goofy?
Riku Are they that important to you? More important than old friends? Instead of worrying about them, you should be asking...
Riku ...about her.
Sora Kairi!
Riku That’s right. While you were off goofing around, I finally found her. (Sora starts to run towards them, when a hook blocks his path)
???? Not so fast. No shenanigans aboard my vessel, boy.
Sora Riku, why are you siding with the Heartless?
Riku The Heartless obey me now, Sora. Now I have nothing to fear.
Sora You’re stupid. Sooner or later they’ll swallow your heart.
Riku Not a chance. My heart’s too strong.
Sora Riku...
Riku I’ve picked up a few other tricks as well. Like this, for instance.
Riku You can go see your friends now.
Riku (to the captain) Let’s get under way, already. And keep Sora away from Kairi until we’re ready to land.
???? (to his First Mate) That scurvy brat thinks he can order me around!
???? What shall we do, Captain Hook?
Hook (frustrated) Nothing! The hold is crawling with Heartless.
Captain Hook Let them keep an eye on the brats.
???? But, Captain, you-know-who is also down—
Captain Hook Shh... Did you hear that, Smee? Oh, that dreadful sound!
Smee No, Captain.
Hook (shaking Smee) Are you quite sure? Did I imagine it? Oh, my poor nerves...
Goofy You don’t say?
Sora Yeah, it was definitely Kairi. I’ve finally found her.
Goofy All right! A-hyuck! Then let’s go up and talk to her.
Sora Yeah!
Donald Sounds great. Okay, but first...how about getting off!
Sora Oh, sorry.
????? Ahem!
????? How ya doin’ there? Looking for a way out?
Goofy Who are you?
????? (smiling) I’m the answer to your prayers.
????? Okay, then. Fine. Have it your way.
Sora But you’re stuck in here too, aren’t you?
????? (crossing his arms) No. I’m just waiting for someone.
Sora Who?
????? Tinker Bell, what took you so long?
????? Great job. So you found Wendy?
????? Hold on. There was another girl there, too?
????? Are you crazy? There’s no way I’m gonna leave Wendy there!
Donald Aha. She must be pretty jealous.
????? Come on, Tink! Open up the door!
Sora Ahem!
????? I’m Peter Pan.
Sora I’m Sora.
Peter Pan Okay, we’re in this together, but only ‘til we find Wendy.
Goofy So, uh, how come you can fly?
Peter Pan Anyone can fly. You wanna try?
Peter Pan Aw, haven’t you cooled off yet, Tink?
Peter Pan Just a little bit of pixie dust. There. Now you can fly.
Captain Hook What? So Wendy’s not one of the chosen ones?
Riku There are seven, supposedly, and Maleficent says she’s not one of them.
Riku Hoist anchor as soon as possible. Leave all the dead weight behind, including her.
Captain Hook After the trouble of capturing her? And why those seven? What is Maleficent planning, anyway?
Riku Who knows? As long as it means getting Kairi’s heart back, I couldn’t care less.
Captain Hook You’re wasting your time! The Heartless has devoured that girl’s heart. I’ll stake me other hand it’s lost forever.
Riku I will find it no matter what.
Smee Uh, Captain...
Captain Hook What?
Smee The prisoners have escaped. What’s more, Peter Pan is with them.
Hook (annoyed) Blast that Peter Pan! All right, then! Bring the hostage to me cabin, Smee! Hop to it!
Peter Pan What is it, Tink?
????? Peter? Peter Pan?
Peter Pan Wendy!
Wendy Please hurry! The pirates are coming!
Peter Pan What! I’ll be right up there! Just hold on!
Sora Wendy?
Wendy Yes?
Sora Is there another girl in there with you?
Wendy Oh, why, yes. But she seems to be asleep. She hasn’t budged an inch.
Sora Kairi? Kairi!
Peter Pan Wendy! Hey, let’s get up there!
Peter Pan (calling) Wendy, are you in there?
Sora Riku, wait!
Peter Pan Wendy!
Peter Pan Come on, Tink! Not now!
Peter Pan Well, this is as far as I can go. I’ve gotta help Wendy.
Captain Hook Quite a codfish, that Riku—running off with that girl without even saying goodbye.
Sora Run off where? Tell me, where did he go?
Captain Hook To the ruins of Hollow Bastion, where Maleficent resides. But you won’t be going there.
Captain Hook Unless you intend to leave your little pixie friend behind?
Captain Hook Hand over the Keyblade and I’ll spare your lives. Be glad I’m merciful, unlike the Heartless. So, which will it be? The Keyblade, or the plank?
Captain Hook (terrified) It’s him! The crocodile that took me hand! Oh, Smee! He’s after me other hand! I can’t stay here!
Captain Hook Go away! Oh, I can’t stand the sight of him!
Captain Hook Smee, you take care of them!
Peter Pan Fly, Sora! Just believe, and you can do it!
Sora Thanks, Peter.
Peter Pan Hey, don’t mention it. You didn’t think I’d leave you and Tink behind, did you?
Sora You’re all going down!
Genie Toodle-oo!
Captain Hook Is that you, Smee? Did you finish them off?
Peter Pan (as Smee) Aye, Captain. They walked the plank, every last one of them.
Captain Hook P-Peter Pa—blast you!
Peter Pan Ready to make a splash, you codfish? Now it’s your turn to talk the plank!
Captain Hook Fire!
Captain Hook (mockingly) Come and get me!
Goofy Uh, Kairi couldn’t wake up, so maybe she’s really lost her—
Donald Shh!
Peter Pan Sora.
Sora I still can’t believe it.
Sora I really flew. Wait ‘til I tell Kairi. I wonder if she’ll believe me. Probably not.
Peter Pan You can bring her to Never Land sometime. Then she can try it herself.
Sora If you believe, you can do anything, right? I’ll find Kairi. I know I will. There’s so much I want to tell her—about flying, the pirates, and everything else that’s happened.
Peter Pan What’s that, Tink? What about the clock tower? You say there’s something there?
Riku Hey, Sora.
Sora (looking back at him) Hm?
Riku When we grow up, let’s get off this island. We’ll go on real adventures, not this kid stuff!
Sora Sure. But isn’t there anything fun to do now? Hey, you know the new girl at the mayor’s house? She arrived on the night of the meteor shower!
Maleficent (deriding) It was reckless to bring her here without at least using a vessel. Remember, relying too heavily on the dark powers could cost you your heart.
Maleficent A castaway.
Maleficent Though his world perished, his heart did not. When we took the princess from his castle, he apparently followed her here through sheer force of will. But fear not. No harm will come to you. He is no match for your power.
Riku My power?
Maleficent Yes, the untapped power that lies within you. Now, child, it’s time you awakened that power and realized your true potential.
Wendy Peter, are you really going back to Never Land?
Peter Pan Afraid so. But we can see each other any time. As long as you don’t forget about Never Land, that is.
Peter Pan Oh, boy. She’s getting’ steamed again. Do me a favor. Look after her for me, will ya?
Sora What?
Wendy Peter remains with me as long as I remember him. You will find Kairi if she remains in your heart. You’ll find her Sora. Just don’t give up.
Donald Well, we found the Navi-Gummi piece. Let’s go back to town.
Sora Cid’ll install it on the ship once we bring it to him.
Sora Pinocchio?
Pinocchio Hey, it’s Sora!
Geppetto Well, hello, Sora!
Sora How did you get here?
Geppetto A man named Leon helped us. He even got us this house to live in. I don’t know how I’ll ever repay his kindness. Say, I hear you three are fighting the Heartless. I thought I might be able to help you, so I made this.
Sora For us?
Geppetto But of course! Pinocchio and I can’t thank you enough! We’ll do anything we can to help you.
Pinocchio I’m being good, even without Jiminy’s help.
Cid Looks like you found the other one. Let me see it.
Cid Okay, wait here. I’ll get it installed right now.
Donald Sora!
Goofy Now, just remember what Donald said to ya: no frowning, no sad faces.
Sora How can you be so cheerful? There’s still no sign of your king. Aren’t you worried?
Donald Aw, phooey.
Goofy The king told us to go out and find the key bearer, and we found you. So as long as we stick together, it’ll all work out okay. Ya just gotta believe in yourself, that’s all.
Sora Just believe...
Kairi I believe in you.
Sora Where am I?
Grandmother Long ago, people lived in peace, bathed in the warmth of light. Everyone loved the light. Then people began to fight over it. They wanted to keep it for themselves. And darkness was born in their hearts. The darkness spread, swallowing the light and many people’s hearts. It covered everything, and the world disappeared. But small fragments of light survived...in the hearts of children. With these fragments of light, children rebuilt the lost world. It’s the world we live in now. But the true light sleeps, deep within the darkness. That’s why the worlds are still scattered, divided from each other. But someday, a door to the innermost darkness will open. And the true light will return. So, listen, child. Even in the deepest darkness, there will always be a light to guide you. Believe in the light, and the darkness will never defeat you. Your heart will shine with its power and push the darkness away. Do you understand, Kairi?
Sora Kairi!?
Sora (shocked) Huh?
Goofy What’s the matter?
Sora Um, nothing. Kairi... Did you call me?
Cid I installed that navigation gummi. But, ya know? That place is crawling with Heartless. Don’t say I didn’t warn you.
Cid Here, take this along.
Hercules Show me what you’ve got!
Sora Hercules, wait. Let’s go one-on-one!
Donald Oh, brother. What a show-off.
Goofy What’re we gonna do?
Donald Let him go alone, I guess.
Goofy Good luck, Sora!
Hercules I’m not gonna go easy on you!
Hercules Wow! And I didn’t even hold back!
Sora Now I finally know what you mean about strength of heart. Mine comes from Donald and Goofy.
Philoctetes Come again?
Sora If we stick together, we’re unbeatable. Not even Hercules stands a chance.
Sora With these guys beside me, I’m ready for anything!
Philoctetes But that’s not exactly what I—
Hercules (picking Phil up) Of course. Your friends give you strength. Isn’t that right, Phil? The three of you together make great heroes.
Hercules And as a team, I’m sure you can overcome anything.
Hercules Phil wasn’t happy that I lost to you. Said I was getting soft. You beat me last time, but next time won’t be so easy.
Goofy Gawrsh, look at that!
Sora I know this place...
Goofy Hmm, that’s strange.
Sora I wonder why... I feel this warmth inside, right here.
Donald Aw, you’re just hungry.
Sora Hey, I’m serious!
Sora Let’s go!
Riku No vessel, no help from the Heartless... So tell me, how’d you get here?
Beast I simply believed. Nothing more to it. When our world fell into darkness, Belle was taken from me. I vowed I would find her again no matter what the cost. I believed I would find her. So, here I am. She must be here. I will have her back!
Riku (challenging) Take her, if you can!
Sora Stop!
Riku So, you finally made it. About time. I’ve been waiting for you. We’ve always been rivals, haven’t we? You’ve always pushed me as I’ve always pushed you.
Sora Riku...
Riku But it all ends here. There can’t be two Keyblade masters.
Sora What are you talking about?
Riku Let the Keyblade choose...
Riku ...its true master.
Sora & Goofy Huh?
Donald What!?
Riku Maleficent was right. You don’t have what it takes to save Kairi.
Riku It’s up to me. Only the Keyblade master can open the secret door...
Riku ...and change the world.
Sora But that’s impossible. How did this happen? I’m the one who fought my way here with the Keyblade!
Riku You were just the delivery boy.
Riku Sorry, your part’s over now. Here, go play hero with this.
Donald Goofy. Let’s go. We have to remember our mission.
Goofy Oh! Well, I know the king told us to follow the key and all... But...
Donald Sora, Sorry.
Sora Hey, don’t move. You’re hurt.
Beast Why... Why did you...you come here? I came to fight for Belle.
Beast And though I am on my own, I will fight. I won’t leave without her. That’s why I’m here.
Sora Me too. I’m not gonna give up now. I came here to find someone very important to me.
Maleficent O purest of hearts! Reveal to me the Keyhole!
Beast Be on your guard. They’re close, I can feel it. Are you ready for them?
Beast Belle?
Riku Quit while you can.
Sora No. Not without Kairi.
Riku The darkness will destroy you.
Sora You’re wrong, Riku. The darkness may destroy my body, but it can’t touch my heart.
Sora My heart will stay with my friends. It’ll never die!
Riku Really... Well, we’ll just see about that!
Goofy Sora ain’t gonna go anywhere!
Riku You’d betray your king?
Goofy Not on your life! But I’m not gonna betray Sora, either, ‘cause he’s become one of my best buddies after all we’ve been through together!
Goofy (waving) See ya later, Donald. Could ya tell the king I’m really sorry?
Donald Hold on, Goofy! We’ll tell him together.
Donald Well, you know... All for one and one for all.
Goofy I guess you’re stuck with us, Sora.
Sora (staring at the floor) Thanks a lot... Donald, Goofy.
Riku How will you fight without a weapon?
Sora I know now I don’t need the Keyblade. I’ve got a better weapon. My heart.
Riku Your heart? What good will that weak little thing do for you?
Sora All though my heart may be weak, it’s not alone. It’s grown with each new experience, and it’s found a home with all the friends I’ve made. I’ve become a part of their heart just as they’ve become a part of mine. And if they think of me now and then...if they don’t forget me...then our hearts will be one.
Sora I don’t need a weapon. My friends are my power!
Riku No... Not yet...
Beast So, your heart won this battle.
Riku Why? It was mine.
????? Know this.
????? The heart that is strong and true shall win the Keyblade.
Riku What? You’re saying my heart’s weaker than his?
????? For that instant, it was.
????? However, you can become stronger.
????? You showed no fear in stepping through the door to darkness. It held no terror for you. Plunge deeper into the darkness, and your heart will grow even stronger.
Riku What should I do?
????? It’s really quite simple. Open yourself to the darkness. That is all. Let your heart, your being become darkness itself.
Riku So, I see the path has emerged at last.
Maleficent Yes. The Keyhole to the darkness.
Riku Unlock it and the Heartless will overrun this world.
Maleficent What do I care? The darkness holds no power over me. Rather, I will use its power to rule all worlds.
Riku Such confidence.
Maleficent Oh!
Maleficent Impossible! The princesses of heart are all here! It must be her.
Riku Without her heart, she will never be able to release her power.
Maleficent The king’s fools are here. I’ll deal with them myself.
Maleficent You stay here and guard the princesses.
Maleficent I’m afraid you’re too late. Any moment now, the final Keyhole will be unsealed. This world will be plunged into darkness. It is unstoppable.
Sora (arming himself with the Keyblade) We’ll stop it! After coming this far, there’s no way we’re gonna let that happen!
Maleficent You poor, simple fools. You think you can defeat me? Me, the mistress of all evil?
Maleficent Now you’ll know the meaning of fear! A bolt of lightning to strike them down!
Maleficent No!
Maleficent Meteors of heaven, unleash thy fury!
Sora Give me strength!
Maleficent Come out!
Maleficent Away!
Maleficent No!
Riku Do you need some help?
Sora Riku!
Donald Is that—
Riku Yes. A Keyblade.
Riku But unlike yours, this Keyblade holds the power to unlock people’s hearts. Allow me to demonstrate... Behold!
Maleficent Wha—
Riku Now, open your heart, surrender it to the darkness! Become darkness itself!
Maleficent This is it! This power!
Maleficent Darkness... The true darkness!
Beast Step aside!
Riku How ironic. She was just another puppet after all.
Donald What?
Riku The Heartless were using Maleficent from the beginning. She failed to notice the darkness in her heart eating away at her. A fitting end for such a fool.
Sora Kairi!
Sora (gently shaking her) Kairi! Kairi! Open your eyes!
Riku It’s no use.
Riku That girl has lost her heart. She cannot wake up.
Sora What? You... You’re not Riku.
Riku The Keyhole cannot be completed so long as the last princess of heart still sleeps.
Sora (looking down at her) The princess...? Kairi’s a princess?
Riku Yes, and without her power, the Keyhole will remain incomplete. It is time she awakened.
Sora Whoever you are, let Riku go! Give him back his heart!
Riku But first, you must give the princess back her heart.
Donald Sora!
Sora What’s—
Riku Don’t you see yet?
Riku The princess’s heart is responding. It has been there all along. Kairi’s heart rests within you!
Sora Kairi... Kairi’s inside me?
Riku I know all that there is to know.
Sora Tell me. Who are you?
Riku (smiling) It is I, Ansem, the seeker of darkness.
Ansem So, I shall release you now, Princess. Complete the Keyhole with your power. Open the door, lead me into everlasting darkness!
Kairi Sora!
Sora (standing) Forget it! There’s no way you’re taking Kairi’s heart!
Ansem Come!
Ansem Now witness true power!
Ansem Behold the power of darkness!
Sora Riku!
Donald Sora! Sora, look!
Goofy The... The Keyhole!
Goofy It won’t work! The Keyhole’s not finished yet!
Sora What can we do?
Goofy Maybe we’ve gotta go wake Kairi up.
Sora I think you’re right.
Sora If we can free her heart... But... But how?
Sora A Keyblade that unlocks people’s hearts... I wonder.
Goofy Sora?
Goofy Sora, hold on!
Donald No, wait!
Donald Sora... Sora!
Kairi Sora!
Donald (shouting) Sora! Come back, Sora!
Sora What’s... What’s happening to me? Falling...falling...into darkness.
Kairi Sora, are you really—No. He can’t be! I won’t let him go!
Ansem So, you have awakened at last, Princess. The Keyhole is now complete. You have served your purpose. But now it’s over.
Donald Don’t make another move!
Goofy (to Donald) Do you think we can stop him all by ourselves?
Donald I don’t know!
Ansem Impossible...
Riku No. You won’t use me for this!
Kairi Riku!
Riku You’ve got to run! The Heartless are coming!
Goofy What about the Keyhole?
Donald Let’s just get out of here!
Goofy Kairi, hurry!
Kairi I can’t leave them behind!
Donald We can’t stay here!
Donald I’ll take care of him!
Donald Confounded Heartless! Get lost, will ya?
Kairi Sora? Is that you?
Goofy Uh-oh!
Kairi This time, I’ll protect you.
Kairi Sora!
Goofy Kairi!
Sora Kairi, thank you.
Kairi Sora...
Donald & Goofy Sora!
Beast Go! Now!
Sora Come with us!
Beast I told you before, I’m not leaving without Belle. Now, go! The Heartless are coming!
Sora All right. Let’s get out of here.
Leon Tell me what happened.
Leon So the darkness is flowing out of that Keyhole...
Aerith No wonder there are more and more Heartless everywhere. The only way to stop them is—
Sora (holding up his Keyblade) Seal the Keyhole, right?
Leon Maybe. But no one knows what will happen once it’s sealed.
Sora (concerned) Well, we can’t just stay here. We have to do something. I’ve got a friend back there.
Leon That’s right. You have one more friend to worry about. Riku’s Keyblade must have been born of the captive princesses’ hearts—just like that Keyhole you saw.
Leon Of course, without Kairi’s heart, it remained incomplete. Once that Keyblade was destroyed, the princesses’ hearts should have been freed. Don’t worry, Sora. If anyone can save your friend, you can.
Yuffie Not sure why, but the Heartless are getting stronger. New types of Heartless are popping up all over the place! If anything happens to us, I know we can count on you, Sora.
Kairi Even in your Heartless form, I knew it was you.
Aerith I thought the Keyhole would strength the darkness. I mean the darkness is strong, but still... It’s almost as if someone is holding the darkness back.
Leon It seems the other princesses have been freed as well. Jasmine apparently hasn’t returned to Agrabah. I suspect the others are still in the castle, too.
Aerith Do you remember seeing a man with spiky hair at the coliseum?
Sora Yup.
Aerith I wonder if he’s still searching for his friend? Sora. If you see him, please tell him to be careful. He’s not that friendly, but we all care about him dearly.
Sora Cid, I need to go back to Hollow Bastion.
Cid I don’t think I can let you do that, kid. The Heartless there are multiplying by the minute. They’d eat your ship up.
Sora Then what can we do?
Cid Simple. Go around ‘em instead of through. Install a new navigation gummi and take a new route.
Sora A new gummi? From where?
Cid The secret waterway. When I came here 9 years ago, I stored it there in case I ever needed it. Never thought a kid would be the one to use it!
Kairi What a mysterious mural... It’s almost hypnotizing.
Sora Let’s go back and join the others. We should rest up
Kairi Okay.
Kairi A light at the end of the tunnel...
Sora Oh, your grandma’s story, right?
Kairi That’s right. We were together.
Sora You know what’s funny? I looked everywhere for you, but you were with me all along. Finally, we’re together, Kairi.
Sora Now, it’s time to get Riku back.
Kairi You think it’ll ever be the same again between us? Riku’s lost his...
Sora When I turned into a Heartless, you saved me, remember?
Sora I was lost in the darkness. I couldn’t find my way. As I stumbled through the dark, I started forgetting things—my friends, who I was. The darkness almost swallowed me. But then I heard a voice—your voice. You brought me back.
Kairi I didn’t want to just forget about you, Sora. I couldn’t.
Sora That’s it! Our hearts are connected.
Sora And the light from our hearts broke through the darkness. I saw that light. I think that’s what saved me. No matter how deep the darkness, a light shines within. I guess it’s more than just a fairy tale.
Kairi Well, let’s go.
Sora You can’t go.
Kairi Why not?
Sora Because it’s way too dangerous.
Kairi Come on, Sora. We made it this far by sticking together. You can’t go alone.
Sora Kairi, even if we’re apart, we’re not alone anymore. Right?
Kairi I can’t help?
Sora (chuckling) You’d kind of be in my way.
Kairi (smiling) Okay. You win.
Kairi Take this.
Kairi (firmly) It’s my lucky charm. Be sure to bring it back to me.
Sora Don’t worry. I will.
Kairi Promise?
Sora Promise.
Kairi Don’t ever forget. Wherever you go, I’m always with you.
Riku Sora... Kairi... I’m sorry...
Riku Is this the afterworld?
Riku I’m not ready. Not yet. Not until I see Sora and Kairi one last time...
????? Riku, can you hear me? I’ll be there soon.
Riku Who is that?
????? I have the other Keyblade—the one that belongs to this world.
????? I’ve been trying to get through to you, but the darkness in your heart kept me away.
Riku Who are you? What’s happened to me?
????? Your heart won the battle against the darkness, but it was too late for your body. That’s why you’re here—in this place of darkness where hearts are gathered.
Riku So what do I do?
????? The Door of Darkness will open soon, but it’s a door we can’t enter. It has to be closed from both sides. To do this, you need two keys and two hearts. Maybe you’re here for the same reason I am. Maybe it was fate.
Riku Fate, huh? You seem to know everything, don’t you? Then tell me: Are Sora and Kairi okay?
????? Don’t you feel the echoes of their hearts? You already know the answer. Look inside your own heart.
Riku Okay.
Cid You found it? All right, I’ll go fix up your ship.
Tigger This here is my bouncin’ spot! We can bounce around here all day!
Roo Nothing beats bouncin’!
Tigger You wanna bounce, too, Sora? It’s lotsa fun!
Sora Okay!
Owl To bounce with the finest, you’ll need some pointers from the finest.
Roo But, Owl, you don’t bounce around like we do!
Owl (sighing) I’m afraid you’re right. I can’t master everything, I suppose.
Tigger Bounce this way, please!
Tigger Here’s a little warm-up.
Tigger Now it gets tricky!
Tigger You’re doin’ fantastical! This’ll be the last one.
Tigger You’ve gotten mighty good at bouncin’, Sora! Right, Roo?
Roo Hey, Tigger! I think he’s ready for the big one!
Tigger Well, there’s only one way to find out!
Pooh This tree doesn’t have honey, I see.
Piglet I wonder what this is.
Owl Rare nuts grow on these trees. I’ll trade you things for them.
Owl Look at all these nuts! We couldn’t have done it without you. What are they for? It’s a secret.
Fairy Godmother Oh, another summon gem? Let’s help this little one. Here we go! Bibbidi-bobbidi-boo!
Fairy Godmother Thank you, Sora. Here’s something for you.
Fairy Godmother Take good care of them.
Cid All set! You can get going any time. Kid, I gotta say, I wish you didn’t have to face all this danger. Don’t get cocky just ‘cause you’ve been there before. That castle’s probably crawling with ‘em now...
Chip There’s a new warp hole near Traverse Town.
Dale I wonder where it leads... Hmm. Some weird power is emanating from the worlds.
Chip Might be worth revisiting some places again.
Hades Yo, hey, how’re you doin’ everybody, yeah. Got a minute? Hades, Lord of the Dead. Nice to see you. Hey, guess what? I got a place for you down under!
Hades Feel the heat...
Hades That all you’ve got?
Hades That’s it!
Hades Oh! Hey, kid, wh-what are you doing?
Hades Stop! Hey, guys! G-Get away from me! Come on! Come on!
Donald Sora!
Donald Sora!
Sora Where’s Belle?
Beast Still in the castle.
Goofy Against her will?
Beast No, I think she stayed for a reason. The other princesses are inside as well.
Donald I wonder why?
Sora Let’s go ask them.
Beast You may need my strength. I’ll go with you.
Beast Belle!
Belle You’ve come to seal the Keyhole, right? Please, be careful. The darkness is raging deep inside. We’ve been holding it back, but we can’t hold out much longer.
Sora We’ll take care of it.
Belle This is for you. Use it to face the darkness, as the Beast has.
Belle So many books, but not one on how to banish the darkness. Maybe it’s hopeless...
Cinderella We’ve been waiting for you, Keyblade master.
Sora Where’s Ansem?
Cinderella Gone.
Aurora When the Keyhole appeared, darkness poured out of it. It swallowed Ansem, and he disappeared.
Cinderella Though Ansem is gone, the flood of darkness hasn’t stopped. We’re working together to hold it back.
Aurora I cannot forget the look on his face. As the darkness engulfed him, he was smiling.
Jasmine Sora, please hurry! Darkness is pouring from the Keyhole.
Alice It’s all we can do just to hold back the darkness.
Snow White I don’t even know how long we can manage even that.
Sora All right, I’m on my way.
Snow White We’re counting on you, Keyblade master. In the meantime, we’ll do what we can, too.
Aurora Ansem has ignored us since the Keyhole appeared.
Cinderella I don’t think Ansem will ever return.
Alice We must close the Keyhole before it’s too late.
Jasmine Can you feel the immense power flowing from that Keyhole?
Snow White Please hurry. Our strength is running out.
Goofy Now let’s go and seal that big Keyhole!
???? Sora. You did it.
Sora What are you guys doing here?
Yuffie We came in Cid’s ship.
Aerith This is our childhood home. We wanted to see it again.
Leon It’s in worse shape than I feared. It used to be so peaceful...
Aerith Don’t worry. If we defeat Ansem, all should be restored. Including your island.
Sora Really?
Yuffie But, it also means goodbye.
Aerith Once the worlds are restored, they’ll all be separate again.
Yuffie Everyone will go back to where they came from.
Sora Then I’ll visit you guys with the gummi ship.
Leon (crossing his arms) It’s not that simple.
Yuffie Before all this, you didn’t know about the other worlds, right?
Aerith Because every world was isolated. Impassable walls divided them.
Yuffie The Heartless destroyed those walls. But if the worlds return, so will the walls.
Leon Which means gummi ships will be useless.
Sora So you’re saying we’ll never...?
Leon We may never meet again, but we’ll never forget each other.
Aerith No matter where we are, our hearts will bring us together again.
Yuffie Besides, I couldn’t forget you even if I wanted to.
Sora What’s that supposed to mean?
Donald Sora!
Goofy Hurry! Come and close the Keyhole!
Leon Sora, good luck.
Alice Thank you, Sora. I think the darkness has begun to weaken.
Jasmine But I can feel a powerful darkness growing somewhere far away.
Aurora It’s the heart of the darkness. It must be where Ansem went.
Sora Then we’ll take the gummi ship and deal with both Ansem and the Heartless.
Cinderella A worthy answer, Keyblade master. We offer this power to aid your battle.
Snow White Sora, your courage can bring back our worlds.
Aurora Once the darkness is gone, all should return to its original state.
Sora Kairi will be back on the island?
Cinderella Most certainly. And you should be, too.
Sora I can’t go home ‘til I find Riku and the king.
Cinderella I still can’t believe we played a part in opening the Keyhole. To think we had such a power... Simply unimaginable! My world is gone, so I suppose I must stay here for the time being.
Alice The darkness still lingers, so we’ll stay as well. Otherwise, this world will be destroyed, too. We’ll do all we can. You helped me during that silly trial. Now it’s my turn to help you.
Aurora Maleficent used to live in our world. She used her great powers to control the darkness... But eventually it came to control her. I’m so glad the others are here with me.
Snow Whtie The darkness took my home. I don’t know where to go now. I hope my loved ones are safe somewhere. I’ll do whatever I can to keep this world from being taken, too. I just want everything back as it was before.
Jasmine Please don’t tell Aladdin about all this. He will worry to death if you do! I will tell him about it, once I return to Agrabah. I hope everything is all right in Agrabah.
Aerith Sora, you should read this.
Sora Read what?
Aerith It’s the rest of Ansem’s report. Maleficent must have collected it.
Aerith Ansem disappeared when this world fell to the darkness. It was believed he died defending people from the Heartless. But Ansem was the one who brought them here. Ansem waits in darkness. But here’s a little light to protect you, Sora.
Aerith Read that report and you’ll understand Ansem’s intentions. I believe the worlds can be restored. They are still alive.
Yuffie Ansem and Maleficent were both possessed by darkness. You know, I just don’t get it. What’s so great about the darkness?
Leon This was once Ansem’s castle. He was widely respected as a wise man. But darkness took him. He began experimenting with people’s hearts. Heh, some wise man. So much suffering and ruin, and for what?
Yuffie This is my home, but it just doesn’t feel like it. I don’t remember much, ‘cause I was only a kid.
Leon We thought this was Maleficent’s doing. But she was just another puppet of the darkness. Just like Ansem. This darkness is our real enemy. But how to beat it? Well, first things first. Let’s purge every last Heartless we can find.
Yuffie There are no Heartless here, so rest up. We’ve gotta get rid of the Heartless and rebuild this world.
Leon I won’t use my real name until this world is restored.
Belle Ansem desires the darkness. He thinks it’s the source of all power. What nonsense. Darkness may shroud light, but it can never extinguish it. Sora, don’t succumb to the darkness. You and the Keyblade can defeat it.
Cloud I’ve been looking for you.
Sephiroth As have I.
Cloud As long as you exist, I’ll never wake from this nightmare. You’re my darkness.
Sephiroth (extending his arms) I’m a part of you, am I? Then join me in this eternal nightmare untarnished by light.
Cinderella Could the appearance of that gate be a bad omen?
Snow White There’s an ominous presence beyond the gate.
Alice What is this feeling? It’s different from darkness... Be careful, Sora!
Aurora I sense a presence coming from that gate... But it’s not darkness. It’s another power altogether. It may be even more dangerous than darkness.
Jasmine We could suppress the power if it were darkness. But this is different. It’s a force unlike darkness... A force different from both the light and the darkness.
Sora (standing) Who are you?
?????? Ah, it seems you are special, too.
Goofy Ansem?
?????? That name rings familiar.
?????? You remind me of him.
Sora What’s that supposed to mean?
?????? It means you are not whole.
?????? You are incomplete. Allow me—to test your strength.
?????? Impressive.
?????? This will be enjoyable.
Sora What are you talking about?
?????? It is beyond your comprehension, for now.
?????? Until we meet again.
Sora Wait, what are you—
?????? I am—
?????? ...but a mere shell.
Sora What are you doing, Pooh?
Pooh (pressing a finger to his lips) Shh. Quiet, or they’ll get away!
Sora Who?
Pooh The people who took everyone away. See their footprints? We were all sticking together to make sure no one got lost again. But then, I saw some footprints that needed following. So I did. Suddenly, everyone was gone. Bad people must have taken them away!
Sora Actually, Pooh, I think those footprints are... Um... Anyway, I’ll help you look for your friends.
Sora Eeyore?
Eeyore Hello.
Sora What are you doing?
Eeyore Lookin’ for sticks to build my house...again.
Sora Sticks for your house?
Sora This place already feels like a house... Seems like a great spot to gather everyone once we find them.
Tigger I saw Pooh walkin’ away, so I bounced after him! Then I bounced a bit too high, and I lost sight of ol’ Pooh Bear!
Roo I tried bouncin’ as high as Tigger. I was so busy tryin’ to bounce, I forgot to watch where I was bouncin’!
Sora Hello, Piglet. So this is where you’ve been. Maybe I should bring Pooh along.
Owl I thought I’d better have a word with Roo about his bouncing. The next thing I knew, quite to my surprise, I was lost, too!
Rabbit Owl looked so intent on something, well, I just had to follow him! But then Owl flew off into the sky, and there I was, all by myself.
Pooh Hello, Piglet.
Piglet Pooh! Where are we?
Pooh I don’t know where we are either, Piglet. But if we go back the way we came, we should find home.
Piglet I got scared when everyone disappeared, so I hid.
Pooh Everyone’s here!
Piglet I’m so glad we’re all together again.
Piglet I didn’t know what to do when I was all alone.
Tigger Aw, Piglet, you gotta be brave.
Piglet You weren’t lonely at all?
Tigger Lonely? Are you kiddin’? I’m a Tigger! The most wonderful thing about Tiggers is I’m the only one. But I do admit, friends are awfully fun, too!
Pooh Think, think, think.
Sora Hey, Pooh, what are you thinking about now?
Pooh Oh, well, I’m just thinking about what to think about.
Sora Well, I’m off.
Piglet Sora, where are you going?
Sora I’m gonna go look for my friends. They’re waiting for me.
Tigger (happily) Bounce on back again!
Piglet I hope you find your friends!
Pooh Sora, don’t forget... We shall always be here.
Pooh If you’d like to visit again, that is.
Owl You’ve been a great help, Sora. Thank you! You helped Pooh get honey from the bees. You helped protect Rabbit’s carrots. You helped find Eeyore’s lost tail. You bounced along with Tigger and Roo. And you found all of us when we were lost. We can’t thank you enough. This is from all of us in the Hundred Acre Wood.
Goofy Gawrsh, is that all that’s left of the worlds taken by the Heartless?
Sora Those worlds will be restored if we beat Ansem, right?
Donald You betcha.
Sora But, if we do beat him and all these worlds become restored and disconnected, what’s gonna happen to this place? And to us?
Donald Well, uh...
Goofy This is a Heartless world, so maybe it’ll just disappear.
Sora & Donald Huh?!
Goofy (hopeful) But no worries. Even if this place goes poof, our hearts ain’t goin’ nowhere. I’m sure we’ll find our pals again. Yup, I just know that we will.
Sora (nodding) Yeah, you’re right.
Sora thinking I’ll return this. I promise.
Goofy I wonder where that Ansem feller went?
Donald Dive into the most dangerous place and we’ll find him!
Sora Huh?
Donald What’s wrong?
Sora Don’t you hear something? There!
Voice Careful. This is the last haven you’ll find here. Beyond, there is no light to protect you. But don’t be afraid. Your heart is the mightiest weapon of all. Remember, you are the one who will open the door to the light.
Donald I don’t hear anything.
Sora Strange... That voice was so familiar. Maybe it’s just my imagination.
Donald Maybe you’d better take a rest!
Sora Is this... Is this my island?
Ansem This world has been connected.
Goofy What was that?
Ansem Tied to the darkness... Soon to be completely eclipsed.
Ansem There is so very much to learn.
Ansem You understand so little.
Ansem A meaningless effort. One who knows nothing can understand nothing.
Ansem Take a look at this tiny place. To the heart seeking freedom this is a prison surrounded by water. And so this boy sought out to escape from his prison.
Ansem He sought a way to cross over into other worlds. And he opened his heart to darkness.
Sora (reaching out to him) Riku!
Ansem Don’t bother. Your voice can no longer reach him where he is. His heart belongs again to darkness. All worlds begin in darkness, and all so end. The heart is no different.
Ansem Darkness sprouts within it, it grows, consumes it. Such is its nature. In the end, every heart returns to the darkness whence it came.
Ansem You see, darkness is the heart’s true essence.
Sora That’s not true! The heart may be weak. And sometimes it may even give in. But I’ve learned that deep down, there’s a light that never goes out!
Ansem So, you have come this far and still you understand nothing. Every light must fade, every heart return to darkness!
Ansem Come, Guardian!
Ansem Submit!
Ansem Come. Open your heart...
Ansem My strength returns.
Sora Wha...?
Ansem Behold the endless abyss! Within it lies the heart of all worlds:
Ansem Kingdom Hearts! Look as hard as you are able. You’ll not find even the smallest glimmer of light. From those dark depths are all hearts born. Even yours.
Ansem Darkness conquers all worlds!
Riku Giving up already? Come on, Sora. I thought you were stronger than that.
Ansem Turn to darkness!
Ansem All shall be extinguished. (Orbs appear around Sora, and before he has a chance to duck, he is hit by a cluster of lasers. Sora flies downward away from them, but also away from Ansem)
Ansem Come forth.
Goofy Sora!
Donald Sora!
Sora Give me strength!
Donald (yelling) Let me at him!
Goofy Come on!
Ansem Come...darkness!
Ansem Now...you weak-hearted fools...witness real power!
Ansem Now show me what your precious light can do.
Ansem Still confused? Then perhaps this will enlighten you!
Ansem Welcome the darkness into your heart.
Ansem (faintly) Is this the answer? I can’t be...
Ansem It is futile. The Keyblade alone cannot seal the door to darkness.
Ansem Kingdom Hearts! Fill me with the power of darkness...
Ansem Supreme darkness...
Sora You’re wrong. I know now, without a doubt, Kingdom Hearts... is light!
Ansem Light...
Ansem But... Why...
Sora Come on!
Donald Stop staring and keep pushing!
Donald Huh?!
Donald & Goofy The Heartless!?
Donald Hurry!
Sora I can’t...
Riku Don’t give up!
Riku Come on, Sora! Together, we can do it!
Sora Okay!
Donald It’s hopeless!
Donald & Goofy Huh?
Donald & Goofy Your Majesty!
Mickey Now, Sora! Let’s close this door for good!
Donald Close it, quick!
Sora But...
Mickey Don’t worry. There will always be a door to the light.
Goofy Sora, you can trust King Mickey.
Riku (whirling around towards Mickey) Now! They’re coming!
Mickey (sincerely) Donald, Goofy, thank you.
Riku Take care of her.
Sora Kairi!
Kairi Sora!
Sora Kairi, remember what you said before? I’m always with you, too.
Sora I’ll come back to you. I promise!
Kairi I know you will!
Donald Well, now what do we do?
Sora We’ve gotta find Riku and King Mickey.
Goofy But, uh, where do we start lookin’ for that there door to the light?
Donald Pluto?
Goofy Hey, Pluto. Where have you been?
Sora Huh?
Donald Hey!
Goofy Gawrsh, that’s the king’s seal!
Sora Hey, have you seen King Mickey?
Sora Guys, let’s go!
Voice Remember, Sora. You are the one who will open the door to the light.
XIII Where’s Sora? We must find him.
12[Ansem’s other report] A creation born of ignorance.
11Behind the darkness =/= Door to the light
XThe secret place His voice... It’s left me. This time... I’ll fight.
9A world between = A forgotten world The gathering
VIIIThe third enemy = NOBODY Who is Nobody, you ask? They are the nonexistent ones.
VIIENDLESS What took you so long, Kairi? Can we do it? Against that?
6[The Thirteenth Order] ID Metamorphosis Sora? Sora... Why? Your Highness! But why?
5Change The third key
4End of the world What is this place!? Is this the answer you’ve been looking for? This is the world in its true form. Maybe our journey meant nothing after all.
3Paradise We’ll go together.
