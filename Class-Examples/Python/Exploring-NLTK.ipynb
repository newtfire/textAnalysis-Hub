    "## Hello DIGIT world!\n",
    "Welcome, DIGIT student Python adventurer! This is the **Jupyter Notebook** version of my [exploring-nltk.py](exploring-nltk.py) file. The cells in the notebook will help me demonstrate particular things in class without having to comment everything else out. Jupyter notebooks are written with a combination of markdown cells (like this) for documentation, and cells with executable scripts. You usually have to run the cells in order, but you can choose which ones to run. I'm splitting up my exploring-nltk.py file into tidy cells because my commenting was getting a bit out of hand inside the file."
