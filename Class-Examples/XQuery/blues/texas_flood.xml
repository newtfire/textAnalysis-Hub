<lyrics>



Well there's floodin' down in Texas, all of the telephone
lines are down

Well there's floodin' down in Texas, all of the telephone lines are
down

And I've been tryin' to call my baby, Lord and I can't get a single
sound



Well dark clouds are rollin' in, man I'm standin' out in the rain

Well dark clouds are rollin' in, man I'm standin' out in the rain

Yeah flood water keep a rollin', man it's about to drive poor me
insane



Well I'm leavin' you baby, Lord and I'm goin' back home to stay

Well I'm leavin' you baby, Lord and I'm goin' back home to stay

Well back home I know floods and tornados, baby the sun shines every
day
