<lyrics>


<l>Well there's floodin' down in Texas, all of the telephone
lines are down

</l>
<l>Well there's floodin' down in Texas, all of the telephone lines are
down

</l>
<l>And I've been tryin' to call my baby, Lord and I can't get a single

sound




</l>
<l>Well dark clouds are rollin' in, man I'm standin' out in the rain

</l>
<l>Well dark clouds are rollin' in, man I'm standin' out in the rain

</l>
<l>Yeah flood water keep a rollin', man it's about to drive poor me

insane




</l>
<l>Well I'm leavin' you baby, Lord and I'm goin' back home to stay

</l>
<l>Well I'm leavin' you baby, Lord and I'm goin' back home to stay

</l>
<l>Well back home I know floods and tornados, baby the sun shines every

day
