Ah-oh, smokestack

 lightnin'

Shinin', just like gold

Why don't ya hear me cryin'?

A-whoo-hooo, oooo

Whooo



Whoa-oh, tell me, baby,

What's the, matter with you?

Why don't ya hear me cryin'?

Whoo-hooo, whoo-hooo

Whooo



Whoa-oh, tell me, baby,

Where did ya, stay last night?

A-why don't ya hear me cryin'?

Whoo-hooo, whoo-hooo

Whooo



Whoa-oh, stop your train,

Let her, go for a ride

Why don't ya hear me cryin'?

Whoo-hooo, whoo-hooo

Whooo



Whoa-oh, fare ya well

Never see, a you no more

A-why don't ya hear me cryin'?

Oooo, whoo-hooo, whoo-hooo

Whooo



Whoa-oh, who been here baby since,

I-I been gone, a little, bitty boy?

Girl, be on

A-whoo-hooo, whoo-hooo
