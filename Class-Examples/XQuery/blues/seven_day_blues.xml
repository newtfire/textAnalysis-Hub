<l>Every Monday mornin', people just a worry full day

</l>
<l>Every Monday mornin', people just a worry full day

</l>
<l>I think about my daddy, who's many miles away



</l>
<l>Every Tuesday mornin', whiskey is all I crave

</l>
<l>Every Tuesday mornin', whiskey is all I crave

</l>
<l>The blues and booze are goin' to carry me to my grave



</l>
<l>Wednesdays and Thursdays, I try to wear the blues away

</l>
<l>Wednesdays and Thursdays, I try to wear the blues away

</l>
<l>But when you get 'em about your daddy, they really come to stay



</l>
<l>Every Friday people, is always my bad luck day

</l>
<l>Every Friday people, is always my bad luck day

</l>
<l>That's the day my man packed up and went away



</l>
<l>I woke up Saturday mornin', tryin' to find my man

</l>
<l>I woke up Saturday mornin', tryin' to find my man

</l>
<l>I ain't got nobody to lend me a helpin' hand</l></lyrics></xml>
