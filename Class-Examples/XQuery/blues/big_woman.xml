<lyrics>



I want a tell ya about my baby, she used to weigh 383

She went to Jenny Craig, and now she's just as slim as me

Talkin' 'bout my baby, whoa yeah, that woman a-mine

Well she used to be a big woman, right now, she's slim and fine



She be on the cover of some-a magazine

'Cause that woman upset these men when she wear her blue jean

Oh yeah, talkin' about that woman a-mine

Well she used to be a big woman, right now, she's slim and fine



When summer comes she wears bathin' suit

Men gather 'round her 'cause she's so cute

Talkin' about my woman, whoa yeah, that woman a-mine

I wanna tell ya I wanna thank, Jenny Craig, 'cause right now she's
slim and fine
