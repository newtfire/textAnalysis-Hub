<l>I want a tell ya about my baby, she used to weigh 383

</l>
<l>She went to Jenny Craig, and now she's just as slim as me

</l>
<l>Talkin' 'bout my baby, whoa yeah, that woman a-mine

</l>
<l>Well she used to be a big woman, right now, she's slim and fine



</l>
<l>She be on the cover of some-a magazine

</l>
<l>'Cause that woman upset these men when she wear her blue jean

</l>
