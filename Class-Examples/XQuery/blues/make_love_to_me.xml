<lyrics>



Take me in your arms

And never let me go

Whisper to me softly

While the moon is low

Hold me close and tell me

What I wanna know

Say it to me gently

Let the sweet talk flow

Come a little closer

Make love to me



Kiss me once again

Before we say goodnight

Take me in your loving arms

And squeeze me tight

Put me in a mood

So I can dream all night

Everybody's sleeping

So it's quite all right

Come a little closer

Make love to me



When you're near

So help me, dear

Chills run

Up and down my spine

Don't you know

I love you so

I won't be happy

Till you're mine

When I'm in your arms

You give my heart a treat

Everything about you

So doggone sweet

Every time we kiss

You make my life complete

Baby don't you know

You swept me off my feet

Now's it's time to tell you

Make love to me



When you're near

So help me, dear

Chills run

Up and down my spine

Don't you know

I love you so

I won't be happy

Till you're mine

When I'm in your arms

You give my heart a treat

Everything about you

So doggone sweet

Every time we kiss

You make my life complete

Baby don't you know

You swept me off my feet

Now's it's time to tell you

Make love to me
