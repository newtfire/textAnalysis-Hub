<lyrics>


<l>I like cake, no mistake, but baby if you insist

</l>
<l>I'll cut out the cake, just for your sake

</l>
<l>Baby! C'mon and knock me a kiss



</l>
<l>I like pie, I hope to die, just to get a load of this

</l>
<l>When you get high, doggone the pie

</l>
<l>Baby! C'mon and knock me a kiss



</l>
<l>When you pressed your little lips to mine, that was then I
understood

</l>
<l>They taste like candy, brandy and wine, peaches, bananas and
everything good

</l>
<l>I love jam and no film flam, scratch that off my list

</l>
<l>This ain't no jam, the jam can scram

</l>
<l>Baby! C'mon and knock me a kiss



</l>
<l>When you pressed your sweet little lips to mine, that was then I
understood

</l>
<l>They taste like candy, brandy and wine, peaches, bananas and
everything good

</l>
<l>I like cars and big cigars but baby they won't be missed

</l>
<l>If everyday I hear you say

</l>
<l>Baby! C'mon and knock me a kiss



</l>
<l>Baby! C'mon and knock me a kiss</l></lyrics></xml>
