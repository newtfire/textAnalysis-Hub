<lyrics>



I like cake, no mistake, but baby if you insist

I'll cut out the cake, just for your sake

Baby! C'mon and knock me a kiss



I like pie, I hope to die, just to get a load of this

When you get high, doggone the pie

Baby! C'mon and knock me a kiss



When you pressed your little lips to mine, that was then I
understood

They taste like candy, brandy and wine, peaches, bananas and
everything good

I love jam and no film flam, scratch that off my list

This ain't no jam, the jam can scram

Baby! C'mon and knock me a kiss



When you pressed your sweet little lips to mine, that was then I
understood

They taste like candy, brandy and wine, peaches, bananas and
everything good

I like cars and big cigars but baby they won't be missed

If everyday I hear you say

Baby! C'mon and knock me a kiss



Baby! C'mon and knock me a kiss
