<l>When you told me was all over, babe

</l>
<l>You thought all I ever was, was through

</l>
<l>(Oooh-oh!)

</l>
<l>When you told me it was all over, babe

</l>
<l>Thought all I ever was through (oh yeah)

</l>
<l>I had three more irons in the fire

</l>
<l>Sorry, but I forgot to tell you



</l>
<l>(One more thing I'd like to tell you right now)

</l>
<l>Uh-huh



</l>
<l>You thought I'd be hurt when you left me, babe

</l>
<l>But I found another thing, (ooooowoo!)

</l>
<l>Yeah, you thought I'd be hurt when you left me, babe

</l>
<l>But I found another thing

</l>
<l>(Yeah, somebody else!)

</l>
<l>But sometime what you lose,

</l>
<l>Is nothin' compared to what you win



</l>
<l>(Ooow)

</l>
<l>(I'm gonna feel alright, yeah)

</l>
<l>(I feel alright)

</l>
<l>(Ooow-ooo)



</l>
<l>A good man may fall, babe (oh yeah)

</l>
<l>But ya get back on your feet

</l>
<l>(Yeeeaah, I know, I know, I know)

</l>
<l>You know, you know

</l>
<l>A good man may fall, babe

</l>
<l>You know ya get back on your feet

</l>
<l>Yes, I've got a good thing goin' now woman

</l>
<l>(Got a good thing goin' now)

</l>
<l>Oh, the future look good to me
