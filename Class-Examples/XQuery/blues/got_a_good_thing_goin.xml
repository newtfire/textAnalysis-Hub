<lyrics>



When you told me was all over, babe

You thought all I ever was, was through

(Oooh-oh!)

When you told me it was all over, babe

Thought all I ever was through (oh yeah)

I had three more irons in the fire

Sorry, but I forgot to tell you



(One more thing I'd like to tell you right now)

Uh-huh



You thought I'd be hurt when you left me, babe

But I found another thing, (ooooowoo!)

Yeah, you thought I'd be hurt when you left me, babe

But I found another thing

(Yeah, somebody else!)

But sometime what you lose,

Is nothin' compared to what you win



(Ooow)

(I'm gonna feel alright, yeah)

(I feel alright)

(Ooow-ooo)



A good man may fall, babe (oh yeah)

But ya get back on your feet

(Yeeeaah, I know, I know, I know)

You know, you know

A good man may fall, babe

You know ya get back on your feet

Yes, I've got a good thing goin' now woman

(Got a good thing goin' now)

Oh, the future look good to me

(Future looks so good to meeeee)

Alright
