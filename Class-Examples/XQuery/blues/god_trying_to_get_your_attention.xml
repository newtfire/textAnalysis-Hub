<lyrics>


<l>Well you might be saved

</l>
<l>You might be reborn

</l>
<l>You might own a car

</l>
<l>With a big loud horn



</l>
<l>Maybe it's just news

</l>
<l>On your television

</l>
<l>Or it might be God trying to get your attention



</l>
<l>Are you an engineer

</l>
<l>Working on a farm

</l>
<l>Or a Casanova

</l>
<l>With a whole lotta charme



</l>
<l>It might be a mouse

</l>
<l>Living in your kitchen

</l>
<l>Or it might be God trying to get your attention



</l>
<l>Well it might sound bad

</l>
<l>Or it might sound good

</l>
<l>Might be made of steel

</l>
<l>Or it might be made of wood



</l>
<l>Maybe it's just news

</l>
<l>On your television

</l>
<l>Or it might be God trying to get your attention



</l>
<l>Well it might be in the church house

</l>
<l>Or it might be on the street

</l>
<l>Somehow or another

</l>
<l>Every soul has got to meet



</l>
<l>Well it might be in the city

</l>
<l>Or it might be in town

</l>
<l>One way or another

</l>
<l>You're gonna find a higher ground



</l>
<l>Well you might be deaf

</l>
<l>Or you might be blind

</l>
<l>She'll put the message

</l>
<l>Right in your mind



</l>
<l>Might look like a plan

</l>
<l>Or a coalition

</l>
<l>Or it might be God trying to get your attention



</l>
<l>Well you might be deaf

</l>
<l>Or you might be dumb

</l>
<l>You'll get the answer

</l>
<l>When the answer comes



</l>
<l>Maybe it's just news on your television

</l>
<l>Or it might be God trying to get your attention

</l>
<l>It might be God trying to get your attention</l></lyrics></xml>
