<lyrics>



Well you might be saved

You might be reborn

You might own a car

With a big loud horn



Maybe it's just news

On your television

Or it might be God trying to get your attention



Are you an engineer

Working on a farm

Or a Casanova

With a whole lotta charme



It might be a mouse

Living in your kitchen

Or it might be God trying to get your attention



Well it might sound bad

Or it might sound good

Might be made of steel

Or it might be made of wood



Maybe it's just news

On your television

Or it might be God trying to get your attention



Well it might be in the church house

Or it might be on the street

Somehow or another

Every soul has got to meet



Well it might be in the city

Or it might be in town

One way or another

You're gonna find a higher ground



Well you might be deaf

Or you might be blind

She'll put the message

Right in your mind



Might look like a plan

Or a coalition

Or it might be God trying to get your attention



Well you might be deaf

Or you might be dumb

You'll get the answer

When the answer comes



Maybe it's just news on your television

Or it might be God trying to get your attention

It might be God trying to get your attention
