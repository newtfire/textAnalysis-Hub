<l>Hear that whistle it's ten o'clock

</l>
<l>(Don't let go, don't let go)

</l>
<l>C'mon baby it's time to rock

</l>
<l>(Don't let go, don't let go)

</l>
<l>I'm so happy I got you here

</l>
<l>(Don't let go, don't let go)

</l>
<l>Keeps me grinnin' from ear to ear

</l>
<l>(Don't let go, don't let go)



</l>
<l>Ooo-wee, um-um, this feelin's killin' me

</l>
<l>Aw shucks

</l>
<l>I wouldn't stop for a million bucks

</l>
<l>I love you so



</l>
<l>Just hold me tight an don't let go

</l>
<l>Thunder an' lightnin', wind an rain

</l>
<l>(Don't let go, don't let go)

</l>
<l>Love is storming inside my brain

</l>
<l>(Don't let go, don't let go)

</l>
<l>I'm so eager I'm nearly dying

</l>
<l>(Don't let go, don't let go)

</l>
<l>You've been keepin' your lips from mine

</l>
<l>(Don't let go, don't let go)



</l>
<l>Ooo-wee, um-um, this feelin's killin' me

</l>
<l>Aw shucks

</l>
<l>I wouldn't stop for a million bucks

</l>
<l>I love you so



</l>
<l>Just hold me tight an' don't let go

</l>
<l>Hound dog barkin' upside the hill

</l>
<l>(Don't let go, don't let go)

</l>
<l>Love is draggin' him through the mill

</l>
<l>(Don't let go, don't let go)

</l>
<l>If it wasn't for havin' you

</l>
<l>(Don't let go, don't let go)

</l>
<l>I'd be barkin' an howling too

</l>
<l>(Don't let go, don't let go)



</l>
<l>Ooo-wee, um-um, this feelin's killin' me

</l>
<l>Aw shucks, ha

</l>
<l>I wouldn't stop for a million bucks

</l>
<l>I love you so



</l>
<l>Just hold me tight an don't let go

</l>
<l>One day baby you'll quit me yet

</l>
<l>(Don't let go, don't let go)

</l>
<l>An' I'll be cryin' soakin' wet

</l>
<l>(Don't let go, don't let go)

</l>
<l>One thing babe, I'll never stand

</l>
<l>(Don't let go, don't let go)

</l>
<l>Your lips kissin' some other man

</l>
<l>(Don't let go, don't let go)



</l>
<l>Ooo-wee, um-um, this feelin's killin' me

</l>
<l>Aw shucks

</l>
<l>I wouldn't stop for a million bucks

</l>
<l>I love you so



</l>
<l>Just hold me tight an don't let go

</l>
<l>A hold me tight an don't let go

</l>
<l>Hold me tight an don't let go

</l>
<l>Fading:

</l>
<l>Just hold me, 'n don't let go

</l>
<l>Please hold me, don't let go</l></lyrics></xml>
