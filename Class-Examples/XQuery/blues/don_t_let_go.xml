<lyrics>



Hear that whistle it's ten o'clock

(Don't let go, don't let go)

C'mon baby it's time to rock

(Don't let go, don't let go)

I'm so happy I got you here

(Don't let go, don't let go)

Keeps me grinnin' from ear to ear

(Don't let go, don't let go)



Ooo-wee, um-um, this feelin's killin' me

Aw shucks

I wouldn't stop for a million bucks

I love you so



Just hold me tight an don't let go

Thunder an' lightnin', wind an rain

(Don't let go, don't let go)

Love is storming inside my brain

(Don't let go, don't let go)

I'm so eager I'm nearly dying

(Don't let go, don't let go)

You've been keepin' your lips from mine

(Don't let go, don't let go)



Ooo-wee, um-um, this feelin's killin' me

Aw shucks

I wouldn't stop for a million bucks

I love you so



Just hold me tight an' don't let go

Hound dog barkin' upside the hill

(Don't let go, don't let go)

Love is draggin' him through the mill

(Don't let go, don't let go)

If it wasn't for havin' you

(Don't let go, don't let go)

I'd be barkin' an howling too

(Don't let go, don't let go)



Ooo-wee, um-um, this feelin's killin' me

Aw shucks, ha

I wouldn't stop for a million bucks

I love you so



Just hold me tight an don't let go

One day baby you'll quit me yet

(Don't let go, don't let go)

An' I'll be cryin' soakin' wet

(Don't let go, don't let go)

One thing babe, I'll never stand

(Don't let go, don't let go)

Your lips kissin' some other man

(Don't let go, don't let go)



Ooo-wee, um-um, this feelin's killin' me

Aw shucks

I wouldn't stop for a million bucks

I love you so



Just hold me tight an don't let go

A hold me tight an don't let go

Hold me tight an don't let go

Fading:

Just hold me, 'n don't let go

Please hold me, don't let go
