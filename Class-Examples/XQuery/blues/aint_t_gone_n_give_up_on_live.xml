<lyrics>



I ain't gone 'n' give up on love,

love won't give up on me

I ain't gone 'n' give up on love,

love ain't gone 'n' give up on me

Every tear that I've cried,

only washed away the fear inside

Now I, I ain't gone 'n' give up on love



Every beat of my heart,

pounds with joy and not with pain

Every beat of my heart,

pounds with joy and not in vain

And although those are painful memories,

only brought me to my knees

I was just given up on love



Little Johnny Taylor told us so long ago

What about the midnight cryin',

wo that cheatin' and lyin'

What about the price that will,

oh surely be paid

Those that gave up on love,

love will have it's day

I ain't givin' up on love



I ain't gone 'n' give up on love,

love won't give up on me

I ain't gone 'n' give up on love,

love won't give up on me

Every time I cry, love just won't let me be,

won't set me free
