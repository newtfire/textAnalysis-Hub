<lyrics>


<l>I ain't gone 'n' give up on love,

</l>
<l>love won't give up on me

</l>
<l>I ain't gone 'n' give up on love,

</l>
<l>love ain't gone 'n' give up on me

</l>
<l>Every tear that I've cried,

</l>
<l>only washed away the fear inside

</l>
<l>Now I, I ain't gone 'n' give up on love



</l>
<l>Every beat of my heart,

</l>
<l>pounds with joy and not with pain

</l>
<l>Every beat of my heart,

</l>
<l>pounds with joy and not in vain

</l>
<l>And although those are painful memories,

</l>
<l>only brought me to my knees

</l>
<l>I was just given up on love



</l>
<l>Little Johnny Taylor told us so long ago

</l>
<l>What about the midnight cryin',

</l>
<l>wo that cheatin' and lyin'

</l>
<l>What about the price that will,

</l>
<l>oh surely be paid

</l>
<l>Those that gave up on love,

</l>
<l>love will have it's day

</l>
<l>I ain't givin' up on love



</l>
<l>I ain't gone 'n' give up on love,

</l>
<l>love won't give up on me

</l>
<l>I ain't gone 'n' give up on love,

</l>
<l>love won't give up on me

</l>
<l>Every time I cry, love just won't let me be,

</l>
<l>won't set me free</l></lyrics></xml>
