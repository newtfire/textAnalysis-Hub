<lyrics>


<l>Went to a party on Saturday night

</l>
<l>Lookin real cool and dressed just right

</l>
<l>Saved my money every week

</l>
<l>Just could not spend it on those fine chicks

</l>
<l>(Got) Gotta my car and (walked) in the door

</l>
<l>You know (just) what I was lookin' for



</l>
<l>Look at that blonde in the redskin tights

</l>
<l>Don't go with her she's the one that bites

</l>
<l>A fine, fine thing in a short short skirt

</l>
<l>She ain't attached and she likes to flirt

</l>
<l>A whole lotta woman is where it's at

</l>
<l>Hey now boys will you just look at that



</l>
<l>I don't know which way to turn

</l>
<l>Every way I look my eyeballs burn

</l>
<l>Short gals, tall gals skinny and fat

</l>
<l>Look at that, look at that, look at that, look at that



</l>
<l>See them twins in fishnet hose

</l>
<l>I'll take either one or both of those

</l>
<l>Sally over there still long and lean

</l>
<l>She's got the key to my lovin' machine

</l>
<l>All these girls are lookin' just right

</l>
<l>At a hip-shakin' party on a Saturday night</l></lyrics></xml>
