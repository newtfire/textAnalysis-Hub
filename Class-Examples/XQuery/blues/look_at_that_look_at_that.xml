<lyrics>



Went to a party on Saturday night

Lookin real cool and dressed just right

Saved my money every week

Just could not spend it on those fine chicks

(Got) Gotta my car and (walked) in the door

You know (just) what I was lookin' for



Look at that blonde in the redskin tights

Don't go with her she's the one that bites

A fine, fine thing in a short short skirt

She ain't attached and she likes to flirt

A whole lotta woman is where it's at

Hey now boys will you just look at that



I don't know which way to turn

Every way I look my eyeballs burn

Short gals, tall gals skinny and fat

Look at that, look at that, look at that, look at that



See them twins in fishnet hose

I'll take either one or both of those

Sally over there still long and lean

She's got the key to my lovin' machine

All these girls are lookin' just right

At a hip-shakin' party on a Saturday night
