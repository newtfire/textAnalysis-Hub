<lyrics>


<l>Well you've heard about love givin' sight to the blind

</l>
<l>My baby's lovin' cause the sun to shine

</l>
<l>She's my sweet little thing, she's my pride and joy

</l>
<l>She's my sweet little baby, I'm her little lover boy



</l>
<l>Yeah I love my baby, heart and soul

</l>
<l>Love like ours won't never grow old

</l>
<l>She's my sweet little thing, she's my pride and joy

</l>
<l>She's my sweet little baby, I'm her little lover boy



</l>
<l>Yeah, I love my lady, she's long and lean

</l>
<l>You mess with her, you'll see a man get mean

</l>
<l>She's my sweet little thing, she's my pride and joy

</l>
<l>She's my sweet little baby, I'm her little lover boy



</l>
<l>Well I love my baby, like the finest wine

</l>
<l>Stick with her until the end of time

</l>
<l>She's my sweet little thing, she's my pride and joy

</l>
<l>She's my sweet little baby, I'm her little lover boy



</l>
<l>Yeah I love my baby, heart and soul

</l>
<l>Love like ours won't never grow old

</l>
<l>She's my sweet little thing, she's my pride and joy

</l>
<l>She's my sweet little baby, I'm her little lover boy</l></lyrics></xml>
