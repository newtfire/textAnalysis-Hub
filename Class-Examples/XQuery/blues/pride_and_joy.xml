<lyrics>



Well you've heard about love givin' sight to the blind

My baby's lovin' cause the sun to shine

She's my sweet little thing, she's my pride and joy

She's my sweet little baby, I'm her little lover boy



Yeah I love my baby, heart and soul

Love like ours won't never grow old

She's my sweet little thing, she's my pride and joy

She's my sweet little baby, I'm her little lover boy



Yeah, I love my lady, she's long and lean

You mess with her, you'll see a man get mean

She's my sweet little thing, she's my pride and joy

She's my sweet little baby, I'm her little lover boy



Well I love my baby, like the finest wine

Stick with her until the end of time

She's my sweet little thing, she's my pride and joy

She's my sweet little baby, I'm her little lover boy



Yeah I love my baby, heart and soul

Love like ours won't never grow old

She's my sweet little thing, she's my pride and joy

She's my sweet little baby, I'm her little lover boy
