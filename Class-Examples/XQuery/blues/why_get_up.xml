<l>Why get up, why get up

</l>
<l>How can I get up, why should I get up

</l>
<l>This whole world's gone crazy

</l>
<l>Think I've seen enough

</l>
<l>I'm gonna sleep forever why get up



</l>
<l>Phone keeps ringing right off the hook

</l>
<l>Some bill collector, I know what cooks

</l>
<l>Think I'll stay in bed, dream all day

</l>
<l>World outside bugs me anyway

</l>
<l>When I get things going, the going gets rough

</l>
<l>So I ask myself why get up



</l>
<l>Chorus



</l>
<l>Went to the doctor, he said lose some weight

</l>
<l>If you don't do it quick, we'll have to operate

</l>
<l>I talked to my lawyer, he said case is closed

</l>
<l>That woman got it all even the garden hose

</l>
<l>Staring at the ceiling thinking just my luck

</l>
<l>Better roll back over why get up



</l>
<l>Chorus



</l>
<l>Well I can't quit drinking, I'm nervous all the time

</l>
<l>When I wake up, it's like a ton lead on my mind

</l>
<l>What was it, I said to that girl last night

</l>
<l>She really got upset, I best stay out of sight

</l>
<l>I remember a gun and calling somebody's bluff

</l>
<l>I better duck under the cover why get up



</l>
<l>Chorus



</l>
