<lyrics>



Why get up, why get up

How can I get up, why should I get up

This whole world's gone crazy

Think I've seen enough

I'm gonna sleep forever why get up



Phone keeps ringing right off the hook

Some bill collector, I know what cooks

Think I'll stay in bed, dream all day

World outside bugs me anyway

When I get things going, the going gets rough

So I ask myself why get up



Chorus



Went to the doctor, he said lose some weight

If you don't do it quick, we'll have to operate

I talked to my lawyer, he said case is closed

That woman got it all even the garden hose

Staring at the ceiling thinking just my luck

Better roll back over why get up



Chorus



Well I can't quit drinking, I'm nervous all the time

When I wake up, it's like a ton lead on my mind

What was it, I said to that girl last night

She really got upset, I best stay out of sight

I remember a gun and calling somebody's bluff

I better duck under the cover why get up



Chorus
