<l>Two kind of people I just can't stand

</l>
<l>That's an evil-hearted woman and a lyin' man

</l>
<l>Don't you lie to me

</l>
<l>No don't you lie to me

</l>
<l>Because it make me mad

</l>
<l>I get evil as a man can be



</l>
<l>You told me that you loved me a long time ago

</l>
<l>The fellow that you got you don't want him no more

</l>
<l>Don't you lie to me, ha ha

</l>
<l>No don't you lie to me

</l>
<l>Because it makes me mad girl

</l>
<l>I get evil as a man can be

</l>
<l>Whoo



</l>
<l>You know you been thinking when you sat down on my knee

</l>
<l>You were fooling that moonshine tryin' to 
jive

</l>
<l>poor me

</l>
<l>Don't you lie to me

</l>
<l>No babe don't you lie to me

</l>
<l>Because it make me mad girl
