<lyrics>



Two kind of people I just can't stand

That's an evil-hearted woman and a lyin' man

Don't you lie to me

No don't you lie to me

Because it make me mad

I get evil as a man can be



You told me that you loved me a long time ago

The fellow that you got you don't want him no more

Don't you lie to me, ha ha

No don't you lie to me

Because it makes me mad girl

I get evil as a man can be

Whoo



You know you been thinking when you sat down on my knee

You were fooling that moonshine tryin' to 
jive

poor me

Don't you lie to me

No babe don't you lie to me

Because it make me mad girl

I get evil as a man can be



Now don't you lie to me, yeah

Babe don't lie to me, no

Aw don't you lie to me, girl

I said don't lie to me, no

Because it make me mad

I get evil as a man can be

Whoo, come on, well all right
