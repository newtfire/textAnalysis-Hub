<lyrics>


<l>Days into weeks

</l>
<l>Weeks into months

</l>
<l>Months into years I'm blue

</l>
<l>I'm cracking up over you



</l>
<l>I can't survive

</l>
<l>I need you here by my side

</l>
<l>Ever word I say is true

</l>
<l>I'm cracking up over you



</l>
<l>When I can see you again

</l>
<l>Don't know just when that will be

</l>
<l>But baby, just look

</l>
<l>Can't you see what you're doin' to me?



</l>
<l>Why do you, why do you torture me?

</l>
<l>Never give me a smile

</l>
<l>That brings tears from my eyes

</l>
<l>I'm cracking up over you



</l>
<l>My heart suffers, suffers pain

</l>
<l>Nothin' seems to be the same

</l>
<l>But with you baby, I'll suffer again

</l>
<l>I'm cracking up over you</l></lyrics></xml>
