<lyrics>



Every night I wander all by myself

Every night I wander all by myself

Thinkin' about the woman I love, lovin' someone else



Boo-hoo, I just can't keep from cryin'

Boo-hoo, I just can't keep from cryin'

I'm worried about my baby, she's on my mind



Sometimes I wonder, do she think of me?

Sometimes I wonder, do she think of me?

And again I wonder, if I will ever be free



I'm tellin' all you women, what's on my mind

I'm tellin' all you women, what's on my mind

I never love one woman, no more at a time



Boo-hoo, I wring my hands and cry

Boo-hoo, I wring my hands and cry

I'm thinking about the lovin', that I let go by



Since you've been gone baby, I haven't been a bit of good

Since you've been gone baby, I haven't been a bit of good

Because I never get the loving, that I really should
