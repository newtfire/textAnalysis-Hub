<lyrics>


<l>Every night I wander all by myself

</l>
<l>Every night I wander all by myself

</l>
<l>Thinkin' about the woman I love, lovin' someone else



</l>
<l>Boo-hoo, I just can't keep from cryin'

</l>
<l>Boo-hoo, I just can't keep from cryin'

</l>
<l>I'm worried about my baby, she's on my mind



</l>
<l>Sometimes I wonder, do she think of me?

</l>
<l>Sometimes I wonder, do she think of me?

</l>
<l>And again I wonder, if I will ever be free



</l>
<l>I'm tellin' all you women, what's on my mind

</l>
<l>I'm tellin' all you women, what's on my mind

</l>
<l>I never love one woman, no more at a time



</l>
<l>Boo-hoo, I wring my hands and cry

</l>
<l>Boo-hoo, I wring my hands and cry

</l>
<l>I'm thinking about the lovin', that I let go by



</l>
<l>Since you've been gone baby, I haven't been a bit of good

</l>
<l>Since you've been gone baby, I haven't been a bit of good

</l>
<l>Because I never get the loving, that I really should</l></lyrics></xml>
