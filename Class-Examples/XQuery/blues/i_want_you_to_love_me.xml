<l>I want you to love me, love your baby slow

</l>
<l>I want you to love me, love you baby slow

</l>
<l>I want you to love me baby, till I drop dead from your love



</l>
<l>I want you to love me, love with your own free will

</l>
<l>I want you to love me, love with your own free will

</l>
<l>I want you to love me baby, love me and don't give killed



</l>
<l>I want you to love me, till the house stand on my head

</l>
<l>I want you to love me, till the house stand on my head

</l>
<l>I want you to love me baby, till you know I wish that I was dead</l></lyrics></xml>
