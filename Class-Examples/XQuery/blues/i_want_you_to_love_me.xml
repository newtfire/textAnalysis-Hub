<lyrics>



I want you to love me, love your baby slow

I want you to love me, love you baby slow

I want you to love me baby, till I drop dead from your love



I want you to love me, love with your own free will

I want you to love me, love with your own free will

I want you to love me baby, love me and don't give killed



I want you to love me, till the house stand on my head

I want you to love me, till the house stand on my head

I want you to love me baby, till you know I wish that I was dead
