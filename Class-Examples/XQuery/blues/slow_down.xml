<lyrics>



When I was a young boy

Well they tried to tell me

That I was movin'

Movin' way too fast

And I knew everything

About everything

But I really didn't wanna listen

To a bunch of old folks talkin' trash



So I got out on the highway

Pedal to the floor

Smokin' and drinkin'

And a whole lot more

But when they came to collect me

Out of that jail

They said boy next time

You get no bail



(Chorus:)

You better slow down

You better slow down



Woke up one mornin'

Ooh to a hunger

I moaned

And I began to twitch

Felt the need

For some lovin'

A little sweet somebody

To scratch my itch

Momma said I don't mean to pry

But I'm here to advise you

Seeds like to grow

When you put 'em in fertilizer



(Chorus)



Doin' my own thing

I'm all grown up

Yes I am

Little bit older

But I feel like a young buck

I'm ridin' down the highway

In a brand new mini van

Wife and kids screamin'

Ooh God I'm a family man

I'm outta mind

Losin control

I could leave tomorrow

But there ain't nowhere to go



(Chorus)
