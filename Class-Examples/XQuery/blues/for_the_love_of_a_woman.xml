<lyrics>


<l>One, two, three, four!



</l>
<l>For the love of a woman

</l>
<l>A man will do most anything

</l>
<l>For a love of a woman

</l>
<l>A man will do most anything

</l>
<l>Make him steal from his mother

</l>
<l>Just to buy her a diamond ring



</l>
<l>Well I love you, baby

</l>
<l>Like a schoolboy love his pie

</l>
<l>Well I love you, baby

</l>
<l>Like a schoolboy love his pie

</l>
<l>Well I love you so much, darlin'

</l>
<l>You make me wanna cheat an' lie



</l>
<l>I've been lovin' you, baby

</l>
<l>Ever since I don't know when

</l>
<l>I've been lovin' you, baby

</l>
<l>Ever since I don't know when

</l>
<l>Oh, I love ya so much, darlin', yeah

</l>
<l>That I'm comin' right back again

</l>
<l>Come on!</l></lyrics></xml>
