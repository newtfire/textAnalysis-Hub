<lyrics>



One, two, three, four!



For the love of a woman

A man will do most anything

For a love of a woman

A man will do most anything

Make him steal from his mother

Just to buy her a diamond ring



Well I love you, baby

Like a schoolboy love his pie

Well I love you, baby

Like a schoolboy love his pie

Well I love you so much, darlin'

You make me wanna cheat an' lie



I've been lovin' you, baby

Ever since I don't know when

I've been lovin' you, baby

Ever since I don't know when

Oh, I love ya so much, darlin', yeah

That I'm comin' right back again

Come on!
