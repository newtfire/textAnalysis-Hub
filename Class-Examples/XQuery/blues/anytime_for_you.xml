<lyrics>



I trusted in you, right from the start

You messed around until you broke my heart

Anytime for you, and all the time for me

Someday you're gonna be sorry, the way you treated me



You leave me in the mornin', come home late at night

Well, have a nerve to tell 'em, that you treated me right

Anytime for you and all the time for me

Babe, you're gonna be sorry, the way you treated me



You is a liar and a cheater, too

The things you do to me, is coming home to you

Anytime for you, and all the time for me

You gonna be sorry, the way you treated me



Pick 'em boy, pick 'em!



Pack up your clothes an' get out of my flat

And let my doorknob hit you in your back

Anytime for you, and all the time for me

You gonna be sorry, the way you treated me
