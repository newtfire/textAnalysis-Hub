<lyrics>



Yeah I'm so sorry,

I got to leave my woman alone

Yeah I'm so sorry,

I got to leave my woman alone

Well you know she got a crosseyed cat,

livin' without that man in her home



Every time I start to see this woman,

he's in the corner growlin' or layin' down

Every time I start to see this woman,

he's in the corner growlin' or layin' down

Yeah, you know he's too big to be a house cat,

and he's too small to be a lion

There's somethin' wrong



Yeah, I stop by my baby's house,

he start jumpin' from wall to wall

Yeah, I stop by my baby's house,

he start jumpin' from wall to wall

Then he's lookin' crosseyed at me,

sit back in the corner and licked his paw



Yeah, my woman got a crosseyed cat,

livin' there with her in her home

Yeah, my woman got a crosseyed cat,

livin' there with her in her home

You know I try so hard to do her right,

but it seem like everything I do is wrong
