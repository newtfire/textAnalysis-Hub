<lyrics>


<l>Yeah I'm so sorry,

</l>
<l>I got to leave my woman alone

</l>
<l>Yeah I'm so sorry,

</l>
<l>I got to leave my woman alone

</l>
<l>Well you know she got a crosseyed cat,

</l>
<l>livin' without that man in her home



</l>
<l>Every time I start to see this woman,

</l>
<l>he's in the corner growlin' or layin' down

</l>
<l>Every time I start to see this woman,

</l>
<l>he's in the corner growlin' or layin' down

</l>
<l>Yeah, you know he's too big to be a house cat,

</l>
<l>and he's too small to be a lion

</l>
<l>There's somethin' wrong



</l>
<l>Yeah, I stop by my baby's house,

</l>
<l>he start jumpin' from wall to wall

</l>
<l>Yeah, I stop by my baby's house,

</l>
<l>he start jumpin' from wall to wall

</l>
<l>Then he's lookin' crosseyed at me,

</l>
<l>sit back in the corner and licked his paw



</l>
<l>Yeah, my woman got a crosseyed cat,

</l>
<l>livin' there with her in her home

</l>
<l>Yeah, my woman got a crosseyed cat,

</l>
<l>livin' there with her in her home

</l>
<l>You know I try so hard to do her right,

</l>
<l>but it seem like everything I do is wrong</l></lyrics></xml>
