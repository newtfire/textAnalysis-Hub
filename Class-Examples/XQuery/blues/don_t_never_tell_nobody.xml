<l>Sadie Brown and Linda Lee

</l>
<l>Were as good a pair as could be

</l>
<l>Till Sadie tried a brand new man

</l>
<l>Start telling 'bout his good quality

</l>
<l>How he could love, pet and tease

</l>
<l>How the things he did would please

</l>
<l>One night her good man give her the air

</l>
<l>Sadie cried out loud right then and there



</l>
<l>Don't never tell nobody what your perfect good man can do

</l>
<l>You just get them anxious to try some of his good points too

</l>
<l>If he's nice and sweet and hard to beat

</l>
<l>Don't tell your bestest friend

</l>
<l>They'll never rest without a test

</l>
<l>You know that there is always better than best

</l>
<l>He may really try to be good and true

</l>
<l>But if you want to keep him it is up to you

</l>
<l>Do never tell nobody what your perfect good man can do</l></lyrics></xml>
