<lyrics>



Sadie Brown and Linda Lee

Were as good a pair as could be

Till Sadie tried a brand new man

Start telling 'bout his good quality

How he could love, pet and tease

How the things he did would please

One night her good man give her the air

Sadie cried out loud right then and there



Don't never tell nobody what your perfect good man can do

You just get them anxious to try some of his good points too

If he's nice and sweet and hard to beat

Don't tell your bestest friend

They'll never rest without a test

You know that there is always better than best

He may really try to be good and true

But if you want to keep him it is up to you

Do never tell nobody what your perfect good man can do
