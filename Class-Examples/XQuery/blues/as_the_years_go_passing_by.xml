<lyrics>


<l>There is nothing I can do, as you leave me here to cry

</l>
<l>There is nothing I can do, as you leave me here to cry

</l>
<l>You know my love will follow you, as the years go passing by



</l>
<l>Give you all that I own, that's one thing you can't deny

</l>
<l>Give you all that I own, that's one thing you can't deny

</l>
<l>You know my love will follow you, as the years go passing by



</l>
<l>Gonna leave it up to you, so long, so long, goodbye

</l>
<l>Gonna leave it up to you, so long, so long, goodbye

</l>
<l>You know my love will follow you, as the years go passing by



</l>
<l>Gonna leave it up to you, so long, so long, goodbye

</l>
<l>Gonna leave it up to you, so long, so long, goodbye

</l>
<l>You know my love will follow you, as the years go passing</l></lyrics></xml>
