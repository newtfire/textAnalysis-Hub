<lyrics>



There is nothing I can do, as you leave me here to cry

There is nothing I can do, as you leave me here to cry

You know my love will follow you, as the years go passing by



Give you all that I own, that's one thing you can't deny

Give you all that I own, that's one thing you can't deny

You know my love will follow you, as the years go passing by



Gonna leave it up to you, so long, so long, goodbye

Gonna leave it up to you, so long, so long, goodbye

You know my love will follow you, as the years go passing by



Gonna leave it up to you, so long, so long, goodbye

Gonna leave it up to you, so long, so long, goodbye

You know my love will follow you, as the years go passing
