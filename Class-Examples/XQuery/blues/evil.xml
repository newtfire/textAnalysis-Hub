<lyrics>



If you're a long way from home, can't sleep at night

Grab your telephone, something just ain't right

That's evil, evil is goin' on wrong

I am warnin' ya brother, you better watch your happy home



Well, long way from home and, can't sleep at all

You know another mule is, kickin' in your stall

That's evil, evil is goin' on wrong

I am warnin' ya brother, you better watch your happy home



(spoken: You better catch him, 'cause somethin's wrong, in your
home)



Well, if ya call her on the telephone, and she answers awful slow

Grab the first train smokin', if you have to 
hobo

That's evil, evil is goin' on wrong

I am warnin' ya brother, you better watch your happy home



If you make it to your house, knock on the front door

Run around to the back, you'll catch him, just before he go

That's evil, evil is goin' on

I am warnin' ya brother, you better watch your happy home
