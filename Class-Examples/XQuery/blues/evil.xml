<lyrics>


<l>If you're a long way from home, can't sleep at night

</l>
<l>Grab your telephone, something just ain't right

</l>
<l>That's evil, evil is goin' on wrong

</l>
<l>I am warnin' ya brother, you better watch your happy home



</l>
<l>Well, long way from home and, can't sleep at all

</l>
<l>You know another mule is, kickin' in your stall

</l>
<l>That's evil, evil is goin' on wrong

</l>
<l>I am warnin' ya brother, you better watch your happy home



</l>
<l>(spoken: You better catch him, 'cause somethin's wrong, in your

home)




</l>
<l>Well, if ya call her on the telephone, and she answers awful slow

</l>
<l>Grab the first train smokin', if you have to 
hobo

</l>
<l>That's evil, evil is goin' on wrong

</l>
<l>I am warnin' ya brother, you better watch your happy home



</l>
<l>If you make it to your house, knock on the front door

</l>
<l>Run around to the back, you'll catch him, just before he go

</l>
<l>That's evil, evil is goin' on

</l>
<l>I am warnin' ya brother, you better watch your happy home</l></lyrics></xml>
