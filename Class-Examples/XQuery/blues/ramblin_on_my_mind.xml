<lyrics>



I got rambling, I got rambling all on my mind

I got rambling, I got rambling all on my mind

Is to leave my baby, 'cause she treat me so unkind



I'm going down to the station, catch that old first mail train I
see

I'm going down to the station, catch that old first mail train I
see

I got the blues 'bout miss so-and-so, and her son's got the blues
about me



I got mean things, I got mean things all on my mind

Lil girl, lil girl, I got mean things all on my mind

Is to leave my baby, 'cause she treat me so unkind
