<lyrics>



Well now, that clover man way up in Dundee

Well now, that clover man way up in Dundee

Well now, you go down to Mr. Howard Stovall's place, he's got all the
burr clover you need



Well now, the reason that I love that old burr clover farm so
well

Well now, the reason that I love that old burr clover farm so
well

Well now, we always have money and we never raise no hell



Well now, I'm leaving this morning, and I sure do hate to go

Well now, I'm leaving this morning, and I sure do hate to go

Well now, I've got to leave this burr clover farm, I ain't coming
back no more



Now, good bye everybody and I may not coming back again

Now, good bye everybody and I may not coming back again

Well now, I've got to leave this burr clover farm, my baby don't want
me around



Well, so long, so long, you gonna need my help, I say

Well, so long, so long, you gonna need my help, I say

Well now, I here do wanna sell you some burr clover, honey, just
before I go away
