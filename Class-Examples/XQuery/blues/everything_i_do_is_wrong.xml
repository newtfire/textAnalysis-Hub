<lyrics>



Well, I can't get along no matter what I do

Well, we can't get along no matter what I do

Yes, everything I do is wrong, no matter what I do



Well, let's make it up baby, try it just one more time

Well, let's make it up baby, try it just one more time

Well, if we don't get together baby, won't be no fault of mine



Lay it down

Alright then



Well, it's been a long time baby, but it's all over now

Oh, it's been a long time baby, but it's all over now

We can't get together, baby, you were no good no how
