<lyrics>


<l>I keep drinking malted milk, tryin' to drown my blues away
I keep drinking malted milk babe, tryin' to drown my blues away
Your as welcome to my lovin' babe, as a flower in the month of May

</l>
<l>Well baby fix me one more drink, hug your daddy one more time
Come on fix me one more drink, yeah, hug your daddy one more time
Come on fix me that malted milk, until I, till I change my mind

</l>
<l>Well my door lock keep on turnin', I think there're spooks round my bed
Well my door lock keep on turnin', I think there're spooks round my bed
I got a warmer feeling that, the hairs are standing on my bed

</l>
<l>Malted milk, malted milk, keep on rushing to my head
Malted milk, malted milk, babe, keep on rushing to my head

</l>
<l>I got a funny funny feeling, that I'm talkin' all out my head
I got a funny funny feeling, that I'm talkin' all out my head

</l>
