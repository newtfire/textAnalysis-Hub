<lyrics>


<l>You made me weep, and you made me moan

</l>
<l>When you call me to leave my, my happy home

</l>
<l>But someday, you ain't gonna worry my life anymore



</l>
<l>You told everybody, in your neighborhood,

</l>
<l>what a dirty mistreater, didn't mean you no good

</l>
<l>But someday, you ain't gonna worry my life anymore



</l>
<l>When I had money, I had plenty friends

</l>
<l>I ain't got no money, baby, honey even no friends

</l>
<l>But someday, you ain't gonna worry my life anymore



</l>
<l>If I had money, like Henry Ford

</l>
<l>I'd have me a woman on, on every road

</l>
<l>But bye bye, you ain't gonna worry my life anymore</l></lyrics></xml>
