<lyrics>



You made me weep, and you made me moan

When you call me to leave my, my happy home

But someday, you ain't gonna worry my life anymore



You told everybody, in your neighborhood,

what a dirty mistreater, didn't mean you no good

But someday, you ain't gonna worry my life anymore



When I had money, I had plenty friends

I ain't got no money, baby, honey even no friends

But someday, you ain't gonna worry my life anymore



If I had money, like Henry Ford

I'd have me a woman on, on every road

But bye bye, you ain't gonna worry my life anymore
