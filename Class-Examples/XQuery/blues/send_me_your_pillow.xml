<lyrics>



Send me your pillow baby, that you been cryin' on

Please send me your pillow baby, that you been cryin' on

I have nothing left of you baby, just your memories



I wanna let you know baby, I'm lonely just like you

I wanna let you know baby, oh, I'm lonely just like you

And that's why I want you, to mail me your pillow baby

Mail, mail me your pillow baby, you been cryin' on



You won't call me, and neither send me, send me no telegram

Oha, oha, you won't call me, baby, and neither, and neither send me
no telegram

Just watching you baby, please send me your pillow baby, that you
been cryin' on baby

I just wanna let you know baby, I still think of you, oh yeah, oh
yeah

I been cryin' baby

My nights been so lonely

Oh yeah, that's why I'm begging you baby

Please send me your pillow baby

Please send me your pillow baby,

you been cryin' on,

you been cryin' on
