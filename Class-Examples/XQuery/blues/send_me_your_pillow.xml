<l>Send me your pillow baby, that you been cryin' on

</l>
<l>Please send me your pillow baby, that you been cryin' on

</l>
<l>I have nothing left of you baby, just your memories



</l>
<l>I wanna let you know baby, I'm lonely just like you

</l>
<l>I wanna let you know baby, oh, I'm lonely just like you

</l>
<l>And that's why I want you, to mail me your pillow baby

</l>
<l>Mail, mail me your pillow baby, you been cryin' on



</l>
<l>You won't call me, and neither send me, send me no telegram

</l>
<l>Oha, oha, you won't call me, baby, and neither, and neither send me
no telegram

</l>
<l>Just watching you baby, please send me your pillow baby, that you
been cryin' on baby

</l>
<l>I just wanna let you know baby, I still think of you, oh yeah, oh

</l>

</l>
<l>Oh yeah, that's why I'm begging you baby
