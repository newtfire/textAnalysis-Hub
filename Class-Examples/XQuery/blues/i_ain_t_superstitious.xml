<lyrics>


<l>Well, I ain't superstitious, black cat just cross my trail

</l>
<l>Well, I ain't superstitious, oh the black cat just cross my trail

</l>
<l>Don't sweep me with no broom, I might get put in jail



</l>
<l>When my right hand itches, I gets money for sure

</l>
<l>When my right hand itches, I gets money for sure

</l>
<l>But, when my left eye jumps, somebody's got to go



</l>
<l>Well, I ain't superstitious, black cat just cross my trail

</l>
<l>Well, I ain't superstitious, black cat just cross my trail

</l>
<l>Don't sweep me with no broom, I just might get put in jail



</l>
<l>Well, the dogs are howlin, all over the neighborhood

</l>
<l>Whoa, the dogs are howlin, all over the neighborhood

</l>
<l>That is true sign of death, baby, that ain't no good



</l>
<l>Well, I'm not superstitious, blow that black cat across my trail

</l>
<l>Well, I'm not superstitious, a black cat across my trail

</l>
<l>Don't sweep me with no broom, I just might get put in jail

</l><l>That's bad luck for me</l></lyrics></xml>
