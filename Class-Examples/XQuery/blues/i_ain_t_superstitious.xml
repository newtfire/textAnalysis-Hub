<lyrics>



Well, I ain't superstitious, black cat just cross my trail

Well, I ain't superstitious, oh the black cat just cross my trail

Don't sweep me with no broom, I might get put in jail



When my right hand itches, I gets money for sure

When my right hand itches, I gets money for sure

But, when my left eye jumps, somebody's got to go



Well, I ain't superstitious, black cat just cross my trail

Well, I ain't superstitious, black cat just cross my trail

Don't sweep me with no broom, I just might get put in jail



Well, the dogs are howlin, all over the neighborhood

Whoa, the dogs are howlin, all over the neighborhood

That is true sign of death, baby, that ain't no good



Well, I'm not superstitious, blow that black cat across my trail

Well, I'm not superstitious, a black cat across my trail

Don't sweep me with no broom, I just might get put in jail

That's bad luck for me
