<lyrics>


<l>(Bo Diddley):

</l>
<l>Well, every day I work, bringing home my pay

</l>
<l>Come to find out baby, you've been giving my money away



</l>
<l>Tell me baby, what you tryin' to do?

</l>
<l>You ain't seen me hummin', like you used to do



</l>
<l>Tell me mama, what's wrong with you?

</l>
<l>You know pretty baby, I'm so crazy 'bout you



</l>
<l>(Jerome Green):

</l>
<l>All you pretty women, bring it to my home

</l>
<l>You don't have to worry, I won't do you no wrong



</l>
<l>Bring it on home, bring it to Jerome

</l>
<l>Bring it on home, bring it to Jerome



</l>
<l>Look here pretty baby, this mess I won't stand

</l>
<l>All the other women, say you got another man



</l>
<l>Bring it on home, bring it to Jerome

</l>
<l>Bring it on home, bring it to Jerome</l></lyrics></xml>
