<lyrics>



(Bo Diddley):

Well, every day I work, bringing home my pay

Come to find out baby, you've been giving my money away



Tell me baby, what you tryin' to do?

You ain't seen me hummin', like you used to do



Tell me mama, what's wrong with you?

You know pretty baby, I'm so crazy 'bout you



(Jerome Green):

All you pretty women, bring it to my home

You don't have to worry, I won't do you no wrong



Bring it on home, bring it to Jerome

Bring it on home, bring it to Jerome



Look here pretty baby, this mess I won't stand

All the other women, say you got another man



Bring it on home, bring it to Jerome

Bring it on home, bring it to Jerome
