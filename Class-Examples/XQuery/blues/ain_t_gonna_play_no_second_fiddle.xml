<lyrics>



Let me tell you daddy,

momma ain't gonna sit here and grieve

Pack up your stuff and get ready to leave



I stood your foolishness long enough,

so now I'm gonna call your bluff

Oh, I'm gonna call your hand,

so, now daddy here's my plan



Ain't gonna play no second fiddle 'cause,

I'm used to playin' lead



You must think that I am blind,

you've been cheatin' me all the time

Whoa yeah, you still flirt

And you'll notice I ain't hurt,

to see you with my chum

Do you think that I am dumb



You 'cause me to drink,

when I sit down and think

And notice that you never take heed

I went to your house the other night,

caught you and your good girl havin' a fight



Ain't gonna play no second fiddle 'cause

I'm used to playin lead



Caught you with your good-time tramp
1
,

so, now I'm gonna put out your lamp

Oh, poppa, I ain't sore

You ain't gonna mess up with me no more

I'm gonna flirt with another guy
2
,

then you're gonna hang your head an' cry
2



Ain't gonna play no second fiddle 'cause

I'm used to playin' lead
