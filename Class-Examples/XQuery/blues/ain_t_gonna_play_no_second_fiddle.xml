<lyrics>

<l>Let me tell you daddy,

</l>
<l>momma ain't gonna sit here and grieve

</l>
<l>Pack up your stuff and get ready to leave



</l>
<l>I stood your foolishness long enough,

</l>
<l>so now I'm gonna call your bluff

</l>
<l>Oh, I'm gonna call your hand,

</l>
<l>so, now daddy here's my plan



</l>
<l>Ain't gonna play no second fiddle 'cause,

</l>
<l>I'm used to playin' lead



</l>
<l>You must think that I am blind,

</l>
<l>you've been cheatin' me all the time

</l>
<l>Whoa yeah, you still flirt

</l>
<l>And you'll notice I ain't hurt,

</l>
<l>to see you with my chum

</l>
<l>Do you think that I am dumb



</l>
<l>You 'cause me to drink,

</l>
<l>when I sit down and think

</l>
<l>And notice that you never take heed

</l>
<l>I went to your house the other night,

</l>
<l>caught you and your good girl havin' a fight



</l>
<l>Ain't gonna play no second fiddle 'cause

</l>
<l>I'm used to playin lead



</l>
<l>Caught you with your good-time tramp
1
,

</l>
<l>so, now I'm gonna put out your lamp

</l>
<l>Oh, poppa, I ain't sore

</l>
<l>You ain't gonna mess up with me no more

</l>
<l>I'm gonna flirt with another guy
2
,

</l>
<l>then you're gonna hang your head an' cry
2



</l>
<l>Ain't gonna play no second fiddle 'cause

</l>
<l>I'm used to playin' lead
