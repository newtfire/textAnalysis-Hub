<lyrics>



Oh you come home one eve'nin'

To nothin' but the four walls

And then ya find your phone been disconnected

You can't even make no call

Ya hung out for your baby, oh, an'she's not there

You look in the closet, buddy, an'you find it's all bare



Oh, that's what the blues is people

That's what the blues is all about

Well that's a hard pill to have to swallow, um!

When you find what the blues is all about



Now listen to this:



I went out to my backyard

Ya know I whistled for my dog [3 whistle sounds]

He ran up under the house, people

Like he didn't even know me at all

Now I hadn't fed him in two or three days

An' he was lookin' kinda thin

Oh, when your dog turn his back on ya, buddy

You know ya haven't even got a friend



That's the blues, people

That's what the blues is all about

Oh it's a hard pill to swallow, um!

When ya find out what the blues is all about



Oh, look out!

Uh!

Oh no!

I think I got 'em!



I went out to my mail box

I got a bunch-a bills that I can't pay

I guess my wife been out shoppin' again

While I been at work all day



I see the man comin' with his tools

Now is he gonna cut off my water?

You know they got my gas yesterday

An' they comin' right back for the lines tomorrow



Ah, that's what the blues is people

That's what the blues is all about

Well that's a hard pill to swallow, buddy

Oh, when you find out what the blues is all about
