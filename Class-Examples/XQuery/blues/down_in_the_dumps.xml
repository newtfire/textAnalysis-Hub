<lyrics>


<l>My man's got somethin', he gives me such a thrill</l>

<l>Every time he smiles at me, can't keep my body still</l>

<l>I done cried so much, look like I've got the mumps</l>


<l>I can't keep from worryin' 'cause I'm down in the
dumps
2</l>



<l>I had a nightmare last night, when I laid down</l>

<l>When I woke up this mornin', my sweet man couldn't be found</l>

<l>I'm goin' down to the river, into it I'm goin' to jump</l>

<l>Can't keep from worryin' 'cause I'm down in the dumps</l>



<l>Someone knocked on my door last night when Inbsp;was asleep</l>

<l>I thought it was that sweet man of mine makin' his 'fore day
creep</l>

<l>Wasn't nothin' but my landlord, a great big chump</l>

<l>Sat 'way from my door Mr. landlord, 'cause I'm down in the dumps</l>



<l>When I woke up my pillow was wet with tears</l>

<l>Just one from that man o' mine seems like a thousand years</l>

<l>But I'm gonna straighten up, straighter than Andy Gump</l>

<l>Ain't no use of me tellin' that lie 'cause I'm down in the dumps</l>



<l>I'm twenty-five years old, that ain't no old maid</l>

<l>I got plenty of vim and vitality, I'm sure that I can make the
grade</l>

<l>I'm always like a tiger, I'm ready to jump</l>

<l>I need w whole lot's of lovin' 'cause I'm down in the dumps</l>
