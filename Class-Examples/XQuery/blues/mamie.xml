<lyrics>



Marnie, don't you hear me call your name

Oh Marnie, don't you hear me calling your name

Well Marnie I wanna see you so bad little girl,

Till I don't know what to do



Marnie, won't you please shake my hand

Oh Marnie, Marnie, won't you please shake my hand

Well I love you so hard Marnie,

and you know I just can't explain



Marnie, won't you come and kiss me goodbye

Oh Marnie, Marnie, why don't you come and kiss me goodbye

Well you know I hate to see you leave me little girl,

You know you gonna make me cry



Marnie, you got me down on my bended knees

Marnie, you got me down on my bended knees

Well little girl I hate to see you leave me, you hear me?

That's why I'm beggin you please, please
