<lyrics>


<l>My baby's gone and left me cryin' by myself

</l>
<l>My baby's gone and left me cryin' by myself

</l>
<l>I loved another woman, now I lost my best gal



</l>
<l>She was a real good woman, never done me no harm

</l>
<l>Was a real good woman, never done me no harm

</l>
<l>I loved another woman, now she's up and she's gone



</l>
<l>Well, come back baby, I won't do you no wrong

</l>
<l>Come back baby, I won't do you no wrong

</l>
<l>I loved another woman, and I won't do that no more



</l>
<l>Wow-wow-wow-wow

</l>
<l>Wow-wow-wow-wow

</l>
<l>Wow-wow-wow-wow

</l>
<l>Wow-wow-wow-wow

</l>
<l>Wow-wow-wow-wow

</l>
<l>Wow-wow-wow-wow

</l>
<l>Wow-wow-wow-wow

</l>
<l>(Repeat to end)</l></lyrics></xml>
