<lyrics>



My baby's gone and left me cryin' by myself

My baby's gone and left me cryin' by myself

I loved another woman, now I lost my best gal



She was a real good woman, never done me no harm

Was a real good woman, never done me no harm

I loved another woman, now she's up and she's gone



Well, come back baby, I won't do you no wrong

Come back baby, I won't do you no wrong

I loved another woman, and I won't do that no more



Wow-wow-wow-wow

Wow-wow-wow-wow

Wow-wow-wow-wow

Wow-wow-wow-wow

Wow-wow-wow-wow

Wow-wow-wow-wow

Wow-wow-wow-wow

(Repeat to end)
