<lyrics>


<l>On the wall and on the ceiling, I see your face all night
long

</l>
<l>On the wall and on the ceiling, I see your face all night long

</l>
<l>Well, I've got the blues so bad, I wanna leave my happy home, happy

home




</l>
<l>I'd rather be on a freight train, than layin' here in my bed

</l>
<l>I'd rather be travelin', than layin' here in my bed

</l>
<l>'Cause I've got you on my mind and freight trains in my head



</l>
<l>I'm gonna grab me a freight train and ride all night long

</l>
<l>Yes, I'm gonna catch me a freight train and ride all night long

</l>
<l>And tomorrow mornin', I'll be a long ways from home</l></lyrics></xml>
