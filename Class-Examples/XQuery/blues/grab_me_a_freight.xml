<lyrics>



On the wall and on the ceiling, I see your face all night
long

On the wall and on the ceiling, I see your face all night long

Well, I've got the blues so bad, I wanna leave my happy home, happy
home



I'd rather be on a freight train, than layin' here in my bed

I'd rather be travelin', than layin' here in my bed

'Cause I've got you on my mind and freight trains in my head



I'm gonna grab me a freight train and ride all night long

Yes, I'm gonna catch me a freight train and ride all night long

And tomorrow mornin', I'll be a long ways from home
