<lyrics>


<l>Bo Diddley's a gunslinger

</l>
<l>Bo Diddley's a gunslinger

</l>
<l>Yeh, ah-ha

</l>
<l>Yeh, ah-ha

</l>
<l>I've got a story I really want to tell,

</l>
<l>about Bo Diddley at the O.K. Corral

</l>
<l>Now, Bo Diddley didn't stand no mess,

</l>
<l>he wore a gun on his hip and a rose on his chest



</l>
<l>Bo Diddley's a gunslinger

</l>
<l>Bo Diddley's a gunslinger

</l>
<l>Yeh, ah-ha (he must be!)

</l>
<l>Yeh, ah-ha (sure 'nuff!)



</l>
<l>When Bo Diddley come to town,

</l>
<l>the streets get empty and the sun go down

</l>
<l>Sheriff's standing in the doorway,

</l>
<l>you know he's so scared to say



</l>
<l>Yeh, ah-ha

</l>
<l>Yeh, ah-ha

</l>
<l>Bo Diddley's a gunslinger

</l>
