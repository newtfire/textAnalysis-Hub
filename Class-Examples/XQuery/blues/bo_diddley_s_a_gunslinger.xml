<lyrics>



Bo Diddley's a gunslinger

Bo Diddley's a gunslinger

Yeh, ah-ha

Yeh, ah-ha

I've got a story I really want to tell,

about Bo Diddley at the O.K. Corral

Now, Bo Diddley didn't stand no mess,

he wore a gun on his hip and a rose on his chest



Bo Diddley's a gunslinger

Bo Diddley's a gunslinger

Yeh, ah-ha (he must be!)

Yeh, ah-ha (sure 'nuff!)



When Bo Diddley come to town,

the streets get empty and the sun go down

Sheriff's standing in the doorway,

you know he's so scared to say



Yeh, ah-ha

Yeh, ah-ha

Bo Diddley's a gunslinger

Bo Diddley's a gunslinger
