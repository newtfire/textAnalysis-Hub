<lyrics>



You got to give a little

Take a little

And let your poor heart

Break a little

That's the story of

That's the glory of love



You've got to laugh a little

Cry a little

Until the clouds

Roll by a little

That's the story of

That's the glory of love



As long as there's the two of us

We've got the world

And all its charms

But when the world

Is through with us

We've got each other's arms



You've got to win a little

Lose a little

And always have

The blues a little

That's the story of

That's the glory of love



As long as there's the two of us

That's right, B.

Yeah, we've got the world

And all its charms

And when the world

Is through with us, baby

We've got each other's arms



You've got to win a little

And lose a little

And always have

The blues a little

That's the story of

That's the glory of

That's the story

The glory of love

That's the story of

That's the glory of love
