<l>You got to give a little

</l>
<l>Take a little

</l>
<l>And let your poor heart

</l>
<l>Break a little

</l>
<l>That's the story of

</l>
<l>That's the glory of love



</l>
<l>You've got to laugh a little

</l>
<l>Cry a little

</l>
<l>Until the clouds

</l>
<l>Roll by a little

</l>
<l>That's the story of

</l>
<l>That's the glory of love



</l>
<l>As long as there's the two of us

</l>
<l>We've got the world

</l>
<l>And all its charms

</l>
<l>But when the world

</l>
<l>Is through with us

</l>
<l>We've got each other's arms



</l>
<l>You've got to win a little

</l>
<l>Lose a little

</l>
<l>And always have

</l>
<l>The blues a little

</l>
<l>That's the story of

</l>
<l>That's the glory of love



</l>
<l>As long as there's the two of us

</l>
<l>That's right, B.

</l>
<l>Yeah, we've got the world

</l>
<l>And all its charms

</l>
<l>And when the world

</l>
<l>Is through with us, baby

</l>
<l>We've got each other's arms



</l>
<l>You've got to win a little

</l>
<l>And lose a little

</l>
<l>And always have

</l>
<l>The blues a little

</l>
<l>That's the story of

</l>
<l>That's the glory of

</l>
<l>That's the story

</l>
<l>The glory of love

</l>
