<lyrics>

<l>Daddy, mama's got the blues

</l>
<l>The kind of blues that's hard to lose

</l>
<l>'Cause you mistreated me

</l>
<l>And drove me from your door

</l>
<l>Daddy, you ain't heard the news

</l>
<l>There's another papa in your shoes

</l>
<l>You ain't even got a chance with me no more

</l>
<l>So be on your p's and q's
1



</l>
<l>Mistreating daddy, mistreating mama all the time

</l>
<l>Just because she wouldn't let you

</l>
<l>Mistreating daddy, mama's drawed the danger line

</l>
<l>Yes, you'll cross it, I'll get you

</l>
<l>If you see me setting on another daddy's knee

</l>
<l>Don't bother me, I'm as mean as can be

</l>
<l>I'm like the butcher right down the street

</l>
<l>I can cut you all apieces like I would a piece of meat

</l>
<l>Mistreating daddy, you used to knock your mama down

</l>
<l>When you knew I fell for you

</l>
<l>Had me so nervous, I would start dogging 'round

</l>
<l>Yes, every time I saw you

</l>
<l>But now I've got you off of my mind

</l>
<l>And found another daddy who's just my kind

</l>
<l>Mistreating daddy, I've got another papa now



</l>
<l>I've got a tip for people talking about

</l>
<l>I will grab my daddy and turn him wrong side out

</l>
<l>Mistreating daddy, I've got a good papa now

<note>Note 1: p's and q's, something (as one's manners) that one should be
mindful of or being on one's best behavior. From the phrase "mind
one's p's and q's", alluding to the difficulty a child learning to
write has in distinguishing between p and q</note></lyrics></xml>
