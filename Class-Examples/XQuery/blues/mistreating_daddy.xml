<lyrics>



Daddy, mama's got the blues

The kind of blues that's hard to lose

'Cause you mistreated me

And drove me from your door

Daddy, you ain't heard the news

There's another papa in your shoes

You ain't even got a chance with me no more

So be on your p's and q's
1



Mistreating daddy, mistreating mama all the time

Just because she wouldn't let you

Mistreating daddy, mama's drawed the danger line

Yes, you'll cross it, I'll get you

If you see me setting on another daddy's knee

Don't bother me, I'm as mean as can be

I'm like the butcher right down the street

I can cut you all apieces like I would a piece of meat

Mistreating daddy, you used to knock your mama down

When you knew I fell for you

Had me so nervous, I would start dogging 'round

Yes, every time I saw you

But now I've got you off of my mind

And found another daddy who's just my kind

Mistreating daddy, I've got another papa now



I've got a tip for people talking about

I will grab my daddy and turn him wrong side out

Mistreating daddy, I've got a good papa now



__________

Note 1: p's and q's, something (as one's manners) that one should be
mindful of or being on one's best behavior. From the phrase "mind
one's p's and q's", alluding to the difficulty a child learning to
write has in distinguishing between p and q.
