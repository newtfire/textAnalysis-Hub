<lyrics>



I want you to stop right there baby

Baby, and try to understand

I might have been your fool for a while baby

But I know I'm a good loving man

And you shouldn't lie to me baby

Makes me mad as a man can be



Oh, I know when you got home last night

Your kissing me was your plan

Hey, I know you were just faking me baby

'Cause you've been out with another man

And you shouldn't lie to me baby

Makes me mad as a man can be



Hey, I can't quit you baby

'Cause you're honey but the bees don't know

Yeah, there is one thing I got to tell you little girl

Just one thing before I go

That is you shouldn't lie to me baby

Makes me mad as a man can be
