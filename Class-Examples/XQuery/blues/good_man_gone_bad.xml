<lyrics>


<l>I want you to stop right there baby

</l>
<l>Baby, and try to understand

</l>
<l>I might have been your fool for a while baby

</l>
<l>But I know I'm a good loving man

</l>
<l>And you shouldn't lie to me baby

</l>
<l>Makes me mad as a man can be



</l>
<l>Oh, I know when you got home last night

</l>
<l>Your kissing me was your plan

</l>
<l>Hey, I know you were just faking me baby

</l>
<l>'Cause you've been out with another man

</l>
<l>And you shouldn't lie to me baby

</l>
<l>Makes me mad as a man can be



</l>
<l>Hey, I can't quit you baby

</l>
<l>'Cause you're honey but the bees don't know

</l>
<l>Yeah, there is one thing I got to tell you little girl

</l>
<l>Just one thing before I go

</l>
<l>That is you shouldn't lie to me baby

</l>
<l>Makes me mad as a man can be</l></lyrics></xml>
