<lyrics>



Jesus just left Chicago and he's bound for New Orleans

Well now, Jesus just left Chicago and he's bound for New Orleans,
yeah, yeah

Workin' from one end to the other and all points in between



Took a jump through Mississippi, well, muddy water turned to wine

Took a jump through Mississippi, muddy water turned to wine, yeah,
yeah

Then out to California through the forests and the pines, ah, take me
with you, Jesus



You might not see him in person but he'll see you just the same

You might not see him in person but he'll see you just the same,
yeah, yeah

You don't have to worry 'cause takin' care of business is his
name
