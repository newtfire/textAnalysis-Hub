<lyrics>


<l>You're breaking my heart, baby

</l>
<l>There ain't a damn thing I can do

</l>
<l>You got me wringing my hands

</l>
<l>And crying, baby

</l>
<l>While you're breaking my heart in two

</l>
<l>You know I just can't believe

</l>
<l>I can't believe, baby

</l>
<l>That you're doing the things you do



</l>
<l>I can't believe, baby

</l>
<l>I can't believe you would do me wrong

</l>
<l>Please have mercy on me, baby

</l>
<l>I want you to come on back

</l>
<l>Come on back where you belong

</l>
<l>I want you so bad

</l>
<l>I want you so bad, baby

</l>
<l>You know I need my lady home</l></lyrics></xml>
