<lyrics>



They call me Muddy Water
1
, I'm just as restless man as the
deep blue sea

Oh yeah, they call me Muddy Water, I'm just as restless man as the
deep blue sea

You know I've been like that, ever since my baby been gone from
me



The night she left me, you know the rain boy was pouring down

Oh yeah, the night the little girl left me, you know the rain was
pouring down

You know I was the most bluest man, in this whole Chicago town



I got a brand new babe, she just as sweet man as a girl can be

Oh Lord I got a brand new girl, she just as sweet man as a apple on a
tree

I wanna tell all you people, how the little child been sending me



__________

Note 1: when Muddy Waters was a young kid, he used to play in a creek
nearby 
their
house
, he always got dirty and his two sisters started calling
him Muddy Waters.
