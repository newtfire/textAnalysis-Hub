<lyrics>

<l>They call me Muddy Water
1
, I'm just as restless man as the
deep blue sea

</l>
<l>Oh yeah, they call me Muddy Water, I'm just as restless man as the
deep blue sea

</l>
<l>You know I've been like that, ever since my baby been gone from
me



</l>
<l>The night she left me, you know the rain boy was pouring down

</l>
<l>Oh yeah, the night the little girl left me, you know the rain was
pouring down

</l>
<l>You know I was the most bluest man, in this whole Chicago town



</l>
<l>I got a brand new babe, she just as sweet man as a girl can be

</l>
<l>Oh Lord I got a brand new girl, she just as sweet man as a apple on a
tree

</l>
<l>I wanna tell all you people, how the little child been sending me
