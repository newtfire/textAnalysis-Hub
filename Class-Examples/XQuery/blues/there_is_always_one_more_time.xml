<lyrics>


<l>If your whole life somehow

</l>
<l>Wasn't much 'til now

</l>
<l>And you've almost lost

</l>
<l>Your will to live

</l>
<l>No matter what you've been through

</l>
<l>Long as there's breath in you

</l>
<l>There is always one more time



</l>
<l>And if your dreams go bad

</l>
<l>Every one that you've had

</l>
<l>That don't mean that some dreams

</l>
<l>Can't come true

</l>
<l>'Cause it's funny about dreams

</l>
<l>As strange as it seems

</l>
<l>There is always one more time



</l>
<l>Oh turnin' corners

</l>
<l>Is only a state of mind

</l>
<l>Keeping your eyes closed

</l>
<l>Is worse than being blind



</l>
<l>If there's a heart out there

</l>
<l>Looking for someone to share

</l>
<l>I don't care if it's been

</l>
<l>Turned down time and time again

</l>
<l>And if we meet one day

</l>
<l>Please don't walk away

</l>
<l>'Cause there is always one more time

</l><l>There is always one more time</l></lyrics></xml>
