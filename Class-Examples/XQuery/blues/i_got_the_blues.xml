<lyrics>



Just tell me baby, just tell me baby

What can I do to change your mind?

Hey hey, baby can I change your mind?

I got the freight train blues, the tracks is out-a line



You got a man in the east, an' a man in the west

Just sittin' here wonderin' who you love the best

Hey hey, what can I do to change your mind?

I got the blues for you baby, you keep me worried all the time



You say you love me, I believe in you

You tryin' to quit me, what more can I do?

Hey hey, baby can I change your mind?

I got the blues for you baby, you keep me worried all the time



(Now boy, you know I got the blues, now play 'em for me now!)



Yes, yes, yes, yes



My mama got 'em, my papa got 'em

My sister told me that she had them, too

Hey hey, mama what can I do?

Some old day you will want me

And I won't care a thing about you
