<lyrics>


<l>Just tell me baby, just tell me baby

</l>
<l>What can I do to change your mind?

</l>
<l>Hey hey, baby can I change your mind?

</l>
<l>I got the freight train blues, the tracks is out-a line



</l>
<l>You got a man in the east, an' a man in the west

</l>
<l>Just sittin' here wonderin' who you love the best

</l>
<l>Hey hey, what can I do to change your mind?

</l>
<l>I got the blues for you baby, you keep me worried all the time



</l>
<l>You say you love me, I believe in you

</l>
<l>You tryin' to quit me, what more can I do?

</l>
<l>Hey hey, baby can I change your mind?

</l>
<l>I got the blues for you baby, you keep me worried all the time



</l>
<l>(Now boy, you know I got the blues, now play 'em for me now!)



</l>
<l>Yes, yes, yes, yes



</l>
<l>My mama got 'em, my papa got 'em

</l>
<l>My sister told me that she had them, too

</l>
<l>Hey hey, mama what can I do?

</l>
<l>Some old day you will want me

</l>
<l>And I won't care a thing about you</l></lyrics></xml>
