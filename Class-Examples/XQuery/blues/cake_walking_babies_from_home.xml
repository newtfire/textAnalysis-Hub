Cake walkers
1
 may come, cake walkers may go,

but I wanna tell you 'bout a couple I know

High steppin' pair, Debonair

When it comes for bus'ness not a soul can compare



Here they come, look at 'em, demonstratin',

goin' some, ain't they syncopatin'?

Talk of the town, teasin' brown pickin' 'em up and layin' 'em
down

Dancin' fools ain't they demonstratin'?

They're a class of their own



Now the only way to win is to cheat 'em,

you may tie 'em but you'll never beat 'em


Strut your stuff
, they're
the cake walkin' babies from home

Strut your stuff, strut your stuff, cake walkin' babies from home



Here they come, look at 'em, syncopatin',

goin' some, ain't they demonstratin'?

Talk of the town, teasin' brown pickin' 'em up and layin' 'em
down

Dancin' fools ain't they syncopatin'
2
?

They're a class of their own



Now the only way to win is to cheat 'em,

you may tie 'em but you'll never beat 'em

Strut your stuff, they're the cake walkin' babies form home

Strut your stuff, strut your stuff, cake walkin' babies from home

Note 1: cakewalk, a black American entertainment having a cake as
prize for the most accomplished steps and figures in walking. Also, a
stage dance developed from walking steps and figures typically
involving a high prance with backward tilt. It is also used to
indicate a one-sided contest or an easy task;

Note 2: syncopatin', a rhythmical alteration which consists in
welding into one tone the second half of one beat with the first half
of the beat which follows.
