<l>Cake walkers

may come, cake walkers may go, </l>
<l>
but I wanna tell you 'bout a couple I know

</l>
<l>High steppin' pair, Debonair

</l>
<l>When it comes for bus'ness not a soul can compare



</l>
<l>Here they come, look at 'em, demonstratin',

</l>
<l>goin' some, ain't they syncopatin'?

</l>
<l>Talk of the town, teasin' brown pickin' 'em up and layin' 'em
down

</l>
<l>Dancin' fools ain't they demonstratin'?

</l>
<l>They're a class of their own



</l>
<l>Now the only way to win is to cheat 'em,

</l>
<l>you may tie 'em but you'll never beat 'em


</l>
<l>Strut your stuff
, they're
the cake walkin' babies from home

</l>
<l>Strut your stuff, strut your stuff, cake walkin' babies from home



</l>
<l>Here they come, look at 'em, syncopatin',

</l>
<l>goin' some, ain't they demonstratin'?

</l>
<l>Talk of the town, teasin' brown pickin' 'em up and layin' 'em
down

</l>
<l>Dancin' fools ain't they syncopatin'

?

</l>
<l>They're a class of their own



</l>
<l>Now the only way to win is to cheat 'em,

</l>
<l>you may tie 'em but you'll never beat 'em

</l>
<l>Strut your stuff, they're the cake walkin' babies form home

</l>
<l>Strut your stuff, strut your stuff, cake walkin' babies from home

<note>Note 1: cakewalk, a black American entertainment having a cake as
prize for the most accomplished steps and figures in walking. Also, a
stage dance developed from walking steps and figures typically
involving a high prance with backward tilt. It is also used to
indicate a one-sided contest or an easy task;

Note 2: syncopatin', a rhythmical alteration which consists in
welding into one tone the second half of one beat with the first half
of the beat which follows</note></lyrics></xml>
