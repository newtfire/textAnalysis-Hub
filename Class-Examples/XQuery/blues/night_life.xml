<lyrics>



When that ev'nin' sun goes down,

yeah, you'll find me hangin' around

Because the night life,

it ain't no good life but it's my life



Yeah, yeah, yeah listen to the blues,

listen to what they're sayin'

Oh, please listen to the blues,

listen to the blues they're playin'



Ah, ah, all of the people just like you and me,

they're all dreamin' about their old used to be

Because the night life,

it ain't no good life but it's my life



They tell me life's an empty scene,

an avenue of broken dreams

Because the night life,

it ain't no good life but it's my life
