<lyrics>


<l>When that ev'nin' sun goes down,

</l>
<l>yeah, you'll find me hangin' around

</l>
<l>Because the night life,

</l>
<l>it ain't no good life but it's my life



</l>
<l>Yeah, yeah, yeah listen to the blues,

</l>
<l>listen to what they're sayin'

</l>
<l>Oh, please listen to the blues,

</l>
<l>listen to the blues they're playin'



</l>
<l>Ah, ah, all of the people just like you and me,

</l>
<l>they're all dreamin' about their old used to be

</l>
<l>Because the night life,

</l>
<l>it ain't no good life but it's my life



</l>
<l>They tell me life's an empty scene,

</l>
<l>an avenue of broken dreams

</l>
<l>Because the night life,

</l>
<l>it ain't no good life but it's my life</l></lyrics></xml>
