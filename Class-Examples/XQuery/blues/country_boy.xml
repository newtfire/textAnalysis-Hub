<l>#91;Freddy#93;

</l>
<l>I'm just a little country boy

</l>
<l>Lookin' for my pride and joy

</l>
<l>I came to the city just to see what I could see



</l>
<l>I just made it in your town

</l>
<l>Thought I'd take a look around

</l>
<l>I wanna tell you baby

</l>
<l>Just how good you look to me



</l>
<l>My mama told me there will be sometime like this

</l>
<l>She told me there would be some moments here will flip

</l>
<l>She warned me of a lot of things I had to do

</l>
<l>But she didn't tell me I would meet somebody like you



</l>
<l>Somebody take a chance with me

</l>
<l>I want you to romance with me

</l>
<l>You might say I'm coy

</l>
<l>'Cause I'm just a little country boy



</l>
<l>#91;Margaret#93;

</l>
<l>I'm just a little country girl

</l>
<l>Living in a great big world

</l>
<l>I met some country boy

</l>
<l>And I've got some news for you



</l>
<l>He swept me right off my feet

</l>
<l>Made my life complete

</l>
<l>My heart skipped a beat

</l>
<l>'Cause he thrilled me through and through

</l>
<l>ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo



</l>
<l>#91;Sung together#93;

</l>
<l>We gonna march together down the aisle today

</l>
<l>We gonna see the preacher in the business way

</l>
<l>Oh I'm so happy can't you see I'm thrilled with joy?



</l>
<l>#91;Freddy#93;

</l>
<l>(Can't believe how this could happen to a country boy)



</l>
<l>So come and take me by the hand (M)

</l>
<l>Let me be your lovin' man (F)

</l>
<l>I'm in a great big world (M)

</l>
<l>My baby is a country girl (F)



</l>
<l>I found my toy (M)

</l>
<l>I'm a country boy (F)
