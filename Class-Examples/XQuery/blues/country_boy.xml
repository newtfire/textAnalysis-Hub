<lyrics>



#91;Freddy#93;

I'm just a little country boy

Lookin' for my pride and joy

I came to the city just to see what I could see



I just made it in your town

Thought I'd take a look around

I wanna tell you baby

Just how good you look to me



My mama told me there will be sometime like this

She told me there would be some moments here will flip

She warned me of a lot of things I had to do

But she didn't tell me I would meet somebody like you



Somebody take a chance with me

I want you to romance with me

You might say I'm coy

'Cause I'm just a little country boy



#91;Margaret#93;

I'm just a little country girl

Living in a great big world

I met some country boy

And I've got some news for you



He swept me right off my feet

Made my life complete

My heart skipped a beat

'Cause he thrilled me through and through

ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo



#91;Sung together#93;

We gonna march together down the aisle today

We gonna see the preacher in the business way

Oh I'm so happy can't you see I'm thrilled with joy?



#91;Freddy#93;

(Can't believe how this could happen to a country boy)



So come and take me by the hand (M)

Let me be your lovin' man (F)

I'm in a great big world (M)

My baby is a country girl (F)



I found my toy (M)

I'm a country boy (F)
