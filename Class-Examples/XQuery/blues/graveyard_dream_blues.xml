<lyrics>



Blues on my mind, blues all around my bed

Blues on my mind, blues all around my bed

Had a dream last night the man I love was dead



I went to the graveyard, fell down on my knees

I went to the graveyard, fell down on my knees

I asked the gravedigger to give me back my good man please



The gravedigger looked me in my eye

The gravedigger looked me in my eye

Said, "Sorry for you lady, your man's said his last goodbye"
