<l>Blues on my mind, blues all around my bed

</l>
<l>Blues on my mind, blues all around my bed

</l>
<l>Had a dream last night the man I love was dead



</l>
<l>I went to the graveyard, fell down on my knees

</l>
<l>I went to the graveyard, fell down on my knees

</l>
<l>I asked the gravedigger to give me back my good man please



</l>
<l>The gravedigger looked me in my eye

</l>
<l>The gravedigger looked me in my eye

</l>
<l>Said, "Sorry for you lady, your man's said his last goodbye"</l></lyrics></xml>
