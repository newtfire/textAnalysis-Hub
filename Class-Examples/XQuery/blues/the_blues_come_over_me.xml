<lyrics>



My baby gives me love

As good as love can be

I just leave her crying

When the blues come over me



Up on a mountain

I'm drowning in the sea

All the clocks say midnight

When the blues come over me



The blues come over me

I pack it up and go

The blues come over me

I catch the wind and blow



And some will take the wine

And some will take the night

When everything's all wrong

Then anything is all right



Some put in a song

And some sing it for their dues

Some go to sleep and wake up

Tangled in the blues



The blues come over me

I pack it up and go

The blues come over me

I catch the wind and blow



The blues come in a whisper

And make you scream and shout

And you'll do most anything

Just to let them out



I may think I'm happy

I may think I'm free

Nothing don't mean nothing

When the blues come over me



The blues come up behind

The blues wait up ahead

The blues ask why you are born

If you just end up dead



The blues, talking about the blues

The blues, oh the blues, the blues

Talking about the blues

When the blues come over me

Talking about the blues

I have to go away

The blues, the blues

When the blues come over me

I have to pack it up and go
