<lyrics>


<l>My baby gives me love

</l>
<l>As good as love can be

</l>
<l>I just leave her crying

</l>
<l>When the blues come over me



</l>
<l>Up on a mountain

</l>
<l>I'm drowning in the sea

</l>
<l>All the clocks say midnight

</l>
<l>When the blues come over me



</l>
<l>The blues come over me

</l>
<l>I pack it up and go

</l>
<l>The blues come over me

</l>
<l>I catch the wind and blow



</l>
<l>And some will take the wine

</l>
<l>And some will take the night

</l>
<l>When everything's all wrong

</l>
<l>Then anything is all right



</l>
<l>Some put in a song

</l>
<l>And some sing it for their dues

</l>
<l>Some go to sleep and wake up

</l>
<l>Tangled in the blues



</l>
<l>The blues come over me

</l>
<l>I pack it up and go

</l>
<l>The blues come over me

</l>
<l>I catch the wind and blow



</l>
<l>The blues come in a whisper

</l>
<l>And make you scream and shout

</l>
<l>And you'll do most anything

</l>
<l>Just to let them out



</l>
<l>I may think I'm happy

</l>
<l>I may think I'm free

</l>
<l>Nothing don't mean nothing

</l>
<l>When the blues come over me



</l>
<l>The blues come up behind

</l>
<l>The blues wait up ahead

</l>
<l>The blues ask why you are born

</l>
<l>If you just end up dead



</l>
<l>The blues, talking about the blues

</l>
<l>The blues, oh the blues, the blues

</l>
<l>Talking about the blues

</l>
<l>When the blues come over me

</l>
<l>Talking about the blues

</l>
<l>I have to go away

</l>
<l>The blues, the blues

</l>
<l>When the blues come over me

</l>
<l>I have to pack it up and go</l></lyrics></xml>
