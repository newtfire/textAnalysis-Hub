<lyrics>



Oh, you're on the top now, baby, but don't nothing stay the same

I said you're up on the top now, baby, but don't nothing stay the
same

Every once in a while, baby, lady Luck deals another hand



Are you calling me your pal now, baby, when I used to be your man

Are you calling me your pal now, when I used to be your man

You're flying real high now, baby, go on and raise your sand



Oh, you're up on the top now, baby, but don't nothing stay the
same

I said you're up on the top now, baby, but don't nothing stay the
same

Every once in a while, lady Luck deals another hand



Oh, I realize now, baby, your kind of love wasn't true

Oh, I realize now, baby, your kind of love won't do

What could have been, baby, hey, now has done fell through
