<lyrics>


<l>Oh, you're on the top now, baby, but don't nothing stay the same

</l>
<l>I said you're up on the top now, baby, but don't nothing stay the
same

</l>
<l>Every once in a while, baby, lady Luck deals another hand



</l>
<l>Are you calling me your pal now, baby, when I used to be your man

</l>
<l>Are you calling me your pal now, when I used to be your man

</l>
<l>You're flying real high now, baby, go on and raise your sand



</l>
<l>Oh, you're up on the top now, baby, but don't nothing stay the
same

</l>
<l>I said you're up on the top now, baby, but don't nothing stay the
same

</l>
<l>Every once in a while, lady Luck deals another hand



</l>
<l>Oh, I realize now, baby, your kind of love wasn't true

</l>
<l>Oh, I realize now, baby, your kind of love won't do

</l>
<l>What could have been, baby, hey, now has done fell through</l></lyrics></xml>
