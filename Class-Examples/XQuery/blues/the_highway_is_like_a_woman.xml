<lyrics>


<l>The time has come, I got to hit the road again

</l>
<l>I said the time has come, I've got to hit the road again

</l>
<l>'Cause I travel with a passion, and the highway is my lady friend



</l>
<l>You see the highway's like a woman, soft shoulders an' dangerous
curves

</l>
<l>You see the highway is like a woman, like a woman, soft shoulders an'
dangerous curve

</l>
<l>If you don't know her when you start travelin', boy she can really

upset your nerves




</l>
<l>But if you respect her when she warns you, I swear the highway treat
you fine

</l>
<l>But if you respect her when she warn you, I swear the highway'll
treat you fine

</l><l>When she's wet an' she's slippery, then watch out for the detour</l>
