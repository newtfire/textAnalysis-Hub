<lyrics>



The time has come, I got to hit the road again

I said the time has come, I've got to hit the road again

'Cause I travel with a passion, and the highway is my lady friend



You see the highway's like a woman, soft shoulders an' dangerous
curves

You see the highway is like a woman, like a woman, soft shoulders an'
dangerous curve

If you don't know her when you start travelin', boy she can really
upset your nerves



But if you respect her when she warns you, I swear the highway treat
you fine

But if you respect her when she warn you, I swear the highway'll
treat you fine

When she's wet an' she's slippery, then watch out for the detour
sign
