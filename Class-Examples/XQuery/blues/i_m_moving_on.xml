<lyrics>



Just this morning

I took a big long look around

I've lived it up and loved it up

And done it in this town

Life goes on

Look like it's time

For moving on



Good-bye, baby

I wanna thank you for the ride

We did a dance and took a chance

Nothing we ain't tried

C'est la vie

Time, you and me

Moving on



I'm moving on

I'll see you somewhere down the line

I'm moving on

We're looking good and feeling fine

I'm moving on

And you are yours and I'm mine

I'll see you somewhere in my dreams

I'm moving on

So thanks for all the memories

I'm moving on

And you can call me Mr. Breeze

I'm moving on

Life is full of mysteries

Nothing is ever what it seems



Might try Vegas

And keep on playing till I win

Or take it out to Hollywood

And fall in love again

Come what may

Night and day

I'm moving on



I'm moving on



I'm moving on

I'll see you somewhere down the line

I'm moving on

We're looking good and feeling fine

I'm moving on

And you are yours and I'm mine

I'll see you somewhere in my dreams

I'm moving on

So thanks for all the memories

I'm moving on

And you can call me Mr. Breeze

I'm moving on

Life is full of mysteries

Nothing is ever what it seems
