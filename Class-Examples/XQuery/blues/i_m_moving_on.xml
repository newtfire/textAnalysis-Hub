<lyrics>


<l>Just this morning

</l>
<l>I took a big long look around

</l>
<l>I've lived it up and loved it up

</l>
<l>And done it in this town

</l>
<l>Life goes on

</l>
<l>Look like it's time

</l>
<l>For moving on



</l>
<l>Good-bye, baby

</l>
<l>I wanna thank you for the ride

</l>
<l>We did a dance and took a chance

</l>
<l>Nothing we ain't tried

</l>
<l>C'est la vie

</l>
<l>Time, you and me

</l>
<l>Moving on



</l>
<l>I'm moving on

</l>
<l>I'll see you somewhere down the line

</l>
<l>I'm moving on

</l>
<l>We're looking good and feeling fine

</l>
<l>I'm moving on

</l>
<l>And you are yours and I'm mine

</l>
<l>I'll see you somewhere in my dreams

</l>
<l>I'm moving on

</l>
<l>So thanks for all the memories

</l>
<l>I'm moving on

</l>
<l>And you can call me Mr. Breeze

</l>
<l>I'm moving on

</l>
<l>Life is full of mysteries

</l>
<l>Nothing is ever what it seems



</l>
<l>Might try Vegas

</l>
<l>And keep on playing till I win

</l>
<l>Or take it out to Hollywood

</l>
<l>And fall in love again

</l>
<l>Come what may

</l>
<l>Night and day

</l>
<l>I'm moving on



</l>
<l>I'm moving on



</l>
<l>I'm moving on

</l>
<l>I'll see you somewhere down the line

</l>
<l>I'm moving on

</l>
<l>We're looking good and feeling fine

</l>
<l>I'm moving on

</l>
<l>And you are yours and I'm mine

</l>
<l>I'll see you somewhere in my dreams

</l>
<l>I'm moving on

</l>
<l>So thanks for all the memories

</l>
<l>I'm moving on

</l>
<l>And you can call me Mr. Breeze

</l>
<l>I'm moving on

</l>
<l>Life is full of mysteries

</l><l>Nothing is ever what it seems</l></lyrics></xml>
