<l>Well I'm lookin' out the window, I'm lookin' at you

</l>
<l>Yeah I'm lookin' out the window, I'm lookin' at you



</l>
<l>Well I'm dreamin' all the sweet dreams and the memories of the
past

</l>
<l>Feel so fine honey, that's why our love should last

</l>
<l>Feel so good baby and it's all because of you

</l>
<l>I've gotta love ya, I need to love ya, I want to love ya so nice

</l>
<l>We're havin' all the time to ourselves

</l>
<l>Yeah, we're havin' all the fun to ourselves



</l>
<l>Lord I'm pickin' up the pieces off the shelf

</l>
<l>Won't take long baby 'cause there's hardly any left

</l>
<l>Feel so good baby but it's all because of you



</l>
<l>I've gotta love ya, I need to love ya, I want to love ya so nice

</l>
<l>I'm lookin' out the window, I'm lookin' at you

</l>
<l>Yeah I'm lookin' out the window, I'm lookin' at you



</l>
<l>Well I'm dreamin' all the sweet dreams and the memories of the
past

</l>
<l>Feel so fine honey, that's why our love should last

</l>
<l>Feel so good darlin' and it's all because of you

</l>
<l>I've gotta love ya, I need to love ya, I want to love ya so nice
