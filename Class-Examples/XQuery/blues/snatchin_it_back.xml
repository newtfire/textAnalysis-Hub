<lyrics>



How can I get your love,

when you keep on snatchin' in back?

I want ya to tell me baby

How can I get your love,

when you keep on snatchin' it back?

Cha' tell me, tell me baby



How do you 'spect for me to get it,

When you keep on doin' like that?



Hey, you want me an' I want you

But you're afraid that I won't be true

I've got your love in the palm of my hand

You change your mind, snatch it back again



How can I get your love,

when you keep on snatchin' it back?

C'mon tell me, tell me baby

How can I get your love,

when ya keep on snatchin' it back?



Hey, how can you 'spect for me to get it,

when you keep on doin' like that, um hm?

Some other man before my time

Must have loved you, left you behind

You're afraid that I'll hurt you

But I won't do anything, you don't want me to



How can I get your love,

when you keep on snatchin' it back?

How can I get your love,

when you keep on snatchin' it back?



Look out ya'all, come on through!



Some other man before my time

Must have loved you, left you behind

Now you're afraid that I'll hurt you

But I won't do anything, woman

You don't want me to



How can I get your love,

when you keep on snatchin' it back?

C'mon, c'mon, c'mon baby

How can I get your love,

when you keep on snatchin' it back?

Tell me, tell me baby



How, how can I get your love,

when you keep on snatchin' it back?

How can I get your love,

when you keep on snatchin' it back?

Um, hm, hm


Fading:

Get your love

Ya keep snatchin' it back

Um, hey baby, uh, ow ow
