If you can't do no better, think I'd better get another that can

Yes, if you can't do no better, think I'd better get another that
can

You know you're going around and cheap on me, you're doing nothing
but losing a good man



You know life is too short to be worry, and I think you are not
understand

Yeah, life is too short to be worry think you are not understand

You're keep going around and cheap on me, you ain't doing nothing but
losing a good man



If I never said hello to you baby then I won't be say good bye

Hey, if I never said hello to you baby then I won't be say good
bye

I got my cloths already packed now, I'm so hurt, I wanna cry



Oh, can you hear me, hear me baby?

Can you hear me?

Oh, I got my cloths

My cloths is already packed

I'm so hurt, I wanna cry

I wanna know why you treat me like you do baby

I wanna never tell me why



Yes, if you can't do me no better baby, think I'd better get another
baby that can

Yes, if you can't do me no better baby, think I'd better get another
baby that can

The way you treat me now baby, you ain't doing nothing but losing a
good man



Hey, life is too short to be worry and I think you are not
understand

Hey, I say life is too short to be worry and I think you are not
understand

The way you treat me now baby, you ain't doing nothing but losing a
good man



What you say now!
