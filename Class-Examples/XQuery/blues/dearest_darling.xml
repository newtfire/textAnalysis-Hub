<lyrics>


<l>Dearest darling

</l>
<l>Dearest darling

</l>
<l>Dearest darling



</l>
<l>Don't you know, the Lord above, created you, just for me to love

</l>
<l>Picked you out, from all the rest, because he knew I loved you

best




</l>
<l>Dearest darling

</l>
<l>Dearest darling

</l>
<l>Dearest darling, take my hand, take my hand



</l>
<l>I once had a heart, so trill and true

</l>
<l>But now it's gone, from me to you

</l>
<l>Take care of it, like I have done

</l>
<l>For you have two hearts, and I have none



</l>
<l>Dearest darling

</l>
<l>Dearest darling

</l>
<l>Dearest darling



</l>
<l>If I get to heaven, before you do

</l>
<l>I'll try to make a hole, and pull you thru



</l>
<l>Dearest, dearest. dearest.



</l>
<l>If I go to heaven, and you not there,

</l>
<l>I'm gonna write your name, on the heavenly stair

</l>
<l>If you aren't there, by turn of day,

</l>
<l>Then I know baby, you know the way



</l>
<l>Dearest, dearest, dearest

</l><l>O sweet baby, o sweet baby...</l></lyrics></xml>
