<lyrics>



Dearest darling

Dearest darling

Dearest darling



Don't you know, the Lord above, created you, just for me to love

Picked you out, from all the rest, because he knew I loved you
best



Dearest darling

Dearest darling

Dearest darling, take my hand, take my hand



I once had a heart, so trill and true

But now it's gone, from me to you

Take care of it, like I have done

For you have two hearts, and I have none



Dearest darling

Dearest darling

Dearest darling



If I get to heaven, before you do

I'll try to make a hole, and pull you thru



Dearest, dearest. dearest.



If I go to heaven, and you not there,

I'm gonna write your name, on the heavenly stair

If you aren't there, by turn of day,

Then I know baby, you know the way



Dearest, dearest, dearest

O sweet baby, o sweet baby...
