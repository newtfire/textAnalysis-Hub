<lyrics>



My loving woman and me lying in the sand

We#146;re on a holiday out in a foreign land

Sunny day

We can play

Lazing by the deep blue sea

Happy now that we are free

This is how it ought to be

We are on our own



Go underwater and see another world of green

Fishes go by and I get to wondering where they#146;ve been

Sunny day

We can play

Lazing by the deep blue sea

Happy now that we are free

This is how it ought to be

We are on our own



Take out a boat and paddle it around the bay

Pressures from the world seem to fade away

Sunny day

We can play

Sailing on the deep blue sea

Happy now that we are free

This is how it ought to be

We are on our own
