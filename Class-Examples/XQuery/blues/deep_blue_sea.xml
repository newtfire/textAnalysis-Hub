<lyrics>


<l>My loving woman and me lying in the sand

</l>
<l>We#146;re on a holiday out in a foreign land

</l>
<l>Sunny day

</l>
<l>We can play

</l>
<l>Lazing by the deep blue sea

</l>
<l>Happy now that we are free

</l>
<l>This is how it ought to be

</l>
<l>We are on our own



</l>
<l>Go underwater and see another world of green

</l>
<l>Fishes go by and I get to wondering where they#146;ve been

</l>
<l>Sunny day

</l>
<l>We can play

</l>
<l>Lazing by the deep blue sea

</l>
<l>Happy now that we are free

</l>
<l>This is how it ought to be

</l>
<l>We are on our own



</l>
<l>Take out a boat and paddle it around the bay

</l>
<l>Pressures from the world seem to fade away

</l>
<l>Sunny day

</l>
<l>We can play

</l>
<l>Sailing on the deep blue sea

</l>
<l>Happy now that we are free

</l>
<l>This is how it ought to be

</l>
<l>We are on our own</l></lyrics></xml>
