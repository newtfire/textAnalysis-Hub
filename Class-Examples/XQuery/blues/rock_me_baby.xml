<lyrics>



Rock me baby, rock me all night long

Rock me baby, honey, rock me all night long

I want you to rock me baby, like my back ain't got no bone



Roll me baby, like you roll a wagon wheel

I want you to roll me baby, like you roll a wagon wheel

Want you to roll me baby, you don't know how it makes me feel



Rock me baby, honey, rock me slow

Yeah, rock me pretty baby, baby rock me slow

Want you to rock me baby, till I want no more
