<lyrics>



My song is a serious matter

It reflects what I feel

If I say I love you, I mean it

'Cause in my song

Every line is for real



Every man or woman

Enjoys going home

To a peaceful situation

To give love and receive love

Without any complications



Whether my tune is short or long

Whether my lyrics are weak or strong



I like to live the love

That I sing about in my song

I like to live the love

That I sing about in my song



Music is love

And my love is music

In perfect harmony

So when I sing

I have sung all about

The love of you and me



I never got angry with my guitar

'Cause when I strike a chord

It gives me what I wanna hear

So I'm finding out that

We are quite like my song together, my dear



Outside answers

Should always be forbidden

Problems should be solved

And never hidden



I like to live the love

That I sing about in my song

I like to live the love

That I sing about in my song
