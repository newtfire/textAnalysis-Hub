<lyrics>


<l>My song is a serious matter

</l>
<l>It reflects what I feel

</l>
<l>If I say I love you, I mean it

</l>
<l>'Cause in my song

</l>
<l>Every line is for real



</l>
<l>Every man or woman

</l>
<l>Enjoys going home

</l>
<l>To a peaceful situation

</l>
<l>To give love and receive love

</l>
<l>Without any complications



</l>
<l>Whether my tune is short or long

</l>
<l>Whether my lyrics are weak or strong



</l>
<l>I like to live the love

</l>
<l>That I sing about in my song

</l>
<l>I like to live the love

</l>
<l>That I sing about in my song



</l>
<l>Music is love

</l>
<l>And my love is music

</l>
<l>In perfect harmony

</l>
<l>So when I sing

</l>
<l>I have sung all about

</l>
<l>The love of you and me



</l>
<l>I never got angry with my guitar

</l>
<l>'Cause when I strike a chord

</l>
<l>It gives me what I wanna hear

</l>
<l>So I'm finding out that

</l>
<l>We are quite like my song together, my dear



</l>
<l>Outside answers

</l>
<l>Should always be forbidden

</l>
<l>Problems should be solved

</l>
<l>And never hidden



</l>
<l>I like to live the love

</l>
<l>That I sing about in my song

</l>
<l>I like to live the love

</l><l>That I sing about in my song</l></lyrics></xml>
