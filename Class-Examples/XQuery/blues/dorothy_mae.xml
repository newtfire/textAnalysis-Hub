<l>Hurry up people, tell me 'bout Dorothy Mae

</l>
<l>Hurry up people, tell me 'bout Dorothy Mae

</l>
<l>She left me this mo'nin', believe she got runaway



</l>
<l>Come back baby, try me one more time

</l>
<l>Come back baby, try me one more time

</l>
<l>You got me worried, well, worried mind



</l>
<l>Feel like, baby, oh my time ain't long

</l>
<l>(I wanna see God, yeah)

</l>
<l>Feel like, babe, oh my time ain't long

</l>
<l>(I wanna see God, yeah)

</l>
<l>Beg you pardon, Lord, I treat you wrong



</l>
<l>(Blow Wolf! Blow Wolf!)



</l>
<l>Oh Miss Dorothy, baby don't cry no more

</l>
<l>Oh Miss Dorothy, baby don't cry no more

</l>
<l>Tired of you worried babe, won't you find you some place to go
