<lyrics>



Hurry up people, tell me 'bout Dorothy Mae

Hurry up people, tell me 'bout Dorothy Mae

She left me this mo'nin', believe she got runaway



Come back baby, try me one more time

Come back baby, try me one more time

You got me worried, well, worried mind



Feel like, baby, oh my time ain't long

(I wanna see God, yeah)

Feel like, babe, oh my time ain't long

(I wanna see God, yeah)

Beg you pardon, Lord, I treat you wrong



(Blow Wolf! Blow Wolf!)



Oh Miss Dorothy, baby don't cry no more

Oh Miss Dorothy, baby don't cry no more

Tired of you worried babe, won't you find you some place to go
