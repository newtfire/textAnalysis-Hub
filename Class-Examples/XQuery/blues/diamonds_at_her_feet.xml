<l>She got to take sick and die one of these days

</l>
<l>She got to take sick and die oh! one of these days

</l>
<l>All the medicine I can buy, and all the doctors she can hire

</l>
<l>She got to take sick and die one of these days



</l>
<l>When she's dead I'm gonna bury her very deep

</l>
<l>When she's dead I'm gonna bury her very deep

</l>
<l>I'm gonna bury her very deep, rubies and diamonds round her feet

</l>
<l>She got to take sick and die one of these days



</l>
<l>I got to take sick and die one of these days

</l>
<l>She got to take sick and die oh! one of these days

</l>
<l>All the medicine she can buy, and all the doctors she can hire

</l>
<l>She got to take sick and die one of these days



</l>
<l>She got to take sick and die one of these days

</l>
<l>She got to take sick and die one of these days

</l>
<l>All the medicine she can buy, and all the doctors she can hire

</l>
<l>She got to take sick and die one of these days



</l>
<l>If it was me and all the powers in my hands

</l>
<l>If it was me and all the powers in my hands

</l>
<l>If it was me and all the powers laying there child in my hands

</l>
<l>She would have to go down to the promised land</l></lyrics></xml>
