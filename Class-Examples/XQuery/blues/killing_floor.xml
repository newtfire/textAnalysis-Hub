<lyrics>


<l>I should-a quit you, along time ago

</l>
<l>I should-a quit you, baby, along time ago

</l>
<l>I should-a quit you baby, an' went on to Mexico



</l>
<l>If I had-a followed, my first mind

</l>
<l>If I had-a followed, my first mind

</l>
<l>I would-a been gone, yeah, my second time



</l>
<l>Yeah!



</l>
<l>I should-a went on, when my friend come from Mexico an' me

</l>
<l>I should-a went on baby, when my friend come from Mexico an' me

</l>
<l>No foolin' 'round 'wit cha' darling, you got me on the killin'

floor




</l>
<l>God knows, I should-a been gone

</l>
<l>God knows, I should-a been gone

</l>
<l>No foolin' 'round wit' cha baby

</l>
<l>I let you put me on the killin' floor</l></lyrics></xml>
