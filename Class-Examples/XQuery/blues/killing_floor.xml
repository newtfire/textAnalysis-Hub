<lyrics>



I should-a quit you, along time ago

I should-a quit you, baby, along time ago

I should-a quit you baby, an' went on to Mexico



If I had-a followed, my first mind

If I had-a followed, my first mind

I would-a been gone, yeah, my second time



Yeah!



I should-a went on, when my friend come from Mexico an' me

I should-a went on baby, when my friend come from Mexico an' me

No foolin' 'round 'wit cha' darling, you got me on the killin'
floor



God knows, I should-a been gone

God knows, I should-a been gone

No foolin' 'round wit' cha baby

I let you put me on the killin' floor
