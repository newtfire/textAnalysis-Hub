<lyrics>



I wonder who, gonna be your sweet man when I'm gone?

I wonder who, gonna be your sweet man when I'm gone?

I wonder who you're gonna have to love you?

'Cause I won't ever stay at home



Who's that yonder come walkin', down the street?

She's the most beautiful girl any man would want to meet

I wonder who, gonna be your sweet man when I'm gone?

I wonder who you're gonna have to love you?

Because I won't ever be at home



You know I once have would-a married you?

But, you, you married too soon

I don't have no more break, darlin'

I'll see you after your honeymoon

I wonder who, gonna be your sweet man when I'm gone?

You know I ain't never gonna love you?

Because I won't ever stay at home
