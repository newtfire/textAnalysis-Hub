<l>I wonder who, gonna be your sweet man when I'm gone?

</l>
<l>I wonder who, gonna be your sweet man when I'm gone?

</l>
<l>I wonder who you're gonna have to love you?

</l>
<l>'Cause I won't ever stay at home



</l>
<l>Who's that yonder come walkin', down the street?

</l>
<l>She's the most beautiful girl any man would want to meet

</l>
<l>I wonder who, gonna be your sweet man when I'm gone?

</l>
<l>I wonder who you're gonna have to love you?

</l>
<l>Because I won't ever be at home



</l>
<l>You know I once have would-a married you?

</l>
<l>But, you, you married too soon

</l>
<l>I don't have no more break, darlin'

</l>
<l>I'll see you after your honeymoon

</l>
<l>I wonder who, gonna be your sweet man when I'm gone?

</l>
<l>You know I ain't never gonna love you?

</l>
<l>Because I won't ever stay at home</l></lyrics></xml>
