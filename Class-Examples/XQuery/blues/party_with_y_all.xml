<l>Now won't ya come on baby let me go out an party wit y'all

</l>
<l>I ain't got much money but we'll really, really have a ball



</l>
<l>You ain't got no date so you ain't got nothin' to lose

</l>
<l>You ain't got no date so you ain't got nothin' to lose

</l>
<l>We will find us a joint we gon' dance by some good old blues



</l>
<l>I played a gig last night

</l>

</l>
<l>Come on baby



</l>
<l>I ain't got much money but we'll really, really have a ball



</l>
<l>Come on baby

</l>
<l>Come on baby

</l>
<l>Come on baby

</l>
<l>Come on baby
