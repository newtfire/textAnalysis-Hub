<lyrics>



Now won't ya come on baby let me go out an party wit y'all

Now won't ya come on baby let me go out an party wit y'all

I ain't got much money but we'll really, really have a ball



You ain't got no date so you ain't got nothin' to lose

You ain't got no date so you ain't got nothin' to lose

We will find us a joint we gon' dance by some good old blues



I played a gig last night

I got paid with a check

The check bounced on me

Now I'm in an' awful wreck



But you come on baby we'll go out party wit' y'all

I ain't got much money but we'll really, really have a ball



Come on baby

Come on baby

Come on baby

Come on baby



I ain't got much money but we'll really, really have a ball



Come on baby

Come on baby

Come on baby

Come on baby



I ain't got much money but we'll really, really have a ball
