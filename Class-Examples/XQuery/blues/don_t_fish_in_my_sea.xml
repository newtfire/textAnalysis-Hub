<lyrics>

<l>My daddy come home this mornin', drunk as he could be

</l>
<l>My daddy come home this mornin', drunk as he could be

</l>
<l>I know that he's done got bad on me



</l>
<l>He used to stay out late, now he don't come home at all

</l>
<l>He used to stay out late, now he don't come home at all

</l>
<l>I know there's another mule
1
been kicking in my stable </l>

<l>If you don't like my ocean, don't fish in my sea

</l>
<l>If you don't like my ocean, don't fish in my sea

</l>
<l>Stay out of my valley, let my mountain be



</l>
<l>I ain't had no loving since God knows when

</l>
<l>I ain't had no loving since God knows when

</l>
<l>That's the reason I'm through with these no-good,
trifling
2
men </l>

<l>You'll never miss the sunshine till the rain begin to fall

</l>
<l>You'll never miss the sunshine till the rain begin to fall

</l>
<l>You'll never miss your ham till another mule be in your stall



</l>
<note>Note 1: mule, a hybrid between a horse and a donkey; especially the
offspring of a male donkey and a mare;

Note 2: trifling, to talk in a mocking manner or with intent to
delude or mislead, to treat someone or something as unimportant</note></lyrics></xml>
