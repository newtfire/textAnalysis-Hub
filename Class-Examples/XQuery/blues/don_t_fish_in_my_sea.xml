<lyrics>



My daddy come home this mornin', drunk as he could be

My daddy come home this mornin', drunk as he could be

I know that he's done got bad on me



He used to stay out late, now he don't come home at all

He used to stay out late, now he don't come home at all

I know there's another mule
1
 been kicking in my stable



If you don't like my ocean, don't fish in my sea

If you don't like my ocean, don't fish in my sea

Stay out of my valley, let my mountain be



I ain't had no loving since God knows when

I ain't had no loving since God knows when

That's the reason I'm through with these no-good,
trifling
2
 men



You'll never miss the sunshine till the rain begin to fall

You'll never miss the sunshine till the rain begin to fall

You'll never miss your ham till another mule be in your stall



__________

Note 1: mule, a hybrid between a horse and a donkey; especially the
offspring of a male donkey and a mare;

Note 2: trifling, to talk in a mocking manner or with intent to
delude or mislead, to treat someone or something as unimportant.
