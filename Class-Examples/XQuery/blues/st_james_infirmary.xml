<lyrics>


<l>I went down to old Joe's bar room, on the corner by the square</l>

<l>Well, the drinks were bein' served as usual, and this motley crowd
was there</l>



<l>Well, on my left stood Joe McKennedy, and his eyes were bloodshot
red</l>

<l>When he told me that sad story, these were the words he said:</l>



<l>I went down to the St. James infirmary, I saw my baby there</l>

<l>She was stretched out on a long white table, so cold, and fine, and
fair</l>

<l>Go ahead!</l>



<l>Let her go, let her go, God bless her, wherever she may be</l>

<l>She can search this world over, never find another man like me</l>



<l>Yes, sixteen coal black horses, to pull that rubber tied hack</l>

<l>Well, it's seventeen miles to the graveyard, but my baby's never
comin' back</l>



<l>Well, now you've heard my story, well, have another round of
booze</l>

<l>And if anyone should ever, ever ask you, I've got the St. James
infirmary blues!</l>
