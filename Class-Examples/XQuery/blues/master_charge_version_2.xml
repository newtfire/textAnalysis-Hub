<lyrics>


<l>My wife has a charge card

</l>
<l>Well, I got it the other day

</l>
<l>I owe five hundred dollars

</l>
<l>Yes, just for yesterday



</l>
<l>I said, "Honey, here's a present,

</l>
<l>go out an' shop around,

</l>
<l>get a couple a-dresses,

</l>
<l>an' browse around downtown"



</l>
<l>She did just what I told her,

</l>
<l>bought one, two or three

</l>
<l>Then came home lookin' silly

</l>
<l>Makin' goo-goo eyes at me



</l>
<l>Mastercharge (mastercharge), I'll break an' bury her card

</l>
<l>Mastercharge (mastercharge), I'll break an' bury her card

</l>
<l>Mastercharge (mastercharge), I'll break an' bury her card



</l>
<l>I said, "Did you get your dresses?"

</l>
<l>She said, "Yes, one or two,

</l>
<l>but I had to get me some shoes,

</l>
<l>an' I needed some jewelry, too"



</l>
<l>She had two hundred dollar dresses

</l>
<l>That I could-a made, an' I can't sew

</l>
<l>Fifty dollar pair a shoes,

</l>
<l>an' I thought you so an' so



</l>
<l>Said, "What about the jewelry?"

</l>
<l>As calmly as I could

</l>
<l>She said, "Honey, you'll love them,

</l>
<l>they're pure, African wood"



</l>
<l>Mastercharge (mastercharge), I'll break an' bury her card

</l>
<l>Mastercharge (mastercharge, heh-heh), I'll break an' bury her
card

</l>
<l>Mastercharge (go mastercharge on the thing), I'll break an' bury her

card




</l>
<l>Let's charge it, let's charge it!



</l>
<l>"They were two hundred dollars, an' I paid one an' a half!"



</l>
<l>I just didn't believe it, so mad, I just had to laugh

</l>
<l>I could see in my mind, on a horse like Paul Revere

</l>
<l>I hate to check my mailbox, 'cause these bills keep comin' here



</l>
<l>Mastercharge (mastercharge), I'll break an' bury her card

</l>
<l>Mastercharge (mastercharge), I'll break an' bury her card

</l>
<l>Mastercharge (mastercharge), I'll break an' bury her card



</l>
<l>Yeah, run up all my bills

</l>
<l>"Charge it!"

</l>
<l>Ev'ry time I look around, it's "charge, charge!"



</l>
<l>"Let's charge it!"

</l>
<l>All she can say



</l>
<l>"A let's charge it!"

</l>
<l>"Mastercharge!"

</l>
<l>"Oh, I have a Mastercharge!"

</l>
<l>"Oh, I have a BankAmericard, too!"

</l>
<l>"Mastercharge!"

</l>
<l>"Oh, would you mind chargin' it, please?"



</l>
<l>Now don't you get too much on it, now

</l>
<l>Get too much chargin', now



</l><l>"Let's charge it!"</l></lyrics></xml>
