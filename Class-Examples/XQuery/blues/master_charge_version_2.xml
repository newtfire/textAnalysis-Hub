<lyrics>



My wife has a charge card

Well, I got it the other day

I owe five hundred dollars

Yes, just for yesterday



I said, "Honey, here's a present,

go out an' shop around,

get a couple a-dresses,

an' browse around downtown"



She did just what I told her,

bought one, two or three

Then came home lookin' silly

Makin' goo-goo eyes at me



Mastercharge (mastercharge), I'll break an' bury her card

Mastercharge (mastercharge), I'll break an' bury her card

Mastercharge (mastercharge), I'll break an' bury her card



I said, "Did you get your dresses?"

She said, "Yes, one or two,

but I had to get me some shoes,

an' I needed some jewelry, too"



She had two hundred dollar dresses

That I could-a made, an' I can't sew

Fifty dollar pair a shoes,

an' I thought you so an' so



Said, "What about the jewelry?"

As calmly as I could

She said, "Honey, you'll love them,

they're pure, African wood"



Mastercharge (mastercharge), I'll break an' bury her card

Mastercharge (mastercharge, heh-heh), I'll break an' bury her
card

Mastercharge (go mastercharge on the thing), I'll break an' bury her
card



Let's charge it, let's charge it!



"They were two hundred dollars, an' I paid one an' a half!"



I just didn't believe it, so mad, I just had to laugh

I could see in my mind, on a horse like Paul Revere

I hate to check my mailbox, 'cause these bills keep comin' here



Mastercharge (mastercharge), I'll break an' bury her card

Mastercharge (mastercharge), I'll break an' bury her card

Mastercharge (mastercharge), I'll break an' bury her card



Yeah, run up all my bills

"Charge it!"

Ev'ry time I look around, it's "charge, charge!"



"Let's charge it!"

All she can say



"A let's charge it!"

"Mastercharge!"

"Oh, I have a Mastercharge!"

"Oh, I have a BankAmericard, too!"

"Mastercharge!"

"Oh, would you mind chargin' it, please?"



Now don't you get too much on it, now

Get too much chargin', now



"Let's charge it!"
