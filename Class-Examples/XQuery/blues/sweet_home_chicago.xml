<lyrics>



Come on, baby don't you wanna go?

Come on, baby don't you wanna go?

Back to the same old place, sweet home Chicago



One and one is two, two and two is four

Way I love the little girl, you'll never know

Come on, baby don't you wanna go?

Back to the same old place, sweet home Chicago



Four and two is six, six and two is eight

Look here baby don't you make me late

Cryin' hey, baby don't you wanna go?

Back to the same old place, sweet home Chicago



Come on baby, don't you wanna go?

Come on baby don't you wanna go?

Back to the same old place, sweet home Chicago
