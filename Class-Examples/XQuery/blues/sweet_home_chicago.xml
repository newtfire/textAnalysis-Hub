<l>Come on, baby don't you wanna go?

</l>
<l>Come on, baby don't you wanna go?

</l>
<l>Back to the same old place, sweet home Chicago



</l>
<l>One and one is two, two and two is four

</l>
<l>Way I love the little girl, you'll never know

</l>
<l>Come on, baby don't you wanna go?

</l>
<l>Back to the same old place, sweet home Chicago



</l>
<l>Four and two is six, six and two is eight

</l>
<l>Look here baby don't you make me late

</l>
<l>Cryin' hey, baby don't you wanna go?

</l>
<l>Back to the same old place, sweet home Chicago



</l>
<l>Come on baby, don't you wanna go?

</l>
<l>Come on baby don't you wanna go?

</l>
<l>Back to the same old place, sweet home Chicago</l></lyrics></xml>
