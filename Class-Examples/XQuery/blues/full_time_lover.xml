<lyrics>



Well, I found me, yes, I found me a full-time lover

Well, I found me, yes, I found me a full-time lover

Well, she used to be my part-time woman, but she's my full-time lover
now



Well, I work the graveyard shift, seven days a week

I'm so downhearted, I can't hardly even speak

I'll tell you the reason, the reason why I feel this way

I can't find a full-time love, yes, but I think I found one today



Well, I found me, Lord, I found me a full-time lover

Well, she used to be my part-time girl, man, but she's my full-time
lover now



Well, people you don't know, you don't know the shape I'm in

I ask her where she's goin', she tells me where she's been

She came home last night, thought she'd be goin' back out the
door

Then she told me "Baby, I ain't leavin' you no more"



Well, I found me, Lord, I found me a full-time lover

Well, she used to be my part-time girl, man. but she's my full-time
lover now
