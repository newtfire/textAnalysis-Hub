<lyrics>


<l>Well, I found me, yes, I found me a full-time lover

</l>
<l>Well, I found me, yes, I found me a full-time lover

</l>
<l>Well, she used to be my part-time woman, but she's my full-time lover

now




</l>
<l>Well, I work the graveyard shift, seven days a week

</l>
<l>I'm so downhearted, I can't hardly even speak

</l>
<l>I'll tell you the reason, the reason why I feel this way

</l>
<l>I can't find a full-time love, yes, but I think I found one today



</l>
<l>Well, I found me, Lord, I found me a full-time lover

</l>
<l>Well, she used to be my part-time girl, man, but she's my full-time

lover now




</l>
<l>Well, people you don't know, you don't know the shape I'm in

</l>
<l>I ask her where she's goin', she tells me where she's been

</l>
<l>She came home last night, thought she'd be goin' back out the
door

</l>
<l>Then she told me "Baby, I ain't leavin' you no more"



</l>
<l>Well, I found me, Lord, I found me a full-time lover

</l><l>Well, she used to be my part-time girl, man. but she's my full-time</l>
<l>lover now</l></lyrics></xml>
