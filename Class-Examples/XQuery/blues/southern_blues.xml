<lyrics>



House catch on fire and ain't no water 'round

If your house catch on fire, ain't no water 'round

Throw your trunk out the window, building, burn on down



I went to that gypsy to have my fortune told

I went to that gypsy to have my fortune told

He said, "Doggone you girlie, doggone your bad luck soul"



I turned around, went to that gypsy next door

I turned around, went to that gypsy next door

He said, "You'll get a man anywhere you'll go"



Let me be your rag doll until your Chinee comes

Let me be your rag doll till your Chinee comes

If she beats me ragging
1
, she's got to rag it some



__________

Note 1: ragging, teasing.
