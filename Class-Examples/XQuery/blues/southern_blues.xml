<lyrics>

<l>House catch on fire and ain't no water 'round

</l>
<l>If your house catch on fire, ain't no water 'round

</l>
<l>Throw your trunk out the window, building, burn on down



</l>
<l>I went to that gypsy to have my fortune told

</l>
<l>I went to that gypsy to have my fortune told

</l>
<l>He said, "Doggone you girlie, doggone your bad luck soul"



</l>
<l>I turned around, went to that gypsy next door

</l>
<l>I turned around, went to that gypsy next door

</l>
<l>He said, "You'll get a man anywhere you'll go"



</l>
<l>Let me be your rag doll until your Chinee comes

</l>
<l>Let me be your rag doll till your Chinee comes

</l>
<l>If she beats me ragging
1
, she's got to rag it some



</l>
<note>Note 1: ragging, teasing</note></lyrics></xml>
