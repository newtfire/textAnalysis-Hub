<l>It's a pity, oh it's a shame

</l>
<l>I caught my baby, hey hey, with another man

</l>
<l>Oh it's a pity, ooo it's a shame



</l>
<l>She told me she loved me

</l>
<l>I was her only man

</l>
<l>Why did she hurt me?

</l>
<l>Yeah, yeah I can't understand

</l>
<l>Ooo, it's a pity, ooo it's a shame, yeah



</l>
<l>She took all of my money

</l>
<l>All that I owned

</l>
<l>She wasn't happy, hey hey

</l>
<l>With my love alone

</l>
<l>Ooo, it's a pity, ooo-hoo it's a shame



</l>
<l>Wonder, can I get witness?

</l>
<l>Wonder, can I get a witness?

</l>
<l>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

</l>
<l>Wonder can I get a witness, it's a pity</l></lyrics></xml>
