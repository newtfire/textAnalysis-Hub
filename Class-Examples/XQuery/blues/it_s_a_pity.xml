<lyrics>



It's a pity, oh it's a shame

I caught my baby, hey hey, with another man

Oh it's a pity, ooo it's a shame



She told me she loved me

I was her only man

Why did she hurt me?

Yeah, yeah I can't understand

Ooo, it's a pity, ooo it's a shame, yeah



She took all of my money

All that I owned

She wasn't happy, hey hey

With my love alone

Ooo, it's a pity, ooo-hoo it's a shame



Wonder, can I get witness?

Wonder, can I get a witness?

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Wonder can I get a witness, it's a pity
