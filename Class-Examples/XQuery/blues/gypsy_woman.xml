<lyrics>



You know the gypsy woman told me that you your mother's
bad-luck child

You know the gypsy woman told me that you your mother's bad-luck
child

Well, you're having a good time now, but that'll be trouble after
while



Well, you know I went to a gypsy woman to have my fortune told

She say, "You better go back home son and peep through your, your key
hole"

You know the gypsy woman told me that you your mother's bad-luck
child

Well, you're having a good time now, but that'll be trouble after
while



Well, now, you know I went back home, I took the gypsy woman as she
said

I peeped through my keyhole and there was another man laying in my
bed

You know the gypsy woman told me that you your mother's bad-luck
child



Well, you're having a good time now, but that'll be trouble after
while

Note: this song was cut at the first recording session of Muddy
Waters for the Aristrocat label, the forerunner of the famous Chess
label. It was cut together with one more song, "
Little
Anna Mae
", and released in the spring of 1947. It wasn't a big
seller so Muddy couldn't quit his day job yet, driving a truck for
the Western Graves Company and delivering venetian blinds. Muddy
would have to wait until April 1948 before Aristocrat asked him to
record again.
