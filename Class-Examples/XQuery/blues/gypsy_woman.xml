<lyrics>


<l>You know the gypsy woman told me that you your mother's
bad-luck child

</l>
<l>You know the gypsy woman told me that you your mother's bad-luck
child

</l>
<l>Well, you're having a good time now, but that'll be trouble after

while




</l>
<l>Well, you know I went to a gypsy woman to have my fortune told

</l>
<l>She say, "You better go back home son and peep through your, your key
hole"

</l>
<l>You know the gypsy woman told me that you your mother's bad-luck
child

</l>
<l>Well, you're having a good time now, but that'll be trouble after

while




</l>
<l>Well, now, you know I went back home, I took the gypsy woman as she
said

</l>
<l>I peeped through my keyhole and there was another man laying in my
bed

</l>
<l>You know the gypsy woman told me that you your mother's bad-luck

child




</l>
<l>Well, you're having a good time now, but that'll be trouble after

while

<note>Note: this song was cut at the first recording session of Muddy
Waters for the Aristrocat label, the forerunner of the famous Chess
label. It was cut together with one more song, "
Little
Anna Mae
", and released in the spring of 1947. It wasn't a big
seller so Muddy couldn't quit his day job yet, driving a truck for
the Western Graves Company and delivering venetian blinds. Muddy
would have to wait until April 1948 before Aristocrat asked him to
record again.</note></lyrics></xml>
