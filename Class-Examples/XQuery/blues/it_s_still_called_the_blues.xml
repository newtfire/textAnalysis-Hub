People Got Money

Still Got problems

Got to the doctor

And try to solve them

Anyway you look at it

It's still called the blues



Baby needs new shoes

Mama needs a new dress

Daddy's out scufflin'

Tryin' to do his best

Anyway you look at it

It's still called the blues



Makes no difference

What you do or say

The blues might still

Come your way

Just when you think

Your trouble's about to end

Along comes something

And start it all over again



You party on a Saturday

Go to church on Sunday

Fun leaves you because

Gotta work on Monday

Anyway you look at it

It's still called the blues



Makes no difference

What you do or say

The blues might still

Come your way

Just when you think

Your trouble's about to end

Along comes something

And start it all over again



Ain't got no money

To pay the rent

Baby's gone

You spent your last cent

Mm, still called the blues

Still called the blues, y'all



Anyway you look at it

Makes no difference

What you do or say

The blues might still

Come your way

Just when you think

Your trouble's about to end

Along comes something

And start it all over again
