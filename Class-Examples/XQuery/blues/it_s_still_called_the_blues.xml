<l>People Got Money

</l>
<l>Still Got problems

</l>
<l>Got to the doctor

</l>
<l>And try to solve them

</l>
<l>Anyway you look at it

</l>
<l>It's still called the blues



</l>
<l>Baby needs new shoes

</l>
<l>Mama needs a new dress

</l>
<l>Daddy's out scufflin'

</l>
<l>Tryin' to do his best

</l>
<l>Anyway you look at it

</l>
<l>It's still called the blues



</l>
<l>Makes no difference

</l>
<l>What you do or say

</l>
<l>The blues might still

</l>
<l>Come your way

</l>
<l>Just when you think

</l>
<l>Your trouble's about to end

</l>
<l>Along comes something

</l>
<l>And start it all over again



</l>
<l>You party on a Saturday

</l>
<l>Go to church on Sunday

</l>
<l>Fun leaves you because

</l>
<l>Gotta work on Monday

</l>
<l>Anyway you look at it

</l>
<l>It's still called the blues



</l>
<l>Makes no difference

</l>
<l>What you do or say

</l>
<l>The blues might still

</l>
<l>Come your way

</l>
<l>Just when you think

</l>
<l>Your trouble's about to end

</l>
<l>Along comes something

</l>
<l>And start it all over again



</l>
<l>Ain't got no money

</l>
<l>To pay the rent

</l>
<l>Baby's gone

</l>
<l>You spent your last cent

</l>
<l>Mm, still called the blues

</l>
<l>Still called the blues, y'all



</l>
<l>Anyway you look at it

</l>
<l>Makes no difference

</l>
<l>What you do or say

</l>
<l>The blues might still

</l>
<l>Come your way

</l>
<l>Just when you think

</l>
<l>Your trouble's about to end

</l>
<l>Along comes something

</l>
<l>And start it all over again</l></lyrics></xml>
