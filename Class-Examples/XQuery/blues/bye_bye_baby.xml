<lyrics>


<l>You know I love you, can't stand the way you do

</l>
<l>You know I love you, can't stand the way you do

</l>
<l>Well, you tellin' me it's true now, an that's alright for you



</l>
<l>Bye-bye, baby baby, bye-bye

</l>
<l>Bye-bye, baby baby, bye-bye

</l>
<l>Bye-bye, baby baby, don't cry



</l>
<l>Sometimes I wonder, why don't you write to me?

</l>
<l>Sometimes I wonder, why don't you write to me?

</l>
<l>If I've been a bad fellow, I didn't intend to be



</l>
<l>Baby baby, come back home to me

</l>
<l>Baby baby, come back home to me

</l>
<l>You know I love ya baby, my old time 'used to be'</l></lyrics></xml>
