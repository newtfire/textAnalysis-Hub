<lyrics>



You know I love you, can't stand the way you do

You know I love you, can't stand the way you do

Well, you tellin' me it's true now, an that's alright for you



Bye-bye, baby baby, bye-bye

Bye-bye, baby baby, bye-bye

Bye-bye, baby baby, don't cry



Sometimes I wonder, why don't you write to me?

Sometimes I wonder, why don't you write to me?

If I've been a bad fellow, I didn't intend to be



Baby baby, come back home to me

Baby baby, come back home to me

You know I love ya baby, my old time 'used to be'
