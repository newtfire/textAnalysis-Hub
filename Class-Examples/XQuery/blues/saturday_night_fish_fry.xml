Now if you've ever been down to New Orleans

Then you can understand just what I mean

All thru the week it's quiet as a mouse

But on Saturday night they go from house to house

You don't have to pay the usual admission

If you're a cook, a waiter or a good musician

So if you happen to be just passin' by

Stop in at the Saturday Night Fish Fry



It was rockin', it was rockin'

You never seen such scufflin'

And shufflin' 'till the break of dawn

It was rockin', it was rockin'

You never seen such scufflin'

And shufflin' 'till the break of dawn



Now my buddy and me was on the main stem

Foolin' around just me and him

We decided we could use a little something to eat

So we went to a house on Rampart Street

We knocked on the door and it opened up with ease

And a lush little Miss said, "Come in, please"

And before we could even bat an eye

We were right in the middle of a big fish fry



It was rockin', it was rockin'

You never seen such scufflin'

And shufflin' 'till the break of dawn

It was rockin', it was rockin'

You never seen such scufflin'

And shufflin' 'till the break of dawn



Now the folks was havin' the time of their life

And Sam was jivin' Jimmie's wife

Over in the corner was a beat up grand

Being played by a big fat piano man

Some of the chicks wore expensive frocks

Some of them had on bobbie socks

But everybody was nice and high

At this particular Saturday Night Fish Fry



It was rockin', it was rockin'

You never seen such scufflin'

And shufflin' 'till the break of dawn

It was rockin', it was rockin'

You never seen such scufflin'

And shufflin' 'till the break of dawn



Now the women were screamin' and jumpin' and yellin'

The bottles was flyin', and the fish was smellin'

And way above all the noise we made

Somebody hollered, "You better get outta here, this is a raid!"

I didn't know we was breaking the law but

Somebody reached over and hit me on the jaw

Now they had us blocked off from front to back

And they was puttin' 'em in the wagon like potatoes in a sack



It was rockin', it was rockin'

You never seen such scufflin'

And shufflin' 'till the break of dawn

It was rockin', it was rockin'

You never seen such scufflin'

And shufflin' 'till the break of dawn



I knew I could get away if I had a chance

But I was shakin' like I had the St. Vitus dance

So I tried to crawl in under a bath tab

When a policeman said, "Where are you goin' there, bub?"

Now they got us out of there like a house on fire

And put us all in the black Maria

Now they might have missed a pitiful few

But they got both me and my buddy too



It was rockin', it was rockin'

You never seen such scufflin'

And shufflin' 'till the break of dawn

It was rockin', it was rockin'

You never seen such scufflin'

And shufflin' 'till the break of dawn



Well we headed for jail in a dazed condition

They booked each one of us on suspicion

Now my chick came down and paid my bail

And finally got me outta that rotten jail

Now if you ever want to get a fist in your eye

Just mention a Saturday Night Fish Fry

I don't care how many fish in the sea

But don't ever mention a fish to me



It was rockin', it was rockin'

You never seen such scufflin'

And shufflin' 'till the break of dawn

It was rockin', it was rockin'

You never seen such scufflin'

And shufflin' 'till the break of dawn
