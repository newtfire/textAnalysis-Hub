<lyrics>



One of these days an' it won't be long, yeah

You gonna look for me an' I'll be gone



I believe, I say I believe right now

Hey, hey, hey, baby

You tryin' to make a fool of me, now



You goin' 'round here with your head so hard, yeah

I think I'm gonna have to use my rod



I believe, I say I believe right now

Hey, hey, hey, baby

You tryin' to make a fool of me, now



Now last night you were dreamin' when I heard you say, yeah

"Ho Johnny", when you know my name is Ray



I believe, I say I believe right now, yeah

Woah-oh-oh, baby

You're tryin' to make a fool of me, now



Oh!



You're gonna 'round here with your head so hard, yeah

I think I'm gonna have to use my rod



I believe, I say I believe right now, yeah

Hey, hey, hey baby

You're tryin' to make a fool of me now, hey



Yeah!



Thank you!

Thank you very much!
