<lyrics>

<l>I think I'm gonna have to move, people

</l>
<l>I gotta move out of my neighborhood

</l>
<l>Hey, I said I'm gonna have to move

</l>
<l>I gotta get out of my neighborhood

</l>
<l>Because you see

</l>
<l>The women they tell lies on me

</l>
<l>And the men they just don't mean me

</l>
<l>No doggone good



</l>
<l>Every time my telephone rings

</l>
<l>Some lady trying to play

</l>
<l>Some old funny game on me

</l>
<l>Every time my telephone rings

</l>
<l>Some lady trying to play

</l>
<l>Some old funny game on me

</l>
<l>And every time my front doorbell rings

</l>
<l>Some angry six foot man

</l>
<l>With a knife in his hand



</l>
<l>They say I'm in love with a woman

</l>
<l>That works down at the Chicken Shack

</l>
<l>They say Deacon Jones' wife

</l>
<l>Gave me a brand new Cadillac

</l>
<l>That's why I gotta move

</l>
<l>I gotta get out of my neighborhood

</l>
<l>I tell you the people

</l>
<l>They tell lies on me

</l>
<l>Hey, they just don't mean me

</l>
<l>No doggone good



</l>
<l>My landlady came by my apartment

</l>
<l>She came by just to make up my bed

</l>
<l>But it took her all night long

</l>
<l>Can you imagine what the neighbors said

</l>
<l>That's why I gotta move

</l>
<l>Hey, I gotta get out

</l>
<l>Of my neighborhood

</l>
<l>I tell you the people

</l>
<l>They tell lies on me

</l>
<l>Hey, they just don't mean me

</l>
<l>No doggone good



</l>
<l>Hey, I gotta move

</l>
<l>Hey, I gotta move

</l>
<l>I gotta move

</l>
<l>I gotta move



</l>
<l>Hey, the people, the people

</l>
<l>Don't like me here, people

</l>
<l>Oh you know they just don't mean me

</l>
<l>No doggone good



</l>
<l>Nobody loves me but my mother

</l>
<l>Sometimes I think

</l>
<l>She could be jiving, too

</l>
<l>Hey, nobody

</l>
<l>Nobody loves me but my mother

</l>
<l>And she could be jiving, too

</l>
<l>Now I think you know

</l>
<l>Why I act funny, baby

</l>
<l>Oh when you do the things you do
