I think I'm gonna have to move, people

I gotta move out of my neighborhood

Hey, I said I'm gonna have to move

I gotta get out of my neighborhood

Because you see

The women they tell lies on me

And the men they just don't mean me

No doggone good



Every time my telephone rings

Some lady trying to play

Some old funny game on me

Every time my telephone rings

Some lady trying to play

Some old funny game on me

And every time my front doorbell rings

Some angry six foot man

With a knife in his hand



They say I'm in love with a woman

That works down at the Chicken Shack

They say Deacon Jones' wife

Gave me a brand new Cadillac

That's why I gotta move

I gotta get out of my neighborhood

I tell you the people

They tell lies on me

Hey, they just don't mean me

No doggone good



My landlady came by my apartment

She came by just to make up my bed

But it took her all night long

Can you imagine what the neighbors said

That's why I gotta move

Hey, I gotta get out

Of my neighborhood

I tell you the people

They tell lies on me

Hey, they just don't mean me

No doggone good



Hey, I gotta move

Hey, I gotta move

I gotta move

I gotta move



Hey, the people, the people

Don't like me here, people

Oh you know they just don't mean me

No doggone good



Nobody loves me but my mother

Sometimes I think

She could be jiving, too

Hey, nobody

Nobody loves me but my mother

And she could be jiving, too

Now I think you know

Why I act funny, baby

Oh when you do the things you do
