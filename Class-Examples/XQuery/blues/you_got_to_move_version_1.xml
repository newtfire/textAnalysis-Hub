<lyrics>


<l>You got to move, you got to move,

</l>
<l>you got to move child, you got to move

</l>
<l>But when the Lord gets ready, you got to move



</l>
<l>You may be high, you may be low

</l>
<l>You may be rich, child, you may be poor

</l>
<l>But when the Lord gets ready, you got to move



</l>
<l>You see that woman, that walk the street

</l>
<l>You see the policeman, out on his beat

</l>
<l>But when the Lord gets ready, they got to move



</l>
<l>You got to move, you got to move,

</l>
<l>you got to move child, you got to move

</l>
<l>But when the Lord gets ready, you got to move</l></lyrics></xml>
