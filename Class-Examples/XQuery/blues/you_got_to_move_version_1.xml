<lyrics>



You got to move, you got to move,

you got to move child, you got to move

But when the Lord gets ready, you got to move



You may be high, you may be low

You may be rich, child, you may be poor

But when the Lord gets ready, you got to move



You see that woman, that walk the street

You see the policeman, out on his beat

But when the Lord gets ready, they got to move



You got to move, you got to move,

you got to move child, you got to move

But when the Lord gets ready, you got to move
