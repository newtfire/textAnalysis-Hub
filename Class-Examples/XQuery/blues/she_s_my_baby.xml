<lyrics>


<l>I've got a right to love my baby

</l>
<l>Oh, she treats me just like a king

</l>
<l>Hey, I've got a right to love my baby

</l>
<l>I said she treats me just like a king

</l>
<l>Oh, she eases my mind, body and soul

</l>
<l>My baby, she can do most anything



</l>
<l>Oh, she's my doctor when I'm sick, people

</l>
<l>She's my all around standby

</l>
<l>Hey, she's my lawyer when I'm in trouble

</l>
<l>And she's my mother when I wanna cry

</l>
<l>I've got a right to love my baby

</l>
<l>Hey, can't you see the reason why?



</l>
<l>That gives me a right to love my baby

</l>
<l>She's always here by my side

</l>
<l>Hey, my sweet undersanding baby

</l>
<l>She makes my temperature rise

</l>
<l>And when it comes to kind treatment people

</l>
<l>My baby's an angel in disguise



</l>
<l>Well, when I'm sick she's my doctor

</l>
<l>When I'm well she's my pride and joy

</l>
<l>Hey, when I'm cold

</l>
<l>When I'm cold she's my cover

</l>
<l>And she calls me "my little baby boy"

</l>
<l>When I'm tired and wanna play, people

</l>
<l>It's my baby that's my toy



</l>
