<lyrics>



I've got a right to love my baby

Oh, she treats me just like a king

Hey, I've got a right to love my baby

I said she treats me just like a king

Oh, she eases my mind, body and soul

My baby, she can do most anything



Oh, she's my doctor when I'm sick, people

She's my all around standby

Hey, she's my lawyer when I'm in trouble

And she's my mother when I wanna cry

I've got a right to love my baby

Hey, can't you see the reason why?



That gives me a right to love my baby

She's always here by my side

Hey, my sweet undersanding baby

She makes my temperature rise

And when it comes to kind treatment people

My baby's an angel in disguise



Well, when I'm sick she's my doctor

When I'm well she's my pride and joy

Hey, when I'm cold

When I'm cold she's my cover

And she calls me "my little baby boy"

When I'm tired and wanna play, people

It's my baby that's my toy
