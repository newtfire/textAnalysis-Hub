<lyrics>


<l>Well I pulled out of Pittsburgh,

</l>
<l>rolling down the eastern sea border

</l>
<l>I got my rig so wound up,

</l>
<l>and she's running like never before

</l>
<l>There's a speed zone ahead on my right,

</l>
<l>but I don't see a cop in sight

</l>
<l>Six days on the road and I'm gonna make it home tonight



</l>
<l>Well my rig's a little low,

</l>
<l>but that don't mean that she's slow

</l>
<l>There a flame from her stack,

</l>
<l>blowing smoke as black as coal

</l>
<l>My hotel's comin' in sight,

</l>
<l>if you think I'm happy all right

</l>
<l>Six days on the road and I'm gonna make it home tonight



</l>
<l>I've got ten forward gears,

</l>
<l>and a sweet Georgia overdrive

</l>
<l>I got the pedal to the metal,

</l>
<l>and my eyes are open wide

</l>
<l>I just passed a Jimmy in white,

</l>
<l>I've been passing everything in sight

</l>
<l>Six days on the road and I gotta see my baby tonight



</l>
<l>The ICC is checking on down the line,

</l>
<l>I'm a little hung over

</l>
<l>And my log book is way behind,

</l>
<l>but nothing bothers me tonight

</l>
<l>Just I can dodge them scales alright

</l>
<l>Six days on the road and I'm gonna make it home tonight



</l>
<l>Yeah, it seems like a year since I kissed my baby bye bye,

</l>
<l>I can have a lot of chicks but I'm not like some other guys

</l>
<l>Yes, I can find one to hold me tight,

</l>
<l>but you know it wouldn't be alright

</l>
<l>Six days on the road and I'm gonna make it home tonight



</l>
<l>I pulled out of Pittsburgh,

</l>
<l>rolling down the eastern sea border

</l>
<l>I got my rig wound up,

</l>
<l>and she's running like never before

</l>
<l>There's a speed zone ahead on my right,

</l>
<l>but I can dodge the law all night

</l>
<l>Six days on the road and I'm gonna make it home tonight

</l>
<l>Six days on the road and I gotta see my baby tonight</l></lyrics></xml>
