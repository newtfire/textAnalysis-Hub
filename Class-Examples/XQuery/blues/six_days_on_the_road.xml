<lyrics>



Well I pulled out of Pittsburgh,

rolling down the eastern sea border

I got my rig so wound up,

and she's running like never before

There's a speed zone ahead on my right,

but I don't see a cop in sight

Six days on the road and I'm gonna make it home tonight



Well my rig's a little low,

but that don't mean that she's slow

There a flame from her stack,

blowing smoke as black as coal

My hotel's comin' in sight,

if you think I'm happy all right

Six days on the road and I'm gonna make it home tonight



I've got ten forward gears,

and a sweet Georgia overdrive

I got the pedal to the metal,

and my eyes are open wide

I just passed a Jimmy in white,

I've been passing everything in sight

Six days on the road and I gotta see my baby tonight



The ICC is checking on down the line,

I'm a little hung over

And my log book is way behind,

but nothing bothers me tonight

Just I can dodge them scales alright

Six days on the road and I'm gonna make it home tonight



Yeah, it seems like a year since I kissed my baby bye bye,

I can have a lot of chicks but I'm not like some other guys

Yes, I can find one to hold me tight,

but you know it wouldn't be alright

Six days on the road and I'm gonna make it home tonight



I pulled out of Pittsburgh,

rolling down the eastern sea border

I got my rig wound up,

and she's running like never before

There's a speed zone ahead on my right,

but I can dodge the law all night

Six days on the road and I'm gonna make it home tonight

Six days on the road and I gotta see my baby tonight
