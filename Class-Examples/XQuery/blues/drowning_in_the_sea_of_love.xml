<lyrics>


<l>I've been down one time

</l>
<l>And I've been down two times

</l>
<l>But right now I'm drowning

</l>
<l>Drowning in the sea of love



</l>
<l>I've been out here so very long

</l>
<l>I done lost all my direction

</l>
<l>Baby, when you came my way

</l>
<l>Thought I had found my protection

</l>
<l>But a strong wind came into my life

</l>
<l>It surely took me by surprise

</l>
<l>I can't seem to control these tears

</l>
<l>That's falling from my eyes



</l>
<l>I've been down one time

</l>
<l>And I've been down two times

</l>
<l>But right now I'm drowning

</l>
<l>Drowning in the sea of love



</l>
<l>Sea of love



</l>
<l>Baby, I depended on you

</l>
<l>For the love navigation

</l>
<l>But now you've gone and deserted me

</l>
<l>Can't you see that I'm in desperation

</l>
<l>I'm in the middle of a bad love storm

</l>
<l>And it's bad as it can be

</l>
<l>I look around, all I can see

</l>
<l>Is water coming down over me



</l>
<l>I've been down one time

</l>
<l>And I've been down two times

</l>
<l>But right now I'm drowning

</l>
<l>Drowning in the sea of love



</l>
<l>Sea of love, sea of love



</l>
<l>I've been down one time

</l>
<l>And I've been down two times

</l>
<l>But right now I'm drowning

</l>
<l>Drowning in the sea of love



</l>
<l>Sea of love

</l>
<l>But right now I'm just drowning

</l>
<l>Drowning in the sea of love

</l>
<l>A sea of love, sea of love</l></lyrics></xml>
