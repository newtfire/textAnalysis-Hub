<lyrics>



I've been down one time

And I've been down two times

But right now I'm drowning

Drowning in the sea of love



I've been out here so very long

I done lost all my direction

Baby, when you came my way

Thought I had found my protection

But a strong wind came into my life

It surely took me by surprise

I can't seem to control these tears

That's falling from my eyes



I've been down one time

And I've been down two times

But right now I'm drowning

Drowning in the sea of love



Sea of love



Baby, I depended on you

For the love navigation

But now you've gone and deserted me

Can't you see that I'm in desperation

I'm in the middle of a bad love storm

And it's bad as it can be

I look around, all I can see

Is water coming down over me



I've been down one time

And I've been down two times

But right now I'm drowning

Drowning in the sea of love



Sea of love, sea of love



I've been down one time

And I've been down two times

But right now I'm drowning

Drowning in the sea of love



Sea of love

But right now I'm just drowning

Drowning in the sea of love

A sea of love, sea of love
