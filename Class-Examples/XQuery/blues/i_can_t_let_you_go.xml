<lyrics>



What did I do wrong, baby

I tried to keep you satisfied

Whenever you needed me

I was right there by your side

Now tell me

What's the reason, baby

What's the reason

You're leaving me



I ain't got nobody else

Baby, it's always been you

'Cause there ain't nobody

Ain't nobody else

Can make me feel the way you do

I love you, I love you

I love you so, baby

You know I just can't

I just can't let you go
