<lyrics>


<l>What did I do wrong, baby

</l>
<l>I tried to keep you satisfied

</l>
<l>Whenever you needed me

</l>
<l>I was right there by your side

</l>
<l>Now tell me

</l>
<l>What's the reason, baby

</l>
<l>What's the reason

</l>
<l>You're leaving me



</l>
<l>I ain't got nobody else

</l>
<l>Baby, it's always been you

</l>
<l>'Cause there ain't nobody

</l>
<l>Ain't nobody else

</l>
<l>Can make me feel the way you do

</l>
<l>I love you, I love you

</l>
<l>I love you so, baby

</l>
<l>You know I just can't

</l>
<l>I just can't let you go</l></lyrics></xml>
