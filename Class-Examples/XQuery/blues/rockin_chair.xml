<lyrics>



I ain't gonna be, I ain't gonna be, babe, your fool no
more

I ain't gonna be, be, no, no, I ain't gonna be, be, your fool no
more

I'm so tired, so tired, babe, being your slave, both night and
day



I'm sittin' here rockin', rockin' rockin' rockin'

Rockin' these blues away, tryin' so hard

I'm tryin' so hard, so hard rock these blues away,

in my rockin' chair, my old time rockin' chair, rockin' chair

Lord, have mercy



I believe, I believe, my woman seeing someone else

I believe, I believe, I believe, she's seeing someone else

All I can do, all I can do, all I can do, rock in my old time rockin'
chair

Have mercy!

Rockin', rockin', rockin', rockin', rockin' in' these blues away

I tried so hard, tried, tried, tried, rock these blues out of my
mind



All my friends tell me, tell me, I just waste my tears on you

All my friends tell me, tell, tell me, tell me, tell me, I just waste
my tears on you

No, no, no, no, no, no

Gonna keep on trying, keep on try, tryin' to rock these blues
away



Rock these blues away

Rock me on, hmm, hmm

hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm

Rock these blues, rock these blues away from me
