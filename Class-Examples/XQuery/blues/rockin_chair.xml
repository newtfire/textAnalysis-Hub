<l>I ain't gonna be, I ain't gonna be, babe, your fool no
more

</l>
<l>I ain't gonna be, be, no, no, I ain't gonna be, be, your fool no
more

</l>
<l>I'm so tired, so tired, babe, being your slave, both night and

day




</l>
<l>I'm sittin' here rockin', rockin' rockin' rockin'

</l>
<l>Rockin' these blues away, tryin' so hard

</l>
<l>I'm tryin' so hard, so hard rock these blues away,

</l>
<l>in my rockin' chair, my old time rockin' chair, rockin' chair

</l>
<l>Lord, have mercy



</l>
<l>I believe, I believe, my woman seeing someone else

</l>
<l>I believe, I believe, I believe, she's seeing someone else

</l>
<l>All I can do, all I can do, all I can do, rock in my old time rockin'
chair

</l>
<l>Have mercy!

</l>
<l>Rockin', rockin', rockin', rockin', rockin' in' these blues away

</l>
<l>I tried so hard, tried, tried, tried, rock these blues out of my

mind




</l>
<l>All my friends tell me, tell me, I just waste my tears on you

</l>
<l>All my friends tell me, tell, tell me, tell me, tell me, I just waste
my tears on you

</l>
<l>No, no, no, no, no, no

</l>
<l>Gonna keep on trying, keep on try, tryin' to rock these blues

away




</l>
<l>Rock these blues away

</l>
<l>Rock me on, hmm, hmm

</l>
<l>hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm

</l>
<l>Rock these blues, rock these blues away from me</l></lyrics></xml>
