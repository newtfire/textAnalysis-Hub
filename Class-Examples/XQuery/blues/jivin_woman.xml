<l>Jivin' woman, it's time you changed your way

</l>
<l>Hey, I'm talkin' to you 
jivin'

</l>
<l>woman, it's time you changed your way

</l>
<l>Well you better hurry baby, someone else will take your place



</l>
<l>Seven days in a week, not one you stay at home

</l>
<l>Seven days in a week baby and not one you stay at home

</l>
<l>What you doin' jivin' woman, baby you know that I know is wrong



</l>
<l>I heard some people talkin', and I heard them all say

</l>
<l>That all you wanted me for, was to give you all a my pay

</l>
<l>But now you're tellin' me, not a word they say is true

</l>
<l>Well you better be right jivin' woman, 'cause I'll do something to

</l>
<l>Jivin' woman, I done told you change your way

</l>
<l>Well you better hurry baby, someone else will take your place</l></lyrics></xml>
