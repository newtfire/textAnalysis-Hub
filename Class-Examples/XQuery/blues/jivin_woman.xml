<lyrics>



Jivin' woman, it's time you changed your way

Hey, I'm talkin' to you 
jivin'

woman, it's time you changed your way

Well you better hurry baby, someone else will take your place



Seven days in a week, not one you stay at home

Seven days in a week baby and not one you stay at home

What you doin' jivin' woman, baby you know that I know is wrong



I heard some people talkin', and I heard them all say

That all you wanted me for, was to give you all a my pay

But now you're tellin' me, not a word they say is true

Well you better be right jivin' woman, 'cause I'll do something to
you

Jivin' woman, I done told you change your way

Well you better hurry baby, someone else will take your place
