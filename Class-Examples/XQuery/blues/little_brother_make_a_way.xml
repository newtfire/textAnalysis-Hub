<lyrics>



(Spoken:

Now all a-you young folks, ravin'

An' hollerin' about how bad you wanna be free



But let me tell ya what it was like in my day

For an' old man like me

Are you ready? (yeah))



Take it on, little brother, an'make a way

I said, take it on little brother, take it further



Now I had to work, ev'ryday

On my job, I didn't get much pay

Had to say 'yes sir' to the other man

I was too confused, to understand



I had to things, yeah, against my will

If I hadn't looked further

You wouldn't have made it



Take it on, little brother, take it further

I said take it on, little brother an' make a way



Now you've got the future, in your hand

Now don't you be, no lazy man

We laid the ground, an' made the way for you

Come on an'show us, that you're proud of us



You have a hard, time to get through

But keep on pushin', we're right behind you



Take it on, little brother, take it further

I said take it on, little brother an' make a way



Take it on, little brother, an'make a way

I said, take it on, little brother, an'take it further



Uh, now I had to work, ev'ryday

On my job, I didn't get much pay

Had to say 'yes sir', to other man

I was too confused, to understand

I had to do things, yeah against my will

If I hadn't of moved further, you wouldn't have made it



Take it on, little brother, take it further, yeah, um!

I said take it on, little brother, an' make a way
