Everyday, everyday I have the blues

Ooh everyday, everyday I have the blues

When you see me worryin' baby, yeah, it's you I hate to lose



Whoa, nobody loves me, nobody seems to care

Whoa, nobody loves me, nobody seems to care

Well worries and trouble darling, babe you know I've had my share



Everyday, everyday, everyday, everyday,

everyday, everyday I have the blues

When you see me worryin' baby, yeah, it's you I hate to lose



Whoa nobody loves me, nobody seems to care

Whoa nobody loves me, nobody seems to care

Well worries and trouble darling, babe you know I've had my share
