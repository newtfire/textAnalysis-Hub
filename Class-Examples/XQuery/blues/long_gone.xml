<lyrics>



One of these days, you know it won't be long,

you'll look for me and baby I'll be long gone

I'll be down the road

You'll look for me,

but me you won't see



Yeah, one of these days, you know the time is near,

you'll look for me, but baby I won't be here

I'm gonna be long gone

You'll look for me,

but me you won't see



Yeah, one of these days, you're gonna wake up and find,

this lonesome boy has changed his cotton-picking mind

He's gonna be long gone

You'll look for he,

but he you won't see

Long gone!

Long gone!

Long gone!

Long gone!



You'll look for me, and me you won't see
