<lyrics>


<l>One of these days, you know it won't be long,

</l>
<l>you'll look for me and baby I'll be long gone

</l>
<l>I'll be down the road

</l>
<l>You'll look for me,

</l>
<l>but me you won't see



</l>
<l>Yeah, one of these days, you know the time is near,

</l>
<l>you'll look for me, but baby I won't be here

</l>
<l>I'm gonna be long gone

</l>
<l>You'll look for me,

</l>
<l>but me you won't see



</l>
<l>Yeah, one of these days, you're gonna wake up and find,

</l>
<l>this lonesome boy has changed his cotton-picking mind

</l>
<l>He's gonna be long gone

</l>
<l>You'll look for he,

</l>
<l>but he you won't see

</l>
<l>Long gone!

</l>
<l>Long gone!

</l>
<l>Long gone!

</l>
<l>Long gone!



</l>
<l>You'll look for me, and me you won't see</l></lyrics></xml>
