<lyrics>


<l>Yes they call me the rocker, I can rock you all night long

</l>
<l>Yes they call me the rocker, I can rock you all night long

</l>
<l>I can let you down easy, when I think your money's gone



</l>
<l>I can rock you easy, don't want you to hesitate

</l>
<l>I can rock you easy, don't want you to hesitate

</l>
<l>I can let you down easy, like-a like jelly on a plate



</l>
<l>Some twistin' and shakin', don't mean a thing to me

</l>
<l>Some twistin' and the shakes, don't mean a thing to me

</l>
<l>I'm a hip shakin' daddy, I can shake like a willow tree



</l>
<l>They call me the rocker, I can really rock a while

</l>
<l>They call me the rocker, I can really rock a while

</l>
<l>With a real gone mama, don't let me fake your style



</l>
<l>I can rock you easy, you don't want to hesitate

</l>
<l>I can rock you easy, you don't want to hesitate

</l>
<l>I can let you down easy, like jelly on a plate</l></lyrics></xml>
