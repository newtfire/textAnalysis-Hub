<lyrics>



Yes they call me the rocker, I can rock you all night long

Yes they call me the rocker, I can rock you all night long

I can let you down easy, when I think your money's gone



I can rock you easy, don't want you to hesitate

I can rock you easy, don't want you to hesitate

I can let you down easy, like-a like jelly on a plate



Some twistin' and shakin', don't mean a thing to me

Some twistin' and the shakes, don't mean a thing to me

I'm a hip shakin' daddy, I can shake like a willow tree



They call me the rocker, I can really rock a while

They call me the rocker, I can really rock a while

With a real gone mama, don't let me fake your style



I can rock you easy, you don't want to hesitate

I can rock you easy, you don't want to hesitate

I can let you down easy, like jelly on a plate
