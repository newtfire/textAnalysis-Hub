<lyrics>



It don't matter if you're rich

It don't make no difference if you're poor

Simple things in life can make you mad to the core

It doesn't matter if you're young

Don't make no difference if you're old

You got to stand a little rain

Before you reach a pot of gold



Chorus:

Everybody gets the blues

Everybody got to cry

Take the good with the bad

Take the lows and the high

Well you work and you worry

Spend you life paying dues

Everybody has a hard time sometime

Everybody gets the blues



Ain't no different for a woman

Than it is for a man

Everybody goes dancing

Everybody pays the band

Everybody got to take

Everybody got to give

Everybody got to live



Everybody gets the blues

Everybody got to cry

Take the good with the bad

Take the lows and the high

Well you work and you worry

Spend you life paying dues

Everybody has a hard time sometime

Everybody gets the blues



Don't matter if you're fat

Don't matter if you're thin

Everybody got to lose

Everybody got to win

Don't matter if you're black

Don't matter if you're white

You know you got to get it wrong

To have a chance to make it right



Everybody gets the blues

Everybody got to cry

Take the good with the bad

Take the lows and the high

Well you work and you worry

Spend you life paying dues

Everybody has a hard time sometime

Everybody gets the blues
