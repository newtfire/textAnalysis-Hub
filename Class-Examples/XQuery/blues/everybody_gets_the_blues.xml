<lyrics>


<l>It don't matter if you're rich

</l>
<l>It don't make no difference if you're poor

</l>
<l>Simple things in life can make you mad to the core

</l>
<l>It doesn't matter if you're young

</l>
<l>Don't make no difference if you're old

</l>
<l>You got to stand a little rain

</l>
<l>Before you reach a pot of gold



</l>
<l>Chorus:

</l>
<l>Everybody gets the blues

</l>
<l>Everybody got to cry

</l>
<l>Take the good with the bad

</l>
<l>Take the lows and the high

</l>
<l>Well you work and you worry

</l>
<l>Spend you life paying dues

</l>
<l>Everybody has a hard time sometime

</l>
<l>Everybody gets the blues



</l>
<l>Ain't no different for a woman

</l>
<l>Than it is for a man

</l>
<l>Everybody goes dancing

</l>
<l>Everybody pays the band

</l>
<l>Everybody got to take

</l>
<l>Everybody got to give

</l>
<l>Everybody got to live



</l>
<l>Everybody gets the blues

</l>
<l>Everybody got to cry

</l>
<l>Take the good with the bad

</l>
<l>Take the lows and the high

</l>
<l>Well you work and you worry

</l>
<l>Spend you life paying dues

</l>
<l>Everybody has a hard time sometime

</l>
<l>Everybody gets the blues



</l>
<l>Don't matter if you're fat

</l>
<l>Don't matter if you're thin

</l>
<l>Everybody got to lose

</l>
<l>Everybody got to win

</l>
<l>Don't matter if you're black

</l>
<l>Don't matter if you're white

</l>
<l>You know you got to get it wrong

</l>
<l>To have a chance to make it right



</l>
<l>Everybody gets the blues

</l>
<l>Everybody got to cry

</l>
<l>Take the good with the bad

</l>
<l>Take the lows and the high

</l>
<l>Well you work and you worry

</l>
<l>Spend you life paying dues

</l>
<l>Everybody has a hard time sometime

</l><l>Everybody gets the blues</l></lyrics></xml>
