<lyrics>


<l>Tell me, milk cow, what on earth is wrong with you?

</l>
<l>Tell me, milk cow, what on earth is wrong with you?

</l>
<l>Well, well, you have a new calf, hoo hoo, and your milk is turnin'

blue




</l>
<l>Your calf is hungry, and I believe he needs a suck

</l>
<l>(spoken: Now, you know that calf done got hungry)

</l>
<l>Your calf is hungry, and I believe he needs a suck

</l>
<l>Well, now, but the milk is turnin' blue, hoo hoo, and I believe he's

outta luck




</l>
<l>Now I feel like milkin' and my, cow won't come

</l>
<l>I feel like churnin' it and my, milk won't turn

</l>
<l>I'm cryin' plea-hease, please, don't do me wrong

</l>
<l>You can give-a right milk and butter, now, baby, you-hoo, will stay

at home




</l>
<l>My milk cow been 

ramblin'
,
hoo hoo, for miles around


</l>
<l>My milk cow been ramblin', hoo hoo, for miles around

</l>
<l>She been troublin' some other bull cow, hoo hoo

</l>
<l>Lord, in this man's town
