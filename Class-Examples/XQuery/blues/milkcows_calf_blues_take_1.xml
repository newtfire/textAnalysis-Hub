<lyrics>



Tell me, milk cow, what on earth is wrong with you?

Tell me, milk cow, what on earth is wrong with you?

Well, well, you have a new calf, hoo hoo, and your milk is turnin'
blue



Your calf is hungry, and I believe he needs a suck

(spoken: Now, you know that calf done got hungry)

Your calf is hungry, and I believe he needs a suck

Well, now, but the milk is turnin' blue, hoo hoo, and I believe he's
outta luck



Now I feel like milkin' and my, cow won't come

I feel like churnin' it and my, milk won't turn

I'm cryin' plea-hease, please, don't do me wrong

You can give-a right milk and butter, now, baby, you-hoo, will stay
at home



My milk cow been 
ramblin'
,
hoo hoo, for miles around

My milk cow been ramblin', hoo hoo, for miles around

She been troublin' some other bull cow, hoo hoo

Lord, in this man's town



__________

Note: this song is probably derived form Kokomo Arnold's first
release and very popular song 
Milk Cow Blues
, recorded in
1934.
