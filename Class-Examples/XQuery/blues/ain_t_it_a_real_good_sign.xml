<lyrics>



Man, when ya woman kiss ya

An' hold ya real tight

Catch you back tonight

With all-a her might



She whisper words

She never said befo'

You should know by then, mister

Why you got to go



Ain't that a real good sign?

I believe in it now

Ain't that a real good sign? oh yes it is

Ain't that a real good sign? oh yeah



Gonna make-a little love

(Make a little love)

Gonna make-a little love

(Make a little love)



Girl, when your man come home

Ev'ryday from work

He jump in the bath tub

A-wash away the dirt



Oh an' it seems the same man

That come right straight to you

You should know by then, girl

What you got to do



Ain't that a real good sign? oh yeah

Ain't that a real good sign? I believe in it now

Ain't that a real good sign? yeah-hey



Wanna make a little love

(Make a little love)

Wanna make a little love

(Make a little love)



(I wanna make a little love)

(I wanna make a little love)



(I wanna make a little love)

(I wanna make a little love)



Back in my bed

An' I get the urge to roam

I go out in the streets

But I always come back home



Late at night

I knocked upon your door

Should know right then

I'd come right back for more



Ain't that a real good sign? oh yes it is

Ain't that a real good sign?

I believe in it now

Ain't that a real good sign?

Hey-hey



Babe, I wanna make love

(Make a little love)

Oh yeah

(Make a little love)

I wanna make love

Woo!



(I wanna make a little love)

(I wanna make a little love)



(I wanna make a little love)

(I wanna make a little love)



Fading:

(I wanna make a little love)

(I wanna make a little love)
