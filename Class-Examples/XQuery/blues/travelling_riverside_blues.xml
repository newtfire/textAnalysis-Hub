<l>
If your man get personal, want you to have your fun

</l>
<l>If your man get personal, want you to have your fun

</l>
<l>Best come on back to Friars Point,

1
mama, and barrelhouse all night long




</l>
<l>I got women's in Vicksburg, clean on into Tennessee

</l>
<l>I got women's in Vicksburg, clean on into Tennessee

</l>
<l>But my Friars Point
1

</l>
<l>rider, now, hops all over me



</l>
<l>I ain't gon' to state no color but her, front teeth
crowned with gold

</l>
<l>I ain't gon' to state no color but her, front teeth is
crowned with gold

</l>
<l>She got a mortgage on my body, now, and a lien

2
on my soul




</l>
<l>Lord, I'm goin' to Rosedale,
3

</l>
<l>gon' take my rider by my side

</l>
<l>Lord, I'm goin' to Rosedale,
3

</l>
<l>gon' take my rider by my side

</l>
<l>We can still barrelhouse baby, on the riverside



</l>
<l>Now you can squeeze my lemon

</l>
<l>'til the juice run down my...

</l>
<l>(spoken: 'til the juice rune down my leg, baby, you know
what I'm talkin' about)

</l>
<l>You can squeeze my lemon 'til the juice run down my leg

</l>
<l>(spoken: That's what I'm talkin' 'bout, now)

</l>
<l>But I'm goin' back to Friars Point,

1
if I be rockin'to my head
