<lyrics>

If your man get personal, want you to have your fun
If your man get personal, want you to have your fun
Best come on back to
Friars Point
1
, mama, and
barrelhouse
all night long

I got women's in
Vicksburg
, clean on into Tennessee
I got women's in Vicksburg, clean on into Tennessee
But my Friars Point
1

rider
, now, hops all over me

I ain't gon' to state no color but her, front teeth crowned with gold
I ain't gon' to state no color but her, front teeth is crowned with gold
She got a mortgage on my body, now, and a lien
2
on my soul

Lord, I'm goin' to
Rosedale
3
, gon' take my rider by my side
Lord, I'm goin' to Rosedale
3
, gon' take my rider by my side
We can still barrelhouse baby, on the riverside

Now you can
squeeze my lemon
'til the juice run down my...
(spoken: 'til the juice rune down my leg, baby, you know what I'm talkin' about)
You can squeeze my lemon 'til the juice run down my leg
(spoken: That's what I'm talkin' 'bout, now)
But I'm goin' back to Friars Point
1
, if I be rockin'to my head
