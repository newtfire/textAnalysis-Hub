<lyrics>


<l>Well now it's all over

</l>
<l>Now you say we're through

</l>
<l>You've gone an' left

</l>
<l>You say you found somebody new



</l>
<l>That's what you think

</l>
<l>That's what you think

</l>
<l>You can lay off a while

</l>
<l>But you sure can't quit me now



</l>
<l>Now I tried my best to please you

</l>
<l>And all I do is hurt

</l>
<l>Each time I try to tease you

</l>
<l>You say you're going away to stay



</l>
<l>That's what you think

</l>
<l>That's what you think

</l>
<l>You can lay off a while

</l>
<l>But you sure can't quit me now



</l>
<l>You might as well come back to me

</l>
<l>And do the things you should

</l>
<l>Now I'll tell you just one fact you see

</l>
<l>Though you might as well be good



</l>
<l>Say you used to love me

</l>
<l>With all your heart an' soul

</l>
<l>But now that you're above me

</l>
<l>You say your love is goin' cold



</l>
<l>That's what you think

</l>
<l>That's what you think

</l>
<l>You can lay off a while

</l>
<l>But you sure can't quit me now



</l>
<l>You say you used to love me

</l>
<l>With all your heart an' soul

</l>
<l>But now that you above me

</l>
<l>You say your love is goin' cold



</l>
<l>That's what you think

</l>
<l>That's what you think

</l>
<l>You can lay off a while

</l>
<l>But you sure can't quit me now



</l>
<l>Quit me now

</l>
<l>Quit me now

</l>
<l>Quit me now

</l>
<l>Quit me now

</l>
<l>You can lay off a while

</l>
<l>But you sure can't quit me now!

</l>
<l>Oh-oh
