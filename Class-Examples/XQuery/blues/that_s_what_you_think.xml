<lyrics>



Well now it's all over

Now you say we're through

You've gone an' left

You say you found somebody new



That's what you think

That's what you think

You can lay off a while

But you sure can't quit me now



Now I tried my best to please you

And all I do is hurt

Each time I try to tease you

You say you're going away to stay



That's what you think

That's what you think

You can lay off a while

But you sure can't quit me now



You might as well come back to me

And do the things you should

Now I'll tell you just one fact you see

Though you might as well be good



Say you used to love me

With all your heart an' soul

But now that you're above me

You say your love is goin' cold



That's what you think

That's what you think

You can lay off a while

But you sure can't quit me now



You say you used to love me

With all your heart an' soul

But now that you above me

You say your love is goin' cold



That's what you think

That's what you think

You can lay off a while

But you sure can't quit me now



Quit me now

Quit me now

Quit me now

Quit me now

You can lay off a while

But you sure can't quit me now!

Oh-oh
