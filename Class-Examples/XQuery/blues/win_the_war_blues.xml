<lyrics>



Uncle Sam is gonna give me a Thunderbolt
1
, he want
me to fly away up above the clouds

Uncle Sam is gonna give me a Thunderbolt, he want me to fly away up
above the clouds

He wants to drop the bombs on the Japanese, I really got to make my
baby proud



I wants a machine gun, and I wants to be hid out in the wood

I wants a machine gun, and I wants to be hid out in the wood

I wants to show old man Hitler, that Sonny Boy don't mean him no
good



I wants to drop a bomb and set the Japanese city on fire

I wants to drop a bomb and set the Japanese city on fire

Now because they are so rotten, I just love to see them die



I've got the victory blues, because I know I've got to go

I've got the victory blues, because I know I have got to go

Now to keep the dirty Japanese from slippin' into my baby's back
door
