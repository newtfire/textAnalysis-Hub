<l>Uncle Sam is gonna give me a Thunderbolt
1
, he want
me to fly away up above the clouds

</l>
<l>Uncle Sam is gonna give me a Thunderbolt, he want me to fly away up
above the clouds

</l>
<l>He wants to drop the bombs on the Japanese, I really got to make my
baby proud



</l>
<l>I wants a machine gun, and I wants to be hid out in the wood

</l>
<l>I wants a machine gun, and I wants to be hid out in the wood

</l>
<l>I wants to show old man Hitler, that Sonny Boy don't mean him no
good



</l>
<l>I wants to drop a bomb and set the Japanese city on fire

</l>
<l>I wants to drop a bomb and set the Japanese city on fire

</l>
<l>Now because they are so rotten, I just love to see them die



</l>
<l>I've got the victory blues, because I know I've got to go

</l>
<l>I've got the victory blues, because I know I have got to go

</l>
<l>Now to keep the dirty Japanese from slippin' into my baby's back
door
