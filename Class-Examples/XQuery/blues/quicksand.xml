<lyrics>


<l>They tell me love is like quicksand, can't stop when you're sinkin'
down

</l>
<l>Tell me love is like quicksand, you can't stop when you're sinkin'
down

</l>
<l>My gal lead me down to the suction and I know I just can't turn

around




</l>
<l>She's a hardheaded woman, an' she always treat me wrong

</l>
<l>She's a hardheaded woman, an' she always treat me wrong

</l>
<l>She treat me so bad, that's when she make me weep an' moan

</l>
<l>Hey!



</l>
<l>She's a hardheaded woman, she always treat me wrong

</l>
<l>I'm sick an' down baby, 'cause you always treat me wrong

</l>
<l>My handle raised for help, won't you listen to me weep an' moan?



</l>
<l>Hey!</l></lyrics></xml>
