<lyrics>



They tell me love is like quicksand, can't stop when you're sinkin'
down

Tell me love is like quicksand, you can't stop when you're sinkin'
down

My gal lead me down to the suction and I know I just can't turn
around



She's a hardheaded woman, an' she always treat me wrong

She's a hardheaded woman, an' she always treat me wrong

She treat me so bad, that's when she make me weep an' moan

Hey!



She's a hardheaded woman, she always treat me wrong

I'm sick an' down baby, 'cause you always treat me wrong

My handle raised for help, won't you listen to me weep an' moan?



Hey!
