<lyrics>



That man don't love you, he told me so

He's only doin' that, baby, to break up your home



When things go wrong, so wrong with you,

it hurts me so, it hurts me so



That man don't love you, no he don't

He's only jivin' you little girl, lovin' the girl next door



When things go wrong, so wrong with you,

it hurts me so, it hurts me so Yeah!.



You know you don't love him, you know you don't

Go ahead and leave me baby, don't make me cry



When things go wrong, so wrong with you,

it hurts me so, it hurts me so



That man don't love you, he told me so

Only jivin' you, baby, breaking up your home



When things go wrong, so wrong with you,

it hurts me so, it hurts me so



When things go wrong, so wrong with you,

it hurts me so, it hurts me so



So long, baby, I've got to go

Because you don't love me now, darlin', I know you don't



When things go wrong, so wrong with you,

it hurts me so, it hurts me so
