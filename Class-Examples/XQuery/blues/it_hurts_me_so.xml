<lyrics>


<l>That man don't love you, he told me so

</l>
<l>He's only doin' that, baby, to break up your home



</l>
<l>When things go wrong, so wrong with you,

</l>
<l>it hurts me so, it hurts me so



</l>
<l>That man don't love you, no he don't

</l>
<l>He's only jivin' you little girl, lovin' the girl next door



</l>
<l>When things go wrong, so wrong with you,

</l>
<l>it hurts me so, it hurts me so Yeah!.



</l>
<l>You know you don't love him, you know you don't

</l>
<l>Go ahead and leave me baby, don't make me cry



</l>
<l>When things go wrong, so wrong with you,

</l>
<l>it hurts me so, it hurts me so



</l>
<l>That man don't love you, he told me so

</l>
<l>Only jivin' you, baby, breaking up your home



</l>
<l>When things go wrong, so wrong with you,

</l>
<l>it hurts me so, it hurts me so



</l>
<l>When things go wrong, so wrong with you,

</l>
<l>it hurts me so, it hurts me so



</l>
<l>So long, baby, I've got to go

</l>
<l>Because you don't love me now, darlin', I know you don't



</l>
<l>When things go wrong, so wrong with you,

</l>
<l>it hurts me so, it hurts me so</l></lyrics></xml>
