<lyrics>



My feets is so sore, can't hardly wear ma shoes

My feets is so sore, can't hardly wear ma shoes

Out last night with wild women and it left me with those big night
blues



I grabbed ma sugar an' I danced sweet mama till the clock struck
twelve

I grabbed ma sugar an' I danced sweet mama till the clock struck
twelve

I had to rassle so hard with my good gal, an' I ain't feelin' so
well



I'm going back to that wild party, get with the wild women again

I'm going back to that wild party, get with the wild women again

Well I ain't goin' leave home, till I have me a quart of gin
