<l>My feets is so sore, can't hardly wear ma shoes

</l>
<l>Out last night with wild women and it left me with those big night

blues




</l>
<l>I grabbed ma sugar an' I danced sweet mama till the clock struck
twelve

</l>
<l>I grabbed ma sugar an' I danced sweet mama till the clock struck
twelve

</l>
<l>I had to rassle so hard with my good gal, an' I ain't feelin' so

well




</l>
<l>I'm going back to that wild party, get with the wild women again

</l>
<l>I'm going back to that wild party, get with the wild women again

</l>
<l>Well I ain't goin' leave home, till I have me a quart of gin
