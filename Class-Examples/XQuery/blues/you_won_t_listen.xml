<lyrics>



Yeah, you won't listen to nothing I tell you, woman, you keep on
doin' as you please

Yeah, you won't listen to a thing I tell you, baby, you keep on doin'
as you please

But I've taken it as long as I can, baby, when is this foolishness
gonna cease



I worried myself crazy, baby, cried both night and day

I worried myself crazy, woman, I cried both night and day

You didn't believe me, baby, when I told you I'm gonna leave one
day



Yeah, you told me that you love me, woman, but action speaks louder
than words

Well, you said that you love me, woman, but action speaks louder than
words

I won't be foolin' around no more, that's a line everybody has
heard



If you don't change for the better, baby, you better do it real
soon

If you don't change for the better, woman and you better do it real
soon

Or you will wake up one of these mornings, baby, and find yourself in
a empty room
