<lyrics>


<l>Yeah, you won't listen to nothing I tell you, woman, you keep on
doin' as you please

</l>
<l>Yeah, you won't listen to a thing I tell you, baby, you keep on doin'
as you please

</l>
<l>But I've taken it as long as I can, baby, when is this foolishness

gonna cease




</l>
<l>I worried myself crazy, baby, cried both night and day

</l>
<l>I worried myself crazy, woman, I cried both night and day

</l>
<l>You didn't believe me, baby, when I told you I'm gonna leave one

day




</l>
<l>Yeah, you told me that you love me, woman, but action speaks louder
than words

</l>
<l>Well, you said that you love me, woman, but action speaks louder than
words

</l>
<l>I won't be foolin' around no more, that's a line everybody has

heard




</l>
<l>If you don't change for the better, baby, you better do it real
soon

</l>
<l>If you don't change for the better, woman and you better do it real
soon

</l><l>Or you will wake up one of these mornings, baby, and find yourself in</l>
<l>a empty room</l></lyrics></xml>
