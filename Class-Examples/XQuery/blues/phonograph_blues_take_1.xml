<lyrics>



Beatrice, she got a phonograph, and it won't say a lonesome word

Beatrice, she got a phonograph, but it won't say a lonesome word

What evil have I done, what evil has the poor girl heard



Beatrice, I love my phonograph, but you have broke my windin'
chain

Beatrice, I love my phonograph, ooh, honey, you have broke my windin'
chain

And you've taken my lovin', and give it to your other man



Now, we played it on the sofa, now, we played it 'side the wall

My needles have got rusty, baby, they will not play at all

We played it on the sofa, and we played it 'side the wall

But my needles have got rusty, and it will not play at all



Beatrice, I go crazy, baby, I will lose my mind

And I go cra'eeh, honey, I will lose my mind

Why'n't
1
 you bring your clothes back home, and try me one
more time



She got a phonograph, and it won't say a lonesome word

She got a phonograph, ooh, won't say a lonesome word

What evil have I done, or what evil have the poor girl heard

Note 1: alternatively "won't" instead of "why'n't", as a contraction
of "why don't"
