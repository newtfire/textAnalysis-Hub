<lyrics>



Well, now, court is in session and my heart is the one on trial

Well, court is in session, baby, and my heart is the one on trial

It's been a long, long time, since my case been put on the file



Will you deliver me a verdict, I'm gonna have to rest my case

I want a quick decision, I got no more lovin' time to waste



Court is in session and my heart is the one on trial

It's been a long, long time, since my case been put on the file



Well, all your lovers are on the jury, the heartbreaker is the
D.A.

Can't you see, now, baby, they wanna see me framed and put away



Yes, the court's in session and my heart is the one on trial

It's been a long, long time, since my case been put on the file



Well, now, can't you see baby, I'm gonna have to serve my time

I'm sentenced to keep on lovin' you, for committing a lover's crime,
yeah



I'm bein' framed, the jury's all wrong

There's only two men and six women, yeah

I need a drink, can I get just one more phone call
