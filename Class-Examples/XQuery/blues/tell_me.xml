<l>Tell me, tell me baby, what have I done wrong

</l>
<l>Oh, tell me, tell me baby, what have I done wrong

</l>
<l>You get all your act together and bring your fine self home



</l>
<l>I give you money baby, each and every day

</l>
<l>Oh, give you money pretty baby, each and every day

</l>
<l>You goin' down to the 
...
goin' to the break of day </l>

<l>Tell me, tell me baby, why do you like to lie

</l>
<l>Oh, tell me, tell me pretty baby, why do you like to lie

</l>
<l>You goin' straight to the devil the very first day you die



</l>
<l>Tell me, tell me baby, just before I go

</l>
<l>Oh, tell me, tell me pretty baby, just before I go

</l>
<l>If you want somebody else, I won't be back no more



</l>
