<lyrics>



Tell me, tell me baby, what have I done wrong

Oh, tell me, tell me baby, what have I done wrong

You get all your act together and bring your fine self home



I give you money baby, each and every day

Oh, give you money pretty baby, each and every day

You goin' down to the 
...
 goin' to the break of day



Tell me, tell me baby, why do you like to lie

Oh, tell me, tell me pretty baby, why do you like to lie

You goin' straight to the devil the very first day you die



Tell me, tell me baby, just before I go

Oh, tell me, tell me pretty baby, just before I go

If you want somebody else, I won't be back no more
