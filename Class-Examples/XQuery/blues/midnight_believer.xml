<lyrics>



You're about to believe in love again

I'll take you there and bring you back again

The night is short

Tomorrow's are long

Come go with me

While the feeling is strong



Midnight believer

The night believes in you

Midnight believer

The night believes in you



I believe that the night tells us everything

The moves to make with the feel that we bring

You've got the love locked up inside

I've got the touch so there's nothing to hide



Midnight believer

The night believes in you

Midnight believer

The night believes in you
