<lyrics>


<l>You're about to believe in love again

</l>
<l>I'll take you there and bring you back again

</l>
<l>The night is short

</l>
<l>Tomorrow's are long

</l>
<l>Come go with me

</l>
<l>While the feeling is strong



</l>
<l>Midnight believer

</l>
<l>The night believes in you

</l>
<l>Midnight believer

</l>
<l>The night believes in you



</l>
<l>I believe that the night tells us everything

</l>
<l>The moves to make with the feel that we bring

</l>
<l>You've got the love locked up inside

</l>
<l>I've got the touch so there's nothing to hide



</l>
<l>Midnight believer

</l>
<l>The night believes in you

</l>
<l>Midnight believer

</l><l>The night believes in you</l></lyrics></xml>
