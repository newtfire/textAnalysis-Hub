<lyrics>



I done ran into my baby and finally found my old blue jean

I done ran into my baby and finally found my old blue jean

Well, I could tell that they was mine from the oil and the
gasoline



If I ever get back my blue jean, Lord, how happy could one man be

If I ever get back my blue jean, Lord, how happy could one man be

'Cause if I get back those blue jean you know, my baby be bringin'
'em home to me
