<lyrics>



Tell me what's the reason, you keep on teasin' me?

Tell me what's the reason, you keep on teasin' me?

You said that you don't want me, but you just won't let me be



Tell me what's the reason, you do the things you do?

Tell me what's the reason, you do the things you do?

Your breakin' my achin' heart, 'til it pains me through an
through



I get up in the mornin', feelin' kinda good

Hopin' my baby will do the things she should

I'd take you in my arms an hold you nice n' tight

But all you want to do, is start another fight



Tell me what's the reason, you keep on teasin' me?

Said that you don't love me, then please just set me free
