<lyrics>


<l>Tell me what's the reason, you keep on teasin' me?

</l>
<l>Tell me what's the reason, you keep on teasin' me?

</l>
<l>You said that you don't want me, but you just won't let me be



</l>
<l>Tell me what's the reason, you do the things you do?

</l>
<l>Tell me what's the reason, you do the things you do?

</l>
<l>Your breakin' my achin' heart, 'til it pains me through an

through




</l>
<l>I get up in the mornin', feelin' kinda good

</l>
<l>Hopin' my baby will do the things she should

</l>
<l>I'd take you in my arms an hold you nice n' tight

</l>
<l>But all you want to do, is start another fight



</l>
<l>Tell me what's the reason, you keep on teasin' me?

</l>
<l>Said that you don't love me, then please just set me free</l></lyrics></xml>
