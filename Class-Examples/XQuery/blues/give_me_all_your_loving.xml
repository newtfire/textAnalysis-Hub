<lyrics>



Give, give me all your love

Give me all your kissin' and huggin'

Let me know that you're mine

Thrill me, thrill me all the time



Baby, never do me wrong

And we will always get along



Baby, baby just you and me

Piece of paper and a diamond ring

Baby that don't mean a thing

Little loving and mess

I'm the one who love you best



Hope, baby is squeezing me tight

From noon until night



Baby, baby just you and me



Baby, baby just you and me

Piece of paper and a diamond ring

Baby that don't mean a thing

Little loving and mess

I'm the one who love you best
