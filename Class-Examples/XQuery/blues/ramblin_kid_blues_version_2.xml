<lyrics>



Well I am a ramblin' kid, I been ramblin' all of my days

Yes, I am a ramblin' kid, an' I been ramblin' all of my days

Well you know my baby, she want me to stop ramblin', so she says
she'll change her ways



Well now, ain't no use in you ramblin', when your baby don't want you
ramblin' 'round

Yeah, an ain't no use in you ramblin', when your baby don't want you
ramblin' around

Well now you know if you keep on ramblin', she be done drove on outta
this town



No, I ain't gonna ramble, babe, an I ain't gonna ramble no more

Yes, I ain't gonna ramble, tried it an I ain't gonna ramble no
more

Well you know if I keep on a-ramblin', I be driftin' from door to
door



Blow that thing boy!

Play a long time!

I feel lowdown this mornin'

?

Lord have mercy!



(What was she gonna do?)

Girl, I'm leavin', I'm leavin' babe

No I ain't gonna ramble no more

(Later I feel lowdown)

Sonny!



Girl now I'm leavin', I'm leavin' babe, now I ain't gonna ramble no
more

Lord, I'm leavin' I'm leavin' (Lord have mercy), child, I ain't gonna
ramble no more

Well you know I have been ramblin' 'round here, lose a woman
ev'rywhere I go
