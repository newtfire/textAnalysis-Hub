<lyrics>


<l>I'm shufflin' thru the Texas sand, but my head's in Mississippi

</l>
<l>I'm shufflin' thru the Texas sand, but my head's in Mississippi

</l>
<l>The blues has got a hold of me, I believe I'm gettin' dizzy

</l>
<l>(Spoken: Help me now!)



</l>
<l>I keep thinkin' 'bout that night in Memphis, Lord, I thought I was in
heaven

</l>
<l>I keep thinkin' 'bout that night in Memphis, I thought I was in
heaven

</l>
<l>But I was stumblin' thru the parking lot of an invisible seven
eleven

</l>
<l>(Spoken: What was I doin' out there?)



</l>
<l>Where's my head baby?

</l>
<l>Somewhere in Mississippi



</l>
<l>Last night I saw a cowgirl, she was floatin' across the ceiling

</l>
<l>And last night I saw a naked cowgirl, she was floatin' across the
ceiling

</l>
<l>She was mumblin' to some howlin' wolf about some 
voodoo

</l>
<l>healin'

</l>
<l>(Spoken: Hmm Baby)</l></lyrics></xml>
