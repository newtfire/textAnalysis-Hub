<lyrics>



I'm shufflin' thru the Texas sand, but my head's in Mississippi

I'm shufflin' thru the Texas sand, but my head's in Mississippi

The blues has got a hold of me, I believe I'm gettin' dizzy

(Spoken: Help me now!)



I keep thinkin' 'bout that night in Memphis, Lord, I thought I was in
heaven

I keep thinkin' 'bout that night in Memphis, I thought I was in
heaven

But I was stumblin' thru the parking lot of an invisible seven
eleven

(Spoken: What was I doin' out there?)



Where's my head baby?

Somewhere in Mississippi



Last night I saw a cowgirl, she was floatin' across the ceiling

And last night I saw a naked cowgirl, she was floatin' across the
ceiling

She was mumblin' to some howlin' wolf about some 
voodoo

healin'

(Spoken: Hmm Baby)
