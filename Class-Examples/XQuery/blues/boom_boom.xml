<lyrics>



Boom boom boom boom

I'm gonna shoot you right down,

right offa your feet

Take you home with me,

put you in my house

Boom boom boom boom

A-haw haw haw haw

Hmmm hmmm hmmm hmmm

Hmmm hmmm hmmm hmmm



I love to see you 
strut
,

up and down the floor

When you talking to me,

that baby talk

I like it like that

Whoa, yeah!

Talk that talk, walk that walk



When she walk that walk,

and talk that talk,

and whisper in my ear,

tell me that you love me

I love that talk

When you talk like that,

you knocks me out,

right off of my feet

Hoo hoo hoo

Talk that talk, and walk that walk

Oh, yeah!
