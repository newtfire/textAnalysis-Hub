<l>(Spoken:

</l>
<l>Now this tune is all about a girl that's got a good man

</l>
<l>But she gonna leave him, to another, for another slick talkin'
dude

</l>
<l>But I advised her not to burn down the bridge

</l>
<l>She might wanna come back)



</l>
<l>One, two, three, four!



</l>
<l>Your mind's set on leavin'

</l>
<l>To a house down a one way street

</l>
<l>Say you're gonna lock up all the doors

</l>
<l>And throw away the key



</l>
<l>Oh, but don't burn down the bridge, darlin'

</l>
<l>You just might wanna come back

</l>
<l>'Cause the grass ain't no greener

</l>
<l>On the other side of the track



</l>
<l>Oh, you counted me out, before I could get to bat

</l>
<l>All the things are out-ta the Chevrolet

</l>
<l>Tomorrow night be drivin' a Cadillac



</l>
<l>But don't burn down the bridge, darlin'

</l>
<l>You just might wanna come back

</l>
<l>'Cause the grass ain't no greener

</l>
<l>On the other side of the track



</l>
<l>Hey!



</l>
<l>All your so called friends

</l>
<l>Taught you how to cheat an' lie

</l>
<l>Now it seem like you gonna jump

</l>
<l>From the fryin' pan to the fire



</l>
<l>Oh, but don't burn down your bridge, darlin'

</l>
<l>You just might wanna come back

</l>
<l>'Cause the grass ain't no greener

</l>
<l>On the other side of the track



</l>
<l>Hey! Ha!



</l>
<l>Thank you! Woo!

</l>
<l>Thank you very much!
