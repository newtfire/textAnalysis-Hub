<lyrics>



(Spoken:

Now this tune is all about a girl that's got a good man

But she gonna leave him, to another, for another slick talkin'
dude

But I advised her not to burn down the bridge

She might wanna come back)



One, two, three, four!



Your mind's set on leavin'

To a house down a one way street

Say you're gonna lock up all the doors

And throw away the key



Oh, but don't burn down the bridge, darlin'

You just might wanna come back

'Cause the grass ain't no greener

On the other side of the track



Oh, you counted me out, before I could get to bat

All the things are out-ta the Chevrolet

Tomorrow night be drivin' a Cadillac



But don't burn down the bridge, darlin'

You just might wanna come back

'Cause the grass ain't no greener

On the other side of the track



Hey!



All your so called friends

Taught you how to cheat an' lie

Now it seem like you gonna jump

From the fryin' pan to the fire



Oh, but don't burn down your bridge, darlin'

You just might wanna come back

'Cause the grass ain't no greener

On the other side of the track



Hey! Ha!



Thank you! Woo!

Thank you very much!
