<lyrics>



Well, money's gettin' cheaper, prices gettin' steeper

Found myself a woman but I just couldn't keep her

Times gettin' tougher than tough

Things gettin' rougher than rough

I make a lot of money, I just keep spendin' the stuff



Well, pork chops on the market, ask the butcher for a pound

Couldn't buy a pork chop when I laid my money down

Times gettin' tougher than tough

Things gettin' rougher than rough

I make a lot of money, just keep spendin' the stuff



Well, politicians are tellin' folks to cut out on their meat

Why don't they cut the price an let the people eat?

Times gettin' tougher than tough

Things gettin' rougher than rough

I make a lot of money, I just keep spendin' the stuff



Well, I can't afford to live, I guess I'll have to try

Undertaker's got a union, and it costs to much to die

Times gettin' tougher than tough

Things gettin' rougher than rough

I make a lot of money, I just keep spendin' the stuff
