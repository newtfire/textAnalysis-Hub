<lyrics>


<l>Well, money's gettin' cheaper, prices gettin' steeper

</l>
<l>Found myself a woman but I just couldn't keep her

</l>
<l>Times gettin' tougher than tough

</l>
<l>Things gettin' rougher than rough

</l>
<l>I make a lot of money, I just keep spendin' the stuff



</l>
<l>Well, pork chops on the market, ask the butcher for a pound

</l>
<l>Couldn't buy a pork chop when I laid my money down

</l>
<l>Times gettin' tougher than tough

</l>
<l>Things gettin' rougher than rough

</l>
<l>I make a lot of money, just keep spendin' the stuff



</l>
<l>Well, politicians are tellin' folks to cut out on their meat

</l>
<l>Why don't they cut the price an let the people eat?

</l>
<l>Times gettin' tougher than tough

</l>
<l>Things gettin' rougher than rough

</l>
<l>I make a lot of money, I just keep spendin' the stuff



</l>
<l>Well, I can't afford to live, I guess I'll have to try

</l>
<l>Undertaker's got a union, and it costs to much to die

</l>
<l>Times gettin' tougher than tough

</l>
<l>Things gettin' rougher than rough

</l>
<l>I make a lot of money, I just keep spendin' the stuff</l></lyrics></xml>
