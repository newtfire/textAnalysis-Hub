<lyrics>



Sure look good, but it don't mean a thing to me

Sure look good, but it don't mean a thing to me

I got a hip-shaking woman, shake like a willow tree



You better wait baby, you got back a little too late

You better wait baby, you got back a little too late

I got a cool-shaking baby, shake like jello on a plate



When my baby walk, you know she's fine and mellow

When my baby walk, you know she's fine and mellow

Every time she stops, her flesh it shake like jello



Oh, shake it baby, shake it for me

Oh, shake lil' baby, shake it for me

Oh, shake it little baby, shake like a willow tree
