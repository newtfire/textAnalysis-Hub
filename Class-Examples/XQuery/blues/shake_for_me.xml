<lyrics>


<l>Sure look good, but it don't mean a thing to me

</l>
<l>Sure look good, but it don't mean a thing to me

</l>
<l>I got a hip-shaking woman, shake like a willow tree



</l>
<l>You better wait baby, you got back a little too late

</l>
<l>You better wait baby, you got back a little too late

</l>
<l>I got a cool-shaking baby, shake like jello on a plate



</l>
<l>When my baby walk, you know she's fine and mellow

</l>
<l>When my baby walk, you know she's fine and mellow

</l>
<l>Every time she stops, her flesh it shake like jello



</l>
<l>Oh, shake it baby, shake it for me

</l>
<l>Oh, shake lil' baby, shake it for me

</l><l>Oh, shake it little baby, shake like a willow tree</l></lyrics></xml>
