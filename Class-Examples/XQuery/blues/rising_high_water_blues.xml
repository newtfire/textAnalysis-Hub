<lyrics>



Backwater
1
 rising, Southern peoples can't make no time

I said, backwater rising, Southern peoples can't make no time

And I can't get no hearing from that Memphis girl of mine



Water in Arkansas, people screaming in Tennessee

Oh, people screaming in Tennessee

If I don't leave Memphis, backwater spill all over poor me



People, since its raining, it has been for nights and days

People, since its raining, has been for nights and days

Thousands people stands on the hill, looking down were they used to
stay



Children stand there screaming: mama, we ain't got no home

Oh, mama we ain't got no home

Papa says to the children, "Backwater left us all alone"



Backwater rising, come in my windows and door

The backwater rising, come in my windows and door

I leave with a prayer in my heart, backwater won't rise no more



__________
