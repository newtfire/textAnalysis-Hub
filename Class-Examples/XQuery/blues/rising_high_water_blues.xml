<lyrics>


<l>Backwater
1
rising, Southern peoples can't make no time </l>
<l>
I said, backwater rising, Southern peoples can't make no time

</l>
<l>And I can't get no hearing from that Memphis girl of mine



</l>
<l>Water in Arkansas, people screaming in Tennessee

</l>
<l>Oh, people screaming in Tennessee

</l>
<l>If I don't leave Memphis, backwater spill all over poor me



</l>
<l>People, since its raining, it has been for nights and days

</l>
<l>People, since its raining, has been for nights and days

</l>
<l>Thousands people stands on the hill, looking down were they used to

stay




</l>
<l>Children stand there screaming: mama, we ain't got no home

</l>
<l>Oh, mama we ain't got no home

</l>
<l>Papa says to the children, "Backwater left us all alone"



</l>
<l>Backwater rising, come in my windows and door

</l>
<l>The backwater rising, come in my windows and door

</l>
<l>I leave with a prayer in my heart, backwater won't rise no more



</l>
