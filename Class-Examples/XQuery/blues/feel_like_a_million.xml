<lyrics>


<l>I've got a real fine woman and she gives me everything

</l>
<l>I've got a real fine woman and she gives me everything

</l>
<l>It just makes me feel so good just to hear my baby call my name



</l>
<l>My baby's sly way of loving makes me feel so good I could sing

</l>
<l>My baby's sly way of loving makes me feel so good I wanna sing

</l>
<l>Yes, I feel just like a millionaire, when I hear my baby call my

name




</l>
<l>Yes, there ain't nobody like my baby, that's the reason I love her
so

</l>
<l>Ain't nobody, nobody, nobody like my baby, that's the reason I love
her so

</l>
<l>Yes, I would even die for her and I want the whole world to know



</l>
<l>Yes, when I'm down she'll pick me up and tell me, "Daddy you can't
lose"

</l>
<l>Yes, when I'm down, when I'm down, when I'm down, people, my baby
tell me I can't lose

</l><l>Yes, when all of my friends forget about me, my baby keeps away these</l>
