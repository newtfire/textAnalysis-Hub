<lyrics>



I've got a real fine woman and she gives me everything

I've got a real fine woman and she gives me everything

It just makes me feel so good just to hear my baby call my name



My baby's sly way of loving makes me feel so good I could sing

My baby's sly way of loving makes me feel so good I wanna sing

Yes, I feel just like a millionaire, when I hear my baby call my
name



Yes, there ain't nobody like my baby, that's the reason I love her
so

Ain't nobody, nobody, nobody like my baby, that's the reason I love
her so

Yes, I would even die for her and I want the whole world to know



Yes, when I'm down she'll pick me up and tell me, "Daddy you can't
lose"

Yes, when I'm down, when I'm down, when I'm down, people, my baby
tell me I can't lose

Yes, when all of my friends forget about me, my baby keeps away these
blues
