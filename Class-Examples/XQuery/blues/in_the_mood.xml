<lyrics>


<l>I'm in the mood

</l>
<l>I'm in the mood for love

</l>
<l>I'm in the mood, I'm in the mood

</l>
<l>Baby, I'm in the mood for love



</l>
<l>I said night time is the right time,

</l>
<l>to be with the one you love

</l>
<l>You know when night come baby,

</l>
<l>God know, you're so far away



</l>
<l>I'm in the mood

</l>
<l>I'm in the mood for love

</l>
<l>I'm in the mood, I'm in the mood,

</l>
<l>baby, I'm in the mood for love



</l>
<l>I said yes, my mother told me,

</l>
<l>to leave that girl alone

</l>
<l>But my mother didn't know what that little,

</l>
<l>girl was puttin' down



</l>
<l>I'm in the mood

</l>
<l>I'm in the mood, baby

</l>
<l>I'm in the mood for love

</l>
<l>I'm in the mood, I'm in the mood,

</l>
<l>baby, I'm in the mood for love</l></lyrics></xml>
