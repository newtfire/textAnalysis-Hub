<lyrics>



I'm in the mood

I'm in the mood for love

I'm in the mood, I'm in the mood

Baby, I'm in the mood for love



I said night time is the right time,

to be with the one you love

You know when night come baby,

God know, you're so far away



I'm in the mood

I'm in the mood for love

I'm in the mood, I'm in the mood,

baby, I'm in the mood for love



I said yes, my mother told me,

to leave that girl alone

But my mother didn't know what that little,

girl was puttin' down



I'm in the mood

I'm in the mood, baby

I'm in the mood for love

I'm in the mood, I'm in the mood,

baby, I'm in the mood for love
