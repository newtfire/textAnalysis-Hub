<lyrics>

You were wrong, you were wrong
You were wrong, yeah, you were       wrong
You were wrong, baby, stayin' away too long
You know it       ain't right, it ain't right,
It ain't right, it ain't right
It       ain't right, stayin' out all night

I try and I try with all my might, to do the thing that's right
No matter how good I treat you baby, you only wanna fuss and fight
You       were wrong, you were wrong
You were wrong, yeah, you were wrong
You were wrong, baby, stayin' away too long
You know it ain't right, it       ain't right

I ask myself, and I ask myself, and ask myself again,
How can       you do the things that right, when you keep on livin' in sin?
You were       wrong, you were wrong
You were wrong, yeah, you were wrong
You       were wrong, baby, stayin' away too long
You know it ain't right, it ain't right
