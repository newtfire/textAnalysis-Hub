<lyrics>



Brick baby! That's what I'm gonna throw upside your head

I said now, brick baby, that's what I'm gonna throw upside your
head

Yeah, you got me so worried, got me talkin' outta my head



Yeah, you know I love you and you know my love is true

Yeah, I can't understand it, baby, the way you treat me like you
do

I'm gonna chuck a brick, baby, I'm gonna chuck a brick at you



I got a brick, baby, I'm gonna throw it upside your head

I said a brick, baby, I'm gonna throw it upside your head

Yeah, ya got me so worried, ya got me talkin' outta my head



Ah, you know I love ya, yeah, you know my live is true

I can't understand it, baby, how you treat me like you do

I'm gonna chuck a brick, baby, I'm gonna chuck a brick at you



(Oh, I'm gonna chuck this brick right here!)



Hey!
