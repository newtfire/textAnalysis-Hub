<lyrics>


<l>Oh how I love you babe,
how I wish you were mine

</l>
<l>I would candy coat you with my affection babe,
and I'd love you all the time

</l>
<l>All my love is so sweet,
almost good enough for you to eat

</l>
<l>Not too big on thinking,

not so big I'm outta size
When you see how big is my lovin',
honey you'll finally realize that I'm
I'm your sugarman,
all my love is so sweet


</l>
<l>I got more candy for you babe,
than any man you'll ever meet

</l>
<l>Some men bring you flowers,

some men diamond rings
Come into my candy store babe,
I got everything


</l>
<l>'Cause I'm your sugarman babe,
all my love is so sweet

</l><l>Down deep I got a great big heart,</l>
<l>from a last sincerin' time that beats,</l>
<l>you know I'm your sugarman babe</l></lyrics></xml>
