Moanin' at midnight

Moanin' at midnight, yeah

Moanin' at midnight, baby

Moanin' at midnight, baby

Moanin' at midnight, baby, yeah



Moanin' at midnight

Moanin' at midnight, baby

Moanin' at midnight

Moanin' at midnight, baby, whew-ew



Well, well, well, well, well, well

Somebody's knockin' on my door

Somebody's knockin'

Somebody's knockin'

Somebody's knockin' on my door

I don't want you to go and tell me to come on, hey come on right
out



Well, well, well, well, well, well

Somebody told me I'm gonna fall

Somebody told me, somebody told me I'm gonna fall



Hey won't someone tell me now what's goin' on

Well, well, well, well

Somebody please

Well

Somebody please

Somebody please

Somebody please



Somebody please

Somebody please

Somebody please

Somebody please

Somebody, somebody please

Somebody, somebody please

Tell me please

Somebody please

Somebody please

Somebody please

Somebody please



Moanin' at midnight, baby

Moanin' at midnight, baby

Moanin' at midnight, baby

Moanin' at midnight, baby

Moanin' at midnight, baby

Moanin', I said moanin'

At midnight

I said moanin' at midnight

Moanin'

Midnight

Moanin'

Midnight

Moanin'

Midnight
