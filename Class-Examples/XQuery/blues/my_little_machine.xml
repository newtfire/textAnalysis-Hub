<lyrics>


<l>Oh yes, somethin's gettin' wrong with my little machine

</l>
<l>Oh yes, somethin's gettin' wrong with my little machine

</l>
<l>Now she got a standard carburetor, my baby been burnin' bad

gasoline




</l>
<l>Now I'm gonna do like the eagle, I'm gonna fly on the mountain
top

</l>
<l>Lord and if I don't find my baby, it ain't no tellin' where I'll
stop

</l>
<l>Because oh yes, somethin's gettin' wrong with my little machine

</l>
<l>Now she got a standard carburetor, oh but my baby burnin' bad

gasoline




</l>
<l>Well I don't know baby, I don't know what to do

</l>
<l>You know I don't wanna hurt your feelings, baby I'm even gettin' mad
with you

</l>
<l>But I tell you oh yes, some's gettin' wrong with my little
machine

</l>
<l>Now you got a standard carburetor, oh but you been burnin' bad

gasoline




</l>
<l>Well I don't know baby, I don't know what to do

</l>
<l>Baby you is so sweet, but you just won't be true

</l>
<l>But oh yes, somethin's gettin' wrong with my little machine

</l><l>Now she's got a standard carburetor, oh but my baby been burnin' bad</l>
