<lyrics>



Oh yes, somethin's gettin' wrong with my little machine

Oh yes, somethin's gettin' wrong with my little machine

Now she got a standard carburetor, my baby been burnin' bad
gasoline



Now I'm gonna do like the eagle, I'm gonna fly on the mountain
top

Lord and if I don't find my baby, it ain't no tellin' where I'll
stop

Because oh yes, somethin's gettin' wrong with my little machine

Now she got a standard carburetor, oh but my baby burnin' bad
gasoline



Well I don't know baby, I don't know what to do

You know I don't wanna hurt your feelings, baby I'm even gettin' mad
with you

But I tell you oh yes, some's gettin' wrong with my little
machine

Now you got a standard carburetor, oh but you been burnin' bad
gasoline



Well I don't know baby, I don't know what to do

Baby you is so sweet, but you just won't be true

But oh yes, somethin's gettin' wrong with my little machine

Now she's got a standard carburetor, oh but my baby been burnin' bad
gasoline
