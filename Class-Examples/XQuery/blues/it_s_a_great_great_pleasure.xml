<lyrics>


<l>It's a great, great pleasure, a great, great, great, big thrill

</l>
<l>It's a great, great pleasure, a great, great, great, big thrill



</l>
<l>When you got your baby and a whole lotta time to kill

</l>
<l>Did you ever get a feelin' that your feet had turned to stones

</l>
<l>Do you ever get a feelin' that your feet had turned to stones

</l>
<l>Do you get a funny feelin' running up and down your bones

</l>
<l>That's arthritis



</l>
<l>It's a great, great pleasure, a great, great, great, big thrill

</l>
<l>It's a great, great pleasure, a great, great, great, big thrill



</l>
<l>When you got your baby and a whole lotta time to kill

</l>
<l>Did you ever feel lucky and wake up cold in hand

</l>
<l>Did you ever feel lucky and wake up cold in hand

</l>
<l>Find you ain't got a nickel and your woman got another man

</l>
<l>Bad deal</l></lyrics></xml>
