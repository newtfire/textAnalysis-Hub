<lyrics>



It's a great, great pleasure, a great, great, great, big thrill

It's a great, great pleasure, a great, great, great, big thrill



When you got your baby and a whole lotta time to kill

Did you ever get a feelin' that your feet had turned to stones

Do you ever get a feelin' that your feet had turned to stones

Do you get a funny feelin' running up and down your bones

That's arthritis



It's a great, great pleasure, a great, great, great, big thrill

It's a great, great pleasure, a great, great, great, big thrill



When you got your baby and a whole lotta time to kill

Did you ever feel lucky and wake up cold in hand

Did you ever feel lucky and wake up cold in hand

Find you ain't got a nickel and your woman got another man

Bad deal
