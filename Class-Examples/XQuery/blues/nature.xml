<lyrics>



Ah that is nature, won't let me treat you right

Ah that is nature, won't let me treat you right

I'm out lookin', on the other side



You know I love you, want to stay with you day and night

You know I love you, I want to stay with you day and night

I'm just out lookin', I'm usin' my sight



I'm workin', babe day and night

I'm workin', baby day and night

Ah, that's nature, won't let me come to your side



I'm sorry baby, I'm sorry baby

I'm sorry baby, I'm sorry baby

I'm sorry baby, nature caused me to mess up my life
