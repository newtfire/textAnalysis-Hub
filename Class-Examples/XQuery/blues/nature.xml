<lyrics>


<l>Ah that is nature, won't let me treat you right

</l>
<l>Ah that is nature, won't let me treat you right

</l>
<l>I'm out lookin', on the other side



</l>
<l>You know I love you, want to stay with you day and night

</l>
<l>You know I love you, I want to stay with you day and night

</l>
<l>I'm just out lookin', I'm usin' my sight



</l>
<l>I'm workin', babe day and night

</l>
<l>I'm workin', baby day and night

</l>
<l>Ah, that's nature, won't let me come to your side



</l>
<l>I'm sorry baby, I'm sorry baby

</l>
<l>I'm sorry baby, I'm sorry baby

</l>
<l>I'm sorry baby, nature caused me to mess up my life</l></lyrics></xml>
