<lyrics>


<l>There's a saying going 'round and I begin to think it's
true

</l>
<l>It's awful hard to love someone, when they don't care 'bout you

</l>
<l>Once I had a lovin' man, as good as many in this town

</l>
<l>But now I'm sad and lonely, for he's gone and turned me down, now

</l>
<l>I ain't got nobody and nobody cares for me



</l>
<l>I got the blues, the weary blues

</l>
<l>And I'm sad and lonely, won't somebody come and take a chance with
me?

</l>
<l>I'll sing sweet love songs honey, all the time

</l>
<l>If you'll come and be my sweet baby mine

</l>
<l>'Cause I ain't got nobody, and nobody cares for me



</l>
<l>Won't somebody go and find my man and bring him back to me

</l>
<l>It's awful hard to be alone and without sympathy

</l>
<l>Once I was a loving gal, as good as any in this town

</l>
<l>but since my daddy left me, I'm a gal with her heart bowed down</l></lyrics></xml>
