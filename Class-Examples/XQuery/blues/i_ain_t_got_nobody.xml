<lyrics>



There's a saying going 'round and I begin to think it's
true

It's awful hard to love someone, when they don't care 'bout you

Once I had a lovin' man, as good as many in this town

But now I'm sad and lonely, for he's gone and turned me down, now

I ain't got nobody and nobody cares for me



I got the blues, the weary blues

And I'm sad and lonely, won't somebody come and take a chance with
me?

I'll sing sweet love songs honey, all the time

If you'll come and be my sweet baby mine

'Cause I ain't got nobody, and nobody cares for me



Won't somebody go and find my man and bring him back to me

It's awful hard to be alone and without sympathy

Once I was a loving gal, as good as any in this town

but since my daddy left me, I'm a gal with her heart bowed down
