<lyrics>



Locomotive rollin' by

Locomotive see you rollin' by

Well your smoke is black, blackest I've ever seen

And when I breathe in your air your smoke is so damn mean



Locomotive well your fuel is hot

Locomotive well your fuel is hot

I hear you comin', hear you coming but you're not

Oh your engine's so loud then you come to a stop



Locomotive now you try so hard,

Locomotive know you try so hard

You've got to keep on moving, keep on moving right along

Oh right along, don't stop dead in your tracks

I can't go on with this song, no more, no more



Locomotive rollin' by

Locomotive see you rollin' by

Well your smoke is black, blackest I've ever seen

And when I breathe in your air your smoke is so damn mean

And when I breathe in your air your smoke is so damn mean



Locomotive now you try so hard

Locomotive know you try so hard

You've got to keep on moving, keep on moving right along

Oh right along, don't stop dead in your tracks

I can't go on with this song, no more, no more
