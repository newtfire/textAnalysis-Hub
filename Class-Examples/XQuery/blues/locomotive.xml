<lyrics>


<l>Locomotive rollin' by

</l>
<l>Locomotive see you rollin' by

</l>
<l>Well your smoke is black, blackest I've ever seen

</l>
<l>And when I breathe in your air your smoke is so damn mean



</l>
<l>Locomotive well your fuel is hot

</l>
<l>Locomotive well your fuel is hot

</l>
<l>I hear you comin', hear you coming but you're not

</l>
<l>Oh your engine's so loud then you come to a stop



</l>
<l>Locomotive now you try so hard,

</l>
<l>Locomotive know you try so hard

</l>
<l>You've got to keep on moving, keep on moving right along

</l>
<l>Oh right along, don't stop dead in your tracks

</l>
<l>I can't go on with this song, no more, no more



</l>
<l>Locomotive rollin' by

</l>
<l>Locomotive see you rollin' by

</l>
<l>Well your smoke is black, blackest I've ever seen

</l>
<l>And when I breathe in your air your smoke is so damn mean

</l>
<l>And when I breathe in your air your smoke is so damn mean



</l>
<l>Locomotive now you try so hard

</l>
<l>Locomotive know you try so hard

</l>
<l>You've got to keep on moving, keep on moving right along

</l>
<l>Oh right along, don't stop dead in your tracks

</l>
<l>I can't go on with this song, no more, no more</l></lyrics></xml>
