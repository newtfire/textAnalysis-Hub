<lyrics>



God knows I love you, baby, tell the world I do

God knows I love you, darlin', tell the world I do

I'll do anything, just to be loved by you



Got so much trouble, I, don't know what to do

Got so much trouble, I, don't know what to do

Yeah, I'll do anything, just to make love to you



I want to hug ya, kiss ya, squeeze ya 'till my arms fall off

I wants to hug ya, kiss ya, squeeze ya 'till my arms fall off

God knows about that, baby, baby, that I love you so



Got so much trouble, I, don't know what to do

Got so much trouble, I, don't know what to do

Yeah, I'll do anything just to make love to you



I want to hug ya, kiss ya, squeeze ya 'till my arms fall off

I wants to hug ya, kiss ya, squeeze ya 'till my arms fall off

You'll know about that, baby, baby that I love you so
