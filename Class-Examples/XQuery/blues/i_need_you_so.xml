<lyrics>



I need you so, to keep me happy

If I can't have you, I cannot go on



I need your arms, around me tightly

Yes, I'll miss you nightly, when you're not at home



When day is done, I need you so

I long to hear you, your little knock upon the door



When you need me, I'll try not to worry

Come back in a hurry, because I need you so
