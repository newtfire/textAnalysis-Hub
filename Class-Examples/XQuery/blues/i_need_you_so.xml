<lyrics>


<l>I need you so, to keep me happy

</l>
<l>If I can't have you, I cannot go on



</l>
<l>I need your arms, around me tightly

</l>
<l>Yes, I'll miss you nightly, when you're not at home



</l>
<l>When day is done, I need you so

</l>
<l>I long to hear you, your little knock upon the door



</l>
<l>When you need me, I'll try not to worry

</l>
<l>Come back in a hurry, because I need you so</l></lyrics></xml>
