<lyrics>



I've been downhearted

Ever since the day we met

Baby I've been down hearted

Ever since the day we met

I've been loving nothing but the blues

Baby, how blue can you get?



My love burned like a fire

Your love burned like a cigarette

Yes, my love burned like a fire

Your love burned like a cigarette

Yes, I've seen you put it down and crush it

Baby, how blue can you get?



Oh you're evil when I'm with you, baby

And you're jealous when we're apart

Yes, you're evil when I'm with you, baby

And you're jealous when we're apart

How blue can you get baby

The answer's right here in my heart



I gave you a brand new Ford

But you said, "I want a Cadillac"

I bought you a ten dollar dinner

and you said, "Thanks for the snack"

I let you live in my penthouse

You said it just a shack

I gave seven children

And now you wanna give them back

I said, "I've been down hearted baby,

ever since the day we met"

I've been loving nothing but the blues

Tell me how blue can you get?
