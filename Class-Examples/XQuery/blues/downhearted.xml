<lyrics>


<l>I've been downhearted

</l>
<l>Ever since the day we met

</l>
<l>Baby I've been down hearted

</l>
<l>Ever since the day we met

</l>
<l>I've been loving nothing but the blues

</l>
<l>Baby, how blue can you get?



</l>
<l>My love burned like a fire

</l>
<l>Your love burned like a cigarette

</l>
<l>Yes, my love burned like a fire

</l>
<l>Your love burned like a cigarette

</l>
<l>Yes, I've seen you put it down and crush it

</l>
<l>Baby, how blue can you get?



</l>
<l>Oh you're evil when I'm with you, baby

</l>
<l>And you're jealous when we're apart

</l>
<l>Yes, you're evil when I'm with you, baby

</l>
<l>And you're jealous when we're apart

</l>
<l>How blue can you get baby

</l>
<l>The answer's right here in my heart



</l>
<l>I gave you a brand new Ford

</l>
<l>But you said, "I want a Cadillac"

</l>
<l>I bought you a ten dollar dinner

</l>
<l>and you said, "Thanks for the snack"

</l>
<l>I let you live in my penthouse

</l>
<l>You said it just a shack

</l>
<l>I gave seven children

</l>
<l>And now you wanna give them back

</l>
<l>I said, "I've been down hearted baby,

</l>
<l>ever since the day we met"

</l>
<l>I've been loving nothing but the blues

</l><l>Tell me how blue can you get?</l></lyrics></xml>
