<l>(Spoken:

</l>
<l>Who's that knockin' on that door

</l>
<l>Jones?

</l>
<l>You better get away from that door

</l>
<l>I don't know nobody named Jones

</l>
<l>You're in the right church, brother, but the wrong
pew

)



</l>
<l>Sam Jones left his lawful wife, just to step around

</l>
<l>Came back home, 'bout a year

</l>
<l>Took it for his high brown

</l>
<l>Went to his accustomed shore

</l>
<l>And he knocked his knuckles sore

</l>
<l>His wife she came, but to his shame

</l>
<l>She knew his face no more

</l>
<l>Sam said, "I'm your husband, dear"

</l>
<l>But she said, "Dear, that's strange to hear"



</l>
<l>You ain't talkin' to Mrs. Jones

</l>
<l>You speakin' to Miss Wilson now

</l>
<l>I used to be your lawful mate

</l>
<l>But the judge done changed my fate

</l>
<l>Was a time you could-a' walked right in

</l>
<l>And call this place your home sweet home

</l>
<l>But now it's all mine, for all time

</l>
<l>I'm free and livin' all alone

</l>
<l>Don't need your clothes, don't need your rent

</l>
<l>Don't need your ones and twos

</l>
<l>Though I ain't rich, I know my stitch

</l>
<l>I earned my 
strutting

</l>
<l>shoes

</l>
<l>Say, hand me the key that unlocks my front door

</l>
<l>Because that bell don't read Sam Jones no more, no

</l>
<l>You ain't talkin' to Mrs. Jones

</l>
<l>You speakin' to Miss Wilson now
