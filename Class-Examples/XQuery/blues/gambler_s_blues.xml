<lyrics>



I don't know what love is, but I think I must have it bad

Yeah, you I don't know what love is, people, whoah, but I think I
must have it bad

Yeah, you know some people say love is just a gamble, but whatever it
is, it's enough to drive old me mad



They say love is just a proposition, people. it's strictly a game of
give and take

Yeah, they tell me love, love, love is a proposition, people, they
say it's strictly a game of give and take

Whoah, but my woman took all I gave her and I'm here to tell to you
that love proposition stuff 's a fake



Oh, I don't claim to be no gambler people, oh, I don't know much
about the dice

Yes, I don't claim to be no gambler people, I tell you I don't know
much about the dice

Oh, but I wait and my baby knows, she knows I'm not the kind who's
gonna crap out twice



Yes, she left me early this mornin', I don't know the reason why

She just got up early this mornin', didn't even say good-bye

But I love you, I love you, you know I love you baby, although you
made me cry

Yes, there are a lot of women who love me, oh, but how you
satisfy
