<lyrics>


<l>I don't know what love is, but I think I must have it bad

</l>
<l>Yeah, you I don't know what love is, people, whoah, but I think I
must have it bad

</l>
<l>Yeah, you know some people say love is just a gamble, but whatever it

is, it's enough to drive old me mad




</l>
<l>They say love is just a proposition, people. it's strictly a game of
give and take

</l>
<l>Yeah, they tell me love, love, love is a proposition, people, they
say it's strictly a game of give and take

</l>
<l>Whoah, but my woman took all I gave her and I'm here to tell to you

that love proposition stuff 's a fake




</l>
<l>Oh, I don't claim to be no gambler people, oh, I don't know much
about the dice

</l>
<l>Yes, I don't claim to be no gambler people, I tell you I don't know
much about the dice

</l>
<l>Oh, but I wait and my baby knows, she knows I'm not the kind who's

gonna crap out twice




</l>
<l>Yes, she left me early this mornin', I don't know the reason why

</l>
<l>She just got up early this mornin', didn't even say good-bye

</l>
<l>But I love you, I love you, you know I love you baby, although you
made me cry

</l><l>Yes, there are a lot of women who love me, oh, but how you</l>
<l>satisfy</l></lyrics></xml>
