<lyrics>


<l>I met a fine beautician, in a very fine condition

</l>
<l>She was long and lean, and you know what that means

</l>
<l>She's a good lovin' mama, a hard workin' woman

</l>
<l>She makes a lot of money, I don't have to worry about a thing



</l>
<l>She works hard all day, dressin' hair

</l>
<l>Man you can bet, I want to get somewhere

</l>
<l>With my good lovin' mama, my hard workin' woman

</l>
<l>She makes a lot of money, I don't have a worry about a thing



</l>
<l>I meet the finest woman, from everywhere

</l>
<l>Because my baby, dress their hair

</l>
<l>I'll be her lover boy, she treats me like a king

</l>
<l>She makes a lot of money, don't have to worry about a thing



</l>
<l>Yes, she keeps her hair, so neat and fine

</l>
<l>And every pound of her is mine

</l>
<l>I'll be her lover boy, I'll be happy as a king

</l>
<l>She makes a lot of money, don't have to worry about a thing</l></lyrics></xml>
