<lyrics>



I met a fine beautician, in a very fine condition

She was long and lean, and you know what that means

She's a good lovin' mama, a hard workin' woman

She makes a lot of money, I don't have to worry about a thing



She works hard all day, dressin' hair

Man you can bet, I want to get somewhere

With my good lovin' mama, my hard workin' woman

She makes a lot of money, I don't have a worry about a thing



I meet the finest woman, from everywhere

Because my baby, dress their hair

I'll be her lover boy, she treats me like a king

She makes a lot of money, don't have to worry about a thing



Yes, she keeps her hair, so neat and fine

And every pound of her is mine

I'll be her lover boy, I'll be happy as a king

She makes a lot of money, don't have to worry about a thing
