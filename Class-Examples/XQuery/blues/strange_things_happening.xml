<lyrics>



Learn to love me or leave me, either one you wanna do

Learn to love me or leave me, either one you wanna do

Because strange things are happenin', babe, an' somethin' might
happen to you



If you know you don't love me, why don't you let me be?

If you know you don't love me, why don't you let me be?

Because it's better to be without you, then to live on in misery



Hey!



Midnight find me cryin', daylight find me cryin', too

Midnight find me cryin', daylight find me cryin', too

You better change your ways pretty baby or somethin' might happen to
you
