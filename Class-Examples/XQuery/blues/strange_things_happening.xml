<lyrics>


<l>Learn to love me or leave me, either one you wanna do

</l>
<l>Learn to love me or leave me, either one you wanna do

</l>
<l>Because strange things are happenin', babe, an' somethin' might

happen to you




</l>
<l>If you know you don't love me, why don't you let me be?

</l>
<l>If you know you don't love me, why don't you let me be?

</l>
<l>Because it's better to be without you, then to live on in misery



</l>
<l>Hey!



</l>
<l>Midnight find me cryin', daylight find me cryin', too

</l>
<l>Midnight find me cryin', daylight find me cryin', too

</l><l>You better change your ways pretty baby or somethin' might happen to</l>
<l>you</l></lyrics></xml>
