<lyrics>



Hangman's rope sho' is tough and strong

Hangman's rope sho' is tough and strong

They gonna hang me because I did something wrong



I wanna tell you the gallis
1
 Lord's a fearful sight

I wanna tell you the gallis Lord's a fearful sight

Hang me in the mornin', and cut me down at night



Mean ole hangman is waitin' to tighten up that noose

Mean ole hangman is waitin' to tighten up that noose

Lord, I'm so scared I'm trembling in my shoes



Jury heard my case and they said my hands was red

Jury heard my case and they said my hands was red

And judge he sentenced me be hanging till I'm dead



Crowd 'round the courthouse and the time is going fast

Crowd 'round the courthouse and the time is going fast

Soon a good-for-nothin' killer is gonna breath his last



Lord, I'm almost dyin', gasping for my breath

Lord, I'm almost dyin', gasping for my breath

And a triflin'
2
 woman waiting to celebrate my death

chair. Issued by Paramount under catalogue no. 12679B;

Note 1: gallis, gallows, a frame usually of two upright posts and a
transverse beam from which criminals are hanged, called also gallows

intent to delude or mislead or to treat someone or something as
unimportant.
