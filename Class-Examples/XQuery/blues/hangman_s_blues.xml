</l>
<l>They gonna hang me because I did something wrong



</l>
<l>I wanna tell you the gallis
1
Lord's a fearful sight </l>
<l>
I wanna tell you the gallis Lord's a fearful sight

</l>
<l>Hang me in the mornin', and cut me down at night



</l>
<l>Mean ole hangman is waitin' to tighten up that noose

</l>
<l>Mean ole hangman is waitin' to tighten up that noose

</l>
<l>Lord, I'm so scared I'm trembling in my shoes



</l>
<l>Jury heard my case and they said my hands was red

</l>
<l>Jury heard my case and they said my hands was red

</l>
<l>And judge he sentenced me be hanging till I'm dead



</l>
<l>Crowd 'round the courthouse and the time is going fast

</l>

</l>
<l>Lord, I'm almost dyin', gasping for my breath

</l>
<l>Lord, I'm almost dyin', gasping for my breath

</l>
<l>And a triflin'
2
woman waiting to celebrate my death </l>


<note>Note: in some states that had the death penalty, hanging was still
the preferred method of execution until the 1950's. Nowadays all
states have converted to poison injections, gas or the electric
chair. Issued by Paramount under catalogue no. 12679B;

Note 1: gallis, gallows, a frame usually of two upright posts and a
transverse beam from which criminals are hanged, called also gallows
tree;

Note 2: triflin', to talk in a jesting or mocking manner or with
intent to delude or mislead or to treat someone or something as
unimportant.</note></lyrics></xml>
