<l>Blues shadows fallin', since my baby went away

</l>
<l>Blues shadows fallin', since my baby went away

</l>
<l>You know the blues is my companion, every night and every day



</l>
<l>The blues walked in this morning, when my baby said goodbye

</l>
<l>The blues walked in this morning, when my baby said goodbye

</l>
<l>I wish I could change her mind, but I know it's no use for me to

try




</l>
<l>Yes will you talk to me baby, if it's just by the telephone

</l>
<l>Won't you please talk to me baby, if it's just by the telephone

</l>
<l>Let me tell you how I miss you baby and how it feels to be alone



</l>
<l>So brother, if you got a good woman, man, you better take my
advice

</l>
<l>Say, if you got a good woman, man, you better take my advice

</l>
<l>You better treat her like an angel and keep her home at any price</l></lyrics></xml>
