<lyrics>



Blues shadows fallin', since my baby went away

Blues shadows fallin', since my baby went away

You know the blues is my companion, every night and every day



The blues walked in this morning, when my baby said goodbye

The blues walked in this morning, when my baby said goodbye

I wish I could change her mind, but I know it's no use for me to
try



Yes will you talk to me baby, if it's just by the telephone

Won't you please talk to me baby, if it's just by the telephone

Let me tell you how I miss you baby and how it feels to be alone



So brother, if you got a good woman, man, you better take my
advice

Say, if you got a good woman, man, you better take my advice

You better treat her like an angel and keep her home at any price
