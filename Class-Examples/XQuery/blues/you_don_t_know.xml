<lyrics>


<l>You don't know how much I love you

</l>
<l>You don't know how much I care

</l>
<l>You don't know how much I need you

</l>
<l>Without you life I can't bear

</l>
<l>You don't know

</l>
<l>You don't know baby

</l>
<l>You don't know how much I love you

</l>
<l>And you can't know just how I feel



</l>
<l>The flame is still burnin'

</l>
<l>Burnin' deep down in my soul

</l>
<l>When I think of your love and kisses

</l>
<l>It makes my blood run cold

</l>
<l>You don't know baby

</l>
<l>You don't know baby

</l>
<l>Yes you don't know how much I love you

</l>
<l>And you can't know just how I feel



</l>
<l>All my friends call me crazy

</l>
<l>For acting the way that I do

</l>
<l>But I just can't help myself

</l>
<l>'Cause I'm so in love with you

</l>
<l>You don't know

</l>
<l>Yes baby you don't know

</l>
<l>You don't know how much I love you

</l>
<l>And you can't know just how I feel



</l>
<l>You don't know

</l>
<l>You don't know

</l>
<l>You don't know baby

</l>
<l>You don't know

</l>
<l>You don't know

</l>
<l>You don't know baby

</l>
<l>You don't know



</l>
<l>Yes you don't know how much I love you

</l>
<l>And you can't know just how I feel</l></lyrics></xml>
