<lyrics>



I got a kindhearted mama, do anything in this world for me

I got a kindhearted mama, do anything in this world for me

But these evil-hearted women, man, they will not let me be



I love my baby, my baby don't love me

I love my baby, ooooh, my baby don't love me

I really love that woman, can't stand to leave her be



Now there ain't but the one thing, makes Mister Johnson
drink
1

I get's worried
2
 about how you treat me, baby, I begin to
think

Oh babe, my life don't feel the same

You breaks my heart, when you call Mister So-and-So's name



She's a kindhearted mama, she studies evil all the time

She's a kindhearted woman, but she studies evil all the time

You well's
3
 to kill me, as to have it on your mind



Some day, some day, I would shake your hand goodbye

Some day, some day, I would shake your hand goodbye

I can't give you anymore of my lovin', 'cause I just ain't
satisfied



__________

Note 1: alternatively "dream" instead of "drink"

Note 2: alternatively "I's worried" instead of "I get's worried"

Note 3: a dialectic contraction of "had just as well", still in comon
usage
