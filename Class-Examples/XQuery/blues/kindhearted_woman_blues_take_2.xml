<lyrics>


<l>I got a kindhearted mama, do anything in this world for me

</l>
<l>I got a kindhearted mama, do anything in this world for me

</l>
<l>But these evil-hearted women, man, they will not let me be



</l>
<l>I love my baby, my baby don't love me

</l>
<l>I love my baby, ooooh, my baby don't love me

</l>
<l>I really love that woman, can't stand to leave her be



</l>
<l>Now there ain't but the one thing, makes Mister Johnson
drink
1

</l>
<l>I get's worried
2
about how you treat me, baby, I begin to </l>
<l>think

</l>
<l>Oh babe, my life don't feel the same

</l>
<l>You breaks my heart, when you call Mister So-and-So's name



</l>
<l>She's a kindhearted mama, she studies evil all the time

</l>
<l>She's a kindhearted woman, but she studies evil all the time

</l>
<l>You well's
3
 </l><l>to kill me, as to have it on your mind</l>

<l>Some day, some day, I would shake your hand goodbye

</l>
<l>Some day, some day, I would shake your hand goodbye

</l>
<l>I can't give you anymore of my lovin', 'cause I just ain't
satisfied



</l>

<note>Note 1: alternatively "dream" instead of "drink"



Note 2: alternatively "I's worried" instead of "I get's worried"

Note 3: a dialectic contraction of "had just as well", still in comon

usage</note></lyrics></xml>
