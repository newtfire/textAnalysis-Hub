<lyrics>



Hey baby, baby

Hey, hey, hey hey, hey hey child

Child, child, oh



Hey, hey, baby

Hey, hey, hey, hey hey, child



Say come on baby and tell me one more time

Alright, honey, come on baby and tell about it one more time

I said 25 minutes is all I have at hand



Said go, go and take me in your arms

Say go and take me in your arms

You can buy me a house, you can buy me anything you want



I want a house in the country at the time that I think came on

I want a house in the country at the time that I think came on

So I'll call you baby once when I need any more, hey!



Hey, hey, baby hey

Hey, hey, baby hey

Hey, hey, baby hey



I said hey, hey, baby hey

Oh, hey, hey, baby hey

Hey, hey, baby hey



Hey, hey, hey, baby hey

Hey, hey, hey, baby hey

Hey, hey, hey, baby hey



I said hey, hey, hey, baby hey, hey!

Hey, hey, hey, baby hey

Hey, hey, hey, baby hey

Have a ham sandwich?
