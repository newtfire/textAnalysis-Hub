<lyrics>


<l>This is a mean old world, baby to live in all by yourself

</l>
<l>Yes it's a mean old world, baby to live in all by yourself

</l>
<l>Yes, you can't get the woman you love and you have to put up with

somebody else




</l>
<l>Baby, I smile to keep from worryin' and I laugh just to keep from
cryin'

</l>
<l>Oh I smile to keep from worryin', baby and I laugh just to keep from
cryin'

</l>
<l>Well, that's to keep the public for knowin' what I got on my mind



</l>
<l>Yes, someday baby, when the blood runs cold in my vein

</l>
<l>Yes, someday baby, when the blood runs cold in my vein

</l><l>Well, I hope You'll around by here to mistreat me baby, 'cause my</l>
<l>heart it feel no pain</l></lyrics></xml>
