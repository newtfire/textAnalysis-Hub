<lyrics>



This is a mean old world, baby to live in all by yourself

Yes it's a mean old world, baby to live in all by yourself

Yes, you can't get the woman you love and you have to put up with
somebody else



Baby, I smile to keep from worryin' and I laugh just to keep from
cryin'

Oh I smile to keep from worryin', baby and I laugh just to keep from
cryin'

Well, that's to keep the public for knowin' what I got on my mind



Yes, someday baby, when the blood runs cold in my vein

Yes, someday baby, when the blood runs cold in my vein

Well, I hope You'll around by here to mistreat me baby, 'cause my
heart it feel no pain
