<lyrics>



Hello there, my old friend,

not so long ago it was 'till the end

We played outside in the pouring rain,

on our way up the road we started over again



You're livin' a dream, wo you on top

My mind is achin', Lord it won't stop

That's how it happens, livin' life by the drop



Up and down that road in our worn out shoes,

talkin' 'bout good things and signin' the blues

You went your way, I stayed behind

We both knew it was just a matter of time



You're livin' a dream, wo you on top

My mind is achin', Lord it won't stop

That's how it happens, livin' life by the drop



No wasted time, we're alive today

Churnin' up the past, there's no easier way

Time's been between us, a means to an end

God it's good to be here walkin' together my friend



You're livin' a dream, wo you on top

My mind is achin', Lord it won't stop

That's how it happens, livin' life by the drop

That's how it happens, livin' life by the drop

That's how it happens, livin' life by the drop
