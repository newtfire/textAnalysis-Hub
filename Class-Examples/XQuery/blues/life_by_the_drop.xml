<lyrics>


<l>Hello there, my old friend,

</l>
<l>not so long ago it was 'till the end

</l>
<l>We played outside in the pouring rain,

</l>
<l>on our way up the road we started over again



</l>
<l>You're livin' a dream, wo you on top

</l>
<l>My mind is achin', Lord it won't stop

</l>
<l>That's how it happens, livin' life by the drop



</l>
<l>Up and down that road in our worn out shoes,

</l>
<l>talkin' 'bout good things and signin' the blues

</l>
<l>You went your way, I stayed behind

</l>
<l>We both knew it was just a matter of time



</l>
<l>You're livin' a dream, wo you on top

</l>
<l>My mind is achin', Lord it won't stop

</l>
<l>That's how it happens, livin' life by the drop



</l>
<l>No wasted time, we're alive today

</l>
<l>Churnin' up the past, there's no easier way

</l>
<l>Time's been between us, a means to an end

</l>
<l>God it's good to be here walkin' together my friend



</l>
<l>You're livin' a dream, wo you on top

</l>
<l>My mind is achin', Lord it won't stop

</l>
<l>That's how it happens, livin' life by the drop

</l>
<l>That's how it happens, livin' life by the drop

</l>
<l>That's how it happens, livin' life by the drop
