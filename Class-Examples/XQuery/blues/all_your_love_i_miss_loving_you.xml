Wo the love I miss lovin', all the kiss I miss kissin'

Wo the love I miss lovin', all the kiss I miss kissin'

Before I met you baby, I didn't know what I was missin'



Wo the love pretty baby, I have in store for you

Wo the love pretty baby, I have in store for you

The way I love you baby, I know you'll love me too



Oh wo wo baby, yes I love you baby

Oh wo yeah,

you know I love you little darlin'

Yes I love you little lamb, so glad your mine



Wo wo wo wo wo wo wo yeah, yeah yeah yeah

Oh wo yeah

You know I love you little baby

Yes I love you little baby, so glad your mine



Wo the love I miss lovin', all the kiss I miss kissin'

Wo the love I miss lovin', all the kiss I miss kissin'

The way I love you baby, I didn't know what I was missin'



Wo the love pretty baby, I have in store for you

Wo the love pretty baby, I have in store for you

The way I love you darlin', I know you'll love me too



Wo wo wo baby, yes I love you baby

Oh wo yeah, you know I love you little lamb

Yes I love you little baby, so glad your mine
