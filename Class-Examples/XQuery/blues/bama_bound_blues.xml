<lyrics>



Mister engineer, please turn your train around

Mister engineer, please turn your train around

I believe to my soul, my man is Bama
1
 bound



Take me back daddy, try me one more time

Take me back daddy, try me one more time

And if I don't please you, break my neck for trying



But the train passed by with my daddy on the inside

The train passed by with my daddy on the inside

I could do nothing but hang my head and I cried



My mama told me, my papa told me too

My mama told me, my papa told me too

Some brownskin man is going to be the death of you



I'm Bama bound, ain't got no railroad fare

I'm Bama bound, ain't got no railroad fare

If the blues don't leave me, I'll walk the railroad there



__________

Note 1: Bama, Alabama.
