<l>Mister engineer, please turn your train around

</l>
<l>Mister engineer, please turn your train around

</l>
<l>I believe to my soul, my man is Bama
1
bound </l>

<l>Take me back daddy, try me one more time

</l>
<l>Take me back daddy, try me one more time

</l>
<l>And if I don't please you, break my neck for trying



</l>
<l>But the train passed by with my daddy on the inside

</l>
<l>The train passed by with my daddy on the inside

</l>
<l>I could do nothing but hang my head and I cried



</l>
<l>My mama told me, my papa told me too

</l>
<l>My mama told me, my papa told me too

</l>
<l>Some brownskin man is going to be the death of you



</l>
<l>I'm Bama bound, ain't got no railroad fare

</l>
<l>I'm Bama bound, ain't got no railroad fare

</l>
<l>If the blues don't leave me, I'll walk the railroad there



</l>
