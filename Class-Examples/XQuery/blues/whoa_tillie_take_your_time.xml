<lyrics>


<l>Tillie Brown was a dancing fool

</l>
<l>Spent her time in a dancing school

</l>
<l>When the band would play

</l>
<l>Tillie would start right in to sway

</l>
<l>First one out on the ballroom floor

</l>
<l>She never got enough, she just craved for more

</l>
<l>When she start to sway

</l>
<l>All the girls and boys would say



</l>
<l>Whoa, Tillie, take your time

</l>
<l>Whoa, Tillie, take your time

</l>
<l>There ain't no use to hurrying 'cause you wanna prance

</l>
<l>You've got all night to do that dance

</l>
<l>Whoa, Tillie, lay 'em down

</l>
<l>Whoa, Tillie Brown

</l>
<l>You don't know what to shake

</l>
<l>When you shake

</l>
<l>What to break

</l>
<l>Whoa, Tillie, take your time



</l>
<l>Whoa, Tillie, take your time

</l>
<l>Whoa, Tillie, take your time

</l>
<l>There ain't no use to hurrying 'cause you wanna prance

</l>
<l>Look out there, Tillie, you got all night to do that dance

</l>
<l>Whoa, Tillie, lay 'em down

</l>
<l>Whoa, Tillie, Tillie Brown

</l>
<l>You don't know what to shake

</l>
<l>When you shake

</l>
<l>What to break

</l>
<l>Whoa, Tillie, take your time</l></lyrics></xml>
