<lyrics>



Tillie Brown was a dancing fool

Spent her time in a dancing school

When the band would play

Tillie would start right in to sway

First one out on the ballroom floor

She never got enough, she just craved for more

When she start to sway

All the girls and boys would say



Whoa, Tillie, take your time

Whoa, Tillie, take your time

There ain't no use to hurrying 'cause you wanna prance

You've got all night to do that dance

Whoa, Tillie, lay 'em down

Whoa, Tillie Brown

You don't know what to shake

When you shake

What to break

Whoa, Tillie, take your time



Whoa, Tillie, take your time

Whoa, Tillie, take your time

There ain't no use to hurrying 'cause you wanna prance

Look out there, Tillie, you got all night to do that dance

Whoa, Tillie, lay 'em down

Whoa, Tillie, Tillie Brown

You don't know what to shake

When you shake

What to break

Whoa, Tillie, take your time
