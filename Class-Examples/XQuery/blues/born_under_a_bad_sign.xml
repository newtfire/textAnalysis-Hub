<lyrics>



One, two

Born under a bad sign

I been down since I begin to crawl

If it wasn't for bad luck, I wouldn't have no luck at all



Hard luck and trouble is my only friend

I been on my own ever since I was ten

Born under a bad sign

I been down since I begin to crawl

If it wasn't for bad luck, I wouldn't have no luck at all



I can't read, haven't learned how to write

My whole life has been one big fight

Born under a bad sign

I been down since I begin to crawl

If it wasn't for bad luck, I wouldn't have no luck at all



I ain't lyin'

If it wasn't for bad luck I wouldn't have no kind-a luck

If it wasn't for real bad luck, I wouldn't have no luck at all



Wine and women is all I crave

A big legged woman is gonna carry me to my grave

Born under a bad sign

I been down since I begin to crawl

If it wasn't for bad luck, I wouldn't have no luck at all



Yeah, my bad luck boy

Been havin' bad luck all of my days, yes
