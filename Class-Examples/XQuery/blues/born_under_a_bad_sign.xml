<lyrics>


<l>One, two

</l>
<l>Born under a bad sign

</l>
<l>I been down since I begin to crawl

</l>
<l>If it wasn't for bad luck, I wouldn't have no luck at all



</l>
<l>Hard luck and trouble is my only friend

</l>
<l>I been on my own ever since I was ten

</l>
<l>Born under a bad sign

</l>
<l>I been down since I begin to crawl

</l>
<l>If it wasn't for bad luck, I wouldn't have no luck at all



</l>
<l>I can't read, haven't learned how to write

</l>
<l>My whole life has been one big fight

</l>
<l>Born under a bad sign

</l>
<l>I been down since I begin to crawl

</l>
<l>If it wasn't for bad luck, I wouldn't have no luck at all



</l>
<l>I ain't lyin'

</l>
<l>If it wasn't for bad luck I wouldn't have no kind-a luck

</l>
<l>If it wasn't for real bad luck, I wouldn't have no luck at all



</l>
<l>Wine and women is all I crave

</l>
<l>A big legged woman is gonna carry me to my grave

</l>
<l>Born under a bad sign

</l>
<l>I been down since I begin to crawl

</l>
<l>If it wasn't for bad luck, I wouldn't have no luck at all



</l>
<l>Yeah, my bad luck boy

</l>
<l>Been havin' bad luck all of my days, yes</l></lyrics></xml>
