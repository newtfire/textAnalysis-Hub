<lyrics>

<l>My bluebird, bluebird, please take this letter down south for
me

</l>
<l>Now, bluebird, bluebird, please take this letter down south for
me

</l>
<l>Now you can tell my baby, I'm up here in St. Louis, oh, but I'm just
as blue as I can be



</l>
<l>Now, bluebird, when you get to Jackson
1
, I want you to fly
down on Shannon Street

</l>
<l>Now, bluebird when you get to Jackson, I want you to fly down on
Shannon Street

</l>
<l>Well, but I don't want you to stop flyin', until you find Miss Lacey
Belle, for me



</l>
<l>Now bluebird, when you find Miss Lacey Belle, I want you to please
give her my best regard

</l>
<l>Now bluebird, when you find Miss Lacey Belle, oh, give her my best
regard

</l>
<l>Well, that you can tell her I'm up here in St. Louis but these times
is awful doggone hard



</l>
<l>Now bluebird, she may not be at home but please, knock on her
door

</l>
<l>Now bluebird, she may not be at home but please knock on her door

</l>
<l>Well , but she might be right across the street, visitin' her next
door neighbor, you know
