<lyrics>



My bluebird, bluebird, please take this letter down south for
me

Now, bluebird, bluebird, please take this letter down south for
me

Now you can tell my baby, I'm up here in St. Louis, oh, but I'm just
as blue as I can be



Now, bluebird, when you get to Jackson
1
, I want you to fly
down on Shannon Street

Now, bluebird when you get to Jackson, I want you to fly down on
Shannon Street

Well, but I don't want you to stop flyin', until you find Miss Lacey
Belle, for me



Now bluebird, when you find Miss Lacey Belle, I want you to please
give her my best regard

Now bluebird, when you find Miss Lacey Belle, oh, give her my best
regard

Well, that you can tell her I'm up here in St. Louis but these times
is awful doggone hard



Now bluebird, she may not be at home but please, knock on her
door

Now bluebird, she may not be at home but please knock on her door

Well , but she might be right across the street, visitin' her next
door neighbor, you know



__________

Note 1: Jackson, Tennessee.
