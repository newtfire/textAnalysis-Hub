Ahh!



Bobby sox baby, I've got to let you go

Bobby sox baby, I've got to let you go

You've got a head full of nothin'

But stage, screen an radio



You chase autographs, every night

You write fan mail through the day

You keep your great big head in the scrapbook

Yes, and you throw the cookbook away



Bobby sox baby, I've got to let you go

You've got a head full of nothin'

But stage, screen an radio



Now you treat me like a stranger

You don't have a word to say

I ask you if you love me

You say, "What would Frankie, say?"



Yes bobby sox baby

I've got to let you go

You've got a head full of nothin'

But stage, screen an radio
