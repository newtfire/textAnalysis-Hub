<l>Ahh!



</l>
<l>Bobby sox baby, I've got to let you go

</l>
<l>Bobby sox baby, I've got to let you go

</l>
<l>You've got a head full of nothin'

</l>
<l>But stage, screen an radio



</l>
<l>You chase autographs, every night

</l>
<l>You write fan mail through the day

</l>
<l>You keep your great big head in the scrapbook

</l>
<l>Yes, and you throw the cookbook away



</l>
<l>Bobby sox baby, I've got to let you go

</l>
<l>You've got a head full of nothin'

</l>
<l>But stage, screen an radio



</l>
<l>Now you treat me like a stranger

</l>
<l>You don't have a word to say

</l>
<l>I ask you if you love me

</l>
<l>You say, "What would Frankie, say?"



</l>
<l>Yes bobby sox baby

</l>
<l>I've got to let you go

</l>
<l>You've got a head full of nothin'

</l>
<l>But stage, screen an radio</l></lyrics></xml>
