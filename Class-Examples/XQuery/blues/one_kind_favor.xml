<l>Just one kind favor I ask of you

</l>
<l>One kind favor I ask of you

</l>
<l>One kind favor, I ask of you

</l>
<l>To see that my grave is kept clean



</l>
<l>If you ever hear a church bell toll

</l>
<l>If you ever hear a church bell toll

</l>
<l>If you ever hear, a church bell toll

</l>
<l>You'll know by that I'm dead and gone



</l>
<l>Dig my grave with a silver spade

</l>
<l>Dig my grave with a silver spade

</l>
<l>Dig my grave, with a silver spade

</l>
<l>Mark the place where I would lay



</l>
<l>Just one kind favor I ask of you

</l>
<l>One kind favor I ask of you

</l>
<l>One kind favor, I ask of you

</l>
<l>See that my grave is kept clean

</l>
<l>See that my grave is kept clean

</l>
<l>See my grave is kept clean



</l>
