<lyrics>



Just one kind favor I ask of you

One kind favor I ask of you

One kind favor, I ask of you

To see that my grave is kept clean



If you ever hear a church bell toll

If you ever hear a church bell toll

If you ever hear, a church bell toll

You'll know by that I'm dead and gone



Dig my grave with a silver spade

Dig my grave with a silver spade

Dig my grave, with a silver spade

Mark the place where I would lay



Just one kind favor I ask of you

One kind favor I ask of you

One kind favor, I ask of you

See that my grave is kept clean

See that my grave is kept clean

See my grave is kept clean
