<lyrics>



When you're sad and lonely

Thinking about you only

Feeling disgusted and blue

Ah, your heart is aching

Yes, it's almost breaking

No one to tell your troubles to

That's the time you'll hang your head,

And begin to cry



All your friends forsake you,

Trouble overtakes you

And your good man turns you down

Evil talk about you

Everybody doubt you

And your friends can't be found

Not a soul to ease your pain

You will plead in vain

You've got those bleeding hearted blues

Say baby, tell me what's on your mind

Pretty papa, tell me what's on your mind

You keep my poor heart achin'

I'm worried all the time



I give up every friend that I had

Yes, I give up every friend that I had

I give up my mother

I even give up dear old dad
