<lyrics>


<l>When you're sad and lonely

</l>
<l>Thinking about you only

</l>
<l>Feeling disgusted and blue

</l>
<l>Ah, your heart is aching

</l>
<l>Yes, it's almost breaking

</l>
<l>No one to tell your troubles to

</l>
<l>That's the time you'll hang your head,

</l>
<l>And begin to cry



</l>
<l>All your friends forsake you,

</l>
<l>Trouble overtakes you

</l>
<l>And your good man turns you down

</l>
<l>Evil talk about you

</l>
<l>Everybody doubt you

</l>
<l>And your friends can't be found

</l>
<l>Not a soul to ease your pain

</l>
<l>You will plead in vain

</l>
<l>You've got those bleeding hearted blues

</l>
<l>Say baby, tell me what's on your mind

</l>
<l>Pretty papa, tell me what's on your mind

</l>
<l>You keep my poor heart achin'

</l>
<l>I'm worried all the time



</l>
<l>I give up every friend that I had

</l>
<l>Yes, I give up every friend that I had

</l>
<l>I give up my mother

</l>
<l>I even give up dear old dad</l></lyrics></xml>
