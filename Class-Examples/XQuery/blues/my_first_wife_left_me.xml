<lyrics>



When my first wife left me, she left my heart in misery

When my first wife left me, she left my heart in misery

Ever since that day boy, I don't think I'll ever love again



If I can get her back again, I'll never roam no more

If I get her back again, boys, I never roam no more

I had a good wife, but I did not treat her right



It's my fault, only have myself to blame

It's my fault, it's my fault boys, I only have myself to blame

She would have been home right now, if I hadn't wanted every woman
that I seen



I found out one thing, these women don't mean you no good

I found out one thing people, these women don't mean you no good

You mistreated a good girl for some woman, that she'd turn around and
turn her back on you

Yes, yeah



I'm having bad luck, having bad luck ever since she been gone

I'm having bad luck, bad luck, bad luck, ever since my baby been
gone

When she was at home, Lord, I did not treat her right
