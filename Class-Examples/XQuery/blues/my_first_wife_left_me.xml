<lyrics>


<l>When my first wife left me, she left my heart in misery

</l>
<l>When my first wife left me, she left my heart in misery

</l>
<l>Ever since that day boy, I don't think I'll ever love again



</l>
<l>If I can get her back again, I'll never roam no more

</l>
<l>If I get her back again, boys, I never roam no more

</l>
<l>I had a good wife, but I did not treat her right



</l>
<l>It's my fault, only have myself to blame

</l>
<l>It's my fault, it's my fault boys, I only have myself to blame

</l>
<l>She would have been home right now, if I hadn't wanted every woman

that I seen




</l>
<l>I found out one thing, these women don't mean you no good

</l>
<l>I found out one thing people, these women don't mean you no good

</l>
<l>You mistreated a good girl for some woman, that she'd turn around and
turn her back on you

</l>
<l>Yes, yeah



</l>
<l>I'm having bad luck, having bad luck ever since she been gone

</l>
<l>I'm having bad luck, bad luck, bad luck, ever since my baby been
gone

</l>
<l>When she was at home, Lord, I did not treat her right</l></lyrics></xml>
