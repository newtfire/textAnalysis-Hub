<lyrics>



Well, the blind man, he stood on the way and cried

Blind man, he stood on the way and cried

Blind man stood on the way and cried



Crying, "Oh, show me the way, show me the way

Show me the way, the way to go home"



My daddy stood on that-a way and cried

My daddy stood on that-a way and cried

Daddy stood on the way and cried



Crying, "Oh, show me the way, show me the way

Show me the way, the way to go home"



Now now now, the blind man, he stood on the way and cried

Blind man, he stood on the way and cried

Blind man stood on the way and cried



Crying, "Oh, show me the way, show me the way

Show me the way, the way to go home"



"Show me the way, show me the way,

Show me the way, the way to go home"
