<lyrics>


<l>Well, the blind man, he stood on the way and cried

</l>
<l>Blind man, he stood on the way and cried

</l>
<l>Blind man stood on the way and cried



</l>
<l>Crying, "Oh, show me the way, show me the way

</l>
<l>Show me the way, the way to go home"



</l>
<l>My daddy stood on that-a way and cried

</l>
<l>My daddy stood on that-a way and cried

</l>
<l>Daddy stood on the way and cried



</l>
<l>Crying, "Oh, show me the way, show me the way

</l>
<l>Show me the way, the way to go home"



</l>
<l>Now now now, the blind man, he stood on the way and cried

</l>
<l>Blind man, he stood on the way and cried

</l>
<l>Blind man stood on the way and cried



</l>
<l>Crying, "Oh, show me the way, show me the way

</l>
<l>Show me the way, the way to go home"



</l>
<l>"Show me the way, show me the way,

</l>
<l>Show me the way, the way to go home"</l></lyrics></xml>
