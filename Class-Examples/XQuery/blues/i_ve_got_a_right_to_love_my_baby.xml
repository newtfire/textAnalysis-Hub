<lyrics>



I've got a right to love my baby, she treats me just like a
king

I've got a right to love my woman, she treats me just like a king

Yes, she's my mind, body and soul, yes, my baby, she can do 'most
anything



Yes, she's my doctor when I'm sick, people, she's my all-around
standby

Oh, she's my lawyer when I'm in trouble, people, she's my mother when
I wanna cry

Yes, I've got a right to love my baby, oh, can't you see the reason
why?



Oh, that gives me the right to love my woman, she's always here by my
side

Oh, my sweet understanding baby, she makes my temperature rise

Yes, and when it comes to kind treating people, my baby's an angel in
disguise



Oh, when I'm sick she is my doctor, when I'm well she's my pride and
joy

Yes, when I'm cold she's my cover, yes, she calls me her little baby
boy

Yes, when I'm tired and wanna play, people, it's my baby that's my
toy
