<lyrics>


<l>I've got a right to love my baby, she treats me just like a
king

</l>
<l>I've got a right to love my woman, she treats me just like a king

</l>
<l>Yes, she's my mind, body and soul, yes, my baby, she can do 'most

anything




</l>
<l>Yes, she's my doctor when I'm sick, people, she's my all-around
standby

</l>
<l>Oh, she's my lawyer when I'm in trouble, people, she's my mother when
I wanna cry

</l>
<l>Yes, I've got a right to love my baby, oh, can't you see the reason

why?




</l>
<l>Oh, that gives me the right to love my woman, she's always here by my
side

</l>
<l>Oh, my sweet understanding baby, she makes my temperature rise

</l>
<l>Yes, and when it comes to kind treating people, my baby's an angel in

disguise




</l>
<l>Oh, when I'm sick she is my doctor, when I'm well she's my pride and
joy

</l>
<l>Yes, when I'm cold she's my cover, yes, she calls me her little baby
boy

</l><l>Yes, when I'm tired and wanna play, people, it's my baby that's my</l>
<l>toy</l></lyrics></xml>
