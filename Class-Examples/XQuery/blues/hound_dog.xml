<lyrics>


<l>You ain't nothin' but a hound dog, been snooping round my door

</l>
<l>You ain't nothin' but a hound dog, been snooping round my door

</l>
<l>You can wag your tail but Lord I ain't gonna feed you no more



</l>
<l>You told me you were high class, but I can see through that

</l>
<l>You told me you were high class, but I can see through that

</l>
<l>And daddy I know you ain't no real cool cat



</l>
<l>You ain't nothin' but a hound dog, been snooping round my door

</l>
<l>You ain't nothin' but a hound dog, been snooping round my door

</l>
<l>You can wag your tail but Lord I ain't gonna feed you no more



</l>
<l>You made me feel so blue, you made me weep and moan

</l>
<l>You made me feel so blue, you made me weep and moan

</l>
<l>You ain't looking for a woman, Lord knows what you're looking for



</l>
<l>You ain't nothin' but a hound dog, been snooping round my door

</l>
<l>You ain't nothin' but a hound dog, been snooping round my door

</l>
<l>You can wag your tail but Lord I ain't gonna feed you no more</l></lyrics></xml>
