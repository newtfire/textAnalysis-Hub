<lyrics>



You ain't nothin' but a hound dog, been snooping round my door

You ain't nothin' but a hound dog, been snooping round my door

You can wag your tail but Lord I ain't gonna feed you no more



You told me you were high class, but I can see through that

You told me you were high class, but I can see through that

And daddy I know you ain't no real cool cat



You ain't nothin' but a hound dog, been snooping round my door

You ain't nothin' but a hound dog, been snooping round my door

You can wag your tail but Lord I ain't gonna feed you no more



You made me feel so blue, you made me weep and moan

You made me feel so blue, you made me weep and moan

You ain't looking for a woman, Lord knows what you're looking for



You ain't nothin' but a hound dog, been snooping round my door

You ain't nothin' but a hound dog, been snooping round my door

You can wag your tail but Lord I ain't gonna feed you no more
