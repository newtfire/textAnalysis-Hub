<lyrics>

<l>I walked 47 miles of barbed wire, I use a cobra snake for a
necktie

</l>
<l>I got a brand new house on the roadside, made from rattlesnake
hide

</l>
<l>I got a brand new chimney made on top, made out of a human skull

</l>
<l>Now come on, take a little walk with me, Arlene and tell me:

</l>
<l>who do you love?

</l>
<l>who do you love?



</l>
<l>Who do you love?

</l>
<l>Who do you love?

</l>
<l>Who do you love?

</l>
<l>Who do you love?



</l>
<l>I've got a tombstone hand and a graveyard mind, I'm just twenty-two
and I don't mind dyin'

</l>
<l>Who do you love?

</l>
<l>Who do you love?

</l>
<l>Who do you love?

</l>
<l>Who do you love?



</l>
<l>I rode around the town'n use a rattlesnake whip, take it easy Arlene
don't give me no lip

</l>
<l>Who do you love?

</l>
<l>Who do you love?

</l>
<l>Who do you love?

</l>
<l>Who do you love?



</l>
<l>The night was dark and the sky was blue, down the alley a house wagon
flew

</l>
<l>Hit a bump and somebody screamed, you should'a heard just what I
seen

</l>
<l>Who do you love?

</l>
<l>Who do you love?

</l>
<l>Who do you love?

</l>
<l>Who do you love?



</l>
<l>Arlene took me by my hand, she said, "Ooo-eee Bo, I understand"

</l>
<l>Who do you love?

</l>
<l>Who do you love?

</l>
<l>Who do you love?

</l>
<l>Who do you love?
