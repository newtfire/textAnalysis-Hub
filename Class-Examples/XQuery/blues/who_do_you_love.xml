<lyrics>



I walked 47 miles of barbed wire, I use a cobra snake for a
necktie

I got a brand new house on the roadside, made from rattlesnake
hide

I got a brand new chimney made on top, made out of a human skull

Now come on, take a little walk with me, Arlene and tell me:

who do you love?

who do you love?



Who do you love?

Who do you love?

Who do you love?

Who do you love?



I've got a tombstone hand and a graveyard mind, I'm just twenty-two
and I don't mind dyin'

Who do you love?

Who do you love?

Who do you love?

Who do you love?



I rode around the town'n use a rattlesnake whip, take it easy Arlene
don't give me no lip

Who do you love?

Who do you love?

Who do you love?

Who do you love?



The night was dark and the sky was blue, down the alley a house wagon
flew

Hit a bump and somebody screamed, you should'a heard just what I
seen

Who do you love?

Who do you love?

Who do you love?

Who do you love?



Arlene took me by my hand, she said, "Ooo-eee Bo, I understand"

Who do you love?

Who do you love?

Who do you love?

Who do you love?
