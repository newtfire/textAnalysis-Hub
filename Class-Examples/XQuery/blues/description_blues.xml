<lyrics>


<l>I was in love with a married woman, an I just couldn't help
myself

</l>
<l>I was in love with a married woman, an I just couldn't help
myself

</l>
<l>But I don't go 'round breakin' up families, an' that's the reason why

I left




</l>
<l>She looked at me like she could kill me, when I said that we were
through

</l>
<l>She looked at me like she could kill me, when I said that we were
through

</l>
<l>I'm on the side that's doin' the buildin', and not the wreckin'

crew




</l>
<l>There are so many women, that are footloose an fancy free

</l>
<l>There are so many single women, that are footloose an fancy free

</l><l>So why should I fool with a married woman, who can't can't do a thing</l>
<l>for me?</l></lyrics></xml>
