<lyrics>



I was in love with a married woman, an I just couldn't help
myself

I was in love with a married woman, an I just couldn't help
myself

But I don't go 'round breakin' up families, an' that's the reason why
I left



She looked at me like she could kill me, when I said that we were
through

She looked at me like she could kill me, when I said that we were
through

I'm on the side that's doin' the buildin', and not the wreckin'
crew



There are so many women, that are footloose an fancy free

There are so many single women, that are footloose an fancy free

So why should I fool with a married woman, who can't can't do a thing
for me?
