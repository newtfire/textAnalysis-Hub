<l>Early this morning, the blues came walking in my room

</l>
<l>Early this morning, the blues came walking in my room

</l>
<l>I said, "Blues, please tell me what you are doing here so soon?"



</l>
<l>The looked at me and smiled but yet, they refused to say

</l>
<l>The looked at me and smiled but yet, they refused to say

</l>
<l>Asked the again, the they turned and walked away



</l>
<l>Blues oh, blues, you know you've been here before

</l>
<l>Blues oh, blues, you know you've been here before

</l><l>The last time you were here you made me cry and walk the floor</l></lyrics></xml>
