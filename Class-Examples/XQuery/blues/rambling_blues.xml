<lyrics>



Early this morning, the blues came walking in my room

Early this morning, the blues came walking in my room

I said, "Blues, please tell me what you are doing here so soon?"



The looked at me and smiled but yet, they refused to say

The looked at me and smiled but yet, they refused to say

Asked the again, the they turned and walked away



Blues oh, blues, you know you've been here before

Blues oh, blues, you know you've been here before

The last time you were here you made me cry and walk the floor
