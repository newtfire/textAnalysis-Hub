<lyrics>


<l>Well she hot as red pepper, sweeter than cherry pie

</l>
<l>I'm so glad she love me, love me all the time

</l>
<l>Cutest little baby, sweet as she can be

</l>
<l>All that love she got, it belongs to me



</l>
<l>If you hear me howlin'

</l>
<l>Callin' on my darlin'

</l>
<l>Mmmm, mmmm, mmmm



</l>
<l>Well she kiss me in the mornin', make the lights go out

</l>
<l>Early in the mornin' she makes me jump and shout

</l>
<l>That bad left she's got makes me really try

</l>
<l>Makes me really know I'm too young to die



</l>
<l>When you hear me howlin'

</l>
<l>Callin' on my darlin'

</l>
<l>Mmmm, mmmm, mmmm



</l>
<l>Well she kiss me in the mornin', make the lights go out

</l>
<l>Early in the mornin' she makes me jump and shout

</l>
<l>That bad left she's got makes me really try

</l>
<l>Makes me really know I'm too young to die



</l>
<l>When you hear me howlin'

</l>
<l>Callin' on my darlin'

</l>
<l>Mmmm, mmmm, mmmm



</l>
<l>Well she hot as red pepper, sweeter than cherry pie

</l>
<l>I'm so glad she love me, love me all the time

</l>
<l>Cutest little baby, sweet as she can be

</l>
<l>All that love she got, it belongs to me



</l>
<l>If you hear me howlin'
