<lyrics>



Well she hot as red pepper, sweeter than cherry pie

I'm so glad she love me, love me all the time

Cutest little baby, sweet as she can be

All that love she got, it belongs to me



If you hear me howlin'

Callin' on my darlin'

Mmmm, mmmm, mmmm



Well she kiss me in the mornin', make the lights go out

Early in the mornin' she makes me jump and shout

That bad left she's got makes me really try

Makes me really know I'm too young to die



When you hear me howlin'

Callin' on my darlin'

Mmmm, mmmm, mmmm



Well she kiss me in the mornin', make the lights go out

Early in the mornin' she makes me jump and shout

That bad left she's got makes me really try

Makes me really know I'm too young to die



When you hear me howlin'

Callin' on my darlin'

Mmmm, mmmm, mmmm



Well she hot as red pepper, sweeter than cherry pie

I'm so glad she love me, love me all the time

Cutest little baby, sweet as she can be

All that love she got, it belongs to me



If you hear me howlin'

Callin' on my darlin'

Mmmm, mmmm, mmmm
