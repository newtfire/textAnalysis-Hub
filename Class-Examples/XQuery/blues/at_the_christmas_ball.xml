<l>"Hey Bessie it's Christmas here"

</l>
<l>Here! Here! Hurray for Christmas



</l>
<l>Christmas comes but once a year, and to me it brings good cheer,

</l>
<l>and to everyone who likes wine and beer

</l>
<l>Happy New Year is after that, happy I'll be, that is a fact

</l>
<l>That is why I like to hear, folks I say that Christmas is here



</l>
<l>Christmas bells will ring real soon, even in the afternoon

</l>
<l>There'll be no chimes shall ring at the Christmas Ball

</l>
<l>Everyone must watch their step, or they will loose their
rep
1

</l>
<l>Everybody full of fare at the Christmas Ball



</l>
<l>(Excellent Joe Smith solo)



</l>
<l>Grab your partner one an' all, keep on dancing 'round the hall

</l>
<l>Then there's no one to fall, don't you dare to 
strut

</l>
<l>If your partner don't act fair, don't worry there's some more over
there

</l>
<l>Seekin' a chance everywhere at the Christmas Ball
