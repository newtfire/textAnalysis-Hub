"Hey Bessie it's Christmas here"

Here! Here! Hurray for Christmas



Christmas comes but once a year, and to me it brings good cheer,

and to everyone who likes wine and beer

Happy New Year is after that, happy I'll be, that is a fact

That is why I like to hear, folks I say that Christmas is here



Christmas bells will ring real soon, even in the afternoon

There'll be no chimes shall ring at the Christmas Ball

Everyone must watch their step, or they will loose their
rep
1

Everybody full of fare at the Christmas Ball



(Excellent Joe Smith solo)



Grab your partner one an' all, keep on dancing 'round the hall

Then there's no one to fall, don't you dare to 
strut

If your partner don't act fair, don't worry there's some more over
there

Seekin' a chance everywhere at the Christmas Ball
