<lyrics>



Bluebird, please take this letter down south for me

Oh, bluebird take this letter down south for me

Don't you two start flyin', 'til you find little Liza Belle for
me



Lord, she way down, she's way down in 
Jackson,
Tennessee

Bluebird, she's way down south in Jackson, Tennessee

She may not be home but please knock upon her door



Bluebird, bluebird, please do this for me

Ooh, bluebird, please do this for me

If you see my baby, tell her I want her to come back home to me
