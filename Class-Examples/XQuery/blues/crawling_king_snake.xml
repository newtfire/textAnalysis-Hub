<lyrics>


<l>You know I'm a crawlin' kingsnake baby, and I rules my den

</l>
<l>You know I'm a crawlin' kingsnake baby, and I rules my den

</l>
<l>I don't want you hangin' around my mate, wanna use her for myself



</l>
<l>You know you caught me crawlin' baby when the, when the grass was
very high

</l>
<l>I'm just gonna keep on crawlin' now baby until the day I die,

</l>
<l>because I'm a crawlin' kingsnake baby, and I rules my den

</l>
<l>Don't you hangin' around my mate, wanna use her for myself



</l>
<l>You know I'm gon' crawl up to your window baby,

</l>
<l>wanna crawl up to your door, you got anything I want baby,

</l>
<l>wanna crawl up on your floor

</l>
<l>Because I'm a crawlin' king snake baby, and I rules my den



</l>
<l>You know you caught me crawlin' baby when the, when the grass was
very high

</l>
<l>I'm just gonna keep on crawlin' now baby until the day I die,

</l>
<l>because I'm a crawlin' kingsnake baby, and I rules my den

</l>
<l>I don't want you hangin' around my mate, wanna use her for myself</l></lyrics></xml>
