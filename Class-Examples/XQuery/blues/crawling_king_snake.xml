<lyrics>



You know I'm a crawlin' kingsnake baby, and I rules my den

You know I'm a crawlin' kingsnake baby, and I rules my den

I don't want you hangin' around my mate, wanna use her for myself



You know you caught me crawlin' baby when the, when the grass was
very high

I'm just gonna keep on crawlin' now baby until the day I die,

because I'm a crawlin' kingsnake baby, and I rules my den

Don't you hangin' around my mate, wanna use her for myself



You know I'm gon' crawl up to your window baby,

wanna crawl up to your door, you got anything I want baby,

wanna crawl up on your floor

Because I'm a crawlin' king snake baby, and I rules my den



You know you caught me crawlin' baby when the, when the grass was
very high

I'm just gonna keep on crawlin' now baby until the day I die,

because I'm a crawlin' kingsnake baby, and I rules my den

I don't want you hangin' around my mate, wanna use her for myself
