<lyrics>



The thrill is gone, the thrill is gone away

The thrill is gone baby, the thrill is gone away

You know you don't me wrong baby, but you will be sorry someday



The thrill is gone, it's gone away from me

The thrill is gone away from me

Although, I'll still live on, but so lonely I'll be



The thrill is gone, it's gone away for good

The thrill is gone baby, it's gone away for good

Someday I know I'll be over it all baby, just like I know a good man
should



You know I'm free, free now baby, I'm free from your spell

Oh I'm free, free, free now, I'm free from your spell

And now that It's all over, all I can do is wish you well
