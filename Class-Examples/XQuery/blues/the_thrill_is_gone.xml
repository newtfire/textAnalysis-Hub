<lyrics>


<l>The thrill is gone, the thrill is gone away

</l>
<l>The thrill is gone baby, the thrill is gone away

</l>
<l>You know you don't me wrong baby, but you will be sorry someday



</l>
<l>The thrill is gone, it's gone away from me

</l>
<l>The thrill is gone away from me

</l>
<l>Although, I'll still live on, but so lonely I'll be



</l>
<l>The thrill is gone, it's gone away for good

</l>
<l>The thrill is gone baby, it's gone away for good

</l>
<l>Someday I know I'll be over it all baby, just like I know a good man

should




</l>
<l>You know I'm free, free now baby, I'm free from your spell

</l>
<l>Oh I'm free, free, free now, I'm free from your spell

</l>
<l>And now that It's all over, all I can do is wish you well</l></lyrics></xml>
