<lyrics>


<l>Mmm, when you got a good friend, that will stay right by your
side

</l>
<l>When you got a good friend, that will stay right by your side

</l>
<l>Give her all of your spare time, try to love and treat her right



</l>
<l>I mistreated my baby, I can't see no reason why

</l>
<l>I mistreated my baby, I can't see no reason why

</l>
<l>Everytime I thinks about it, I just wring my hands and cry



</l>
<l>Wonder could I bear apologize, or would she sympathize with me

</l>
<l>Mmmmmmmmmm, or would she sympathize with me

</l>
<l>She's a brown skin woman, just as sweet as a girl friend can be



</l>
<l>I love my baby, but I can't make that ag'ee

</l>
<l>I love that woman, but what can we can't agree

</l>
<l>I really love that woman, nnn, wonder why we can't agree



</l>
<l>It's your opinion, friend-girl, I may be right or wrong

</l>
<l>It's yo'y opinion friend-girl, I may be right or wrong

</l>
<l>But when you watch your close friend, baby,

</l>
<l>then your enemies can't do you no harm



</l>
<l>When you got a good friend, that will stay right by your side

</l>
<l>When you got a good friend, that will stay right by your side

</l>
<l>Give her all of your spare time, try to love and treat her right</l></lyrics></xml>
