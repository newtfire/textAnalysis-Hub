<lyrics>



Mmm, when you got a good friend, that will stay right by your
side

When you got a good friend, that will stay right by your side

Give her all of your spare time, try to love and treat her right



I mistreated my baby, I can't see no reason why

I mistreated my baby, I can't see no reason why

Everytime I thinks about it, I just wring my hands and cry



Wonder could I bear apologize, or would she sympathize with me

Mmmmmmmmmm, or would she sympathize with me

She's a brown skin woman, just as sweet as a girl friend can be



I love my baby, but I can't make that ag'ee

I love that woman, but what can we can't agree

I really love that woman, nnn, wonder why we can't agree



It's your opinion, friend-girl, I may be right or wrong

It's yo'y opinion friend-girl, I may be right or wrong

But when you watch your close friend, baby,

then your enemies can't do you no harm



When you got a good friend, that will stay right by your side

When you got a good friend, that will stay right by your side

Give her all of your spare time, try to love and treat her right
