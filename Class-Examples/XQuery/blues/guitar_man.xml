<l>(Let's get it on, let's get it on, guitar man, guitar man)

</l>
<l>(Let's get it on, let's get it on, guitar man, guitar man)



</l>
<l>I can do it slow, I can do it fast

</l>
<l>I can play the blues, I can play some jazz



</l>
<l>(Let's get it on, let's get it on, guitar man, guitar man)



</l>
<l>I play for the rich, I play for the po'

</l>
<l>When they hear my music, they yell for more



</l>
<l>If you're by yourself, or have a friend alone

</l>
<l>You can dig my funk, all night long



</l>
<l>When I do my thing, it'll make ya move

</l>
<l>You'll party hardy, an' get in the groove



</l>
<l>(Let's get it on, let's get it on, guitar man, guitar man)

</l>
<l>(Play the blu-ues)



</l>
<l>If you're by yourself, have a friend alone

</l>
<l>You'll dig my funk, all night long



</l>
<l>When I do my thing, it'll make ya move

</l>
<l>You can party hardy, an'get in the groove
