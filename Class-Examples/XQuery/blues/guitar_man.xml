<lyrics>



(Let's get it on, let's get it on, guitar man, guitar man)

(Let's get it on, let's get it on, guitar man, guitar man)



I can do it slow, I can do it fast

I can play the blues, I can play some jazz



(Let's get it on, let's get it on, guitar man, guitar man)



I play for the rich, I play for the po'

When they hear my music, they yell for more



If you're by yourself, or have a friend alone

You can dig my funk, all night long



When I do my thing, it'll make ya move

You'll party hardy, an' get in the groove



(Let's get it on, let's get it on, guitar man, guitar man)

(Play the blu-ues)



If you're by yourself, have a friend alone

You'll dig my funk, all night long



When I do my thing, it'll make ya move

You can party hardy, an'get in the groove



(Let's get it on, let's get it on, guitar man, guitar man)

(Let's get it on, let's get it on, guitar man, guitar man)

(Let's get it on, let's get it on, guitar man, guitar man)

(Let's get it on, let's get it on, guitar man)



(Guitar ma-an)

(Guitar ma-an)

(Guitar ma-an)

(Guitar ma-an)



(Let's get it on, let's get it on, guitar man)

(Guitar ma-an)

(Guitar ma-an)

(Guitar ma-an)

(Guitar ma-an)



(Let's get it on, let's get it on, guitar man)

(Guitar ma-an)



(Guitar ma-an)

Ah!

(Guitar ma-an, yeah)

Woo!

(Guitar ma-an)



(Let's get it on, let's get it on, guitar man)

(Guitar ma-an)

(Guitar ma-an)

(Guitar ma-an)

(Guitar ma-an)

Fading:

(Let's get it on, let's get it on, guitar man)
