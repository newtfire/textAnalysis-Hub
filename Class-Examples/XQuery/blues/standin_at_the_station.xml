<lyrics>



Standin' at the station

Teardrops in my eyes

Standin' at the station

Wonderin' why

You love him more than you love me

You wanna marry him

Make a family

That's why I'm standin' at the station

Teardrops in my eyes



Well I'm standin' at the station

Sad as a man can be

And you're gazing through the window

Waving good-bye to me

Well I know you got to do what you got to do

But you're leaving me

And I'm loving you

That's why I'm standin' at the station

Teardrops in my eyes

Yes I'm standin' at the station

Teardrops in my eyes

Come back home baby, I need ya

Stop that train, back it on up
