<l>Standin' at the station

</l>
<l>Teardrops in my eyes

</l>
<l>Standin' at the station

</l>
<l>Wonderin' why

</l>
<l>You love him more than you love me

</l>
<l>You wanna marry him

</l>
<l>Make a family

</l>
<l>That's why I'm standin' at the station

</l>
<l>Teardrops in my eyes



</l>
<l>Well I'm standin' at the station

</l>
<l>Sad as a man can be

</l>
<l>And you're gazing through the window

</l>
<l>Waving good-bye to me

</l>
<l>Well I know you got to do what you got to do

</l>
<l>But you're leaving me

</l>
<l>And I'm loving you

</l>
<l>That's why I'm standin' at the station

</l>
<l>Teardrops in my eyes

</l>
<l>Yes I'm standin' at the station

</l>
<l>Teardrops in my eyes

</l>
<l>Come back home baby, I need ya

</l>
<l>Stop that train, back it on up</l></lyrics></xml>
