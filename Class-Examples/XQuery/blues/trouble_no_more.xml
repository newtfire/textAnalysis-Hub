<lyrics>


<l>Can't tell how long you're gone, can't tell how long you stay

</l>
<l>It's good country fun, it's your home some day

</l>
<l>Someday baby, ain't no trouble for me, anymore



</l>
<l>Ah keep on dancin' baby, let me dance one dance

</l>
<l>Well I know when I go, I'm livin' too fast. Someday

</l>
<l>I'll tell him about it, in my neighborhood

</l>
<l>Gonna tell that little woman, that she don't do me no good.

Someday




</l>
<l>I know you're leaving, and your comin' back home

</l>
<l>Oh, without my lovin lady, I can't stay long. Someday



</l>
<l>Good Bye baby, ah take my hand

</l>
<l>Don't want no woman no, which ain't have no man

</l>
<l>Someday baby, you ain't gonna trouble poor me, anymore</l></lyrics></xml>
