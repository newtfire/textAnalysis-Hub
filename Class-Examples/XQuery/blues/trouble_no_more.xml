<lyrics>



Can't tell how long you're gone, can't tell how long you stay

It's good country fun, it's your home some day

Someday baby, ain't no trouble for me, anymore



Ah keep on dancin' baby, let me dance one dance

Well I know when I go, I'm livin' too fast. Someday

I'll tell him about it, in my neighborhood

Gonna tell that little woman, that she don't do me no good.
Someday



I know you're leaving, and your comin' back home

Oh, without my lovin lady, I can't stay long. Someday



Good Bye baby, ah take my hand

Don't want no woman no, which ain't have no man

Someday baby, you ain't gonna trouble poor me, anymore
