<lyrics>



Hmm, hmm

Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, that;s alright, babe

That's alright, that's alright, babe

I know you done me wrong, baby,

but that's alright



As the years go passing by,

I keep on loving you, baby

Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord,

I keep on lovin' you, baby



Hmm, hmm

you done me wrong, baby,

but I forgive you, baby

You, you, you done me wrong baby,

done me wrong, baby,

but I, I, I forgive you, forgive you



Now come home, come home, come home,

come on back home to me, baby

That's alright, baby, that's alright, that's alright

Look now people, when you love a woman,

you know she's doing you wrong

But love is blind, love is blind, love is blind

Used, used, used,

you know you been, you know you been used

But that's alright, that's alright, baby



Hmm



Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord

That's alright, baby, that's alright

You did me wrong babe, did me wrong,

but I'll keep on lovin' you

Keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on

As the years, years go passin' by, passin' by

Babe, babe, babe, baby

As the years, go, passin' by,

I love you, I love you more and more



Hmm



But that's alright, that's alright, that's alright, that's
alright



Thank you
