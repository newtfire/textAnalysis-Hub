<lyrics>


<l>I had a little red rooster, too lazy to crow for day

</l>
<l>I had a little red rooster, too lazy to crow for day

</l>
<l>Keep everything in the barnyard, upset in every way



</l>
<l>Oh, them dogs begin to bark, hounds begin to howl

</l>
<l>Oh, them dogs begin to bark, hounds begin to howl

</l>
<l>Oh, watch out strange kin people, little red rooster's on the

prowl




</l>
<l>If you see my little red rooster, please drag him on home

</l>
<l>If you see my little red rooster, please drag him on home

</l><l>There ain't no peace in the barnyard since my little red rooster's</l>
<l>been gone</l></lyrics></xml>
