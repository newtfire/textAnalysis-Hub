<lyrics>



I had a little red rooster, too lazy to crow for day

I had a little red rooster, too lazy to crow for day

Keep everything in the barnyard, upset in every way



Oh, them dogs begin to bark, hounds begin to howl

Oh, them dogs begin to bark, hounds begin to howl

Oh, watch out strange kin people, little red rooster's on the
prowl



If you see my little red rooster, please drag him on home

If you see my little red rooster, please drag him on home

There ain't no peace in the barnyard since my little red rooster's
been gone
