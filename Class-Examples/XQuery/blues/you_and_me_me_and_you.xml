<lyrics>



You took me way back in the country

You fed me on love and greens

You laid my head upon a feather bed

And I sure had some mighty sweet dreams



Don't you know we got something going on

You and me, me and you

Love can be a song if you like the tune

So sing to me, I'll sing to you

It goes ooh -

Just let the feelings flow

It goes ooh -

That's the way our love song goes



Mornings come easy in the country

Never had this feeling before

Ever since you found me

Love has been around me

And I'll never be lonely no more



Don't you know we got something going on

You and me, me and you

Love can be a song if you like the tune

So sing to me, I'll sing to you

It goes ooh -

Just let the feelings flow

It goes ooh -

That's the way our love song goes
