<lyrics>


<l>You took me way back in the country

</l>
<l>You fed me on love and greens

</l>
<l>You laid my head upon a feather bed

</l>
<l>And I sure had some mighty sweet dreams



</l>
<l>Don't you know we got something going on

</l>
<l>You and me, me and you

</l>
<l>Love can be a song if you like the tune

</l>
<l>So sing to me, I'll sing to you

</l>
<l>It goes ooh -

</l>
<l>Just let the feelings flow

</l>
<l>It goes ooh -

</l>
<l>That's the way our love song goes



</l>
<l>Mornings come easy in the country

</l>
<l>Never had this feeling before

</l>
<l>Ever since you found me

</l>
<l>Love has been around me

</l>
<l>And I'll never be lonely no more



</l>
<l>Don't you know we got something going on

</l>
<l>You and me, me and you

</l>
<l>Love can be a song if you like the tune

</l>
<l>So sing to me, I'll sing to you

</l>
<l>It goes ooh -

</l>
<l>Just let the feelings flow

</l>
<l>It goes ooh -

</l><l>That's the way our love song goes</l></lyrics></xml>
