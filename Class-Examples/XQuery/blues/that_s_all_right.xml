<lyrics>


<l>You told me baby, once upon a time

</l>
<l>If I'd be yours, little girl you'd be mine

</l>
<l>But that's all right, I know you lovin' some other man

</l>
<l>But that's all right

</l>
<l>Well now, then I wonder, who's lovin' you tonight?



</l>
<l>You told me baby, your love for me was strong

</l>
<l>But I woke up this mo'nin', your big worries was gone

</l>
<l>But that's all right

</l>
<l>I know you're lovin' some other man, but that's all right

</l>
<l>Well now, then I wonder, who's lovin' you tonight?



</l>
<l>When I was lovin' you, just couldn't understand

</l>
<l>Now you've gone and left me, for some other man

</l>
<l>That' all right, I know you lovin' some other man

</l>
<l>But that's all right

</l>
<l>Well now, then I wonder, who's loving you tonight?</l></lyrics></xml>
