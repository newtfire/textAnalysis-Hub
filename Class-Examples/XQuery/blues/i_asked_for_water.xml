<l>Oh, I asked her for water, she brought me gasoline

</l>
<l>Oh, I asked her for water, she brought me gasoline

</l>
<l>That's the troublingest woo-hoo (

woman?
), that I ever seen




</l>
<l>The church bell tollin', the hearse come driving slow

</l>
<l>The church bell tollin', the hearse come driving slow

</l>
<l>I hope my baby, don't leave me no more



</l>
<l>Oh tell me baby, when are you coming back home?

</l>
<l>Oh tell me baby, when are you coming back home?

</l>
<l>You know I love you baby, but you've been gone too long</l></lyrics></xml>
