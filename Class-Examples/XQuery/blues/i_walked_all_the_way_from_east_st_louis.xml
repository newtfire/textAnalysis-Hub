<l>I walked all the way from East St. Louis to town

</l>
<l>Lord, I walked all the way, darling, from East St. Louis to town

</l>
<l>You know I did not have but that one poor lousy dime



</l>
<l>Well, dark cloud a risin', baby, I wonder what's gonna' come of
me

</l>
<l>Lord, a dark cloud a risin', baby, I wonder what's gonna' come of
me

</l>
<l>Lord, I wonder what's gonna come of me



</l>
<l>Well, the next time I start a... boy, I gonna' have my baby by my
side

</l>
<l>Well, the next time I start a... boy, I gonna' have my baby lay by my
side

</l><l>Lord, if I make it to St. Louis, baby, we gon' stop on the other</l>
<l>side</l></lyrics></xml>
