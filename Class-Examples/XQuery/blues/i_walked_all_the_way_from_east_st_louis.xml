<lyrics>



I walked all the way from East St. Louis to town

Lord, I walked all the way, darling, from East St. Louis to town

You know I did not have but that one poor lousy dime



Well, dark cloud a risin', baby, I wonder what's gonna' come of
me

Lord, a dark cloud a risin', baby, I wonder what's gonna' come of
me

Lord, I wonder what's gonna come of me



Well, the next time I start a... boy, I gonna' have my baby by my
side

Well, the next time I start a... boy, I gonna' have my baby lay by my
side

Lord, if I make it to St. Louis, baby, we gon' stop on the other
side
