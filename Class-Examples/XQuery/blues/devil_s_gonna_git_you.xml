<lyrics>



It's a long, long lane that has no turning

And it's a fire that always keeps on burning

Mister devil down below

Pitchfork in his hand

And that's where you are going to go

Do you understand?

Devil's gonna git you

Devil's gonna git you

Oh, the devil's gonna git you

Man, just as sure as you's born



Devil's gonna git you,

Devil's gonna git you,

Oh, the devil's gonna git you,

The way you're carryin' on



You go away, stay for weeks

On your 
doggone

spree
1

Come back home, get in my bed

And turn your back on me

Oh the devil's gonna git you

I mean the devil's gonna git you

Man the devil's gonna git you

Sure as you's born



Dirty two-timer
2
, dirty two-timer,

Dirty two-timer, you ain't coming clean



Oh the devil's gonna git you

I mean the devil's gonna git you

Oh the devil's gonna git you

You know what I mean



I don't want no two-time stuff

From my regular man

Don't want nothing that's been used

'Cause it's second-hand

The devil's gonna git you

Oh the devil's gonna git you

Man the devil's gonna git you

Sure as you're born to die
