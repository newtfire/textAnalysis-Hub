<lyrics>

<l>It's a long, long lane that has no turning

</l>
<l>And it's a fire that always keeps on burning

</l>
<l>Mister devil down below

</l>
<l>Pitchfork in his hand

</l>
<l>And that's where you are going to go

</l>
<l>Do you understand?

</l>
<l>Devil's gonna git you

</l>
<l>Devil's gonna git you

</l>
<l>Oh, the devil's gonna git you

</l>
<l>Man, just as sure as you's born



</l>
<l>Devil's gonna git you,

</l>
<l>Devil's gonna git you,

</l>
<l>Oh, the devil's gonna git you,

</l>
<l>The way you're carryin' on



</l>
<l>You go away, stay for weeks

</l>
<l>On your 
doggone

</l>
<l>spree
1

</l>
<l>Come back home, get in my bed

</l>
<l>And turn your back on me

</l>
<l>Oh the devil's gonna git you

</l>
<l>I mean the devil's gonna git you

</l>
<l>Man the devil's gonna git you

</l>
<l>Sure as you's born



</l>
<l>Dirty two-timer
2
, dirty two-timer,

</l>
<l>Dirty two-timer, you ain't coming clean



</l>
<l>Oh the devil's gonna git you

</l>
<l>I mean the devil's gonna git you

</l>
<l>Oh the devil's gonna git you

</l>
<l>You know what I mean



</l>
<l>I don't want no two-time stuff

</l>
<l>From my regular man

</l>
<l>Don't want nothing that's been used

</l>
<l>'Cause it's second-hand

</l>
<l>The devil's gonna git you

</l>
<l>Oh the devil's gonna git you

</l>
<l>Man the devil's gonna git you

</l>
<l>Sure as you're born to die
