<lyrics>

<l>Baby, please don't go

</l>
<l>Baby, please don't go

</l>
<l>Baby, please don't go, down to New Orleans

</l>
<l>You know I love you so



</l>
<l>Before I be your dog

</l>
<l>Before I be your dog

</l>
<l>Before I be your dog

</l>
<l>I get you way'd out here, and let you walk alone



</l>
<l>Turn your lamp down low

</l>
<l>Turn your lamp down low

</l>
<l>Turn your lamp down low

</l>
<l>I beg you all night long, baby, please don't go



</l>
<l>You brought me way down here

</l>
<l>You brought me way down here

</l>
<l>You brought me way down here

</l>
<l>'bout to Rolling Forks, you treat me like a dog



</l>
<l>Baby, please don't go

</l>
<l>Baby, please don't go

</l>
<l>Baby, please don't go, back the New Orleans

</l>
<l>I beg you all night long



</l>
<l>Before I be your dog

</l>
<l>Before I be your dog

</l>
<l>Before I be your dog

</l>
<l>I get you way'd out here, and let you walk alone



</l>
<l>You know your man down gone

</l>
<l>You know your man down gone

</l>
<l>You know your man down gone

</l>
<l>To the country farm
1
, with all the shackles on

<note>Note 1: country farm, Charlie Hardin suggests that this should be
county farm. Charlie further says: "A county farm was (and maybe
still is in some county's) a place were people could go to work off
their fines for misdemeanor charges. Thanks Charlie for this
contribution</note></lyrics></xml>
