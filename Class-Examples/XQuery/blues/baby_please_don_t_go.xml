<lyrics>



Baby, please don't go

Baby, please don't go

Baby, please don't go, down to New Orleans

You know I love you so



Before I be your dog

Before I be your dog

Before I be your dog

I get you way'd out here, and let you walk alone



Turn your lamp down low

Turn your lamp down low

Turn your lamp down low

I beg you all night long, baby, please don't go



You brought me way down here

You brought me way down here

You brought me way down here

'bout to Rolling Forks, you treat me like a dog



Baby, please don't go

Baby, please don't go

Baby, please don't go, back the New Orleans

I beg you all night long



Before I be your dog

Before I be your dog

Before I be your dog

I get you way'd out here, and let you walk alone



You know your man down gone

You know your man down gone

You know your man down gone

To the country farm
1
, with all the shackles on



__________

Note 1: country farm, Charlie Hardin suggests that this should be
county farm. Charlie further says: "A county farm was (and maybe
still is in some county's) a place were people could go to work off
their fines for misdemeanor charges. Thanks Charlie for this
contribution.
