<lyrics>



I done made up my mind baby, there just got to be a change

Whoah, I made up my mind, baby, there's just got to be a change

Oh, I think you're cheatin' on me baby, oh, because you been actin'
too strange



When I leave home early in the mornin', you're smilin' baby and your
face is never sad

Oh, when I leave home early in the mornin', mama, your face is never
sad

Yes, but when I have the day off and stay at home, oh, I do believe
it makes you mad



Oh, I know you think you're smart baby and you think you're puttin'
something over on me

Oh, I know you think you're smart baby and you think you're puttin'
something over on me

Oh, but I done got wise to you baby and I ain't the fool that I used
to be
