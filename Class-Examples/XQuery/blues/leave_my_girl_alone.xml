<lyrics>



You better leave, you better leave my little girl alone

You better leave, you better leave my little girl alone

Lord before I get evil man, and I go and do something wrong



You call my house just yesterday

I picked up the extension and I heard every word you said

Why don't you just go on, man and leave my little girl alone

Lord before I get evil man, and I go and do something wrong



You call my house all hours of the night

Let me tell you mister that's a sure, sure way to start a fight

Why don't you just go on, man and leave my little girl alone

Lord before I get evil man, and I'm gonna do something wrong
