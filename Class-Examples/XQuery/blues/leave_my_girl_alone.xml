<l>You better leave, you better leave my little girl alone

</l>
<l>You better leave, you better leave my little girl alone

</l>
<l>Lord before I get evil man, and I go and do something wrong



</l>
<l>You call my house just yesterday

</l>
<l>I picked up the extension and I heard every word you said

</l>
<l>Why don't you just go on, man and leave my little girl alone

</l>
<l>Lord before I get evil man, and I go and do something wrong



</l>
<l>You call my house all hours of the night

</l>
<l>Let me tell you mister that's a sure, sure way to start a fight

</l>
<l>Why don't you just go on, man and leave my little girl alone

</l>
<l>Lord before I get evil man, and I'm gonna do something wrong</l></lyrics></xml>
