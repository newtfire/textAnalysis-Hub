<lyrics>


<l>(spoken: Man, you know I've enjoyin' things that kings and
queens will never have

</l>
<l>In fact, things kings and queens can't never get

</l>
<l>And they don't even know about it

</l>
<l>And good times? mmmmmmmmm-mmmh)



</l>
<l>I have had my fun, if I never get well no more

</l>
<l>I have had my fun, if I never get well no more

</l>
<l>Whoa, my health is fadin'

</l>
<l>Oh yes, I'm goin' down slow



</l>
<l>(spoken: Now looky here

</l>
<l>I did not say I was a millionaire

</l>
<l>But I said I have spent more money than a millionaire

</l>
<l>'Cause if I had kept all of the money I had already spent,

</l>
<l>I'd would have been a millionaire a long time ago

</l>
<l>And women? Well, Googly Moogly)



</l>
<l>Please write my mama

</l>
<l>Tell her the shape I'm in

</l>
<l>Please write my mama

</l>
<l>Tell her the shape I'm in

</l>
<l>Tell her pray for me

</l>
<l>Forgive me for my sins</l></lyrics></xml>
