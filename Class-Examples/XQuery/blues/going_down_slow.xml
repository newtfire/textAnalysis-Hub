<lyrics>



(spoken: Man, you know I've enjoyin' things that kings and
queens will never have

In fact, things kings and queens can't never get

And they don't even know about it

And good times? mmmmmmmmm-mmmh)



I have had my fun, if I never get well no more

I have had my fun, if I never get well no more

Whoa, my health is fadin'

Oh yes, I'm goin' down slow



(spoken: Now looky here

I did not say I was a millionaire

But I said I have spent more money than a millionaire

'Cause if I had kept all of the money I had already spent,

I'd would have been a millionaire a long time ago

And women? Well, Googly Moogly)



Please write my mama

Tell her the shape I'm in

Please write my mama

Tell her the shape I'm in

Tell her pray for me

Forgive me for my sins
