<lyrics>


<l>Well my mama she didn't 'low me, just to stay out all night
long, oh Lord

</l>
<l>Well my mama didn't 'low me, just to stay out all night long

</l>
<l>I didn't care what she didn't 'low, I would 
boogie-woogie

</l>
<l>anyhow



</l>
<l>When I first came to town people, I was walkin' down Hastings
Street

</l>
<l>Everybody was talkin' about, the Henry Swing Club

</l>
<l>I decided I drop in there that night

</l>
<l>When I got there, I say, "Yes, people"

</l>
<l>They was really havin' a ball!

</l>
<l>Yes, I know


</l>
<l>Boogie Chillun

!




</l>
<l>One night I was layin' down,

</l>
<l>I heard mama 'n papa talkin'

</l>
<l>I heard papa tell mama, let that boy boogie-woogie,

</l>
<l>it's in him, and it got to come out

</l>
<l>And I felt so good,

</l>
<l>went on boogie'n just the same
