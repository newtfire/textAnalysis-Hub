<lyrics>



Well my mama she didn't 'low me, just to stay out all night
long, oh Lord

Well my mama didn't 'low me, just to stay out all night long

I didn't care what she didn't 'low, I would 
boogie-woogie

anyhow



When I first came to town people, I was walkin' down Hastings
Street

Everybody was talkin' about, the Henry Swing Club

I decided I drop in there that night

When I got there, I say, "Yes, people"

They was really havin' a ball!

Yes, I know


Boogie Chillun
!



One night I was layin' down,

I heard mama 'n papa talkin'

I heard papa tell mama, let that boy boogie-woogie,

it's in him, and it got to come out

And I felt so good,

went on boogie'n just the same
