<lyrics>


<l>I know you rider, you're gonna miss me when I'm gone</l>

<l>I know you rider, you're gonna miss me when I'm gone</l>

<l>You're gonna miss your lovin' baby runnin', I said runnin' in your
arms</l>



<l>Don't the moon look lonesome, when it's shinin' down through the
trees</l>

<l>Don't the moon look lonesome, when it's shinin' down through the
trees</l>

<l>Don't my, don't my man looks fine, when he comes runnin', runnin'
after me</l>



<l>I know you rider, you're gonna miss me when I'm gone, honey when I'm
gone</l>

<l>Say now, I know you rider, you're gonna miss me when I'm gone</l>

<l>You're gonna miss your lovin' baby runnin', I said runnin' in your
arms!</l>



<l>I know you rider. you're gonna miss me when I'm gone</l>

<l>I know you rider, you're gonna miss me when I'm gone</l>

<l>Yeah, you're gonna miss your lovin' baby runnin', oh, I said runnin'
in your arms!</l>



<l>And I know my baby, says he's bound to love me so, love me so</l>

<l>Said I, I know my baby, and he's bound to love me so</l>

<l>You know he'll close his arms around me, like a circle, he thinks
I'll understand</l>



<l>I know you rider</l>

<l>Said you're gonna miss me when I'm gone</l>
