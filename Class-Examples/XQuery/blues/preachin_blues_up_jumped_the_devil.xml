<lyrics>


<l>Mmmmm mmmmm

</l>
<l>I's up this mornin', ah, blues walkin' like a man

</l>
<l>I's up this mornin', ah, blues walkin' like a man

</l>
<l>Worried blues, give me your right hand



</l>
<l>And the blues fell mama's child, tore me all upside down

</l>
<l>Blues fell mama's child, and it tore me all upside down

</l>
<l>Travel on, poor Bob, just can't turn you 'round



</l>
<l>The blues, is a low-down shakin' chill

</l>
<l>(spoken: Yes, preach 'em now)

</l>
<l>Mmmmm mmmmm

</l>
<l>Is a low-down shakin' chill

</l>
<l>You ain't never had 'em I, hope you never will



</l>
<l>Well, the blues , is a achin' old heart disease

</l>
<l>(spoken: Do it now, you gon' do it? Tell me all about it)

</l>
<l>The blues, is a low-down achin' heart disease

</l>
<l>Like consumption, killing me by degrees



</l>
<l>I can study rain, oh oh drive, oh oh drive my blues

</l>
<l>I been studyin' the rain and, I'm 'on drive my blues away

</l>
<l>Goin' to the 'stil'ry

1
, stay out there all day




</l>
