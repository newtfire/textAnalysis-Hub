<lyrics>


<l>I've got the key to the highway

</l>
<l>Feel I got to go

</l>
<l>Gonna leave here running

</l>
<l>Walking is both too slow



</l>
<l>I'm going back to the border

</l>
<l>Baby where I'm better known

</l>
<l>Because you haven't done nothing baby

</l>
<l>But draw the good man from home



</l>
<l>When the moon peeps over the mountain

</l>
<l>Little girl I'll be on my way

</l>
<l>I'm gonna roll the highway until the break of day



</l>
<l>Oh give me one more kiss darling

</l>
<l>Just before I go

</l>
<l>'Cause when I leave this time little girl

</l>
<l>I won't be back no more



</l>
<l>I've got the key to the highway

</l>
<l>Little darling I got to go

</l>
<l>I'm gonna leave here running

</l>
<l>Walking is both too slow</l></lyrics></xml>
