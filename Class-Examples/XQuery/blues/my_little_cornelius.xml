<lyrics>



Special deliver man, special deliver man, please take this
letter down to Brownville for me

Special deliver man, special deliver man, please take this letter
down to Brownville, for me

Now that you can tell Miss Cornelius, I'm up here in Chicago, oh, but
I'm just as blue as I can be



Special deliver man, she may not be at home, not that you need to
worry about knockin' on her door

Special deliver man, she may not be home, not that you need to worry
about knockin' on her door

Now if you could just take it back to the office, because Miss
Cornelia, goes to school, you know



Now give me 9-0-9, I want to use your line awhile

Now, give me 9-0-9, Lord, I want to use your line awhile

Now that I want to talk with Miss Cornelia, boy, because she just my
little angel child



Now special deliver man, after you've done what I told, Lord, then I
want you to ride away

Special deliver man, after you've done what I told you, Lord, then I
want you to ride away

Now, that's the reason you hear me sing the blues, about my little
Cornelia, boy n' it's everyday
