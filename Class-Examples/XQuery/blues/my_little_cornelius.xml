<l>Special deliver man, special deliver man, please take this
letter down to Brownville for me

</l>
<l>Special deliver man, special deliver man, please take this letter
down to Brownville, for me

</l>
<l>Now that you can tell Miss Cornelius, I'm up here in Chicago, oh, but

I'm just as blue as I can be




</l>
<l>Special deliver man, she may not be at home, not that you need to
worry about knockin' on her door

</l>
<l>Special deliver man, she may not be home, not that you need to worry
about knockin' on her door

</l>
<l>Now if you could just take it back to the office, because Miss

Cornelia, goes to school, you know




</l>
<l>Now give me 9-0-9, I want to use your line awhile

</l>
<l>Now, give me 9-0-9, Lord, I want to use your line awhile

</l>
<l>Now that I want to talk with Miss Cornelia, boy, because she just my

little angel child




</l>
<l>Now special deliver man, after you've done what I told, Lord, then I
want you to ride away

</l>
<l>Special deliver man, after you've done what I told you, Lord, then I
want you to ride away

</l><l>Now, that's the reason you hear me sing the blues, about my little</l>
<l>Cornelia, boy n' it's everyday</l></lyrics></xml>
