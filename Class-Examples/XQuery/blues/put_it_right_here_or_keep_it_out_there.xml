<lyrics>

<l>I had a man for fifteen years

</l>
<l>Give him his room and board

</l>
<l>Once he was like a Cadillac

</l>
<l>Now he's like an old worn out Ford

</l>
<l>He never brought me a lousy dime

</l>
<l>And put it in my hand

</l>
<l>So there'll be some changes from now on

</l>
<l>According to my plan



</l>
<l>He's got to get it, bring it, and put it right here

</l>
<l>Or else he's gonna keep it out there

</l>
<l>If he must steal it, beg it, or borrow it somewhere

</l>
<l>Long as he gets it, I don't care

</l>
<l>I'm tired of fryin' pork chops

</l>
<l>To grease his fat lips

</l>
<l>And he has to find another place

</l>
<l>For to park his old hips

</l>
<l>He must get it, and bring it, and put it right here

</l>
<l>Or else he's gonna keep it out there



</l>
<l>The bee gets the honey, and brings it to the corn

</l>
<l>Else he's kicked out of his home sweet home

</l>
<l>To show you that they brings it, watch the dog and the cat

</l>
<l>Everything even brings it, from a mule to a gnat
1

</l>
<l>The rooster gets the worm, and brings it to the hen

</l>
<l>That oughta be a tip to all you no-good men

</l>
<l>The groundhog even brings it and puts it in his hole

</l>
<l>So my man has got to bring it, 
doggone

</l>
<l>his soul



</l>
<l>He's got to get it, bring it, and put it right here

</l>
<l>Or else he's gonna keep it out there

</l>
<l>If he must steal it, beg it, or borr' it somewhere

</l>
<l>Long as he gets it child, I don't care

</l>
<l>I'm gonna tell him like the China man: when you don't bring 'em
check

</l>
<l>You don't get 'em laundry, if you break 'em down neck

</l>
<l>You got to get it, bring it, and put it right here

</l>
<l>Or else you gonna keep it out there
