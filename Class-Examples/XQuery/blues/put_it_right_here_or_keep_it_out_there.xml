<lyrics>



I had a man for fifteen years

Give him his room and board

Once he was like a Cadillac

Now he's like an old worn out Ford

He never brought me a lousy dime

And put it in my hand

So there'll be some changes from now on

According to my plan



He's got to get it, bring it, and put it right here

Or else he's gonna keep it out there

If he must steal it, beg it, or borrow it somewhere

Long as he gets it, I don't care

I'm tired of fryin' pork chops

To grease his fat lips

And he has to find another place

For to park his old hips

He must get it, and bring it, and put it right here

Or else he's gonna keep it out there



The bee gets the honey, and brings it to the corn

Else he's kicked out of his home sweet home

To show you that they brings it, watch the dog and the cat

Everything even brings it, from a mule to a gnat
1

The rooster gets the worm, and brings it to the hen

That oughta be a tip to all you no-good men

The groundhog even brings it and puts it in his hole

So my man has got to bring it, 
doggone

his soul



He's got to get it, bring it, and put it right here

Or else he's gonna keep it out there

If he must steal it, beg it, or borr' it somewhere

Long as he gets it child, I don't care

I'm gonna tell him like the China man: when you don't bring 'em
check

You don't get 'em laundry, if you break 'em down neck

You got to get it, bring it, and put it right here

Or else you gonna keep it out there



__________

Note 1: gnat, any of various small usually biting flies.
