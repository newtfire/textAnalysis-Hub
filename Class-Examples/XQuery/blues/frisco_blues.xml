<lyrics>



I left my heart in San Francisco

I left my heart, people, in San Francisco

High on the hill, at the Golden Gate, 'cross the bay,

in San Francisco, on the hill, the mornin' fog,

and the cool, cool night

That's where, I wanna be, San Francisco

That's where my heart

Up in New York City,

I've been to Chicago,

but found no place, like San Francisco,

with the cable car, high, high, on the hill

In the mornin' fog,

the evening breeze,

the cool, cool night,

is where I wanna be

Oh yeah

Oh yeah

Work, work people, tell me about it,

work out, work out

I got the blues for San Francisco

Yes, yes, yes, yes



My heart is there, high, on the hill,

right down by, the Golden Gate, 'cross the bay,

that's where I wanna be

I left my heart right there, in San Francisco

with the mornin' fog and the cool, cool night, the cable cars, on the
hill

That's where I wanna be people,

my heart is there, my heart is there, in San Francisco
