<lyrics>



Well now sittin' here so lonely, feelin' oh so blue

My baby's tryin' to mistreat me and I don't know what to do

So I'm cryin', why do I have to feel this way

If I can't love my baby, I can't live another day



Yeah I've loved her for such a long time, to end it all this way

Sittin' here so lonely, tears keep fallin' just like rain

So I'm cryin', why do I have to feel this way

If I can't love my baby, I can't live another day



Yeah, you know I love you baby, I'll do anything for you

But when we start to fightin', I just get these same old blues

So I'm cryin', why do I have to feel this way

If I can't love my baby, I can't live another day



Yeah, now when I first met you baby, at a dance and we did fine

Now we're together and it's a total waste of time

So I'm cryin', why do I have to feel this way

If I can't love my baby, I can't live another day



Well I guess it's just my own fault, the truth I cannot hide

But if I ever get her back again, I'll stay right by her side

I won't be cryin', I'll stay happy that a way

I'll be lovin' my little baby, every night and every day
