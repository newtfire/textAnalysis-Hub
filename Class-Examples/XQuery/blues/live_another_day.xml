<lyrics>


<l>Well now sittin' here so lonely, feelin' oh so blue

</l>
<l>My baby's tryin' to mistreat me and I don't know what to do

</l>
<l>So I'm cryin', why do I have to feel this way

</l>
<l>If I can't love my baby, I can't live another day



</l>
<l>Yeah I've loved her for such a long time, to end it all this way

</l>
<l>Sittin' here so lonely, tears keep fallin' just like rain

</l>
<l>So I'm cryin', why do I have to feel this way

</l>
<l>If I can't love my baby, I can't live another day



</l>
<l>Yeah, you know I love you baby, I'll do anything for you

</l>
<l>But when we start to fightin', I just get these same old blues

</l>
<l>So I'm cryin', why do I have to feel this way

</l>
<l>If I can't love my baby, I can't live another day



</l>
<l>Yeah, now when I first met you baby, at a dance and we did fine

</l>
<l>Now we're together and it's a total waste of time

</l>
<l>So I'm cryin', why do I have to feel this way

</l>
<l>If I can't love my baby, I can't live another day



</l>
<l>Well I guess it's just my own fault, the truth I cannot hide

</l>
<l>But if I ever get her back again, I'll stay right by her side

</l>
<l>I won't be cryin', I'll stay happy that a way

</l>
<l>I'll be lovin' my little baby, every night and every day</l></lyrics></xml>
