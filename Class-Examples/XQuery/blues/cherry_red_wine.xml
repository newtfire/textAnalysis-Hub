<lyrics>


<l>Watching you baby, watching you all the time
Watching you, watching you all the time
Watching you destroy yourself, all you do is sit around drinking wine

</l>
<l>You worry me baby

I'm sitting here wondering, wondering what in the world can I do
You're worrying me, you're worrying me baby
Sitting here wondering, what in the world can I do
We've got so much to live for baby
But I can't do nothing but sit here, and watch that wine destroy you


</l>
<l>That's wrong baby

</l><l>I'm taking you to the doctor darling</l>
<l>Maybe the doctor knows, what's going on in your head</l>
<l>Maybe the doctor can help me baby</l>
<l>Maybe he knows, what's going on in your head</l>
<l>You see you're gonna keep on drinking that bad wine baby</l>
<l>Even the glass that grows on your grave will be cherry red</l></lyrics></xml>
