<lyrics>





Watching you baby, watching you all the time
Watching you, watching you all the time
Watching you destroy yourself, all you do is sit around drinking wine

You worry me baby
I'm sitting here wondering, wondering what in the world can I do
You're worrying me, you're worrying me baby
Sitting here wondering, what in the world can I do
We've got so much to live for baby
But I can't do nothing but sit here, and watch that wine destroy you

That's wrong baby

I'm taking you to the doctor darling
Maybe the doctor knows, what's going on in your head
Maybe the doctor can help me baby
Maybe he knows, what's going on in your head
You see you're gonna keep on drinking that bad wine baby
Even the glass that grows on your grave will be cherry red
