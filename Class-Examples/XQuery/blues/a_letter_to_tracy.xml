<lyrics>



I don't have a reason

To turn you around

I don't have all the reasons

To turn you around

I ain't going nowhere baby

No how, no way



You're not always an angel baby

And I ain't no saint

You're not always an angel baby

And I ain't no saint

Well I know I'm gonna leave you baby

Well baby that something I ain't



I don't have a reason

To turn you around

I don't have a reason

To turn you around

I ain't going nowhere

No way, no how



My love is like a rock

Not a fair-weathered friend

My love is like a rock

I ain't no fair-weathered friend

I#180;ll follow you up the mountain

Down the road and back again



I don't have no trophy

To prove I'm a man

I don't need no trophy

To prove I'm a man

I just want somebody to talk to

So I can be free



I don't have a reason

Sorry about that false alarm

Turned you around

I ain't got all the reasons

To make you stay

I ain't going nowhere

No how, no way
