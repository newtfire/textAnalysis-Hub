<lyrics>


<l>I don't have a reason

</l>
<l>To turn you around

</l>
<l>I don't have all the reasons

</l>
<l>To turn you around

</l>
<l>I ain't going nowhere baby

</l>
<l>No how, no way



</l>
<l>You're not always an angel baby

</l>
<l>And I ain't no saint

</l>
<l>You're not always an angel baby

</l>
<l>And I ain't no saint

</l>
<l>Well I know I'm gonna leave you baby

</l>
<l>Well baby that something I ain't



</l>
<l>I don't have a reason

</l>
<l>To turn you around

</l>
<l>I don't have a reason

</l>
<l>To turn you around

</l>
<l>I ain't going nowhere

</l>
<l>No way, no how



</l>
<l>My love is like a rock

</l>
<l>Not a fair-weathered friend

</l>
<l>My love is like a rock

</l>
<l>I ain't no fair-weathered friend

</l>
<l>I#180;ll follow you up the mountain

</l>
<l>Down the road and back again



</l>
<l>I don't have no trophy

</l>
<l>To prove I'm a man

</l>
<l>I don't need no trophy

</l>
<l>To prove I'm a man

</l>
<l>I just want somebody to talk to

</l>
<l>So I can be free



</l>
<l>I don't have a reason

</l>
<l>Sorry about that false alarm

</l>
<l>Turned you around

</l>
<l>I ain't got all the reasons

</l>
<l>To make you stay

</l>
<l>I ain't going nowhere

</l><l>No how, no way</l></lyrics></xml>
