<lyrics>


<l>Well, the rocks is my pillow

</l>
<l>The cold ground is my bed

</l>
<l>The highway is my home so I might as well be dead



</l>
<l>I'm walkin' and walkin', seems I have no place to go

</l>
<l>Yes, mama's dead and gone

</l>
<l>And papa throw me from his door



</l>
<l>I have one pair of shoes

</l>
<l>Don't even have a change of clothes

</l>
<l>And this road I've got to travel, yes, it's so chilly and cold



</l>
<l>Yes, I'm going to have religion and learn how to pray

</l>
<l>I need help, now people, seem that's the only way



</l>
<l>I'm travelin' and travelin'

</l>
<l>Seem like this road has got no end

</l>
<l>I ain't got nobody, people

</l>
<l>In this whole world to call my friend



</l>
<l>I've got so much trouble, people, sometimes I could cry

</l>
<l>I've got so much trouble, so much trouble

</l>
<l>Sometimes I could cry

</l>
<l>Yes, sometimes I could just break down

</l>
<l>Seem like I could just break down and die</l></lyrics></xml>
