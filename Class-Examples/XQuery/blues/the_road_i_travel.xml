Well, the rocks is my pillow

The cold ground is my bed

The highway is my home so I might as well be dead



I'm walkin' and walkin', seems I have no place to go

Yes, mama's dead and gone

And papa throw me from his door



I have one pair of shoes

Don't even have a change of clothes

And this road I've got to travel, yes, it's so chilly and cold



Yes, I'm going to have religion and learn how to pray

I need help, now people, seem that's the only way



I'm travelin' and travelin'

Seem like this road has got no end

I ain't got nobody, people

In this whole world to call my friend



I've got so much trouble, people, sometimes I could cry

I've got so much trouble, so much trouble

Sometimes I could cry

Yes, sometimes I could just break down

Seem like I could just break down and die
