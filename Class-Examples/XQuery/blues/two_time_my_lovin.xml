<lyrics>

<l>Baby baby you put the hurt on me

</l>
<l>'Cause I was blind and just couldn't see

</l>
<l>But all these rumours that are floating around

</l>
<l>Make this big city a very small town



</l>
<l>I found out you've got somebody else

</l>
<l>But I love you baby and I just can't help myself

</l>
<l>I can't let you got it's plain as day to see

</l>
<l>I'm gonna have to let you two time me



</l>
<l>You can two time my lovin'

</l>
<l>Second hands love is better than none

</l>
<l>You can two time my lovin'

</l>
<l>Just come home when you've had your fun



</l>
<l>Repeat chorus



</l>
<l>After all everybody has their fun

</l>
<l>Nobody feels like there beholding to anyone

</l>
<l>They don't feel there's no more lessons to be learned

</l>
<l>But when you rub two ...
1
 </l><l>together</l>
<l>
Somebody's got to burn



</l>
<l>But if you love somebody with all your might

</l>
<l>You might have to fuss you might have to fight

</l>
<l>Resign yourself there's nothing you can do

</l>
<l>You're gonna have to let 'em two time you



</l>
<l>chorus



</l>
<l>But if you love somebody with all your might

</l>
<l>You might have to fuss you might have to fight

</l>
<l>Resign yourself there's nothing you can do

</l>
<l>You're gonna have to let 'em two time you
