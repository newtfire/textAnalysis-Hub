<lyrics>



Baby baby you put the hurt on me

'Cause I was blind and just couldn't see

But all these rumours that are floating around

Make this big city a very small town



I found out you've got somebody else

But I love you baby and I just can't help myself

I can't let you got it's plain as day to see

I'm gonna have to let you two time me



You can two time my lovin'

Second hands love is better than none

You can two time my lovin'

Just come home when you've had your fun



Repeat chorus



After all everybody has their fun

Nobody feels like there beholding to anyone

They don't feel there's no more lessons to be learned

But when you rub two ...
1
 together

Somebody's got to burn



But if you love somebody with all your might

You might have to fuss you might have to fight

Resign yourself there's nothing you can do

You're gonna have to let 'em two time you



chorus



But if you love somebody with all your might

You might have to fuss you might have to fight

Resign yourself there's nothing you can do

You're gonna have to let 'em two time you
