<lyrics>



I've got a five card hand and I don't know how to play

I've got a five card hand and I don't know how to play

I need a queen like you to make my hand o.k.



The kid drew three aces and stacked them back to back

The kid drew three aces and stacked them back to back

I looked at my hand and not a smile did I crack



When the deal goes down, I've only drawed one card

When the deal goes down, I've only drawed one card

And if you play poker, you know that sure is hard



The kid spread his hand and began to blush

The kid spread his hand and then began to blush

But his face turned pale when he saw my queen high flush
