<lyrics>


<l>I've got a five card hand and I don't know how to play

</l>
<l>I've got a five card hand and I don't know how to play

</l>
<l>I need a queen like you to make my hand o.k.



</l>
<l>The kid drew three aces and stacked them back to back

</l>
<l>The kid drew three aces and stacked them back to back

</l>
<l>I looked at my hand and not a smile did I crack



</l>
<l>When the deal goes down, I've only drawed one card

</l>
<l>When the deal goes down, I've only drawed one card

</l>
<l>And if you play poker, you know that sure is hard



</l>
<l>The kid spread his hand and began to blush

</l>
<l>The kid spread his hand and then began to blush

</l>
<l>But his face turned pale when he saw my queen high flush</l></lyrics></xml>
