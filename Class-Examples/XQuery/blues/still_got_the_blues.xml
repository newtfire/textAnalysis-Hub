<lyrics>


<l>Used to be so easy to give my heart away

</l>
<l>But I found out the hard way, there's a price you have to pay

</l>
<l>I found out that love was no friend of mine

</l>
<l>I should have known time after time



</l>
<l>So long, it was so long ago, but I've still got the blues for you



</l>
<l>Used to be so easy to fall in love again

</l>
<l>But I found out the hard way, it's a road that leads to pain

</l>
<l>I found that love was more than just a game

</l>
<l>You're playin' to win, but you lose just the same



</l>
<l>So long, it was so long ago, but I've still got the blues for you



</l>
<l>So many years since I've seen your face

</l>
<l>Here in my heart, there's an empty space where you used to be



</l>
<l>So long, it was so long ago, but I've still got the blues for you



</l>
<l>Though the days come and go, there is one thing I know

</l>
<l>I've still got the blues for you</l></lyrics></xml>
