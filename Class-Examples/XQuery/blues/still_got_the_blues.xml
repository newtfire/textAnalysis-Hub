<lyrics>



Used to be so easy to give my heart away

But I found out the hard way, there's a price you have to pay

I found out that love was no friend of mine

I should have known time after time



So long, it was so long ago, but I've still got the blues for you



Used to be so easy to fall in love again

But I found out the hard way, it's a road that leads to pain

I found that love was more than just a game

You're playin' to win, but you lose just the same



So long, it was so long ago, but I've still got the blues for you



So many years since I've seen your face

Here in my heart, there's an empty space where you used to be



So long, it was so long ago, but I've still got the blues for you



Though the days come and go, there is one thing I know

I've still got the blues for you
