<lyrics>



Hey Mr. President

All your congressmen, too

You got me frustrated

And I don't know what to do

I'm trying to make a living

I can't save a cent

It takes all of my money

Just to eat and pay my rent

I got the blues

Got those inflation blues



You know, I'm not one

Of those high brows

I'm average Joe to you

I came up eating cornbread

Candied yams and chicken stew

Now you take that paper dollar

It's only that in name

The way that buck has shrunk

It's a lowdown dirty shame

That's why I got the blues

Got those inflation blues



Mr. President

Please cut the price of sugar

I wanna make my coffee sweet

I wanna smear some butter on my bread

And I just got to have my meat

When you start rationing

You really played the game

And things are going up

And up and up and up

And my check remains the same

That's why I got the blues

Got those inflation blues
