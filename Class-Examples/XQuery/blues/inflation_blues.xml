<lyrics>


<l>Hey Mr. President

</l>
<l>All your congressmen, too

</l>
<l>You got me frustrated

</l>
<l>And I don't know what to do

</l>
<l>I'm trying to make a living

</l>
<l>I can't save a cent

</l>
<l>It takes all of my money

</l>
<l>Just to eat and pay my rent

</l>
<l>I got the blues

</l>
<l>Got those inflation blues



</l>
<l>You know, I'm not one

</l>
<l>Of those high brows

</l>
<l>I'm average Joe to you

</l>
<l>I came up eating cornbread

</l>
<l>Candied yams and chicken stew

</l>
<l>Now you take that paper dollar

</l>
<l>It's only that in name

</l>
<l>The way that buck has shrunk

</l>
<l>It's a lowdown dirty shame

</l>
<l>That's why I got the blues

</l>
<l>Got those inflation blues



</l>
<l>Mr. President

</l>
<l>Please cut the price of sugar

</l>
<l>I wanna make my coffee sweet

</l>
<l>I wanna smear some butter on my bread

</l>
<l>And I just got to have my meat

</l>
<l>When you start rationing

</l>
<l>You really played the game

</l>
<l>And things are going up

</l>
<l>And up and up and up

</l>
<l>And my check remains the same

</l>
<l>That's why I got the blues

</l>
<l>Got those inflation blues</l></lyrics></xml>
