<lyrics>


<l>I wants to know what your doin' tonight,

</l>
<l>wish I could see if everything was alright

</l>
<l>Hold you long in my arms until it's light,

</l>
<l>your smilin' face would make a wonderful sight

</l>
<l>I wants to be with ya, love with ya, eat with ya,

</l>
<l>sleep with ya, stay with me all of my life



</l>
<l>I loved ya darlin' when you was only sixteen,

</l>
<l>was the sweetest thing to enter my dream

</l>
<l>When we're together then my life is fulfilled,

</l>
<l>I love you darlin' I know I always will

</l>
<l>I wants to be with ya, love with ya, eat with ya,

</l>
<l>sleep with ya, stay with me all of my life



</l>
<l>I close my letter but never my love

</l>
<l>Take it there to ya heaven above

</l>
<l>Get me back to you safe and sound

</l>
<l>The day that I leave the prisoners ground

</l>
<l>I wants to be with ya, love with ya,

</l>
<l>stay with ya, sleep with ya all of my life</l></lyrics></xml>
