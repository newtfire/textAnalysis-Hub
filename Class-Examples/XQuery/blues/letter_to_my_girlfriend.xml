<lyrics>



I wants to know what your doin' tonight,

wish I could see if everything was alright

Hold you long in my arms until it's light,

your smilin' face would make a wonderful sight

I wants to be with ya, love with ya, eat with ya,

sleep with ya, stay with me all of my life



I loved ya darlin' when you was only sixteen,

was the sweetest thing to enter my dream

When we're together then my life is fulfilled,

I love you darlin' I know I always will

I wants to be with ya, love with ya, eat with ya,

sleep with ya, stay with me all of my life



I close my letter but never my love

Take it there to ya heaven above

Get me back to you safe and sound

The day that I leave the prisoners ground

I wants to be with ya, love with ya,

stay with ya, sleep with ya all of my life
