<lyrics>



Yes you're on the top now, baby, but don't nothing stay the same

Hey you're on the top now, baby, but don't nothing stay the same

Every now and then, baby, lady luck deals another hand



You're calling me your pal now, when I used to be your man

Hey you're calling me your pal now, baby, when I used to be your
man

You're flying real high now, baby, go on and raise your sand



I realize now, baby, your kind of love ain't true

Hey I realize now, baby, your kind of love won't do

Well what should've been, baby, now has all fell through
