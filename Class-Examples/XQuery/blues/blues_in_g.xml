<lyrics>


<l>Yes you're on the top now, baby, but don't nothing stay the same

</l>
<l>Hey you're on the top now, baby, but don't nothing stay the same

</l>
<l>Every now and then, baby, lady luck deals another hand



</l>
<l>You're calling me your pal now, when I used to be your man

</l>
<l>Hey you're calling me your pal now, baby, when I used to be your
man

</l>
<l>You're flying real high now, baby, go on and raise your sand



</l>
<l>I realize now, baby, your kind of love ain't true

</l>
<l>Hey I realize now, baby, your kind of love won't do

</l>
<l>Well what should've been, baby, now has all fell through</l></lyrics></xml>
