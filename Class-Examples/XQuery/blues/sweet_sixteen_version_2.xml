<lyrics>


<l>When I first met you baby, oh, you were just sweet sixteen

</l>
<l>When I first met you baby, oh, you were just sweet sixteen

</l>
<l>You just left your home then baby, oh, the sweetest thing I'd ever

seen




</l>
<l>But you wouldn't do nothing baby, you wouldn't do anything I ask you
to

</l>
<l>Yes, you wouldn't do nothing baby, you wouldn't do anything I ask you
to

</l>
<l>You know you ran away from home baby, and now you want to run away

from "old B" too




</l>
<l>You know I love you, baby, Oh loved you before I could call your
name

</l>
<l>You know I love you, baby, Oh loved you before I could call your
name

</l>
<l>Well, it seems like everything I do, baby, everything I do is in

vain




</l>
<l>Well my brother's in Vietnam, sister's down in New Orleans

</l>
<l>Well my brother's in Vietnam, sister's down in New Orleans

</l>
<l>Well, you know I'm having so much trouble, sometimes I wonder what in

the world is going to happen to me




</l>
<l>You know I love you and I'll do anything you tell me to

</l>
<l>You know I love you and I'll do anything you tell me to

</l>
<l>Well, there ain't nothing in the world, woman, that I wouldn't do for

you




</l>
<l>You can treat me mean, baby, but I''ll keep loving you just the
same

</l>
<l>You can treat me mean, baby, but I''ll keep loving you just the
same

</l><l>But one of these days you're going to give a lot of money, just to</l>
<l>hear someone call my name</l></lyrics></xml>
