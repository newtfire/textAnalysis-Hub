<lyrics>



When I first met you baby, oh, you were just sweet sixteen

When I first met you baby, oh, you were just sweet sixteen

You just left your home then baby, oh, the sweetest thing I'd ever
seen



But you wouldn't do nothing baby, you wouldn't do anything I ask you
to

Yes, you wouldn't do nothing baby, you wouldn't do anything I ask you
to

You know you ran away from home baby, and now you want to run away
from "old B" too



You know I love you, baby, Oh loved you before I could call your
name

You know I love you, baby, Oh loved you before I could call your
name

Well, it seems like everything I do, baby, everything I do is in
vain



Well my brother's in Vietnam, sister's down in New Orleans

Well my brother's in Vietnam, sister's down in New Orleans

Well, you know I'm having so much trouble, sometimes I wonder what in
the world is going to happen to me



You know I love you and I'll do anything you tell me to

You know I love you and I'll do anything you tell me to

Well, there ain't nothing in the world, woman, that I wouldn't do for
you



You can treat me mean, baby, but I''ll keep loving you just the
same

You can treat me mean, baby, but I''ll keep loving you just the
same

But one of these days you're going to give a lot of money, just to
hear someone call my name
