<lyrics>


<l>I got a friend at the bar,

his name is Ray
And I really don't know,
what he's trying to say


</l>
<l>His skin is black,

mine is white
To me there's no difference,
wrong or right


</l>
<l>Told me he leave,

the girl at the curb
Told me never to speak an unkind word
My brother's got rhythm,
I got the blues but
Babe we love to live the life that we choose


</l>
<l>But now I know what they was trying to say
I gotta change my life,
change my ways

</l>
<l>Now I know what they were trying to say
I gotta change my life,
change my ways

</l>
<l>Now when the night comes babe,
you know I'll be found
I'll be playing the blues on every stage in town

</l><l>And there's a song to be played,</l>
<l>and there's a song to be sung</l>
<l>'Cause there's a little lovin' boy,</l>
<l>in everyone</l></lyrics></xml>
