<lyrics>





I got a friend at the bar,
his name is Ray
And I really don't know,
what he's trying to say

His skin is black,
mine is white
To me there's no difference,
wrong or right

Told me he leave,
the girl at the curb
Told me never to speak an unkind word
My brother's got rhythm,
I got the blues but
Babe we love to live the life that we choose

But now I know what they was trying to say
I gotta change my life,
change my ways

Now I know what they were trying to say
I gotta change my life,
change my ways

Now when the night comes babe,
you know I'll be found
I'll be playing the blues on every stage in town

And there's a song to be played,
and there's a song to be sung
'Cause there's a little lovin' boy,
in everyone
