<lyrics>



I'm picking up on a signal, that's in the air tonight

It's sparkin' my receiver, it feels like dynamite

I got the message but I wanna get it straight from you



My mind is electric, I'm about to blow a fuse

The cockpit is empty so shoot it down the tube

I got the message but I wanna get it straight from you



I've got to make a connection, I'm on needles and pins

Workin' up a printout and I'm gonna zero in

I got the message but I wanna get it straight from you
