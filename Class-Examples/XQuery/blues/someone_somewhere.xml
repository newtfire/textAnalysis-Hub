<l>I know there's someone somewhere who loves me

</l>
<l>I know there's someone somewhere who cares

</l>
<l>I know there's someone somewhere who loves me

</l>
<l>I know there's someone somewhere who cares



</l>
<l>I'm gonna keep on a-searchin' until the angel answer my prayer

</l>
<l>Good thing, good things, good things, good things, good things

</l>
<l>Come to those who wai-ait



</l>
<l>An' I've been waitin' a long, long time, good things come to those
who wait

</l>
<l>An' I wanna tell you I been waitin' long, long time,

</l>
<l>I'm gonna keep on a-waitin', until the day I can call you mine



</l>
<l>I'm not gonna get discouraged, I'm not gonna turn around

</l>
<l>I'm not gonna get discouraged, I'm tryin' to tell you, I'm not gonna
turn around

</l><l>I'm gonna keep on pressin' hard and forward, until true love, I've</l>
<l>found</l></lyrics></xml>
