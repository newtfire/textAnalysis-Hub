<lyrics>



I know there's someone somewhere who loves me

I know there's someone somewhere who cares

I know there's someone somewhere who loves me

I know there's someone somewhere who cares



I'm gonna keep on a-searchin' until the angel answer my prayer

Good thing, good things, good things, good things, good things

Come to those who wai-ait



An' I've been waitin' a long, long time, good things come to those
who wait

An' I wanna tell you I been waitin' long, long time,

I'm gonna keep on a-waitin', until the day I can call you mine



I'm not gonna get discouraged, I'm not gonna turn around

I'm not gonna get discouraged, I'm tryin' to tell you, I'm not gonna
turn around

I'm gonna keep on pressin' hard and forward, until true love, I've
found
