<lyrics>


<l>When my love, comes down baby

</l>
<l>I wanna give it to you

</l>
<l>There ain't a thing, oh, you can do darlin'

</l>
<l>I wanna give it to you

</l>
<l>I said, I'm gonna give it to you

</l>
<l>I said, I'm gonna give it to you



</l>
<l>Oh, now when I, turn around baby

</l>
<l>So slow and patiently

</l>
<l>Oh, my thoughts fly straight to you darlin', and cry out
helplessly

</l>
<l>They say, you need to be with me

</l>
<l>They say, you need to be with me

</l>
<l>Oh, they say, you need to be with me

</l>
<l>Oh,. you need to be with me



</l>
<l>Now you know I need you baby

</l>
<l>Oh, how I've got to make you see

</l>
<l>That there's no other for you

</l>
<l>You need to, you need to, you need to be with me



</l>
<l>Oh, I stepped from plane to plane

</l>
<l>So slow and cautiously

</l>
<l>With all the stars about my head now, below my feet the sea

</l>
<l>I say, you need to be with me

</l>
<l>I say, you need to be with me

</l>
<l>Oh, I say, you need to be with me

</l>
<l>Oh, you need to, you need to, you need to

</l>
<l>Oh, come on and be with me

</l>
<l>Oooh,You need to be with me

</l>
<l>I said, come on and be with me

</l>
<l>Oh, you need to be with me

</l>
<l>I said, you need to be with me</l></lyrics></xml>
