<lyrics>



When my love, comes down baby

I wanna give it to you

There ain't a thing, oh, you can do darlin'

I wanna give it to you

I said, I'm gonna give it to you

I said, I'm gonna give it to you



Oh, now when I, turn around baby

So slow and patiently

Oh, my thoughts fly straight to you darlin', and cry out
helplessly

They say, you need to be with me

They say, you need to be with me

Oh, they say, you need to be with me

Oh,. you need to be with me



Now you know I need you baby

Oh, how I've got to make you see

That there's no other for you

You need to, you need to, you need to be with me



Oh, I stepped from plane to plane

So slow and cautiously

With all the stars about my head now, below my feet the sea

I say, you need to be with me

I say, you need to be with me

Oh, I say, you need to be with me

Oh, you need to, you need to, you need to

Oh, come on and be with me

Oooh,You need to be with me

I said, come on and be with me

Oh, you need to be with me

I said, you need to be with me
