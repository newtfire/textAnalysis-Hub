<lyrics>



Out in Black Mountain a child will smack your face

I'm saying out on Black Mountain a child will smack your face

The babies cryin' for liquor, and all the birds sing bass



Well, those people in Black Mountain are mean as they can be

And those people in Black Mountain are mean as they can be

Now they uses gun powder just to sweeten up their tea



Well, out in Black Mountain you can't keep a good man in jail

Yeah, out in Black Mountain you can't keep a good man in jail

'Cause if the jury convicts him, the judge will pay his bail



I had a man in Black Mountain, the sweetest man in town

I had a man in Black Mountain, the sweetest man in the town

But then he met a city gal, that's when he throwed me down



Lord, I'm bound for Black Mountain, me and my razor and my gun

I'm going back to Black Mountain, me and my razor and my gun

I'm gonna fire him if he stands still, I'll just cut him if he
runs



Lord, now you've heard my story, now you've heard my news

Lord, now you've heard my story, now you've heard my news

Now my man can clear off, I've got the Blackest Mountain blues
