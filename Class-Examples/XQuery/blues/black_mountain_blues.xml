<lyrics>


<l>Out in Black Mountain a child will smack your face

</l>
<l>I'm saying out on Black Mountain a child will smack your face

</l>
<l>The babies cryin' for liquor, and all the birds sing bass



</l>
<l>Well, those people in Black Mountain are mean as they can be

</l>
<l>And those people in Black Mountain are mean as they can be

</l>
<l>Now they uses gun powder just to sweeten up their tea



</l>
<l>Well, out in Black Mountain you can't keep a good man in jail

</l>
<l>Yeah, out in Black Mountain you can't keep a good man in jail

</l>
<l>'Cause if the jury convicts him, the judge will pay his bail



</l>
<l>I had a man in Black Mountain, the sweetest man in town

</l>
<l>I had a man in Black Mountain, the sweetest man in the town

</l>
<l>But then he met a city gal, that's when he throwed me down



</l>
<l>Lord, I'm bound for Black Mountain, me and my razor and my gun

</l>
<l>I'm going back to Black Mountain, me and my razor and my gun

</l>
<l>I'm gonna fire him if he stands still, I'll just cut him if he

runs




</l>
<l>Lord, now you've heard my story, now you've heard my news

</l>
<l>Lord, now you've heard my story, now you've heard my news

</l><l>Now my man can clear off, I've got the Blackest Mountain blues</l></lyrics></xml>
