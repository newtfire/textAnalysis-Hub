<lyrics>



I'm gonna love you

Like nobody's loved you

Come rain or come shine

High as a mountain and deep as a river

Come rain or come shine



Well I guess when you met me

That it were just one of those things

Don't you ever bet me

'Cause I'm gonna be true if you let me



Oh you're gonna love me

Like nobody's loved me

Come rain or come shine

Happy together unhappy together

Won't that be fine



Day may be cloudy or sunny

We're either in or we're out of our money

I'm with you always

I'm with you rain or shine



You're gonna love me

Like nobody's loved me

Come rain or come shine

Happy together unhappy together

Won't that be fine



Day may be cloudy or sunny

We're in or we're out of our money

I'm with you always

I'm with you rain or shine

Rain or shine

I'm with you always

I'm with you rain or shine
