<lyrics>


<l>I'm gonna love you

</l>
<l>Like nobody's loved you

</l>
<l>Come rain or come shine

</l>
<l>High as a mountain and deep as a river

</l>
<l>Come rain or come shine



</l>
<l>Well I guess when you met me

</l>
<l>That it were just one of those things

</l>
<l>Don't you ever bet me

</l>
<l>'Cause I'm gonna be true if you let me



</l>
<l>Oh you're gonna love me

</l>
<l>Like nobody's loved me

</l>
<l>Come rain or come shine

</l>
<l>Happy together unhappy together

</l>
<l>Won't that be fine



</l>
<l>Day may be cloudy or sunny

</l>
<l>We're either in or we're out of our money

</l>
<l>I'm with you always

</l>
<l>I'm with you rain or shine



</l>
<l>You're gonna love me

</l>
<l>Like nobody's loved me

</l>
<l>Come rain or come shine

</l>
<l>Happy together unhappy together

</l>
<l>Won't that be fine



</l>
<l>Day may be cloudy or sunny

</l>
<l>We're in or we're out of our money

</l>
<l>I'm with you always

</l>
<l>I'm with you rain or shine

</l>
<l>Rain or shine

</l>
<l>I'm with you always

</l>
<l>I'm with you rain or shine</l></lyrics></xml>
