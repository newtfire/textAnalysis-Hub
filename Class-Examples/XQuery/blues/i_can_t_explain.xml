<lyrics>


<l>Oh, I can't explain baby

</l>
<l>But heaven only knows why

</l>
<l>Oh, I can't explain

</l>
<l>And heaven only knows why

</l>
<l>Yes, I'll be in love with you baby

</l>
<l>I guess until the day I die



</l>
<l>You are to me, baby

</l>
<l>What the water is to the sea

</l>
<l>Oh, you are to me, baby

</l>
<l>What the water is to the sea

</l>
<l>I only want your love, baby

</l>
<l>So tell me why don't you want me



</l>
<l>Yes, I don't believe in miracles

</l>
<l>I believe what's to be will be

</l>
<l>Yes, I don't believe, I don't believe in miracles

</l>
<l>I only believe what's to be will be

</l>
<l>Yes but if I did believe in miracles, baby

</l>
<l>Baby, you would be a miracle to me



</l>
<l>Yes, you're my first thought baby

</l>
<l>Yes my last and in between

</l>
<l>Oh, you're my first thought baby

</l>
<l>Yes my last and in between

</l>
<l>I say you're the greatest champion baby

</l><l>Oh that any man has ever seen</l></lyrics></xml>
