<lyrics>



Oh, I can't explain baby

But heaven only knows why

Oh, I can't explain

And heaven only knows why

Yes, I'll be in love with you baby

I guess until the day I die



You are to me, baby

What the water is to the sea

Oh, you are to me, baby

What the water is to the sea

I only want your love, baby

So tell me why don't you want me



Yes, I don't believe in miracles

I believe what's to be will be

Yes, I don't believe, I don't believe in miracles

I only believe what's to be will be

Yes but if I did believe in miracles, baby

Baby, you would be a miracle to me



Yes, you're my first thought baby

Yes my last and in between

Oh, you're my first thought baby

Yes my last and in between

I say you're the greatest champion baby

Oh that any man has ever seen
