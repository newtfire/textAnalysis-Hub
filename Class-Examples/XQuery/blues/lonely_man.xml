<lyrics>


<l>I'm a lonely man, wrapped up all in this world of mine

</l>
<l>Lord I'm lonely, I'm wrapped up all in this old world of mine

</l>
<l>Now I gotta find me somebody, an' I won't have to sing these blues an

cry




</l>
<l>I feel bad, I feel so bad than I ever been, Lord, I feel bad, bad,
bad

</l>
<l>I feel so bad than I ever been

</l>
<l>Now I ain't had no good lovin', well, well, well, since you know

when




</l>
<l>Well now I went out with my woman last night

</l>
<l>She asked me what did I wanna do

</l>
<l>I said, "I need some lovin' darlin' "

</l>
<l>She said, "Ooo what the hell bit you?"



</l>
<l>Now I'm lonely

</l>
<l>I'm wrapped up all in this old world of mine, oh Lord

</l>
<l>Now if I don't find nobody

</l>
<l>I'm stayin' home 'til I die</l></lyrics></xml>
