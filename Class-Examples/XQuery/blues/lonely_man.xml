<lyrics>



I'm a lonely man, wrapped up all in this world of mine

Lord I'm lonely, I'm wrapped up all in this old world of mine

Now I gotta find me somebody, an' I won't have to sing these blues an
cry



I feel bad, I feel so bad than I ever been, Lord, I feel bad, bad,
bad

I feel so bad than I ever been

Now I ain't had no good lovin', well, well, well, since you know
when



Well now I went out with my woman last night

She asked me what did I wanna do

I said, "I need some lovin' darlin' "

She said, "Ooo what the hell bit you?"



Now I'm lonely

I'm wrapped up all in this old world of mine, oh Lord

Now if I don't find nobody

I'm stayin' home 'til I die
