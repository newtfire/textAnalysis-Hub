<lyrics>



I worked hard today

An' I'm tired as a man can be

I'm not too tired for some a-your lovin'

The love you give straight to me



I never get tired of what ya got, darlin'

You know where it's at

I love the way ya rub my back



I work on a construction job

I work long hours ev'ryday

Oh, my head is achin' when I get home

But I want your lovin' anyway



Oh you know how to ease the pain

An' that's a fact

An' I love the way you rub my back



Your love kills my pain

It kills my pain, ev'ry night

Oh you're ninety-six pounds, baby

You're ninety-six pounds a-dynamite



After I play with the kids

I'm ready to relax

You can put the kids to bed

An' come an' rub my back



(Rub my back)

(Rub my back)

(Rub my back)

(Rub my back)



(Rub my back)

(Rub my back)

(Rub my back)

(Rub my back)



(Rub my back)

(Rub my back)

(Rub my back)



(Rub my back)

(Rub my back)

Fading:

(Rub my back)

(Rub my back)

(Rub my back)
