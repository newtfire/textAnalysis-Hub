<lyrics>



You let me down

All over town

I guess by now I should be gone

Yet here I stand

Still in your hands

Cause you're the best I've ever known



I try and try to say good-bye

I just can't leave your love alone

And after you what will I do

I just can't leave your love alone



I walk away most everyday

Don't need a love that hurts me so

Then every night you get it right

Until I'm moaning soft and low



I try and try to say good-bye

I just can't leave your love alone

And after you what will I do

I just can't leave your love alone
