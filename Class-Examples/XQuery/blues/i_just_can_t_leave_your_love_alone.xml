<lyrics>


<l>You let me down

</l>
<l>All over town

</l>
<l>I guess by now I should be gone

</l>
<l>Yet here I stand

</l>
<l>Still in your hands

</l>
<l>Cause you're the best I've ever known



</l>
<l>I try and try to say good-bye

</l>
<l>I just can't leave your love alone

</l>
<l>And after you what will I do

</l>
<l>I just can't leave your love alone



</l>
<l>I walk away most everyday

</l>
<l>Don't need a love that hurts me so

</l>
<l>Then every night you get it right

</l>
<l>Until I'm moaning soft and low



</l>
<l>I try and try to say good-bye

</l>
<l>I just can't leave your love alone

</l>
<l>And after you what will I do

</l>
<l>I just can't leave your love alone</l></lyrics></xml>
