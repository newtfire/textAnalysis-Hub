<lyrics>



Wanna tell you a story,

about the house-man blues

I come home one Friday,

had to tell the landlady I'd-a lost my job

She said that don't confront me,

long as I get my money next Friday

Now next Friday come I didn't get the rent,

and out the door I went



So I goes to the landlady,

I said, "You let me slide?"

I'll have the rent for you in a month.

next I don't know

So said let me slide it on you know people,

I notice when I come home in the evening

She ain't got nothing nice to say to me,

but for five year she was so nice

Loh' she was lovy-dovy,

I come home one particular evening

The landlady said, "You got the rent money yet?",

I said, "No, can't find no job"

Therefore I ain't got no money to pay the rent

She said "I don't believe you're tryin' to find no job"

Said "I seen you today you was standin' on a corner,

leaning up against a post"

I said "But I'm tired, I've been walkin' all day"

She said "That don't confront me,

long as I get my money next Friday"

Now next Friday come I didn't have the rent,

and out the door I went



So I go down the streets,

down to my good friend's house

I said "Look man I'm outdoors you know,

can I stay with you maybe a couple days?"

He said "Let me go and ask my wife"

He come out of the house,

I could see it in his face

I know that was no

He said "I don't know man, ah she kinda funny, you know"

I said "I know, everybody funny, now you funny too"

So I go back home

I tell the landlady I got a job, I'm gonna pay the rent

She said "Yeah?" I said "Oh yeah"

And then she was so nice,

loh' she was lovy-dovy

So I go in my room, pack up my things and I go,

I slip on out the back door and down the streets I go

She a-howlin' about the front rent, she'll be lucky to get any back
rent,

she ain't gonna get none of it

So I stop in the local bar you know people,

I go to the bar, I ring my coat, I call the bartender

Said "Look man, come down here", he got down there

So what you want?



One bourbon, one scotch, one beer

Well I ain't seen my baby since I don't know when,

I've been drinking bourbon, whiskey, scotch and gin

Gonna get high man I'm gonna get loose,

need me a triple shot of that juice

Gonna get drunk don't you have no fear

I want one bourbon, one scotch and one beer

One bourbon, one scotch, one beer



But I'm sitting now at the bar,

I'm getting drunk, I'm feelin' mellow

I'm drinkin' bourbon, I'm drinkin' scotch, I'm drinkin' beer

Looked down the bar, here come the bartender

I said "Look man, come down here"

So what you want?



One bourbon, one scotch, one beer

No I ain't seen my baby since the night before last,

gotta get a drink man I'm gonna get gassed

Gonna get high man I ain't had enough,

need me a triple shot of that stuff

Gonna get drunk won't you listen right here,

I want one bourbon, one shot and one beer

One bourbon, one scotch, one beer



Now by this time I'm plenty high,

you know when your mouth a-getting dry you're plenty high

Looked down the bar I say to my bartender

I said "Look man, come down here", he got down there

So what you want this time?

I said "Look man, a-what time is it?"

He said "The clock on the wall say three o'clock

Last call for alcohol, so what you need?"



One bourbon, one scotch, one beer

No I ain't seen my baby since a nigh' and a week,

gotta get drunk man till I can't even speak

Gonna get high man listen to me,

one drink ain't enough Jack you better make it three

I wanna get drunk I'm gonna make it real clear,

I want one bourbon, one scotch and one beer

One bourbon, one scotch, one beer
