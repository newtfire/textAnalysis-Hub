<lyrics>


<l>It was early in the mo'nin, I heard the rooster crow for
days

</l>
<l>It was early in the mo'nin, I heard the rooster crow for days

</l>
<l>I looked out my window and saw my baby walk away



</l>
<l>I thought Lord, please stop her, ain't gonna get drunk no mo'

</l>
<l>I thought Lord, please stop her, ain't gonna get drunk no mo'

</l>
<l>I hollered out my window, "Come back baby please don't go"



</l>
<l>I know she heard me callin', she looked back and waved her hand

</l>
<l>I know she heard me callin', she looked back and waved her hand

</l>
<l>I could hear her tell her mother, "That's one no good man!"



</l>
<l>Well, I watched my baby leave, her mother had her by the hand

</l>
<l>Well, I watched my baby leave, her mother had her by the hand

</l>
<l>I'd give anything I have, just to see my little girl again</l></lyrics></xml>
