<lyrics>



It was early in the mo'nin, I heard the rooster crow for
days

It was early in the mo'nin, I heard the rooster crow for days

I looked out my window and saw my baby walk away



I thought Lord, please stop her, ain't gonna get drunk no mo'

I thought Lord, please stop her, ain't gonna get drunk no mo'

I hollered out my window, "Come back baby please don't go"



I know she heard me callin', she looked back and waved her hand

I know she heard me callin', she looked back and waved her hand

I could hear her tell her mother, "That's one no good man!"



Well, I watched my baby leave, her mother had her by the hand

Well, I watched my baby leave, her mother had her by the hand

I'd give anything I have, just to see my little girl again
