<lyrics>



Goin' up, goin' down

Goin' up, down, down, up

Anyway you want me let it roll

Yeah, yeah, yeah

You've got me doin' what you want me

Baby what-cha want me to do?



Rock me baby, rock me all night long

Rock me baby, rock me all night long

I want 'cha to rock me baby, 'til my back ain't got no bone



I want 'cha to roll me, roll me like a wagon wheel

I want 'cha to roll me, baby, roll me like a wagon wheel

I want 'cha to roll me baby, 'til I'm in love with you
