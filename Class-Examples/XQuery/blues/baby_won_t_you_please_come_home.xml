<lyrics>



I've got the blues, I feel so lonely

I'll give the world if I could only

Make you understand

It surely would be grand



I'm gonna telephone my baby

Ask him won't you please come home

'Cause when you're gone, I'm worried all day long



Baby won't you please come home

Baby won't you please come home

I have tried in vain

Ever more to call your name

When you left you broke my heart

That will never make us part

Every hour in the day

You will hear me say

Baby won't you please come home, I mean

Baby won't you please come home



Baby won't you please come home

'Cause your mama's all alone

I have tried in vain

Never more to call your name

When you left you broke my heart

That will never make us part

Landlord gettin' worse, I've got to move May the first

Baby won't you please come home, I need money

Baby won't you please come home
