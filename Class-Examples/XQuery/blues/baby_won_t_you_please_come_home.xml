<lyrics>


<l>I've got the blues, I feel so lonely

</l>
<l>I'll give the world if I could only

</l>
<l>Make you understand

</l>
<l>It surely would be grand



</l>
<l>I'm gonna telephone my baby

</l>
<l>Ask him won't you please come home

</l>
<l>'Cause when you're gone, I'm worried all day long



</l>
<l>Baby won't you please come home

</l>
<l>Baby won't you please come home

</l>
<l>I have tried in vain

</l>
<l>Ever more to call your name

</l>
<l>When you left you broke my heart

</l>
<l>That will never make us part

</l>
<l>Every hour in the day

</l>
<l>You will hear me say

</l>
<l>Baby won't you please come home, I mean

</l>
<l>Baby won't you please come home



</l>
<l>Baby won't you please come home

</l>
<l>'Cause your mama's all alone

</l>
<l>I have tried in vain

</l>
<l>Never more to call your name

</l>
<l>When you left you broke my heart

</l>
<l>That will never make us part

</l>
<l>Landlord gettin' worse, I've got to move May the first

</l>
<l>Baby won't you please come home, I need money

</l>
<l>Baby won't you please come home</l></lyrics></xml>
