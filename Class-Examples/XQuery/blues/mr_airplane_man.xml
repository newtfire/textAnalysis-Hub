<lyrics>



Mr. Airplane man, will you fly down to Jackson for me

Mr. Airplane man, will you fly to Jackson for me

I want you fly to my baby, and give her this here message for me

Ahhoooo, ahhoooo, ahhhoooo, ahhhoooo



My baby not at home, you didn't worry about knockin' on her door

My baby not at home, you didn't worry about knockin' on her door

Ahhoooo, ahhoooo, ahhhoooo

She might be visitin', at the next door neighbor's you know



If you don't find my baby, come on back to Chicago to me

If you don't find my baby, come on to Chicago to me

Ahhoooo, ahhoooo, ahhhoooo, come on back to me
