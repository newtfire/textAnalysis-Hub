<lyrics>



Throw me away

You can treat me like trash

But still I turn around babe

An' give ya all-a my cash



You can send me far away

Somewhere down on the track, now

But just like a boomerang baby you know

I'll come right back



There ain't nothin' you can do, darlin'

To stop me from lovin' you

Oh, there's nothin' you can say, darlin'

Little girl, to drive me away



You can call me names

In the presence of my friend

That wouldn't hurt my feelin's

You know that wouldn't mean a thing



It's gonna take a miracle

To drive me away

I'll be around babe, until I'm old an' gray



There is nothin' you can do babe

To stop me from lovin' you

Oh, there's nothin' you can say, little girl

Darlin', to drive me away



Oh, hahaha, come on, ya'all

Well, alright



You can play with my heart

Like kids play with toys

I wouldn't give a damn

If ya tore it apart



You can walk all over me

Then treat me like dirt

So much in love wit' cha darlin'

I wouldn't even feel the hurt



There is nothin' you can do, babe

To stop me from lovin' you

No, there's nothin' you can say, little girl

Honey, to drive me away



'Cause I'm satisfied, with the love ya give

I love ya baby, an' I know it's for real

It's gonna take a miracle to drive me away

But I'll be lovin' ya darlin' until I'm old an' gray



There is nothin' you can do babe

To stop me from lovin' you

Hey, there is nothin' you can say, little girl

Honey to drive me away



Woo! hoo-hoo!



Well, alright!

Um!

Oh!

Woo!

Woo!

Well, alright!
