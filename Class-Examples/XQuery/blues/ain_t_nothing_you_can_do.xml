<lyrics>


<l>Throw me away

</l>
<l>You can treat me like trash

</l>
<l>But still I turn around babe

</l>
<l>An' give ya all-a my cash



</l>
<l>You can send me far away

</l>
<l>Somewhere down on the track, now

</l>
<l>But just like a boomerang baby you know

</l>
<l>I'll come right back



</l>
<l>There ain't nothin' you can do, darlin'

</l>
<l>To stop me from lovin' you

</l>
<l>Oh, there's nothin' you can say, darlin'

</l>
<l>Little girl, to drive me away



</l>
<l>You can call me names

</l>
<l>In the presence of my friend

</l>
<l>That wouldn't hurt my feelin's

</l>
<l>You know that wouldn't mean a thing



</l>
<l>It's gonna take a miracle

</l>
<l>To drive me away

</l>
<l>I'll be around babe, until I'm old an' gray



</l>
<l>There is nothin' you can do babe

</l>
<l>To stop me from lovin' you

</l>
<l>Oh, there's nothin' you can say, little girl

</l>
<l>Darlin', to drive me away



</l>
<l>Oh, hahaha, come on, ya'all

</l>
<l>Well, alright



</l>
<l>You can play with my heart

</l>
<l>Like kids play with toys

</l>
<l>I wouldn't give a damn

</l>
<l>If ya tore it apart



</l>
<l>You can walk all over me

</l>
<l>Then treat me like dirt

</l>
<l>So much in love wit' cha darlin'

</l>
<l>I wouldn't even feel the hurt



</l>
<l>There is nothin' you can do, babe

</l>
<l>To stop me from lovin' you

</l>
<l>No, there's nothin' you can say, little girl

</l>
<l>Honey, to drive me away



</l>
<l>'Cause I'm satisfied, with the love ya give

</l>
<l>I love ya baby, an' I know it's for real

</l>
<l>It's gonna take a miracle to drive me away

</l>
<l>But I'll be lovin' ya darlin' until I'm old an' gray



</l>
<l>There is nothin' you can do babe

</l>
<l>To stop me from lovin' you

</l>
<l>Hey, there is nothin' you can say, little girl

</l>
<l>Honey to drive me away



</l>
<l>Woo! hoo-hoo!



</l>
<l>Well, alright!

</l>
<l>Um!

</l>
<l>Oh!
