<lyrics>



Well, my bad luck is falling, falling down like rain

Bad luck is falling, falling down like rain

No matter what I do, seems like my luck won't never change



I felt kinda lucky

My luck was running slow

The last hand I caught four aces

And the police broke down the door

I said, Lord, Lord, what can a poor boy do?

Well, ain't it bad when you can't make no money

Seems like all the bad breaks will come to you



Yeah, I got home this morning

She was looking kinda funny

She said "Don't come in, daddy

Daddy, unless you got some money"

And I said, Lord, Lord, what can a poor boy do?

Well, ain't it tough when you can't make no money

Without your woman turning her back on you



Well now, I asked my woman for some dinner

She looked at me like a fool

She said, "I'm playing checkers, daddy

And I think it's your turn to move"

I said, oh, Lord, what can a poor boy do?

Yes, it's bad when you can't make no money

And your woman turns her back on you
