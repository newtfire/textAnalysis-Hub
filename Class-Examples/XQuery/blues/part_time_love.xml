<l>Try it one more, please



</l>
<l>You know I got to find me

</l>
<l>People, I got to find me

</l>
<l>A part time love

</l>
<l>Oh I need

</l>
<l>I need me a part time love

</l>
<l>Every time

</l>
<l>Every time my baby leaves me

</l>
<l>You know I need a part time love



</l>
<l>The people in the cemetery

</l>
<l>They're not all alone

</l>
<l>Some turn to dust

</l>
<l>And some have bone

</l>
<l>You know I'd rather be dead

</l>
<l>Six feet in my grave

</l>
<l>Than to live lonely

</l>
<l>Each and everyday



</l>
<l>I need me

</l>
<l>I need me a part time love

</l>
<l>Every time my woman leaves me

</l>
<l>You know I need a part time love



</l>
<l>She came home this morning

</l>
<l>I asked her where she'd been

</l>
<l>She said, "Don't ask me

</l>
<l>No questions, baby

</l>
<l>'Cause I'll be leaving again"



</l>
<l>I've got to find me

</l>
<l>Don't you see, I've got to find me

</l>
<l>A part time love

</l>
<l>My baby leaves me

</l>
<l>I need a part time love

</l>
<l>Yes, I do



</l>
<l>Oh every time my woman leaves me

</l>
<l>Have to suffer

</l>
<l>The whole time she's gone

</l>
<l>I got to say it again

</l>
<l>When she leaves me

</l>
<l>I suffer every time she's gone

</l>
<l>When she leaves me

</l>
<l>I just got to have me a part time love

</l>
<l>Is there somebody out there



</l>
<l>Oh I need

</l>
<l>Mm, I need me a part time love

</l>
<l>Can't say it too much

</l>
<l>I need, oh, I need...</l></lyrics></xml>
