Try it one more, please



You know I got to find me

People, I got to find me

A part time love

Oh I need

I need me a part time love

Every time

Every time my baby leaves me

You know I need a part time love



The people in the cemetery

They're not all alone

Some turn to dust

And some have bone

You know I'd rather be dead

Six feet in my grave

Than to live lonely

Each and everyday



I need me

I need me a part time love

Every time my woman leaves me

You know I need a part time love



She came home this morning

I asked her where she'd been

She said, "Don't ask me

No questions, baby

'Cause I'll be leaving again"



I've got to find me

Don't you see, I've got to find me

A part time love

My baby leaves me

I need a part time love

Yes, I do



Oh every time my woman leaves me

Have to suffer

The whole time she's gone

I got to say it again

When she leaves me

I suffer every time she's gone

When she leaves me

I just got to have me a part time love

Is there somebody out there



Oh I need

Mm, I need me a part time love

Can't say it too much

I need, oh, I need...
