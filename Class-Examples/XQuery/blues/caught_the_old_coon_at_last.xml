<lyrics>

<l>Here I am, head over heel in love again

</l>
<l>Here I am, head over heel in love again

</l>
<l>Besides you, woman it was my mother and that's where love begins



</l>
<l>I used to be a playboy, I played hard both night and day

</l>
<l>I used to be a playboy and I played hard both night and day

</l>
<l>But since I met Miss Lemon, she has made me change my ways



</l>
<l>Oh yes woman, you've caught the old coon
1
at last </l>
<l>
Oh yes woman, you have caught the old coon at last

</l>
<l>But I just hope I be happy with my future, as I am with my present
and past



</l>
<l>Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes

</l>
<l>They caught the old coon at last



</l>
<l>Now I love the life I'm livin', and I'm livin' the life I love

</l>
<l>Now I love the life I'm livin', and I'm livin' the life I love

</l>
<l>Woman I don't believe I could be any happier, if I was livin' in
heaven above
