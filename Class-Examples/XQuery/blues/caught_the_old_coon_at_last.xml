<lyrics>



Here I am, head over heel in love again

Here I am, head over heel in love again

Besides you, woman it was my mother and that's where love begins



I used to be a playboy, I played hard both night and day

I used to be a playboy and I played hard both night and day

But since I met Miss Lemon, she has made me change my ways



Oh yes woman, you've caught the old coon
1
 at last

Oh yes woman, you have caught the old coon at last

But I just hope I be happy with my future, as I am with my present
and past



Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes

They caught the old coon at last



Now I love the life I'm livin', and I'm livin' the life I love

Now I love the life I'm livin', and I'm livin' the life I love

Woman I don't believe I could be any happier, if I was livin' in
heaven above



__________

Note 1: coon, usually an offensive word for black person.
