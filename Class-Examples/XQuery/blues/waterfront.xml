<lyrics>


<l>I cover the waterfront, watchin' the ship go by

</l>
<l>I could see, everybody's baby, but I couldn't see mine

</l>
<l>I could see, the ships pullin' in, to the harbor

</l>
<l>I could see the people, meetin' their loved one

</l>
<l>Shakin' hand, I sat there,

</l>
<l>so all alone, coverin' the waterfront



</l>
<l>And after a while, all the people,

</l>
<l>left the harbor, and headed for their destination

</l>
<l>All the ships, left the harbor,

</l>
<l>and headed for their next destination

</l>
<l>I sat there, coverin' the waterfront



</l>
<l>And after a while, I looked down the ocean,

</l>
<l>as far as I could see, in the fog, I saw a ship

</l>
<l>It headed, this way, comin' out the foam

</l>
<l>It must be my baby, comin' down

</l>
<l>And after a while, the ship pulled into the harbor,

</l>
<l>rollin' slow, so cripple

</l>
<l>And my baby, stepped off board

</l>
<l>I was still, coverin' the waterfront



</l>
<l>Said "Johnny, our ship had trouble, with the fog

</l>
<l>And that's why we're so late, so late

</l>
<l>Comin' home, comin' down'



</l>
