<lyrics>



I cover the waterfront, watchin' the ship go by

I could see, everybody's baby, but I couldn't see mine

I could see, the ships pullin' in, to the harbor

I could see the people, meetin' their loved one

Shakin' hand, I sat there,

so all alone, coverin' the waterfront



And after a while, all the people,

left the harbor, and headed for their destination

All the ships, left the harbor,

and headed for their next destination

I sat there, coverin' the waterfront



And after a while, I looked down the ocean,

as far as I could see, in the fog, I saw a ship

It headed, this way, comin' out the foam

It must be my baby, comin' down

And after a while, the ship pulled into the harbor,

rollin' slow, so cripple

And my baby, stepped off board

I was still, coverin' the waterfront



Said "Johnny, our ship had trouble, with the fog

And that's why we're so late, so late

Comin' home, comin' down'

"Waterfront".
