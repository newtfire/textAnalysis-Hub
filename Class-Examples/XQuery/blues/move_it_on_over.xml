<lyrics>


<l>I come in last night about half past ten,

</l>
<l>that baby of mine wouldn't let me in

</l>
<l>So move it on over, rock it on over,

</l>
<l>move over little dog, the mean old dog is movin' in



</l>
<l>She told me not to mess around,

</l>
<l>but I done let the deal go down

</l>
<l>Move it on over, rock it on over,

</l>
<l>move over nice dog, the big fat dog is movin' in



</l>
<l>She changed the lock on my back door,

</l>
<l>now my key won't fit no more

</l>
<l>Move it on over, rock it on over,

</l>
<l>move over nice dog, the mean old dog is movin' in



</l>
<l>She threw me out just as pretty as she pleased,

</l>
<l>pretty soon I'll be scratchin' fleas

</l>
<l>Move it on over, slide it on over,

</l>
<l>move over nice dog, the mean old dog is movin' in



</l>
<l>Yeah, listen to me dog before you start to whine,

</l>
<l>that side yours and this side mine

</l>
<l>So move it on over, rock it on over,

</l>
<l>move over little dog, the big old dog is movin' in



</l>
<l>Yeah, she changed the lock on my back door,

</l>
<l>now my key won't fit no more

</l>
<l>Move it on over, rock it on over,

</l>
<l>move over little dog, the big old dog is movin' in



</l>
<l>Move it on over, move it on over

</l>
<l>Move it on over, won't'cha rock it on over

</l>
<l>Move over cool dog, the hot dog's movin' in</l></lyrics></xml>
