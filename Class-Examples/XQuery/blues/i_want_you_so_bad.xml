<lyrics>


<l>Have you ever wanted someone

</l>
<l>And you thought they didn't want you

</l>
<l>Have you ever, ever wanted someone

</l>
<l>And you thought they didn't want you

</l>
<l>You know what you wanted

</l>
<l>To say to them, people

</l>
<l>But you were afraid she may walk away



</l>
<l>Someone like you, baby

</l>
<l>Someone like you I ain't never had

</l>
<l>Oh someone, someone like you

</l>
<l>Someone like you I ain't never had

</l>
<l>Maybe I'm asking too much, baby

</l>
<l>Oh but I want you, I want you so bad



</l>
<l>Oh you look so good to me, baby

</l>
<l>Baby, I just got to let you know

</l>
<l>Yeah, you look so good

</l>
<l>So good to me, baby

</l>
<l>I just got to let you know

</l>
<l>I wanna keep you forever, baby

</l>
<l>I don't wanna ever let you go



</l>
<l>So whatever you do, baby

</l>
<l>Please leave me a way

</l>
<l>To get in touch with you

</l>
<l>Oh whatever, ever you do, baby

</l>
<l>Please leave me a way

</l>
<l>To get in touch with you

</l>
<l>I need you so bad, baby

</l>
<l>When you leave I'll be so sad</l></lyrics></xml>
