<lyrics>



Have you ever wanted someone

And you thought they didn't want you

Have you ever, ever wanted someone

And you thought they didn't want you

You know what you wanted

To say to them, people

But you were afraid she may walk away



Someone like you, baby

Someone like you I ain't never had

Oh someone, someone like you

Someone like you I ain't never had

Maybe I'm asking too much, baby

Oh but I want you, I want you so bad



Oh you look so good to me, baby

Baby, I just got to let you know

Yeah, you look so good

So good to me, baby

I just got to let you know

I wanna keep you forever, baby

I don't wanna ever let you go



So whatever you do, baby

Please leave me a way

To get in touch with you

Oh whatever, ever you do, baby

Please leave me a way

To get in touch with you

I need you so bad, baby

When you leave I'll be so sad
