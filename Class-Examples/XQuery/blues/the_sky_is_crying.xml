<l>The sky is cryin', look at the tears rollin' down the street

</l>
<l>The sky is cryin', look at the tears rollin' down the street

</l>
<l>I been lookin' for my baby, I wonder where she can be

</l>
<l>That's right



</l>
<l>I saw my baby one mornin' and she was walkin' on down the street

</l>
<l>I saw my baby one mornin' and she was walkin' on down the street

</l>
<l>Yes, she was

</l>
<l>You know it hurt me so bad, it made my poor heart skip a beat

</l>
<l>Here we go, play it for me



</l>
<l>I've got a bad, bad feelin', my baby don't love me no more

</l>
<l>I've got a bad, bad feelin', my baby don't love me no more, no

</l>
<l>The sky is cryin', woh, look at the tears rolling down my nose



</l>
<l>The sky is cryin', look at the tears rollin' down the street,
yeah

</l>
<l>The sky is cryin', look at the tears rollin' down the street

</l>
<l>I been lookin' for my baby, I wonder where my baby can be</l></lyrics></xml>
