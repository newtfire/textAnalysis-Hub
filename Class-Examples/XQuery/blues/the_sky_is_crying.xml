<lyrics>



The sky is cryin', look at the tears rollin' down the street

The sky is cryin', look at the tears rollin' down the street

I been lookin' for my baby, I wonder where she can be

That's right



I saw my baby one mornin' and she was walkin' on down the street

I saw my baby one mornin' and she was walkin' on down the street

Yes, she was

You know it hurt me so bad, it made my poor heart skip a beat

Here we go, play it for me



I've got a bad, bad feelin', my baby don't love me no more

I've got a bad, bad feelin', my baby don't love me no more, no

The sky is cryin', woh, look at the tears rolling down my nose



The sky is cryin', look at the tears rollin' down the street,
yeah

The sky is cryin', look at the tears rollin' down the street

I been lookin' for my baby, I wonder where my baby can be
