<lyrics>


<l>Runnin' through this business of life,

</l>
<l>rarely time if I'm needed to

</l>
<l>Ain't so funny when things ain't feelin' right,

</l>
<l>then daddy's hand helps to see me through

</l>
<l>Sweet as sugar love won't wash away,

</l>
<l>rain or shine, it always here to stay

</l>
<l>All these years you and I've spent together,

</l>
<l>all this, we just couldn't stand the weather



</l>
<l>Like a train that stops at every station,

</l>
<l>we all deal with trials and tribulations

</l>
<l>Fear hangs the fellow that ties up his years,

</l>
<l>entangled in yellow and cries all his tears

</l>
<l>Changes come before we can grow,

</l>
<l>learn to see them before we're too old

</l>
<l>Don't just take me for tryin' to be heavy,

</l>
<l>understand, it's time to get ready for the storm
