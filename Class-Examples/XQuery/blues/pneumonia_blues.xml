<l>I'm achin' all over, baby, b'lieve I got the pneumonia this time

</l>
<l>I'm achin' all over, baby, b'lieve I got the pneumonia this time

</l>
<l>An' it's all on account of that low-down gal of mine



</l>
<l>Slippin' round the corners, running up alleys too

</l>
<l>Slippin' round the corners, running up alleys too

</l>
<l>Watching my woman trying to see what she goin' do



</l>
<l>Sat out in the streets one cold, dark, stormy night

</l>
<l>Sat out in the streets one cold, dark, stormy night

</l>
<l>Trying to see if my good gal going to make it home all right



</l>
<l>Wearin' B.V.D.'s
1
in the winter, prowling 'round in the </l>
<l>rain

</l>
<l>Wearin' B.V.D.'s in the winter, prowling 'round in the rain

</l>
<l>Runnin' down baby, give me this pneumonia pain



</l>

<note>Note: diseases of the lungs accounted for a large number of deaths
among the black community in the late 1920's and early 1930's, mainly
caused by insufficient clothing, housing and medical care. Especially
recently arrived migrants form the south, unaccustomed to the cold
northern climate, improperly housed and with hardly any or no access
to medical care had to pay a high price in human lives. Issued by
Paramount under catalogue no. 12880;

Note 1: B.V.D.'s, trademark, generally used for underwear.</note></lyrics></xml>
