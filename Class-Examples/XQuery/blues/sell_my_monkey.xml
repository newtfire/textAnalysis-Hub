<l>Me and my baby

</l>
<l>Keeps falling out

</l>
<l>Let me tell you

</l>
<l>What it's all about



</l>
<l>She wanna sell my monkey

</l>
<l>She wanna sell my monkey

</l>
<l>She wanna sell my monkey

</l>
<l>But that'll never do



</l>
<l>It used to be hers

</l>
<l>But she gave it to me

</l>
<l>Why she wanna sell him

</l>
<l>I just can't see



</l>
<l>She wanna sell my monkey

</l>
<l>She wanna sell my monkey

</l>
<l>She wanna sell my monkey

</l>
<l>But that'll never do



</l>
<l>She wanna know

</l>
<l>Why we don't get along

</l>
<l>She don't realize

</l>
<l>She's doing me wrong



</l>
<l>She wanna sell my monkey

</l>
<l>She wanna sell my monkey

</l>
<l>She wanna sell my monkey

</l>
<l>But that'll never do



</l>
<l>I have to hang around

</l>
<l>Every day and night

</l>
<l>I can't trust the girl

</l>
<l>Out of my sight



</l>
<l>She wanna sell my monkey

</l>
<l>She wanna sell my monkey

</l>
<l>She wanna sell my monkey

</l>
<l>But that'll never do</l></lyrics></xml>
