<lyrics>



Me and my baby

Keeps falling out

Let me tell you

What it's all about



She wanna sell my monkey

She wanna sell my monkey

She wanna sell my monkey

But that'll never do



It used to be hers

But she gave it to me

Why she wanna sell him

I just can't see



She wanna sell my monkey

She wanna sell my monkey

She wanna sell my monkey

But that'll never do



She wanna know

Why we don't get along

She don't realize

She's doing me wrong



She wanna sell my monkey

She wanna sell my monkey

She wanna sell my monkey

But that'll never do



I have to hang around

Every day and night

I can't trust the girl

Out of my sight



She wanna sell my monkey

She wanna sell my monkey

She wanna sell my monkey

But that'll never do
