<lyrics>



Oh darling, what happened to that beautiful smile?

The ones you gave me any time we were face to face

Oh is it someone else taking my place

Oh baby, what happened



Oh what happened to those fast heartbeats?

The ones that excited me so

Oh tell me, don't you love me

Oh, baby, don't you care any more?

Darling, what happened



Oh it's so sad what a little time can do

Oh when you're hanging out with another

Losing a love with you

All those good times we had

Baby, just me and you



Oh darling, before I go

There's one thing I'd like to know

Don't you love me?

Don't you care any more?

Darling, what happened
