<lyrics>


<l>Oh darling, what happened to that beautiful smile?

</l>
<l>The ones you gave me any time we were face to face

</l>
<l>Oh is it someone else taking my place

</l>
<l>Oh baby, what happened



</l>
<l>Oh what happened to those fast heartbeats?

</l>
<l>The ones that excited me so

</l>
<l>Oh tell me, don't you love me

</l>
<l>Oh, baby, don't you care any more?

</l>
<l>Darling, what happened



</l>
<l>Oh it's so sad what a little time can do

</l>
<l>Oh when you're hanging out with another

</l>
<l>Losing a love with you

</l>
<l>All those good times we had

</l>
<l>Baby, just me and you



</l>
<l>Oh darling, before I go

</l>
<l>There's one thing I'd like to know

</l>
<l>Don't you love me?

</l>
<l>Don't you care any more?

</l>
<l>Darling, what happened</l></lyrics></xml>
