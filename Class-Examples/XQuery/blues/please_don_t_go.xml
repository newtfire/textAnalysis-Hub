<l>Baby please don't go

</l>
<l>Baby please don't go

</l>
<l>Baby please don't go back to New Orleans

</l>
<l>Because I love you so



</l>
<l>Turn your lamp down low

</l>
<l>Turn your lamp down low

</l>
<l>Turn your lamp down low, my heart is beating so

</l>
<l>So baby please don't go



</l>
<l>Made me weep and moan

</l>
<l>You made me weep and moan

</l>
<l>You made me weep and moan, don't leave me all alone

</l>
<l>Baby please don't go



</l>
<l>You got me way down here

</l>
<l>You got me way down here

</l>
<l>You got me way down here, you didn't shed a tear

</l>
<l>Oh baby please don't go



</l>
<l>Baby please don't go

</l>
<l>Baby please don't go

</l>
<l>Baby please don't go</l></lyrics></xml>
