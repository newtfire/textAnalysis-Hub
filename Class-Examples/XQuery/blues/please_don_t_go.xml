<lyrics>



Baby please don't go

Baby please don't go

Baby please don't go back to New Orleans

Because I love you so



Turn your lamp down low

Turn your lamp down low

Turn your lamp down low, my heart is beating so

So baby please don't go



Made me weep and moan

You made me weep and moan

You made me weep and moan, don't leave me all alone

Baby please don't go



You got me way down here

You got me way down here

You got me way down here, you didn't shed a tear

Oh baby please don't go



Baby please don't go

Baby please don't go

Baby please don't go
