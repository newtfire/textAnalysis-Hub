<lyrics>


<l>People, I was standing at my window, tears running all down my
cheeks

</l>
<l>Yes, standing at my window, tears running all down my cheeks

</l>
<l>Well, I could see the woman I'm loving, stopping everyone in the

world she meets




</l>
<l>Well, standing on the corner, between 35th and Main

</l>
<l>Well, standing on the corner, people, between 35th and Main

</l>
<l>Yeah, that's where a blind man's seen my woman, people, a dumb man

called her name




</l>
<l>He said, "Oh, I'm blind, you brought eyesight and made me see"

</l>
<l>"Oh, I'm blind, you brought eyesight and made me see"

</l>
<l>Yes, and the dumb man asked a question, "Woman, who may your good man

be?"




</l>
<l>Yes, I'm standing by trembling, people, people, my heart's laying in
my hand

</l>
<l>I'm standing by trembling, darling, with my heart's laying in my
hand

</l>
<l>Well, I could hear my baby say, "Lord, I ain't got no man"</l></lyrics></xml>
