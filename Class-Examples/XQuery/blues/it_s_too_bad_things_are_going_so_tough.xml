<lyrics>



It's too bad, things are going so tough with me

Well it's too bad, things are going so tough with me

Well no matter what I do, seem like ev'rything happen to me



I used to have a car, and it was painted white an' black

I used to have a car, and it was painted white an' black

Well I couldn't keep up the payments, and the man, he took it
back



Yeah!



Now I used to smoke cigars

The very best in town

But bad luck an' trouble

Is bound to get me down



It's too bad, things are going so tough with me

Well no matter what I do

Seem like ev'rything I do happen to me



__________

Note: Federal Single #12415, April 1961.
