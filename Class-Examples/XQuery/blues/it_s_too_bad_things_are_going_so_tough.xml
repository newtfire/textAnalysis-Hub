<lyrics>


<l>It's too bad, things are going so tough with me

</l>
<l>Well it's too bad, things are going so tough with me

</l>
<l>Well no matter what I do, seem like ev'rything happen to me



</l>
<l>I used to have a car, and it was painted white an' black

</l>
<l>I used to have a car, and it was painted white an' black

</l>
<l>Well I couldn't keep up the payments, and the man, he took it

back




</l>
<l>Yeah!



</l>
<l>Now I used to smoke cigars

</l>
<l>The very best in town

</l>
<l>But bad luck an' trouble

</l>
<l>Is bound to get me down



</l>
<l>It's too bad, things are going so tough with me

</l>
<l>Well no matter what I do

</l>
<l>Seem like ev'rything I do happen to me



</l>
