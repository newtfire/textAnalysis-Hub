<lyrics>



Well, I'm tryin', yes I'm tryin just to get a line on you, where you
been?

But I'm havin' trouble puttin' a find on you, I'm wearin' thin

Somebody else been shaking your tree, supposed to saving all that
stuff for me



You been hidin', yes you're hidin', you been stayin' out on me,
sneakin' 'round

Me and you ain't workin' out just like we oughta be, you've got me
down

Somebody else been shaking your tree, supposed to be saving all that
stuff for me



I'm tired of foolin' around with you, and sittin' here alone, it's on
my mind

I think it's time for me to find a new tree of my own, it's plantin'
time

Anything you wanna do is cool with me, I don't care who shakes your
tree
