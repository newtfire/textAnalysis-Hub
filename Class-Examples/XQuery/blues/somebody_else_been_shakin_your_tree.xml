<lyrics>


<l>Well, I'm tryin', yes I'm tryin just to get a line on you, where you
been?

</l>
<l>But I'm havin' trouble puttin' a find on you, I'm wearin' thin

</l>
<l>Somebody else been shaking your tree, supposed to saving all that

stuff for me




</l>
<l>You been hidin', yes you're hidin', you been stayin' out on me,
sneakin' 'round

</l>
<l>Me and you ain't workin' out just like we oughta be, you've got me
down

</l>
<l>Somebody else been shaking your tree, supposed to be saving all that

stuff for me




</l>
<l>I'm tired of foolin' around with you, and sittin' here alone, it's on
my mind

</l>
<l>I think it's time for me to find a new tree of my own, it's plantin'
time

</l><l>Anything you wanna do is cool with me, I don't care who shakes your</l>
<l>tree</l></lyrics></xml>
