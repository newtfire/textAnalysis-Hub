<lyrics>


<l>Come back, baby, please don't leave me

</l>
<l>You know the way I love you, baby, you'll never know

</l>
<l>Come back, baby, let's talk it over one more time



</l>
<l>I cried last night, all the night before

</l>
<l>You were gonna leave me, baby, leave me all alone

</l>
<l>Come back, baby, let's talk it over one more time



</l>
<l>You know, baby, this world wasn't made in one day

</l>
<l>Can't we talk it over, baby, before you go away?

</l>
<l>Come back, baby, let's talk it over one more time



</l>
<l>Well, you know my heart is weak, beatin' like a clock

</l>
<l>If you don't come back to me, babe, I'm afraid it's gonna stop

</l>
<l>Come back, baby, let's talk it over one more time



</l>
<l>My heart is beatin' like a hammer, I really can tell

</l>
<l>You've been gone for twenty-four hours baby, seems like a thousand
years

</l>
<l>Come back, baby, let's talk it over one more time



</l>
<l>You know baby, this world wasn't made in one day

</l>
<l>Don't pay no attention, to what the people say

</l>
<l>Come back, baby, let's talk it over one more time</l></lyrics></xml>
