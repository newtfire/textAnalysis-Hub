<lyrics>



Come back, baby, please don't leave me

You know the way I love you, baby, you'll never know

Come back, baby, let's talk it over one more time



I cried last night, all the night before

You were gonna leave me, baby, leave me all alone

Come back, baby, let's talk it over one more time



You know, baby, this world wasn't made in one day

Can't we talk it over, baby, before you go away?

Come back, baby, let's talk it over one more time



Well, you know my heart is weak, beatin' like a clock

If you don't come back to me, babe, I'm afraid it's gonna stop

Come back, baby, let's talk it over one more time



My heart is beatin' like a hammer, I really can tell

You've been gone for twenty-four hours baby, seems like a thousand
years

Come back, baby, let's talk it over one more time



You know baby, this world wasn't made in one day

Don't pay no attention, to what the people say

Come back, baby, let's talk it over one more time
