<lyrics>


<l>I'm gonna write him a letter, gonna write him a song

</l>
<l>Gonna love my baby, gonna never do him wrong

</l>
<l>Gonna love my baby, gonna ease his troubled mind

</l>
<l>I'm gonna love that man until the end of time



</l>
<l>I said now if the end of time should come today

</l>
<l>I said there's just no way that I can stay away

</l>
<l>'Cause he's my baby, wanna ease his troubled mind

</l>
<l>I'm gonna love that man until the sun don't shine



</l>
<l>I said now if that sun should refuse to shine

</l>
<l>I'm gonna find my baby 'cause he's mine all mine

</l>
<l>I'm gonna find my baby gonna ease his troubled mind

</l>
<l>I'm gonna find that man 'cause he's mine all mine



</l>
<l>Now just the other day I heard somebody say that my man

</l>
<l>was running around with another woman

</l>
<l>Now this better not be true because if it is

</l>
<l>It's not gonna be a good thing

</l>
<l>He's gonna have to run and I'm gonna tell you right now

</l>
<l>what I'm gonna do with that man, I'll tell you right now



</l>
<l>I said now if that man should run he better hide

</l>
<l>I'm gonna find that man, I'm gonna take him for a ride

</l>
<l>I'm gonna find my baby, gonna give that man a troubled mind

</l>
<l>I'm gonna find that man and he won't get away alive

</l>
<l>I'm gonna find that man and he won't get away alive</l></lyrics></xml>
