<lyrics>



I'm gonna write him a letter, gonna write him a song

Gonna love my baby, gonna never do him wrong

Gonna love my baby, gonna ease his troubled mind

I'm gonna love that man until the end of time



I said now if the end of time should come today

I said there's just no way that I can stay away

'Cause he's my baby, wanna ease his troubled mind

I'm gonna love that man until the sun don't shine



I said now if that sun should refuse to shine

I'm gonna find my baby 'cause he's mine all mine

I'm gonna find my baby gonna ease his troubled mind

I'm gonna find that man 'cause he's mine all mine



Now just the other day I heard somebody say that my man

was running around with another woman

Now this better not be true because if it is

It's not gonna be a good thing

He's gonna have to run and I'm gonna tell you right now

what I'm gonna do with that man, I'll tell you right now



I said now if that man should run he better hide

I'm gonna find that man, I'm gonna take him for a ride

I'm gonna find my baby, gonna give that man a troubled mind

I'm gonna find that man and he won't get away alive

I'm gonna find that man and he won't get away alive
