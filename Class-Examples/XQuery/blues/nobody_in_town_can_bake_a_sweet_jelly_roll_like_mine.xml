<lyrics>


<l>In a bakery shop today

</l>
<l>I heard Miss Mandy Jenkins say

</l>
<l>She had the best cake, you see

</l>
<l>And they were fresh as fresh could be

</l>
<l>And as the people would pass by

</l>
<l>You would hear Miss Mandy cry



</l>
<l>Nobody in town can bake a sweet 
jelly
roll
like mine, like mine </l>
<l>
No other one in town can bake a sweet jelly roll so fine, so fine

</l>
<l>It's worth lots of dough, the boys tell me so

</l>
<l>It's fresh every day, you'll hear 'em all say

</l>
<l>Don't be no dunce, just try it once

</l>
<l>You'll be right in line

</l>
<l>Somebody told me I made the best jelly roll in town, I say in
town

</l>
<l>You must admit that I'm a jelly roll bakin' hound, bakin' hound

</l>
<l>Good jelly roll, jelly roll is so hard to find

</l>
<l>We always get the other kind

</l>
<l>Nobody in town can bake a sweet jelly roll like mine



</l>
<l>Somebody told me I made the best jelly roll in town, I say in
town

</l>
<l>You must admit that I'm a jelly roll bakin' hound, bakin' hound

</l>
<l>Good jelly roll, jelly roll from a bakery shop

</l>
<l>Will surely make a pool frog hop

</l><l>Nobody in town can bake a sweet jelly roll like mine, like mine</l></lyrics></xml>
