<lyrics>



In a bakery shop today

I heard Miss Mandy Jenkins say

She had the best cake, you see

And they were fresh as fresh could be

And as the people would pass by

You would hear Miss Mandy cry



Nobody in town can bake a sweet 
jelly
roll
 like mine, like mine

No other one in town can bake a sweet jelly roll so fine, so fine

It's worth lots of dough, the boys tell me so

It's fresh every day, you'll hear 'em all say

Don't be no dunce, just try it once

You'll be right in line

Somebody told me I made the best jelly roll in town, I say in
town

You must admit that I'm a jelly roll bakin' hound, bakin' hound

Good jelly roll, jelly roll is so hard to find

We always get the other kind

Nobody in town can bake a sweet jelly roll like mine



Somebody told me I made the best jelly roll in town, I say in
town

You must admit that I'm a jelly roll bakin' hound, bakin' hound

Good jelly roll, jelly roll from a bakery shop

Will surely make a pool frog hop

Nobody in town can bake a sweet jelly roll like mine, like mine
