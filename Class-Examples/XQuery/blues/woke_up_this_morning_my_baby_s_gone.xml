<lyrics>



I woke up this morning, my baby was gone

Woke up this morning, my baby was gone

I've been so bad, I'm all alone



I ain't got nobody stayin' home with me

I ain't got nobody stayin' home with me

My baby she's gone, I'm in misery



Well baby, I'm all alone

Yes baby, I'm all alone

I ain't had no lovin', since my baby's been gone



All right



Oh baby, I'm all alone

Oh baby, I'm all alone

My baby she's gone, I'm in misery



Oh baby, come on stay with me

Yes baby, come on stay with me

My baby she's gone, I'm in misery



Oh baby I'm all alone

Oh baby I'm all alone

I ain't had no lovin' since my baby been gone
