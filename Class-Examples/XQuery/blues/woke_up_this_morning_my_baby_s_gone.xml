<l>I woke up this morning, my baby was gone

</l>
<l>Woke up this morning, my baby was gone

</l>
<l>I've been so bad, I'm all alone



</l>
<l>I ain't got nobody stayin' home with me

</l>
<l>I ain't got nobody stayin' home with me

</l>
<l>My baby she's gone, I'm in misery



</l>
<l>Well baby, I'm all alone

</l>
<l>Yes baby, I'm all alone

</l>
<l>I ain't had no lovin', since my baby's been gone



</l>
<l>All right



</l>
<l>Oh baby, I'm all alone

</l>
<l>Oh baby, I'm all alone

</l>
<l>My baby she's gone, I'm in misery



</l>
<l>Oh baby, come on stay with me

</l>
<l>Yes baby, come on stay with me

</l>
<l>My baby she's gone, I'm in misery



</l>
<l>Oh baby I'm all alone

</l>
<l>Oh baby I'm all alone

</l>
<l>I ain't had no lovin' since my baby been gone</l></lyrics></xml>
