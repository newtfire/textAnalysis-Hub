<lyrics>



The best thing in life is free,

but you can give it to the birds an' bees

I need some money, need some money

Oh, yeah, what I want



Your love gimme such a thrill,

but your lovin' don' t pay my bills

I need some money, need some money

Oh, yeah, what I want



I need some money, honey

I need some money right away

I need some money bad

I need some money

Oh, yeah, what I want



Money don't get ever'thing it's true

But what it don't buy, daddy, I can't use

I need money, I need money, yeah

What I want



(spoken:

I need some money, honey

I need some money so bad

All o' my bills behind

I need some money right now

I know your love is good, baby)



I need some money, oh yeah

What I want

What I want
