<lyrics>



Now, I can't walk the streets, now, to consolate my mind,

some pretty mama, she start, breakin' down

Stop breakin' down, please, stop breakin' down

Now, the stuff I got'll bust your brains out, baby, hoo hoo, it'll
make you lose your mind



I can't walk the streets, now, to consolate my mind,

some no-good woman, now, she start breakin' down

Stop breakin' down, please, stop breakin' down

The stuff I got'll bust your brains out, baby, hoo hoo, it'll make
you lose your mind



You know the Saturday night women, now, they love to ape and
clown

They won't do nothin' but tear your, reputation down

Stop breakin' down, please, stop breakin' down

The stuff I got'll bust your brains out, baby, hoo hoo, it'll make
you lose your mind



Now I gave my baby, that ninety-nine degree

She jumped up and throwed a pistol, down on me

Stop breakin' down, please, stop breakin' down

That stuff I got'll bust your brains out, baby, hoo hoo, it'll make
you lose your mind



Now, that fiddle
1
 player, now, use, rosum on his bow

That don't make your fiddle cry, baby, you know it, don't go

Stop breakin' down, please, stop breakin' down

The stuff I got'll bust your brains out, baby, hoo hoo, it'll make
you lose your mind



__________

Note 1: fiddle, a stringed instrument of music played with a bow, a
