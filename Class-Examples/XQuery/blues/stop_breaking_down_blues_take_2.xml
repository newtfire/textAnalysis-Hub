<lyrics>

<l>Now, I can't walk the streets, now, to consolate my mind,

</l>
<l>some pretty mama, she start, breakin' down

</l>
<l>Stop breakin' down, please, stop breakin' down

</l>
<l>Now, the stuff I got'll bust your brains out, baby, hoo hoo, it'll
make you lose your mind



</l>
<l>I can't walk the streets, now, to consolate my mind,

</l>
<l>some no-good woman, now, she start breakin' down

</l>
<l>Stop breakin' down, please, stop breakin' down

</l>
<l>The stuff I got'll bust your brains out, baby, hoo hoo, it'll make
you lose your mind



</l>
<l>You know the Saturday night women, now, they love to ape and
clown

</l>
<l>They won't do nothin' but tear your, reputation down

</l>
<l>Stop breakin' down, please, stop breakin' down

</l>
<l>The stuff I got'll bust your brains out, baby, hoo hoo, it'll make
you lose your mind



</l>
<l>Now I gave my baby, that ninety-nine degree

</l>
<l>She jumped up and throwed a pistol, down on me

</l>
<l>Stop breakin' down, please, stop breakin' down

</l>
<l>That stuff I got'll bust your brains out, baby, hoo hoo, it'll make
you lose your mind



</l>
<l>Now, that fiddle
1
player, now, use, rosum on his bow </l>
<l>
That don't make your fiddle cry, baby, you know it, don't go

</l>
<l>Stop breakin' down, please, stop breakin' down

</l>
<l>The stuff I got'll bust your brains out, baby, hoo hoo, it'll make
you lose your mind



</l>
<note>Note 1: fiddle, a stringed instrument of music played with a bow, a
violin
