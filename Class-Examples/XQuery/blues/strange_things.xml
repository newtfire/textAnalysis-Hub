<lyrics>



Learn to love or leave me, either one you wanna do

Learn to love or leave me, either one you wanna do

Because strange things are happening and something may happen to
you



Well, if you know you don't want me baby, why in the world would you
let me be

Yes if you know you don't want me baby, tell me why would you let me
be

Because it's better to live without you baby, than to live on in
misery



Yeah, midnight finds me crying, oh daylight finds me crying too

Yes midnight finds me crying, daylight finds me crying too

You better straighten your mind pretty baby, because something may
happen to you
