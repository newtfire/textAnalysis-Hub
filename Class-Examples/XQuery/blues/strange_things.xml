<lyrics>


<l>Learn to love or leave me, either one you wanna do

</l>
<l>Learn to love or leave me, either one you wanna do

</l>
<l>Because strange things are happening and something may happen to

you




</l>
<l>Well, if you know you don't want me baby, why in the world would you
let me be

</l>
<l>Yes if you know you don't want me baby, tell me why would you let me
be

</l>
<l>Because it's better to live without you baby, than to live on in

misery




</l>
<l>Yeah, midnight finds me crying, oh daylight finds me crying too

</l>
<l>Yes midnight finds me crying, daylight finds me crying too

</l><l>You better straighten your mind pretty baby, because something may</l>
<l>happen to you</l></lyrics></xml>
