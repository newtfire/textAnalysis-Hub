<lyrics>


<l>At last

</l>
<l>My love has come along

</l>
<l>My lonely days are over

</l>
<l>And life is like a song



</l>
<l>At last

</l>
<l>The sky above is blue

</l>
<l>My heart was wrapped in clover

</l>
<l>The night I looked at you



</l>
<l>I found a dream, that I could speak to

</l>
<l>A dream that I, can call my own

</l>
<l>I found a thrill, to press my cheek to

</l>
<l>A thrill that I, have never ever known



</l>
<l>You, you smiled

</l>
<l>And then the spell was cast

</l>
<l>And here we are in heaven

</l>
<l>For you are mine at last



</l>
<l>I found a dream, I found a dream

</l>
<l>That I could speak to, baby

</l>
<l>A dream that I, can definitely call my own

</l>
<l>I found a thrill, I found a thrill

</l>
<l>To press my cheek to, to press my cheek to

</l>
<l>A thrill that I, have never ever known



</l>
<l>You smiled, you smiled, baby

</l>
<l>And then the spell was cast

</l>
<l>And here we are in heaven

</l>
<l>Yeah, yeah, yeah, for you are mine

</l>
<l>At last

</l>
<l>You are mine at last

</l>
<l>At last

</l>
<l>You're mine, baby</l></lyrics></xml>
