<lyrics>



At last

My love has come along

My lonely days are over

And life is like a song



At last

The sky above is blue

My heart was wrapped in clover

The night I looked at you



I found a dream, that I could speak to

A dream that I, can call my own

I found a thrill, to press my cheek to

A thrill that I, have never ever known



You, you smiled

And then the spell was cast

And here we are in heaven

For you are mine at last



I found a dream, I found a dream

That I could speak to, baby

A dream that I, can definitely call my own

I found a thrill, I found a thrill

To press my cheek to, to press my cheek to

A thrill that I, have never ever known



You smiled, you smiled, baby

And then the spell was cast

And here we are in heaven

Yeah, yeah, yeah, for you are mine

At last

You are mine at last

At last

You're mine, baby
