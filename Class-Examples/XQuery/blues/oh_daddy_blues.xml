<lyrics>



Just like a flower I am fading away

The doctor call to see me most every day

But he don't do me no good, why?

Because I'm lonesome for you

And if you care for me

Then you will listen to my plea

Oh, daddy, look what you doin', look what you doin'

Oh, daddy, you with your foolin', think what you're losin'

All the little love I gave you

Is goin' to make you feel so awfully blue

When you miss me and long to kiss me

You'll curse the day that you ever quit me

Oh, daddy, think when you're all alone

You'll get so lonely just wait and see

But there will be someone else makin' love to me

Then daddy, daddy, you won't have no mama at all



Oh, daddy, look what you doin', look what you doin'

Oh, daddy, you and your foolin', think what you losin'

All the little love I gave you

Is goin' to make me feel so awfully blue

When you miss me, and long to kiss me

You'll curse the day that you ever quit me

Oh, daddy, think when you're all alone

You know that you are getting old

You'll miss the way I baked your jelly roll

And daddy, daddy, you won't have no mama at all
