<lyrics>


<l>Just like a flower I am fading away

</l>
<l>The doctor call to see me most every day

</l>
<l>But he don't do me no good, why?

</l>
<l>Because I'm lonesome for you

</l>
<l>And if you care for me

</l>
<l>Then you will listen to my plea

</l>
<l>Oh, daddy, look what you doin', look what you doin'

</l>
<l>Oh, daddy, you with your foolin', think what you're losin'

</l>
<l>All the little love I gave you

</l>
<l>Is goin' to make you feel so awfully blue

</l>
<l>When you miss me and long to kiss me

</l>
<l>You'll curse the day that you ever quit me

</l>
<l>Oh, daddy, think when you're all alone

</l>
<l>You'll get so lonely just wait and see

</l>
<l>But there will be someone else makin' love to me

</l>
<l>Then daddy, daddy, you won't have no mama at all



</l>
<l>Oh, daddy, look what you doin', look what you doin'

</l>
<l>Oh, daddy, you and your foolin', think what you losin'

</l>
<l>All the little love I gave you

</l>
<l>Is goin' to make me feel so awfully blue

</l>
<l>When you miss me, and long to kiss me

</l>
<l>You'll curse the day that you ever quit me

</l>
<l>Oh, daddy, think when you're all alone

</l>
<l>You know that you are getting old

</l>
<l>You'll miss the way I baked your jelly roll

</l>
<l>And daddy, daddy, you won't have no mama at all</l></lyrics></xml>
