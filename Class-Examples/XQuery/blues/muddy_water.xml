<lyrics>



If I never get to heaven I don't care

I been down to the crossroads

And there ain't no devil down there

They got the whole town shakin'

Out in L.A.

They got the blues in Mississippi

I'm going back some day



And I ain't gonna fuss and fight

I ain't stayin' up all night

Worryin' 'bout the things that I can't change

Let everybody think I'm a little bit strange



(Chorus:)

Cause I love Muddy Water

It's dirty but it feels alright

I love Muddy Waters

I'm ready for the blues tonight-ooh yes I am



On my way to California

My old car broke down

I left it sittin' right there

And I walked on into town

I found a cheap hotel

Got a twenty dollar room

And when I woke up the next day

It was four o'clock in the afternoon



Well I ain't gonna fuss and fight

I ain't stayin' up all night

Worryin' 'bout the things that I can't change

Let everybody think I'm a little bit strange



(Chorus)



Ooh why should I worry all night and day

Whatever it is

It's gonna be ok



(Chorus)
