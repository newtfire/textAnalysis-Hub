<lyrics>



I got the blues, you know I'm so broke I wanna cry

Lord, I got 'em, you know I'm so broke I wanna cry

Because my baby she's gone and I just don't know the reason why



She got me walkin', I'm talkin' all to my lonely self

She got me walkin', I'm talkin' all to my lonely self

Whoa, Lord

I gotta find my baby, 'cause I don't want nobody else



Well now I love that woman so much

She got me on the run

She got the keys to my car

She got my great big mansion



She got me walkin', I'm talkin' all to my lonely self

I gotta find my baby, 'cause just don't want nobody else
