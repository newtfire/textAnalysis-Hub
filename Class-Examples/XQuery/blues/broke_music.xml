<lyrics>


<l>I got the blues, you know I'm so broke I wanna cry

</l>
<l>Lord, I got 'em, you know I'm so broke I wanna cry

</l>
<l>Because my baby she's gone and I just don't know the reason why



</l>
<l>She got me walkin', I'm talkin' all to my lonely self

</l>
<l>She got me walkin', I'm talkin' all to my lonely self

</l>
<l>Whoa, Lord

</l>
<l>I gotta find my baby, 'cause I don't want nobody else



</l>
<l>Well now I love that woman so much

</l>
<l>She got me on the run

</l>
<l>She got the keys to my car

</l>
<l>She got my great big mansion



</l>
<l>She got me walkin', I'm talkin' all to my lonely self

</l>
<l>I gotta find my baby, 'cause just don't want nobody else</l></lyrics></xml>
