<lyrics>



Well but I got somethin' to tell ya black gal

Black gal, that ya oughta know

I can get me a woman, black gal

Most ev'rywhere I go



But Lord knows I'm-a wild 'bout you black gal

I'm just as crazy as I can be

Lord knows I'm wild about you black gal

You ought to be a fool about me



Well now, look-a-here black gal

Black gal, you oughta be ashamed

The way that my baby brother know you, black gal

He's scared to call your name



And my brother says he's wild about you black gal

He's just as crazy as he can be

My brother says he's wild about you black gal

You oughta be a fool about him



Well now, here is my picture black gal

I want you to keep it in your frame

Now this other boy, for days is all you been lookin' at

Sonny wants just the same



And Lord knows I been worried about you black gal

I be as crazy as I can be

Now I be thinkin' 'bout you black gal

I hope you be kinda worried about me



Now fare you well, black gal

I ain't got no mo' to sing

There's mister so an so taken my kingdom

I want you to have your way



Lord knows, I'm wild about you black gal

I'm just a crazy as I can be

You know I'm wild about you black gal

You ought to be a fool about me
