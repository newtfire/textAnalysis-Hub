<l>I'm goin' to Kansas City, Kansas City, here I come

</l>
<l>Yes, goin' to Kansas City, Kansas City, here I come

</l>
<l>They got a crazy way a-lovin' an' a I wanna get me some



</l>
<l>I was standing on the corner, of 12th Street and Vine

</l>
<l>Yeah, standing on the corner, of 12th Street and Vine

</l>
<l>With my Kansas City woman an a bottle of Kansas City wine



</l>
<l>Well I might take a plane, I might take a train

</l>
<l>If I have to walk, I'm going there just the same

</l>
<l>I'm going to, Kansas City, Kansas City, here I come

</l>
<l>They got a crazy way a-lovin' an I wanna get me some

</l>
<l>Oh yeah



</l>
<l>Keep your hands off of her, don't belong to you

</l>
<l>Keep your hands off of her, don't belong to you

</l>
<l>She's mine all mine, no matter what she do



</l>
<l>Well I might take a plane, I might take a train

</l>
<l>If I have to walk, I'm goin' there just the same



</l>
<l>I'm goin' to Kansas City, Kansas City, here I come

</l>
<l>They got a crazy way a-lovin' an I wanna get me some

</l>
<l>They got a crazy way a-lovin' an I wanna get me some

</l>
<l>They got a crazy way a-lovin' an I wanna get me some!

</l>
