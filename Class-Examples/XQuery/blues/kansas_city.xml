<lyrics>



I'm goin' to Kansas City, Kansas City, here I come

Yes, goin' to Kansas City, Kansas City, here I come

They got a crazy way a-lovin' an' a I wanna get me some



I was standing on the corner, of 12th Street and Vine

Yeah, standing on the corner, of 12th Street and Vine

With my Kansas City woman an a bottle of Kansas City wine



Well I might take a plane, I might take a train

If I have to walk, I'm going there just the same

I'm going to, Kansas City, Kansas City, here I come

They got a crazy way a-lovin' an I wanna get me some

Oh yeah



Keep your hands off of her, don't belong to you

Keep your hands off of her, don't belong to you

She's mine all mine, no matter what she do



Well I might take a plane, I might take a train

If I have to walk, I'm goin' there just the same



I'm goin' to Kansas City, Kansas City, here I come

They got a crazy way a-lovin' an I wanna get me some

They got a crazy way a-lovin' an I wanna get me some

They got a crazy way a-lovin' an I wanna get me some!

Yeah!
