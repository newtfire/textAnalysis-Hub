<lyrics>



Here she come, yeah, with that head rag on

There she go, yeah, with that head rag on

Here she come, with that head rag on



If you're walkin' down the street, wavin', ev'rybody see me

Sayin' "hello there", walkin' in her stockin' feet

Here she comes (ooo), with that head rag on



Stayin' out all night long



Talkin' 'bout anything



Doin' ev'rything wrong, girl, oh oh



Here she come, yeah, that head rag on

There she goes, yeah yeah, with her head rag on

Here she come, with that head rag on



Eeow!
