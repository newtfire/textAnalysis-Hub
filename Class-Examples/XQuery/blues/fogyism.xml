<lyrics>



Why do people believe in some old sign?

Why do people believe in some old sign?

To hear a hoot owl holler, someone is surely dyin'



Some will break a mirror, cry bad luck for seven years

Some will break a mirror, cry bad luck for seven years

And if a black cat crosses them, they'll break right down in
tears



To dream of muddy water, trouble is knockin' at your door

To dream of muddy water, trouble is knockin' at your door

Your man is sure to leave you, and never return no more



When your man come home evil, tell you you are getting old

When your man come home evil, tell you you are getting old

That's a true sign he's got someone else 
bakin'
his jelly roll



__________

Note: foyism, fogy, a person with old-fashioned ideas.
