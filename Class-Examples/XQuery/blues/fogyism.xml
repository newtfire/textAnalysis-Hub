<l>Why do people believe in some old sign?

</l>
<l>Why do people believe in some old sign?

</l>
<l>To hear a hoot owl holler, someone is surely dyin'



</l>
<l>Some will break a mirror, cry bad luck for seven years

</l>
<l>Some will break a mirror, cry bad luck for seven years

</l>
<l>And if a black cat crosses them, they'll break right down in

tears




</l>
<l>To dream of muddy water, trouble is knockin' at your door

</l>
<l>To dream of muddy water, trouble is knockin' at your door

</l>
<l>Your man is sure to leave you, and never return no more



</l>
<l>When your man come home evil, tell you you are getting old

</l>
<l>When your man come home evil, tell you you are getting old

</l>
<l>That's a true sign he's got someone else 

bakin'
his jelly roll




</l>
