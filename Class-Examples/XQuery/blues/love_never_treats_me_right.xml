<lyrics>



Have you ever said now he's the one?

I'm gonna love this man until I'm ninety-one

Oo-ee baby love is out of sight

I said love just never treats me right



I'll love this man until I'm ninety-two

but oh lord what's a girl to do?

I love this man with all my might

but love just never treats me right



I love this man with all my heart and soul

I love this man from head to toe

well I love this man with all my might

Why won't love ever treat me right?



I'll love this man until I'm ninety-three

but oh lord he's done some hurtin' on me

Me and my baby we fuss and fight

I said why won't love ever treat me right?

I said why won't love ever treat me right?

Why won't love ever treat me right?
