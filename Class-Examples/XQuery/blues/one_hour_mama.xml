<lyrics>


<l>I've always heard that haste makes waste

</l>
<l>So I believe in takin' my time

</l>
<l>The highest mountain can't be raced

</l>
<l>It's something you must slowly climb

</l>
<l>I want a slow and easy man

</l>
<l>He needn't ever take the lead

</l>
<l>'Cause I work on that longtime plan

</l>
<l>And I ain't a-lookin' for no speed



</l>
<l>I'm a one hour mama

</l>
<l>So no one minute papa

</l>
<l>Ain't the kind of man for me

</l>
<l>Set your alarm clock papa

</l>
<l>One hour, that's proper

</l>
<l>Then love me like I like to be



</l>
<l>I don't want no lame excuses

</l>
<l>'Bout my lovin' bein' so good

</l>
<l>That you couldn't wait no longer

</l>
<l>Now I hope I'm understood



</l>
<l>I'm a one hour mama

</l>
<l>So no one minute papa

</l>
<l>Ain't the kind of man for me



</l>
<l>I can't stand no greenhorn lover

</l>
<l>Like a rookie goin' to war

</l>
<l>With a load of big artillery

</l>
<l>But don't know what it's for



</l>
<l>He's got to bring me a reference

</l>
<l>With a great long pedigree

</l>
<l>And must prove he's got endurance

</l>
<l>Or he don't mean that to me



</l>
<l>I don't like no crowin' rooster

</l>
<l>What just kicks a lick or two

</l>
<l>Action is the only booster

</l>
<l>Of just what my man can do



</l>
<l>I don't want no imitation

</l>
<l>My requirements ain't no joke

</l>
<l>Cause I've got pure indignation

</l>
<l>For a guy what's lost his stroke



</l>
<l>I'm a one hour mama

</l>
<l>So no one minute papa

</l>
<l>Ain't the kind of man for me

</l>
<l>Set your alarm clock papa

</l>
<l>One hour, that's proper

</l>
<l>Then love me like I like to be



</l>
<l>I may want love for one hour

</l>
<l>Then decide to make it two

</l>
<l>Takes an hour before I get started

</l>
<l>Maybe three 'fore I'm through



</l>
<l>I'm a one hour mama

</l>
<l>So no one minute papa

</l>
<l>Ain't the kind of man for me</l></lyrics></xml>
