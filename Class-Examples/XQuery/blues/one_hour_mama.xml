<lyrics>



I've always heard that haste makes waste

So I believe in takin' my time

The highest mountain can't be raced

It's something you must slowly climb

I want a slow and easy man

He needn't ever take the lead

'Cause I work on that longtime plan

And I ain't a-lookin' for no speed



I'm a one hour mama

So no one minute papa

Ain't the kind of man for me

Set your alarm clock papa

One hour, that's proper

Then love me like I like to be



I don't want no lame excuses

'Bout my lovin' bein' so good

That you couldn't wait no longer

Now I hope I'm understood



I'm a one hour mama

So no one minute papa

Ain't the kind of man for me



I can't stand no greenhorn lover

Like a rookie goin' to war

With a load of big artillery

But don't know what it's for



He's got to bring me a reference

With a great long pedigree

And must prove he's got endurance

Or he don't mean that to me



I don't like no crowin' rooster

What just kicks a lick or two

Action is the only booster

Of just what my man can do



I don't want no imitation

My requirements ain't no joke

Cause I've got pure indignation

For a guy what's lost his stroke



I'm a one hour mama

So no one minute papa

Ain't the kind of man for me

Set your alarm clock papa

One hour, that's proper

Then love me like I like to be



I may want love for one hour

Then decide to make it two

Takes an hour before I get started

Maybe three 'fore I'm through



I'm a one hour mama

So no one minute papa

Ain't the kind of man for me
