<lyrics>



Just my color, oooh you're just my kind

Well you're just my color, ooh you're just my kind

Well you keep me worried darlin', bothered all the time



Well I told my baby, cried all night long

I told my baby now, cried all night long

Well you just my color darlin', you just my kind



Well I wrung my hands, cried all night long

I wrung my hands, cried all night long

Well you just my color darlin', you done me wrong
