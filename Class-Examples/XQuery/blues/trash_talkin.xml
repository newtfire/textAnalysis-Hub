<lyrics>



(All spoken)



Went down to Albert's Alley

Pick up on me a Collins mix

Went to the bar an' ordered me a drink

Tried to relax myself



Looked around and saw two soul sisters

They were sippin' sodas

And the other look caught their companions

On the dance floor

They were doin' the Collin's shuffle



Pretty soon a cute little number

Came and asked me to do the stomp polka

I told her I couldn't do the stomp polka

I could show her how to do the Sissy
1



We were on the dance floor

And I was doin' my thing

After a while out of nowhere

Up walks her boyfriend

While she's standin' there doin' the shivers and shake



He gave me a look that was very icy blue

And believe me, he made me thaw out!

I said to myself, "Albert, don't lose your cool"



By that time I'd gotten hungry

'Cause I smelled someone cookin' catfish

Oughta be something along, with some greens

Told him definitely, I didn't want no leftovers!



The cook took so long about fixin' my grub

I had to go see what was takin' him so long

He was back there 
jivin'

I had to tell him to get it together



He asked me, "Can't you wait?"

Made me mad, I said, "No man, I ain't got time,

I've got to keep on pushin',

I got to make it down the soul road,

Got to go, do some turnin' on"



Don't want person, give me no dyin' food

So I'm leavin' town, goin' home

I've got homesick anyway

I'm leavin' this place before I freeze

Goin' home to defrost

Ain't gonna have me lookin' like a snow cone



I don't know, he's gettin' rough!
