<lyrics>

<l>(All spoken)



</l>
<l>Went down to Albert's Alley

</l>
<l>Pick up on me a Collins mix

</l>
<l>Went to the bar an' ordered me a drink

</l>
<l>Tried to relax myself



</l>
<l>Looked around and saw two soul sisters

</l>
<l>They were sippin' sodas

</l>
<l>And the other look caught their companions

</l>
<l>On the dance floor

</l>
<l>They were doin' the Collin's shuffle



</l>
<l>Pretty soon a cute little number

</l>
<l>Came and asked me to do the stomp polka

</l>
<l>I told her I couldn't do the stomp polka

</l>
<l>I could show her how to do the Sissy
1



</l>
<l>We were on the dance floor

</l>
<l>And I was doin' my thing

</l>
<l>After a while out of nowhere

</l>
<l>Up walks her boyfriend

</l>
<l>While she's standin' there doin' the shivers and shake



</l>
<l>He gave me a look that was very icy blue

</l>
<l>And believe me, he made me thaw out!

</l>
<l>I said to myself, "Albert, don't lose your cool"



</l>
<l>By that time I'd gotten hungry

</l>
<l>'Cause I smelled someone cookin' catfish

</l>
<l>Oughta be something along, with some greens

</l>
<l>Told him definitely, I didn't want no leftovers!



</l>
<l>The cook took so long about fixin' my grub

</l>
<l>I had to go see what was takin' him so long

</l>
<l>He was back there 
jivin'

</l>
<l>I had to tell him to get it together



</l>
<l>He asked me, "Can't you wait?"

</l>
<l>Made me mad, I said, "No man, I ain't got time,

</l>
<l>I've got to keep on pushin',

</l>
<l>I got to make it down the soul road,

</l>
<l>Got to go, do some turnin' on"



</l>
<l>Don't want person, give me no dyin' food

</l>
<l>So I'm leavin' town, goin' home

</l>
<l>I've got homesick anyway

</l>
<l>I'm leavin' this place before I freeze

</l>
<l>Goin' home to defrost

</l>
<l>Ain't gonna have me lookin' like a snow cone



</l>
<l>I don't know, he's gettin' rough!
