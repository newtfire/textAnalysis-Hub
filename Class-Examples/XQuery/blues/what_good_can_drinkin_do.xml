<l>What good can drinkin' do, what good can drinkin' do?

</l>
<l>Lord, I drink all night but the next day I still feel blue



</l>
<l>There's a glass on the table, they say it's gonna ease all my
pain,

</l>
<l>And there's a glass on the table, they say it's gonna ease all my
pain

</l>
<l>But I drink it down, an' the next day I feel the same



</l>
<l>Gimme whiskey, gimme bourbon, give me gin

</l>
<l>Oh, gimme whiskey, give me bourbon, gimme gin

</l>
<l>'Cause it don't matter what I'm drinkin', Lord, as long as it drown

this sorrow I'm in




</l>
<l>I start drinking Friday, I start drinking Friday night

</l>
<l>Lord, I start drinking Friday, start drinking Friday night

</l>
<l>But then I wake up on Sunday, child, there ain't nothin' that's

right




</l>
<l>My man he left me, child, he left me here

</l>
<l>Yeah, my good man left me, went away and left me here

</l>
<l>Lord, I'm feelin' lowdown, just give me another glass of beer



</l>
<l>What good can drinkin' do, what good can drinkin' do?

</l>
<l>Well, I drink all night but the next day I still feel blue!</l></lyrics></xml>
