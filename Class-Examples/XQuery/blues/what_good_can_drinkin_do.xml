<lyrics>



What good can drinkin' do, what good can drinkin' do?

Lord, I drink all night but the next day I still feel blue



There's a glass on the table, they say it's gonna ease all my
pain,

And there's a glass on the table, they say it's gonna ease all my
pain

But I drink it down, an' the next day I feel the same



Gimme whiskey, gimme bourbon, give me gin

Oh, gimme whiskey, give me bourbon, gimme gin

'Cause it don't matter what I'm drinkin', Lord, as long as it drown
this sorrow I'm in



I start drinking Friday, I start drinking Friday night

Lord, I start drinking Friday, start drinking Friday night

But then I wake up on Sunday, child, there ain't nothin' that's
right



My man he left me, child, he left me here

Yeah, my good man left me, went away and left me here

Lord, I'm feelin' lowdown, just give me another glass of beer



What good can drinkin' do, what good can drinkin' do?

Well, I drink all night but the next day I still feel blue!
