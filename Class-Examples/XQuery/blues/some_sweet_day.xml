<lyrics>



Well the blues is on me now

I'll feel better, when I leave your town

But some sweet day, you're gonna be sorry

That you throwed me down



I got my suitcase already packed

Yes my trunk is on the road

Don't worry baby, you won't see my smilin' face no more



You're so mean and you're so evil

You got me runnin', runnin' from door to door

But some sweet day, you gonna be sorry

Babe, that you let me go



Now get it together, boys!



Yeah-hey-yeah



I'm blue and I'm disgusted

And I don't know just what to do

Some sweet day, your luck will change

Baby, you will be blue too
