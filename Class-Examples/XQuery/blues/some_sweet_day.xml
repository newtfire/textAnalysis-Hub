<lyrics>


<l>Well the blues is on me now

</l>
<l>I'll feel better, when I leave your town

</l>
<l>But some sweet day, you're gonna be sorry

</l>
<l>That you throwed me down



</l>
<l>I got my suitcase already packed

</l>
<l>Yes my trunk is on the road

</l>
<l>Don't worry baby, you won't see my smilin' face no more



</l>
<l>You're so mean and you're so evil

</l>
<l>You got me runnin', runnin' from door to door

</l>
<l>But some sweet day, you gonna be sorry

</l>
<l>Babe, that you let me go



</l>
<l>Now get it together, boys!



</l>
<l>Yeah-hey-yeah



</l>
<l>I'm blue and I'm disgusted

</l>
<l>And I don't know just what to do

</l>
<l>Some sweet day, your luck will change

</l>
<l>Baby, you will be blue too</l></lyrics></xml>
