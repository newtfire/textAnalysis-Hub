<lyrics>



Yeah, here I stand before you with my heart in my hand

I want you to great it baby, hopin' that you'll understand

I said baby, honey please don't dog me around

Because I'd rather love you woman, honey than anyone else I know in
town



Because you're so nice and lovely and you have such pleasant ways

If you take to your heart I'll be there the rest of my days

I said baby, that's the truth

Honey, I declare I wouldn't lie

Because I gotta love you baby

If I don't, I swear I hope I die



Oh baby, don't you want a man like me?

Can you hear me woman, don't you want a man like me?

You gotta think, you gotta think about our future, baby

And you forget about your used to be



Well, my days are long and dreary

and the sun refuse to shine

I will never be blue and lonely

only if I knew where you are

I got the blues baby

You can make everything alright

Can I see you today baby

Or will it have to be tomorrow night



Yes, this is still my confession baby

And I'm thrilled by all your charms

It seems that I'm in heaven when I hold you in my arms

Baby, woman you can have me for yourself

You know I was meant for you baby

And I don't want nobody else, no I don't



Hey, you told me that you love me, woman, you meant it from the
start

You said that we would be together until death do us part

But you lied to me baby, yes and you called it on the phone

Now how can I be happy woman, with all the wrong you done



When you know just where I stand

I don't wanna lose you woman, wanna keep you if I can

But baby, baby you know I never had a friend

You're my one and only woman, you're all I have that stays

Now let me come in here
