<lyrics>



Standin' in the rain and ain't a drop fell on me

Standin' in the rain and ain't a drop fell on me

My clothes is all wet but my flesh is as dry as can be



It can rain all day, I ain't got no place to go

It can rain all day, I ain't got no place to go

Because it's cold outside in that ice and snow



If it rains five days that won't give me no blues

If it rains five days that won't give me no blues

I've got my raincoat and hat, umbrella, boots and shoes



Rain, rain, rain don't rain on me all day

Rain, rain, rain don't rain on me all day

'Cause if I get too wet I've got to go into the house and stay
