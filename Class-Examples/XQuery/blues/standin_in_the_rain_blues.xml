<l>Standin' in the rain and ain't a drop fell on me

</l>
<l>Standin' in the rain and ain't a drop fell on me

</l>
<l>My clothes is all wet but my flesh is as dry as can be



</l>
<l>It can rain all day, I ain't got no place to go

</l>
<l>It can rain all day, I ain't got no place to go

</l>
<l>Because it's cold outside in that ice and snow



</l>
<l>If it rains five days that won't give me no blues

</l>
<l>If it rains five days that won't give me no blues

</l>
<l>I've got my raincoat and hat, umbrella, boots and shoes



</l>
<l>Rain, rain, rain don't rain on me all day

</l>
<l>Rain, rain, rain don't rain on me all day

</l>
<l>'Cause if I get too wet I've got to go into the house and stay</l></lyrics></xml>
