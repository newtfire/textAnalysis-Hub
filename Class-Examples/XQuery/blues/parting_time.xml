Baby, if you can't do no better, I think I'd better get me a woman
that can

Well, if you can't do no better, woman, I think I'd better get me a
babe that can

Yes, you're goin' around cheatin' and lyin', you ain't doin' nothin'
but losin' a good man



Well, life is too short to be worryin', woman, babe and you're old
enough to understand

Yes, life is too short to be worryin', woman, and you're old enough
to understand

Baby, if you can't do no better, baby, I think I'd better get me a
woman that can



Oh, if I never said hello to you, woman. than I wouldn't be sayin'
goodbye

Oh, I've got my bags already packed. woman, I'm so hurt I wanna
cry

Yes, what makes, what makes you treat me like you do, baby?

Yes, I wanna know, tell me why
