that can

</l>

babe that can

</l>
<l>Yes, you're goin' around cheatin' and lyin', you ain't doin' nothin'

but losin' a good man




</l>
<l>Well, life is too short to be worryin', woman, babe and you're old
enough to understand

</l>
<l>Yes, life is too short to be worryin', woman, and you're old enough
to understand

</l>

woman that can




</l>
<l>Oh, if I never said hello to you, woman. than I wouldn't be sayin'
