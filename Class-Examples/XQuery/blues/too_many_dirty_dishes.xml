Too many dirty dishes in the sink for just us two

I said, too many dirty dishes in the sink for just us two

You got me wonderin' baby

Who's makin' dirty dishes with you?



I get up an' go to work in the mo'nin'

I come right home at night

When I leave the sink is empty

When I come back home

She got 'em stacked up out of sight



Too many dirty dishes in the sink just for us two

Well you got me wonderin' baby,

Who's makin' dirty dishes with you?



(Spoken:

Look at this kitchen!

Pots an' pans, ev'rywhere, it's pitiful!

Look at all these glasses layin' all up on the sink!

Looks like she even had a party up in here, too

You wait 'til I see this woman, when she get home



That glass over there, got a cigar in it or sump'in

I don't smoke no cigar

Um, servin' caviar

I don't eat no caviar

What's wrong with this woman?

All these pots in here, gonna run me some water right here



Yeah now, you wait 'til I see this woman when she get home

Pots 'n pans all stacked up here

There's a pot, let me scrap this pot out



Oh it's pitiful an' I don't know why this woman come an' have a
party

When I'm at work



Gettin' all this stuff under my fingernails,

Run some more water in here

Yeah, now I can wash these glasses out, wash them up first



Yeah, that's pretty clean now, though

Now I got all this, now I gotta work on these pots a little bit
more

Makes me so mad, I don't know what to do



Thought I was her husband, 'stead a maid!



Like ol red chili or somethin' all done got dried up on all these
pots



She never fix me none of this good food!



You wait 'til that woman get home, I'm scrappin' all these pots for
her)



Sings:

I've done your dirty dishes

How much am I suppose to take?

When I left I had corn flakes for breakfast

Now there's a bone from a T-bone steak



Too many dirty dishes in the sink for just us two

You've got me wonderin' baby

Who in the hell is makin' dirty dishes with you?
