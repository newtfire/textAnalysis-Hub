<lyrics>


<l>I'm a road runner honey beep beep!

</l>
<l>I'm a road runner honey, and you can't keep up with me

</l>
<l>I'm a road runner honey, and you can't keep up with me

</l>
<l>Come on, let's race, baby baby, you will see

</l>
<l>Here I come, beep beep!



</l>
<l>Move over honey, let me by

</l>
<l>Move over baby, let this man by

</l>
<l>I'm gonna show you baby, look out your head

</l>
<l>Gonna put some dirt in your eye

</l>
<l>Here I go!

</l>
<l>Oh yeah, how am I doin'?

</l>
<l>Beep beep!



</l>
<l>Take my hand baby,

</l>
<l>I'm gonna prove to you that I'm a road running man

</l>
<l>I wanna show you something,

</l>
<l>that I'm the fastest in the land

</l>
<l>Now let me by

</l>
<l>Beep! Beep!



</l>
<l>Oh yeah, you said you's fast,

</l>
<l>but it don't look like you gonna last

</l>
<l>Goodbye! I've got to put you down

</l>
<l>I'll see you some day,

</l>
<l>baby, somewhere hangin' around</l></lyrics></xml>
