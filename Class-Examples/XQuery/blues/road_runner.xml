<lyrics>



I'm a road runner honey beep beep!

I'm a road runner honey, and you can't keep up with me

I'm a road runner honey, and you can't keep up with me

Come on, let's race, baby baby, you will see

Here I come, beep beep!



Move over honey, let me by

Move over baby, let this man by

I'm gonna show you baby, look out your head

Gonna put some dirt in your eye

Here I go!

Oh yeah, how am I doin'?

Beep beep!



Take my hand baby,

I'm gonna prove to you that I'm a road running man

I wanna show you something,

that I'm the fastest in the land

Now let me by

Beep! Beep!



Oh yeah, you said you's fast,

but it don't look like you gonna last

Goodbye! I've got to put you down

I'll see you some day,

baby, somewhere hangin' around
