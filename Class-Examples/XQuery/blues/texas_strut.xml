<lyrics>



One, two, three, four

Let me tell you about the Texas blues



I went down south to Dallas, to hear those cowboys wail

Came across that Billy Gibbons, ridin' on that ZZ trail



I just can't lose with the Texas blues

I said I just can't lose with the Texas blues

The Texas blues



Got myself in Double Trouble, when I saw that Texas Flood

Stevie said The Sky Is Crying, superstition's in his blood



I just can't lose with the Texas blues

I said I just can't lose with the Texas blues

The Texas blues

How-how-how-how



Come on!



I heard that Houston Twister, he could run you off the tracks

When he plays that Cold Cold Feeling, you get the shivers down your
back



I just can't lose with the Texas blues

I said I just can't lose with the Texas blues

The Texas blues

A-how-how-how-how



Well, I'm going back to Dallas. won't go waitin' for no bus

Ridin' off into the sunset, you won't see my heels for dust



I just can't lose with the Texas blues

I said I just can't lose with the Texas blues

I said I just can't lose with the Texas blues

And I just can't lose with the Texas blues

The Texas blues

Texas blues

A-how-how-how-how

A-how-how-how-how
