<lyrics>


<l>One, two, three, four

</l>
<l>Let me tell you about the Texas blues



</l>
<l>I went down south to Dallas, to hear those cowboys wail

</l>
<l>Came across that Billy Gibbons, ridin' on that ZZ trail



</l>
<l>I just can't lose with the Texas blues

</l>
<l>I said I just can't lose with the Texas blues

</l>
<l>The Texas blues



</l>
<l>Got myself in Double Trouble, when I saw that Texas Flood

</l>
<l>Stevie said The Sky Is Crying, superstition's in his blood



</l>
<l>I just can't lose with the Texas blues

</l>
<l>I said I just can't lose with the Texas blues

</l>
<l>The Texas blues

</l>
<l>How-how-how-how



</l>
<l>Come on!



</l>
<l>I heard that Houston Twister, he could run you off the tracks

</l>
<l>When he plays that Cold Cold Feeling, you get the shivers down your

back




</l>
<l>I just can't lose with the Texas blues

</l>
<l>I said I just can't lose with the Texas blues

</l>
<l>The Texas blues

</l>
<l>A-how-how-how-how



</l>
<l>Well, I'm going back to Dallas. won't go waitin' for no bus

</l>
<l>Ridin' off into the sunset, you won't see my heels for dust



</l>
<l>I just can't lose with the Texas blues

</l>
<l>I said I just can't lose with the Texas blues

</l>
<l>I said I just can't lose with the Texas blues

</l>
<l>And I just can't lose with the Texas blues

</l>
<l>The Texas blues

</l>
<l>Texas blues

</l>
<l>A-how-how-how-how

</l>
<l>A-how-how-how-how</l></lyrics></xml>
