<lyrics>


<l>I'm got to change my way of livin', this life I'm livin' ain't
no good

</l>
<l>I'm got to change my way of livin', this life I'm livin' ain't no
good

</l>
<l>I leave home in the morning, don't come back 'til the break of

dawn




</l>
<l>My baby said that ain't right, I'll admit that is true

</l>
<l>My baby said that ain't right, I'll admit that is true

</l>
<l>She said daddy, daddy, you got to change the way you do



</l>
<l>You know I leave in the mornin', and I don't come back 'til dawn

</l>
<l>You know I leaves in the mornin', and I don't come back 'til dawn

</l><l>My baby looked me in the eyes, and said daddy, you got to change your</l>
<l>evil way</l></lyrics></xml>
