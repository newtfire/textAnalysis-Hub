<lyrics>



I'm got to change my way of livin', this life I'm livin' ain't
no good

I'm got to change my way of livin', this life I'm livin' ain't no
good

I leave home in the morning, don't come back 'til the break of
dawn



My baby said that ain't right, I'll admit that is true

My baby said that ain't right, I'll admit that is true

She said daddy, daddy, you got to change the way you do



You know I leave in the mornin', and I don't come back 'til dawn

You know I leaves in the mornin', and I don't come back 'til dawn

My baby looked me in the eyes, and said daddy, you got to change your
evil way
