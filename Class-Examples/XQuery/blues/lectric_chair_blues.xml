<lyrics>



I want to shake hands with my partner and ask him how come he's
here

I want to shake hands with my partner, ask him how come he's here

I had a wreck with my family, they're gonna send me to the electric
chair



I wonder why they electrocute a man at the one o'clock hour of
night

And I wonder why they electrocute a man at the one o'clock hour of
night

Because the current is much stronger, when the folks has turned out
all the lights



I sat in the electrocutin' room, my arms folded up and cryin'

I sat in the electrocutin' room, my arms folded up and cryin'

And my baby asked the question, was they gonna electrocute that man
of mine?



Lemon, get me a taxi to take me away from here

Lemon, get me a taxi to take me all away from here

I haven't had a good friend in this world, since they lead Lemon to
the electric chair



I feel like jumpin' in the ocean, I feel like jumpin' in the deep
blue sea

I feel like jumpin' in the ocean, and like jumpin' into the deep blue
sea

But nothin' like that wrecked in my heart when they brought my
electrocuted daddy to me
