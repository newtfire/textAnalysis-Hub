<lyrics>


<l>I want to shake hands with my partner and ask him how come he's
here

</l>
<l>I want to shake hands with my partner, ask him how come he's here

</l>
<l>I had a wreck with my family, they're gonna send me to the electric

chair




</l>
<l>I wonder why they electrocute a man at the one o'clock hour of
night

</l>
<l>And I wonder why they electrocute a man at the one o'clock hour of
night

</l>
<l>Because the current is much stronger, when the folks has turned out

all the lights




</l>
<l>I sat in the electrocutin' room, my arms folded up and cryin'

</l>
<l>I sat in the electrocutin' room, my arms folded up and cryin'

</l>
<l>And my baby asked the question, was they gonna electrocute that man

of mine?




</l>
<l>Lemon, get me a taxi to take me away from here

</l>
<l>Lemon, get me a taxi to take me all away from here

</l>
<l>I haven't had a good friend in this world, since they lead Lemon to

the electric chair




</l>
<l>I feel like jumpin' in the ocean, I feel like jumpin' in the deep
blue sea

</l>
<l>I feel like jumpin' in the ocean, and like jumpin' into the deep blue
sea

</l>
<l>But nothin' like that wrecked in my heart when they brought my

electrocuted daddy to me
