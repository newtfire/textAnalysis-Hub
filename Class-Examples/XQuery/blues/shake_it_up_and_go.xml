<lyrics>



You might be old, about 90 years

But you ain't too old to shift them gears

You can shake it up and go (Shake it up and go)

Shake it up and go (Shake it up and go)

You good-looking people sure can shake it up and go



Mama killed a chicken, she thought it was a duck

She put it on the table with his legs sticking up

She had to shake it up and go (Shake it up and go)

Shake it up and go (Shake it up and go)

You good-looking people sure got to shake it up and go



I told my baby the week before last

The gait she had was just a little too fast

She had to shake it up and go (Shake it up and go)

Shake it up and go (Shake it up and go)

You good-looking people sure got to shake it up and go



Look here baby, you ain't treating me right

You go out everyday, stay out late at night

You got to shake it up and go, baby (Shake it up and go)

You got to shake it up and go (Shake it up and go)

You good-looking people sure got to shake it up and go
