<lyrics>


<l>Don't ever trust a woman, until she's dead and buried

</l>
<l>Yes, don't ever trust a woman, until she's dead and buried

</l>
<l>One day she'll say that she loves you and the next day she'll throw

you in the street




</l>
<l>She'll smother you with kisses, when her birthday comes around

</l>
<l>But soon as she gets her presents, she'll down talk you all over over
town

</l>
<l>No, don't ever trust a woman, until she's dead and buried

</l>
<l>One day she'll say that she loves you and the next day she'll throw

you in the street




</l>
<l>She'll beg you for clothes and diamonds, until you're all in hock

</l>
<l>And then you'll come home one mornin' and your key won't fit the
lock

</l>
<l>Don't ever trust a woman, until she's dead and buried

</l>
<l>Well, one day she'll say that she loves you, the next day she'll

throw you in the street




</l>
<l>She'll call you every mornin', every mornin', noon and night

</l>
<l>She'll call you in between times, just to see if you're doin'
alright

</l>
<l>She'll ask to borrow five and then she'll beg for ten

</l>
<l>And baby that five and ten, you won't ever see again!



</l>
<l>Man, don't ever trust a woman, man, until she's dead and buried

</l><l>One day she'll say that she loves you and the next day she'll throw</l>
<l>you in the street</l></lyrics></xml>
