<lyrics>



Don't ever trust a woman, until she's dead and buried

Yes, don't ever trust a woman, until she's dead and buried

One day she'll say that she loves you and the next day she'll throw
you in the street



She'll smother you with kisses, when her birthday comes around

But soon as she gets her presents, she'll down talk you all over over
town

No, don't ever trust a woman, until she's dead and buried

One day she'll say that she loves you and the next day she'll throw
you in the street



She'll beg you for clothes and diamonds, until you're all in hock

And then you'll come home one mornin' and your key won't fit the
lock

Don't ever trust a woman, until she's dead and buried

Well, one day she'll say that she loves you, the next day she'll
throw you in the street



She'll call you every mornin', every mornin', noon and night

She'll call you in between times, just to see if you're doin'
alright

She'll ask to borrow five and then she'll beg for ten

And baby that five and ten, you won't ever see again!



Man, don't ever trust a woman, man, until she's dead and buried

One day she'll say that she loves you and the next day she'll throw
you in the street
