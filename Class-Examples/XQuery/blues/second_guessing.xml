<lyrics>


<l>Second guessin' first impressions,

there you go again
Rushing off in all directions,
since I don't know when
All day long you're building walls,
you're building walls all day
Putting ceilings on your feelings,
when they should fly away


</l>
<l>Don't you think it's time you quit it

Don't you think it's time you admit it
Your heart is more worthy of trust,
than the thoughts in your mind that sit there gathering dust


</l>
<l>Everything you're looking for,

you'll know when it's real
You'll know when you've found it,
by the way you feel


</l>
<l>Writing down your deepest emotions,

with your pen in hand
Your piece of paper flew out the window,
you watched it try and land
You felt bad as it flew out of sight,
a part of your heart alone in the night
All of a sudden you didn't mind it,
when you pictured that lonely stranger that would find it


</l><l>Everything you're looking for,</l>
<l>you'll know when it's real</l>
<l>You'll know when you've found it,</l>
<l>by the way you feel</l></lyrics></xml>
