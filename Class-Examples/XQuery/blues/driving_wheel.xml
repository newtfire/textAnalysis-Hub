<lyrics>

               
 Well, my baby don't have to work
 And she don't have to rob and
               steal
 Well, my baby don't have to work
 And she don't have to rob
               and steal
 Yes, I'll give her everything she needs
 'Cause I am
               her driving wheel

               
 Yes, she left me this morning
 And she said she'd be back
               soon
 Yes, she left me this morning
 And she said she'd be back
               soon
 Yes, she would be back early Friday mornin'
 Or laid over
               Saturday afternoon

               
 Yes, every time she walk
 She shake like a leaf tremblin' on a
               tree
 Yes, when my baby walk down the street
 She shake like a
               leaf tremblin' on a tree
 Yes, the women all hate her
 But man,
               she's alright with me

               
 Whoah, I sent the U.N. a telegram
 Don't want nobody else to
               break the seal
 Whoah, I sent the U.N. a telegram
 Don't want
               nobody else to break the seal
 I want the whole world to know

               That I am my baby's driving wheel
