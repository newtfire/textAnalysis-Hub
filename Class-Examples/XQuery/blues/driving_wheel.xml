<lyrics>

<l>Well, my baby don't have to work</l>
<l> And she don't have to rob and steal
               </l>
<l> Well, my baby don't have to work
And she don't have to rob </l>
<l>               and steal
Yes, I'll give her everything she needs </l>
<l> 'Cause I am her driving wheel
               </l>
<l>Yes, she left me this morning</l>
<l> And she said she'd be back soon
               </l>
<l> Yes, she left me this morning
And she said she'd be back </l>
<l>               soon
Yes, she would be back early Friday mornin' </l>
<l> Or laid over Saturday afternoon
               </l>
<l>Yes, every time she walk</l>
<l> She shake like a leaf tremblin' on a tree
               </l>
<l> Yes, when my baby walk down the street
She shake like a </l>
<l>               leaf tremblin' on a tree
Yes, the women all hate her </l>
<l> But man, she's alright with me
               </l>
<l>Whoah, I sent the U.N. a telegram</l>
<l> Don't want nobody else to break the seal
               </l>
<l> Whoah, I sent the U.N. a telegram
Don't want </l>
<l>               nobody else to break the seal
I want the whole world to know </l>

<l>               That I am my baby's driving wheel</l></lyrics></xml>
