<lyrics>



I'm a drunken hearted man, my life seems so misery

I'm a drunken hearted man, my life seems so misery

And if I could change my way of livin', it would mean so much to
me



I been dogged and I been driven, ever since I left my mother's
home

I been dogged and I been driven, ever since I left my mother's
home

And I can't see the reason why that, I can't leave these no-good
women's alone



My father died and left me, my poor mother done the best that she
could

My father died and left me, my poor mother done the best that she
could

Every man likes that game you call love, but it don't mean no man no
good



Now, I'm the drunken hearted man and sin was the cause of it all

(spoken: Oh, play 'em now)

I'm a drunken hearted man, and sin was the cause of it all

And the day that you get weak for no-good women, that's the day that
you bound to fall
