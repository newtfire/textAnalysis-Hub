<lyrics>


<l>I'm a drunken hearted man, my life seems so misery

</l>
<l>I'm a drunken hearted man, my life seems so misery

</l>
<l>And if I could change my way of livin', it would mean so much to

me




</l>
<l>I been dogged and I been driven, ever since I left my mother's
home

</l>
<l>I been dogged and I been driven, ever since I left my mother's
home

</l>
<l>And I can't see the reason why that, I can't leave these no-good

women's alone




</l>
<l>My father died and left me, my poor mother done the best that she
could

</l>
<l>My father died and left me, my poor mother done the best that she
could

</l>
<l>Every man likes that game you call love, but it don't mean no man no

good




</l>
<l>Now, I'm the drunken hearted man and sin was the cause of it all

</l>
<l>(spoken: Oh, play 'em now)

</l>
<l>I'm a drunken hearted man, and sin was the cause of it all

</l><l>And the day that you get weak for no-good women, that's the day that</l>
<l>you bound to fall</l></lyrics></xml>
