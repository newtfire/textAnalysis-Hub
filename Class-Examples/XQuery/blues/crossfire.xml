<lyrics>



Day by day night after night,

blinded by the neon lights

Hurry here hustlin' there,

no one's got the time to spare

Money's tight nothin' free,

won't somebody come and rescue me

I am stranded, caught in the crossfire

Stranded, caught in the crossfire



Tooth for tooth eye for an eye,

sell your soul just to buy buy buy

Beggin' a dollar stealin' a dime,

come on can't you see that I

I am stranded, caught in the crossfire

I am stranded, caught in the crossfire



I need some kind of kindness,

some kind of sympathy oh no

We're stranded, caught in the crossfire



Save the strong lose the weak,

never turning the other cheek

Trust nobody don't be no fool,

whatever happened to the golden rule

We got stranded, caught in the crossfire

We got stranded, caught in the crossfire

We got stranded, caught in the crossfire

Stranded, caught in the crossfire

Help me
