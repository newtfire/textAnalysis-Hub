<lyrics>


<l>Day by day night after night,

</l>
<l>blinded by the neon lights

</l>
<l>Hurry here hustlin' there,

</l>
<l>no one's got the time to spare

</l>
<l>Money's tight nothin' free,

</l>
<l>won't somebody come and rescue me

</l>
<l>I am stranded, caught in the crossfire

</l>
<l>Stranded, caught in the crossfire



</l>
<l>Tooth for tooth eye for an eye,

</l>
<l>sell your soul just to buy buy buy

</l>
<l>Beggin' a dollar stealin' a dime,

</l>
<l>come on can't you see that I

</l>
<l>I am stranded, caught in the crossfire

</l>
<l>I am stranded, caught in the crossfire



</l>
<l>I need some kind of kindness,

</l>
<l>some kind of sympathy oh no

</l>
<l>We're stranded, caught in the crossfire



</l>
<l>Save the strong lose the weak,

</l>
<l>never turning the other cheek

</l>
<l>Trust nobody don't be no fool,

</l>
<l>whatever happened to the golden rule

</l>
<l>We got stranded, caught in the crossfire

</l>
<l>We got stranded, caught in the crossfire

</l>
<l>We got stranded, caught in the crossfire

</l>
<l>Stranded, caught in the crossfire

</l>
<l>Help me
