<l>Every time I'm walking down the street, some pretty mama start
breakin' down on me

</l>
<l>Stop breaking down, baby please stop breakin' down

</l>
<l>The stuff I got'll bust your brains out baby, ooh, it make you lose

your mind




</l>
<l>I got my baby ninety nine degree, she took my baby throwed a pistol
down on me

</l>
<l>Stop breaking down, baby please stop breaking down

</l>
<l>The stuff I got'll bust your brains out baby, ooh, make you lose your

mind




</l>
<l>I can't stop walkin' down the street, but some pretty mama breakin'
down on me

</l>
<l>Stop breakin' down, baby please stop breakin' down

</l>
<l>Yes, you know the stuff I got'll bust your brains out baby, make you
lose your mind

</l>
<l>Stuff'll bust your brains out baby, make you lose your mind

</l><l>Oh yeah</l></lyrics></xml>
