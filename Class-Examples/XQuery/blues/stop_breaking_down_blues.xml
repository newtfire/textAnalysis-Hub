<lyrics>



Every time I'm walking down the street, some pretty mama start
breakin' down on me

Stop breaking down, baby please stop breakin' down

The stuff I got'll bust your brains out baby, ooh, it make you lose
your mind



I got my baby ninety nine degree, she took my baby throwed a pistol
down on me

Stop breaking down, baby please stop breaking down

The stuff I got'll bust your brains out baby, ooh, make you lose your
mind



I can't stop walkin' down the street, but some pretty mama breakin'
down on me

Stop breakin' down, baby please stop breakin' down

Yes, you know the stuff I got'll bust your brains out baby, make you
lose your mind

Stuff'll bust your brains out baby, make you lose your mind

Oh yeah
