<lyrics>



I'm goin' back to Cane River, down Lou'siana way

I'm goin' back to Cane River, down Lou'siana way

Back to Cane River, that's where I'm gonna stay



I've got a Creole beauty, cute as she can be

She gives me plenty lovin', ev'rything belong to me

I'm goin' back to Cane River, down Lou'siana way

Back to Cane River, that' where I'm gonna stay



She's got chicken in the yard, hogs in the pen

Cows in the pasture, an corn in the bin

I'm goin' back to Cane River, down Lou'siana way

Back to Cane River, that's where I'm gonna stay
