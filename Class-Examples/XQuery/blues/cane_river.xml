<l>I'm goin' back to Cane River, down Lou'siana way

</l>
<l>I'm goin' back to Cane River, down Lou'siana way

</l>
<l>Back to Cane River, that's where I'm gonna stay



</l>
<l>I've got a Creole beauty, cute as she can be

</l>
<l>She gives me plenty lovin', ev'rything belong to me

</l>
<l>I'm goin' back to Cane River, down Lou'siana way

</l>
<l>Back to Cane River, that' where I'm gonna stay



</l>
<l>She's got chicken in the yard, hogs in the pen

</l>
<l>Cows in the pasture, an corn in the bin

</l>
<l>I'm goin' back to Cane River, down Lou'siana way

</l>
<l>Back to Cane River, that's where I'm gonna stay</l></lyrics></xml>
