<lyrics>


<l>There was Adam, happy as a man could be

</l>
<l>Till Eve got him messin' with that old apple tree



</l>
<l>Ain't that just like a woman?

</l>
<l>Ain't that just like a woman?

</l>
<l>Ain't that just like a woman?

</l>
<l>They'll do it every time



</l>
<l>Lot took his wife down to the corner for a malted

</l>
<l>She wouldn't mind her business, boy, did she get salted



</l>
<l>Ain't that just like a woman?

</l>
<l>Ain't that just like a woman?

</l>
<l>Ain't that just like a woman?

</l>
<l>They'll do it every time

</l>
<l>Samson thought Delilah was on the square

</l>
<l>Till one night she clipped him all his hair



</l>
<l>Ain't that just like a woman?

</l>
<l>Ain't that just like a woman?

</l>
<l>Ain't that just like a woman?

</l>
<l>They'll do it every time



</l>
<l>From our history books we all learned

</l>
<l>Nero fiddled while Rome was burned



</l>
<l>Ain't that just like a woman?

</l>
<l>Ain't that just like a woman?

</l>
<l>Ain't that just like a woman?

</l>
<l>They'll do it every time



</l>
<l>Marie Antoinette met some hungry cats at the gate

</l>
<l>They was crying for bread, she said, "Let them eat cake"



</l>
<l>Ain't that just like a woman?

</l>
<l>Ain't that just like a woman?

</l>
<l>Ain't that just like a woman?

</l>
<l>They'll do it every time



</l>
<l>You can buy a woman clothes

</l>
<l>And give her money on the side

</l>
<l>No matter what you do

</l>
<l>She ain't never satisfied

</l>
<l>Ain't that just like a woman?

</l>
<l>Ain't that just like a woman?

</l>
<l>Ain't that just like a woman?

</l><l>They'll do it every time</l></lyrics></xml>
