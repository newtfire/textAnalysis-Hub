<lyrics>



There was Adam, happy as a man could be

Till Eve got him messin' with that old apple tree



Ain't that just like a woman?

Ain't that just like a woman?

Ain't that just like a woman?

They'll do it every time



Lot took his wife down to the corner for a malted

She wouldn't mind her business, boy, did she get salted



Ain't that just like a woman?

Ain't that just like a woman?

Ain't that just like a woman?

They'll do it every time

Samson thought Delilah was on the square

Till one night she clipped him all his hair



Ain't that just like a woman?

Ain't that just like a woman?

Ain't that just like a woman?

They'll do it every time



From our history books we all learned

Nero fiddled while Rome was burned



Ain't that just like a woman?

Ain't that just like a woman?

Ain't that just like a woman?

They'll do it every time



Marie Antoinette met some hungry cats at the gate

They was crying for bread, she said, "Let them eat cake"



Ain't that just like a woman?

Ain't that just like a woman?

Ain't that just like a woman?

They'll do it every time



You can buy a woman clothes

And give her money on the side

No matter what you do

She ain't never satisfied

Ain't that just like a woman?

Ain't that just like a woman?

Ain't that just like a woman?

They'll do it every time
