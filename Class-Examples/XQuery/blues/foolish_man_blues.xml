<lyrics>



Men sure is deceitful and they's gettin' worser ev'ry day

Men sure is deceitful and they's gettin' worser ev'ry day

Act like a bunch of women, they's just-a gab, gab, gabbin' away



There's two things got me puzzled, there's two things I can't
stand

There's two things got me puzzled, there's two things I can't
stand

A mannish actin' woman and a skippin' twistin' woman actin' man



I used to love a man, he always made my poor heart ache

I used to love a man, he always made my poor heart ache

He was crooked as a corkscrew and evil as a copperhead snake



Iknow a certain man who spent a year runnin' a poor gal
down

Iknow a certain man who spent a year runnin' a poor gal
down

And when she let him kiss her, the fool blabbed it all over town
