<lyrics>


<l>Men sure is deceitful and they's gettin' worser ev'ry day

</l>
<l>Men sure is deceitful and they's gettin' worser ev'ry day

</l>
<l>Act like a bunch of women, they's just-a gab, gab, gabbin' away



</l>
<l>There's two things got me puzzled, there's two things I can't
stand

</l>
<l>There's two things got me puzzled, there's two things I can't
stand

</l>
<l>A mannish actin' woman and a skippin' twistin' woman actin' man



</l>
<l>I used to love a man, he always made my poor heart ache

</l>
<l>I used to love a man, he always made my poor heart ache

</l>
<l>He was crooked as a corkscrew and evil as a copperhead snake



</l>
<l>Iknow a certain man who spent a year runnin' a poor gal
down

</l>
<l>Iknow a certain man who spent a year runnin' a poor gal
down

</l>
<l>And when she let him kiss her, the fool blabbed it all over town</l></lyrics></xml>
