<lyrics>


<l>If you love me, baby

</l>
<l>Why don't you write me sometime

</l>
<l>If you, if you love me, baby

</l>
<l>Why don't you let me

</l>
<l>Hear from you sometime

</l>
<l>You don't do nothing

</l>
<l>But keep me worried

</l>
<l>You just keep me worried

</l>
<l>All the time



</l>
<l>You know I think about you, baby

</l>
<l>I think about you

</l>
<l>Every night about this time

</l>
<l>Oh you know, you know

</l>
<l>You know I think about you, baby

</l>
<l>I think about you

</l>
<l>Every night about this time

</l>
<l>It seems like you would treat me

</l>
<l>A little better, baby

</l>
<l>It seems like you would be

</l>
<l>A little nicer and kind



</l>
<l>Let me love you one more time, baby

</l>
<l>Let me love you one more time

</l>
<l>Before you go away

</l>
<l>Let me, let me love you

</l>
<l>One more time, baby

</l>
<l>One more time before you go away

</l>
<l>If you let me love you one more time

</l>
<l>I think we can talk it over

</l>
<l>Before you go away



</l>
<l>Here I am, baby

</l>
<l>My heart's right here in my hand

</l>
<l>Oh here I am, baby

</l>
<l>My heart's right here in my hand

</l>
<l>Oh I don't want you to leave me, baby

</l>
<l>Don't want you to go

</l><l>To no other man</l></lyrics></xml>
