<lyrics>



If you love me, baby

Why don't you write me sometime

If you, if you love me, baby

Why don't you let me

Hear from you sometime

You don't do nothing

But keep me worried

You just keep me worried

All the time



You know I think about you, baby

I think about you

Every night about this time

Oh you know, you know

You know I think about you, baby

I think about you

Every night about this time

It seems like you would treat me

A little better, baby

It seems like you would be

A little nicer and kind



Let me love you one more time, baby

Let me love you one more time

Before you go away

Let me, let me love you

One more time, baby

One more time before you go away

If you let me love you one more time

I think we can talk it over

Before you go away



Here I am, baby

My heart's right here in my hand

Oh here I am, baby

My heart's right here in my hand

Oh I don't want you to leave me, baby

Don't want you to go

To no other man
