<lyrics>


<l>Come on, please take a walk with me

</l>
<l>Come on, please take a walk with me

</l>
<l>Back to the same old place, baby where we long to be



</l>
<l>Come on, please take a walk with me

</l>
<l>Come on, please take a walk with me

</l>
<l>Back to the same old place, baby where your plantation is



</l>
<l>Now you know early one mornin' baby, 'bout half past four

</l>
<l>You know you come knockin' upon poor Nattie's door

</l>
<l>Come on, please take a walk with me

</l>
<l>Back to the same old place baby where we long to be



</l>
<l>When I call on that gal you know, I'm gonna walk so slow

</l>
<l>Tell ya ev'rytime ya see my little woman come walkin', walk some
more

</l>
<l>Come on, please take a walk with me

</l>
<l>Back to the same old place, mama, where we long to be



</l>
<l>Well you know I'm gonna take a little walk, on the avenue

</l>
<l>I've got somethin' baby, for you to do

</l>
<l>Come on, please take a walk with me

</l>
<l>You want your daddy to take a walk wit' you?

</l>
<l>Back to the same old place, gal where we long to be



</l>
<l>Well now you know I believe I'll walk after I walk

</l>
<l>On outta this town

</l>
<l>I'm gettin' tired of you doggin' me woman, now

</l>
<l>Doggin' me around

</l>
<l>Come on, please take a walk with me

</l>
<l>Back to the same old place, gal where we long to be</l></lyrics></xml>
