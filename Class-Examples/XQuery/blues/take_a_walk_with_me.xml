<lyrics>



Come on, please take a walk with me

Come on, please take a walk with me

Back to the same old place, baby where we long to be



Come on, please take a walk with me

Come on, please take a walk with me

Back to the same old place, baby where your plantation is



Now you know early one mornin' baby, 'bout half past four

You know you come knockin' upon poor Nattie's door

Come on, please take a walk with me

Back to the same old place baby where we long to be



When I call on that gal you know, I'm gonna walk so slow

Tell ya ev'rytime ya see my little woman come walkin', walk some
more

Come on, please take a walk with me

Back to the same old place, mama, where we long to be



Well you know I'm gonna take a little walk, on the avenue

I've got somethin' baby, for you to do

Come on, please take a walk with me

You want your daddy to take a walk wit' you?

Back to the same old place, gal where we long to be



Well now you know I believe I'll walk after I walk

On outta this town

I'm gettin' tired of you doggin' me woman, now

Doggin' me around

Come on, please take a walk with me

Back to the same old place, gal where we long to be
