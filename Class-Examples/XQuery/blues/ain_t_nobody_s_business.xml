<lyrics>



If I attend church all day Sunday

Lord I come back home and want to raise hell all day Monday

Lord it ain't nobody's business if I do



If my baby comes up to me and says I ain't got no money

I just got to reach into my pocket,

and say take all of my money honey

Ain't nobody's business if that's what I want to do



Ain't nobody's business, it just ain't nobody's business

Oh, it ain't nobody's business what I do

Ain't nobody's business if I do



If I ever get the notion to jump off into the Atlantic Ocean

It ain't nobody's business if that's what I want to do

Me and my baby we might fuss and fight

But with the Lord's help I know everything is gonna be alright

Oh and it ain't nobody's business what we do



Ain't nobody's business, it just ain't nobody's business

Oh, it ain't nobody's business what I do

Ain't nobody's business if I do
