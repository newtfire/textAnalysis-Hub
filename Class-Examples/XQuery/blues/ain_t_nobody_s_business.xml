<lyrics>


<l>If I attend church all day Sunday

</l>
<l>Lord I come back home and want to raise hell all day Monday

</l>
<l>Lord it ain't nobody's business if I do



</l>
<l>If my baby comes up to me and says I ain't got no money

</l>
<l>I just got to reach into my pocket,

</l>
<l>and say take all of my money honey

</l>
<l>Ain't nobody's business if that's what I want to do



</l>
<l>Ain't nobody's business, it just ain't nobody's business

</l>
<l>Oh, it ain't nobody's business what I do

</l>
<l>Ain't nobody's business if I do



</l>
<l>If I ever get the notion to jump off into the Atlantic Ocean

</l>
<l>It ain't nobody's business if that's what I want to do

</l>
<l>Me and my baby we might fuss and fight

</l>
<l>But with the Lord's help I know everything is gonna be alright

</l>
<l>Oh and it ain't nobody's business what we do



</l>
<l>Ain't nobody's business, it just ain't nobody's business

</l>
<l>Oh, it ain't nobody's business what I do

</l>
<l>Ain't nobody's business if I do</l></lyrics></xml>
