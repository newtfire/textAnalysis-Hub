<lyrics>


<l>Once upon a time, a long long time ago,

</l>
<l>wherever you'd lead me, I would surely follow

</l>
<l>Girl, you put me through some pain and misery

</l>
<l>And now you are standing on my doorstep,

</l>
<l>telling me how much you need me

</l>
<l>Baby, ain't nobody home (chorus: nobody's home)

</l>
<l>Ain't nobody home (chorus: nobody's home)



</l>
<l>How many times I begged for you to come home,

</l>
<l>but you laughed at me and said let me alone

</l>
<l>Through my falling tears I saw you walk away

</l>
<l>And now you're beggin' me to forgive you,

</l>
<l>but this time, baby, it's your turn to beg

</l>
<l>Baby, ain't nobody home (chorus: nobody home)

</l>
<l>Ain't nobody home (chorus: nobody home)



</l>
<l>Girl, I used to love you, in ways no one else would love you

</l>
<l>Gave you everything that I own

</l>
<l>Girl, you can't come back here

</l>
<l>Ain't nobody home (chorus: nobody's home)



</l>
<l>Once upon a time, when you went on your way

</l>
<l>But, girl, I hoped and prayed, that you'd come back some day

</l>
<l>But time has made some changes, turned me upside down

</l>
<l>So, you can beg me to forgive you, but this time, baby, you can turn

right around




</l>
<l>(chorus: ain't) Ain't nobody home (chorus: nobody home)

</l>
<l>Ain't nobody (chorus: ain't), baby, ain't nobody (chorus: nobody
home)

</l>
<l>You know you hurt me once, (chorus: ain't nobody, nobody home)
hmm

</l>
<l>Ain't nobody home (chorus: ain't, ain't nobody home)

</l>
<l>Oh you can beg me baby, (chorus: ain't, ain't nobody home) hmm

</l>
<l>(chorus: ain't nobody) Still nobody home, (chorus: nobody home)
hmm

</l>
<l>(chorus: ain't nobody) Ain't nobody baby (chorus: nobody home)

</l>
<l>(chorus: ain't nobody) Ain't nobody home (chorus: nobody home)

</l>
<l>I hear you knockin' (chorus: ain't nobody, ain't nobody home)</l></lyrics></xml>
