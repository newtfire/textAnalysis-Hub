<lyrics>



Once upon a time, a long long time ago,

wherever you'd lead me, I would surely follow

Girl, you put me through some pain and misery

And now you are standing on my doorstep,

telling me how much you need me

Baby, ain't nobody home (chorus: nobody's home)

Ain't nobody home (chorus: nobody's home)



How many times I begged for you to come home,

but you laughed at me and said let me alone

Through my falling tears I saw you walk away

And now you're beggin' me to forgive you,

but this time, baby, it's your turn to beg

Baby, ain't nobody home (chorus: nobody home)

Ain't nobody home (chorus: nobody home)



Girl, I used to love you, in ways no one else would love you

Gave you everything that I own

Girl, you can't come back here

Ain't nobody home (chorus: nobody's home)



Once upon a time, when you went on your way

But, girl, I hoped and prayed, that you'd come back some day

But time has made some changes, turned me upside down

So, you can beg me to forgive you, but this time, baby, you can turn
right around



(chorus: ain't) Ain't nobody home (chorus: nobody home)

Ain't nobody (chorus: ain't), baby, ain't nobody (chorus: nobody
home)

You know you hurt me once, (chorus: ain't nobody, nobody home)
hmm

Ain't nobody home (chorus: ain't, ain't nobody home)

Oh you can beg me baby, (chorus: ain't, ain't nobody home) hmm

(chorus: ain't nobody) Still nobody home, (chorus: nobody home)
hmm

(chorus: ain't nobody) Ain't nobody baby (chorus: nobody home)

(chorus: ain't nobody) Ain't nobody home (chorus: nobody home)

I hear you knockin' (chorus: ain't nobody, ain't nobody home)
