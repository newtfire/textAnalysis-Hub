<l>Have you heard about my baby?

</l>
<l>Yes, how I love her you don't know

</l>
<l>Have you heard about my baby?

</l>
<l>How I love, how I love her you don't know

</l>
<l>I declare it hurt me so bad,

</l>
<l>Yes, when I heard she'd got to go



</l>
<l>Have you heard about my baby?

</l>
<l>Yes I tried, yes I tried, but I let her down

</l>
<l>Heard about my baby?

</l>
<l>Ooh yes, I tried and I let her down

</l>
<l>Ooh, she burned me with her love

</l>
<l>Yes, no other, no other will wear her crown



</l>
<l>Yes, indeed



</l>
<l>Have you heard about my baby?

</l>
<l>Where she gone, where she gone, I just don't know

</l>
<l>Yes, have you heard about my baby?

</l>
<l>Ooh, where she gone, where she gone, I just don't know

</l>
<l>Well, if you should see my baby

</l>
<l>Yes, please tell her that I love her so



</l>
<l>Yes, no more next time</l></lyrics></xml>
