<lyrics>



Have you heard about my baby?

Yes, how I love her you don't know

Have you heard about my baby?

How I love, how I love her you don't know

I declare it hurt me so bad,

Yes, when I heard she'd got to go



Have you heard about my baby?

Yes I tried, yes I tried, but I let her down

Heard about my baby?

Ooh yes, I tried and I let her down

Ooh, she burned me with her love

Yes, no other, no other will wear her crown



Yes, indeed



Have you heard about my baby?

Where she gone, where she gone, I just don't know

Yes, have you heard about my baby?

Ooh, where she gone, where she gone, I just don't know

Well, if you should see my baby

Yes, please tell her that I love her so



Yes, no more next time
