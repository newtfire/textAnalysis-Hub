<lyrics>


<l>Took the car and drove off the hills

</l>
<l>Saw the flashing lights and saw them die

</l>
<l>Left behind society that kills

</l>
<l>Me and Nancy waved them all goodbye



</l>
<l>Took the car, the sun was going down

</l>
<l>Saw the changing colors of the sky

</l>
<l>An old Apache canyon out campground

</l>
<l>Secure and safe together made us sigh



</l>
<l>Took the car and filled the trunk with wood

</l>
<l>Took it back and made of it a fire

</l>
<l>To be a child again would be so good

</l>
<l>Me and Nancy warm in our desire



</l>
<l>Took the car and drove it everywhere

</l>
<l>Through the land where all the West began

</l>
<l>Desert wind was blowing in our hair

</l>
<l>Me and Nancy running hand in hand</l></lyrics></xml>
