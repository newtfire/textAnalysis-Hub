<lyrics>



Took the car and drove off the hills

Saw the flashing lights and saw them die

Left behind society that kills

Me and Nancy waved them all goodbye



Took the car, the sun was going down

Saw the changing colors of the sky

An old Apache canyon out campground

Secure and safe together made us sigh



Took the car and filled the trunk with wood

Took it back and made of it a fire

To be a child again would be so good

Me and Nancy warm in our desire



Took the car and drove it everywhere

Through the land where all the West began

Desert wind was blowing in our hair

Me and Nancy running hand in hand
