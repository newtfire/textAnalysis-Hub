Evenin'

Ev'ry night you come and you find me, oh Lord

And you always come and remind me, oh yes

That my gal is gone, my baby's gone, oh Lord, my baby's gone



Evenin'

Can't you see I'm deeply in your power, oh Lord?

Every minute seems like an hour, oh Lord

Since my gal, she's gone, my baby's gone, my baby's gone



Now shadow's fallin', well,

Are on the wall

That's the time I miss your kiss, most of all

Even though I try, how can I go on, oh yes, go on

Pretty baby



Evenin'

Let me sleep 'til the gray dawn is breakin', oh yes

I don't care if I don't awaken, oh Lord

Since my gal she's gone, my baby's gone, oh yes she's gone



Evenin'

Let me sleep 'til gray dawn is breakin', oh Lord

I don't care if I don't awaken, oh yes, since my gal she's gone

My baby's gone, my baby's gone

My baby's gone
