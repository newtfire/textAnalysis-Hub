<lyrics>


<l>Evenin'

</l>
<l>Ev'ry night you come and you find me, oh Lord

</l>
<l>And you always come and remind me, oh yes

</l>
<l>That my gal is gone, my baby's gone, oh Lord, my baby's gone



</l>
<l>Evenin'

</l>
<l>Can't you see I'm deeply in your power, oh Lord?

</l>
<l>Every minute seems like an hour, oh Lord

</l>
<l>Since my gal, she's gone, my baby's gone, my baby's gone



</l>
<l>Now shadow's fallin', well,

</l>
<l>Are on the wall

</l>
<l>That's the time I miss your kiss, most of all

</l>
<l>Even though I try, how can I go on, oh yes, go on

</l>
<l>Pretty baby



</l>
<l>Evenin'

</l>
<l>Let me sleep 'til the gray dawn is breakin', oh yes

</l>
<l>I don't care if I don't awaken, oh Lord

</l>
<l>Since my gal she's gone, my baby's gone, oh yes she's gone



</l>
<l>Evenin'

</l>
<l>Let me sleep 'til gray dawn is breakin', oh Lord

</l>
<l>I don't care if I don't awaken, oh yes, since my gal she's gone

</l>
<l>My baby's gone, my baby's gone

</l>
<l>My baby's gone</l></lyrics></xml>
