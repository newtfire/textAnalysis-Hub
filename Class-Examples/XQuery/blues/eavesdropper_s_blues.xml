<lyrics>



I heard the folks were talking here yesterday

As I listened by the door

Would eavesdrop
1
 'cause they never hear no good, they
say

And I heard things that hurt me so



They said I had a man I give my money to

They said I had a man I give my money to

And if I was broke he would turn my eyes all blue



They talked about my pa who was blind in one eye

They talked about my pa who was blind in one eye

They said he was a sinner and was too mean to cry



I never knock nobody, wonder why they picked on me

I never knock nobody, wonder why they picked on me

There's goin' to be a funeral if they don't let me be



I never stopped to listen, to try and hear no good news

I never stopped to listen, to try and hear no good news

I hear things about me, give me those eavesdropper's blues



__________

Note 1: eavesdrop, to listen secretly to what is said in private.
Etymology: probably back-formation from eavesdropper, literally, one
standing under the drip from the eaves (= the lower border of a roof
that overhangs the wall).
