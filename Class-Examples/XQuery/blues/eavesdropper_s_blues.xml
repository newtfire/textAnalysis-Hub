<lyrics>

<l>I heard the folks were talking here yesterday

</l>
<l>As I listened by the door

</l>
<l>Would eavesdrop
1
'cause they never hear no good, they </l>
<l>say

</l>
<l>And I heard things that hurt me so



</l>
<l>They said I had a man I give my money to

</l>
<l>They said I had a man I give my money to

</l>
<l>And if I was broke he would turn my eyes all blue



</l>
<l>They talked about my pa who was blind in one eye

</l>
<l>They talked about my pa who was blind in one eye

</l>
<l>They said he was a sinner and was too mean to cry



</l>
<l>I never knock nobody, wonder why they picked on me

</l>
<l>I never knock nobody, wonder why they picked on me

</l>
<l>There's goin' to be a funeral if they don't let me be



</l>
<l>I never stopped to listen, to try and hear no good news

</l>
<l>I never stopped to listen, to try and hear no good news

</l>
<l>I hear things about me, give me those eavesdropper's blues

<note>Note 1: eavesdrop, to listen secretly to what is said in private.
Etymology: probably back-formation from eavesdropper, literally, one
standing under the drip from the eaves (= the lower border of a roof
that overhangs the wall)</note></lyrics></xml>
