<lyrics>


<l>Ah, I'm a mean, mean woman, I don't mean no one man, no good, no

</l>
<l>I'm a mean, mean woman, I don't mean no one man, no good

</l>
<l>I just treats 'em like I wants to, I never treats 'em, honey like I

should




</l>
<l>Oh, Lord, I once had a daddy, he said he'd give me everything in
sight

</l>
<l>Once had a daddy, said he'd give me everything in sight, yes, he
did

</l>
<l>So I said, "Honey, I want the sunshine, you take the stars out of the
night,

</l>
<l>come on and give 'em to me, babe, 'cause I want 'em right now"



</l>
<l>I ain't the kind of woman, who'd make your life a bed of ease, ha ha
ha ha!

</l>
<l>No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

</l>
<l>I'm not the kind of woman, no, to make your life a bed of ease

</l>
<l>Yeah, but if you, if you just wanna go out drinkin', honey, won't you
invite me along, please

</l>
<l>Oh, I'll be so good to ya babe, yeah!

</l>
<l>Whoa, go on!



</l>
<l>I guess I'm just like a turtle, that's hidin' underneath its horny
shell

</l>
<l>Whoa, whoa, oh yeah, like a turtle, hidin' underneath its hard-ass
shell

</l>
<l>But you know I'm very well protected, I know this goddamn life too

well




</l>
<l>Oh! Now call me mean, you can call me evil, yeah, yeah, I've been
called much worse things around, honey, don't ya know I have!

</l>
<l>Whoa, call me mean or call me evil, I've been called much worse
things, all things around,

</l>
<l>yeah, but I'm gonna take good care of Janis, yeah,

</l>
<l>Honey, ain't no one gonna dog me down

</l>
<l>Alright, yeah</l></lyrics></xml>
