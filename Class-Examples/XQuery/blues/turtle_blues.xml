<lyrics>



Ah, I'm a mean, mean woman, I don't mean no one man, no good, no

I'm a mean, mean woman, I don't mean no one man, no good

I just treats 'em like I wants to, I never treats 'em, honey like I
should



Oh, Lord, I once had a daddy, he said he'd give me everything in
sight

Once had a daddy, said he'd give me everything in sight, yes, he
did

So I said, "Honey, I want the sunshine, you take the stars out of the
night,

come on and give 'em to me, babe, 'cause I want 'em right now"



I ain't the kind of woman, who'd make your life a bed of ease, ha ha
ha ha!

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

I'm not the kind of woman, no, to make your life a bed of ease

Yeah, but if you, if you just wanna go out drinkin', honey, won't you
invite me along, please

Oh, I'll be so good to ya babe, yeah!

Whoa, go on!



I guess I'm just like a turtle, that's hidin' underneath its horny
shell

Whoa, whoa, oh yeah, like a turtle, hidin' underneath its hard-ass
shell

But you know I'm very well protected, I know this goddamn life too
well



Oh! Now call me mean, you can call me evil, yeah, yeah, I've been
called much worse things around, honey, don't ya know I have!

Whoa, call me mean or call me evil, I've been called much worse
things, all things around,

yeah, but I'm gonna take good care of Janis, yeah,

Honey, ain't no one gonna dog me down

Alright, yeah
