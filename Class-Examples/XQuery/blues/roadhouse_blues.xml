<lyrics>



(Spoken:

Put your seat belts on, we gonna ride down the road)



Keep your eyes on the road

Your hands upon the wheel

Keep your eyes on the road

Your hands upon the wheel



Well we goin' to Kingston Mines
1

Say we gonna have a real

Good time, yes alright

It's alright



In the back of the 
roadhouse

they got some bungalows

In the back of the roadhouse they got some bungalows

And that's for the people that like to go down slow, yeah



Let it 
roll
 baby roll

Let it roll baby roll

Let it roll baby roll

Let it roll, all night long



Yeah, blow your horn, A.C.!

Let me hear you blow



I want you baby

I say passion lady

I want you baby

So give up your vows

Say give up your vows



Save our city

Save our city

The girl is alright

Yeah, you know she's alright



Say let her roll, roll, roll

Let her thrill my soul

You gotta honk a bonk a beep bonk

A bump, bump, bump

You gotta bbbbbbbbbbb

I tell you baby



I, I, I, I, I, I , I wanna make love to ya baby

All night long



Said we woke up this mornin', A. C.,

(Got some scotch and milk)

Said we woke up this mornin', A. C.,

(Got some scotch and milk)



I said your future is uncertain

The end is always near, yeah



Let it roll baby roll

Let it roll baby roll

Let it roll baby roll

Let it roll, all night long



All night long

All night, all night, all night all night long



Let it roll baby roll

Let it roll baby roll

Let it roll baby roll

Let it roll, all night long

Yeah!
