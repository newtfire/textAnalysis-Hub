<lyrics>


<l>Woman you've been havin' your way, and you don't want to see me have
mine

</l>
<l>Woman you've been havin' your way, and you don't want to see me have
mine

</l>
<l>So there's no getting along, we're just two of the same old kind



</l>
<l>I tried to make things happy, and your life I tried to let you
enjoy

</l>
<l>I tried to make things happy, and your life I tried to let you
enjoy

</l>
<l>But you tell me you you're your mother's baby girl,

</l>
<l>do you realize I'm my mama's baby boy?



</l>
<l>Around home you were just a spoiled one, and what you said, it had to
be

</l>
<l>Around home you were just a spoiled one, and what you said, it had to
be

</l>
<l>But do you know that the same old story, little girl, really goes for

me




</l>
<l>Since we are just two babies, darlin' why can't we agree?

</l>
<l>Since we are just two babies, darlin' why can't we agree?

</l>
<l>I'll talk baby talk to you, if you'll talk baby talk to me</l></lyrics></xml>
