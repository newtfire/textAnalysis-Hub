<lyrics>



Woman you've been havin' your way, and you don't want to see me have
mine

Woman you've been havin' your way, and you don't want to see me have
mine

So there's no getting along, we're just two of the same old kind



I tried to make things happy, and your life I tried to let you
enjoy

I tried to make things happy, and your life I tried to let you
enjoy

But you tell me you you're your mother's baby girl,

do you realize I'm my mama's baby boy?



Around home you were just a spoiled one, and what you said, it had to
be

Around home you were just a spoiled one, and what you said, it had to
be

But do you know that the same old story, little girl, really goes for
me



Since we are just two babies, darlin' why can't we agree?

Since we are just two babies, darlin' why can't we agree?

I'll talk baby talk to you, if you'll talk baby talk to me
