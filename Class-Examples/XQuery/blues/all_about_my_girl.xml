<lyrics>


<l>When you told me it was all over, babe

</l>
<l>You thought all I ever was, was through, (ooooh!)

</l>
<l>When you told me it was all over, babe

</l>
<l>Thought all I ever was through (oh yeah!)

</l>
<l>I had three more irons in the fire

</l>
<l>Sorry, but I forgot to tell you



</l>
<l>One more thing I'd like to tell you right now, uh-huh



</l>
<l>You thought I'd be hurt when you left me babe

</l>
<l>But I found another friend, (oooh!)

</l>
<l>Yeah, you thought I'd be hurt when you left me babe

</l>
<l>Well, I found another friend, (found me somebody else)

</l>
<l>But sometimes what you lose,

</l>
<l>Is nothing compared to what you win

</l>
<l>(I'm gonna feel alright now)



</l>
<l>A good man may fall, babe (oh yeah) but ya get back on your feet

</l>
<l>(Yeah, I know, I know, I know)

</l>
<l>You know, you know, a good man may fall, babe

</l>
<l>Ya know ya get back on your feet

</l>
<l>Yes I've got a good thing goin' now, woman (got a good thing goin'
now)

</l><l>Oh the future look good to me (future look so good to me) alright</l></lyrics></xml>
