<lyrics>



When you told me it was all over, babe

You thought all I ever was, was through, (ooooh!)

When you told me it was all over, babe

Thought all I ever was through (oh yeah!)

I had three more irons in the fire

Sorry, but I forgot to tell you



One more thing I'd like to tell you right now, uh-huh



You thought I'd be hurt when you left me babe

But I found another friend, (oooh!)

Yeah, you thought I'd be hurt when you left me babe

Well, I found another friend, (found me somebody else)

But sometimes what you lose,

Is nothing compared to what you win

(I'm gonna feel alright now)



A good man may fall, babe (oh yeah) but ya get back on your feet

(Yeah, I know, I know, I know)

You know, you know, a good man may fall, babe

Ya know ya get back on your feet

Yes I've got a good thing goin' now, woman (got a good thing goin'
now)

Oh the future look good to me (future look so good to me) alright
