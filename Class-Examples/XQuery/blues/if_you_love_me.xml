<lyrics>



If you love me

You will give your heart

Why should be apart

If you love me



If you love me

You will know the truth

I wasn't born to lose

And I love you



Affinity and communication

That makes reality

Understanding is the first thing

It means so much to me



If I love you

I will find the key

If it's meant to be

'Cause I love you



Affinity and communication

That makes reality

Understanding is the first thing

It means so much to me



If I love you

I will find the key

If it's meant to be

'Cause I love you
