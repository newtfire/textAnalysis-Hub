<lyrics>



Well, I wish I was a catfish,

swimmin in a oh, deep, blue sea

I would have all you good lookin women,

fishin, fishin after me

Sure 'nough, a-after me

Sure 'nough, a-after me

Oh 'nough, oh 'nough, sure 'nough



I went to my baby's house,

and I sit down oh, on her steps.

She said, "Now, come on in now, Muddy

You know, my husband just now left

Sure 'nough, he just now left

Sure 'nough, he just now left"

Sure 'nough, oh well, oh well



Well, my mother told my father,

just before hmmm, I was born,

"I got a boy child's comin,

He's gonna be, he's gonna be a rollin stone,

Sure 'nough, he's a rollin stone

Sure 'nough, he's a rollin stone"

Oh well he's a, oh well he's a, oh well he's a



Well, I feel, yes I feel,

feel that I could lay down oh, time ain't long

I'm gonna catch the first thing smokin,

back, back down the road I'm goin

Back down the road I'm goin

Back down the road I'm goin

Sure 'nough back, sure 'nough back
