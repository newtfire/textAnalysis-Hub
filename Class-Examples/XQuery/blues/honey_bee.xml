<lyrics>



Sail on, sail on my little honey bee, sail on

Sail on, sail on my little honey bee, sail on

You gonna keep on sailing till you lose your happy home



Sail on, sail on my little honey bee, sail on

Sail on, sail on my little honey bee, sail on

I don't mind you sailing, but please don't sail so long



All right little honey bee



I hear a lotta buzzing, sound like my little honey bee

I hear a lotta buzzing, sound like my little honey bee

She been all around the world making honey

But now she is coming back home to me
