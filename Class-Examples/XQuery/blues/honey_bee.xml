<lyrics>


<l>Sail on, sail on my little honey bee, sail on

</l>
<l>Sail on, sail on my little honey bee, sail on

</l>
<l>You gonna keep on sailing till you lose your happy home



</l>
<l>Sail on, sail on my little honey bee, sail on

</l>
<l>Sail on, sail on my little honey bee, sail on

</l>
<l>I don't mind you sailing, but please don't sail so long



</l>
<l>All right little honey bee



</l>
<l>I hear a lotta buzzing, sound like my little honey bee

</l>
<l>I hear a lotta buzzing, sound like my little honey bee

</l>
<l>She been all around the world making honey

</l>
<l>But now she is coming back home to me</l></lyrics></xml>
