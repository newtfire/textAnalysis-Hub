<l>It had to be you

</l>
<l>It had to be you

</l>
<l>I've wandered around

</l>
<l>Finally found

</l>
<l>Somebody who

</l>
<l>Could make me be true

</l>
<l>Could make me be blue

</l>
<l>And even be glad

</l>
<l>Just to be sad

</l>
<l>Thinking of you



</l>
<l>Some others I've seen

</l>
<l>Might never be mean

</l>
<l>Might never be cross

</l>
<l>Try to be boss

</l>
<l>They wouldn't do

</l>
<l>For nobody else

</l>
<l>Gave me a thrill

</l>
<l>With all your faults

</l>
<l>I love you still

</l>
<l>It had to be you

</l>
<l>Wonderful you

</l>
<l>It had to be you



</l>
<l>Some others I've seen

</l>
<l>Might never be mean

</l>
<l>Might never be cross

</l>
<l>Or try to be boss

</l>
<l>But they wouldn't do

</l>
<l>'Cause nobody else

</l>
<l>Gave me a thrill

</l>
<l>With all your faults

</l>
<l>I love you still

</l>
<l>It had to be you

</l>
<l>Had to be you

</l>
<l>Had to be you

</l>
<l>It had to be you

</l>
<l>Wonderful you

</l>
<l>It had to be you



</l>
<l>It had to be you

</l>
<l>Wonderful you

</l>
<l>It had to be you

</l>
<l>Had to be you

</l>
<l>Wonderful you, yeah</l></lyrics></xml>
