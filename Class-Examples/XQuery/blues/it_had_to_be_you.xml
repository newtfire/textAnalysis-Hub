<lyrics>



It had to be you

It had to be you

I've wandered around

Finally found

Somebody who

Could make me be true

Could make me be blue

And even be glad

Just to be sad

Thinking of you



Some others I've seen

Might never be mean

Might never be cross

Try to be boss

They wouldn't do

For nobody else

Gave me a thrill

With all your faults

I love you still

It had to be you

Wonderful you

It had to be you



Some others I've seen

Might never be mean

Might never be cross

Or try to be boss

But they wouldn't do

'Cause nobody else

Gave me a thrill

With all your faults

I love you still

It had to be you

Had to be you

Had to be you

It had to be you

Wonderful you

It had to be you



It had to be you

Wonderful you

It had to be you

Had to be you

Wonderful you, yeah
