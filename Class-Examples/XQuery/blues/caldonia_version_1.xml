<lyrics>



Hey, I'm walking with my woman, she got great big feet

Long, lean and angry, she ain't had nothing to eat

But she's my woman, and I love her just the same

She's a fine looking woman, and Caldonia is her name



Now here we go!



Caldonia, Caldonia, what makes your big head so hard

I love her, yeah, I love her just the same

Give me that now



I'm crazy about the woman, 'cause Caldonia is her name

Can we do it once more?



Caldonia, Caldonia, what makes your big head so hard, oh

Caldonia, Caldonia, Caldonia
