<lyrics>


<l>Hey, I'm walking with my woman, she got great big feet

</l>
<l>Long, lean and angry, she ain't had nothing to eat

</l>
<l>But she's my woman, and I love her just the same

</l>
<l>She's a fine looking woman, and Caldonia is her name



</l>
<l>Now here we go!



</l>
<l>Caldonia, Caldonia, what makes your big head so hard

</l>
<l>I love her, yeah, I love her just the same

</l>
<l>Give me that now



</l>
<l>I'm crazy about the woman, 'cause Caldonia is her name

</l>
<l>Can we do it once more?



</l>
<l>Caldonia, Caldonia, what makes your big head so hard, oh

</l>
<l>Caldonia, Caldonia, Caldonia</l></lyrics></xml>
