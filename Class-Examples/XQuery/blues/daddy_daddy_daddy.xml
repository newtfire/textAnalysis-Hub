</l>
<l>If I'm awake or if I'm dreamin' Lord, my daddy daddy's on my mind



</l>
<l>Well, I brag 'bout my daddy to all the women that I see

</l>
<l>Yeah, I brag 'bout my daddy to all the women that I see

away from me




</l>
<l>That's my daddy, daddy, daddy, Lord, it's daddy, daddy, all the
time

</l>
<l>That's my daddy, daddy, daddy, daddy, daddy, all the time

</l>

time

</l>
<l>Well, I got a lovin' daddy, treats me like a daddy should

</l>
<l>Yeah, I got a lovin' daddy, treats me like a daddy should
