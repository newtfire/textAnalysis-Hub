<lyrics>



Oh, it's daddy, daddy, daddy, it's daddy, daddy, all the time

Lord, that's daddy, daddy, daddy, daddy, daddy, all the time

If I'm awake or if I'm dreamin' Lord, my daddy daddy's on my mind



Well, I brag 'bout my daddy to all the women that I see

Yeah, I brag 'bout my daddy to all the women that I see

Never say those damn women Lord, they're tryin' to steal my daddy
away from me



That's my daddy, daddy, daddy, Lord, it's daddy, daddy, all the
time

That's my daddy, daddy, daddy, daddy, daddy, all the time

If I'm awake or just dreamin' Lord, daddy daddy's on my mind



Well, if your daddy likes walkin', honey, walks five miles a day

Yeah, if your daddy likes walkin', walks five miles a day

No matter what he wants, child, he walks off far way



Oh, it's daddy, daddy, daddy, Lord, it's daddy, daddy, all the
time

It's my daddy, daddy, daddy, daddy, daddy, all the time

If I'm awake or if I'm dreamin' Lord, daddy daddy's on my mind



Well, I got a lovin' daddy, treats me like a daddy should

Yeah, I got a lovin' daddy, treats me like a daddy should

You know he kisses me at bed time, gives me candy when I'm good



Oh, it's daddy, daddy, daddy, Lord, it's daddy, daddy, all the
time

Lord, it's daddy, daddy, daddy, daddy, daddy, all the time

If I'm awake or if I'm dreamin' Lord, my daddy daddy's on my mind
