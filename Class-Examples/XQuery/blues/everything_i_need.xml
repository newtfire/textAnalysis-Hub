<lyrics>



Ain't got no money

No where to sleep

No friend no family

No bread no meat

No bread no meat

No friend no family

No bread, no bread no meat



I ain't got no reason

Ain't got no rhyme

Ain't gettin' no younger

And I'm runnin' outta time

Runnin' outta time

Ain't gettin' no younger

And I'm runnin' outta time

Oh yes I am



(Chorus:)

But I'm still climbing up the mountain side

Don't count me out

Long as I got my heart and soul

I got everything

I got everything I need

Everything I need



Ain't got no window

Ain't got no door

But I can feel the sun shining

Where it's never shined before

Never shined before

Feel the sun shining where it's never shined before



(Chorus 2x)



But I'm still climbing up the mountain side

Can't count me out

Long as I got my heart and soul

I got everything

I got everything I need

Everything I need



Ain't got no picture

Ain't got no wall

Ain't got nobody

Hear me when I call

Hear me when I call

Ain't got nobody

Hear me when I call



(Chorus)
