<lyrics>


<l>Oh oh now baby, tell me how have you been

</l>
<l>We all have missed you, and the way you grin

</l>
<l>The day is necessary, every now and then

</l>
<l>For souls to move on, givin' life back again, and again

</l>
<l>Fly on fly on, fly on my friend

</l>
<l>Go on, live again love again



</l>
<l>Day after day, night after night

</l>
<l>Sittin' here singin' every minute,

</l>
<l>as the years go passing by, by, by, by

</l>
<l>Long look in the mirror, we've come face to face

</l>
<l>Wishin' all the love we took for granted,

</l>
<l>love we have today



</l>
<l>Life without you, all the love you passed my way

</l>
<l>The angels have waited for so long, now they have their way

</l><l>Take your place</l></lyrics></xml>
