<lyrics>



Oh oh now baby, tell me how have you been

We all have missed you, and the way you grin

The day is necessary, every now and then

For souls to move on, givin' life back again, and again

Fly on fly on, fly on my friend

Go on, live again love again



Day after day, night after night

Sittin' here singin' every minute,

as the years go passing by, by, by, by

Long look in the mirror, we've come face to face

Wishin' all the love we took for granted,

love we have today



Life without you, all the love you passed my way

The angels have waited for so long, now they have their way

Take your place
