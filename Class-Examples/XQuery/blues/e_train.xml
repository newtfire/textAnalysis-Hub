<lyrics>





Take the "E" train babe, take the easy train to Austin
Take the "E" train babe, take the easy train to Austin
Baby you been ridin' that train so long, Lord knows when you'll come home

Come on ride with me baby, all the drinks are on me
Come on ride with me baby, all the drinks are on me
Honey you know there ain't no last call, when you ride on the "E"

Let your light shine down, let it shine down on me
Let your light shine down Lord, let it shine on me
Lord let your good light shine, let it shine on the "E" train

Take the "E" train
Take the "E" train
Baby take the "E" train,
take the easy train to Austin
Honey you been ridin' that train so long,
Lord knows when you'll come home
