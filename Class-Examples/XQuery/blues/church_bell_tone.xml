<lyrics>



People I thought I heard, I thought I heard, heard them church
bell tone

Well, I thought I heard , I heard, thought I heard this mornin',
thought I heard the church bell tone

It might be tonin' for my baby, my baby she been mighty low



Way down, way down in shady land, way down, way down, way down in
shady land

There's two great white horses, they gonna drive my baby away

Well, two, two great white horses, comin' to drive my baby to the
buryin' ground



Hmmm, gonna take her down to a buryin' ground

I hate to see the two great white horses comin'

That ol' hearse gonna back up to the door

I know I heard, I know I heard, I know I heard, a church bell tone
this mornin'

Hmm, I know I heard, heard the church bell tone

I said, "Bye bye, baby, bye bye, baby, I know we'll never meet
again

Hmmm, we'll never meet no more; goodbye, baby, goodbye
darlin'nbsp;"
