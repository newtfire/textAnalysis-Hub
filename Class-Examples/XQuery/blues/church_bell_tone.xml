<lyrics>


<l>People I thought I heard, I thought I heard, heard them church
bell tone

</l>
<l>Well, I thought I heard , I heard, thought I heard this mornin',
thought I heard the church bell tone

</l>
<l>It might be tonin' for my baby, my baby she been mighty low



</l>
<l>Way down, way down in shady land, way down, way down, way down in
shady land

</l>
<l>There's two great white horses, they gonna drive my baby away

</l>
<l>Well, two, two great white horses, comin' to drive my baby to the

buryin' ground




</l>
<l>Hmmm, gonna take her down to a buryin' ground

</l>
<l>I hate to see the two great white horses comin'

</l>
<l>That ol' hearse gonna back up to the door

</l>
<l>I know I heard, I know I heard, I know I heard, a church bell tone
this mornin'

</l>
<l>Hmm, I know I heard, heard the church bell tone

</l>
<l>I said, "Bye bye, baby, bye bye, baby, I know we'll never meet
again

</l><l>Hmmm, we'll never meet no more; goodbye, baby, goodbye</l>
<l>darlin'"</l></lyrics></xml>
