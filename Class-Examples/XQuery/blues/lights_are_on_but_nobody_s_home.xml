<lyrics>



Playin' with my mind babe

Always accusin' me of doin' wrong

I say you're playin' with my mind, woman

You're always accusin' me of doin' wrong



I can see you're lights on baby

But I can't see, I can't see nobody home



Now here come my mother-in-law

It's the same thing ev'ry day

Ever since we been married baby

She tried to drive me away, yeah

Now you're still accusin' me baby

Accusin' me of doin' wrong



I can see your lights on baby

But I can't see, I can't see nobody home



When I have to go to work

I gotta go to work downtown

If I get home a little late baby

You say I'm out messin' around

Now you're still accusin' me baby

Accusin' me of doin' wrong



I can see your lights on baby

But I can't see, I can't see nobody home
