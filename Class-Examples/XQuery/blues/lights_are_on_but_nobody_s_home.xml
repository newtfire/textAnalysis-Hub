<lyrics>


<l>Playin' with my mind babe

</l>
<l>Always accusin' me of doin' wrong

</l>
<l>I say you're playin' with my mind, woman

</l>
<l>You're always accusin' me of doin' wrong



</l>
<l>I can see you're lights on baby

</l>
<l>But I can't see, I can't see nobody home



</l>
<l>Now here come my mother-in-law

</l>
<l>It's the same thing ev'ry day

</l>
<l>Ever since we been married baby

</l>
<l>She tried to drive me away, yeah

</l>
<l>Now you're still accusin' me baby

</l>
<l>Accusin' me of doin' wrong



</l>
<l>I can see your lights on baby

</l>
<l>But I can't see, I can't see nobody home



</l>
<l>When I have to go to work

</l>
<l>I gotta go to work downtown

</l>
<l>If I get home a little late baby

</l>
<l>You say I'm out messin' around

</l>
<l>Now you're still accusin' me baby

</l>
<l>Accusin' me of doin' wrong



</l>
<l>I can see your lights on baby

</l>
<l>But I can't see, I can't see nobody home</l></lyrics></xml>
