<lyrics>



Oh, baby, look how you got me standin' around cyin'

Oh, baby, look how you got me standin' around cyin'

I know I don't love you, little girl,

but, your always restin' on my mind



Oh baby, I ain't gonna be ridin' ya around in my automobile

Oh baby, I ain't gonna be ridin' ya around in my automobile

You got so many men,

that I'm afraid you may get me killed



Oh baby, you ain't nothin' like you used to be

Oh no, don't get me killed, honey

Oh baby, you ain't nothin' like you used to be

When I was deep in love with you little girl,

you was just sweet as an apple on a tree
