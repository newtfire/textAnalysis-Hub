<lyrics>


<l>Oh, baby, look how you got me standin' around cyin'

</l>
<l>Oh, baby, look how you got me standin' around cyin'

</l>
<l>I know I don't love you, little girl,

</l>
<l>but, your always restin' on my mind



</l>
<l>Oh baby, I ain't gonna be ridin' ya around in my automobile

</l>
<l>Oh baby, I ain't gonna be ridin' ya around in my automobile

</l>
<l>You got so many men,

</l>
<l>that I'm afraid you may get me killed



</l>
<l>Oh baby, you ain't nothin' like you used to be

</l>
<l>Oh no, don't get me killed, honey

</l>
<l>Oh baby, you ain't nothin' like you used to be

</l>
<l>When I was deep in love with you little girl,

</l>
<l>you was just sweet as an apple on a tree</l></lyrics></xml>
