<lyrics>



Come by here, baby, come by here

Come by here, baby, come by here

Come by here, baby, come by here

Oh baby, won't you come by here



I love you baby, come by here

I love you baby, come by here

I love you baby, come by here

Oh baby, won't you come by here



I want you baby, come by here

I want you baby, come by here

I want you baby, come by here

Oh baby, won't you come by here



We'll get married, come by here

We'll get married, come by here

We'll get married, come by here

Oh baby, won't you come by here



Come by here good-looking, come by here

I need you, come by here

Come by here good-looking, come by here

Oh baby, won't you come by here
