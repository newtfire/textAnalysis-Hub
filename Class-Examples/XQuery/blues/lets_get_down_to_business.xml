<lyrics>



I'm glad to see you back, baby

You been gone such a long, long time

And now that you're back, baby

Let's make up for long lost time

Well, the day that you left me, baby

I nearly went out of my mind

I couldn't hardly sleep at night, baby

Every morning I woke up crying



So let's get down to business

Yeah, let's get down to business

Well, let's get down to business, baby

You been gone such a long time



Now I know that I love you, baby

And I thought that you loved me, too

Now, now that we're together, baby

Tell me what are you going to do

Well, what made us break up, baby

I don't know till today

But if it was my fault, baby

I swear I'll change my ways



So let's get down to business

Yeah, let's get down to business

Well, let's get down to business, baby

You been gone such a long time



Hey, let's, let's

Let's get down to business, baby

Well, well, well

Let's get down to business

Yeah, let's get down to business, baby

You been gone such a long time



I know that I love you, baby

I say I thought that you loved me, too

Now, now we're together, baby

What are you going to do

I said whatever made us break up, baby

I don't know till today

But if it was my fault, baby

I swear I'll change my ways



So let's get down to business

Yeah, let's get down to business

Well, let's get down to business, baby

You been gone such a long time
