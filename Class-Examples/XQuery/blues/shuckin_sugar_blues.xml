<lyrics>


<l>I've got your picture, and I'm going to put it in a frame

</l>
<l>I've got your picture, I'll put it in a frame, Shuckin' Sugar

</l>
<l>And then if you leave town, we can find you just the same



</l>
<l>Now if you don't love me, please don't dog me around

</l>
<l>If you don't love me, please don't dog me around, Shuckin' Sugar

</l>
<l>Like you dog me around, I'll know you'll put me down



</l>
<l>I know my baby, thinks she wanting all of me

</l>
<l>I know my baby, thinks she wanting all of me, Shuckin' Sugar

</l>
<l>Everytime she smiles, she shines a light on me



</l>
<l>Oh big fair brown, something's goin' on wrong

</l>
<l>Oh big fair brown is, something's goin' on wrong, Shuckin' Sugar

</l>
<l>Its this woman I love, she's gone from here and gone



</l>
<l>Ah, listen fair brown, don't you wanna go

</l>
<l>Ah, listen fair brown, don't you wanna go, Shuckin' Sugar

</l>
<l>Well, you take it 'cross the water, where a brown-skinned man can't

go




</l>
<l>All them worries here, worries everywhere

</l>
<l>I have worries here, worries everywhere, Shuckin' Sugar

</l>
<l>Man, I just started home and I might be worried there



</l>
<l>Well, I'm of tired of marriage, and I'm tired of this settlin'
down

</l>
<l>I said I'm tired of this marriage, tired of this settlin' down,
Shuckin' Sugar

</l>
<l>I only wanna be like I am in a different kind of town</l></lyrics></xml>
