<lyrics>



I've got your picture, and I'm going to put it in a frame

I've got your picture, I'll put it in a frame, Shuckin' Sugar

And then if you leave town, we can find you just the same



Now if you don't love me, please don't dog me around

If you don't love me, please don't dog me around, Shuckin' Sugar

Like you dog me around, I'll know you'll put me down



I know my baby, thinks she wanting all of me

I know my baby, thinks she wanting all of me, Shuckin' Sugar

Everytime she smiles, she shines a light on me



Oh big fair brown, something's goin' on wrong

Oh big fair brown is, something's goin' on wrong, Shuckin' Sugar

Its this woman I love, she's gone from here and gone



Ah, listen fair brown, don't you wanna go

Ah, listen fair brown, don't you wanna go, Shuckin' Sugar

Well, you take it 'cross the water, where a brown-skinned man can't
go



All them worries here, worries everywhere

I have worries here, worries everywhere, Shuckin' Sugar

Man, I just started home and I might be worried there



Well, I'm of tired of marriage, and I'm tired of this settlin'
down

I said I'm tired of this marriage, tired of this settlin' down,
Shuckin' Sugar

I only wanna be like I am in a different kind of town
