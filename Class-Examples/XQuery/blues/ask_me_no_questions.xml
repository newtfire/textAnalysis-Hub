<lyrics>



You go out when you get ready

And you come home when you please

You just love me when you want me baby

And you think it outta be alright with me



When I try to talk, talk to you baby

And let you know just how I feel

You tell me if I don't like it

You know someone else will



Oh, but I done got wise to you baby

You're not the only bird in the sky

Oh so don't ask me no questions now baby

And I, I won't tell you no lies



Because I like to feel arms around me

And lips close, close to mine

So I don't have to beg you to love me

I don't have to beg you all the time



Oh, but I done got wise to you baby

You're not the only bird in the sky

So now don't you ask me no questions

And you know I won't, I won't tell you no lies



Yes you can love me if you want me

Or you keep on playing the field

Because I know if you don't love me

I know there's somebody else that will
