<lyrics>


<l>You go out when you get ready

</l>
<l>And you come home when you please

</l>
<l>You just love me when you want me baby

</l>
<l>And you think it outta be alright with me



</l>
<l>When I try to talk, talk to you baby

</l>
<l>And let you know just how I feel

</l>
<l>You tell me if I don't like it

</l>
<l>You know someone else will



</l>
<l>Oh, but I done got wise to you baby

</l>
<l>You're not the only bird in the sky

</l>
<l>Oh so don't ask me no questions now baby

</l>
<l>And I, I won't tell you no lies



</l>
<l>Because I like to feel arms around me

</l>
<l>And lips close, close to mine

</l>
<l>So I don't have to beg you to love me

</l>
<l>I don't have to beg you all the time



</l>
<l>Oh, but I done got wise to you baby

</l>
<l>You're not the only bird in the sky

</l>
<l>So now don't you ask me no questions

</l>
<l>And you know I won't, I won't tell you no lies



</l>
<l>Yes you can love me if you want me

</l>
<l>Or you keep on playing the field

</l>
<l>Because I know if you don't love me

</l>
<l>I know there's somebody else that will</l></lyrics></xml>
