<lyrics>



Tell me, milk cow, what on earth is wrong with you?

Ooo ooo eee, milk cow, what on earth is wrong with you?

Now, you have a little calf, hoo hoo, and your milk is turnin'
blue



Now, your calf is hungry, I believe he needs a suck

Now, your calf is hungry, hoo hoo, I believe he needs a suck

But your milk is turnin' blue, hoo hoo, I believe he's outta luck



Now, I feel like milkin' and my, cow won't come

I feel like churnin' it and my, milk won't turn

I'm cryin', please, please, don't do me wrong

If you see my milk cow, baby, now-how, please, drive her home



My milk cow been 
ramblin'
,
hoo hee, for miles around

My milk cow been ramblin', hoo hoo, for miles around

Well, now, can you suck on some other man's bull cow,

hoo hoo, in this strange man's town
