<lyrics>


<l>Tell me, milk cow, what on earth is wrong with you?

</l>
<l>Ooo ooo eee, milk cow, what on earth is wrong with you?

</l>
<l>Now, you have a little calf, hoo hoo, and your milk is turnin'

blue




</l>
<l>Now, your calf is hungry, I believe he needs a suck

</l>
<l>Now, your calf is hungry, hoo hoo, I believe he needs a suck

</l>
<l>But your milk is turnin' blue, hoo hoo, I believe he's outta luck



</l>
<l>Now, I feel like milkin' and my, cow won't come

</l>
<l>I feel like churnin' it and my, milk won't turn

</l>
<l>I'm cryin', please, please, don't do me wrong

</l>
<l>If you see my milk cow, baby, now-how, please, drive her home



</l>
<l>My milk cow been 

ramblin'
,
hoo hee, for miles around


</l>
<l>My milk cow been ramblin', hoo hoo, for miles around

</l>
<l>Well, now, can you suck on some other man's bull cow,

</l>
<l>hoo hoo, in this strange man's town</l></lyrics></xml>
