<lyrics>


<l>I miss the arms that used to hold me

</l>
<l>The tender way we used to kiss

</l>
<l>I miss the way that you touch me

</l>
<l>I miss the sweet taste of your lips



</l>
<l>I was a fool to ever leave you

</l>
<l>You were a fool to let me go

</l>
<l>Oh it's so lonesome, lonesome here with out you

</l>
<l>Oh how I miss you so



</l>
<l>It hurt, it hurt, it hurt so bad

</l>
<l>You were the best man I ever had

</l>
<l>Why was I so blind to see?

</l>
<l>Now the biggest fool is me



</l>
<l>I miss the arms that used to hold me

</l>
<l>The tender way we used to kiss

</l>
<l>Ooo, yes, ooo, I miss the way that you touch me

</l>
<l>I miss the sweet taste of your lips



</l>
<l>It hurt, it hurt, it hurt so bad
