<lyrics>



I miss the arms that used to hold me

The tender way we used to kiss

I miss the way that you touch me

I miss the sweet taste of your lips



I was a fool to ever leave you

You were a fool to let me go

Oh it's so lonesome, lonesome here with out you

Oh how I miss you so



It hurt, it hurt, it hurt so bad

You were the best man I ever had

Why was I so blind to see?

Now the biggest fool is me



I miss the arms that used to hold me

The tender way we used to kiss

Ooo, yes, ooo, I miss the way that you touch me

I miss the sweet taste of your lips



It hurt, it hurt, it hurt so bad

'Cause, ooh, you were the best man I ever, ever, ever had

Why was I so blind to see

And now the biggest fool is me



Oh Oh what a fool I was darlin', yes

And oh you were a fool to let, let me go, why did you let me go?

It's so lonesome here with out you

Oh how I miss you so



Oh Oh now yes

Don't do it, don't do it, don't do it oh lord no!

I miss you oh yeah!

Come back Oh! come back to me, yes

Oh how I miss you

Oh I miss you so

Oh Oh Lordy, Lordy, Lordy ooh

Don't do it, Oh! Come on baby Come back to me

Oh how I miss you so

How I miss you so

Oh,oh,oh,ooooo, Lord now



Oh I miss you baby
