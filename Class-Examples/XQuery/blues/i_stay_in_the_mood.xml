<lyrics>


<l>Yeah, I stay in the mood for you, 'cause I just can't help
myself

</l>
<l>Yeah, I stay in the mood for you, 'cause I just can't help myself

</l>
<l>You've always fooling around, givin' my love to somebody else



</l>
<l>Still I stay in the mood for you and I can see you everywhere I
go

</l>
<l>Still I stay in the mood for you and I can see you everywhere I
go

</l>
<l>Well, if something soon don't happen, my heart is gonna break I

know




</l>
<l>Well, you said that you love me, you've sworn that you'll be true

</l>
<l>But now you're tellin' stronger, that I'm just a fool you know

</l>
<l>But I stay in the mood for you, 'cause I just can't help myself

</l>
<l>Please come back to me baby, 'cause I'm tired of livin' by myself</l></lyrics></xml>
