<lyrics>



Yeah, I stay in the mood for you, 'cause I just can't help
myself

Yeah, I stay in the mood for you, 'cause I just can't help myself

You've always fooling around, givin' my love to somebody else



Still I stay in the mood for you and I can see you everywhere I
go

Still I stay in the mood for you and I can see you everywhere I
go

Well, if something soon don't happen, my heart is gonna break I
know



Well, you said that you love me, you've sworn that you'll be true

But now you're tellin' stronger, that I'm just a fool you know

But I stay in the mood for you, 'cause I just can't help myself

Please come back to me baby, 'cause I'm tired of livin' by myself
