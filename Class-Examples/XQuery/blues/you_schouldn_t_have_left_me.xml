<lyrics>


<l>You shouldn't have left me, baby

</l>
<l>Baby, you shouldn't have gone away

</l>
<l>Oh, you shouldn't have left me, baby

</l>
<l>Baby, you shouldn't have gone away

</l>
<l>Oh, you left the one that love you, woman

</l>
<l>Cryin' every night and every day



</l>
<l>Someone that you love more, baby

</l>
<l>Made you break my heart in two

</l>
<l>Someone that you love more, baby

</l>
<l>Made you break my heart in two

</l>
<l>I want you to remember, baby

</l>
<l>The same thing could happen to you



</l>
<l>When the pains in your heart, woman

</l>
<l>Make you feel like you could die

</l>
<l>Oh, when the pains, the pains in your heart, baby

</l>
<l>Make you feel like you could die

</l>
<l>Oh, you'll know then that you shouldn't have left me, woman

</l>
<l>Baby, and how it feels to say goodbye</l></lyrics></xml>
