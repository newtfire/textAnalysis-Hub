<lyrics>



I always live by the, golden rule

Whatever happens, ha, don't blow your cool!

You gotta have nerves of steel

And never show folks how you, honestly feel



I lived all my life this way, ha

For example, take yesterday:



I breeze home happy bringin' her my pay

Her note read ...so long savvy, I haven't gone away!

An' I threw myself down across our empty bed

An' this is what I said:



Ooo shhhhiiiii ooow ooow ooow

What? Oh what are you gonna do with me?

Ooo wow uh

But I was cool!



So I "one for the roaded" at a all night bar

I wound up so loaded, I tore up my car

The judge threw the book at me,

An' when I read, the sentence there, I said:



"Oow! Please oooow ooow, please I got to know, I got to know

What? what went wrong?

I don't underst... I oh a,

But I was cool!



So I said she's the only one, that I have to pay

And I found her an' pulled my gun, an' fired point blank

The shot whistled right past that woman's head

An' I killed my hound dog, dead!



Oooooow, ruff ruff, rrr, rrr, rrr, rur, rur, rur

As they carried me away

I was overheard to say,

"Be cool, be cool, stay cool, be cool!"
