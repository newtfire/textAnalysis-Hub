<lyrics>


<l>I always live by the, golden rule

</l>
<l>Whatever happens, ha, don't blow your cool!

</l>
<l>You gotta have nerves of steel

</l>
<l>And never show folks how you, honestly feel



</l>
<l>I lived all my life this way, ha

</l>
<l>For example, take yesterday:



</l>
<l>I breeze home happy bringin' her my pay

</l>
<l>Her note read ...so long savvy, I haven't gone away!

</l>
<l>An' I threw myself down across our empty bed

</l>
<l>An' this is what I said:



</l>
<l>Ooo shhhhiiiii ooow ooow ooow

</l>
<l>What? Oh what are you gonna do with me?

</l>
<l>Ooo wow uh

</l>
<l>But I was cool!



</l>
<l>So I "one for the roaded" at a all night bar

</l>
<l>I wound up so loaded, I tore up my car

</l>
<l>The judge threw the book at me,

</l>
<l>An' when I read, the sentence there, I said:



</l>
<l>"Oow! Please oooow ooow, please I got to know, I got to know

</l>
<l>What? what went wrong?

</l>
<l>I don't underst... I oh a,

</l>
<l>But I was cool!



</l>
<l>So I said she's the only one, that I have to pay

</l>
<l>And I found her an' pulled my gun, an' fired point blank

</l>
<l>The shot whistled right past that woman's head

</l>
<l>An' I killed my hound dog, dead!



</l>
<l>Oooooow, ruff ruff, rrr, rrr, rrr, rur, rur, rur

</l>
<l>As they carried me away

</l>
<l>I was overheard to say,

</l><l>"Be cool, be cool, stay cool, be cool!"</l></lyrics></xml>
