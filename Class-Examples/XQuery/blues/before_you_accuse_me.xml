<lyrics>



Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself

Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself

You say I've been buyin' another woman clothes, but you've been
talkin' to someone else



I called your mama, 'bout three or four nights ago

I called your mama, 'bout three or four nights ago

Your mama said, "Son, don't call my daughter no more"



Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself

Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself

You say I've been buyin' another woman clothes, but you've been
takin' money from someone else



Come on back home, baby; try my love one more time

Come on back home, baby; try my love one more time

You've been gone away so long, I'm just about to lose my mind
