<l>Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself

</l>
<l>Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself

</l>
<l>You say I've been buyin' another woman clothes, but you've been

talkin' to someone else




</l>
<l>I called your mama, 'bout three or four nights ago

</l>
<l>I called your mama, 'bout three or four nights ago

</l>
<l>Your mama said, "Son, don't call my daughter no more"



</l>
<l>Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself

</l>
<l>Before you accuse me, take a look at yourself

</l>
<l>You say I've been buyin' another woman clothes, but you've been

takin' money from someone else




</l>
<l>Come on back home, baby; try my love one more time

</l>
<l>Come on back home, baby; try my love one more time

</l>
<l>You've been gone away so long, I'm just about to lose my mind</l></lyrics></xml>
