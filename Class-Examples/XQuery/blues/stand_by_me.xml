<lyrics>


<l>Whoa darlin' you've been mine so long

</l>
<l>Now that I need you, I'm so all alone, whoa whoa

</l>
<l>I need you darlin' and stand by me, stand by me



</l>
<l>Well all of my money, my friends have gone

</l>
<l>At night I'm calling I want you to, come back home, whoa whoa

</l>
<l>I need you darlin' and stand by me, stand by me



</l>
<l>Well, sometimes I feel that all of my tryin' was all in vain

</l>
<l>I don't think I can last much longer, 'till I see your face again,

whoa whoa




</l>
<l>If I could just, hold your hand and I know that you would,
understand

</l>
<l>Whoa, whoa, I need you darlin' and stand by me, stand by me



</l>
<l>Well sometimes I feel that all a my tryin', was all in vain

</l>
<l>I don't think I can last much longer, 'till I see your face again,

whoa whoa




</l>
<l>If I could just hold your hand, and I know that you would
a-understand

</l>
<l>Whoa whoa, I need you darlin' and stand by me, stand by me



</l>
<l>When I'm sick darlin', I want ya to stand by me

</l>
<l>Early in the mo'nin', stand by me

</l>
<l>Gettin' late in the evenin', stand by me

</l>
<l>When all of my money's gone, stand by me

</l>
<l>Stand by me</l></lyrics></xml>
