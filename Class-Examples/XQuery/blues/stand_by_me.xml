<lyrics>



Whoa darlin' you've been mine so long

Now that I need you, I'm so all alone, whoa whoa

I need you darlin' and stand by me, stand by me



Well all of my money, my friends have gone

At night I'm calling I want you to, come back home, whoa whoa

I need you darlin' and stand by me, stand by me



Well, sometimes I feel that all of my tryin' was all in vain

I don't think I can last much longer, 'till I see your face again,
whoa whoa



If I could just, hold your hand and I know that you would,
understand

Whoa, whoa, I need you darlin' and stand by me, stand by me



Well sometimes I feel that all a my tryin', was all in vain

I don't think I can last much longer, 'till I see your face again,
whoa whoa



If I could just hold your hand, and I know that you would
a-understand

Whoa whoa, I need you darlin' and stand by me, stand by me



When I'm sick darlin', I want ya to stand by me

Early in the mo'nin', stand by me

Gettin' late in the evenin', stand by me

When all of my money's gone, stand by me

Stand by me
