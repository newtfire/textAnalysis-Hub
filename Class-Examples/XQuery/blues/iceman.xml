<lyrics>


<l>I'm your iceman, baby, ain't here to cool you down

</l>
<l>Yes I'm your iceman, ladies, you'll always know when I'm around

</l>
<l>I left Leona, Texas, to heat this coolest place in town



</l>
<l>Gonna play this old guitar, mix up some fire with my ice

</l>
<l>Yes, I'm gonna play this old guitar, light your fire with my ice

</l>
<l>Sometimes it sounds so good to me, I just might play it twice



</l>
<l>I'm your iceman, baby, call me Al, if you please

</l>
<l>I'm your iceman, baby, I'm so hot I'll probably freeze

</l>
<l>I'm gonna whip up a twister, turn tornados to a breeze



</l>
<l>Yes, I'm your iceman, baby



</l>
<l>Yes, I'm your iceman, people, fixin' fire with my ice

</l>
<l>I'm your iceman, ladies, I make it hot an' chill it right

</l>
<l>If you follow my instructions, my ice will last all night</l></lyrics></xml>
