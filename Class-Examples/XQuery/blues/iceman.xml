<lyrics>



I'm your iceman, baby, ain't here to cool you down

Yes I'm your iceman, ladies, you'll always know when I'm around

I left Leona, Texas, to heat this coolest place in town



Gonna play this old guitar, mix up some fire with my ice

Yes, I'm gonna play this old guitar, light your fire with my ice

Sometimes it sounds so good to me, I just might play it twice



I'm your iceman, baby, call me Al, if you please

I'm your iceman, baby, I'm so hot I'll probably freeze

I'm gonna whip up a twister, turn tornados to a breeze



Yes, I'm your iceman, baby



Yes, I'm your iceman, people, fixin' fire with my ice

I'm your iceman, ladies, I make it hot an' chill it right

If you follow my instructions, my ice will last all night
