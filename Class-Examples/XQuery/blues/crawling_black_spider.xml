<lyrics>



Crawlin' black spider baby, and I rules my den

I'm a crawlin' black spider baby, and I rules my den

Don't want you around my mate, want you'self for
myself
1



You know you caught me crawlin' baby when the, when the grass was
very high

I'm just gonna keep on crawlin' baby, until the day I die,

because I'm a crawlin' black spider baby, and I rules my den

Don't want you around my mate, wanna use her for
myself
1

Yeah, play the blues now!

Hmm, ahw-ahw, ahw-ahw, ahw-ahw

Shu' now baby, shu' now darlin'



You know I'm gon' crawl up to your window baby,

wanna crawl up on your floor, you got anything I want baby,

wanna crawl up on your floor

Because I'm a crawlin' black spider baby, and I rules my den

Don't want you hangin' around my mate, wanna use her for
myself
1



__________

Note 1: alternate text, wanna use her for myself instead of want
you'self for myself
