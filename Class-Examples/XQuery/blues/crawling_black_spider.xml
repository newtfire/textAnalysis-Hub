<lyrics>

<l>Crawlin' black spider baby, and I rules my den

</l>
<l>I'm a crawlin' black spider baby, and I rules my den

</l>
<l>Don't want you around my mate, want you'self for
myself
1



</l>
<l>You know you caught me crawlin' baby when the, when the grass was
very high

</l>
<l>I'm just gonna keep on crawlin' baby, until the day I die,

</l>
<l>because I'm a crawlin' black spider baby, and I rules my den

</l>
<l>Don't want you around my mate, wanna use her for
myself
1

</l>
<l>Yeah, play the blues now!

</l>
<l>Hmm, ahw-ahw, ahw-ahw, ahw-ahw

</l>
<l>Shu' now baby, shu' now darlin'



</l>
<l>You know I'm gon' crawl up to your window baby,

</l>
<l>wanna crawl up on your floor, you got anything I want baby,

</l>
<l>wanna crawl up on your floor

</l>
<l>Because I'm a crawlin' black spider baby, and I rules my den

</l>
<l>Don't want you hangin' around my mate, wanna use her for
myself
