<lyrics>



I got stones in my passway, and my road seem dark as night

I got stones in my passway, and my road seem dark as night

I have pains in my heart, they have taken my appetite



I have a bird to whistle, and I have a bird to sing

Have a bird to whistle, and I have a bird to sing

I got a woman that I'm lovin', boy, but she don't mean a thing



My enemies have betrayed me, have overtaken poor Bob at last

My enemies have betrayed me, have overtaken poor Bob at last

And there's one thing certainly
1
, they have stones all in
my pass



Now you tryin' to take my life, and all my lovin' too

You laid a passway for me, now what are you trying to do?

I'm cryin' please, please let us be friends

And when you hear me howlin' in my passway, 
rider
,
please open your door and let me in



I got three lane's
2
 to truck home, boys, please don't
block my road

I got three lane's
2
 to truck home, boys, please don't
block my road

I've been feelin' ashamed 'bout my rider, babe, I'm booked and I got
to go
