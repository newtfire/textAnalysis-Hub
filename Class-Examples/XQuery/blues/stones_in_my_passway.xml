<lyrics>

<l>I got stones in my passway, and my road seem dark as night

</l>
<l>I got stones in my passway, and my road seem dark as night

</l>
<l>I have pains in my heart, they have taken my appetite



</l>
<l>I have a bird to whistle, and I have a bird to sing

</l>
<l>Have a bird to whistle, and I have a bird to sing

</l>
<l>I got a woman that I'm lovin', boy, but she don't mean a thing



</l>
<l>My enemies have betrayed me, have overtaken poor Bob at last

</l>
<l>My enemies have betrayed me, have overtaken poor Bob at last

</l>
<l>And there's one thing certainly
1
, they have stones all in
my pass



</l>
<l>Now you tryin' to take my life, and all my lovin' too

</l>
<l>You laid a passway for me, now what are you trying to do?

</l>
<l>I'm cryin' please, please let us be friends

</l>
<l>And when you hear me howlin' in my passway, 
rider
,
please open your door and let me in



</l>
<l>I got three lane's
2
 </l><l>to truck home, boys, please don't</l>
<l>block my road

</l>
<l>I got three lane's
2
 </l><l>to truck home, boys, please don't</l>
<l>block my road

</l>
<l>I've been feelin' ashamed 'bout my rider, babe, I'm booked and I got
to go
