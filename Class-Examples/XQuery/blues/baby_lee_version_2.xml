<lyrics>



Hmm

Baby Lee, please don't do me wrong

Baby Lee, please don't do me wrong

I love you gal,

always treat me wrong,

always treat me mean



Baby Lee, please don't do me wrong

Baby Lee, please don't do me wrong

I Love you baby,

always treat me mean



Takin' me downtown baby, carried me through the mill

Takin' me downtown baby, carried me through the mill

Get back home, treat me like a child, Baby Lee



Baby Lee, please don't do me wrong

Baby Lee, please don't do me wrong

I love you gal, hmmm
