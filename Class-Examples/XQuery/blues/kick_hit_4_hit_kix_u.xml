<lyrics>


<l>Look-a here, I'm gon' tell you a story

</l>
<l>About two friends, whom I known

</l>
<l>And the whole world know'd 'em

</l>
<l>The one and only, Jimi Hendrix, and Janis Joplin

</l>
<l>Who passed on, from the needle

</l>
<l>They o.d.'d

</l>
<l>Ah what a big loss,

</l>
<l>to this wonderful world

</l>
<l>'s sad



</l>
<l>Dope addicts, dope addicts

</l>
<l>You better watch yourself

</l>
<l>Dope addicts, dope addicts

</l>
<l>You got to watch yourself

</l>
<l>You one of these days, one of these days

</l>
<l>You might pass on

</l>
<l>Stop shootin' no needle,

</l>
<l>and stop swallowin' that LSD

</l>
<l>Stop shootin' no needles,

</l>
<l>and stop swallowin' in those pills

</l>
<l>That needle's too heavy,

</l>
<l>your heart can't take it none

</l>
<l>Hey hey

</l>
<l>I know, so many young folks,

</l>
<l>they're hooked, they're doomed to die

</l>
<l>So many young folks,

</l>
<l>they're hooked, they're doomed to die

</l>
<l>You better try and kick it,

</l>
<l>but you can't last long this way

</l>
<l>Yeah



</l>
<l>Drug addict, drug addict

</l>
<l>You better wake up and get wise

</l>
<l>Drug addict, drug addict

</l>
<l>You better wake up and get wise

</l>
<l>Your days are numbered, your days are numbered

</l>
<l>Your day you just don't know

</l>
<l>You better try and kick it

</l>
<l>You better try and kick it

</l>
<l>That needle is too heavy for ya

</l>
<l>It's too heavy

</l>
<l>Hey, it's too heavy

</l>
<l>It's too heavy for your heart, for your heart

</l>
<l>Hey hey

</l>
<l>It's too heavy

</l>
<l>It's too heavy

</l>
<l>You better kick it right now

</l>
<l>I know you better kick it

</l>
<l>I know it's hard

</l>
<l>You better suffer and kick it

</l>
<l>You better suffer and kick it

</l>
<l>You got to suffer some

</l>
<l>To kick

</l>
<l>Hey, it's too heavy for you</l></lyrics></xml>
