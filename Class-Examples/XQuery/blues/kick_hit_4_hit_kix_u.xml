<lyrics>



Look-a here, I'm gon' tell you a story

About two friends, whom I known

And the whole world know'd 'em

The one and only, Jimi Hendrix, and Janis Joplin

Who passed on, from the needle

They o.d.'d

Ah what a big loss,

to this wonderful world

's sad



Dope addicts, dope addicts

You better watch yourself

Dope addicts, dope addicts

You got to watch yourself

You one of these days, one of these days

You might pass on

Stop shootin' no needle,

and stop swallowin' that LSD

Stop shootin' no needles,

and stop swallowin' in those pills

That needle's too heavy,

your heart can't take it none

Hey hey

I know, so many young folks,

they're hooked, they're doomed to die

So many young folks,

they're hooked, they're doomed to die

You better try and kick it,

but you can't last long this way

Yeah



Drug addict, drug addict

You better wake up and get wise

Drug addict, drug addict

You better wake up and get wise

Your days are numbered, your days are numbered

Your day you just don't know

You better try and kick it

You better try and kick it

That needle is too heavy for ya

It's too heavy

Hey, it's too heavy

It's too heavy for your heart, for your heart

Hey hey

It's too heavy

It's too heavy

You better kick it right now

I know you better kick it

I know it's hard

You better suffer and kick it

You better suffer and kick it

You got to suffer some

To kick

Hey, it's too heavy for you
