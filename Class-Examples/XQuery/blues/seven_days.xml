<lyrics>



I got four days to love my baby, three days to leave yours
alone

I got four days to love my baby, three days to leave yours alone



That's why I say nothin', hear nothin', see nothin', I don't know
nothin'

I got four days to love my baby and three days to leave yours
alone



I says on Monday mornin' she brings my breakfast to my bed

Tuesday, she rubs my achin' head

Wednesday, she squeeze me with all her might

Thursday, she makes ev'rything all right



That's why I say nothin', hear nothin', see nothin', I don't know
nothin'

I got four days to love my baby and three days to leave yours
alone



I says on Fridays, she brings me all her pay

Saturday, we go out to play

Sunday, we go to church

Be around when I need a break



That's why I got four days to love my baby

I got three days, to leave yours alone

I got four days to love my baby

I got three days, to leave yours alone



She make me shout, oh shout!

In the mornin', she makes me shout!

In the evenin', she makes me shout!

Ev'ryday now, she makes me shout!

Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo!



Shout, I wanna shout

My baby, she makes me shout

My baby, she makes me shout

Ev'ryday now, she makes me shout

My baby, she makes me shout

Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo!



Shout! gonna shout

Shout! gonna shout

Ev'ryday now, I come in

I gotta have my baby

I'm gonna shout

Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo!

Fading:

Woo, woo, woo, woo
