<lyrics>


<l>I got four days to love my baby, three days to leave yours
alone

</l>
<l>I got four days to love my baby, three days to leave yours alone



</l>
<l>That's why I say nothin', hear nothin', see nothin', I don't know
nothin'

</l>
<l>I got four days to love my baby and three days to leave yours

alone




</l>
<l>I says on Monday mornin' she brings my breakfast to my bed

</l>
<l>Tuesday, she rubs my achin' head

</l>
<l>Wednesday, she squeeze me with all her might

</l>
<l>Thursday, she makes ev'rything all right



</l>
<l>That's why I say nothin', hear nothin', see nothin', I don't know
nothin'

</l>
<l>I got four days to love my baby and three days to leave yours

alone




</l>
<l>I says on Fridays, she brings me all her pay

</l>
<l>Saturday, we go out to play

</l>
<l>Sunday, we go to church

</l>
<l>Be around when I need a break



</l>
<l>That's why I got four days to love my baby

</l>
<l>I got three days, to leave yours alone

</l>
<l>I got four days to love my baby

</l>
<l>I got three days, to leave yours alone



</l>
<l>She make me shout, oh shout!

</l>
<l>In the mornin', she makes me shout!

</l>
<l>In the evenin', she makes me shout!

</l>
<l>Ev'ryday now, she makes me shout!

</l>
<l>Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo!



</l>
<l>Shout, I wanna shout

</l>
<l>My baby, she makes me shout

</l>
<l>My baby, she makes me shout

</l>
<l>Ev'ryday now, she makes me shout

</l>
<l>My baby, she makes me shout

</l>
<l>Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo!



</l>
<l>Shout! gonna shout

</l>
<l>Shout! gonna shout

</l>
<l>Ev'ryday now, I come in

</l>
<l>I gotta have my baby

</l>
<l>I'm gonna shout

</l>
<l>Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo!

</l>
<l>Fading:

</l>
<l>Woo, woo, woo, woo</l></lyrics></xml>
