<lyrics>



I got the key to the highway,

dear Lord, I'm bound to go

I'm gonna roam this highway, untill the day I die



Yes, when the moon peep o'er the mountain,

honey, I'll be on my way

I'm gonna roam this higway until the day I die



Just give me one, one more kiss, babe,

baby, just before I go

Because I'm leavin' this mornin', I won't be back no more



So I said, "So long, so long baby",

honey, I must say goodbye

'Cause when I leave this time, I won't be back no mo'



Give me the key, key to the highway,

I'm movin' on down the line

'Cause when I leave this time, I won't be back no more



Just give me one, one last kiss, baby,

hold me in your lovin' arms

Because when I leave this time, I won't be back no more
