<lyrics>


<l>I don't know what's wrong with me

</l>
<l>I've been foolish as a fool can be

</l>
<l>Baby, I can't sleep at night and I lost my appetite



</l>
<l>Went to the doctor but he don't know

</l>
<l>It's getting

</l>
<l>Tell me baby what I might gonna do



</l>
<l>I believe I'm in love with you

</l>
<l>I believe I'm in love with you

</l>
<l>Tell me baby that you love me, too

</l>
<l>I can't fight, baby I decided

</l>
<l>I'm in love with you



</l>
<l>I guess this time I realize

</l>
<l>For you baby I got eyes

</l>
<l>Come on baby and give me a chance

</l>
<l>All I need is your romance

</l>
<l>You know what I'm tryin' to fight

</l>
<l>I'm telling you baby I'll be true



</l>
<l>I believe I'm in love with you

</l>
<l>I believe I'm in love with you

</l>
<l>Tell me baby that you love me, too

</l>
<l>I can't fight, baby I decided

</l>
<l>I'm in love with you</l></lyrics></xml>
