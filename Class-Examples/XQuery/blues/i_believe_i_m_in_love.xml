<lyrics>



I don't know what's wrong with me

I've been foolish as a fool can be

Baby, I can't sleep at night and I lost my appetite



Went to the doctor but he don't know

It's getting

Tell me baby what I might gonna do



I believe I'm in love with you

I believe I'm in love with you

Tell me baby that you love me, too

I can't fight, baby I decided

I'm in love with you



I guess this time I realize

For you baby I got eyes

Come on baby and give me a chance

All I need is your romance

You know what I'm tryin' to fight

I'm telling you baby I'll be true



I believe I'm in love with you

I believe I'm in love with you

Tell me baby that you love me, too

I can't fight, baby I decided

I'm in love with you
