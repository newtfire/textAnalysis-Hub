<lyrics>


<l>Honey baby, won't you cuddle near,

</l>
<l>just sweet mama whisper in your ear

</l>
<l>I'm wild about that thing, it makes me laugh and sing,

</l>
<l>give it to me papa, I'm wild about that thing



</l>
<l>Do it easy, honey, don't get rough,

</l>
<l>from you, papa, I can't get enough

</l>
<l>I'm wild about that thing, I'm wild about that thing,

</l>
<l>everybody knows it, I'm wild about that thing



</l>
<l>Please don't hold it, baby, when I cry,

</l>
<l>give me every bit of it or else I'll die

</l>
<l>I'm wild about that thing, ja da ging ging ging,

</l>
<l>all the time I'm cryin', I'm wild about that thing



</l>
<l>What's the matter, papa, please don't stop,

</l>
<l>don't you know I love it and I want it all?

</l>
<l>I'm wild about that thing, just give my bell a ring,

</l>
<l>you touched my button, I'm wild about that thing



</l>
<l>If you want so satisfy my soul,

</l>
<l>come on and rock me with a steady roll

</l>
<l>I'm wild about that thing, gee I like your ting-a-ling,

</l>
<l>kiss me like you mean it, I'm wild about that thing



</l>
<l>Come on turn the lights down low,

</l>
<l>say you're ready, just say let's go

</l>
<l>I'm wild about that thing, I'm wild about that thing,

</l>
<l>come on and make me feel it, I'm wild about that thing



</l>
<l>I'm wild about it when you hold me tight,

</l>
<l>let me linger in your arms all night

</l>
<l>I'm wild about that thing, my passions got the fling,

</l>
<l>come on, hear me cryin', I'm wild about that thing</l></lyrics></xml>
