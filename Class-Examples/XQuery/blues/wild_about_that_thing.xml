<lyrics>



Honey baby, won't you cuddle near,

just sweet mama whisper in your ear

I'm wild about that thing, it makes me laugh and sing,

give it to me papa, I'm wild about that thing



Do it easy, honey, don't get rough,

from you, papa, I can't get enough

I'm wild about that thing, I'm wild about that thing,

everybody knows it, I'm wild about that thing



Please don't hold it, baby, when I cry,

give me every bit of it or else I'll die

I'm wild about that thing, ja da ging ging ging,

all the time I'm cryin', I'm wild about that thing



What's the matter, papa, please don't stop,

don't you know I love it and I want it all?

I'm wild about that thing, just give my bell a ring,

you touched my button, I'm wild about that thing



If you want so satisfy my soul,

come on and rock me with a steady roll

I'm wild about that thing, gee I like your ting-a-ling,

kiss me like you mean it, I'm wild about that thing



Come on turn the lights down low,

say you're ready, just say let's go

I'm wild about that thing, I'm wild about that thing,

come on and make me feel it, I'm wild about that thing



I'm wild about it when you hold me tight,

let me linger in your arms all night

I'm wild about that thing, my passions got the fling,

come on, hear me cryin', I'm wild about that thing
