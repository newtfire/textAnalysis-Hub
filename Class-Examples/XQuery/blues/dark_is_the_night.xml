Part 1:



Blues has got me, there is teardrops in my eyes

Yes the blues has got me, there is teardrops in my eyes

Well dark is the night, since my baby said goodbye



Oh how I've suffered since my baby went away

Yes how I've suffered since my baby went away

And I've got that feeling that my baby's gone to stay



Take me back baby, forgive me for the wrong I've done

Yes take me back darling, forgive me for the wrong I've done

Well I know I love you, and you're the only one



Yes talk to me baby, call me on the telephone

Yeah talk to me baby, call me on the telephone

Yes the blues has got me, and I want my baby home



Yes if your baby love you, keep her home and treat her nice

Oh if your baby love you, you better keep her home and treat her
nice

Well never mistreat a good woman, this is some doggone good
advice



Part 2:



Yes it's been so long since I've seen my baby's face

Well it's been so long since I've seen my baby's face

I'm tellin' you people, no one else can ever take her place



Yes the doorbell is ringing, I know there must be somethin' wrong

Yes the doorbell is ringing, I know it must be somethin' wrong

Well look-a here it's my baby, she's done changed her mind and come
home



So hurry baby, come on in and close the door

Yes hurry baby, come on in and close the door

Let me put my arms around you baby, so my nights won't be dark no
more
