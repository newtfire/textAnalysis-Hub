</l>
<l>Oh how I've suffered since my baby went away

</l>
<l>Yes how I've suffered since my baby went away

</l>
<l>And I've got that feeling that my baby's gone to stay



</l>
<l>Take me back baby, forgive me for the wrong I've done

</l>
<l>Yes take me back darling, forgive me for the wrong I've done

</l>
<l>Well I know I love you, and you're the only one



</l>
<l>Yes talk to me baby, call me on the telephone

</l>
<l>Yeah talk to me baby, call me on the telephone
