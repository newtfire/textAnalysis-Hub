<lyrics>



You talk too much, you talk too much,

I can't believe the things that you say everyday

If you keep on talking baby,

you know you're bound to drive me away



Now you get on the telephone with your girlfriend,

your conversation baby ain't got no end

Yakety-yakety-yakety-yak all the time,

you keep on talking baby drive me out of my mind

You talk too much,

I can't believe the things that you say everyday

If you keep on talking baby,

you know you're bound to drive me away



Well I laid out in the afternoon I start to nappin',

you walk into the room with them jaws a-flappin'

You keep that motormouth moving morning, noon and night,

you keep on talking baby make my head turn white

You talk too much,

I can't believe the things that you say everyday

If you keep on talking baby,

you know you're bound just to drive me away



I think you're trying to put me through some kind of test,

I'm begging you baby won't you give it a rest

You talk about people that you don't even know,

keep it up baby I'm gonna pick up and blow

You talk too much,

I can't believe the things that you say everyday

If you keep on talking baby,

you know you're bound to drive me away



Don't get me wrong baby I don't mean to complain,

but if you keep on talking you're gonna drive me insane

You keep on talking all around the clock,

I'm begging you baby won't you please stop

You talk too much,

I can't believe the things that you say everyday

If you keep on talking baby,

you know you're bound to drive me away
