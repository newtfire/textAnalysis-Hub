<lyrics>


<l>You talk too much, you talk too much,

</l>
<l>I can't believe the things that you say everyday

</l>
<l>If you keep on talking baby,

</l>
<l>you know you're bound to drive me away



</l>
<l>Now you get on the telephone with your girlfriend,

</l>
<l>your conversation baby ain't got no end

</l>
<l>Yakety-yakety-yakety-yak all the time,

</l>
<l>you keep on talking baby drive me out of my mind

</l>
<l>You talk too much,

</l>
<l>I can't believe the things that you say everyday

</l>
<l>If you keep on talking baby,

</l>
<l>you know you're bound to drive me away



</l>
<l>Well I laid out in the afternoon I start to nappin',

</l>
<l>you walk into the room with them jaws a-flappin'

</l>
<l>You keep that motormouth moving morning, noon and night,

</l>
<l>you keep on talking baby make my head turn white

</l>
<l>You talk too much,

</l>
<l>I can't believe the things that you say everyday

</l>
<l>If you keep on talking baby,

</l>
<l>you know you're bound just to drive me away



</l>
<l>I think you're trying to put me through some kind of test,

</l>
<l>I'm begging you baby won't you give it a rest

</l>
<l>You talk about people that you don't even know,

</l>
<l>keep it up baby I'm gonna pick up and blow

</l>
<l>You talk too much,

</l>
<l>I can't believe the things that you say everyday

</l>
<l>If you keep on talking baby,

</l>
<l>you know you're bound to drive me away



</l>
<l>Don't get me wrong baby I don't mean to complain,

</l>
<l>but if you keep on talking you're gonna drive me insane

</l>
<l>You keep on talking all around the clock,

</l>
<l>I'm begging you baby won't you please stop

</l>
<l>You talk too much,

</l>
<l>I can't believe the things that you say everyday

</l>
<l>If you keep on talking baby,

</l>
<l>you know you're bound to drive me away</l></lyrics></xml>
