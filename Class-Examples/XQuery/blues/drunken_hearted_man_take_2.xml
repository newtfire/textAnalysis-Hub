<lyrics>


<l>I'm a drunken hearted man, my life seems so misery

</l>
<l>I'm a poor drunken hearted man, my life seems so misery

</l>
<l>And if I could only change my way of livin', it would mean so much to

me




</l>
<l>I been dogged and I been driven, ever since I left my mother's
home

</l>
<l>I been dogged and I been driven, ever since I left my mother's
home

</l>
<l>And I can't see the reason why, that I can't leave these no-good

women's alone




</l>
<l>My poor father died and left me, and my mother done the best that she
could

</l>
<l>My poor father died and left me, and my mother done the best that she
could

</l>
<l>Every man love that game you call love, but it don't mean no man no

good




</l>
<l>I'm the poor drunken hearted man, and sin was the cause of it all

</l>
<l>I'm a poor drunken hearted man, and sin was the cause of it all

</l><l>But the day you get weak for no-good women, that's the day that you</l>
<l>surely fall</l></lyrics></xml>
