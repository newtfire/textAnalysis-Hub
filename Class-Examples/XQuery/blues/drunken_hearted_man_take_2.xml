<lyrics>



I'm a drunken hearted man, my life seems so misery

I'm a poor drunken hearted man, my life seems so misery

And if I could only change my way of livin', it would mean so much to
me



I been dogged and I been driven, ever since I left my mother's
home

I been dogged and I been driven, ever since I left my mother's
home

And I can't see the reason why, that I can't leave these no-good
women's alone



My poor father died and left me, and my mother done the best that she
could

My poor father died and left me, and my mother done the best that she
could

Every man love that game you call love, but it don't mean no man no
good



I'm the poor drunken hearted man, and sin was the cause of it all

I'm a poor drunken hearted man, and sin was the cause of it all

But the day you get weak for no-good women, that's the day that you
surely fall
