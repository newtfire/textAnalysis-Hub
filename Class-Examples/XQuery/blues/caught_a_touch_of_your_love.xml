<lyrics>


<l>I'm not feeling like I usually do

</l>
<l>I think it might have something

</l>
<l>To do with you

</l>
<l>Every time you're near me

</l>
<l>My body gets hot

</l>
<l>Don't need a doctor

</l>
<l>I know what I've got



</l>
<l>Caught a touch of your love

</l>
<l>It came on overnight

</l>
<l>I must have held you too tight

</l>
<l>Last night

</l>
<l>Caught a touch of your love



</l>
<l>Your affection has affected me

</l>
<l>I'm feeling kind of dizzy

</l>
<l>And weak in the knees

</l>
<l>I've been in love before

</l>
<l>But never so bad

</l>
<l>You're in my system

</l>
<l>And it's driving me mad



</l>
<l>The fever from your kisses

</l>
<l>Tears me apart

</l>
<l>It starts from your lips

</l>
<l>And goes straight to my heart

</l>
<l>No use pretending

</l>
<l>'Cause baby, I'm sure

</l>
<l>There's no cure

</l>
<l>And I've just gotta have more</l></lyrics></xml>
