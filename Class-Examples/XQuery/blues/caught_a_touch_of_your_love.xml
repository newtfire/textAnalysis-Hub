<lyrics>



I'm not feeling like I usually do

I think it might have something

To do with you

Every time you're near me

My body gets hot

Don't need a doctor

I know what I've got



Caught a touch of your love

It came on overnight

I must have held you too tight

Last night

Caught a touch of your love



Your affection has affected me

I'm feeling kind of dizzy

And weak in the knees

I've been in love before

But never so bad

You're in my system

And it's driving me mad



The fever from your kisses

Tears me apart

It starts from your lips

And goes straight to my heart

No use pretending

'Cause baby, I'm sure

There's no cure

And I've just gotta have more
