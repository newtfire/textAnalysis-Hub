<lyrics>


<l>You and me don't see eye to eye

</l>
<l>On every little thing

</l>
<l>We've missed a lot of sunshine

</l>
<l>And caught a lot of rain

</l>
<l>If you want to leave I can't make you stay

</l>
<l>But there is something I have to say



</l>
<l>No matter how high you get

</l>
<l>Or how low you go

</l>
<l>There's one thing darling

</l>
<l>You ought to know



</l>
<l>There's a world full of strangers out there

</l>
<l>A world full of strangers

</l>
<l>Beware

</l>
<l>There's a world full of strangers out there

</l>
<l>And if it gets too strange

</l>
<l>Just come on home



</l>
<l>Restless hearts, looking for a love

</l>
<l>Are waiting in the street

</l>
<l>They're all prepared to give you

</l>
<l>The bitter with the sweet

</l>
<l>If you wake someday and you reach for me

</l>
<l>Well you know, this is where I'll be



</l>
<l>No matter how high you get

</l>
<l>Or how low you go

</l>
<l>There's one thing darling

</l>
<l>You ought to know



</l>
<l>There's a world full of strangers out there

</l>
<l>A world full of strangers

</l>
<l>Beware

</l>
<l>There's a world full of strangers out there

</l>
<l>And if it gets too strange

</l>
<l>Just come on home</l></lyrics></xml>
