<lyrics>



You and me don't see eye to eye

On every little thing

We've missed a lot of sunshine

And caught a lot of rain

If you want to leave I can't make you stay

But there is something I have to say



No matter how high you get

Or how low you go

There's one thing darling

You ought to know



There's a world full of strangers out there

A world full of strangers

Beware

There's a world full of strangers out there

And if it gets too strange

Just come on home



Restless hearts, looking for a love

Are waiting in the street

They're all prepared to give you

The bitter with the sweet

If you wake someday and you reach for me

Well you know, this is where I'll be



No matter how high you get

Or how low you go

There's one thing darling

You ought to know



There's a world full of strangers out there

A world full of strangers

Beware

There's a world full of strangers out there

And if it gets too strange

Just come on home
