<lyrics>



Well, my baby walked off, she musta layed down and died

Well, my baby walked off, she musta layed down and died

Lord, I wish she was here, layin' up by my side



Well, I'm so doggone worried, I can't be satisfied

Well, I'm so doggone worried, can't be satisfied

Well, the woman walked off from me, boy, she musta walked off and
died



I'm gonna call the highway man, tell him, my baby musta been out and
died

I'm gonna call the highway man an tell him, my baby done walked off
and died

Please find my baby, cause then I'm satisfied



Well she just walked off, know she's just my kind

Well she just walked off, know she's just my kind

Lord, I'm crazy 'bout the woman, she done walked off an died
