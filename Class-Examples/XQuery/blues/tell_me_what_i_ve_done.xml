<lyrics>



Oh you said I hurt your feelings, but you won't tell me what I
done

Oh you said I hurt your feelings, but you won't tell me what I
done

And if I done hurt your feelings, some kinda way, God knows I didn't
mean no harm



Oh well if I could get 'cha babe, just to lay back up in my arms

An' if I could get cha babe, just to lay back up in my arms

I would prove to you baby, God knows I didn't mean no harm

(Well all right...)



Ah little girl if you don't love me, oh little girl my mama do

Ah little girl if you don't love me, oh little girl my mama do

I don't mean to hurt your feeling, God knows I didn't mean to do ya
no harm



I didn't mean no harm, I'm goin' home...
