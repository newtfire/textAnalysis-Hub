<lyrics>


<l>Oh you said I hurt your feelings, but you won't tell me what I
done

</l>
<l>Oh you said I hurt your feelings, but you won't tell me what I
done

</l>
<l>And if I done hurt your feelings, some kinda way, God knows I didn't

mean no harm




</l>
<l>Oh well if I could get 'cha babe, just to lay back up in my arms

</l>
<l>An' if I could get cha babe, just to lay back up in my arms

</l>
<l>I would prove to you baby, God knows I didn't mean no harm

</l>
<l>(Well all right...)



</l>
<l>Ah little girl if you don't love me, oh little girl my mama do

</l>
<l>Ah little girl if you don't love me, oh little girl my mama do

</l>
<l>I don't mean to hurt your feeling, God knows I didn't mean to do ya

no harm




</l>
<l>I didn't mean no harm, I'm goin' home...</l></lyrics></xml>
