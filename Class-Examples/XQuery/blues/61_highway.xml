<lyrics>



Lord, that 61 Highway is the longest road I know

Lord, that 61 Highway may be the longest road I know

She run from New York City, down the Gulf of Mexico



Lord, it's some poor sand down, Greyhound buses don't run

Lord, it's some poor sand down, Greyhound buses don't run

Just go to work with me baby, look down Highway 61



I said please, please see somebody for me

I said please, please see somebody for me

If you see my baby, tell her she's alright with me



I'm gonna buy me a pony can, pay for fox-trot and run
1

I'm gonna buy me a pony can, pay for fox-trot and run

Lord, when you see me comin', pretty mama, I'll be on Highway 61



I started school one Monday mornin', Lord, I throwed my books
away

I started school one Monday mornin', baby, I throwed my books
away

I wrote a note to my teacher, Lord, I'm gonna try 61 today



Lord, if I have to die, baby, fo' you think my time have come

Lord, if I have to die, baby now, fo' you think my time have come

I want you to bury my body, out on Highway 61



Lord, it's amazin', baby, Lord, don't want you to have no fun

It's amazin', baby, don't want you to have no fun

Just come down to my little cabin, out on Highway 61

Note 1: "pony can, pay for fox-trot and run", this part of the song
is hard to decipher, I'm open for suggestions here.
