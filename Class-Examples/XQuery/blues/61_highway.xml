<lyrics>

<l>Lord, that 61 Highway is the longest road I know

</l>
<l>Lord, that 61 Highway may be the longest road I know

</l>
<l>She run from New York City, down the Gulf of Mexico



</l>
<l>Lord, it's some poor sand down, Greyhound buses don't run

</l>
<l>Lord, it's some poor sand down, Greyhound buses don't run

</l>
<l>Just go to work with me baby, look down Highway 61



</l>
<l>I said please, please see somebody for me

</l>
<l>I said please, please see somebody for me

</l>
<l>If you see my baby, tell her she's alright with me



</l>
<l>I'm gonna buy me a pony can, pay for fox-trot and run
1

</l>
<l>I'm gonna buy me a pony can, pay for fox-trot and run

</l>
<l>Lord, when you see me comin', pretty mama, I'll be on Highway 61



</l>
<l>I started school one Monday mornin', Lord, I throwed my books
away

</l>
<l>I started school one Monday mornin', baby, I throwed my books
away

</l>
<l>I wrote a note to my teacher, Lord, I'm gonna try 61 today



</l>
<l>Lord, if I have to die, baby, fo' you think my time have come

</l>
<l>Lord, if I have to die, baby now, fo' you think my time have come

</l>
<l>I want you to bury my body, out on Highway 61



</l>
<l>Lord, it's amazin', baby, Lord, don't want you to have no fun

</l>
<l>It's amazin', baby, don't want you to have no fun

</l>
<l>Just come down to my little cabin, out on Highway 61
