Got a bad case of love

Got a bad case of love

Got a bad case of love

Got a bad case of love

Got a bad case of love

People my heart is full of misery



I live in loneliness, never get no rest

Went to see a love doctor, to get out of this mess

Took a look at me, before he cast his spell

Shook his head and then began to yell

You gotta bad case of love

Got a bad case of love

Got a bad case of love

People my heart is full of misery



I said, #147;Doctor, doctor, please do something for me

I feel like a man going through the third degree

Can#146;t sleep at night, can#146;t eat a bit"

Since you been gone nothin' ever goes right

You gotta bad case of love

Got a bad case of love

Got a bad case of love

People my heart is full of misery



He said son I know, just how you feel

You love your little baby and you always will

But your puff is short, your breathin' weak

It won#146;t be long before you#146;re 6 feet deep

You gotta bad case of love

Got a bad case of love

Got a bad case of love

People my heart is full of misery
