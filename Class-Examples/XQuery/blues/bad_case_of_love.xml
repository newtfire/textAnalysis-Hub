<l>Got a bad case of love

</l>
<l>Got a bad case of love

</l>
<l>Got a bad case of love

</l>
<l>Got a bad case of love

</l>
<l>Got a bad case of love

</l>
<l>People my heart is full of misery



</l>
<l>I live in loneliness, never get no rest

</l>
<l>Went to see a love doctor, to get out of this mess

</l>
<l>Took a look at me, before he cast his spell

</l>
<l>Shook his head and then began to yell

</l>
<l>You gotta bad case of love

</l>
<l>Got a bad case of love

</l>
<l>Got a bad case of love

</l>
<l>People my heart is full of misery



</l>
<l>I said, #147;Doctor, doctor, please do something for me

</l>
<l>I feel like a man going through the third degree

</l>
<l>Can#146;t sleep at night, can#146;t eat a bit"

</l>
<l>Since you been gone nothin' ever goes right

</l>
<l>You gotta bad case of love

</l>
<l>Got a bad case of love

</l>
<l>Got a bad case of love

</l>
<l>People my heart is full of misery



</l>
<l>He said son I know, just how you feel

</l>
<l>You love your little baby and you always will

</l>
<l>But your puff is short, your breathin' weak

</l>
<l>It won#146;t be long before you#146;re 6 feet deep

</l>
<l>You gotta bad case of love

</l>
<l>Got a bad case of love

</l>
<l>Got a bad case of love

</l>
<l>People my heart is full of misery</l></lyrics></xml>
