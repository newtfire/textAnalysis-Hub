<l>Long about sundown, I've gotta be on my way

</l>
<l>Sad long about sundown, I've gotta be on my way

</l>
<l>Goin' back to my woman and this time I'm gonna stay



</l>
<l>Yes, I've been gone for a long time, wonder if I'm welcome home

</l>
<l>Been gone for a long time, wonder if I'm welcome home

</l>
<l>So many things can happen, when a man leaves his baby all alone



</l>
<l>Yes, it took a long time, baby, to realize what a fool I've been

</l>
<l>Well, I said it took a long, long time, baby, to realize what a fool
I've been

</l>
<l>When I knock on the door, I wonder will she let me in</l></lyrics></xml>
