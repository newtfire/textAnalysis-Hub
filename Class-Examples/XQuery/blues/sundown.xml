<lyrics>



Long about sundown, I've gotta be on my way

Sad long about sundown, I've gotta be on my way

Goin' back to my woman and this time I'm gonna stay



Yes, I've been gone for a long time, wonder if I'm welcome home

Been gone for a long time, wonder if I'm welcome home

So many things can happen, when a man leaves his baby all alone



Yes, it took a long time, baby, to realize what a fool I've been

Well, I said it took a long, long time, baby, to realize what a fool
I've been

When I knock on the door, I wonder will she let me in
