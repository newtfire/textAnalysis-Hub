<lyrics>



Come back to me, baby

I feel so all alone

It rained last night

And things ain't right

Without my baby home



Every time it rains

I think of you

And that's the time

I feel so blue

When the rain starts falling

My love comes tumbling down

And it's raining

Teardrops from my eyes



If you see clouds

Here in my eyes

It's just because

You said good-bye

Although the sun is shining

There's no more summer skies

'Cause it's raining

Teardrops from my eyes



Remember the night you told me

Our love would always be

I wouldn't be blue and lonely

If you'd come back to me

Every single cloud

Would disappear

I'd wear a smile

If you were here

So baby, won't you hurry

Because I miss you so

And it's raining

Teardrops from my eyes



Remember the night you told me

Our love would always be

I wouldn't be blue and lonely

If you'd come back to me

Every single cloud

Would disappear

I'd wear a smile

If you were here

So baby, won't you hurry

Because I miss you so

And it's raining

Teardrops from my eyes
