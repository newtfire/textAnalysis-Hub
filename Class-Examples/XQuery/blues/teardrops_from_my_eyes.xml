<lyrics>


<l>Come back to me, baby

</l>
<l>I feel so all alone

</l>
<l>It rained last night

</l>
<l>And things ain't right

</l>
<l>Without my baby home



</l>
<l>Every time it rains

</l>
<l>I think of you

</l>
<l>And that's the time

</l>
<l>I feel so blue

</l>
<l>When the rain starts falling

</l>
<l>My love comes tumbling down

</l>
<l>And it's raining

</l>
<l>Teardrops from my eyes



</l>
<l>If you see clouds

</l>
<l>Here in my eyes

</l>
<l>It's just because

</l>
<l>You said good-bye

</l>
<l>Although the sun is shining

</l>
<l>There's no more summer skies

</l>
<l>'Cause it's raining

</l>
<l>Teardrops from my eyes



</l>
<l>Remember the night you told me

</l>
<l>Our love would always be

</l>
<l>I wouldn't be blue and lonely

</l>
<l>If you'd come back to me

</l>
<l>Every single cloud

</l>
<l>Would disappear

</l>
<l>I'd wear a smile

</l>
<l>If you were here

</l>
<l>So baby, won't you hurry

</l>
<l>Because I miss you so

</l>
<l>And it's raining

</l>
<l>Teardrops from my eyes



</l>
<l>Remember the night you told me

</l>
<l>Our love would always be

</l>
<l>I wouldn't be blue and lonely

</l>
<l>If you'd come back to me

</l>
<l>Every single cloud

</l>
<l>Would disappear

</l>
<l>I'd wear a smile

</l>
<l>If you were here

</l>
<l>So baby, won't you hurry

</l>
<l>Because I miss you so

</l>
<l>And it's raining
