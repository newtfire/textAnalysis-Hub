<l>Don't think you're smart, because you've got every man in town

</l>
<l>Don't think you're smart, woman, because you've got every man in
town

</l>
<l>Well, well, woman you ain't doin' nothin', woo, well, well, would

tear your reputation down




</l>
<l>There's no man that wants a woman, that comes stagglin' down the
street

</l>
<l>No man wants a woman, that comes stagglin' down the street

</l>
<l>Well because you ain't no good woman,

</l>
<l>woo, well, well, you'll get drunk with every man you meet



</l>
<l>I can get drunk, roll in the gutter, get up and brush myself off

</l>
<l>I can roll in the gutter, get up and brush myself off

</l>
<l>Now, well, but if you should happen to do so woman,

</l>
<l>woo, well, well, woman your reputation is gone



</l>
<l>Now don't think I'm scoldin', I'm just tryin' to get you to learn

</l><l>Well, well, that a woman reputation, woo, well, well, it's somethin'</l>
<l>that money can't earn</l></lyrics></xml>
