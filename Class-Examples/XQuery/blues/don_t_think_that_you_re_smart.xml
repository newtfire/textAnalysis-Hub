<lyrics>



Don't think you're smart, because you've got every man in town

Don't think you're smart, woman, because you've got every man in
town

Well, well, woman you ain't doin' nothin', woo, well, well, would
tear your reputation down



There's no man that wants a woman, that comes stagglin' down the
street

No man wants a woman, that comes stagglin' down the street

Well because you ain't no good woman,

woo, well, well, you'll get drunk with every man you meet



I can get drunk, roll in the gutter, get up and brush myself off

I can roll in the gutter, get up and brush myself off

Now, well, but if you should happen to do so woman,

woo, well, well, woman your reputation is gone



Now don't think I'm scoldin', I'm just tryin' to get you to learn

Don't think I'm scoldin', I'm just tryin' to get you to learn

Well, well, that a woman reputation, woo, well, well, it's somethin'
that money can't earn
