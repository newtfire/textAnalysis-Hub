<lyrics>



All my life, I've caught it hard

All of my life, I have caught it hard

I've been abused, and I've been scorned



I feel so bad, it ain't gonna last

I feel so bad, this ain't gonna last

I've been scorned, and I've been kicked out



I've been abused, I've been talked about

I've been abused, I've been talked about

I've been scorned, sure as you born



I'm so mad, I can shout

I'm so mad, I can shout

I've been abused, and I've been kicked out
