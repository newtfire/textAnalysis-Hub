<lyrics>

<l>Lord, you're gonna be sorry, ever done me wrong

</l>
<l>Gon' be sorry, Lord, you ever done me wrong

</l>
<l>Gon' be too late, baby Lord, an' I'll be gone



</l>
<l>Lord, don't come here runnin', Lord, baby, screamin' and cryin'

</l>
<l>Don't come here runnin' now, honey Lord, screamin' and cryin'

</l>
<l>Lord, you got a home, you got a home, baby, Lord, long as I
got...



</l>
<l>Me an' my white dog started, baby, walkin' out in Jackson Park

</l>
<l>Me an' my white dog started, honey, walkin' out in Jackson Park

</l>
<l>It takes a man's appetite, Lord. honey, hear my white dog bark



</l>
<l>You now, I'm goin' to Memphis, babe, I'm gonna stop on Ethan
Street

</l>
<l>You now, I'm goin' to Memphis, baby, I'm gonna stop on Ethan
Street

</l>
<l>I want some of you women, I want some of you women, please show me
reach and peak

</l>
<l>so I won't be dodging every, every long tall man I meet



</l>
<l>Let me tell you something baby, honey please don't crowd your
mind

</l>
<l>Let me tell you something, Lord, please don't crowd your mind

</l>
<l>(Spoken: "Now, don't fret")

</l>
<l>First thing you know, baby, you be goin' a penny 'gainst your
plight



</l>
<l>Lord, I start to holler loud, but I believe, I belive I will, mama,
Lord

</l>
<l>Lord, I start to holler, believe I will, mama



</l>
