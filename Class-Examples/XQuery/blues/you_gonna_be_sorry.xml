<lyrics>



Lord, you're gonna be sorry, ever done me wrong

Gon' be sorry, Lord, you ever done me wrong

Gon' be too late, baby Lord, an' I'll be gone



Lord, don't come here runnin', Lord, baby, screamin' and cryin'

Don't come here runnin' now, honey Lord, screamin' and cryin'

Lord, you got a home, you got a home, baby, Lord, long as I
got...



Me an' my white dog started, baby, walkin' out in Jackson Park

Me an' my white dog started, honey, walkin' out in Jackson Park

It takes a man's appetite, Lord. honey, hear my white dog bark



You now, I'm goin' to Memphis, babe, I'm gonna stop on Ethan
Street

You now, I'm goin' to Memphis, baby, I'm gonna stop on Ethan
Street

I want some of you women, I want some of you women, please show me
reach and peak

so I won't be dodging every, every long tall man I meet



Let me tell you something baby, honey please don't crowd your
mind

Let me tell you something, Lord, please don't crowd your mind

(Spoken: "Now, don't fret")

First thing you know, baby, you be goin' a penny 'gainst your
plight



Lord, I start to holler loud, but I believe, I belive I will, mama,
Lord

Lord, I start to holler, believe I will, mama



________

Note 1: reach and peak, not sure of this part;

Note 2: ou be goin' a penny 'gainst your plight, not sure of this
part.
