<lyrics>



You say you're leaving, you've shattered my dreams

All of our plans dear, forgotten it seems

Yes, it had to happen

I'm not surprised, but I'll, I'll survive



Your friends have shown you a much better way

All of my loving you baby, all of those years, ended today

Yes, you go on darlin'

I'll dry my eyes, but I'll, I'll survive



Go on! May God bless you

It was fun. While it was fun

Baby, I hate to lose you

I say I hate to lose you baby



It's all over! What's done is done

Hey! you go on darlin', seek your fortune and fame

All your good luck or bad luck

Your friends must take the blame

Oh! I can't beg you no more baby

I've got too much pride, but I'll, I'll survive



Oh, go on! May God bless you

Oh, it was fun. While it was fun

Oh baby, I hate to lose you

I say I hate to lose you baby



It's all over! What's done is done

Hey! You go on baby, seek your fortune and fame

All your good good luck or bad luck

Friends must take the blame

Oh! I can't beg you no more

I've got too much pride, but I'll, I'll survive



Oh! I'll, I'll survive

Baby, I'll survive
