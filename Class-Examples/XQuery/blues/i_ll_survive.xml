<lyrics>


<l>You say you're leaving, you've shattered my dreams

</l>
<l>All of our plans dear, forgotten it seems

</l>
<l>Yes, it had to happen

</l>
<l>I'm not surprised, but I'll, I'll survive



</l>
<l>Your friends have shown you a much better way

</l>
<l>All of my loving you baby, all of those years, ended today

</l>
<l>Yes, you go on darlin'

</l>
<l>I'll dry my eyes, but I'll, I'll survive



</l>
<l>Go on! May God bless you

</l>
<l>It was fun. While it was fun

</l>
<l>Baby, I hate to lose you

</l>
<l>I say I hate to lose you baby



</l>
<l>It's all over! What's done is done

</l>
<l>Hey! you go on darlin', seek your fortune and fame

</l>
<l>All your good luck or bad luck

</l>
<l>Your friends must take the blame

</l>
<l>Oh! I can't beg you no more baby

</l>
<l>I've got too much pride, but I'll, I'll survive



</l>
<l>Oh, go on! May God bless you

</l>
<l>Oh, it was fun. While it was fun

</l>
<l>Oh baby, I hate to lose you

</l>
<l>I say I hate to lose you baby



</l>
<l>It's all over! What's done is done

</l>
<l>Hey! You go on baby, seek your fortune and fame

</l>
<l>All your good good luck or bad luck

</l>
<l>Friends must take the blame

</l>
<l>Oh! I can't beg you no more

</l>
<l>I've got too much pride, but I'll, I'll survive



</l>
<l>Oh! I'll, I'll survive
