<lyrics>



You want to say goodbye

No need to tell me why

Now that our little romance is through

All I can say is: good luck to you

Don't waste your tears on me

I don't need sympathy

Just go ahead about your business

Sweet daddy, let your mama be



I never miss the sunshine, I am so used to the rain

And when you're gone I won't feel bad

I never miss the things that I never had

Although I hate to lose you, but I won't complain

You said you want to leave me, there's the door

I've been disappointed many times before

I never miss the sunshine, I'm so used to the rain



I'm going upon the mountain to watch the sinking sun

Ain't found nobody else could love me like my loving daddy done

Oh, I never miss the sunshine, I'm so used to the rain
