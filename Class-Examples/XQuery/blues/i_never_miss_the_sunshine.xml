<lyrics>


<l>You want to say goodbye

</l>
<l>No need to tell me why

</l>
<l>Now that our little romance is through

</l>
<l>All I can say is: good luck to you

</l>
<l>Don't waste your tears on me

</l>
<l>I don't need sympathy

</l>
<l>Just go ahead about your business

</l>
<l>Sweet daddy, let your mama be



</l>
<l>I never miss the sunshine, I am so used to the rain

</l>
<l>And when you're gone I won't feel bad

</l>
<l>I never miss the things that I never had

</l>
<l>Although I hate to lose you, but I won't complain

</l>
<l>You said you want to leave me, there's the door

</l>
<l>I've been disappointed many times before

</l>
<l>I never miss the sunshine, I'm so used to the rain



</l>
<l>I'm going upon the mountain to watch the sinking sun

</l>
<l>Ain't found nobody else could love me like my loving daddy done

</l><l>Oh, I never miss the sunshine, I'm so used to the rain</l></lyrics></xml>
