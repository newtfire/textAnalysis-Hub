<lyrics>


<l>She don't love me, she love my automobile

</l>
<l>She don't love me, she love my automobile

</l>
<l>Well she would do anything just to slide behind the wheel



</l>
<l>She said, "What's it gonna take for you to lay your top on down?"

</l>
<l>She said, "What's it gonna take for you to lay your top on down?"

</l>
<l>I said, "Honey why don't you ask me when we get to the outskirts of

town"




</l>
<l>Well now she don't care if I'm stoned or sloppy drunk

</l>
<l>Well she don't care if I'm stoned or sloppy drunk

</l>
<l>Long as she got the keys and there's a spare wheel in her trunk</l></lyrics></xml>
