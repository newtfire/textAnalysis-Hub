<lyrics>



She don't love me, she love my automobile

She don't love me, she love my automobile

Well she would do anything just to slide behind the wheel



She said, "What's it gonna take for you to lay your top on down?"

She said, "What's it gonna take for you to lay your top on down?"

I said, "Honey why don't you ask me when we get to the outskirts of
town"



Well now she don't care if I'm stoned or sloppy drunk

Well she don't care if I'm stoned or sloppy drunk

Long as she got the keys and there's a spare wheel in her trunk
