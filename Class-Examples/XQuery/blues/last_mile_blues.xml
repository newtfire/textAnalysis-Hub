<lyrics>


<l>You wonder why I'm grievin' and feelin' blue?

</l>
<l>All I do is moan and cry

</l>
<l>With me you'd be in sympathy if you only knew

</l>
<l>And here's the reason why:



</l>
<l>Have you heard what that mean old judge has done to me?

</l>
<l>He told the jury not to let my man go free

</l>
<l>There I stood with my heart so full of misery

</l>
<l>He must die on the gallows, that was the court's decree



</l>
<l>I walked the floor until his time was through

</l>
<l>The judge he said, "There's nothin' you can do"

</l>
<l>He must die on the gallows, by his neck be hung

</l>
<l>He must pay with his life when that there trap is sprung



</l>
<l>He refused folks to talk until it was too late

</l>
<l>He gave his life to satisfy the State

</l>
<l>When they pull the black cap over my daddy's face

</l>
<l>Lord I beg the sheriff to let me take his place



</l>
<l>Now everyday I seem to see that news

</l>
<l>I cry to hide my tears but what's the use?

</l>
<l>Thirteen steps with his lovin' arms bound to his side

</l>
<l>With a smile on his face that's how my daddy died</l></lyrics></xml>
