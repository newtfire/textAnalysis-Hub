<lyrics>



You wonder why I'm grievin' and feelin' blue?

All I do is moan and cry

With me you'd be in sympathy if you only knew

And here's the reason why:



Have you heard what that mean old judge has done to me?

He told the jury not to let my man go free

There I stood with my heart so full of misery

He must die on the gallows, that was the court's decree



I walked the floor until his time was through

The judge he said, "There's nothin' you can do"

He must die on the gallows, by his neck be hung

He must pay with his life when that there trap is sprung



He refused folks to talk until it was too late

He gave his life to satisfy the State

When they pull the black cap over my daddy's face

Lord I beg the sheriff to let me take his place



Now everyday I seem to see that news

I cry to hide my tears but what's the use?

Thirteen steps with his lovin' arms bound to his side

With a smile on his face that's how my daddy died
