<lyrics>



You know I'm the Wolf baby, you know I stays in the woods

You know I'm the Wolf babe, you know I stays in the woods

Well when you get in trouble, you call the wolf out of the woods




Well you want my money, well you want me to spend it on you

Well you want my money, babe you want the Wolf to spend it on you

Just as soon as you get my fortune, she said what in the world I want
with you?





Well I spend my money, trying to make you satisfied

Well, I have spent my money darlin', tryin' to make you satisfied

Well, the woman who took my money and took my home and,

oh the Wolf gonna wreck her life
