<l>Lord, I'm so blue, Lord, my baby has gone away

</l>
<l>Lord, I'm so blue, Lord, my baby has gone away

</l>
<l>Now, but that gonna be alright, maybe she'll come back home

someday




</l>
<l>I'm goin' to take Highway 61, man, I'm gonna ride it from coast to
coast

</l>
<l>I'm goin' to take Highway 61, man I'm gonna ride it from coast to
coast

</l>
<l>Now, my baby's goin' up the country, Lord, n' she won't come back no

more




</l>
<l>I'm going to call all the stations, I'm going to stop all train goin'
out

</l>
<l>I'm going to call the stations, I'm going to stop all trains goin'
out

</l>
<l>Because my baby's goin' up the country, oh Lord, n' she can't be

found




</l>
<l>I'm going to call old England, just to see if my baby's over
there

</l>
<l>I'm going to call old England, just to see if my baby's over
there

</l><l>Now if n' she ain't in England, lord, I can find in this world</l>
<l>somewhere</l></lyrics></xml>
