<lyrics>



Lord, I'm so blue, Lord, my baby has gone away

Lord, I'm so blue, Lord, my baby has gone away

Now, but that gonna be alright, maybe she'll come back home
someday



I'm goin' to take Highway 61, man, I'm gonna ride it from coast to
coast

I'm goin' to take Highway 61, man I'm gonna ride it from coast to
coast

Now, my baby's goin' up the country, Lord, n' she won't come back no
more



I'm going to call all the stations, I'm going to stop all train goin'
out

I'm going to call the stations, I'm going to stop all trains goin'
out

Because my baby's goin' up the country, oh Lord, n' she can't be
found



I'm going to call old England, just to see if my baby's over
there

I'm going to call old England, just to see if my baby's over
there

Now if n' she ain't in England, lord, I can find in this world
somewhere
