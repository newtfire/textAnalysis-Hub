<lyrics>



There's a whole lot of talk around town

About the way you're carrying yourself

Whole lot of talk around town, woman

About the way you're carrying yourself

You're jiving everybody in town

But old B., that's me

I know what you've been putting down



You got a rambling mind

Just don't wanna stay at home

You got a rambling mind, woman

You just don't wanna stay at home

You ain't got no job in town

And I know what you've been putting down



Everybody wants you, baby

Everybody but me

I said every

Everybody wants you, woman

Everybody but me

You've been jiving everybody in town, baby

But I know what you've been putting down



You went out late last night

To a dinner show and a dance

You went out late last night, baby

A dinner show and a dance

You must've been a perfect clown

'Cause I know what you've been putting down



Yeah, you came home

Early this morning, woman

With a new hat, a new dress

And a new pair of shoes

Came home early this morning, woman

With a new hat, a new dress

And a new pair of shoes

You ain't been visiting

Your relatives in town

I know what you've been putting down
