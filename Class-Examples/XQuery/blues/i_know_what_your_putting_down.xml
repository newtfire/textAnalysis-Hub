<lyrics>


<l>There's a whole lot of talk around town

</l>
<l>About the way you're carrying yourself

</l>
<l>Whole lot of talk around town, woman

</l>
<l>About the way you're carrying yourself

</l>
<l>You're jiving everybody in town

</l>
<l>But old B., that's me

</l>
<l>I know what you've been putting down



</l>
<l>You got a rambling mind

</l>
<l>Just don't wanna stay at home

</l>
<l>You got a rambling mind, woman

</l>
<l>You just don't wanna stay at home

</l>
<l>You ain't got no job in town

</l>
<l>And I know what you've been putting down



</l>
<l>Everybody wants you, baby

</l>
<l>Everybody but me

</l>
<l>I said every

</l>
<l>Everybody wants you, woman

</l>
<l>Everybody but me

</l>
<l>You've been jiving everybody in town, baby

</l>
<l>But I know what you've been putting down



</l>
<l>You went out late last night

</l>
<l>To a dinner show and a dance

</l>
<l>You went out late last night, baby

</l>
<l>A dinner show and a dance

</l>
<l>You must've been a perfect clown

</l>
<l>'Cause I know what you've been putting down



</l>
<l>Yeah, you came home

</l>
<l>Early this morning, woman

</l>
<l>With a new hat, a new dress

</l>
<l>And a new pair of shoes

</l>
<l>Came home early this morning, woman

</l>
<l>With a new hat, a new dress

</l>
<l>And a new pair of shoes

</l>
<l>You ain't been visiting

</l>
<l>Your relatives in town

</l>
<l>I know what you've been putting down</l></lyrics></xml>
