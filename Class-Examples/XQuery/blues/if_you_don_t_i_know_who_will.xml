<lyrics>



Daddy, I want some furs and things

Daddy, I want the diamond rings

Aeroplanes, motor cars and such

If your little mama ain't askin' too much

From you, from you

Won't you give me what I want, daddy do



If you don't I know who will

If you don't I know who will

You may think that I'm just bluffin'

But I'm one gal ain't supposed to want for nothin'

I got my wantin' habits on

I've had 'em on since this morn
1

Man, you've got to help me 'long

If you don't, it's good-bye John

Squeeze me till I feel the thrill

Love me till I get my fill

'Cause if you don't and say you won't

I know who will, Mr. So-and-So

I know who will



If you don't I know who will

If you don't I know who will

You might think that I'm just bluffin'

But I'm one gal ain't supposed to want for nothin'

I've got my wantin' habits on

I've had 'em on since this morn

Man, you've got to help me 'long

If you don't, it's goodbye John

Squeeze me till I feel the thrill

Love me till I get my fill

'Cause if you don't and say you won't

I know who will, my other papa

I know who will



__________

Note 1: morn, dawn or morning.
