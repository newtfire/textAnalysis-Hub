<lyrics>

<l>Daddy, I want some furs and things

</l>
<l>Daddy, I want the diamond rings

</l>
<l>Aeroplanes, motor cars and such

</l>
<l>If your little mama ain't askin' too much

</l>
<l>From you, from you

</l>
<l>Won't you give me what I want, daddy do



</l>
<l>If you don't I know who will

</l>
<l>If you don't I know who will

</l>
<l>You may think that I'm just bluffin'

</l>
<l>But I'm one gal ain't supposed to want for nothin'

</l>
<l>I got my wantin' habits on

</l>
<l>I've had 'em on since this morn
1

</l>
<l>Man, you've got to help me 'long

</l>
<l>If you don't, it's good-bye John

</l>
<l>Squeeze me till I feel the thrill

</l>
<l>Love me till I get my fill

</l>
<l>'Cause if you don't and say you won't

</l>
<l>I know who will, Mr. So-and-So

</l>
<l>I know who will



</l>
<l>If you don't I know who will

</l>
<l>If you don't I know who will

</l>
<l>You might think that I'm just bluffin'

</l>
<l>But I'm one gal ain't supposed to want for nothin'

</l>
<l>I've got my wantin' habits on

</l>
<l>I've had 'em on since this morn

</l>
<l>Man, you've got to help me 'long

</l>
<l>If you don't, it's goodbye John

</l>
<l>Squeeze me till I feel the thrill

</l>
<l>Love me till I get my fill

</l>
<l>'Cause if you don't and say you won't

</l>
<l>I know who will, my other papa

</l>
<l>I know who will
