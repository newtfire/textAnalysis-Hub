<lyrics>



The things that I used to do, yeah

Lord, I won't do no more, hear now hear

The things that I used to do baby

I'm tryin' to tell ya, ain't gonna do no more, hear

And I used to sit and hold your hand baby, yeah

Lord have mercy, and cry, baby do not go yet

But I don't care no mo'



I would search all night for you baby, yeah

Lordy, my search would always end in vain

I used to search all night for you mama, yeah

Lordy my search would always end in vain, yeah yeah

Ha, ha, ha

But I knew all along darlin' alright now, yeah yeah

That you was out with your other man, now yeah

Have yourself a good time now



(Play the blues for me Wayne, now!)



(Lord have mercy)



This is what I'm gonna do now

I'm gonna send you back to your mother, baby yeah

Lordy and I'm goin' back to my family too, yeah



Everybody listen to this, ha ha

And I'm gonna send you back to your mammy, baby yeah, ha

Lordy and I'm goin' back to my family to, alright

'Cause nothin' I do that seem to please you baby, alright now

Lord, I just can't get along with you, yeah

No no, no no, no no, can't do it, can't do it, yeah



Gonna send you back to your mammy, baby now

'Cause I can't do nothin' wit' you

Fading:

Guess she'll have to raise you again

Yeah

Umm-hmm

They say you can't teach a old dog new tricks
