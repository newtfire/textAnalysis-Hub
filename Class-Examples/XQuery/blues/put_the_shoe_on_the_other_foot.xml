<lyrics>



Put your shoe on the other foot, you can walk, just like me

Put your shoe on another foot, you can walk, just like me

Walkin' an' a talkin', see an' feel, a just like me



Put your hand in another glove, you can feel just like me

Put your hand in another glove, you can feel a just like me

Walkin' an' a talkin', see an' feel a just like me



Put your shoes on baby!



Put your eye on another view, you can see just like me

Hey, put your eye on another view, you can see just like me

Walkin' an' a talkin', see an' feel a just like me



Put your tongue on another word, you can talk just like me

Put your tongue on another word, you can talk just like me

Walkin' an' a talkin', see an' feel a just like me



(Whoa, whoa, whoa, ho)



Always talkin' all the time



(Whoa, whoa, whoa, ho)



Walk on baby



Walkin' an' a talkin', see an' feel a just like me



(Whoa, whoa, whoa ho)
