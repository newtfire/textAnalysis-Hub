<lyrics>


<l>Put your shoe on the other foot, you can walk, just like me

</l>
<l>Put your shoe on another foot, you can walk, just like me

</l>
<l>Walkin' an' a talkin', see an' feel, a just like me



</l>
<l>Put your hand in another glove, you can feel just like me

</l>
<l>Put your hand in another glove, you can feel a just like me

</l>
<l>Walkin' an' a talkin', see an' feel a just like me



</l>
<l>Put your shoes on baby!



</l>
<l>Put your eye on another view, you can see just like me

</l>
<l>Hey, put your eye on another view, you can see just like me

</l>
<l>Walkin' an' a talkin', see an' feel a just like me



</l>
<l>Put your tongue on another word, you can talk just like me

</l>
<l>Put your tongue on another word, you can talk just like me

</l>
<l>Walkin' an' a talkin', see an' feel a just like me



</l>
<l>(Whoa, whoa, whoa, ho)



</l>
<l>Always talkin' all the time



</l>
<l>(Whoa, whoa, whoa, ho)



</l>
<l>Walk on baby



</l>
<l>Walkin' an' a talkin', see an' feel a just like me



</l>
<l>(Whoa, whoa, whoa ho)</l></lyrics></xml>
