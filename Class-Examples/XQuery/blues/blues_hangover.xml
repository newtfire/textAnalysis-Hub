<lyrics>



Lord, I wonder what done happened

Ain't nobody here but me

All these empty bottles on the table here

I know I didn't drink all this by myself

I must have a blues hangover

What's this?

My check!?!

And I don't have change for a grasshopper and that's two crookies



Uh oh, here come Pro

Sent in for this doggie

But he ain't got no money

Look like he done lost everything he ever just had

Ain't that's a come-off

Dear me

I done gave my baby twenty dollars for a Christmas present

All I got was a slice of jelly cake

And Sam and Nedetta

Now that's a wolf-jenny



Now I'll believe I'll go on back on the stem now

With James, Rudolph and Tom Cat

Get my head bad again

Don't seem like nothin' goin' right for me today

All Right, here I go

Same old thing again

Look out now!
