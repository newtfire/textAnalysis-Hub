<lyrics>


<l>Lord, I wonder what done happened

</l>
<l>Ain't nobody here but me

</l>
<l>All these empty bottles on the table here

</l>
<l>I know I didn't drink all this by myself

</l>
<l>I must have a blues hangover

</l>
<l>What's this?

</l>
<l>My check!?!

</l>
<l>And I don't have change for a grasshopper and that's two crookies



</l>
<l>Uh oh, here come Pro

</l>
<l>Sent in for this doggie

</l>
<l>But he ain't got no money

</l>
<l>Look like he done lost everything he ever just had

</l>
<l>Ain't that's a come-off

</l>
<l>Dear me

</l>
<l>I done gave my baby twenty dollars for a Christmas present

</l>
<l>All I got was a slice of jelly cake

</l>
<l>And Sam and Nedetta

</l>
<l>Now that's a wolf-jenny



</l>
<l>Now I'll believe I'll go on back on the stem now

</l>
<l>With James, Rudolph and Tom Cat

</l>
<l>Get my head bad again

</l>
<l>Don't seem like nothin' goin' right for me today

</l>
<l>All Right, here I go

</l>
<l>Same old thing again

</l>
<l>Look out now!</l></lyrics></xml>
