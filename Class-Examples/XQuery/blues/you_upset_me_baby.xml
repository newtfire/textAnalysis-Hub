<lyrics>



Yes, she's 36 in the bust, 28 in the waist,

44 in the hip, she got a real crazy leg

You upsets me baby, yes, you upsets me baby

Yes, I'm telling you people she's something fine,

that you really outta see



Well, she's not too tall, complexion is fair,

man she knocked me out the way she wears her hair

You upsets me baby, Yes, you upsets me baby

Like being hit by a fallen tree,

woman, woman what you do to me



Well I, tried to describe her, it's hard to start

I better stop now because I got a weak heart

You upsets me, well, you upsets me baby

Well like being hit by a fallen tree,

woman, what you do to me



Well I, tried to describe her, it's hard to start

I better stop now because I got a very weak heart

You upsets me baby, yes, you upsets me baby

Well I've been hit by a fallen tree,

woman, what you do to me
