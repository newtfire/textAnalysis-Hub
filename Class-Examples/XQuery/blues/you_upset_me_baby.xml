<lyrics>


<l>Yes, she's 36 in the bust, 28 in the waist,

</l>
<l>44 in the hip, she got a real crazy leg

</l>
<l>You upsets me baby, yes, you upsets me baby

</l>
<l>Yes, I'm telling you people she's something fine,

</l>
<l>that you really outta see



</l>
<l>Well, she's not too tall, complexion is fair,

</l>
<l>man she knocked me out the way she wears her hair

</l>
<l>You upsets me baby, Yes, you upsets me baby

</l>
<l>Like being hit by a fallen tree,

</l>
<l>woman, woman what you do to me



</l>
<l>Well I, tried to describe her, it's hard to start

</l>
<l>I better stop now because I got a weak heart

</l>
<l>You upsets me, well, you upsets me baby

</l>
<l>Well like being hit by a fallen tree,

</l>
<l>woman, what you do to me



</l>
<l>Well I, tried to describe her, it's hard to start

</l>
<l>I better stop now because I got a very weak heart

</l>
<l>You upsets me baby, yes, you upsets me baby

</l>
<l>Well I've been hit by a fallen tree,

</l>
<l>woman, what you do to me</l></lyrics></xml>
