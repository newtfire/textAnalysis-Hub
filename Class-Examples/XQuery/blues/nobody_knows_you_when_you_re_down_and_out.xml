<lyrics>


<l>I once lived the life of a millionaire

</l>
<l>Spending my money I didn't care

</l>
<l>Always taking my friends out for a good time

</l>
<l>Buying champagne, gin and wine

</l>
<l>But just as soon as my dough got low

</l>
<l>I couldn't find a friend, no place I go

</l>
<l>If I ever get my hands on a dollar again

</l>
<l>I'm gonna squeeze it, and squeeze it

</l>
<l>Till the eagle grins



</l>
<l>Nobody knows you when you're down and out

</l>
<l>In your pocket, not one penny

</l>
<l>And your friends, you haven't any

</l>
<l>And as soon as you get on your feet again

</l>
<l>Everybody is your long lost friend

</l>
<l>It's mighty strange, without a doubt, but

</l>
<l>Nobody wants you when you're down and out



</l>
<l>You know folks, I once had a mansion

</l>
<l>Way up on the side of a hill

</l>
<l>I'd give champagne and caviar parties

</l>
<l>Just for fun and get a thrill

</l>
<l>But you know things they just can't stay like that forever

</l>
<l>And now I can't muscle up enough money

</l>
<l>To buy a shot of gin



</l>
<l>But you know, if I ever get my hands on a dollar again

</l>
<l>I'm gonna squeeze it, and squeeze it till the eagle grins

</l>
<l>It's mighty strange, without a doubt

</l>
<l>Nobody wants you

</l>
<l>Nobody needs you

</l><l>Nobody wants you when you're down and out</l></lyrics></xml>
