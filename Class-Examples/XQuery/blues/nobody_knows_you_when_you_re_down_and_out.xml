<lyrics>



I once lived the life of a millionaire

Spending my money I didn't care

Always taking my friends out for a good time

Buying champagne, gin and wine

But just as soon as my dough got low

I couldn't find a friend, no place I go

If I ever get my hands on a dollar again

I'm gonna squeeze it, and squeeze it

Till the eagle grins



Nobody knows you when you're down and out

In your pocket, not one penny

And your friends, you haven't any

And as soon as you get on your feet again

Everybody is your long lost friend

It's mighty strange, without a doubt, but

Nobody wants you when you're down and out



You know folks, I once had a mansion

Way up on the side of a hill

I'd give champagne and caviar parties

Just for fun and get a thrill

But you know things they just can't stay like that forever

And now I can't muscle up enough money

To buy a shot of gin



But you know, if I ever get my hands on a dollar again

I'm gonna squeeze it, and squeeze it till the eagle grins

It's mighty strange, without a doubt

Nobody wants you

Nobody needs you

Nobody wants you when you're down and out
