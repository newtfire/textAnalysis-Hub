<lyrics>



Mary had a little lamb,

it's fleece was white as snow, yeah

Everywhere the child went,

the little lamb was sure to go, yeah

He followed her to school one day,

and broke the teachers rule

What a time did they have,

that day at school



Tisket, tasket, baby

A green and yellow basket

Sent a letter to my baby

On my way I past it
