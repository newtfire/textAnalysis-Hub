<l>Mary had a little lamb,

</l>
<l>it's fleece was white as snow, yeah

</l>
<l>Everywhere the child went,

</l>
<l>the little lamb was sure to go, yeah

</l>
<l>He followed her to school one day,

</l>
<l>and broke the teachers rule

</l>
<l>What a time did they have,

</l>
<l>that day at school



</l>
<l>Tisket, tasket, baby

</l>
<l>A green and yellow basket

</l>
<l>Sent a letter to my baby

</l>
<l>On my way I past it
