<lyrics>


<l>Gone are the days I'm holding you tight

</l>
<l>Gone are the times I thrill with delight

</l>
<l>Oh how I've missed you and your tender kiss, I've been a fool too

long




</l>
<l>I took your love then broke my heart

</l>
<l>Can you forgive me, we'll make a new start

</l>
<l>Guess life ain't worth living if you ain't giving, I've been a fool

to long




</l>
<l>I've played the field but could not conceal

</l>
<l>The way I feel about you

</l>
<l>Everyone guessed I had no happiness, loving you the way I do



</l>
<l>You carried my heart around in your hand

</l>
<l>Yes I still love you, please understand

</l><l>Life ain't worth living if you ain't giving, I've been a fool to</l>
