<lyrics>



Gone are the days I'm holding you tight

Gone are the times I thrill with delight

Oh how I've missed you and your tender kiss, I've been a fool too
long



I took your love then broke my heart

Can you forgive me, we'll make a new start

Guess life ain't worth living if you ain't giving, I've been a fool
to long



I've played the field but could not conceal

The way I feel about you

Everyone guessed I had no happiness, loving you the way I do



You carried my heart around in your hand

Yes I still love you, please understand

Life ain't worth living if you ain't giving, I've been a fool to
long
