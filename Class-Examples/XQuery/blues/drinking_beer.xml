<lyrics>



Let's have a party an drink up a lot of beer

Let's have a party an drink up a lot of beer

Well, wine is fine but, give me lots of beer



Wanna drink some beer, talk some trash this mornin'

Let's drink some beer 'til the rooster crows at dawnin'

Well, wine is fine but, give me lots of beer



(Drinkin' beer)

Well, early in the mornin'

(Drinkin' beer)

Yes, in the afternoon

(Drinkin' beer)

Yes, in the evenin'

(Drinkin' beer)

Ah, in spring

Wine is fine but give me lots of beer



Now lite beer is real beer

Dark beer's real gone, too

You drink too much ale, you get put in jail

So I think I'll stick to home brew



Drinkin' in the mornin', had a little stout

A little stout'll make you poke way out

Drink it by the case an order some more

Call all the neighbors, they're right next door!



Well, in the evenin'

Well, in the afternoon, drink beer

Well, in the evenin', drink beer

Yes, it's spring

Wine is fine but give me lots of beer!
