<l>Let's have a party an drink up a lot of beer

</l>
<l>Let's have a party an drink up a lot of beer

</l>
<l>Well, wine is fine but, give me lots of beer



</l>
<l>Wanna drink some beer, talk some trash this mornin'

</l>
<l>Let's drink some beer 'til the rooster crows at dawnin'

</l>
<l>Well, wine is fine but, give me lots of beer



</l>
<l>(Drinkin' beer)

</l>
<l>Well, early in the mornin'

</l>
<l>(Drinkin' beer)

</l>
<l>Yes, in the afternoon

</l>
<l>(Drinkin' beer)

</l>
<l>Yes, in the evenin'

</l>
<l>(Drinkin' beer)

</l>
<l>Ah, in spring

</l>
<l>Wine is fine but give me lots of beer



</l>
<l>Now lite beer is real beer

</l>
<l>Dark beer's real gone, too

</l>
<l>You drink too much ale, you get put in jail

</l>
<l>So I think I'll stick to home brew



</l>
<l>Drinkin' in the mornin', had a little stout

</l>
<l>A little stout'll make you poke way out

</l>
<l>Drink it by the case an order some more

</l>
<l>Call all the neighbors, they're right next door!



</l>
<l>Well, in the evenin'

</l>
<l>Well, in the afternoon, drink beer

</l>
<l>Well, in the evenin', drink beer

</l>
<l>Yes, it's spring

</l>
<l>Wine is fine but give me lots of beer!</l></lyrics></xml>
