<lyrics>



Give me a break papa, don't throw your sweet mama down

Give me a break papa, don't throw your sweet mama down

You treated me so mean, ain't you tired of doggin' me 'round?



There was a time when nobody wanted you but me

There was a time when nobody wanted you but me

You didn't have no friends, you were poor and hungry as could be



I took you up and fed you, give you a nice home too

I took you up and fed you, give you a nice home too

That's why I can't understand why you treat me dirty like you do



Now I'm sad and lonely, feel mistreated and blue

Now I'm sad and lonely, feel mistreated and blue

Won't you give me a break papa, like I gave you?
