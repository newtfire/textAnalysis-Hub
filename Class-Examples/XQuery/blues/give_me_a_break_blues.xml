<l>Give me a break papa, don't throw your sweet mama down

</l>
<l>Give me a break papa, don't throw your sweet mama down

</l>
<l>You treated me so mean, ain't you tired of doggin' me 'round?



</l>
<l>There was a time when nobody wanted you but me

</l>
<l>There was a time when nobody wanted you but me

</l>
<l>You didn't have no friends, you were poor and hungry as could be



</l>
<l>I took you up and fed you, give you a nice home too

</l>
<l>I took you up and fed you, give you a nice home too

</l>
<l>That's why I can't understand why you treat me dirty like you do



</l>
<l>Now I'm sad and lonely, feel mistreated and blue

</l>
<l>Now I'm sad and lonely, feel mistreated and blue

</l>
<l>Won't you give me a break papa, like I gave you?</l></lyrics></xml>
