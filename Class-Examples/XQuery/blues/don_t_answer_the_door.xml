<lyrics>



Woman, I don't want a soul,

hangin' around my house when I'm not home

Whoa, I don't want a soul, baby,

hangin' around my house when I'm not home

I don't want you to answer the door for nobody, baby,

oh, when you're home and you know you're all alone



I don't want your sister comin' by,

because the little girl she talk too much

If she wanna come by to visit us,

tell her to meet us Sunday, down at the church

'Cause I don't want a soul, baby,

hangin' around my house when I'm not at home

Yes, I don't want you to answer the door for nobody, baby,

oh, when you're home and you know you're all alone



If your mother wanna visit us,

tell her I get home bout the break a day

And that's too late to visit anybody, baby,

so, tell her to please stay away

'Cause I don't want a soul, baby,

hangin' around my house when I'm not at home

Yes, I don't want you to open the door for anybody, baby,

oh, when you're home and you know you're all alone



Now, if you feel a little sick, baby,

and you know you're home all alone,

I don't want the doctor at my house, baby,

you just suffer till I get home

'Cause I don't want a soul, baby,

hangin' around my house when I'm not at home

Yes, I don't want you to open the door for nobody, baby,

when you're home and all alone
