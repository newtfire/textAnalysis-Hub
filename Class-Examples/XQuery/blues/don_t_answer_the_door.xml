<lyrics>


<l>Woman, I don't want a soul,

</l>
<l>hangin' around my house when I'm not home

</l>
<l>Whoa, I don't want a soul, baby,

</l>
<l>hangin' around my house when I'm not home

</l>
<l>I don't want you to answer the door for nobody, baby,

</l>
<l>oh, when you're home and you know you're all alone



</l>
<l>I don't want your sister comin' by,

</l>
<l>because the little girl she talk too much

</l>
<l>If she wanna come by to visit us,

</l>
<l>tell her to meet us Sunday, down at the church

</l>
<l>'Cause I don't want a soul, baby,

</l>
<l>hangin' around my house when I'm not at home

</l>
<l>Yes, I don't want you to answer the door for nobody, baby,

</l>
<l>oh, when you're home and you know you're all alone



</l>
<l>If your mother wanna visit us,

</l>
<l>tell her I get home bout the break a day

</l>
<l>And that's too late to visit anybody, baby,

</l>
<l>so, tell her to please stay away

</l>
<l>'Cause I don't want a soul, baby,

</l>
<l>hangin' around my house when I'm not at home

</l>
<l>Yes, I don't want you to open the door for anybody, baby,

</l>
<l>oh, when you're home and you know you're all alone



</l>
<l>Now, if you feel a little sick, baby,

</l>
<l>and you know you're home all alone,

</l>
<l>I don't want the doctor at my house, baby,

</l>
<l>you just suffer till I get home

</l>
<l>'Cause I don't want a soul, baby,

</l>
<l>hangin' around my house when I'm not at home

</l>
<l>Yes, I don't want you to open the door for nobody, baby,

</l>
<l>when you're home and all alone</l></lyrics></xml>
