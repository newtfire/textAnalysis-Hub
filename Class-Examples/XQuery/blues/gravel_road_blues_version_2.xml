<lyrics>


<l>I'm goin' down that gravel road, take that right hand road

</l>
<l>I'm goin' down that gravel road, take that right hand road

</l>
<l>Lord, I ain't gonna stop walkin' 'till I get in sweet mama's door



</l>
<l>Well, the girl I'm lovin' she got great long, curly hair

</l>
<l>Well, the girl I'm lovin' she got great long, curly hair

</l>
<l>Lord, her mama and her papa sure don't 'low me there



</l>
<l>Lord, I'm going away, baby, don't you want to go

</l>
<l>Lord, I'm going away, baby, don't you want to go

</l>
<l>Lord, I'm going somewhere, where I ain't never been before



</l>
<l>Don't look your house lonesome when your dough roller gone

</l>
<l>Don't look your house lonesome when your dough roller gone

</l>
<l>'Cause it gonna kill you, cooking till she comes home



</l>
<l>Now run here, baby, set down on my knee

</l>
<l>Now run here, baby, set down on my knee

</l>
<l>I want'a tell you all about the way they treated me
