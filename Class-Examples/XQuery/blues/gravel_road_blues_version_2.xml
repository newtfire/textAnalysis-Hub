<lyrics>



I'm goin' down that gravel road, take that right hand road

I'm goin' down that gravel road, take that right hand road

Lord, I ain't gonna stop walkin' 'till I get in sweet mama's door



Well, the girl I'm lovin' she got great long, curly hair

Well, the girl I'm lovin' she got great long, curly hair

Lord, her mama and her papa sure don't 'low me there



Lord, I'm going away, baby, don't you want to go

Lord, I'm going away, baby, don't you want to go

Lord, I'm going somewhere, where I ain't never been before



Don't look your house lonesome when your dough roller gone

Don't look your house lonesome when your dough roller gone

'Cause it gonna kill you, cooking till she comes home



Now run here, baby, set down on my knee

Now run here, baby, set down on my knee

I want'a tell you all about the way they treated me
