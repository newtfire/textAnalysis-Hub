<lyrics>


<l>I have the blues before sunrise, tears standing in my eyes

</l>
<l>I have the blues before sunrise, tears standing in my eyes

</l>
<l>It was a miserable feeling, now babe,

</l>
<l>A feeling I do despise



</l>
<l>I have to leave, leave you baby, because you know you done me
wrong

</l>
<l>I have to leave you baby, because you know you done me wrong

</l>
<l>I'm gonna pack up and leave you darling

</l>
<l>And break up my happy home



</l>
<l>I'm gonna leave you baby, I'm gonna leave you all alone

</l>
<l>I'm gonna leave you baby, I'm gonna leave you all alone

</l>
<l>I'm gonna pack up and leave you darling,

</l>
<l>Because you know you done me wrong



</l>
<l>Well now goodbye, goodbye baby, I'll see you on some rainy day

</l>
<l>Well now goodbye baby, I'll see you on some rainy day

</l>
<l>You can go ahead now little darling,

</l>
<l>'Cause I want you to have your way</l></lyrics></xml>
