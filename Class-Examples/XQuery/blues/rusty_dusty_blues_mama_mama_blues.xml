<lyrics>


<l>I Mama don't you beg your daddy for no diamond ring

</l>
<l>Mama don't you beg your daddy for no diamond ring

</l>
<l>'Cause mama you already got the best of everything



</l>
<l>I see you riding 'round, baby, riding in a brand new car

</l>
<l>I see you riding 'round, baby, riding in a brand new car

</l>
<l>I know you couldn't buy it sitting on your caviar



</l>
<l>Now your bracelets, your furs and that Paris label

</l>
<l>They're laying right there, laying on the table

</l>
<l>They'll come, hop, skip, and jumping as long as you're able

</l>
<l>Go get me some money baby, and lay it on the table



</l>
<l>Get up, get up, get up, get up, woman

</l>
<l>Get up off your big, fat rusty dusty, don't you hear me woman

</l>
<l>Get up, get up, get up, get up, woman

</l>
<l>Get up off your big, fat rusty dusty

</l>
<l>Get up mama, before it gets too rusty



</l>
<l>Now you've got the very best, the best of everything

</l>
<l>And baby, honey, you know how to do everything

</l>
<l>You even got that champagne taste

</l>
<l>But I'm so afraid baby, oh, you'll let me go to waste



</l>
<l>Get up, get up, get up, get up, woman

</l>
<l>Get up off your big, fat rusty dusty, don't you hear me

</l>
<l>Get up, get up, get up, mama

</l>
<l>Get up off your big, fat rusty dusty

</l>
<l>Get up mama, before it gets too rusty</l></lyrics></xml>
