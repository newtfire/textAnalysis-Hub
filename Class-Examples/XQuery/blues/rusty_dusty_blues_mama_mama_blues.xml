<lyrics>



I Mama don't you beg your daddy for no diamond ring

Mama don't you beg your daddy for no diamond ring

'Cause mama you already got the best of everything



I see you riding 'round, baby, riding in a brand new car

I see you riding 'round, baby, riding in a brand new car

I know you couldn't buy it sitting on your caviar



Now your bracelets, your furs and that Paris label

They're laying right there, laying on the table

They'll come, hop, skip, and jumping as long as you're able

Go get me some money baby, and lay it on the table



Get up, get up, get up, get up, woman

Get up off your big, fat rusty dusty, don't you hear me woman

Get up, get up, get up, get up, woman

Get up off your big, fat rusty dusty

Get up mama, before it gets too rusty



Now you've got the very best, the best of everything

And baby, honey, you know how to do everything

You even got that champagne taste

But I'm so afraid baby, oh, you'll let me go to waste



Get up, get up, get up, get up, woman

Get up off your big, fat rusty dusty, don't you hear me

Get up, get up, get up, mama

Get up off your big, fat rusty dusty

Get up mama, before it gets too rusty
