<lyrics>


<l>Way back yonder in the days of old

</l>
<l>The men was workin' but not savin' any dough

</l>
<l>Then came a woman lookin' real cool

</l>
<l>She said to herself, "Now, that's my fool"



</l>
<l>I'm gonna ball tonight

</l>
<l>I'm gonna ball tonight

</l>
<l>Well, I can't break the rule

</l>
<l>'Cause every man is some woman's fool



</l>
<l>I met a girl on the avenue

</l>
<l>She was shy and I was blue

</l>
<l>Like a teacher and a student in the school

</l>
<l>She looked at me and said, "You're my fool"



</l>
<l>Way back yonder in the days of old

</l>
<l>The men was workin' but not savin' any dough

</l>
<l>Then came a woman lookin' real cool

</l>
<l>She begin then to play every man for a fool



</l>
<l>I'm gonna ball tonight

</l>
<l>I'm gonna ball tonight

</l>
<l>Well, it's no use to break the rule

</l>
<l>'Cause every man is some woman's fool



</l>
<l>Yeah, I'm gonna ball tonight

</l>
<l>Gonna ball tonight

</l>
<l>I'm gonna ball tonight

</l>
<l>I'm gonna ball tonight

</l>
<l>Well, it's no use to break the rule

</l>
<l>'Cause every man is some woman's fool</l></lyrics></xml>
