<lyrics>



Way back yonder in the days of old

The men was workin' but not savin' any dough

Then came a woman lookin' real cool

She said to herself, "Now, that's my fool"



I'm gonna ball tonight

I'm gonna ball tonight

Well, I can't break the rule

'Cause every man is some woman's fool



I met a girl on the avenue

She was shy and I was blue

Like a teacher and a student in the school

She looked at me and said, "You're my fool"



Way back yonder in the days of old

The men was workin' but not savin' any dough

Then came a woman lookin' real cool

She begin then to play every man for a fool



I'm gonna ball tonight

I'm gonna ball tonight

Well, it's no use to break the rule

'Cause every man is some woman's fool



Yeah, I'm gonna ball tonight

Gonna ball tonight

I'm gonna ball tonight

I'm gonna ball tonight

Well, it's no use to break the rule

'Cause every man is some woman's fool
