<l>Get your hands on your money, mine all while you're gone

</l>
<l>Get your hands on your money, mine all while you're gone

</l>
<l>I'm gonna leave this town and I, ain't comin' back no more




</l>
<l>Well my Momma don't love me, daddy don't love me no more

</l>
<l>Well my Momma don't love me, daddy don't love me no more

</l>
<l>I might leave ya babe, I'm going down on the coast





</l>
<l>Well good bye baby, if I don't see you no more

</l>
<l>Well good bye baby, if I never see you no more

</l>
<l>I want to love you baby, but you keep driving me from your door</l></lyrics></xml>
