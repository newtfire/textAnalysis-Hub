<lyrics>



Get your hands on your money, mine all while you're gone

Get your hands on your money, mine all while you're gone

I'm gonna leave this town and I, ain't comin' back no more




Well my Momma don't love me, daddy don't love me no more

Well my Momma don't love me, daddy don't love me no more

I might leave ya babe, I'm going down on the coast





Well good bye baby, if I don't see you no more

Well good bye baby, if I never see you no more

I want to love you baby, but you keep driving me from your door
