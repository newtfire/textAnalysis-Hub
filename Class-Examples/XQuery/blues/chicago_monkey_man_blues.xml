<l>I'm goin' to Chicago, sorry but I can't take you

</l>
<l>Yes I'm goin' to Chicago, sorry but I can't take you

</l>
<l>'Cause there's nothin' on State Street, that a 
monkey
man
can do </l>

<l>I've got a monkey man here, a monkey man over there

</l>
<l>I've got a monkey man here, a monkey man over there

</l>
<l>If monkey men were money, I'd be a Chicago millionaire



</l>
<l>I've got fourteen men now, I only want one more

</l>
<l>I've got fourteen men now, and I only want one more

</l>
<l>As soon as I can get one, I'll let these fourteen go



</l>
<l>Now I'm goin' tell you, like the day goes so must you

</l>
<l>Now I'm goin' tell you, like the day goes so must you

</l>
<l>When you nobody no money, mama can no usin' you



</l>
<l>I can take my monkey men, and stand them all in line

</l>
<l>I can take my monkey men, and stand them all in line

</l><l>Anybody can count them, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven,</l>
<l>eight times</l></lyrics></xml>
