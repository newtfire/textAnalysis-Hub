<lyrics>



I'm goin' to Chicago, sorry but I can't take you

Yes I'm goin' to Chicago, sorry but I can't take you

'Cause there's nothin' on State Street, that a 
monkey
man
 can do



I've got a monkey man here, a monkey man over there

I've got a monkey man here, a monkey man over there

If monkey men were money, I'd be a Chicago millionaire



I've got fourteen men now, I only want one more

I've got fourteen men now, and I only want one more

As soon as I can get one, I'll let these fourteen go



Now I'm goin' tell you, like the day goes so must you

Now I'm goin' tell you, like the day goes so must you

When you nobody no money, mama can no usin' you



I can take my monkey men, and stand them all in line

I can take my monkey men, and stand them all in line

Anybody can count them, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven,
eight times
