<lyrics>



Well, the clock is strikin' twelve, somebody's got to go

Well, the clock is strikin' twelve, somebody's got to go

Gee, but I'm going to miss ya baby, this is one thing I'm sure you
know



When it's twelve o'clock in Memphis, it's one o'clock in San
Antone

When it's twelve o'clock in Memphis, it's one o'clock in San
Antone

When it's midnight in California, I'll be so all alone



Midnight is an awful hour, why does it come so soon?

Midnight is a awful hour, why does it come so soon?

It never bring me happ'ness, it always leave me filled with gloom



Don't ever gamble buddy, unless you're sure that you can't lose

Don't ever gamble buddy, unless you're sure that you can't lose

You better take my advise, unless you want this midnight blues



"Put it away!"
