<lyrics>


<l>Well, the clock is strikin' twelve, somebody's got to go

</l>
<l>Well, the clock is strikin' twelve, somebody's got to go

</l>
<l>Gee, but I'm going to miss ya baby, this is one thing I'm sure you

know




</l>
<l>When it's twelve o'clock in Memphis, it's one o'clock in San
Antone

</l>
<l>When it's twelve o'clock in Memphis, it's one o'clock in San
Antone

</l>
<l>When it's midnight in California, I'll be so all alone



</l>
<l>Midnight is an awful hour, why does it come so soon?

</l>
<l>Midnight is a awful hour, why does it come so soon?

</l>
<l>It never bring me happ'ness, it always leave me filled with gloom



</l>
<l>Don't ever gamble buddy, unless you're sure that you can't lose

</l>
<l>Don't ever gamble buddy, unless you're sure that you can't lose

</l>
<l>You better take my advise, unless you want this midnight blues



</l><l>"Put it away!"</l></lyrics></xml>
