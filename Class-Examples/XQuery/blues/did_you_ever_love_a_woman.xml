<l>Did you ever love a woman

</l>
<l>And you loved her with all your might

</l>
<l>Did you ever love a woman

</l>
<l>And you loved her with all your might

</l>
<l>Well, and you knew all the time

</l>
<l>That the woman wasn't treating you right



</l>
<l>You fix her breakfast in the morning

</l>
<l>Stay at home everyday

</l>
<l>Even wash the dishes

</l>
<l>If she has to go away

</l>
<l>You send the children to school

</l>
<l>Even mend their hose

</l>
<l>Stay up all nights with the babies

</l>
<l>Even wash their dirty clothes



</l>
<l>Did you ever love a woman

</l>
<l>And you loved her with all your might

</l>
<l>Yes, and you knew all the time

</l>
<l>That the woman wasn't treating you right



</l>
<l>But when it's time to go to bed

</l>
<l>The woman grabs you in her arms

</l>
<l>She holds you real tight

</l>
<l>She hugs you with all her charms

</l>
<l>She calls you a lot of sweet names

</l>
<l>Then she turns out the light

</l>
<l>She sets your soul on fire

</l>
<l>And you say, "Baby, everything is all right"



</l>
<l>Did you ever love a woman

</l>
<l>And you loved her with all your might

</l>
<l>Yes, and you knew all the time

</l><l>That the woman wasn't treating you right</l></lyrics></xml>
