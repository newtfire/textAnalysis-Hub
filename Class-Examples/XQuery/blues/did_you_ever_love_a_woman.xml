<lyrics>



Did you ever love a woman

And you loved her with all your might

Did you ever love a woman

And you loved her with all your might

Well, and you knew all the time

That the woman wasn't treating you right



You fix her breakfast in the morning

Stay at home everyday

Even wash the dishes

If she has to go away

You send the children to school

Even mend their hose

Stay up all nights with the babies

Even wash their dirty clothes



Did you ever love a woman

And you loved her with all your might

Yes, and you knew all the time

That the woman wasn't treating you right



But when it's time to go to bed

The woman grabs you in her arms

She holds you real tight

She hugs you with all her charms

She calls you a lot of sweet names

Then she turns out the light

She sets your soul on fire

And you say, "Baby, everything is all right"



Did you ever love a woman

And you loved her with all your might

Yes, and you knew all the time

That the woman wasn't treating you right
