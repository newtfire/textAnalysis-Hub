<lyrics>



I got 
ramblin'
,
I got ramblin' on my mind

I got ramblin', I got ramblin' all on my mind

Hate to leave my baby, but you treats me so unkind



And now babe, I will never forgive you anymore

Little girl, little girl, I will never forgive you anymore

You know you did not want me, baby, why did you tell me so?



And I'm runnin' down to the station, catch that first mail train I
see

(spoken: I hear her comin' now)

An' I'm runnin' down to the station, catch that old first mail train
I see

I've got the blues 'bout Miss So-and-So, and the child got the blues
about me



An' they's de'ilment, she got devilment
1
 all on her
mind

She's got devilment, little girl, you got devilment all on your
mind

Now I got to leave this mornin', with my arm' fold' up and cryin'



I believe, I believe my time ain't long

I believe, I believe that my time ain't long

But I'm leavin' this mornin', I believe I will go back home
