<lyrics>

<l>I got 
ramblin'
,
I got ramblin' on my mind

</l>
<l>I got ramblin', I got ramblin' all on my mind

</l>
<l>Hate to leave my baby, but you treats me so unkind



</l>
<l>And now babe, I will never forgive you anymore

</l>
<l>Little girl, little girl, I will never forgive you anymore

</l>
<l>You know you did not want me, baby, why did you tell me so?



</l>
<l>And I'm runnin' down to the station, catch that first mail train I
see

</l>
<l>(spoken: I hear her comin' now)

</l>
<l>An' I'm runnin' down to the station, catch that old first mail train
I see

</l>
<l>I've got the blues 'bout Miss So-and-So, and the child got the blues
about me



</l>
<l>An' they's de'ilment, she got devilment
1
all on her </l>
<l>mind

</l>
<l>She's got devilment, little girl, you got devilment all on your
mind

</l>
<l>Now I got to leave this mornin', with my arm' fold' up and cryin'



</l>
<l>I believe, I believe my time ain't long

</l>
<l>I believe, I believe that my time ain't long

</l>
<l>But I'm leavin' this mornin', I believe I will go back home
