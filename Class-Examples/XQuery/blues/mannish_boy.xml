<note>Note 1: alternate previously used text for this line, 
Lord be oooh
child, why
. The line 
No B, O child, Y
 
was
suggested to me by Mike O'Keefe on March 18, 1999 and I think Mike is
right here, it perfectly fits the preceding lines of the lyrics so I
substituted the old text with his suggestion. Thanks to Mike O'Keefe
for this contribution!</note></lyrics></xml>
