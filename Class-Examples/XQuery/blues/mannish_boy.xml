<lyrics>



Ooooooh, yeah, ooh, yeah



Everythin', everythin', everytin's gonna be alright this mornin'

Ooh yeah, whoaw

Now when I was a young boy, at the age of five

My mother said I was, gonna be the greatest man alive

But now I'm a man, way past 21

Want you to believe me baby,

I had lot's of fun

I'm a man

I spell mmm, aaa child, nnn

That represents man

No B, O child, Y
1

That mean mannish boy

I'm a man

I'm a full grown man

I'm a man

I'm a natural born lovers man

I'm a man

I'm a rollin' stone

I'm a man

I'm a 
hoochie
coochie man



Sittin' on the outside, just me and my mate

You know I'm made to move you honey,

come up two hours late

Wasn't that a man

I spell mmm, aaa child, nnn

That represents man

No B, O child, Y
1

That mean mannish boy

I'm a man

I'm a full grown man

Man

I'm a natural born lovers man

Man

I'm a rolllin' stone

Man-child

I'm a hoochie coochie man



The line I shoot will never miss

When I make love to a woman,

she can't resist

I think I go down,

to old Kansas Stew

I'm gonna bring back my second cousin,

that little 
Johnny
Cocheroo

All you little girls,

sittin'out at that line

I can make love to you woman,

in five minutes time

Ain't that a man

I spell mmm, aaa child, nnn

That represents man

No B, O child, Y
1

That mean mannish boy

Man

I'm a full grown man

Man

I'm a natural born lovers man

Man

I'm a rollin' stone

I'm a man-child

I'm a hoochie coochie man

well, well, well, well

hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry

Don't hurt me, don't hurt me child

don't hurt me, don't hurt, don't hurt me child

well, well, well, well



Yeah

Note 1: alternate previously used text for this line, 
Lord be oooh
child, why
. The line 
No B, O child, Y
 
was
suggested to me by Mike O'Keefe on March 18, 1999 and I think Mike is
right here, it perfectly fits the preceding lines of the lyrics so I
substituted the old text with his suggestion. Thanks to Mike O'Keefe
for this contribution!.
