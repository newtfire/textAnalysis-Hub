<lyrics>



Needles in my heart, spell on my mind,

your powerful potion gets me every time

I toss and turn, I can't sleep at night,

your kiss burns, through my dreams



(Chorus:)

Here it comes again,

I don't stand a chance

Soul possession,

got me in a trance

Pullin' me back to you

Deja 
voodoo



Fire in the dark, pounding in my brain,

driven by the chant calling out my name

I toss and turn, I can't sleep,

your kiss burns, through my dreams



Needles in my heart, spell on my mind,

your powerful potion gets me every time

I toss and turn, I can't sleep at night,

your kiss burns, through my dreams



(Chorus:)

Here it comes again,

I don't stand a chance

Soul possession,

got me in a trance

Pullin' me back to you

Deja voodoo
