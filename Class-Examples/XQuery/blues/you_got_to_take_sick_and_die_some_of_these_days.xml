<lyrics>



You got to take sick and die some of these days

You got to take sick and die some of these days

All the medicine you can buy and all the doctors you can hire

You got to take sick and die some of these days



Well I got to take sick and die some of these days

Well I got to take sick and die some of these

All the medicine she can buy and all the doctors she can hire

She's got to take sick and die one of these days



Probably got to take sick and die some of these days

Probably got to take sick and die some of these days

All the medicine he can buy and all the doctors he can hire

You got to take sick and die some of these days



You got to take sick and die some of these days

You got to take sick and die some of these days

All the medicine you can buy and all the doctors you can hire

You got to take sick and die some of these days



Well I got to take sick and die some of these days

Well I got to take sick and die some of these days

All the medicine he can buy and all the doctors he can hire

You got to take... (guitar ending)
