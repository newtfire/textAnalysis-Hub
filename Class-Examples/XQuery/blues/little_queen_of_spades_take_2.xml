<lyrics>



Mmm, she is a little queen of spades, and the men will not let
her be

Hoo ooo ooh, she is the little queen of spades, and the men will not
let her be

Everytime she makes a spread, hoo, cold chill just runs all over
me



Well, I'm gon' get me a gamblin' woman, if its the last thing that I
do

Ooh hoo eee, gon' get me a gamblin' woman, if its the last thing that
I do

A man don't need a woman, hoo, fair brown, he got to give all of his
money to



Well
1
 everybody say she got a 
mojo
,
baby, you've been usin' that stuff

Hmm hmm hmm, everybody say she got a mojo, 'cause she been usin' that
stuff

She got a way trimmin'
2
 down, hoo we', babe, and I mean
it's most too tough



Well, well, little girl, since I am the king, fair brown, and you is
a queen

Hoo ooh ooe, since I am the king, baby, and you is a queen

Let's we put our heads together, hoo, fair brown, then we can make
our money green
