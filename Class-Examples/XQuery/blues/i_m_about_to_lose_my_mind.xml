<lyrics>


<l>You broke my heart, baby just one too many time

</l>
<l>You broke my heart, baby just too many time

</l>
<l>From drinkin' bad whiskey, mama, gin an rum an wine



</l>
<l>Well, today you say you're quittin', tomorrow you say you're not

</l>
<l>Yes, you say you quittin', tomorrow you say you're not

</l>
<l>An if ya don't stop drinkin' baby, I swear you're gonna blow your

top




</l>
<l>Yes, drinkin' woman, you stay drunk all the time

</l>
<l>Yes, drinkin' woman, you stay drunk all the time

</l>
<l>You keep me so worried baby, I'm 'bout to lose my mind</l></lyrics></xml>
