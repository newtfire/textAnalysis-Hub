<lyrics>



You broke my heart, baby just one too many time

You broke my heart, baby just too many time

From drinkin' bad whiskey, mama, gin an rum an wine



Well, today you say you're quittin', tomorrow you say you're not

Yes, you say you quittin', tomorrow you say you're not

An if ya don't stop drinkin' baby, I swear you're gonna blow your
top



Yes, drinkin' woman, you stay drunk all the time

Yes, drinkin' woman, you stay drunk all the time

You keep me so worried baby, I'm 'bout to lose my mind
