<lyrics>


<l>When I was a young man

</l>
<l>Just gotten out

</l>
<l>I didn't know

</l>
<l>What this world was all about

</l>
<l>I was lied to, I was cheated

</l>
<l>I played all kinds of fools

</l>
<l>It didn't take me long

</l>
<l>To learn the rules



</l>
<l>Fool me once, shame on you

</l>
<l>Fool me twice, shame on me

</l>
<l>Fool me once, shame on you

</l>
<l>Fool me twice, shame on me



</l>
<l>Lady swore she loved me

</l>
<l>Loved through and through

</l>
<l>And then my pal said

</l>
<l>She said she loved him, too

</l>
<l>And the milkman and the postman

</l>
<l>And in a dream

</l>
<l>I saw her with the local

</l>
<l>Football team



</l>
<l>Fool me once, shame on you

</l>
<l>Fool me twice, shame on me

</l>
<l>Fool me once

</l>
<l>Do me as bad as you can do

</l>
<l>Shame on you

</l>
<l>Shame on you

</l>
<l>Fool me twice

</l>
<l>I'll be as mad as I can be

</l>
<l>Shame on me

</l>
<l>Shame on me



</l>
<l>Banker took my money

</l>
<l>Bought him a stake

</l>
<l>The banker swore that one day

</l>
<l>We'd both feel great

</l>
<l>Then the 80's turned to the 90's

</l>
<l>And my money can't be found

</l>
<l>Banker's on a long trip

</l>
<l>Out of town



</l>
<l>Fool me once

</l>
<l>Do me as bad as you can do

</l>
<l>Shame on you

</l>
<l>Shame on you

</l>
<l>Fool me twice

</l>
<l>I'll be as mad as I can be

</l>
<l>Shame on me

</l>
<l>Shame on me</l></lyrics></xml>
