<lyrics>



When I was a young man

Just gotten out

I didn't know

What this world was all about

I was lied to, I was cheated

I played all kinds of fools

It didn't take me long

To learn the rules



Fool me once, shame on you

Fool me twice, shame on me

Fool me once, shame on you

Fool me twice, shame on me



Lady swore she loved me

Loved through and through

And then my pal said

She said she loved him, too

And the milkman and the postman

And in a dream

I saw her with the local

Football team



Fool me once, shame on you

Fool me twice, shame on me

Fool me once

Do me as bad as you can do

Shame on you

Shame on you

Fool me twice

I'll be as mad as I can be

Shame on me

Shame on me



Banker took my money

Bought him a stake

The banker swore that one day

We'd both feel great

Then the 80's turned to the 90's

And my money can't be found

Banker's on a long trip

Out of town



Fool me once

Do me as bad as you can do

Shame on you

Shame on you

Fool me twice

I'll be as mad as I can be

Shame on me

Shame on me
