<lyrics>


<l>I'm sorry, oh, I'm sorry

</l>
<l>Oh baby, I'm sorry

</l>
<l>For the things I said to you



</l>
<l>You know I love you, you know I care

</l>
<l>With you, my new heart I want to share

</l>
<l>Darling I need you, with all your heart and soul

</l>
<l>To know that I want you, and I'll never let you go

</l>
<l>But forgive me, please forgive me

</l>
<l>Please forgive me, for I knew not what I was sayin'



</l>
<l>Come on little baby, come on darling

</l>
<l>Give me another chance, to make up on my wrong

</l>
<l>You know that I love you, you know I'll put nobody else above you

</l>
<l>Come on, come on, say that you'll love me



</l>
<l>I'm sorry, oh yes I'm sorry

</l><l>Oh I'm sorry, for the things I said t' you</l></lyrics></xml>
