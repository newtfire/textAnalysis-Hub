<lyrics>



I'm sorry, oh, I'm sorry

Oh baby, I'm sorry

For the things I said to you



You know I love you, you know I care

With you, my new heart I want to share

Darling I need you, with all your heart and soul

To know that I want you, and I'll never let you go

But forgive me, please forgive me

Please forgive me, for I knew not what I was sayin'



Come on little baby, come on darling

Give me another chance, to make up on my wrong

You know that I love you, you know I'll put nobody else above you

Come on, come on, say that you'll love me



I'm sorry, oh yes I'm sorry

Oh I'm sorry, for the things I said t' you
