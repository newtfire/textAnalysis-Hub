<lyrics>



Now, she is a little queen of spades, and the men will not let
her be

Mmm mmm, she is the little queen of spades, and the men will not let
her be

Everytime she makes a spread, hoo, fair brown, cold chill just runs
all over me



I'm gon' get me a gamblin' woman, if it's the last thing that I
do

Eee hee eee, gon' get me a gamblin' woman, if it's the last thing
that I do

Well, a man don't need a woman, hoo, fair brown, that he got to give
all his money to



Everybody say she got a 
mojo
,
now, she's been usin' that stuff

Mmmm, mmmm, everybody says she got a mojo, 'cause she been usin' that
stuff

But she got a way trimmin'1 down, hoo, fair brown, and I mean it's
most too tough



Now little girl, since I am the king, baby, and you is a queen

Ooo eee, since I am the king baby, and you is a queen

Let's us put our heads together, hoo, fair brown, then we can make
our money green



_________

Note 1: alternatively "tremblin' " instead of "trimmin' "
