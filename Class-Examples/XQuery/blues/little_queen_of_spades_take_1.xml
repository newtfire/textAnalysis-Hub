<lyrics>

<l>Now, she is a little queen of spades, and the men will not let
her be

</l>
<l>Mmm mmm, she is the little queen of spades, and the men will not let
her be

</l>
<l>Everytime she makes a spread, hoo, fair brown, cold chill just runs
all over me



</l>
<l>I'm gon' get me a gamblin' woman, if it's the last thing that I
do

</l>
<l>Eee hee eee, gon' get me a gamblin' woman, if it's the last thing
that I do

</l>
<l>Well, a man don't need a woman, hoo, fair brown, that he got to give
all his money to



</l>
<l>Everybody say she got a 
mojo
,
now, she's been usin' that stuff

</l>
<l>Mmmm, mmmm, everybody says she got a mojo, 'cause she been usin' that
stuff

</l>
<l>But she got a way trimmin'1 down, hoo, fair brown, and I mean it's
most too tough



</l>
<l>Now little girl, since I am the king, baby, and you is a queen

</l>
<l>Ooo eee, since I am the king baby, and you is a queen

</l>
<l>Let's us put our heads together, hoo, fair brown, then we can make
our money green



</l>
