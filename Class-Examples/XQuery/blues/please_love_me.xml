<lyrics>



I've been in love with you baby, honey, before I learned to
call your name

Yes, I was in love with you baby, honey, before I learned to call
your name

Yeah, the way you treatin' me baby, honey, you gonna drive old me
insane



Yeah, you know I love you, I'll do anything you tell me to

Yeah, you know I love you baby and I'll do anything you tell me
to

Well there's nothing in this world baby, honey, that I wouldn't do
for you



Well if you love me baby, honey, do everything I say

Yeah, if you love me baby, honey, do everything I say

Yes, if you don't do what I tell you, you better get on your knees
and pray



Well, I want you to be my girlfriend, baby I'm gonna be your boy

Yes, be my girlfriend, honey and I'm gonna be your boy

Yeah, I'm gonna buy you a Cadillac car, just drive where ever you
are
