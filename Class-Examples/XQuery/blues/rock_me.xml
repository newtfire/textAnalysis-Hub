<lyrics>


<l>Want you to rock me baby, rock me all night long

</l>
<l>Want you to rock me baby, rock me all night long

</l>
<l>Well I want you to rock me baby, like my back ain't got no bones



</l>
<l>Sun goin' down, the moon begin to rise

</l>
<l>Sun goin' down, the moon begin to rise

</l>
<l>Well I want you to rock me baby, till you make me satisfied



</l>
<l>See me comin', run get your rockin' chair

</l>
<l>See me comin', run get your rockin' chair

</l>
<l>Well you know I ain't no stranger, you know I used to live right

here




</l>
<l>Want you to roll me, like I roll a waggon wheel

</l>
<l>Want you to roll me, like I roll a waggon wheel

</l>
<l>You know I want you to roll me over, you know how good that makes me

feel




</l>
<l>Rock me easy, rock your baby slow

</l>
<l>Rock me easy, rock your baby slow

</l>
<l>Well you know I want you to rock me so easy, till I don't wanna rock

no more




</l>
<l>Put your arms around me, like a circle around the sun

</l>
<l>Put your arms around me, like a circle around the sun

</l>
<l>I want you to call, call me daddy, let me lay down in your arms</l></lyrics></xml>
