<lyrics>



Want you to rock me baby, rock me all night long

Want you to rock me baby, rock me all night long

Well I want you to rock me baby, like my back ain't got no bones



Sun goin' down, the moon begin to rise

Sun goin' down, the moon begin to rise

Well I want you to rock me baby, till you make me satisfied



See me comin', run get your rockin' chair

See me comin', run get your rockin' chair

Well you know I ain't no stranger, you know I used to live right
here



Want you to roll me, like I roll a waggon wheel

Want you to roll me, like I roll a waggon wheel

You know I want you to roll me over, you know how good that makes me
feel



Rock me easy, rock your baby slow

Rock me easy, rock your baby slow

Well you know I want you to rock me so easy, till I don't wanna rock
no more



Put your arms around me, like a circle around the sun

Put your arms around me, like a circle around the sun

I want you to call, call me daddy, let me lay down in your arms
