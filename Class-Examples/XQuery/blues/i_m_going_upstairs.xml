<lyrics>


<l>I'm goin' upstairs, and bring down all of my clothes

</l>
<l>I'm goin' upstairs, and bring down all of my clothes

</l>
<l>Where I go baby, you will never know



</l>
<l>My mother dead and gone, my father don't want me around

</l>
<l>My mother dead and gone, my father don't want me around

</l>
<l>Don't you know baby, I ain't got no place to go



</l>
<l>You know, you know, you don't want me no more

</l>
<l>(spoken: no you don't)

</l>
<l>You know, you know, baby you don't want me no more

</l>
<l>You can love babe, with your younger stud, baby

</l>
<l>Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho



</l>
<l>Got a house on the water, you know I don't need no land

</l>
<l>(spoken: Have mercy on me)

</l>
<l>Got a house on the water, you know I don't need no land,

</l>
<l>When I'm dead and gone, bury me in the deep blue sea

</l>
<l>Hmm-mmm, ho-ho-ho-ho-ho</l></lyrics></xml>
