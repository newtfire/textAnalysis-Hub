<lyrics>



I'm goin' upstairs, and bring down all of my clothes

I'm goin' upstairs, and bring down all of my clothes

Where I go baby, you will never know



My mother dead and gone, my father don't want me around

My mother dead and gone, my father don't want me around

Don't you know baby, I ain't got no place to go



You know, you know, you don't want me no more

(spoken: no you don't)

You know, you know, baby you don't want me no more

You can love babe, with your younger stud, baby

Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho



Got a house on the water, you know I don't need no land

(spoken: Have mercy on me)

Got a house on the water, you know I don't need no land,

When I'm dead and gone, bury me in the deep blue sea

Hmm-mmm, ho-ho-ho-ho-ho
