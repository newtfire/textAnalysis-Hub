<lyrics>



Ah, because I'm not crazy, jealous, baby, it don't mean that I don't
care

Ah, because I'm not crazy, jealous, baby, it don't mean that I don't
care

Yes, because if you keep messin' up with me, darling,

I tell you, they're gonna miss you around here



Yes, because I try to play cool, baby, yes, you seem to think that
I'm a fool

Yes, because I try to play it cool, woman, you seem to think that I'm
a fool

Yes, but I'm gonna tell you my dear, oh baby, they gonna miss you
around here



Yes, you might as well stop your horses, turn your wagon around

I know what's on your mind and I ain't goin' for what your puttin'
down

Oh, I played it cool, baby and you seem to think I'm a fool

Yes, but I'm gonna tell you my dear, that they gonna miss you around
here



Yes, stop your horses, turn your wagon around, I know what's on your
mind

I ain't goin' for what your puttin' down, because I play it cool,
baby, don't mean that I'm a fool

Yes, I'm gonna tell you, baby, they gonna miss you around here
