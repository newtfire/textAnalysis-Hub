<lyrics>


<l>Yes, I want to write a letter, but I don't know just where I
begin

</l>
<l>Yes, I want to write a letter, people, but I don't know just where I
begin

</l>
<l>Well, I tell you, it's a sin, people, the way I've been treated by my

so called friends




</l>
<l>Yes, if I got a dollar, they want to borrow half a buck, whoa, and if
I want to gamble

</l>
<l>They wanna jinx me and give me bad luck, so, I tell you it's a sin,
people

</l>
<l>The way I've been treated by my so called friends



</l>
<l>Yes, they say friends, they're the greatest thing in the world, yes,
they say close, close friends

</l>
<l>They're the greatest thing in the world, but I think that's all wrong
people

</l>
<l>Because my best friend have taken my girl</l></lyrics></xml>
