<lyrics>



Yes, I want to write a letter, but I don't know just where I
begin

Yes, I want to write a letter, people, but I don't know just where I
begin

Well, I tell you, it's a sin, people, the way I've been treated by my
so called friends



Yes, if I got a dollar, they want to borrow half a buck, whoa, and if
I want to gamble

They wanna jinx me and give me bad luck, so, I tell you it's a sin,
people

The way I've been treated by my so called friends



Yes, they say friends, they're the greatest thing in the world, yes,
they say close, close friends

They're the greatest thing in the world, but I think that's all wrong
people

Because my best friend have taken my girl
