<lyrics>



Hey, hey, mama, that ride has come and gone

I say hey, hey, mama, that ride has come and gone

I just can't see what in the world is you waiting on



I've done met a mama, she ain't long in or tall

I say I got another mama, she ain't long in or tall

But to tell you the truth, man, she's as soft as a butter ball



She got every movement from her head down to her toe

She got every movement from her head down to her toe

And she can break in on the dollar, man busting it where she goes



She was my best mama, but she wouldn't treat me right

I said she was my best mama, but she wouldn't treat me right

She wouldn't do nothin' but 
barrelhouse

all night long



I'm gonna get a mama, I mean with lots of buck

I'm gonna get a mama, I mean with lots of buck

I want to be gone mama, so I can change my luck



Be gone mama, be gone
