<lyrics>


<l>Hey, hey, mama, that ride has come and gone

</l>
<l>I say hey, hey, mama, that ride has come and gone

</l>
<l>I just can't see what in the world is you waiting on



</l>
<l>I've done met a mama, she ain't long in or tall

</l>
<l>I say I got another mama, she ain't long in or tall

</l>
<l>But to tell you the truth, man, she's as soft as a butter ball



</l>
<l>She got every movement from her head down to her toe

</l>
<l>She got every movement from her head down to her toe

</l>
<l>And she can break in on the dollar, man busting it where she goes



</l>
<l>She was my best mama, but she wouldn't treat me right

</l>
<l>I said she was my best mama, but she wouldn't treat me right

</l>
<l>She wouldn't do nothin' but 
barrelhouse

</l>
<l>all night long



</l>
<l>I'm gonna get a mama, I mean with lots of buck

</l>
<l>I'm gonna get a mama, I mean with lots of buck

</l>
<l>I want to be gone mama, so I can change my luck



</l>
<l>Be gone mama, be gone</l></lyrics></xml>
