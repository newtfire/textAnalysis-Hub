<lyrics>



You know it ain't right just to treat me this a way

Well, you know it ain't right just to treat me this a way

Well, you know, my baby, have you home one day



You know it ain't right just to treat me like you do

Well, you know it ain't right just to treat me like you do

Well, you know, my baby, coming home to you



You know it ain't right, baby, stay out all night long

Well, you know it ain't right, baby, stay out all night long

Well, you know, my baby, you done something wrong
