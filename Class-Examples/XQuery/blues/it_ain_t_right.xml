<l>You know it ain't right just to treat me this a way

</l>
<l>Well, you know it ain't right just to treat me this a way

</l>
<l>Well, you know, my baby, have you home one day



</l>
<l>You know it ain't right just to treat me like you do

</l>
<l>Well, you know it ain't right just to treat me like you do

</l>
<l>Well, you know, my baby, coming home to you



</l>
<l>You know it ain't right, baby, stay out all night long

</l>
<l>Well, you know it ain't right, baby, stay out all night long

</l>
<l>Well, you know, my baby, you done something wrong</l></lyrics></xml>
