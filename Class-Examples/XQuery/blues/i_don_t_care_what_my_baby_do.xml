<l>I don't care what my baby do

</l>
<l>Long as I'm doin' what she's doin'

</l>
<l>I don't care where my baby go

</l>
<l>Long as I'm goin' where she's goin'



</l>
<l>I don't care if my baby play

</l>
<l>Long as it's me that she's playin'

</l>
<l>I don't care where my baby stay

</l>
<l>Long as I stay where she's stayin'



</l>
<l>A man an' a dog, they tell me

</l>
<l>Have a lot in common

</l>
<l>The dog chases cars

</l>
<l>And the man chases woman



</l>
<l>(I don't care what my baby do)

</l>
<l>Long as I'm doin' what she's doin'

</l>
<l>(I don't care where my baby go)

</l>
<l>Yes, long as I'm goin' where she's goin'



</l>
<l>(I don't care if my baby plays)

</l>
<l>(Whoa-ooh no, no, no, no, no, no)

</l>
<l>Long as it's me she's playin' with

</l>
<l>(I don't care where my baby stay)

</l>
<l>Long as I stay where she's stayin'



</l>
<l>Ya can't trust a bear

</l>
<l>Alone with your honey

</l>
<l>Ya can't trust a thief

</l>
<l>Alone with your money



</l>
<l>I don't trust my cat

</l>
<l>Alone with my canary

</l>
<l>To leave a man alone with my woman

</l>
<l>Is unnecessary



</l>
<l>(I don't care what my baby do)

</l>
<l>No, long as I'm doin' what she's doin'

</l>
<l>(I don't care where my baby go)

</l>
<l>Long as I'm goin' where she's goin'



</l>
<l>Ya can't trust a bear

</l>
<l>Alone with your honey

</l>
<l>Ya can't trust a thief

</l>
<l>Alone with your money



</l>
<l>I don't trust my cat

</l>
<l>Alone with my canary

</l>
<l>To leave a man alone with my woman

</l>
<l>Is unnecessary



</l>
<l>(I don't care what my baby do)

</l>
<l>Long as I'm doin' what she's doin'

</l>
<l>(I don't care where my baby go)

</l>
<l>Long as I go where she's goin'



</l>
<l>(I don't care if my baby play)

</l>
<l>(oooooh, baby)

</l>
<l>Long as it's me she's playin'

</l>
<l>(I don't care where my baby stay)

</l>
<l>Long as I stay where she's stayin'



</l>
<l>(I don't care)



</l>
<l>(I don't care)



</l>
<l>(Woo-hoo-hoo)



</l>
<l>(I don't care)

</l>
<l>(Woo-woo-hoo-hoo)



</l>
<l>(I don't care)



</l>
<l>(I don't care, no I don't care)



</l>
<l>(Whoa! I just don't care!)



</l>
<l>(I don't care) No!



</l>
<l>(I don't care)

</l>
<l>(Oh no-whoa-ooh!)



</l>
<l>(I don't care)



</l>
<l>(I don't care)
