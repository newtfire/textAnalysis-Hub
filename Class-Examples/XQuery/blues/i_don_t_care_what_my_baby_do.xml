I don't care what my baby do

Long as I'm doin' what she's doin'

I don't care where my baby go

Long as I'm goin' where she's goin'



I don't care if my baby play

Long as it's me that she's playin'

I don't care where my baby stay

Long as I stay where she's stayin'



A man an' a dog, they tell me

Have a lot in common

The dog chases cars

And the man chases woman



(I don't care what my baby do)

Long as I'm doin' what she's doin'

(I don't care where my baby go)

Yes, long as I'm goin' where she's goin'



(I don't care if my baby plays)

(Whoa-ooh no, no, no, no, no, no)

Long as it's me she's playin' with

(I don't care where my baby stay)

Long as I stay where she's stayin'



Ya can't trust a bear

Alone with your honey

Ya can't trust a thief

Alone with your money



I don't trust my cat

Alone with my canary

To leave a man alone with my woman

Is unnecessary



(I don't care what my baby do)

No, long as I'm doin' what she's doin'

(I don't care where my baby go)

Long as I'm goin' where she's goin'



Ya can't trust a bear

Alone with your honey

Ya can't trust a thief

Alone with your money



I don't trust my cat

Alone with my canary

To leave a man alone with my woman

Is unnecessary



(I don't care what my baby do)

Long as I'm doin' what she's doin'

(I don't care where my baby go)

Long as I go where she's goin'



(I don't care if my baby play)

(oooooh, baby)

Long as it's me she's playin'

(I don't care where my baby stay)

Long as I stay where she's stayin'



(I don't care)



(I don't care)



(Woo-hoo-hoo)



(I don't care)

(Woo-woo-hoo-hoo)



(I don't care)



(I don't care, no I don't care)



(Whoa! I just don't care!)



(I don't care) No!



(I don't care)

(Oh no-whoa-ooh!)



(I don't care)



(I don't care)



Fading:

(I don't care)
