<lyrics>



They call me the hunter, that's my name

A pretty woman like you, is my only game

I bought me a love gun, just the other day

And I aim to aim it your way

Ain't no use to hide, ain't no use to run

'Cause I've got you in the sights of my love gun



The first time I saw you, standing on the street

I says to myself, "Woo, ain't she sweet"

I've got my love gun loaded, with hugs and kisses

And when I pull the trigger, there will be no misses

Ain't no need to hide, ain't no use to run

'Cause I've got you in the sights of my love gun



Ain't no use to hide, ain't no use to run

'Cause I've got you in the sights of my love gun



I'm the big bad hunter baby

How can I miss when I've got dead aim
