<lyrics>


<l>They call me the hunter, that's my name

</l>
<l>A pretty woman like you, is my only game

</l>
<l>I bought me a love gun, just the other day

</l>
<l>And I aim to aim it your way

</l>
<l>Ain't no use to hide, ain't no use to run

</l>
<l>'Cause I've got you in the sights of my love gun



</l>
<l>The first time I saw you, standing on the street

</l>
<l>I says to myself, "Woo, ain't she sweet"

</l>
<l>I've got my love gun loaded, with hugs and kisses

</l>
<l>And when I pull the trigger, there will be no misses

</l>
<l>Ain't no need to hide, ain't no use to run

</l>
<l>'Cause I've got you in the sights of my love gun



</l>
<l>Ain't no use to hide, ain't no use to run

</l>
<l>'Cause I've got you in the sights of my love gun



</l>
<l>I'm the big bad hunter baby

</l>
<l>How can I miss when I've got dead aim</l></lyrics></xml>
