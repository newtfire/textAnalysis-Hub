<lyrics>



From the little town I ran from

To the city where I strayed

There's been some good time living

And some good music played

And some good loving made

I like it

I like it just that way



I wanna roll roll roll forever

I wanna feel the beat go on

I wanna roll roll roll forever

I wanna feel it till it's gone

I wanna roll roll roll forever

And live from song to song

Right there in the music

Is right where I belong



When I meet my Maker

With my music in my hand

He'll smile down when He sees me

And ask about the band

I know He'll understand

He knows life

And life can be so grand



I wanna roll roll roll forever

I wanna feel the beat go on

I wanna roll roll roll forever

I wanna feel it till it's gone

I wanna roll roll roll forever

And live from song to song

Right there in the music

Is right where I belong
