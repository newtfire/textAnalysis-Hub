<lyrics>



Lord, this house is goin' to get raided, yes,
sir!



Thirty days in jail, with my back turned to the wall, to the
wall

Thirty days in jail, with my back turned to the wall

Look here, mister jail keeper, put another gal in my stall



I don't mind being in jail, but I got to stay there so long, so
long

I don't mind being in jail, but I got to stay there so long, so
long

Well, every friend I had is done shook hands and gone



You better stop your man from ticklin' me under my chin, under my
chin

You better stop your man from ticklin' me under my chin

'Cause if he keeps on ticklin', I'm sure gonna take him on in



Good morning blues, blues how do you do, how do you do?

Good morning blues, blues how do you do?

Well, I just come here to have a few words with you
