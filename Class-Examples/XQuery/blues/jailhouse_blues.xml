<l>Lord, this house is goin' to get raided, yes,

sir!




</l>
<l>Thirty days in jail, with my back turned to the wall, to the
wall

</l>
<l>Thirty days in jail, with my back turned to the wall

</l>
<l>Look here, mister jail keeper, put another gal in my stall



</l>
<l>I don't mind being in jail, but I got to stay there so long, so
long

</l>
<l>I don't mind being in jail, but I got to stay there so long, so
long

</l>
<l>Well, every friend I had is done shook hands and gone



</l>
<l>You better stop your man from ticklin' me under my chin, under my
chin

</l>
<l>You better stop your man from ticklin' me under my chin

</l>
<l>'Cause if he keeps on ticklin', I'm sure gonna take him on in



</l>
<l>Good morning blues, blues how do you do, how do you do?

</l>
<l>Good morning blues, blues how do you do?

</l>
<l>Well, I just come here to have a few words with you</l></lyrics></xml>
