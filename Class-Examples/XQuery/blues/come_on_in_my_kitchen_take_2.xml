<lyrics>


<l>Mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm

</l>
<l>Mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm


</l>
<l>You better come on in my kitchen, it's goin' to be rainin' outdoors

</l>
<l>When a woman gets in trouble, everybody throws her down

</l>
<l>Lookin' for yo' good friend, none can be found

</l>
<l>You better come on in my kitchen, it's goin' to be rainin' outdoors


</l>
<l>Nnn, the woman I love, took from my best friend

</l>
<l>Some joker got lucky, stole her back again

</l>
<l>She better come on in my kitchen, baby, it's goin' to be rainin' outdoors

</l>
<l>(spoken: Mama, can't you hear that wind howl?

</l>
<l>Oh how the wind do howl!)

</l>
<l>You better come on in my kitchen, baby, it's goin' to be rainin' outdoors


</l>
<l>Nnn, the woman that I love, I crave to see

</l>
<l>She's up the country, won't write to me

</l>
<l>Then, you better come on in my kitchen, goin' to be rainin' outdoors


</l>
<l>I went to the mountain, far as my eyes could see

</l>
<l>Some other man got my woman, lonesome blues got me

</l>
<l>But she better come on in my kitchen, 'cause it's goin' to be rainin' outdoors


</l>
<l>My mamma dead, papa well's
1

</l>
<l>to be, ain't got nobody to love and care for me

</l>
<l>She better come on in my kitchen, 'cause it's goin' to be rainin' outdoors


</l>
