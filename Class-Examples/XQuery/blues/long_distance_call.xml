<lyrics>


<l>You say you love me darlin',

</l>
<l>please, call me on the phone sometime

</l>
<l>You say you love me darlin',

</l>
<l>please, call me on the phone sometime

</l>
<l>When I hear your voice,

</l>
<l>ease my worried mind



</l>
<l>One of these days,

</l>
<l>I'm gonna show you how nice a man can be

</l>
<l>One of these days,

</l>
<l>I'm gonna show you just how nice a man can be

</l>
<l>I'm gonna buy you a brand, new Cadillac,

</l>
<l>if you only speak some good words about me



</l>
<l>Hear my phone ringin',

</l>
<l>sound like a long distance call

</l>
<l>Hear my phone keep ringin',

</l>
<l>sound like a long distance call

</l>
<l>When I picked up my receiver,

</l><l>the party said another mule kickin' in your stall</l></lyrics></xml>
