<lyrics>



You say you love me darlin',

please, call me on the phone sometime

You say you love me darlin',

please, call me on the phone sometime

When I hear your voice,

ease my worried mind



One of these days,

I'm gonna show you how nice a man can be

One of these days,

I'm gonna show you just how nice a man can be

I'm gonna buy you a brand, new Cadillac,

if you only speak some good words about me



Hear my phone ringin',

sound like a long distance call

Hear my phone keep ringin',

sound like a long distance call

When I picked up my receiver,

the party said another mule kickin' in your stall
