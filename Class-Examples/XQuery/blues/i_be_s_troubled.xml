I Be's Troubled

Well if I feel tomorrow, like I feel today

I'm gonna pack my suitcase, and make my getaway

Lord I'm troubled, I'm all worried in mind

And I'm never bein' satisfied, and I just can't keep from cryin'



Yeah, I know my little ol' baby, she gonna jump and shout

That ol' train be late girl, and I come walkin' out

Lord I'm troubled, I'm all worried in mind

Yeah and I'm never bein' satisfied, and I just can't keep from
cryin'



Yeah, I know somebody, who' been talkin' to you

I don't need no telling, girl, I can watch the way you do

And I be troubled, I be all worried in mind

Yeah and I'm never bein' satisfied, and I just can't keep from
cryin'

Yeah, now goodbye baby

Got no more to say



Just like I been tellin' you, girl, you're gonna have to leave my
way

Lord I'm troubled, I'm all worried in mind

Yeah and I'm never bein' satisfied, and I just can't keep from
cryin'

Yeah my baby she quit me, seem like mama was dead

I got real worried gal, and she drove it to my head

I be's troubled, I be all worried in mind

Yeah and I'm never bein' satisfied, and I just can't keep from
cryin'
