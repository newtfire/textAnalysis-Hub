<l>I Be's Troubled

</l>
<l>Well if I feel tomorrow, like I feel today

</l>
<l>I'm gonna pack my suitcase, and make my getaway

</l>
<l>Lord I'm troubled, I'm all worried in mind

</l>
<l>And I'm never bein' satisfied, and I just can't keep from cryin'



</l>
<l>Yeah, I know my little ol' baby, she gonna jump and shout

</l>
<l>That ol' train be late girl, and I come walkin' out

</l>
<l>Lord I'm troubled, I'm all worried in mind

</l>
<l>Yeah and I'm never bein' satisfied, and I just can't keep from

cryin'




</l>
<l>Yeah, I know somebody, who' been talkin' to you

</l>
<l>I don't need no telling, girl, I can watch the way you do

</l>
<l>And I be troubled, I be all worried in mind

</l>
<l>Yeah and I'm never bein' satisfied, and I just can't keep from
cryin'

</l>
<l>Yeah, now goodbye baby

</l>
<l>Got no more to say



</l>
<l>Just like I been tellin' you, girl, you're gonna have to leave my
way

</l>
