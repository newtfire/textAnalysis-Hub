<lyrics>


<l>Ain't no need to worry about it

</l>
<l>Won't do you one bit of good

</l>
<l>If you don't treat your baby

</l>
<l>Treat your baby like you should

</l>
<l>There's been a change in the weather

</l>
<l>And it's so plain to see

</l>
<l>So plain to see

</l>
<l>Everybody's welcome to try

</l>
<l>Try and get my airplane running

</l>
<l>You're the only one can make it fly



</l>
<l>You've become a habit to me

</l>
<l>You've become a habit to me

</l>
<l>You've become a habit to me

</l>
<l>You've become a habit



</l>
<l>Don't be listening to no jealous friends

</l>
<l>When they start slinging mud

</l>
<l>And don't let nobody come between

</l>
<l>'Cause I've got you in my blood

</l>
<l>I wanna start dealing, dealing

</l>
<l>Dealing in reality, reality

</l>
<l>I'm just trying to survive

</l>
<l>And keep my head above the waterline

</l>
<l>So I won't get buried alive



</l>
<l>You've become a habit to me

</l>
<l>You've become a habit to me

</l>
<l>You've become a habit to me

</l>
<l>You've become a habit



</l>
<l>Not so very long ago

</l>
<l>There was nothing you could say

</l>
<l>That ever would

</l>
<l>Have convinced me, darling

</l>
<l>I couldn't turn and walk away

</l>
<l>You got me stung out, baby

</l>
<l>Stung out on the end of your line

</l>
<l>Yeah, and the hook's in deep

</l>
<l>Got the kind of love

</l>
<l>Kind of love I wanna keep

</l>
<l>Everybody's welcome to try

</l>
<l>Try and get my airplane running

</l>
<l>You're the only one can make it fly



</l>
<l>You've become a habit to me

</l>
<l>You've become a habit to me

</l>
<l>You've become a habit to me

</l>
<l>You've become a habit



</l>
<l>No matter how hard I try

</l>
<l>I just can't break free

</l>
<l>You've become a habit to me

</l>
<l>'Cause you're my honey and I'm your bee

</l>
<l>A habit to me

</l>
<l>I said -



</l>
<l>You've become a habit to me

</l>
<l>Habit to me, habit to me</l></lyrics></xml>
