<lyrics>



Ain't no need to worry about it

Won't do you one bit of good

If you don't treat your baby

Treat your baby like you should

There's been a change in the weather

And it's so plain to see

So plain to see

Everybody's welcome to try

Try and get my airplane running

You're the only one can make it fly



You've become a habit to me

You've become a habit to me

You've become a habit to me

You've become a habit



Don't be listening to no jealous friends

When they start slinging mud

And don't let nobody come between

'Cause I've got you in my blood

I wanna start dealing, dealing

Dealing in reality, reality

I'm just trying to survive

And keep my head above the waterline

So I won't get buried alive



You've become a habit to me

You've become a habit to me

You've become a habit to me

You've become a habit



Not so very long ago

There was nothing you could say

That ever would

Have convinced me, darling

I couldn't turn and walk away

You got me stung out, baby

Stung out on the end of your line

Yeah, and the hook's in deep

Got the kind of love

Kind of love I wanna keep

Everybody's welcome to try

Try and get my airplane running

You're the only one can make it fly



You've become a habit to me

You've become a habit to me

You've become a habit to me

You've become a habit



No matter how hard I try

I just can't break free

You've become a habit to me

'Cause you're my honey and I'm your bee

A habit to me

I said -



You've become a habit to me

Habit to me, habit to me
