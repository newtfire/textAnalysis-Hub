<l>Hello, baby and baby don't you remember me?

</l>
<l>Hello, baby and baby don't you remember me?

</l>
<l>Yes, I'm the guy, Lord that travel both land and sea



</l>
<l>Lord, I come to see you, baby, Lord 'bout our love affair

</l>
<l>Lord, I come to see you, Lord 'bout our love affair

</l>
<l>Lord, what a path you weave and Lord your love ain't been nowhere



</l>
<l>Yes, you got another man, baby, and Lord, please don't tell me no
lie

</l>
<l>Yes, you got another man, Lord, please don't tell me no lies

</l>
<l>"Cause if I had to find out, baby, then Lord, somebody's bound to

die




</l>
<l>Lord, straighten up, baby, 'cause your daddy's comin' home

</l>
<l>Lord, straighten up, baby, 'cause your daddy's comin' home to
stay

</l>
<l>Lord, straighten up, baby, and see things 'lil' Johnny's way</l></lyrics></xml>
