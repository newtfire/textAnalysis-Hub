<lyrics>



Hello, baby and baby don't you remember me?

Hello, baby and baby don't you remember me?

Yes, I'm the guy, Lord that travel both land and sea



Lord, I come to see you, baby, Lord 'bout our love affair

Lord, I come to see you, Lord 'bout our love affair

Lord, what a path you weave and Lord your love ain't been nowhere



Yes, you got another man, baby, and Lord, please don't tell me no
lie

Yes, you got another man, Lord, please don't tell me no lies

"Cause if I had to find out, baby, then Lord, somebody's bound to
die



Lord, straighten up, baby, 'cause your daddy's comin' home

Lord, straighten up, baby, 'cause your daddy's comin' home to
stay

Lord, straighten up, baby, and see things 'lil' Johnny's way
