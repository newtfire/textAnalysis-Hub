<lyrics>


<l>Look over yonder's wall and a hand me down my walkin' cane

</l>
<l>Look over yonder's wall and a hand me down my walkin' cane

</l>
<l>I got another woman, baby yonder come your man



</l>
<l>Your husband went to the wall and I know it was tuff

</l>
<l>I don't know how you really feel, but I know you don't feel
enough

</l>
<l>So you look on yonder's wall and hand me down my walkin'

</l>
<l>I got another woman, baby yonder come your man



</l>
<l>Look on yonder's wall this wall and a hand me down my walkin'
cane

</l>
<l>Look on yonder's wall and a hand me down my walkin' cane

</l>
<l>I got another woman, baby yonder come your man



</l>
<l>I love you baby but you just won't treat me right

</l>
<l>Spend all of my money and walk the streets all night

</l>
<l>So you look on yonder's wall, and hand me down my walkin' cane

</l>
<l>I got another woman, baby yonder come your man</l></lyrics></xml>
