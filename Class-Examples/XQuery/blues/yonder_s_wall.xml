<lyrics>



Look over yonder's wall and a hand me down my walkin' cane

Look over yonder's wall and a hand me down my walkin' cane

I got another woman, baby yonder come your man



Your husband went to the wall and I know it was tuff

I don't know how you really feel, but I know you don't feel
enough

So you look on yonder's wall and hand me down my walkin'

I got another woman, baby yonder come your man



Look on yonder's wall this wall and a hand me down my walkin'
cane

Look on yonder's wall and a hand me down my walkin' cane

I got another woman, baby yonder come your man



I love you baby but you just won't treat me right

Spend all of my money and walk the streets all night

So you look on yonder's wall, and hand me down my walkin' cane

I got another woman, baby yonder come your man
