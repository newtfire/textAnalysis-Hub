<lyrics>


<l>When I first met you we burned like a flame

</l>
<l>Now it's gettin' colder and you know that's a same

</l>
<l>Love's out there somewhere but you know it won't come in

</l>
<l>So let's remember baby how sweet all this has been

</l>
<l>But when two real good lovers start bein' real good friends

</l>
<l>You know that's the beginning of the end



</l>
<l>I make you sparkle like strawberry wine

</l>
<l>And when I felt bad you make me feel fine

</l>
<l>Oh it's good when it's goin' and gone when it's gone

</l>
<l>We both know enough to leave well enough alone

</l>
<l>When two real good lovers start bein' real good friends

</l>
<l>Baby can't you see that's the beginning of the end



</l>
<l>The cool of the morning the heat of the night

</l>
<l>The loving was good (but you know) it just wasn't right

</l>
<l>Someday when you wake up and call out my name

</l>
<l>Don't feel bad about it I'll probably do the same

</l>
<l>But when two real good lovers start bein' real good friends

</l>
<l>Baby don't ya know that's the beginning of the end</l></lyrics></xml>
