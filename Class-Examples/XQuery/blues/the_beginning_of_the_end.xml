<lyrics>



When I first met you we burned like a flame

Now it's gettin' colder and you know that's a same

Love's out there somewhere but you know it won't come in

So let's remember baby how sweet all this has been

But when two real good lovers start bein' real good friends

You know that's the beginning of the end



I make you sparkle like strawberry wine

And when I felt bad you make me feel fine

Oh it's good when it's goin' and gone when it's gone

We both know enough to leave well enough alone

When two real good lovers start bein' real good friends

Baby can't you see that's the beginning of the end



The cool of the morning the heat of the night

The loving was good (but you know) it just wasn't right

Someday when you wake up and call out my name

Don't feel bad about it I'll probably do the same

But when two real good lovers start bein' real good friends

Baby don't ya know that's the beginning of the end
