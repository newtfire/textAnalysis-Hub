<lyrics>


<l>She told me she'd been loved before

</l>
<l>If I took a little less

</l>
<l>She'd give a little more

</l>
<l>She told me she'd been hurt a lot

</l>
<l>But somehow she still knew

</l>
<l>What a woman's love was for



</l>
<l>She said if I would take a second-hand woman

</l>
<l>The night wouldn't be so long

</l>
<l>She said if I would take a second-hand woman

</l>
<l>She'd put love where love belonged

</l>
<l>I said that's alright with me

</l>
<l>I'll do everything I can

</l>
<l>After all baby I'm a second-hand man



</l>
<l>I showed her Where I hid the scars

</l>
<l>From all the battles I had fought

</l>
<l>In lost and lonely wars

</l>
<l>It took al night for us to understand

</l>
<l>Life had led to us

</l>
<l>Loves old soft and healing hand</l></lyrics></xml>
