<lyrics>



She told me she'd been loved before

If I took a little less

She'd give a little more

She told me she'd been hurt a lot

But somehow she still knew

What a woman's love was for



She said if I would take a second-hand woman

The night wouldn't be so long

She said if I would take a second-hand woman

She'd put love where love belonged

I said that's alright with me

I'll do everything I can

After all baby I'm a second-hand man



I showed her Where I hid the scars

From all the battles I had fought

In lost and lonely wars

It took al night for us to understand

Life had led to us

Loves old soft and healing hand
