<lyrics>



Went to a party, the New York style

I met a lady, make a sane man wild

She said the words only her lips could say

She made me want to throw my life away

But when I asked her, she said, "Maybe tomorrow, B.B."

And that's a story everybody knows



I took her flying, out across the sea

I thought I had her, I know that she had me

And when we landed, it was Paris, France

Seemed like a nice place, for some French romance

But when I touched her, she said, "Maybe a little later, B.B."

And that's the story everybody knows



We went to Berlin, and to Stockholm too

And on the Moscow, then to the Peking Zoo

As far as travel, she couldn't get too much

Somewhere in Oakland, she let me have just a little touch

And then she said, "I'm late for beauty appointment,

I've got a headache, and I believe I'm coming down with the flu"

And that's the story everybody knows
