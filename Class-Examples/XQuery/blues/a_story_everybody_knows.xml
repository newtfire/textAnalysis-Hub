<lyrics>


<l>Went to a party, the New York style

</l>
<l>I met a lady, make a sane man wild

</l>
<l>She said the words only her lips could say

</l>
<l>She made me want to throw my life away

</l>
<l>But when I asked her, she said, "Maybe tomorrow, B.B."

</l>
<l>And that's a story everybody knows



</l>
<l>I took her flying, out across the sea

</l>
<l>I thought I had her, I know that she had me

</l>
<l>And when we landed, it was Paris, France

</l>
<l>Seemed like a nice place, for some French romance

</l>
<l>But when I touched her, she said, "Maybe a little later, B.B."

</l>
<l>And that's the story everybody knows



</l>
<l>We went to Berlin, and to Stockholm too

</l>
<l>And on the Moscow, then to the Peking Zoo

</l>
<l>As far as travel, she couldn't get too much

</l>
<l>Somewhere in Oakland, she let me have just a little touch

</l>
<l>And then she said, "I'm late for beauty appointment,

</l>
<l>I've got a headache, and I believe I'm coming down with the flu"

</l>
<l>And that's the story everybody knows</l></lyrics></xml>
