<lyrics>

<l>(Spoken:

</l>
<l>Memphis Slim: Say, look-a-her man, do you know Jaspar's got a new gal
in town?

</l>
<l>Man replies: Sho' nuf man?

</l>
<l>Memphis Slim: Yeah man!

</l>
<l>Other man: Well, tell me about her)



</l>
<l>Now he's got a girl, she's shaped like a hog

</l>
<l>Her voice reminds me of an old bull dog

</l>
<l>Her hair looks just like, a chinchilla coat

</l>
<l>You get close up on her, she smells just like a goat



</l>
<l>You know she's smellin'

</l>
<l>Got b.o.
1
all the time </l>
<l>
And she thinks soap and water

</l>
<l>Is a doggone crime



</l>
<l>Now her ears are so long, her nose is flat

</l>
<l>Her head's so big she can't wear no hat

</l>
<l>Now her jaws are swollen and she's got one eye

</l>
<l>She looks like a wreck that happened, last July



</l>
<l>She's a ugly

</l>
<l>Got b.o. all the time

</l>
<l>And she thinks soap and water

</l>
<l>Is a doggone crime



</l>
<l>Now she must-a been her mother, only child

</l>
<l>She should be a gorilla because she sure is wild

</l>
<l>Got ways like a monkey, and sly as a fox

</l>
<l>She should be in a chain gang, breakin' up rocks



</l>
<l>Because she's ugly

</l>
<l>Got b.o. all the time

</l>
<l>And she thinks soap and water

</l>
<l>Is a doggone crime



</l>
<l>Now she got legs like a needle

</l>
<l>She ain't got no chin

</l>
<l>She's a beautiful woman for the shape she's in

</l>
<l>Her feet look like swings way out on a limb

</l>
<l>That's why her mother put her off on him



</l>
<l>Because she bo-gish

</l>
<l>She's got b.o. all the time

</l>
<l>And she thinks soap and water

</l>
<l>Is a doggone crime



</l>
