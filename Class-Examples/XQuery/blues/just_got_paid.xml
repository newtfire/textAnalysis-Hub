<lyrics>



I just got paid today, got me a pocket full of change

Said, I just got paid today, got me a pocket full of change

If you believe like workin' hard all day, just step in my shoes and
take my pay



I was born my papa's son, when I hit the ground I was on the run

I had one glad hand and the other behind, you can have yours, just
give me mine

When the hound dog barkin' in the black of the night, stick my hand
in my pocket, everything's all right



I just got paid today, got me a pocket full of change

Said, black sheep, black, do you got some wool?

Yes, I do, man, my bag is full

It's the root of evil and you know the rest but it's way ahead of
what's second best
