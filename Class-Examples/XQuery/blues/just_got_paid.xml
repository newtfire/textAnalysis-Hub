<lyrics>


<l>I just got paid today, got me a pocket full of change

</l>
<l>Said, I just got paid today, got me a pocket full of change

</l>
<l>If you believe like workin' hard all day, just step in my shoes and

take my pay




</l>
<l>I was born my papa's son, when I hit the ground I was on the run

</l>
<l>I had one glad hand and the other behind, you can have yours, just
give me mine

</l>
<l>When the hound dog barkin' in the black of the night, stick my hand

in my pocket, everything's all right




</l>
<l>I just got paid today, got me a pocket full of change

</l>
<l>Said, black sheep, black, do you got some wool?

</l>
<l>Yes, I do, man, my bag is full

</l><l>It's the root of evil and you know the rest but it's way ahead of</l>
<l>what's second best</l></lyrics></xml>
