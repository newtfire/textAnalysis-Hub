(Spoken:

Hey!

It's the house rent boogie)



I come home last Friday, talk to the woman that I lost my job

She says don't confront me an' so I have my rent next Friday

An' next Friday come, I didn't have the rent an' out the door I
went

Yes, yes!



Hmm, hmm

Yes, yes!



Come here now y'all, right 'cross the street here

Help me get this rent together

Some give me a nickel and some give me a dime



I'm tired of keepin' this movin' every night

I can't hold out much longer

Now I got this rent, now let's get together, y'all

Let's have a ball



Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
