<l>(Spoken:

</l>
<l>Hey!

</l>
<l>It's the house rent boogie)



</l>
<l>I come home last Friday, talk to the woman that I lost my job

</l>
<l>She says don't confront me an' so I have my rent next Friday

</l>
<l>An' next Friday come, I didn't have the rent an' out the door I
went

</l>
<l>Yes, yes!



</l>
<l>Hmm, hmm

</l>
<l>Yes, yes!



</l>
<l>Come here now y'all, right 'cross the street here

</l>
<l>Help me get this rent together

</l>
<l>Some give me a nickel and some give me a dime



</l>
<l>I'm tired of keepin' this movin' every night

</l>
<l>I can't hold out much longer

</l>
<l>Now I got this rent, now let's get together, y'all

</l>
<l>Let's have a ball



</l>
<l>Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!</l></lyrics></xml>
