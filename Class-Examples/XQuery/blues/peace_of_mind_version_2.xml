<lyrics>


<l>I've had everything

</l>
<l>That money can buy

</l>
<l>But still I'm so unhappy

</l>
<l>That I could cry

</l>
<l>Because I've never

</l>
<l>Had peace of mind

</l>
<l>People, in my lifetime



</l>
<l>When you're in trouble

</l>
<l>And all down and out

</l>
<l>Then you'll find out

</l>
<l>What it's all about

</l>
<l>Then you'll realize

</l>
<l>That peace of mind

</l>
<l>Darling, is hard to find



</l>
<l>I've been everywhere

</l>
<l>Seen everything

</l>
<l>But I only have myself to blame

</l>
<l>For not realizing while

</l>
<l>I was riding high

</l>
<l>That happiness is something

</l>
<l>Money can't buy



</l>
<l>Oh, the things I haven't done, baby

</l>
<l>Are very few

</l>
<l>I've had my troubles

</l>
<l>And good luck too

</l>
<l>But I've never

</l>
<l>Had peace of mind

</l>
<l>Darling, in my lifetime



</l>
<l>Oh, I've been everywhere

</l>
<l>Seen everything

</l>
<l>But I only have myself to blame

</l>
<l>Oh, for not realizing while

</l>
<l>I was riding high

</l>
<l>That happiness is something

</l>
<l>Money can't buy



</l>
<l>Oh, the things I haven't done, baby

</l>
<l>Are very few

</l>
<l>Yes, I've had my troubles

</l>
<l>And good luck too

</l>
<l>But I've never

</l>
<l>Had peace of mind

</l>
<l>Darling, in my lifetime

</l>
<l>Darling, in my lifetime</l></lyrics></xml>
