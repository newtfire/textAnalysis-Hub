<lyrics>



I get later on in the evenin' time, I feel like, like blowin'
my horn

I woke up this mo'nin, find my, my little baby gone, hmm

Later on in the evenin', main man, I feel like, like blowin' my
horn

Well I, woke up this mo'nin' baby, find my little baby gone



A well now, some folks say they worry, worry blues ain't bad

That's a misery feelin' child, I most, most ever had

Some folks tell me, man I did worry, the blues ain't bad

Well that's a misery ole feelin', honey now, well gal, I most ever
had



Well, brooks run into the ocean, ocean run in, into the sea

If I don't find my baby somebody gonna, gonna bury me, um-hm

Brook run into the ocean, child, ocean run into the sea

Well, if I don't find my baby now, well gal, you gonna have to bury
me



Yes, minutes seem like hours an hours seem like days

Seems like my baby would stop her, her lowdown ways, hey

Minutes seem like hours child, an hours seem like days

Yes, seem like my woman now, well gal, she might stop her lowdown
ways



Well now I'm, I'm leavin' this mo'nin' if I had-a, whoa ride the
blind

I feel mistreated girl you know now, I don't mind dyin'

Leavin' this mo'nin, tell ya I had-a now ride the blind

Yeah, been mistreated baby now, baby an I don't mind dyin'
