<l>I got my brand on you

</l>
<l>I got my brand on you

</l>
<l>I got my brand on you

</l>
<l>I got my brand on you

</l>
<l>There ain't nothin' you can do honey

</l>
<l>I got my brand on you



</l>
<l>Oh you may go away and leave me girl, I declare you can't stay

</l>
<l>You gonna come runnin' back to me some lonesome day

</l>
<l>I got my brand on you

</l>
<l>I got my brand on you

</l>
<l>There ain't nothin' you can do darlin'

</l>
<l>I got my brand on you



</l>
<l>Oh I'm puttin' my brand you know baby on no certain part

</l>
<l>But whenever I kiss you I stab it in your heart

</l>
<l>I got my brand on you

</l>
<l>I got my brand on you

</l>
<l>There ain't nothin' you can do baby

</l>
<l>I got my brand on you



</l>
<l>Oh I got you like a fish baby, you know hangin' on my line

</l>
<l>I can reel you in, most any time

</l>
<l>I got my brand on you

</l>
<l>I got my brand on you

</l>
<l>There ain't nothin' you can do baby

</l>
<l>I got my brand on you</l></lyrics></xml>
