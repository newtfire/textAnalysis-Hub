<lyrics>



I got my brand on you

I got my brand on you

I got my brand on you

I got my brand on you

There ain't nothin' you can do honey

I got my brand on you



Oh you may go away and leave me girl, I declare you can't stay

You gonna come runnin' back to me some lonesome day

I got my brand on you

I got my brand on you

There ain't nothin' you can do darlin'

I got my brand on you



Oh I'm puttin' my brand you know baby on no certain part

But whenever I kiss you I stab it in your heart

I got my brand on you

I got my brand on you

There ain't nothin' you can do baby

I got my brand on you



Oh I got you like a fish baby, you know hangin' on my line

I can reel you in, most any time

I got my brand on you

I got my brand on you

There ain't nothin' you can do baby

I got my brand on you
