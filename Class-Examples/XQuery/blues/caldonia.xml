Walk with my baby

She got great big feet

She long, lean, lanky

An had nothin' to eat



She's my baby

I love her just the same

Yeah an I'm crazy 'bout this woman cause

Caldonia..., your name



Caldonia!

Caldonia!

Don't take your big head so hard?

I love ya

I love ya just the same

You know I'm crazy 'bout this woman because

Caldonia..., your name



Spoken:

You know what?

(What's that?)

My mother told me to leave that girl alone

(I thought that was a good woman, ain't nothin' wrong with you)

I don't doubt it boy, but my mother can't

Understand the girl and she doesn't like her

So I'm gonna go right now to her house, find her

Call her just one more time

I hope she hear me?

(Oh she gonna hear you alright!)

Caldonia, Caldonia!

What makes your big head so hard?

What!



I love ya

I love you just the same

You know I'm crazy 'bout this woman

Pine Top

Caldonia ..., your name

I love that girl, boy!



Spoken:

Now you know!

(What?)

My mother keep on tellin' me

That you're the one, no kiddin' buddy

I heard what you said

(Your mother jivin', boy)

Now, she said son, she will bale you around if the moment is good

Puttin' down what I did...

So now I've gotta go back out and call her, one more, once

I need one more, ya hear?

Caldonia, 'donia

{What make your big head so hard?}



(I loose her

Loves her just the same)



And I dreams about ya baby

'Cause Caldonia is your name



{All-right}



Spoken:

Now you know

(What?)

My mother keep on tellin' me, to leave that girl alone!

(No kiddin' that's what you said)

No, she said son

(Say what?)

She still would bat me around, but mama wouldn't hear

It wasn't cool, so I'm gonna have to go

Back to the house you know

And call her, one more time



'Donia! Donia! (Donia...(Donia)

What makes your big head so hard?

{I loves her, loves her just the same

Now I'm crazy 'bout ya baby, 'cause Caldonia is your name}



(Yeah I'm crazy 'bout ya baby)

(Wild about ya baby)

I mean crazy 'bout ya baby

(Wild about ya baby)

Crazy 'bout ya baby

(Wild about ya baby)

(Crazy 'bout ya baby)

(Wild about ya baby)

(And I'm crazy 'bout ya baby

'Cause Caldonia is your name)

(Wild about ya baby)

Crazy 'bout ya baby

(Wild about ya baby)

Crazy 'bout ya baby

(Wild about ya darlin')

I love your style little girl

(Wild about ya baby)

Crazy 'bout ya baby)

(Wild about ya baby

'Cause downtown you here tonight)
