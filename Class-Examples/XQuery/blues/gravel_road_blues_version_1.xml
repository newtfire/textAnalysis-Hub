<lyrics>


<l>I'm goin' down that gravel road, take that right hand road

</l>
<l>I'm goin' down that gravel road, take that right hand road

</l>
<l>Lord, I ain't gonna stop walkin' 'till I get in sweet mama's door



</l>
<l>Well, that girl I'm lovin' got that great long, curly hair

</l>
<l>Well, that girl I'm lovin' got that great long, curly hair

</l>
<l>Lord, her mama and her papa sure don't 'low
1
me there </l>

<l>I got to study some scheme to get my baby to herself

</l>
<l>I got to study some scheme, Lord, to get my baby to herself

</l>
<l>Lord, I love that woman, I don't want nobody else



</l>
<l>I looked down that road, baby, just as far as I could see

</l>
<l>I looked down that road just as far as I could see

</l>
<l>There was a bunch of women, Lord, they be followin' me



</l>
<l>Well, the brook run into the ocean, the ocean run into that deep,
blue sea

</l>
<l>Lord, the brook run into the ocean, the river run into that deep,
blue sea

</l>
<l>You ought to seen the women, Lord, they be fishin' after me
