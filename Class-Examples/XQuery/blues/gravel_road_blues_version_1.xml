<lyrics>



I'm goin' down that gravel road, take that right hand road

I'm goin' down that gravel road, take that right hand road

Lord, I ain't gonna stop walkin' 'till I get in sweet mama's door



Well, that girl I'm lovin' got that great long, curly hair

Well, that girl I'm lovin' got that great long, curly hair

Lord, her mama and her papa sure don't 'low
1
 me there



I got to study some scheme to get my baby to herself

I got to study some scheme, Lord, to get my baby to herself

Lord, I love that woman, I don't want nobody else



I looked down that road, baby, just as far as I could see

I looked down that road just as far as I could see

There was a bunch of women, Lord, they be followin' me



Well, the brook run into the ocean, the ocean run into that deep,
blue sea

Lord, the brook run into the ocean, the river run into that deep,
blue sea

You ought to seen the women, Lord, they be fishin' after me
