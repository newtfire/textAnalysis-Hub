<l>Oh the blues ain't nothin' but your lover on your mind

</l>
<l>Oh the blues ain't nothin' but your lover on your mind

</l>
<l>The man that keeps you worried, and always cryin'



</l>
<l>Oh the blues ain't nothin' but a good woman wanting to see her
man

</l>
<l>Oh the blues ain't nothin' but a good woman wanting to see her
man

</l>
<l>She can't get when she want him, gotta catch him when she can



</l>
<l>Oh the blues ain't nothin' but a slow achin' heart disease

</l>
<l>Oh the blues ain't nothin' but a slow achin' heart disease

</l>
<l>Just like consumption, it kills you by degrees



</l>
<l>Oh the blues ain't nothin' but a woman that cries night and day

</l>
<l>Oh the blues ain't nothin' but a woman that cries night and day

</l>
<l>Cryin' about her lover, another woman took him away



</l>
<l>Oh papa papa papa, mama done gone mad

</l>
<l>Oh papa papa papa, mama done gone mad

</l><l>Oh the blues ain't nothin' but a good woman feelin' bad</l></lyrics></xml>
