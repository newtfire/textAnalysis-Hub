<lyrics>



Oh the blues ain't nothin' but your lover on your mind

Oh the blues ain't nothin' but your lover on your mind

The man that keeps you worried, and always cryin'



Oh the blues ain't nothin' but a good woman wanting to see her
man

Oh the blues ain't nothin' but a good woman wanting to see her
man

She can't get when she want him, gotta catch him when she can



Oh the blues ain't nothin' but a slow achin' heart disease

Oh the blues ain't nothin' but a slow achin' heart disease

Just like consumption, it kills you by degrees



Oh the blues ain't nothin' but a woman that cries night and day

Oh the blues ain't nothin' but a woman that cries night and day

Cryin' about her lover, another woman took him away



Oh papa papa papa, mama done gone mad

Oh papa papa papa, mama done gone mad

Oh the blues ain't nothin' but a good woman feelin' bad
