<lyrics>



Ring-a-ling with the telephone

Is the man of the house home

Your master card is overdue

We need a payment from you

Right now

Right away

I ain't got nothing to send you today

But I'm gonna give you all your money

Soon as I get paid



The joint was jumping

It was Saturday night

Her hair was long

And her dress was tight

I looked at her

She looked at me

And the champagne started flowing

Till a quarter to three

Look Mr. Bartender

I'm gonna make it okay

Ill give you all your money

Soon as I get paid



Monday morning

Money's gone

It's a doggone shame

Don't worry

Ill get you straight

We'll be fine

You'll get yours

When I get mine



Got a letter

From the IRS

Saying your tax return

Is a terrible mess

We want our money

We don't like to wait

Please come in and see us

On such and such a date

Right now

Right away

Don't get crazy

Don't try no mess

Or we'll take all your money

Soon as you get paid

Soon as you get paid
