<l>Ring-a-ling with the telephone

</l>
<l>Is the man of the house home

</l>
<l>Your master card is overdue

</l>
<l>We need a payment from you

</l>
<l>Right now

</l>
<l>Right away

</l>
<l>I ain't got nothing to send you today

</l>
<l>But I'm gonna give you all your money

</l>
<l>Soon as I get paid



</l>
<l>The joint was jumping

</l>
<l>It was Saturday night

</l>
<l>Her hair was long

</l>
<l>And her dress was tight

</l>
<l>I looked at her

</l>
<l>She looked at me

</l>
<l>And the champagne started flowing

</l>
<l>Till a quarter to three

</l>
<l>Look Mr. Bartender

</l>
<l>I'm gonna make it okay

</l>
<l>Ill give you all your money

</l>
<l>Soon as I get paid



</l>
<l>Monday morning

</l>
<l>Money's gone

</l>
<l>It's a doggone shame

</l>
<l>Don't worry

</l>
<l>Ill get you straight

</l>
<l>We'll be fine

</l>
<l>You'll get yours

</l>
<l>When I get mine



</l>
<l>Got a letter

</l>
<l>From the IRS

</l>
<l>Saying your tax return

</l>
<l>Is a terrible mess

</l>
<l>We want our money

</l>
<l>We don't like to wait

</l>
<l>Please come in and see us

</l>
<l>On such and such a date

</l>
<l>Right now

</l>
<l>Right away

</l>
<l>Don't get crazy

</l>
<l>Don't try no mess

</l>
<l>Or we'll take all your money

</l>
<l>Soon as you get paid

</l>
<l>Soon as you get paid</l></lyrics></xml>
