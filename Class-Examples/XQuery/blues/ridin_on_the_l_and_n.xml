<lyrics>

<l>Around the bend in the L&amp;N
1

</l>
<l>They loaded it down with a lot of men

</l>
<l>The whistle blow and through the switch
2

</l>
<l>Nobody knew just-a which one switch

</l>
<l>I'm ridin', ridin on the L&amp;N

</l>
<l>I ain't 
jivin'
, ridin' on
the L&amp;N



</l>
<l>Well a man named Quin on the L&amp;N

</l>
<l>Runnin'
3
around on how she's been </l>
<l>
Train slowed down and the men jumped off

</l>
<l>I wasn't dead 'cause I heard him callin'

</l>
<l>I'm ridin', ridin' on the L&amp;N

</l>
<l>I ain't jivin', ridin' on the L&amp;N



</l>
<l>A man named Mose with a great big nose

</l>
<l>Sleepin' on that pile of toes

</l>
<l>The doctor came and he rang the bell

</l>
<l>The palla alla
4
get well, well, well </l>
<l>
I'm ridin', ridin' on the L&amp;N

</l>
<l>I ain't jivin', ridin' on the L&amp;N



</l>
<l>(Spoken: Walter Trout on guitar!)

<note>Note 1: L&amp;N, the Louisville (Kentucky) &amp; Nashville
(Tennessee) Railroad (L&amp;N) was chartered March 5 1850 and a 186
mile line was opened between its namesake cities on October 27, 1859.
Pictures of the L&amp;Nare available at the site of the

The
Louisville &amp; Nashville Railroad Historical Society
;

Note 2: switch, a device made usually of two movable rails and
necessary connections and designed to turn a locomotive or train from
one track to another. Also, a railroad siding (a short railroad track
connected with the main track);

Notes 3 and 4: Runnin' and "palla alla" these parts of the transcript
are still very questionable, suggestions are 
welcome
