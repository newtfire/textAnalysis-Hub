<lyrics>


<l>I woke up this mornin' and all my shrimps was dead and gone

</l>
<l>I woke up this mornin', ooh, and all my shrimp was dead and gone

</l>
<l>I was thinkin' about you, baby, why you hear me weep and moan


</l>
<l>I got dead shrimps here, someone is fishin' in my pond

</l>
<l>I got dead shrimps here, ooh, someone fishin' in my pond

</l>
<l>I've served my best bait, baby, and I can't do that no harm
1

</l>
<l>Everything I do, babe, you got your mouth stuck out

</l>
<l>Hole where I used to fish, you got me posted out

</l>
<l>Everything I do, you got your mouth stuck out,

</l>
<l>at the hole where I used to fish, baby, you've got me posted out


</l>
<l>I got dead shrimps here, 'n' someone fishin' in my pond

</l>
<l>I got dead shrimps here, someone fishin' in my pond

</l>
<l>Catchin' my goggle-eye perches, and they barbequin' the bone


</l>
<l>Now you taken my shrimps, baby, you know you turned me down

</l>
<l>I couldn't do nothin', until I got myself unwound

</l>
<l>You taken my shrimps, oohh, know you turned me down

</l>
<l>Babe, I couldn't do nothin', until I got myself unwound

</l>
