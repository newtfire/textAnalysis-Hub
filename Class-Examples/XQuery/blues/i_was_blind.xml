<lyrics>


<l>I was blind and I could not see

</l>
<l>That you were gettin' away from me

</l>
<l>But now I know that you are gone



</l>
<l>I live by the night

</l>
<l>And slumber through the day

</l>
<l>Because life don't seem worth livin' anyway



</l>
<l>If I could only see

</l>
<l>Life would be so miserable to me

</l>
<l>Tell me why my love want leave in misery



</l>
<l>Oh, now I haven't be true

</l>
<l>But this I want to be my wife

</l>
<l>So baby please, please think of you and me



</l>
<l>If I could only see

</l>
<l>Life would be so miserable to me

</l>
<l>Why would the one I love want to leave in misery



</l>
<l>Oh, haven't been true all of my life

</l>
<l>Ah, but this one I want, want her to be my wife

</l>
<l>So baby please, baby please think of you and me</l></lyrics></xml>
