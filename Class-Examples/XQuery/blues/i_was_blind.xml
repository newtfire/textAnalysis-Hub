<lyrics>



I was blind and I could not see

That you were gettin' away from me

But now I know that you are gone



I live by the night

And slumber through the day

Because life don't seem worth livin' anyway



If I could only see

Life would be so miserable to me

Tell me why my love want leave in misery



Oh, now I haven't be true

But this I want to be my wife

So baby please, please think of you and me



If I could only see

Life would be so miserable to me

Why would the one I love want to leave in misery



Oh, haven't been true all of my life

Ah, but this one I want, want her to be my wife

So baby please, baby please think of you and me
