<lyrics>



When I come home in the morning

And I knock on the door

I don't get that glad-to-see-you welcome

The glad-to-see-you welcome any more

Oh but to me

It's just like it used to be, baby

Because you are still my woman



You know a change have come

And I guess I'll blame it on fate

The thing that once was love

It now seems to turn to hate

Oh I guess it's too late

For me now, baby

But you are still my woman



You know I tried to be

The man you wanted me to be

But whatever I do, baby

It seems to add to your misery

Oh you can do

What you want to, baby

But you are still my woman



You know I'm still hoping and praying

That someday I'll find

Someone to love me

So I can have love and peace of mind

Oh I still love you

Like I did before, baby

Because you are still my woman



Your friends are all telling you

That I'm a no good so-and-so

They say that love and affection

Have now turned to a heart

A heart that's old and cold

It's the same old story

Same old story that's so often told



You are still my woman
