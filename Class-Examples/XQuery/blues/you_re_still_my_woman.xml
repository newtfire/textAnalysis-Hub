<lyrics>


<l>When I come home in the morning

</l>
<l>And I knock on the door

</l>
<l>I don't get that glad-to-see-you welcome

</l>
<l>The glad-to-see-you welcome any more

</l>
<l>Oh but to me

</l>
<l>It's just like it used to be, baby

</l>
<l>Because you are still my woman



</l>
<l>You know a change have come

</l>
<l>And I guess I'll blame it on fate

</l>
<l>The thing that once was love

</l>
<l>It now seems to turn to hate

</l>
<l>Oh I guess it's too late

</l>
<l>For me now, baby

</l>
<l>But you are still my woman



</l>
<l>You know I tried to be

</l>
<l>The man you wanted me to be

</l>
<l>But whatever I do, baby

</l>
<l>It seems to add to your misery

</l>
<l>Oh you can do

</l>
<l>What you want to, baby

</l>
<l>But you are still my woman



</l>
<l>You know I'm still hoping and praying

</l>
<l>That someday I'll find

</l>
<l>Someone to love me

</l>
<l>So I can have love and peace of mind

</l>
<l>Oh I still love you

</l>
<l>Like I did before, baby

</l>
<l>Because you are still my woman



</l>
<l>Your friends are all telling you

</l>
<l>That I'm a no good so-and-so

</l>
<l>They say that love and affection

</l>
<l>Have now turned to a heart

</l>
<l>A heart that's old and cold

</l>
<l>It's the same old story

</l>
<l>Same old story that's so often told



</l>
<l>You are still my woman</l></lyrics></xml>
