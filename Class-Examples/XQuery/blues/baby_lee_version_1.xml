<l>Baby Lee, don't do me like you do

</l>
<l>Baby Lee, don't do me like you do

</l>
<l>I love you baby, you never treat me right



</l>
<l>Takin' you downtown, you carried me through the mill

</l>
<l>Takin' you downtown baby, you carried me through the mill

</l>
<l>Now you wanna treat me, and treat me like a child



</l>
<l>Baby Lee, please don't do me wrong

</l>
<l>Baby Lee, please don't do me wrong

</l>
<l>I love you gal, I just can't stand your way



</l>
<l>Baby Lee, you know you ain't treat me right

</l>
<l>Baby Lee, you know you ain't treat me right

</l>
<l>You take all my money, wanna treat me like a child



</l>
<l>Baby Lee, please don't do me wrong

</l>
<l>Baby Lee, you know I love you

</l>
<l>Please don't do me wrong honey

</l>
