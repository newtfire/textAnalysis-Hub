<lyrics>



Baby Lee, don't do me like you do

Baby Lee, don't do me like you do

I love you baby, you never treat me right



Takin' you downtown, you carried me through the mill

Takin' you downtown baby, you carried me through the mill

Now you wanna treat me, and treat me like a child



Baby Lee, please don't do me wrong

Baby Lee, please don't do me wrong

I love you gal, I just can't stand your way



Baby Lee, you know you ain't treat me right

Baby Lee, you know you ain't treat me right

You take all my money, wanna treat me like a child



Baby Lee, please don't do me wrong

Baby Lee, you know I love you

Please don't do me wrong honey

I love you Baby Lee

You won't treat me right
