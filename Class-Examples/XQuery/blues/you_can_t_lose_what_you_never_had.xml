Had a sweet little girl, I lose my baby, boy ain't that bad

Had a sweet little girl, I lose my baby, boy ain't that bad

You can't spend what you ain't got,

you can't lose some little girl you ain't never had



Had money in the bank, I got busted, people ain't that bad

Had money in the bank, I got busted, people ain't that bad

You can't spend what you ain't got,

you can't lose some little girl you ain't never had



Ain't that the truth boys



Had a sweet little home, it got burned down, people ain't that
bad

My own fault, people ain't that bad

Well you know you can't spend what you ain't got,

you can't lose some blues you ain't never had



Have mercy!



Sweet little home, got burned down, people ain't that bad

Yeah you know I had a sweet little home, it got burned down, people
ain't that bad

Whoa you know you can't spend what you ain't got,

you can't lose some little girl you ain't never had
