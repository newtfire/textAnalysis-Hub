</l>
<l>you can't lose some little girl you ain't never had



</l>
<l>Had money in the bank, I got busted, people ain't that bad

</l>

</l>
<l>You can't spend what you ain't got,

</l>
<l>you can't lose some little girl you ain't never had



</l>
<l>Ain't that the truth boys



</l>
<l>Had a sweet little home, it got burned down, people ain't that
bad

</l>
<l>My own fault, people ain't that bad

</l>
<l>Well you know you can't spend what you ain't got,

</l>
<l>you can't lose some blues you ain't never had



</l>
<l>Have mercy!



</l>
<l>Sweet little home, got burned down, people ain't that bad

</l>
<l>Yeah you know I had a sweet little home, it got burned down, people
ain't that bad

</l>
