<lyrics>



I'm a cross cut saw, just drag me 'cross your log

I'm a cross cut saw, just drag me across your log

I cut your wood so easy for you, you can't help but say 'Hot
dog!'



I've got a double-bladed axe, that really cuts good

I'm a cross cut saw, just bury me in the wood



I'm a cross cut saw, just drag me 'cross your log

I cut your wood so easy for you, you can't help but say 'Hot
dog!'



Some call me wood-choppin' Sam

Some call me wood-cuttin' Ben

Last girl I cut the wood for, want me back again



I'm a cross cut saw, just drag me 'cross your log

I cut your wood so easy for you, you can't help but say 'Hot
dog!'
