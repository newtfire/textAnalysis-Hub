<lyrics>


<l>I'm a cross cut saw, just drag me 'cross your log

</l>
<l>I'm a cross cut saw, just drag me across your log

</l>
<l>I cut your wood so easy for you, you can't help but say 'Hot

dog!'




</l>
<l>I've got a double-bladed axe, that really cuts good

</l>
<l>I'm a cross cut saw, just bury me in the wood



</l>
<l>I'm a cross cut saw, just drag me 'cross your log

</l>
<l>I cut your wood so easy for you, you can't help but say 'Hot

dog!'




</l>
<l>Some call me wood-choppin' Sam

</l>
<l>Some call me wood-cuttin' Ben

</l>
<l>Last girl I cut the wood for, want me back again



</l>
<l>I'm a cross cut saw, just drag me 'cross your log

</l><l>I cut your wood so easy for you, you can't help but say 'Hot</l>
<l>dog!'</l></lyrics></xml>
