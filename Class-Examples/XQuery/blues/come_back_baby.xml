<lyrics>



Come back, baby, don't break up my home

Yeah, you know I'm gonna miss you darlin'

After you are gone

Come back, baby, can we talk it over one more time



Oh baby, you know this world wasn't made in one day

Woah, we can talk it over, darling

Before you go away

Come back baby, let's talk it over one more time



Well now, baby, don't break up my heart

Well, Lord it hurts me so bad, darling

For us to have to part

So come back, baby, yeah, we can talk it over one more time



Well, come back, baby, you know just what I love you

Well, if I can't be with you, darling

Send me to heaven above

So come back, baby

Can't we talk it over, one more time
