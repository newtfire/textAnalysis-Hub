<l>Come back, baby, don't break up my home

</l>
<l>Yeah, you know I'm gonna miss you darlin'

</l>
<l>After you are gone

</l>
<l>Come back, baby, can we talk it over one more time



</l>
<l>Oh baby, you know this world wasn't made in one day

</l>
<l>Woah, we can talk it over, darling

</l>
<l>Before you go away

</l>
<l>Come back baby, let's talk it over one more time



</l>
<l>Well now, baby, don't break up my heart

</l>
<l>Well, Lord it hurts me so bad, darling

</l>
<l>For us to have to part

</l>
<l>So come back, baby, yeah, we can talk it over one more time



</l>
<l>Well, come back, baby, you know just what I love you

</l>
<l>Well, if I can't be with you, darling

</l>
<l>Send me to heaven above

</l>
<l>So come back, baby

</l>
<l>Can't we talk it over, one more time</l></lyrics></xml>
