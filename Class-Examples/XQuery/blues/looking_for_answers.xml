<lyrics>


<l>How many times must I sit here and tell
you goodbye

</l>
<l>How many times must I sit all alone and cry

</l>
<l>How many times must I ask mercy on me

</l>
<l>How many times must I beg to be free



</l>
<l>Well I'm looking for answers

</l>
<l>Looking for answers and nobody knows

</l>
<l>Well I'm looking for answers

</l>
<l>Looking for answers and nobody knows

</l>
<l>Well I'm looking for answers from above not from below



</l>
<l>How many times must I learn to live

</l>
<l>How many times must I learn to love to give

</l>
<l>How many times must I get down on my knees to pray

</l>
<l>How many times must I pray for you to stay



</l>
<l>Well I'm looking for answers

</l>
<l>Looking for answers and nobody knows

</l>
<l>Well I'm looking for answers

</l>
<l>Looking for answers and nobody knows

</l>
<l>Well I'm looking for answers from above not from below



</l>
<l>Lord I love you in so many ways

</l>
<l>Lord I love you each and every day

</l>
<l>Now is the time when I must ask you why

</l>
<l>Why must we live and why must we die



</l>
<l>Well I'm looking for answers

</l>
<l>Looking for answers and nobody knows

</l>
<l>Said I'm looking for answers

</l>
<l>Looking for answers and nobody knows

</l>
<l>Well I'm looking for answers from above not from below



</l><l>Ooh, ooh, oooh</l></lyrics></xml>
