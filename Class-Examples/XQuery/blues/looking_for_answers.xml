<lyrics>



How many times must I sit here and tell
you goodbye

How many times must I sit all alone and cry

How many times must I ask mercy on me

How many times must I beg to be free



Well I'm looking for answers

Looking for answers and nobody knows

Well I'm looking for answers

Looking for answers and nobody knows

Well I'm looking for answers from above not from below



How many times must I learn to live

How many times must I learn to love to give

How many times must I get down on my knees to pray

How many times must I pray for you to stay



Well I'm looking for answers

Looking for answers and nobody knows

Well I'm looking for answers

Looking for answers and nobody knows

Well I'm looking for answers from above not from below



Lord I love you in so many ways

Lord I love you each and every day

Now is the time when I must ask you why

Why must we live and why must we die



Well I'm looking for answers

Looking for answers and nobody knows

Said I'm looking for answers

Looking for answers and nobody knows

Well I'm looking for answers from above not from below



Ooh, ooh, oooh
