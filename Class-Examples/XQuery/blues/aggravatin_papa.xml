<lyrics>



I know a triflin'
1
 man, they call him Triflin'
Sam

He lives in Birmingham, way down in Alabam'

Then the other night he had a fight,

with a gal named Mandy Brown

She plainly stated he was aggravating,

as she shouted out to him



Aggravatin' papa, don't you try to two-time me
2
,

I said don't two-time me

Aggravatin' papa, treat me kind or let me be,

I mean just let me be

Listen while I get you told

Stop messin' round sweet 
jelly
roll

If you stay out with a high-brown baby

I'll smack you down and I don't mean maybe

Aggravatin' papa, I'll do anything you say

Anything you say

But when you go 
struttin'
,
do you strut around my way, so papa

Just treat me pretty, be nice and kind

The way you're treating me will make me lose my mind

Aggravatin' papa, don't you try to two-time me



Just treat me pretty, be nice and sweet

I got a darn forty-four
3
 that don't repeat

Aggravatin' papa, don't you try to two-time me
