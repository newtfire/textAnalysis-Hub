<lyrics>

<l>I know a triflin'
1
man, they call him Triflin' </l>
<l>Sam

</l>
<l>He lives in Birmingham, way down in Alabam'

</l>
<l>Then the other night he had a fight,

</l>
<l>with a gal named Mandy Brown

</l>
<l>She plainly stated he was aggravating,

</l>
<l>as she shouted out to him



</l>
<l>Aggravatin' papa, don't you try to two-time me
2
,

</l>
<l>I said don't two-time me

</l>
<l>Aggravatin' papa, treat me kind or let me be,

</l>
<l>I mean just let me be

</l>
<l>Listen while I get you told

</l>
<l>Stop messin' round sweet 
jelly
roll

</l>
<l>If you stay out with a high-brown baby

</l>
<l>I'll smack you down and I don't mean maybe

</l>
<l>Aggravatin' papa, I'll do anything you say

</l>
<l>Anything you say

</l>
<l>But when you go 
struttin'
,
do you strut around my way, so papa

</l>
<l>Just treat me pretty, be nice and kind

</l>
<l>The way you're treating me will make me lose my mind

</l>
<l>Aggravatin' papa, don't you try to two-time me



</l>
<l>Just treat me pretty, be nice and sweet

</l>
<l>I got a darn forty-four
3
 </l><l>that don't repeat</l>
<l>
Aggravatin' papa, don't you try to two-time me



</l>
