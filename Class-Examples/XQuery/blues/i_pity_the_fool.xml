I pity the fool

I said I pity the fool

I pity the fool

I said I pity the fool

That falls in love with you

And expects you to be true

Oh I pity the fool



Look at the people

I know you're wondering

What they're doing

They're just standing there

Watching you make a fool of me



Look at the people

I know you're wondering

What they're doing

They're just standing there

Watching you make a fool of me



Oh I pity the fool

I pity the fool

That falls in love with you

I pity the fool

I pity the fool

m, that falls in love with you

I pity the fool

I pity the fool



She'll break your heart one day

Then she'll laugh and walk away

Oh I pity the fool



Look at the people

I know you're wondering

What they're doing

They're just standing there

Watching you make a fool of me



Look at the people

I said I know you're wondering

What they're doing

They're just standing there

Watching you make a fool of me



Oh I pity the fool

I pity the fool

That falls in love with you

I pity the fool



Yeah, I pity the fool

I pity the fool

That falls in love with you



She'll break your heart one day

Then she'll laugh and walk away

Oh I pity the fool, oh yeah



Look at the people

Look at the people

I know you're wondering

What they're doing

What are they doing, man

Look, they're just standing there

They're just standing there

Watching you make a fool of me



Tell me again, man



Look at the people

Look at the people

I know you're wondering

What they're doing

What are they doing, man

Look, they're just standing there

They're just standing there

Watching you make a fool of me
