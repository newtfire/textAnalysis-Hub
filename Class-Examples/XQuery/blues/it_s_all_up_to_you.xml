<lyrics>



I'm so disgusted and broken hearted, too

I'm so disgusted and broken hearted, too

Though I'm disappointed in your love, baby that's alright for you



There's no need of you lyin', babe you know I've been good to you

Yeah-eay, babe I've been good to you

But if I leave you now, baby, go ahead and do what you wanna do



You know I had a good woman and she was so kind and true

Yeah, good woman, and she was so kind and true

I even let her go, baby, on account of you, yes, I know



Get offa my back, woman!



But she's willin' to forgive me, so I'll leave it all up to you

Hey, umm, leave it all up to you

She told me when I was leavin', that your love wasn't really true
