<lyrics>



Well, I wanna tell the story about a hard luck guy

Nobody seems to love me, I guess that's the reason why



Just dreams, dreams all night long and through the day

Yes, and it's so sad, oh, to break my heart this way



Yes, I'm not handsome or romantic, I don't have wavy hair

Won't you girls please have mercy, the way you treat me ain't
fair



Why does bad luck follow me

Oh, dreams, seems that's all that's left for me



Well, I just can't get no place with a doggone thing a plan

Every girl I try my luck on belongs to some other man

Where, where, where is the one I'm dreaming of

All gone, gone with last night's dreams of love



Yes, last night as I lay sleepin', I dreamed about a queen

And it hurt me so bad, people

To wake up and find out it was just a dream



Dream, dream is all I can do

Oh, I'm so tired dreamin' dreams, dreams

That won't come true
