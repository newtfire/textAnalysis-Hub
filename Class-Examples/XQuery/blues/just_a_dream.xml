<lyrics>


<l>Well, I wanna tell the story about a hard luck guy

</l>
<l>Nobody seems to love me, I guess that's the reason why



</l>
<l>Just dreams, dreams all night long and through the day

</l>
<l>Yes, and it's so sad, oh, to break my heart this way



</l>
<l>Yes, I'm not handsome or romantic, I don't have wavy hair

</l>
<l>Won't you girls please have mercy, the way you treat me ain't

fair




</l>
<l>Why does bad luck follow me

</l>
<l>Oh, dreams, seems that's all that's left for me



</l>
<l>Well, I just can't get no place with a doggone thing a plan

</l>
<l>Every girl I try my luck on belongs to some other man

</l>
<l>Where, where, where is the one I'm dreaming of

</l>
<l>All gone, gone with last night's dreams of love



</l>
<l>Yes, last night as I lay sleepin', I dreamed about a queen

</l>
<l>And it hurt me so bad, people

</l>
<l>To wake up and find out it was just a dream



</l>
<l>Dream, dream is all I can do

</l>
<l>Oh, I'm so tired dreamin' dreams, dreams

</l><l>That won't come true</l></lyrics></xml>
