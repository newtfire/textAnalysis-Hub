<l>Layin' in bed this mornin' with my face turned to the wall

</l>
<l>Layin' in bed this mornin' with my face turned to the wall

</l>
<l>Trying to count these blues so I could sing 'em all




</l>
<l>Memphis, Ramport, 

</l>
<l>Beale Street set 'em, free


</l>
<l>Memphis, Ramport,

</l>
<l>Beale Street set 'em, free


</l>
<l>Graveyard 'Bama Bound, Lord, Lord, come from stingaree



</l>
<l>Lord sittin' on the Southern
1
gonna ride all night long </l>
<l>
Lord sittin' on the Southern 

</l>
<l>gonna ride all night long


</l>
<l>Downhearted, Gulf Coast - they was all good songs



</l>
<l>Lord, 'rested at midnight, Jailhouse made me loose my mind

</l>
<l>Lord, 'rested at midnight, Jailhouse made me loose my mind


</l>
<l>Bad Luck 'n' Boll-Weevil, made me think of old Moonshine



</l>
<l>Lord, goin' to sleep now for Mama just got bad news

</l>
<l>Lord, goin' to sleep now for Mama just got bad news

</l>
<l>To try to dream away my troubles, countin' these blues
