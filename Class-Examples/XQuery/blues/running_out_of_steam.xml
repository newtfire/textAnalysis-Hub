<lyrics>


<l>I've been chasin' after you babe

</l>
<l>It seem like a mighty long time

</l>
<l>Oh, I think I'm about to reach

</l>
<l>Reach the end of my line



</l>
<l>Oh, the more I think of you baby

</l>
<l>The further from me you get, it seems

</l>
<l>Oh, I guess I'm never gonna catch you, baby

</l>
<l>'Cause I'm 'bout runnin' out a-steam



</l>
<l>Aww,

</l>
<l>The first time I saw you girl

</l>
<l>It marked the beginnin' of my chase

</l>
<l>I've been runnin' after you ever since

</l>
<l>And I haven't got any place



</l>
<l>Oh, the more I chase you baby

</l>
<l>The further from me you get it seems

</l>
<l>Oh, I guess I ain't never gonna catch you girl

</l>
<l>'Cause I'm 'bout runnin' out a-steam



</l>
<l>Even though I really love you girl

</l>
<l>Chasin' you is just like chasin' the devil

</l>
<l>The harder I run, the more ya have fun

</l>
<l>Now I know you wouldn't care if it lasts forever



</l>
<l>'Cause the more I chase ya baby

</l>
<l>The further from me you get it seems

</l>
<l>I guess I ain't never gonna catch you girl

</l>
<l>'Cause I'm 'bout runnin' out a-steam



</l><l>Oh!</l></lyrics></xml>
