<lyrics>



I've been chasin' after you babe

It seem like a mighty long time

Oh, I think I'm about to reach

Reach the end of my line



Oh, the more I think of you baby

The further from me you get, it seems

Oh, I guess I'm never gonna catch you, baby

'Cause I'm 'bout runnin' out a-steam



Aww,

The first time I saw you girl

It marked the beginnin' of my chase

I've been runnin' after you ever since

And I haven't got any place



Oh, the more I chase you baby

The further from me you get it seems

Oh, I guess I ain't never gonna catch you girl

'Cause I'm 'bout runnin' out a-steam



Even though I really love you girl

Chasin' you is just like chasin' the devil

The harder I run, the more ya have fun

Now I know you wouldn't care if it lasts forever



'Cause the more I chase ya baby

The further from me you get it seems

I guess I ain't never gonna catch you girl

'Cause I'm 'bout runnin' out a-steam



Oh!
