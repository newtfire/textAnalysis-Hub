<lyrics>



Well I'm tore down, I'm almost level with the ground

Well I'm tore down, I'm almost level with the ground

Well I feel like this, when my baby can't be found



Well I went to the river, to jump in

My baby showed up and said, "I will tell you when"



Well I'm tore down, I'm almost level with the ground

Well I feel like this, when my baby can't be found



I love you baby with all my heart an' soul

A love like mine will never grow old

I love you in the morning and in the evening too

But ev'rytime you leave me I get mad with you



Well I'm tore down, I'm almost level with the ground

Well I feel like this, when my baby can't be found



I love you baby with all my might

A love like mine is out a sight

I'll lie for you if you want me to

I really don't believe your love is true



Well I'm tore down, I'm almost level with the ground

Well I feel like this when my baby can't be found



Well I'm tore down, I'm almost level with the ground

Well I'm tore down, 'm almost level with the ground

Well I feel like this, when my baby can't be found
