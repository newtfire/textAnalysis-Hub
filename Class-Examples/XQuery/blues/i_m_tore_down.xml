<lyrics>


<l>Well I'm tore down, I'm almost level with the ground

</l>
<l>Well I'm tore down, I'm almost level with the ground

</l>
<l>Well I feel like this, when my baby can't be found



</l>
<l>Well I went to the river, to jump in

</l>
<l>My baby showed up and said, "I will tell you when"



</l>
<l>Well I'm tore down, I'm almost level with the ground

</l>
<l>Well I feel like this, when my baby can't be found



</l>
<l>I love you baby with all my heart an' soul

</l>
<l>A love like mine will never grow old

</l>
<l>I love you in the morning and in the evening too

</l>
<l>But ev'rytime you leave me I get mad with you



</l>
<l>Well I'm tore down, I'm almost level with the ground

</l>
<l>Well I feel like this, when my baby can't be found



</l>
<l>I love you baby with all my might

</l>
<l>A love like mine is out a sight

</l>
<l>I'll lie for you if you want me to

</l>
<l>I really don't believe your love is true



</l>
<l>Well I'm tore down, I'm almost level with the ground

</l>
<l>Well I feel like this when my baby can't be found



</l>
<l>Well I'm tore down, I'm almost level with the ground

</l>
<l>Well I'm tore down, 'm almost level with the ground

</l>
<l>Well I feel like this, when my baby can't be found



</l>
