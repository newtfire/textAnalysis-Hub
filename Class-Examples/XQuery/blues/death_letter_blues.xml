<lyrics>



I received a letter that my man was dyin'

I received a letter that my man was dyin'

I caught the first plane and went home flyin'



When I got there the folks had gathered around

When I got there the folks had gathered around

His eyes was set and his face was full of frowns



He wasn't dead but he was slowly dyin'

He wasn't dead but he was slowly dyin'

And to think of him I just can't help from cryin'



I followed my daddy to the buryin' ground

I followed my daddy to the buryin' ground

I watched the pall bearers slowly let him down



That was the last time I saw my daddy's face

That was the last time I saw my daddy's face

Mama love you sweet papa but I wish I could take your place
