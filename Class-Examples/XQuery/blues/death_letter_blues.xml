<lyrics>


<l>I received a letter that my man was dyin'

</l>
<l>I received a letter that my man was dyin'

</l>
<l>I caught the first plane and went home flyin'



</l>
<l>When I got there the folks had gathered around

</l>
<l>When I got there the folks had gathered around

</l>
<l>His eyes was set and his face was full of frowns



</l>
<l>He wasn't dead but he was slowly dyin'

</l>
<l>He wasn't dead but he was slowly dyin'

</l>
<l>And to think of him I just can't help from cryin'



</l>
<l>I followed my daddy to the buryin' ground

</l>
<l>I followed my daddy to the buryin' ground

</l>
<l>I watched the pall bearers slowly let him down



</l>
<l>That was the last time I saw my daddy's face

</l>
<l>That was the last time I saw my daddy's face

</l>
<l>Mama love you sweet papa but I wish I could take your place</l></lyrics></xml>
