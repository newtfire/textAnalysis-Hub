<lyrics>



Yes, I'm goin' down in Florida,

where the sun shines damn near every day

Well, well I'm goin' down in Florida,

where the sun shines damn near every day

Yeah, I'll take my woman out on the beach fellas 'n,

and sit down on the sand and play



Yeah, well I think I'll go down in Gainesville,

just to see an old friend of mine

Well, I believe I'll cut down in Gainesville,

oh, just to see an' old buddy of mine

Well, you know if we're not too busy,

I believe that I'm gonna drop over in Uberry sometime



(spoken:

Let's go back to Florida

Let's go back down to Florida,

where the sun shines)



Yeah, I believe I'm gonna leave tomorrow,

well, I'm gonna be on my way

Yes, I'm gonna have a plenty of time,

well, I don't wanna make myself late

Well, you know I believe I'll go back down in Gainesville,

and this time I'm goin' to stay

Let's rise, let's rise



Yeah, deep down in Florida,

well, well that's the place I long to be

Well, oh deep down in Florida,

well that's the place I long to be

Well, oh let me take my baby out in the backyard in the, backyard
people,

and sit down under the old orange tree
