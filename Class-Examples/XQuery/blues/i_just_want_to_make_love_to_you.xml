<lyrics>


<l>I don't want you to

</l>
<l>Be no slave

</l>
<l>I don't want you

</l>
<l>To wake all day

</l>
<l>I don't want you

</l>
<l>To be true

</l>
<l>I just want to make

</l>
<l>Love to you



</l>
<l>I don't want you to

</l>
<l>Wash my clothes

</l>
<l>I don't want you

</l>
<l>To keep our home

</l>
<l>I don't want your

</l>
<l>Money too

</l>
<l>I just want to make

</l>
<l>Love to you

</l>
<l>Love to you

</l>
<l>Love to you

</l>
<l>Love to you



</l>
<l>They tell about the way you

</l>
<l>Switch and walk

</l>
<l>Now I can see by the way you

</l>
<l>Baby talk

</l>
<l>Now I can know by the way you

</l>
<l>Treat your man

</l>
<l>That I could love you baby until the

</l>
<l>Cryin' shame

</l>
<l>I don't want you to

</l>
<l>Cook my bread

</l>
<l>I don't want you

</l>
<l>To make my bed

</l>
<l>I don't want to

</l>
<l>Because I'm sad and blue

</l>
<l>I just want to make

</l>
<l>Love to you

</l>
<l>Love to you

</l>
<l>Love to you

</l>
<l>Love to you

</l>
<l>Love to you</l></lyrics></xml>
