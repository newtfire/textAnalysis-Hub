<lyrics>



I don't want you to

Be no slave

I don't want you

To wake all day

I don't want you

To be true

I just want to make

Love to you



I don't want you to

Wash my clothes

I don't want you

To keep our home

I don't want your

Money too

I just want to make

Love to you

Love to you

Love to you

Love to you



They tell about the way you

Switch and walk

Now I can see by the way you

Baby talk

Now I can know by the way you

Treat your man

That I could love you baby until the

Cryin' shame

I don't want you to

Cook my bread

I don't want you

To make my bed

I don't want to

Because I'm sad and blue

I just want to make

Love to you

Love to you

Love to you

Love to you

Love to you
