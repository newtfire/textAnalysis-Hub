<lyrics>



If heartaches brought fame

In love's crazy game

I'd be a legend in my time

If they gave gold statuettes

For tears and regrets

I'd be a legend in my time



But they don't give awards

And there's no praise or fame

For a heart that's been broken

Over love that's in vain

If loneliness meant world acclaim

Then everyone would know my name

I'd be a legend in my time



But they don't give awards

And there's no praise or fame

For a heart that's been broken

Over love that's in vain

If loneliness meant world acclaim

Then everyone would know my name

I'd be a legend in my time



I'd be a legend in my time
