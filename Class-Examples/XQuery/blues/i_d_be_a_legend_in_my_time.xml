<lyrics>


<l>If heartaches brought fame

</l>
<l>In love's crazy game

</l>
<l>I'd be a legend in my time

</l>
<l>If they gave gold statuettes

</l>
<l>For tears and regrets

</l>
<l>I'd be a legend in my time



</l>
<l>But they don't give awards

</l>
<l>And there's no praise or fame

</l>
<l>For a heart that's been broken

</l>
<l>Over love that's in vain

</l>
<l>If loneliness meant world acclaim

</l>
<l>Then everyone would know my name

</l>
<l>I'd be a legend in my time



</l>
<l>But they don't give awards

</l>
<l>And there's no praise or fame

</l>
<l>For a heart that's been broken

</l>
<l>Over love that's in vain

</l>
<l>If loneliness meant world acclaim

</l>
<l>Then everyone would know my name

</l>
<l>I'd be a legend in my time



</l>
<l>I'd be a legend in my time</l></lyrics></xml>
