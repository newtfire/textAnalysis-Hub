Sugar mama sugar mama

Sugar mama please come on back to me

Sugar mama sugar mama

Sugar mama please come on back to me

Yes, bring me back my sugar, baby

Please ease my misery



Yes, I'm crazy about my sugar sugar mama

Ain't nobody else got but you

Yes, I'm crazy about my sugar sugar mama

Ain't no-one else got but you

Well, you got that granulate sugar sugar mama

You done made me love you too



Yes, they braggin' about your sugar sugar

Baby they been braggin' about it all over town

Yes, they braggin' about your sugar sugar

They been braggin' about it all over town

Well, the bootleggers want to buy it to make liquor baby

But you don't want to sell them about four or five pounds



Yes I'm crazy about my coffee sweet in the morning

Same thing with my tea at night

I love my coffee sweet in the morning baby

Same thing with my tea at night

Well, if I don't get my sugar three times a day

Oh yes, I don't feel right
