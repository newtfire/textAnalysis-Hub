<lyrics>


<l>Get it while it's hot



</l>
<l>I've been all over Europe

</l>
<l>And across the sea

</l>
<l>With each new place

</l>
<l>It gets clearer to me

</l>
<l>Week after week

</l>
<l>On tour with my band

</l>
<l>You don't have to speak

</l>
<l>'Cause they all understand



</l>
<l>The power of the blues

</l>
<l>Hey, hey, the power of the blues

</l>
<l>And that's good news

</l>
<l>I'm talking about the power of the blues



</l>
<l>Yes, it's just a few changes

</l>
<l>That I won't deny

</l>
<l>But if you think it's easy

</l>
<l>You just give it a try

</l>
<l>You know the truth

</l>
<l>But you're afraid to say it

</l>
<l>That it ain't what I play

</l>
<l>It's the way that I play it



</l>
<l>That's the power of the blues

</l>
<l>Yes, the power of the blues

</l>
<l>You'll change your views

</l>
<l>When you hear the power of the blues



</l>
<l>Now me and Lucille

</l>
<l>We're gonna stop this war

</l>
<l>I'm no politician

</l>
<l>But I know the score

</l>
<l>You can call me a hawk

</l>
<l>Or maybe I'm a dove

</l>
<l>But all we gotta do

</l>
<l>Is shoot 'em full of love



</l>
<l>With the power of the blues

</l>
<l>Hey, the power of the blues

</l>
<l>It's the thing to use

</l>
<l>Talking about the power of the blues

</l>
<l>Yes, I am</l></lyrics></xml>
