<lyrics>



Get it while it's hot



I've been all over Europe

And across the sea

With each new place

It gets clearer to me

Week after week

On tour with my band

You don't have to speak

'Cause they all understand



The power of the blues

Hey, hey, the power of the blues

And that's good news

I'm talking about the power of the blues



Yes, it's just a few changes

That I won't deny

But if you think it's easy

You just give it a try

You know the truth

But you're afraid to say it

That it ain't what I play

It's the way that I play it



That's the power of the blues

Yes, the power of the blues

You'll change your views

When you hear the power of the blues



Now me and Lucille

We're gonna stop this war

I'm no politician

But I know the score

You can call me a hawk

Or maybe I'm a dove

But all we gotta do

Is shoot 'em full of love



With the power of the blues

Hey, the power of the blues

It's the thing to use

Talking about the power of the blues

Yes, I am
