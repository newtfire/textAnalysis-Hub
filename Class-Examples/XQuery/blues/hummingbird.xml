<lyrics>


<l>Sometimes I get impatient,

</l>
<l>but she cools me without words

</l>
<l>And she comes so sweet and so plain,

</l>
<l>my hummingbird and have you heard,

</l>
<l>that I thought my life had ended

</l>
<l>But I find that it's just begun,

</l>
<l>'cause she gets me where I live

</l>
<l>I'll give all I have to give

</l>
<l>I'm talking about that hummingbird

</l>
<l>Oh she's little and she loves me,

</l>
<l>too much for words to say

</l>
<l>When I see her in the morning sleeping,

</l>
<l>she's little and she loves me

</l>
<l>To my lucky day

</l>
<l>Hummingbird don't fly away



</l>
<l>When I'm feeling wild and lonesome

</l>
<l>she knows the words to say

</l>
<l>And she gives me a little understanding,

</l>
<l>in her special way

</l>
<l>And I just have to say,

</l>
<l>in my life I loved a woman

</l>
<l>Because she's more than I deserve,

</l>
<l>and she gets me where I live

</l>
<l>I'll give all I have to give

</l>
<l>I'm talking about that hummingbird

</l>
<l>Oh she's little and she loves me,

</l>
<l>too much for words to say

</l>
<l>When I see her in the morning sleeping,

</l>
<l>she's little and she loves me

</l>
<l>To my lucky day,

</l>
<l>hummingbird don't fly away</l></lyrics></xml>
