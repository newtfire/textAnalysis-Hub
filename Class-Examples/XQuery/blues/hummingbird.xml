<lyrics>



Sometimes I get impatient,

but she cools me without words

And she comes so sweet and so plain,

my hummingbird and have you heard,

that I thought my life had ended

But I find that it's just begun,

'cause she gets me where I live

I'll give all I have to give

I'm talking about that hummingbird

Oh she's little and she loves me,

too much for words to say

When I see her in the morning sleeping,

she's little and she loves me

To my lucky day

Hummingbird don't fly away



When I'm feeling wild and lonesome

she knows the words to say

And she gives me a little understanding,

in her special way

And I just have to say,

in my life I loved a woman

Because she's more than I deserve,

and she gets me where I live

I'll give all I have to give

I'm talking about that hummingbird

Oh she's little and she loves me,

too much for words to say

When I see her in the morning sleeping,

she's little and she loves me

To my lucky day,

hummingbird don't fly away
