<lyrics>



They picked me up an' put me in the county jail

They picked me up an' put me in the county jail

They wouldn't even let my woman, come an' call my bail



Now I'm in prison, but I've almost did my time

Now I'm in prison, but I've almost did my time

They give me six months, but I had to work off nine



'Cause I know my baby, she's gonna jump an' shout

I know my baby, she's gonna jump an' shout

When that train roll up, an' I come up walkin' out



Now play it Mr. Tampa!



So take these stripes from around me

Chain away from around my leg

These stripes from around me

An' these chain from around my leg

Well, these stripes don't hurt me

But these chains gonna kill me dead



__________

Note: vocals by Big Maceo and Tampa Red.
