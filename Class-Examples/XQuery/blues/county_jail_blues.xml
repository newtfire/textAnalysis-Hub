<lyrics>


<l>They picked me up an' put me in the county jail

</l>
<l>They picked me up an' put me in the county jail

</l>
<l>They wouldn't even let my woman, come an' call my bail



</l>
<l>Now I'm in prison, but I've almost did my time

</l>
<l>Now I'm in prison, but I've almost did my time

</l>
<l>They give me six months, but I had to work off nine



</l>
<l>'Cause I know my baby, she's gonna jump an' shout

</l>
<l>I know my baby, she's gonna jump an' shout

</l>
<l>When that train roll up, an' I come up walkin' out



</l>
<l>Now play it Mr. Tampa!



</l>
<l>So take these stripes from around me

</l>
<l>Chain away from around my leg

</l>
<l>These stripes from around me

</l>
<l>An' these chain from around my leg

</l>
<l>Well, these stripes don't hurt me

</l>
<l>But these chains gonna kill me dead



</l>
