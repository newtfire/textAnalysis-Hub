<lyrics>


<l>Well, early in the morning I wake with the rising sun

</l>
<l>Yes, early in the morning I wake with the rising sun

</l>
<l>It's my daily motto and the people all calls it fun



</l>
<l>Yes, I'm looking for a better future and forgetting about my past

</l>
<l>I'm looking for a better future and forgetting about my past

</l>
<l>Now I'm so glad that troubles don't always last



</l>
<l>Yes, have fun whilst you can 'cause fate's an awful thing

</l>
<l>Well, have fun whilst you can 'cause fate's an awful thing

</l>
<l>You can't tell what may happen that's the reason I love to sing</l></lyrics></xml>
