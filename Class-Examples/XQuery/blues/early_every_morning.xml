<lyrics>



Well, early in the morning I wake with the rising sun

Yes, early in the morning I wake with the rising sun

It's my daily motto and the people all calls it fun



Yes, I'm looking for a better future and forgetting about my past

I'm looking for a better future and forgetting about my past

Now I'm so glad that troubles don't always last



Yes, have fun whilst you can 'cause fate's an awful thing

Well, have fun whilst you can 'cause fate's an awful thing

You can't tell what may happen that's the reason I love to sing
