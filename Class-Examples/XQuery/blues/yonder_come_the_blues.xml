<lyrics>


<l>I worry all day, I worry all night

</l>
<l>Every time my man comes home, he wants to fuss and fight

</l>
<l>When I pick up the paper to read about the news,

</l>
<l>just as I'm satisfied, yonder comes the blues



</l>
<l>I went down to the river each and every day

</l>
<l>Trying to keep from crying' and do my self away

</l>
<l>I walked and walked till I wore out my shoes

</l>
<l>I can't walk no further, yonder comes the blues



</l>
<l>Some folks never worry, things all go all right

</l>
<l>Or lay down on that sofa, weep and cry all night

</l>
<l>When I get a letter, it never brings good news

</l>
<l>Every time I see the mail, babe, yonder comes the blues



</l>
<l>Go back blues don't come this way

</l>
<l>Oughta give me something else beside the blues all day

</l>
<l>Every man I love, I've been refused

</l>
<l>And when I want some loving yonder comes the blues



</l>
<l>People have different blues and think their mighty bad

</l>
<l>But blues that bother me are the worst I've ever had

</l><l>I've been disgusted and all confused every time I look around yonder</l>
<l>come those blues</l></lyrics></xml>
