<lyrics>



I worry all day, I worry all night

Every time my man comes home, he wants to fuss and fight

When I pick up the paper to read about the news,

just as I'm satisfied, yonder comes the blues



I went down to the river each and every day

Trying to keep from crying' and do my self away

I walked and walked till I wore out my shoes

I can't walk no further, yonder comes the blues



Some folks never worry, things all go all right

Or lay down on that sofa, weep and cry all night

When I get a letter, it never brings good news

Every time I see the mail, babe, yonder comes the blues



Go back blues don't come this way

Oughta give me something else beside the blues all day

Every man I love, I've been refused

And when I want some loving yonder comes the blues



People have different blues and think their mighty bad

But blues that bother me are the worst I've ever had

I've been disgusted and all confused every time I look around yonder
come those blues
