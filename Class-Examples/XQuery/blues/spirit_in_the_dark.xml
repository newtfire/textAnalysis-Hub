<lyrics>



Are you getting the spirit in the dark

Are you getting the spirit in the dark

People moving, ah, tell me we're grooving

Just getting the spirit in the dark



Tell me, sisters, how do you feel

Tell me, my brothers, my brothers

How do you feel

(Do you feel like dancing)

Get up there and let's start dancing

(Get up and let's start dancing)

Start getting in the spirit

Oh, getting in the dark

(Spirit in the dark)



Just like Sally Walker

Sitting in a saucer

That's how you do it

Just go on, get on up to it

Ride, Sally, ride

Put your hands on your hips

Cover your eyes, and move

(Come on get it)

Get in the spirit

(Move with the spirit)

Come on and move, get in the spirit

(Darling, move, move with the spirit)

Oh move, get in the spirit

Help me move

(Move)

With the spirit

(Spirit)



Are you getting the spirit

(Spirit in the dark)

I wanna know, are you getting the spirit

(Getting the spirit)

Getting it in the spirit

Are you getting the spirit

(Getting the spirit)

Keep moving

Oh hey, we're rocking and grooving

Just getting in the spirit

(Getting the spirit)

Oh in the dark



We're gonna do it one more time

It's just like Sally Walker

Sitting in that great big flying saucer

Hey, that's how you do it

Get down and get on up to it

(Come on and get it)

Ride, Sally, ride

Put your hands on your hips

Cover your eyes, and move

(Move, move on)

Move with the spirit

I'm telling you to groove

(Groove on)

Groove with the spirit

(On and on)

Go on and move

(Move)

With the spirit

(Spirit)

Come on and groove

(Move it)

Groove with the spirit

(Move on)



On and on

(Yeah)

Help me, help me, help me

Help me move, move, move, move

Move, move, move, move

Move, move, move, move

Move, move, move, move

Give it up, give it up

Give it up, give it up

Give it up, give it up

Give it up, give it up

(You got it, you got it)

(You got the spirit)



Spirit



Feel it



I feel it, baby

You know what I mean, baby?

Yes, I do

Oh baby. You gotta feel the motivation

I feel it, honey, I feel it



Feel the spirit

In the dark

Get ready
