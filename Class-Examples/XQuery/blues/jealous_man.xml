<lyrics>



One, two

One, two, three...



You can look at my woman, but man, you better not touch

You can look at my woman, man, you better not touch

'Cause I'm a jealous man, an' I'm crazy 'bout my baby, too much



When I go to play, I gotta lock her in a room at night

When I go to play, I have to lock her in a room at night

If ya touch that woman, you're gonna make me start a fight



Now I crazy 'bout my baby

(Crazy 'bout my baby)

Crazy 'bout my baby

(Crazy 'bout my baby)

I'm crazy 'bout my baby

(Crazy 'bout my baby)

Now I'm a jealous man

An' I'm crazy 'bout my baby too much



When I go to play, I gotta lock her in a room at night (Say
what?)

When I go to play, I have to lock her in a room at night, (Say what,
say what?)

If ya ever touch that woman, You're gonna make me start a fight



An' I'm crazy 'bout my baby

(Crazy 'bout my baby)

I'm crazy bout' my baby

(Crazy 'bout my baby)

I'm crazy 'bout my baby

(Crazy 'bout my baby)

Now I'm a jealous man

An' I'm crazy 'bout my baby too much



Crazy 'bout my baby, too much!
