<lyrics>


<l>My woman's been accusing me

</l>
<l>Of stepping out

</l>
<l>Jealous rumors have her mind filled

</l>
<l>With so much doubt

</l>
<l>And I've gotta convince her

</l>
<l>I'm not doing her wrong

</l>
<l>Before she leaves me

</l>
<l>Sad and all alone



</l>
<l>So when the clock hits five

</l>
<l>I'll be gone

</l>
<l>There's a matter

</l>
<l>That I'm gonna settle later on

</l>
<l>So if the boss man talks

</l>
<l>About overtime

</l>
<l>I'm just gonna smile

</l>
<l>and pay him no mind



</l>
<l>I've got business with my baby tonight

</l>
<l>We're gonna talk things over

</l>
<l>And make things right

</l>
<l>'Cause I couldn't sleep at all

</l>
<l>Since we had our fight

</l>
<l>I've got business with my baby tonight



</l>
<l>We'll go out to dinner

</l>
<l>At our favorite restaurant

</l>
<l>I'll hold her hand

</l>
<l>And tell her she's all I'll ever want

</l>
<l>When we get home

</l>
<l>I'll take her straight to paradise

</l>
<l>And we'll still be loving

</l>
<l>Till the morning light



</l>
<l>I've got business with my baby tonight

</l>
<l>We're gonna talk things over

</l>
<l>And make things right

</l>
<l>'Cause I couldn't sleep at all

</l>
<l>Since we had our fight

</l>
<l>I've got business with my baby tonight



</l>
<l>Now don't you start talking

</l>
<l>About gossip or news

</l>
<l>I'm warning you now

</l>
<l>I'll put on my walking shoes

</l>
<l>'Cause to me nothing in this world

</l>
<l>Is a big deal

</l>
<l>When it's compared to the way

</l>
<l>She makes me feel, all right



</l>
<l>I've got business with my baby tonight

</l>
<l>We're gonna talk things over

</l>
<l>And make things right

</l>
<l>'Cause I couldn't sleep at all

</l>
<l>Since we had our fight

</l>
<l>I've got business with my baby tonight



</l>
<l>B.B.'s got business tonight

</l>
<l>We're gotta talk things over

</l>
<l>And make things right

</l>
<l>'Cause I couldn't sleep at all

</l>
<l>Since we had our fight

</l>
<l>I've got business with my baby tonight</l></lyrics></xml>
