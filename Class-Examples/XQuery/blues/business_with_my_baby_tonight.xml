<lyrics>



My woman's been accusing me

Of stepping out

Jealous rumors have her mind filled

With so much doubt

And I've gotta convince her

I'm not doing her wrong

Before she leaves me

Sad and all alone



So when the clock hits five

I'll be gone

There's a matter

That I'm gonna settle later on

So if the boss man talks

About overtime

I'm just gonna smile

and pay him no mind



I've got business with my baby tonight

We're gonna talk things over

And make things right

'Cause I couldn't sleep at all

Since we had our fight

I've got business with my baby tonight



We'll go out to dinner

At our favorite restaurant

I'll hold her hand

And tell her she's all I'll ever want

When we get home

I'll take her straight to paradise

And we'll still be loving

Till the morning light



I've got business with my baby tonight

We're gonna talk things over

And make things right

'Cause I couldn't sleep at all

Since we had our fight

I've got business with my baby tonight



Now don't you start talking

About gossip or news

I'm warning you now

I'll put on my walking shoes

'Cause to me nothing in this world

Is a big deal

When it's compared to the way

She makes me feel, all right



I've got business with my baby tonight

We're gonna talk things over

And make things right

'Cause I couldn't sleep at all

Since we had our fight

I've got business with my baby tonight



B.B.'s got business tonight

We're gotta talk things over

And make things right

'Cause I couldn't sleep at all

Since we had our fight

I've got business with my baby tonight
