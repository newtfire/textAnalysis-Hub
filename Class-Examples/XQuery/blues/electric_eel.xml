<lyrics>



The pages of my history

Ain't no great big mystery

For the price of petty bribes

Separation of the tribes



Men with guns have leadeth us

Down their path of righteousness

A thousand trips around the sun

Hard to tell who lost and won

Who lost?



The faces in the mist I see

Ain't no great big mystery

Loss of heart, loss of mind

Lost some chrome through tests of time

Through tests of time
