<lyrics>



Woke up this morning I was all alone saw your picture by the
telephone,

I was missing you oh so bad

Wish I had you here to hold all I've got is this touch-tone
phone,

so I guess I'll give you a call



Operator help me please get thru to my baby way overseas,

time's a wastin' oh so fast

Hello baby tell me is that you I don't know what we're gonna do,

but for now I'm glad I got you on the line



Well it feels so fine knowing you're all right,

but you're miles away Lord it's not the same



Well I woke up this morning I was all alone saw your picture by the
telephone,

I've been missing you baby oh so bad

I love you baby with all my might come on home and squeeze me
tight,

long distance lovin's gonna drive me out of my mind
