<lyrics>


<l>Woke up this morning I was all alone saw your picture by the
telephone,

</l>
<l>I was missing you oh so bad

</l>
<l>Wish I had you here to hold all I've got is this touch-tone
phone,

</l>
<l>so I guess I'll give you a call



</l>
<l>Operator help me please get thru to my baby way overseas,

</l>
<l>time's a wastin' oh so fast

</l>
<l>Hello baby tell me is that you I don't know what we're gonna do,

</l>
<l>but for now I'm glad I got you on the line



</l>
<l>Well it feels so fine knowing you're all right,

</l>
<l>but you're miles away Lord it's not the same



</l>
<l>Well I woke up this morning I was all alone saw your picture by the
telephone,

</l>
<l>I've been missing you baby oh so bad

</l>
<l>I love you baby with all my might come on home and squeeze me
tight,

</l>
<l>long distance lovin's gonna drive me out of my mind</l></lyrics></xml>
