<lyrics>


<l>Don't bring no ghosts in the front, hurry 'em round to the

backdoor!




</l>
<l>This house is so haunted with dead men I can't lose

</l>
<l>This house is so haunted with dead men I can't lose

</l>
<l>And a sneaky old feeling gives me those haunted house blues



</l>
<l>I can't sleep no more, I done lost my appetite

</l>
<l>I can't sleep no more, done lost my appetite

</l>
<l>'Cause my mistreating daddy hangs around me day and night



</l>
<l>He moans when I'm sleeping, he wakes me at 2 a.m.

</l>
<l>He moans when I'm sleeping, he wakes me at 2 a.m.

</l>
<l>And he makes me swear I'll have no other man but him



</l>
<l>Now I'm so worried and I'm blue all the time

</l>
<l>Now I'm so worried and I'm blue all the time

</l>
<l>Go tell the undertaker to fix that old coffin of mine



</l>
<l>Lord, help us to get right!



</l>
<l>I'm scared to stay here, I'm scared to leave this town

</l>
<l>I'm scared to stay here, I'm scared to leave this town

</l>
<l>But a feeling just tells me to burn this house on down

</l><l>Tear this house on down</l></lyrics></xml>
