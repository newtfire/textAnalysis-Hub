<lyrics>



Don't bring no ghosts in the front, hurry 'em round to the
backdoor!



This house is so haunted with dead men I can't lose

This house is so haunted with dead men I can't lose

And a sneaky old feeling gives me those haunted house blues



I can't sleep no more, I done lost my appetite

I can't sleep no more, done lost my appetite

'Cause my mistreating daddy hangs around me day and night



He moans when I'm sleeping, he wakes me at 2 a.m.

He moans when I'm sleeping, he wakes me at 2 a.m.

And he makes me swear I'll have no other man but him



Now I'm so worried and I'm blue all the time

Now I'm so worried and I'm blue all the time

Go tell the undertaker to fix that old coffin of mine



Lord, help us to get right!



I'm scared to stay here, I'm scared to leave this town

I'm scared to stay here, I'm scared to leave this town

But a feeling just tells me to burn this house on down

Tear this house on down
