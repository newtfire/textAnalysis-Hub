<lyrics>



You pretty thing

Let me buy you a wedding ring

Let me hear the choir sing

Oh you pretty thing



You pretty thing

Let me walk you down the aisle

Darling, it's where our love is found

Oh you pretty thing



Let me kiss you gentle

Squeeze and hold you tight

Let me give all my love

The rest of my life



You pretty thing

Let me hold you by my side

And become my blushing bride

You pretty thing

Pretty thing

Let me dedicate my life

You will always be my wife

Oh you pretty thing
