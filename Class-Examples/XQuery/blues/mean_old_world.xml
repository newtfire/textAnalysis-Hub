<lyrics>


<l>This is a mean ole' world

</l>
<l>Baby, to live in all by yourself

</l>
<l>I said a mean, mean, mean ole' world

</l>
<l>To live in all by yourself

</l>
<l>When you can't get the woman you're loving

</l>
<l>Because she's loving somebody else



</l>
<l>I smile to keep from worrying

</l>
<l>And I laugh just to keep from crying

</l>
<l>Smile to keep from worrying

</l>
<l>Laugh just to keep from crying

</l>
<l>Trying to keep the public from knowing

</l>
<l>Baby, what I've got on my mind



</l>
<l>Someday, baby

</l>
<l>When the blood runs cold in my veins

</l>
<l>Someday, baby

</l>
<l>When the blood runs cold in my veins

</l>
<l>You won't be able to mistreat me no more then, baby

</l>
<l>'Cause my heart won't feel no pain</l></lyrics></xml>
