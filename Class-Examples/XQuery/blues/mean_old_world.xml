<lyrics>



This is a mean ole' world

Baby, to live in all by yourself

I said a mean, mean, mean ole' world

To live in all by yourself

When you can't get the woman you're loving

Because she's loving somebody else



I smile to keep from worrying

And I laugh just to keep from crying

Smile to keep from worrying

Laugh just to keep from crying

Trying to keep the public from knowing

Baby, what I've got on my mind



Someday, baby

When the blood runs cold in my veins

Someday, baby

When the blood runs cold in my veins

You won't be able to mistreat me no more then, baby

'Cause my heart won't feel no pain
