<lyrics>

<l>You all have been wonderin', wonderin' why I sing the blues

</l>
<l>You all have been wonderin', wonderin' why I sing the blues

</l>
<l>Yeah you just listen, and say you're me instead of you



</l>
<l>Ah you won't to or you do get married
1
, to someone for the
rest of your life

</l>
<l>Ah you won't to or you do get married
1
, to someone for the
rest of your life

</l>
<l>Yes and there is always someone else, whenever you out of sight



</l>
<l>You get the affection of a servant, the kindness of a slave

</l>
<l>You get the affection of a servant, the kindness of a slave

</l>
<l>Yeah you get the love of a dog, that can't even hear a word you
say



</l>
<l>I try to say something people, something just to pacify

</l>
<l>I try to say something people, something just to pacify

</l>
<l>I might not have lived right all of my life, but people please
believe me I've tried
