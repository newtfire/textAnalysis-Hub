<lyrics>



You all have been wonderin', wonderin' why I sing the blues

You all have been wonderin', wonderin' why I sing the blues

Yeah you just listen, and say you're me instead of you



Ah you won't to or you do get married
1
, to someone for the
rest of your life

Ah you won't to or you do get married
1
, to someone for the
rest of your life

Yes and there is always someone else, whenever you out of sight



You get the affection of a servant, the kindness of a slave

You get the affection of a servant, the kindness of a slave

Yeah you get the love of a dog, that can't even hear a word you
say



I try to say something people, something just to pacify

I try to say something people, something just to pacify

I might not have lived right all of my life, but people please
believe me I've tried



__________

Note 1: I'm not certain of the line "Ah you won't to or you do get
married"
