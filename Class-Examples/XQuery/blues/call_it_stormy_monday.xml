<lyrics>



They called it stormy Monday, but Tuesday is as just as bad

Oh they called it, they called it stormy Monday, but Tuesday, Tuesday
is as just as bad

Oh, Wednesday is worst, and Thursday, oh so sad



The eagle flies on Friday, now Saturday I'll go out to play

Oh the eagle, the eagle flies on Friday Saturday I'll go out and
play

Sunday I'll go to church, and I fall on my knees and pray



I say, Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy on me

But Lord, Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy on me

You know I'm crazy 'bout my baby Lord, please send my baby back on to
me



Help me out here man, help me out



Sun rise in the east, it set up in the west

Yes, the sun rise in the east baby, and it set up in the west

It's hard to tell, it's hard to tell, it's hard to tell, which one,
which one, which one a little bad



Yeah! Go ahead, do it one more time



Oh the eagle flies on Friday, Saturday I'll go out to play

Oh the eagle flies on Friday, you know Saturday I'll go out to
play

Sunday I'll go out to the signify church

Oh when I'll fall down on my knees and pray



I say, Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy on me

Lord, Lord, Lord have mercy on me

Please, have mercy on me

You know I'm crazy, crazy 'bout my baby

Please, send her back, send her back on to me



Yeah!
