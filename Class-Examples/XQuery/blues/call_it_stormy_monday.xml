<l>They called it stormy Monday, but Tuesday is as just as bad

</l>
<l>Oh they called it, they called it stormy Monday, but Tuesday, Tuesday
is as just as bad

</l>
<l>Oh, Wednesday is worst, and Thursday, oh so sad



</l>
<l>The eagle flies on Friday, now Saturday I'll go out to play

</l>
<l>Oh the eagle, the eagle flies on Friday Saturday I'll go out and
play

</l>
<l>Sunday I'll go to church, and I fall on my knees and pray



</l>
<l>I say, Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy on me

</l>
<l>But Lord, Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy on me

</l>
<l>You know I'm crazy 'bout my baby Lord, please send my baby back on to

me




</l>
<l>Help me out here man, help me out



</l>
<l>Sun rise in the east, it set up in the west

</l>
<l>Yes, the sun rise in the east baby, and it set up in the west

</l>
<l>It's hard to tell, it's hard to tell, it's hard to tell, which one,

which one, which one a little bad




</l>
<l>Yeah! Go ahead, do it one more time



</l>
<l>Oh the eagle flies on Friday, Saturday I'll go out to play

</l>
<l>Oh the eagle flies on Friday, you know Saturday I'll go out to
play

</l>
<l>Sunday I'll go out to the signify church

</l>
<l>Oh when I'll fall down on my knees and pray



</l>
<l>I say, Lord have mercy, Lord have mercy on me

</l>
<l>Lord, Lord, Lord have mercy on me

</l>
<l>Please, have mercy on me

</l>
<l>You know I'm crazy, crazy 'bout my baby

</l>
<l>Please, send her back, send her back on to me



</l>
<l>Yeah!</l></lyrics></xml>
