(Spoken:

I wonder where, I wonder where, this Sears Roebuck drummer come
from?

(laughter))



Hey baby, can't you see what you're doin' to me

Hey baby, baby, baby, can't you see what you're doin' to me

Well you say you're gonna leave me, darlin'

You're goin' back to your old time, used to be



I work two jobs, I bring home all-a the pay

If you tell me you love me, then try to do some things my way

Hey baby, can't you see what you're doin' to me

Well you say you're gonna leave me,

You're goin' back to your old time, used to be



Hey now! woo! yeah! yeah! come on band! sounds alright!



I work two jobs, I bring ya all-a the pay

If you tell me you love me, then try to do some things my way

Hey baby, can't you see what you're doin' to me

Yeah, you say you're gonna leave me darlin'

You're goin' back to your old time, used to be



Hey baby, can't you see what you're doin' to me

Hey, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby

Can't you see what you're doin' to me

Now you say you're gonna leave me darlin'

You're goin' back to your old time, used to be
