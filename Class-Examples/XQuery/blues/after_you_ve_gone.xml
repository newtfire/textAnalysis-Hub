<lyrics>


<l>Now won't you listen dearie while I say,

</l>
<l>how could you tell me that you're goin' away?

</l>
<l>Don't say that we must part, don't break my aching heart

</l>
<l>You know I've loved you truly many years, loved you night and day

</l>
<l>How can you leave me, can't you see my tears?

</l>
<l>Listen while I say



</l>
<l>After you've gone, and left me crying

</l>
<l>After you've gone, there's no denying

</l>
<l>You'll feel blue, you'll feel sad

</l>
<l>You'll miss the dearest pal you've ever had

</l>
<l>There'll come a time, now don't forget it

</l>
<l>There'll come a time, when you'll regret it

</l>
<l>Some day, when you grow lonely

</l>
<l>You heart will break like mine and you'll want me only

</l>
<l>After you've gone, after you've gone away



</l>
<l>After I'm gone, after we break up

</l>
<l>After I'm gone, you're gonna wake up

</l>
<l>You will find, you were blind

</l>
<l>To let somebody come and change your mind

</l>
<l>After the years, we've been together

</l>
<l>Their joy and tears all kinds of weather

</l>
<l>Someday, blue and downhearted

</l>
<l>You'll long to be with me right back where you started

</l>
<l>After I'm gone, after I'm gone away</l></lyrics></xml>
