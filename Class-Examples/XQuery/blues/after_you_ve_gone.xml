<lyrics>



Now won't you listen dearie while I say,

how could you tell me that you're goin' away?

Don't say that we must part, don't break my aching heart

You know I've loved you truly many years, loved you night and day

How can you leave me, can't you see my tears?

Listen while I say



After you've gone, and left me crying

After you've gone, there's no denying

You'll feel blue, you'll feel sad

You'll miss the dearest pal you've ever had

There'll come a time, now don't forget it

There'll come a time, when you'll regret it

Some day, when you grow lonely

You heart will break like mine and you'll want me only

After you've gone, after you've gone away



After I'm gone, after we break up

After I'm gone, you're gonna wake up

You will find, you were blind

To let somebody come and change your mind

After the years, we've been together

Their joy and tears all kinds of weather

Someday, blue and downhearted

You'll long to be with me right back where you started

After I'm gone, after I'm gone away
