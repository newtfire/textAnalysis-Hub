<lyrics>



I just don't know, what's this all about?

What is it all about, boys?

I just don't know, what's this all, all about?

The woman I love, is tryin' to put me out



She said she didn't want me, why should I hang around?

Hey, why should I hang around?

And that if I hang around, I would be jail house bound



I love that woman, more than she will ever know

Yes, I love her

Hey baby, more than you will ever know

But if you drive me away, I won't be back no more



I just stole that woman, stole her from my best friend

Yeah- hee, from my best friend

But that old fool's so darn lucky,

He's 'bout to get her back again
