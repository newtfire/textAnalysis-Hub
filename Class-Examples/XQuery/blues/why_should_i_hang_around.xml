<lyrics>


<l>I just don't know, what's this all about?

</l>
<l>What is it all about, boys?

</l>
<l>I just don't know, what's this all, all about?

</l>
<l>The woman I love, is tryin' to put me out



</l>
<l>She said she didn't want me, why should I hang around?

</l>
<l>Hey, why should I hang around?

</l>
<l>And that if I hang around, I would be jail house bound



</l>
<l>I love that woman, more than she will ever know

</l>
<l>Yes, I love her

</l>
<l>Hey baby, more than you will ever know

</l>
<l>But if you drive me away, I won't be back no more



</l>
<l>I just stole that woman, stole her from my best friend

</l>
<l>Yeah- hee, from my best friend

</l>
<l>But that old fool's so darn lucky,

</l>
<l>He's 'bout to get her back again</l></lyrics></xml>
