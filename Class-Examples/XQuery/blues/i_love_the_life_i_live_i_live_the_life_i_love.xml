<lyrics>



See you watching me like a hawk

I don't mind the way you talk

But if you touch me somethin's got to give

I life the life I love and I love the life I live



So if you see me and think I'm wrong

Don't worry 'bout me just let me go

My sweet life ain't nothing but a thrill

I life the life I love and I love the life I live



My diamond ring and my money too

Tomorrow night could belong to you

The girls move me at their will

I life the life I love and I love the life I live



I may bet a thousand on a bet this time

One minute later I can't cover your dime

Tomorrow night I might be over the hill

I just want you to know baby the way I feel



You see me walkin' as I pass you by

Don't talk about me 'cause I could be high

Just forgive me if you will

I life the life I love and I love the life I live
