<lyrics>


<l>See you watching me like a hawk

</l>
<l>I don't mind the way you talk

</l>
<l>But if you touch me somethin's got to give

</l>
<l>I life the life I love and I love the life I live



</l>
<l>So if you see me and think I'm wrong

</l>
<l>Don't worry 'bout me just let me go

</l>
<l>My sweet life ain't nothing but a thrill

</l>
<l>I life the life I love and I love the life I live



</l>
<l>My diamond ring and my money too

</l>
<l>Tomorrow night could belong to you

</l>
<l>The girls move me at their will

</l>
<l>I life the life I love and I love the life I live



</l>
<l>I may bet a thousand on a bet this time

</l>
<l>One minute later I can't cover your dime

</l>
<l>Tomorrow night I might be over the hill

</l>
<l>I just want you to know baby the way I feel



</l>
<l>You see me walkin' as I pass you by

</l>
<l>Don't talk about me 'cause I could be high

</l>
<l>Just forgive me if you will

</l>
<l>I life the life I love and I love the life I live</l></lyrics></xml>
