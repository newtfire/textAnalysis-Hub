<l>Merry Christmas baby

</l>
<l>Babe you sure did treat me nice

</l>
<l>Yeah! Merry Merry Merry Christmas baby

</l>
<l>Babe you sure did treat me nice

</l>
<l>Gave me a diamond ring for Christmas

</l>
<l>And now I'm living in paradise



</l>
<l>Oh! I'm feeling mighty fine this morning

</l>
<l>I've got good music on my radio

</l>
<l>Hey baby, I'm feeling mighty fine

</l>
<l>I've got good music on my radio

</l>
<l>I would love to hug and kiss you baby

</l>
<l>While you're standing beneath the mistletoe



</l>
<l>Santa came down the chimney

</l>
<l>About half past three

</l>
<l>He got all of these presents that you'll use

</l>
<l>See, I'll help you put on these



</l>
<l>Merry Merry Merry Christmas baby

</l>
<l>Oh! You sure been good to me

</l>
<l>But I'm all lit up like a Christmas tree



</l>

</l>

</l>
<l>I said, Merry Merry Merry Christmas baby

</l>
<l>I've got good music on my radio

</l>
<l>I would love to hug and kiss you baby

</l>
<l>While you're standing beneath the mistletoe</l></lyrics></xml>
