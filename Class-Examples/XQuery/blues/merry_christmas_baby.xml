Merry Christmas baby

Babe you sure did treat me nice

Yeah! Merry Merry Merry Christmas baby

Babe you sure did treat me nice

Gave me a diamond ring for Christmas

And now I'm living in paradise



Oh! I'm feeling mighty fine this morning

I've got good music on my radio

Hey baby, I'm feeling mighty fine

I've got good music on my radio

I would love to hug and kiss you baby

While you're standing beneath the mistletoe



Santa came down the chimney

About half past three

He got all of these presents that you'll use

See, I'll help you put on these



Merry Merry Merry Christmas baby

Oh! You sure been good to me

I haven't had a drink this evenin' baby

But I'm all lit up like a Christmas tree



Hey! Merry Merry Merry Christmas baby

I've got good music on my radio

I said, Merry Merry Merry Christmas baby

I've got good music on my radio

I would love to hug and kiss you baby

While you're standing beneath the mistletoe
