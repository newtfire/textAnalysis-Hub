<lyrics>


<l>Hey, everybody, let's have some fun

</l>
<l>You only live but once

</l>
<l>And when you're dead you're done, so



</l>
<l>Let the good times roll, let the good times roll

</l>
<l>I don't care if you're young or old

</l>
<l>Get together, let the good times roll



</l>
<l>Don't sit there mumblin', talkin' trash

</l>
<l>If you wanna have a ball

</l>
<l>You gotta go out and spend some cash, and

</l>
<l>Let the good times roll, let the good times roll

</l>
<l>I don't care if you're young or old

</l>
<l>Get together, let the good times roll



</l>
<l>Hey Mr. Landlord, lock up all the doors

</l>
<l>When the police comes around

</l>
<l>Just tell 'em that the joint is closed

</l>
<l>Let the good times roll, let the good times roll

</l>
<l>I don't care if you're young or old

</l>
<l>Get together, let the good times roll



</l>
<l>Hey tell everybody

</l>
<l>Mr. King's in town

</l>
<l>I got a dollar and a quarter

</l>
<l>Just rarin' to clown

</l>
<l>But don't let nobody play me cheap

</l>
<l>I got fifty cents more that I'm gonna keep, so



</l>
<l>Let the good times roll, let the good times roll

</l>
<l>I don't care if you're young or old

</l>
<l>Get together, let the good times roll



</l>
<l>No matter whether rainy weather

</l>
<l>Birds of a feather gotta stick together

</l>
<l>So get yourself under control

</l>
<l>Go out and get together and let the good times roll</l></lyrics></xml>
