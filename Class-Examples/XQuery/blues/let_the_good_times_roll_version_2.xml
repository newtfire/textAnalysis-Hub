<lyrics>



Hey, everybody, let's have some fun

You only live but once

And when you're dead you're done, so



Let the good times roll, let the good times roll

I don't care if you're young or old

Get together, let the good times roll



Don't sit there mumblin', talkin' trash

If you wanna have a ball

You gotta go out and spend some cash, and

Let the good times roll, let the good times roll

I don't care if you're young or old

Get together, let the good times roll



Hey Mr. Landlord, lock up all the doors

When the police comes around

Just tell 'em that the joint is closed

Let the good times roll, let the good times roll

I don't care if you're young or old

Get together, let the good times roll



Hey tell everybody

Mr. King's in town

I got a dollar and a quarter

Just rarin' to clown

But don't let nobody play me cheap

I got fifty cents more that I'm gonna keep, so



Let the good times roll, let the good times roll

I don't care if you're young or old

Get together, let the good times roll



No matter whether rainy weather

Birds of a feather gotta stick together

So get yourself under control

Go out and get together and let the good times roll
