<lyrics>



I feel bad, always sad

Trouble, trouble's driving me mad

Good old days of long ago

All have gone to come no more

That is why you always hear me hum



Mmmmmmm

Mmmmmmm

How my heart ache, soon it will break

I'm almost through, what can I do

Just to cure these awful moanin' blues



I've got no friend, I can't trust men

Everything's in soak and always broke

There's no place where I can get a loan

Even no place I can call my home

That is why you always hear me moan



Mmmmmmm

Mmmmmmm

How my heart ache, soon it will break

I'm almost through, what will I do, Lord

Just to cure these awful moanin' blues
