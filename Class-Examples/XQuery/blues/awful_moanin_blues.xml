<lyrics>


<l>I feel bad, always sad

</l>
<l>Trouble, trouble's driving me mad

</l>
<l>Good old days of long ago

</l>
<l>All have gone to come no more

</l>
<l>That is why you always hear me hum



</l>
<l>Mmmmmmm

</l>
<l>Mmmmmmm

</l>
<l>How my heart ache, soon it will break

</l>
<l>I'm almost through, what can I do

</l>
<l>Just to cure these awful moanin' blues



</l>
<l>I've got no friend, I can't trust men

</l>
<l>Everything's in soak and always broke

</l>
<l>There's no place where I can get a loan

</l>
<l>Even no place I can call my home

</l>
<l>That is why you always hear me moan



</l>
<l>Mmmmmmm

</l>
<l>Mmmmmmm

</l>
<l>How my heart ache, soon it will break

</l>
<l>I'm almost through, what will I do, Lord

</l>
<l>Just to cure these awful moanin' blues</l></lyrics></xml>
