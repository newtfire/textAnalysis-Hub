<lyrics>


<l>I'm goin' over the hill

</l>
<l>I'm goin' on over the hill

</l>
<l>I'm goin' over the hill

</l>
<l>Yeah, as soon as I can make me a few round



</l>
<l>Finally master see me, just a few more ups and down

</l>
<l>I'm goin' on over the hill

</l>
<l>I'm goin' over the hill,

</l>
<l>I'm goin' over the hill,

</l>
<l>I'm goin' over the hill,


</l>
<l>Oh well, I went in the valley, I didn't go to stay

</l>
<l>Soon God had me child,

</l>
<l>I stay down there all day

</l>
<l>I went on over the hill



</l>
<l>When I get to heaven, gon' sit right down

</l>
<l>Askin' master, just to get my starry down</l></lyrics></xml>
