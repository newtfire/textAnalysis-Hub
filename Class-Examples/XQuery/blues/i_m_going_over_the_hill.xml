<lyrics>



I'm goin' over the hill

I'm goin' on over the hill

I'm goin' over the hill

Yeah, as soon as I can make me a few round



Finally master see me, just a few more ups and down

I'm goin' on over the hill

I'm goin' over the hill,

I'm goin' over the hill,

I'm goin' over the hill,


Oh well, I went in the valley, I didn't go to stay

Soon God had me child,

I stay down there all day

I went on over the hill



When I get to heaven, gon' sit right down

Askin' master, just to get my starry down
