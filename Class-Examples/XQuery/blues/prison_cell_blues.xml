<lyrics>



Getting tired of sleeping in this lowdown lonesome cell

Lord, I wouldn't have been here if it had not been for Nell



Lay awake at night and just can't eat a bite

Used to be my 
rider
 but
she just won't treat me right



Got a red-eyed captain and a squabbling boss

Got a mad dog sergeant, honey, and he won't knock off



I'm getting tired of sleeping in this lowdown lonesome cell

Lord, I wouldn't 've been here if it had not been for Nell



I asked the government to knock some days off my time

Well, the way I'm treated, I'm about to lose my mind



I wrote to the governor, please turn me a-loose

Since I don't get no answer, I know it ain't no use



I'm getting tired of sleeping in this lowdown lonesome cell

Lord, I wouldn't have been here if it had not been for Nell



I hate to turn over and find my rider gone

Walking across my floor, Lordy, how I moan



Lord, I wouldn't have been here if it had not been for Nell

I'm getting tired of sleeping in this lowdown lonesome cell
