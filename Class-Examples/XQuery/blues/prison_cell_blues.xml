<lyrics>


<l>Getting tired of sleeping in this lowdown lonesome cell

</l>
<l>Lord, I wouldn't have been here if it had not been for Nell



</l>
<l>Lay awake at night and just can't eat a bite

</l>
<l>Used to be my 
rider
but </l>
<l>she just won't treat me right



</l>
<l>Got a red-eyed captain and a squabbling boss

</l>
<l>Got a mad dog sergeant, honey, and he won't knock off



</l>
<l>I'm getting tired of sleeping in this lowdown lonesome cell

</l>
<l>Lord, I wouldn't 've been here if it had not been for Nell



</l>
<l>I asked the government to knock some days off my time

</l>
<l>Well, the way I'm treated, I'm about to lose my mind



</l>
<l>I wrote to the governor, please turn me a-loose

</l>
<l>Since I don't get no answer, I know it ain't no use



</l>
<l>I'm getting tired of sleeping in this lowdown lonesome cell

</l>
<l>Lord, I wouldn't have been here if it had not been for Nell



</l>
<l>I hate to turn over and find my rider gone

</l>
<l>Walking across my floor, Lordy, how I moan



</l>
<l>Lord, I wouldn't have been here if it had not been for Nell

</l>
<l>I'm getting tired of sleeping in this lowdown lonesome cell



</l>
