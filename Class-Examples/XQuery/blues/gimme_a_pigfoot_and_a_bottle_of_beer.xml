<l>(spoken:

</l>
<l>Twenty-five cents?

</l>
<l>Ha! No! No!

</l>
<l>I wouldn't pay twenty-five cents to go in nowhere 'cause listen

here)




</l>
<l>Up in Harlem ev'ry Saturday night when the high-browns git together
it's just too tight,

</l>
<l>they all congregates at an all night 
strut

</l>
<l>and what they do is tut-tut-tut

</l>
<l>Old Hannah Brown from 'cross town gets full of corn and starts
breakin' 'em down

</l>
<l>Just at the break of day you can hear old Hannah say,

</l>
<l>"Gimme a pigfoot and a bottle of beer"

</l>
<l>Send me gate



</l>
<l>I don't care

</l>
<l>I feel just like I wanna clown

</l>
<l>Give the piano player a drink because he's bringin' me down

</l>
<l>He's got rhythm, yeah!

</l>
<l>When he stomps his feet, he sends me right off to sleep

</l>
<l>Check all your razors and your guns

</l>
<l>We gonna be rasslin' when the wagon comes

</l>
<l>I wanna pigfoot and a bottle of beer

</l>
<l>Send me 'cause I don't care

</l>
<l>Slay me 'cause I don't care



</l>
<l>Gimme a reefer and a gang o' gin

</l>
<l>Slay me, 'cause I'm in my sin

</l>
<l>Slay me 'cause I'm full of gin



</l>
<l>Check all your razors and your guns

</l>
<l>Do the 
shim-sham shimmy

</l><l>till the risin' sun</l></lyrics></xml>
