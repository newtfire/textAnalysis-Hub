(spoken:

Twenty-five cents?

Ha! No! No!

I wouldn't pay twenty-five cents to go in nowhere 'cause listen
here)



Up in Harlem ev'ry Saturday night when the high-browns git together
it's just too tight,

they all congregates at an all night 
strut

and what they do is tut-tut-tut

Old Hannah Brown from 'cross town gets full of corn and starts
breakin' 'em down

Just at the break of day you can hear old Hannah say,

"Gimme a pigfoot and a bottle of beer"

Send me gate



I don't care

I feel just like I wanna clown

Give the piano player a drink because he's bringin' me down

He's got rhythm, yeah!

When he stomps his feet, he sends me right off to sleep

Check all your razors and your guns

We gonna be rasslin' when the wagon comes

I wanna pigfoot and a bottle of beer

Send me 'cause I don't care

Slay me 'cause I don't care



Gimme a reefer and a gang o' gin

Slay me, 'cause I'm in my sin

Slay me 'cause I'm full of gin



Check all your razors and your guns

Do the 
shim-sham shimmy

till the risin' sun
