<lyrics>



Well, I thought I heard that Pea Vine
1
 when she
blow

Well, I thought I heard that Pea Vine when she blow

You know it blow just like it ain't gonna blow no more



I, hmm

I, I, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm

Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm

Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm



I'm gonna catch my pony boys, saddle up my black mare

I'm gonna catch my little pony boys, gonna saddle up my black
mare

I'm gonna find my baby, she's in the world somewhere



I ain't got no money boys, I can't ride the train

I ain't got no money boys, I can't ride that train

But I thought I heard this mornin', that Pea Vine when she blow



Carryin' my baby 'way

Carryin' my baby 'way

You know it blow just like, ain't gonna bring my baby back no
more



I'm gonna catch my pony boys,

gonna saddle up my black mare

I'm gonna leave ya joggin',

joggin' on away from here
