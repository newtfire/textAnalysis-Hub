<l>I'm the winin' boy, don't you deny my name

</l>
<l>I'm the winin' boy, don't you deny my name

</l>
<l>Now my name



</l>
<l>Well, I'm the winin' boy, don't you deny my name

</l>
<l>I pick it up and shake it like sweet Stavin' Chain

</l>
<l>Mm, the winin' boy, don't deny now my name



</l>
<l>Now mama mama, mama look at Sis

</l>
<l>Oh, mama mama, take a look at little Sis

</l>
<l>Look at Sis



</l>
<l>Well now mama mama, mama take a look at Sis

</l>
<l>Lord, she's out on the levee doin' the Double Twist

</l>
<l>Mm, the winin' boy, don't you deny now my name



</l>
<l>I'm the winin' boy, now don't you deny my name

</l>
<l>I'm the winin' boy, don't you deny my name

</l>
<l>Now my name



</l>
<l>Lord, I'm the winin' boy, don't you deny my name

</l>
<l>I'll pick it up and shake it, Lord, like sweet Stavin' Chain

</l>
<l>Mm, the winin' boy, don't you deny now my name</l></lyrics></xml>
