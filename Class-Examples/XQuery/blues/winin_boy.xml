<lyrics>



I'm the winin' boy, don't you deny my name

I'm the winin' boy, don't you deny my name

Now my name



Well, I'm the winin' boy, don't you deny my name

I pick it up and shake it like sweet Stavin' Chain

Mm, the winin' boy, don't deny now my name



Now mama mama, mama look at Sis

Oh, mama mama, take a look at little Sis

Look at Sis



Well now mama mama, mama take a look at Sis

Lord, she's out on the levee doin' the Double Twist

Mm, the winin' boy, don't you deny now my name



I'm the winin' boy, now don't you deny my name

I'm the winin' boy, don't you deny my name

Now my name



Lord, I'm the winin' boy, don't you deny my name

I'll pick it up and shake it, Lord, like sweet Stavin' Chain

Mm, the winin' boy, don't you deny now my name
