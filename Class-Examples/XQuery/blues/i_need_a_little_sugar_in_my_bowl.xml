<lyrics>


<l>Tired of bein' lonely, tired of bein' blue,

</l>
<l>I wished I had some good man, to tell my troubles to

</l>
<l>Seem like the whole world's wrong, since my man's been gone



</l>
<l>I need a little sugar in my bowl,

</l>
<l>I need a little hot dog, on my roll

</l>
<l>I can stand a bit of lovin', oh so bad,

</l>
<l>I feel so funny, I feel so sad

</l>
<l>I need a little steam-heat, on my floor,

</l>
<l>Maybe I can fix things up, so they'll go

</l>
<l>What's the matter, hard papa, come on and save you mama's soul

</l>
<l>'Cause I need a little sugar, in my bowl, doggone it,

</l>
<l>I need a little sugar in my bowl



</l>
<l>I need a little sugar, in my bowl,

</l>
<l>I need a little hot dog, between my rolls

</l>
<l>You gettin' different, I've been told,

</l>
<l>move your finger, drop something in my bowl

</l>
<l>I need a little steam-heat on my floor,

</l>
<l>Maybe I can fix things up, so they'll go



</l>
<l>(spoken: Get off your knees, I can't see what you're drivin' at!

</l>
<l>It's dark down there!

</l>
<l>Looks like a snake! C'mon here and drop somethin' here in my
bowl,

</l>
<l>stop your foolin', and drop somethin', in my bowl)</l></lyrics></xml>
