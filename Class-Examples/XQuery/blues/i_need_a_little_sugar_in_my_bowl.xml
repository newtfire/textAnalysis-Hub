<lyrics>



Tired of bein' lonely, tired of bein' blue,

I wished I had some good man, to tell my troubles to

Seem like the whole world's wrong, since my man's been gone



I need a little sugar in my bowl,

I need a little hot dog, on my roll

I can stand a bit of lovin', oh so bad,

I feel so funny, I feel so sad

I need a little steam-heat, on my floor,

Maybe I can fix things up, so they'll go

What's the matter, hard papa, come on and save you mama's soul

'Cause I need a little sugar, in my bowl, doggone it,

I need a little sugar in my bowl



I need a little sugar, in my bowl,

I need a little hot dog, between my rolls

You gettin' different, I've been told,

move your finger, drop something in my bowl

I need a little steam-heat on my floor,

Maybe I can fix things up, so they'll go



(spoken: Get off your knees, I can't see what you're drivin' at!

It's dark down there!

Looks like a snake! C'mon here and drop somethin' here in my
bowl,

stop your foolin', and drop somethin', in my bowl)
