<l>I can't stop lovin', my baby tonight

</l>
<l>I can't stop lovin', my baby tonight

</l>
<l>No matter what I do, she won't treat me right



</l>
<l>Hey baby, you know I'm all alone

</l>
<l>Hey baby, you know I'm all alone

</l>
<l>Ain't had no lovin', since you been gone from home



</l>
<l>I love you pretty Baby, but as for myself

</l>
<l>I love you baby, but as for myself

</l>
<l>I wouldn't mistreat you, for nobody else



</l>
<l>And I can't stop lovin', my baby tonight

</l>
<l>And I can't stop lovin', my baby tonight

</l>
<l>No matter what I do, she won't treat me right



</l>
<l>I can't stop-a lovin', my baby tonight

</l>
<l>I can't stop-a lovin', my baby tonight

</l><l>No matter what I do, she won't treat me right</l></lyrics></xml>
