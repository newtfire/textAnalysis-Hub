<lyrics>



I can't stop lovin', my baby tonight

I can't stop lovin', my baby tonight

No matter what I do, she won't treat me right



Hey baby, you know I'm all alone

Hey baby, you know I'm all alone

Ain't had no lovin', since you been gone from home



I love you pretty Baby, but as for myself

I love you baby, but as for myself

I wouldn't mistreat you, for nobody else



And I can't stop lovin', my baby tonight

And I can't stop lovin', my baby tonight

No matter what I do, she won't treat me right



I can't stop-a lovin', my baby tonight

I can't stop-a lovin', my baby tonight

No matter what I do, she won't treat me right
