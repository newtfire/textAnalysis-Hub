<lyrics>


<l>Once was a sweet thing baby, held out her lovin' in our
hands

</l>
<l>Now I reach to kiss your lips, the touch don't mean a thing

</l>
<l>And that's a cold shot baby, yeah, that's a drag

</l>
<l>A cold shot baby, I let our love go bad



</l>
<l>Remember the way that you loved me, do anything I said

</l>
<l>Now I see you out somewhere, you won't give me the time of day

</l>
<l>And that's a cold shot darlin', yeah that's a drag

</l>
<l>And that's a cold shot baby, we let our love go bad



</l>
<l>I really meant I was sorry, for ever causin' you pain

</l>
<l>You showed your appreciation, by walkin' out anyway

</l>
<l>And that's a cold shot baby, yeah that's a drag

</l>
<l>And that's a cold shot baby, we let our love go bad



</l>
<l>So sad, too bad, so sad

</l>
<l>Don't let our true love run cold baby
