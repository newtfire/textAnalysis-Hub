<lyrics>



Once was a sweet thing baby, held out her lovin' in our
hands

Now I reach to kiss your lips, the touch don't mean a thing

And that's a cold shot baby, yeah, that's a drag

A cold shot baby, I let our love go bad



Remember the way that you loved me, do anything I said

Now I see you out somewhere, you won't give me the time of day

And that's a cold shot darlin', yeah that's a drag

And that's a cold shot baby, we let our love go bad



I really meant I was sorry, for ever causin' you pain

You showed your appreciation, by walkin' out anyway

And that's a cold shot baby, yeah that's a drag

And that's a cold shot baby, we let our love go bad



So sad, too bad, so sad

Don't let our true love run cold baby
