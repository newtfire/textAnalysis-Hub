<l>Everyday, everyday I have the blues

</l>
<l>Everyday, everyday I have the blues

</l>
<l>When you see me worried baby, because it's you I hate to lose



</l>
<l>Oh nobody loves me, nobody seems to care

</l>
<l>Yes nobody loves me, nobody seems to care

</l>
<l>Speaking of bad luck and trouble, well you know I had my share



</l>
<l>I'm gonna pack my suitcase, move on 
down
the line

</l>
<l>Yes I'm gonna pack my suitcase, move on down the line

</l>
<l>Where there ain't nobody worried, and there ain't nobody crying</l></lyrics></xml>
