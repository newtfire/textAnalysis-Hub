<lyrics>



Everyday, everyday I have the blues

Everyday, everyday I have the blues

When you see me worried baby, because it's you I hate to lose



Oh nobody loves me, nobody seems to care

Yes nobody loves me, nobody seems to care

Speaking of bad luck and trouble, well you know I had my share



I'm gonna pack my suitcase, move on 
down
the line

Yes I'm gonna pack my suitcase, move on down the line

Where there ain't nobody worried, and there ain't nobody crying
