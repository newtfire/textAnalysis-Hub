<lyrics>


<l>I remember way back, in nineteen and twenty-nine

</l>
<l>I had plenty woman then money

</l>
<l>But I very much short in mind



</l>
<l>But if I could just go back

</l>
<l>And start my life brand new

</l>
<l>Well, well, I would control myself more better

</l>
<l>Woo, well, well, I would know just what to do



</l>
<l>Used to spend a hundred dollars, just to have a big name

</l>
<l>I used to spend a hundred dollars, just to have a big name

</l>
<l>Well, well, if my woman asked me for ten dollars

</l>
<l>Woo, well, well, I'd give her twenty, and say, "Keep the change"



</l>
<l>Now people used to be so nice to me

</l>
<l>I often wondered why

</l>
<l>But now it's just, "Hello Slim"

</l>
<l>As they keep walkin' by



</l>
<l>But If I could just go back

</l>
<l>And start my life brand new

</l>
<l>Well, well, I would control myself more better

</l>
<l>Woo, well, well, because I know just what to do



</l>
<l>Yes, yes, yes, yes



</l>
<l>In those days I had plenty, to loan or either give

</l>
<l>Now in those days I had plenty, to loan or either give

</l>
<l>Well, well, but now things are a lot different,

</l>
<l>woo, well, well, from the life that I used to live</l></lyrics></xml>
