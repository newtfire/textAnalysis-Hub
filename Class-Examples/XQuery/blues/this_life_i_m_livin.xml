<lyrics>



I remember way back, in nineteen and twenty-nine

I had plenty woman then money

But I very much short in mind



But if I could just go back

And start my life brand new

Well, well, I would control myself more better

Woo, well, well, I would know just what to do



Used to spend a hundred dollars, just to have a big name

I used to spend a hundred dollars, just to have a big name

Well, well, if my woman asked me for ten dollars

Woo, well, well, I'd give her twenty, and say, "Keep the change"



Now people used to be so nice to me

I often wondered why

But now it's just, "Hello Slim"

As they keep walkin' by



But If I could just go back

And start my life brand new

Well, well, I would control myself more better

Woo, well, well, because I know just what to do



Yes, yes, yes, yes



In those days I had plenty, to loan or either give

Now in those days I had plenty, to loan or either give

Well, well, but now things are a lot different,

woo, well, well, from the life that I used to live
