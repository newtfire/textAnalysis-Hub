<l>Mustang Sally, guess you better slow your mustang down

</l>
<l>Mustang Sally, now baby, guess you better slow your mustang down

</l>
<l>Ridin' all over town, woo, guess I'm gonna have to put your flat feet

on the ground




</l>
<l>Mustang Sally, you better slow that mustang down

</l>
<l>Mustang Sally, now baby, ya better slow you Mustang down

</l>
<l>Runnin' all over town, woo, guess I'm gonna have to put your flat

feet on the ground




</l>
<l>All ya wanna do is ride around, Sally

</l>
<l>All ya wanna do is ride around, Sally

</l>
<l>All ya wanna do is ride around, Sally

</l>
<l>Ooh, all ya wanna do is ride around, Sally

</l>
<l>(One of these days)

</l>
<l>Gonna have to wipe your weepin' eyes



</l>
<l>All ya wanna do is ride around, Sally

</l>
<l>All ya wanna do is ride around, Sally

</l>
<l>All ya wanna do is ride around, Sally

</l>
<l>All ya wanna do is ride around, Sally

</l>
<l>(One of these days)

</l>
<l>Gonna be wipin' your weepin' eyes</l></lyrics></xml>
