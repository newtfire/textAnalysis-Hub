<l>Well now tell me darlin' may I have a talk with you

</l>
<l>Wo, tell me darlin' may I have a talk with you,

</l>
<l>because it won't be long before our true love will be through

</l>
<l>Wo, tell me darlin' am I right or am I wrong

</l>
<l>I said tell me darlin' am I right or am I wrong

</l>
<l>I'm determined to know little girl you comin' home

</l>
<l>Come on home baby



</l>
<l>Now now listen to me baby while I hold your hand,

</l>
<l>don't want anything from you but be your lovin' man

</l>
<l>Now tell me darlin' may I have a talk with you,

</l>
<l>because the words I have to tell you they will linger through the
years

</l>
<l>I love you honey</l></lyrics></xml>
