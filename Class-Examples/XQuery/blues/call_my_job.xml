<lyrics>



Call my job, tell the boss I won't be in

Call my job, tell the boss I won't be in

Friday, Saturday, Sunday, I must've had too much weekend



Call my job, have someone operate my machine

Call my job, have someone operate my machine

You look so good to me this morning, I must've had too much
weekend



Hang the hat off the hook, lock the door too, spend my time, making
love to you

Call my job, tell the boss I won't be in Friday, Saturday,
Sunday,

I must've had too much weekend
