<lyrics>


<l>Did you ever sit thinking with a thousand things on your
mind?

</l>
<l>Did you ever sit thinking with a thousand things on your mind?

</l>
<l>Thinking about someone who has treated you so nice and kind



</l>
<l>You'll get an old letter and you begin to read

</l>
<l>You'll get an old letter and you begin to read

</l>
<l>Got the blues so bad tell that man of mine I wanna be



</l>
<l>Don't you hear me baby, knocking on your door?

</l>
<l>Don't you hear me baby, knocking on your door?

</l>
<l>Have you got the nerve to drive me from your door?



</l>
<l>Have you got the nerve to say that you don't want me no more?

</l>
<l>Have you got the nerve to say that you don't want me no more?

</l>
<l>The good book said you got to reap what you sow



</l>
<l>Take me back baby, try me one more time

</l>
<l>Take me back baby, try me one more time

</l><l>That's the only way I can get these thinking blues off my mind</l></lyrics></xml>
