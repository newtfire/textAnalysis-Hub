<lyrics>



Did you ever sit thinking with a thousand things on your
mind?

Did you ever sit thinking with a thousand things on your mind?

Thinking about someone who has treated you so nice and kind



You'll get an old letter and you begin to read

You'll get an old letter and you begin to read

Got the blues so bad tell that man of mine I wanna be



Don't you hear me baby, knocking on your door?

Don't you hear me baby, knocking on your door?

Have you got the nerve to drive me from your door?



Have you got the nerve to say that you don't want me no more?

Have you got the nerve to say that you don't want me no more?

The good book said you got to reap what you sow



Take me back baby, try me one more time

Take me back baby, try me one more time

That's the only way I can get these thinking blues off my mind
