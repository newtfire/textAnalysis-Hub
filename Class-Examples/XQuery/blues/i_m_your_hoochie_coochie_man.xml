<lyrics>



The gypsy woman told my mother

Before I was born

I got a boy child's comin'

He's gonna be a son of a gun

He gonna make pretty women's

Jump and shout

Then the world wanna know

What this all about

But you know I'm him

Everybody knows I'm him

Well you know I'm the 
hoochie
coochie man

Everybody knows I'm him



I got a 
black cat
bone

I got a 
mojo
 too

I got the 
Johnny
Concheroo

I'm gonna mess with you

I'm gonna make you girls

Lead me by my hand

Then the world will know

The hoochie coochie man

But you know I'm him

Everybody knows I'm him

Oh you know I'm the hoochie coochie man

Everybody knows I'm him



On the seventh hours

On the seventh day

On the seventh month

The seven doctors say

He was born for good luck

And that you'll see

I got seven hundred dollars

Don't you mess with me

But you know I'm him

Everybody knows I'm him

Well you know I'm the hoochie coochie man

Everybody knows I'm him
