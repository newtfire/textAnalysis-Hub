(spoken:)

Who is that knockin' on that door? I believe that's that collector
man
1
.

Man, go tell him I ain't got a dime today. Tell him I ain't made a
penny all this week. Tell him I'm just as broke as I can be, oh just
knock him down... Tell him I'll have the money sometime.



Now open the door, here come that collector man

Go open the door, here come that collector man

Why you can tell him I say come back tomorrow, because Sonny Boy
ain't got a doggone thing



Tell him that I ain't got no money, now he knows how times is
today

Tell him that I ain't got no money, then he know how times is
today

Why it's Saturday man ain't got no money, can hardly find a place to
stay



Tell him that someday I'll have some money, now I want everybody to
watch and see

Tell him someday I'll have some money, I want everybody to watch and
see

Why tell him that it's hard to keep down, you know a real good man
like me



Tell him I know I'm down now, now but I won't be down always

Tell him that I'm down now, but I won't be down always

Why now you can tell him to watch and see if don't Sonny Boy get some
money, oh Lord knows some of these days

Note 1: collector man, the man collecting the rent for the house
owner.
