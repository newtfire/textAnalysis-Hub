<l>(spoken:)

</l>
<l>Who is that knockin' on that door? I believe that's that collector
man
1
.

</l>
<l>Man, go tell him I ain't got a dime today. Tell him I ain't made a
penny all this week. Tell him I'm just as broke as I can be, oh just
knock him down... Tell him I'll have the money sometime.



</l>
<l>Now open the door, here come that collector man

</l>
<l>Go open the door, here come that collector man

</l>
<l>Why you can tell him I say come back tomorrow, because Sonny Boy
ain't got a doggone thing



</l>
<l>Tell him that I ain't got no money, now he knows how times is
today

</l>
<l>Tell him that I ain't got no money, then he know how times is
today

</l>
<l>Why it's Saturday man ain't got no money, can hardly find a place to
stay



</l>
<l>Tell him that someday I'll have some money, now I want everybody to
watch and see

</l>
<l>Tell him someday I'll have some money, I want everybody to watch and
see

</l>
<l>Why tell him that it's hard to keep down, you know a real good man
like me



</l>
<l>Tell him I know I'm down now, now but I won't be down always

</l>
<l>Tell him that I'm down now, but I won't be down always

</l>
<l>Why now you can tell him to watch and see if don't Sonny Boy get some
money, oh Lord knows some of these days
