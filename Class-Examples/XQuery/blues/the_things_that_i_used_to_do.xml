<lyrics>



The things that I used to do, Lord, I won't do no more

The things that I used to do, Lord, I won't do no more

I used to sit and hold your hand darlin', and cry, oh babe do not
go



I used to search all night for you darlin',

Lord, and my search would always end in vain

I used to search all night for you darlin',

Lord, and my search would always end in vain

But I knew all the time darlin', that you was hid out wit' your other
man



I'm goin' to send you back to your mama darlin',

Lord, and I'm goin' back to my family too

I'm goin' to send you back to your mama darlin',

Lord, and I'm goin' back to my family too

Nothin' I can do to please ya' darlin', I just can't get along with
you
