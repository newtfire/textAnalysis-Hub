<lyrics>


<l>The things that I used to do, Lord, I won't do no more

</l>
<l>The things that I used to do, Lord, I won't do no more

</l>
<l>I used to sit and hold your hand darlin', and cry, oh babe do not

go




</l>
<l>I used to search all night for you darlin',

</l>
<l>Lord, and my search would always end in vain

</l>
<l>I used to search all night for you darlin',

</l>
<l>Lord, and my search would always end in vain

</l>
<l>But I knew all the time darlin', that you was hid out wit' your other

man




</l>
<l>I'm goin' to send you back to your mama darlin',

</l>
<l>Lord, and I'm goin' back to my family too

</l>
<l>I'm goin' to send you back to your mama darlin',

</l>
<l>Lord, and I'm goin' back to my family too

</l><l>Nothin' I can do to please ya' darlin', I just can't get along with</l>
<l>you</l></lyrics></xml>
