<lyrics>

<l>And I followed her to the station, with my
1

</l>
<l>suitcase in my hand

</l>
<l>And I followed her to the station, with my
1
suitcase in my </l>
<l>hand

</l>
<l>Well, it's hard to tell, it's hard to tell, when all your love's in
vain

</l>
<l>All my love's in vain



</l>
<l>When the train rolled up to the station, I looked her in the eye

</l>
<l>When the train rolled up to the station, and I looked her in the
eye

</l>
<l>Well, I was lonesome, I felt so lonesome, and I could not help but
cry

</l>
<l>All my love's in vain



</l>
<l>When the train, it left the station, with two lights on behind

</l>
<l>When the train, it left the station, with two lights on behind

</l>
<l>Well, the blue light was my blues, and the red light was my mind

</l>
<l>All my love's in vain



</l>
<l>Ou hou ou ou ou, hoo, Willie Mae

</l>
<l>Oh oh oh oh oh hey, hoo, Willie Mae

</l>
<l>Ou ou ou ou ou ou hee vee oh woe

</l>
<l>All my love's in vain
