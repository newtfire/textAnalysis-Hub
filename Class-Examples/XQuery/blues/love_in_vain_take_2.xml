<lyrics>



And I followed her to the station, with my
1

suitcase in my hand

And I followed her to the station, with my
1
 suitcase in my
hand

Well, it's hard to tell, it's hard to tell, when all your love's in
vain

All my love's in vain



When the train rolled up to the station, I looked her in the eye

When the train rolled up to the station, and I looked her in the
eye

Well, I was lonesome, I felt so lonesome, and I could not help but
cry

All my love's in vain



When the train, it left the station, with two lights on behind

When the train, it left the station, with two lights on behind

Well, the blue light was my blues, and the red light was my mind

All my love's in vain



Ou hou ou ou ou, hoo, Willie Mae

Oh oh oh oh oh hey, hoo, Willie Mae

Ou ou ou ou ou ou hee vee oh woe

All my love's in vain
