<lyrics>



Play on little girl, just keep on having fun

Play on little girl, just keep on having fun

You ball everyday, and you leave your work undone



Yes I love my baby, oh yes I really do

Well, I love my baby, oh yes I really do

Why not stay at home baby, and let me ball some too



Play on little girl, play until the morning sun

Play on little girl, play until the morning sun

You don't live but once, so you're playing days are done
