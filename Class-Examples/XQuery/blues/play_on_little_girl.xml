<l>Play on little girl, just keep on having fun

</l>
<l>Play on little girl, just keep on having fun

</l>
<l>You ball everyday, and you leave your work undone



</l>
<l>Yes I love my baby, oh yes I really do

</l>
<l>Well, I love my baby, oh yes I really do

</l>
<l>Why not stay at home baby, and let me ball some too



</l>
<l>Play on little girl, play until the morning sun

</l>
<l>Play on little girl, play until the morning sun

</l>
<l>You don't live but once, so you're playing days are done</l></lyrics></xml>
