<lyrics>



Say what you wanna

Say what you please

It don't make no difference, baby

You're all right with me

I'm gonna keep on loving you, baby

I'm gonna keep on till the day I die

I keep on loving you

Baby, because the way you satisfy



I'm gonna tell you one thing

I'm not gonna say it again

The way I love you, baby

You know it's a doggone sin

Gonna keep on loving you

I'm gonna keep on loving you, woman

Baby, until the day I die, yeah
