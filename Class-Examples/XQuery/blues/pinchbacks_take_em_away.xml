<lyrics>

<l>Girls, I wanna tell you about these sweet men

</l>
<l>These men goin' around here tryin' to play cute

</l>
<l>I'm hard on you boys, yes sir!



</l>
<l>I fell in love with a sweet man once

</l>
<l>He said he loved me too

</l>
<l>He said if I'd run away with him

</l>
<l>What nice things he would do

</l>
<l>I'd travel around from town to town

</l>
<l>How happy I would feel

</l>
<l>But don't you know he would not work

</l>
<l>Girls, take this tip from me



</l>
<l>Get a working man when you marry

</l>
<l>And let all these sweet men be

</l>
<l>Child, it takes money to run a business

</l>
<l>And with me I know you girls will agree

</l>
<l>There's one thing about this married life

</l>
<l>That these young girls have got to know

</l>
<l>Say, if a sweet man enter your front gate

</l>
<l>Turn out your light and lock your door



</l>
<l>Yes, get a working man when you marry

</l>
<l>Let all these pinchbacks
1
be </l>
<l>
Child, it takes money to run a business

</l>
<l>And with me I know you girls will agree

</l>
<l>And if this panic stays on much longer

</l>
<l>I'll hear all these young girls say

</l>
<l>That it's a long way to Oklahoma

</l>
<l>But these little pinchbacks, take them away



</l>
<note>Note 1: pinchbacks, pinchbecks in modern day spelling, an alloy of
copper and zinc used especially to imitate gold in jewelry. Also,
something counterfeit or spurious. In the context of the song it is
used for men who give their lovers cheap fake gold jewelry</note></lyrics></xml>
