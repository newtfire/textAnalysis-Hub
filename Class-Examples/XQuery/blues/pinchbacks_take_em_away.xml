<lyrics>



Girls, I wanna tell you about these sweet men

These men goin' around here tryin' to play cute

I'm hard on you boys, yes sir!



I fell in love with a sweet man once

He said he loved me too

He said if I'd run away with him

What nice things he would do

I'd travel around from town to town

How happy I would feel

But don't you know he would not work

Girls, take this tip from me



Get a working man when you marry

And let all these sweet men be

Child, it takes money to run a business

And with me I know you girls will agree

There's one thing about this married life

That these young girls have got to know

Say, if a sweet man enter your front gate

Turn out your light and lock your door



Yes, get a working man when you marry

Let all these pinchbacks
1
 be

Child, it takes money to run a business

And with me I know you girls will agree

And if this panic stays on much longer

I'll hear all these young girls say

That it's a long way to Oklahoma

But these little pinchbacks, take them away



__________

Note 1: pinchbacks, pinchbecks in modern day spelling, an alloy of
copper and zinc used especially to imitate gold in jewelry. Also,
something counterfeit or spurious. In the context of the song it is
used for men who give their lovers cheap fake gold jewelry.
