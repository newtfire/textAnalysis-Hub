<lyrics>



Now ever since, Louisa, been gone, my life don't seem the
same

Now ever since, Louisa, been gone, my life don't seem the same

Now, you know it breaks my heart, an, to hear anybody call, Miss
Louisa, names



Now, Miss Louisa, mistreated me and she drove me from her door

Now, that Miss Louisa, she mistreated me, Lord, and she drove me from
her door

Now, that will be alright with me, Louisa, you have got to reap just
what you sow



Now, Louisa, you know I haven't been, not the very best that I could
have

Now Louisa, you know I haven't been, not the very best that I could
have

Now then, if you don't treat me no better, Lord, I sure do wish you
would



Now but that will be alright, Louisa, you will come back home some
day

Now but that will be alright, Louisa, you will come back home some
day

Now, but I'm scared that when you get back, Louisa, you ain't gonna
have no place to stay
