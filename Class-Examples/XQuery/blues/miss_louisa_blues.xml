<lyrics>


<l>Now ever since, Louisa, been gone, my life don't seem the
same

</l>
<l>Now ever since, Louisa, been gone, my life don't seem the same

</l>
<l>Now, you know it breaks my heart, an, to hear anybody call, Miss

Louisa, names




</l>
<l>Now, Miss Louisa, mistreated me and she drove me from her door

</l>
<l>Now, that Miss Louisa, she mistreated me, Lord, and she drove me from
her door

</l>
<l>Now, that will be alright with me, Louisa, you have got to reap just

what you sow




</l>
<l>Now, Louisa, you know I haven't been, not the very best that I could
have

</l>
<l>Now Louisa, you know I haven't been, not the very best that I could
have

</l>
<l>Now then, if you don't treat me no better, Lord, I sure do wish you

would




</l>
<l>Now but that will be alright, Louisa, you will come back home some
day

</l>
<l>Now but that will be alright, Louisa, you will come back home some
day

</l><l>Now, but I'm scared that when you get back, Louisa, you ain't gonna</l>
<l>have no place to stay</l></lyrics></xml>
