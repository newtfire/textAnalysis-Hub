<lyrics>



Hey, I went 'cross town to see my woman

I knocked upon her door

She said, "Baby I'm glad ya stopped by,

I just can't see ya no more"



Honey you've been replaced

(Honey you've been replaced)

I need a change of pace

(I need a change of pace)



Well I found a new face, so

Baby stay away, I need a change of pace



I never thought that she was cheating

I was the last one to know

I found out, yesterday

When I knocked upon her door



Honey you've been replaced

(Honey you've been replaced)

I need a change of pace

(I need a change of pace)



Honey, I found a new face

Baby stay away

(I need a change of pace)



Um!



I passed her on the sidewalk

Ya almost didn't even speak

People, I felt so doggone bad

Yes and my knees got weak



She said, you've been replaced

(Honey you've been replaced)

I need a change of pace

(I need a change of pace)

Honey I've found a new face

So baby stay away

(I need a change of pace)



I need a change of pace

(I need a change of pace)

I need a change of pace

(I need a change of pace)

Well I found a new face

So baby stay away, I need a change of pace



(Change of pace)

(I need a change of pace)

(Change of pace)

(I need a change of pace)



(I found a brand new face)

(Honey, you've been replaced)

(I need a change of pace)



(Change of pace)

Woo!

(I need a change of pace)

(Change of pace)

(I need a change of pace)



(I found a brand new face)

(Honey, you've been replaced)

(I need a change of pace)



(Change of pace)

(I need a change of pace)

(Change of pace)

(I need a change of pace)



(Honey, you've been replaced)



(I need a change of pace)

(I found a brand new face)

(Honey, you've been replaced)

(I need a change of pace)



(I need a change of pace)

(I need a change of pace)



Fading:

(Change of pace)

(I need a change of pace)

(I got a brand new face...)
