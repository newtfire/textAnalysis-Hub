<lyrics>


<l>Hey, I went 'cross town to see my woman

</l>
<l>I knocked upon her door

</l>
<l>She said, "Baby I'm glad ya stopped by,

</l>
<l>I just can't see ya no more"



</l>
<l>Honey you've been replaced

</l>
<l>(Honey you've been replaced)

</l>
<l>I need a change of pace

</l>
<l>(I need a change of pace)



</l>
<l>Well I found a new face, so

</l>
<l>Baby stay away, I need a change of pace



</l>
<l>I never thought that she was cheating

</l>
<l>I was the last one to know

</l>
<l>I found out, yesterday

</l>
<l>When I knocked upon her door



</l>
<l>Honey you've been replaced

</l>
<l>(Honey you've been replaced)

</l>
<l>I need a change of pace

</l>
<l>(I need a change of pace)



</l>
<l>Honey, I found a new face

</l>
<l>Baby stay away

</l>
<l>(I need a change of pace)



</l>
<l>Um!



</l>
<l>I passed her on the sidewalk

</l>
<l>Ya almost didn't even speak

</l>
<l>People, I felt so doggone bad

</l>
<l>Yes and my knees got weak



</l>
<l>She said, you've been replaced

</l>
<l>(Honey you've been replaced)

</l>
<l>I need a change of pace

</l>
<l>(I need a change of pace)

</l>
<l>Honey I've found a new face

</l>
<l>So baby stay away

</l>
<l>(I need a change of pace)



</l>
<l>I need a change of pace

</l>
<l>(I need a change of pace)

</l>
<l>I need a change of pace

</l>
<l>(I need a change of pace)

</l>
<l>Well I found a new face

</l>
<l>So baby stay away, I need a change of pace



</l>
<l>(Change of pace)

</l>
<l>(I need a change of pace)

</l>
<l>(Change of pace)

</l>
<l>(I need a change of pace)



</l>
<l>(I found a brand new face)

</l>
<l>(Honey, you've been replaced)

</l>
<l>(I need a change of pace)



</l>
<l>(Change of pace)

</l>
<l>Woo!

</l>
