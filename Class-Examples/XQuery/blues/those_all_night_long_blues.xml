<lyrics>


<l>I have sent a letter away 'cause my man and I don't agree

</l>
<l>There's no reason why he should treat me this way

</l>
<l>'Cause the way I worry, I will soon be old and grey



</l>
<l>Don't want to do nothing that's wrong

</l>
<l>But can't stand this treatment long

</l>
<l>I just lay and suffer, crying, sighing all night long

</l>
<l>'Cause the way that I'm worried, Lordy it sure is wrong



</l>
<l>All night long, all night long

</l>
<l>It's this one man on my mind

</l>
<l>Can't sleep a wink at night from crying

</l>
<l>All night long, got my worries just renewed

</l>
<l>And I suffer with those all night blues</l></lyrics></xml>
