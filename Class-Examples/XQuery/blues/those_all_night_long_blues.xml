<lyrics>



I have sent a letter away 'cause my man and I don't agree

There's no reason why he should treat me this way

'Cause the way I worry, I will soon be old and grey



Don't want to do nothing that's wrong

But can't stand this treatment long

I just lay and suffer, crying, sighing all night long

'Cause the way that I'm worried, Lordy it sure is wrong



All night long, all night long

It's this one man on my mind

Can't sleep a wink at night from crying

All night long, got my worries just renewed

And I suffer with those all night blues
