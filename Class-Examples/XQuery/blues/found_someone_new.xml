<lyrics>


<l>Tired of being alone

</l>
<l>Waiting on you to phone baby

</l>
<l>It's four in the morning and I'm cold

</l>
<l>There ain't no one to hold me



</l>
<l>I know that's it's real

</l>
<l>I found someone new

</l>
<l>I know it's not right

</l>
<l>But I can't give up this fight

</l>
<l>'Cause I'm tired of being lonely

</l>
<l>Think it's me that's been wrong



</l>
<l>I know I love you today

</l>
<l>Oh but I don't love you in that way

</l>
<l>Trying to make a new start

</l>
<l>'Cause your running with my heart



</l>
<l>I know that it's real

</l>
<l>I found someone new

</l>
<l>I know it's not right

</l>
<l>But I won't give up this fight

</l>
<l>I know that it's true

</l>
<l>I found someone new

</l>
<l>I know it's not right

</l>
<l>But I won't give up, I won't, I won't, I won't

</l>
<l>I won't give up this fight



</l>
<l>I know that it's true

</l>
<l>I found someone new

</l>
<l>And I'm tired of being lonely

</l>
<l>Think it's me that's been wrong

</l>
<l>Darling I'm the only one who's strong

</l>
<l>I've been strong</l></lyrics></xml>
