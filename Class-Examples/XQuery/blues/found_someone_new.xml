<lyrics>



Tired of being alone

Waiting on you to phone baby

It's four in the morning and I'm cold

There ain't no one to hold me



I know that's it's real

I found someone new

I know it's not right

But I can't give up this fight

'Cause I'm tired of being lonely

Think it's me that's been wrong



I know I love you today

Oh but I don't love you in that way

Trying to make a new start

'Cause your running with my heart



I know that it's real

I found someone new

I know it's not right

But I won't give up this fight

I know that it's true

I found someone new

I know it's not right

But I won't give up, I won't, I won't, I won't

I won't give up this fight



I know that it's true

I found someone new

And I'm tired of being lonely

Think it's me that's been wrong

Darling I'm the only one who's strong

I've been strong
