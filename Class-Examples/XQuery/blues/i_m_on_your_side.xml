Get with me baby

I'm on your side

Get with me baby

I'm on your side



Well there's a change

In the weather

Change of time

But I'm a stubborn man

I won't change my mind

Get with me baby

I'm on your side



Talk to me baby

I'm on your side

Talk with me baby

I'm on your side



I don't wanna argue

Sure don't wanna fight

Just tell me what's wrong

And let me make it alright

Get with me baby

I'm on your side



Ill be your sugar daddy

Just call on me

Ill be your vigilante

If that's what you need baby

What I need to be girl



Get with me baby

I'm on your side

Get with me baby

I'm on your side



Now I don't wanna own you

Like a private property

Come on baby

Just be nice to me

Get with me baby

I'm on your side



Get with me baby

I'm on your side
