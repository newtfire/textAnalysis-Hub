<lyrics>



Well I am a rambling kid, I've been rambling all of my
days

Yes, I am a rambling kid, I've been rambling all of my days

Well, you know my baby she want me to stop rambling, so she says
she'll change her ways



Well, now it ain't no use to you rambling, when your baby don't want
you to ramble around

Yes, now it ain't no use to you rambling, when your baby don't want
you to ramble around

Well keep on rambling, she be done drove on out of this town



Now I ain't gonna ramble, babe, I ain't gonna ramble no more

Yes, I ain't gonna ramble, babe, I ain't gonna ramble no more

Well, you know if I keep on a-rambling, I be drifting from door to
door



Well, now, I'm leaving, I'm leaving baby, no I ain't gonna ramble no
more

Lord, I'm leaving, I'm leaving baby, no I ain't gonna ramble no
more

Well, you know I have been rambling around here, lose a woman
everywhere I go
