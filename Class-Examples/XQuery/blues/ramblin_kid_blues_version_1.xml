<l>Well I am a rambling kid, I've been rambling all of my
days

</l>
<l>Yes, I am a rambling kid, I've been rambling all of my days

</l>
<l>Well, you know my baby she want me to stop rambling, so she says

she'll change her ways




</l>
<l>Well, now it ain't no use to you rambling, when your baby don't want
you to ramble around

</l>
<l>Yes, now it ain't no use to you rambling, when your baby don't want
you to ramble around

</l>
<l>Well keep on rambling, she be done drove on out of this town



</l>
<l>Now I ain't gonna ramble, babe, I ain't gonna ramble no more

</l>
<l>Yes, I ain't gonna ramble, babe, I ain't gonna ramble no more

</l>
<l>Well, you know if I keep on a-rambling, I be drifting from door to

door




</l>
<l>Well, now, I'm leaving, I'm leaving baby, no I ain't gonna ramble no
more

</l>
<l>Lord, I'm leaving, I'm leaving baby, no I ain't gonna ramble no
more

</l>
<l>Well, you know I have been rambling around here, lose a woman

everywhere I go
