<lyrics>



Lord I heard somebody, keeps on callin' me

Lord I heard, Lord I heard, yes somebody, keeps on callin', callin'
me

Lord I heard, baby don't worry

Lord I heard, Lord I heard, yes somebody, keeps on callin'



I got a gal in Cuba, I got three in Spain

Gal in Cuba, Lord I got, three in Spain

Lord, one in Memphis, scared to call

Woman in Memphis Lord, Lord I'm scared,

scared to call her name, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord



I got the meanest woman, Lord, that you ever seen

Meanest woman, Lord I have ever, ever seen

Ask for whiskey, give me gas, gasoline

Ask for whiskey and give me, gasoline

Lord I got the mean, meanest woman, Lord I ever, ever seen Lord
