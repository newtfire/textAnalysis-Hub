<l>Oh well, this here's my last affair

</l>
<l>Oh well, this here's my last affair

</l>
<l>I'm gon' grab my clothes, baby, daddy's gonna leave you there



</l>
<l>Ooo yeah, you can write to me sometime

</l>
<l>Ooo yeah darlin', you can write to me sometime

</l>
<l>If you write to me, darlin', I'll let ya know, I feel fine



</l>
<l>Too late to worry, too late to worry when I'm gone

</l>
<l>Too late to worry, darlin', too late to worry when I'm gone

</l><l>I'm leavin' you early in the mo'nin', because little girl, well, you</l>
<l>have done me wrong</l></lyrics></xml>
