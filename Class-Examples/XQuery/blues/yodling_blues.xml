<lyrics>



The blues, the blues, the yodling
1
 blues

They seem to haunt me all the time

Because that I ain't got no one

That will console my mind

It seems to me no happiness will I ever find

No happiness will I find



Lord, lord, lord, lord

Lord, lord, lord, lord

My man went out without a cause



I wonder who put them 
jinx

on me, I said, them jinx on me,

I wonder who put them jinx on me, lowdown jinx on me

My man's gone back to his used-to-be



I'm gonna yodel, yodel my blues away, I said, my blues away

I'm gonna yodel, yodel my blues away, ee-ooo, I'm gonna yodel

Till things come back my way



I've got the blues, go spread the news

I've got those doggone yodling blues



__________

Note 1: yodling, to sing by suddenly changing from a natural voice to
a falsetto and back. Also, to shout or call in a similar manner. From
the German word Jodeln.
