<l>The blues, the blues, the yodling
1
blues </l>
<l>
They seem to haunt me all the time

</l>
<l>Because that I ain't got no one

</l>
<l>That will console my mind

</l>
<l>It seems to me no happiness will I ever find

</l>
<l>No happiness will I find



</l>
<l>Lord, lord, lord, lord

</l>
<l>Lord, lord, lord, lord

</l>
<l>My man went out without a cause



</l>
<l>I wonder who put them 
jinx

</l>
<l>on me, I said, them jinx on me,

</l>
<l>I wonder who put them jinx on me, lowdown jinx on me

</l>
<l>My man's gone back to his used-to-be



</l>
<l>I'm gonna yodel, yodel my blues away, I said, my blues away

</l>
<l>I'm gonna yodel, yodel my blues away, ee-ooo, I'm gonna yodel

</l>
<l>Till things come back my way



</l>
<l>I've got the blues, go spread the news

</l>
<l>I've got those doggone yodling blues

<note>Note 1: yodling, to sing by suddenly changing from a natural voice to
a falsetto and back. Also, to shout or call in a similar manner. From
the German word Jodeln</note></lyrics></xml>
