<lyrics>


<l>Bo Diddley bought his baby a diamond ring, but that diamond ring
don't shine

</l>
<l>So he better take it to a private eye

</l>
<l>If that private eye can't see, he better not take that ring from

me




</l>
<l>Bo Diddley bought him a nanny goat, to make his pretty baby a Sunday
coat

</l>
<l>Bo Diddley caught him a bear cat, to make his pretty baby a Sunday

hat





</l>
<l>Mojo

, mojo, and 
black
cat bone
, took Bo Diddley away from home


</l>
<l>Mother ask mojo, where you been?

</l>
<l>Up to Bo Diddley's house and back again

</l>
<l>Bo Diddley, Bo Diddley, have you heard?

</l>
<l>My pretty baby says she wants a bird</l></lyrics></xml>
