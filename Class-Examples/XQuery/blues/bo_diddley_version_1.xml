<lyrics>



Bo Diddley bought his baby a diamond ring, but that diamond ring
don't shine

So he better take it to a private eye

If that private eye can't see, he better not take that ring from
me



Bo Diddley bought him a nanny goat, to make his pretty baby a Sunday
coat

Bo Diddley caught him a bear cat, to make his pretty baby a Sunday
hat




Mojo
, mojo, and 
black
cat bone
, took Bo Diddley away from home

Mother ask mojo, where you been?

Up to Bo Diddley's house and back again

Bo Diddley, Bo Diddley, have you heard?

My pretty baby says she wants a bird
