<lyrics>


<l>There's no doubt about it

</l>
<l>A may as well shout about it

</l>
<l>I got the blues

</l>
<l>I got'em bad



</l>
<l>Yes this awful feeling

</l>
<l>When you don't have what you thought you had

</l>
<l>Oh yesterday, yesterday I sang love songs

</l>
<l>But today I got'em bad



</l>
<l>Oh, I didn't know she would leave me

</l>
<l>I didn't know she was gone

</l>
<l>Well, at last she should've told me goodbye people

</l>
<l>But she stole away while I was gone

</l>
<l>Yes that's what makes me feel so sad people

</l>
<l>Oh, and today I got'em bad



</l>
<l>Oh, I could tell you much more people

</l>
<l>But I think you already how I feel

</l>
<l>Oh, I could tell you much, much, much more people

</l>
<l>But I think you already how I feel

</l>
<l>Yes, you know I'm hurt beyond explaining people

</l>
<l>And it's all because I've got a dirty deal</l></lyrics></xml>
