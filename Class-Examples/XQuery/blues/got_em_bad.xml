<lyrics>



There's no doubt about it

A may as well shout about it

I got the blues

I got'em bad



Yes this awful feeling

When you don't have what you thought you had

Oh yesterday, yesterday I sang love songs

But today I got'em bad



Oh, I didn't know she would leave me

I didn't know she was gone

Well, at last she should've told me goodbye people

But she stole away while I was gone

Yes that's what makes me feel so sad people

Oh, and today I got'em bad



Oh, I could tell you much more people

But I think you already how I feel

Oh, I could tell you much, much, much more people

But I think you already how I feel

Yes, you know I'm hurt beyond explaining people

And it's all because I've got a dirty deal
