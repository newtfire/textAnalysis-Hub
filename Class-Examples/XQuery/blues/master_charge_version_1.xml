<l>(Sax intro by Jon Smith)



</l>
<l>I got my wife a charge card

</l>
<l>Just the other day

</l>
<l>I owe five hundred dollars

</l>
<l>Just for yesterday



</l>
<l>I said, "Honey, here's a present

</l>
<l>Go out and shop around,

</l>
<l>buy you a couple a-dresses,

</l>
<l>browse around downtown"



</l>
<l>She did just what I told her

</l>
<l>Bought one, two, three

</l>
<l>Came home lookin' silly

</l>
<l>Makin' goo-goo eyes at me



</l>
<l>Mastercharge, I'll break an' bury her card

</l>
<l>Mastercharge, I'll break an' bury her card

</l>
<l>Mastercharge, I'll break an' bury her card



</l>
<l>Oh yeah, charge it!



</l>
<l>Said, "Did you get your dress?"

</l>
<l>"Yes, one or two"

</l>
<l>I needed me some shoes,

</l>
<l>I needed some jewelry, too"



</l>
<l>Two hundred dollar dresses

</l>
<l>I could-a made, I can't sew

</l>
<l>It made me so mad

</l>
<l>I could call her a so and so



</l>
<l>Mastercharge, I'll break an' bury her card

</l>
<l>Mastercharge, break an' bury her card

</l>
<l>Mastercharge, break an' bury her card



</l>
<l>Oh yeah, charge it for me, charge it, baby!



</l>
<l>Hey! Ow!



</l>
<l>For one-a that gal's dresses, yeah

</l>
<l>I paid one and a half

</l>
<l>I'm so mad, I just had to laugh



</l>
<l>I could see in my mind

</l>
<l>On a horse like Paul Revere

</l>
<l>Hate to check my mail boxes

</l>
<l>'Cause these bills keep comin' here



</l>
<l>Mastercharge, break an' bury her card

</l>
<l>Mastercharge, break an' bury her card

</l>
<l>Mastercharge, break an' bury her card



</l>
<l>Oh, let's charge it!



</l>
<l>(Speaks with instrumental back up)



</l>
<l>"Oh, don't get too much on the bill, dear"

</l>
<l>("Oh, I put five hundred dollars already, baby")

</l>
<l>"Yeah, but I know, but I'm-a, you know that, that, that, 18% is
