<lyrics>



Well, now, there's two, there's two trains running

Well, they ain't never, no, going my way

Well, now, one run at midnight and the other one,

running just 'fore day,

it's running just 'fore day,

it's running just 'fore day

Oh Lord. sure 'nough they is

Oh well



Mm mm, ho ho ho, somebody help me, ho, with these blues

Well, now, she's the one I'm loving, she's the one

I do hate to lose,

I do hate to lose,

I do hate to lose

Oh Lord, sure 'nough I do

Oh well



I been crazy; yes, I been a fool, I been crazy, oh, all of my
life

Well I done fell in love with a,

with another man's wife,

with another man's wife,

with another man's wife

Oh Lord, sure 'nough I done

Oh well



Lord, she's so long and tall, till she weep like a willow tree

Well, now, they say she's no good, but she's all right,

she's all right with me,

she's all right, she's all right,

she's all right, she's all right
