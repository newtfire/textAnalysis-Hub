<lyrics>


<l>Bad luck has come to stay

</l>
<l>Trouble never end

</l>
<l>My man has gone away

</l>
<l>With a girl I thought was my friend

</l>
<l>I'm worried down with care

</l>
<l>Lordy, can't you hear my prayer



</l>
<l>Lady Luck, Lady Luck

</l>
<l>Won't you please smile down on me

</l>
<l>There's the time, friend of mine

</l>
<l>I need your sympathy

</l>
<l>I've got a horseshoe on my door

</l>
<l>I've knocked on wood till my hands are sore

</l>
<l>Since my man's done turned me loose

</l>
<l>I've got those Lady Luck blues, I mean

</l>
<l>I've got those Lady Luck blues



</l>
<l>Lady Luck, Lady Luck

</l>
<l>Won't you please smile down on me

</l>
<l>There's the time, friend of mine

</l>
<l>I need your sympathy

</l>
<l>I've got his picture turned upside down

</l>
<l>I've sprinkled 
goofer
dust
all around </l>
<l>
Since my man is gone I'm all confused

</l>
<l>I've got those Lady Luck blues

</l>
<l>Find my good man

</l>
<l>I've got those Lady Luck blues</l></lyrics></xml>
