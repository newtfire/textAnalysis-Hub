<lyrics>



Bad luck has come to stay

Trouble never end

My man has gone away

With a girl I thought was my friend

I'm worried down with care

Lordy, can't you hear my prayer



Lady Luck, Lady Luck

Won't you please smile down on me

There's the time, friend of mine

I need your sympathy

I've got a horseshoe on my door

I've knocked on wood till my hands are sore

Since my man's done turned me loose

I've got those Lady Luck blues, I mean

I've got those Lady Luck blues



Lady Luck, Lady Luck

Won't you please smile down on me

There's the time, friend of mine

I need your sympathy

I've got his picture turned upside down

I've sprinkled 
goofer
dust
 all around

Since my man is gone I'm all confused

I've got those Lady Luck blues

Find my good man

I've got those Lady Luck blues
