<l>Hey, hey, hey!

</l>
<l>I'm leavin', leavin', leavin',

</l>
<l>won't be back no more

</l>
<l>Lord, Lord

</l>
<l>Lord, Lord

</l>
<l>Cuttin' out this morning,

</l>
<l>won't be back no more

</l>
<l>Hey!

</l>
<l>Hey!

</l>
<l>Won't be back no more



</l>
<l>My woman told me, "Hit the road Johnny,

</l>
<l>don't come back no more"

</l>
<l>Packed my suitcase,

</l>
<l>went on down the line

</l>
<l>I got down, to the station

</l>
<l>with suitcase in my hand



</l>
<l>The train was leaving

</l>
<l>Oh, the train would leave, the train was leaving

</l>
<l>I said, "Hold the train conductor, I ain't got the time,

</l>
<l>get a ticket, I got money in my hand"

</l>
<l>Paid my fare, the train started movin'

</l>
<l>Paid my fare, when the train got movin'

</l>
<l>Oh, don't stop rollin' 'til the whole state's outta sight

</l>
<l>Whole state!

</l>
<l>Outta sight

</l>
<l>Lord, Lord, Lord

</l>
<l>I feel so bad



</l>
<l>Hey!



</l>
<l>I was sittin' way down inside

</l>
<l>I was sittin' there cryin', cryin'

</l>
<l>The train was movin', the train was movin'

</l>
<l>Conductor told me, said, "Johnny stop cryin', stop cryin'"

</l>
<l>Gon' take you 'way from here

</l>
<l>Down the line,

</l>
<l>down the line,

</l>
<l>down the line,

</l>
<l>down the line

</l>
<l>Woo!

</l>
<l>Stop crying, stop crying, stop cryin', stop crying

</l>
<l>Takin' you away from here, down the line

</l><l>Ooh</l></lyrics></xml>
