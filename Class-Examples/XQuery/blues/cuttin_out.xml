<lyrics>



Hey, hey, hey!

I'm leavin', leavin', leavin',

won't be back no more

Lord, Lord

Lord, Lord

Cuttin' out this morning,

won't be back no more

Hey!

Hey!

Won't be back no more



My woman told me, "Hit the road Johnny,

don't come back no more"

Packed my suitcase,

went on down the line

I got down, to the station

with suitcase in my hand



The train was leaving

Oh, the train would leave, the train was leaving

I said, "Hold the train conductor, I ain't got the time,

get a ticket, I got money in my hand"

Paid my fare, the train started movin'

Paid my fare, when the train got movin'

Oh, don't stop rollin' 'til the whole state's outta sight

Whole state!

Outta sight

Lord, Lord, Lord

I feel so bad



Hey!



I was sittin' way down inside

I was sittin' there cryin', cryin'

The train was movin', the train was movin'

Conductor told me, said, "Johnny stop cryin', stop cryin'"

Gon' take you 'way from here

Down the line,

down the line,

down the line,

down the line

Woo!

Stop crying, stop crying, stop cryin', stop crying

Takin' you away from here, down the line

Ooh
