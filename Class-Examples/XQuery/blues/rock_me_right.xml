<lyrics>



You say you haven't been rocked in a
long, long time

Oh, good, hard rockin' is so hard to find baby

Gonna make you sweat, gonna make you shout

Oh, your homemade lovin' done knocked me out baby

Oh, now I've looked long enough for you

And let's see if you know what I'm fixin' to do baby

Oh, you wanna little love and that's alright

Oh, your fruit ain't rotten it's oh so right

Oh now, your mama sure done raised you right

When it comes to home cookin' you eat every bite

Take your sweet time, got all night

I'm gonna show you how to rock me right



Come on and rock me right

Rock me right

Rock me right

I'm gonna show you how to rock me right

Rock me right oh, oh lord



Well your stomach starts growling, I know what you need baby

Oh, fix me up something salty and sweet

Oh, now homemade cookin' always does the trick

Oh, your cotton ain't rotten just needs to be picked

Oh now, your mama sure done raised you right

When it comes to home cookin' you eat every bite

Take your sweet time, got all night

I'm gonna show you how to rock me right



Come on and rock me right

Oh, rock me right

Rock me right

I'm gonna show you how to rock me right

Oh, come on and rock me right lord

Oh, rock me right now

Yeah, rock me right



I'm gonna show you how to rock me right

Show me how you do it darlin'

Show me how you do it baby

Rock me all night
