<lyrics>



Caught in quicksand

Starting to sink

So tired of struggling

That my mind can barely think

Don't know where I'm going

Lord, I don't know what I'm gonna do



Fuel supply is finished

Ain't nothing left to burn

I need someone to help me

But I don't know which way to turn

I know I don't have much of a choice

I'll go out of my mind

Or into the night



Rolling and tumbling

Spinning end over end

Got to have some peace and quiet

So I can find myself again

Ask me what's the matter

Hey, I don't know what to say



People all around me

But I'm so alone

I guess they'd like to help me

But I have to do it on my own

I know I don't have much of a choice

I'll go out of my mind

Or into the night
