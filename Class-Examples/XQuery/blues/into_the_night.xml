<lyrics>


<l>Caught in quicksand

</l>
<l>Starting to sink

</l>
<l>So tired of struggling

</l>
<l>That my mind can barely think

</l>
<l>Don't know where I'm going

</l>
<l>Lord, I don't know what I'm gonna do



</l>
<l>Fuel supply is finished

</l>
<l>Ain't nothing left to burn

</l>
<l>I need someone to help me

</l>
<l>But I don't know which way to turn

</l>
<l>I know I don't have much of a choice

</l>
<l>I'll go out of my mind

</l>
<l>Or into the night



</l>
<l>Rolling and tumbling

</l>
<l>Spinning end over end

</l>
<l>Got to have some peace and quiet

</l>
<l>So I can find myself again

</l>
<l>Ask me what's the matter

</l>
<l>Hey, I don't know what to say



</l>
<l>People all around me

</l>
<l>But I'm so alone

</l>
<l>I guess they'd like to help me

</l>
<l>But I have to do it on my own

</l>
<l>I know I don't have much of a choice

</l>
<l>I'll go out of my mind

</l><l>Or into the night</l></lyrics></xml>
