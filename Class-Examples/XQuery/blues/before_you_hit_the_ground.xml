<lyrics>





I seen every one of the faces you wear,
low, high and everything in between
Your eyes are fixed on the prize like a dead man's stare
Tick. tock, the hands on the clock don't care

Buzz is good
Feelin' fine
One of these days,
you'll be out of time
God ain't gonna look for you,
down in the lost and found
You better look up or you're gonna be gone,
before you hit the ground

You'll keep dippin' in till the well run dry,
hope you don't get thirsty later
I know talking to you's just a waste of my time,
I'm gonna stop tellin' you how to live your life

One more, time to score so make it fast,
when you lose your mind you got no mind left to lose
Three, four open the door to your last chance,
and when you get where you're goin' you won't be comin' back

You better look up or you're gonna be gone,
before you hit the ground
