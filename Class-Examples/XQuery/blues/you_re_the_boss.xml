<lyrics>



When it comes to rocking

And natural finger popping

Baby, you sure do swing

And when it comes to rocking

And natural finger popping

Daddy, you're the king

Baby, you've got me beat

Up and down

Inside and out and across

But in the middle of the night

When the moon is shining bright

Lord, you're the boss



Talking about dancing

And down home romancing

Daddy, you make me scream

Talking about dancing

And down home romancing

Baby, you're the queen

Man, when push comes to shove

When it comes down to love

You're a horse

But in the middle of the night

When the moon is shining bright

You're the boss



You're the best of everything

You're a peach

You're so sweet

You're a diamond

You're the gem

You're the best of everything

Daddy, you're my man

Baby, you're my girl



When it comes to knowing

Which way the wind is blowing

Baby, you're so wise

And when it comes to knowing

Which way the wind is blowing

Daddy, Lord, you take the prize

Baby, you're the best

When it comes to cooking up

Some chili sauce

Yeah, but in the middle of the night

When the moon is shining bright

B.B., you're the boss

You're the boss

You're the boss

You're the boss

You're the boss



Yes, you're the boss, baby

You pay the cost

Well, yes, I do, but -

Keep on running

You're running slower than you used to

But you're still the boss

I'm getting a little old, baby

Take it easy now

Getting better looking everyday

Oh yeah, I know that, I know that

B.B.!

Yes, that's me

Belongs to Brown

Hey, hey

Remember what I told you all them years I'd catch you?

Yeah

You slowed down a little bit. Look out, I'm almost closed off

I'm closing in, I'm closing in

Come here, baby

Give me a little time

B.B. Oh, brown and beautiful

Yes, yes, that's me

I didn't make my move too soon, did I?

Not yet, but just take it easy on me now

Is the thrill gone?

Not yet, baby, not yet!

Oh Lord, baby

I think that you never treated me mean

That's why I keep coming back for more

Go back to the source, baby

I hear you, I hear you

Oh baby, they didn't name you B.B. for nothing

You pay the cost?

Yes, I do

And I always come back to the boss

Come on to me. Come on to me

Baby, you're the boss

Yes

Always was my horse

Now talk to me, talk to me

Oh, you sure you named that guitar right?

Yes, I did

Should have been called "Ruth", I know

Lucille
