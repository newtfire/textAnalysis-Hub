<l>When it comes to rocking

</l>
<l>And natural finger popping

</l>
<l>Baby, you sure do swing

</l>
<l>And when it comes to rocking

</l>
<l>And natural finger popping

</l>
<l>Daddy, you're the king

</l>
<l>Baby, you've got me beat

</l>
<l>Up and down

</l>
<l>Inside and out and across

</l>
<l>But in the middle of the night

</l>
<l>When the moon is shining bright

</l>
<l>Lord, you're the boss



</l>
<l>Talking about dancing

</l>
<l>And down home romancing

</l>
<l>Daddy, you make me scream

</l>
<l>Talking about dancing

</l>
<l>And down home romancing

</l>
<l>Baby, you're the queen

</l>
<l>Man, when push comes to shove

</l>
<l>When it comes down to love

</l>
<l>You're a horse

</l>
<l>But in the middle of the night

</l>
<l>When the moon is shining bright

</l>
<l>You're the boss



</l>
<l>You're the best of everything

</l>
<l>You're a peach

</l>
<l>You're so sweet

</l>
<l>You're a diamond

</l>
<l>You're the gem

</l>
<l>You're the best of everything

</l>
<l>Daddy, you're my man

</l>
<l>Baby, you're my girl



</l>
<l>When it comes to knowing

</l>
<l>Which way the wind is blowing

</l>
<l>Baby, you're so wise

</l>
<l>And when it comes to knowing

</l>
<l>Which way the wind is blowing

</l>
<l>Daddy, Lord, you take the prize

</l>
<l>Baby, you're the best

</l>
<l>When it comes to cooking up

</l>
<l>Some chili sauce

</l>
<l>Yeah, but in the middle of the night

</l>
<l>When the moon is shining bright

</l>
<l>B.B., you're the boss

</l>
<l>You're the boss

</l>
<l>You're the boss

</l>
<l>You're the boss

</l>
<l>You're the boss



</l>
<l>Yes, you're the boss, baby

</l>
<l>You pay the cost

</l>
<l>Well, yes, I do, but -

</l>
<l>Keep on running

</l>
<l>You're running slower than you used to

</l>
<l>But you're still the boss

</l>
<l>I'm getting a little old, baby

</l>
<l>Take it easy now

</l>
<l>Getting better looking everyday

</l>
<l>Oh yeah, I know that, I know that

</l>
<l>B.B.!

</l>
<l>Yes, that's me

</l>
<l>Belongs to Brown

</l>
<l>Hey, hey

</l>
<l>Remember what I told you all them years I'd catch you?

</l>
<l>Yeah

</l>
<l>You slowed down a little bit. Look out, I'm almost closed off

</l>
<l>I'm closing in, I'm closing in

</l>
<l>Come here, baby

</l>
<l>Give me a little time

</l>
<l>B.B. Oh, brown and beautiful

</l>
<l>Yes, yes, that's me

</l>
<l>I didn't make my move too soon, did I?

</l>
<l>Not yet, but just take it easy on me now

</l>
<l>Is the thrill gone?

</l>
<l>Not yet, baby, not yet!

</l>
<l>Oh Lord, baby

</l>
<l>I think that you never treated me mean

</l>
<l>That's why I keep coming back for more

</l>
<l>Go back to the source, baby

</l>
<l>I hear you, I hear you

</l>
<l>Oh baby, they didn't name you B.B. for nothing

</l>
<l>You pay the cost?

</l>
<l>Yes, I do

</l>
<l>And I always come back to the boss

</l>
<l>Come on to me. Come on to me

</l>
<l>Baby, you're the boss

</l>
<l>Yes

</l>
<l>Always was my horse

</l>
<l>Now talk to me, talk to me

</l>
<l>Oh, you sure you named that guitar right?

</l>
<l>Yes, I did

</l>
<l>Should have been called "Ruth", I know
