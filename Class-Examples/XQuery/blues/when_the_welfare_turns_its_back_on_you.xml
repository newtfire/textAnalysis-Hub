<lyrics>



Now what you gonna do, when the welfare turn it's back on you?

Now what you gonna do-hoo-hoo-hoo, when the welfare turn it's back on
you

Now, you be standin' there stranded, there's ain't a thing that you
can do



Now you look all through your house, yes, you can't, find a piece of
bread

Now you look all through your hou-hou-house, yeah, you can't find a
piece of bread

Sometime you begin to wonder, if you be better off, better off,
dead



You go down to the welfare

Give 'em one, two report

Something they sellin' you

Will surely get your goat



If you tell 'em you sick

You better have a bad cough

'Cause if you don't

They be ready to throw you off



What you gonna do, when the welfare turns it's back on you?

You be standin' there stranded,

There ain't a thing, there ain't a thing you

There ain't a thing-hing-hing-hing-hing,

that you can do
