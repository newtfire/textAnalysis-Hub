<lyrics>


<l>Now what you gonna do, when the welfare turn it's back on you?

</l>
<l>Now what you gonna do-hoo-hoo-hoo, when the welfare turn it's back on
you

</l>
<l>Now, you be standin' there stranded, there's ain't a thing that you

can do




</l>
<l>Now you look all through your house, yes, you can't, find a piece of
bread

</l>
<l>Now you look all through your hou-hou-house, yeah, you can't find a
piece of bread

</l>
<l>Sometime you begin to wonder, if you be better off, better off,

dead




</l>
<l>You go down to the welfare

</l>
<l>Give 'em one, two report

</l>
<l>Something they sellin' you

</l>
<l>Will surely get your goat



</l>
<l>If you tell 'em you sick

</l>
<l>You better have a bad cough

</l>
<l>'Cause if you don't

</l>
<l>They be ready to throw you off



</l>
<l>What you gonna do, when the welfare turns it's back on you?

</l>
<l>You be standin' there stranded,

</l>
<l>There ain't a thing, there ain't a thing you

</l>
<l>There ain't a thing-hing-hing-hing-hing,

</l><l>that you can do</l></lyrics></xml>
