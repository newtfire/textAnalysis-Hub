<lyrics>


<l>There's a change in your loving

</l>
<l>Strange kind of loving

</l>
<l>A change in your loving

</l>
<l>You are cold to the touch

</l>
<l>Change in your loving

</l>
<l>Strange kind of loving, baby

</l>
<l>A change in your loving

</l>
<l>Once you loved me so much



</l>
<l>You started a fire

</l>
<l>Inside of me

</l>
<l>My burning hot body

</l>
<l>Was a hundred and three

</l>
<l>But lately I'm feeling

</l>
<l>A drop in temperature

</l>
<l>You're cooling down, baby

</l>
<l>And I'm begging for more



</l>
<l>There's a change in your loving

</l>
<l>Strange kind of loving

</l>
<l>A change in your loving

</l>
<l>You are cold to the touch

</l>
<l>Change in your loving

</l>
<l>Strange kind of loving, baby

</l>
<l>A change in your loving

</l>
<l>Once you loved me so much



</l>
<l>With you I was feeling

</l>
<l>So secure

</l>
<l>When I was down and had the blues

</l>
<l>You had the cure

</l>
<l>Now things are so different

</l>
<l>But I believe I understand

</l>
<l>I may be sharing your lips

</l>
<l>With another man



</l>
<l>Change in your loving

</l>
<l>Strange kind of loving



</l>
<l>A change in your loving

</l>
<l>You are cold to the touch

</l>
<l>There's a change in your loving

</l>
<l>Strange kind of loving, baby

</l>
<l>A change in your loving

</l>
<l>Once you loved me so much



</l>
<l>A change in your loving

</l>
<l>A change in your loving</l></lyrics></xml>
