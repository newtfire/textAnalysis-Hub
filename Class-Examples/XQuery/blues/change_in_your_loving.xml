<lyrics>



There's a change in your loving

Strange kind of loving

A change in your loving

You are cold to the touch

Change in your loving

Strange kind of loving, baby

A change in your loving

Once you loved me so much



You started a fire

Inside of me

My burning hot body

Was a hundred and three

But lately I'm feeling

A drop in temperature

You're cooling down, baby

And I'm begging for more



There's a change in your loving

Strange kind of loving

A change in your loving

You are cold to the touch

Change in your loving

Strange kind of loving, baby

A change in your loving

Once you loved me so much



With you I was feeling

So secure

When I was down and had the blues

You had the cure

Now things are so different

But I believe I understand

I may be sharing your lips

With another man



Change in your loving

Strange kind of loving



A change in your loving

You are cold to the touch

There's a change in your loving

Strange kind of loving, baby

A change in your loving

Once you loved me so much



A change in your loving

A change in your loving
