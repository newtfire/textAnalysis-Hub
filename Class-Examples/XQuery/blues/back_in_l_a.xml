<lyrics>



From Hollywood and Vine

To the Sunset Strip

There's so much going on

You can lose your grip

From early in the morning

Until late at night

They'll do you so wrong

They'll do you so right



Back in L.A.

Waiting for the sun to shine

Back in L.A.

Living down a life of crime

Back in L.A.

Working on another line

Back in L.A.

To pick up the dime

You must do the time



From way up in the canyons

Where the hot winds howl

To the mean city streets

Where the night hawks prowl

I can feel the rhythm play

The whole night long

Guess I'll stay in L.A.

And listen to this song



Back in L.A.

Waiting for the sun to shine

Back in L.A.

Living down a life of crime

Back in L.A.

Working on another line

Back in L.A.

To pick up the dime

You must do the time



You must do the time
