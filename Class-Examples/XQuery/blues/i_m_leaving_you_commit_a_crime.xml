<lyrics>


<l>I'm leavin' you woman, before I commit some crime

</l>
<l>I'm leavin' you woman, before I commit a crime

</l>
<l>You the evilest woman, I think ever crossed my mind



</l>
<l>You put poison in my coffee, instead of milk or cream

</l>
<l>You poison my coffee, in with that milk and cream

</l>
<l>You're the meanest woman, I think I've most ever seen



</l>
<l>You mix my drink, with a can of Red Devil lye

</l>
<l>You mix my drink, with a can of Red Devil lye

</l>
<l>Then you sit right down, watchin' me, hopin' I might die



</l>
<l>You better be watchin' me baby, baby it was not my time

</l>
<l>You better be watchin' me baby, just might be your time</l></lyrics></xml>
