<lyrics>



I'm leavin' you woman, before I commit some crime

I'm leavin' you woman, before I commit a crime

You the evilest woman, I think ever crossed my mind



You put poison in my coffee, instead of milk or cream

You poison my coffee, in with that milk and cream

You're the meanest woman, I think I've most ever seen



You mix my drink, with a can of Red Devil lye

You mix my drink, with a can of Red Devil lye

Then you sit right down, watchin' me, hopin' I might die



You better be watchin' me baby, baby it was not my time

You better be watchin' me baby, just might be your time
