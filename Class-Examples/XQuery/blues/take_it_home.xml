<lyrics>



Way down South there's a clear stream running

In the night I feel my heart turning

I'm feeling some day I'd like to come

Back to the place I started from

Take it home



Country night with the stars above me

Way down there with the ones who love me

Mother, Sister, Father, Son

They mean more than anyone

Take it home



Fall winds blow and the red leaves falling

Don't know there's a voice keeps calling

Saying, you have found your song

You've been gone so long

Take it home



Seems my life is a long road winding

Gone so far but the ties are binding

I'll pack up my bags and fly away

To a far better day

Take it home



Don't know why I was made to wander

I've seen the light, lord I've felt the thunder

Someday I'll go home again

And I know they'll take me in

Take it home
