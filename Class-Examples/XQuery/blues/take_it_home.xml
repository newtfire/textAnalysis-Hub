<lyrics>


<l>Way down South there's a clear stream running

</l>
<l>In the night I feel my heart turning

</l>
<l>I'm feeling some day I'd like to come

</l>
<l>Back to the place I started from

</l>
<l>Take it home



</l>
<l>Country night with the stars above me

</l>
<l>Way down there with the ones who love me

</l>
<l>Mother, Sister, Father, Son

</l>
<l>They mean more than anyone

</l>
<l>Take it home



</l>
<l>Fall winds blow and the red leaves falling

</l>
<l>Don't know there's a voice keeps calling

</l>
<l>Saying, you have found your song

</l>
<l>You've been gone so long

</l>
<l>Take it home



</l>
<l>Seems my life is a long road winding

</l>
<l>Gone so far but the ties are binding

</l>
<l>I'll pack up my bags and fly away

</l>
<l>To a far better day

</l>
<l>Take it home



</l>
<l>Don't know why I was made to wander

</l>
<l>I've seen the light, lord I've felt the thunder

</l>
<l>Someday I'll go home again

</l>
<l>And I know they'll take me in

</l><l>Take it home</l></lyrics></xml>
