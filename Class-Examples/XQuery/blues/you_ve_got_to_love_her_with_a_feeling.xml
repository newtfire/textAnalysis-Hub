<lyrics>


<l>Now if you wanna love that woman

</l>
<l>You love her with a thrill

</l>
<l>'Cause a if you don't, a some other man will



</l>
<l>You've got to love her with a feeling

</l>
<l>You've got to love her with a feeling

</l>
<l>Love her with a feeling, man

</l>
<l>Or don't you love at all



</l>
<l>She shakes all over a when she walks

</l>
<l>She made a blind man see

</l>
<l>She made a dumb man talk



</l>
<l>You know she love me with a feeling

</l>
<l>A love me with a feeling

</l>
<l>Love me with a feeling baby

</l>
<l>Or don't you love at all



</l>
<l>The cops took her in

</l>
<l>How that woman didn't need no bail

</l>
<l>How she wiggled one time for the judge

</l>
<l>And the judge put the, cops in jail



</l>
<l>You know you love me with a feeling

</l>
<l>A love me with a feeling

</l>
<l>Love me with a feeling, baby

</l>
<l>Or don't you love at all



</l>
