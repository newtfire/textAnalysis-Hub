<lyrics>



Now if you wanna love that woman

You love her with a thrill

'Cause a if you don't, a some other man will



You've got to love her with a feeling

You've got to love her with a feeling

Love her with a feeling, man

Or don't you love at all



She shakes all over a when she walks

She made a blind man see

She made a dumb man talk



You know she love me with a feeling

A love me with a feeling

Love me with a feeling baby

Or don't you love at all



The cops took her in

How that woman didn't need no bail

How she wiggled one time for the judge

And the judge put the, cops in jail



You know you love me with a feeling

A love me with a feeling

Love me with a feeling, baby

Or don't you love at all
