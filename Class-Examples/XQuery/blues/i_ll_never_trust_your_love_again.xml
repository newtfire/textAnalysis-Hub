<l>I'll never, trust your love again

</l>
<l>I'll never, never, trust your love again

</l>
<l>You broke my heart in two baby

</l>
<l>I'll never trust your love again



</l>
<l>Seven days a week I worked for you baby, I gave you all I could
afford

</l>
<l>Seven days a week I worked for you, I gave you all I could afford

</l>
<l>I'd come home in the evening time, all you did was fuss and fight



</l>
<l>Baby



</l>
<l>I know I'll never, I'll never be the same no more

</l>
<l>Never never, be the same no more

</l>
<l>You keep me worried and bothered baby, and troubled all the time

</l>
<l>I'm gonna leave</l></lyrics></xml>
