<lyrics>



Elevate me mama, mama five or six floors all down

Elevate me mama, mama five or six floors all down

Ah you know everybody tell me, you must be the elevatin' woman in
town



Well you know when you start to elevate me

You almost scared me to death

You elevate me so fast

I've to stop and catch my breath

Elevate me mama, mama five or six floors all down

Ah you know everybody tells me, you 'bout the elevatin' woman in
town



Well you know I went to your apartment last night

You had your elevator runnin' slow

You know I gave you a buzz

I went to take you up on the fourteenth floor

Elevate me mama, mama five or six floors on down

Well you know everybody tells me, you must be the elevatin' woman in
town
