<lyrics>


<l>Elevate me mama, mama five or six floors all down

</l>
<l>Elevate me mama, mama five or six floors all down

</l>
<l>Ah you know everybody tell me, you must be the elevatin' woman in

town




</l>
<l>Well you know when you start to elevate me

</l>
<l>You almost scared me to death

</l>
<l>You elevate me so fast

</l>
<l>I've to stop and catch my breath

</l>
<l>Elevate me mama, mama five or six floors all down

</l>
<l>Ah you know everybody tells me, you 'bout the elevatin' woman in

town




</l>
<l>Well you know I went to your apartment last night

</l>
<l>You had your elevator runnin' slow

</l>
<l>You know I gave you a buzz

</l>
<l>I went to take you up on the fourteenth floor

</l>
<l>Elevate me mama, mama five or six floors on down

</l><l>Well you know everybody tells me, you must be the elevatin' woman in</l>
<l>town</l></lyrics></xml>
