<lyrics>


<l>Captain, tell your men to get on board

</l>
<l>Hoist your sail, just pull into another shore



</l>
<l>I'm dreary in mind and I'm so worried in heart

</l>
<l>Oh the best of friends sho' has got to part



</l>
<l>Blow your whistle captain, so your men'll know what to do

</l>
<l>Blow your whistle captain, so your men'll know what to do

</l>
<l>When a woman gets dreary ain't no tellin' what she won't do



</l>
<l>It's cloudy outdoors as can be

</l>
<l>Oh it's cloudy as can be

</l>
<l>That's the time I need my good man with me



</l>
<l>It's rainin' and it's stormin' on the sea

</l>
<l>It's rainin', it's stormin' on the sea

</l>
<l>I feel like somebody has shipwrecked poor me</l></lyrics></xml>
