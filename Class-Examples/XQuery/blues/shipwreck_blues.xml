<lyrics>



Captain, tell your men to get on board

Hoist your sail, just pull into another shore



I'm dreary in mind and I'm so worried in heart

Oh the best of friends sho' has got to part



Blow your whistle captain, so your men'll know what to do

Blow your whistle captain, so your men'll know what to do

When a woman gets dreary ain't no tellin' what she won't do



It's cloudy outdoors as can be

Oh it's cloudy as can be

That's the time I need my good man with me



It's rainin' and it's stormin' on the sea

It's rainin', it's stormin' on the sea

I feel like somebody has shipwrecked poor me
