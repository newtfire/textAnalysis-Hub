<lyrics>


<l>You've got yearnin' and I got burnin'

</l>
<l>Baby you look so sweet and cunning

</l>
<l>Baby way down inside, woman you need love

</l>
<l>Woman you need love, you've got to have some love

</l>
<l>I'm gonna give you some love, I know you need love

</l>
<l>You just gotta have love, you make me feel so good

</l>
<l>You make me feel all right, you're so nice, you're so nice



</l>
<l>You're frettin', and I'm petting

</l>
<l>A lot of good things you ain't getting

</l>
<l>Baby, way down inside, you need love



</l>
<l>You need to be hugged and squeezed real tight,

</l>
<l>by the light of the moon on some summer night

</l>
<l>You need love and kissing too,

</l>
<l>all these things are good for you



</l>
<l>I ain't foolin' you need schoolin'

</l>
<l>Baby you know you need coolin'

</l>
<l>Baby, way down inside, woman you need love</l></lyrics></xml>
