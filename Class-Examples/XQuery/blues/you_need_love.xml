<lyrics>



You've got yearnin' and I got burnin'

Baby you look so sweet and cunning

Baby way down inside, woman you need love

Woman you need love, you've got to have some love

I'm gonna give you some love, I know you need love

You just gotta have love, you make me feel so good

You make me feel all right, you're so nice, you're so nice



You're frettin', and I'm petting

A lot of good things you ain't getting

Baby, way down inside, you need love



You need to be hugged and squeezed real tight,

by the light of the moon on some summer night

You need love and kissing too,

all these things are good for you



I ain't foolin' you need schoolin'

Baby you know you need coolin'

Baby, way down inside, woman you need love
