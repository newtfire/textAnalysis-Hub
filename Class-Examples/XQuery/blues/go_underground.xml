<lyrics>



Yes, you thought

You had a good thing, baby

You could do what you wanted to do

Yes, but you'd better

Find you another thing, baby

Because this thing

Is cutting out on you

I'm tired of you putting me down

I think I'll do like a mole

And move underground



I tried to do

Everything for you, baby

Tried to give you everything

Even the stars above

Oh but you wanted someone

To play with, baby

And I needed me someone to love

I say I'm tired of you

Putting me down

I think I'll do like a mole

And move underground



Yes, I can't be a winner, baby

Because I was born to lose

I go to bed every night

With troubles, baby

Because I wake up

Thinking about you

I'm tired of you

Putting me down, baby

I think I'm gonna do like a mole

And move underground



Oh I paid the cost, baby

I even sing the blues

I've done everything to please you

And I'm tired of paying my dues

And I'm tired of you

Putting me down

That's why I'm gonna do like a mole

And move underground
