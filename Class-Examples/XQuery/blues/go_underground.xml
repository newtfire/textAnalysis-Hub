<lyrics>


<l>Yes, you thought

</l>
<l>You had a good thing, baby

</l>
<l>You could do what you wanted to do

</l>
<l>Yes, but you'd better

</l>
<l>Find you another thing, baby

</l>
<l>Because this thing

</l>
<l>Is cutting out on you

</l>
<l>I'm tired of you putting me down

</l>
<l>I think I'll do like a mole

</l>
<l>And move underground



</l>
<l>I tried to do

</l>
<l>Everything for you, baby

</l>
<l>Tried to give you everything

</l>
<l>Even the stars above

</l>
<l>Oh but you wanted someone

</l>
<l>To play with, baby

</l>
<l>And I needed me someone to love

</l>
<l>I say I'm tired of you

</l>
<l>Putting me down

</l>
<l>I think I'll do like a mole

</l>
<l>And move underground



</l>
<l>Yes, I can't be a winner, baby

</l>
<l>Because I was born to lose

</l>
<l>I go to bed every night

</l>
<l>With troubles, baby

</l>
<l>Because I wake up

</l>
<l>Thinking about you

</l>
<l>I'm tired of you

</l>
<l>Putting me down, baby

</l>
<l>I think I'm gonna do like a mole

</l>
<l>And move underground



</l>
<l>Oh I paid the cost, baby

</l>
<l>I even sing the blues

</l>
<l>I've done everything to please you

</l>
<l>And I'm tired of paying my dues

</l>
<l>And I'm tired of you

</l>
<l>Putting me down

</l>
<l>That's why I'm gonna do like a mole

</l>
<l>And move underground</l></lyrics></xml>
