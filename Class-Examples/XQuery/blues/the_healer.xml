<lyrics>



Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm

Hmm, oh Lord, Lord

Hmm, hmm, hmm

hmm, hmm

Hmm, hmm, hmm



Blues a healer, all over the world

Blues a healer, healer, all over the world, all over the world

It healed me, it can heal you

The blues can heal you, early one morning

It can heal you

The blues can heal you

Yeah, yeah

It healed me, healed me

It healed me

I was down

I was down

It healed me

Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, yes it did, yes it did

Look now

My woman left me

The blues healed me

My woman left me, left me early one morning

Hmm, hmm

The blues healed me, it healed me, healed me

Yeah, yeah!

Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord

Hmm, have mercy

The blues , the blues is a healer

Blues, blues, is a healing healer

it healed, healed, healed

Heal!

Heal, heal, heal!

All over the world, all over the world

It's a healer



One night, I was laying down, feeling so bad, so low, so low

My woman had left me, blues came along and healed me

Heal!

Heal!

(Carlos, it healed me, Carlos)

Carlos!

It healed me!

The blues, it healed , it healed, healer

Hey!

Hey!

Healed me!

Healed me!

Healer!

Hey!

Blues a healer

The blues a healer, all over the world, all over the world

Hmm



Lord, Lord, Lord

Blues a healer, all over the world, all over the world

Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord

Healed me, healed, healed, healed

It healed me

It healed me, to heal me

Can heal you, can heal you, heal you, if you let it
