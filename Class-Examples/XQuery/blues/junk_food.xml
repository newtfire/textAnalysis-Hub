<lyrics>


<l>Ridin' down a highway in my ragged Greyhound bus

</l>
<l>Wanted to buy me some food but my money didn't have enough

</l>
<l>No time for foolin' around I had to go an' do a show

</l>
<l>So I edged it off the highway at a 7-11 store



</l>
<l>I bought junk food

</l>
<l>I bought me some junk food

</l>
<l>I bought some junk food

</l>
<l>I bought some junk food

</l>
<l>I bought me some junk food, junk food

</l>
<l>Lord, Lord, Lord



</l>
<l>I bought a long hot dog

</l>
<l>Wasn't no steak dinner but I ate just the same

</l>
<l>Wasn't no hamburger, I didn't stop at Burger King

</l>
<l>It wasn't no Fat Mac, and it wasn't no barbecue

</l>
<l>It wasn't no collard greens, I tell ya but plain old junk food



</l>
<l>I was eatin' junk food

</l>
<l>I was eatin' this junk food

</l>
<l>I was eatin' some junk food

</l>
<l>I was eatin' this junk food

</l>
<l>I was eatin' junk food, junk food

</l>
<l>Lord, Lord, Lord



</l>
<l>I ate a foot long dog



</l>
<l>I hate this junk food

</l>
<l>It's bad for my health

</l>
<l>But I'm playin' these lousy blues

</l>
<l>An' I can't afford nothin' else

</l>
<l>Never made too much money

</l>
<l>So that's all I've got to eat

</l>
<l>Them Polish hot dog and I buy 'em on Maxwell Street

</l>
<l>Got to eat junk food

</l>
<l>I got to eat junk food

</l>
<l>I got to eat junk food

</l>
<l>I got to eat junk food

</l>
<l>I got to eat junk food, junk food

</l>
<l>Woo Woo Wee



</l>
<l>Talkin' 'bout bologna an' cheese

</l>
<l>I've got to eat junk food



</l>
<l>I've got to eat junk food

</l>
<l>I've got to eat junk food

</l>
<l>I've got to eat junk food

</l>
<l>I've got to eat junk food

</l>
<l>I've got to eat junk food

</l>
<l>I've got to eat junk food

</l>
<l>I've got to eat junk food
