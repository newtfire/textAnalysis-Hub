<lyrics>



Ridin' down a highway in my ragged Greyhound bus

Wanted to buy me some food but my money didn't have enough

No time for foolin' around I had to go an' do a show

So I edged it off the highway at a 7-11 store



I bought junk food

I bought me some junk food

I bought some junk food

I bought some junk food

I bought me some junk food, junk food

Lord, Lord, Lord



I bought a long hot dog

Wasn't no steak dinner but I ate just the same

Wasn't no hamburger, I didn't stop at Burger King

It wasn't no Fat Mac, and it wasn't no barbecue

It wasn't no collard greens, I tell ya but plain old junk food



I was eatin' junk food

I was eatin' this junk food

I was eatin' some junk food

I was eatin' this junk food

I was eatin' junk food, junk food

Lord, Lord, Lord



I ate a foot long dog



I hate this junk food

It's bad for my health

But I'm playin' these lousy blues

An' I can't afford nothin' else

Never made too much money

So that's all I've got to eat

Them Polish hot dog and I buy 'em on Maxwell Street
1



Got to eat junk food

I got to eat junk food

I got to eat junk food

I got to eat junk food

I got to eat junk food, junk food

Woo Woo Wee



Talkin' 'bout bologna an' cheese

I've got to eat junk food



I've got to eat junk food

I've got to eat junk food

I've got to eat junk food

I've got to eat junk food

I've got to eat junk food

I've got to eat junk food

I've got to eat junk food
