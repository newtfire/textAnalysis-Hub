<lyrics>


<l>When I tiptoe to the house, high as a kite

</l>
<l>I'd rather face a tiger than to face my wife

</l>
<l>She's the no sleepin'est woman I ever did see

</l>
<l>When I hit the doorstep she knows it's me



</l>
<l>With my shoes in my hand, I'm careful too

</l>
<l>It makes no difference, it's "honey, is that you?"

</l>
<l>She's the no sleepin'est woman I ever did see

</l>
<l>When I hit the doorstep she knows it's me



</l>
<l>Well I like to play around sometime with my friend

</l>
<l>But when I go home I'm afraid to go in

</l>
<l>She thinks my head is a rubber ball

</l>
<l>It's the same old story from summer to fall



</l>
<l>She knows I'm sick, and a little tight

</l>
<l>But I gotta prepare for a all night fight

</l>
<l>She's the no sleepin'est woman I ever did see

</l>
<l>When I hit the doorstep she knows it's me



</l>
<l>Well I like to play around sometime with my friend

</l>
<l>But when I go home I'm afraid to go in

</l>
<l>She thinks my head is a rubber ball

</l>
<l>It's the same old story from summer to fall



</l>
<l>She knows I'm sick, and a little tight

</l>
<l>But I gotta prepare for a all night fight

</l>
<l>She's the no sleepin'est woman I ever did see

</l>
<l>When I hit the doorstep she knows it's me



</l>
<l>She's the no sleepin'est woman I ever did see

</l>
<l>I give her some pills and she trick poor me

</l><l>No sleepin'est woman that I ever did see</l></lyrics></xml>
