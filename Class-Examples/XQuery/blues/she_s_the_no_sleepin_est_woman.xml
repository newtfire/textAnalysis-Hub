<lyrics>



When I tiptoe to the house, high as a kite

I'd rather face a tiger than to face my wife

She's the no sleepin'est woman I ever did see

When I hit the doorstep she knows it's me



With my shoes in my hand, I'm careful too

It makes no difference, it's "honey, is that you?"

She's the no sleepin'est woman I ever did see

When I hit the doorstep she knows it's me



Well I like to play around sometime with my friend

But when I go home I'm afraid to go in

She thinks my head is a rubber ball

It's the same old story from summer to fall



She knows I'm sick, and a little tight

But I gotta prepare for a all night fight

She's the no sleepin'est woman I ever did see

When I hit the doorstep she knows it's me



Well I like to play around sometime with my friend

But when I go home I'm afraid to go in

She thinks my head is a rubber ball

It's the same old story from summer to fall



She knows I'm sick, and a little tight

But I gotta prepare for a all night fight

She's the no sleepin'est woman I ever did see

When I hit the doorstep she knows it's me



She's the no sleepin'est woman I ever did see

I give her some pills and she trick poor me

No sleepin'est woman that I ever did see
