<lyrics>



Did you ever fall in love with a man that was no good?

Did you ever fall in love with a man that was no good?

No matter what you did for him, he never understood



The meanest thing he could say would thrill you through and
through

The meanest thing he could say would thrill you through and
through

And there wasn't nothin' too dirty for that man to do



He'd treat you nice and kind till he win your heart and hand

He'd treat you nice and kind till he win your heart and hand

Then he git so cruel that man, you just could not stand



Lawd, I really don't think no man's love can last

Lawd, I don't think no man's love can last

They'll love you to death then treat you like a thing of the past



There's nineteen men livin' in my neighborhood

There's nineteen men livin' in my neighborhood

Eighteen of them are fools and the one ain't no 
doggone

good



Lawd, Lawd, Lawd, Lawd, Lawd, Lawd, Lawd

Lawd, Lawd, Lawd, Lawd, Lawd

That dirty no-good man treats me just like I'm a dog
