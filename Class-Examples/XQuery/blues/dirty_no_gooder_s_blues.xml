<l>Did you ever fall in love with a man that was no good?

</l>
<l>Did you ever fall in love with a man that was no good?

</l>
<l>No matter what you did for him, he never understood



</l>
<l>The meanest thing he could say would thrill you through and
through

</l>
<l>The meanest thing he could say would thrill you through and
through

</l>
<l>And there wasn't nothin' too dirty for that man to do



</l>
<l>He'd treat you nice and kind till he win your heart and hand

</l>
<l>He'd treat you nice and kind till he win your heart and hand

</l>
<l>Then he git so cruel that man, you just could not stand



</l>
<l>Lawd, I really don't think no man's love can last

</l>
<l>Lawd, I don't think no man's love can last

</l>
<l>They'll love you to death then treat you like a thing of the past



</l>
<l>There's nineteen men livin' in my neighborhood

</l>
<l>There's nineteen men livin' in my neighborhood

</l>
<l>Eighteen of them are fools and the one ain't no 
doggone

</l>
<l>good



</l>
<l>Lawd, Lawd, Lawd, Lawd, Lawd, Lawd, Lawd

</l>
<l>Lawd, Lawd, Lawd, Lawd, Lawd

</l><l>That dirty no-good man treats me just like I'm a dog</l></lyrics></xml>
