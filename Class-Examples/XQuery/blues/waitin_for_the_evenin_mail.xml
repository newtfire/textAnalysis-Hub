Passing by the jail this morn'

Heard a hard luck brother mourn

I'm in here, right where I don't belong

I never did no wrong

As I passed by his window

I could hear him moaning his song



Sitting on the inside, looking at the outside

Waitin' for that evenin' mail

Four walls and a ceiling

Lordy, what a feeling

Just the mean old lowdown jail

Separating me from everything but that evenin' mail



I wrote my onetime baby down in Jacksonville

Hey sweet baby, I'm in jail

Baby please don't fail me

Hurry up and mail me bail

That's just a year ago today and I'm

Still on the inside, looking at the outside

Waitin' for that evenin' mail



And I'm still on the inside, looking at the outside

Waitin' for that evenin' mail
