</l>
<l>Passing by the jail this morn'

</l>
<l>Heard a hard luck brother mourn

</l>
<l>I'm in here, right where I don't belong

</l>
<l>I never did no wrong

</l>
<l>As I passed by his window

</l>
<l>I could hear him moaning his song



</l>
<l>Sitting on the inside, looking at the outside

</l>
<l>Waitin' for that evenin' mail

</l>
<l>Four walls and a ceiling

</l>
<l>Lordy, what a feeling

</l>
<l>Just the mean old lowdown jail

</l>
<l>Separating me from everything but that evenin' mail



</l>
<l>I wrote my onetime baby down in Jacksonville

</l>
<l>Hey sweet baby, I'm in jail

</l>
<l>Baby please don't fail me

</l>
<l>Hurry up and mail me bail

</l>
<l>That's just a year ago today and I'm

</l>
<l>Still on the inside, looking at the outside

</l>
<l>Waitin' for that evenin' mail



</l>
<l>And I'm still on the inside, looking at the outside

</l>
<l>Waitin' for that evenin' mail</l></lyrics></xml>
