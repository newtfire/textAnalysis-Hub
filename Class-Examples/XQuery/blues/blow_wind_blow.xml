<lyrics>



Yeah when the sun rose this mornin', I didn#180;t have my
baby by my side

Well when the sun rose this mornin', I didn#180;t have my woman by
my side

Well I didn#180;t know where she was, she's out with another guy



And don't the sun look lonesome? She headed down the highway

Ya know the sun looks so lonesome, settin' down behind the trees

Well don't the heart look lonesome? When your baby find someone
else



Well blow wind, blow wind, blow my baby back to me

Yeah, blow wind, blow wind, blow my baby back to me

Well you know if I don't soon find my pine top, my heart's gonna be
in misery



Well goodbye bab-ay, I ain't got no more to say

Yeah, goodbye, goodbye, I ain't got no more to say

Well you know, I know you don't love me, go ahead and have your
way
