<lyrics>


<l>Yeah when the sun rose this mornin', I didn#180;t have my
baby by my side

</l>
<l>Well when the sun rose this mornin', I didn#180;t have my woman by
my side

</l>
<l>Well I didn#180;t know where she was, she's out with another guy



</l>
<l>And don't the sun look lonesome? She headed down the highway

</l>
<l>Ya know the sun looks so lonesome, settin' down behind the trees

</l>
<l>Well don't the heart look lonesome? When your baby find someone

else




</l>
<l>Well blow wind, blow wind, blow my baby back to me

</l>
<l>Yeah, blow wind, blow wind, blow my baby back to me

</l>
<l>Well you know if I don't soon find my pine top, my heart's gonna be

in misery




</l>
<l>Well goodbye bab-ay, I ain't got no more to say

</l>
<l>Yeah, goodbye, goodbye, I ain't got no more to say

</l><l>Well you know, I know you don't love me, go ahead and have your</l>
<l>way</l></lyrics></xml>
