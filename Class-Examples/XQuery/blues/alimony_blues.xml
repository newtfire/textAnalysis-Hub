<lyrics>



It's a cold-blooded world when a man has to pawn his shoes

It's a cold-blooded world when a man has to pawn his shoes

That's the fix I'm in today, I swear I've been abused



Yes, the woman is a devil, she will trick you if she can

Yes, the woman is a devil, she will trick you if she can

She will tell you that she love you, an work out some other plan



Got those alimony blues an I sure got to pay some dues

Got those alimony blues an I sure got to pay some dues

And if I run short of cash, it's the road camp, I've got to
choose
