<l>It's a cold-blooded world when a man has to pawn his shoes

</l>
<l>It's a cold-blooded world when a man has to pawn his shoes

</l>
<l>That's the fix I'm in today, I swear I've been abused



</l>
<l>Yes, the woman is a devil, she will trick you if she can

</l>
<l>Yes, the woman is a devil, she will trick you if she can

</l>
<l>She will tell you that she love you, an work out some other plan



</l>
<l>Got those alimony blues an I sure got to pay some dues

</l>
<l>Got those alimony blues an I sure got to pay some dues

</l><l>And if I run short of cash, it's the road camp, I've got to</l>
<l>choose</l></lyrics></xml>
