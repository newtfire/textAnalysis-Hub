<lyrics>



I'm a poor, poor boy

But that don't worry me

Everybody knows that the best things in life are free



Well I go out make a little money

Spend it fast as I can

I'm gonna go out and have a good time,

raise some sand while I'm still a young man



I got all the girls I need

And a hotel over my head

One thing I know, baby, I got clean sheets on my bed



Well I ain't got no money

But, baby, I don't care

I'm gonna ride around this town in my new car lookin' like a
millionaire



Yes, I said I'm a poor, poor boy

But that don't worry me

Everybody knows that the best things in life are free
