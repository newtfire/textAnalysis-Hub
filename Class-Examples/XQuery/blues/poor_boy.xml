<lyrics>


<l>I'm a poor, poor boy

</l>
<l>But that don't worry me

</l>
<l>Everybody knows that the best things in life are free



</l>
<l>Well I go out make a little money

</l>
<l>Spend it fast as I can

</l>
<l>I'm gonna go out and have a good time,

</l>
<l>raise some sand while I'm still a young man



</l>
<l>I got all the girls I need

</l>
<l>And a hotel over my head

</l>
<l>One thing I know, baby, I got clean sheets on my bed



</l>
<l>Well I ain't got no money

</l>
<l>But, baby, I don't care

</l>
<l>I'm gonna ride around this town in my new car lookin' like a

millionaire




</l>
<l>Yes, I said I'm a poor, poor boy

</l>
<l>But that don't worry me

</l><l>Everybody knows that the best things in life are free</l></lyrics></xml>
