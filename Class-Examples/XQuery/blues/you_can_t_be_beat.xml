<l>Now go to sleep, go to sleep

</l>
<l>Go to sleep little darlin', go to sleep little darlin'

</l>
<l>Go to sleep little darlin', you know you can't be beat



</l>
<l>I'm in love with you, I'm in love with you

</l>
<l>I'm in love with you, I'm in love with you

</l>
<l>I'm in love with you baby, you know you look so fine



</l>
<l>I know, I know

</l>
<l>I know, yes I know

</l>
<l>I know little girl, you the prettiest little girl in town



</l>
<l>Don't you worry, don't you worry

</l>
<l>Don't you worry little darlin', don't you worry little darlin'

</l>
<l>Don't you worry little darlin', everything is all right



</l>
<l>Don't worry me, don't worry me

</l>
<l>Don't worry me, don't worry me

</l>
<l>Don't worry me boy I'm, talkin' to my baby now</l></lyrics></xml>
