<lyrics>



Now go to sleep, go to sleep

Go to sleep little darlin', go to sleep little darlin'

Go to sleep little darlin', you know you can't be beat



I'm in love with you, I'm in love with you

I'm in love with you, I'm in love with you

I'm in love with you baby, you know you look so fine



I know, I know

I know, yes I know

I know little girl, you the prettiest little girl in town



Don't you worry, don't you worry

Don't you worry little darlin', don't you worry little darlin'

Don't you worry little darlin', everything is all right



Don't worry me, don't worry me

Don't worry me, don't worry me

Don't worry me boy I'm, talkin' to my baby now
