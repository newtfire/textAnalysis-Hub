<lyrics>


<l>When you got a good friend, that will stay right by your
side.

</l>
<l>When you got a good friend, that will stay right by your side

</l>
<l>Give her all of your spare time, love and treat her right



</l>
<l>I mistreated my baby, and I can't see no reason why

</l>
<l>I mistreated my baby, but I can't see no reason why

</l>
<l>Everytime I think about it, I just wring my hands and cry



</l>
<l>Wonder could I bear apologize, or would she sympathize with me

</l>
<l>Mmmmmm mmmm mmmm, would she sympathize with me

</l>
<l>She's a brown skin woman, just as sweet as a girl friend can be



</l>
<l>Mmmm mmmm, babe, I may be right ay wrong

</l>
<l>Baby it's yo'y opinion, oh, I may be right ay wrong

</l>
<l>Watch your close friend, baby, then your ene'ies can't do no harm



</l>
<l>When you got a good friend, that will stay right by your side

</l>
<l>When you got a good friend, that will stay right by your side

</l>
<l>Give her all of your spare time, love and treat her right</l></lyrics></xml>
