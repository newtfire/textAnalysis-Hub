<lyrics>



When you got a good friend, that will stay right by your
side.

When you got a good friend, that will stay right by your side

Give her all of your spare time, love and treat her right



I mistreated my baby, and I can't see no reason why

I mistreated my baby, but I can't see no reason why

Everytime I think about it, I just wring my hands and cry



Wonder could I bear apologize, or would she sympathize with me

Mmmmmm mmmm mmmm, would she sympathize with me

She's a brown skin woman, just as sweet as a girl friend can be



Mmmm mmmm, babe, I may be right ay wrong

Baby it's yo'y opinion, oh, I may be right ay wrong

Watch your close friend, baby, then your ene'ies can't do no harm



When you got a good friend, that will stay right by your side

When you got a good friend, that will stay right by your side

Give her all of your spare time, love and treat her right
