<l>Oh, I had a woman, she was nice and loving to me in every way

</l>
<l>Oh, I had a woman, she was nice and loving to me in every way

</l>
<l>Oh, she used to love me, bring my breakfast to the bed everyday



</l>
<l>Oh, for ten long years, yes, she was my pride and joy

</l>
<l>Oh, for ten long years, she was my pride and joy

</l>
<l>Well, I used to call her my little girl and she used to call me her

little boy




</l>
<l>Well, it's all over, baby, baby, you know I'm all alone

</l>
<l>Well, it's all over, baby, baby, you know I'm all alone

</l>
<l>Well, the reason I sing these blues, yes, you know my baby's gone</l></lyrics></xml>
