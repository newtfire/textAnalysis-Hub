<lyrics>



I've gotten good at missin' her, I practice all the time

While I drive the Pan Am highway thru, with that cactus friend of
mine

It's gettin' hard to see the white line rollin' by, I can't forget
her memory deep inside



I dropped a bundle down in Panama, but the loss didn't do me no
good

Spendin' cash and talkin' trash, don't do it like it should

I realized I just couldn't buy her smile, I'll keep tryin' on that
Pan Am mile by mile



If she'd meet me in San Salvador, I'd buy her a drink or two

We'd talk about our used to be, and ride on to Peru

The time to get it right is here and now, if she won't I'll move on
anyhow
