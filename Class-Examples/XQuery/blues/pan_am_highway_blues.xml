<lyrics>


<l>I've gotten good at missin' her, I practice all the time

</l>
<l>While I drive the Pan Am highway thru, with that cactus friend of
mine

</l>
<l>It's gettin' hard to see the white line rollin' by, I can't forget

her memory deep inside




</l>
<l>I dropped a bundle down in Panama, but the loss didn't do me no
good

</l>
<l>Spendin' cash and talkin' trash, don't do it like it should

</l>
<l>I realized I just couldn't buy her smile, I'll keep tryin' on that

Pan Am mile by mile




</l>
<l>If she'd meet me in San Salvador, I'd buy her a drink or two

</l>
<l>We'd talk about our used to be, and ride on to Peru

</l><l>The time to get it right is here and now, if she won't I'll move on</l>
<l>anyhow</l></lyrics></xml>
