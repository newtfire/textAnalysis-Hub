<lyrics>

<l>I hate to see the ev'nin' sun go down

</l>
<l>Hate to see the ev'nin' sun go down,

</l>
<l>'cause my baby, he done left this town



</l>
<l>Feelin' tomorrow like I feel today

</l>
<l>Feel tomorrow like I feel today,

</l>
<l>I'll pack my trunk, make my getaway



</l>
<l>St. Louis woman with her diamond rings

</l>
<l>Pulls that man 'round by her apron strings,

</l>
<l>'t'want for powder and for store-bought hair



</l>
<l>The man I love, would not gone nowhere,

</l>
<l>got the St. Louis blues just as blue as I can be

</l>
<l>That man got a heart like a rock cast in the sea,

</l>
<l>or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me



</l>
<l>Been to the gypsy to get my fortune told

</l>
<l>To the gypsy, to get my fortune told,

</l>
<l>'cause I'm most wild about my 
jelly
roll



</l>
<l>Gypsy done told me, "Don't you wear no black"

</l>
<l>Yes, she done told me, "Don't you wear no black,

</l>
<l>go to St. Louis, you can win him back"



</l>
<l>Help me to Cairo, make St. Louis by myself

</l>
<l>Gone to Cairo, find my old friend Jeff

</l>
<l>Goin' to pin myself close to his side,

</l>
<l>if I 
flag his train
, I
sure can ride



</l>
<l>I love that man like a schoolboy loves his pie

</l>
<l>Like a Kentucky Colonel loves his mint and rye
1

</l>
<l>I'll love my baby till the day I die



</l>
<l>You ought to see that stovepipe brown of mine,

</l>
<l>like he owns the diamond Joseph line

</l>
<l>He'd make across-eyed old man go stone blind



</l>
<l>Blacker than midnight, teeth like flags of truce

</l>
<l>Blackest man in the whole St. Louis

</l>
<l>Blacker the berry, sweeter is the juice



</l>
<l>About a crap game, he knows a powerful lot,

</l>
<l>but when work time comes, he's on the dot

</l>
<l>Goin' to ask him for a cold ten spot,

</l>
<l>what it takes to get it, he's certainly got



</l>
<l>A black-headed gal make a freight train jump the track

</l>
<l>Said a black-headed gal make a freight train jump the track

</l>
<l>But a redheaded woman makes a preacher

</l>
<l>ball
the jack



</l>
