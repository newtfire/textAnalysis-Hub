<lyrics>



Down in Atlanta, GA, under the viaduct ev'ry day, drinking
corn and hollerin' hooray

Pianos playing till the break of day

But as I turned my head, I loudly said, "Preach 'em blues, sing them
blues"

They certainly sound good to me

I've been in love for the last six months and ain't done worrying
yet

Moan'em blues, holler them blues

Let me convert your soul

'Cause just a little spirit of the blues tonight

Let me tell you, girls, that your man ain't treating you right

Let me tell you I don't mean no wrong

I will learn you something if you listen to this song

I ain't here to try to save your soul, just want to teach you how to
save your good 
jelly
roll



Going on down the line a little further now

There's many a poor woman down

Read on down to chapter nine,

woman must learn how to take their time

Read on down to chapter ten,

taking other women's men, you are doing a sin

Sing'em, sing'em, sing them blues

Let me convert your soul

Now one sister by the name of Sister Green

jumped up and done a shimmy you ain't never seen

Sing'em, sing'em, sing them blues

Let me convert your soul
