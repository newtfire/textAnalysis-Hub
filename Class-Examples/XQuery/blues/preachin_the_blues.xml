<lyrics>


<l>Down in Atlanta, GA, under the viaduct ev'ry day, drinking corn and hollerin' hooray

</l>
<l>Pianos playing till the break of day

</l>
<l>But as I turned my head, I loudly said, "Preach 'em blues, sing them
blues"

</l>
<l>They certainly sound good to me

</l>
<l>I've been in love for the last six months and ain't done worrying
yet

</l>
<l>Moan'em blues, holler them blues

</l>
<l>Let me convert your soul

</l>
<l>'Cause just a little spirit of the blues tonight

</l>
<l>Let me tell you, girls, that your man ain't treating you right

</l>
<l>Let me tell you I don't mean no wrong

</l>
<l>I will learn you something if you listen to this song

</l>
<l>I ain't here to try to save your soul, just want to teach you how to

save your good jelly roll




</l>
<l>Going on down the line a little further now

</l>
<l>There's many a poor woman down

</l>
<l>Read on down to chapter nine,

</l>
<l>woman must learn how to take their time

</l>
<l>Read on down to chapter ten,

</l>
<l>taking other women's men, you are doing a sin

</l>
<l>Sing'em, sing'em, sing them blues

</l>
<l>Let me convert your soul

</l>
<l>Now one sister by the name of Sister Green

</l>
<l>jumped up and done a shimmy you ain't never seen

</l>
<l>Sing'em, sing'em, sing them blues

</l>
<l>Let me convert your soul</l></lyrics></xml>
