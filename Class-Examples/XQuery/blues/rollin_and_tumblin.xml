<l>Well, I rolled and I tumbled, cried the whole night long

</l>
<l>Well, I rolled and I tumbled, cried the whole night long

</l>
<l>Well, I woke up this mornin', didn't know right from wrong



</l>
<l>Well, I told my baby, before I left that town

</l>
<l>Well, I told my baby, before I left that town

</l>
<l>Well, don't you let nobody, tear my 
barrelhouse

</l>
<l>down



</l>
<l>Well, ahh, mmm-hmmm, owww, oww ooo, aww, oww, oh

</l>
<l>Aaa, mmm-hmmm, oww, oh oh oh owww, oww ooo, aww, oww, oh



</l>
<l>Well, if the river was whiskey, and I was a divin' duck

</l>
<l>Well, if the river was whiskey, and I was a divin' duck

</l>
<l>Well, I would dive to the bottom, never would I come up



</l>
<l>Well, I could a had a religion, this bad old thing instead

</l>
<l>Well, I could a had a religion, this bad old thing instead

</l>
