<lyrics>



Well, I rolled and I tumbled, cried the whole night long

Well, I rolled and I tumbled, cried the whole night long

Well, I woke up this mornin', didn't know right from wrong



Well, I told my baby, before I left that town

Well, I told my baby, before I left that town

Well, don't you let nobody, tear my 
barrelhouse

down



Well, ahh, mmm-hmmm, owww, oww ooo, aww, oww, oh

Aaa, mmm-hmmm, oww, oh oh oh owww, oww ooo, aww, oww, oh



Well, if the river was whiskey, and I was a divin' duck

Well, if the river was whiskey, and I was a divin' duck

Well, I would dive to the bottom, never would I come up



Well, I could a had a religion, this bad old thing instead

Well, I could a had a religion, this bad old thing instead

Well, all whiskey and women, would not let me pray
