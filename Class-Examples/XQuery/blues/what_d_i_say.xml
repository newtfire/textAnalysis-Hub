Tell your momma, tell your pa,

gonna move you back to Arkansas

All right, baby what'd I say?

Whoa, all right, baby what'd I say?



Oh baby, oh baby

All right, baby, what'd I say?

Baby, what'd I say?

Oh, all right, yeah



Baby, what'd I say?

Yeah, what'd I say?

Baby, what'd I say?

Baby, what'd I say?

Oh, what'd I say?

Baby, what'd I say?



Ah well, ah hey, yeah, yeah, yeah

Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

All right, baby
