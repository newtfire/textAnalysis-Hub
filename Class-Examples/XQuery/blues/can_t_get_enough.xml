<lyrics>


<l>I've been tossing and turning all night

</l>
<l>Staring into the darkness

</l>
<l>Afraid to turn on the light

</l>
<l>It's got nothing to do with money

</l>
<l>I just sure enough want you, honey

</l>
<l>And I just can't rest

</l>
<l>Till I get it right

</l>
<l>'Cause when the morning breeze

</l>
<l>Starts blowing

</l>
<l>That's when you hear me call your name

</l>
<l>That's when my love starts showing

</l>
<l>It's getting serious, baby

</l>
<l>End of the game



</l>
<l>'Cause I can't get enough of your love

</l>
<l>I said I can't get enough of your love

</l>
<l>I can't get enough of your love

</l>
<l>I said I can't get enough of your love



</l>
<l>You got me walking round in circles

</l>
<l>Yeah I'm always pacing the floor

</l>
<l>'Cause this life I'm living without you

</l>
<l>I just can't take no more



</l>
<l>When the morning breeze starts blowing

</l>
<l>I can hear you call my name

</l>
<l>That's when my love starts showing

</l>
<l>It's getting serious, baby

</l>
<l>End of the game



</l>
<l>'Cause I can't get enough of your love

</l>
<l>I said I can't get enough of your love

</l>
<l>I can't get enough of your love

</l>
<l>I said I can't get enough of your love



</l>
<l>'Cause when the morning breeze

</l>
<l>Starts blowing

</l>
<l>I can hear me call your name

</l>
<l>That's when my love starts showing

</l>
<l>It's getting serious, baby

</l>
<l>End of the game



</l>
<l>'Cause I can't get enough of your love

</l>
<l>I can't get enough of your love

</l>
<l>I said I can't get enough of your love

</l>
<l>I said I can't get enough of your love



</l>
<l>I can't get enough of your love</l></lyrics></xml>
