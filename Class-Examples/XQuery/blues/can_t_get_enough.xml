<lyrics>



I've been tossing and turning all night

Staring into the darkness

Afraid to turn on the light

It's got nothing to do with money

I just sure enough want you, honey

And I just can't rest

Till I get it right

'Cause when the morning breeze

Starts blowing

That's when you hear me call your name

That's when my love starts showing

It's getting serious, baby

End of the game



'Cause I can't get enough of your love

I said I can't get enough of your love

I can't get enough of your love

I said I can't get enough of your love



You got me walking round in circles

Yeah I'm always pacing the floor

'Cause this life I'm living without you

I just can't take no more



When the morning breeze starts blowing

I can hear you call my name

That's when my love starts showing

It's getting serious, baby

End of the game



'Cause I can't get enough of your love

I said I can't get enough of your love

I can't get enough of your love

I said I can't get enough of your love



'Cause when the morning breeze

Starts blowing

I can hear me call your name

That's when my love starts showing

It's getting serious, baby

End of the game



'Cause I can't get enough of your love

I can't get enough of your love

I said I can't get enough of your love

I said I can't get enough of your love



I can't get enough of your love
