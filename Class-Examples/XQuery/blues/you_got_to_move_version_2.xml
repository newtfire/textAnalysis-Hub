<l>You got to move, you got to move child

</l>
<l>You got to move, yes, you got to move

</l>
<l>But when the Lord get ready, you got to move, you got to move



</l>
<l>You may be high, you may be low

</l>
<l>You may be rich, you may be poor

</l>
<l>But when the Lord get ready, you got to move, you got to move



</l>
<l>You see that woman standing on the street

</l>
<l>You see the policeman walking his beat

</l>
<l>But when the Lord get ready, they got to move, they got to move</l></lyrics></xml>
