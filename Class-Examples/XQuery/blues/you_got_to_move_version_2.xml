<lyrics>



You got to move, you got to move child

You got to move, yes, you got to move

But when the Lord get ready, you got to move, you got to move



You may be high, you may be low

You may be rich, you may be poor

But when the Lord get ready, you got to move, you got to move



You see that woman standing on the street

You see the policeman walking his beat

But when the Lord get ready, they got to move, they got to move
