<lyrics>



You made me leave my happy hoe

You took my love and now you're gone

Since I fell for you



Love brings such misery and pain

I guess I'll never be the same

Since I fell for you



Oh, it's too bad, oh, it's so sad

I'm in love with you

You love me, then you snub me

But what can I do

I'm so in love with you



Oh, I guess I'll never see the light

I get the blues 'bout every night

Since I fell for you



Well, it's too bad, oh, it's so sad

That I'm in love with you

Oh, you love me, then you snub me

Oh, but what can I do

I'm so in love with you



Oh, I guess I'll never see the light

I get the blues 'bout every night

Since I fell for you

Since I fell for you
