<lyrics>


<l>You made me leave my happy hoe

</l>
<l>You took my love and now you're gone

</l>
<l>Since I fell for you



</l>
<l>Love brings such misery and pain

</l>
<l>I guess I'll never be the same

</l>
<l>Since I fell for you



</l>
<l>Oh, it's too bad, oh, it's so sad

</l>
<l>I'm in love with you

</l>
<l>You love me, then you snub me

</l>
<l>But what can I do

</l>
<l>I'm so in love with you



</l>
<l>Oh, I guess I'll never see the light

</l>
<l>I get the blues 'bout every night

</l>
<l>Since I fell for you



</l>
<l>Well, it's too bad, oh, it's so sad

</l>
<l>That I'm in love with you

</l>
<l>Oh, you love me, then you snub me

</l>
<l>Oh, but what can I do

</l>
<l>I'm so in love with you



</l>
<l>Oh, I guess I'll never see the light

</l>
<l>I get the blues 'bout every night

</l>
<l>Since I fell for you

</l>
<l>Since I fell for you</l></lyrics></xml>
