<lyrics>

<l>Gals, bed bugs sure is evil, they don't mean me no good

</l>
<l>Yeah, bed bug sure is evil, they don't mean me no good

</l>
<l>Thinks he's a woodpecker and I'm a chunk of wood



</l>
<l>When I lay down at night, I wonder how can a poor gal sleep

</l>
<l>When I lay down at night, I wonder how can a poor gal sleep

</l>
<l>When some is holding my hand, others eating my feet



</l>
<l>Bed bug as big as a jackass
1
, will bite you and stand and
grin

</l>
<l>Bed bug as big as a jackass, will bite you and stand and grin

</l>
<l>Will drink all the bed bur for them turn around and bite you
again



</l>
<l>Something moan in the corner, I went over and see

</l>
<l>Something moan in the corner, I went over and see

</l>
<l>It was the bed bug a prayin', Lord, gimme some more cheese
