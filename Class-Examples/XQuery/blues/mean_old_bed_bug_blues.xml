<lyrics>



Gals, bed bugs sure is evil, they don't mean me no good

Yeah, bed bug sure is evil, they don't mean me no good

Thinks he's a woodpecker and I'm a chunk of wood



When I lay down at night, I wonder how can a poor gal sleep

When I lay down at night, I wonder how can a poor gal sleep

When some is holding my hand, others eating my feet



Bed bug as big as a jackass
1
, will bite you and stand and
grin

Bed bug as big as a jackass, will bite you and stand and grin

Will drink all the bed bur for them turn around and bite you
again



Something moan in the corner, I went over and see

Something moan in the corner, I went over and see

It was the bed bug a prayin', Lord, gimme some more cheese



__________

Note 1: jackass, male donkey. In other context also used for a stupid
person or a fool.
