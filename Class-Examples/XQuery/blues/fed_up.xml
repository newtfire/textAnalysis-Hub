<lyrics>


<l>Still playin' this music now

</l>
<l>I wanna show you way I feel

</l>
<l>I feel bad 'cause I don't have a dollar bill

</l>
<l>I need money, Lord, at least that's what I wish

</l>
<l>One bird in the hand is better 'n two out in the bush



</l>
<l>That' why I'm fed up

</l>
<l>(He's fed up)

</l>
<l>Gotta keep the bird right in my hand, oh yeah

</l>
<l>Well I'm gonna stop this runnin' around

</l>
<l>An' get me a job like the average man, um-hm



</l>
<l>I'm gonna get me a job where I work from nine to five

</l>
<l>I'm playin' this music an' I can't hardly survive

</l>
<l>Money on a musician is the worst musician I ever seen

</l>
<l>I was better off when I was workin' for Walgreen



</l>
<l>That's why I'm fed up

</l>
<l>(He's fed up)

</l>
<l>Wanna keep a dollar right in my hand, oh yeah

</l>
<l>Well I'm gonna stop this runnin' around

</l>
<l>Get me a job like the average man, um-hm



</l>
<l>Should be a star 'cause I always want to be

</l>
<l>I hate guitars 'cause they just won't profit to me

</l>
<l>I'm playin' my saxophone an' I'm walkin' the streets an' cryin'

</l>
<l>Gotta get me a job 'cause I don't have a lousy dime!



</l>
<l>Now I hate this music 'cause it always leave me flat

</l>
<l>Thirty dollar job and you got your agent tryin' a-steal that

</l>
<l>People keep on tellin' me blues don't get satisfaction

</l>
<l>One hit record then I'll be a star like 

Michael
Jackson




</l>
<l>That's why I'm fed up

</l>
<l>(He's fed up)

</l>
<l>Gonna keep a dollar right in my hand, oh yeah

</l>
<l>Well I'm gonna stop this runnin' around

</l>
<l>And get me a job like the average man



</l>
<l>Lord, I'm gonna stop this runnin' around

</l>
<l>An' get me a job like the average man



</l>
<l>Well I'm gonna stop this runnin' around

</l>
<l>An' get me a job like the average man</l></lyrics></xml>
