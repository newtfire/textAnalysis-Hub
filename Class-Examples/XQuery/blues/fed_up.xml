<lyrics>



Still playin' this music now

I wanna show you way I feel

I feel bad 'cause I don't have a dollar bill

I need money, Lord, at least that's what I wish

One bird in the hand is better 'n two out in the bush



That' why I'm fed up

(He's fed up)

Gotta keep the bird right in my hand, oh yeah

Well I'm gonna stop this runnin' around

An' get me a job like the average man, um-hm



I'm gonna get me a job where I work from nine to five

I'm playin' this music an' I can't hardly survive

Money on a musician is the worst musician I ever seen

I was better off when I was workin' for Walgreen



That's why I'm fed up

(He's fed up)

Wanna keep a dollar right in my hand, oh yeah

Well I'm gonna stop this runnin' around

Get me a job like the average man, um-hm



Should be a star 'cause I always want to be

I hate guitars 'cause they just won't profit to me

I'm playin' my saxophone an' I'm walkin' the streets an' cryin'

Gotta get me a job 'cause I don't have a lousy dime!



Now I hate this music 'cause it always leave me flat

Thirty dollar job and you got your agent tryin' a-steal that

People keep on tellin' me blues don't get satisfaction

One hit record then I'll be a star like 
Michael
Jackson



That's why I'm fed up

(He's fed up)

Gonna keep a dollar right in my hand, oh yeah

Well I'm gonna stop this runnin' around

And get me a job like the average man



Lord, I'm gonna stop this runnin' around

An' get me a job like the average man



Well I'm gonna stop this runnin' around

An' get me a job like the average man
