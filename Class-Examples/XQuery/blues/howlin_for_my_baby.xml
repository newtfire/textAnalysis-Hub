Hmm-hmm, pretty baby, heeheeheehee

Heeheeheehee, come on home, I love you

If you hear me howlin', calling on my darlin'

Hoo hoo hoo whoe



She's hot like red pepper, sweet like cherry wine

I'm so glad she love me, love me all the time

She's my little baby, sweet as she can be

All this love she got, do belongs to me

If you hear me howlin', calling on my darlin'

Hoo hoo hoo whoe



Heeheeheehee, my baby, come on home

I love you, come on home

If you hear me howlin', calling on my darlin'

Hoo hoo hoo whoe



Every time she kiss me, she makes the lights go out

From early in the morning, she makes me jump and shout

This bad love she got, makes me laugh and cry

Makes me really know, that I'm too young to die

If you hear me howlin', calling on my darlin'

Hoo hoo hoo whoe



Heeheeheehee, come on, I love you

Pretty baby
