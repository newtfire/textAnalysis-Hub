<lyrics>


<l>Hmm-hmm, pretty baby, heeheeheehee

</l>
<l>Heeheeheehee, come on home, I love you

</l>
<l>If you hear me howlin', calling on my darlin'

</l>
<l>Hoo hoo hoo whoe



</l>
<l>She's hot like red pepper, sweet like cherry wine

</l>
<l>I'm so glad she love me, love me all the time

</l>
<l>She's my little baby, sweet as she can be

</l>
<l>All this love she got, do belongs to me

</l>
<l>If you hear me howlin', calling on my darlin'

</l>
<l>Hoo hoo hoo whoe



</l>
<l>Heeheeheehee, my baby, come on home

</l>
<l>I love you, come on home

</l>
<l>If you hear me howlin', calling on my darlin'

</l>
<l>Hoo hoo hoo whoe



</l>
<l>Every time she kiss me, she makes the lights go out

</l>
<l>From early in the morning, she makes me jump and shout

</l>
<l>This bad love she got, makes me laugh and cry

</l>
<l>Makes me really know, that I'm too young to die

</l>
<l>If you hear me howlin', calling on my darlin'

</l>
<l>Hoo hoo hoo whoe



</l>
<l>Heeheeheehee, come on, I love you

</l>
<l>Pretty baby</l></lyrics></xml>
