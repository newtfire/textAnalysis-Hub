<lyrics>


<l>Hello my old friend

</l>
<l>It's been awhile

</l>
<l>All our old clothes

</l>
<l>Are back in style

</l>
<l>We went our separate ways,

</l>
<l>Only to return

</l>
<l>To face a lesson

</l>
<l>We failed to learn



</l>
<l>We didn't understand the truth

</l>
<l>We were blinded by the eyes of youth

</l>
<l>But time kept on moving

</l>
<l>And a change has come

</l>
<l>You think that I don't know

</l>
<l>Where you're coming from



</l>
<l>(Chorus:)

</l>
<l>'Cause I feel just like you

</l>
<l>And I cry just like you

</l>
<l>But I heal just like you

</l>
<l>And under my skin

</l>
<l>I'm just like you



</l>
<l>You gave your love and your innocence

</l>
<l>And they took away your confidence

</l>
<l>Well I'm not those women

</l>
<l>I'm not those men

</l>
<l>Put your arms around me

</l>
<l>I am your friend





</l>
<l>(Chorus)



</l>
<l>(Bridge:)

</l>
<l>You and everybody else

</l>
<l>When I get hurt

</l>
<l>I cry for help

</l>
<l>And I've got secrets

</l>
<l>That god only knows

</l>
<l>And god knows I feel...



</l>
<l>(Chorus)</l></lyrics></xml>
