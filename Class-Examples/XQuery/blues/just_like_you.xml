<lyrics>



Hello my old friend

It's been awhile

All our old clothes

Are back in style

We went our separate ways,

Only to return

To face a lesson

We failed to learn



We didn't understand the truth

We were blinded by the eyes of youth

But time kept on moving

And a change has come

You think that I don't know

Where you're coming from



(Chorus:)

'Cause I feel just like you

And I cry just like you

But I heal just like you

And under my skin

I'm just like you



You gave your love and your innocence

And they took away your confidence

Well I'm not those women

I'm not those men

Put your arms around me

I am your friend





(Chorus)



(Bridge:)

You and everybody else

When I get hurt

I cry for help

And I've got secrets

That god only knows

And god knows I feel...



(Chorus)
