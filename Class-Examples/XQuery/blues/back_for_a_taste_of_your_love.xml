Here I come, I'm coming for a taste of your love
Here I come, baby, because I like what you do for me

Little by little, bit by bit,
I'm falling in love all over again

Here I come, I'm coming for a taste of your love
Here I come now, baby, just like I did before
And I'm coming back, 'cause this time I'm sure

It takes two, to make it,
and I know you can take it, again

Here I come, I'm back for a taste of your Love
Here I come, I'm coming back for you now

What you've been, just come down on me
You've got the lock, pretty baby, but I've got the key

Little by little, bit by bit,
I'm falling in Love all over again

Here I come, I'm coming for a taste of your love
Here I come now baby, I'm back for a taste of your love

You know, I'm coming back for a taste of your love
You know, I've got to come back now baby
