<lyrics>


<l>Here I come, I'm coming for a taste of your love
Here I come, baby, because I like what you do for me

</l>
<l>Little by little, bit by bit,
I'm falling in love all over again

</l>
<l>Here I come, I'm coming for a taste of your love
Here I come now, baby, just like I did before
And I'm coming back, 'cause this time I'm sure

</l>
<l>It takes two, to make it,
and I know you can take it, again

</l>
<l>Here I come, I'm back for a taste of your Love
Here I come, I'm coming back for you now

</l>
<l>What you've been, just come down on me
You've got the lock, pretty baby, but I've got the key

</l>
<l>Little by little, bit by bit,
I'm falling in Love all over again

</l>
<l>Here I come, I'm coming for a taste of your love
Here I come now baby, I'm back for a taste of your love

</l><l>You know, I'm coming back for a taste of your love</l>
<l>You know, I've got to come back now baby</l></lyrics></xml>
