<lyrics>



Well, I work hard everyday

Come home straight with my pay

My baby either drink it up

Or she threw it all away



I'm gonna quit my baby

If she don't stop cheatin' and lyin'

Well, I would rather be alone

Than to be worried out of my mind



Well, I give her all of my money

I think I'm being kind

She buy a quart of bad whiskey

And the rest is beer and wine



Well, a few nights ago

I had to work kind-a late

Somebody broke out of my house

Just like he was Superman's mate



Well, four o'clock in the morning, when I staggered in the block

The little 
moonshine

joint and the rest just begin to rock

I sneaked inside to get a better view

I caught my baby doin' the mambo too
