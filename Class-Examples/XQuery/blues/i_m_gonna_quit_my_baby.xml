<lyrics>


<l>Well, I work hard everyday

</l>
<l>Come home straight with my pay

</l>
<l>My baby either drink it up

</l>
<l>Or she threw it all away



</l>
<l>I'm gonna quit my baby

</l>
<l>If she don't stop cheatin' and lyin'

</l>
<l>Well, I would rather be alone

</l>
<l>Than to be worried out of my mind



</l>
<l>Well, I give her all of my money

</l>
<l>I think I'm being kind

</l>
<l>She buy a quart of bad whiskey

</l>
<l>And the rest is beer and wine



</l>
<l>Well, a few nights ago

</l>
<l>I had to work kind-a late

</l>
<l>Somebody broke out of my house

</l>
<l>Just like he was Superman's mate



</l>
<l>Well, four o'clock in the morning, when I staggered in the block

</l>
<l>The little 
moonshine

</l>
<l>joint and the rest just begin to rock

</l>
<l>I sneaked inside to get a better view

</l>
<l>I caught my baby doin' the mambo too</l></lyrics></xml>
