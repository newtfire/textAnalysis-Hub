<lyrics>


<l>The tar in the street starts to melt from the heat,

and the sweats runnin' down from my hair
I walked 20 miles and I'm dragging my feet,
and I'll walk 20 more I don't care


</l>
<l>And I'll wander this world, wander this world
Wander this world, wander this world all alone

</l>
<l>I'm like a ghost some people can't see,

others drive by and stare
A shadow that drifts by the side of the road,
it's like I'm not even there


</l>
<l>And I'll wander this world, wander this world
Wander this world, wander this world all alone

</l>
<l>Well I've never been part of the game,

the life that I live is my own
All that I know is that I was born,
to wander this world all alone, all alone


</l>
<l>Some people are born with their lives all laid out,

and all their success is assured
Some people work hard all their lives for nothin'
They take it and don't say a word,
they don't say a word


</l>
<l>Sometimes it's like I don't even exist,

even God has lost track of my soul
Why else would he leave me out here like this,
to wander this world all alone


</l><l>And I'll wander this world, wander this world</l>
<l>Wander this world, wander this world all alone</l></lyrics></xml>
