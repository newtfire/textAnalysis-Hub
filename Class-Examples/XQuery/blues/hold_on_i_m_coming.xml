<lyrics>



Don't you ever be sad

Lean on me in times of bad

When the day comes and you're in doubt

In a river of trouble about to drown



Hold On, hold on

I'm coming, I'm coming

Hold On, hold on

I'm coming, I'm coming



I'm on my way your lover

When you get cold

I'll be your cover

Don't have to worry

Because I'm here

Don't need to suffer

Because I'm here



Hold On, hold on

I'm coming, I'm coming

Hold On, hold on

I'm coming, I'm coming



Reach out to me

For satisfaction

Call my name

Quick reaction

Hey hey hey



Don't you ever be sad

Lean on me in times of bad

When the day comes and you're in doubt

In a river of trouble about to drown



Don't you ever be sad

Lean on me in times of bad

Hold on, hold on

I'm coming, I'm coming
