</l>
<l>You take like, me an' my wife

</l>
<l>We got about four kids



</l>
<l>Found the next door neighbor, an' she says,

</l>
<l>"Look-a-here, let's get together one night,

</l>
<l>An' go out an' have a ball, let the husbands baby-sit,

</l>
<l>How 'bout that?"



</l>
<l>Can ya dig it fellas?



</l>
<l>She come after me, she says, "Honey, we wanna go out tonight, and
have a ball"

</l>
<l>I said, "Sure, it's alright, just as long as you be home by two"



</l>
<l>I let's her go ahead on out, an' I'm baby sittin',

</l>
<l>Kids hollerin' an' cryin',

</l>
<l>I had to put diapers, change diapers



</l>
<l>Two o'clock come, no wife



</l>
<l>I said well, that's alright she probably went 'bout four or five
miles out-a the city limit

</l>
<l>I give her about thirty minutes to get home



</l>
<l>Can ya dig it fellas?



</l>
<l>Three o'clock come, still no wife



</l>
<l>Four o'clock, sure was mad, now

</l>
<l>Here she come, draggin' in



</l>
<l>Now can ya dig this fellas?



</l>
<l>Now here the way she talk to me, real sweet



</l>
<l>She sounded good, ya know



</l>
<l>Kissin' me all on the neck an' goin' on

</l>
<l>Felt good, but I'm still mad!



</l>
<l>Now after she done all that sweet talk,

</l>
<l>You know what I told her, fellas?

</l>
<l>You know what I told her?

</l>
<l>You don't know what I told her?



</l>
<l>An' I fool around an' made her mad, you know what would happen?

</l>
<l>You know what she told me, fellas?



</l>
<l>Now I told her the same thing



</l>
<l>#91;Let's ride this thing outta trouble#93; (yeah)

</l>
<l>Well this woman is puttin' me out

</l>
<l>How 'bout that?</l></lyrics></xml>
