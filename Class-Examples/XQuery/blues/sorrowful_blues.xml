<lyrics>



If you catch me stealin', I don't mean no harm

If you catch me stealin', I don't mean no harm

It's a mark in my family and it must be carryin' on



I got nineteen men and won't want more

I got nineteen men and won't want more

If I had one more I'd let that nineteen go



It's hard to love another woman's man

It's hard to love another woman's man

You catch him when you want him, you got to catch him when you
can



Have you ever seen a peaches grow on sweet potato vine?

Have you ever seen a peaches grow on sweet potato vine ?

Just step in my backyard and take a peep at mine



I'm gonna tell you, daddy, like Solomon
1
 told the Jew

I'm gonna tell you, daddy, like Solomon told the Jew

If you don't like-ee me, I sure don't like-ee you



__________

Note 1: Solomon, Dorus Sturm suggests "China man" instead of
Solomon.
