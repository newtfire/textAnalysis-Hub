<lyrics>

<l>If you catch me stealin', I don't mean no harm

</l>
<l>If you catch me stealin', I don't mean no harm

</l>
<l>It's a mark in my family and it must be carryin' on



</l>
<l>I got nineteen men and won't want more

</l>
<l>I got nineteen men and won't want more

</l>
<l>If I had one more I'd let that nineteen go



</l>
<l>It's hard to love another woman's man

</l>
<l>It's hard to love another woman's man

</l>
<l>You catch him when you want him, you got to catch him when you
can



</l>
<l>Have you ever seen a peaches grow on sweet potato vine?

</l>
<l>Have you ever seen a peaches grow on sweet potato vine ?

</l>
<l>Just step in my backyard and take a peep at mine



</l>
<l>I'm gonna tell you, daddy, like Solomon
1
 </l><l>told the Jew</l>
<l>
I'm gonna tell you, daddy, like Solomon told the Jew

</l>
<l>If you don't like-ee me, I sure don't like-ee you



</l>
