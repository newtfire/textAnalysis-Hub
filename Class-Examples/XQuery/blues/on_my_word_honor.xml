On my word of honor

All my love belongs to you

Please put your faith in me

You see how true I'll be



On my word of honor

You can trust me with your heart

And I pledge mine to you

It's yours my whole life through



Baby, lips never kiss you

Again if they're telling you a lie

And forever, ever, ever, ever and ever

I cross my heart and hope to die



On my word of honor

You mean everything to me

I swear by stars above

I'll keep my word, my love



Baby, lips never kiss you

Again if they're telling you a lie

And forever, ever, ever, ever and ever

I cross my heart and hope to die



On my word of honor

You mean everything to me

I swear by stars above

I'll keep my word, my love
