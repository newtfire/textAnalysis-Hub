<lyrics>


<l>On my word of honor

</l>
<l>All my love belongs to you

</l>
<l>Please put your faith in me

</l>
<l>You see how true I'll be



</l>
<l>On my word of honor

</l>
<l>You can trust me with your heart

</l>
<l>And I pledge mine to you

</l>
<l>It's yours my whole life through



</l>
<l>Baby, lips never kiss you

</l>
<l>Again if they're telling you a lie

</l>
<l>And forever, ever, ever, ever and ever

</l>
<l>I cross my heart and hope to die



</l>
<l>On my word of honor

</l>
<l>You mean everything to me

</l>
<l>I swear by stars above

</l>
<l>I'll keep my word, my love



</l>
<l>Baby, lips never kiss you

</l>
<l>Again if they're telling you a lie

</l>
<l>And forever, ever, ever, ever and ever

</l>
<l>I cross my heart and hope to die



</l>
<l>On my word of honor

</l>
<l>You mean everything to me

</l>
<l>I swear by stars above

</l>
<l>I'll keep my word, my love</l></lyrics></xml>
