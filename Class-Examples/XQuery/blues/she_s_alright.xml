<lyrics>

I wanna tell you about my little girl,

her name is Millie-Lu

She's alright, she's alright

She's alright, she's alright



Sugar baby, sugar baby

Sweedy dee, sweedy dee

Baby, baby, sugar, sugar



Baby, oh I love you so,

I'll never let you go

You alright in my room

You alright at my table

You alright when we're walkin' down the street

The love in you and me, just can't be beat



Baby, baby

Baby, baby



Hold it everybody,

I wanna tell ya 'bout this little girl

I don't think ya getting the message straight,

I wanna tell you, she's alright

She make me feel

She make me feel, so good, so good

Sure 'nuff, sure 'nuff

Babe, hold my hand

Babe, hold my hand

I can't stand up by myself

I can't stand up without your help
