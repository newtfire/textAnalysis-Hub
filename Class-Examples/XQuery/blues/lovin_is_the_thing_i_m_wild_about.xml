<l>Love me daddy, love me all the time

</l>
<l>Love me until I pass away

</l>
<l>I'm just wild about my loving

</l>
<l>Love me night and day

</l>
<l>I used to have an old man who never did like loving

</l>
<l>That man was not my kind

</l>
<l>I found someone who likes loving like me

</l>
<l>And you can pass my house and hear me crying



</l>
<l>I want a man to be real nice to me and call me mama, I say mama

</l>
<l>I don't want no man if he can't call me mama, I say mama

</l>
<l>He's got to be nice and kind

</l>
<l>Got to love me all the time

</l>
<l>And when he starts loving all you can hear me saying

</l>
<l>Oh papa, please your mama

</l>
<l>Lord, I want a man I can play with all night long

</l>
<l>I want a man to take back round to my mama's home

</l>
<l>And when he loves me in that oldfashioned way

</l>
<l>I don't mind dying everyday

</l>
<l>Because lovin', lovin' is the thing I'm just wild about



</l>
<l>I want a man that I can play with all night long

</l>
<l>I want a man to take back round to my mama's home

</l>
<l>And when he loves me in that oldfashioned way

</l>
<l>I don't mind dying every day

</l>
<l>Because lovin', lovin' is the thing I'm just wild about</l></lyrics></xml>
