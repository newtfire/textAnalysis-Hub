<lyrics>



Love me daddy, love me all the time

Love me until I pass away

I'm just wild about my loving

Love me night and day

I used to have an old man who never did like loving

That man was not my kind

I found someone who likes loving like me

And you can pass my house and hear me crying



I want a man to be real nice to me and call me mama, I say mama

I don't want no man if he can't call me mama, I say mama

He's got to be nice and kind

Got to love me all the time

And when he starts loving all you can hear me saying

Oh papa, please your mama

Lord, I want a man I can play with all night long

I want a man to take back round to my mama's home

And when he loves me in that oldfashioned way

I don't mind dying everyday

Because lovin', lovin' is the thing I'm just wild about



I want a man that I can play with all night long

I want a man to take back round to my mama's home

And when he loves me in that oldfashioned way

I don't mind dying every day

Because lovin', lovin' is the thing I'm just wild about
