<lyrics>


<l>Well hello, pretty baby,

</l>
<l>I just called to say that we're thru

</l>
<l>Because I'm so tired of sneaking around with you

</l>
<l>I wanna meet you in the sunlight,

</l>
<l>not in a secret rendevouz

</l>
<l>Because I'm so tired of sneaking around with you



</l>
<l>Oh, you never, you never be meant to be mine,

</l>
<l>oh, I was just too blind to see

</l>
<l>Oh, but I got my pride, so why should we hide,

</l>
<l>when you light this, we'll be free

</l>
<l>Oh I love you, you know I love you,

</l>
<l>oh, and I wanna tell the world, I do,

</l>
<l>that's why I'm so tired of sneaking around with you

</l>
<l>Oh, I'm so tired of sneaking around with you

</l><l>Oh, I'm so tired of sneaking around with you</l></lyrics></xml>
