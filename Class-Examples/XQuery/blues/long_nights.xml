<lyrics>


<l>Yes the nights are so long, baby, and the days are so blue

</l>
<l>Seems like everything has gone wrong, baby 'cause I'm without you

</l>
<l>I guess this is that awful feeling, baby that feeling they call the

blues




</l>
<l>All by myself baby, yes I began to weep

</l>
<l>Yes, and when I dry my eyes, baby, you know I still can't sleep

</l>
<l>Yes, I guess this is the feeling, baby the feeling they call the

blues




</l>
<l>Yes as I sit here in my dark room, woman, with the tears running down
my face

</l>
<l>Yes as I sit here in my dark room, woman, with the tears running down
my face

</l>
<l>Yes I can feel and I can see you, woman, I can see you all over the

place




</l>
<l>Yes, then I start walkin', woman, start walkin' all over the
floor

</l>
<l>Yes, my heart is telling me, woman, tellin' me you won't be here no
more

</l><l>Oh, I guess this is the feeling, baby the feeling, the feeling they</l>
<l>call the blues</l></lyrics></xml>
