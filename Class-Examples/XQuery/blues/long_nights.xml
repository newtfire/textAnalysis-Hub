<lyrics>



Yes the nights are so long, baby, and the days are so blue

Seems like everything has gone wrong, baby 'cause I'm without you

I guess this is that awful feeling, baby that feeling they call the
blues



All by myself baby, yes I began to weep

Yes, and when I dry my eyes, baby, you know I still can't sleep

Yes, I guess this is the feeling, baby the feeling they call the
blues



Yes as I sit here in my dark room, woman, with the tears running down
my face

Yes as I sit here in my dark room, woman, with the tears running down
my face

Yes I can feel and I can see you, woman, I can see you all over the
place



Yes, then I start walkin', woman, start walkin' all over the
floor

Yes, my heart is telling me, woman, tellin' me you won't be here no
more

Oh, I guess this is the feeling, baby the feeling, the feeling they
call the blues
