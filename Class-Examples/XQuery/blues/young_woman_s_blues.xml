<lyrics>


<l>Woke up this mornin' when chickens was crowin' for day

</l>
<l>Felt on the right side of my pilla', my man gad gone away

</l>
<l>By this pilla' he left a note readin', "I'm sorry, Jane, you got my
goat

</l>
<l>No time to marry, no time to settle down"



</l>
<l>I'm a young woman and ain't done runnin' 'round

</l>
<l>I'm a young woman and ain't done runnin' 'round

</l>
<l>Some people call me a 

hobo
,
some call me a bum




</l>
<l>Nobody knows my name, nobody knows what I've done

</l>
<l>I'm as good as any woman in your town

</l>
<l>I ain't no 

high
yeller
, I'm a deep killer of brown


</l>
<l>I ain't gonna marry, ain't gonna settle down



</l>
<l>I'm gonna drink good 
moonshine

</l>
<l>and rub these browns down

</l>
<l>See that long lonesome road

</l><l>Lawd, you know it's gotta and I'm a good woman and I can get plenty</l>
<l>men</l></lyrics></xml>
