<lyrics>



Woke up this mornin' when chickens was crowin' for day

Felt on the right side of my pilla', my man gad gone away

By this pilla' he left a note readin', "I'm sorry, Jane, you got my
goat

No time to marry, no time to settle down"



I'm a young woman and ain't done runnin' 'round

I'm a young woman and ain't done runnin' 'round

Some people call me a 
hobo
,
some call me a bum



Nobody knows my name, nobody knows what I've done

I'm as good as any woman in your town

I ain't no 
high
yeller
, I'm a deep killer of brown

I ain't gonna marry, ain't gonna settle down



I'm gonna drink good 
moonshine

and rub these browns down

See that long lonesome road

Lawd, you know it's gotta and I'm a good woman and I can get plenty
men
