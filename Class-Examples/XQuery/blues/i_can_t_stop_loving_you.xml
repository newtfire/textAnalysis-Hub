<lyrics>


<l>Those happy hours

</l>
<l>That we once knew

</l>
<l>Though long ago

</l>
<l>Still makes me so blue

</l>
<l>They say that time

</l>
<l>Heals a broken heart

</l>
<l>But time has stood still

</l>
<l>Since we've been apart



</l>
<l>I can't stop loving you

</l>
<l>I've made up my mind

</l>
<l>To live in memories

</l>
<l>All the lonesome time

</l>
<l>I can't stop wanting you

</l>
<l>It's useless to say

</l>
<l>So I'll just live my life

</l>
<l>In dreams of yesterday



</l>
<l>Those happy, happy hours, baby

</l>
<l>That we once knew

</l>
<l>Though long ago

</l>
<l>It still makes me blue

</l>
<l>They say that time

</l>
<l>Heals a broken heart

</l>
<l>But time has stood still

</l>
<l>Since we've been apart



</l>
<l>I can't stop loving you, baby

</l>
<l>I've made up my mind

</l>
<l>To live in memories

</l>
<l>All the lonesome time

</l>
<l>I can't stop loving you

</l>
<l>Yeah, yeah, yeah

</l>
<l>It's useless to say

</l>
<l>Useless to say

</l>
<l>So I'll just live my life

</l>
<l>In dreams of yesterday



</l>
<l>Oh yeah, I've made up my mind

</l>
<l>Made up my mind

</l>
<l>So I'll just live my life

</l>
<l>Live my life, yeah, yeah

</l>
<l>I can't stop loving you

</l>
<l>No, I can't

</l>
<l>Baby, it's useless to say

</l>
<l>Useless to say, yeah

</l>
<l>So I'm gonna live my life

</l>
<l>Live my life

</l>
<l>In dreams of yesterday

</l>
<l>Yesterday

</l>
<l>I'm gonna, gonna live my life

</l>
<l>Oh yeah, yes I am

</l>
<l>In dreams of yesterday

</l>
<l>Dreams of yesterday

</l>
<l>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah</l></lyrics></xml>
