<lyrics>



Those happy hours

That we once knew

Though long ago

Still makes me so blue

They say that time

Heals a broken heart

But time has stood still

Since we've been apart



I can't stop loving you

I've made up my mind

To live in memories

All the lonesome time

I can't stop wanting you

It's useless to say

So I'll just live my life

In dreams of yesterday



Those happy, happy hours, baby

That we once knew

Though long ago

It still makes me blue

They say that time

Heals a broken heart

But time has stood still

Since we've been apart



I can't stop loving you, baby

I've made up my mind

To live in memories

All the lonesome time

I can't stop loving you

Yeah, yeah, yeah

It's useless to say

Useless to say

So I'll just live my life

In dreams of yesterday



Oh yeah, I've made up my mind

Made up my mind

So I'll just live my life

Live my life, yeah, yeah

I can't stop loving you

No, I can't

Baby, it's useless to say

Useless to say, yeah

So I'm gonna live my life

Live my life

In dreams of yesterday

Yesterday

I'm gonna, gonna live my life

Oh yeah, yes I am

In dreams of yesterday

Dreams of yesterday

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
