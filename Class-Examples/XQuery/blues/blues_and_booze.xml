<lyrics>


<l>Went to bed last night, and boy I was in my sleep, sleep

</l>
<l>I went to bed last night, and I was in my sleep

</l>
<l>Woke up this mornin', the police was shakin' me



</l>
<l>I went to the jailhouse, drunk and blues as I could be

</l>
<l>I went to the jailhouse, drunk and blues as I could be

</l>
<l>But that cruel old judge sent my man away from me



</l>
<l>They carried me to the courthouse, Lordy, how I was cryin'

</l>
<l>They carried me to the courthouse, Lordy, how I was cryin'

</l>
<l>They jailed me sixty days in jail, and money couldn't pay my fine



</l>
<l>Sixty days ain't long if you can spend them as you choose

</l>
<l>Sixty days ain't long if you can spend them as you choose

</l>
<l>But this seems like jail than a cell where there ain't no booze



</l>
<l>My life is all a misery when I cannot get my booze

</l>
<l>My life is all a misery when I cannot get my booze

</l><l>I spend every dime on liquor, got to have the booze to go with these</l>
