<lyrics>


<l>I was runnin' down the highway, goin' down to New Orleans

</l>
<l>Two women passed me, drivin' a big machine

</l>
<l>I didn't know what it was but finally I caught up

</l>
<l>They gettin' a spendin' ticket and they were drivin' a pick up

truck




</l>
<l>Two womens in a pick up truck, man them's really tuff

</l>
<l>Two womens in a pick up truck, man them is really tuff

</l>
<l>Rollin' down the highway drivin' their pick up truck



</l>
<l>Said, "Honey where you goin' I want you to make my day"

</l>
<l>She said, "I'll do anything just as long as you goin' my way"

</l>
<l>She said, "We not dressed up we only got on blue jeans"

</l>
<l>"But we feel right fine so we're goin' down to New Orleans"



</l>
<l>Two womens in a pick up truck, man them's really tuff

</l>
<l>Two womens in a pick up truck, man them's really tuff

</l>
<l>Rollin' down the highway drivin' their pick up truck



</l>
<l>I was runnin' down the highway drivin' 'bout sixty-five

</l>
<l>(Say what, say what?)

</l>
<l>I would find them women I was the happiest man alive

</l>
<l>(Say what, say what?)

</l>
<l>I say "You're doin' good honey, now tell me what more can we do?"

</l>
<l>(Say what, say what?)

</l>
<l>She said, I'll drive anything and drive an' eighteen wheeler too"

</l>
<l>(Say what, say whaaat?)



</l>
<l>Two womens in a pick up truck, man them's really tuff

</l>
<l>Two womens in a pick up truck, man them's really tuff

</l>
<l>Ridin' down the highway, drivin' their pick up truck



</l>
<l>Two women's in a pick up truck, man them's really tuff

</l>
<l>Two women's in a pick up truck, man them's really tuff

</l>
<l>Goin' to New Orleans they were drivin' their pick up truck</l></lyrics></xml>
