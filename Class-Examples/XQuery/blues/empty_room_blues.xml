<lyrics>



My room was empty, and my woman was gone

My room was empty, and my woman was gone

I didn't have a nickel, and all my clothes in pawn



I asked my next door neighbor, which-a-way did my baby go?

Asked my next door neighbor, which-a-way did my baby go?

She says she left for the border, down in old Mexico



I found a note on the floor, it almost sent me off in a trance

I found a note on the floor, it almost sent me off in a trance

She said it's nothin' that you done, I'm just leavin' in advance



Yes, yes, yes



It's so hard when a woman leave you, and she leave you on a zoom

It's so hard when a woman leave you, and leave you on a zoom

You come home feelin' very happy, and find only a empty room
