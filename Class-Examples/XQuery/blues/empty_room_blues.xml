<lyrics>


<l>My room was empty, and my woman was gone

</l>
<l>My room was empty, and my woman was gone

</l>
<l>I didn't have a nickel, and all my clothes in pawn



</l>
<l>I asked my next door neighbor, which-a-way did my baby go?

</l>
<l>Asked my next door neighbor, which-a-way did my baby go?

</l>
<l>She says she left for the border, down in old Mexico



</l>
<l>I found a note on the floor, it almost sent me off in a trance

</l>
<l>I found a note on the floor, it almost sent me off in a trance

</l>
<l>She said it's nothin' that you done, I'm just leavin' in advance



</l>
<l>Yes, yes, yes



</l>
<l>It's so hard when a woman leave you, and she leave you on a zoom

</l>
<l>It's so hard when a woman leave you, and leave you on a zoom

</l>
<l>You come home feelin' very happy, and find only a empty room</l></lyrics></xml>
