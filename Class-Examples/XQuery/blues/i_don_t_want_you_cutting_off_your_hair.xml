<lyrics>



You painted your lips baby and you painted your eyes too

Its gettin' to the place now woman, till I can't hardly recognize
you

If that's what it takes to be hip baby, oh, I want you to be a
square

I don't want you messing around baby, oh, I don't want you cutting of
your hair



I didn't say nothing to you baby, when you were wearing bikinis for
close

Oh I even stood around baby, I watched you paint your toes

If that's what it takes to be hip baby, oh, I want you to be a
square

I don't want you messing up woman, oh, I don't want you cutting of
your hair



There's something about your girlfriend baby, I swear I can't
understand

She got her hair cut off the other day and now she looks just like a
man

If that's what it takes to be hip baby, oh, I want you to be a
square

I don't want you messing up baby, oh, I don't want you cutting of
your hair
