<lyrics>


<l>You painted your lips baby and you painted your eyes too

</l>
<l>Its gettin' to the place now woman, till I can't hardly recognize
you

</l>
<l>If that's what it takes to be hip baby, oh, I want you to be a
square

</l>
<l>I don't want you messing around baby, oh, I don't want you cutting of

your hair




</l>
<l>I didn't say nothing to you baby, when you were wearing bikinis for
close

</l>
<l>Oh I even stood around baby, I watched you paint your toes

</l>
<l>If that's what it takes to be hip baby, oh, I want you to be a
square

</l>
<l>I don't want you messing up woman, oh, I don't want you cutting of

your hair




</l>
<l>There's something about your girlfriend baby, I swear I can't
understand

</l>
<l>She got her hair cut off the other day and now she looks just like a
man

</l>
<l>If that's what it takes to be hip baby, oh, I want you to be a
square

</l><l>I don't want you messing up baby, oh, I don't want you cutting of</l>
<l>your hair</l></lyrics></xml>
