<lyrics>



When you squeeze me baby, you make me holler whoa, whoa,
whoa

When you squeeze me baby, you make me holler whoa, whoa, whoa

Back in my mind, I wonder what ya' doin' to me



When you squeeze me baby, holler whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

When you squeeze me baby, you make me holler whoa, whoa, whoa

Back in my mind baby, what are ya' doin' to me ...sugar



You're a good lookin woman, you're as sweet as you can be

You is a good lookin woman, you sweet as you can be

Back in my mind baby, what is ya' doin' to me



I holler whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

I holler whoa baby, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

Back in my mind baby, what are ya' doin' to me



...got me hollerin'

...got me hollerin'
