<lyrics>



Well I'm love struck baby I must confess,

life without you darlin' is a solid mess

Thinkin' 'bout you baby give me such a thrill,

I gotta have you baby, can't get my fill

I love ya baby an' I know just what to do



I still remember, and let it be said,

the way you make me feel it take a fool to forget

I swore a ton of bricks had hit me in the head,

and what you do little baby, I ain't over yet



Every time I see ya make me feel so fine,

my heart beatin' crazy, my blood runnin' wild

Your lovin' makes me feel like a mighty mighty man,

love me baby ain't I your man



I'm a love struck baby

Yeah, I'm a love struck baby

You got me love struck baby,

and I know just what to do



Sparks start flyin' every time we meet

Let me tell you baby you knock me off my feet

Your kisses trip me up and they're just doggone sweet

Don't you know baby you can't be beat



I'm a love struck baby

Yeah, I'm a love struck baby

You got me love struck baby,

and I know just what to do
