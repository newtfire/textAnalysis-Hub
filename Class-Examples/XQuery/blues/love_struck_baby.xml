<lyrics>


<l>Well I'm love struck baby I must confess,

</l>
<l>life without you darlin' is a solid mess

</l>
<l>Thinkin' 'bout you baby give me such a thrill,

</l>
<l>I gotta have you baby, can't get my fill

</l>
<l>I love ya baby an' I know just what to do



</l>
<l>I still remember, and let it be said,

</l>
<l>the way you make me feel it take a fool to forget

</l>
<l>I swore a ton of bricks had hit me in the head,

</l>
<l>and what you do little baby, I ain't over yet



</l>
<l>Every time I see ya make me feel so fine,

</l>
<l>my heart beatin' crazy, my blood runnin' wild

</l>
<l>Your lovin' makes me feel like a mighty mighty man,

</l>
<l>love me baby ain't I your man



</l>
<l>I'm a love struck baby

</l>
<l>Yeah, I'm a love struck baby

</l>
<l>You got me love struck baby,

</l>
<l>and I know just what to do



</l>
<l>Sparks start flyin' every time we meet

</l>
<l>Let me tell you baby you knock me off my feet

</l>
<l>Your kisses trip me up and they're just doggone sweet

</l>
<l>Don't you know baby you can't be beat



</l>
<l>I'm a love struck baby

</l>
<l>Yeah, I'm a love struck baby

</l>
<l>You got me love struck baby,

</l>
<l>and I know just what to do
