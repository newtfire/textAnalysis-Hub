<lyrics>

<l>Beatrice got a phonograph, and it won't say a lonesome word

</l>
<l>Beatrice got a phonograph, and it won't say a lonesome word

</l>
<l>What evil have I done, what evil has the poor girl heard



</l>
<l>Beatrice, I love my phonograph, but you broke my windin' chain

</l>
<l>Beatrice, I love my phonograph, but you have broke my windin'
chain

</l>
<l>And you taken my lovin', and you give it to your other man



</l>
<l>And we played it on the sofa, and we played it side the wall

</l>
<l>And we played it on the sofa, and we played it side the wall

</l>
<l>But boys, my needles have got rusty, and it will not play at all



</l>
<l>Beatrice, I love my phonograph mmm, babe and I'm bound to lose my
mind

</l>
<l>Beatrice, I love my phonograph, and I'm 'bout to lose my mind

</l>
<l>Why'n't
1
you bring your clothes back home, baby, and try </l>
<l>me one more time



</l>
<l>Now my phonograph, mmm, babe, it won't say a lonesome word

</l>
<l>My little phonograph, and it won't say a lonesome word

</l>
<l>What evil I have done, what evil have the poor girl heard



</l>
<l>Now Beatrice, won't you bring your clothes back home

</l>
<l>Now Beatrice, won't you bring your clothes back home

</l>
<l>I wanna wind your little phonograph, just to hear your little motor
moan
