<lyrics>



Beatrice got a phonograph, and it won't say a lonesome word

Beatrice got a phonograph, and it won't say a lonesome word

What evil have I done, what evil has the poor girl heard



Beatrice, I love my phonograph, but you broke my windin' chain

Beatrice, I love my phonograph, but you have broke my windin'
chain

And you taken my lovin', and you give it to your other man



And we played it on the sofa, and we played it side the wall

And we played it on the sofa, and we played it side the wall

But boys, my needles have got rusty, and it will not play at all



Beatrice, I love my phonograph mmm, babe and I'm bound to lose my
mind

Beatrice, I love my phonograph, and I'm 'bout to lose my mind

Why'n't
1
 you bring your clothes back home, baby, and try
me one more time



Now my phonograph, mmm, babe, it won't say a lonesome word

My little phonograph, and it won't say a lonesome word

What evil I have done, what evil have the poor girl heard



Now Beatrice, won't you bring your clothes back home

Now Beatrice, won't you bring your clothes back home

I wanna wind your little phonograph, just to hear your little motor
moan

Note 1: alternatively "won't" instead of "why'n't", as a contraction
of "why don't"
