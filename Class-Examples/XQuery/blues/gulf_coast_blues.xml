<lyrics>



I've been blue all day, my man's gone away

He has left his mama cold for another gal I'm told

I tried to treat him kind, I thought he would be mine

That man I hate to lose, that's why mama's got the blues



The man I love he has done left this town

The man I love he has done left this town

And if it keeps on snowing, I will be Gulf Coast bound



The mail man passed but he didn't leave no news

The mail man passed but he didn't leave no news

I'll tell the world he left me with those Gulf Coast blues



Some of you men sure do make me tired

Some of you men sure do make me tired

You've got a mouthful of "gimme", a handful of "much oblige"
