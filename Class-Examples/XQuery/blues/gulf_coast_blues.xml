<lyrics>


<l>I've been blue all day, my man's gone away

</l>
<l>He has left his mama cold for another gal I'm told

</l>
<l>I tried to treat him kind, I thought he would be mine

</l>
<l>That man I hate to lose, that's why mama's got the blues



</l>
<l>The man I love he has done left this town

</l>
<l>The man I love he has done left this town

</l>
<l>And if it keeps on snowing, I will be Gulf Coast bound



</l>
<l>The mail man passed but he didn't leave no news

</l>
<l>The mail man passed but he didn't leave no news

</l>
<l>I'll tell the world he left me with those Gulf Coast blues



</l>
<l>Some of you men sure do make me tired

</l>
<l>Some of you men sure do make me tired

</l>
<l>You've got a mouthful of "gimme", a handful of "much oblige"</l></lyrics></xml>
