<l>Help the poor (chorus: help the poor)

</l>
<l>Won't you help poor me (chorus: help poor me)

</l>
<l>I need help from you baby

</l>
<l>Need it desperately (chorus: I need help)

</l>
<l>I need you so much

</l>
<l>I need you're care

</l>
<l>I need all the loving baby you can spare

</l>
<l>Help the poor

</l>
<l>Oh, baby help poor me (chorus: sha-lala-lala-la)



</l>
<l>Say you will

</l>
<l>Say you'll help me on

</l>
<l>I can't make it no further

</l>
<l>In this world alone

</l>
<l>Baby I'm beggin' with tears in my eyes

</l>
<l>For your loving, don't you realize

</l>
<l>I need help, oh baby

</l>
<l>Help poor me



</l>
<l>You are my inspiration (chorus: sha-lala-lala-la)

</l>
<l>You could make me be a king

</l>
<l>But if you don't come to my rescue (chorus: sha-lala-lala-la)

</l>
<l>I couldn't ever be anything



</l>
<l>Help the poor (chorus: help the poor)

</l>
<l>Baby help poor me (chorus: help poor me)

</l>
<l>Have a heart won't you baby

</l>
<l>Listening to my plea (chorus: I need help)

</l>
<l>I fell off the curb till I found you

</l>
<l>You got what it takes baby, to pull through

</l>
<l>Help the poor

</l>
<l>Oh, baby won't you help poor me (chorus: sha-lala-lala-la)



</l>
<l>I'm in trouble don't you see (chorus: sha-lala-lala-la)

</l>
<l>Only your love can save me (chorus: sha-lala-lala-la)

</l>
<l>Help the poor, help the poor (chorus: sha-lala-lala-la)</l></lyrics></xml>
