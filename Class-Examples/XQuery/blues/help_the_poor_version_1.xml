<lyrics>



Help the poor (chorus: help the poor)

Won't you help poor me (chorus: help poor me)

I need help from you baby

Need it desperately (chorus: I need help)

I need you so much

I need you're care

I need all the loving baby you can spare

Help the poor

Oh, baby help poor me (chorus: sha-lala-lala-la)



Say you will

Say you'll help me on

I can't make it no further

In this world alone

Baby I'm beggin' with tears in my eyes

For your loving, don't you realize

I need help, oh baby

Help poor me



You are my inspiration (chorus: sha-lala-lala-la)

You could make me be a king

But if you don't come to my rescue (chorus: sha-lala-lala-la)

I couldn't ever be anything



Help the poor (chorus: help the poor)

Baby help poor me (chorus: help poor me)

Have a heart won't you baby

Listening to my plea (chorus: I need help)

I fell off the curb till I found you

You got what it takes baby, to pull through

Help the poor

Oh, baby won't you help poor me (chorus: sha-lala-lala-la)



I'm in trouble don't you see (chorus: sha-lala-lala-la)

Only your love can save me (chorus: sha-lala-lala-la)

Help the poor, help the poor (chorus: sha-lala-lala-la)
