<lyrics>



Well now, I told my man, way up in Dundee

Lord, I told my man, way up in Dundee

Well now, you go down to Mr. Howard Stovall's place, he got all the
Burr Clover you need



Well now, the reason I love, that old Burr Clover Farm, so well

Yeah now .the reason I love, that old Burr Clover Farm, so well

Well now, we always have money and we never raise no hell



Well now I'm leavin' this mo'nin', sho do hate to go, yeah babe

Lord, I'm leavin' this mo'nin' , an I sho' do hate to go

Well now, I've got to leave that Burr Clover Farm, I ain't comin'
back here no mo'



Play that boy! Yeah told you I was leavin' at 4 o'clock this
mo'nin'



Now goodbye ev'rybody, an I may not come back down

I said goodbye ev'rybody, an I may not come back down

Well now I gotta leave that Burr Clover Farm, my baby don't want me
around



Well so long, so long, you gonna need my help, I say

So long, so long, you gonna need my help, I say

Well now I'm gonna sell ya some Burr Clover honey, just before I go
away
