<lyrics>



Oh, my Monday woman

Starch and iron my clothes

Monday woman

Starch and iron my clothes

My Tuesday woman

Pays my room rent and board



Oh, my Wednesday woman

Buys my hat and shoes

Wednesday woman

Buys my hat and shoes

And my Thursday woman

Woman always singin' the blues



Well, I feel like jumpin'

From the treetop to the ground

Feel like jumpin'

From the treetop to the ground

Because my friday woman

Woman just talks all the time



Well, I don't want no woman

Got to give my money to

Don't need no woman

I got to give my money to

She'll spend it all on a bar

The woman don't mean no good
