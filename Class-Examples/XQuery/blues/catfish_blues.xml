<lyrics>



Well, I wish I was a catfish

Swimmin' in the deep blue sea

I'd have all you women

Fishin' after me

Fishin' after me

Fishin' after me



Well, I'm broke and I'm hungry

Ragged and I'm dirty too

Well, if I clean up, baby, can I

Stay home with you

Stay home with you

Stay home with you



If I can't, can't come in

Let me sit down front of your door

I'll leave so early, your

Mom won't know

Won't never know

Won't never know



Oh, I know, know my baby

Well, she's going to jump and shout

When my train pulls in and I

I come walkin' out

Come walkin' out

Come walkin' out



Yes, I'm goin', babe I'm goin'

And your crying won't make me stay

Oh, the more you cry, baby

More I'll go away

More I'll go away

More I'll go away



Well now I know, I know you don't want me

Why in the world won't you tell me so?

Then I won't be caught, baby, 'round

Your house no more

Your house no more

Your house no more
