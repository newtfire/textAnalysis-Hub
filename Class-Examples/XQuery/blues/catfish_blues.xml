<lyrics>


<l>Well, I wish I was a catfish

</l>
<l>Swimmin' in the deep blue sea

</l>
<l>I'd have all you women

</l>
<l>Fishin' after me

</l>
<l>Fishin' after me

</l>
<l>Fishin' after me



</l>
<l>Well, I'm broke and I'm hungry

</l>
<l>Ragged and I'm dirty too

</l>
<l>Well, if I clean up, baby, can I

</l>
<l>Stay home with you

</l>
<l>Stay home with you

</l>
<l>Stay home with you



</l>
<l>If I can't, can't come in

</l>
<l>Let me sit down front of your door

</l>
<l>I'll leave so early, your

</l>
<l>Mom won't know

</l>
<l>Won't never know

</l>
<l>Won't never know



</l>
<l>Oh, I know, know my baby

</l>
<l>Well, she's going to jump and shout

</l>
<l>When my train pulls in and I

</l>
<l>I come walkin' out

</l>
<l>Come walkin' out

</l>
<l>Come walkin' out



</l>
<l>Yes, I'm goin', babe I'm goin'

</l>
<l>And your crying won't make me stay

</l>
<l>Oh, the more you cry, baby

</l>
<l>More I'll go away

</l>
<l>More I'll go away

</l>
<l>More I'll go away



</l>
<l>Well now I know, I know you don't want me

</l>
<l>Why in the world won't you tell me so?

</l>
<l>Then I won't be caught, baby, 'round

</l>
<l>Your house no more

</l>
<l>Your house no more

</l>
<l>Your house no more</l></lyrics></xml>
