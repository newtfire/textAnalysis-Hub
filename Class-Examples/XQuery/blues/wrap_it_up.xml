<lyrics>


<l>I've been watchin' you for days now baby

</l>
<l>I just love your sexy ways now baby

</l>
<l>Ya know our love will never stop now baby

</l>
<l>Just put your lovin' in my box now baby



</l>
<l>Chorus 2x



</l>
<l>Well no more will I shop around now baby

</l>
<l>I know I got the best thing in town now baby

</l>
<l>I've seen all I want to see now baby

</l>
<l>Bring your lovin' straight to me now baby



</l>
<l>Chorus 4x



</l>
<l>Well I'm gonna treat you like the queen you are

</l>
<l>Bring you sweet things from my candy jar

</l>
<l>You've got tricks you ain't never used

</l>
<l>Give it, give it to me, it won't be abused



</l>
<l>I've been watchin' you for days now baby

</l>
<l>I just love your sexy ways now baby

</l>
<l>Ya know our love will never stop now baby

</l>
<l>Just put your lovin' in my box now baby



</l>
<l>Chorus 4x</l></lyrics></xml>
