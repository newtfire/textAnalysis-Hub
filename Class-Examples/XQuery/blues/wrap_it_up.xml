<lyrics>



I've been watchin' you for days now baby

I just love your sexy ways now baby

Ya know our love will never stop now baby

Just put your lovin' in my box now baby



Chorus 2x



Well no more will I shop around now baby

I know I got the best thing in town now baby

I've seen all I want to see now baby

Bring your lovin' straight to me now baby



Chorus 4x



Well I'm gonna treat you like the queen you are

Bring you sweet things from my candy jar

You've got tricks you ain't never used

Give it, give it to me, it won't be abused



I've been watchin' you for days now baby

I just love your sexy ways now baby

Ya know our love will never stop now baby

Just put your lovin' in my box now baby



Chorus 4x
