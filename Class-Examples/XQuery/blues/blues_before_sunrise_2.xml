<lyrics>



Blues before sunrise, tears standing in my eyes

Blues before sunrise, with tears standing in my eyes

Such a 
harbored
 feeling, boys, I do despise



I have to leave, leave you baby, because you know you done me
wrong

I have to leave you baby, because you know you done me wrong

I'm gonna pack up and leave you darling and break up my happy
home



I have to leave, leave you baby, I'm gonna leave you all alone

I'm gonna leave you baby, I'm gonna leave you all alone

I'm gonna pack up and leave you darling, because you know you done me
wrong



Well now goodbye, goodbye baby, I'll see you on some rainy day

Well now goodbye baby, I'll see you on some rainy day

You can go ahead now little darling, 'cause I want you to have your
way
