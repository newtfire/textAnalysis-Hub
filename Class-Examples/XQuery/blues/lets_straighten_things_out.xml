<lyrics>


<l>Sit yourself down, girl

</l>
<l>And talk to me

</l>
<l>Tell me what's on your mind

</l>
<l>Don't keep saying

</l>
<l>Everything's ok, baby

</l>
<l>'Cause if it was, girl

</l>
<l>You wouldn't be crying



</l>
<l>You've been tossing and turning

</l>
<l>In your sleep lately, baby

</l>
<l>Sitting around crying all day long

</l>
<l>Now how in hell do you expect me

</l>
<l>To understand, baby

</l>
<l>When I don't even know what's wrong



</l>
<l>Let's straighten it out

</l>
<l>Let's straighten it out

</l>
<l>Let's straighten it out

</l>
<l>Let's straighten it out, baby



</l>
<l>Well the last five nights

</l>
<l>When we went to bed

</l>
<l>Oh I could tell something wasn't right

</l>
<l>When you turned your back

</l>
<l>And you covered your head, baby

</l>
<l>You didn't even say goodnight



</l>
<l>Now if you're tired

</l>
<l>And you don't wanna be bothered, baby

</l>
<l>Just say the word

</l>
<l>And I'll leave you alone

</l>
<l>Instead of lying there

</l>
<l>Crying your eyes out

</l>
<l>You and me oughta be getting it on



</l>
<l>Let's straighten it out

</l>
<l>Let's straighten it out, baby

</l>
<l>Let's straighten it out

</l>
<l>Let's straighten it out

</l>
<l>Please let's straighten it out, baby

</l>
<l>Let's straighten it out

</l>
<l>Let's straighten it out

</l>
<l>Let's straighten it out now, baby</l></lyrics></xml>
