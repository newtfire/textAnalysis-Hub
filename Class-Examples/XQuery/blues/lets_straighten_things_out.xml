<lyrics>



Sit yourself down, girl

And talk to me

Tell me what's on your mind

Don't keep saying

Everything's ok, baby

'Cause if it was, girl

You wouldn't be crying



You've been tossing and turning

In your sleep lately, baby

Sitting around crying all day long

Now how in hell do you expect me

To understand, baby

When I don't even know what's wrong



Let's straighten it out

Let's straighten it out

Let's straighten it out

Let's straighten it out, baby



Well the last five nights

When we went to bed

Oh I could tell something wasn't right

When you turned your back

And you covered your head, baby

You didn't even say goodnight



Now if you're tired

And you don't wanna be bothered, baby

Just say the word

And I'll leave you alone

Instead of lying there

Crying your eyes out

You and me oughta be getting it on



Let's straighten it out

Let's straighten it out, baby

Let's straighten it out

Let's straighten it out

Please let's straighten it out, baby

Let's straighten it out

Let's straighten it out

Let's straighten it out now, baby
