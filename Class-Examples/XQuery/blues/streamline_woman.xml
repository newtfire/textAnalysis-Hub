<lyrics>


<l>Well I've been workin' on the high line, baby, all day and night

</l>
<l>Yes, I've been workin' on the high line, baby, all day and night

</l>
<l>I got a streamline woman. She makes my electro kick off right



</l>
<l>Well now, if you want to be my little girl,

</l>
<l>You said you really wanna be in the mood

</l>
<l>You'd mind me to so proper, when you're blue



</l>
<l>Child I've been workin' on the high line, baby, all day and night

</l>
<l>You know you're my streamline woman. You make my electro kick off
right

</l>
<l>What kind of woman is that? All right, man



</l>
<l>Well now, you know I want you to pull down your windows, baby

</l>
<l>Pull down your window blinds, so your next door neighbor, little
girl

</l>
<l>Won't hear that old troubadour whine</l></lyrics></xml>
