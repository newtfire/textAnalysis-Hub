<lyrics>



Well I've been workin' on the high line, baby, all day and night

Yes, I've been workin' on the high line, baby, all day and night

I got a streamline woman. She makes my electro kick off right



Well now, if you want to be my little girl,

You said you really wanna be in the mood

You'd mind me to so proper, when you're blue



Child I've been workin' on the high line, baby, all day and night

You know you're my streamline woman. You make my electro kick off
right

What kind of woman is that? All right, man



Well now, you know I want you to pull down your windows, baby

Pull down your window blinds, so your next door neighbor, little
girl

Won't hear that old troubadour whine
