<lyrics>


<l>Let me tell you how and why what no-good man done to me

</l>
<l>He called me pretty, young and wild, after that he let me be

</l>
<l>He'd taken advantage of my mouth, and that you understand

</l>
<l>So, wait a while, show you, chile, just how to treat a no-good

man




</l>
<l>Make him stay at home, wash and iron,

</l>
<l>tell all the neighbors he done lost his mind

</l>
<l>Give your house rent shake
1
 </l><l>on Saturday night</l>
<l>
Monday morning you'll hold collectors good and tight

</l>
<l>You see a man you really like

</l>
<l>Let him bite that monkey, brother, in his back

</l>
<l>When his cruel heart turn, his love breaks down

</l>
<l>hold him where you got him make him stay in town,

</l>
<l>'cause I'm a safety woman, lookin' for a safety man



</l>
<l>Make him stay at home, help me wash and iron,

</l>
<l>the neighbors know he done lost his mind

</l>
<l>I give a house rent shake on Saturday night

</l>
<l>Monday morning I held collectors good and tight

</l>
<l>I seen a man I really like

</l>
<l>I let him bite that monkey, brother, smack in his back

</l>
<l>When his cruel heart turn, his love breaks down

</l>
<l>I hold it where I had it and he stayed in town,

</l>
<l>I'm a safety woman, and I had to have a safety man



</l>
<l>I ain't good lookin', I'm built for speed

</l>
<l>I've got ev'rything a pigmeat needs

</l>
<l>'Cause I'm a safety woman, lookin' for a safety man



</l>
