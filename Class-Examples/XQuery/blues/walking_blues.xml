<lyrics>



Woke up this morning, up this morning

With my head bowed down, hey, hey, hey

Woke up this morning with my head bowed down

I had that mean old feeling, I was in the wrong man's town



Mailman's been here, mailman's been here

But didn't leave no news, hey, hey, hey

Mailman's been here but didn't leave no news

That's the reason why mama's got the walking blues



Walked and walked till I, walked and walked

I almost lost my mind, hey, hey, hey

Walked and walked till I almost lost my mind

I was afraid to stop walking 'cause I might lose some time



Got a short time to make it, short time to make it

And a long ways to go, Lord, Lord, Lord

Short time to make it and a long way to go

Trying to find the town they call San Antonio



Thought I'd rest me, thought I'd rest me

I couldn't hear no news, Lord, Lord, Lord

Thought I'd rest me, I couldn't hear no news

I'll soon be there 'cause I got the walking blues
