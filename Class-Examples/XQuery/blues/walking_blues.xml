<l>Woke up this morning, up this morning

</l>
<l>With my head bowed down, hey, hey, hey

</l>
<l>Woke up this morning with my head bowed down

</l>
<l>I had that mean old feeling, I was in the wrong man's town



</l>
<l>Mailman's been here, mailman's been here

</l>
<l>But didn't leave no news, hey, hey, hey

</l>
<l>Mailman's been here but didn't leave no news

</l>
<l>That's the reason why mama's got the walking blues



</l>
<l>Walked and walked till I, walked and walked

</l>
<l>I almost lost my mind, hey, hey, hey

</l>
<l>Walked and walked till I almost lost my mind

</l>
<l>I was afraid to stop walking 'cause I might lose some time



</l>
<l>Got a short time to make it, short time to make it

</l>
<l>And a long ways to go, Lord, Lord, Lord

</l>
<l>Short time to make it and a long way to go

</l>
<l>Trying to find the town they call San Antonio



</l>
<l>Thought I'd rest me, thought I'd rest me

</l>
<l>I couldn't hear no news, Lord, Lord, Lord

</l>
<l>Thought I'd rest me, I couldn't hear no news

</l>
<l>I'll soon be there 'cause I got the walking blues</l></lyrics></xml>
