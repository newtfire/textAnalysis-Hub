<lyrics>



I am sitting here thinking and your thoughts make me feel so
sad

I am sitting here thinking and your thoughts make me feel so sad

I've searched eleven long years for love, yeah, searchin' for
something I already had



When I think of what the old folks say, I can't help but cry

When I think of what the old folks say, umm, I can't help but cry

They have told me so often, you never miss your water, 'til the well
goes dry



From now on, I'll try and do the things I should

From now on, I'll try and do the things I should

Let's take a chance on that old sayin', it's never too late to be
good
