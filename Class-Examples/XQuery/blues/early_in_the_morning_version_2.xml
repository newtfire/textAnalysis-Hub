<lyrics>



It's early in the morning and I can't get right

'Cause I had a little date with my baby last night



Now it's early in the morning

It's early in the morning

It's early in the morning

And I ain't got nothin' but the blues



I went to all the places where we used to go

I went to her house but she don't live there no more



And it's early in the morning

It's early in the morning

It's early in the morning

And I ain't got nothin' but the blues

I went to her girlfriend's house, but she was out

I knocked on her door and her mother started to shout

"Get away from here!"



Too early in the morning

It's early in the morning

It's early in the morning

And I ain't got nothin' but the blues



Went to Jenny Lou's to get something to eat

The waitress looked at me, she said, "B., you sure look beat"

It's early in the morning, baby

Early in the morning

It's early in the morning

And I ain't got nothin' but the blues



Had a lot of money when I first started out

I couldn't find my baby, now my money's run out



Now it's early in the morning

It's early in the morning

It's early in the morning

And I ain't got nothin' but the blues



It's early in the morning

I ain't got nothin' but the blues
