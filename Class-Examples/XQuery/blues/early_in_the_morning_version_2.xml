<lyrics>


<l>It's early in the morning and I can't get right

</l>
<l>'Cause I had a little date with my baby last night



</l>
<l>Now it's early in the morning

</l>
<l>It's early in the morning

</l>
<l>It's early in the morning

</l>
<l>And I ain't got nothin' but the blues



</l>
<l>I went to all the places where we used to go

</l>
<l>I went to her house but she don't live there no more



</l>
<l>And it's early in the morning

</l>
<l>It's early in the morning

</l>
<l>It's early in the morning

</l>
<l>And I ain't got nothin' but the blues

</l>
<l>I went to her girlfriend's house, but she was out

</l>
<l>I knocked on her door and her mother started to shout

</l>
<l>"Get away from here!"



</l>
<l>Too early in the morning

</l>
<l>It's early in the morning

</l>
<l>It's early in the morning

</l>
<l>And I ain't got nothin' but the blues



</l>
<l>Went to Jenny Lou's to get something to eat

</l>
<l>The waitress looked at me, she said, "B., you sure look beat"

</l>
<l>It's early in the morning, baby

</l>
<l>Early in the morning

</l>
<l>It's early in the morning

</l>
<l>And I ain't got nothin' but the blues



</l>
<l>Had a lot of money when I first started out

</l>
<l>I couldn't find my baby, now my money's run out



</l>
<l>Now it's early in the morning

</l>
<l>It's early in the morning

</l>
<l>It's early in the morning

</l>
<l>And I ain't got nothin' but the blues



</l>
<l>It's early in the morning

</l>
<l>I ain't got nothin' but the blues</l></lyrics></xml>
