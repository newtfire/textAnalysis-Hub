<lyrics>



When that midnight hour went chiming, I was in my room alone

Yes, when that midnight hour went chiming, I was in my room alone

Yes, and when I came home this evening, I found my baby gone



Oh, I laid my head on my pillow, I gazed up at the stars up above

Yes, I laid my head on my pillow, yes, lookin' up at the stars
above

I tell you it's a miserable feeling, oh, when you lose the one you
love



Oh, I get the blues at midnight, oh there's one thing I can't
describe

Oh, I get the blues at midnight, oh there's one thing I can't
describe

Yes, and when you look at your baby's picture, oh, tears will come
from your eyes
