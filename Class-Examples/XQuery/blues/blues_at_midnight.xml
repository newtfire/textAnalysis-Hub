<lyrics>


<l>When that midnight hour went chiming, I was in my room alone

</l>
<l>Yes, when that midnight hour went chiming, I was in my room alone

</l>
<l>Yes, and when I came home this evening, I found my baby gone



</l>
<l>Oh, I laid my head on my pillow, I gazed up at the stars up above

</l>
<l>Yes, I laid my head on my pillow, yes, lookin' up at the stars
above

</l>
<l>I tell you it's a miserable feeling, oh, when you lose the one you

love




</l>
<l>Oh, I get the blues at midnight, oh there's one thing I can't
describe

</l>
<l>Oh, I get the blues at midnight, oh there's one thing I can't
describe

</l><l>Yes, and when you look at your baby's picture, oh, tears will come</l>
<l>from your eyes</l></lyrics></xml>
