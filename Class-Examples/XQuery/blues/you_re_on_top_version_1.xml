<lyrics>



Yes, you're on the top now baby, but don't nothing stay the same

You're on the top now baby, but don't nothing stay the same

Every now and then baby, lady luck deal another hand



You're calling me your pal now, when I used to be your man

Oh, you're calling me your pal now baby, when I used to be your
man

Well, you're flying real high now baby, go on and raise your sand



Oh, I realize now baby, that your kind of love wasn't true

Hey, I realize now baby, your kind of love won't do

And what you could have been baby, and all I feel through
