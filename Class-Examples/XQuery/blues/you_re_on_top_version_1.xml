<l>Yes, you're on the top now baby, but don't nothing stay the same

</l>
<l>You're on the top now baby, but don't nothing stay the same

</l>
<l>Every now and then baby, lady luck deal another hand



</l>
<l>You're calling me your pal now, when I used to be your man

</l>
<l>Oh, you're calling me your pal now baby, when I used to be your
man

</l>
<l>Well, you're flying real high now baby, go on and raise your sand



</l>
<l>Oh, I realize now baby, that your kind of love wasn't true

</l>
<l>Hey, I realize now baby, your kind of love won't do

</l>
<l>And what you could have been baby, and all I feel through</l></lyrics></xml>
