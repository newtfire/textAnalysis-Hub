Roosevelt is a mighty fine man, darlin'

Roosevelt is a mighty fine man, darlin'

Roosevelt is a mighty fine man

Gonna be the president all by land (?), darlin'



My baby got a diamond ring, darlin'

My baby got a diamond ring, darlin'

My baby got a diamond ring

Poor me ain't got a doggone thing, darlin'



My baby got a Cadillac Eight, darlin'

My baby got a Cadillac Eight, darlin'

My baby got a Cadillac Eight

Poor me ain't got nowhere to stay, darlin'



My baby got a house 'n' lot, darlin'

My baby got a house 'n' lot, darlin'

My baby got a house 'n' lot

Poor me ain't got diddley-squat, darlin'




Moonshine
 been here
long enough, darlin'

Moonshine been here long enough, darlin'

Moonshine been here long enough

(...?...) drink of that stuff (?), darlin'



Come all the way from Arkansas, darlin'

Come all the way from Arkansas, darlin'

Come all the way from Arkansas

(...?...) barnyard dog (?), darlin'



Ten-dollar bill and a bottle of beer, darlin'

Ten-dollar bill and a bottle of beer, darlin'

Ten-dollar bill and a bottle of beer

I wish to God my honey was here, darlin'



I got a gal from the white folks' yard, darlin'

I got a gal from the white folks' yard, darlin'

I got a gal from the white folks' yard

She don't drink liquor but she do play card, darlin'
