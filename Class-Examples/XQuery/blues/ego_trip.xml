<lyrics>



Tryin' to tell you baby, about your trip

Ev'rytime I talk to ya baby, Lord, you give me that lip

I know what you mean, baby yeah, about your past

Ev'rytime I talk to you baby yeah, you ain't got no class



(You're on an ego trip)

(You're on an ego trip)

(You're on an ego trip)

(You're on an ego trip)



Ow!

Take ya downtown, to get me a pair of shoes

Come back home girl, Lord, talkin' like a fool

Sometimes baby, yeah, you don't have no class

Cheap old talkin' girl, Lord, I'm gonna get on your ass



(You're on an ego trip) ha

(You're on an ego trip)

(You're on an ego trip)

(You're on an ego trip) yeah, yeah



Ow!

I been knowin' about your trip baby, yeah

It come to pass

Ev'ry time I talk to you baby, Lord

You give me that mess



(You're on an ego trip) ha

(You're on an ego trip) that girl

(You're on an ego trip) yeah

(You're on an ego trip)



(Spoken:

"You got that old ego goin' on"



"Gotta school you next week"



"An' I told you to get yourself together now"



"So you can get me them shoes"



"Ya ain't come back wit' 'em yet"



Fading:

"What?"



"I told you 'bout that talkin' back"



"What?"
