<lyrics>



Be careful what you're drivin', man

That Cadillac may get away, you better be careful!



There standin' the highway man, standin' parked on the road

There standin' there highway man, parked on the road

You better watch out for the red light, just before you go



Green light says go, red light says stop

Look-a-here boy, you better be on your watch

There's standin' a highway man, parked on the side of the road

You better be careful, 'bout how you drive on the road

Stop!



I love the Cadillac, long wreckin' machine

I love a Cadillac, it's a long wreckin' machine

Me an my baby can ride it, ev'rything is nice 'til then

(Yeah!)



I'll make a cool hundred, I ain't got time to stop for gas

I'll make a cool hundred, I ain't got time to stop for gas

I'm gonna drive this automobile, just as long as the gas lasts

(Play it!)



Look-it-here man, please check this oil

Look-it here man, please check this oil

Just a long Cadillac, bound to try out your soil
