<lyrics>


<l>Be careful what you're drivin', man

</l>
<l>That Cadillac may get away, you better be careful!



</l>
<l>There standin' the highway man, standin' parked on the road

</l>
<l>There standin' there highway man, parked on the road

</l>
<l>You better watch out for the red light, just before you go



</l>
<l>Green light says go, red light says stop

</l>
<l>Look-a-here boy, you better be on your watch

</l>
<l>There's standin' a highway man, parked on the side of the road

</l>
<l>You better be careful, 'bout how you drive on the road

</l>
<l>Stop!



</l>
<l>I love the Cadillac, long wreckin' machine

</l>
<l>I love a Cadillac, it's a long wreckin' machine

</l>
<l>Me an my baby can ride it, ev'rything is nice 'til then

</l>
<l>(Yeah!)



</l>
<l>I'll make a cool hundred, I ain't got time to stop for gas

</l>
<l>I'll make a cool hundred, I ain't got time to stop for gas

</l>
<l>I'm gonna drive this automobile, just as long as the gas lasts

</l>
<l>(Play it!)



</l>
<l>Look-it-here man, please check this oil

</l>
<l>Look-it here man, please check this oil

</l>
<l>Just a long Cadillac, bound to try out your soil



</l>
