<lyrics>


<l>Well I don't live like a king

</l>
<l>And I don't drive a big car

</l>
<l>The gypsy woman was right

</l>
<l>When she said I would go far



</l>
<l>Just wait on time baby

</l>
<l>I'll be there one day

</l>
<l>Yeah, and until I get there baby

</l>
<l>All I can do is hope and pray



</l>
<l>Well you say you'll stick with me baby

</l>
<l>Stick with me through thick and thin

</l>
<l>I know someday baby

</l>
<l>My bad luck has got to end



</l>
<l>Just wait on me baby

</l>
<l>I'll be there one day

</l>
<l>Yes, and until I get there baby

</l>
<l>All I can do is hope and pray



</l>
<l>Well you say you'll stick with me baby

</l>
<l>Stick with me through thick and thin

</l>
<l>I know someday baby

</l>
<l>My bad luck has got to end



</l>
<l>Just wait on time baby

</l>
<l>I'll be there one day

</l>
<l>Yes, and until I get there baby

</l>
<l>All I can do is hope and pray



</l>
<l>Well I live the life I love

</l>
<l>And I love the life I live

</l>
<l>The life I live baby

</l>
<l>Is all I have to give



</l>
<l>So just wait on me baby

</l>
<l>We'll be there one day

</l>
<l>Yes, and until I get there baby

</l>
<l>All I can do is hope and pray



</l>
<l>Well, you just got to wait on time baby

</l>
<l>Yes, just wait on time baby

</l>
<l>Yeah-heah, be good to me baby

</l>
<l>Because until I get there baby

</l>
<l>All I can do is hope and pray</l></lyrics></xml>
