<lyrics>



Well I don't live like a king

And I don't drive a big car

The gypsy woman was right

When she said I would go far



Just wait on time baby

I'll be there one day

Yeah, and until I get there baby

All I can do is hope and pray



Well you say you'll stick with me baby

Stick with me through thick and thin

I know someday baby

My bad luck has got to end



Just wait on me baby

I'll be there one day

Yes, and until I get there baby

All I can do is hope and pray



Well you say you'll stick with me baby

Stick with me through thick and thin

I know someday baby

My bad luck has got to end



Just wait on time baby

I'll be there one day

Yes, and until I get there baby

All I can do is hope and pray



Well I live the life I love

And I love the life I live

The life I live baby

Is all I have to give



So just wait on me baby

We'll be there one day

Yes, and until I get there baby

All I can do is hope and pray



Well, you just got to wait on time baby

Yes, just wait on time baby

Yeah-heah, be good to me baby

Because until I get there baby

All I can do is hope and pray
