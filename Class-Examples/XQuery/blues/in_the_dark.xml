<lyrics>


<l>I heard you was out, high as you could be

</l>
<l>Kissin' another fella, and you know it wasn't me

</l>
<l>That ain't right, no no no, that ain't right

</l>
<l>What goes on in the dark, will soon come to light



</l>
<l>They say you whispered low, an' spendin' all of my dough

</l>
<l>You told that fella things, you never told me before

</l>
<l>That ain't right, no no no, that ain't right

</l>
<l>What goes on in the dark, will soon come to light



</l>
<l>One of these days, just you wait and see

</l>
<l>Baby you'll realize, the way you're treating me

</l>
<l>That ain't right, no no no, that ain't right

</l>
<l>What goes on in the dark, will soon come to light</l></lyrics></xml>
