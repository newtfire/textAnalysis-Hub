<lyrics>



I heard you was out, high as you could be

Kissin' another fella, and you know it wasn't me

That ain't right, no no no, that ain't right

What goes on in the dark, will soon come to light



They say you whispered low, an' spendin' all of my dough

You told that fella things, you never told me before

That ain't right, no no no, that ain't right

What goes on in the dark, will soon come to light



One of these days, just you wait and see

Baby you'll realize, the way you're treating me

That ain't right, no no no, that ain't right

What goes on in the dark, will soon come to light
