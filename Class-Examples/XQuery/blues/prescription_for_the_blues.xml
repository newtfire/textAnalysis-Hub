<lyrics>


<l>All day long I'm worried, all night long I'm blue

</l>
<l>I'm so awfully lonesome, I don't know what to do

</l>
<l>So I ask you doctor, see if you can't find

</l>
<l>Something in your satchel to satisfy my mind

</l>
<l>Doctor, doctor, write me a prescription for the blues

</l>
<l>The wearied blues



</l>
<l>Let me tell you doctor, why I'm in misery

</l>
<l>Once I had a lover, he went away from me

</l>
<l>Sent to see the gypsy, 
voodoo

</l>
<l>doctors too

</l>
<l>Shook their heads and told me, nothing they could do

</l>
<l>Doctor, doctor, write me a prescription for the blues

</l>
<l>The mean old blues



</l>
<l>Like a little baby, all day long I cry

</l>
<l>And if you can't cure me, I just am sure to die

</l>
<l>Give me something, poison, doctor won't you please

</l>
<l>Then I'll sign a paper: died with the heart's disease

</l>
<l>Doctor, doctor, write me a prescription for the blues

</l><l>The plain old blues</l></lyrics></xml>
