<lyrics>



I've got a street walkin' woman, she stays tall an twisted all the
time

I've got a street walkin' woman, she stays tall an twisted all the
time

She goes to bed with a fifth of whiskey an she wakes up with a jug
a-wine



She leaves home early in the mo'nin', then she don't come back until
the sun's goin' down

She leaves home in the mo'nin', an' she don't come back until the sun
is goin' down

She's always got her whiskey up to her mouth, and her face full of
ugly frown



I work hard everyday, try to make ends meet

I work hard everyday an try to make ends meet

All that woman wants to do, is keep her big feet in the street



I love my street walkin' woman, she walks the avenue up and down

I love my street walkin' woman, she walks the avenue up and down

Sometime I wish she would start ta walkin', an' keep on walkin' outta
town
