<lyrics>


<l>I've got a street walkin' woman, she stays tall an twisted all the
time

</l>
<l>I've got a street walkin' woman, she stays tall an twisted all the
time

</l>
<l>She goes to bed with a fifth of whiskey an she wakes up with a jug

a-wine




</l>
<l>She leaves home early in the mo'nin', then she don't come back until
the sun's goin' down

</l>
<l>She leaves home in the mo'nin', an' she don't come back until the sun
is goin' down

</l>
<l>She's always got her whiskey up to her mouth, and her face full of

ugly frown




</l>
<l>I work hard everyday, try to make ends meet

</l>
<l>I work hard everyday an try to make ends meet

</l>
<l>All that woman wants to do, is keep her big feet in the street



</l>
<l>I love my street walkin' woman, she walks the avenue up and down

</l>
<l>I love my street walkin' woman, she walks the avenue up and down

</l><l>Sometime I wish she would start ta walkin', an' keep on walkin' outta</l>
<l>town</l></lyrics></xml>
