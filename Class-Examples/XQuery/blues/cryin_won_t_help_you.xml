<l>Oh, no matter what you say baby, no matter what you do

</l>
<l>The way you've been treating me woman,

</l>
<l>is coming back home to you

</l>
<l>And your crying won't help you woman

</l>
<l>Oh, crying won't help you baby

</l>
<l>Oh, crying won't help you woman

</l>
<l>'Cause you've been so mean to me



</l>
<l>Oh, you must remember baby, no matter where you go

</l>
<l>Watch those seeds just scatter woman,

</l>
<l>because you're gonna reap just what you sow

</l>
<l>And your crying won't help you woman

</l>
<l>Oh, crying won't help you now

</l>
<l>Oh, crying won't help you baby

</l>
<l>'Cause you been so mean to me



</l>
<l>Oh, the way you've been treating me woman,

</l>
<l>just can't understand

</l>
<l>Oh, I'm gonna leave you woman,

</l>
<l>let you do the best you can

</l>
<l>And your crying won't help you woman

</l>
<l>Oh, crying won't help you now

</l>
<l>Oh, crying won't help you woman

</l>
<l>'Cause you been so mean to me

</l>
<l>Look out!



</l>
<l>Oh, just before I leave you woman,

</l>
<l>just before I shake your hand

</l>
<l>I'm gonna get me a woman baby,

</l>
<l>not to get you mad

</l>
<l>And your crying won't help you woman

</l>
<l>Oh, crying won't help you now

</l>
<l>Oh, crying won't help you baby

</l>
<l>'Cause you been so mean to me</l></lyrics></xml>
