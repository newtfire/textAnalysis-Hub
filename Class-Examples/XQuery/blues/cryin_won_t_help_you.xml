<lyrics>



Oh, no matter what you say baby, no matter what you do

The way you've been treating me woman,

is coming back home to you

And your crying won't help you woman

Oh, crying won't help you baby

Oh, crying won't help you woman

'Cause you've been so mean to me



Oh, you must remember baby, no matter where you go

Watch those seeds just scatter woman,

because you're gonna reap just what you sow

And your crying won't help you woman

Oh, crying won't help you now

Oh, crying won't help you baby

'Cause you been so mean to me



Oh, the way you've been treating me woman,

just can't understand

Oh, I'm gonna leave you woman,

let you do the best you can

And your crying won't help you woman

Oh, crying won't help you now

Oh, crying won't help you woman

'Cause you been so mean to me

Look out!



Oh, just before I leave you woman,

just before I shake your hand

I'm gonna get me a woman baby,

not to get you mad

And your crying won't help you woman

Oh, crying won't help you now

Oh, crying won't help you baby

'Cause you been so mean to me
