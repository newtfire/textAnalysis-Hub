<lyrics>



I want your hi fi mama, won't you let me play it tonight

I want your hi fi mama, won't you let me play it tonight

I put the needle in the groove, baby while you douse the lights



I play it on your dresser, play it upside your wall

I play it in your kitchen, even play it in your hall

I play it anywhere you want it, any old time at all



Hi fi lo fi no fi's just fine with me

Hi fi lo fi no fi's just fine with me

And if you want to give me stereo first give me vitamin E

I got your name and your number
