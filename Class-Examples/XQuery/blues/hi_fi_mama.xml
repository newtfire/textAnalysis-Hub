<lyrics>


<l>I want your hi fi mama, won't you let me play it tonight

</l>
<l>I want your hi fi mama, won't you let me play it tonight

</l>
<l>I put the needle in the groove, baby while you douse the lights



</l>
<l>I play it on your dresser, play it upside your wall

</l>
<l>I play it in your kitchen, even play it in your hall

</l>
<l>I play it anywhere you want it, any old time at all



</l>
<l>Hi fi lo fi no fi's just fine with me

</l>
<l>Hi fi lo fi no fi's just fine with me

</l>
<l>And if you want to give me stereo first give me vitamin E

</l>
<l>I got your name and your number</l></lyrics></xml>
