<l>Why not, why not darling

</l>
<l>I don't understand

</l>
<l>Why not let me be your regular man



</l>
<l>Why not, why not baby

</l>
<l>You know you done me wrong

</l>
<l>Why not let me love you all night long



</l>
<l>I love you baby, you know that's true

</l>
<l>Give you all money

</l>
<l>What more can I do?



</l>
<l>Why not, why not darling

</l>
<l>Why not I don't know

</l>
<l>Why not let me be your daddy-o



</l>
<l>I love you baby, you know that's true

</l>
<l>Give you all my money

</l>
<l>What more can I do?



</l>
<l>Why not, why not darlin'

</l>
<l>Why not I don't know

</l>
<l>Why not let me love you anymore?</l></lyrics></xml>
