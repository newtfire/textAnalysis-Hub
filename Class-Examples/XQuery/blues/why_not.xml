<lyrics>



Why not, why not darling

I don't understand

Why not let me be your regular man



Why not, why not baby

You know you done me wrong

Why not let me love you all night long



I love you baby, you know that's true

Give you all money

What more can I do?



Why not, why not darling

Why not I don't know

Why not let me be your daddy-o



I love you baby, you know that's true

Give you all my money

What more can I do?



Why not, why not darlin'

Why not I don't know

Why not let me love you anymore?
