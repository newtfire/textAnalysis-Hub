<lyrics>


<l>Takin' it easy, moving slow

</l>
<l>It's always calm just before the storm, you know

</l>
<l>Along she came, with a brand new season

</l>
<l>Since we've been together

</l>
<l>There's been a change in the weather



</l>
<l>(Chorus:)

</l>
<l>She's a rainmaker

</l>
<l>She makes the rain fall from my eyes

</l>
<l>She's a rainmaker

</l>
<l>She makes a grown man wanna cry



</l>
<l>Well, I never thought

</l>
<l>That a tear could fall

</l>
<l>From the eyes of a man

</l>
<l>Who never even cried at all

</l>
<l>Now, I've been happy

</l>
<l>I've been blue

</l>
<l>For the change in the season



</l>
<l>(Chorus)



</l>
<l>The lightning flashes, the thunder roars

</l>
<l>There's no stoppin' the wind

</l>
<l>The tide is washing

</l>
<l>Her a path to my door

</l>
<l>I've never ever loved like this before



</l>
<l>Storm is over, the sun is bright

</l>
<l>There's a rainbow in my life

</l>
<l>Clouds are gone, the sky is clear

</l>
<l>And since we've been together

</l>
<l>There's been a change in the weather



</l>
<l>(Chorus 2x)</l></lyrics></xml>
