<lyrics>



Takin' it easy, moving slow

It's always calm just before the storm, you know

Along she came, with a brand new season

Since we've been together

There's been a change in the weather



(Chorus:)

She's a rainmaker

She makes the rain fall from my eyes

She's a rainmaker

She makes a grown man wanna cry



Well, I never thought

That a tear could fall

From the eyes of a man

Who never even cried at all

Now, I've been happy

I've been blue

For the change in the season



(Chorus)



The lightning flashes, the thunder roars

There's no stoppin' the wind

The tide is washing

Her a path to my door

I've never ever loved like this before



Storm is over, the sun is bright

There's a rainbow in my life

Clouds are gone, the sky is clear

And since we've been together

There's been a change in the weather



(Chorus 2x)
