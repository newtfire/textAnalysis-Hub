<lyrics>



All you people, you know the blues got a soul

Well this is a story, a story never been told

Well you know the blues got pregnant

And they named the baby Rock &amp; Roll



Muddy Waters said it, you know the blues got a soul

James Brown said it, you know the blues got a soul

Well the blues had a baby and they named the baby rock &amp; roll



Ray Charles said it, you know the blues got a soul

John Lee Hooker said it, you know the blues got a soul

Well the blues had a baby and they named the baby rock &amp; roll



Otis Redding said it, you know the blues got a soul

Queen Victoria said it, you know the blues got a soul

Well the blues had a baby and they named the baby Rock &amp; Roll
