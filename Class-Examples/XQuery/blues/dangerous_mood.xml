<lyrics>



Look out baby

I'm in a dangerous mood

I done called up the bossman

Told him where to go

And just what to do



Call me crazy

But i did what I had to do

You can call me stupid

I just did what I had to do

I had to steal a little time baby

So I could spend it all on you

I parked the car down the street

And I unplugged the phone

So it would look just like

Ain't nobody home

I put a rose on your pillow

Where you lay your pretty head

I'm gonna rub your tired shoulders

Bring your dinner to your bed



Look out baby

I'm in a dangerous mood

I had to steal a little time baby

So I could spend it all on you



I'm gonna light a candle

Put the champagne on ice

And if one ain't enough

Well we'll just have to do it twice

I done made myself a will

And I've called my next of kin

'Cause I'm gonna love you over

And over and over

Again and again



Look out baby

I'm in a dangerous mood

I had to steal a little time baby

So I could spend it all on you



Look out baby

I'm in a dangerous mood

Look out baby

I'm in a dangerous mood

I just this one last paycheck baby

And I'm gonna spend every dime on you
