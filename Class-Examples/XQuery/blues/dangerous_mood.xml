<l>Look out baby

</l>
<l>I'm in a dangerous mood

</l>
<l>I done called up the bossman

</l>
<l>Told him where to go

</l>
<l>And just what to do



</l>
<l>Call me crazy

</l>
<l>But i did what I had to do

</l>
<l>You can call me stupid

</l>
<l>I just did what I had to do

</l>
<l>I had to steal a little time baby

</l>
<l>So I could spend it all on you

</l>
<l>I parked the car down the street

</l>
<l>And I unplugged the phone

</l>
<l>So it would look just like

</l>
<l>Ain't nobody home

</l>
<l>I put a rose on your pillow

</l>
<l>Where you lay your pretty head

</l>
<l>I'm gonna rub your tired shoulders

</l>
<l>Bring your dinner to your bed



</l>
<l>Look out baby

</l>
<l>I'm in a dangerous mood

</l>
<l>I had to steal a little time baby

</l>
<l>So I could spend it all on you



</l>
<l>I'm gonna light a candle

</l>
<l>Put the champagne on ice

</l>
<l>And if one ain't enough

</l>
<l>Well we'll just have to do it twice

</l>
<l>I done made myself a will

</l>
<l>And I've called my next of kin

</l>
<l>'Cause I'm gonna love you over

</l>
<l>And over and over

</l>
<l>Again and again



</l>
<l>Look out baby

</l>
<l>I'm in a dangerous mood

</l>
<l>I had to steal a little time baby

</l>
<l>So I could spend it all on you



</l>
<l>Look out baby

</l>
<l>I'm in a dangerous mood

</l>
<l>Look out baby

</l>
<l>I'm in a dangerous mood

</l>
<l>I just this one last paycheck baby

</l>
<l>And I'm gonna spend every dime on you</l></lyrics></xml>
