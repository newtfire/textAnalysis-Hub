(Spoken: Let's go, let's go let's go let's go

Peter you start it

Richard, you start it

Somebody start it)



I just had to get out on the Texas plane, Lord, well it was bringing
me down

Yeah, I had to get out of Texas, baby, Lord, it was bringing me
down

I been all around the world, but Port Arthur is the worst place that
I've ever found



I guess they couldn't understand it there, honey, they'd laugh me off
the street!

Lord, I guess they couldn't understand me, baby, honey, they'd laugh,
I said they'd laugh me right off the street, yeah

I said I want to keep on moving, baby, be the last person I ever
wanna meet



Yeah, yeah, yeah, honey ain't it hard when you're all alone

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, honey ain't it hard, Lord, when you're
all alone

I might die real old lady, but I'd never call Texas my home, no, no,
no, oh!



You say you come from Texas, baby, she says she left Texas with just
her name

(Spoken: That's what she told me)

Yes she's from Texas I tell you, she says she left Texas with just
her name

Yes, well I swear when that girl came to the big city, Lord, she
learned a brand new game

Well, yeah!



Honey, I hear you talkin' about sorrow, baby but you don't know my
pain, that's right!

Mercy! Mercy!

I hear you talking about my sorrow, you don't know my pain

You know there's an inside kind of sorrow, Lord, the women are always
singin' the blues

All right, all right mother fucker, you sing!



You know I, I dealt the Ace to the Queen, you know I played scrabble
with L.B.J.

Yes, I dealt an Ace to the Queen, didn't I'll tell ya I's playin'
scrabble with L.B.J.

Well, I don't care what the name of the game is, baby, I tell you I
always seem to get my way



I used to be a doggone fool, fall for a woman's story every time

But no more, I swear

Well, I used to be a, be a doggone fool, fall for that old woman's
story every time

Yes I, I'm a big boy now, yeah, they gotta come up with some kind of
heavy line

Well, well, yeah!



Sounds like I found the man, who could take care of my time

It ain't me babe, it ain't me babe!

It appears to me that I found a man, that could take care of my
time

Well, I got my own trouble, I got my own car, I got my own little
lady, I got my hotel

Oh what are you talking about!

Don't try to take it!

Somebody talks as fine as he does, oughta be able to take care of

One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine



Woman, woman, it just makes me mad

Ahh, ahh! Woman, yeah

Woman, yeah

Woman, yeah

Woman, yeah

Woman, yeah, yeah, it just makes me mad

Oh man, shit, man...

Yes, she played me for the fool I tell ya

Yes and I've got to love every man she's ever had, yeah



If I found a man who could put me down the way you do

I mean so handy-like, you know what I mean?

Yeah, I found a man, whoa, who could put me down the way you do

I mean so easy like it was second nature, y'know what I mean,
man?

Ah maybe that man could help me, at least, honey I thought I would
give you a chance

I said I, what I said I could try after the, after the show tonight
maybe uh ...



I'm just a working man, you know

Ha ha ha ha, you don't work too hard, baby!

You know I ain't no Hollywood star

I'm not Joe Namath, you know, I read about that in the papers
today

You know I'm just a working man, you don't work too hard, baby!

I never ran in a football game 200 yards

Ha ha ha ha ha, that's the kinda man I like, that's the kinda man I
like

But you know I can take care of those country girls

Well I can mess around in that farmyard

Lord, Lord, whoaah!



Ha ha ha! ha. Whew! Whew! Wow! That's getting a little too close, too
heavy here

That's Nick Gravenites, that was a tune called Ego Rock. No! ...



All right, rock, rock &amp; roll song
