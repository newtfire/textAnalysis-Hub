<lyrics>


<l>You stay out all night 'til the break of
day

</l>
<l>Snap me up with everything I say

</l>
<l>Little by little, oh, I'm losin' you I can see

</l>
<l>And bit by bit darlin', your love is slippin' away from me



</l>
<l>Oh, what you're doin' baby, don't you know it ain't right

</l>
<l>I wonder what your doin' that it takes all night

</l>
<l>Little by little, oh, I'm losin' you I can see

</l>
<l>And bit by bit, your love is slippin' away from me



</l>
<l>Now I say ooh

</l>
<l>Oh now, ooh, I say ooh



</l>
<l>Oh, I get so disgusted when I try to kiss you

</l>
<l>Just don't feel like it used to do

</l>
<l>Little by little, oh, I'm losing you I can see, oh, oh, oh

</l>
<l>And bit by bit darlin', your love is slippin' away from me



</l>
<l>Oooh, now I drove to ...
1
last night, in my car </l>
<l>
So scared I might find, just what I was looking for

</l>
<l>Little by little, oh, I'm losin' you I can see

</l>
<l>And bit by bit, your love is slippin' away from me



</l>
<l>Now I say ooh, baby that's the way I feel

</l>
<l>Oh, I say ooh child, oh that's the way that I feel

</l>
<l>I said ooh child, baby that's the... honey that's the

</l>
<l>Oooh... lord...I say ooh child, baby that's the way I feel

</l>
<l>Oh, I say ooh child, baby that's the way I feel

</l>
<l>I said oohh child, baby that's the way I feel



</l>
<l>Ooooh child
