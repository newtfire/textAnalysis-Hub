<lyrics>



You stay out all night 'til the break of
day

Snap me up with everything I say

Little by little, oh, I'm losin' you I can see

And bit by bit darlin', your love is slippin' away from me



Oh, what you're doin' baby, don't you know it ain't right

I wonder what your doin' that it takes all night

Little by little, oh, I'm losin' you I can see

And bit by bit, your love is slippin' away from me



Now I say ooh

Oh now, ooh, I say ooh



Oh, I get so disgusted when I try to kiss you

Just don't feel like it used to do

Little by little, oh, I'm losing you I can see, oh, oh, oh

And bit by bit darlin', your love is slippin' away from me



Oooh, now I drove to ...
1
 last night, in my car

So scared I might find, just what I was looking for

Little by little, oh, I'm losin' you I can see

And bit by bit, your love is slippin' away from me



Now I say ooh, baby that's the way I feel

Oh, I say ooh child, oh that's the way that I feel

I said ooh child, baby that's the... honey that's the

Oooh... lord...I say ooh child, baby that's the way I feel

Oh, I say ooh child, baby that's the way I feel

I said oohh child, baby that's the way I feel



Ooooh child
