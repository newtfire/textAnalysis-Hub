<lyrics>





Every day I see your face I wish I'd stayed
Don't even know what made me run away
It's just the way I play the game

Emotional is not a word I'd use to explain myself,
but now I'm down upon my knees
Baby please take me back

I don't want to be in love but you're makin' me
Let me up I've had enough, girl you're breakin' me

Here I am just half a man standing alone,
feeling like I lost my only chance,
at happiness when I let you go

I don't want to be alone thinkin' bout you girl,
I got nothin' left to hold in this lonely world

The first time my heart was ever touched,
was the day I lost your love
I can feel it in my flesh and blood,
my soul can only take it so much

So there it is, why can't you give us one more try
You and I could find a way to live,
if you let me in one more time

I know you lost your faith in me but I still believe
Can I make you understand, can I make you see,
that I'm desperate for your love and it's breakin' me

It's breakin' me
