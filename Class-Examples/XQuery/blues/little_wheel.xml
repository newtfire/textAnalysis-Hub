<lyrics>



Let me be your little wheel babe, 'til your big wheel come

Let me be your little wheel babe, 'til your big wheel come

Lord, I'd do more rollin' then your, big wheel ever done



I wanna roll you baby, roll you all over town

Wanna roll with you baby, roll you all over town

Well I'll roll you so easy, baby, that you never know



Let me roll with you baby, roll you all over town

Let me roll with you baby, roll you all over town

Well I'll roll you so easy, that you never know



Let me be your little wheel babe, 'til your big wheel come

Let me be your little wheel babe, 'til your big wheel come

Well I'd do more rollin' then your, big wheel ever done

Let me roll with you baby

Let me roll with you baby

Let me roll with you baby
