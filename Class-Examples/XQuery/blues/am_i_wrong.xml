<lyrics>



Am I wrong, fallin' in love with you,

tell me am I wrong, well, fallin' in love with you

While your other man was out there,

cheatin' and lyin', steppin' all over you



Uh, sweet thing

Tell me am I wrong, holdin' on to you so tight,

Tell me, tell me, am I wrong, holdin' on to you so tight

If your other man come to claim you,

he'd better be ready, ready for a long long fight



Well I gotta be strong, well I know you're dependin' on me

You know I gotta be strong, I know you're dependin' on me

To give you all of my attention,

all of my time, and all of the love you need



Oh, tell me, am I wrong tryin' to hold on to you

Tell me am I wrong, tryin' to hold on to you

I just wanna make a home for you baby,

and all of your children too



Tell me am I wrong, fallin' in love with you

Gotta tell me am I wrong, fallin' in love with you

While your other man was out there,

cheatin' and lyin', steppin' all over you

While your other man was out there,

cheatin' and lyin', steppin' all over you
