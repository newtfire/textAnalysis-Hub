<lyrics>


<l>Am I wrong, fallin' in love with you,

</l>
<l>tell me am I wrong, well, fallin' in love with you

</l>
<l>While your other man was out there,

</l>
<l>cheatin' and lyin', steppin' all over you



</l>
<l>Uh, sweet thing

</l>
<l>Tell me am I wrong, holdin' on to you so tight,

</l>
<l>Tell me, tell me, am I wrong, holdin' on to you so tight

</l>
<l>If your other man come to claim you,

</l>
<l>he'd better be ready, ready for a long long fight



</l>
<l>Well I gotta be strong, well I know you're dependin' on me

</l>
<l>You know I gotta be strong, I know you're dependin' on me

</l>
<l>To give you all of my attention,

</l>
<l>all of my time, and all of the love you need



</l>
<l>Oh, tell me, am I wrong tryin' to hold on to you

</l>
<l>Tell me am I wrong, tryin' to hold on to you

</l>
<l>I just wanna make a home for you baby,

</l>
<l>and all of your children too



</l>
<l>Tell me am I wrong, fallin' in love with you

</l>
<l>Gotta tell me am I wrong, fallin' in love with you

</l>
<l>While your other man was out there,

</l>
<l>cheatin' and lyin', steppin' all over you

</l>
<l>While your other man was out there,

</l>
<l>cheatin' and lyin', steppin' all over you</l></lyrics></xml>
