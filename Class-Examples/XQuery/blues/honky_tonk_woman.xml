<lyrics>



I met a gypsy barroom queen in Memphis

An' on the street the summer sun did shine

The sweetest rose that ever grow in Memphis

I just can't seem to drink her off-a my mind



She's a honky tonk woman (yeah)

Give me, give me, give me the honky tonk blues (yeah!)

She's a honky tonk woman (woo-hoo)

Gimme, gimme, gimme, the honky tonk blues



I laid a divorce in New York City

An' had to pick myself out of a fight

Ladies they all covered me with roses

She blew my nose an'then she blew my mind



Well, she's a honky tonk woman (yeah woo, Lord, hey hey)

Give me, give me, give me, the honky tonk blues

She's a honky tonk woman (woo-ooo-hoo)

Gimme, gimme, gimme, the honky tonk blues



She's a honky tonk woman (woo-ah)

Gimme, gimme, gimme, the honky tonk blues



She's a honky tonk woman (wooooo)

Gimme, gimme, gimme, the honky tonk blues
