<lyrics>



Well I walked down to my bank, just to see what I could see

I asked the man behind the desk, I say "Ah, is there any money for
me?"

Now he didn't know just what to say

I say, "I need that money in a terrible way!"

Now he didn't say "yeah" but he didn't say "no"

He just shook my hand and showed me the door



Oh Lord, the blues is killin' me

Oh Lord, Lord, Lord, these blues is killin' me

Yes sir



Now my wife loves money and it bothers my mind

She runs to the store and she buys, on time

T.V's, radios, stereos and I got all kind a princess phones

A one of these days, ya'all-a, I think they all gonna be gone



My baby need clothes, my wife needs a car

It's a wonder ya'all ha, I got this far! Hey!

Landlord knockin', and he wants some rent

Now I'm lookin' for the money that my wife just spent



Oh Lord, um-hm, the blues is killin' me

Oh Lord, Lord, Lord, these blues is killin' me

Tellin' ya



Tax time, ain't nothin' but a mess

Payin' Uncle Sam more an' I'm gettin' less

The po' stay po' and the rich stay rich

An' I'm right here in the middle

Now ain't that a.....!



Barely gettin' by, makes me mean

'Cause the politicians I'm payin', are livin' real clean

Step down Mister Politician, and live like I do

I want you to know, the workin' man blues



Oh Lord, oh Lord, these blues is killin' me

Oh Lord, Lord, Lord, these blues is killin' me



Payin' these taxes worry me to death...



Buyin' new T.V's an' radios an' stereos...



Baby needs clothes...



Wife need a old car to get around in...



Oh it's a bitch bein' po'...



I say it's a ___!
1
, bein' po...



Fading:

Now ain't that a bitch?

(Boy it's rough, I'll tell ya)



__________

Note 1: ___ this is not a missing word, Albert just leaves out the
word, 'bitch' and bends a note to fill in instead of saying the
word.
