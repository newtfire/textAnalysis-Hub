<lyrics>



I've been around and I've seen some things

People moving faster than the speed of sound

Faster than the speeding bullet

People living like Superman

All day and all night

And I won't say if it's wrong or if it's right

I'm pretty fast myself

But I do have some advice to pass along

Along in the chorus of this song



Better not look down, if you want to keep on flying

Put the hammer down, keep it full speed ahead

Better not look back, or you might just wind up crying

You can keep it moving, if you don't look down



An old girl friend of mine showed up the other day

That girl have lived in love and for love,

and over love, and under love all her life

If the arrows from cupid's bow that had

passed through her heart had been sticking

Out of her body she would have looked like a porcupine,

And she asked me "B.B. do you think I've lived my life all
wrong?"

And I said: "The only advice I have to pass

along in the chorus of this song", girl



Better not look down, if you want to keep on flying

Put the hammer down, keep it full speed ahead

Better not look back, or you might just wind up crying

You can keep it moving, if you don't look down



I was walking down the street at sunrise one morning, in London,
England

And there was a very large Rolls Royce limousine,

pulling slowly along the street

And in that Rolls Royce was the queen of England, looking tired

Just go back from a party, and the queen leaned out and,

she said: "Aren't you B.B. King?"

She said: "Oh B.B., sometimes it's so hard to pull things
together.

Could you tell me what you think I ought to do?"

And I said:



Better not look down, if you want to keep on flying

Put the hammer down, keep it full speed ahead

Better not look back, or you might just wind up crying

You can keep it moving, if you don't look down



Better not look down, if you want to keep on flying

Put the hammer down, keep it full speed ahead

Better not look back, or you might just wind up crying

You can keep it moving, if you don't look down
