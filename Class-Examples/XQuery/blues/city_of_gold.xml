<lyrics>



In my home of sand, outside the city of gold

Well, the wind's so burning hot, but my heart remains so cold

I need to buy myself some answers but the truth's already been
sold



Well, I know how to use a razor, carve my initials in the light

Yes, I know how to use a razor, carve my initials in the light

Sometimes in the depth of the dark, baby, I can make everything all
right



In my home of sand, outside the city of gold

Well, the wind's so burning hot, but my heart remains so cold, yes it
does

The shelter in your eyes, I dream about it when I die

Thirst for it when I cry, yeah



My home of sand, outside the city of gold

Well, the wind's so burning hot, but my heart remains so cold, it
does

The shelter in your eyes, I dream about it when I die

Thirst for it when I cry

Yeah, na, na



Oh, my meal of salt on that table of stone

And my meal of salt on that table of stone, yeah

Your feat's so sweet while I thirst here all alone



My home of sand, outside the city of gold

Well, the wind's so burning hot, but my heart remains so cold, yes it
does

I need to buy myself some aspirin,

but the truth's already been sold
