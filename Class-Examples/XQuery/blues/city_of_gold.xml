<lyrics>


<l>In my home of sand, outside the city of gold

</l>
<l>Well, the wind's so burning hot, but my heart remains so cold

</l>
<l>I need to buy myself some answers but the truth's already been

sold




</l>
<l>Well, I know how to use a razor, carve my initials in the light

</l>
<l>Yes, I know how to use a razor, carve my initials in the light

</l>
<l>Sometimes in the depth of the dark, baby, I can make everything all

right




</l>
<l>In my home of sand, outside the city of gold

</l>
<l>Well, the wind's so burning hot, but my heart remains so cold, yes it
does

</l>
<l>The shelter in your eyes, I dream about it when I die

</l>
<l>Thirst for it when I cry, yeah



</l>
<l>My home of sand, outside the city of gold

</l>
<l>Well, the wind's so burning hot, but my heart remains so cold, it
does

</l>
<l>The shelter in your eyes, I dream about it when I die

</l>
<l>Thirst for it when I cry

</l>
<l>Yeah, na, na



</l>
<l>Oh, my meal of salt on that table of stone

</l>
<l>And my meal of salt on that table of stone, yeah

</l>
<l>Your feat's so sweet while I thirst here all alone



</l>
<l>My home of sand, outside the city of gold

</l>
<l>Well, the wind's so burning hot, but my heart remains so cold, yes it
does

</l>
<l>I need to buy myself some aspirin,

</l>
<l>but the truth's already been sold</l></lyrics></xml>
