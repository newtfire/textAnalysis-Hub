<lyrics>



People they're talkin' about you and I

What they sayin' I know is a lie

The people they're talkin' about me and you

I done got tired, I'm gonna talk some too



They talk about my dog, they talk about my cat

Sayin' my dog can't bark and my cat can't scratch

The people they're talkin' about me and you

I done got tired, I'm gonna talk some too



My dog can bark and my cat can scratch

Who started the fire'll have to go out and stop the match

The people they're talkin' about me and you

I done got tired, I'm gonna talk some too



Ain't nobody's business if I bark like a dog

Chasin' rats all up and down the hall

The people they're talkin' about me and you

I done got tired, I'm gonna talk some too
