<lyrics>


<l>People they're talkin' about you and I

</l>
<l>What they sayin' I know is a lie

</l>
<l>The people they're talkin' about me and you

</l>
<l>I done got tired, I'm gonna talk some too



</l>
<l>They talk about my dog, they talk about my cat

</l>
<l>Sayin' my dog can't bark and my cat can't scratch

</l>
<l>The people they're talkin' about me and you

</l>
<l>I done got tired, I'm gonna talk some too



</l>
<l>My dog can bark and my cat can scratch

</l>
<l>Who started the fire'll have to go out and stop the match

</l>
<l>The people they're talkin' about me and you

</l>
<l>I done got tired, I'm gonna talk some too



</l>
<l>Ain't nobody's business if I bark like a dog

</l>
<l>Chasin' rats all up and down the hall

</l>
<l>The people they're talkin' about me and you

</l>
<l>I done got tired, I'm gonna talk some too</l></lyrics></xml>
