<lyrics>



I may go and move to the jungle now

Way out in the woods

Yes, I think I'll move to the jungle people

Move way out in the woods

Yes, because the way things are here now

Well, I ain't doin' myself no good



I work hard everyday

From Monday to Friday night

The wages that they pay me

I swear that they're very light

The take out a little for the state

A little more for Uncle Sam

How can I ever catch up

And get myself out of this jam

Yes, I think I'll move to the jungle

Move way out in the woods

Yes, because the way things are here now

Well, I ain't doin' myself no good



I go to town on Saturday

Just to pay my bills

I better make it early

Or the collector will come where I live

I got to church on a Sunday

I get on my knees to pray

Preacher takes up collection

And say brother what will you pay

I think I'll move to the jungle

Move way out in the woods

Yes, because the way things are here now

Well, I ain't doin' myself no good
