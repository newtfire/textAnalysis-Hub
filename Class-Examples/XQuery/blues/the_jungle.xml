<lyrics>


<l>I may go and move to the jungle now

</l>
<l>Way out in the woods

</l>
<l>Yes, I think I'll move to the jungle people

</l>
<l>Move way out in the woods

</l>
<l>Yes, because the way things are here now

</l>
<l>Well, I ain't doin' myself no good



</l>
<l>I work hard everyday

</l>
<l>From Monday to Friday night

</l>
<l>The wages that they pay me

</l>
<l>I swear that they're very light

</l>
<l>The take out a little for the state

</l>
<l>A little more for Uncle Sam

</l>
<l>How can I ever catch up

</l>
<l>And get myself out of this jam

</l>
<l>Yes, I think I'll move to the jungle

</l>
<l>Move way out in the woods

</l>
<l>Yes, because the way things are here now

</l>
<l>Well, I ain't doin' myself no good



</l>
<l>I go to town on Saturday

</l>
<l>Just to pay my bills

</l>
<l>I better make it early

</l>
<l>Or the collector will come where I live

</l>
<l>I got to church on a Sunday

</l>
<l>I get on my knees to pray

</l>
<l>Preacher takes up collection

</l>
<l>And say brother what will you pay

</l>
<l>I think I'll move to the jungle

</l>
<l>Move way out in the woods

</l>
<l>Yes, because the way things are here now

</l>
<l>Well, I ain't doin' myself no good</l></lyrics></xml>
