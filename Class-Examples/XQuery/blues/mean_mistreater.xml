<lyrics>



She's a mean mistreater

and she don't mean me no good

She's a mean mistreater,

and the woman she don't mean me no good

Well you know I don't blame you baby,

I'd be the same way if I could



She's a mean mistreater,

and the girl mistreats me all the time

She's a mean mistreater,

and the little girl mistreats me all the time

Well you know you just wants to quit me darlin',

because you got that on your mind



Well you remember that Monday mornin' that I knocked up, up on your
door

You had the nerve to tell me that you didn't love, me no more

Can't you remember baby,

when I knocked up on your door

Well you know you had the nerve to tell me that you,

didn't love me no more



Well you know it's lonesome you know it's lonesome,

when you sleepin', all by yourself

The little girl that you lovin',

she lovin' someone else

And it's lonesome,

sleepin' by yourself

Well you know the little woman that you involved with now,

she is loving someone else
