<l>She's a mean mistreater

</l>
<l>and she don't mean me no good

</l>
<l>She's a mean mistreater,

</l>
<l>and the woman she don't mean me no good

</l>
<l>Well you know I don't blame you baby,

</l>
<l>I'd be the same way if I could



</l>
<l>She's a mean mistreater,

</l>
<l>and the girl mistreats me all the time

</l>
<l>She's a mean mistreater,

</l>
<l>and the little girl mistreats me all the time

</l>
<l>Well you know you just wants to quit me darlin',

</l>
<l>because you got that on your mind



</l>
<l>Well you remember that Monday mornin' that I knocked up, up on your
door

</l>
<l>You had the nerve to tell me that you didn't love, me no more

</l>
<l>Can't you remember baby,

</l>
<l>when I knocked up on your door

</l>
<l>Well you know you had the nerve to tell me that you,

</l>
<l>didn't love me no more



</l>
<l>Well you know it's lonesome you know it's lonesome,

</l>
<l>when you sleepin', all by yourself

</l>
<l>The little girl that you lovin',

</l>
<l>she lovin' someone else

</l>
<l>And it's lonesome,

</l>
<l>sleepin' by yourself

</l>
<l>Well you know the little woman that you involved with now,

</l>
<l>she is loving someone else</l></lyrics></xml>
