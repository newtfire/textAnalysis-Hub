<lyrics>


<l>Oh, the gale is raging and my ship's without a sail

</l>
<l>Oh, the gale is raging and my ship's without a sail

</l>
<l>If the wind keeps on a-blowing, I won't be left to tell the tale



</l>
<l>Oh, the ship is sinking and the lightning struck the mast

</l>
<l>Now the ship is sinking and the lightning struck the mast

</l>
<l>And my crew is done deserted, I've got to stick here to the last



</l>
<l>Oh, I don't mind drowning, but the water is so cold

</l>
<l>No, I don't mind drowning, but the water is so cold

</l>
<l>If I must leave this good world, I wanna leave it brave and bold



</l>
<l>Mama's shipwrecked, shipwrecked, she ain't got no time to lose

</l>
<l>Mama's shipwrecked, shipwrecked, she ain't got no time to lose

</l><l>Lord, if someone don't save me, I'll go down singing the shipwrecked</l>
