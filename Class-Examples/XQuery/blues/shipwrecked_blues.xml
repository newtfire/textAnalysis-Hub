<lyrics>



Oh, the gale is raging and my ship's without a sail

Oh, the gale is raging and my ship's without a sail

If the wind keeps on a-blowing, I won't be left to tell the tale



Oh, the ship is sinking and the lightning struck the mast

Now the ship is sinking and the lightning struck the mast

And my crew is done deserted, I've got to stick here to the last



Oh, I don't mind drowning, but the water is so cold

No, I don't mind drowning, but the water is so cold

If I must leave this good world, I wanna leave it brave and bold



Mama's shipwrecked, shipwrecked, she ain't got no time to lose

Mama's shipwrecked, shipwrecked, she ain't got no time to lose

Lord, if someone don't save me, I'll go down singing the shipwrecked
blues
