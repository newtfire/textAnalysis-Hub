<lyrics>



I had a dream last night all about my gal

I had a dream last night all about my gal

You can tell that sweet papa ain't feelin' so well



I'm goin' away mama, just to wear you off my mind

I'm goin' away sweet mama, just to wear you off my mind

So if I live here in Chicago, money's gonna be my crime



This house is lonesome, my baby left me all alone

I said this house is lonesome, my sugar left me all alone

If your heart ain't rock, sugar's must be marble stone



Play that thing...

Sure is good...

Play it like you live...



I got the blues so bad, it hurts my feet to walk

I got the blues so bad, it hurts my feet to walk

This house is on my brain, it hurts my tongue to talk



Lonesome house blues...
