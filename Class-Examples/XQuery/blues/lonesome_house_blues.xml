<lyrics>


<l>I had a dream last night all about my gal

</l>
<l>I had a dream last night all about my gal

</l>
<l>You can tell that sweet papa ain't feelin' so well



</l>
<l>I'm goin' away mama, just to wear you off my mind

</l>
<l>I'm goin' away sweet mama, just to wear you off my mind

</l>
<l>So if I live here in Chicago, money's gonna be my crime



</l>
<l>This house is lonesome, my baby left me all alone

</l>
<l>I said this house is lonesome, my sugar left me all alone

</l>
<l>If your heart ain't rock, sugar's must be marble stone



</l>
<l>Play that thing...

</l>
<l>Sure is good...

</l>
<l>Play it like you live...



</l>
<l>I got the blues so bad, it hurts my feet to walk

</l>
<l>I got the blues so bad, it hurts my feet to walk

</l>
<l>This house is on my brain, it hurts my tongue to talk



</l>
<l>Lonesome house blues...</l></lyrics></xml>
