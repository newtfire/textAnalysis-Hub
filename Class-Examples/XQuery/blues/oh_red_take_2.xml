<lyrics>



Oh Red, what should I do?

Oh Red, what should I do?

I'm sick an tired of askin' ya to sing them blues



Now Red, let's dance a while

Oh Red, let's dance a while

I'm sick an tired, tellin' ya to hold my hand



Oh Red, let's break 'em down

Oh Red, let's break 'em down

I'm sick an tired, tellin' ya to hold my hand



Now Red, you sweet to me

Oh Red, you sweet to me

But I'm sick an tired, tellin ya to hold my hand



Oh Red, we gonna swing a while

Oh Red, we gonna swing a while

I'm sick an tired, tellin' ya to hold my hand
