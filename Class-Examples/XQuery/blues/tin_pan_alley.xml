<lyrics>



Went down to Tin Pan Alley, see what was going on

Things was too hot down there, couldn't stay very long

Hey hey hey hey, alley's the roughest place I've ever been

All the people down there, livin' for their whisky, wine, and gin



I heard a woman scream, yeah, and I peeked through the door

Some cat was workin' on Annie with a, Lord with a two-by-four

Hey hey hey hey, alley's the roughest place I've ever been

All the people down there, livin' for their whisky, wine, and gin

I heard a pistol shoot, yeah, and it was a .44

Somebody killed a crap shooter cause he didn't, shake, rattle, and
roll

Hey hey hey hey, alley's the roughest place I've ever been

All the people down there, killin' for their whisky, wine, and
gin



I saw a cop standin', with his hand on his gun

Said "This is a raid boys, nobody run"

Hey, Hey, Hey, alley's the roughest place I've ever been

Yeah they took me away from tin pan alley

And took me right back, to the pen
