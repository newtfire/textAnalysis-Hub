<lyrics>


<l>Went down to Tin Pan Alley, see what was going on

</l>
<l>Things was too hot down there, couldn't stay very long

</l>
<l>Hey hey hey hey, alley's the roughest place I've ever been

</l>
<l>All the people down there, livin' for their whisky, wine, and gin



</l>
<l>I heard a woman scream, yeah, and I peeked through the door

</l>
<l>Some cat was workin' on Annie with a, Lord with a two-by-four

</l>
<l>Hey hey hey hey, alley's the roughest place I've ever been

</l>
<l>All the people down there, livin' for their whisky, wine, and gin

</l>
<l>I heard a pistol shoot, yeah, and it was a .44

</l>
<l>Somebody killed a crap shooter cause he didn't, shake, rattle, and
roll

</l>
<l>Hey hey hey hey, alley's the roughest place I've ever been

</l>
<l>All the people down there, killin' for their whisky, wine, and

gin




</l>
<l>I saw a cop standin', with his hand on his gun

</l>
<l>Said "This is a raid boys, nobody run"

</l>
<l>Hey, Hey, Hey, alley's the roughest place I've ever been

</l>
<l>Yeah they took me away from tin pan alley

</l>
<l>And took me right back, to the pen
