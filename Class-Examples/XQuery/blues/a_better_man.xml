<lyrics>



Sittin' here in my problem

What am I gonna do now

Am I gonna make it

Someway, somehow



Maybe I'm not supposed to know

Maybe I'm supposed to cry

And if nobody ever knows

The way I feel

It's all right

And it'll be ok



(Chorus:)

I'm gonna make my world a better place

I'm gonna keep that smile on my face

I'm gonna teach myself how to understand

I'm gonna make myself a better man



Climbing out of the window

Climbing up the wall

Is anybody gonna save me

Or are they gonna let me fall

Well I don't really wanna know

I#180;ll just hold on the best I can

And if I fall down

I#180;ll just get back up

It'll be alright

It'll be ok



(Chorus 2x)



Maybe I'm not supposed to know

Maybe I'm supposed to cry

And if nobody ever knows

The way I feel

That's all right

It'll be ok



(Chorus 2x)
