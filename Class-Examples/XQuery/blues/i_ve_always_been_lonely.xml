<lyrics>


<l>I don't have to know your name

</l>
<l>Unless you really want me too

</l>
<l>All I really want to know

</l>
<l>Is what you want to do

</l>
<l>Hope there's something you like

</l>
<l>In something that you see

</l>
<l>I don't have that much to say for me



</l>
<l>I've always been lonely

</l>
<l>But don't be afraid

</l>
<l>I've always been lonely

</l>
<l>Like a song never played

</l>
<l>I've always been lonely

</l>
<l>But if you come with me tonight

</l>
<l>And stayed

</l>
<l>At least we'd know

</l>
<l>It wasn't loneliness we made



</l>
<l>You don't have to know my past

</l>
<l>It's much too much for me and you

</l>
<l>If the sadness has to show

</l>
<l>I guess I'll let it through

</l>
<l>We can go till it's gone

</l>
<l>And give it all we've got

</l>
<l>Sometimes anything can mean a lot</l></lyrics></xml>
