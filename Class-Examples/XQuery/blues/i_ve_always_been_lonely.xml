<lyrics>



I don't have to know your name

Unless you really want me too

All I really want to know

Is what you want to do

Hope there's something you like

In something that you see

I don't have that much to say for me



I've always been lonely

But don't be afraid

I've always been lonely

Like a song never played

I've always been lonely

But if you come with me tonight

And stayed

At least we'd know

It wasn't loneliness we made



You don't have to know my past

It's much too much for me and you

If the sadness has to show

I guess I'll let it through

We can go till it's gone

And give it all we've got

Sometimes anything can mean a lot
