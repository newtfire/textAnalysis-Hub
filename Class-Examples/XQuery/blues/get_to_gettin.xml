<lyrics>



Get to gettin'

Get to gettin'

Get to gettin', get to gettin'

Take your baby home, pet her an' put her in bed



Get to gettin'

Get to gettin'

Get to gettin', get to gettin'

Take your baby home , pet her an' put her in the bed

Don't give me no trouble woman

Ya heard just what I said



Don't talk about that baby

'Cause you know just what I'll do

Don't talk about that baby

'Cause you know just what I'll do

I'll grab you woman, an' do the mess-around with you



Get to gettin'

Get to gettin'

Take your baby home, pet her an' put her in bed



Get to gettin'

Get to gettin'

Take you baby home, pet her an' put her in bed

Don't give me no trouble woman

You heard just what I said



(Get to gettin')



(Just gettin')



(Get to gettin')

(Get to gettin')

(Get to gettin')

(Get to gettin')



Don't tell me baby, was your cousin on the telephone

Don't tell me baby, was your cousin on the telephone

Well I know you lyin', 'cause yours been dead 'long time



(Get to gettin')

(Get to gettin')

(Get to gettin')

(Get to gettin')

(Get to gettin')

(Get to gettin')



It's you

Hey!
