<l>Well, the first thing Monday mornin', I drink black coffee, to clear
my head

</l>
<l>Yes, every Monday mornin', I drink black coffee, an a-clear my
head

</l>
<l>Because, ev'ry Sunday night without you, baby, it's Blue Monday, you

know baby, you know my soul is dead




</l>
<l>Big Boss Man, I can hear you call my name, yes, Big Boss Man, Big
Boss Man

</l>
<l>Oh, I can hear you call my name

</l>
<l>You know, I just don't feel like it this mornin', baby, it's a sin,

you know ain't it a sin?




</l>
<l>Hey!



</l>
<l>I can hear Blue Monday callin', but this old hangover, just won't let
me go

</l>
<l>Yes, I can hear Blue Monday callin', but this old hangover, just
won't let me go

</l><l>Yes, but ev'ry time I try to get up, baby, I feel like I'm just goin'</l>
<l>down slow</l></lyrics></xml>
