<lyrics>



You're my man, you're so nice and brown, sweetest man in this
town

I heard you say you was goin' away, and leave me here to stay

I feel like I could cry, and here's the reason why



Daddy, you really knows your stuff when you take me for a buggy
ride

I like you when you got your habits on, you can shift your gear with
so much pride

I gets a funny feelin' when you gaze into my eyes

You give me so much thrill, you make my thermometer rise

I'm happy when you're by my side when you take me for a buggy
ride



Daddy, you're as sweet as you can be when you take me for a buggy
ride

When you set me down up on your knee, and ask me to be your bride

When you hug and kiss me it makes me feel fine

I gets this funny feelin' up and down my spine

You don't need no teachin', you don't need no guide when you take me
for a buggy ride

Your lovin' ain't so forte in the park but you a lovin', poor
creature in the dark

You ain't so hot!

What can it be that makes me say? "daddy, take all of me"

You always ready ev'ry time that I call

What I like about you, you never stall

You ain't no preacher, you a good old soul

You done sent salvation to my very soul

I can't kick but I'm satisfied when you take me for a buggy ride
