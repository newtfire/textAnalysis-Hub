<lyrics>


<l>You're my man, you're so nice and brown, sweetest man in this
town

</l>
<l>I heard you say you was goin' away, and leave me here to stay

</l>
<l>I feel like I could cry, and here's the reason why



</l>
<l>Daddy, you really knows your stuff when you take me for a buggy
ride

</l>
<l>I like you when you got your habits on, you can shift your gear with
so much pride

</l>
<l>I gets a funny feelin' when you gaze into my eyes

</l>
<l>You give me so much thrill, you make my thermometer rise

</l>
<l>I'm happy when you're by my side when you take me for a buggy

ride




</l>
<l>Daddy, you're as sweet as you can be when you take me for a buggy
ride

</l>
<l>When you set me down up on your knee, and ask me to be your bride

</l>
<l>When you hug and kiss me it makes me feel fine

</l>
<l>I gets this funny feelin' up and down my spine

</l>
<l>You don't need no teachin', you don't need no guide when you take me
for a buggy ride

</l>
<l>Your lovin' ain't so forte in the park but you a lovin', poor
creature in the dark

</l>
<l>You ain't so hot!

</l>
<l>What can it be that makes me say? "daddy, take all of me"

</l>
<l>You always ready ev'ry time that I call

</l>
<l>What I like about you, you never stall

</l>
<l>You ain't no preacher, you a good old soul

</l>
<l>You done sent salvation to my very soul

</l>
<l>I can't kick but I'm satisfied when you take me for a buggy ride</l></lyrics></xml>
