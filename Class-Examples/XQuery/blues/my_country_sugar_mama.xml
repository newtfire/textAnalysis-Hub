<lyrics>



Now just tell me sugar mama, where in the world did you get
your sugar from

Now just tell me sugar mama, where in the world did you get your
sugar from

Way down in Louisiana, you come off of your father's sugar farm



I like my coffee in the mornin', woman I'm crazy about my tea at
night

I like my coffee in the mornin', crazy about my tea at night

If I don't get my sugar three times a day, oh darlin' I don't feel
right



You know they're braggin' about your good sugar, you know they're
braggin' all over town

You know they're braggin' about your sugar babe, you know they're
braggin' all over town

(Spoken: what they sayin' about you)

They say that's granulated sugar, best ever to come off the farm
