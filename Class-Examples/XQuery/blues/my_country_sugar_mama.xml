<lyrics>


<l>Now just tell me sugar mama, where in the world did you get
your sugar from

</l>
<l>Now just tell me sugar mama, where in the world did you get your
sugar from

</l>
<l>Way down in Louisiana, you come off of your father's sugar farm



</l>
<l>I like my coffee in the mornin', woman I'm crazy about my tea at
night

</l>
<l>I like my coffee in the mornin', crazy about my tea at night

</l>
<l>If I don't get my sugar three times a day, oh darlin' I don't feel

right




</l>
<l>You know they're braggin' about your good sugar, you know they're
braggin' all over town

</l>
<l>You know they're braggin' about your sugar babe, you know they're
braggin' all over town

</l>
<l>(Spoken: what they sayin' about you)

</l><l>They say that's granulated sugar, best ever to come off the farm</l></lyrics></xml>
