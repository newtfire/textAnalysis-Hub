<lyrics>



My heart belongs to only you

I've never loved as I love you

You set a flame within me burning

A flame to stay within me years



It's just for you I want to live

It's just to you my heart I give

I'll always be your slave, my darling

Through the coming years



There was sometime when I was doubtful

Of this new love affair

But now my mind is no more doubtful

I found my heaven with the help of a prayer



You are the song within my soul

A melody that can grow

I've known for long my heart belongs to

Only you



There was sometime when I was doubtful

Of this new love affair

But now my mind is no more doubtful

I found my heaven with the help of a prayer



You are the song within my soul

A melody that can grow

I've known for long my heart belongs to

Only you
