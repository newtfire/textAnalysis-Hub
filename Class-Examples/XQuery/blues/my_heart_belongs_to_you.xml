<lyrics>


<l>My heart belongs to only you

</l>
<l>I've never loved as I love you

</l>
<l>You set a flame within me burning

</l>
<l>A flame to stay within me years



</l>
<l>It's just for you I want to live

</l>
<l>It's just to you my heart I give

</l>
<l>I'll always be your slave, my darling

</l>
<l>Through the coming years



</l>
<l>There was sometime when I was doubtful

</l>
<l>Of this new love affair

</l>
<l>But now my mind is no more doubtful

</l>
<l>I found my heaven with the help of a prayer



</l>
<l>You are the song within my soul

</l>
<l>A melody that can grow

</l>
<l>I've known for long my heart belongs to

</l>
<l>Only you



</l>
<l>There was sometime when I was doubtful

</l>
<l>Of this new love affair

</l>
<l>But now my mind is no more doubtful

</l>
<l>I found my heaven with the help of a prayer



</l>
<l>You are the song within my soul

</l>
<l>A melody that can grow

</l>
<l>I've known for long my heart belongs to

</l><l>Only you</l></lyrics></xml>
