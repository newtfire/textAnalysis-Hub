<lyrics>



I woke up this morning with a awful aching head

I woke up this morning with a awful aching head

My new man had left me, just a room and a empty bed



Bought me a 
coffee
grinder
 that's the best one I could find

Bought me a coffee grinder that's the best one I could find

Oh, he could grind my coffee, 'cause he had a brand new grind



He's a deep sea diver with a stroke that can't go wrong

He's a deep sea diver with a stroke that can't go wrong

He can stay at the bottom and his wind holds out so long



He knows how to thrill me and he thrills me night and day

Oh, he knows how to thrill me, he thrills me night and day

He's got a new way of loving, almost takes my breath away



Lord, he's got that sweet somethin' and I told my girlfriend Lou

He's got that sweet somethin' and I told my girlfriend Lou

From the way she's raving, she must have gone and tried it too



(Part 2)



When my bed get empty make me feel awful mean and blue

When my bed get empty make me feel awful mean and blue

My springs are getting rusty, sleeping single like I do



Bought him a blanket, pillow for his head at night

Bought him a blanket, pillow for his head at night

Then I bought him a mattress so he could lay just right



He came home one evening with his spirit way up high

He came home one evening with his spirit way up high

What he had to give me, make me wring my hands and cry



He give me a lesson that I never had before

He give me a lesson that I never had before

When he got to teachin' me, from my elbow down was sore



He boiled my first cabbage and he made it awful hot

He boiled my first cabbage and he made it awful hot

When he put in the bacon, it overflowed the pot



When you git good lovin', never go and spread the news

Yes, he'll double-cross you, and leave you with them empty bed
