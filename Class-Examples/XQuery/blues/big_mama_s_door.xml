<lyrics>



Goin' down in Chickasaw, gon' take that right hand road

Goin' down in Chickasaw, gon' take that right hand road

Bet I ain't gon' stop till I come up in big mama's door



Folks down in Chickasaw they all know my name

Folks down in Chickasaw they all know my name

And when I'm down there, man, sure be glad I came



Girl that I'm lovin' got the great long curly hair

Girl that I'm lovin' got the great long curly hair

But her mama and papa, man, they sure don't 'low me there



What you gonna do when you find your 
biscuit
roller
 gone?

What you gonna do when you find your biscuit roller gone? (Man, what
about it?)

Get in that kitchen, man, and roll 'em till she come home



Get up in the mood, man, we sure had lots of fun

Get up in the mood, man, we sure had lots of fun

When I come round that corner, gonna see my pony run



Goin' down in Chickasaw, gon' take that right hand road

Goin' down in Chickasaw, gon' take that right hand road. (Goin' back
to the wood!)

Bet I ain't gon' stop till I come up in big mama's door
