<lyrics>


<l>Goin' down in Chickasaw, gon' take that right hand road

</l>
<l>Goin' down in Chickasaw, gon' take that right hand road

</l>
<l>Bet I ain't gon' stop till I come up in big mama's door



</l>
<l>Folks down in Chickasaw they all know my name

</l>
<l>Folks down in Chickasaw they all know my name

</l>
<l>And when I'm down there, man, sure be glad I came



</l>
<l>Girl that I'm lovin' got the great long curly hair

</l>
<l>Girl that I'm lovin' got the great long curly hair

</l>
<l>But her mama and papa, man, they sure don't 'low me there



</l>
<l>What you gonna do when you find your 
biscuit
roller
gone? </l>
<l>
What you gonna do when you find your biscuit roller gone? (Man, what
about it?)

</l>
<l>Get in that kitchen, man, and roll 'em till she come home



</l>
<l>Get up in the mood, man, we sure had lots of fun

</l>
<l>Get up in the mood, man, we sure had lots of fun

</l>
<l>When I come round that corner, gonna see my pony run



</l>
<l>Goin' down in Chickasaw, gon' take that right hand road

</l>
<l>Goin' down in Chickasaw, gon' take that right hand road. (Goin' back
to the wood!)

</l>
<l>Bet I ain't gon' stop till I come up in big mama's door</l></lyrics></xml>
