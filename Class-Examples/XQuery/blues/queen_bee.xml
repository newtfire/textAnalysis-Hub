<l>Queen bee, queen bee, queen bee, queen bee, please come back
to me

</l>
<l>Queen bee, queen bee, queen bee yes, queen bee, please come back to
me

</l>
<l>'Cause you got the best darn stinger any queen bee I ever seen



</l>
<l>Hmm, she stung me this mornin', yes, yes, yes, I been lookin' for all
day long

</l>
<l>She stung me this mornin', I've been lookin' for my queen bee a day
long

</l>
<l>Got me to the place one time, hate to see my queen bee leave home



</l>
<l>Hmm, stinger long as my right arm

</l><l>Every time she stings me, Lord, it makes my blood run warm</l></lyrics></xml>
