<lyrics>



Queen bee, queen bee, queen bee, queen bee, please come back
to me

Queen bee, queen bee, queen bee yes, queen bee, please come back to
me

'Cause you got the best darn stinger any queen bee I ever seen



Hmm, she stung me this mornin', yes, yes, yes, I been lookin' for all
day long

She stung me this mornin', I've been lookin' for my queen bee a day
long

Got me to the place one time, hate to see my queen bee leave home



Hmm, stinger long as my right arm

Every time she stings me, Lord, it makes my blood run warm
