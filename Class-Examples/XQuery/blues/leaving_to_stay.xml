<lyrics>





I can't believe in what I've seen
I been forsaken, I been deceived
Cast aside and left behind
I can't believe my own eyes

I been waiting for the glory, of the coming of the Lord
I heard a lot of stories, but all my prayers have been ignored
I been waiting in the wings, between the ocean and the shore
But this time I'm leaving to stay, I'm walking away

I seen the red sky in the morning
I seen the low tide slipping away
I do believe I'll take warning,
taking my leave to stay

Chorus

Like an angel afraid to fly
Like the last lonely rose hung on the vine
