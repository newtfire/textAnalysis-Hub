<lyrics>


<l>I can't believe in what I've seen

I been forsaken, I been deceived
Cast aside and left behind
I can't believe my own eyes


</l>
<l>I been waiting for the glory, of the coming of the Lord

I heard a lot of stories, but all my prayers have been ignored
I been waiting in the wings, between the ocean and the shore
But this time I'm leaving to stay, I'm walking away


</l>
<l>I seen the red sky in the morning

I seen the low tide slipping away
I do believe I'll take warning,
taking my leave to stay


</l>
<l>Chorus

</l><l>Like an angel afraid to fly</l>
<l>Like the last lonely rose hung on the vine</l></lyrics></xml>
