<lyrics>



If you're gonna walk on my love, baby

The least you can do is take off your shoes

Yeah, if you're gonna walk on my love, baby

The least you can do is take off your shoes

Yes, how can you hurt me so bad, baby

After I've been so good to you



Coming home last night about half past ten

I saw you with another man, baby

Coming out of the Dewdrop Inn

You know I recognized the dress

I bought you, baby

To match your red shoes

But you said if I didn't touch you

Hey, I could have been used



If you're gonna walk on my love, baby

The least you can do is take off your shoes

I wanna know how can you hurt me so bad, baby

After I've been so good to you



Your love is so good, baby

You know it's hard to complain

But I've been out here knocking about fifteen minutes

In this cold pouring rain

I hear the music played inside

So you know I know you're at home

Who's in there with you, baby

I believe you are doing me wrong



If you're gonna walk on my love, baby

The least you can do is take off your shoes

I wanna know how can you hurt me so bad, baby

After I've been so good to you



Please walk beside me, baby

Why do you wanna treat me like a fool

Oh please, please, walk beside me, baby

Why do you treat me like a fool

If you're just gonna walk on my love, baby

Baby, please take off your shoes



Oh, baby, baby, baby

I know you hear me calling you

Oh, I know you know your name, baby

Why do you treat me just like a fool

Yeah, if you're just gonna

Gonna walk on my love, baby

Oh, do me a favor, please take off your shoes

Take 'em all, baby

Oh, yeah
