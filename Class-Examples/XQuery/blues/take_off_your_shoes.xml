<lyrics>


<l>If you're gonna walk on my love, baby

</l>
<l>The least you can do is take off your shoes

</l>
<l>Yeah, if you're gonna walk on my love, baby

</l>
<l>The least you can do is take off your shoes

</l>
<l>Yes, how can you hurt me so bad, baby

</l>
<l>After I've been so good to you



</l>
<l>Coming home last night about half past ten

</l>
<l>I saw you with another man, baby

</l>
<l>Coming out of the Dewdrop Inn

</l>
<l>You know I recognized the dress

</l>
<l>I bought you, baby

</l>
<l>To match your red shoes

</l>
<l>But you said if I didn't touch you

</l>
<l>Hey, I could have been used



</l>
<l>If you're gonna walk on my love, baby

</l>
<l>The least you can do is take off your shoes

</l>
<l>I wanna know how can you hurt me so bad, baby

</l>
<l>After I've been so good to you



</l>
<l>Your love is so good, baby

</l>
<l>You know it's hard to complain

</l>
<l>But I've been out here knocking about fifteen minutes

</l>
<l>In this cold pouring rain

</l>
<l>I hear the music played inside

</l>
<l>So you know I know you're at home

</l>
<l>Who's in there with you, baby

</l>
<l>I believe you are doing me wrong



</l>
<l>If you're gonna walk on my love, baby

</l>
<l>The least you can do is take off your shoes

</l>
<l>I wanna know how can you hurt me so bad, baby

</l>
<l>After I've been so good to you



</l>
<l>Please walk beside me, baby

</l>
<l>Why do you wanna treat me like a fool

</l>
<l>Oh please, please, walk beside me, baby

</l>
<l>Why do you treat me like a fool

</l>
<l>If you're just gonna walk on my love, baby

</l>
<l>Baby, please take off your shoes



</l>
<l>Oh, baby, baby, baby

</l>
<l>I know you hear me calling you

</l>
<l>Oh, I know you know your name, baby

</l>
<l>Why do you treat me just like a fool

</l>
<l>Yeah, if you're just gonna

</l>
<l>Gonna walk on my love, baby

</l>
<l>Oh, do me a favor, please take off your shoes

</l>
<l>Take 'em all, baby

</l><l>Oh, yeah</l></lyrics></xml>
