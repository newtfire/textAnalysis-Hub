<lyrics>



Further on up the road, someone's gonna hurt you like you hurt me

Further on up the road, someone's gonna hurt you like you hurt me

Further on up the road, just you wait and see



Now you're laughing pretty baby but one day you'll be cryin'

You're laughing pretty baby but one day you'll be cryin'

Further on up the road, you'll see I wasn't lyin'



Further on up the road, someone's gonna hurt you like you hurt me

Further on up the road, someone's gonna hurt you like you hurt me

Further on up the road, just you wait and see

Here we go



Now you're laughing pretty baby but one day you'll be cryin'

You're laughing pretty baby but one day you'll be cryin'

Further on up the road, you'll see I wasn't lyin'



Further on up the road, someone's gonna hurt you like you hurt me

Further on up the road, someone's gonna hurt you like you hurt me

Further on up the road, just you wait and see, yeah



Now you're laughing pretty baby but one day you'll be cryin'

You're laughing pretty baby but one day you'll be cryin'

Further on up the road, you'll see I wasn't lyin'



Further on up the road

Further on up the road

Further on up the road

Further on up the road

Further on up the road

Further on up the road



Further on up the road

Further on up the road

Further on up the road

Further on up the road, yeah

Further on up the road

Someone's gonna hurt you
