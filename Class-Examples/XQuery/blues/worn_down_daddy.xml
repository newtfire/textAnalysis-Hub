<lyrics>



The time has come for us to part

I ain't goin' to cry, it won't break my heart

'Cause I'm through with you, and I hope you don't feel hurt



You're a like an old horse shoe, that's had its day

You're like an old shoe, I must go away

I'm through with you, and I hope you don't feel hurt



You're like an old ship, that sprung a leak

You ain't young no more, and your loving is weak

Now you know I'm through with you, and I hope you don't feel hurt



You ain't got no money, you are down and broke

You're just an old has-been, like a worn-out joke

Say I'm through with you, and I hope you don't feel hurt
