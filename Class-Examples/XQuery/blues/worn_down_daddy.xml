<lyrics>


<l>The time has come for us to part

</l>
<l>I ain't goin' to cry, it won't break my heart

</l>
<l>'Cause I'm through with you, and I hope you don't feel hurt



</l>
<l>You're a like an old horse shoe, that's had its day

</l>
<l>You're like an old shoe, I must go away

</l>
<l>I'm through with you, and I hope you don't feel hurt



</l>
<l>You're like an old ship, that sprung a leak

</l>
<l>You ain't young no more, and your loving is weak

</l>
<l>Now you know I'm through with you, and I hope you don't feel hurt



</l>
<l>You ain't got no money, you are down and broke

</l>
<l>You're just an old has-been, like a worn-out joke

</l>
<l>Say I'm through with you, and I hope you don't feel hurt</l></lyrics></xml>
