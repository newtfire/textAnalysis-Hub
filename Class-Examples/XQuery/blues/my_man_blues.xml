<lyrics>



Clara: who was that man I saw you with the other day?


Bessie: that was my smooth black daddy that we call Charlie
Gray

Don't you know that's my man?

Yes, that's a fact


I ain't seen your name printed up and down his back

You better let him be


What old gal?


Because you ain't talkin' to me

That's my man, I want him for my own


(spoken: No! No!)


He's my sweet daddy

You'd better leave that man alone

See that suit he's got on?

I bought it last week


I've been buyin' clothes for five years for that is my black
sheik

Is that you honey?

(Charlie) 'Tain't nobody but, who's back here?


It sounds like Charlie

It is my man, sweet papa Charlie Gray


Your man?

How do you git that way?

Now, look here, honey, I been had that man for umpteen year


Child, didn't I turn your damper
1
 down?

Yes, Clara, and I've cut you every way but loose!


Well, you might as well be get it fixed

Well, then...



I guess we got to have him on cooperation plan

I guess we got to have him on cooperation plan

(spoken: 
Bessie!
 Clara!)

(Bessie and Clara together) Ain't nothin' different 'bout that rotten
two time man



How about it?


Suits me!

Suits me!

Well then...!
