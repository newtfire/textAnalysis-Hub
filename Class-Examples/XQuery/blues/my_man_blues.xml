<l>Clara: who was that man I saw you with the other day?


</l>
<l>Bessie: that was my smooth black daddy that we call Charlie
Gray

</l>
<l>Don't you know that's my man?

</l>
<l>Yes, that's a fact


</l>
<l>I ain't seen your name printed up and down his back

</l>
<l>You better let him be


</l>
<l>What old gal?


</l>
<l>Because you ain't talkin' to me

</l>
<l>That's my man, I want him for my own


</l>
<l>(spoken: No! No!)


</l>
<l>He's my sweet daddy

</l>
<l>You'd better leave that man alone

</l>
<l>See that suit he's got on?

</l>
<l>I bought it last week


</l>
<l>I've been buyin' clothes for five years for that is my black
sheik

</l>
<l>Is that you honey?

</l>
<l>(Charlie) 'Tain't nobody but, who's back here?


</l>
<l>It sounds like Charlie

</l>
<l>It is my man, sweet papa Charlie Gray


</l>
<l>Your man?

</l>
<l>How do you git that way?

</l>
<l>Now, look here, honey, I been had that man for umpteen year


</l>
<l>Child, didn't I turn your damper
1
down? </l>
<l>
Yes, Clara, and I've cut you every way but loose!


</l>
<l>Well, you might as well be get it fixed

</l>
<l>Well, then...



</l>
<l>I guess we got to have him on cooperation plan

</l>
<l>I guess we got to have him on cooperation plan

</l>
<l>(spoken: 
Bessie!
Clara!) </l>
<l>

(Bessie and Clara together) Ain't nothin' different 'bout that rotten
two time man




</l>
<l>How about it?


</l>
<l>Suits me!

</l>
<l>Suits me!

</l>
<l>Well then...!
