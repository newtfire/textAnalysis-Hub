<lyrics>

<l>Daddy, oh daddy won't you answer me please?

</l>
<l>Daddy, oh daddy won't you answer me please?

</l>
<l>All day I stood by your coffin tryin' to give my poor heart ease



</l>
<l>I run
1
my hands over your head and whispered in your </l>
<l>ear

</l>
<l>I run
1
my hands over your head and whispered in your </l>
<l>ear

</l>
<l>And I wonder if you know that your mama is near



</l>
<l>You told me that you love me and I believe what you said

</l>
<l>You told me that you love me and I believe what you said

</l>
<l>And I wish that I could fall here across your coffin dead



</l>
<l>When I left the undertaker, I couldn't help but cry

</l>
<l>When I left the undertaker, I couldn't help but cry

</l>
<l>And it hurt me so bad, to tell the man I love goodbye



</l>
