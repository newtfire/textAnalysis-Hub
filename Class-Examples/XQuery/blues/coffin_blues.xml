<lyrics>



Daddy, oh daddy won't you answer me please?

Daddy, oh daddy won't you answer me please?

All day I stood by your coffin tryin' to give my poor heart ease



I run
1
 my hands over your head and whispered in your
ear

I run
1
 my hands over your head and whispered in your
ear

And I wonder if you know that your mama is near



You told me that you love me and I believe what you said

You told me that you love me and I believe what you said

And I wish that I could fall here across your coffin dead



When I left the undertaker, I couldn't help but cry

When I left the undertaker, I couldn't help but cry

And it hurt me so bad, to tell the man I love goodbye



__________
