<lyrics>


<l>I used to wake up in the morning with an aching head,

</l>
<l>I couldn't remember anything I'd said

</l>
<l>My friends told me I was getting out of line,

</l>
<l>if it wasn't for you baby, I'd be doing time



</l>
<l>Since I met you baby, you've made a new man of me

</l>
<l>Since I met you baby, I'm happy as a man could be

</l>
<l>Yes I am



</l>
<l>I used to think I was better than the rest

</l>
<l>Ain't no doubt about it, I was no second best

</l>
<l>Didn't seem to matter what was right or what was wrong

</l>
<l>I did some crazy things before you came along

</l>
<l>Since I met you baby, you've made a new man of me



</l>
<l>Since I met you baby, I'm happy as a man could be

</l>
<l>Yes, I am



</l>
<l>Since I met you baby

</l>
<l>Since I met you baby

</l>
<l>Since I met you baby

</l>
<l>Since I met you baby

</l>
<l>Since I met you baby

</l>
<l>I'm happy as a man could be

</l>
<l>One more time!



</l>
<l>Since I met you baby

</l>
<l>Since I met you baby

</l>
<l>Since I met you baby

</l>
<l>Since I met you baby

</l>
<l>Since I met you baby

</l>
<l>Since I met you baby

</l>
<l>Since I met you baby

</l>
<l>Since I met you baby

</l>
<l>Well, since I met you baby,

</l>
<l>I'm happy as a man could be

</l>
<l>Yes, I am



</l>
<l>Happy as a man can be

</l>
<l>You tell 'em Gary!

</l>
<l>Yeah!</l></lyrics></xml>
