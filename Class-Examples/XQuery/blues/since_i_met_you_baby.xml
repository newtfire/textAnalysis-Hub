<lyrics>



I used to wake up in the morning with an aching head,

I couldn't remember anything I'd said

My friends told me I was getting out of line,

if it wasn't for you baby, I'd be doing time



Since I met you baby, you've made a new man of me

Since I met you baby, I'm happy as a man could be

Yes I am



I used to think I was better than the rest

Ain't no doubt about it, I was no second best

Didn't seem to matter what was right or what was wrong

I did some crazy things before you came along

Since I met you baby, you've made a new man of me



Since I met you baby, I'm happy as a man could be

Yes, I am



Since I met you baby

Since I met you baby

Since I met you baby

Since I met you baby

Since I met you baby

I'm happy as a man could be

One more time!



Since I met you baby

Since I met you baby

Since I met you baby

Since I met you baby

Since I met you baby

Since I met you baby

Since I met you baby

Since I met you baby

Well, since I met you baby,

I'm happy as a man could be

Yes, I am



Happy as a man can be

You tell 'em Gary!

Yeah!
