<lyrics>


<l>It's the sugar so sweet

</l>
<l>The kind I like to eat

</l>
<l>You and me

</l>
<l>Tell no one else about it



</l>
<l>I'm gonna make you mine

</l>
<l>'Cause I know we've got the time

</l>
<l>Now and then baby

</l>
<l>Hey I want you to know



</l>
<l>I wanna marry you

</l>
<l>Isn't that what you want too

</l>
<l>I wanna marry you

</l>
<l>Isn't that what you want too



</l>
<l>Come on in the back of my '57

</l>
<l>Let me show you the way

</l>
<l>Way to heaven

</l>
<l>You're looking so sweet, yes you are

</l>
<l>I'll make sure that you got some heat



</l>
<l>I've got you on my mind

</l>
<l>You know you've got my time

</l>
<l>Now and then baby

</l>
<l>I want you to know



</l>
<l>I wanna marry you

</l>
<l>Isn't that what you want too

</l>
<l>I wanna marry you

</l>
<l>Isn't that what you want too



</l>
<l>I'm falling in love with you

</l>
<l>I'm in love with you

</l>
<l>You make all my dreams come true

</l>
<l>Make all my dreams come true

</l>
<l>Falling in love with you

</l>
<l>I wanna marry you



</l>
<l>I wanna marry you

</l>
<l>Isn't that what you want too

</l>
<l>I wanna marry you

</l>
<l>Isn't that what you want too</l></lyrics></xml>
