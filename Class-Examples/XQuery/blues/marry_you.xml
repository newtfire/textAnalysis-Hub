<lyrics>



It's the sugar so sweet

The kind I like to eat

You and me

Tell no one else about it



I'm gonna make you mine

'Cause I know we've got the time

Now and then baby

Hey I want you to know



I wanna marry you

Isn't that what you want too

I wanna marry you

Isn't that what you want too



Come on in the back of my '57

Let me show you the way

Way to heaven

You're looking so sweet, yes you are

I'll make sure that you got some heat



I've got you on my mind

You know you've got my time

Now and then baby

I want you to know



I wanna marry you

Isn't that what you want too

I wanna marry you

Isn't that what you want too



I'm falling in love with you

I'm in love with you

You make all my dreams come true

Make all my dreams come true

Falling in love with you

I wanna marry you



I wanna marry you

Isn't that what you want too

I wanna marry you

Isn't that what you want too
