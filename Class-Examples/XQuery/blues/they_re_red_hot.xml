<note>Note: some sources credit Robert's brother "Red" Johnson for this
song. The melody and chord pattern were widely known and recorded
under many different titles by many singers. Probably the best known
one is Big Bill Broonzy's Take Your Hands Off Her, recorded in 1935.
This song was the only example of a southern medicine show "hokum"
song that Robert recorded;

Note 1: tamales, Mexican Spanish spicy food consisting of ground meat
seasoned usually with chili, rolled in cornmeal dough, wrapped in
corn husks, and steamed.</note></lyrics></xml>
