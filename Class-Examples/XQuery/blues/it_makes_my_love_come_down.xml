<lyrics>



When I see two sweethearts spoon
1
, underneath the
silv'ry moon

It makes my love come down, I wanna be around

Kiss me, honey, it makes my love come down



Cuddle close, turn out the light, do just what you did last night

It makes my love come down, I wanna be in town

Sweet, sweet daddy, it makes my love come down



Wild about my 
toodle-oh
2
, when I gets
my toodle-oh

It makes my love come down, want every pound

Hear me cryin', it makes my love come down



Likes my coffee, likes my tea, daffy
3
 about my 
stingaree

It makes my love come down, I wanna be around

Oh, sweet papa, it makes my love come down



If you want to hear me rave, honey, give me what I crave

It makes my love come down, actin' like a clown

Can't help from braggin', it makes my love come down



Come on and be my desert sheik, you're so strong and I'm so weak

It makes my love come down, to be love-land bound

Red hot papa, it makes my love come down



If you want me for your own, kiss me nice and leave me alone

It makes my love come down, it makes my love come down

Take me bye-bye, it makes my love come down



When you take me for a ride, when I'm close up by your side

It makes my love come down, ridin' all around

Easy ridin' makes my love come down
