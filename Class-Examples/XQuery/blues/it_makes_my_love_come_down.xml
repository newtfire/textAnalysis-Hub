<lyrics>

<l>When I see two sweethearts spoon
1
, underneath the
silv'ry moon

</l>
<l>It makes my love come down, I wanna be around

</l>
<l>Kiss me, honey, it makes my love come down



</l>
<l>Cuddle close, turn out the light, do just what you did last night

</l>
<l>It makes my love come down, I wanna be in town

</l>
<l>Sweet, sweet daddy, it makes my love come down



</l>
<l>Wild about my 
toodle-oh
2
, when I gets
my toodle-oh

</l>
<l>It makes my love come down, want every pound

</l>
<l>Hear me cryin', it makes my love come down



</l>
<l>Likes my coffee, likes my tea, daffy
3
about my  </l>
<l>stingaree

</l>
<l>It makes my love come down, I wanna be around

</l>
<l>Oh, sweet papa, it makes my love come down



</l>
<l>If you want to hear me rave, honey, give me what I crave

</l>
<l>It makes my love come down, actin' like a clown

</l>
<l>Can't help from braggin', it makes my love come down



</l>
<l>Come on and be my desert sheik, you're so strong and I'm so weak

</l>
<l>It makes my love come down, to be love-land bound

</l>
<l>Red hot papa, it makes my love come down



</l>
<l>If you want me for your own, kiss me nice and leave me alone

</l>
<l>It makes my love come down, it makes my love come down

</l>
<l>Take me bye-bye, it makes my love come down



</l>
<l>When you take me for a ride, when I'm close up by your side

</l>
<l>It makes my love come down, ridin' all around

</l>
<l>Easy ridin' makes my love come down



</l>
