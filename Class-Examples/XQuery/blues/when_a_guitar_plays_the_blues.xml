<lyrics>



You get the strangest kinda feelin', that's when the guitar plays the
blues

I say, you get the strangest kinda feelin', that's when a guitar
plays the blues

Your body gets the message, and you know, you know, your soul has
just got to move



You might even bat your eye

You might even snap or cry

The feelin' you're feelin' within you babe

You know you just can't hide



You're kinda strokin' like that

You're kinda bendin' like this

And it reaches down inside you

And your soul just can't resist

You get the same kinda feelin'

When the guitar plays the blues

Your body sure gets the message

Yes, you know, you know, your soul has just got to move



And when the music is over

And it's time to turn out the lights

You know the blues goes home with ya

Soothes you through the night



You get the strange kinda feelin'

When the guitar plays the blues

Your body gets the message

And you know, you know, you know

Your soul has just got to move
