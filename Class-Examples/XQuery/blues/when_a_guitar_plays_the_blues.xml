<lyrics>


<l>You get the strangest kinda feelin', that's when the guitar plays the
blues

</l>
<l>I say, you get the strangest kinda feelin', that's when a guitar
plays the blues

</l>
<l>Your body gets the message, and you know, you know, your soul has

just got to move




</l>
<l>You might even bat your eye

</l>
<l>You might even snap or cry

</l>
<l>The feelin' you're feelin' within you babe

</l>
<l>You know you just can't hide



</l>
<l>You're kinda strokin' like that

</l>
<l>You're kinda bendin' like this

</l>
<l>And it reaches down inside you

</l>
<l>And your soul just can't resist

</l>
<l>You get the same kinda feelin'

</l>
<l>When the guitar plays the blues

</l>
<l>Your body sure gets the message

</l>
<l>Yes, you know, you know, your soul has just got to move



</l>
<l>And when the music is over

</l>
<l>And it's time to turn out the lights

</l>
<l>You know the blues goes home with ya

</l>
<l>Soothes you through the night



</l>
<l>You get the strange kinda feelin'

</l>
<l>When the guitar plays the blues

</l>
<l>Your body gets the message

</l>
<l>And you know, you know, you know

</l>
<l>Your soul has just got to move</l></lyrics></xml>
