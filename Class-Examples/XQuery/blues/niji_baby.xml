<lyrics>


<l>I walk in my bedroom floor

</l>
<l>I hung my head and cry

</l>
<l>I gotta find my baby

</l>
<l>You know I can't be satisfied

</l>
<l>I gotta find my baby

</l>
<l>I declare I wouldn't lie

</l>
<l>You know if I don't find my baby

</l>
<l>I believe I'm gonna lose my mind



</l>
<l>Yeah she's a fine lookin woman

</l>
<l>Her shape is a dream

</l>
<l>She's the loveliest woman people

</l>
<l>I declare I ever seen

</l>
<l>I gotta find my baby

</l>
<l>I declare I wouldn't lie

</l>
<l>You know if I don't find my baby

</l>
<l>I believe I'm gonna lose my mind



</l>
<l>I walk in my bedroom floor

</l>
<l>Hung down my head and cry

</l>
<l>I gotta find my baby

</l>
<l>You know I can't be satisfied

</l>
<l>I gotta find my baby

</l>
<l>I declare I wouldn't lie

</l>
