<lyrics>



I walk in my bedroom floor

I hung my head and cry

I gotta find my baby

You know I can't be satisfied

I gotta find my baby

I declare I wouldn't lie

You know if I don't find my baby

I believe I'm gonna lose my mind



Yeah she's a fine lookin woman

Her shape is a dream

She's the loveliest woman people

I declare I ever seen

I gotta find my baby

I declare I wouldn't lie

You know if I don't find my baby

I believe I'm gonna lose my mind



I walk in my bedroom floor

Hung down my head and cry

I gotta find my baby

You know I can't be satisfied

I gotta find my baby

I declare I wouldn't lie

You know if I don't find my baby

I believe I'm gonna lose my mind



You know I got to got to

I got to find my baby

hey yes I say

I gotta find my woman

I gotta find my woman

If I don't find my woman

I think I'going out of my mind
