<lyrics>


<l>You said you were hurting

</l>
<l>You almost lost your mind

</l>
<l>'Cause the girl you love she hurts you all the time

</l>
<l>When things go wrong, go wrong with you

</l>
<l>It hurts me too



</l>
<l>You love her more when you should love her less

</l>
<l>Why do you pick up behind her?

</l>
<l>and I know you pick up all her mess

</l>
<l>When things go wrong, go wrong with you

</l>
<l>It hurts me too



</l>
<l>Oh, so you better leave that girl

</l>
<l>Oh, you better put her down

</l>
<l>'Cause the girl you love

</l>
<l>She hurts you all the time

</l>
<l>When things go wrong, go wrong with you

</l>
<l>It hurts me too



</l>
<l>Now she loves another man and boy I love you

</l>
<l>But oh, I know that you love her

</l>
<l>I always see you stick to her like glue

</l>
<l>When things go wrong, go wrong with you

</l>
<l>It hurts me too



</l>
<l>Oh, so you better leave that girl

</l>
<l>Oh, you better put her down

</l>
<l>'Cause the girl you love

</l>
<l>She hurts you all the time

</l>
<l>When things go wrong, go wrong with you

</l>
<l>It hurts me too</l></lyrics></xml>
