<lyrics>



You said you were hurting

You almost lost your mind

'Cause the girl you love she hurts you all the time

When things go wrong, go wrong with you

It hurts me too



You love her more when you should love her less

Why do you pick up behind her?

and I know you pick up all her mess

When things go wrong, go wrong with you

It hurts me too



Oh, so you better leave that girl

Oh, you better put her down

'Cause the girl you love

She hurts you all the time

When things go wrong, go wrong with you

It hurts me too



Now she loves another man and boy I love you

But oh, I know that you love her

I always see you stick to her like glue

When things go wrong, go wrong with you

It hurts me too



Oh, so you better leave that girl

Oh, you better put her down

'Cause the girl you love

She hurts you all the time

When things go wrong, go wrong with you

It hurts me too
