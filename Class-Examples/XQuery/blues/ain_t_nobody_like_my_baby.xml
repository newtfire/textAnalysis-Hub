<lyrics>



I'm in love with a real fine woman and she gives me everything

I said I'm in love with a real fine woman and she gives me
everything

And it makes me feel so good, just to hear my baby call my name



My baby's sly way of loving, makes me feel so good I could sing

Hey my baby's sly way of loving, makes me feel so good I could
sing

I feel just like I'm a millionaire, when I hear my baby call my
name



Oh, there ain't nobody like my baby, that's the reason I love her
so

Oh, ain't nobody, nobody like my baby, that's the reason I love her
so

People, I would even die for her, I want the whole round world to
know



When I'm down she'll picks me up, she says, "Daddy, you can't
lose"

Oh, when I'm down, when I'm down, she picks me up, tells me, "Baby,
you can't lose"

When all of my friends forget about me, my baby keeps away all these
blues
