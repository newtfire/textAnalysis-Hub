<lyrics>


<l>I'm in love with a real fine woman and she gives me everything

</l>
<l>I said I'm in love with a real fine woman and she gives me
everything

</l>
<l>And it makes me feel so good, just to hear my baby call my name



</l>
<l>My baby's sly way of loving, makes me feel so good I could sing

</l>
<l>Hey my baby's sly way of loving, makes me feel so good I could
sing

</l>
<l>I feel just like I'm a millionaire, when I hear my baby call my

name




</l>
<l>Oh, there ain't nobody like my baby, that's the reason I love her
so

</l>
<l>Oh, ain't nobody, nobody like my baby, that's the reason I love her
so

</l>
<l>People, I would even die for her, I want the whole round world to

know




</l>
<l>When I'm down she'll picks me up, she says, "Daddy, you can't
lose"

</l>
<l>Oh, when I'm down, when I'm down, she picks me up, tells me, "Baby,
you can't lose"

</l>
<l>When all of my friends forget about me, my baby keeps away all these

blues
