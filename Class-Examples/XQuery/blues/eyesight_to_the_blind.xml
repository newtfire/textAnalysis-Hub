<lyrics>


<l>Yes your talkin' about your woman,

</l>
<l>wish to God, man, you could see mine

</l>
<l>Your talkin' about your woman,

</l>
<l>wish to God, man, you could see mine

</l>
<l>When she start lovin',

</l>
<l>she brings eyesight to the blind



</l>
<l>Her daddy must have been a millionaire,

</l>
<l>I can tell by the way she walks

</l>
<l>My baby's daddy must have been a millionaire,

</l>
<l>I can tell by the way she walks

</l>
<l>When she start walkin',

</l>
<l>the deaf and dumb begin to talk



</l>
<l>I remember one Friday morning,

</l>
<l>we were layin' down across the bed

</l>
<l>Man was in the next room dyin',

</l>
<l>knelt down and raised up his head

</l>
<l>And said ain't she pretty,

</l>
<l>the world know she's fine

</l>
<l>She start lovin',

</l>
<l>she brings eyesight to the blind</l></lyrics></xml>
