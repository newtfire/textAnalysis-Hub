<lyrics>



Yes your talkin' about your woman,

wish to God, man, you could see mine

Your talkin' about your woman,

wish to God, man, you could see mine

When she start lovin',

she brings eyesight to the blind



Her daddy must have been a millionaire,

I can tell by the way she walks

My baby's daddy must have been a millionaire,

I can tell by the way she walks

When she start walkin',

the deaf and dumb begin to talk



I remember one Friday morning,

we were layin' down across the bed

Man was in the next room dyin',

knelt down and raised up his head

And said ain't she pretty,

the world know she's fine

She start lovin',

she brings eyesight to the blind
