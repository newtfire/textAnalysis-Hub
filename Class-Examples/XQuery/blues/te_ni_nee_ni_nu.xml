<lyrics>

<l>I want you, to be my ti ni nee ni nu

</l>
<l>I want you, to be my ti ni nee ni nu

</l>
<l>Tell me the truth, ain't you my ti ni nee ni nu



</l>
<l>Now will you love, will you love me

</l>
<l>Will you squeeze me, come on don't tease me

</l>
<l>Tell me the truth, ain't you me ti ni nee ni nu



</l>
<l>Come on baby, work your show, walk the dog boog-a-loo, you got the
floor

</l>
<l>Everybodys watchin' you, you lookin' good baby, ain't that the
truth

</l>
<l>Now when you're through, come be my ti ni nee ni nu



</l>
<note>Note 1: ti ni nee ni nu, as far as I know this is just a non-sense
word creation. It probably has the meaning of "baby", "darling",
etc.</note></lyrics></xml>
