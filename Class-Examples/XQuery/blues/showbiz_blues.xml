<lyrics>



Tell me anybody, do you really give a damn for me?

I said, tell me anybody, do you really give a damn for me?

'Cause I just got to tell you 'bout a thing that's botherin' me



I was a ramblin' pony, I would roll, I would roll, I would roll from
town to town

I was a ramblin' pony, people, I would roll from town to town

Yes, just looking for a sweet woman and makin' all my love come on
down

Yeah



If I needed anybody, baby, I would take ya home with me

If I need anybody, baby, I would take ya, baby,

I would take ya, baby, I would take ya home with me

But I don't need anybody, don't need anybody but him and me



And you're sittin' there so green, believe me, man, I'm just the same
as you, yeah

Said you're sittin' there so green, believe me, man, I'm just the
same as you

Do you want me to make a last cry or be satisfied?

That's exactly what I mean to do
