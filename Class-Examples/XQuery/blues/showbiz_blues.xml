<lyrics>


<l>Tell me anybody, do you really give a damn for me?

</l>
<l>I said, tell me anybody, do you really give a damn for me?

</l>
<l>'Cause I just got to tell you 'bout a thing that's botherin' me



</l>
<l>I was a ramblin' pony, I would roll, I would roll, I would roll from
town to town

</l>
<l>I was a ramblin' pony, people, I would roll from town to town

</l>
<l>Yes, just looking for a sweet woman and makin' all my love come on
down

</l>
<l>Yeah



</l>
<l>If I needed anybody, baby, I would take ya home with me

</l>
<l>If I need anybody, baby, I would take ya, baby,

</l>
<l>I would take ya, baby, I would take ya home with me

</l>
<l>But I don't need anybody, don't need anybody but him and me



</l>
<l>And you're sittin' there so green, believe me, man, I'm just the same
as you, yeah

</l>
<l>Said you're sittin' there so green, believe me, man, I'm just the
same as you

</l>
<l>Do you want me to make a last cry or be satisfied?

</l><l>That's exactly what I mean to do</l></lyrics></xml>
