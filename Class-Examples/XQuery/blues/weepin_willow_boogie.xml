<l>Well, my baby she long and she tall and she weep like a willow
tree

</l>
<l>Well, my baby long and she's tall and she weep like a willow tree

</l>
<l>Ev'ry time she love me, she make my love come down



</l>
<l>I seen my baby this mornin', she was weepin' to herself

</l>
<l>I seen my baby this mornin', she was weepin' to herself

</l>
<l>She says, "John Lee, I need lovin' and I just can't help myself, yes,

baby"




</l>
<l>Uh, huh?



</l>
<l>Hey, yes love me, love me, love me, daddy, love me all night long

</l>
<l>Yeah, love me, love me, daddy and love me all night long

</l>
<l>'Cause your baby, she need lovin', lovin' with a thrill</l></lyrics></xml>
