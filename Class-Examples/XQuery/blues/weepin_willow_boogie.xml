<lyrics>



Well, my baby she long and she tall and she weep like a willow
tree

Well, my baby long and she's tall and she weep like a willow tree

Ev'ry time she love me, she make my love come down



I seen my baby this mornin', she was weepin' to herself

I seen my baby this mornin', she was weepin' to herself

She says, "John Lee, I need lovin' and I just can't help myself, yes,
baby"



Uh, huh?



Hey, yes love me, love me, love me, daddy, love me all night long

Yeah, love me, love me, daddy and love me all night long

'Cause your baby, she need lovin', lovin' with a thrill
