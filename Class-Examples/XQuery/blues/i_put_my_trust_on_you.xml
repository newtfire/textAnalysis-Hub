<l>I couldn't believe, I couldn't believe you'd let me down

</l>
<l>I just couldn't believe, I couldn't believe, you would let me
down

</l>
<l>I've been too good to you baby, you hurt me with what you did



</l>
<l>My friend tried to tell me, you didn't mean me no good

</l>
<l>I didn't believe a word he said, I couldn't believe it, whoo

</l>
<l>I couldn't believe, you would let me down

</l>

</l>
<l>I can't believe you would let me down



</l>
<l>You goes downtown, to the judge

</l>
<l>You tell the judge, everything you got, give it to me

</l>
