<lyrics>



I couldn't believe, I couldn't believe you'd let me down

I just couldn't believe, I couldn't believe, you would let me
down

I've been too good to you baby, you hurt me with what you did



My friend tried to tell me, you didn't mean me no good

I didn't believe a word he said, I couldn't believe it, whoo

I couldn't believe, you would let me down

I done lost everything that I had baby,

I can't believe you would let me down



You goes downtown, to the judge

You tell the judge, everything you got, give it to me

You looked up at me

Hit the road Jack,

and don't come back no more

I couldn't believe, you let me down, baby

I'm leavin' now baby, done lost my home

My brand new car baby

I know, I know another man,

gonna move in

But I can't believe, treatin' me the way you did



Now baby, look-a here baby

How could you treat me the way you did baby

I just couldn't believe, I couldn't believe you would let me
down,

good as I been to you baby

I'm goin' now baby

All I, all I got, all I got, is on my back

I've gotta go now baby

I better go now baby, baby

I just couldn't believe, hmmmm

Ooh, aah yeah, yeah, aye baby
