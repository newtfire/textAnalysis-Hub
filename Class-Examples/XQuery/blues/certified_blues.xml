<lyrics>



I woke up this mornin' with these certified blues, they sure been
stalkin' me 'round

So down tonight I couldn't tie my shoes

They about to drop me in the ground



If I could shake loose I would feel so fine

There's one thing for sure and it's on my mind

These certified blues are gonna take their time



I've been livin' here, way down South, a place that I wanna stay

Been workin' hard just to feed my mouth

Just can keep them blues away



There's one thing for sure and it's on my mind

These certified blues are gonna take their time

If I could shake loose I would feel so fine



You say you're feelin' bad and you don't know why

You're broke and your woman been ly'n'

And just one thing before I'm fired, the blues have just been
certified



If I could shake loose I would feel so fine

There's one thing for sure and it's on my mind

These certified blues are gonna take their time
