<lyrics>


<l>I woke up this mornin' with these certified blues, they sure been
stalkin' me 'round

</l>
<l>So down tonight I couldn't tie my shoes

</l>
<l>They about to drop me in the ground



</l>
<l>If I could shake loose I would feel so fine

</l>
<l>There's one thing for sure and it's on my mind

</l>
<l>These certified blues are gonna take their time



</l>
<l>I've been livin' here, way down South, a place that I wanna stay

</l>
<l>Been workin' hard just to feed my mouth

</l>
<l>Just can keep them blues away



</l>
<l>There's one thing for sure and it's on my mind

</l>
<l>These certified blues are gonna take their time

</l>
<l>If I could shake loose I would feel so fine



</l>
<l>You say you're feelin' bad and you don't know why

</l>
<l>You're broke and your woman been ly'n'

</l>
<l>And just one thing before I'm fired, the blues have just been

certified




</l>
<l>If I could shake loose I would feel so fine

</l>
<l>There's one thing for sure and it's on my mind

</l><l>These certified blues are gonna take their time</l></lyrics></xml>
