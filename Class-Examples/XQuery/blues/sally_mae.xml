<lyrics>



Sally Mae, Sally Mae

Lord, you know you ain't treat'n me right

Sally Mae, Sally Mae

Lord, you know you ain't treat'n me right

You stay out all night long,

Lord, you know you ain't treat'n me right



You're a no good weed
1

Lord, the cows, won't mow you down

You're a no good weed

Lord, the cows, won't mow you down

I was chief of police, I would drive you out of town

George! Play the blues!



You ought to leave this town, Sally Mae

You ought to leave here to stay

You ought to leave this town

Y'ought to leave here to stay

Your reputation, Sally Mae,

your reputation ain't no good



Sally Mae, Sally Mae

Y'ought to change in your younger days

Yeah!

Sally Mae, Sally Mae

Y'oughtta change your ways in your younger days

Better change now Sally Mae,

change in your younger days



__________

Note 1: weed, .
