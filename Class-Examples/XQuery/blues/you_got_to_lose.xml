<lyrics>



You got to lose

You can't win all the time

You got to lose

You can't win all the time

Well I know pretty baby

I see trouble comin' down the line



Well I was out on the streets baby

I did not have no money

Don't you worry pretty baby

I'll be back on my feet soon honey



You got to lose

You can't win all the time

Well I know pretty baby

I see trouble comin' down the line



You got to lose

You can't win all the time

You got to lose

You can't win all the time

Yes I know pretty baby

I see trouble comin' down the line



Yeah I was out on the streets

I did not have no friends

I didn't have no money

And nothing I could spend



You got to lose

You can't win all the time

Well I know pretty baby

I see trouble comin' down the line
