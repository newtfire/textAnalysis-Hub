<l>You got to lose

</l>
<l>You can't win all the time

</l>
<l>You got to lose

</l>
<l>You can't win all the time

</l>
<l>Well I know pretty baby

</l>
<l>I see trouble comin' down the line



</l>
<l>Well I was out on the streets baby

</l>
<l>I did not have no money

</l>
<l>Don't you worry pretty baby

</l>
<l>I'll be back on my feet soon honey



</l>
<l>You got to lose

</l>
<l>You can't win all the time

</l>
<l>Well I know pretty baby

</l>
<l>I see trouble comin' down the line



</l>
<l>You got to lose

</l>
<l>You can't win all the time

</l>
<l>You got to lose

</l>
<l>You can't win all the time

</l>
<l>Yes I know pretty baby

</l>
<l>I see trouble comin' down the line



</l>
<l>Yeah I was out on the streets

</l>
<l>I did not have no friends

</l>
<l>I didn't have no money

</l>
<l>And nothing I could spend



</l>
<l>You got to lose

</l>
<l>You can't win all the time

</l>
<l>Well I know pretty baby

</l>
<l>I see trouble comin' down the line</l></lyrics></xml>
