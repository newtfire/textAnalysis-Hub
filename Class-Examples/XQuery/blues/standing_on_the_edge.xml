<lyrics>


<l>Late last night I was dreaming

</l>
<l>I was dreaming of your charms

</l>
<l>I was standing

</l>
<l>On the edge of love, darling

</l>
<l>With you in my arms



</l>
<l>Well you whispered sweet things

</l>
<l>And told me

</l>
<l>That you loved me and always be true

</l>
<l>And you'd stand

</l>
<l>On the edge of love with me

</l>
<l>If I'd stand with you



</l>
<l>I'm standing on the edge of love

</l>
<l>Just about to slip and fall

</l>
<l>Standing on the edge of love, darling

</l>
<l>Waiting on your call

</l>
<l>You know I'm standing on the edge of love

</l>
<l>Just about to lose my mind

</l>
<l>Standing on the edge of love, darling

</l>
<l>Waiting on you one more time



</l>
<l>Now a young man's mind will wander

</l>
<l>Wander to distant shores

</l>
<l>If you'll just come here

</l>
<l>And stand with me

</l>
<l>I won't wander no more



</l>
<l>I promise to stop all of my gambling

</l>
<l>Even stop staying out late all night

</l>
<l>Might even settle down and have babies

</l>
<l>Treat ourselves right



</l>
<l>'Cause a young man's dreams are many

</l>
<l>Lord, so few come true

</l>
<l>So if you'll just come here

</l>
<l>And stand with me

</l>
<l>I'll stand with you



</l>
<l>That's why I say you know

</l>
<l>I'm standing on the edge of love

</l>
<l>Just about to slip and fall

</l>
<l>Standing on the edge of love, darling

</l>
<l>Waiting on your call, that's why I say

</l>
<l>You know, I'm standing on the edge of love

</l>
<l>Just about to lose my mind

</l>
<l>Standing on the edge of love, darling

</l>
<l>Waiting on you one more time



</l>
<l>That's why I'm standing, standing

</l>
<l>Standing, yes, I'm standing

</l>
<l>Standing on the edge of love

</l>
<l>Waiting on you one more time



</l>
<l>That's why I'm standing, standing

</l>
<l>Standing, yes, I'm standing

</l>
<l>Standing on the edge of love

</l>
<l>Waiting on you one more time



</l>
<l>That's why I'm standing, standing

</l>
<l>Standing, yes, I'm standing

</l>
<l>Standing on the edge of love

</l><l>One more time</l></lyrics></xml>
