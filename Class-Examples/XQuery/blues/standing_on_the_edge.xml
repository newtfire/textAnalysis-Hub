<lyrics>



Late last night I was dreaming

I was dreaming of your charms

I was standing

On the edge of love, darling

With you in my arms



Well you whispered sweet things

And told me

That you loved me and always be true

And you'd stand

On the edge of love with me

If I'd stand with you



I'm standing on the edge of love

Just about to slip and fall

Standing on the edge of love, darling

Waiting on your call

You know I'm standing on the edge of love

Just about to lose my mind

Standing on the edge of love, darling

Waiting on you one more time



Now a young man's mind will wander

Wander to distant shores

If you'll just come here

And stand with me

I won't wander no more



I promise to stop all of my gambling

Even stop staying out late all night

Might even settle down and have babies

Treat ourselves right



'Cause a young man's dreams are many

Lord, so few come true

So if you'll just come here

And stand with me

I'll stand with you



That's why I say you know

I'm standing on the edge of love

Just about to slip and fall

Standing on the edge of love, darling

Waiting on your call, that's why I say

You know, I'm standing on the edge of love

Just about to lose my mind

Standing on the edge of love, darling

Waiting on you one more time



That's why I'm standing, standing

Standing, yes, I'm standing

Standing on the edge of love

Waiting on you one more time



That's why I'm standing, standing

Standing, yes, I'm standing

Standing on the edge of love

Waiting on you one more time



That's why I'm standing, standing

Standing, yes, I'm standing

Standing on the edge of love

One more time
