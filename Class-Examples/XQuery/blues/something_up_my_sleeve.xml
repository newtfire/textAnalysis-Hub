<l>I've got something up my sleeve

</l>
<l>I've got something up my sleeve



</l>
<l>Without saying the word

</l>
<l>I'm ready for a party tonight

</l>
<l>My fire is on the front burner

</l>
<l>Can't you tell by the mood I'm in

</l>
<l>You have no need to doubt

</l>
<l>Do I have to spell it out

</l>
<l>Just read between the lines

</l>
<l>Yeah, tonight we're going to unwind



</l>
<l>I'll make you see

</l>
<l>Baby, we can talk it out

</l>
<l>Everything, everything

</l>
<l>That I'm thinking about



</l>
<l>I've got something up my sleeve

</l>
<l>I've got something up my sleeve

</l>
<l>Something up my sleeve



</l>
<l>There's a place just for two

</l>
<l>And it's just right for me and you

</l>
<l>To let our emotions go free

</l>
<l>And be what we wanna be

</l>
<l>Turn off the lights

</l>
<l>Pull out the phone

</l>
<l>Do not disturb

</l>
<l>Nobody's home



</l>
<l>Baby, for so long

</l>
<l>I wanted to get next to you

</l>
<l>Just let me love you

</l>
<l>There's no telling what I may do

</l>
<l>'Cause:



</l>
<l>I've got something up my sleeve

</l>
<l>I've got something up my sleeve

</l>
<l>Something up my sleeve



</l>
<l>Stay with me, baby

</l>
<l>We can work it out

</l>
<l>Just let me get next to you

</l>
<l>Ain't no telling what I may do



</l>
<l>I've got something up my sleeve

</l>
<l>I've got something up my sleeve

</l>
<l>I've got something up my sleeve

</l>
<l>I've got something up my sleeve, baby

</l>
<l>I've got something, baby

</l>
<l>Up my sleeve, baby

</l>
<l>Give me a chance

</l>
<l>I've got something, baby...</l></lyrics></xml>
