<lyrics>



I've got something up my sleeve

I've got something up my sleeve



Without saying the word

I'm ready for a party tonight

My fire is on the front burner

Can't you tell by the mood I'm in

You have no need to doubt

Do I have to spell it out

Just read between the lines

Yeah, tonight we're going to unwind



I'll make you see

Baby, we can talk it out

Everything, everything

That I'm thinking about



I've got something up my sleeve

I've got something up my sleeve

Something up my sleeve



There's a place just for two

And it's just right for me and you

To let our emotions go free

And be what we wanna be

Turn off the lights

Pull out the phone

Do not disturb

Nobody's home



Baby, for so long

I wanted to get next to you

Just let me love you

There's no telling what I may do

'Cause:



I've got something up my sleeve

I've got something up my sleeve

Something up my sleeve



Stay with me, baby

We can work it out

Just let me get next to you

Ain't no telling what I may do



I've got something up my sleeve

I've got something up my sleeve

I've got something up my sleeve

I've got something up my sleeve, baby

I've got something, baby

Up my sleeve, baby

Give me a chance

I've got something, baby...
