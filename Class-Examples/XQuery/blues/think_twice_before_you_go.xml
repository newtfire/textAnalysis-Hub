<lyrics>



Think twice before you go, baby, this will be the end

Think twice before you go, baby, this will be the end

You done leave me one time, baby you'll leave again



Dig in and suffer with me, an' I know you paid your dues

Dig in and suffer with me baby, an' I know you paid your dues

You done leave me when I need you, then I know you stand accused



Doing the man who loves you wrong

Breaking the heart you should be ruling

Doing the man who loves you wrong

I go for a lot of things, but you're a little too strong



Think twice before you go, baby this will be the end

Think twice before you go, baby this will be the end

You done leave me one time, baby, you'll leave again

Ha
