<l>Think twice before you go, baby, this will be the end

</l>
<l>Think twice before you go, baby, this will be the end

</l>
<l>You done leave me one time, baby you'll leave again



</l>
<l>Dig in and suffer with me, an' I know you paid your dues

</l>
<l>Dig in and suffer with me baby, an' I know you paid your dues

</l>
<l>You done leave me when I need you, then I know you stand accused



</l>
<l>Doing the man who loves you wrong

</l>
<l>Breaking the heart you should be ruling

</l>
<l>Doing the man who loves you wrong

</l>
<l>I go for a lot of things, but you're a little too strong



</l>
<l>Think twice before you go, baby this will be the end

</l>
<l>Think twice before you go, baby this will be the end

</l>
<l>You done leave me one time, baby, you'll leave again

</l>
