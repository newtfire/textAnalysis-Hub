<lyrics>


<l>Way back yonder in the days of old

</l>
<l>The men was workin' but not savin' any dough

</l>
<l>Then came a woman lookin' real cool

</l>
<l>She said to herself "Now, that's my fool"

</l>
<l>I'm gonna ball tonight

</l>
<l>I'm gonna ball tonight

</l>
<l>Well you can't break the rule because every man is some woman's

fool




</l>
<l>Met a girl on the avenue

</l>
<l>She was shy and I was blue

</l>
<l>Like a teacher and a student in the school

</l>
<l>Looked at me and said "You're my fool"

</l>
<l>Gonna ball tonight

</l>
<l>We're gonna ball tonight

</l>
<l>Man I can't break a rule cause every man is some woman's fool



</l>
<l>Way back yonder in the days of old

</l>
<l>The men was workin' but not savin' any dough

</l>
<l>Then came a woman lookin' real cool

</l>
<l>She said to herself "Now, that's my fool"

</l>
<l>I'm gonna ball tonight

</l>
<l>I'm gonna ball tonight

</l>
<l>Well you can't break the rule because every man is some woman's

fool




</l>
<l>I'm gonna ball tonight

</l>
<l>We're gonna ball tonight

</l>
<l>We're gonna ball tonight

</l>
<l>We're gonna ball tonight

</l><l>Well I can't break the rule because every man is some woman's</l>
<l>fool</l></lyrics></xml>
