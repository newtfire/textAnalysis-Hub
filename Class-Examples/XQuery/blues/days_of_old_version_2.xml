<lyrics>



Way back yonder in the days of old

The men was workin' but not savin' any dough

Then came a woman lookin' real cool

She said to herself "Now, that's my fool"

I'm gonna ball tonight

I'm gonna ball tonight

Well you can't break the rule because every man is some woman's
fool



Met a girl on the avenue

She was shy and I was blue

Like a teacher and a student in the school

Looked at me and said "You're my fool"

Gonna ball tonight

We're gonna ball tonight

Man I can't break a rule cause every man is some woman's fool



Way back yonder in the days of old

The men was workin' but not savin' any dough

Then came a woman lookin' real cool

She said to herself "Now, that's my fool"

I'm gonna ball tonight

I'm gonna ball tonight

Well you can't break the rule because every man is some woman's
fool



I'm gonna ball tonight

We're gonna ball tonight

We're gonna ball tonight

We're gonna ball tonight

Well I can't break the rule because every man is some woman's
fool
