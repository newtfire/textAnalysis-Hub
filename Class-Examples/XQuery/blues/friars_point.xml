<lyrics>



Just past Friar's Point, all the way
across those lanes

Just past Friar's Point, all the way across those lanes

I was walking by the cotton fields, and I swear I heard Robert
Johnson play



Down in New Orleans, preaching in the Lion's Den

Down in New Orleans, preaching in the Lion's Den

You can hear Irma Thomas, take you right back to church again



We got the blues now, surely ain't got a thing to lose

Oh we got the blues, surely don't have a thing to lose

Oh darling it's them blues that really make them move



Oh do they hang on Beale Street, music blasting out of every door

Oh do they hang on Beale Street, music pouring out of every pore

Rocking the house at BB's, your feet they never touch the floor



Oh south side of Chicago, oh all the way where Magic Sam used to
play

Oh south side of Chicago, over at the Checkerboard Lounge

You can still hear Muddy Waters, playing that song "Slow Down"



Oh we got the blues time, sure don't have a thing to lose

Oh we got the blues time, surely don't have a thing to lose

And these are the people all ready to make a move
