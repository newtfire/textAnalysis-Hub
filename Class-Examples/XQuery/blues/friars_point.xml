<lyrics>


<l>Just past Friar's Point, all the way
across those lanes

</l>
<l>Just past Friar's Point, all the way across those lanes

</l>
<l>I was walking by the cotton fields, and I swear I heard Robert

Johnson play




</l>
<l>Down in New Orleans, preaching in the Lion's Den

</l>
<l>Down in New Orleans, preaching in the Lion's Den

</l>
<l>You can hear Irma Thomas, take you right back to church again



</l>
<l>We got the blues now, surely ain't got a thing to lose

</l>
<l>Oh we got the blues, surely don't have a thing to lose

</l>
<l>Oh darling it's them blues that really make them move



</l>
<l>Oh do they hang on Beale Street, music blasting out of every door

</l>
<l>Oh do they hang on Beale Street, music pouring out of every pore

</l>
<l>Rocking the house at BB's, your feet they never touch the floor



</l>
<l>Oh south side of Chicago, oh all the way where Magic Sam used to
play

</l>
<l>Oh south side of Chicago, over at the Checkerboard Lounge

</l>
<l>You can still hear Muddy Waters, playing that song "Slow Down"



</l>
<l>Oh we got the blues time, sure don't have a thing to lose

</l>
<l>Oh we got the blues time, surely don't have a thing to lose

</l>
<l>And these are the people all ready to make a move</l></lyrics></xml>
