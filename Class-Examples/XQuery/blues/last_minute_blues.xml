<l>Minutes seem like hours, hours seem like days

</l>
<l>Minutes seem like hours, hours seem like days

</l>
<l>It seems like my daddy won't stop his evil ways



</l>
<l>Seems like every minute's going to be my last

</l>
<l>Seems like every minute's going to be my last

</l>
<l>If I can't tell my future I won't tell my past



</l>
<l>The brook runs into the river, river runs into the sea

</l>
<l>The brook runs into the river, river runs into the sea

</l>
<l>If I don't run into my daddy, somebody ought to bury me



</l>
<l>If anybody asks you who wrote this lonesome song

</l>
<l>If anybody asks you who wrote this lonesome song

</l><l>Tell 'em you don't know the writer, but Ma Rainey put it on</l></lyrics></xml>
