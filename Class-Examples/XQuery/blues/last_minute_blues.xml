<lyrics>



Minutes seem like hours, hours seem like days

Minutes seem like hours, hours seem like days

It seems like my daddy won't stop his evil ways



Seems like every minute's going to be my last

Seems like every minute's going to be my last

If I can't tell my future I won't tell my past



The brook runs into the river, river runs into the sea

The brook runs into the river, river runs into the sea

If I don't run into my daddy, somebody ought to bury me



If anybody asks you who wrote this lonesome song

If anybody asks you who wrote this lonesome song

Tell 'em you don't know the writer, but Ma Rainey put it on
