<lyrics>



I'm worried in mind, stay worried all the time

Someday I'll be satisfied

It's your time now, but it's my time after a while

Oh say, if things don't get no better

I'm gonna move on down the line



'Cause when you was my baby

I treated you nice an' kind

But baby, I have changed my mind

I was crazy 'bout you, baby

Crazy as a man could be

So now when I leave ya now baby, don't try an' follow me



You gonna wake up one-a these mornin's, and it won't be long

And look for me an' I will be gone

So bye-bye baby, babe you know you've done me wrong

So try your best to forget, that I ever held you in my arms



Yes, yes, yes



You gonna worry 'bout me, one a-these old lonesome days

An' your daddy be far away

So long peoples an' sweetheart, I'll soon be on my way

You're goin' to be sorry, that you let me go 'round still
