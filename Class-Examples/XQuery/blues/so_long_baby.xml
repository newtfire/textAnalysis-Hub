<lyrics>


<l>I'm worried in mind, stay worried all the time

</l>
<l>Someday I'll be satisfied

</l>
<l>It's your time now, but it's my time after a while

</l>
<l>Oh say, if things don't get no better

</l>
<l>I'm gonna move on down the line



</l>
<l>'Cause when you was my baby

</l>
<l>I treated you nice an' kind

</l>
<l>But baby, I have changed my mind

</l>
<l>I was crazy 'bout you, baby

</l>
<l>Crazy as a man could be

</l>
<l>So now when I leave ya now baby, don't try an' follow me



</l>
<l>You gonna wake up one-a these mornin's, and it won't be long

</l>
<l>And look for me an' I will be gone

</l>
<l>So bye-bye baby, babe you know you've done me wrong

</l>
<l>So try your best to forget, that I ever held you in my arms



</l>
<l>Yes, yes, yes



</l>
<l>You gonna worry 'bout me, one a-these old lonesome days

</l>
<l>An' your daddy be far away

</l>
<l>So long peoples an' sweetheart, I'll soon be on my way

</l>
<l>You're goin' to be sorry, that you let me go 'round still



</l>
