<l>Now, here's my hand, babe

</l>
<l>Now, here's my hand, babe

</l>
<l>You can lead me where you want to

</l>
<l>You can lead me where you want, me to go

</l>
<l>Now, an if I don't make you happy

</l>
<l>You won't have to fool with me no mo'



</l>
<l>Now tell me baby

</l>
<l>Now tell me baby

</l>
<l>Baby, just what ya want me to,

</l>
<l>Baby, what you want me to do

</l>
<l>Now, I tried to be your little dog

</l>
<l>Just to try to get along with you



</l>
<l>I wanna talk to my brother, T.W.

</l>
<l>I won't have no trouble

</l>
<l>I want him to take me to schoolroom

</l>
<l>I wanna see some them little school girls

</l>
<l>Now, an when I get in back to Jackson

</l>
<l>I tell my mother, n' I say, I been all around the world



</l>
<l>I wanna see, Mr. Davis

</l>
<l>Wanna talk to, Mister Walter Davis

</l>
<l>I want him to do my a favor

</l>
<l>Make me 'quainted with some pretty little girl

</l>
<l>Now then, I want her to be real brown-skinned

</l>
<l>With her hair hangin' down in curls



</l>
<l>Now you can tell it to the eagle

</l>
<l>You can tell it to the eagle

</l>
<l>Let him take it out in the,

</l>
<l>Let him take it out in, the west

</l>
<l>We're goin' ta top a Smokey Mountain

</l>
<l>That's where the eagle builds his nest



</l>
<l>Now I'll see you baby, I'll see you baby

</l>
<l>When you're down and out just like my,

</l>
<l>When you're down just like myself

</l>
<l>Now, but I'll meet you some lonesome day

</l>
<l>And you won't be in love with nobody else</l></lyrics></xml>
