<lyrics>



Now, here's my hand, babe

Now, here's my hand, babe

You can lead me where you want to

You can lead me where you want, me to go

Now, an if I don't make you happy

You won't have to fool with me no mo'



Now tell me baby

Now tell me baby

Baby, just what ya want me to,

Baby, what you want me to do

Now, I tried to be your little dog

Just to try to get along with you



I wanna talk to my brother, T.W.

I won't have no trouble

I want him to take me to schoolroom

I wanna see some them little school girls

Now, an when I get in back to Jackson

I tell my mother, n' I say, I been all around the world



I wanna see, Mr. Davis

Wanna talk to, Mister Walter Davis

I want him to do my a favor

Make me 'quainted with some pretty little girl

Now then, I want her to be real brown-skinned

With her hair hangin' down in curls



Now you can tell it to the eagle

You can tell it to the eagle

Let him take it out in the,

Let him take it out in, the west

We're goin' ta top a Smokey Mountain

That's where the eagle builds his nest



Now I'll see you baby, I'll see you baby

When you're down and out just like my,

When you're down just like myself

Now, but I'll meet you some lonesome day

And you won't be in love with nobody else
