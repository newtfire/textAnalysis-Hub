<lyrics>


<l>I'm gonna call up some of my buddies,

</l>
<l>and a few of the ladies I know

</l>
<l>I'm gonna rent a hall and get them all and,

</l>
<l>put on a heck of a show



</l>
<l>Make sure we got a kitchen,

</l>
<l>with a oven and a stove

</l>
<l>We'll all get in there cookin',

</l>
<l>then we'll throw open all the doors



</l>
<l>Playin' with my friends,

</l>
<l>playin' with my friends,

</l>
<l>playin' with my friends

</l>
<l>We'll have a good time,

</l>
<l>playin' with my friends



</l>
<l>I'm gonna buy a 100 pounds of catfish,

</l>
<l>cook it all up on the grill

</l>
<l>Fix some beans and corn bread,

</l>
<l>everybody's gonna get their fill



</l>
<l>Then we'll grab all the guitars,

</l>
<l>greasy hands and all

</l>
<l>Someone'll count off a shuffle,

</l>
<l>and man we'll have a ball



</l>
<l>Playin' with my friends,

</l>
<l>playin' with my friends,

</l>
<l>playin' with my friends

</l>
<l>We'll have a good time,

</l>
<l>playin' with my friends



</l>
<l>Yes, we gonna buy some of that red, red wine,

</l>
<l>the best that money can buy

</l>
<l>You gotta drink it all from a paper cup,

</l>
<l>that this here Saturday life is right



</l>
<l>Everybody's gonna stand up,

</l>
<l>play their favorite tune

</l>
<l>You can pick any tune you want to,

</l>
<l>as long as it's the blues



</l>
<l>Playin' with my friends,

</l>
<l>playin' with my friends,

</l>
<l>playin' with my friends

</l>
<l>We'll have a good time,

</l>
<l>playin' with my friends</l></lyrics></xml>
