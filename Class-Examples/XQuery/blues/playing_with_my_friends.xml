<lyrics>



I'm gonna call up some of my buddies,

and a few of the ladies I know

I'm gonna rent a hall and get them all and,

put on a heck of a show



Make sure we got a kitchen,

with a oven and a stove

We'll all get in there cookin',

then we'll throw open all the doors



Playin' with my friends,

playin' with my friends,

playin' with my friends

We'll have a good time,

playin' with my friends



I'm gonna buy a 100 pounds of catfish,

cook it all up on the grill

Fix some beans and corn bread,

everybody's gonna get their fill



Then we'll grab all the guitars,

greasy hands and all

Someone'll count off a shuffle,

and man we'll have a ball



Playin' with my friends,

playin' with my friends,

playin' with my friends

We'll have a good time,

playin' with my friends



Yes, we gonna buy some of that red, red wine,

the best that money can buy

You gotta drink it all from a paper cup,

that this here Saturday life is right



Everybody's gonna stand up,

play their favorite tune

You can pick any tune you want to,

as long as it's the blues



Playin' with my friends,

playin' with my friends,

playin' with my friends

We'll have a good time,

playin' with my friends
