<lyrics>

<l>If you ever wake up with your good man on your mind

</l>
<l>If you ever wake up with your good man on your mind

</l>
<l>My daddy left me this morning, that's why I moan and cry



</l>
<l>He'll make you laugh, he'll make you cry, he'll drive those blues
away

</l>
<l>You'll sit right down and weep and moan and then you'll find he's
went

</l>
<l>Lord, I been wonderin' where my jelly bean
1
has gone </l>

<l>I can see you rider, yea, helle loo, a thousand miles away

</l>
<l>I just can't remember what my baby had to say

</l>
<l>He said: 
see see
rider
, today I'm goin' away, and I won't be back until you change
your way



</l>
<l>So back and easy rider, today that mean' goodbye

</l>
<l>You did not worry me, you had no right to lie



</l>
