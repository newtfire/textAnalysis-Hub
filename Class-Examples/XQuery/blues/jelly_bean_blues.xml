<lyrics>



If you ever wake up with your good man on your mind

If you ever wake up with your good man on your mind

My daddy left me this morning, that's why I moan and cry



He'll make you laugh, he'll make you cry, he'll drive those blues
away

You'll sit right down and weep and moan and then you'll find he's
went

Lord, I been wonderin' where my jelly bean
1
 has gone



I can see you rider, yea, helle loo, a thousand miles away

I just can't remember what my baby had to say

He said: 
see see
rider
, today I'm goin' away, and I won't be back until you change
your way



So back and easy rider, today that mean' goodbye

You did not worry me, you had no right to lie



__________

Note 1: jelly bean, term of endearment for a lover.
