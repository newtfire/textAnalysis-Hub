<l>Hush, ya'll hush, I heard little Anna Mae callin' my name

</l>
<l>Hush, ya'll hush, I heard little Anna Mae callin' my name

</l>
<l>Well, you know that girl kind-a lisp-tongued, she can't speak so

doggone plain




</l>
<l>Anna Mae, she's a good little girl, but, she loves to run around at
night

</l>
<l>Anna Mae, she's a good little girl, but, she loves to run around at
night

</l>
<l>Well, you know if I can get her mind on me, she'd be so fit to treat

me right.




</l>
<l>Bye-bye, Anna Mae, I hope we'll meet again someday

</l>
<l>Bye-bye, Anna Mae, I hope we'll meet again someday

</l>
<l>Well, now you won't be so doggone evil, baby, you better change your

low down ways

<note>Note: The song is about the breakup with his real-life lover Anna Mae
which Muddy attributes to her "running around at night" i.e. outside
love affairs. The song was cut at the first recording session of
Muddy Waters for the Aristocrat label, the forerunner of the famous
Chess label. It was cut together with one more song, "
Gypsy
Woman
", and released as that songs flip side in the spring of
1947. The record wasn't a big seller so Muddy couldn't quit his day
job yet, driving a truck for the Western Graves Company and
delivering venetian blinds. Muddy would have to wait until April 1948
before Aristocrat asked him to record again.</note></lyrics></xml>
