<lyrics>



I sure had a wonderful time last night

Least wise they tell me I did



I sure had a wonderful time last night

Really blew my lid



Went to a party, I recollect that much

But after four or five, you know I lost my touch

I sure had a wonderful time last night

Least wise they tell me I did



I had a whale of good time last night

Really got myself some kicks

I sure had a wonderful time last night

Took me right back to the sticks



Between that hillbilly band and old Uncle Zeke

And that new atomic beverage that they called "Sneaky Pete"



I sure had a wonderful time last night

Least wise they tell me I did



Sure had a wonderful time last night

Don't know how I got to bed



Sure had a wonderful time last night

Come here, feel this lump on my head



They say I got kinda noisy

And started to shout

Four big bouncers grabbed me

But I threw them out

I sure had a wonderful time last night

Least wise they tell me I did



Sure had a wonderful time last night

Really had myself some fun



Sure had a wonderful time last night

Didn't get home until about half past one



You know I'd like to take you with me the next time I go

But where the heck was it?

Sure would like to know

But I sure had a wonderful time last night
