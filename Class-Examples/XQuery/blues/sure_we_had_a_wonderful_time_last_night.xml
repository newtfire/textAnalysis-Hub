<lyrics>


<l>I sure had a wonderful time last night

</l>
<l>Least wise they tell me I did



</l>
<l>I sure had a wonderful time last night

</l>
<l>Really blew my lid



</l>
<l>Went to a party, I recollect that much

</l>
<l>But after four or five, you know I lost my touch

</l>
<l>I sure had a wonderful time last night

</l>
<l>Least wise they tell me I did



</l>
<l>I had a whale of good time last night

</l>
<l>Really got myself some kicks

</l>
<l>I sure had a wonderful time last night

</l>
<l>Took me right back to the sticks



</l>
<l>Between that hillbilly band and old Uncle Zeke

</l>
<l>And that new atomic beverage that they called "Sneaky Pete"



</l>
<l>I sure had a wonderful time last night

</l>
<l>Least wise they tell me I did



</l>
<l>Sure had a wonderful time last night

</l>
<l>Don't know how I got to bed



</l>
<l>Sure had a wonderful time last night

</l>
<l>Come here, feel this lump on my head



</l>
<l>They say I got kinda noisy

</l>
<l>And started to shout

</l>
<l>Four big bouncers grabbed me

</l>
<l>But I threw them out

</l>
<l>I sure had a wonderful time last night

</l>
<l>Least wise they tell me I did



</l>
<l>Sure had a wonderful time last night

</l>
<l>Really had myself some fun



</l>
<l>Sure had a wonderful time last night

</l>
<l>Didn't get home until about half past one



</l>
<l>You know I'd like to take you with me the next time I go

</l>
<l>But where the heck was it?

</l>
<l>Sure would like to know

</l>
<l>But I sure had a wonderful time last night</l></lyrics></xml>
