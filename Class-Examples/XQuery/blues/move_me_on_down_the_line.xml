<lyrics>


<l>When I hear that Santa Fe start blowin'

</l>
<l>I wonder where it's been and where it's goin'



</l>
<l>I tell you, boy, every time the feelin' sure is fine

</l>
<l>Just move me on down the line, just move me on down the line



</l>
<l>Then I heard red rooster start his crowin'

</l>
<l>around the curve that cloud of smoke was blowin'



</l>
<l>I tell you, boy, every time the feelin' sure is fine

</l>
<l>Just move me on down the line, just move me on down the line



</l>
<l>I'll be where the big wheels keep on turnin'

</l>
<l>and the diesel drivers keep them engines burnin'



</l>
<l>I tell you, boy, every time the feelin' sure is fine

</l>
<l>Just move me on down the line, just move me on down the line



</l>
<l>Move me on down the line, move me on down

</l>
<l>Move me on down the line, move me on down

</l>
<l>Move me on down the line, move me ...</l></lyrics></xml>
