<lyrics>



When I hear that Santa Fe start blowin'

I wonder where it's been and where it's goin'



I tell you, boy, every time the feelin' sure is fine

Just move me on down the line, just move me on down the line



Then I heard red rooster start his crowin'

around the curve that cloud of smoke was blowin'



I tell you, boy, every time the feelin' sure is fine

Just move me on down the line, just move me on down the line



I'll be where the big wheels keep on turnin'

and the diesel drivers keep them engines burnin'



I tell you, boy, every time the feelin' sure is fine

Just move me on down the line, just move me on down the line



Move me on down the line, move me on down

Move me on down the line, move me on down

Move me on down the line, move me ...
