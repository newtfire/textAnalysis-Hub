<lyrics>



I never seen such a real hard times before

I never seen such a real hard times before

The wolf keeps walkin' all 'round my door



They howl all night and they moan till the break of day

They howl all night and they moan till the break of day

They seem to know my good man's gone away



I can't go outside to my grocery store

I can't go outside to my grocery store

I ain't got no money and my credit don't go no more



Won't somebody please try and find my man for me

Won't you please try and find my man for me

Tell him I'm broke and hungry, lonely as I can be



If he didn't like my potatoes, why did he dig so deep

If he didn't like my potatoes, why did he dig so deep

In his mama's potato patch, five and ten times a week?
