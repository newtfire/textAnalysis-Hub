<lyrics>


<l>I never seen such a real hard times before

</l>
<l>I never seen such a real hard times before

</l>
<l>The wolf keeps walkin' all 'round my door



</l>
<l>They howl all night and they moan till the break of day

</l>
<l>They howl all night and they moan till the break of day

</l>
<l>They seem to know my good man's gone away



</l>
<l>I can't go outside to my grocery store

</l>
<l>I can't go outside to my grocery store

</l>
<l>I ain't got no money and my credit don't go no more



</l>
<l>Won't somebody please try and find my man for me

</l>
<l>Won't you please try and find my man for me

</l>
<l>Tell him I'm broke and hungry, lonely as I can be



</l>
<l>If he didn't like my potatoes, why did he dig so deep

</l>
<l>If he didn't like my potatoes, why did he dig so deep

</l>
<l>In his mama's potato patch, five and ten times a week?</l></lyrics></xml>
