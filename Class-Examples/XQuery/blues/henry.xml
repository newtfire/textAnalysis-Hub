<lyrics>




Remember if you can

When cotton was picked by hand

Down in Dixie

Under southern skies

Working from sun to sun

Remember if you will

Lightnin' from a whiskey still

Blues in the breeze

The sweet magnolia trees

A little church house up on the hill



(Chorus:)

I can hear the delta calling

From the light of a distant star

I can see my future

And I can feel my past

When Henry plays his steel guitar



Won't you take me back in time

Free me from this crime

Well I have no shame

And I have no blame

It's time for us to be moving on



I can hear the delta calling

From the light of a distant star

I can see my future

And I can feel my past

When Henry plays his steel guitar



(Chorus x2)



I can hear the delta calling

From the light of a distant star

I can see my future

And I can feel my past

When Henry plays his steel guitar
