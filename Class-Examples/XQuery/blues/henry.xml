<lyrics>


<l>Remember if you can

</l>
<l>When cotton was picked by hand

</l>
<l>Down in Dixie

</l>
<l>Under southern skies

</l>
<l>Working from sun to sun

</l>
<l>Remember if you will

</l>
<l>Lightnin' from a whiskey still

</l>
<l>Blues in the breeze

</l>
<l>The sweet magnolia trees

</l>
<l>A little church house up on the hill



</l>
<l>(Chorus:)

</l>
<l>I can hear the delta calling

</l>
<l>From the light of a distant star

</l>
<l>I can see my future

</l>
<l>And I can feel my past

</l>
<l>When Henry plays his steel guitar



</l>
<l>Won't you take me back in time

</l>
<l>Free me from this crime

</l>
<l>Well I have no shame

</l>
<l>And I have no blame

</l>
<l>It's time for us to be moving on



</l>
<l>I can hear the delta calling

</l>
<l>From the light of a distant star

</l>
<l>I can see my future

</l>
<l>And I can feel my past

</l>
<l>When Henry plays his steel guitar



</l>
<l>(Chorus x2)



</l>
<l>I can hear the delta calling

</l>
<l>From the light of a distant star

</l>
<l>I can see my future

</l>
<l>And I can feel my past

</l>
<l>When Henry plays his steel guitar</l></lyrics></xml>
