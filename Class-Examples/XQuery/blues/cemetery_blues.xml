<lyrics>


<l>Folks, I know a gal named Cemetery Lize, down in Tennessee

</l>
<l>She has got a pair of mean old graveyard eyes, full of misery

</l>
<l>Every night and day, you can hear her sing a blues away



</l>
<l>I'm going down to the cemetery 'cause the world is all wrong

</l>
<l>I'm going down to the cemetery 'cause the world is all wrong

</l>
<l>Down there with the spooks, to hear 'em sing my sorrow song



</l>
<l>Got a date to see a ghost by the name of Jones

</l>
<l>Got a date to see a ghost by the name of Jones

</l>
<l>Makes me feel happy to hear him rattle his bones



</l>
<l>He's one man I always know just where to find

</l>
<l>He's one man I always know just where to find

</l>
<l>When you want true lovin' go and get the cemetery kind



</l>
<l>He ain't no fine dresser, he don't wear nothing but a sack

</l>
<l>Yeah, he ain't no fine dresser, he don't wear nothing but a sack

</l><l>Everytime he kisses me that funny feeling creeps up my back</l></lyrics></xml>
