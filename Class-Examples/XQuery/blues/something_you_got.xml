Something you got, baby

You oughta know

Something you got, baby

I wanna tell it everywhere I go

Something you got, baby

Oh I wanna know

Something you got, baby

Keep me home every night

Something you got, baby

Hey, make everything all right

Something you got, baby

Oh you oughta know

I said my, my, oh, oh

My my, oh, oh

Make me work all day

Something you got, baby

Hey, make me love you in every way

That's me, honey

Oh that's 'cause I love you so

I know

Lord I wanna tell it everywhere I go

Talk about it! Tell'em all!

What is it, B.B.

It's me, honey, it's me! It's me!

Make me come home every night

You better come home every night, or

I ain't gonna like it



You bring home your money

(I'll give it all to you)

Bring home your honey

Oh I love it

Hey, my, my

Oh, I love you so

B.B.?

Yes, baby?

You know I love you

All right, Koko, talk to me

And I don't -

All right

Put nobody above you

You better not, baby. You know I'm a pretty big guy

Yeah, baby

Yeah, talk to me

Oh I like it, baby

I like it, too, baby. Can't have it no other way ...
