<lyrics>


<l>I ain't got no reason to livin', I can't find no cause to die

</l>
<l>Lord, I ain't got no reason for livin', you give me no cause to
die

</l>
<l>Lord, I ain't got no reasons for stay here, give me no cause to
try

</l>
<l>I got these blues, I gotta find me that middle road



</l>
<l>Well, I ain't got mother to love me, ain't got no father to care

</l>
<l>Lord, I ain't got mother to love me, ain't got no father to care

</l>
<l>Lord, I ain't got no reasons to go on, give me no cause to stay
here

</l>
<l>I got these blues, I gotta finally know why



</l>
<l>Well, I ain't got no reason for walkin', I guess I'm gonna fall or
standstill

</l>
<l>Lord, I ain't got no reason for walkin', guess I'm gonna fall or
standstill

</l>
<l>Lord I ain't got no reason for goin', give me no cause to stay
here

</l>
<l>I got these blues, Lord I gotta finally know why</l></lyrics></xml>
