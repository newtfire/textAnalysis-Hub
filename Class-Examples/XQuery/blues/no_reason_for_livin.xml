<lyrics>



I ain't got no reason to livin', I can't find no cause to die

Lord, I ain't got no reason for livin', you give me no cause to
die

Lord, I ain't got no reasons for stay here, give me no cause to
try

I got these blues, I gotta find me that middle road



Well, I ain't got mother to love me, ain't got no father to care

Lord, I ain't got mother to love me, ain't got no father to care

Lord, I ain't got no reasons to go on, give me no cause to stay
here

I got these blues, I gotta finally know why



Well, I ain't got no reason for walkin', I guess I'm gonna fall or
standstill

Lord, I ain't got no reason for walkin', guess I'm gonna fall or
standstill

Lord I ain't got no reason for goin', give me no cause to stay
here

I got these blues, Lord I gotta finally know why
