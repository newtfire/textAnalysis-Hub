<lyrics>



I'm flyin' to South Carolina, I've got to go there this time

I'm flyin' to South Carolina, I've got to go there this time

Woman and tell me, Texas, about to make me lose my mind



Long distance, long distance, would you please give me a credit
call

Long distance, long distance, would you give me please your credit
call

Walk up to my girl in South Carolina, who looks like her hands done
squalled
1



Just wanna ask my baby, what in the world is she been doin'

Wanna ask my baby, what in the world is she been doin'

Give your lovin' to another joker and its sure gonna be my ruin



Eh, long distance, I can't help but moan

Mmm mmm, I can't help but moan

My baby's voice sounds so sweet, almost wrecked the telephone



You don't know your love, you're wrapped deep so far from you

You don't know your love, your letter, I said she's so far from
you

You can get a long distance moan, and you don't care what you do



I think I hear the tele buzzin', get my darlin' off my mind

Oh you tele-parties, get my baby off my mind

This long distance moan about to worry me to death this time
