<lyrics>

<l>I'm flyin' to South Carolina, I've got to go there this time

</l>
<l>I'm flyin' to South Carolina, I've got to go there this time

</l>
<l>Woman and tell me, Texas, about to make me lose my mind



</l>
<l>Long distance, long distance, would you please give me a credit
call

</l>
<l>Long distance, long distance, would you give me please your credit
call

</l>
<l>Walk up to my girl in South Carolina, who looks like her hands done
squalled
1



</l>
<l>Just wanna ask my baby, what in the world is she been doin'

</l>
<l>Wanna ask my baby, what in the world is she been doin'

</l>
<l>Give your lovin' to another joker and its sure gonna be my ruin



</l>
<l>Eh, long distance, I can't help but moan

</l>
<l>Mmm mmm, I can't help but moan

</l>
<l>My baby's voice sounds so sweet, almost wrecked the telephone



</l>
<l>You don't know your love, you're wrapped deep so far from you

</l>
<l>You don't know your love, your letter, I said she's so far from
you

</l>
<l>You can get a long distance moan, and you don't care what you do



</l>
<l>I think I hear the tele buzzin', get my darlin' off my mind

</l>
<l>Oh you tele-parties, get my baby off my mind

</l>
<l>This long distance moan about to worry me to death this time
