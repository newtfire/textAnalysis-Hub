<lyrics>



Ah you babes talk about your Madison shoes

We got a thing we call the Madison blues

We do the Madison blues

We do the Madison blues

We do the Madison blues baby

Rock away your blues



I know a gal her name is Lindsey Lou

She told me she loved me but I know it ain't true

Put on your Madison shoes

Put on your Madison blue shoes

I got the Madison blues

Now put on your Madison blue shoes



Ah you cats talking about your Madison shoes

We do the thing we call the Madison blues

We do the Madison blues

We do the Madison blues

We do the Madison blues baby

Rock away your blues



Ah you babes talk about your Madison shoes

We got a thing we call the Madison blues

We do the Madison blues

We do the Madison blues

We do the Madison blues baby

Rock away your blues
