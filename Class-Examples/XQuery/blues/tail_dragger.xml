<lyrics>


<l>I'm a tail dragger

</l>
<l>I wipe out my tracks

</l>
<l>When I get what I want

</l>
<l>I don't come sneakin' back



</l>
<l>The mighty wolf

</l>
<l>Makin' a midnight creep

</l>
<l>The hunters

</l>
<l>They can't find him

</l>
<l>Stealin' chicks everywhere he go

</l>
<l>Then draggin' his tail behind



</l>
<l>I'm a tail dragger

</l>
<l>I wipe out my tracks

</l>
<l>When I get what I want

</l>
<l>Well I don't come sneakin' back



</l>
<l>The 'cuda drags

</l>
<l>His tail in the sand

</l>
<l>The fish wiggles

</l>
<l>His tail in the water

</l>
<l>When the mighty wolf come a long

</l>
<l>Draggin' his tail

</l>
<l>He done sole somebody's daughter



</l>
<l>I'm a tail dragger

</l>
<l>I wipe out my tracks

</l>
<l>When I get what I want

</l>
<l>Well I don't come sneakin' back</l></lyrics></xml>
