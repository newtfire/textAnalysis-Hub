<lyrics>



When I saw you this morning, baby, tell me why did you walk away

When I saw you this morning, baby, tell me why did you walk away

Can't believe that you don't love me, thought our love was here to
stay



Now buzz me, baby, I'll be waiting for your call

Buzz me, buzz me, buzz me, buzz me, baby, I'll be waiting for your
call

If you forgot the number, come on over, you won't have to call at
all



I never lied to no one, I ain't gonna lie to you

When I say I'm yours forever, every word I say is true

Buzz me, baby, I'll be waiting for your call

If you forgot the number, come on over, you won't have to call at
all



Yes, buzz me, baby, I'm like the ship that's lost at sea

Buzz me, buzz me, baby, you mean so much to me

If I ever get my arms around you, I ain't gonna let go till 1973
