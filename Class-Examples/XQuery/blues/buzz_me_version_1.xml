<lyrics>


<l>When I saw you this morning, baby, tell me why did you walk away

</l>
<l>When I saw you this morning, baby, tell me why did you walk away

</l>
<l>Can't believe that you don't love me, thought our love was here to

stay




</l>
<l>Now buzz me, baby, I'll be waiting for your call

</l>
<l>Buzz me, buzz me, buzz me, buzz me, baby, I'll be waiting for your
call

</l>
<l>If you forgot the number, come on over, you won't have to call at

all




</l>
<l>I never lied to no one, I ain't gonna lie to you

</l>
<l>When I say I'm yours forever, every word I say is true

</l>
<l>Buzz me, baby, I'll be waiting for your call

</l>
<l>If you forgot the number, come on over, you won't have to call at

all




</l>
<l>Yes, buzz me, baby, I'm like the ship that's lost at sea

</l>
<l>Buzz me, buzz me, baby, you mean so much to me

</l>
<l>If I ever get my arms around you, I ain't gonna let go till 1973</l></lyrics></xml>
