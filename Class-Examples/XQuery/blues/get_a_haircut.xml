<lyrics>


<l>I was a rebel from the day I left school,

</l>
<l>grew my hair long and broke all the rules

</l>
<l>I'd sit and listen to my records all day,

</l>
<l>with big ambitions of where I could play



</l>
<l>My parents taught me what life was about,

</l>
<l>so I grew up the type they warned me about

</l>
<l>They said my friends were just an unruly mob,

</l>
<l>and I should get a haircut and get a real job



</l>
<l>Get a haircut and get a real job,

</l>
<l>clean your act up and don't be a slob

</l>
<l>Get it together like your big brother bob,

</l>
<l>why don't you get a haircut and get a real job



</l>
<l>I even tried that 9 to 5 scene,

</l>
<l>I told myself that it was all a bad dream

</l>
<l>I found a band and some good songs to play,

</l>
<l>and now I party all night, I sleep all day



</l>
<l>I met this chick she was my No. 1 fan,

</l>
<l>she took me home to meet her mommy and dad

</l>
<l>They took one look at me and said, "Oh my god",

</l>
<l>get a haircut and get a real job



</l>
<l>Get a real job, why don't you get a real job

</l>
<l>Get a real job, why don't you get a real job



</l>
<l>I hit the big time with my rock 'n' roll band,

</l>
<l>the future's brighter now than I'd ever planned

</l>
<l>I'm ten times richer than my big brother bob,

</l>
<l>and he, he's got a haircut he's got a real job



</l>
<l>Why don't you get a haircut and get a real job



</l>
<l>I even tried that 9 to 5 scene</l></lyrics></xml>
