<lyrics>



I was a rebel from the day I left school,

grew my hair long and broke all the rules

I'd sit and listen to my records all day,

with big ambitions of where I could play



My parents taught me what life was about,

so I grew up the type they warned me about

They said my friends were just an unruly mob,

and I should get a haircut and get a real job



Get a haircut and get a real job,

clean your act up and don't be a slob

Get it together like your big brother bob,

why don't you get a haircut and get a real job



I even tried that 9 to 5 scene,

I told myself that it was all a bad dream

I found a band and some good songs to play,

and now I party all night, I sleep all day



I met this chick she was my No. 1 fan,

she took me home to meet her mommy and dad

They took one look at me and said, "Oh my god",

get a haircut and get a real job



Get a real job, why don't you get a real job

Get a real job, why don't you get a real job



I hit the big time with my rock 'n' roll band,

the future's brighter now than I'd ever planned

I'm ten times richer than my big brother bob,

and he, he's got a haircut he's got a real job



Why don't you get a haircut and get a real job



I even tried that 9 to 5 scene
