<lyrics>



I'm goin' down in Louisiana

Be, be, behind the sun

I'm goin' down in Louisiana

Honey, behind the sun

Well, you know I just found out



My troubles just begun

I'm goin' down in New Orleans, hmm

Get me a 
mojo hand

I'm goin' down in New Orleans

Get me a mojo hand



(spoken: oh take me with you, man, when you goin')

I'm 'on show all you goodlookin' women

Yes, how to treat your love

(spoken: let's go back to New Orleans)
