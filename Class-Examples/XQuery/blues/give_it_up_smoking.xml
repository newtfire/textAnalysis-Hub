<lyrics>



Lord, I smoke, smoke, smoke

Smoke two packs a day

Only thing it's doin' to me

Is fadin' my life away



That's why, I'm gonna do what I gotta do, oh yeah

Well, I done made up my mind

I'm gonna cut this smokin' or lose, oh yeah



Lord, I go out and have a drink

Go to the cigarette machine

I don't seem to help it

'Cause I'm addicted to the nicotine



That's why I gotta do what I gotta do, oh yeah

Well I done made up my mind

I'm gonna cut this smokin' or lose



Now I don't care what ya smoke

Now it could be cigarettes or it could be killer dope

Whatever it is now you better quit

Because it would take your life, bit by bit



Now don't hang in the streets

And run with the wrong gang

If you do your life can't be the same

You might think that's a good thing to do

But it they offer you drugs just say, "No thank you"



You might try it once

And if that's the way you feel

When you get that habit

You gotta rob and steal



So never think that is

The way to go

If they offer you drugs

Just please say "No"



I wanna tell all you children

You better shake this curse

Never use cocaine

'Cause it's just as bad or worse



That's why, you better do what you gotta do, oh yeah

Well then make up your mind

If you can touch that stuff or lose, oh yeah



Lord, you better give it up

(Give it on up)

Don't waste no time

(Give it on up)

You better listen to me now baby

(Give it on up)

'Cause you might be dyin'

(Give it on up)

Better give it on up

(Give it on up)

Just give it on up

(Give it on up)

Just make up your mind now

(Give it on up)

Darlin' don't use the stuff

(Give it on up)

Better give it on up

(Give it on up)

That's the way to go

(Give it on up)

If they offer you drugs, darlin'

(Give it on up)

Will you please say, "No"

(Give it on up)

Just give it on up

(Give it on up)

Just give it on up

(Give it on up)

Better give it on up



Fading:

(Give it on up)

Better give it on up

(Give it on up)

Better give it on up, darlin', darlin'

(Give it on up)

Don't use the stuff

(Give it on up)

Just give it on up

(Give it on up)
