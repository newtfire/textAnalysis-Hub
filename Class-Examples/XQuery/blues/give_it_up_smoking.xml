<l>Lord, I smoke, smoke, smoke

</l>
<l>Smoke two packs a day

</l>
<l>Only thing it's doin' to me

</l>
<l>Is fadin' my life away



</l>
<l>That's why, I'm gonna do what I gotta do, oh yeah

</l>
<l>Well, I done made up my mind

</l>
<l>I'm gonna cut this smokin' or lose, oh yeah



</l>
<l>Lord, I go out and have a drink

</l>
<l>Go to the cigarette machine

</l>
<l>I don't seem to help it

</l>
<l>'Cause I'm addicted to the nicotine



</l>
<l>That's why I gotta do what I gotta do, oh yeah

</l>
<l>Well I done made up my mind

</l>
<l>I'm gonna cut this smokin' or lose



</l>
<l>Now I don't care what ya smoke

</l>
<l>Now it could be cigarettes or it could be killer dope

</l>
<l>Whatever it is now you better quit

</l>
<l>Because it would take your life, bit by bit



</l>
<l>Now don't hang in the streets

</l>
<l>And run with the wrong gang

</l>
<l>If you do your life can't be the same

</l>
<l>You might think that's a good thing to do

</l>
<l>But it they offer you drugs just say, "No thank you"



</l>
<l>You might try it once

</l>
<l>And if that's the way you feel

</l>
<l>When you get that habit

</l>
<l>You gotta rob and steal



</l>
<l>So never think that is

</l>
<l>The way to go

</l>
<l>If they offer you drugs

</l>
<l>Just please say "No"



</l>
<l>I wanna tell all you children

</l>
<l>You better shake this curse

</l>
<l>Never use cocaine

</l>
<l>'Cause it's just as bad or worse



</l>
<l>That's why, you better do what you gotta do, oh yeah

</l>
<l>Well then make up your mind

</l>
<l>If you can touch that stuff or lose, oh yeah



</l>
<l>Lord, you better give it up

</l>
<l>(Give it on up)

</l>
<l>Don't waste no time

</l>
<l>(Give it on up)

</l>
<l>You better listen to me now baby

</l>
<l>(Give it on up)

</l>
<l>'Cause you might be dyin'

</l>
<l>(Give it on up)

</l>
<l>Better give it on up

</l>
<l>(Give it on up)

</l>
<l>Just give it on up

</l>

</l>
<l>(Give it on up)

</l>

</l>
<l>(Give it on up)

</l>
<l>Better give it on up

</l>
<l>(Give it on up)

</l>
<l>That's the way to go

</l>
<l>(Give it on up)

</l>
