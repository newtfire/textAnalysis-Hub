<lyrics>


<l>Got a tale to tell

</l>
<l>Gonna carry it to the world

</l>
<l>'Bout I came and I saw, yeah

</l>
<l>Trees was dyin', chillun cryin', yeah

</l>
<l>Fish was floatin', famine risin'



</l>
<l>Father, son

</l>
<l>On the run

</l>
<l>Chillun' stole from their mothers

</l>
<l>World o' pain, some insane

</l>
<l>Make a mule out of others



</l>
<l>Watch your mouth

</l>
<l>Don't you shout

</l>
<l>Even talk without knowin'

</l>
<l>Future man, he understand

</l>
<l>Where I been an' where I'm goin'



</l>
<l>Got a tale to tell

</l>
<l>Gonna carry it to the world

</l>
<l>'Bout I came an' I saw</l></lyrics></xml>
