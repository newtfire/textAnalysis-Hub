<lyrics>



Got a tale to tell

Gonna carry it to the world

'Bout I came and I saw, yeah

Trees was dyin', chillun cryin', yeah

Fish was floatin', famine risin'



Father, son

On the run

Chillun' stole from their mothers

World o' pain, some insane

Make a mule out of others



Watch your mouth

Don't you shout

Even talk without knowin'

Future man, he understand

Where I been an' where I'm goin'



Got a tale to tell

Gonna carry it to the world

'Bout I came an' I saw
