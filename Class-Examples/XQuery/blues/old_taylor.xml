<lyrics>



Now I love to sing that good Old Taylor blues

(Ba-da-da-da, ba-da-da-da)



I love to sing that good Old Taylor blues

(Ba-da-da-da, ba-da-da-da)



When we want a little drink

I swear we just can't lose

(Ba-da-da, ba-da-da, ba-da-da)



Now you see, Mr. Melrose, standin' in the floor

(Ba-da-da, da-da-da-da)

Oh, I see that man that's standin' in the floor

(Ba-da-da-da, ta-ba-da-da-da)

He gonna give us a little drink

Now, just before he goes

(Ba-da-da, ba-da-da, ba-da-da)



[sung together]



Now we want Old Taylor, Lord

We want, Old Taylor now

We want, Old Taylor now

We want, Old Taylor now

We want, Old Taylor

Bring it on, bring it on, bring it on



Now, you'll say what's fine an' mellow

You'll say what's fine an' mellow

Oh, you'll say what's fine an' mellow

You'll say, what's fine an' mellow

Now, you'll say what's fine an' mellow

Bring it on, bring it on, bring it on



You'll say, was twenty years old

You'll say, was twenty years old

Now you'll say, was twenty years old

You'll say, was twenty years old

Now, you'll say was twenty years old

Bring it on, bring it on, bring it on



Now, is he poppin'?

(Yeah, man)

Now, is he poppin'?

(Yeah, man)

I believe he's poppin'

(Yeah, man)

I believe he's poppin'

(Yeah, man)

I believe he's poppin'

(Yeah, man)

Pop on, pop on, pop on
