<lyrics>


<l>I love my baby, she's so mean to me

</l>
<l>Yes I love my baby, she's so mean to me

</l>
<l>I'm gonna change my way of living baby, move across the deep blue

sea




</l>
<l>You know you didn't want me baby, when you climbed up on my
knee

</l>
<l>You were drinkin' 
moonshine

</l>
<l>whiskey mama, tryin' to 
jive

</l>
<l>poor me

</l>
<l>Yes I love you, yes I love you, yes I love, and I don't care what you

do




</l>
<l>Brownskin woman, who might you're good man be

</l>
<l>Brownskin woman, who might you're good man be

</l>
<l>Say the reason why I ask you baby, you sure look good to me</l></lyrics></xml>
