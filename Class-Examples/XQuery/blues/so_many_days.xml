<lyrics>



So many days, I'd rather steal away and die

So many days, I'd rather steal away and die

I was too blue to live and to mean to die



You've been so mean baby, you've been so mean to me

Baby, you've been so mean, you've been so mean to me

I've got to get even with you woman, you just hang around and see



Baby you ain't no good, you ain't no good no how

Baby you ain't no good, you ain't no good no how

Yes, the way I used to love you woman, baby that's the way I hate you
now



Yes, you can pack your clothes baby, you can pack your clothes and
go

Pack your clothes, woman, you can pack your clothes and go

I want you to know baby, you ain't no better than the little girl I
had before
