<lyrics>


<l>So many days, I'd rather steal away and die

</l>
<l>So many days, I'd rather steal away and die

</l>
<l>I was too blue to live and to mean to die



</l>
<l>You've been so mean baby, you've been so mean to me

</l>
<l>Baby, you've been so mean, you've been so mean to me

</l>
<l>I've got to get even with you woman, you just hang around and see



</l>
<l>Baby you ain't no good, you ain't no good no how

</l>
<l>Baby you ain't no good, you ain't no good no how

</l>
<l>Yes, the way I used to love you woman, baby that's the way I hate you

now




</l>
<l>Yes, you can pack your clothes baby, you can pack your clothes and
go

</l>
<l>Pack your clothes, woman, you can pack your clothes and go

</l><l>I want you to know baby, you ain't no better than the little girl I</l>
<l>had before</l></lyrics></xml>
