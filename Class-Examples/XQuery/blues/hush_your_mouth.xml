<lyrics>



Oh (hush your mouth!)

Oh (hush your mouth!)



Hey little baby don't you cry,

mama gonna drop around

Hey little baby don't say a word,

mama gonna whoop you 'bout somethin' you heard



Oh (hush your mouth!)

Oh (hush your mouth!)



Mama gonna buy you a diamond ring,

if that diamond ring's brass,

mama gonna buy a lookin' glass

If that lookin' glass is broke,

mama gonna buy a horse and coach

If that horse and coach turn over,

mama gonna buy you a dog named Rover



Oh (hush your mouth!)

Oh (hush your mouth!)

Oh (hush your mouth!)

Oh (Hush your mouth!)



A coonskin alligator hide,

make into shoes baby, jus' like mine

Don't be scared to put 'em on your feet,

scared 'bout me, jus' can't be beat



Hush your mouth!

Hush your mouth!
