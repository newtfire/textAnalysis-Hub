<lyrics>



Woke up this morning,

after another one of those crazy dreams

Oh, nothing is going right this morning,

the whole world is wrong it seems

Oh, I guess it's the chain that bind me

I can't shake it loose these chains and things



Got to work this morning,

seems like everything is lost

I got a cold hearted wrong doing woman,

and a slave driving ball

I can't loosen these chains that bind me,

can't shake them loosen these chains and things

Just can't loosen these chains and things



Well you talk about hard luck and trouble,

seems to be my middle name

All the odds are against me,

yes, I can only play a losing game

These chains that bind me,

can't loosen these chains and things

Just can't loosen these chains and things



Oh, I would pack up and leave today people,

but I ain't got nowhere to go

Ain't got money to buy a ticket,

and I don't feel like walking anymore

These chains that bind me

I can't lose, I can't lose these chains and things
