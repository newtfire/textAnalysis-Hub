<lyrics>


<l>Woke up this morning,

</l>
<l>after another one of those crazy dreams

</l>
<l>Oh, nothing is going right this morning,

</l>
<l>the whole world is wrong it seems

</l>
<l>Oh, I guess it's the chain that bind me

</l>
<l>I can't shake it loose these chains and things



</l>
<l>Got to work this morning,

</l>
<l>seems like everything is lost

</l>
<l>I got a cold hearted wrong doing woman,

</l>
<l>and a slave driving ball

</l>
<l>I can't loosen these chains that bind me,

</l>
<l>can't shake them loosen these chains and things

</l>
<l>Just can't loosen these chains and things



</l>
<l>Well you talk about hard luck and trouble,

</l>
<l>seems to be my middle name

</l>
<l>All the odds are against me,

</l>
<l>yes, I can only play a losing game

</l>
<l>These chains that bind me,

</l>
<l>can't loosen these chains and things

</l>
<l>Just can't loosen these chains and things



</l>
<l>Oh, I would pack up and leave today people,

</l>
<l>but I ain't got nowhere to go

</l>
<l>Ain't got money to buy a ticket,

</l>
<l>and I don't feel like walking anymore

</l>
<l>These chains that bind me

</l>
<l>I can't lose, I can't lose these chains and things</l></lyrics></xml>
