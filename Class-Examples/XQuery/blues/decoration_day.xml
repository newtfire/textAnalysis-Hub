<lyrics>



Lord, I've got a woman, she's nice lovin' in ev'ryway

Lord, I've got a woman, she's nice lovin' in ev'ryway

You know she done died an left me, I had a blues on every decoration
day



So sorry to see you to leave me, I hate to see my baby get away

So sorry to see you leave me, I hate to see my baby get away

I want ya to bring me some flowers, about ev'ry decoration day



Lord, I was walkin' 'round her bedside, these was the last the words
my baby had to say

Lord, walkin' 'round the bedside, these was the last words my baby
had to say

She said, "Bring me some flowers, be sure, honey on ev'ry decoration
day"
