<l>Lord, I've got a woman, she's nice lovin' in ev'ryway

</l>
<l>Lord, I've got a woman, she's nice lovin' in ev'ryway

</l>
<l>You know she done died an left me, I had a blues on every decoration

day




</l>
<l>So sorry to see you to leave me, I hate to see my baby get away

</l>
<l>So sorry to see you leave me, I hate to see my baby get away

</l>
<l>I want ya to bring me some flowers, about ev'ry decoration day



</l>
<l>Lord, I was walkin' 'round her bedside, these was the last the words
my baby had to say

</l>
<l>Lord, walkin' 'round the bedside, these was the last words my baby
had to say

</l><l>She said, "Bring me some flowers, be sure, honey on ev'ry decoration</l>
<l>day"</l></lyrics></xml>
