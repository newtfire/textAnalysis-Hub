<lyrics>


<l>I dreamt I had a good job

</l>
<l>And I got well paid

</l>
<l>I blew it all at the penny arcade



</l>
<l>I earned the dollars

</l>
<l>On the Cupid doll

</l>
<l>No pretty chic is gonna make me crawl



</l>
<l>We're on a TWA to the promised land

</l>
<l>Every woman, child and man

</l>
<l>It's a Cadillac and a great big diamond ring

</l>
<l>Don't you know you're ridin' with King



</l>
<l>He's on a mission of mercy on a new frontier

</l>
<l>He's gonna check us all out of here

</l>
<l>Up to the mansion on the hill

</l>
<l>Where you can get your booze, strips and pills

</l>
<l>Any kind of pills, folks



</l>
<l>We're on a TWA to the promised land

</l>
<l>Everybody clap your hands

</l>
<l>Don't you girls love the way that he sings

</l>
<l>Don't you know you're ridin' with King

</l>
<l>Ridin' with the King

</l>
<l>Don't you know you're ridin' with King



</l>
<l>...steel and a shining blue...

</l>
<l>(that's me)

</l>
<l>You can see it in his face

</l>
<l>The brute and the lies

</l>
<l>Tonight everybody's getting their angel wings

</l>
<l>Don't you know you're ridin' with King



</l>
<l>I stepped out of Mississippi when I was ten years old

</l>
<l>With a suit cut sharp as a razor and a hot tomato road

</l>
<l>I had a guitar hanging just about waist high

</l>
<l>And I'm gonna play this thing until the day I die



</l>
<l>Don't you know we're ridin' with King

</l>
<l>Don't you know we're ridin' with King

</l>
<l>You're ridin' with me Eric, you're in good hands

</l>
<l>You're ridin' with the blues

</l>
<l>Don't you know you're ridin' with King

</l>
<l>Yes yes you're ridin' with the King

</l>
<l>I wanted to say B.B. King but you know King

</l>
<l>Don't you know you're ridin' with King

</l>
<l>Yes you're ridin' with King</l></lyrics></xml>
