<lyrics>



I dreamt I had a good job

And I got well paid

I blew it all at the penny arcade



I earned the dollars

On the Cupid doll

No pretty chic is gonna make me crawl



We're on a TWA to the promised land

Every woman, child and man

It's a Cadillac and a great big diamond ring

Don't you know you're ridin' with King



He's on a mission of mercy on a new frontier

He's gonna check us all out of here

Up to the mansion on the hill

Where you can get your booze, strips and pills

Any kind of pills, folks



We're on a TWA to the promised land

Everybody clap your hands

Don't you girls love the way that he sings

Don't you know you're ridin' with King

Ridin' with the King

Don't you know you're ridin' with King



...steel and a shining blue...

(that's me)

You can see it in his face

The brute and the lies

Tonight everybody's getting their angel wings

Don't you know you're ridin' with King



I stepped out of Mississippi when I was ten years old

With a suit cut sharp as a razor and a hot tomato road

I had a guitar hanging just about waist high

And I'm gonna play this thing until the day I die



Don't you know we're ridin' with King

Don't you know we're ridin' with King

You're ridin' with me Eric, you're in good hands

You're ridin' with the blues

Don't you know you're ridin' with King

Yes yes you're ridin' with the King

I wanted to say B.B. King but you know King

Don't you know you're ridin' with King

Yes you're ridin' with King
