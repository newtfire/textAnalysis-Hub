<l>Babe why are you seeing all those other men,

I can't go on much longer
The way our love has been,
babe I think you've got,
yourself into a big mess


</l>
<l>But when it comes to lovin' babe,
I love you the best

</l>
<l>Babe you know our love has been as dark as the night
Come on help me bring our lovin' back into the light
Honey I ask for more, but all you ever give me is less

</l>
<l>When it comes to love,
I love you the best

</l>
<l>Baby why you always cheatin' on me,

'cause you know that ain't the way it should be
Get your act together baby won't you please,
honey why you always tramplin' on me, yeah


</l>
<l>Girl you know our love has been as dark as the night

Come on help me bring our lovin' back into the light
Baby I ask for more but,
