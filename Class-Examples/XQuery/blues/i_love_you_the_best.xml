<lyrics>





Babe why are you seeing all those other men,
I can't go on much longer
The way our love has been,
babe I think you've got,
yourself into a big mess

But when it comes to lovin' babe,
I love you the best

Babe you know our love has been as dark as the night
Come on help me bring our lovin' back into the light
Honey I ask for more, but all you ever give me is less

When it comes to love,
I love you the best

Baby why you always cheatin' on me,
'cause you know that ain't the way it should be
Get your act together baby won't you please,
honey why you always tramplin' on me, yeah

Girl you know our love has been as dark as the night
Come on help me bring our lovin' back into the light
Baby I ask for more but,
all you ever gimme is less

When it comes to love,
I love you the best

Baby why you always cheatin' on me 'cause you ,
know that ain't the way it should be
Get your act together babe won't you please,
honey why are you always tramplin' on me, yeah
