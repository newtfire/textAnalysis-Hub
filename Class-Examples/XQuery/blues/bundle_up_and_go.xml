<lyrics>



Well, a nickel is a nickel, dime is a dime,

house full-a chillun and now one's mine

I gotta bundle up and go I gotta bundle up and go

Well, you high pile o' women sho gotta bundle up and go



Doodoo, doodoo doodop bah

Doodoo, doodoo doodop dah

Doodoo, doodoo doodop dah



May be old, may be grey, you ain't too old just to shift them
gears,

You gotta bundle up and go

You gotta bundle up and go

You gotta bundle up and go

Sho' gotta bundle up and go

Yeah!



Well, mama killed a chicken,

thought it was a duck

Put him on the table with his legs stickin' up

You gotta bundle up and go, yeah

You gotta bundle up and go

Well, ya high pile o' women

Sho' gotta bundle up and go



Well, mama tol' papa, night afor' las',

"Look-a here, papa, you ain't doin' me right"

I gotta bundle up and go

I gotta bundle up and go

Well, you high pile o' women

Sho' gotta bundle up and go



Doodoo, doodoo doodop bah

Doodoo, doodoo doodop dah

Doodoo, doodoo doodop dah
