<lyrics>



Met a lot women who could love alright

But nothing like the woman I met this night

She's dynamite, she's dynamite

She knows what to do and she knows what it's all about



Now men don't blame me because I've been around

I don't understand what's she's putting down

She's dynamite, she's dynamite

She knows what to do and she knows what it's all about



Now she don't drink liquor and very little gin

But she'll show you how, you just tell her when

She's dynamite, she's dynamite

She knows what to do and she knows what it's all about



She's got a peal handled pistol a knife and a razor too

You can't ever tell her, she'll always tell you

She's dynamite, she's dynamite

She knows what to do and she knows what it's all about



Now you can whip it, whop it or hang it on the wall

Or throw it out the window, she'll pitch herself a ball

She's dynamite, yeah, she's dynamite

She knows what to do and she knows what it's all about
