<l>Met a lot women who could love alright

</l>
<l>But nothing like the woman I met this night

</l>
<l>She's dynamite, she's dynamite

</l>
<l>She knows what to do and she knows what it's all about



</l>
<l>Now men don't blame me because I've been around

</l>
<l>I don't understand what's she's putting down

</l>
<l>She's dynamite, she's dynamite

</l>
<l>She knows what to do and she knows what it's all about



</l>
<l>Now she don't drink liquor and very little gin

</l>
<l>But she'll show you how, you just tell her when

</l>
<l>She's dynamite, she's dynamite

</l>
<l>She knows what to do and she knows what it's all about



</l>
<l>She's got a peal handled pistol a knife and a razor too

</l>
<l>You can't ever tell her, she'll always tell you

</l>
<l>She's dynamite, she's dynamite

</l>
<l>She knows what to do and she knows what it's all about



</l>
<l>Now you can whip it, whop it or hang it on the wall

</l>
<l>Or throw it out the window, she'll pitch herself a ball

</l>
<l>She's dynamite, yeah, she's dynamite

</l>
<l>She knows what to do and she knows what it's all about</l></lyrics></xml>
