<lyrics>



Wait a minute baby

Don't leave just yet

I can explain baby

But it looks like the more I talk

The madder you get

It's not what you think it is

Trust me, I wouldn't do you no harm

She means nothing to me

The whole time I was imagining

It was you in my arms

You in my arms



(Chorus:)

I was wrong

And I admit it

My explanations

Don't seem to get it

I was wrong

And my heart can't take it

If you leave me now

I'm not gonna make it

I'm not gonna make it-no



What about the good times baby

What about all the fun we had together

It meant a lot to me baby

It must have meant something to you

Well ok, I see your point

But baby please

Don't let a little thing like this come between us

Cause our love is bigger than this

It's more than this

It's bigger than the universe

It's bigger than life



(Chorus x2)
