<lyrics>


<l>Wait a minute baby

</l>
<l>Don't leave just yet

</l>
<l>I can explain baby

</l>
<l>But it looks like the more I talk

</l>
<l>The madder you get

</l>
<l>It's not what you think it is

</l>
<l>Trust me, I wouldn't do you no harm

</l>
<l>She means nothing to me

</l>
<l>The whole time I was imagining

</l>
<l>It was you in my arms

</l>
<l>You in my arms



</l>
<l>(Chorus:)

</l>
<l>I was wrong

</l>
<l>And I admit it

</l>
<l>My explanations

</l>
<l>Don't seem to get it

</l>
<l>I was wrong

</l>
<l>And my heart can't take it

</l>
<l>If you leave me now

</l>
<l>I'm not gonna make it

</l>
<l>I'm not gonna make it-no



</l>
<l>What about the good times baby

</l>
<l>What about all the fun we had together

</l>
<l>It meant a lot to me baby

</l>
<l>It must have meant something to you

</l>
<l>Well ok, I see your point

</l>
<l>But baby please

</l>
<l>Don't let a little thing like this come between us

</l>
<l>Cause our love is bigger than this

</l>
<l>It's more than this

</l>
<l>It's bigger than the universe

</l>
<l>It's bigger than life



</l>
<l>(Chorus x2)</l></lyrics></xml>
