(Boy, this one here pulls the juice out of you)



At the end of my rainbow

I seek no golden prize

For the key to my kingdom

Is the glow in your eyes



Gain and power and riches

Are thrills I'll never miss

For the key to my kingdom

Is the thrill of your kiss



Baby, I have more

Than fame and fortune

Every time I hold your hand

And my darling

When our lips meet

All the world's at my command



Yeah, if you ever

Ever should leave me

My world would tumble down

Because you're the key to my kingdom

And your love is my crown



Oh I have more than fame and fortune

Every time I hold your hand

And my darling

When our lips meet

All the world's at my command



Yes, yes, if you ever

Ever should leave me

All of my world would tumble down

For you're the key to my kingdom

And your love is my crown

Yeah, you're the key to my kingdom

And your love is my crown

Yeah, you're the key to my kingdom

And your love, your love is my crown
