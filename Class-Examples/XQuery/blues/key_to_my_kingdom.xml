<lyrics>


<l>(Boy, this one here pulls the juice out of you)



</l>
<l>At the end of my rainbow

</l>
<l>I seek no golden prize

</l>
<l>For the key to my kingdom

</l>
<l>Is the glow in your eyes



</l>
<l>Gain and power and riches

</l>
<l>Are thrills I'll never miss

</l>
<l>For the key to my kingdom

</l>
<l>Is the thrill of your kiss



</l>
<l>Baby, I have more

</l>
<l>Than fame and fortune

</l>
<l>Every time I hold your hand

</l>
<l>And my darling

</l>
<l>When our lips meet

</l>
<l>All the world's at my command



</l>
<l>Yeah, if you ever

</l>
<l>Ever should leave me

</l>
<l>My world would tumble down

</l>
<l>Because you're the key to my kingdom

</l>
<l>And your love is my crown



</l>
<l>Oh I have more than fame and fortune

</l>
<l>Every time I hold your hand

</l>
<l>And my darling

</l>
<l>When our lips meet

</l>
<l>All the world's at my command



</l>
<l>Yes, yes, if you ever

</l>
<l>Ever should leave me

</l>
<l>All of my world would tumble down

</l>
<l>For you're the key to my kingdom

</l>
<l>And your love is my crown

</l>
<l>Yeah, you're the key to my kingdom

</l>
<l>And your love is my crown

</l>
<l>Yeah, you're the key to my kingdom

</l>
<l>And your love, your love is my crown</l></lyrics></xml>
