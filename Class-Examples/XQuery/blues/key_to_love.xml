<lyrics>


<l>I never realized that you were in pain

</l>
<l>I wanna help you honey, let me see you again

</l>
<l>Hurts my soul, babe, when I find you feeling rough

</l>
<l>Life is so bad, baby, when I find the key to love



</l>
<l>Put a smile on your face and dry away your tears

</l>
<l>Life is bound to get better as you live your years

</l>
<l>Hurts my soul, babe, when I find you feeling rough

</l>
<l>Life is so bad, baby, when I find the key to love



</l>
<l>Somewhere in this world, the one you waited for

</l>
<l>Come along and find you, turn the key your door

</l>
<l>Hurts my soul, babe, when I find you feeling rough

</l>
<l>Life is so bad, baby, when you find the key to love</l></lyrics></xml>
