<lyrics>



I never realized that you were in pain

I wanna help you honey, let me see you again

Hurts my soul, babe, when I find you feeling rough

Life is so bad, baby, when I find the key to love



Put a smile on your face and dry away your tears

Life is bound to get better as you live your years

Hurts my soul, babe, when I find you feeling rough

Life is so bad, baby, when I find the key to love



Somewhere in this world, the one you waited for

Come along and find you, turn the key your door

Hurts my soul, babe, when I find you feeling rough

Life is so bad, baby, when you find the key to love
