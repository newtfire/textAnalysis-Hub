<l>If you ever been mistreated, then you know just what I'm
talkin' about

</l>
<l>If you ever been mistreated, then you know just what I'm talkin'
about

</l>
<l>I worked five long years for one woman, and she had the nerve to put

me out




</l>
<l>I got a job at a steel mill, truckin' steel like a slave

</l>
<l>I got a job at a steel mill, truckin' steel like a slave

</l>
<l>For five long years every Friday, I went straight home with all of my

pay




</l>
<l>If you ever been mistreated, you know just what I'm talkin' about

</l>
<l>If you ever been mistreated, you know just what I'm talkin' about

</l><l>I worked five long years for a woman, and she had the nerve to put me</l>
