<lyrics>



Love me tender, love me sweet, never let me go

You have made my life complete and I love you so

Love me tender, love me true, all my dreams fulfill

For, my darlin', I love you and I always will



Love me tender, love me long, take me to your heart

For it's there that I belong and we'll never part

Love me tender, love me true, all my dreams fulfill

For, my darlin', I love you and I always will



Love me tender, love me dear
