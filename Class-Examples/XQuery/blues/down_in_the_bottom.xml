<lyrics>


<l>Well now, baby meet me in the bottom, bring me my running
shoes

</l>
<l>Well now, baby meet me in the bottom, bring me my running shoes

</l>
<l>Well, I'll come out the window, I won't have time to lose.



</l>
<l>When you see me streaking by, please don't be late

</l>
<l>When you see me streaking by, please don't be late

</l>
<l>Well, when you see me moving, though my life is at stake



</l>
<l>Well, I hope you'll see me, when I come streaking by

</l>
<l>Well, I hope you'll see me, when I come streaking by

</l>
<l>She got a bad old man, you know I'm too young to die



</l>
<l>I got to leave here. Get caught in there</l></lyrics></xml>
