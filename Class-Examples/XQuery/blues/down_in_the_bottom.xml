<lyrics>



Well now, baby meet me in the bottom, bring me my running
shoes

Well now, baby meet me in the bottom, bring me my running shoes

Well, I'll come out the window, I won't have time to lose.



When you see me streaking by, please don't be late

When you see me streaking by, please don't be late

Well, when you see me moving, though my life is at stake



Well, I hope you'll see me, when I come streaking by

Well, I hope you'll see me, when I come streaking by

She got a bad old man, you know I'm too young to die



I got to leave here. Get caught in there
