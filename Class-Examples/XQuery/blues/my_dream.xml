<lyrics>


<l>Dreamin', of the day, in the past

</l>
<l>I had a dream, last night

</l>
<l>Dream, of you, in the past, me and you

</l>
<l>I dream, we're back together again

</l>
<l>Me and you, me and you, in the past



</l>
<l>My dream. my dream

</l>
<l>I wished, I wished,

</l>
<l>it was true, was true

</l>
<l>My dream, dream, of you

</l>
<l>In the past, were back together, again

</l>
<l>Had a dream, had a dream,

</l>
<l>'bout me, an' me an' you, me an' you,

</l>
<l>together, again



</l>
<l>When I opened my eyes,

</l>
<l>and looked over in my bed

</l>
<l>Ha, ha, you, you was not there

</l>
<l>You were only a dream, in the past, in the past

</l>
<l>Woo

</l>
<l>Dream a dream, in the past

</l>
<l>I had a dream

</l>
<l>We were together, again

</l>
<l>Hmmm</l></lyrics></xml>
