<lyrics>



Dreamin', of the day, in the past

I had a dream, last night

Dream, of you, in the past, me and you

I dream, we're back together again

Me and you, me and you, in the past



My dream. my dream

I wished, I wished,

it was true, was true

My dream, dream, of you

In the past, were back together, again

Had a dream, had a dream,

'bout me, an' me an' you, me an' you,

together, again



When I opened my eyes,

and looked over in my bed

Ha, ha, you, you was not there

You were only a dream, in the past, in the past

Woo

Dream a dream, in the past

I had a dream

We were together, again

Hmmm
