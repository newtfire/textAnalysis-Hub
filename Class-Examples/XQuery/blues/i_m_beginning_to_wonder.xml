<lyrics>



I'm beginnin' to wonder, baby, what's goin' on when I'm not at
home

I'm beginnin' to wonder, baby, I know you ain't there all alone

Ev'ry time I have to leave you, woman, I wonder who's takin' my
place, an' turnin' you on



I'm beginnin' to wonder, woman, why I worry ev'ryday

I said, I'm beginnin' to wonder, woman, wonder why I feel this
way

I be home early Tuesday evenin', better hide your part-time man
away



I'm beginnin' to wonder, woman, why we're wasting all this time

I'm beginnin' to wonder, baby, wonder why we didn't see the signs

What we did, we've never forgotten, what we had, we left behind
