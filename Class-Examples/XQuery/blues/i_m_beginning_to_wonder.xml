<lyrics>


<l>I'm beginnin' to wonder, baby, what's goin' on when I'm not at
home

</l>
<l>I'm beginnin' to wonder, baby, I know you ain't there all alone

</l>
<l>Ev'ry time I have to leave you, woman, I wonder who's takin' my

place, an' turnin' you on




</l>
<l>I'm beginnin' to wonder, woman, why I worry ev'ryday

</l>
<l>I said, I'm beginnin' to wonder, woman, wonder why I feel this
way

</l>
<l>I be home early Tuesday evenin', better hide your part-time man

away




</l>
<l>I'm beginnin' to wonder, woman, why we're wasting all this time

</l>
<l>I'm beginnin' to wonder, baby, wonder why we didn't see the signs

</l>
<l>What we did, we've never forgotten, what we had, we left behind</l></lyrics></xml>
