<lyrics>


<l>I play the street life

</l>
<l>Because there's no place I can go

</l>
<l>Street life

</l>
<l>And it's the only life I know

</l>
<l>Street life

</l>
<l>And there's a thousand parts to play

</l>
<l>Street life

</l>
<l>Until you play your life away



</l>
<l>You let the people see

</l>
<l>Just who you want to be

</l>
<l>And every night you shine just like a super star

</l>
<l>That's how the life is played

</l>
<l>A ten cent Masquerade

</l>
<l>You dress, and walk, and talk you're who you think you are



</l>
<l>Street life

</l>
<l>You can run away from time

</l>
<l>Street life

</l>
<l>For a nickel and a dime

</l>
<l>Street life

</l>
<l>But you better not get old

</l>
<l>Street life

</l>
<l>Or you're gonna feel the cold



</l>
<l>There's always love for sale

</l>
<l>A grown-up fairy tale

</l>
<l>Prince charming always smiles behind a silver spoon

</l>
<l>And if you keep it young

</l>
<l>Your song is always sung

</l>
<l>Your love will pay your way beneath the silver moon</l></lyrics></xml>
