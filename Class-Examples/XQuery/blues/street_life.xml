<lyrics>



I play the street life

Because there's no place I can go

Street life

And it's the only life I know

Street life

And there's a thousand parts to play

Street life

Until you play your life away



You let the people see

Just who you want to be

And every night you shine just like a super star

That's how the life is played

A ten cent Masquerade

You dress, and walk, and talk you're who you think you are



Street life

You can run away from time

Street life

For a nickel and a dime

Street life

But you better not get old

Street life

Or you're gonna feel the cold



There's always love for sale

A grown-up fairy tale

Prince charming always smiles behind a silver spoon

And if you keep it young

Your song is always sung

Your love will pay your way beneath the silver moon
