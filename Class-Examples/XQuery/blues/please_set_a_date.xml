<lyrics>


<l>Hey baby, baby please set a date

</l>
<l>Hey baby, baby please set a date

</l>
<l>Well, don't say tomorrow

</l>
<l>'Cause tomorrow is too far away



</l>
<l>Now, when I want some lovin'

</l>
<l>I really want it bad

</l>
<l>But the way you've been doin' baby

</l>
<l>You really makes me mad

</l>
<l>Hey baby, baby please set a date

</l>
<l>Well, don't say tomorrow

</l>
<l>'Cause tomorrow is too far away



</l>
<l>Now, when I want some lovin'

</l>
<l>My face gets full of frowns

</l>
<l>Now baby, if you don't hurry

</l>
<l>I'm going to leave your town

</l>
<l>Hey baby, baby please set a date

</l>
<l>Well, don't say tomorrow

</l>
<l>'Cause tomorrow is too far away



</l>
<l>Now, when we first met, baby

</l>
<l>We swore we wouldn't part

</l>
<l>But the way you're doin' me lately

</l>
<l>You're really breakin' my heart

</l>
<l>Hey baby, baby please set a date

</l>
<l>Well, don't say tomorrow

</l>
<l>'Cause tomorrow is too far away</l></lyrics></xml>
