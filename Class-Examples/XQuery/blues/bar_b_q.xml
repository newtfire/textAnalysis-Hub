<lyrics>



No, baby, tell me why don't you?

Well, now, baby, tell me why don't you?

Aw, baby, tell me why don't you?



No, baby, now want to make me some?

Oh, now, baby, now want to make me some?

Aw, baby, now want to make me some?



No, baby, tell me why don't you?

Oh, now, baby, tell me why don't you

Aw, make me some of your fine famous bar-B-Q?
