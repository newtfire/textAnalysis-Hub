<lyrics>



Black cat on my door-step, black cat on my window-sill

If one black cat don't cross me, another black cat will



Last night a hoot owl come and sit right over my door

A feelin' seems to tell me I'll never see my man no mo'



I feel my left side a-jumpin', my heart a-bumpin', I'm mindin' my P's
and Q's
1

I feel my brain a-thumpin', I've got no time to lose

Mama's superstitious, tryin' to overcome these blues



________

Note: superstition was omni-present in the black communities of the
south and much significance was attached to the behavior of animals
which were looked upon as omens of good or evil;

Note 1: P's and Q's, haven't found the meaning yet, if anyone has any
suggestions, please 
mail
me
.
