<lyrics>



Travelin' south, tryin' to work my way back home

I said I'm headed south, tryin' to work my way back home

I'm so broken an' hungry, ain't no money for the telephone



Feet so tired, I think I'm gonna lay down

I say my feets is so tired, ya'all, I think I'm gonna lay down

I got another hundred miles, before I make the next town



I'll be glad to leave this town, I ain't comin' back no more

I'll be glad to leave this town, ya'all, I ain't comin' back no
more

I'm gonna head back down to Texas, that's the only place I know



Travelin' south, tryin' to work my way back home

Travelin' south, tryin' to work my way back home

I'm so broke an' hungry, ain't got no money for the telephone
