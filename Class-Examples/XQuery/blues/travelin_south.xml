<lyrics>


<l>Travelin' south, tryin' to work my way back home

</l>
<l>I said I'm headed south, tryin' to work my way back home

</l>
<l>I'm so broken an' hungry, ain't no money for the telephone



</l>
<l>Feet so tired, I think I'm gonna lay down

</l>
<l>I say my feets is so tired, ya'all, I think I'm gonna lay down

</l>
<l>I got another hundred miles, before I make the next town



</l>
<l>I'll be glad to leave this town, I ain't comin' back no more

</l>
<l>I'll be glad to leave this town, ya'all, I ain't comin' back no
more

</l>
<l>I'm gonna head back down to Texas, that's the only place I know



</l>
<l>Travelin' south, tryin' to work my way back home

</l>
<l>Travelin' south, tryin' to work my way back home

</l>
<l>I'm so broke an' hungry, ain't got no money for the telephone</l></lyrics></xml>
