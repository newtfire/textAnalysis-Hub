<lyrics>


<l>It ain't you

</l>
<l>No it ain't me

</l>
<l>That's not the way

</l>
<l>Love's supposed to be



</l>
<l>And it's just no good

</l>
<l>No it ain't right

</l>
<l>For you to be sitting all alone

</l>
<l>Crying every night



</l>
<l>You're down on your knees

</l>
<l>Scared he's gonna leave

</l>
<l>But if you really wanna know

</l>
<l>You're gonna have to let go



</l>
<l>Cause that's not love

</l>
<l>Love don't feel that bad

</l>
<l>That's not love

</l>
<l>It don't feel that sad

</l>
<l>No that's not love

</l>
<l>'Cause you don't feel good inside

</l>
<l>I don't know what it is

</l>
<l>But that's not love



</l>
<l>Inside your heart

</l>
<l>It's always raining

</l>
<l>And you're oh so tired

</l>
<l>Tired of your own complaining



</l>
<l>This is for real

</l>
<l>It ain't no game

</l>
<l>You can't measure your love

</l>
<l>By the depths of your pain</l></lyrics></xml>
