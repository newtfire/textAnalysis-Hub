<lyrics>



It ain't you

No it ain't me

That's not the way

Love's supposed to be



And it's just no good

No it ain't right

For you to be sitting all alone

Crying every night



You're down on your knees

Scared he's gonna leave

But if you really wanna know

You're gonna have to let go



Cause that's not love

Love don't feel that bad

That's not love

It don't feel that sad

No that's not love

'Cause you don't feel good inside

I don't know what it is

But that's not love



Inside your heart

It's always raining

And you're oh so tired

Tired of your own complaining



This is for real

It ain't no game

You can't measure your love

By the depths of your pain
