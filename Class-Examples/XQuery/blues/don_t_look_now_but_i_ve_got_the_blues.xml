<lyrics>


<l>My pockets are empty, I feel so low

</l>
<l>If somebody loves me, ain't said so

</l>
<l>And I got holes in both of my shoes

</l>
<l>Don't look now but I've got the blues



</l>
<l>There ain't nobody on this old earth

</l>
<l>Who'll give a nickel for what I'm worth

</l>
<l>I got more worries that I can use

</l>
<l>Don't look now but I've got the blues



</l>
<l>Troubles everywhere, I act like I don't care

</l>
<l>But it's not true

</l>
<l>'Cause I remember things, so many many things

</l>
<l>But mostly, I remember you



</l>
<l>I'm gonna go some place else

</l>
<l>And cry these tears all by myself

</l>
<l>I ain't got nothing left to lose

</l>
<l>Don't look now but I've got the blues</l></lyrics></xml>
