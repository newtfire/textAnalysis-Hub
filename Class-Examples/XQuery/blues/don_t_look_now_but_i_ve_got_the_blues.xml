<lyrics>



My pockets are empty, I feel so low

If somebody loves me, ain't said so

And I got holes in both of my shoes

Don't look now but I've got the blues



There ain't nobody on this old earth

Who'll give a nickel for what I'm worth

I got more worries that I can use

Don't look now but I've got the blues



Troubles everywhere, I act like I don't care

But it's not true

'Cause I remember things, so many many things

But mostly, I remember you



I'm gonna go some place else

And cry these tears all by myself

I ain't got nothing left to lose

Don't look now but I've got the blues
