<lyrics>

<l>My best man, my best friend,

</l>
<l>told me to stop peddlin'
1
gin </l>
<l>
They even told me to keep my hands

</l>
<l>out people's pocket where their money was in



</l>
<l>But I wouldn't listen or have any shame,

</l>
<l>'long as someone else would take the blame

</l>
<l>Now I can see it all come home to me

</l>
<l>I'm sittin' in the jailhouse now

</l>
<l>I mean, I'm in the jailhouse now



</l>
<l>I done stop runnin' around with this one

</l>
<l>and these good lookin' browns

</l>
<l>Any time you see me, I was good time bound,

</l>
<l>with this one, that one, most all in town

</l>
<l>I'm in the jailhouse now,

</l>
<l>I'm sittin' in the jailhouse now



</l>
<note>Note 1: peddlin', to travel about with wares, in this case gin, for
sale. In a wider sense: to sell, or offer for sale from place to
place</note></lyrics></xml>
