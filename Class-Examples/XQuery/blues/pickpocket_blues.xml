<lyrics>



My best man, my best friend,

told me to stop peddlin'
1
 gin

They even told me to keep my hands

out people's pocket where their money was in



But I wouldn't listen or have any shame,

'long as someone else would take the blame

Now I can see it all come home to me

I'm sittin' in the jailhouse now

I mean, I'm in the jailhouse now



I done stop runnin' around with this one

and these good lookin' browns

Any time you see me, I was good time bound,

with this one, that one, most all in town

I'm in the jailhouse now,

I'm sittin' in the jailhouse now



__________

Note 1: peddlin', to travel about with wares, in this case gin, for
sale. In a wider sense: to sell, or offer for sale from place to
place.
