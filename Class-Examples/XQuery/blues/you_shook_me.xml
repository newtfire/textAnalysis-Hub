<lyrics>



Well, well, well

She shook me, shook me, shook me

(Yes, she shook me)

All night long, all night long

(All night long, all night long)

You, you, you know this woman

She shook me, shook me

All night long, all night long

All night long

Mm hm (Mm hm)



Now B., she shook me



Go ahead, tell me about it, John



Just like a hurricane, hurricane

You, you, you know that woman

She shook me, shook me

Like a hurricane, hurricane

Shake the ground, you know

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah



You shook me, baby

You shook me all night long

You shook me, baby

You shook me all night long

You kept on shaking me, baby

Till you messed up my happy home

My happy home, my happy home



The woman broke up

My happy home, my happy home

Now now she broke up, she broke up

My only home, my only home

My wife and child, ooh



You move me, baby

Just like a hurricane

Just like a hurricane

You move me, baby

Just like a hurricane

Like a hurricane

You know you move me, baby

Just like an earthquake

On the land, on the land, yeah

Yeah



Talk about it some more, John



You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you

You shouldn't shake me

The way you do, way you do

All night long

Sometimes I wonder

What's gonna happen

To my poor wife and child

I got a child

She done made me love her

And now I can't be satisfied



(You, you, you, you, you)

Sometimes I wonder

(Can shake me the way you do)

What's gonna happen

To my poor wife and child



(You, you, you, you, you, you, you)

(You shouldn't shake me way you do)

(Way you do)

You done made me love you

And now I can't be satisfied



You, you, you

You, you, you, you, you

(You, you, you)

Shouldn't shake me way you do

(Shouldn't shake me, baby)

The woman shook me

(The woman shook me, shook me)

Woman shook me, shook me

Shook me, shook me

Like an earthquake shakes the ground



That feel good



Tell her again



Look, woman

I ain't gonna let you, you, you, you

Hurt me no more

(I ain't gonna let you hurt me)

You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you

You, you, you can't hurt me no more

(You ain't gonna hurt me no more)

I ain't letting you hurt me, hurt me

Hurt me no more, no more

No more, yeah
