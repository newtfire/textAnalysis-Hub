<lyrics>



I went down 13 Highway, drivin' a brand new V8 Ford

I went down 13 Highway, drivin' a brand new V8 Ford

Oh you know I was drivin' so fast, baby I couldn't hardly see the
road



Oh I was drivin' 60 miles an hour, all up and down the hill

Oh you know I was drivin' 60 miles an hour, all up and down the
hill

Oh you know I was speedin' so fast, I couldn't hardly control my
wheel



Don't the highway look lonesome, after the sun done gone down

Oh don't the highway look lonesome, after the sun done gone down

Oh you know you're all alone by yourself, there ain't nobody else
around
