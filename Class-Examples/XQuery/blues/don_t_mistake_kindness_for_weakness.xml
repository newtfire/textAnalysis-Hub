<lyrics>



You've been runnin' in the streets again, but I'd never had a hand on
you

I've been a better man this year, than all the men that you've been
through

Don't mistake kindness for weakness, 'cause a little girl, only a
fool would stay with you



I tried so hard to please you babe, I've even turned your lies to
truth

I said I tried so hard to please you baby, I turned your lies to
truth

But when you said were my baby, I think I got to ask you for more
proof



Don't mistake kindness for weakness, 'cause your chicken has come to
roost

I said don't mistake kindness for weakness, baby, your chicken done
come to roost

I think another man would be a fool, to try to hang around with
you



I'm all done Mister Nice Guy but I ain't playin' around with your
rules

If you think that's liquor talkin', you better try an' get on back to
school

So mistake kindness for weakness, woman you done used up your, your
last fool
