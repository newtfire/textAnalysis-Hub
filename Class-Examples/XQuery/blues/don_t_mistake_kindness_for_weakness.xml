<lyrics>


<l>You've been runnin' in the streets again, but I'd never had a hand on
you

</l>
<l>I've been a better man this year, than all the men that you've been
through

</l>
<l>Don't mistake kindness for weakness, 'cause a little girl, only a

fool would stay with you




</l>
<l>I tried so hard to please you babe, I've even turned your lies to
truth

</l>
<l>I said I tried so hard to please you baby, I turned your lies to
truth

</l>
<l>But when you said were my baby, I think I got to ask you for more

proof




</l>
<l>Don't mistake kindness for weakness, 'cause your chicken has come to
roost

</l>
<l>I said don't mistake kindness for weakness, baby, your chicken done
come to roost

</l>
<l>I think another man would be a fool, to try to hang around with

you




</l>
<l>I'm all done Mister Nice Guy but I ain't playin' around with your
rules

</l>
<l>If you think that's liquor talkin', you better try an' get on back to
school

</l><l>So mistake kindness for weakness, woman you done used up your, your</l>
<l>last fool</l></lyrics></xml>
