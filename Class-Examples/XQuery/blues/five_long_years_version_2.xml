<l>If you ever been mistreated, then you know just what I'm
talking about

</l>
<l>If you ever been mistreated, then you know just what I'm talking
about

</l>
<l>I worked five long years for one woman, and she had the nerve to put

me out




</l>
<l>I'm gonna jump out of steel mill, truckin' steel like a slave

</l>
<l>For five long years every Friday, I went straight home with all of my
pays

</l>
<l>If you ever been mistreated, then you should know just what I'm
talking about

</l>
<l>I worked five long years for one woman, and she had the nerve to put

me out




</l>
<l>Yes I finally learned a lesson, I took a long time to know

</l>
<l>The next woman I marry, she's gonna work and bring in the dough

</l>
<l>If you ever been mistreated, then you should know just what I'm
talking about

</l><l>I worked five long years for one woman, and she had the nerve to put</l>
<l>me out</l></lyrics></xml>
