<lyrics>



If you ever been mistreated, then you know just what I'm
talking about

If you ever been mistreated, then you know just what I'm talking
about

I worked five long years for one woman, and she had the nerve to put
me out



I'm gonna jump out of steel mill, truckin' steel like a slave

For five long years every Friday, I went straight home with all of my
pays

If you ever been mistreated, then you should know just what I'm
talking about

I worked five long years for one woman, and she had the nerve to put
me out



Yes I finally learned a lesson, I took a long time to know

The next woman I marry, she's gonna work and bring in the dough

If you ever been mistreated, then you should know just what I'm
talking about

I worked five long years for one woman, and she had the nerve to put
me out
