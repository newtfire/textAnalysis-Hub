<lyrics>


<l>I've had everything that money can buy,

</l>
<l>oh, but still I'm so unhappy darling, that I could cry

</l>
<l>Because I've never had peace of mind, darling, in my life time



</l>
<l>When you're in trouble and all down and out,

</l>
<l>then you'll find out, darling, what it's all about

</l>
<l>Then you'll realize that peace of mind, darling, is hard to find



</l>
<l>I've been everywhere, seen everything but I only have myself to
blame,

</l>
<l>for not realizing while I was riding high that happiness is something
money can't buy

</l>
<l>Oh, the things I haven't done, darling, are mighty few

</l>
<l>Yes, I've had trouble baby, and good luck too

</l><l>Oh, but I've never had peace of mind, darling, in my life time</l></lyrics></xml>
