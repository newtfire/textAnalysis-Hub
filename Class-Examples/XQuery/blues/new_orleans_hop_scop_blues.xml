Old New Orleans is a great big old southern town, where
hospitality you will surely find

The population there is very, very fair, with ev'rything they do

White folks do it too, they have a dance surely it's something rare
there



Glide, slide, prance, dance, hop, stop

Take it easy honey!

Hmm

I can never git tired of dancin' those Hop Scop Blues

Once more you glide, slide, prance, dance

The Hop Scop Blues will make you do a lovely shake

They'll make you feel so grand when you join hand in hand,

I'll never git tired of dancin' those Hop Scop Blues



Once more you glide, slide, prance, I said dance, oh, hop, now
stop

Take it easy honey!

Oh

I can never git tired of dancin' those Hop Scop Blues

Look out now!

You glide, slide, I said prance, dance

Hop Scop Blues will make you do a lovely shake

They'll make you feel so grand when you join hand in hand,

I'll never git tired of dancin' those Hop Scop Blues
