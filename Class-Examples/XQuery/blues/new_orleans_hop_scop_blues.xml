<l>Old New Orleans is a great big old southern town, where
hospitality you will surely find

</l>
<l>The population there is very, very fair, with ev'rything they do

</l>
<l>White folks do it too, they have a dance surely it's something rare

there




</l>
<l>Glide, slide, prance, dance, hop, stop

</l>
<l>Take it easy honey!

</l>
<l>Hmm

</l>
<l>I can never git tired of dancin' those Hop Scop Blues

</l>
<l>Once more you glide, slide, prance, dance

</l>
<l>The Hop Scop Blues will make you do a lovely shake

</l>
<l>They'll make you feel so grand when you join hand in hand,

</l>
<l>I'll never git tired of dancin' those Hop Scop Blues



</l>
<l>Once more you glide, slide, prance, I said dance, oh, hop, now
stop

</l>
<l>Take it easy honey!

</l>
<l>Oh

</l>
<l>I can never git tired of dancin' those Hop Scop Blues

</l>
<l>Look out now!

</l>
<l>You glide, slide, I said prance, dance

</l>
<l>Hop Scop Blues will make you do a lovely shake

</l>
<l>They'll make you feel so grand when you join hand in hand,

</l>
<l>I'll never git tired of dancin' those Hop Scop Blues</l></lyrics></xml>
