<lyrics>



(Whoa-ooh baby, I love you)

Ooh baby I love you, yeah

(Whoa-ooh baby, I love you)

Ooh baby I love you



(Spoken:)

Wait a minute!

You know my woman told me, she said,

"Bo Diddley, I love you, but I'm leavin'"

I said, "What?"

She said, "I love you but I'm leavin' you"

And I said, "Baby?"

And she kept sayin', "Whoa baby, I love you"

What you say, girl?

(Whoa-ooh baby, I love you)

Ooh, I love you

Ooow! Somethin' wrong here someplace

(Whoa-oh baby, I love you)



Wait a minute!

She said, "Here's the key to all of your locks,

take my name off of your mailbox

Here's the key to your Cadillac,

I got my own parked right out back"



I said, "What?"

There somethin' wrong here

And she kept talkin' 'bout

I love you

(Whoa-ooh baby, I love you)



Fellas, let me tell you somethin'

Ha, ha, ha

Wow! Woo, somethin' wrong

(Whoa-oh baby, I love (need) you



Wait a minute!

Let me tell you what else she told me



She said, "You know one thing, Diddley

I got all my bags packed,

in the middle of the dining room floor

I'm all packed and ready to go"

I said, "But baby, whoa baby

Baby, baby"



And then she told me

she said, "Got my own place,

with some brand new lock

I'm gonna tell the mailman,

I got a brand new box"

I said

(Whoa-oh baby, I love you)



"Woo you ain't 
jivin'
 are
you?"

There's somethin' wrong some place

She kept talkin' 'bout

"Ooh baby, (I want you, I love you)

(I need you)

(I love you) I love you

(I love you)
