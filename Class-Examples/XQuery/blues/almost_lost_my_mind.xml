<lyrics>


<l>When I lost my baby, I almost lost my mind

</l>
<l>When I lost my baby, I almost lost my mind

</l>
<l>My eyes was full of tears since she left me behind



</l>
<l>I pass a million people; I can't tell who I meet

</l>
<l>I pass a million people; I can't tell who I meet

</l>
<l>My eyes are full of tears, where can my baby be?



</l>
<l>I went to see a gypsy to get my fortune read

</l>
<l>I went to see a gypsy to have my fortune read

</l>
<l>My head hung in sorrow when she said what she said



</l>
<l>When I lost my baby, I almost lost my mind

</l>
<l>When I lost my baby, I almost lost my mind

</l>
<l>When I lost my baby, I almost lost my mind</l></lyrics></xml>
