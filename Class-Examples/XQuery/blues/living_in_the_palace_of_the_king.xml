<lyrics>


<l>I was born down in Dallas, raised up in the city of the
wind
1

</l>
<l>Yeah, I could spend a month of Sundays, talkin' about the places I've
been

</l>
<l>Yeah, I played the blues in England, I visit with the queen

</l>
<l>She really dug my style, but queen is not my thing

</l>
<l>I'm goin' back to Dallas, back to the palace of the king



</l>
<l>Hey, they wanted me in Russia, but Moscow was much too cold

</l>
<l>Yeah, I could have played down in Denmark, but the girls was much too
old

</l>
<l>Yeah, let me tell you something funny, I don't know what they say

</l>
<l>I can't find a Chitlins Pizza for any price I pay

</l>
<l>I'm goin' back to Dallas, back to the palace of the king



</l>
<l>Oh, living in the palace of the king

</l>
<l>Yeah, I'm living in the palace, gives me service quite the same

yeah




</l>
<l>I can make you smile with every note I play

</l>
<l>I can make you happy playin' the blues my way

</l>
<l>I'm goin back to Dallas, back to the palace of the king



</l>
<l>Oh, living in the palace of the king

</l>
<l>Yeah, I'm living in the palace, never had service quite the same

yeah




</l>
<l>I been around the world, I have many things,

</l>
<l>nothing makes me satisfied, but this blues I sing

</l>
<l>I'm goin' back to Dallas, back to the palace of the king



</l>
<l>Yeah I'm living in the palace of the king

</l>
<l>Living in the palace of the king...
