<lyrics>



I was born down in Dallas, raised up in the city of the
wind
1

Yeah, I could spend a month of Sundays, talkin' about the places I've
been

Yeah, I played the blues in England, I visit with the queen

She really dug my style, but queen is not my thing

I'm goin' back to Dallas, back to the palace of the king



Hey, they wanted me in Russia, but Moscow was much too cold

Yeah, I could have played down in Denmark, but the girls was much too
old

Yeah, let me tell you something funny, I don't know what they say

I can't find a Chitlins Pizza for any price I pay

I'm goin' back to Dallas, back to the palace of the king



Oh, living in the palace of the king

Yeah, I'm living in the palace, gives me service quite the same
yeah



I can make you smile with every note I play

I can make you happy playin' the blues my way

I'm goin back to Dallas, back to the palace of the king



Oh, living in the palace of the king

Yeah, I'm living in the palace, never had service quite the same
yeah



I been around the world, I have many things,

nothing makes me satisfied, but this blues I sing

I'm goin' back to Dallas, back to the palace of the king



Yeah I'm living in the palace of the king

Living in the palace of the king...

Note 1: city of the wind, the windy city or Chicago
