<lyrics>



Worried in the nighttime, worried in the day

'Cause another sweetie, took my man away

Down in St. Louis, there I lost my pride and joy

St. Louis woman, stole the heart of my big boy, I'm cryin'!



St. Louis gal, just look what you done done, I said what you done
done

St. Louis gal, you gonna have some fun, I mean a-lots of fun!

I'm always cryin' the blues, both night and day

Now, daddy's gone but you will shake in your shoes

Hear what I say, 'cause some fine mornin', without any warnin'

St. Louis gal, I'm gonna handle you, I say manhandle you

You'll find yourself in a jam, as sure as anything what am

Down in Missouri, there'll come a time, your life won't be worth a
dime

You stole my pal, St. Louis gal, I'm going a-huntin', do, do, de,
do

You know just what I'm gonna do, you stole my pal, St. Louis gal
