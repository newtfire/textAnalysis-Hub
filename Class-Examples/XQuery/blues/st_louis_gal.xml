<lyrics>


<l>Worried in the nighttime, worried in the day

</l>
<l>'Cause another sweetie, took my man away

</l>
<l>Down in St. Louis, there I lost my pride and joy

</l>
<l>St. Louis woman, stole the heart of my big boy, I'm cryin'!



</l>
<l>St. Louis gal, just look what you done done, I said what you done
done

</l>
<l>St. Louis gal, you gonna have some fun, I mean a-lots of fun!

</l>
<l>I'm always cryin' the blues, both night and day

</l>
<l>Now, daddy's gone but you will shake in your shoes

</l>
<l>Hear what I say, 'cause some fine mornin', without any warnin'

</l>
<l>St. Louis gal, I'm gonna handle you, I say manhandle you

</l>
<l>You'll find yourself in a jam, as sure as anything what am

</l>
<l>Down in Missouri, there'll come a time, your life won't be worth a
dime

</l>
<l>You stole my pal, St. Louis gal, I'm going a-huntin', do, do, de,
do

</l>
<l>You know just what I'm gonna do, you stole my pal, St. Louis gal</l></lyrics></xml>
