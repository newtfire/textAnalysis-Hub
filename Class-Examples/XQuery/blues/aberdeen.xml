<lyrics>


<l>I was over in Aberdeen,

</l>
<l>on my way to New Orleans

</l>
<l>I was over in Aberdeen,

</l>
<l>on my way to New Orleans

</l>
<l>Well them Aberdeen women told me,

</l>
<l>they would give me my gasoline



</l>
<l>Aberdeen is my home,

</l>
<l>but they just don't want me around

</l>
<l>Aberdeen is my home,

</l>
<l>but they just don't want me around

</l>
<l>I'm gonna take these women,

</l>
<l>take them out this town



</l>
<l>Well just look over yonder,

</l>
<l>coming down the road

</l>
<l>Well just look over yonder,

</l>
<l>coming down the road

</l>
<l>That must be my baby coming,

</l>
<l>tell me she don't want me no more



</l>
<l>Well there's too many women,

</l>
<l>I ain't never seen

</l>
<l>Well there's too many women,

</l>
<l>I ain't never seen

</l>
<l>I bring too many women,

</l>
<l>back from New Orleans



</l>
<l>I was standin' 'round cryin',

</l>
<l>with my heart right in my hand

</l>
<l>I was standin' 'round cryin',

</l>
<l>with my heart right in my hand

</l>
<l>I was lookin' for that woman,

</l>
<l>one ain't got no man



</l>
<l>Well just look over yonder,

</l>
<l>where we used to live

</l>
<l>Well just look over yonder,

</l>
<l>where we used to live

</l>
<l>Don't you know it's killing me baby,

</l>
<l>how we can't live here no more



</l>
<l>Well it's goodbye baby,

</l>
<l>If I'm never gonna see you no more

</l>
<l>Well it's goodbye baby,

</l>
<l>if I'm never gonna see you no more

</l>
<l>I'm gonna tell everybody you've been,

</l>
<l>still knockin' at my door</l></lyrics></xml>
