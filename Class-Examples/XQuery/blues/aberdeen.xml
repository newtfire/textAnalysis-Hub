<lyrics>



I was over in Aberdeen,

on my way to New Orleans

I was over in Aberdeen,

on my way to New Orleans

Well them Aberdeen women told me,

they would give me my gasoline



Aberdeen is my home,

but they just don't want me around

Aberdeen is my home,

but they just don't want me around

I'm gonna take these women,

take them out this town



Well just look over yonder,

coming down the road

Well just look over yonder,

coming down the road

That must be my baby coming,

tell me she don't want me no more



Well there's too many women,

I ain't never seen

Well there's too many women,

I ain't never seen

I bring too many women,

back from New Orleans



I was standin' 'round cryin',

with my heart right in my hand

I was standin' 'round cryin',

with my heart right in my hand

I was lookin' for that woman,

one ain't got no man



Well just look over yonder,

where we used to live

Well just look over yonder,

where we used to live

Don't you know it's killing me baby,

how we can't live here no more



Well it's goodbye baby,

If I'm never gonna see you no more

Well it's goodbye baby,

if I'm never gonna see you no more

I'm gonna tell everybody you've been,

still knockin' at my door
