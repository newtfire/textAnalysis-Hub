<lyrics>


<l>Clouds, one by one, fill the sky,

just like these tears that fill my eyes
I know by now she ain't comin' back,
I watch my world slowly fade into black


</l>
<l>Look out my window it's still rainin'
Look out my window it's still rainin'

</l>
<l>They say that time heals everything,

I've felt the pain that love can bring
It don't get no better with each passing day,
any hope I had is slowly slipping away


</l>
<l>Look out my window, it's still rainin'
Look out my window, it's still rainin'

</l>
<l>I thought the morning would rescue me,

but the rain keeps falling endlessly, endlessly
Sometimes I wonder what'll become of me,
there ain't much left of what I used to be
Her love shone on me like the morning light,
now here I am alone again tonight
