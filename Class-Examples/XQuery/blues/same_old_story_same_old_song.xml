<lyrics>


<l>One hand will take, one hand will give

</l>
<l>That's all we know and that is how we live

</l>
<l>One day hello, next day goodbye

</l>
<l>And everyone just stay high



</l>
<l>Same old story, same old song

</l>
<l>Goes all right till it goes all wrong

</l>
<l>Now you're going, then you're gone

</l>
<l>Same old story, same old song



</l>
<l>One builds you up, one tears you down

</l>
<l>To some you're a saint, to others you're a clown

</l>
<l>What can you do, just see it through

</l>
<l>And hold on to what is left to you



</l>
<l>Same old story, same old song

</l>
<l>Goes all right till it goes all wrong

</l>
<l>Now you're going, then you're gone

</l>
<l>Same old story, same old song</l></lyrics></xml>
