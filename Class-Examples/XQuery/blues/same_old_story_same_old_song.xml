<lyrics>



One hand will take, one hand will give

That's all we know and that is how we live

One day hello, next day goodbye

And everyone just stay high



Same old story, same old song

Goes all right till it goes all wrong

Now you're going, then you're gone

Same old story, same old song



One builds you up, one tears you down

To some you're a saint, to others you're a clown

What can you do, just see it through

And hold on to what is left to you



Same old story, same old song

Goes all right till it goes all wrong

Now you're going, then you're gone

Same old story, same old song
