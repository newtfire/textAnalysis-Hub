<l>When it rains five days and the skies turn dark as night

</l>
<l>When it rains five days and the skies turn dark as night

</l>
<l>Then trouble's takin' place in the lowlands at night



</l>
<l>I woke up this mornin', can't even get out of my door

</l>
<l>I woke up this mornin', can't even get out of my door

</l>
<l>There's been enough trouble to make a poor girl wonder where she want

to go




</l>
<l>Then they rowed a little boat about five miles 'cross the pond

</l>
<l>Then they rowed a little boat about five miles 'cross the pond

</l>
<l>I packed all my clothes, throwed them in and they rowed me along



</l>
<l>When it thunders and lightnin' and when the wind begins to blow

</l>
<l>When it thunders and lightnin' and the wind begins to blow

</l>
<l>There's thousands of people ain't got no place to go



</l>
<l>Then I went and stood upon some high old lonesome hill

</l>
<l>Then I went and stood upon some high old lonesome hill

</l>
<l>Then looked down on the house were I used to live



</l>
<l>Backwater
1
blues done call me to pack my things and go </l>
<l>
Backwater blues done call me to pack my things and go

</l>
<l>'Cause my house fell down and I can't live there no more



</l>
<l>Mmm, I can't move no more

</l>
<l>Mmm, I can't move no more

</l>
<l>There ain't no place for a poor old girl to go

<note>Note: This was one of her most successful records; it was recorded
just before the catastrophic 
great
Mississippi flood of 1927
;

Note 1: backwater, mostly old river beds which are left to take the
excess flood water to relieve pressure on the 
levees

(embankments). As the height of the water is excessive, however,
breaches in the levee walls are deliberately made at certain points
to allow particular areas to flood and thus lessen the pressure of
water. These are the "backwaters," which occur in the St. Francis
Basin to the west of the river between 
Memphis

and Helena, in the great 
Yazoo-Mississippi
Delta
 north of 
Vicksburg
,
in the Tensas Basin west of 
Natchez
,
and at other selected points.</note></lyrics></xml>
