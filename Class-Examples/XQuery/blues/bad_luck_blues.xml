<l>Baby did you hear about the bad luck, the bad luck that
happened just about six months ago?

</l>
<l>Now did you hear about the bad luck, the bad luck that happened just
about six months ago?

</l>
<l>Now my cousin Marvin got shot down, just as he was walkin' out the

do'




</l>
<l>Now and he said please mister, said please don't shoot me no mo'

</l>
<l>Now and he said please mister, said please don't shoot me no mo'

</l>
<l>He said because my breath is gettin' short, and my heart is beatin'

awful slow




</l>
<l>And Marvin say I know I got some friends, I want somebody to go and
get my mother for me

</l>
<l>Marvin say I know I got some friends, I want somebody to go and get
my mother for me

</l>
<l>Say maybe she can help me with my trouble, people I'm in so much

misery




</l>
<l>And he say I hate to go leave my mother and father, I hate to go
leave my cousin Sonny Boy insane

</l>
<l>He say I hate to go leave my mother and father, say I hate to go
leave my cousin Sonny Boy insane

</l><l>Now go tell 'em if they be good they'll come to see me, people on</l>
