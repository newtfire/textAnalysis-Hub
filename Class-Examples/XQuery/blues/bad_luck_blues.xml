<lyrics>



Baby did you hear about the bad luck, the bad luck that
happened just about six months ago?

Now did you hear about the bad luck, the bad luck that happened just
about six months ago?

Now my cousin Marvin got shot down, just as he was walkin' out the
do'



Now and he said please mister, said please don't shoot me no mo'

Now and he said please mister, said please don't shoot me no mo'

He said because my breath is gettin' short, and my heart is beatin'
awful slow



And Marvin say I know I got some friends, I want somebody to go and
get my mother for me

Marvin say I know I got some friends, I want somebody to go and get
my mother for me

Say maybe she can help me with my trouble, people I'm in so much
misery



And he say I hate to go leave my mother and father, I hate to go
leave my cousin Sonny Boy insane

He say I hate to go leave my mother and father, say I hate to go
leave my cousin Sonny Boy insane

Now go tell 'em if they be good they'll come to see me, people on
Resurrection Day
