<lyrics>



I want to be close to you baby as I can get

Close to you baby as water is wet

Close to you baby as a hair on your head

Close to you babe you better believe what I said



I want to be close to you baby,

yeah, let me be close to you

I want to be close to you darlin',

'til you don't know what to say or do



I want to be close to you baby as white is to rice

Close to you baby as cold is to ice

Close to you baby as a fire is to smoke

Close to you baby as a pig is to pork

I want to be close to you baby,

who, let me be close to you

I want to be close to you darlin',

'til you don't know what to say or do



I said closer and closer baby

Closer and closer baby, haha

Closer and closer baby

Closer and closer baby

I want to be close to you darlin',

'til you don't know what to say or do



I want to be close to you baby as the whites of your eyes

Close to you baby as cold is to ice

Close to you baby as an egg is to a hen

Close to you baby as Siamese twins



I want to be close to you baby,

whoa let me be close to you

I want to be close to you darlin',

'til you don't know what to say or do
