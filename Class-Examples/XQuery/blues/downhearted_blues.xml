<lyrics>


<l>Gee, but it's hard to love someone when that someone don't
love you

</l>
<l>I'm so disgusted, heartbroken, too

</l>
<l>I've got those down hearted blues

</l>
<l>Once I was crazy 'bout a man

</l>
<l>He mistreated me all the time

</l>
<l>The next man I get he's got to promise to be mine, all mine



</l>
<l>If I could only find the man oh how happy I would be

</l>
<l>To the good Lord ev'ry night I pray

</l>
<l>Please send my man back to me

</l>
<l>I've almost worried myself to death wond'ring why he went away

</l>
<l>But just wait and see he's gonna want me back some sweet day



</l>
<l>Trouble, trouble, I've had it all my days

</l>
<l>Trouble, trouble, I've had it all my days

</l>
<l>It seems that trouble's going to follow me to my grave



</l>
<l>Got the world in a jug, the stopper's in my hand

</l>
<l>Got the world in a jug

</l>
<l>The stopper's in my hand

</l>
<l>Going to hold it, baby, till you come under my command



</l>
<l>Say, I ain't never loved but three men in my life

</l>
<l>No, I ain't never loved but three men in my life

</l>
<l>'T'was my father, brother and the man who wrecked my life



</l>
<l>'Cause he mistreated me and he drove me from his door

</l>
<l>Yeah, he mistreated me and he drove me from his door

</l>
<l>But the good book says you'll reap just what you sow



</l>
<l>Oh, it may be a week and it may be a month or two

</l>
<l>Yes, it may be a week and it may be a month or two

</l>
<l>But the day you quit me honey, it's coming home to you



</l>
<l>Oh, I walked the floor and I wrung my hands and cried

</l>
<l>Yes, I walked the floor and I wrung my hands and cried

</l>
<l>Had the down hearted blues and couldn't be satisfied



</l>
