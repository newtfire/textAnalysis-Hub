<lyrics>



Gee, but it's hard to love someone when that someone don't
love you

I'm so disgusted, heartbroken, too

I've got those down hearted blues

Once I was crazy 'bout a man

He mistreated me all the time

The next man I get he's got to promise to be mine, all mine



If I could only find the man oh how happy I would be

To the good Lord ev'ry night I pray

Please send my man back to me

I've almost worried myself to death wond'ring why he went away

But just wait and see he's gonna want me back some sweet day



Trouble, trouble, I've had it all my days

Trouble, trouble, I've had it all my days

It seems that trouble's going to follow me to my grave



Got the world in a jug, the stopper's in my hand

Got the world in a jug

The stopper's in my hand

Going to hold it, baby, till you come under my command



Say, I ain't never loved but three men in my life

No, I ain't never loved but three men in my life

'T'was my father, brother and the man who wrecked my life



'Cause he mistreated me and he drove me from his door

Yeah, he mistreated me and he drove me from his door

But the good book says you'll reap just what you sow



Oh, it may be a week and it may be a month or two

Yes, it may be a week and it may be a month or two

But the day you quit me honey, it's coming home to you



Oh, I walked the floor and I wrung my hands and cried

Yes, I walked the floor and I wrung my hands and cried

Had the down hearted blues and couldn't be satisfied
