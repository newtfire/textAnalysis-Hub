<lyrics>


<l>I'm gonna move, baby, way out on the outskirts of town

</l>
<l>I'm gonna move way out on the outskirts of town

</l>
<l>I don't want nobody who's always hanging around



</l>
<l>I'm gonna tell you baby, we're gonna move away from here

</l>
<l>I don't want no ice man, I'm gonna get me a frigidaire

</l>
<l>When we move way out on the outskirts of town

</l>
<l>I don't want nobody who's always hanging around



</l>
<l>I'm gonna bring my own groceries, gonna bring them everyday

</l>
<l>That'll stop the grocery boy, and keep him away



</l>
<l>When we move way out on the outskirts of town

</l>
<l>I don't need nobody always hanging around

</l>
<l>It may seem funny honey, as funny as funny can be

</l>
<l>But if we have any children, I want them all to look like me

</l>
<l>When we move way out on the outskirts of town

</l>
<l>I don't want nobody always hanging around</l></lyrics></xml>
