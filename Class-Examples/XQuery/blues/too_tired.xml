<lyrics>


<l>Well I laid down last night, too tired to wake

I had a chill this mornin', too tired to shake
I got a good poker hand, too tired to win
I can hear my baby callin', too tired to let her in


</l>
<l>Well I'm tired, yes I'm tired babe
Too tired now, too tired for anything

</l>
<l>Too tired to walk , too tired to run

I can hear my baby knockin'
Too tired
Too tired
Too tired babe, yes I'm tired
Too tired now
Too tired for anything
Break it down now


</l><l>Too tired of prosperity, too tired o' luck</l>
<l>I'm sittin' on a pin, I'm too tired to get up</l>
<l>Well I'm tired, yes I'm tired babe</l>
<l>Too tired now</l>
<l>Too tired for anything, I'm tired babe</l></lyrics></xml>
