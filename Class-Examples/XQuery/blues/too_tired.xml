<lyrics>





Well I laid down last night, too tired to wake
I had a chill this mornin', too tired to shake
I got a good poker hand, too tired to win
I can hear my baby callin', too tired to let her in

Well I'm tired, yes I'm tired babe
Too tired now, too tired for anything

Too tired to walk , too tired to run
I can hear my baby knockin'
Too tired
Too tired
Too tired babe, yes I'm tired
Too tired now
Too tired for anything
Break it down now

Too tired of prosperity, too tired o' luck
I'm sittin' on a pin, I'm too tired to get up
Well I'm tired, yes I'm tired babe
Too tired now
Too tired for anything, I'm tired babe
