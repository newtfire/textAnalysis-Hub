<lyrics>


<l>You can't change it,

</l>
<l>can't rearrange it

</l>
<l>If time is all that we got

</l>
<l>then baby let's take it



</l>
<l>Lovin' is a lovin',

</l>
<l>the moment is a-right

</l>
<l>It's worth all the years in the past,

</l>
<l>let's go one more night



</l>
<l>Get away from the blind side of life

</l>
<l>Honey I want you to be by my side

</l>
<l>Me and my back door moves ain't no more,

</l>
<l>no more



</l>
<l>Get away from the blind side of life

</l>
<l>Honey I want you to be by my side

</l>
<l>Me and my back door moves ain't no more,

</l>
<l>no more



</l>
<l>Get away from the blind side of life

</l>
<l>Honey I want you to be by my side

</l>
<l>Me and my back door moves ain't no more,

</l>
<l>no more



</l>
<l>Goodnight my darlin',

</l>
<l>another day has passed

</l>
<l>Forget all those painful memories,

</l>
<l>our love's gonna last



</l>
<l>Come to me baby, come to me one more time

</l>
<l>It's time we got movin', time to move on

</l>
<l>Let's slide out the door, let's slide out the door

</l>
<l>Ride our way home, let's glide our way home



</l>
<l>Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go,

</l>
<l>let's go, let's go, I've come back for more</l></lyrics></xml>
