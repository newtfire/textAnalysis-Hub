<lyrics>



You can't change it,

can't rearrange it

If time is all that we got

then baby let's take it



Lovin' is a lovin',

the moment is a-right

It's worth all the years in the past,

let's go one more night



Get away from the blind side of life

Honey I want you to be by my side

Me and my back door moves ain't no more,

no more



Get away from the blind side of life

Honey I want you to be by my side

Me and my back door moves ain't no more,

no more



Get away from the blind side of life

Honey I want you to be by my side

Me and my back door moves ain't no more,

no more



Goodnight my darlin',

another day has passed

Forget all those painful memories,

our love's gonna last



Come to me baby, come to me one more time

It's time we got movin', time to move on

Let's slide out the door, let's slide out the door

Ride our way home, let's glide our way home



Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go,

let's go, let's go, I've come back for more
