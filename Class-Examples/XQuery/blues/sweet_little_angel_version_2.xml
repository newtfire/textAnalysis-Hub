<lyrics>


<l>I've got a sweet li'l' angel, I love the way she spreads her
wings

</l>
<l>Yes, got a sweet little angel, I love the way she spreads her
wings

</l>
<l>Yes, when she spreads her wings around me, I gets joy 'n'

ev'rything




</l>
<l>Lord, if my baby should quit me, I do believe I would die

</l>
<l>Yeah, if my baby should quit me, I do believe I would die

</l>
<l>Yes, if you don't love me li'l' angel, please, tell me the reason

why




</l>
<l>Yes, asked my baby for a nickel, and she gave me a twenty dollar
bill

</l>
<l>Yeah, I asked my baby for a nickel, and she gave me a twenty dollar
bill

</l>
<l>Yes, you know I asked her to let's go out and have a good time,

</l>
<l>and she bought me a Cadillac Seville</l></lyrics></xml>
