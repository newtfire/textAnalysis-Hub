<lyrics>



I've got a sweet li'l' angel, I love the way she spreads her
wings

Yes, got a sweet little angel, I love the way she spreads her
wings

Yes, when she spreads her wings around me, I gets joy 'n'
ev'rything



Lord, if my baby should quit me, I do believe I would die

Yeah, if my baby should quit me, I do believe I would die

Yes, if you don't love me li'l' angel, please, tell me the reason
why



Yes, asked my baby for a nickel, and she gave me a twenty dollar
bill

Yeah, I asked my baby for a nickel, and she gave me a twenty dollar
bill

Yes, you know I asked her to let's go out and have a good time,

and she bought me a Cadillac Seville
