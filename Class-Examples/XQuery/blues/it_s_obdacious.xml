<lyrics>





Ooh wee baby, goodness gracious,
the way I love you is contagious
Ooh wee baby, can't you see I'm in love with you

So come on baby don't be stubborn,
just for you I got a little lovin'
Ooh wee baby, can't you see I'm in love with you

Well your kisses taste so sweet,
they thrill me right off of my feet
I'd walk a mile just to see you smile
Thinking 'bout you nearly drives me wild

Come on babe don't be stubborn,
just for you I got a little lovin'
Ooh wee baby, can't you see I'm in love with you

Well your kisses taste so sweet,
they thrill me right off of my feet
I'd walk a mile just to see you smile
Thinking 'bout you nearly drives me wild

Come on babe don't be stubborn,
just for you I got a little lovin'
Ooh wee baby, can't you see I'm in love with you

Yes I'm so in love with you
Baby I'm so in love with you
Ooh wee baby, can't you see I'm in love with you
