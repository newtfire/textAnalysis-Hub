<lyrics>


<l>Ooh wee baby, goodness gracious,
the way I love you is contagious
Ooh wee baby, can't you see I'm in love with you

</l>
<l>So come on baby don't be stubborn,
just for you I got a little lovin'
Ooh wee baby, can't you see I'm in love with you

</l>
<l>Well your kisses taste so sweet,

they thrill me right off of my feet
I'd walk a mile just to see you smile
Thinking 'bout you nearly drives me wild


</l>
<l>Come on babe don't be stubborn,
just for you I got a little lovin'
Ooh wee baby, can't you see I'm in love with you

</l>
<l>Well your kisses taste so sweet,

they thrill me right off of my feet
I'd walk a mile just to see you smile
Thinking 'bout you nearly drives me wild


</l>
<l>Come on babe don't be stubborn,
just for you I got a little lovin'
Ooh wee baby, can't you see I'm in love with you

</l><l>Yes I'm so in love with you</l>
<l>Baby I'm so in love with you</l>
<l>Ooh wee baby, can't you see I'm in love with you</l></lyrics></xml>
