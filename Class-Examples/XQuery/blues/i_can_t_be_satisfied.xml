<lyrics>


<l>Well I'm goin' away to leave

</l>
<l>Won't be back no more

</l>
<l>Goin' back down south, child

</l>
<l>Don't you want to go?

</l>
<l>Woman I'm troubled, I be all worried in mind

</l>
<l>Well baby I just can't be satisfied

</l>
<l>And I just can't keep from cryin'



</l>
<l>Well I feel like snappin'

</l>
<l>Pistol in your face

</l>
<l>I'm gonna let some graveyard

</l>
<l>Lord be your resting place

</l>
<l>Woman I'm troubled, I be all worried in mind

</l>
<l>Well baby I can never be satisfied

</l>
<l>And I just can't keep from cryin'



</l>
<l>Well now all in my sleep

</l>
<l>Hear my doorbell ring

</l>
<l>Looking for my baby

</l>
<l>I couldn't see not a doggone thing

</l>
<l>Woman I was troubled, I was all worried in mind

</l>
<l>Well honey I could never be satisfied

</l>
<l>And I just couldn't keep from cryin'



</l>
<l>Well I know my little old baby

</l>
<l>She gonna jump and shout

</l>
<l>That old train be late man, Lord

</l>
<l>And I come walking out

</l>
<l>I be troubled, I be all worried in mind

</l>
<l>Well honey ain't no way in the world could we be satisfied

</l>
<l>And I just can't keep from crying



</l>

<note>Note: Muddy recorded this song for the Aristocrat label, the
forerunner of the famous Chess label, for the first time in April
1948. The song was created from two other songs Muddy recorded with
Alan Lomax in 1941/1942 on the Stovall plantation for the Library of
Congress, "
I Be's Troubled
" and "I Be
Bound To Write To You". The record, with "I Feel Like Going Home" on
the flip side, was in instant hit and the 3,000 78's sold out in
little over a day. The record rose tot the no. 11 position on both
the "Juke Box" and "Best Seller R&amp;B" charts. Muddy was 33 when he
finally broke through.</note></lyrics></xml>
