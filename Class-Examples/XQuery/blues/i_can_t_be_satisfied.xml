<lyrics>



Well I'm goin' away to leave

Won't be back no more

Goin' back down south, child

Don't you want to go?

Woman I'm troubled, I be all worried in mind

Well baby I just can't be satisfied

And I just can't keep from cryin'



Well I feel like snappin'

Pistol in your face

I'm gonna let some graveyard

Lord be your resting place

Woman I'm troubled, I be all worried in mind

Well baby I can never be satisfied

And I just can't keep from cryin'



Well now all in my sleep

Hear my doorbell ring

Looking for my baby

I couldn't see not a doggone thing

Woman I was troubled, I was all worried in mind

Well honey I could never be satisfied

And I just couldn't keep from cryin'



Well I know my little old baby

She gonna jump and shout

That old train be late man, Lord

And I come walking out

I be troubled, I be all worried in mind

Well honey ain't no way in the world could we be satisfied

And I just can't keep from crying

Note: Muddy recorded this song for the Aristocrat label, the
forerunner of the famous Chess label, for the first time in April
1948. The song was created from two other songs Muddy recorded with
Alan Lomax in 1941/1942 on the Stovall plantation for the Library of
Congress, "
I Be's Troubled
" and "I Be
Bound To Write To You". The record, with "I Feel Like Going Home" on
the flip side, was in instant hit and the 3,000 78's sold out in
little over a day. The record rose tot the no. 11 position on both
the "Juke Box" and "Best Seller R&amp;B" charts. Muddy was 33 when he
finally broke through.
