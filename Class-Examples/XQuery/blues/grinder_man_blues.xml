<lyrics>



My name is Memphis Slim, they call me the Grinder Man

My name is Memphis Slim, they call me the Grinder Man

If you be my customer, I'll let you have it on a easy plan



I do my ramblin' at midnight, and I don't be seen in the day

I do my ramblin' at midnight, I don't be seen in the day

While everything is quiet and easy, Mr. Grinder can have his way



I got so many customers, it takes me a week to get around

I got so many customers, it takes me a week to get around

But you need not be uneasy baby, Mr. Grinder won't let you down



If you wanna see me baby, you better see me while you can

You wanna see me baby, you had better see me while you can

Because I'm a very busy fella, you know they call me the Grinder
Man
