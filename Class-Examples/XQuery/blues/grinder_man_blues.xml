<lyrics>


<l>My name is Memphis Slim, they call me the Grinder Man

</l>
<l>My name is Memphis Slim, they call me the Grinder Man

</l>
<l>If you be my customer, I'll let you have it on a easy plan



</l>
<l>I do my ramblin' at midnight, and I don't be seen in the day

</l>
<l>I do my ramblin' at midnight, I don't be seen in the day

</l>
<l>While everything is quiet and easy, Mr. Grinder can have his way



</l>
<l>I got so many customers, it takes me a week to get around

</l>
<l>I got so many customers, it takes me a week to get around

</l>
<l>But you need not be uneasy baby, Mr. Grinder won't let you down



</l>
<l>If you wanna see me baby, you better see me while you can

</l>
<l>You wanna see me baby, you had better see me while you can

</l><l>Because I'm a very busy fella, you know they call me the Grinder</l>
<l>Man</l></lyrics></xml>
