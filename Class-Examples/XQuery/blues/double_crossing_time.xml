<lyrics>



It's a mean old scene when it comes to double crossing
time

It's a mean old scene when it comes to double crossing time

When you think you got good buddies, they will spin around and cheat
you blind



Double crossing man is mean, he will try to make it so you lose

Double crossing man, he will try to make it so you lose

You'll fill your mind with worry, you know he hurt me with the
blues
