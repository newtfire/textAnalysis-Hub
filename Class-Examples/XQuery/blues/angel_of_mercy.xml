<lyrics>


<l>Angel of mercy you don't need no golden wing

Angel of mercy you don't need no golden wing
The way you came to my rescue,
heaven must be watchin' over me


</l>
<l>When the shadows fallin' and the day turns into night,

I hear my angel callin' and I can't wait to see the light
Angel of mercy you don't need no golden wing
The way you came down to my rescue,
heaven must be watchin' over me


</l>
<l>Sometimes I get a feelin' like a fever comin' over me,
just a touch of my angels hand and I'm right back on my feet

</l>
<l>Angel of mercy you don't need no golden wing
The way you came down to my rescue,
heaven must be watchin' over me

</l>
<l>Stay with me baby, come down from the sky
Just like an angel, take me to paradise

</l><l>Angel of mercy you don't need no golden wing</l>
<l>The way you came down to my rescue,</l>
<l>heaven must be watchin' over me</l></lyrics></xml>
