<lyrics>





Angel of mercy you don't need no golden wing
Angel of mercy you don't need no golden wing
The way you came to my rescue,
heaven must be watchin' over me

When the shadows fallin' and the day turns into night,
I hear my angel callin' and I can't wait to see the light
Angel of mercy you don't need no golden wing
The way you came down to my rescue,
heaven must be watchin' over me

Sometimes I get a feelin' like a fever comin' over me,
just a touch of my angels hand and I'm right back on my feet

Angel of mercy you don't need no golden wing
The way you came down to my rescue,
heaven must be watchin' over me

Stay with me baby, come down from the sky
Just like an angel, take me to paradise

Angel of mercy you don't need no golden wing
The way you came down to my rescue,
heaven must be watchin' over me
