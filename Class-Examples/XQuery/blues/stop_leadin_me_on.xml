<lyrics>


<l>I know you don't love me no more

</l>
<l>You're not the kind that would tell me so

</l>
<l>Be a woman and talk to me

</l>
<l>That's the way I'd rather it be

</l>
<l>Feeling sorry for me in your own way

</l>
<l>You've got to hurt me by telling me one day

</l>
<l>So you get it over baby

</l>
<l>Please, stop leadin' me on



</l>
<l>You're miserable and I'm the cause

</l>
<l>Feeling sorry won't help you at all

</l>
<l>I hate to see you live this way

</l>
<l>So you go on baby, I'll make it someday

</l>
<l>Ah, yes, I know you don't love me no more

</l>
<l>Yes, you're not the kind that would tell me so

</l>
<l>Get it over baby

</l>
<l>Please, stop leadin' me on



</l>
<l>You are miserable and I'm the cause

</l>
<l>Feeling sorry won't help you at all

</l>
<l>I hate to see you living this way

</l>
<l>So you go on baby, I'll make it someday

</l>
<l>Yes, yes I know you don't love me no more

</l>
<l>You're not the kind that would tell me so

</l>
<l>So you go on baby

</l>
<l>Please, stop leadin' me on

</l>
<l>Please, stop leadin' me on

</l>
<l>Can you hear me baby

</l>
<l>Please, stop leadin' me on</l></lyrics></xml>
