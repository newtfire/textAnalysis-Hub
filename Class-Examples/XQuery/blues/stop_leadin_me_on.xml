<lyrics>



I know you don't love me no more

You're not the kind that would tell me so

Be a woman and talk to me

That's the way I'd rather it be

Feeling sorry for me in your own way

You've got to hurt me by telling me one day

So you get it over baby

Please, stop leadin' me on



You're miserable and I'm the cause

Feeling sorry won't help you at all

I hate to see you live this way

So you go on baby, I'll make it someday

Ah, yes, I know you don't love me no more

Yes, you're not the kind that would tell me so

Get it over baby

Please, stop leadin' me on



You are miserable and I'm the cause

Feeling sorry won't help you at all

I hate to see you living this way

So you go on baby, I'll make it someday

Yes, yes I know you don't love me no more

You're not the kind that would tell me so

So you go on baby

Please, stop leadin' me on

Please, stop leadin' me on

Can you hear me baby

Please, stop leadin' me on
