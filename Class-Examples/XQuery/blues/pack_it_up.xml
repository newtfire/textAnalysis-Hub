<lyrics>



My head is spinnin' around

And I'm thinkin' my thoughts of you

Whoa baby, I'm thinkin' about you

Well I get so mixed up now baby

And I don't know what to do

Oh baby, I don't know what to do



I'm gonna pack it up

I'm gonna give it up

I'm gonna put you right out of my mind

I'm gonna pack it up

Gonna give it up baby

I'm gonna put you right out of my mind



Hey I tried my best to understand

You keep sayin' it'll work out fine

But baby, don't look like it will

Every time I try to talk to you baby

You tell me you ain't got time

But baby, I don't know what's wrong with you



But let me tell you

I'm gonna pack it up

Gonna give it up woman

I'm gonna put you right out of my life

Hey, I'm gonna pack it up

Gonna give it up baby

Gonna put you right out of my life



After all we been through together

Why did it end this way

But baby, it did

I put all my trust in you baby

Believe every word I say

Oh baby, I love you so much



I'm gonna pack it up

Gonna give it up

I got to get you right out of my life

Hey I got to pack it up

Got to give it up baby

I have to get you right out of my life



Hey baby, listen to me baby

I got to get you right out of my mind

Baby tell you now

One of these day's, it won't be long

You'll look for me, I'll be gone, baby

Hey baby, listen to me baby

Whoa baby, I can put you down woman

Whoa Yeah
