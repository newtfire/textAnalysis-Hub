<lyrics>


<l>My head is spinnin' around

</l>
<l>And I'm thinkin' my thoughts of you

</l>
<l>Whoa baby, I'm thinkin' about you

</l>
<l>Well I get so mixed up now baby

</l>
<l>And I don't know what to do

</l>
<l>Oh baby, I don't know what to do



</l>
<l>I'm gonna pack it up

</l>
<l>I'm gonna give it up

</l>
<l>I'm gonna put you right out of my mind

</l>
<l>I'm gonna pack it up

</l>
<l>Gonna give it up baby

</l>
<l>I'm gonna put you right out of my mind



</l>
<l>Hey I tried my best to understand

</l>
<l>You keep sayin' it'll work out fine

</l>
<l>But baby, don't look like it will

</l>
<l>Every time I try to talk to you baby

</l>
<l>You tell me you ain't got time

</l>
<l>But baby, I don't know what's wrong with you



</l>
<l>But let me tell you

</l>
<l>I'm gonna pack it up

</l>
<l>Gonna give it up woman

</l>
<l>I'm gonna put you right out of my life

</l>
<l>Hey, I'm gonna pack it up

</l>
<l>Gonna give it up baby

</l>
<l>Gonna put you right out of my life



</l>
<l>After all we been through together

</l>
<l>Why did it end this way

</l>
<l>But baby, it did

</l>
<l>I put all my trust in you baby

</l>
<l>Believe every word I say

</l>
<l>Oh baby, I love you so much



</l>
<l>I'm gonna pack it up

</l>
<l>Gonna give it up

</l>
<l>I got to get you right out of my life

</l>
<l>Hey I got to pack it up

</l>
<l>Got to give it up baby

</l>
<l>I have to get you right out of my life



</l>
<l>Hey baby, listen to me baby

</l>
<l>I got to get you right out of my mind

</l>
<l>Baby tell you now

</l>
<l>One of these day's, it won't be long

</l>
<l>You'll look for me, I'll be gone, baby

</l>
<l>Hey baby, listen to me baby

</l>
<l>Whoa baby, I can put you down woman

</l>
<l>Whoa Yeah</l></lyrics></xml>
