<lyrics>



One night while sleeping in my bed I had a beautiful dream

That all the people of the world got together on the same
wavelength,

and began helping one another

Now in this dream, universal love was the theme of the day

Peace and understanding and it happened this way



The sick, the hungry, had smiles on their faces,

the tired and the homeless had family all around

The streets and the cities were all beautiful places,

and the walls came tumblin' down



People of the world all had it together,

had it together for the boys and the girls

And the children of the world look forward to a future

Remember

Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock people, time's tickin' away

Remember that

Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock people, time's tickin' away



I had a vision of blue skies from sea to shining sea,

all the trees in the forest stood strong and tall again

Everything was clean and pretty and safe for you and me,

the worst of enemies became the best of friends



People of the world all had it together,

had it together for the boys and the girls

Children of the world look forward to a future



Remember

Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock people, time's tickin' away

Remember that

Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock people, time's tickin' away



Remember that, remember that

Remember that, remember that



People of the world all had it together,

had it together for the boys and the girls

Children of the world look forward to a future



Remember

Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock people, time's tickin' away

Remember that

Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock people, time's tickin' away
