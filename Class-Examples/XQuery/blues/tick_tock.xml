<lyrics>


<l>One night while sleeping in my bed I had a beautiful dream

</l>
<l>That all the people of the world got together on the same
wavelength,

</l>
<l>and began helping one another

</l>
<l>Now in this dream, universal love was the theme of the day

</l>
<l>Peace and understanding and it happened this way



</l>
<l>The sick, the hungry, had smiles on their faces,

</l>
<l>the tired and the homeless had family all around

</l>
<l>The streets and the cities were all beautiful places,

</l>
<l>and the walls came tumblin' down



</l>
<l>People of the world all had it together,

</l>
<l>had it together for the boys and the girls

</l>
<l>And the children of the world look forward to a future

</l>
<l>Remember

</l>
<l>Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock people, time's tickin' away

</l>
<l>Remember that

</l>
<l>Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock people, time's tickin' away



</l>
<l>I had a vision of blue skies from sea to shining sea,

</l>
<l>all the trees in the forest stood strong and tall again

</l>
<l>Everything was clean and pretty and safe for you and me,

</l>
<l>the worst of enemies became the best of friends



</l>
<l>People of the world all had it together,

</l>
<l>had it together for the boys and the girls

</l>
<l>Children of the world look forward to a future



</l>
<l>Remember

</l>
<l>Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock people, time's tickin' away

</l>
<l>Remember that

</l>
<l>Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock people, time's tickin' away



</l>
<l>Remember that, remember that

</l>
<l>Remember that, remember that



</l>
<l>People of the world all had it together,

</l>
<l>had it together for the boys and the girls

</l>
<l>Children of the world look forward to a future



</l>
<l>Remember

</l>
<l>Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock people, time's tickin' away

</l>
<l>Remember that

</l><l>Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock people, time's tickin' away</l></lyrics></xml>
