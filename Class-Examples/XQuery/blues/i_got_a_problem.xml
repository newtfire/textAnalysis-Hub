<lyrics>

<l>I've got a problem, I say I got a problem

</l>
<l>I got a problem people, I've got a problem

</l>
<l>I got a problem 'bout my woman

</l>
<l>I got a problem 'bout my wife



</l>
<l>An' all you, when you see me stand here, two's in my
life
1

</l>
<l>I know you might be wonderin', did I wreck my life?

</l>
<l>Well, I got a problem 'bout my woman, ha!

</l>
<l>I got a problem 'bout my wife



</l>
<l>Now my wife is number one, my woman is number two

</l>
<l>My woman would do things for me, that my wife wouldn't do

</l>
<l>'Cause I dig my wife, but you understand

</l>
<l>Sometime it takes two ya'all, to satisfy one man



</l>
<l>My problem started out

</l>
<l>When I started messin' 'round with number three

</l>
<l>She called up my wife, an' told on my woman an' me

</l>
<l>Now my wife packed up her clothes

</l>
<l>Went home to her mother

</l>
<l>My woman went off, an' found another lover



</l>
<l>I've got a problem, uh, huh!

</l>
<l>I got a problem with my wife

</l>
<l>Got a problem with my woman, yeah

</l>
<l>Got a problem with my wife (talk, talk, talk)

<note>Note 1: two's in my life, the transcriber, Anita Cantor, wrote: "Well
I give up on line 5!. I mean, I could go on the next month changing
it... 'tears in my eye' sounds like what it 
should
 be. But he
starts the word with "L" but he uses the word 'life' in the next
line. So it looks wrong but I think it's right. Maybe the whole line
is wrong, but if someone wants to correct it, they can be my guest!".
The invitation still stands
