<lyrics>


<l>When I saw you this morning, baby, tell me why did you walk away

</l>
<l>When I saw you this morning, baby, tell me why did you walk away

</l>
<l>I can't believe that you don't want me, I thought our love was here

to stay




</l>
<l>Buzz me, buzz me, buzz me, baby, I'll be waiting for your call

</l>
<l>Buzz me, buzz me, buzz me, baby, I'll be waiting for your call

</l>
<l>But if you forgot the number, come on over, you won't have to call at

all




</l>
<l>I never lied to no one, I ain't gonna lie to you

</l>
<l>When I say I'm yours forever, every word I say is true

</l>
<l>Buzz me, baby, I'll be waiting for your call

</l>
<l>But if you forgot the number, come on over, and you won't have to

call at all




</l>
<l>Buzz me, buzz me, baby, you mean so awfully much to me

</l>
<l>Buzz me, buzz me, baby, I'm just like a ship that's lost at sea

</l>
<l>But when I get my arm around you, ain't gonna let go till 2003</l></lyrics></xml>
