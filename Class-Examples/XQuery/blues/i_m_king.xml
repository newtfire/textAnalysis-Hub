<lyrics>


<l>I've been around the world, seen everything

</l>
<l>And if it's love you want baby just give me a ring

</l>
<l>I can't lose with the stuff I use

</l>
<l>I'm the king of the blues



</l>
<l>I've loved in sunshine, I've loved in the rain

</l>
<l>All of the women who know me call that loving man

</l>
<l>I can't lose with the stuff I use

</l>
<l>I'm the king of the blues



</l>
<l>Some people go to school to try and learn their trade

</l>
<l>Yes, but I'm a lover, a lover by nature

</l>
<l>That's why I know, I know, I know I've got it made



</l>
<l>Yes, you might think I'm jokin' or just havin' fun

</l>
<l>But they tell me the reason I'm the king

</l>
<l>I'm a lovin' son of a gun

</l>
<l>I can't lose with the stuff I use

</l>
<l>I'm the king of the blues</l></lyrics></xml>
