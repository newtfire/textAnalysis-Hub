<lyrics>



I've been around the world, seen everything

And if it's love you want baby just give me a ring

I can't lose with the stuff I use

I'm the king of the blues



I've loved in sunshine, I've loved in the rain

All of the women who know me call that loving man

I can't lose with the stuff I use

I'm the king of the blues



Some people go to school to try and learn their trade

Yes, but I'm a lover, a lover by nature

That's why I know, I know, I know I've got it made



Yes, you might think I'm jokin' or just havin' fun

But they tell me the reason I'm the king

I'm a lovin' son of a gun

I can't lose with the stuff I use

I'm the king of the blues
