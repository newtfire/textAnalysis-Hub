<lyrics>



Well now now darlin' may a have a little talk with you

Well now now now now darlin may a have a little talk with you

Because it won't be long before our true love will be through



Well now now now darlin' am I right or am I wrong

Yeah now now now darlin' am I right or am I wrong

Because it won't be long before our true love will be through



You know I like my coffee sweet in the morning

and I'm crazy about my tea at night

Yeah I like my coffee sweet in the morning

and I'm crazy about my tea at night

You know you'd come out a little better now baby,

all I want you to do is treat me right
