<lyrics>



I know little gal, you gon' miss me

I know, darlin' you gon' cry

When it's all over, you might wanna die-i



I know, gonna have tears in your eye-eyes

You'll be lonely an really won't know why-i

When it's all over, you might wanna die-i



When you left me little girl, you only hurt yourself

When you left me darlin', you only hurt yourself

But now it's all over, there's nothin' else left

Ooh



Woman! Woman! Woman! Woman!



Oh! Hey! Yeah! Oh!



I know little gal, gonna have tears in your eye-eyes

You'll be lonely, woman, but you won't know why

But when it's all over, you might wanna cry



Now listen girl



When you left me now, you know you hurt yourself (real bad!)

When you walked out on me little gal, only hurt yourself

But now it's all over woman, there's nothing else left



Ooh, Look out gal!



Woman! woman! woman! woman!

Fading:

Woman! woman!
