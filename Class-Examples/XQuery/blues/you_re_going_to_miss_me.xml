<lyrics>


<l>I know little gal, you gon' miss me

</l>
<l>I know, darlin' you gon' cry

</l>
<l>When it's all over, you might wanna die-i



</l>
<l>I know, gonna have tears in your eye-eyes

</l>
<l>You'll be lonely an really won't know why-i

</l>
<l>When it's all over, you might wanna die-i



</l>
<l>When you left me little girl, you only hurt yourself

</l>
<l>When you left me darlin', you only hurt yourself

</l>
<l>But now it's all over, there's nothin' else left

</l>
<l>Ooh



</l>
<l>Woman! Woman! Woman! Woman!



</l>
<l>Oh! Hey! Yeah! Oh!



</l>
<l>I know little gal, gonna have tears in your eye-eyes

</l>
<l>You'll be lonely, woman, but you won't know why

</l>
<l>But when it's all over, you might wanna cry



</l>
<l>Now listen girl



</l>
<l>When you left me now, you know you hurt yourself (real bad!)

</l>
<l>When you walked out on me little gal, only hurt yourself

</l>
<l>But now it's all over woman, there's nothing else left



</l>
<l>Ooh, Look out gal!



</l>
<l>Woman! woman! woman! woman!

</l>
<l>Fading:

</l>
<l>Woman! woman!
