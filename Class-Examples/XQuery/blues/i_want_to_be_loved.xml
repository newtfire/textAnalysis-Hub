<lyrics>


<l>The spark in your eye sets my, soul on fire,

</l>
<l>your voice is like a, angel above

</l>
<l>The touch of your hand woman, drives me insane,

</l>
<l>but baby, I want's to be loved



</l>
<l>I'm crazy 'bout every little, thing you do,

</l>
<l>I even, cherish your hug

</l>
<l>Your kisses so sweet honey they, can't be beat,

</l>
<l>but baby I want's to be loved



</l>
<l>Every time I ask ya, for a date,

</l>
<l>you don't come at all or your, oh so late

</l>
<l>I ask you to dance a, little spin,

</l>
<l>you said wait a minute daddy, here come my friend



</l>
<l>I love the way you walk when you, pass me by,

</l>
<l>even when you, tryin' to snub

</l>
<l>The touch of your hand honey, drives me insane,

</l>
<l>but baby I want's to be loved</l></lyrics></xml>
