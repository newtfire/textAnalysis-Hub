<lyrics>



The spark in your eye sets my, soul on fire,

your voice is like a, angel above

The touch of your hand woman, drives me insane,

but baby, I want's to be loved



I'm crazy 'bout every little, thing you do,

I even, cherish your hug

Your kisses so sweet honey they, can't be beat,

but baby I want's to be loved



Every time I ask ya, for a date,

you don't come at all or your, oh so late

I ask you to dance a, little spin,

you said wait a minute daddy, here come my friend



I love the way you walk when you, pass me by,

even when you, tryin' to snub

The touch of your hand honey, drives me insane,

but baby I want's to be loved
