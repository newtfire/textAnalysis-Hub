<lyrics>


<l>Turn out the light, sleep won't come

</l>
<l>I think about what's going wrong

</l>
<l>Lying so close, so alone

</l>
<l>Please turn to me, I'm almost gone



</l>
<l>Hold on, I feel our love is changing

</l>
<l>Hold on, please don't let me disappear

</l>
<l>Hold on, there's time to rearrange things

</l>
<l>Hold on, I'm not me without you here



</l>
<l>Put out your hand, touch desire

</l>
<l>Where there's a spark, could be a fire

</l>
<l>Open your arms, let me see

</l>
<l>If there's still love in you for me



</l>
<l>Hold on, I feel our love is changing

</l>
<l>Hold on, please don't let me disappear

</l>
<l>Hold on, there's time to rearrange things

</l>
<l>Hold on, I'm not me without you here</l></lyrics></xml>
