<lyrics>



Good mornin' 'lil school girl,

can I go home, can I go home with you?

Tell your mother and your father,

I'm a little school boy too



Woke up this mornin',

woke up this mornin',

I didn't know what to,

I didn't know what to do

I didn't have no blues,

baby, bit I couldn't be satisfied



I'm gettin' me an airplane,

I'm gettin' me an airplane,

get in my airplane

Gon' fly all oh-oh, gon' fly all over this land

I'm gonna find my little school girl,

find her in the world somewhere



Good mornin' 'lil school girl,

good mornin' 'lil school girl

Can I go home with, can I go home with,

can I go home with you?

Tell your mother and your father,

Johnny little school boy too



Come be my baby, come be my baby,

I buy you a diamond, I buy you a diamond ring

You don't be my little baby,

I ain't gonna buy you a 
doggone

ring
