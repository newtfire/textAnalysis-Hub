<l>Good mornin' 'lil school girl,

</l>
<l>can I go home, can I go home with you?

</l>
<l>Tell your mother and your father,

</l>
<l>I'm a little school boy too



</l>
<l>Woke up this mornin',

</l>
<l>woke up this mornin',

</l>
<l>I didn't know what to,

</l>
<l>I didn't know what to do

</l>
<l>I didn't have no blues,

</l>
<l>baby, bit I couldn't be satisfied



</l>
<l>I'm gettin' me an airplane,

</l>
<l>I'm gettin' me an airplane,

</l>
<l>get in my airplane

</l>
<l>Gon' fly all oh-oh, gon' fly all over this land

</l>
<l>I'm gonna find my little school girl,

</l>
<l>find her in the world somewhere



</l>
<l>Good mornin' 'lil school girl,

</l>
<l>good mornin' 'lil school girl

</l>
<l>Can I go home with, can I go home with,

</l>
<l>can I go home with you?

</l>
<l>Tell your mother and your father,

</l>
<l>Johnny little school boy too



</l>
<l>Come be my baby, come be my baby,

</l>
<l>I buy you a diamond, I buy you a diamond ring

</l>
<l>You don't be my little baby,

</l>
<l>I ain't gonna buy you a 
doggone

</l>
<l>ring</l></lyrics></xml>
