Help the poor

Won't you help poor me

I need help from you baby

Need it desperately

I need you so much

I need your care

Need all the loving baby you can spare

Help the poor

Oh, baby won't you help poor me



Say you will

Say you'll help me on

I can't make it no longer

In this world alone

Baby I'm beggin' with tears in my eyes

For your love don't you realize

I need help

Oh baby help poor me



You are my inspiration

Baby that's makes be a king

But if you don't come to my rescue

I couldn't ever be anything



Help the poor

Won't you help poor me

Have a heart won't you baby

Listen to my plead

Oh I lost my courage till I found you

You got what it takes baby

To pull me through

Help the poor

Oh baby won't you help poor me



You are my inspiration

Baby that's makes be a king

But if you don't come to my rescue

I couldn't ever be anything



Help the poor

Won't you help poor me

Have a heart won't you baby

Listen to my plead

Oh I lost my courage till I found you

You got what it takes baby

To pull me through

Help the poor

Oh baby won't you help poor me
