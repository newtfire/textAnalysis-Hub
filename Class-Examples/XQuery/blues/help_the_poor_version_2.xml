<l>Help the poor

</l>
<l>Won't you help poor me

</l>
<l>I need help from you baby

</l>
<l>Need it desperately

</l>
<l>I need you so much

</l>
<l>I need your care

</l>
<l>Need all the loving baby you can spare

</l>
<l>Help the poor

</l>
<l>Oh, baby won't you help poor me



</l>
<l>Say you will

</l>
<l>Say you'll help me on

</l>
<l>I can't make it no longer

</l>
<l>In this world alone

</l>
<l>Baby I'm beggin' with tears in my eyes

</l>
<l>For your love don't you realize

</l>
<l>I need help

</l>
<l>Oh baby help poor me



</l>
<l>You are my inspiration

</l>
<l>Baby that's makes be a king

</l>
<l>But if you don't come to my rescue

</l>
<l>I couldn't ever be anything



</l>
<l>Help the poor

</l>
<l>Won't you help poor me

</l>
<l>Have a heart won't you baby

</l>
<l>Listen to my plead

</l>
<l>Oh I lost my courage till I found you

</l>
<l>You got what it takes baby

</l>
<l>To pull me through

</l>
<l>Help the poor

</l>
<l>Oh baby won't you help poor me



</l>
<l>You are my inspiration

</l>
<l>Baby that's makes be a king

</l>
<l>But if you don't come to my rescue

</l>
<l>I couldn't ever be anything



</l>
<l>Help the poor

</l>
<l>Won't you help poor me

</l>
<l>Have a heart won't you baby

</l>
<l>Listen to my plead

</l>
<l>Oh I lost my courage till I found you

</l>
<l>You got what it takes baby

</l>
<l>To pull me through

</l>
<l>Help the poor

</l><l>Oh baby won't you help poor me</l></lyrics></xml>
