<lyrics>



Well, if we live, we gotta grow old baby

And I know just how you're going to be

Well, your feet are already a little chilly baby

And you're gettin' a little cold to me



Well, you're gonna have a sweet and silly temper, baby

Baby, and you're not gonna speak to me for days at a time

Oh, I know you're gonna have a sweet and silly temper, baby

Baby, and you won't speak to me for days at a time

Oh baby, I know you're gettin' old

And your little temper B. won't really mind



Oh, we'll be sittin' close together baby

And our minds are really in tune

Oh, we'll be sittin' close together baby

And our minds are really in tune

Well, we'll start makin' love together, baby

Thinkin' about how we used to when we was really in bloom



Oh, I know you're gonna live like a king and queen

Baby you won't mind a word I say

I know you're gonna live like a king and queen

Baby you won't mind a word I say

Yeah, we're gonna live and get old together, baby

Yeah, 'till we old and grey
