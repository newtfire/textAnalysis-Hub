<lyrics>


<l>Well, if we live, we gotta grow old baby

</l>
<l>And I know just how you're going to be

</l>
<l>Well, your feet are already a little chilly baby

</l>
<l>And you're gettin' a little cold to me



</l>
<l>Well, you're gonna have a sweet and silly temper, baby

</l>
<l>Baby, and you're not gonna speak to me for days at a time

</l>
<l>Oh, I know you're gonna have a sweet and silly temper, baby

</l>
<l>Baby, and you won't speak to me for days at a time

</l>
<l>Oh baby, I know you're gettin' old

</l>
<l>And your little temper B. won't really mind



</l>
<l>Oh, we'll be sittin' close together baby

</l>
<l>And our minds are really in tune

</l>
<l>Oh, we'll be sittin' close together baby

</l>
<l>And our minds are really in tune

</l>
<l>Well, we'll start makin' love together, baby

</l>
<l>Thinkin' about how we used to when we was really in bloom



</l>
<l>Oh, I know you're gonna live like a king and queen

</l>
<l>Baby you won't mind a word I say

</l>
<l>I know you're gonna live like a king and queen

</l>
<l>Baby you won't mind a word I say

</l>
<l>Yeah, we're gonna live and get old together, baby

</l>
<l>Yeah, 'till we old and grey</l></lyrics></xml>
