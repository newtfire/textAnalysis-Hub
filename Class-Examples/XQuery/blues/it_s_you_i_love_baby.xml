<lyrics>



Don't'cha know,

don't'cha know,

I love you ev'ry night

Don't'cha know, baby,

don't'cha know babe

I love you, no matter what they say

I still love you,

I still care,

I don't care what the world say,

but I still love you

I still, I still,

I still love you



I still, I still

Care for my baby

No matter what they say

What they do

I still love you



I still, I still

Care for your baby

No matter what you do, what they say

You still my baby

You still my baby

Little baby

Little baby

Little baby

Hmm, hmm
