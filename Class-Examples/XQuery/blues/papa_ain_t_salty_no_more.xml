<l>Come home little girl, your papa ain't 
salty

</l>
<l>no more

</l>
<l>Come home little girl, your papa ain't salty no more

</l>
<l>I need your love, and I swear I miss you so



</l>
<l>I know I was wrong, and I know I've caused you pains

</l>
<l>I know I was wrong, and I know I've caused you pains

</l>
<l>I'm sorry pretty baby, I won't do that again



</l>
<l>Why, oh why pretty baby, why did you have to go

</l>
<l>Please come back home pretty mama

</l>
<l>Papa ain't salty no more</l></lyrics></xml>
