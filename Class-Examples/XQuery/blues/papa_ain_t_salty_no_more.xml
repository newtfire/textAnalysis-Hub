<lyrics>



Come home little girl, your papa ain't 
salty

no more

Come home little girl, your papa ain't salty no more

I need your love, and I swear I miss you so



I know I was wrong, and I know I've caused you pains

I know I was wrong, and I know I've caused you pains

I'm sorry pretty baby, I won't do that again



Why, oh why pretty baby, why did you have to go

Please come back home pretty mama

Papa ain't salty no more
