<l>Since this recession I'm losing my baby,

</l>
<l>because the times are getting so hard

</l>
<l>Yes, since this recession I'm losing my baby,

</l>
<l>because the times are getting so hard

</l>
<l>Yes, I have to stop running around,

</l>
<l>man, you know it's breaking my heart



</l>
<l>Yes, I can't afford no liquor,

</l>
<l>all I can buy is beer and wine

</l>
<l>Yes, I can't afford no liquor people,

</l>
<l>all I can buy is beer and wine

</l>
<l>Well I can get my baby what she wants,

</l>
<l>and she stays cross al the time, yes help me



</l>
<l>Yes, please somebody,

</l>
<l>please go out to Washington for me

</l>
