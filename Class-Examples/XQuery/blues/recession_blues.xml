<lyrics>



Since this recession I'm losing my baby,

because the times are getting so hard

Yes, since this recession I'm losing my baby,

because the times are getting so hard

Yes, I have to stop running around,

man, you know it's breaking my heart



Yes, I can't afford no liquor,

all I can buy is beer and wine

Yes, I can't afford no liquor people,

all I can buy is beer and wine

Well I can get my baby what she wants,

and she stays cross al the time, yes help me



Yes, please somebody,

please go out to Washington for me

Yes, please, please somebody,

please go out to Washington for me

Yes, think about us out here

help me get out of this misery
