<lyrics>


<l>Now you may be sweet little woman

</l>
<l>As the apple on a tree

</l>
<l>Don't want no woman to lay up

</l>
<l>And depend on me



</l>
<l>You got to help me some

</l>
<l>Yes, you've got to help me some

</l>
<l>Don't care what I do

</l>
<l>Babe you've got to help me some



</l>
<l>Now if I'm the Pullman porter, girl

</l>
<l>You've got to be the maid

</l>
<l>So when every Saturday come

</l>
<l>We both can get paid



</l>
<l>So you can help me some

</l>
<l>Yes, I want you to help me some

</l>
<l>I don't care what I do

</l>
<l>Babe, you've got to help me some



</l>
<l>Now when I go to bed little girl

</l>
<l>And lay up beside-a you

</l>
<l>Now if I shake the cover

</l>
<l>Please try to shake it too



</l>
<l>So you can help me some

</l>
<l>Yes, I want you to help me some

</l>
<l>And I don't care what I do

</l>
<l>Babe you've got to help me some



</l>
<l>Help me some little girl, help me some!

</l>
<l>Now don't stand there and look at me like that,

</l>
<l>C'mon and help me some!

</l>
<l>Now that's better, yes, yes, yes, yes



</l>
<l>Now there's no such thing as man and wife

</l>
<l>Now-a-day

</l>
<l>We're just called partners

</l>
<l>So you can knock yourself a slave



</l>
<l>So you can help me some

</l>
<l>Yes, I want you to help me some

</l>
<l>I don't care what I do

</l>
<l>Babe, you've got to help me some</l></lyrics></xml>
