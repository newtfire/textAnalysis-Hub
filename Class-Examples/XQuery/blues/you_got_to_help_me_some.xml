<lyrics>



Now you may be sweet little woman

As the apple on a tree

Don't want no woman to lay up

And depend on me



You got to help me some

Yes, you've got to help me some

Don't care what I do

Babe you've got to help me some



Now if I'm the Pullman porter, girl

You've got to be the maid

So when every Saturday come

We both can get paid



So you can help me some

Yes, I want you to help me some

I don't care what I do

Babe, you've got to help me some



Now when I go to bed little girl

And lay up beside-a you

Now if I shake the cover

Please try to shake it too



So you can help me some

Yes, I want you to help me some

And I don't care what I do

Babe you've got to help me some



Help me some little girl, help me some!

Now don't stand there and look at me like that,

C'mon and help me some!

Now that's better, yes, yes, yes, yes



Now there's no such thing as man and wife

Now-a-day

We're just called partners

So you can knock yourself a slave



So you can help me some

Yes, I want you to help me some

I don't care what I do

Babe, you've got to help me some
