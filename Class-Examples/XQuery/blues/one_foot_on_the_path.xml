<lyrics>


<l>You say, "Come over baby, come talk to me"

</l>
<l>Then you drive me so crazy,

</l>
<l>I can't hardly see

</l>
<l>If this keeps goin' on,

</l>
<l>I might just leave and not come back

</l>
<l>I got one foot in your doorway,

</l>
<l>I got one foot on the path



</l>
<l>Well you beg me to stay,

</l>
<l>then you order me to go

</l>
<l>All this up and down,

</l>
<l>is wear and tear on my soul

</l>
<l>I'm wonderin' if our future,

</l>
<l>is gonna look just like our past

</l>
<l>I got one foot in your doorway,

</l>
<l>I got one foot on the path



</l>
<l>Now I love you, baby,

</l>
<l>don't get me wrong

</l>
<l>But this heart of mine,

</l>
<l>may not be that strong

</l>
<l>You got me on your line,

</l>
<l>reel me in or throw me back

</l>
<l>I got one foot in your doorway,

</l>
<l>I got on foot on the path



</l>
<l>You'd best thing about it, baby,

</l>
<l>but don't take too long

</l>
<l>If we can't get it right,

</l>
<l>I'll just be movin' on

</l>
<l>I can't wait forever,

</l>
<l>for us to get this thing on track

</l>
<l>I got one foot in your doorway, baby,

</l>
<l>I got on foot on the path</l></lyrics></xml>
