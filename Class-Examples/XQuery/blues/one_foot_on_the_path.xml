<lyrics>



You say, "Come over baby, come talk to me"

Then you drive me so crazy,

I can't hardly see

If this keeps goin' on,

I might just leave and not come back

I got one foot in your doorway,

I got one foot on the path



Well you beg me to stay,

then you order me to go

All this up and down,

is wear and tear on my soul

I'm wonderin' if our future,

is gonna look just like our past

I got one foot in your doorway,

I got one foot on the path



Now I love you, baby,

don't get me wrong

But this heart of mine,

may not be that strong

You got me on your line,

reel me in or throw me back

I got one foot in your doorway,

I got on foot on the path



You'd best thing about it, baby,

but don't take too long

If we can't get it right,

I'll just be movin' on

I can't wait forever,

for us to get this thing on track

I got one foot in your doorway, baby,

I got on foot on the path
