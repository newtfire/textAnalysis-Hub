<lyrics>


<l>Well I get up in the morning,

</l>
<l>kick the covers from my bed

</l>
<l>The sunlight in my eyes,

</l>
<l>playin' tricks on my head

</l>
<l>I work like a dog,

</l>
<l>on the job every day

</l>
<l>Tryin' to make some money,

</l>
<l>so I can go and play



</l>
<l>In the night time,

</l>
<l>oh, that's the right time

</l>
<l>I say the night time,

</l>
<l>that's the right time

</l>
<l>I wanna be with you,

</l>
<l>in the night time



</l>
<l>Well I come home from work,

</l>
<l>you know I'm tired of the beat

</l>
<l>I try to make some supper,

</l>
<l>get myself something to eat

</l>
<l>I jump in the shower,

</l>
<l>wash the world off my back

</l>
<l>I'm gonna get you baby,

</l>
<l>that's a natural fact



</l>
<l>In the night time,

</l>
<l>oh, that's the right time

</l>
<l>I say the night time,

</l>
<l>that's the right time

</l>
<l>I wanna be with you,

</l>
<l>in the night time



</l>
<l>Ah, come here baby,

</l>
<l>got your radio turned down too low

</l>
<l>Turn it up so you can hear what I'm saying baby,

</l>
<l>now you got me turned on baby



</l>
<l>Well eight hundred million people,

</l>
<l>with nothing to say

</l>
<l>They run around in circles,

</l>
<l>they just living the day

</l>
<l>Stick with me baby,

</l>
<l>I'll show you how to fly

</l>
<l>We'll make some pretty music,

</l>
<l>watch the world go by



</l>
<l>In the night time,

</l>
<l>oh, that's the right time

</l>
<l>I say the night time,

</l>
<l>that's the right time

</l>
<l>I wanna be with you,

</l>
<l>in the night time</l></lyrics></xml>
