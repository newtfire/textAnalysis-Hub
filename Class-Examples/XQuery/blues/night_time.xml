<lyrics>



Well I get up in the morning,

kick the covers from my bed

The sunlight in my eyes,

playin' tricks on my head

I work like a dog,

on the job every day

Tryin' to make some money,

so I can go and play



In the night time,

oh, that's the right time

I say the night time,

that's the right time

I wanna be with you,

in the night time



Well I come home from work,

you know I'm tired of the beat

I try to make some supper,

get myself something to eat

I jump in the shower,

wash the world off my back

I'm gonna get you baby,

that's a natural fact



In the night time,

oh, that's the right time

I say the night time,

that's the right time

I wanna be with you,

in the night time



Ah, come here baby,

got your radio turned down too low

Turn it up so you can hear what I'm saying baby,

now you got me turned on baby



Well eight hundred million people,

with nothing to say

They run around in circles,

they just living the day

Stick with me baby,

I'll show you how to fly

We'll make some pretty music,

watch the world go by



In the night time,

oh, that's the right time

I say the night time,

that's the right time

I wanna be with you,

in the night time
