<lyrics>



I got a sweet little angel, I love the way she spread her
wings

Yes, I got a sweet little angel, I love the way she spread her
wings

Yes, when she spread her wings around me, I get joy in everything



You know I asked my baby for a nickel, and she gave me a twenty
dollar bill

Oh, yes, I asked my baby for a nickel, and she gave me a twenty
dollar bill

Whoa, you know I asked her for a little drink of liquor, and she gave
me a whiskey still'
1



Ah yes, asked my baby to quit me, well, I do believe I will die

Yes, I asked my baby to quit me, well, I do believe I will die

'Cause, if you don't love me little angel, please, tell me the reason
why



__________

Note 1: still', liquor distillery.
