<lyrics>

<l>I got a sweet little angel, I love the way she spread her
wings

</l>
<l>Yes, I got a sweet little angel, I love the way she spread her
wings

</l>
<l>Yes, when she spread her wings around me, I get joy in everything



</l>
<l>You know I asked my baby for a nickel, and she gave me a twenty
dollar bill

</l>
<l>Oh, yes, I asked my baby for a nickel, and she gave me a twenty
dollar bill

</l>
<l>Whoa, you know I asked her for a little drink of liquor, and she gave
me a whiskey still'
1



</l>
<l>Ah yes, asked my baby to quit me, well, I do believe I will die

</l>
<l>Yes, I asked my baby to quit me, well, I do believe I will die

</l>
<l>'Cause, if you don't love me little angel, please, tell me the reason
why
