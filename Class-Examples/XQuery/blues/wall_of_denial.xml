<lyrics>


<l>A wall of denial, is fallin' down

</l>
<l>Wo it's fallin' so hard, own to the ground

</l>
<l>Never knew something so strong could be washed away by tears,

</l>
<l>but this wall of denial was just built on fear



</l>
<l>We've all had our demons from the garden of white lies,

</l>
<l>dressed them amused them pullin' wool over our eyes

</l>
<l>Go so far as to love them to keep from letting them go,

</l>
<l>all the while they we're killin' us but we couldn't let it show



</l>
<l>No matter what the trouble we carry round inside,

</l>
<l>we're never safe from the truth but in the truth we can survive

</l>
<l>When this wall of denial comes tumblin' down,

</l>
<l>down to the ground



</l>
<l>Simple things in life bring the greatest pleasure,

</l>
<l>a smile, a kiss, a little baby's laughter

</l>
<l>It makes no difference if we run away in fear,

</l>
<l>the little things in life hold us so near



</l>
<l>No matter what the trouble we carry round inside,

</l>
<l>we're never safe from the truth but in the truth we can survive

</l>
<l>When this wall of denial comes tumblin' down

</l>
<l>Yeah, this wall of denial must tumble down

</l>
<l>Down to the ground</l></lyrics></xml>
