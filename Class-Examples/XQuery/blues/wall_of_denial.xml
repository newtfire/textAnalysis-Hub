<lyrics>



A wall of denial, is fallin' down

Wo it's fallin' so hard, own to the ground

Never knew something so strong could be washed away by tears,

but this wall of denial was just built on fear



We've all had our demons from the garden of white lies,

dressed them amused them pullin' wool over our eyes

Go so far as to love them to keep from letting them go,

all the while they we're killin' us but we couldn't let it show



No matter what the trouble we carry round inside,

we're never safe from the truth but in the truth we can survive

When this wall of denial comes tumblin' down,

down to the ground



Simple things in life bring the greatest pleasure,

a smile, a kiss, a little baby's laughter

It makes no difference if we run away in fear,

the little things in life hold us so near



No matter what the trouble we carry round inside,

we're never safe from the truth but in the truth we can survive

When this wall of denial comes tumblin' down

Yeah, this wall of denial must tumble down

Down to the ground
