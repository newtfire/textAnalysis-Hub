<lyrics>



I'm a pawnbroker, what do you want on your ring

I'm a pawnbroker, what do you want on your ring

See like every woman I loaned, they want the same old thing



Have to use my tester and see if will stand the test

Have to use my tester and see if will stand the test

Yes, I'm a pawnbroker, don't have nothing but the best



18 carat is o.k., but 14 carat will make the grade

18 carat is o.k., but 14 carat will make the grade

Yes, I'm a ring pawnbroker, don't have nothing but the best that's
made



Yes, I'm a payin' pawnbroker, I pay the best price in town

Yes, I'm a payin' pawnbroker, I pay the best price in town

Well, if you don't believe me, baby, just lay your ring down



Yes, you may need money, baby, on your ring some day

Yes, you may need money, baby, on your ring some day

Well, you can't ever tell, what bad luck may come your way
