<l>I'm a pawnbroker, what do you want on your ring

</l>
<l>I'm a pawnbroker, what do you want on your ring

</l>
<l>See like every woman I loaned, they want the same old thing



</l>
<l>Have to use my tester and see if will stand the test

</l>
<l>Have to use my tester and see if will stand the test

</l>
<l>Yes, I'm a pawnbroker, don't have nothing but the best



</l>
<l>18 carat is o.k., but 14 carat will make the grade

</l>
<l>18 carat is o.k., but 14 carat will make the grade

</l>
<l>Yes, I'm a ring pawnbroker, don't have nothing but the best that's

made




</l>
<l>Yes, I'm a payin' pawnbroker, I pay the best price in town

</l>
<l>Yes, I'm a payin' pawnbroker, I pay the best price in town

</l>
<l>Well, if you don't believe me, baby, just lay your ring down



</l>
<l>Yes, you may need money, baby, on your ring some day

</l>
<l>Yes, you may need money, baby, on your ring some day

</l>
<l>Well, you can't ever tell, what bad luck may come your way</l></lyrics></xml>
