<lyrics>


<l>Been playin' blues all-a my life

</l>
<l>Always have been that way

</l>
<l>But I've a got tired of these bills comin' in

</l>
<l>And I don't have the money to pay



</l>
<l>That is why, I gotta put it down

</l>
<l>So I'm gonna tell ya again

</l>
<l>It's gonna be my last time around



</l>
<l>Well please don't try to tell me

</l>
<l>'Bout all the money I made

</l>
<l>Last night I went out an' I played all night

</l>
<l>When it was over I didn't get paid



</l>
<l>That is why, I gotta put it down

</l>
<l>So I'm gonna tell ya again

</l>
<l>This gonna be my last time around



</l>
<l>Well I know I'm in the wrong business

</l>
<l>That don't bother me

</l>
<l>I'm gonna take my saxophone an' sell it

</l>
<l>I'm goin' down in Tennessee



</l>
<l>That is why, I gotta put it down

</l>
<l>So I'm gonna tell ya again

</l><l>This gonna be my last time around</l></lyrics></xml>
