<lyrics>



Been playin' blues all-a my life

Always have been that way

But I've a got tired of these bills comin' in

And I don't have the money to pay



That is why, I gotta put it down

So I'm gonna tell ya again

It's gonna be my last time around



Well please don't try to tell me

'Bout all the money I made

Last night I went out an' I played all night

When it was over I didn't get paid



That is why, I gotta put it down

So I'm gonna tell ya again

This gonna be my last time around



Well I know I'm in the wrong business

That don't bother me

I'm gonna take my saxophone an' sell it

I'm goin' down in Tennessee



That is why, I gotta put it down

So I'm gonna tell ya again

This gonna be my last time around
