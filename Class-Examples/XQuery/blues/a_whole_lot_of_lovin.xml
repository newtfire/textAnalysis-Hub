<lyrics>



I got a whole lot o' lovin', baby, just waiting for you

I got a whole lot o' loving, baby, just waitin' for you

And the way I can love you woman, honey, I know you can love me
too



Well, you're so good lookin', baby, and your built up from the
ground

Well, you're so good lookin', baby, and your built up from the
ground

Ev'ry time I see you baby, my love starts tumblin' down



Yeah, you're just my height baby, just my height and size

Say, you just my type babe, you just my height and size

And the reason I love you, because you got them little dreamy
eyes
