<l>I got a whole lot o' lovin', baby, just waiting for you

</l>
<l>I got a whole lot o' loving, baby, just waitin' for you

</l>
<l>And the way I can love you woman, honey, I know you can love me

too




</l>
<l>Well, you're so good lookin', baby, and your built up from the
ground

</l>
<l>Well, you're so good lookin', baby, and your built up from the
ground

</l>
<l>Ev'ry time I see you baby, my love starts tumblin' down



</l>
<l>Yeah, you're just my height baby, just my height and size

</l>
<l>Say, you just my type babe, you just my height and size

</l><l>And the reason I love you, because you got them little dreamy</l>
<l>eyes</l></lyrics></xml>
