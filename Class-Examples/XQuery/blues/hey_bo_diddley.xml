<lyrics>



Bo Diddley done had a farm,

on that farm he had some women

Women here, women there,

women, women, women everywhere



But one little girl lived on a hill,

she rustled and tussled like Buffalo Bill

One day she decided she'd go for a ride,

with a pistol and a sword by her side



She rolled right up to my front door,

knocked an' knocked 'til her fist got sore

When she turned and walked away,

all I could hear my baby say



Hey Bo Diddley, oh Bo Diddley

Hey Bo Diddley, oh Bo Diddley



Saw my baby run across the field,

slippin' and slidin' like an automobile

Hollerin', my baby got towed away,

slipped on from me like a Cadillac-8



Hey Bo Diddley, oh Bo Diddley

Hey Bo Diddley, oh Bo Diddley
