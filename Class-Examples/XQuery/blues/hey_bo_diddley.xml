<lyrics>


<l>Bo Diddley done had a farm,

</l>
<l>on that farm he had some women

</l>
<l>Women here, women there,

</l>
<l>women, women, women everywhere



</l>
<l>But one little girl lived on a hill,

</l>
<l>she rustled and tussled like Buffalo Bill

</l>
<l>One day she decided she'd go for a ride,

</l>
<l>with a pistol and a sword by her side



</l>
<l>She rolled right up to my front door,

</l>
<l>knocked an' knocked 'til her fist got sore

</l>
<l>When she turned and walked away,

</l>
<l>all I could hear my baby say



</l>
<l>Hey Bo Diddley, oh Bo Diddley

</l>
<l>Hey Bo Diddley, oh Bo Diddley



</l>
<l>Saw my baby run across the field,

</l>
<l>slippin' and slidin' like an automobile

</l>
<l>Hollerin', my baby got towed away,

</l>
<l>slipped on from me like a Cadillac-8



</l>
<l>Hey Bo Diddley, oh Bo Diddley

</l>
<l>Hey Bo Diddley, oh Bo Diddley</l></lyrics></xml>
