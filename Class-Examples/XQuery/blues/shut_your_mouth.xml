<lyrics>


<l>I work hard everyday

</l>
<l>Do the same at night

</l>
<l>But still my baby

</l>
<l>Ain't treating me right



</l>
<l>Tell me baby baby baby baby

</l>
<l>What can I do?

</l>
<l>Do I have to shut your mouth

</l>
<l>Just to get along with you?



</l>
<l>When I'm home at night

</l>
<l>I can't read a book

</l>
<l>Without you being huffed up

</l>
<l>Giving me a dirty look



</l>
<l>Tell me baby baby baby baby

</l>
<l>What can I do?

</l>
<l>Do I have to shut your mouth

</l>
<l>Just to get along with you?



</l>
<l>She's so jealous, man

</l>
<l>Till it's a sin

</l>
<l>She don't even trust me

</l>
<l>Out with men



</l>
<l>Tell me baby baby baby baby

</l>
<l>What can I do?

</l>
<l>Do I have to shut your mouth

</l>
<l>Just to get along with you?</l></lyrics></xml>
