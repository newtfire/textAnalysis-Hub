<lyrics>



Don't understand

How I could be so blind

Something is changing

And I don't know why

Heaven knows how much I sacrifice

(I hear you, I hear you)

Now nothing in this world

Will ever change her mind



Freedom, what she needs

She wants freedom

'Cause she got dreams

In her heart it's time to go

A long way from home

Yes, it's a long way from home



I still remember

Her standing there

(Yeah, baby)

The sun was shining

On her soft brown hair

Well, all my life

Every tear I cried

I saw the future in her eyes

Now her heart says it's time to go

A long way from home



Freedom is what she needs

She wants freedom

'Cause she's got dreams

And I hope she knows she's not alone

'Cause it's a long way from home

It's a long way from home



I think about her and then I pray

That she'll be safe and warm

(Safe and warm)

I get on my knees

(Down on my knees)

Oh Lord

(Oh Lord)



Freedom is what she needs

She wants freedom

'Cause she's got dreams

Give her freedom to believe

Her heart says it's time to go

A long way from home

Such a long way from home

It's a long way from home



Freedom

(Uh huh, that's what I want)

Freedom

(That's what I need)

Freedom

(That's what I've got to have)



Freedom

(Oh baby, that's what I've gotta have)

Freedom

(Oh baby, baby)

Freedom

Freedom, freedom

(She needs freedom)

Freedom

(That's what she needs)

(She wants, she wants freedom)

Freedom, she wants freedom

(She's got to have)

Freedom, she wants freedom...
