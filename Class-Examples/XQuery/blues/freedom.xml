<lyrics>


<l>Don't understand

</l>
<l>How I could be so blind

</l>
<l>Something is changing

</l>
<l>And I don't know why

</l>
<l>Heaven knows how much I sacrifice

</l>
<l>(I hear you, I hear you)

</l>
<l>Now nothing in this world

</l>
<l>Will ever change her mind



</l>
<l>Freedom, what she needs

</l>
<l>She wants freedom

</l>
<l>'Cause she got dreams

</l>
<l>In her heart it's time to go

</l>
<l>A long way from home

</l>
<l>Yes, it's a long way from home



</l>
<l>I still remember

</l>
<l>Her standing there

</l>
<l>(Yeah, baby)

</l>
<l>The sun was shining

</l>
<l>On her soft brown hair

</l>
<l>Well, all my life

</l>
<l>Every tear I cried

</l>
<l>I saw the future in her eyes

</l>
<l>Now her heart says it's time to go

</l>
<l>A long way from home



</l>
<l>Freedom is what she needs

</l>
<l>She wants freedom

</l>
<l>'Cause she's got dreams

</l>
<l>And I hope she knows she's not alone

</l>
<l>'Cause it's a long way from home

</l>
<l>It's a long way from home



</l>
<l>I think about her and then I pray

</l>
<l>That she'll be safe and warm

</l>
<l>(Safe and warm)

</l>
<l>I get on my knees

</l>
<l>(Down on my knees)

</l>
<l>Oh Lord

</l>
<l>(Oh Lord)



</l>
<l>Freedom is what she needs

</l>
<l>She wants freedom

</l>
<l>'Cause she's got dreams

</l>
<l>Give her freedom to believe

</l>
<l>Her heart says it's time to go

</l>
<l>A long way from home

</l>
<l>Such a long way from home

</l>
<l>It's a long way from home



</l>
<l>Freedom

</l>
<l>(Uh huh, that's what I want)

</l>
<l>Freedom

</l>
<l>(That's what I need)

</l>
<l>Freedom

</l>
<l>(That's what I've got to have)



</l>
<l>Freedom

</l>
<l>(Oh baby, that's what I've gotta have)

</l>
<l>Freedom

</l>
<l>(Oh baby, baby)

</l>
<l>Freedom

</l>
<l>Freedom, freedom

</l>
<l>(She needs freedom)

</l>
<l>Freedom

</l>
<l>(That's what she needs)

</l>
<l>(She wants, she wants freedom)

</l>
<l>Freedom, she wants freedom

</l>
<l>(She's got to have)

</l>
<l>Freedom, she wants freedom...</l></lyrics></xml>
