<lyrics>



I'm sitting over here on 
Parchman
farm
1

I'm sitting over here on Parchman farm

I'm sitting over here on Parchman farm

Ain't never done no man no harm



Well, I'm putting that cotton in a never-full sack

Well, I'm putting that cotton in a never-full sack

Well, I'm putting that cotton in a never-full sack

A twelve-gauge shotgun at my back



I'm sitting over here on Parchman farm

I'm sitting over here on Parchman farm

I'm sitting over here on Parchman farm

Ain't never done no man no harm

Note 1: Parchman Farm, the state prison in 
Parchman
,
Mississippi. Parchman was a complex of 15 labor camps covering a
large area in Mississippi, a closed society of black men who were
offered as "contract" labor to farms, railroads and industries of
many sorts, passed around to do labor for the financial benefit of
both the contractor and the state who sold them.
