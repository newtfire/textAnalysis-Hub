Parchman
farm

</l>
<l>I'm sitting over here on Parchman farm

</l>
<l>I'm sitting over here on Parchman farm

</l>
<l>Ain't never done no man no harm



</l>
<l>Well, I'm putting that cotton in a never-full sack

</l>
<l>Well, I'm putting that cotton in a never-full sack

</l>
<l>Well, I'm putting that cotton in a never-full sack

</l>
<l>A twelve-gauge shotgun at my back



</l>
<l>I'm sitting over here on Parchman farm

</l>
<l>I'm sitting over here on Parchman farm

</l>
<l>I'm sitting over here on Parchman farm

</l>
<l>Ain't never done no man no harm

<note>Note 1: Parchman Farm, the state prison in 
Parchman
,
Mississippi. Parchman was a complex of 15 labor camps covering a
large area in Mississippi, a closed society of black men who were
offered as "contract" labor to farms, railroads and industries of
many sorts, passed around to do labor for the financial benefit of
both the contractor and the state who sold them</note></lyrics></xml>
