<lyrics>



I went up on the mountain, to see what Poor Kelly done

He killed his woman, an' didn't even attempt to run

Up on the mountain, just to see what Poor Kelly done

Well, he killed his woman, an' he didn't even attempt to run



When I found Poor Kelly, he was standing in the door

With a thirty-two twenty and a forty-four

When I found Poor Kelly, he was standing in the door

With a thirty-two twenty and a hard-hitting, forty-four



I asked him was he was sorry, he said,

"Nobody know, just can't stand the way she was treatin' me,
anymore,

Just couldn't stand, the way she was doin' me, anymore,

She's a dirty-mistreater, she won't 
jive

me no more"



He said, "I know I loved her, better than I did myself,

She misused me, for somebody else,

She know I loved her, better than I did myself,

Still she tried to misuse me, for somebody else"



"I know they gonna get me", he said, "But I know I don't care,

They may even send me, to the 'lectric chair,

I know they gonna get me, but babe, I don't care,

There's one consolation, they won't leave my woman, here"
