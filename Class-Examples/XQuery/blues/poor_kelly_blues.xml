<lyrics>


<l>I went up on the mountain, to see what Poor Kelly done

</l>
<l>He killed his woman, an' didn't even attempt to run

</l>
<l>Up on the mountain, just to see what Poor Kelly done

</l>
<l>Well, he killed his woman, an' he didn't even attempt to run



</l>
<l>When I found Poor Kelly, he was standing in the door

</l>
<l>With a thirty-two twenty and a forty-four

</l>
<l>When I found Poor Kelly, he was standing in the door

</l>
<l>With a thirty-two twenty and a hard-hitting, forty-four



</l>
<l>I asked him was he was sorry, he said,

</l>
<l>"Nobody know, just can't stand the way she was treatin' me,
anymore,

</l>
<l>Just couldn't stand, the way she was doin' me, anymore,

</l>
<l>She's a dirty-mistreater, she won't 
jive

</l>
<l>me no more"



</l>
<l>He said, "I know I loved her, better than I did myself,

</l>
<l>She misused me, for somebody else,

</l>
<l>She know I loved her, better than I did myself,

</l>
<l>Still she tried to misuse me, for somebody else"



</l>
<l>"I know they gonna get me", he said, "But I know I don't care,

</l>
<l>They may even send me, to the 'lectric chair,

</l>
<l>I know they gonna get me, but babe, I don't care,

</l><l>There's one consolation, they won't leave my woman, here"</l></lyrics></xml>
