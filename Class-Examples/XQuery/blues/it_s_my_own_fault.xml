<lyrics>



It's my own fault, baby

Treat me the way you wanna do



It's my own fault, baby

Treat me the way you wanna do

Yes when you were loving me, baby (woman)

At that time, little girl, I didn't love you



She used to make her own pay checks

And bring them all home to me

I would go out on the hillside, you know

And make every woman look I see



It's my own fault, baby

Treat me the way you wanna do

Yes when you were loving me, baby (woman)

At that time, little girl, I didn't love you



She said she was gonna leave me

She'd been running around with the boys

She said she was gonna leave me

Gonna be over in Illinois



It's my own fault, baby

Treat me the way you wanna do

Yes when you were loving me, baby (woman)

At that time, little girl, I didn't love you
