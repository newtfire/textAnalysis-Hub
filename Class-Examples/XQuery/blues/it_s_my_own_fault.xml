<lyrics>


<l>It's my own fault, baby

</l>
<l>Treat me the way you wanna do



</l>
<l>It's my own fault, baby

</l>
<l>Treat me the way you wanna do

</l>
<l>Yes when you were loving me, baby (woman)

</l>
<l>At that time, little girl, I didn't love you



</l>
<l>She used to make her own pay checks

</l>
<l>And bring them all home to me

</l>
<l>I would go out on the hillside, you know

</l>
<l>And make every woman look I see



</l>
<l>It's my own fault, baby

</l>
<l>Treat me the way you wanna do

</l>
<l>Yes when you were loving me, baby (woman)

</l>
<l>At that time, little girl, I didn't love you



</l>
<l>She said she was gonna leave me

</l>
<l>She'd been running around with the boys

</l>
<l>She said she was gonna leave me

</l>
<l>Gonna be over in Illinois



</l>
<l>It's my own fault, baby

</l>
<l>Treat me the way you wanna do

</l>
<l>Yes when you were loving me, baby (woman)

</l>
<l>At that time, little girl, I didn't love you</l></lyrics></xml>
