<lyrics>


<l>True love is gone, I's been played for a fool

</l>
<l>True love is gone, I's been played for a fool

</l>
<l>I'm turnin' the tables on you

</l>
<l>You've been playin' dirty pool



</l>
<l>You said you'd call the shots darlin',

</l>
<l>all your friends thought that was cool, so cool baby

</l>
<l>You said you'd call the shots darlin',

</l>
<l>all your friends thought that was so cool

</l>
<l>Yeah, when you shot at the eight-ball baby,

</l>
<l>I knew you were playin' dirty pool



</l>
<l>They say that life, life is a game of give and take

</l>
<l>They say that life, life is a game of give and take

</l>
<l>I'm tellin' you one thing right now little baby,

</l>
<l>I won't be the one to pay for your mistake
