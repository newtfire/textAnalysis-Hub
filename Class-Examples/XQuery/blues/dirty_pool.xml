<lyrics>



True love is gone, I's been played for a fool

True love is gone, I's been played for a fool

I'm turnin' the tables on you

You've been playin' dirty pool



You said you'd call the shots darlin',

all your friends thought that was cool, so cool baby

You said you'd call the shots darlin',

all your friends thought that was so cool

Yeah, when you shot at the eight-ball baby,

I knew you were playin' dirty pool



They say that life, life is a game of give and take

They say that life, life is a game of give and take

I'm tellin' you one thing right now little baby,

I won't be the one to pay for your mistake
