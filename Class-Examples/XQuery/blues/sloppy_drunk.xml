<lyrics>



I'd rather be sloppy drunk than anything I know

I'd rather be sloppy drunk than anything I know

Another half a pint, then you'll see me go



My gal done quit me, for somebody else

Oh, my gal done quit me, for somebody else

Now I'm sloppy drunk again, sleeping all by myself



Oh, I love my whiskey, tell the world I do

Oh, I love my whiskey, telling the world I do

And my reason for drinkin', tryin' to get along with you



Oh, I drink while I'm up, drink until I'll fall

I'm gonna drink while I'm up, drink until I'll fall

If you tryin' to stop me drinkin', ain't saying nothing at all



Oh, hey bartender, bring another half a pint

Oh, hey bartender, bring another half a pint

Two or three more drinks, I'm gonna raid this joint



Yes!

I'm sloppy drunk again

I don't care who knows

Yeahow!
