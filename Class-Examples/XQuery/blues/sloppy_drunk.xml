<lyrics>


<l>I'd rather be sloppy drunk than anything I know

</l>
<l>I'd rather be sloppy drunk than anything I know

</l>
<l>Another half a pint, then you'll see me go



</l>
<l>My gal done quit me, for somebody else

</l>
<l>Oh, my gal done quit me, for somebody else

</l>
<l>Now I'm sloppy drunk again, sleeping all by myself



</l>
<l>Oh, I love my whiskey, tell the world I do

</l>
<l>Oh, I love my whiskey, telling the world I do

</l>
<l>And my reason for drinkin', tryin' to get along with you



</l>
<l>Oh, I drink while I'm up, drink until I'll fall

</l>
<l>I'm gonna drink while I'm up, drink until I'll fall

</l>
<l>If you tryin' to stop me drinkin', ain't saying nothing at all



</l>
<l>Oh, hey bartender, bring another half a pint

</l>
<l>Oh, hey bartender, bring another half a pint

</l>
<l>Two or three more drinks, I'm gonna raid this joint



</l>
<l>Yes!

</l>
<l>I'm sloppy drunk again

</l>
<l>I don't care who knows

</l>
<l>Yeahow!</l></lyrics></xml>
