<lyrics>


<l>I don't want no woman, crazy 'bout a process
head
1

</l>
<l>I don't want no woman, crazy 'bout a process head

</l>
<l>She a process head, it's almost simple head



</l>
<l>Ain't got no money, only got a hair-do fare

</l>
<l>Ain't got no money, only got a hair-do fare

</l>
<l>Ain't got a dime, enough to your hair did right



</l>
<l>Been a fool one time, crazy over process head

</l>
<l>Been a fool one time, crazy over process head

</l>
<l>That no-good woman, almost drove me insane

</l>
<l>Have mercy she begged






</l>
<l>Lord, have mercy, on this processing fool

</l>
<l>Lord, have mercy, on, on this processing fool


</l>
<l>She won't have a process head, she's seen
*

</l>
<l>walking up and down the street

</l>
<l>Have mercy, have mercy, with a processing fool



</l>

<note>Note 1: process head, refers to the "marcel" hairstyle of deep
waves made with a curling iron. It also refers to the "conk" style in
which tightly curled hair is straightened using the chemical
congolene (or should it be conkolene, according to Lionel Boyd) and
then combed out. In the inner cities this is usually referred to as a
comb and conk. African American men would usually have this done on a
Thursday and then go to work on Friday wearing a bandana on their
heads to keep their hair straight for the evening. the bandana is
called a "do-rag". Thanks to Alan Wexler for this contribution</note></lyrics></xml>
