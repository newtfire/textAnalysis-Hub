I don't want no woman, crazy 'bout a process
head
1

I don't want no woman, crazy 'bout a process head

She a process head, it's almost simple head



Ain't got no money, only got a hair-do fare

Ain't got no money, only got a hair-do fare

Ain't got a dime, enough to your hair did right



Been a fool one time, crazy over process head

Been a fool one time, crazy over process head

That no-good woman, almost drove me insane

Have mercy she begged




Lord, have mercy, on this processing fool

Lord, have mercy, on, on this processing fool


She won't have a process head, she's seen
*

walking up and down the street

Have mercy, have mercy, with a processing fool



_________


* I'm not sure about the underlined part in the last verse

Note 1: process head, refers to the "marcel" hairstyle of deep
waves made with a curling iron. It also refers to the "conk" style in
which tightly curled hair is straightened using the chemical
congolene (or should it be conkolene, according to Lionel Boyd) and
then combed out. In the inner cities this is usually referred to as a
comb and conk. African American men would usually have this done on a
Thursday and then go to work on Friday wearing a bandana on their
heads to keep their hair straight for the evening. the bandana is
called a "do-rag". Thanks to Alan Wexler for this contribution.
