<l>Good mornin' baby, baby, welcome back, baby, welcome back to town

</l>
<l>Yeah, you doin' so much trav'lin' woman, I never know when you're

gonna be around




</l>

</l>
<l>You love me like an angel baby but you treat me like a fool

</l>
<l>Two faced woman don't you hand me no double cross

</l>

</l>
<l>Well, I can tell you, I can tell you, "Baby, get lost!"



</l>

</l>

lose

</l>

</l>
<l>I wanna tell you I got to be the boss

</l>
<l>Yeah, because anytime I'm ready baby,

</l>
