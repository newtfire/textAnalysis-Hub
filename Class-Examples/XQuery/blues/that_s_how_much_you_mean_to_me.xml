There ain't no road too rough to walk

There ain't no talk too sweet to talk

Wherever you are, it's where I'll be

'Cause that's how much you mean to me



All the money in the whole round world

Wouldn't be enough for you, little girl

Wish I could give you a money tree

'Cause that's how much you mean to me



A girl like you needs some loving

Teasin', squeezin' and huggin'

Step right up and take my hand

I wanna be your great big hunk of man



Baby, I wanna have your picture

To put it in my, my storybook

While it out big so the world can see

'Cause that's how much you mean to me
