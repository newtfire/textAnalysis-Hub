<lyrics>


<l>There ain't no road too rough to walk

</l>
<l>There ain't no talk too sweet to talk

</l>
<l>Wherever you are, it's where I'll be

</l>
<l>'Cause that's how much you mean to me



</l>
<l>All the money in the whole round world

</l>
<l>Wouldn't be enough for you, little girl

</l>
<l>Wish I could give you a money tree

</l>
<l>'Cause that's how much you mean to me



</l>
<l>A girl like you needs some loving

</l>
<l>Teasin', squeezin' and huggin'

</l>
<l>Step right up and take my hand

</l>
<l>I wanna be your great big hunk of man



</l>
<l>Baby, I wanna have your picture

</l>
<l>To put it in my, my storybook

</l>
<l>While it out big so the world can see

</l>
<l>'Cause that's how much you mean to me</l></lyrics></xml>
