<lyrics>

<l>Well, there's one kind of favor I'll ask of you</l>

<l>Well, there's one kind of favor I'll ask of you</l>

<l>There's just one kind of favor I'll ask of you</l>

<l>You can see that my grave is kept clean</l>



<l>And there's two white horses following me</l>

<l>And there's two white horses following me</l>

<l>I got two white horses following me</l>

<l>Waiting on my burying ground</l>



<l>Did you ever hear that coffin' sound</l>

<l>Have you ever heard that coffin' sound</l>

<l>Did you ever hear that coffin' sound</l>

<l>Means another poor boy is under ground</l>



<l>Did you ever hear them church bells tone</l>

<l>Have you ever hear'd them church bells tone</l>

<l>Did you ever hear them church bells tone</l>

<l>Means another poor boy is dead and gone</l>



<l>Well, my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold</l>

<l>And, my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold</l>

<l>Well, my heart stopped beating and my hands turned cold</l>

<l>Now I believe what the bible told</l>



<l>There's just one last favor I'll ask of you</l>

<l>And there's one last favor I'll ask of you</l>

<l>There's just one last favor I'll ask of you</l>

<l>See that my grave is kept clean</l>

One Kind Favor
. Blind
Lemon Jefferson's most famous folk song contains a wish that has been
fulfilled by some of his many admirers. A group of contemporary
artists came together to get him a new headstone. The grave is in the
segregated section of the Wortham, Texas, cemetery on Highway 14,
some 85 miles south of Dallas.
