<lyrics>



Yeah,

I wanna get down



I wanna get funky

I wanna get down, yeah



I wanna get funky, yeah

You know, I wanna get down



Now listen to this:



When I leave work

My trouble is gone

I rush to my baby

Who's waiting at home



I wanna get funky, yeah yeah

I wanna get down

You know, I wanna get funky

I wanna get down



When I plays my music

From town to town

I can hear the people talkin'

Sayin' they wanna get down



I wanna get funky, yeah

You know, I wanna get down



I'm gonna get on down now



I wanna get funky

I wanna get down yeah



I want to get funky, yeah

Well, you know, I wanna get down



When I leave work

My trouble is gone

I run to my baby

Who's waiting at home



I wanna get funky

I said, you know, I wanna get down



Listen:



I wanna get funky, yeah baby, oh baby

I wanna get down

Oh
