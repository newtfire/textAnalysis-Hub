<lyrics>


<l>I got to leave this woman but I ain't got nowhere else to go

</l>
<l>I got to leave this woman, I ain't got nowhere else to go

</l>
<l>You see, she owns everything, including the carpet on the floor



</l>
<l>When I was givin' her my money, she treated me like I was B.B.
King

</l>
<l>Hey, when I was givin' her my money, she treated me like I was B.B.
King

</l>
<l>Now I ain't got no money left, now she treats me, like I'm not even a

human bein'




</l>
<l>I got to leave this woman, I can't take this kind of treatment no
more

</l>
<l>Got to leave this woman, I can't take this kind of treatment no
more

</l>
<l>I've got one big problem, I ain't got nowhere to go



</l>
<l>Hey, all the pretty furniture she got, I even bought her a mink coat
too

</l>
<l>Yeah, all the furniture she got, I even bought her that mink coat
too

</l>
<l>Now that we've got a divorce, that's what she put me through



</l>
<l>I got to leave this woman but I ain't got nowhere else to go

</l>
<l>I got to leave this woman, can't take this kind of treatment no
more

</l>
<l>She owns everything, even the carpet on the floor</l></lyrics></xml>
