<lyrics>



I got to leave this woman but I ain't got nowhere else to go

I got to leave this woman, I ain't got nowhere else to go

You see, she owns everything, including the carpet on the floor



When I was givin' her my money, she treated me like I was B.B.
King

Hey, when I was givin' her my money, she treated me like I was B.B.
King

Now I ain't got no money left, now she treats me, like I'm not even a
human bein'



I got to leave this woman, I can't take this kind of treatment no
more

Got to leave this woman, I can't take this kind of treatment no
more

I've got one big problem, I ain't got nowhere to go



Hey, all the pretty furniture she got, I even bought her a mink coat
too

Yeah, all the furniture she got, I even bought her that mink coat
too

Now that we've got a divorce, that's what she put me through



I got to leave this woman but I ain't got nowhere else to go

I got to leave this woman, can't take this kind of treatment no
more

She owns everything, even the carpet on the floor
