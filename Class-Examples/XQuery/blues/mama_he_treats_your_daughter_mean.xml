<lyrics>



I said mama he treats your daughter
mean

Oh I said mama he treats your daughter mean

Well he's the meanest man I've ever seen



I said mama this man is lazy

Almost drive me crazy

Mama he takes all my money

Makes me call him honey



I've stood all that I can stand

Said what's the matter with this man



I said mama he treats your daughter so mean

Oh I said mama he treats your daughter so mean

Well he's the meanest man I've ever seen

Help me now!



I said mama he treats your daughter so mean

Oh I said mama he treats your daughter so mean

Well he's the meanest man I've ever seen



Oh I said mama I'm so disgusted

He just can't be trusted

Mama he makes me squeeze him

Oh tell mama my squeezes just don't please him



I've stood all I can stand

Gonna pack my bags and leave this man



I said mama he treats your daughter so mean

Oh I said mama he treats your daughter so mean

He's the meanest man I've ever seen

Lord, No, Now!



Got to find a good man

Oh I said mama I'm tired of this man of mine

I got to find me a good man baby

Find me a good man now

Find me a good man baby

I got to find me a good man, oh yes!

I got to find me a good man now

I need a good man

One that's gonna treat me right

And oh one that's gonna come home at night

I don't want a man that fuss and fights

Oh, I said mama, mama, he treats, your daughter, mean



Oh I said mama he treats your daughter so mean

Well he's the meanest man I've ever seen

Oh, No, So Mean!
