<l>I said mama he treats your daughter
mean

</l>
<l>Oh I said mama he treats your daughter mean

</l>
<l>Well he's the meanest man I've ever seen



</l>
<l>I said mama this man is lazy

</l>
<l>Almost drive me crazy

</l>
<l>Mama he takes all my money

</l>
<l>Makes me call him honey



</l>
<l>I've stood all that I can stand

</l>
<l>Said what's the matter with this man



</l>
<l>I said mama he treats your daughter so mean

</l>
<l>Oh I said mama he treats your daughter so mean

</l>
<l>Well he's the meanest man I've ever seen

</l>
<l>Help me now!



</l>
<l>I said mama he treats your daughter so mean

</l>
<l>Oh I said mama he treats your daughter so mean

</l>
<l>Well he's the meanest man I've ever seen



</l>
<l>Oh I said mama I'm so disgusted

</l>
<l>He just can't be trusted

</l>
<l>Mama he makes me squeeze him

</l>
<l>Oh tell mama my squeezes just don't please him



</l>
<l>I've stood all I can stand

</l>
<l>Gonna pack my bags and leave this man



</l>
<l>I said mama he treats your daughter so mean

</l>
<l>Oh I said mama he treats your daughter so mean

</l>
<l>He's the meanest man I've ever seen

</l>
<l>Lord, No, Now!



</l>
<l>Got to find a good man

</l>
<l>Oh I said mama I'm tired of this man of mine

</l>
<l>I got to find me a good man baby

</l>
<l>Find me a good man now

</l>
<l>Find me a good man baby

</l>
<l>I got to find me a good man, oh yes!

</l>
<l>I got to find me a good man now

</l>
<l>I need a good man

</l>
<l>One that's gonna treat me right

</l>
<l>And oh one that's gonna come home at night

</l>
<l>I don't want a man that fuss and fights

</l>
<l>Oh, I said mama, mama, he treats, your daughter, mean



</l>
<l>Oh I said mama he treats your daughter so mean

</l>
<l>Well he's the meanest man I've ever seen

</l><l>Oh, No, So Mean!</l></lyrics></xml>
