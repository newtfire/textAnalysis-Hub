<lyrics>



Now I don't want no, no skinny woman, I want the woman, she
got a-plenty of, Lord

I don't want no skinny woman, I want some, a woman with a-plenty
a-meat

Now, we can roll all night long, an' this woman, won't have to stop
'n eat



Well I've got so, so many women, now an' I don't know who I love

Yes Lord, I 've got me, so many women, til I'm, I really don't know
who I love

Now an' it seems like the girl I been cravin' for, slipped away to
the good Lord, up above



I have the blues, blues in the mo'nin, blues is the first thing, when
I lay down

An' Lord I have, the blues in the mo'nin, blues is the first thing
when I lay down at night

Now that's the reason my baby worries me, my baby she don't treat me
right



Now if you take me, take me back, baby, now an' I won't do you mean
no mo', oh Lord

If you just forgive me this time, I won't never do you mean no
mo'

Now that you been get all-a my labor, love n' you, just let Mister So
an' So, go



Now she is gone, she is gone but she'll fer'ever be on my mind, oh
Lord

I, she gone, she's gone, she'll for'ever be on my mind

Now she was a sweet little woman, she just, wouldn't be lovin' n'
kind
