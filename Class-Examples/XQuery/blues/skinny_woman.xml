<lyrics>


<l>Now I don't want no, no skinny woman, I want the woman, she
got a-plenty of, Lord

</l>
<l>I don't want no skinny woman, I want some, a woman with a-plenty
a-meat

</l>
<l>Now, we can roll all night long, an' this woman, won't have to stop

'n eat




</l>
<l>Well I've got so, so many women, now an' I don't know who I love

</l>
<l>Yes Lord, I 've got me, so many women, til I'm, I really don't know
who I love

</l>
<l>Now an' it seems like the girl I been cravin' for, slipped away to

the good Lord, up above




</l>
<l>I have the blues, blues in the mo'nin, blues is the first thing, when
I lay down

</l>
<l>An' Lord I have, the blues in the mo'nin, blues is the first thing
when I lay down at night

</l>
<l>Now that's the reason my baby worries me, my baby she don't treat me

right




</l>
<l>Now if you take me, take me back, baby, now an' I won't do you mean
no mo', oh Lord

</l>
<l>If you just forgive me this time, I won't never do you mean no
mo'

</l>
<l>Now that you been get all-a my labor, love n' you, just let Mister So

an' So, go




</l>
<l>Now she is gone, she is gone but she'll fer'ever be on my mind, oh
Lord

</l>
<l>I, she gone, she's gone, she'll for'ever be on my mind

</l><l>Now she was a sweet little woman, she just, wouldn't be lovin' n'</l>
<l>kind</l></lyrics></xml>
