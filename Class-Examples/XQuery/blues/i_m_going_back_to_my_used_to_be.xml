<lyrics>



Clara: I feel sad

Bessie: You feel blue

Clara: I can hardly sleep at night

Bessie: For your man was sore all the time

Clara: And I know I didn't treat him right

Bessie: You're going back to your first love

Clara: 'Cause a good man is hard to find

Bessie: I say you'll have such a grand good man

Clara: Believe me he is sure on my mind



Clara: I'm going back

Bessie: Yeah, you carrying it on back

Clara: I'm going back to my used to be

Bessie: You're going back

Clara: I'm going back, 'cause my man was sure good to me

When last winter when times was rough

Bessie: Look out there, Clara,

Clara: You know your man was in the pool yard 
strutting
his stuff

I'm going back

Bessie: Clara, you say you're going back

I'm going back to my used to be

Bessie: And it's this morning

Clara: Back to my used to be

Bessie: What can you use him for

Clara: Crazy about my used to be

Bessie: He ain't good-looking

Clara: I love my used to be
