<l>Clara: I feel sad

</l>
<l>Bessie: You feel blue

</l>
<l>Clara: I can hardly sleep at night

</l>
<l>Bessie: For your man was sore all the time

</l>
<l>Clara: And I know I didn't treat him right

</l>
<l>Bessie: You're going back to your first love

</l>
<l>Clara: 'Cause a good man is hard to find

</l>

</l>
<l>When last winter when times was rough

</l>
<l>Bessie: Look out there, Clara,

</l>
<l>Clara: You know your man was in the pool yard 
strutting
his stuff

</l>
<l>I'm going back
