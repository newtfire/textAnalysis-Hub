<lyrics>



- Hold him, Luke, he must be a bootlegger
1
! -



I've been drinking all night, babe, and the night before

But when I get sober I ain't gonna drink no more

'Cause my friend's left me standing in my door



My head goes round and around, babe, since my baby left town

I don't know if the river's running up or down

But that one thing certain is, mama's going to leave town



You'll find me reeling and a-rocking, howling like a hound

Catch the first train that's running Southbound

Oh stop, you'll hear me saying

Stop, right through my brain

Oh stop that train

So I can ride back home again



Here I'm upon my knees

Play that again for me

'Cause I'm about to be a-losing my mind

Boys, I can't stand up, I can't sit down

The man I love has done left town

I feel like screaming, I feel like crying, Lord

I've been mistreated, folks, and don't mind I'm dying

I'm going home, I'm going to settle down

I'm going to stop my running around

Tell everybody that comes my way

I've got those 
moonshine

blues, I say

I've got those moonshine blues
