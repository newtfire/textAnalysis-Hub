<l>- Hold him, Luke, he must be a bootlegger

! -



</l>
<l>I've been drinking all night, babe, and the night before

</l>
<l>But when I get sober I ain't gonna drink no more

</l>
<l>'Cause my friend's left me standing in my door



</l>
<l>My head goes round and around, babe, since my baby left town

</l>
<l>I don't know if the river's running up or down

</l>
<l>But that one thing certain is, mama's going to leave town



</l>
<l>You'll find me reeling and a-rocking, howling like a hound

</l>
<l>Catch the first train that's running Southbound

</l>
<l>Oh stop, you'll hear me saying

</l>
<l>Stop, right through my brain

</l>
<l>Oh stop that train

</l>
<l>So I can ride back home again



</l>
<l>Here I'm upon my knees

</l>
<l>Play that again for me

</l>
<l>'Cause I'm about to be a-losing my mind

</l>
<l>Boys, I can't stand up, I can't sit down

</l>
<l>The man I love has done left town

</l>
<l>I feel like screaming, I feel like crying, Lord

</l>
<l>I've been mistreated, folks, and don't mind I'm dying

</l>
<l>I'm going home, I'm going to settle down

</l>
<l>I'm going to stop my running around

</l>
<l>Tell everybody that comes my way

</l>
<l>I've got those 
moonshine

</l>
<l>blues, I say

</l>
<l>I've got those moonshine blues
