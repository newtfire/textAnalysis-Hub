<lyrics>



Honey, no more doggin', foolin' 'round with you

Honey, no more doggin', foolin' 'round with you

I'm gonna let'cha out baby, and that's what I've got to do



Well, told you all the straights and I made you fine

You spend my money on whiskey, beer and wine

No more doggin', foolin' 'round with you,

I'm gonna let'cha out baby, and that's what I've got to do



Well, ya told me that'cha love me and you told me a lie

Yes, I'll love you until the day I die

No more doggin', foolin' 'round with you

I gotta let'cha out, baby, and that's what I've got, oh yes



Well, ya know I love ya baby and I can't help myself

Yes, I'll love you until the day I die

No more doggin', foolin' 'round with you

I gotta let'cha out, baby, and that's what I've got to do

I gotta let'cha out, baby, and that's what I've got to do

I gotta let'cha out, baby, and that's what I've got to do
