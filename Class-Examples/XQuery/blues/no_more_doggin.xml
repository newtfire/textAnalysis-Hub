<l>Honey, no more doggin', foolin' 'round with you

</l>
<l>Honey, no more doggin', foolin' 'round with you

</l>
<l>I'm gonna let'cha out baby, and that's what I've got to do



</l>
<l>Well, told you all the straights and I made you fine

</l>
<l>You spend my money on whiskey, beer and wine

</l>
<l>No more doggin', foolin' 'round with you,

</l>
<l>I'm gonna let'cha out baby, and that's what I've got to do



</l>
<l>Well, ya told me that'cha love me and you told me a lie

</l>
<l>Yes, I'll love you until the day I die

</l>
<l>No more doggin', foolin' 'round with you

</l>
<l>I gotta let'cha out, baby, and that's what I've got, oh yes



</l>
<l>Well, ya know I love ya baby and I can't help myself

</l>
<l>Yes, I'll love you until the day I die

</l>
<l>No more doggin', foolin' 'round with you

</l>
<l>I gotta let'cha out, baby, and that's what I've got to do

</l>
<l>I gotta let'cha out, baby, and that's what I've got to do

</l>
<l>I gotta let'cha out, baby, and that's what I've got to do</l></lyrics></xml>
