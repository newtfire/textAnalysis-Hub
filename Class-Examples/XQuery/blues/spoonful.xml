<lyrics>



It could be a 
spoonful

of diamonds

Could be a spoonful of gold

Just a little spoon of your precious love

Satisfies my soul



Men lies about little

Some of them cries about little

Some of them dies about little

Everything fight about little spoonful

That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful



It could be a spoonful of coffee

Could be a spoonful of tea

But a little spoon of your precious love

Good enough for me



Men lies about that

Some of them dies about that

Some of them cries about that

But everything fight about that spoonful

That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful



It could be a spoonful of water

Saved from the deserts sand

But one spoon of them fortifies

Save you from another man



Men lies about that

Some of them cries about that

Some of them dies about that

Everybody fightin' about that spoonful

That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful
