<lyrics>


<l>It could be a 
spoonful

</l>
<l>of diamonds

</l>
<l>Could be a spoonful of gold

</l>
<l>Just a little spoon of your precious love

</l>
<l>Satisfies my soul



</l>
<l>Men lies about little

</l>
<l>Some of them cries about little

</l>
<l>Some of them dies about little

</l>
<l>Everything fight about little spoonful

</l>
<l>That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful



</l>
<l>It could be a spoonful of coffee

</l>
<l>Could be a spoonful of tea

</l>
<l>But a little spoon of your precious love

</l>
<l>Good enough for me



</l>
<l>Men lies about that

</l>
<l>Some of them dies about that

</l>
<l>Some of them cries about that

</l>
<l>But everything fight about that spoonful

</l>
<l>That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful



</l>
<l>It could be a spoonful of water

</l>
<l>Saved from the deserts sand

</l>
<l>But one spoon of them fortifies

</l>
<l>Save you from another man



</l>
<l>Men lies about that

</l>
<l>Some of them cries about that

</l>
<l>Some of them dies about that

</l>
<l>Everybody fightin' about that spoonful

</l><l>That spoon, that spoon, that spoonful</l></lyrics></xml>
