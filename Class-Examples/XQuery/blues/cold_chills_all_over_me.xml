<lyrics>



Cold chills, my baby makes cold chills go all over me

Cold chills, cold chills goes all over me

Ev'rytime I lay my hand on her brown body, cold chills goes all over
me



Baby, I say please don't run around, baby, please don't stay out all
night long

Baby, please don't run around, baby, please don't stay out all night
long

When you come home drunk and you know that's what you've done



My baby went out last night, my baby got drunk

That's one thing, God knows, I just can't stand

She makes cold chills, she make cold chills go out all over me

Ev'rytime you go out and get drunk, it makes cold chills go all over
me



I got drunk last night, baby, I got drunk to keep from cryin'

Lord, I got drunk last night, baby, I got drunk to keep from
cryin'

You didn't come home last night, baby and that lasted four days
