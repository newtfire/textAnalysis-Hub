<lyrics>


<l>Cold chills, my baby makes cold chills go all over me

</l>
<l>Cold chills, cold chills goes all over me

</l>
<l>Ev'rytime I lay my hand on her brown body, cold chills goes all over

me




</l>
<l>Baby, I say please don't run around, baby, please don't stay out all
night long

</l>
<l>Baby, please don't run around, baby, please don't stay out all night
long

</l>
<l>When you come home drunk and you know that's what you've done



</l>
<l>My baby went out last night, my baby got drunk

</l>
<l>That's one thing, God knows, I just can't stand

</l>
<l>She makes cold chills, she make cold chills go out all over me

</l>
<l>Ev'rytime you go out and get drunk, it makes cold chills go all over

me




</l>
<l>I got drunk last night, baby, I got drunk to keep from cryin'

</l>
<l>Lord, I got drunk last night, baby, I got drunk to keep from
cryin'

</l>
<l>You didn't come home last night, baby and that lasted four days</l></lyrics></xml>
