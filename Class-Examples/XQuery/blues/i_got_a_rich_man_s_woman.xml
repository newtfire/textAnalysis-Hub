<lyrics>



Oh yeah, the woman she's livin' on a poor man's pay,

I bought my babe a mink coat,

with fur just to match her hair

When I asked her out for dinner,

she said, "Oh this is just common wear"

I work hard on two jobs,

and I make overtime every day

Oh, you know I got a, I got a rich man's woman,

but she's livin' on a poor man's pay



I bought my babe a cadillac,

she said, "That's just a common gift"

When she passes me walkin' on the streets,

she refuse to give me a lift

I told you I work hard on two jobs,

and I make overtime every day

Oh, you know I got a, I got a rich man's woman,

but she's living on a poor man's pay



There ain't no use for you to argue,

just go ahead and let the girl have her way

Even if she's a rich man's woman,

and I know she's livin' on a poor man's pay

I told you I work hard on two jobs,

and I make overtime every day

Oh, you know I know I got myself a rich mans woman,

but the woman she's livin' on a poor man's pay
