<lyrics>


<l>Oh yeah, the woman she's livin' on a poor man's pay,

</l>
<l>I bought my babe a mink coat,

</l>
<l>with fur just to match her hair

</l>
<l>When I asked her out for dinner,

</l>
<l>she said, "Oh this is just common wear"

</l>
<l>I work hard on two jobs,

</l>
<l>and I make overtime every day

</l>
<l>Oh, you know I got a, I got a rich man's woman,

</l>
<l>but she's livin' on a poor man's pay



</l>
<l>I bought my babe a cadillac,

</l>
<l>she said, "That's just a common gift"

</l>
<l>When she passes me walkin' on the streets,

</l>
<l>she refuse to give me a lift

</l>
<l>I told you I work hard on two jobs,

</l>
<l>and I make overtime every day

</l>
<l>Oh, you know I got a, I got a rich man's woman,

</l>
<l>but she's living on a poor man's pay



</l>
<l>There ain't no use for you to argue,

</l>
<l>just go ahead and let the girl have her way

</l>
<l>Even if she's a rich man's woman,

</l>
<l>and I know she's livin' on a poor man's pay

</l>
<l>I told you I work hard on two jobs,

</l>
<l>and I make overtime every day

</l>
<l>Oh, you know I know I got myself a rich mans woman,

</l>
<l>but the woman she's livin' on a poor man's pay</l></lyrics></xml>
