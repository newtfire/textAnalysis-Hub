<lyrics>



I wake up and think of her

No matter what I do

She's always on my mind

A time a day or two

Seems to me the things you've loved the most

You always lose

But once you've got them

You've always got the blues



In time, well you may find someone else

That can comfort you

But not someone to light the fire

No, not the way she used to do



You lose the things that made it

What it was when it was new

And once you've got them

You've always got the blues



That new love only can replace

Just so much of you

That leaves a lot that gets lost between

Number one and number two

In time, well you may find someone else

That can comfort you

But not someone to light the fire

No, not the way she used to do



You lose the things that made it

What it was when it was new

And once you've got them

You've always got the blues
