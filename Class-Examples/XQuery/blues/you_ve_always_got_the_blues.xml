<lyrics>


<l>I wake up and think of her

</l>
<l>No matter what I do

</l>
<l>She's always on my mind

</l>
<l>A time a day or two

</l>
<l>Seems to me the things you've loved the most

</l>
<l>You always lose

</l>
<l>But once you've got them

</l>
<l>You've always got the blues



</l>
<l>In time, well you may find someone else

</l>
<l>That can comfort you

</l>
<l>But not someone to light the fire

</l>
<l>No, not the way she used to do



</l>
<l>You lose the things that made it

</l>
<l>What it was when it was new

</l>
<l>And once you've got them

</l>
<l>You've always got the blues



</l>
<l>That new love only can replace

</l>
<l>Just so much of you

</l>
<l>That leaves a lot that gets lost between

</l>
<l>Number one and number two

</l>
<l>In time, well you may find someone else

</l>
<l>That can comfort you

</l>
<l>But not someone to light the fire

</l>
<l>No, not the way she used to do



</l>
<l>You lose the things that made it

</l>
<l>What it was when it was new

</l>
<l>And once you've got them

</l>
<l>You've always got the blues</l></lyrics></xml>
