<lyrics>


<l>I've been a roaming Romeo

</l>
<l>My Juliets have been many

</l>
<l>But now my roaming days are gone

</l>
<l>Too many irons in the fire

</l>
<l>Is worse than not having any

</l>
<l>I've had my share and from now on



</l>
<l>I'm putting all my eggs in one basket

</l>
<l>I'm betting everything I got on you

</l>
<l>I'm giving all my love to one baby

</l>
<l>Lord help me

</l>
<l>If my baby don't come through



</l>
<l>I've got a great big amount

</l>
<l>Saved up in my love account

</l>
<l>Honey, and I decided

</l>
<l>Love divided in two won't do

</l>
<l>So I'm putting all my eggs in one basket

</l>
<l>I'm betting everything I got on you



</l>
<l>Now here's what I mean



</l>
<l>I've been a roaming Juliet

</l>
<l>Yeah, she has

</l>
<l>My Romeos have been many

</l>
<l>You're right, baby

</l>
<l>But now my roaming days are gone

</l>
<l>That's what I wanna hear

</l>
<l>Too many irons in the fire

</l>
<l>Yeah?

</l>
<l>Is worse than not having any

</l>
<l>Um huh!

</l>
<l>I've had my share and from now on

</l>
<l>Yeah?



</l>
<l>I'm putting all my eggs in one basket

</l>
<l>I'm betting everything I got on you

</l>
<l>Daddy!

</l>
<l>I'm giving all my love to one baby

</l>
<l>Lord help me

</l>
<l>If my baby don't come through



</l>
<l>Got a great big amount

</l>
<l>Saved up in my love account

</l>
<l>Honey, I've decided

</l>
<l>Love divided in two won't do

</l>
<l>In two, won't do

</l>
<l>So I'm putting all my eggs in one basket

</l>
<l>I'm betting everything I got on you

</l>
<l>I'm betting everything I got on you



</l>
<l>I'm betting on you, baby

</l>
<l>Got on you

</l>
<l>I'm betting on you</l></lyrics></xml>
