<lyrics>



I've been a roaming Romeo

My Juliets have been many

But now my roaming days are gone

Too many irons in the fire

Is worse than not having any

I've had my share and from now on



I'm putting all my eggs in one basket

I'm betting everything I got on you

I'm giving all my love to one baby

Lord help me

If my baby don't come through



I've got a great big amount

Saved up in my love account

Honey, and I decided

Love divided in two won't do

So I'm putting all my eggs in one basket

I'm betting everything I got on you



Now here's what I mean



I've been a roaming Juliet

Yeah, she has

My Romeos have been many

You're right, baby

But now my roaming days are gone

That's what I wanna hear

Too many irons in the fire

Yeah?

Is worse than not having any

Um huh!

I've had my share and from now on

Yeah?



I'm putting all my eggs in one basket

I'm betting everything I got on you

Daddy!

I'm giving all my love to one baby

Lord help me

If my baby don't come through



Got a great big amount

Saved up in my love account

Honey, I've decided

Love divided in two won't do

In two, won't do

So I'm putting all my eggs in one basket

I'm betting everything I got on you

I'm betting everything I got on you



I'm betting on you, baby

Got on you

I'm betting on you
