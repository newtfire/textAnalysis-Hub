<lyrics>



Honey, there's a funny feeling 'round my heart,

and it's bound to drive your mama wild

It must be something they call the 
Cuban
Doll
1
,

it weren't your mama's angel child



I went to see the doctor the other day, he said I's well as well
could be

But I said, "Doctor, you don't know really what's worrying me"

I want to be somebody's baby doll so I can get my loving all the
time

I want to be somebody's baby doll to ease my mind

He can be ugly, he can be black, so long as he can 
eagle
rock
 and 
ball the
jack

I want to be somebody's baby doll so I can get my lovin' all the
time,

I mean to get my lovin' all the time



Lord, I went to the gypsy to get my fortune told,

she said you in hard luck, Bessie, 
doggone

your bad luck soul

I want to be somebody's baby doll so I can get my lovin' all the
time,

I mean to get my lovin' all the time
