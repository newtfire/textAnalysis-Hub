<lyrics>

<l>Honey, there's a funny feeling 'round my heart,

</l>
<l>and it's bound to drive your mama wild

</l>
<l>It must be something they call the 
Cuban
Doll
1
,

</l>
<l>it weren't your mama's angel child



</l>
<l>I went to see the doctor the other day, he said I's well as well
could be

</l>
<l>But I said, "Doctor, you don't know really what's worrying me"

</l>
<l>I want to be somebody's baby doll so I can get my loving all the
time

</l>
<l>I want to be somebody's baby doll to ease my mind

</l>
<l>He can be ugly, he can be black, so long as he can 
eagle
rock
and  </l>
<l>ball the
jack

</l>
<l>I want to be somebody's baby doll so I can get my lovin' all the
time,

</l>
<l>I mean to get my lovin' all the time



</l>
<l>Lord, I went to the gypsy to get my fortune told,

</l>
<l>she said you in hard luck, Bessie, 
doggone

</l>
<l>your bad luck soul

</l>
<l>I want to be somebody's baby doll so I can get my lovin' all the
time,

</l>
<l>I mean to get my lovin' all the time
