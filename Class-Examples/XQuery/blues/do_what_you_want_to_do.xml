<lyrics>


<l>You think you're the only woman

</l>
<l>Who can keep me satisfied

</l>
<l>You think you're the only woman

</l>
<l>Who can always keep me tied



</l>
<l>But you don't know, baby

</l>
<l>You don't know what I got in store for you

</l>
<l>I'm gonna give up ev'rything, baby

</l>
<l>You can do what you wanna do



</l>
<l>I always took the naggin'

</l>
<l>The accusation of doin' wrong

</l>
<l>But I'm fed up with it, baby

</l>
<l>Because my love is not that strong



</l>
<l>You don't know, baby

</l>
<l>You don't know what's in store for you

</l>
<l>I'm gonna give up ev'rything, baby

</l>
<l>You can do what you wanna do</l></lyrics></xml>
