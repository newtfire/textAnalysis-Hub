<lyrics>


<l>I believe I'll marry, I believe I'll settle down

</l>
<l>I believe I'll marry, I believe I'll settle down

</l>
<l>Lord, I'm tired of bein' a rambler, my last trip for runnin'

around




</l>
<l>Lord, I wonder, will she ever call my name?

</l>
<l>Lord, I wonder, will she ever call my name?

</l>
<l>Now she don't love me no mo', peoples ain't that a cryin' shame?



</l>
<l>They tell me marriage is a sweet life, I believe I'll try myself

</l>
<l>They tell me marriage is a sweet life, I believe I'll try myself

</l>
<l>If I can't get the one I love, I won't take a chance with no one

else




</l>
<l>Lord, I wonder, will she ever think of me?

</l>
<l>Lord, I wonder, will she ever think of me?

</l><l>I'm sittin' with my head bendin' down, and tears fallin' on my</l>
<l>knees</l></lyrics></xml>
