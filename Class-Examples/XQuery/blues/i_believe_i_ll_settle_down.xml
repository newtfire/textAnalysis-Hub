<lyrics>



I believe I'll marry, I believe I'll settle down

I believe I'll marry, I believe I'll settle down

Lord, I'm tired of bein' a rambler, my last trip for runnin'
around



Lord, I wonder, will she ever call my name?

Lord, I wonder, will she ever call my name?

Now she don't love me no mo', peoples ain't that a cryin' shame?



They tell me marriage is a sweet life, I believe I'll try myself

They tell me marriage is a sweet life, I believe I'll try myself

If I can't get the one I love, I won't take a chance with no one
else



Lord, I wonder, will she ever think of me?

Lord, I wonder, will she ever think of me?

I'm sittin' with my head bendin' down, and tears fallin' on my
knees
