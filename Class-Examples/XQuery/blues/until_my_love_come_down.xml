<lyrics>



Now you got the fruit on your tree, lemons on your shelf

You know lovin' mama that you can't squeeze them all yourself

Now I say please let me be your 
lemon
squeezer

Now while's I'm in your lonesome town

Now if you let me be your lemon squeezer

Lord until my love come down



Now it make no difference baby, what your mama don't allow

Come on let me squeeze your lemons baby, I mean anyhow

Now I say please let me be your lemon squeezer

Now while's I'm in your lonesome town

Now if you let me be your lemon squeezer

Lord until my love come down



I like your apple on your tree, I'm crazy about your peaches too

I'm crazy about your fruit baby, 'cause you know just how to do

Now please let me be your lemon squeezer (yes my Lord!)

Now while's I'm in your lonesome town

Now you let me be your lemon squeezer

Lord until my love come down



Now and it ain't but the one thing baby, now that'll really make me
cry (what, man?)

I asked you about your lemons baby, and you upped and tell me a
lie

Now please let me be your lemon squeezer

Now while's I'm in your lonesome town

Now I want you let me be your lemon squeezer

Lord until my love come down
