<lyrics>


<l>Now you got the fruit on your tree, lemons on your shelf

</l>
<l>You know lovin' mama that you can't squeeze them all yourself

</l>
<l>Now I say please let me be your 
lemon
squeezer

</l>
<l>Now while's I'm in your lonesome town

</l>
<l>Now if you let me be your lemon squeezer

</l>
<l>Lord until my love come down



</l>
<l>Now it make no difference baby, what your mama don't allow

</l>
<l>Come on let me squeeze your lemons baby, I mean anyhow

</l>
<l>Now I say please let me be your lemon squeezer

</l>
<l>Now while's I'm in your lonesome town

</l>
<l>Now if you let me be your lemon squeezer

</l>
<l>Lord until my love come down



</l>
<l>I like your apple on your tree, I'm crazy about your peaches too

</l>
<l>I'm crazy about your fruit baby, 'cause you know just how to do

</l>
<l>Now please let me be your lemon squeezer (yes my Lord!)

</l>
<l>Now while's I'm in your lonesome town

</l>
<l>Now you let me be your lemon squeezer

</l>
<l>Lord until my love come down



</l>
<l>Now and it ain't but the one thing baby, now that'll really make me
cry (what, man?)

</l>
<l>I asked you about your lemons baby, and you upped and tell me a
lie

</l>
<l>Now please let me be your lemon squeezer

</l>
<l>Now while's I'm in your lonesome town

</l>
<l>Now I want you let me be your lemon squeezer

</l>
<l>Lord until my love come down</l></lyrics></xml>
