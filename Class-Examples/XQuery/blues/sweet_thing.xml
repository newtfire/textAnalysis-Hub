<lyrics>



When I first met you baby, honey you were almost out of school

When I first met you baby, honey you were almost out of school

You were real wild then woman, honey, but you were nobody's fool



I was so in love with you baby and I tried to get you to love me
too

I was so in love with you baby and I tried to get you to love me
too

I thought you had no time for me then woman, wouldn't do anything you
asked me to



Oh, sweet thing, you are all I want to see

Oh, sweet thing, you are all I want to see

I having so much trouble baby, I wonder what's gonna happen to me
