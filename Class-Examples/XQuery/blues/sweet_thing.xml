<l>When I first met you baby, honey you were almost out of school

</l>
<l>When I first met you baby, honey you were almost out of school

</l>
<l>You were real wild then woman, honey, but you were nobody's fool



</l>
<l>I was so in love with you baby and I tried to get you to love me
too

</l>
<l>I was so in love with you baby and I tried to get you to love me
too

</l>
<l>I thought you had no time for me then woman, wouldn't do anything you

asked me to




</l>
<l>Oh, sweet thing, you are all I want to see

</l>
<l>Oh, sweet thing, you are all I want to see

</l>
<l>I having so much trouble baby, I wonder what's gonna happen to me</l></lyrics></xml>
