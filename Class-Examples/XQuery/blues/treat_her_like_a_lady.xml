<lyrics>



All my friends had to ask me

Sump'in they didn't understand

How I get, all the womens

In the palm of my hand



I told 'em treat her like a lady

Do the best you can do

You gotta treat her like a lady

An' she'll give in to you

Oh, you can see, you know what I mean



I know you heard that the woman

Soon take advantage-a you

Let me tell you, my friend

There just ain't no substitute



You oughta treat her like a lady

Do the best you can do

You gotta treat her like a lady

(Treat her like, you gotta, gotta treat her like)

She'll give in to you

Whoa, you can see, you know what I mean



Oh, you've got to love her (love her)

And tease her (tease her)

But most of all you've got to please her (yeah)



You've got to hold her (hold her)

And want her (want her)

And make her feel you'll always need her

(Yeah, yeah, yeah!)



You know a woman, is sentimental

And so easy to upset (yea-eah-eah!)

So make her feel, that she's for real

And she'll give you happiness

Whoa oh oh, strange as it seem

You know you can't treat a woman mean



So my friends (treat her like)

There you have it (treat her like)

Said it's the easy (treat her like)

Simple way (treat her like)



If ya fail (treat her like)

To do this (treat her like)

Don't blame her (treat her like)

If she look my way (treat her like)



'Cause I'm gonna treat her like a lady

So eventually,

I'm gonna treat her like a lady

(Got to, got to treat her like)

She'll give in to me

Oh you can see, you know what I mean



Yeah you've got to treat her like a lady

Do the best you can do

You gotta treat her like a lady

(Treat her like, got to, got to treat her like)

And she'll give in to you



(Treat her like, got to, got to treat her like)

(Treat her like, got to, got to treat her like)

(Treat her like, got to, got to treat her like)

(Treat her like, got to, got to treat her like)

(Treat her like, got to, got to treat her like)

(Treat her like, got to, got to treat her like)

(Treat her like, got to, got to treat her like)

Fading:

(Treat her like)
