<l>Oh Lordie Lord

</l>
<l>Oh Lordie Lord

</l>
<l>It hurts me so bad for us to part

</l>
<l>But someday baby, I ain't gonna worry my life anymore



</l>
<l>So many nights since you've been gone

</l>
<l>I've had to worry and grieve my life alone

</l>
<l>But someday baby, I ain't gonna worry my life anymore



</l>
<l>So many days since you went away

</l>
<l>I've had to worry night and day

</l>
<l>But someday baby, I ain't gonna worry my life anymore



</l>
<l>Yoo're on my mind every place I go

</l>
<l>How much I love you nobody knows

</l>
<l>But someday baby, I ain't gonna worry my life anymore



</l>
<l>So that's my story

</l>
<l>This is all I got to say to you

</l>
<l>Goodbye baby I don't care what you do

</l>
<l>But someday baby, I ain't gonna worry my life anymore



</l>
<l>Oh Lordie Lord

</l>
<l>Oh Lordie Lord

</l>
<l>It hurts me so bad for us to part

</l>
<l>But someday baby, I ain't gonna worry my life anymore</l></lyrics></xml>
