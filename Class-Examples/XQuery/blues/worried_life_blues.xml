<lyrics>



Oh Lordie Lord

Oh Lordie Lord

It hurts me so bad for us to part

But someday baby, I ain't gonna worry my life anymore



So many nights since you've been gone

I've had to worry and grieve my life alone

But someday baby, I ain't gonna worry my life anymore



So many days since you went away

I've had to worry night and day

But someday baby, I ain't gonna worry my life anymore



Yoo're on my mind every place I go

How much I love you nobody knows

But someday baby, I ain't gonna worry my life anymore



So that's my story

This is all I got to say to you

Goodbye baby I don't care what you do

But someday baby, I ain't gonna worry my life anymore



Oh Lordie Lord

Oh Lordie Lord

It hurts me so bad for us to part

But someday baby, I ain't gonna worry my life anymore
