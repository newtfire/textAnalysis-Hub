<lyrics>


<l>Now I walked into a beer tavern

</l>
<l>To give a girl a nice time

</l>
<l>When I entered I had forty-five dollars

</l>
<l>When I left I had one dime



</l>
<l>Wasn't that a beer drinkin' woman

</l>
<l>Don't you know, man don't you know

</l>
<l>She was a beer drinkin' woman

</l>
<l>I don't want to see her no more



</l>
<l>Now when I spent down to my last dime

</l>
<l>She says, "Daddy I know you're not through"

</l>
<l>I told her, "Yes, baby doll and the diploma belongs to you"



</l>
<l>Wasn't that a beer drinkin' woman

</l>
<l>Don't you know, man don't you know

</l>
<l>She was a beer drinkin' woman

</l>
<l>And I don't want to see her no more



</l>
<l>She would often say, "Excuse me a minute,

</l>
<l>I've got to step around here"

</l>
<l>And every time she'd come back

</l>
<l>She'd say, "I want another quart of beer"



</l>
<l>Wasn't that a beer drinkin' woman

</l>
<l>Don't you know, man don't you know

</l>
<l>Boy, she was the toughest I met

</l>
<l>Lord, she was a beer drinkin' woman

</l>
<l>I don't want to see her no more



</l>
<l>I say, "I've got to step off baby,

</l>
<l>anything else you would like?"

</l>
<l>She said, "Daddy I'll keep this table,

</l>
<l>If you promise me you'll be back"



</l>
<l>You know that was a beer drinkin' woman

</l>
<l>Don't you know, man don't you know?

</l>
<l>She was a beer drinkin' woman

</l>
<l>I don't wanna see her no more



</l>
<l>I says, "I'm sorry baby, but I only have one more dime"

</l>
<l>She said, "Daddy buy me a small bottle of beer,

</l>
<l>so I can concentrate my mind"



</l>
<l>Wasn't that a beer drinkin' woman?

</l>
<l>Don't you know, man don't you know

</l>
<l>Lord, she was a beer drinkin' woman

</l>
<l>I don't wanna see her no more</l></lyrics></xml>
