<lyrics>



Now I walked into a beer tavern

To give a girl a nice time

When I entered I had forty-five dollars

When I left I had one dime



Wasn't that a beer drinkin' woman

Don't you know, man don't you know

She was a beer drinkin' woman

I don't want to see her no more



Now when I spent down to my last dime

She says, "Daddy I know you're not through"

I told her, "Yes, baby doll and the diploma belongs to you"



Wasn't that a beer drinkin' woman

Don't you know, man don't you know

She was a beer drinkin' woman

And I don't want to see her no more



She would often say, "Excuse me a minute,

I've got to step around here"

And every time she'd come back

She'd say, "I want another quart of beer"



Wasn't that a beer drinkin' woman

Don't you know, man don't you know

Boy, she was the toughest I met

Lord, she was a beer drinkin' woman

I don't want to see her no more



I say, "I've got to step off baby,

anything else you would like?"

She said, "Daddy I'll keep this table,

If you promise me you'll be back"



You know that was a beer drinkin' woman

Don't you know, man don't you know?

She was a beer drinkin' woman

I don't wanna see her no more



I says, "I'm sorry baby, but I only have one more dime"

She said, "Daddy buy me a small bottle of beer,

so I can concentrate my mind"



Wasn't that a beer drinkin' woman?

Don't you know, man don't you know

Lord, she was a beer drinkin' woman

I don't wanna see her no more
