 <l>Well I'm dyin' with the flu, oh, an' I don't know what to do</l>
 <l>Well</l>
            <l>I'm dyin' with the flu, oh, an' I don't know what to do</l>
 <l>Well my doctor gave</l>
            <l>me up, he said, "I can't do no more for you"</l>

            
 <l>Please call my girlfriend, tell her I'm goin' on home</l>
 <l>Yes, please</l>
            <l>call my girlfriend, tell her I'm goin' on home</l>
 <l>Yeah, you tell 'em that flu</l>
            <l>is chillin', an' I don't want her to weep an' moan</l>
 <l>Alright</l>

 <l>Well I hate to leave this old</l>
            <l>world but I found out what dyin' is all about</l>
