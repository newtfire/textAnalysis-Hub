<lyrics>


<l>When you've got no more assurance

</l>
<l>Than a great big hunk of lead

</l>
<l>If you don't respond to romance

</l>
<l>Jack, you're dead!



</l>
<l>When a chick is smiling at you

</l>
<l>Even though there's nothing said

</l>
<l>If you stand there like a statue

</l>
<l>Jack, you're dead!



</l>
<l>You've been always kicking

</l>
<l>But you stubbed your toes

</l>
<l>When you ups and kicks the bucket

</l>
<l>Just like old man Mose



</l>
<l>When you get no kicks from loving

</l>
<l>And you blow your top instead

</l>
<l>It's a fact that you ain't living

</l>
<l>Jack, you're dead!



</l>
<l>If you just ain't got nobody

</l>
<l>Since you've gone and lost your head

</l>
<l>Rigor Mortis has set in daddy

</l>
<l>Jack, you're dead!



</l>
<l>What's the use of having muscles

</l>
<l>When your life hangs by a thread

</l>
<l>If you ain't got no red corpuscles

</l>
<l>Jack, you're dead!









</l>
<l>You've been always kicking

</l>
<l>But you stubbed your toes

</l>
<l>When you ups and kicks the bucket

</l>
<l>Just like old man Mose



</l>
<l>When you get no kicks from loving

</l>
<l>And the news begins to spread

</l>
<l>All the cats will holler, "Murder!"

</l>
<l>Jack, you're dead!

</l>
<l>All the breaths leaked out of you

</l>
<l>When your friends gather round the bed

</l>
<l>And look at you and say, "Um, um, um, don't he look natural"

</l>
<l>When that happens to you, daddy

</l>
<l>Jack, you're dead!</l></lyrics></xml>
