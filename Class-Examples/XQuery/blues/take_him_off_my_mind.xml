<lyrics>


<l>I've cried and I worries, all night I lays and groan

</l>
<l>I've cried and I worries, all night I lays and groan

</l>
<l>I used to weigh two hundred, now I'm down to skin and bones



</l>
<l>It's all about my man, who has always kicked and dogged me around

</l>
<l>It's all about my man, who's always kicked and dogged me around

</l>
<l>I've tried my best to kill him, but when I do my love comes down



</l>
<l>I've gone to the gypsy, and beggin' on my bended knees

</l>
<l>I've gone to the gypsy, beggin' on my bended knees

</l>
<l>That man put somethin' on me, oh won't you take it off me please



</l>
<l>It starts at my forehead and goes clean on down to my toes

</l>
<l>It starts at my forehead and goes clean on down to my toes

</l>
<l>Oh how I've suffered gypsy, nobody but the good Lord knows



</l>
<l>So fix him for me gypsy, lay your money on the line

</l>
<l>Just fix him for me gypsy, I lay your money on the line

</l>
<l>Just fix him so he will love me, but please take him off my mind</l></lyrics></xml>
