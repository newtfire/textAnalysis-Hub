<lyrics>



I've cried and I worries, all night I lays and groan

I've cried and I worries, all night I lays and groan

I used to weigh two hundred, now I'm down to skin and bones



It's all about my man, who has always kicked and dogged me around

It's all about my man, who's always kicked and dogged me around

I've tried my best to kill him, but when I do my love comes down



I've gone to the gypsy, and beggin' on my bended knees

I've gone to the gypsy, beggin' on my bended knees

That man put somethin' on me, oh won't you take it off me please



It starts at my forehead and goes clean on down to my toes

It starts at my forehead and goes clean on down to my toes

Oh how I've suffered gypsy, nobody but the good Lord knows



So fix him for me gypsy, lay your money on the line

Just fix him for me gypsy, I lay your money on the line

Just fix him so he will love me, but please take him off my mind
