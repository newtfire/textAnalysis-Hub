<lyrics>


<l>I was with you, baby, when you didn't have a dime

</l>
<l>I was with you, baby, when you didn't have a dime

</l>
<l>Now since you got a lot of money, you have thrown a good gal down



</l>
<l>Once ain't for always and two ain't for twice

</l>
<l>Once ain't for always and two ain't for twice

</l>
<l>When you get a good gal, you'd better treat her nice



</l>
<l>When you were lonesome, I treated you kind

</l>
<l>When you were lonesome, I treated you kind

</l>
<l>But since you've got money, it has changed your mind



</l>
<l>I'm goin' to leave you, baby, and I ain't goin' to say goodbye

</l>
<l>I'm goin' to leave you, baby, and I ain't goin' to say goodbye

</l>
<l>But I'll write you a letter and tell you the reason why



</l>
<l>Days are lonesome, nights are so long

</l>
<l>Days are lonesome, nights are so long

</l>
<l>I'm a good gal, but I just been treated wrong</l></lyrics></xml>
