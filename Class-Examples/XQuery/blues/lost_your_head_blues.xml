<lyrics>



I was with you, baby, when you didn't have a dime

I was with you, baby, when you didn't have a dime

Now since you got a lot of money, you have thrown a good gal down



Once ain't for always and two ain't for twice

Once ain't for always and two ain't for twice

When you get a good gal, you'd better treat her nice



When you were lonesome, I treated you kind

When you were lonesome, I treated you kind

But since you've got money, it has changed your mind



I'm goin' to leave you, baby, and I ain't goin' to say goodbye

I'm goin' to leave you, baby, and I ain't goin' to say goodbye

But I'll write you a letter and tell you the reason why



Days are lonesome, nights are so long

Days are lonesome, nights are so long

I'm a good gal, but I just been treated wrong
