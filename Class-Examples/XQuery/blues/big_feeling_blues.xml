<l>Ma:

</l>
<l>"All these many years I've been pleadin' for a man

</l>
<l>How come I can't get me a real 
monkey
man
?

</l>
<l>I'm not no triflin'
1
woman </l>

<l>I've been lookin' for a man I can call my own

</l>
<l>Been married many times but they left my home

</l>
<l>Ah, big feelin' blues, worst I ever had

</l>
<l>I've got the big feelin' blues I mean I've got them bad"



</l>
<l>Charlie

:

</l>
<l>"If you're lookin' for a brown, come get this chocolate cream

</l>
<l>I'm a big kid-man - just out of my teens"



</l>
<l>Ma:

</l>
<l>"Ah, big feelin' blues, worst I ever had

</l>
<l>I've got them big feelin' blues, I mean I've got them bad"



</l>
<l>"Unlucky with my yellow, unlucky with my brown,

</l>
<l>the black bitches keep on throwin' me down'

</l>
<l>"Ah, big feelin' blues, worst I've ever had

</l>
<l>I've got the big feelin' blues, I mean I've got them bad"



</l>
<l>Charlie:

</l>
<l>"If you need a good man why don't you try me?

</l>
<l>I sure can put you out of your misery"



</l>
<l>Ma:

</l>
<l>"Ah, big feelin' blues, worst I've ever had

</l>
<l>I've got the big feelin' blues, I mean I've got them bad

</l>
<l>There's a whole lot left, what's left is good

</l>
<l>Give me a chance, honey, I'll make you change your neighbourhood

</l>
<l>Ah, big feelin' blues, worst I've ever had,

</l>
<l>I've got the big feelin' blues, I mean I've got them bad"
