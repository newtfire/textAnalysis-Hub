<lyrics>



Ma:

"All these many years I've been pleadin' for a man

How come I can't get me a real 
monkey
man
?

I'm not no triflin'
1
 woman



I've been lookin' for a man I can call my own

Been married many times but they left my home

Ah, big feelin' blues, worst I ever had

I've got the big feelin' blues I mean I've got them bad"



Charlie
2
:

"If you're lookin' for a brown, come get this chocolate cream

I'm a big kid-man - just out of my teens"



Ma:

"Ah, big feelin' blues, worst I ever had

I've got them big feelin' blues, I mean I've got them bad"



"Unlucky with my yellow, unlucky with my brown,

the black bitches keep on throwin' me down'

"Ah, big feelin' blues, worst I've ever had

I've got the big feelin' blues, I mean I've got them bad"



Charlie:

"If you need a good man why don't you try me?

I sure can put you out of your misery"



Ma:

"Ah, big feelin' blues, worst I've ever had

I've got the big feelin' blues, I mean I've got them bad

There's a whole lot left, what's left is good

Give me a chance, honey, I'll make you change your neighbourhood

Ah, big feelin' blues, worst I've ever had,

I've got the big feelin' blues, I mean I've got them bad"
