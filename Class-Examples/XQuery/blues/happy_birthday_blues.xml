<lyrics>



Baby lights her cigarette

And takes a look around

She says that morning sun

Sure does get her down

Nothing else to see

Just to help her lose

Those happy birthday blues



Grandpa takes a drink of wine

And tells it like it was

Tells me all he wants to do

Is what everybody does

Say he'd give the world

For a little girl

Just to help him lose

Those happy birthday blues



Happy birthday blues

Happy birthday blues

Got to pay your dues

Those happy birthday blues



In and out and on and on

Everybody goes

And where the fun with finally stops

Everybody knows

Girls it's me and you

Doing what we do

Just one way to lose

Those happy birthday blues
