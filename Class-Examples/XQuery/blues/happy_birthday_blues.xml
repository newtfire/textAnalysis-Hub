<lyrics>


<l>Baby lights her cigarette

</l>
<l>And takes a look around

</l>
<l>She says that morning sun

</l>
<l>Sure does get her down

</l>
<l>Nothing else to see

</l>
<l>Just to help her lose

</l>
<l>Those happy birthday blues



</l>
<l>Grandpa takes a drink of wine

</l>
<l>And tells it like it was

</l>
<l>Tells me all he wants to do

</l>
<l>Is what everybody does

</l>
<l>Say he'd give the world

</l>
<l>For a little girl

</l>
<l>Just to help him lose

</l>
<l>Those happy birthday blues



</l>
<l>Happy birthday blues

</l>
<l>Happy birthday blues

</l>
<l>Got to pay your dues

</l>
<l>Those happy birthday blues



</l>
<l>In and out and on and on

</l>
<l>Everybody goes

</l>
<l>And where the fun with finally stops

</l>
<l>Everybody knows

</l>
<l>Girls it's me and you

</l>
<l>Doing what we do

</l>
<l>Just one way to lose

</l><l>Those happy birthday blues</l></lyrics></xml>
