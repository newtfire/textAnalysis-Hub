<lyrics>


<l>Lord, when you get home, baby, please write me a few of your
lines

</l>
<l>Lord, when you get home, baby, sit down and write me a few of your
lines

</l>
<l>Lord, that'd be consolation, Lord mama, to my worried mind



</l>
<l>Lord, I left my baby, standing in our back door cryin'

</l>
<l>Lord, I left my baby, standing alone in our back door cryin'

</l>
<l>Lord, I never felt so sorry no, honey, till she said goodbye



</l>
<l>Lord, I'm going down to the river, I'm gonna sit on the ground

</l>
<l>You know, I'm going down to the river, baby, I'm gonna sit on the
ground

</l>
<l>I'm gonna let the waves of water, Lord, wash my troubles down</l></lyrics></xml>
