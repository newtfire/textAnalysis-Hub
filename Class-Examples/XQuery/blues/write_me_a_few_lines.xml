<lyrics>



Lord, when you get home, baby, please write me a few of your
lines

Lord, when you get home, baby, sit down and write me a few of your
lines

Lord, that'd be consolation, Lord mama, to my worried mind



Lord, I left my baby, standing in our back door cryin'

Lord, I left my baby, standing alone in our back door cryin'

Lord, I never felt so sorry no, honey, till she said goodbye



Lord, I'm going down to the river, I'm gonna sit on the ground

You know, I'm going down to the river, baby, I'm gonna sit on the
ground

I'm gonna let the waves of water, Lord, wash my troubles down
