<lyrics>

<l>One day every week, I prop myself at my front door

</l>
<l>One day every week, I prop myself at my front door

</l>
<l>And the police force couldn't move me 'fore that mail man blow



</l>
<l>'T'was a little white paper Uncle Sam had done addressed to me

</l>
<l>'T'was a little white paper Uncle Sam had done addressed to me

</l>
<l>It meant one more week, one week of sweet prosperity



</l>
<l>But bad news got to spreading, and my poor hair started turning
grey

</l>
<l>But bad news got to spreading, and my poor hair started turning
grey

</l>
<l>'Cause Uncle Sam started chopping, cutting thousands off the
W.P.A.
1



</l>
<l>Just a little pink slip, in a long white envelope

</l>
<l>Just a little pink slip, in a long white envelope

</l>
<l>Was the end of my road, was the last ray of my only hope



</l>
<l>After four long years, Uncle Sam done put me on the shelf

</l>
<l>After four long years, Uncle Sam done put me on the shelf

</l>
<l>'Cause that little pink slip means you got to go for yourself
