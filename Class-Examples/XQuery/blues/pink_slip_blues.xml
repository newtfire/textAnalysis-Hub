<lyrics>



One day every week, I prop myself at my front door

One day every week, I prop myself at my front door

And the police force couldn't move me 'fore that mail man blow



'T'was a little white paper Uncle Sam had done addressed to me

'T'was a little white paper Uncle Sam had done addressed to me

It meant one more week, one week of sweet prosperity



But bad news got to spreading, and my poor hair started turning
grey

But bad news got to spreading, and my poor hair started turning
grey

'Cause Uncle Sam started chopping, cutting thousands off the
W.P.A.
1



Just a little pink slip, in a long white envelope

Just a little pink slip, in a long white envelope

Was the end of my road, was the last ray of my only hope



After four long years, Uncle Sam done put me on the shelf

After four long years, Uncle Sam done put me on the shelf

'Cause that little pink slip means you got to go for yourself
