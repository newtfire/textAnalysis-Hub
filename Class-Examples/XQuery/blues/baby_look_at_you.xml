<lyrics>



Well, baby, baby, baby look at you

Yes, I said, "Baby, baby, baby, baby look at you"

Well, you want to jump on me and hurt me

'Cause I won't let you tell me what to do



Well, when I first met you baby

You didn't know what love is about

You was standin' on the streets beggin'

And ragged as a barrel of sauerkraut



Baby, baby, baby look at you

Well now, you want to jump on me and hurt me

'Cause I won't let you tell me what to do



Well, you said once that you loved me,

I would always be your own

And now you got your hands on some money, baby,

and you're drivin' B.B. away from home



Well, you said that you loved me,

I always would be your man

Now you thrown me outdoors,

and said, "Go and do the best you can"
