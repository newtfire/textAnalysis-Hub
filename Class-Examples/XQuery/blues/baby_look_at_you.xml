<lyrics>


<l>Well, baby, baby, baby look at you

</l>
<l>Yes, I said, "Baby, baby, baby, baby look at you"

</l>
<l>Well, you want to jump on me and hurt me

</l>
<l>'Cause I won't let you tell me what to do



</l>
<l>Well, when I first met you baby

</l>
<l>You didn't know what love is about

</l>
<l>You was standin' on the streets beggin'

</l>
<l>And ragged as a barrel of sauerkraut



</l>
<l>Baby, baby, baby look at you

</l>
<l>Well now, you want to jump on me and hurt me

</l>
<l>'Cause I won't let you tell me what to do



</l>
<l>Well, you said once that you loved me,

</l>
<l>I would always be your own

</l>
<l>And now you got your hands on some money, baby,

</l>
<l>and you're drivin' B.B. away from home



</l>
<l>Well, you said that you loved me,

</l>
<l>I always would be your man

</l>
<l>Now you thrown me outdoors,

</l>
<l>and said, "Go and do the best you can"</l></lyrics></xml>
