<lyrics>



How many more years, have I got to let you dog me around

How many more years, have I got to let you dog me around

I'd soon rather be dead, sleeping six feet in the ground



I'm gonna fall on my knees, I'm gonna raise up my right hand

I'm gonna fall on my knees, I'm gonna raise up my right hand

Say I'd feel much better darling, if you'd just only understand



I'm going upstairs, I'm gonna bring back down my clothes

I'm going upstairs, I'm gonna bring back down my clothes, do them
all

If anybody ask about me, just tell'em I walked out on



__________

Note: Wolf's first phonograph recording, made in Memphis in 1950, and
released on the Chess record label. The 78 RPM record "How Many More
Years and Moanin' at Midnight" sold 60,000 copies, a major hit at
that time.
