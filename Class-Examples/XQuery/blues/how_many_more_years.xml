<l>How many more years, have I got to let you dog me around

</l>
<l>How many more years, have I got to let you dog me around

</l>
<l>I'd soon rather be dead, sleeping six feet in the ground



</l>
<l>I'm gonna fall on my knees, I'm gonna raise up my right hand

</l>
<l>I'm gonna fall on my knees, I'm gonna raise up my right hand

</l>
<l>Say I'd feel much better darling, if you'd just only understand



</l>
<l>I'm going upstairs, I'm gonna bring back down my clothes

</l>
<l>I'm going upstairs, I'm gonna bring back down my clothes, do them
all

</l>
<l>If anybody ask about me, just tell'em I walked out on



</l>

<note>Note: Wolf's first phonograph recording, made in Memphis in 1950, and
released on the Chess record label. The 78 RPM record "How Many More
Years and Moanin' at Midnight" sold 60,000 copies, a major hit at
that time.</note></lyrics></xml>
