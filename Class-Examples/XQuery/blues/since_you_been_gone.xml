<lyrics>


<l>I lost a good woman, and I grieve both night and day

</l>
<l>I lost a good woman, and I grieve both night and day

</l>
<l>I get the blues for my baby, ever since she been gone away



</l>
<l>I'm so unhappy, mama, when I used to be so gay

</l>
<l>I'm so unhappy, baby, when I used to be so gay

</l>
<l>I get the blues for my baby, ever since she been gone away



</l>
<l>I watches the sun when it rises, until it fade away

</l>
<l>I watch the sun when it rises, until it fade away

</l>
<l>I get the blues for my baby, ever since she been gone away



</l>
<l>Yeah, boy!



</l>
<l>Just as long as I live, babe you will always hear me say

</l>
<l>Just as long as I live, mama, you will always hear me say

</l>
<l>I get the blues for my baby, ever since she been gone away</l></lyrics></xml>
