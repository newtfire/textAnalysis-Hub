<lyrics>



I lost a good woman, and I grieve both night and day

I lost a good woman, and I grieve both night and day

I get the blues for my baby, ever since she been gone away



I'm so unhappy, mama, when I used to be so gay

I'm so unhappy, baby, when I used to be so gay

I get the blues for my baby, ever since she been gone away



I watches the sun when it rises, until it fade away

I watch the sun when it rises, until it fade away

I get the blues for my baby, ever since she been gone away



Yeah, boy!



Just as long as I live, babe you will always hear me say

Just as long as I live, mama, you will always hear me say

I get the blues for my baby, ever since she been gone away
