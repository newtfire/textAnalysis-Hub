<lyrics>


<l>You're gonna be mine, little girl, you've been through 18
years of pain

</l>
<l>You're gonna be mine, little girl, you've been through 18 years of
pain

</l>
<l>I'm gonna give you a love, child, you won't feel bad again



</l>
<l>You've been mistreated, little girl, but I swear, I swear it'll be
outgrown

</l>
<l>You've been mistreated, little girl, but I swear, I swear it'll be
outgrown

</l>
<l>I'm gonna give you a love, child, something you've never known



</l>
<l>You're gonna be mine, little girl, even if I can't have you by my
side

</l>
<l>You're gonna be mine, little girl, even if I can't have you by my
side

</l>
<l>You're gonna remember the love, child, that made you satisfied</l></lyrics></xml>
