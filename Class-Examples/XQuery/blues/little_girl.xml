<lyrics>



You're gonna be mine, little girl, you've been through 18
years of pain

You're gonna be mine, little girl, you've been through 18 years of
pain

I'm gonna give you a love, child, you won't feel bad again



You've been mistreated, little girl, but I swear, I swear it'll be
outgrown

You've been mistreated, little girl, but I swear, I swear it'll be
outgrown

I'm gonna give you a love, child, something you've never known



You're gonna be mine, little girl, even if I can't have you by my
side

You're gonna be mine, little girl, even if I can't have you by my
side

You're gonna remember the love, child, that made you satisfied
