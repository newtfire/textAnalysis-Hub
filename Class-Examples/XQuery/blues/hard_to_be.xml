<l>It's hard to be

</l>
<l>It's hard for me to keep arm's length from my baby

</l>
<l>Can't you see, when I'm away from her it sho' nuff drives me
crazy

</l>
<l>Something inside of me, when she's gone I miss her so

</l>
<l>I wanna tell her how I feel, just gotta let her know

</l>
<l>When I'm alone with her, and she's in my arms I'm in heaven



</l>
<l>It's all I see, in my dreams, we'll be happy together

</l>
<l>Side by side, I hope that our love will stay this way forever

</l>
<l>Something inside of me, got a feelin' that won't let go

</l>
<l>I wanna tell her how I feel, I just gotta let her know

</l>
<l>Lookin' through her eyes, I see a paradise, no mistake she's full of

fire




</l>
<l>Like a real live wire, a house on fire

</l>
<l>She's my burnin', she's my burnin', burnin' desire

</l>
<l>Well it's hard to be, it's hard for me to keep arm's length from my
baby

</l>
<l>Oh can't you see, when I'm away from her it sho' nuff drives me
crazy

</l>
<l>Something inside of me, when she's gone I miss her so

</l>
<l>I wanna tell her how I feel, I just gotta let her know



</l>
<l>When I'm alone with her, and she's in my arms I'm in heaven

</l>
<l>Like a real live wire, a house on fire

</l>
<l>She's my burnin', she's my burnin', burnin' desire

</l>
<l>Hard to be, it's hard for me

</l>
<l>It's hard to keep, keep me from my baby</l></lyrics></xml>
