<lyrics>



It's hard to be

It's hard for me to keep arm's length from my baby

Can't you see, when I'm away from her it sho' nuff drives me
crazy

Something inside of me, when she's gone I miss her so

I wanna tell her how I feel, just gotta let her know

When I'm alone with her, and she's in my arms I'm in heaven



It's all I see, in my dreams, we'll be happy together

Side by side, I hope that our love will stay this way forever

Something inside of me, got a feelin' that won't let go

I wanna tell her how I feel, I just gotta let her know

Lookin' through her eyes, I see a paradise, no mistake she's full of
fire



Like a real live wire, a house on fire

She's my burnin', she's my burnin', burnin' desire

Well it's hard to be, it's hard for me to keep arm's length from my
baby

Oh can't you see, when I'm away from her it sho' nuff drives me
crazy

Something inside of me, when she's gone I miss her so

I wanna tell her how I feel, I just gotta let her know



When I'm alone with her, and she's in my arms I'm in heaven

Like a real live wire, a house on fire

She's my burnin', she's my burnin', burnin' desire

Hard to be, it's hard for me

It's hard to keep, keep me from my baby
