<lyrics>


<l>Forty days and forty nights

</l>
<l>Since my baby left this town

</l>
<l>Sunshinin' all day long

</l>
<l>But the rain keep comin' down

</l>
<l>She's my life I need her so

</l>
<l>Why she left I just don't know



</l>
<l>Forty days and forty nights

</l>
<l>Since I set right down and cried

</l>
<l>Keep rainin' all the time

</l>
<l>But the river is runnin' dry

</l>
<l>Lord help me it just ain't right

</l>
<l>I love that girl with all-a my might



</l>
<l>Forty days and forty nights

</l>
<l>Since my baby broke my heart

</l>
<l>Searchin' for her in a while

</l>
<l>Like a blind man in the dark

</l>
<l>Love can make a poor man rich

</l>
<l>Or break his heart I don't know which



</l>
<l>Forty days and forty nights

</l>
<l>Like a ship out on the sea

</l>
<l>Prayin' for her each night

</l>
<l>That she would come back-a home to me

</l>
<l>Life is love and love is right

</l>
<l>I hope she come back home tonight</l></lyrics></xml>
