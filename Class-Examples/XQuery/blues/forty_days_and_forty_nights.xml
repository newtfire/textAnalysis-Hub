<lyrics>



Forty days and forty nights

Since my baby left this town

Sunshinin' all day long

But the rain keep comin' down

She's my life I need her so

Why she left I just don't know



Forty days and forty nights

Since I set right down and cried

Keep rainin' all the time

But the river is runnin' dry

Lord help me it just ain't right

I love that girl with all-a my might



Forty days and forty nights

Since my baby broke my heart

Searchin' for her in a while

Like a blind man in the dark

Love can make a poor man rich

Or break his heart I don't know which



Forty days and forty nights

Like a ship out on the sea

Prayin' for her each night

That she would come back-a home to me

Life is love and love is right

I hope she come back home tonight
