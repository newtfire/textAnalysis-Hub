<l>You need meat, go to the market

</l>
<l>You need bread, try the bakery

</l>
<l>If you need love, baby

</l>
<l>Don't go no farther

</l>
<l>Just come on home with me



</l>
<l>I got to love somebody

</l>
<l>I got to love somebody

</l>
<l>I got to love somebody

</l>
<l>I want somebody to love me



</l>
<l>You need grits, go to the grocery

</l>
<l>You need fish, go to the sea

</l>
<l>You need love, baby
