<lyrics>



You need meat, go to the market

You need bread, try the bakery

If you need love, baby

Don't go no farther

Just come on home with me



I got to love somebody

I got to love somebody

I got to love somebody

I want somebody to love me



You need grits, go to the grocery

You need fish, go to the sea

You need love, baby

Don't look no farther

Just come on home with me



I got to love somebody

I got to love somebody

I got to love somebody

I want somebody to love me



You need money, go to the bank, dear

You need honey, look for the bees

You need love, baby

Don't go no farther

Just come on home with me



I got to love somebody

I got to love somebody

I got to love somebody

I want somebody to love me



I got to love somebody

I got to love somebody



I got to love somebody

I got to love somebody

I got to love somebody

I want somebody to love me
