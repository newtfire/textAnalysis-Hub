<lyrics>


<l>I would walk two miles on my, hands and knees,

</l>
<l>ain't no doubt about it, baby, it's you I aim to please

</l>
<l>I'd wrestle with a lion and a, grizzly bear,

</l>
<l>it's my life baby but, I don't care



</l>
<l>Ain't that tuff enough?

</l>
<l>Ain't that tuff enough?

</l>
<l>Ain't that tuff enough?

</l>
<l>Ain't that tuff enough?



</l>
<l>For you baby I would, swim the sea,

</l>
<l>nothin' I'd do for you that's too, tough for me

</l>
<l>I'd put out a burnin' building with a, shovel and dirt,

</l>
<l>and not even worry about, getting hurt



</l>
<l>I would work 24 hours, 7 days a week,

</l>
<l>just so I can come home and, kiss your cheek

</l>
<l>I love you in the mornin' and I, love a-you at noon,

</l>
<l>I love you in the night, take you, to the moon



</l>
<l>Lain to buy my burnin' money, that I've earned,

</l>
<l>and not even worry about, gettin' burned

</l>
<l>I'd climb the Empire State, fight Mohammed Ali,

</l>
<l>just to have you baby, close to me</l></lyrics></xml>
