<lyrics>



I would walk two miles on my, hands and knees,

ain't no doubt about it, baby, it's you I aim to please

I'd wrestle with a lion and a, grizzly bear,

it's my life baby but, I don't care



Ain't that tuff enough?

Ain't that tuff enough?

Ain't that tuff enough?

Ain't that tuff enough?



For you baby I would, swim the sea,

nothin' I'd do for you that's too, tough for me

I'd put out a burnin' building with a, shovel and dirt,

and not even worry about, getting hurt



I would work 24 hours, 7 days a week,

just so I can come home and, kiss your cheek

I love you in the mornin' and I, love a-you at noon,

I love you in the night, take you, to the moon



Lain to buy my burnin' money, that I've earned,

and not even worry about, gettin' burned

I'd climb the Empire State, fight Mohammed Ali,

just to have you baby, close to me
