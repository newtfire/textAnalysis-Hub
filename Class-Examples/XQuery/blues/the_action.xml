<lyrics>


<l>Remember when we first met

</l>
<l>I was so excited just to get to know you

</l>
<l>Oh baby just to know you

</l>
<l>I was just a little bit shy

</l>
<l>God willing I was ready

</l>
<l>To try to show you

</l>
<l>Oh just to show you



</l>
<l>I felt a little funny

</l>
<l>But it was really no joke

</l>
<l>I wanted to prove my love

</l>
<l>In every word that I spoke



</l>
<l>(Chorus:)

</l>
<l>But the action

</l>
<l>Speaks louder

</l>
<l>You know the action

</l>
<l>Speaks louder than

</l>
<l>The word

</l>
<l>The action,

</l>
<l>Louder than the word



</l>
<l>I loved you just the way you were

</l>
<l>Somehow I had to find the nerve to tell you

</l>
<l>Oh baby just to tell you

</l>
<l>So I did what a man must do

</l>
<l>I walked right over to you

</l>
<l>And I was asking

</l>
<l>Baby, lets go dancing



</l>
<l>I felt a little guilty

</l>
<l>But I had committed no crime

</l>
<l>I wanted to love you

</l>
<l>Love you and love you

</l>
<l>For a long time



</l>
<l>(Chorus)



</l>
<l>(Bridge:)

</l>
<l>I can't wait until I'm holding you

</l>
<l>And there's no doubt in your mind

</l>
<l>You're the one and only one for me

</l>
<l>Only one for me



</l>
<l>I'm gonna prove my love no matter how long that it takes

</l>
<l>The feelings I have for you they're no mistake



</l>
<l>(Chorus)</l></lyrics></xml>
