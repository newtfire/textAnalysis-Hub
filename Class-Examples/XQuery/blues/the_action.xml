<lyrics>



Remember when we first met

I was so excited just to get to know you

Oh baby just to know you

I was just a little bit shy

God willing I was ready

To try to show you

Oh just to show you



I felt a little funny

But it was really no joke

I wanted to prove my love

In every word that I spoke



(Chorus:)

But the action

Speaks louder

You know the action

Speaks louder than

The word

The action,

Louder than the word



I loved you just the way you were

Somehow I had to find the nerve to tell you

Oh baby just to tell you

So I did what a man must do

I walked right over to you

And I was asking

Baby, lets go dancing



I felt a little guilty

But I had committed no crime

I wanted to love you

Love you and love you

For a long time



(Chorus)



(Bridge:)

I can't wait until I'm holding you

And there's no doubt in your mind

You're the one and only one for me

Only one for me



I'm gonna prove my love no matter how long that it takes

The feelings I have for you they're no mistake



(Chorus)
