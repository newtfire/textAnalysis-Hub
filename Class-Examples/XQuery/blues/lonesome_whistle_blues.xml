<lyrics>



(Woo woo woo woo woo woo)

(Woo woo woo woo woo woo)

(Woo woo woo woo woo woo)



My darlin' left me, didn't even tell me the reason why

Whoa, you packed up an' left me

Didn't even tell me the reason why

Whoa, if I didn't please you baby

Ain't because I didn't try



Well it was long about midnight, when I heard that old lonesome
Cannonball

Well it was long about midnight, when I heard that old lonesome
Cannonball

Well when I think about you baby, tears begin to fall



(Woo woo woo woo woo woo)

(Woo woo woo woo woo woo)

(Woo woo woo woo woo woo)



I've gotta find you baby, if it takes my whole life to track you
down

I've gotta find you baby, if it takes my whole life to track you
down

Well if I don't find you by plane, I'm gonna use my old
bloodhound



(Woo woo woo woo woo woo)

(Fading:)

(Woo woo woo woo woo woo)

(Woo woo woo woo woo woo)
