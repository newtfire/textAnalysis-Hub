<lyrics>


<l>(Woo woo woo woo woo woo)

</l>
<l>(Woo woo woo woo woo woo)

</l>
<l>(Woo woo woo woo woo woo)



</l>
<l>My darlin' left me, didn't even tell me the reason why

</l>
<l>Whoa, you packed up an' left me

</l>
<l>Didn't even tell me the reason why

</l>
<l>Whoa, if I didn't please you baby

</l>
<l>Ain't because I didn't try



</l>
<l>Well it was long about midnight, when I heard that old lonesome
Cannonball

</l>
<l>Well it was long about midnight, when I heard that old lonesome
Cannonball

</l>
<l>Well when I think about you baby, tears begin to fall



</l>
<l>(Woo woo woo woo woo woo)

</l>
<l>(Woo woo woo woo woo woo)

</l>
<l>(Woo woo woo woo woo woo)



</l>
<l>I've gotta find you baby, if it takes my whole life to track you
down

</l>
<l>I've gotta find you baby, if it takes my whole life to track you
down

</l>
<l>Well if I don't find you by plane, I'm gonna use my old

bloodhound




</l>
<l>(Woo woo woo woo woo woo)

</l>
<l>(Fading:)

</l>
<l>(Woo woo woo woo woo woo)

</l>
<l>(Woo woo woo woo woo woo)
