<lyrics>



I wore my .44 so long, I've made my shoulder sore

I wore my .44 so long, I done made my shoulder sore

Well, I'm wondrin' everybody, where'd my baby go



Well, I'm so mad this mornin', I don't know where in the world to
go

Well, I'm so mad this mornin', I don't know where in the world to
go

Well, I'm lookin' for me some money, pawned gun to have some gold
