<lyrics>



Mister radio announcer, please listen to my plea

Mister radio announcer, please listen to my plea

Tune in on your radio, and find my man for me



I think you might find him, walking down some lonely road

I think you might find him, walking down some lonely road

Please call him for me, move my heart this heavy load



Call every station, call every ship at sea

Call every station, call every ship at sea

'Cause I'll give the world, to get him back to me



I walked the floor, till I worn out all my shoes

I walked the floor, till I worn out all my shoes

Announce to the world, I've got those broadcasting blues
