<l>Mister radio announcer, please listen to my plea

</l>
<l>Mister radio announcer, please listen to my plea

</l>
<l>Tune in on your radio, and find my man for me



</l>
<l>I think you might find him, walking down some lonely road

</l>
<l>I think you might find him, walking down some lonely road

</l>
<l>Please call him for me, move my heart this heavy load



</l>
<l>Call every station, call every ship at sea

</l>
<l>Call every station, call every ship at sea

</l>
<l>'Cause I'll give the world, to get him back to me



</l>
<l>I walked the floor, till I worn out all my shoes

</l>
<l>I walked the floor, till I worn out all my shoes

</l>
<l>Announce to the world, I've got those broadcasting blues</l></lyrics></xml>
