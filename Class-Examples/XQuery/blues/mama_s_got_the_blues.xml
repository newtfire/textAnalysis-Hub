<lyrics>



Some people say that the weary blues ain't bad

Some people say the weary blues ain't bad

But it's the worst old feeling that I've ever had

Woke up this morning, with the 
jinx

around my bed

I woke up this morning with the jinx around my bed

I didn't have no daddy to hold my aching head



Brown skin's deceitful, but a yellow man is worse

Brown skin's deceitful, but a yellow man is worse

I'm gonna get myself a black man and play safety first



I got a man in Atlanta, two in Alabama, three in Chattanooga

Four in Cincinnati, five in Mississippi, six in Memphis,
Tennessee

If you don't like my peaches, please let my orchard be
