<l>Some people say that the weary blues ain't bad

</l>
<l>Some people say the weary blues ain't bad

</l>
<l>But it's the worst old feeling that I've ever had

</l>
<l>Woke up this morning, with the 
jinx

</l>
<l>around my bed

</l>
<l>I woke up this morning with the jinx around my bed

</l>
<l>I didn't have no daddy to hold my aching head



</l>
<l>Brown skin's deceitful, but a yellow man is worse

</l>
<l>Brown skin's deceitful, but a yellow man is worse

</l>
<l>I'm gonna get myself a black man and play safety first



</l>
<l>I got a man in Atlanta, two in Alabama, three in Chattanooga

</l>
<l>Four in Cincinnati, five in Mississippi, six in Memphis,
Tennessee

</l>
<l>If you don't like my peaches, please let my orchard be</l></lyrics></xml>
