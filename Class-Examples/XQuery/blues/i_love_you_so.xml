<lyrics>



Oh my darling I was so lonely

Searching for you and for you only

Oh my darling I love you so



Oh my darling my love is true

Longing for you, no one else will do

Oh my darling I love you so



When I first saw you dear I knew you were alone

I said to myself that I'd make you my own

Your brother caught us kissing

I though he would surely tell

Until he started playing those wedding bells



Now my darling I'm yours forever

Don't ever leave me, leave me never

Oh my darling I love you so



Oh yes it's true, now I have you

And best of all I know now

That I'll never have to be blue

Oh baby, I love you so



I mean you, baby
