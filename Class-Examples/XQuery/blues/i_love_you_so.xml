<lyrics>


<l>Oh my darling I was so lonely

</l>
<l>Searching for you and for you only

</l>
<l>Oh my darling I love you so



</l>
<l>Oh my darling my love is true

</l>
<l>Longing for you, no one else will do

</l>
<l>Oh my darling I love you so



</l>
<l>When I first saw you dear I knew you were alone

</l>
<l>I said to myself that I'd make you my own

</l>
<l>Your brother caught us kissing

</l>
<l>I though he would surely tell

</l>
<l>Until he started playing those wedding bells



</l>
<l>Now my darling I'm yours forever

</l>
<l>Don't ever leave me, leave me never

</l>
<l>Oh my darling I love you so



</l>
<l>Oh yes it's true, now I have you

</l>
<l>And best of all I know now

</l>
<l>That I'll never have to be blue

</l>
<l>Oh baby, I love you so



</l>
<l>I mean you, baby</l></lyrics></xml>
