<lyrics>



(Chorus:)

Shame, shame, shame,

shame on me for loving you

Shame, shame, shame,

shame on me for loving you

You came and you went,

what's this poor boy to do



I tried, yes I tried,

and you took everything I owned

I tried, yes I tried,

and you took everything I owned

Oh, little girl I wonder,

was your love to me just on loan



Shame, shame, shame,

shame on me for loving you

Shame, shame, shame,

shame on me for loving you

You came and you went,

what's this poor boy to do
