<l>(Chorus:)

</l>
<l>Shame, shame, shame,

</l>
<l>shame on me for loving you

</l>
<l>Shame, shame, shame,

</l>
<l>shame on me for loving you

</l>
<l>You came and you went,

</l>
<l>what's this poor boy to do



</l>
<l>I tried, yes I tried,

</l>
<l>and you took everything I owned

</l>
<l>I tried, yes I tried,

</l>
<l>and you took everything I owned

</l>
<l>Oh, little girl I wonder,

</l>
<l>was your love to me just on loan



</l>
<l>Shame, shame, shame,

</l>
<l>shame on me for loving you

</l>
<l>Shame, shame, shame,

</l>
<l>shame on me for loving you

</l>
<l>You came and you went,

</l>
<l>what's this poor boy to do</l></lyrics></xml>
