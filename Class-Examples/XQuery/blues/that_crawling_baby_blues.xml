<lyrics>


<l>Heard a baby crying, what do this mama mean

</l>
<l>Heard a baby crying, what do this mama mean

</l>
<l>He's crying 'bout his sweet milk, and she won't feed him Jersey

cream




</l>
<l>Well, he crawled from the fireplace, stopped in the middle of the
floor

</l>
<l>Well, he crawled from the fireplace, stopped in the middle of the
floor

</l>
<l>Says, "Mama, ain't that your second daddy standing back there in the

door?"




</l>
<l>Well she grabbed my baby, spanked him and tried to make her leave him
alone

</l>
<l>Well she grabbed my baby, spanked him and tried to make her leave him
alone

</l>
<l>I tried my best to stop her and she said, "The babe ain't none of

mine"




</l>
<l>The woman rocks the cradle, I declare she rules the home

</l>
<l>The woman rocks the cradle, I declare she rules the home

</l>
<l>Married man rocks some other man's babe, fool thinks he is rockin'

his own
