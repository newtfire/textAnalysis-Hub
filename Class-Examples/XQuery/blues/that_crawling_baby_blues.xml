<lyrics>



Heard a baby crying, what do this mama mean

Heard a baby crying, what do this mama mean

He's crying 'bout his sweet milk, and she won't feed him Jersey
cream



Well, he crawled from the fireplace, stopped in the middle of the
floor

Well, he crawled from the fireplace, stopped in the middle of the
floor

Says, "Mama, ain't that your second daddy standing back there in the
door?"



Well she grabbed my baby, spanked him and tried to make her leave him
alone

Well she grabbed my baby, spanked him and tried to make her leave him
alone

I tried my best to stop her and she said, "The babe ain't none of
mine"



The woman rocks the cradle, I declare she rules the home

The woman rocks the cradle, I declare she rules the home

Married man rocks some other man's babe, fool thinks he is rockin'
his own
