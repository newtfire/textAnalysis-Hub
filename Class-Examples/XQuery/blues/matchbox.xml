<lyrics>





Yeah I'm tired of sighing, tired of worrying you too
But I made up my mind baby, what I'm gonna do
I got my clothes in a matchbox, I'm gonna forget about you

But I tried to tell you many times, but I never could do it
You believe me baby, this time I'm through
I got my clothes in a matchbox, I'm gonna forget about you

Now when things get harder, yeah, and rough on you
Don't try to get me back now baby, 'cause baby I'm through
I got my clothes in a matchbox, gonna forget about you
