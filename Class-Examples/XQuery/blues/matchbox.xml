<lyrics>


<l>Yeah I'm tired of sighing, tired of worrying you too
But I made up my mind baby, what I'm gonna do
I got my clothes in a matchbox, I'm gonna forget about you

</l>
<l>But I tried to tell you many times, but I never could do it
You believe me baby, this time I'm through
I got my clothes in a matchbox, I'm gonna forget about you

</l><l>Now when things get harder, yeah, and rough on you</l>
<l>Don't try to get me back now baby, 'cause baby I'm through</l>
<l>I got my clothes in a matchbox, gonna forget about you</l></lyrics></xml>
