<lyrics>



Corrina, Corrina, where ya been so long?

Tell me Corrina, where ya been so long?

I haven't had no lovin', since you been gone



I love Corrina, I tell the world I do

Well I love Corrina, I tell the world I do

Well I hope some day she will, come to love me too



Corrina, Corrina, where you stay last night?

Tell me Corrina, where you stayed last night?

You came home this mornin', the sun was shinin' bright



I met Corrina, a-way across the sea

Yeah I met Corrina, way across the sea

She wouldn't write me no letter, she didn#180;t care for me



Bye-bye Corrina, I got to leave ya now

Bye-bye Corrina, I got to leave ya now

Well I know you didn#180;t mean it, no good, no how!
