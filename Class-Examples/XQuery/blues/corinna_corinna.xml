</l>
<l>I haven't had no lovin', since you been gone



</l>
<l>I love Corrina, I tell the world I do

</l>
<l>Well I love Corrina, I tell the world I do

</l>
<l>Well I hope some day she will, come to love me too



</l>
<l>Corrina, Corrina, where you stay last night?

</l>
<l>Tell me Corrina, where you stayed last night?

</l>
<l>You came home this mornin', the sun was shinin' bright



</l>
<l>I met Corrina, a-way across the sea

</l>
<l>Yeah I met Corrina, way across the sea

</l>
<l>She wouldn't write me no letter, she didn#180;t care for me



</l>
<l>Bye-bye Corrina, I got to leave ya now

</l>
<l>Bye-bye Corrina, I got to leave ya now
