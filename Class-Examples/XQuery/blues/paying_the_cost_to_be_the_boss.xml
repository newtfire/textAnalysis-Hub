<lyrics>


<l>You act like you to don't wanna listen,

</l>
<l>when I'm talking to you

</l>
<l>You think you outta be my baby,

</l>
<l>anything you wanna do



</l>
<l>You must be crazy, baby,

</l>
<l>you just gotta be out of your mind

</l>
<l>As long as payin' I'm the bills, woman,

</l>
<l>I'm payin' the cost to be the boss



</l>
<l>I'll drink if I wanna,

</l>
<l>and play a little poker too

</l>
<l>Don't you say nothing to me,

</l>
<l>as long as I'm taking care of you

</l>
<l>As long as I'm working baby,

</l>
<l>and payin' all the bills

</l>
<l>I don't want no mouth from you,

</l>
<l>about the way I'm supposed to leave



</l>
<l>You must be crazy, woman,

</l>
<l>you just gotta be out of your mind

</l>
<l>As long as I'm footin' the bills,

</l>
<l>I'm paying the cost to be the boss



</l>
<l>Now that you got me,

</l>
<l>you act like you are a shame

</l>
<l>You don't act like my woman,

</l>
<l>you just using my name



</l>
<l>I tell you I'll gonna handle all the money,

</l>
<l>and I don't wanna no back talk

</l>
<l>'Cause if you don't like the way I'm doing,

</l>
<l>just pick up your things and walk



</l>
<l>You must be crazy baby,

</l>
<l>you just gotta be out of your mind

</l>
<l>As long as paying the bills,

</l>
<l>I'm paying the cost to be the boss</l></lyrics></xml>
