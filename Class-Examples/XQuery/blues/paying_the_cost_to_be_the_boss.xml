<lyrics>



You act like you to don't wanna listen,

when I'm talking to you

You think you outta be my baby,

anything you wanna do



You must be crazy, baby,

you just gotta be out of your mind

As long as payin' I'm the bills, woman,

I'm payin' the cost to be the boss



I'll drink if I wanna,

and play a little poker too

Don't you say nothing to me,

as long as I'm taking care of you

As long as I'm working baby,

and payin' all the bills

I don't want no mouth from you,

about the way I'm supposed to leave



You must be crazy, woman,

you just gotta be out of your mind

As long as I'm footin' the bills,

I'm paying the cost to be the boss



Now that you got me,

you act like you are a shame

You don't act like my woman,

you just using my name



I tell you I'll gonna handle all the money,

and I don't wanna no back talk

'Cause if you don't like the way I'm doing,

just pick up your things and walk



You must be crazy baby,

you just gotta be out of your mind

As long as paying the bills,

I'm paying the cost to be the boss
