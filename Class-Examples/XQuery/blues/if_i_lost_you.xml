<lyrics>



Hey, you're the greatest thing in my life, baby

Oh, without your love baby, I don't know just what I'll do

Oh, years of loving you, you've been so true

I believe I'd lose my mind if I lost you



Oh, I guess I've been lucky to have someone so dear

To talk and laugh and always bring me cheer

Oh, after all of this years, you've been so true to me baby

I believe I'd lose my mind if I lost you



Oh, after all the lies I've told you

Just like givin' you, givin' you the stars

Oh, buying you mink coats, mink coats and diamonds

Money in the bank and each year, each year two brand new cars



Hey, you've the greatest thing in my life baby

Oh, between me and you, I've know I got the best deal

Oh, let me thank you, thank you baby

You've been so true I'd lose my mind if I lost you
