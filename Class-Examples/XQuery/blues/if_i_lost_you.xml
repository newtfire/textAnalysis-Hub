<lyrics>


<l>Hey, you're the greatest thing in my life, baby

</l>
<l>Oh, without your love baby, I don't know just what I'll do

</l>
<l>Oh, years of loving you, you've been so true

</l>
<l>I believe I'd lose my mind if I lost you



</l>
<l>Oh, I guess I've been lucky to have someone so dear

</l>
<l>To talk and laugh and always bring me cheer

</l>
<l>Oh, after all of this years, you've been so true to me baby

</l>
<l>I believe I'd lose my mind if I lost you



</l>
<l>Oh, after all the lies I've told you

</l>
<l>Just like givin' you, givin' you the stars

</l>
<l>Oh, buying you mink coats, mink coats and diamonds

</l>
<l>Money in the bank and each year, each year two brand new cars



</l>
<l>Hey, you've the greatest thing in my life baby

</l>
<l>Oh, between me and you, I've know I got the best deal

</l>
<l>Oh, let me thank you, thank you baby

</l>
<l>You've been so true I'd lose my mind if I lost you</l></lyrics></xml>
