<l>Daddy, you've been doggone sweet on me, daddy, you the only
one I see

</l>
<l>You know I need but you 'cause you my man, you can love me like no
one can

</l>
<l>Something 'bout you I can't resist, and when you kiss me, daddy, I

stay kissed




</l>
<l>Now, daddy, squeeze me, squeeze me again, oh, daddy don't stop till I
tell you when

</l>
<l>Now, daddy squeeze me, kiss me some more, oh, Lord, like you did

before




</l>
<l>Your papa cupid is standing close by

</l>
<l>Now, daddy, don't let sweet baby cry

</l>
<l>Pick me up on your knee

</l>
<l>I just git so, you know, when you squeeze me
