<lyrics>



Daddy, you've been doggone sweet on me, daddy, you the only
one I see

You know I need but you 'cause you my man, you can love me like no
one can

Something 'bout you I can't resist, and when you kiss me, daddy, I
stay kissed



Now, daddy, squeeze me, squeeze me again, oh, daddy don't stop till I
tell you when

Now, daddy squeeze me, kiss me some more, oh, Lord, like you did
before



Your papa cupid is standing close by

Now, daddy, don't let sweet baby cry

Pick me up on your knee

I just git so, you know, when you squeeze me

I just git so, you know, when you squeeze me
