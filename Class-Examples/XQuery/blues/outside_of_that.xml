<lyrics>



I've got the meanest man in the land

But his love is that sticking brand

His kiss just lingers on my lips

And thrill me to my fingertips

People say I'm a fool

He's heartless and also cruel



But outside of that, he's all right with me

Outside of that, he's sweet as he can be

I love him as true as stars above

He beats me up, but how he can love

I never loved like that since the day I was born

I said for fun, I don't want you no more

And when I said that, I made sweet papa sore

He blacked my eyes, I couldn't see

Then he pawned the things he gave to me

But outside of that, he's all right with me



I said for fun, I don't want you no more

And when I said that, I made sweet papa sore

When he pawned my things I said: you're a dirty old thief

Now, then he turned around and knocks out both of my teeth

Outside of that, he's all right with me
