<lyrics>


<l>I've got the meanest man in the land

</l>
<l>But his love is that sticking brand

</l>
<l>His kiss just lingers on my lips

</l>
<l>And thrill me to my fingertips

</l>
<l>People say I'm a fool

</l>
<l>He's heartless and also cruel



</l>
<l>But outside of that, he's all right with me

</l>
<l>Outside of that, he's sweet as he can be

</l>
<l>I love him as true as stars above

</l>
<l>He beats me up, but how he can love

</l>
<l>I never loved like that since the day I was born

</l>
<l>I said for fun, I don't want you no more

</l>
<l>And when I said that, I made sweet papa sore

</l>
<l>He blacked my eyes, I couldn't see

</l>
<l>Then he pawned the things he gave to me

</l>
<l>But outside of that, he's all right with me



</l>
<l>I said for fun, I don't want you no more

</l>
<l>And when I said that, I made sweet papa sore

</l>
<l>When he pawned my things I said: you're a dirty old thief

</l>
<l>Now, then he turned around and knocks out both of my teeth

</l><l>Outside of that, he's all right with me</l></lyrics></xml>
