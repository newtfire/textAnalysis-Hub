<l>Bluebird bluebird, I want you to take a message down south for
me

</l>
<l>Bluebird bluebird, I want you to take a message down south for me

</l>
<l>I want ya to find Miss Liza Belle and tell her, I'm just as poor as a

man can be




</l>
<l>Bluebird, if she's not at home, you needn't worry yourself by
knockin' on the door

</l>
<l>Bluebird, if she's not at home, you needn't worry yourself by
knockin' on the door

</l>
<l>She may be right across the street, seein' the next door neighbor,

you know




</l>
<l>Bluebird, when ya come back to Chicago, I want you to fly 'tween the
sun and cloud

</l>
<l>When ya come back to Chicago, I want you to fly 'tween the sun and
the cloud

</l>
<l>If ya get a message from Liza Belle, don't let it hit the ground</l></lyrics></xml>
