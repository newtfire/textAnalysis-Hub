Bluebird bluebird, I want you to take a message down south for
me

Bluebird bluebird, I want you to take a message down south for me

I want ya to find Miss Liza Belle and tell her, I'm just as poor as a
man can be



Bluebird, if she's not at home, you needn't worry yourself by
knockin' on the door

Bluebird, if she's not at home, you needn't worry yourself by
knockin' on the door

She may be right across the street, seein' the next door neighbor,
you know



Bluebird, when ya come back to Chicago, I want you to fly 'tween the
sun and cloud

When ya come back to Chicago, I want you to fly 'tween the sun and
the cloud

If ya get a message from Liza Belle, don't let it hit the ground
