<lyrics>


<l>Oh, I need you baby, yes I need you baby

</l>
<l>Oh, I need you baby, come on back home to me

</l>
<l>I'll make it all up to you, woman, just you want around and see



</l>
<l>I was wrong baby, I thought I was having fun

</l>
<l>I know I was wrong baby, I thought I was having fun

</l>
<l>Yes I was young and foolish, I didn't know you was the one



</l>
<l>Now I've settled down baby and I know I'll treat you right

</l>
<l>Oh, I've settled down baby and I know I'll treat you right

</l>
<l>Yes, come on home now baby, I want you to come on home tonight



</l>
<l>Oh, I need you baby, yes I need you baby

</l>
<l>Well I need you woman, I need a good woman around

</l><l>Every night about this time baby, my love comes tumbling down</l></lyrics></xml>
