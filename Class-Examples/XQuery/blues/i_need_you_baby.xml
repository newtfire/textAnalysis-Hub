<lyrics>



Oh, I need you baby, yes I need you baby

Oh, I need you baby, come on back home to me

I'll make it all up to you, woman, just you want around and see



I was wrong baby, I thought I was having fun

I know I was wrong baby, I thought I was having fun

Yes I was young and foolish, I didn't know you was the one



Now I've settled down baby and I know I'll treat you right

Oh, I've settled down baby and I know I'll treat you right

Yes, come on home now baby, I want you to come on home tonight



Oh, I need you baby, yes I need you baby

Well I need you woman, I need a good woman around

Every night about this time baby, my love comes tumbling down
