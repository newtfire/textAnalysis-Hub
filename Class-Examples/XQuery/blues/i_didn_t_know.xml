<l>I didn't know, you was out last night baby

</l>
<l>No I didn't know, baby you was out last night

</l>
<l>Well I do know, you don't treat me right



</l>
<l>I didn't know, you was ridin' him in my car last night

</l>
<l>No I didn't know, you was ridin' him in my car last night

</l>
<l>Well I do know darling, you don't treat me right



</l>
<l>I didn't know, you was down in New Orleans last night

</l>
<l>No I didn't know, you was in New Orleans last night

</l>
<l>Well I do know sweetheart, you don't treat me nice



</l>
<l>I didn't know, you was lovin' somebody else

</l>
<l>No I didn't know, babe you was lovin' somebody else
