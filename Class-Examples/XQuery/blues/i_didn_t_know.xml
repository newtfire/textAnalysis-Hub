<lyrics>



I didn't know, you was out last night baby

No I didn't know, baby you was out last night

Well I do know, you don't treat me right



I didn't know, you was ridin' him in my car last night

No I didn't know, you was ridin' him in my car last night

Well I do know darling, you don't treat me right



I didn't know, you was down in New Orleans last night

No I didn't know, you was in New Orleans last night

Well I do know sweetheart, you don't treat me nice



I didn't know, you was lovin' somebody else

No I didn't know, babe you was lovin' somebody else

I didn't know, but I know now
