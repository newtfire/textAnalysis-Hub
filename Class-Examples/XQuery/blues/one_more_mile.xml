<lyrics>


<l>Oh you know it has been such a hard hard journey, I don't have to cry
no more

</l>
<l>Keep your light up burnin', so I can know the score

</l>
<l>I got one more mile, oh you know I only got one more mile to go

</l>
<l>Oh you know my journey was so hard,

</l>
<l>but I don't have to worry 'bout you no more



</l>
<l>Oh you know they tell me that thousands of schoolkids, every one have
a mate

</l>
<l>The little girl that I love, she the richest in the state

</l>
<l>I got one more mile, oh you know I only got one more mile to go

</l>
<l>Oh you know my journey has been so hard,

</l>
<l>but I don't have to worry 'bout you no more



</l>
<l>Oh you know I made a mistake for gamblin', I betted my money
wrong

</l>
<l>I was bettin' on my baby, but she weren't even at home

</l>
<l>I got one more mile, oh you know I got one more mile to go

</l>
<l>Oh you know it has been such a long journey,

</l>
<l>but I don't have to cry 'bout you no more</l></lyrics></xml>
