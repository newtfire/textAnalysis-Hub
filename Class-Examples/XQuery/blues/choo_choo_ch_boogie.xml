<lyrics>


<l>Headin' for the station with a pack on my back

</l>
<l>I'm tired of transportation in the back of my hack

</l>
<l>I love to hear the rhythm of the clickety clack

</l>
<l>And hear the lonesome whistle, see the smoke from the stack to pal
around

</l>
<l>With democratic fellow named Mac

</l>
<l>So take me right back to the track, Jack



</l>
<l>Choo-choo, choo-choo, ch'boogie, woo-woo

</l>
<l>Woo-woo, ch'boogie, choo-choo, choo-choo, ch'boogie

</l>
<l>Take me right back to the track, Jack



</l>
<l>You reach your destination but you don't go back

</l>
<l>You need some compensation to get back in the black

</l>
<l>You take a morning paper from the top of the stack

</l>
<l>And read the situations from the front to the back

</l>
<l>But the only job that's open needs a man with a knack

</l>
<l>So put it right back in the rack, Jack



</l>
<l>Choo-choo, choo-choo, ch'boogie, woo-woo

</l>
<l>Woo-woo, ch'boogie, choo-choo, choo-choo, ch'boogie

</l>
<l>Take me right back to the track, Jack



</l>
<l>Gonna settle down by the railroad track

</l>
<l>Live the life O'Riley in the beat down shack

</l>
<l>When I hear a whistle I can peep thru the crack

</l>
<l>Watch the train rollin' when it's ballin' the jack

</l>
<l>Love to hear the rhythm of the clickety clack

</l>
<l>So take me right back to the track, Jack



</l>
<l>Choo-choo, choo-choo, ch'boogie, woo-woo

</l>
<l>Woo-woo, ch'boogie, choo-choo, choo-choo, ch'boogie

</l>
<l>Take me right back to the track, Jack



</l><l>Take me right back to the track, Jack</l></lyrics></xml>
