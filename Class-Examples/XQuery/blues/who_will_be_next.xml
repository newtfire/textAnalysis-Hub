<lyrics>



Who will you hurt next, how will you start

Who'd be the next one, baby you tear apart



Blessed be your heart, cursed be your name

Blessed be your heart, cursed be your name

Who'd be the next one darlin', that you'd put to shame?



Will it be the one, give you his gold

Or will it be the young one, take all you hope

Babe I'll forget my pride, just to keep you by my side



Cheat if you want to darlin', treat me unkind

Cheat if you want to darlin', treat me unkind

Come back and love me, when you can find a little time
