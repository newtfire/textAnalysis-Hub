<lyrics>


<l>Who will you hurt next, how will you start

</l>
<l>Who'd be the next one, baby you tear apart



</l>
<l>Blessed be your heart, cursed be your name

</l>
<l>Blessed be your heart, cursed be your name

</l>
<l>Who'd be the next one darlin', that you'd put to shame?



</l>
<l>Will it be the one, give you his gold

</l>
<l>Or will it be the young one, take all you hope

</l>
<l>Babe I'll forget my pride, just to keep you by my side



</l>
<l>Cheat if you want to darlin', treat me unkind

</l>
<l>Cheat if you want to darlin', treat me unkind

</l>
<l>Come back and love me, when you can find a little time</l></lyrics></xml>
