<lyrics>



They say there ain't no woman that a man can trust

That they all use 
juju
,
and 
goofy dust

But I don't argue baby

And I ain't gonna make no fuss

'Cause I'm glad, glad, glad, I'm so glad baby

That you put it on me



Oh, I had pretty women in every town

And I played so hard when the sun went down

Oh, but you stopped my partying

You stopped my partying when you came around baby

Hmm and I'm so glad

I'm so glad, I'm so glad, I'm so glad baby

That you put it on me



If I hollered for help

The doctor would come

If I asked for medicine

You know he'd give me some

But that wouldn't cure me baby

Oh, and you know that wouldn't be no fun

So you just keep on, keep on mama

Oh, you just keep on puttin' it on me



Yes, just keep it up baby

Keep on puttin' it on me

Keep it up, keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on baby...
