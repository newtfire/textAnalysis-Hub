<lyrics>


<l>They say there ain't no woman that a man can trust

</l>
<l>That they all use 

juju
,
and 
goofy dust


</l>
<l>But I don't argue baby

</l>
<l>And I ain't gonna make no fuss

</l>
<l>'Cause I'm glad, glad, glad, I'm so glad baby

</l>
<l>That you put it on me



</l>
<l>Oh, I had pretty women in every town

</l>
<l>And I played so hard when the sun went down

</l>
<l>Oh, but you stopped my partying

</l>
<l>You stopped my partying when you came around baby

</l>
<l>Hmm and I'm so glad

</l>
<l>I'm so glad, I'm so glad, I'm so glad baby

</l>
<l>That you put it on me



</l>
<l>If I hollered for help

</l>
<l>The doctor would come

</l>
<l>If I asked for medicine

</l>
<l>You know he'd give me some

</l>
<l>But that wouldn't cure me baby

</l>
<l>Oh, and you know that wouldn't be no fun

</l>
<l>So you just keep on, keep on mama

</l>
<l>Oh, you just keep on puttin' it on me



</l>
<l>Yes, just keep it up baby

</l>
<l>Keep on puttin' it on me

</l>
<l>Keep it up, keep on, keep on, keep on, keep on baby...</l></lyrics></xml>
