<lyrics>



I've traveled for miles around

Seems like everybody wanna put me down

Because I'm a bluesman

But I'm a good man, understand



I went down to the bus station

Look upon the wall

My money is to light people

Couldn't go no where at all

I'm a bluesman

But I'm a good man, understand



The burden that I carry, oh is so heavy

It seems like ain't nobody in this great big world

That would wanna, wanna help old B.

Hey, but I'll, I would be all right people

Just give me a break, good things come

The those wait, and I've waited a long time

I'm a bluesman

But I'm a good man, understand
