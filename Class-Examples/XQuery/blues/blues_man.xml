<lyrics>


<l>I've traveled for miles around

</l>
<l>Seems like everybody wanna put me down

</l>
<l>Because I'm a bluesman

</l>
<l>But I'm a good man, understand



</l>
<l>I went down to the bus station

</l>
<l>Look upon the wall

</l>
<l>My money is to light people

</l>
<l>Couldn't go no where at all

</l>
<l>I'm a bluesman

</l>
<l>But I'm a good man, understand



</l>
<l>The burden that I carry, oh is so heavy

</l>
<l>It seems like ain't nobody in this great big world

</l>
<l>That would wanna, wanna help old B.

</l>
<l>Hey, but I'll, I would be all right people

</l>
<l>Just give me a break, good things come

</l>
<l>The those wait, and I've waited a long time

</l>
<l>I'm a bluesman

</l>
<l>But I'm a good man, understand</l></lyrics></xml>
