<lyrics>



True love is hard to find

True love is hard to find

Well just like good wine

Never gets served before it's time



Baby be true to me

Like I'm true to you

Well stick around or set me free

Baby that's what you got to do



It takes a lot of lovin' to fill my lovin' cup

Make it overflow till I can't get enough



I like it in the light

I like it in the dark

Well I like it on lover's lane

I like it in the pouring rain



Well bring it on over bring it on over to me

Well you and I together that's the way

I want it to be



Baby come take my hand

Tryin' to make you understand

Well I love you you see

Baby come on and go with me



Well bring it on over bring it on over to me

Well you and I together that's the way

I want it to be



Baby come take my hand

Tryin' to make you understand

Well I love you you see

Baby come on and go with me
