<l>True love is hard to find

</l>
<l>True love is hard to find

</l>
<l>Well just like good wine

</l>
<l>Never gets served before it's time



</l>
<l>Baby be true to me

</l>
<l>Like I'm true to you

</l>
<l>Well stick around or set me free

</l>
<l>Baby that's what you got to do



</l>
<l>It takes a lot of lovin' to fill my lovin' cup

</l>
<l>Make it overflow till I can't get enough



</l>
<l>I like it in the light

</l>
<l>I like it in the dark

</l>
<l>Well I like it on lover's lane

</l>
<l>I like it in the pouring rain



</l>
<l>Well bring it on over bring it on over to me

</l>
<l>Well you and I together that's the way

</l>
<l>I want it to be



</l>
<l>Baby come take my hand

</l>
<l>Tryin' to make you understand

</l>
<l>Well I love you you see

</l>
<l>Baby come on and go with me



</l>
<l>Well bring it on over bring it on over to me

</l>
<l>Well you and I together that's the way

</l>
<l>I want it to be



</l>
<l>Baby come take my hand

</l>
<l>Tryin' to make you understand

</l>
<l>Well I love you you see

</l>
<l>Baby come on and go with me</l></lyrics></xml>
