<lyrics>



Now I'm a walkin' groundhog, mama and I walks around in my
den

Now I'm a walkin' groundhog, mama and I walks around in my den

Now if I come out and see my shadow, John I believe I'll go back
in



Now I want some feedin' mama, so I can hear a high sound

If you don't feed me baby, I believe I'll go back in the ground

Because I'm that walkin' groundhog, mama and I walks around in my
den

Now if I come out and see my shadow you say you don't love me,

I believe I'll go back in



Now I wanna hear some swingin' music, I wanna hear a Fats Waller
song

Now if I start to 
jitter-buggin'
,
I'm forgettin' my hole down in the ground

Because I'm that walkin' groundhog, man and I walks around in my
den

Now if I come out and see my shadow my woman don't love me,

I believe I'll go back in



Yes John, you know what I mean

Oh you know I'm a-walkin' wild



Now I need some pettin' baby, baby you know what I mean

Now if you don't pet me baby, I believe I'll go back down in New
Orleans

Because I'm that walkin' groundhog, at night I walks around in my
den

Now if I come out and see my shadow my woman don't love me,

yeah an' I believe I'll go back in
