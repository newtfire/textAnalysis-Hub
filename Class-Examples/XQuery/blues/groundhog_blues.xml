<lyrics>


<l>Now I'm a walkin' groundhog, mama and I walks around in my
den

</l>
<l>Now I'm a walkin' groundhog, mama and I walks around in my den

</l>
<l>Now if I come out and see my shadow, John I believe I'll go back

in




</l>
<l>Now I want some feedin' mama, so I can hear a high sound

</l>
<l>If you don't feed me baby, I believe I'll go back in the ground

</l>
<l>Because I'm that walkin' groundhog, mama and I walks around in my
den

</l>
<l>Now if I come out and see my shadow you say you don't love me,

</l>
<l>I believe I'll go back in



</l>
<l>Now I wanna hear some swingin' music, I wanna hear a Fats Waller
song

</l>
<l>Now if I start to 

jitter-buggin'
,
I'm forgettin' my hole down in the ground


</l>
<l>Because I'm that walkin' groundhog, man and I walks around in my
den

</l>
<l>Now if I come out and see my shadow my woman don't love me,

</l>
<l>I believe I'll go back in



</l>
<l>Yes John, you know what I mean

</l>
<l>Oh you know I'm a-walkin' wild



</l>
<l>Now I need some pettin' baby, baby you know what I mean

</l>
<l>Now if you don't pet me baby, I believe I'll go back down in New
Orleans

</l>
<l>Because I'm that walkin' groundhog, at night I walks around in my
den

</l>
<l>Now if I come out and see my shadow my woman don't love me,

</l>
<l>yeah an' I believe I'll go back in</l></lyrics></xml>
