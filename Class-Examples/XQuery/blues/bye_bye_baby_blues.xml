<lyrics>



My baby treat me so mean, I don't know right from wrong

My baby treat me so mean, I don't know right from wrong

I'm here today, but tomorrow I might be gone



I have so much trouble, until I don't know what to do

I have so much trouble, until I don't know what to do

The way you treat me baby, it's coming home to you



Because I'm dogged around, baby, an' driven from door to door

Yeah-eay, baby driven from door to door

But I raise my hand, I won't be dogged no more



(Now boy, let's get the thing!)



So goodbye baby, yes I'm leavin' now

So bye-bye baby, babe I'm leavin' now

Because you you don't mean, me no good, no how
