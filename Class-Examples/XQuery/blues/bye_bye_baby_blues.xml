<lyrics>


<l>My baby treat me so mean, I don't know right from wrong

</l>
<l>My baby treat me so mean, I don't know right from wrong

</l>
<l>I'm here today, but tomorrow I might be gone



</l>
<l>I have so much trouble, until I don't know what to do

</l>
<l>I have so much trouble, until I don't know what to do

</l>
<l>The way you treat me baby, it's coming home to you



</l>
<l>Because I'm dogged around, baby, an' driven from door to door

</l>
<l>Yeah-eay, baby driven from door to door

</l>
<l>But I raise my hand, I won't be dogged no more



</l>
<l>(Now boy, let's get the thing!)



</l>
<l>So goodbye baby, yes I'm leavin' now

</l>
<l>So bye-bye baby, babe I'm leavin' now

</l>
<l>Because you you don't mean, me no good, no how</l></lyrics></xml>
