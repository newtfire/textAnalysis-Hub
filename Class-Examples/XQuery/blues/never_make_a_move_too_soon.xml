<lyrics>



Three days of snow in Birmingham

Thought you would wonder where I am

Rang our number all night long

It's no comfort on the telephone

Ran out and caught a midnight flight

Thought a little love would make everything all right

The landlord said you moved away

And left me all your bills to pay

Look out baby, you might have made your move too soon



Left me with a Keno card

This life in Vegas sure ain't hard

I ran it up to about fifty grand

Cashed it in and held it in my hand

That kind of word can get around

And make a lost love come up found

I hear you knocking baby at my door

But you know you ain't living here no more

It's too bad

I think you made your move too soon



I've been from Spain to Tokyo

From Africa to Ohio

I never tried to make the news

I'm just a man who plays the blues

I take my lovin' everywhere

I come back, and they still care you know

One love ahead

One love behind

One in my arms and one on my mind

It's one thing baby

I never make my move too soon



I've been from Spain to Tokyo

From Africa to Ohio

I never tried to make the news

I'm just a man who plays the blues

I take my lovin' everywhere

I come back, you know they still all care

One love ahead and one behind

One in my arms you know, one on my mind

And it's one thing people

I never make my move too soon
