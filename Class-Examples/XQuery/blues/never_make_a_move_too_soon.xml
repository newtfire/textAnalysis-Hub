<lyrics>


<l>Three days of snow in Birmingham

</l>
<l>Thought you would wonder where I am

</l>
<l>Rang our number all night long

</l>
<l>It's no comfort on the telephone

</l>
<l>Ran out and caught a midnight flight

</l>
<l>Thought a little love would make everything all right

</l>
<l>The landlord said you moved away

</l>
<l>And left me all your bills to pay

</l>
<l>Look out baby, you might have made your move too soon



</l>
<l>Left me with a Keno card

</l>
<l>This life in Vegas sure ain't hard

</l>
<l>I ran it up to about fifty grand

</l>
<l>Cashed it in and held it in my hand

</l>
<l>That kind of word can get around

</l>
<l>And make a lost love come up found

</l>
<l>I hear you knocking baby at my door

</l>
<l>But you know you ain't living here no more

</l>
<l>It's too bad

</l>
<l>I think you made your move too soon



</l>
<l>I've been from Spain to Tokyo

</l>
<l>From Africa to Ohio

</l>
<l>I never tried to make the news

</l>
<l>I'm just a man who plays the blues

</l>
<l>I take my lovin' everywhere

</l>
<l>I come back, and they still care you know

</l>
<l>One love ahead

</l>
<l>One love behind

</l>
<l>One in my arms and one on my mind

</l>
<l>It's one thing baby

</l>
<l>I never make my move too soon



</l>
<l>I've been from Spain to Tokyo

</l>
<l>From Africa to Ohio

</l>
<l>I never tried to make the news

</l>
<l>I'm just a man who plays the blues

</l>
<l>I take my lovin' everywhere

</l>
<l>I come back, you know they still all care

</l>
<l>One love ahead and one behind

</l>
<l>One in my arms you know, one on my mind

</l>
<l>And it's one thing people

</l>
<l>I never make my move too soon</l></lyrics></xml>
