<lyrics>





The biggest fool there ever was
I let you go,
and now I can't survive without your touch
I need you so

But baby all you've got to do,
is tell me that you need me too

I hit the ground running
I hit the ground running
I hit the ground running back to you

Oh well I'd rather die a thousand deaths,
than to lose your love
But now I'm drowning in my loneliness
I can rise above, yeah again

Well just forgive me this one last time,
and tell me baby you're still mine

I hit the ground running
I hit the ground running baby, yeah
I hit the ground running back to you

Oh I hit the ground running
I hit the ground running
I hit the ground running back to you

Ah, you know I'm coming,
I'm coming back for you by now baby
So if you don't want me baby,
lock your doors cause here I come
