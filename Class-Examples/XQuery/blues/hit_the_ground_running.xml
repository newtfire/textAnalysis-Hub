<lyrics>


<l>The biggest fool there ever was

I let you go,
and now I can't survive without your touch
I need you so


</l>
<l>But baby all you've got to do,
is tell me that you need me too

</l>
<l>I hit the ground running
I hit the ground running
I hit the ground running back to you

</l>
<l>Oh well I'd rather die a thousand deaths,

than to lose your love
But now I'm drowning in my loneliness
I can rise above, yeah again


</l>
<l>Well just forgive me this one last time,
and tell me baby you're still mine

</l>
<l>I hit the ground running
I hit the ground running baby, yeah
I hit the ground running back to you

</l>
<l>Oh I hit the ground running
I hit the ground running
I hit the ground running back to you

</l><l>Ah, you know I'm coming,</l>
<l>I'm coming back for you by now baby</l>
<l>So if you don't want me baby,</l>
<l>lock your doors cause here I come</l></lyrics></xml>
