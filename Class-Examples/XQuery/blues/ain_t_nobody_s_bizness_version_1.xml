<lyrics>



If I attend church all day Sunday, come back home and raise

(Spoken) I think I feel hurt or shall I go a little further, do a
little more?

Ain't nobody's bizness what I do

If one day I have ham and bacon, and the next day, ain't nothin'
shakin'

No it ain't nobody's bizness what I do
