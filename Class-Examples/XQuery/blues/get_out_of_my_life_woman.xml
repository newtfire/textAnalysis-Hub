<lyrics>



Get out of my life woman, you don't no love me no more

I said, "Get out of my life woman, you don't no love me no more

Get out of my life woman, you don't no love me no more"



Get out my eyes teardrops, I got to see my way around

Won't you get out my eyes teardrops, I got to see my way around

Get out my life heartaches, nothing but heartaches by the pound



Get off my ladder woman, I got to climb up to the top

I said, "Get off my ladder woman, I got to climb up to the top

Get off my ladder woman, ladder's nothing to make you stop"



Get out the way woman, I got to be movin' on

I said, "Get out the way woman, I got to be movin' on

Get out the way woman, I got to be movin' on"
