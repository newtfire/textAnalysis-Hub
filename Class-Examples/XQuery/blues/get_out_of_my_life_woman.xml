<lyrics>


<l>Get out of my life woman, you don't no love me no more

</l>
<l>I said, "Get out of my life woman, you don't no love me no more

</l>
<l>Get out of my life woman, you don't no love me no more"



</l>
<l>Get out my eyes teardrops, I got to see my way around

</l>
<l>Won't you get out my eyes teardrops, I got to see my way around

</l>
<l>Get out my life heartaches, nothing but heartaches by the pound



</l>
<l>Get off my ladder woman, I got to climb up to the top

</l>
<l>I said, "Get off my ladder woman, I got to climb up to the top

</l>
<l>Get off my ladder woman, ladder's nothing to make you stop"



</l>
<l>Get out the way woman, I got to be movin' on

</l>
<l>I said, "Get out the way woman, I got to be movin' on

</l>
<l>Get out the way woman, I got to be movin' on"</l></lyrics></xml>
