Well, a nickel is a nickel, dime is a dime,

house full-a 
chillun

an' now one's mine

I gotta bundle up an' go I gotta bundle up an' go

Well, ya high pile a' women sho gotta bundle up an' go



Doo-doo, doo-doo doo-dop bah

Doo-doo, doo-doo doo-dop dah

Doo-doo, doo-doo doo-dop dah



May be old, may be gray, ya ain't too old just to shift them
gears,

Ya gotta bundle up an' go

Ya gotta bundle up an' go

Ya gotta bundle up an' go

Sho' gotta bundle up an' go

Yeah!



Well, mama killed a chicken,

thought it was a duck

Put him on the table with his legs stickin' up

Ya gotta bundle up an' go, yeah

Ya gotta bundle up an' go

Well, ya high pile a' women

Sho' gotta bundle up an' go



Well, mama tol' papa, night afo' las',

"Look-a here, papa, you ain't doin' me right"

I gotta bundle up an' go

I gotta bundle up an' go

Well, ya high pile a' women

Sho' gotta bundle up an' go



Doo-doo, doo-doo doo-dop bah

Doo-doo, doo-doo doo-dop dah

Doo-doo, doo-doo doo-dop dah
