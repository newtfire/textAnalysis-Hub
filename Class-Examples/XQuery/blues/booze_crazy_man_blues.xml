<lyrics>



Daddy oh sweet daddy, please don't drive me away

Daddy oh sweet daddy, please don't drive me away

I love you sweet papa, please let your mama stay



Don't let your whiskey, drive away your only friend

Don't let your whiskey, drive away your only friend

You know I've stuck with you, sweet daddy through thick and thin



I've worked so hard for you, till morning I was almost dead

I've worked so hard for you, till morning I was almost dead

Just for daddy to have, some place to lay his weary head



But now, I'm bein' treated like a slave

But now, I'm bein' treated like a slave

Your goin' to let bad whiskey carry you to your grave
