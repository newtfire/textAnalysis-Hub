<l>Daddy oh sweet daddy, please don't drive me away

</l>
<l>Daddy oh sweet daddy, please don't drive me away

</l>
<l>I love you sweet papa, please let your mama stay



</l>
<l>Don't let your whiskey, drive away your only friend

</l>
<l>Don't let your whiskey, drive away your only friend

</l>
<l>You know I've stuck with you, sweet daddy through thick and thin



</l>
<l>I've worked so hard for you, till morning I was almost dead

</l>
<l>I've worked so hard for you, till morning I was almost dead

</l>
<l>Just for daddy to have, some place to lay his weary head



</l>
<l>But now, I'm bein' treated like a slave

</l>
<l>But now, I'm bein' treated like a slave

</l>
<l>Your goin' to let bad whiskey carry you to your grave</l></lyrics></xml>
