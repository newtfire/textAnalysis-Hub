<lyrics>


<l>I wanna tell you a true story

</l>
<l>the facts of life

</l>
<l>'Cause I know all about it,

</l>
<l>'cause I been through it a many times

</l>
<l>Ain't no substitute, there's no substitute,

</l>
<l>substitute for love



</l>
<l>When your woman gone,

</l>
<l>there's nothin' else can,

</l>
<l>can take her place

</l>
<l>But there's no substitute, substitute for love

</l>
<l>No, no



</l>
<l>Love will make you gamble

</l>
<l>Love will make you drink

</l>
<l>Make you stay out all night long,

</l>
<l>lookin' for love

</l>
<l>But there's no, no substitute,

</l>
<l>substitute, substitute for love



</l>
<l>I wanna tell you a story,

</l>
<l>true, true, true story about love

</l>
<l>Many times, many times, over 'n over, over in life,

</l>
<l>so many people have tried, tried, to get a substitute

</l>
<l>An' it just don't work, work on love



</l>
<l>You may not be good looking,

</l>
<l>you may not be so fine

</l>
<l>But love, love, love love, love, love,

</l>
<l>is a burning thing

</l>
<l>It's a burning thing

</l>
<l>I know, I know, I know, I know,

</l>
<l>I been down, down, in a ring of fire

</l>
<l>Lookin' for a love,

</l>
<l>I couldn't find, I couldn't find a substitute,

</l>
<l>uh, for love, for love, I cried, cried

</l>
<l>I cried, cried but it just wasn't there,

</l>
<l>just wasn't there</l></lyrics></xml>
