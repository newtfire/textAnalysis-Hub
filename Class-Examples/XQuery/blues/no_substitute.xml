<lyrics>



I wanna tell you a true story

the facts of life

'Cause I know all about it,

'cause I been through it a many times

Ain't no substitute, there's no substitute,

substitute for love



When your woman gone,

there's nothin' else can,

can take her place

But there's no substitute, substitute for love

No, no



Love will make you gamble

Love will make you drink

Make you stay out all night long,

lookin' for love

But there's no, no substitute,

substitute, substitute for love



I wanna tell you a story,

true, true, true story about love

Many times, many times, over 'n over, over in life,

so many people have tried, tried, to get a substitute

An' it just don't work, work on love



You may not be good looking,

you may not be so fine

But love, love, love love, love, love,

is a burning thing

It's a burning thing

I know, I know, I know, I know,

I been down, down, in a ring of fire

Lookin' for a love,

I couldn't find, I couldn't find a substitute,

uh, for love, for love, I cried, cried

I cried, cried but it just wasn't there,

just wasn't there
