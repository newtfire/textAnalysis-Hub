<lyrics>



If me and my baby fuss and fight

Well, and the next minute we're all right

It ain't nobody's bizness what I do



If one day we have ham and bacon

And the next day ain't nothing shakin'

I tell you it ain't nobody's bizness what I do



Oh, I'm three, three times seven

Oh, that makes twenty-one

Ah, that ain't nobody's bizness what I do



Oh, if I attend church all day Sunday

And cabaret all day Monday

It ain't nobody's bizness what I do



If I stay out all night

Spending my money I tell you that's all right

Because it ain't nobody's bizness what I do

It ain't nobody's bizness what I do
