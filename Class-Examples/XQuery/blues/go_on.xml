<lyrics>



I said Lord up in heaven

Honey, what's been wrong with you

Just give me one good reason

For what we've been going through



Oh go on

'Cause you brought me to my knees

Go on, do just what you please

I'd rather you'd just leave me alone

So baby, go on



Are you sure you still love me

All you seem to want to do is fight

Always telling me

I can't do anything right



You'd better go on

You've got me on my knees

Go on, do just what you please

I'd rather you just leave me alone

So baby, go on



Go on, go on, go on, baby, go on

Go on

'Cause you brought me to my knees

Go on, do just what you please

You wanna lose your happy home

Then baby, go on



Now I've run out of patience

And the chances are slim

Since I walked around the corner

Saw you kissing on him

You said he's just a long lost friend

If you please

You'd better take him home now

So darling, where's the keys



Go on, got me on my knees

Go on, do just what you please

You wanna lose your happy home

Then baby, go on, go on

Go on, go on, go on, go on

I'd rather you just leave me alone

Baby, go on

Go on, go on, go on, go on

Go on, go on, go on, baby, go on

Go on, baby, go on, go on ...
