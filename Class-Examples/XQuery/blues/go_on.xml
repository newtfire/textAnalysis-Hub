<lyrics>


<l>I said Lord up in heaven

</l>
<l>Honey, what's been wrong with you

</l>
<l>Just give me one good reason

</l>
<l>For what we've been going through



</l>
<l>Oh go on

</l>
<l>'Cause you brought me to my knees

</l>
<l>Go on, do just what you please

</l>
<l>I'd rather you'd just leave me alone

</l>
<l>So baby, go on



</l>
<l>Are you sure you still love me

</l>
<l>All you seem to want to do is fight

</l>
<l>Always telling me

</l>
<l>I can't do anything right



</l>
<l>You'd better go on

</l>
<l>You've got me on my knees

</l>
<l>Go on, do just what you please

</l>
<l>I'd rather you just leave me alone

</l>
<l>So baby, go on



</l>
<l>Go on, go on, go on, baby, go on

</l>
<l>Go on

</l>
<l>'Cause you brought me to my knees

</l>
<l>Go on, do just what you please

</l>
<l>You wanna lose your happy home

</l>
<l>Then baby, go on



</l>
<l>Now I've run out of patience

</l>
<l>And the chances are slim

</l>
<l>Since I walked around the corner

</l>
<l>Saw you kissing on him

</l>
<l>You said he's just a long lost friend

</l>
<l>If you please

</l>
<l>You'd better take him home now

</l>
<l>So darling, where's the keys



</l>
<l>Go on, got me on my knees

</l>
<l>Go on, do just what you please

</l>
<l>You wanna lose your happy home

</l>
<l>Then baby, go on, go on

</l>
<l>Go on, go on, go on, go on

</l>
<l>I'd rather you just leave me alone

</l>
<l>Baby, go on

</l>
<l>Go on, go on, go on, go on

</l>
<l>Go on, go on, go on, baby, go on

</l>
<l>Go on, baby, go on, go on ...</l></lyrics></xml>
