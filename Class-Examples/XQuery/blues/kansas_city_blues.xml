<lyrics>



I been rockin' and reelin', Lord as long as I can be

Lord, the man that I love tryin' to make a fool out of me

Babe, I'm leavin', yeah I'm a-leavin' this mornin'

Goin' to Kansas City to bring Jim Jackson home



Now well I used to drink and I'm gonna buy a gallon

I'm gonna find me my man I say, get a pair of overalls

I'm leavin', yeah I'm gonna go to Kansas City, ha ha ha

Goin' to Kansas City, yeah, to make my man my own



I'll walk on Beauty Street with an idea I might stay

If she wants my man I'll just change my ways

Lord I'm leavin', yeah I'm leavin' this mornin'

Goin' to Kansas City to bring Jim Jackson home

Go ahead, take it!



Yeah!



I been rockin' and reelin', lonesome as I can be

Lord the man that I love sure made a fool out of me

Babe I'm leavin', yeah I'm leavin' this mornin'

Goin' to Kansas City tryin' to find a man of my own, yeah
