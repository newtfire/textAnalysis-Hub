<lyrics>



My pretty girl is sitting in her room of red

My pretty girl lying on her furry bed

Pretty as the moonlight

I only want to treat her right



My pretty girl doing something to her hair

My pretty girl dressing up with special care

Pretty as the moonlight

I only want to treat her right



My pretty girl making me feel her man

My pretty girl hugging me when she can

Pretty as the moonlight

I only want to treat her right



My pretty girl sleeping in the still of night

My pretty girl glowing in the candlelight

Pretty as the moonlight

I only want to treat her right
