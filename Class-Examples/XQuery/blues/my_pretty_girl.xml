<l>My pretty girl is sitting in her room of red

</l>
<l>My pretty girl lying on her furry bed

</l>
<l>Pretty as the moonlight

</l>
<l>I only want to treat her right



</l>
<l>My pretty girl doing something to her hair

</l>
<l>My pretty girl dressing up with special care

</l>
<l>Pretty as the moonlight

</l>
<l>I only want to treat her right



</l>
<l>My pretty girl making me feel her man

</l>
<l>My pretty girl hugging me when she can

</l>
<l>Pretty as the moonlight

</l>
<l>I only want to treat her right



</l>
<l>My pretty girl sleeping in the still of night

</l>
<l>My pretty girl glowing in the candlelight

</l>
<l>Pretty as the moonlight

</l>
<l>I only want to treat her right</l></lyrics></xml>
