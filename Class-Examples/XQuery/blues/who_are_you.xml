<lyrics>



We've met before

In the same room of my imagination

And it gets so hard to deal with

Out strike temptation, yes it does

Yesterday in my mind

You were here but now we've parted

You need to come on back

And finish what we started, oh baby

I need to know



Who are you

And where did you come from

(Where did you come from, baby)

Who are you gonna give yourself to

And what are your plans

Tell me, baby

(I've really got to know now)

Who are you

And where are you going

Will you give yourself to me

Or some other man

I got to know, baby



You started what I thought

You intended to finish

You were right here yesterday

But today you vanished

When I woke up something told me

That I had been used

But I liked it

And when I couldn't find you

Lord, it gave me the blues

Now I really need to know



Who are you

And where did you come from

(And where did you come from, baby)

Who are you gonna give yourself to

Baby, what are your plans

Tell me, girl

Who are you

And where are we going

Will you give yourself to me

Or some other man, baby



Who are you, baby, who are you

Who are you, baby, who are you

I'd really like to know about you, baby

Who are you, baby

Where are we going

Where did you come from, baby...
