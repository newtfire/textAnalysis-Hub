<lyrics>


<l>We've met before

</l>
<l>In the same room of my imagination

</l>
<l>And it gets so hard to deal with

</l>
<l>Out strike temptation, yes it does

</l>
<l>Yesterday in my mind

</l>
<l>You were here but now we've parted

</l>
<l>You need to come on back

</l>
<l>And finish what we started, oh baby

</l>
<l>I need to know



</l>
<l>Who are you

</l>
<l>And where did you come from

</l>
<l>(Where did you come from, baby)

</l>
<l>Who are you gonna give yourself to

</l>
<l>And what are your plans

</l>
<l>Tell me, baby

</l>
<l>(I've really got to know now)

</l>
<l>Who are you

</l>
<l>And where are you going

</l>
<l>Will you give yourself to me

</l>
<l>Or some other man

</l>
<l>I got to know, baby



</l>
<l>You started what I thought

</l>
<l>You intended to finish

</l>
<l>You were right here yesterday

</l>
<l>But today you vanished

</l>
<l>When I woke up something told me

</l>
<l>That I had been used

</l>
<l>But I liked it

</l>
<l>And when I couldn't find you

</l>
<l>Lord, it gave me the blues

</l>
<l>Now I really need to know



</l>
<l>Who are you

</l>
<l>And where did you come from

</l>
<l>(And where did you come from, baby)

</l>
<l>Who are you gonna give yourself to

</l>
<l>Baby, what are your plans

</l>
<l>Tell me, girl

</l>
<l>Who are you

</l>
<l>And where are we going

</l>
<l>Will you give yourself to me

</l>
<l>Or some other man, baby



</l>
<l>Who are you, baby, who are you

</l>
<l>Who are you, baby, who are you

</l>
<l>I'd really like to know about you, baby

</l>
<l>Who are you, baby

</l>
<l>Where are we going

</l>
<l>Where did you come from, baby...</l></lyrics></xml>
