<lyrics>



I got a good rockin' mama, yeah and the way she rock is all
right

Got a good rockin' mama, and the way she rock is all right

She rock me in the mornin', she rock me late at night



Now, don't you want to rock?

Don't you want to rock?

Don't you want to rock?

Rock me, mama, rock me all night long

Yeah, good rockin' mama



We rocked last night and-a rocked the night before

We rocked last night and rocked the night before

Say, yes she rock me, rock me ev'ry night



Now, don't you want to rock?

Don't you want to rock?

Don't you want to rock?

Rock me, mama, rock me all night long

Rock it now man, oh yeah



Don't need no steam heat, yo body keeps me warm

Don't need no steam heater, her body keeps me warm

She rocks me at midnight, she rock me till the break o'day



Now, don't you want to rock?

Don't you want to rock?

Don't you want to rock?

Rock me, mama, rock me all night long
