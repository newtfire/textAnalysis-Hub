<lyrics>


<l>Just tell me baby!

</l>
<l>Just tell me baby!

</l>
<l>What can I do to change your mind?

</l>
<l>Hey, hey, hey baby

</l>
<l>What can I do to change your mind

</l>
<l>I've got the freight train blues

</l>
<l>Baby, and the tracks are all out of line



</l>
<l>You say you love me

</l>
<l>I believe you do

</l>
<l>But I think you're trying to quit me

</l>
<l>And what more can I do?



</l>
<l>Hey, hey, hey baby

</l>
<l>What can I do to change your mind?

</l>
<l>I've got the blues about you baby

</l>
<l>You keep me worried all the time



</l>
<l>You've got a man in the east

</l>
<l>You've got a man in the west

</l>
<l>I'm sitting here wondering

</l>
<l>Which one you love the best



</l>
<l>Hey, hey, hey baby

</l>
<l>What can I do to change your mind?

</l>
<l>Got the blues about you baby

</l>
<l>Keep me worried all the time</l></lyrics></xml>
