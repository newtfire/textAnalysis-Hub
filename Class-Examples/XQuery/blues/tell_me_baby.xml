<lyrics>



Just tell me baby!

Just tell me baby!

What can I do to change your mind?

Hey, hey, hey baby

What can I do to change your mind

I've got the freight train blues

Baby, and the tracks are all out of line



You say you love me

I believe you do

But I think you're trying to quit me

And what more can I do?



Hey, hey, hey baby

What can I do to change your mind?

I've got the blues about you baby

You keep me worried all the time



You've got a man in the east

You've got a man in the west

I'm sitting here wondering

Which one you love the best



Hey, hey, hey baby

What can I do to change your mind?

Got the blues about you baby

Keep me worried all the time
