<lyrics>


<l>I've been down hearted baby, ever since the day we met

</l>
<l>I said I've been down hearted baby, ever since the day we met

</l>
<l>Our love is nothing but the blues, baby, how blue can you get?



</l>
<l>You're evil when I'm with you, baby, and you're jealous when we're
apart

</l>
<l>I said you're evil when I'm with you, baby, and you're jealous when
we're apart

</l>
<l>How blue can you get baby, the answer is right here in my heart



</l>
<l>I gave you a brand new Ford, but you said: "I want a Cadillac"

</l>
<l>I bought you a ten dollar dinner, and you said: thanks for the
snack

</l>
<l>I let you live in my penthouse, you said it just a shack



</l>
<l>I gave seven children, and now you wanna give them back

</l>
<l>I said I've been down hearted baby, ever since the day we met

</l><l>Our love is nothing but the blues, baby, how blue can you get?</l></lyrics></xml>
