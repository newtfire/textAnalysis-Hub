<lyrics>



I've been down hearted baby, ever since the day we met

I said I've been down hearted baby, ever since the day we met

Our love is nothing but the blues, baby, how blue can you get?



You're evil when I'm with you, baby, and you're jealous when we're
apart

I said you're evil when I'm with you, baby, and you're jealous when
we're apart

How blue can you get baby, the answer is right here in my heart



I gave you a brand new Ford, but you said: "I want a Cadillac"

I bought you a ten dollar dinner, and you said: thanks for the
snack

I let you live in my penthouse, you said it just a shack



I gave seven children, and now you wanna give them back

I said I've been down hearted baby, ever since the day we met

Our love is nothing but the blues, baby, how blue can you get?
