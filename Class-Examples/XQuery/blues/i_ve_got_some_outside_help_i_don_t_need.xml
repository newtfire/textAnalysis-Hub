<lyrics>


<l>All of your affection is gone baby and your love is growing cold

</l>
<l>I've said all of your affection is gone baby and your love is growing
cold

</l>
<l>Hey, I've got a new story to tell you this evening, baby

</l>
<l>One that ain't never been told



</l>
<l>I went to work the other day

</l>
<l>But I thought that I would double back

</l>
<l>And that car I saw sitting in front of my door

</l>
<l>Looked like a brand new, a brand new Cadillac, yeah!



</l>
<l>I ain't got none now baby

</l>
<l>I think you've been cheating on me

</l>
<l>I believe to my soul baby, that you've given me some outside help

</l>
<l>That I don't think I really need



</l>
<l>The iceman came by this morning

</l>
<l>And you know he didn't leave no ice

</l>
<l>The postman came by later baby

</l>
<l>And he didn't even ring twice



</l>
<l>I think you've been cheating on me

</l>
<l>I think you're running out on me

</l>
<l>I believe to my soul baby, that you've given me some outside help

</l>
<l>That I don't think I really need



</l>
<l>Now, I want you to tell the iceman

</l>
<l>The next time he'd better leave some ice

</l>
<l>And I want you to tell the postman

</l>
<l>He'd better ring more than twice



</l>
<l>And when I come home from work in the morning

</l>
<l>Better still be some groceries on the shelf

</l>
<l>I want to tell that slick insurance man

</l>
<l>That he'd better write some insurance on his self



</l>
<l>Yes, I think you've been cheating on me

</l>
<l>I think you're running out on me

</l>
<l>I believe to my soul baby, that you've given me some help, some
help

</l>
<l>Some help, I don't really need</l></lyrics></xml>
