<lyrics>



All of your affection is gone baby and your love is growing cold

I've said all of your affection is gone baby and your love is growing
cold

Hey, I've got a new story to tell you this evening, baby

One that ain't never been told



I went to work the other day

But I thought that I would double back

And that car I saw sitting in front of my door

Looked like a brand new, a brand new Cadillac, yeah!



I ain't got none now baby

I think you've been cheating on me

I believe to my soul baby, that you've given me some outside help

That I don't think I really need



The iceman came by this morning

And you know he didn't leave no ice

The postman came by later baby

And he didn't even ring twice



I think you've been cheating on me

I think you're running out on me

I believe to my soul baby, that you've given me some outside help

That I don't think I really need



Now, I want you to tell the iceman

The next time he'd better leave some ice

And I want you to tell the postman

He'd better ring more than twice



And when I come home from work in the morning

Better still be some groceries on the shelf

I want to tell that slick insurance man

That he'd better write some insurance on his self



Yes, I think you've been cheating on me

I think you're running out on me

I believe to my soul baby, that you've given me some help, some
help

Some help, I don't really need
