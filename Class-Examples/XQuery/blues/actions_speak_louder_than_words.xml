<lyrics>


<l>You won't listen to nothing I tell you, baby, you keep on doing just
as you please

</l>
<l>Hey, you won't do nothing I tell you, baby, keep on doing as you
please

</l>
<l>I've taken as long as I can, baby, when is this foolishness gonna

cease




</l>
<l>I've worried myself crazy, baby, cried both night and day

</l>
<l>I said I've worried myself crazy, baby, cried both night and day

</l>
<l>You don't believe me, baby, but I'm gonna leave one of these days



</l>
<l>Well, you told me that you love me, but actions speak louder than
words

</l>
<l>Oh, you said you love me, baby, but action speaks louder than
words

</l>
<l>I won't be fooled no longer, baby, that line everybody's heard



</l>
<l>Well, If you're gonna change, baby, you better do it real soon

</l>
<l>Hey, If you're gonna change, for the better, baby, you better do it
real soon

</l>
<l>Because you'll wake up one of these mornings, find yourself in a

empty room
