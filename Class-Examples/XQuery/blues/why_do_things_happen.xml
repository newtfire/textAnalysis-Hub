<lyrics>


<l>I wonder why, why do everything have to happen to me

</l>
<l>I wonder why, why do everything have to happen to me

</l>
<l>Well, I'm blue and I'm lonesome, my heart is filled with misery



</l>
<l>Oh, so many strange things, they happen to me all day long

</l>
<l>Oh, so many strange things, they happen to me all day long

</l>
<l>yes, it seems like everything I do, everything I do is wrong



</l>
<l>I had a good reputation, the greatest man in town

</l>
<l>But I'm having so much troubles, till they 'bout to drag me down



</l>
<l>I wonder why, why do everything have to happen to me

</l>
<l>I wonder why, why do everything have to happen to me

</l>
<l>Well, I'm blue and I'm lonesome, my heart is filled with misery



</l>
<l>I got up on my feet, I had lots of friends

</l>
<l>But bad luck had hit me, now I'm down again</l></lyrics></xml>
