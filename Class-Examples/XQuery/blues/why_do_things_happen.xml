<lyrics>



I wonder why, why do everything have to happen to me

I wonder why, why do everything have to happen to me

Well, I'm blue and I'm lonesome, my heart is filled with misery



Oh, so many strange things, they happen to me all day long

Oh, so many strange things, they happen to me all day long

yes, it seems like everything I do, everything I do is wrong



I had a good reputation, the greatest man in town

But I'm having so much troubles, till they 'bout to drag me down



I wonder why, why do everything have to happen to me

I wonder why, why do everything have to happen to me

Well, I'm blue and I'm lonesome, my heart is filled with misery



I got up on my feet, I had lots of friends

But bad luck had hit me, now I'm down again
