<lyrics>



None of my business, getting all of my concern

Tried to put out the fire, but the flame still burns

And as she pleases she comes and goes

She's got the wind in her hair

She never ceases to hurt me so



Does she really care?

Is she ever coming home?

Is she ever gonna phone?

Another night alone



Has anybody seen my girl?

Has anybody seen my woman?

California, Tennessee

Send my baby home to me



Where am I going, oh what am I gonna do?

I know I'm not crazy, I'm just hooked on you

So go on and use me endlessly

Could you let me know

When you need me hold me close

And baby don't let go

Are you ever coming home?

Are you ever gonna phone?

Another night alone



Has anybody seen my girl?

Has anybody seen my woman?

California, Tennessee

Send my baby home to me



Has anybody seen my girl?

Has anybody seen my woman?

California, Tennessee

Send my baby home to me
