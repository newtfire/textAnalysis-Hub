<lyrics>


<l>None of my business, getting all of my concern

</l>
<l>Tried to put out the fire, but the flame still burns

</l>
<l>And as she pleases she comes and goes

</l>
<l>She's got the wind in her hair

</l>
<l>She never ceases to hurt me so



</l>
<l>Does she really care?

</l>
<l>Is she ever coming home?

</l>
<l>Is she ever gonna phone?

</l>
<l>Another night alone



</l>
<l>Has anybody seen my girl?

</l>
<l>Has anybody seen my woman?

</l>
<l>California, Tennessee

</l>
<l>Send my baby home to me



</l>
<l>Where am I going, oh what am I gonna do?

</l>
<l>I know I'm not crazy, I'm just hooked on you

</l>
<l>So go on and use me endlessly

</l>
<l>Could you let me know

</l>
<l>When you need me hold me close

</l>
<l>And baby don't let go

</l>
<l>Are you ever coming home?

</l>
<l>Are you ever gonna phone?

</l>
<l>Another night alone



</l>
<l>Has anybody seen my girl?

</l>
<l>Has anybody seen my woman?

</l>
<l>California, Tennessee

</l>
<l>Send my baby home to me



</l>
<l>Has anybody seen my girl?

</l>
<l>Has anybody seen my woman?

</l>
<l>California, Tennessee

</l>
<l>Send my baby home to me</l></lyrics></xml>
