<lyrics>



I don't want nobody telling me what to do

I don't want nobody telling me what to do

Oh I'm gonna leave you darlin', 'cause I'm just as grown as you



I don't want nobody telling me this and that

I don't want nobody telling me this and that

Oh I'm gonna leave you darling, 'cause I don't go for that



You drink your whiskey, I'll drink my wine

You tend to your business and I'll tend to mine



I don't want nobody telling me how to live my life

Oh I'm gonna leave you darling, just don't want to be your wife



Well you used to boss your girl, that I won't deny

Before I let you boss me I'm gonna lay down and die



I don't want nobody telling me what to do

I don't want nobody telling me what to do

Oh I'm gonna leave you darlin', 'cause I'm just as grown as you
