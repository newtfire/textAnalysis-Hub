<lyrics>



When you left me this mornin',

you taken my heart away,

When you left me this mornin',

you taken my heart away,

That's allright baby,

you will come back home someday



How long, baby, how long, how long

How long, baby, how long, how long

You know I love you

you started doin' me wrong



Well when you leave home,

you can call me on your phone

Well when you leave home,

you can call me on your phone

I'll sent you you're money

darlin' you come back home

Oh come back



How long, have you gone do me wrong

How long, have you gone do me wrong

Ain't nobody never lived that,

gettin' do somebody wrong
