<l>Ev'rybody wants to laugh

</l>
<l>Ah, but nobody wants to cry

</l>
<l>I say ev'rybody wants to laugh

</l>
<l>But nobody wants to cry



</l>
<l>Ev'rybody wants to go to heaven

</l>
<l>But nobody wants to die



</l>
<l>Ev'rybody wanna hear the truth

</l>
<l>But yet, ev'rybody wants to tell a lie

</l>
<l>I say ev'rybody wants to hear the truth

</l>
<l>But still they all wanna tell a lie



</l>
<l>Oh ev'rybody wants to go to heaven

</l>
<l>But nobody wants to die



</l>
<l>Ev'rybody wanna know the reason

</l>
<l>Without even askin' why
