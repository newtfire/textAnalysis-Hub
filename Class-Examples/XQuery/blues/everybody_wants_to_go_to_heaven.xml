<lyrics>



Ev'rybody wants to laugh

Ah, but nobody wants to cry

I say ev'rybody wants to laugh

But nobody wants to cry



Ev'rybody wants to go to heaven

But nobody wants to die



Ev'rybody wanna hear the truth

But yet, ev'rybody wants to tell a lie

I say ev'rybody wants to hear the truth

But still they all wanna tell a lie



Oh ev'rybody wants to go to heaven

But nobody wants to die



Ev'rybody wanna know the reason

Without even askin' why

Oh, ev'rybody wanna know the reason

Oh, without even askin' why



You know ev'rybody wanna go to heaven

But nobody wants to die
