<l>Walk right in and sit right down, daddy, let your mind roll on

</l>
<l>You'd better walk right in and stay a little while, daddy, you can't
stay too long

</l>
<l>Now everybody's talkin' 'bout your new way of walkin', do you wanna
lose your mind?

</l>
<l>Lord, walk right in and sit right down, daddy, let your mind roll

on




</l>
<l>Walk right in and sit right down, and daddy, let your hair hang
low

</l>
<l>You'd better walk right in and stay a little while, daddy, you can
stay too long

</l>
<l>Now everybody's talkin' 'bout a new way of walkin', do you wanna lose
your mind?

</l>
<l>Lord, walk right in and sit right down, daddy, let your mind roll

on




</l>
<l>Walk right in and sit right down, daddy, let your mind roll on

</l>
<l>You'd better walk right in and stay a little while, daddy, you can't
stay too long

</l>
<l>Now everybody's talkin' 'bout a two-way woman, do you wanna lose your
mind?

</l><l>You'd better walk right in, sit right down, daddy, let your mind roll</l>
<l>on!</l></lyrics></xml>
