<lyrics>



When you lose your money don't lose your mind

When you lose your money don't lose your mind

When you lose your good man please don't mess with mine



And I'm gonna buy me a bulldog to watch my man while he sleeps

I'm gonna buy me a bulldog to watch my man while he sleeps

Men are so doggone crooked, afraid he might make a four day
creep
1



Girls I'm gonna tell you this, ain't gonna tell you nothin' else

Girls I'm gonna tell you this, ain't gonna tell you nothin' else

Any woman's a fool who thinks she's got a whole man by herself



But if you got a good man and don't want him taken away from you

Girls if you got a good man and don't want him taken away from
you

Don't ever tell your friend woman what your man can do



Lord Lord I'm getting up in years

Lordy Lordy Lordy I'm getting up in years

But mama ain't too old to shift her gears



And I'm a big fat mama, got the meat shakin' on my bones

I'm a big fat mama, got the meat shakin' on my bones

And every time I shake, some skinny gal loses her home



__________

Note 1: four day creep, or 'fore (from: before) day creep, to betray
one's wife or lover with another lover.
