<lyrics>

<l>When you lose your money don't lose your mind

</l>
<l>When you lose your money don't lose your mind

</l>
<l>When you lose your good man please don't mess with mine



</l>
<l>And I'm gonna buy me a bulldog to watch my man while he sleeps

</l>
<l>I'm gonna buy me a bulldog to watch my man while he sleeps

</l>
<l>Men are so doggone crooked, afraid he might make a four day
creep
1



</l>
<l>Girls I'm gonna tell you this, ain't gonna tell you nothin' else

</l>
<l>Girls I'm gonna tell you this, ain't gonna tell you nothin' else

</l>
<l>Any woman's a fool who thinks she's got a whole man by herself



</l>
<l>But if you got a good man and don't want him taken away from you

</l>
<l>Girls if you got a good man and don't want him taken away from
you

</l>
<l>Don't ever tell your friend woman what your man can do



</l>
<l>Lord Lord I'm getting up in years

</l>
<l>Lordy Lordy Lordy I'm getting up in years

</l>
<l>But mama ain't too old to shift her gears



</l>
<l>And I'm a big fat mama, got the meat shakin' on my bones

</l>
<l>I'm a big fat mama, got the meat shakin' on my bones

</l>
<l>And every time I shake, some skinny gal loses her home



</l>
