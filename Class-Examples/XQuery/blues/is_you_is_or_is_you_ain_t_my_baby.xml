<lyrics>


<l>I gotta a girl who's always late

</l>
<l>Anytime we have a date

</l>
<l>But I love her

</l>
<l>Yes I love her

</l>
<l>I'm gonna walk up to her gate

</l>
<l>And see if I can get it straight



</l>
<l>'Cause I want her

</l>
<l>I'm gonna ask her

</l>
<l>Is you is, or is you ain't, my baby

</l>
<l>The way you're acting lately makes me doubt

</l>
<l>You is still my baby, baby



</l>
<l>Seems my flame in your heart's done gone out

</l>
<l>A woman is a creature that has always been strange

</l>
<l>Just when you're sure of one you find

</l>
<l>She's gone and made a change

</l>
<l>Is you is, or is you ain't my baby



</l>
<l>Maybe baby's found somebody new

</l><l>Or is my baby still my baby true</l></lyrics></xml>
