<lyrics>



Don't care when you go

How long you stay

But good kind treatments

Will bring you back someday

But someday baby

I ain't gonna worry my life anymore



Aw, but one thing

Really give me the blues

When I wore a hole

In my last pair of shoes

But someday baby

I ain't gonna worry my life anymore



Just keep on a-bettin'
1

About the dice don't pass

You're gonna leave here runnin'

Almost too fast

But someday baby

I ain't gonna worry my life anymore



Don't like everybody

In my neighborhood

I got a no-good woman

She don't mean me no good

But someday baby

I ain't gonna worry my life anymore
