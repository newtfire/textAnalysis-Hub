<lyrics>


<l>Don't care when you go

</l>
<l>How long you stay

</l>
<l>But good kind treatments

</l>
<l>Will bring you back someday

</l>
<l>But someday baby

</l>
<l>I ain't gonna worry my life anymore



</l>
<l>Aw, but one thing

</l>
<l>Really give me the blues

</l>
<l>When I wore a hole

</l>
<l>In my last pair of shoes

</l>
<l>But someday baby

</l>
<l>I ain't gonna worry my life anymore



</l>
<l>Just keep on a-bettin'
1

</l>
<l>About the dice don't pass

</l>
<l>You're gonna leave here runnin'

</l>
<l>Almost too fast

</l>
<l>But someday baby

</l>
<l>I ain't gonna worry my life anymore



</l>
<l>Don't like everybody

</l>
<l>In my neighborhood

</l>
<l>I got a no-good woman

</l>
<l>She don't mean me no good

</l>
<l>But someday baby

</l>
<l>I ain't gonna worry my life anymore
