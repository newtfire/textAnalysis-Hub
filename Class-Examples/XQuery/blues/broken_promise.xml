<lyrics>


<l>You broke your promise, baby

</l>
<l>You don't love, honor or obey

</l>
<l>You won't do nothing I tell you

</l>
<l>You go on mistreating me everyday

</l>
<l>You're hardly acting your part, baby

</l>
<l>You won't do nothing the preacher says



</l>
<l>You don't love me, baby

</l>
<l>You don't even wish me well

</l>
<l>Honor's just a joke with you, baby

</l>
<l>You don't love me, I can tell

</l>
<l>Married life with you, baby

</l>
<l>I'd rather be living in a cell



</l>
<l>You deceive me, baby

</l>
<l>You use me like a child

</l>
<l>You tricked me into loving you, baby

</l>
<l>I was loving you all the while

</l>
<l>You played with my heart, baby

</l>
<l>I said I was loving you all the while</l></lyrics></xml>
