<lyrics>



She's just a ghetto woman, waitin' for her man to come home

Oh she's just a ghetto woman, waitin' for her man to come home

Said she's a ghetto woman, waitin' for her man to come home



A rat run cross the floor, a roach ran up the wall

Everything is noise around her, that don't seem to bother her at
all

Ghetto woman, sittin' there all alone

She's a ghetto woman, waitin' for her man to come home



Yes the t.v.'s on, radio blastin' the news

Somebody down the hall, playin' the low down dirty blues

Oh, ghetto woman, she's all alone

She's just a ghetto woman, waitin' for her man to come home



Oh she's a ghetto woman, she's a ghetto woman

Oh, ghetto woman, what's on your mind

Sometimes I look in your face, can't help but cry
