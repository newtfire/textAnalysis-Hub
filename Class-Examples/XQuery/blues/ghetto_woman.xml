<lyrics>


<l>She's just a ghetto woman, waitin' for her man to come home

</l>
<l>Oh she's just a ghetto woman, waitin' for her man to come home

</l>
<l>Said she's a ghetto woman, waitin' for her man to come home



</l>
<l>A rat run cross the floor, a roach ran up the wall

</l>
<l>Everything is noise around her, that don't seem to bother her at
all

</l>
<l>Ghetto woman, sittin' there all alone

</l>
<l>She's a ghetto woman, waitin' for her man to come home



</l>
<l>Yes the t.v.'s on, radio blastin' the news

</l>
<l>Somebody down the hall, playin' the low down dirty blues

</l>
<l>Oh, ghetto woman, she's all alone

</l>
<l>She's just a ghetto woman, waitin' for her man to come home



</l>
<l>Oh she's a ghetto woman, she's a ghetto woman

</l>
<l>Oh, ghetto woman, what's on your mind

</l>
<l>Sometimes I look in your face, can't help but cry</l></lyrics></xml>
