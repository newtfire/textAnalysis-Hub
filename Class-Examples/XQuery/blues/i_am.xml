<lyrics>





If being in love means waiting around,
so you can dance with me
I am, I am
If being in love means follow the leader,
then this will have to be
I am, I am

I am, I am
Baby I am
So in love with you
I am, I am
Gonna get you baby, if it's the last thing I do

I used to think that a pretty face,
meant more than what was inside
I did, I did
If being a good man, means swallowing all my pride
I will, yes I will

Repeat chorus:

I am the one who loves you,
I am the one who cares
You could fly me to the moon,
if I would find you there
All the riches in this world mean nothing,
without you here
Whoever, whatever, however, whenever,
you need me I'm always here

Men killing their brothers
Nobody wants to go down alone,
in this age of uncertainty

Love's worth more than gold
I'd sleep outside your window,
if that would make you see
That I'm the only one for you,
and you're the only one for me
