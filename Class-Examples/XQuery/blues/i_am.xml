<lyrics>


<l>If being in love means waiting around,

so you can dance with me
I am, I am
If being in love means follow the leader,
then this will have to be
I am, I am


</l>
<l>I am, I am

Baby I am
So in love with you
I am, I am
Gonna get you baby, if it's the last thing I do


</l>
<l>I used to think that a pretty face,

meant more than what was inside
I did, I did
If being a good man, means swallowing all my pride
I will, yes I will


</l>
<l>Repeat chorus:

</l>
<l>I am the one who loves you,

I am the one who cares
You could fly me to the moon,
if I would find you there
All the riches in this world mean nothing,
without you here
Whoever, whatever, however, whenever,
you need me I'm always here


</l>
<l>Men killing their brothers
Nobody wants to go down alone,
in this age of uncertainty

</l><l>Love's worth more than gold</l>
<l>I'd sleep outside your window,</l>
<l>if that would make you see</l>
<l>That I'm the only one for you,</l>
<l>and you're the only one for me</l></lyrics></xml>
