<lyrics>



You know I'm a howlin' wolf, and I been howlin' all around
your door

Well you know I'm a howlin' wolf, and I been howlin' all around your
door

If you give me what I want little girl, and you won't hear me howl no
more



You know when I get-ta howlin', I dig me a hole down in the
ground

Well when I get-ta howlin', I dig me a hole down in the ground

Some people call me a black panther, but my baby, she knows the way I
sound



I'll howl so long, ya know it make my time go slow

I'll howl so long, if you give me what I want little girl

And you won't hear me howl no more



Well when I get-ta howlin', they call me "Too Bad Jim"

Yeah when I get-ta howlin', ya know they call me "Too Bad Jim"

You know I get so bad sometime

I get real bad..., and I be jumpin' from limb to limb!
