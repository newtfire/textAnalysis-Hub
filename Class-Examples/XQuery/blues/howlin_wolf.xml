<lyrics>


<l>You know I'm a howlin' wolf, and I been howlin' all around
your door

</l>
<l>Well you know I'm a howlin' wolf, and I been howlin' all around your
door

</l>
<l>If you give me what I want little girl, and you won't hear me howl no

more




</l>
<l>You know when I get-ta howlin', I dig me a hole down in the
ground

</l>
<l>Well when I get-ta howlin', I dig me a hole down in the ground

</l>
<l>Some people call me a black panther, but my baby, she knows the way I

sound




</l>
<l>I'll howl so long, ya know it make my time go slow

</l>
<l>I'll howl so long, if you give me what I want little girl

</l>
<l>And you won't hear me howl no more



</l>
<l>Well when I get-ta howlin', they call me "Too Bad Jim"

</l>
<l>Yeah when I get-ta howlin', ya know they call me "Too Bad Jim"

</l>
<l>You know I get so bad sometime

</l>
<l>I get real bad..., and I be jumpin' from limb to limb!</l></lyrics></xml>
