<lyrics>



Oh, Lordy, Lord

Oh, Lordy, Lord

Oh, it hurt me so bad for us to part

Oh, but some day, baby, I ain't gonna worry my life anymore



You on my mind every place I go

Oh, how much I love you, baby, you will never know

Oh, but some day, baby, I ain't gonna worry my life anymore



Oh, that's my story

All I've got to say to you

Oh, goodbye baby, I don't care what you do

Oh, but some day, baby, I ain't gonna worry my life anymore
