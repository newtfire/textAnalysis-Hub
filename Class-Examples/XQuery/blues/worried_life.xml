<l>Oh, Lordy, Lord

</l>
<l>Oh, Lordy, Lord

</l>
<l>Oh, it hurt me so bad for us to part

</l>
<l>Oh, but some day, baby, I ain't gonna worry my life anymore



</l>
<l>You on my mind every place I go

</l>
<l>Oh, how much I love you, baby, you will never know

</l>
<l>Oh, but some day, baby, I ain't gonna worry my life anymore



</l>
<l>Oh, that's my story

</l>
<l>All I've got to say to you

</l>
<l>Oh, goodbye baby, I don't care what you do

</l><l>Oh, but some day, baby, I ain't gonna worry my life anymore</l></lyrics></xml>
