<lyrics>



Now when a little girl becomin' twelve years old

Beginnin' to think she's grown

Well you can never catch that kinda, little girl at home

But ya have to go down early in the mornin'

Baby 'bout the break of day

Now ya oughta see me grab the pillow

Where my baby used to lay



Now that I've got a new woman

Her name is Miss Kate

She told me to come to the house this mornin'

I got there about half past eight

She says, "I told you come early in the mornin' "

Baby 'bout the break of day

Now you oughta see me grab the pillow

Where my baby used to lay



I said, "Look-a-here woman, you fool with too many men,

I can't never come to see you in the evenin',

I have to, come see you when I can"

You tell come early in the mornin'

Baby 'bout the break of day

Now you oughta see me grab the pillow

Where my baby used to lay



Well I said, "Look-a-here woman,

I ain't gonna fool around wit' you no mo',

I know you don't love me, you out an 'round Mister So an So

You tell me, come early in the mornin'

Baby 'bout the break of day

Now you oughta see me grab the pillow

Where my baby used to lay
