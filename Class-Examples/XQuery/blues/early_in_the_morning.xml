<l>Now when a little girl becomin' twelve years old

</l>
<l>Beginnin' to think she's grown

</l>
<l>Well you can never catch that kinda, little girl at home

</l>
<l>But ya have to go down early in the mornin'

</l>
<l>Baby 'bout the break of day

</l>
<l>Now ya oughta see me grab the pillow

</l>
<l>Where my baby used to lay



</l>
<l>Now that I've got a new woman

</l>
<l>Her name is Miss Kate

</l>
<l>She told me to come to the house this mornin'

</l>
<l>I got there about half past eight

</l>
<l>She says, "I told you come early in the mornin' "

</l>
<l>Baby 'bout the break of day

</l>
<l>Now you oughta see me grab the pillow

</l>
<l>Where my baby used to lay



</l>
<l>I said, "Look-a-here woman, you fool with too many men,

</l>
<l>I can't never come to see you in the evenin',

</l>
<l>I have to, come see you when I can"

</l>
<l>You tell come early in the mornin'

</l>
<l>Baby 'bout the break of day

</l>
<l>Now you oughta see me grab the pillow

</l>
<l>Where my baby used to lay



</l>
<l>Well I said, "Look-a-here woman,

</l>
<l>I ain't gonna fool around wit' you no mo',

</l>
<l>I know you don't love me, you out an 'round Mister So an So

</l>
<l>You tell me, come early in the mornin'

</l>
<l>Baby 'bout the break of day

</l>
<l>Now you oughta see me grab the pillow

</l>
<l>Where my baby used to lay</l></lyrics></xml>
