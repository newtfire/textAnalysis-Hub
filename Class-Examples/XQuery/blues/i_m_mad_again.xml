<lyrics>



I had a friend one time, at least I thought I did

Taken that man in my house, give him my food,

over my table, that I couldn't afford



He come to me, he said "Johnny, ain't got no place to stay"

I said "Yes man, come to my house"

I get you a place to stay, and a bed to sleep in,

that I couldn't afford



When I found out, you with my wife,

now I'm mad, like Al Capone

Well I warned you one time,

next time I warn you,

I'm gonna use my gun on you

'Cause I'm mad with you, hahaha

I'm mad with you, like Al Capone



Look man, I told you one time before

But this time, I'm gonna teach you,

a little lesson, you won't forget

Take this man, right down by, the riverside

I might drown you,

I might shoot you,

I don't know

gonna tie your hands, gonna tie your feet

gag you so you can't talk to nobody

I'm mad, rrrrr, I'm mad with you

you're sinkin', I'm mad
