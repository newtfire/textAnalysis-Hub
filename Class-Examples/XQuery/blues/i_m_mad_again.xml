<lyrics>


<l>I had a friend one time, at least I thought I did

</l>
<l>Taken that man in my house, give him my food,

</l>
<l>over my table, that I couldn't afford



</l>
<l>He come to me, he said "Johnny, ain't got no place to stay"

</l>
<l>I said "Yes man, come to my house"

</l>
<l>I get you a place to stay, and a bed to sleep in,

</l>
<l>that I couldn't afford



</l>
<l>When I found out, you with my wife,

</l>
<l>now I'm mad, like Al Capone

</l>
<l>Well I warned you one time,

</l>
<l>next time I warn you,

</l>
<l>I'm gonna use my gun on you

</l>
<l>'Cause I'm mad with you, hahaha

</l>
<l>I'm mad with you, like Al Capone



</l>
<l>Look man, I told you one time before

</l>
<l>But this time, I'm gonna teach you,

</l>
<l>a little lesson, you won't forget

</l>
<l>Take this man, right down by, the riverside

</l>
<l>I might drown you,

</l>
<l>I might shoot you,

</l>
<l>I don't know

</l>
<l>gonna tie your hands, gonna tie your feet

</l>
<l>gag you so you can't talk to nobody

</l>
<l>I'm mad, rrrrr, I'm mad with you

</l>
<l>you're sinkin', I'm mad</l></lyrics></xml>
