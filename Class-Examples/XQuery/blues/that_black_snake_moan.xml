<l>

I - I ain't got no mama now
I - I ain't got no mama now
She told me late last night, "You don't need no mama no how"


</l>
<l>Mmm, mmm, black snake crawlin' in my room
Mmm, mmm, black snake crawlin' in my room
Some pretty mama better come and get this black snake soon

</l>
<l>Ohh-oh, that must have been a bed bug, baby a chinch can't bite that hard

1
Ohh-oh, that must have been a bed bug, honey a chinch can't bite that hard
Ask my sugar for fifty cents, she said "Lemon, ain't a child in the yard"


</l>
<l>Mama, that's all right, mama that's all right for you

Mama, that's all right, mama that's all right for you
Mama, that's all right, most seen all you do

</l>
<l>Mmm, mmm, what's the matter now?
Mmm, mmm, honey what's the matter now?
Sugar, what's the matter, don't like no black snake no how

</l>
<l>Mmm, mmm, wonder where my black snake gone?
Mmm, mmm, wonder where this black snake gone?
Black snake mama done run my darlin' home

</l>

<note>Note: Jefferson's first single for Paramount was also his most successful recording. An excellent example of how Blind Lemon used overtly suggestive sexual imagery without becoming salacious;
Note 1: Chinch bug, defined in different terms as a type of bed bug and as another insect which is destructive to types of lawn grass;
Note 2: lyric is garbled, "Most seen all you do" is a best guess.</note></lyrics></xml>
