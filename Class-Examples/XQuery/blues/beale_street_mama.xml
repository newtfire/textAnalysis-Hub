<lyrics>

<l>Minnie Neal down in Beale
1
, gave her papa the
air

</l>
<l>Left him cold, got him told, said she didn't care

</l>
<l>Poor Joe, her beau, looked just like he would die

</l>
<l>If you were near him, you would hear him, start his mournful cry



</l>
<l>Beale Street
1
papa, why don't you come back home </l>
<l>
It isn't proper to leave your mama all alone

</l>
<l>Sometimes I was cruel, that was true

</l>
<l>But papa you know mama never two-times
2
you </l>
<l>
Ooh-ooh, I'm blue

</l>
<l>So how come you do me like you do, I'm crying

</l>
<l>Beale Street papa, don't mess around with me

</l>
<l>There's plenty of petting that I can get in Tennessee

</l>
<l>I still get my sweet cookies constantly

</l>
<l>But not the kind you serve to me

</l>
<l>So Beale Street papa, come back home



</l>
<l>So how come you do me like you do, I'm crying

</l>
<l>Beale Street papa, don't mess around with me

</l>
<l>There's plenty of petting that I can get in Tennessee

</l>
<l>I bought a rifle, razor and a knife,

</l>
<l>a postal card can't save my life

</l>
<l>So Beale Street papa, come back home
