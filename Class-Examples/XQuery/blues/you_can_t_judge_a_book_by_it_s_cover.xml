You can't judge an apple by looking at a tree

You can't judge honey by looking at the bee

You can't judge a daughter by looking at the mother

You can't judge a book by looking at the cover



Oh can't you see, oh you misjudge me

I look like a farmer, but I'm a lover

You can't judge a book by looking at the cover



Oh come on in closer baby,

hear what else I gotta say!

You got your radio turned down too low

Turn it up!



You can't judge sugar by looking at the cane

You can't judge a woman by looking at her man

You can't judge a sister by looking at her brother

You can't judge a book by looking at the cover



Oh can't you see, oh you misjudge me

I look like a farmer, but I'm a Lover

You can't judge a book by looking at the cover



You can't judge a fish by lookin' in the pond

You can't judge right from looking at the wrong

You can't judge one by looking at the other

You can't judge a book by looking at the cover



Oh can't you see, oh you misjudge me

I look like a farmer, but I'm a lover

You can't judge a book by looking at the cover
