<lyrics>


<l>You can't judge an apple by looking at a tree

</l>
<l>You can't judge honey by looking at the bee

</l>
<l>You can't judge a daughter by looking at the mother

</l>
<l>You can't judge a book by looking at the cover



</l>
<l>Oh can't you see, oh you misjudge me

</l>
<l>I look like a farmer, but I'm a lover

</l>
<l>You can't judge a book by looking at the cover



</l>
<l>Oh come on in closer baby,

</l>
<l>hear what else I gotta say!

</l>
<l>You got your radio turned down too low

</l>
<l>Turn it up!



</l>
<l>You can't judge sugar by looking at the cane

</l>
<l>You can't judge a woman by looking at her man

</l>
<l>You can't judge a sister by looking at her brother

</l>
<l>You can't judge a book by looking at the cover



</l>
<l>Oh can't you see, oh you misjudge me

</l>
<l>I look like a farmer, but I'm a Lover

</l>
<l>You can't judge a book by looking at the cover



</l>
<l>You can't judge a fish by lookin' in the pond

</l>
<l>You can't judge right from looking at the wrong

</l>
<l>You can't judge one by looking at the other

</l>
<l>You can't judge a book by looking at the cover



</l>
<l>Oh can't you see, oh you misjudge me

</l>
<l>I look like a farmer, but I'm a lover

</l>
<l>You can't judge a book by looking at the cover</l></lyrics></xml>
