<lyrics>



Come here pretty papa, sit down on your mama's knee

Come here pretty papa, sit down on your mama's knee

I don't want to tell you how you have mistreated me



You leave me after supper and you don't come home till morn'

You leave me after supper and you don't come home till morn'

You'll come home some morning and find your cherry tree gone



You can't slip back to your 
brownskin
,
I mean your used-to-be

You can't slip back to your brownskin, I mean your used-to-be

I know you're crazy 'bout your cherry pie but you can't
two-time
1
 me



I've got my trunk all packed and I'm going to leave this town

I've got my trunk all packed and I'm going to leave this town

Goodbye little papa, another man has cut your cherry tree down



__________

Note 1: two-time me, to betray (a spouse or lover) by secret
lovemaking with another.
