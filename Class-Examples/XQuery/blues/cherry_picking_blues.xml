<lyrics>

<l>Come here pretty papa, sit down on your mama's knee

</l>
<l>Come here pretty papa, sit down on your mama's knee

</l>
<l>I don't want to tell you how you have mistreated me



</l>
<l>You leave me after supper and you don't come home till morn'

</l>
<l>You leave me after supper and you don't come home till morn'

</l>
<l>You'll come home some morning and find your cherry tree gone



</l>
<l>You can't slip back to your 
brownskin
,
I mean your used-to-be

</l>
<l>You can't slip back to your brownskin, I mean your used-to-be

</l>
<l>I know you're crazy 'bout your cherry pie but you can't
two-time
1
me </l>

<l>I've got my trunk all packed and I'm going to leave this town

</l>
<l>I've got my trunk all packed and I'm going to leave this town

</l>
<l>Goodbye little papa, another man has cut your cherry tree down



</l>

lovemaking with another</note></lyrics></xml>
