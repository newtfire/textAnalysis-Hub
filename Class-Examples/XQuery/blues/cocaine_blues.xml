<lyrics>


<l>Early one morning while makin' the rounds,

</l>
<l>I took a shot of cocaine and I shot my baby down

</l>
<l>I shot her down then I went to bed,

</l>
<l>I stuck that lovin' forty-four beneath my head



</l>
<l>Woke up next morning and I grabbed that gun,

</l>
<l>I took a shot of cocaine and away I run

</l>
<l>Made a good run but I run too slow,

</l>
<l>they overtook me down in Juarez Mexico



</l>
<l>In the hot joint takin' the pill,

</l>
<l>there walked the sheriff from Jericho Hill

</l>
<l>Willy Lee your name is not Jack Brown,

</l>
<l>you're the dirty hack that shot your woman down

</l>
<l>Yes, so my name's is Billy Lee,

</l>
<l>if you've got a warrant you better read it to me

</l>
<l>I shot her down 'cause she made me sore,

</l>
<l>I thought I was her daddy but she had five more



</l>
<l>When I was arrested I was dressed in black,

</l>
<l>they threw me on a freight train and hauled me back

</l>
<l>Had no friend who'd go my bail,

</l>
<l>they stuck my dried-up carcass in the county jail



</l>
<l>Early next morning 'round half past nine,

</l>
<l>I saw the sheriff comin' down the line

</l>
<l>That sheriff yelled as he cleared his throat,

</l>
<l>said come on you dirty hackin' to the district court



</l>
<l>Into the courtroom my trial began,

</l>
<l>where I was judged by twelve honest men

</l>
<l>Yes, as the jury started walkin' out,

</l>
<l>I saw that little judge commence to look about

</l>
<l>In about five minutes then walked a man,

</l>
<l>holding the verdict in his right hand

</l>
<l>The verdict read in the first degree,

</l>
<l>I shouted Lordy Lordy please have mercy on me



</l>
<l>The judge he smiled when he picked up his pen,

</l>
<l>ninety-nine years in the San Quentin Penn

</l>
<l>Ninety-nine years underneath that ground,

</l>
<l>but I can't forget that day I shot that bad bitch down

</l>
<l>Come on you hotheads you listen to me,

</l>
<l>stay off that whiskey and let that cocaine be</l></lyrics></xml>
