<lyrics>



Early one morning while makin' the rounds,

I took a shot of cocaine and I shot my baby down

I shot her down then I went to bed,

I stuck that lovin' forty-four beneath my head



Woke up next morning and I grabbed that gun,

I took a shot of cocaine and away I run

Made a good run but I run too slow,

they overtook me down in Juarez Mexico



In the hot joint takin' the pill,

there walked the sheriff from Jericho Hill

Willy Lee your name is not Jack Brown,

you're the dirty hack that shot your woman down

Yes, so my name's is Billy Lee,

if you've got a warrant you better read it to me

I shot her down 'cause she made me sore,

I thought I was her daddy but she had five more



When I was arrested I was dressed in black,

they threw me on a freight train and hauled me back

Had no friend who'd go my bail,

they stuck my dried-up carcass in the county jail



Early next morning 'round half past nine,

I saw the sheriff comin' down the line

That sheriff yelled as he cleared his throat,

said come on you dirty hackin' to the district court



Into the courtroom my trial began,

where I was judged by twelve honest men

Yes, as the jury started walkin' out,

I saw that little judge commence to look about

In about five minutes then walked a man,

holding the verdict in his right hand

The verdict read in the first degree,

I shouted Lordy Lordy please have mercy on me



The judge he smiled when he picked up his pen,

ninety-nine years in the San Quentin Penn

Ninety-nine years underneath that ground,

but I can't forget that day I shot that bad bitch down

Come on you hotheads you listen to me,

stay off that whiskey and let that cocaine be
