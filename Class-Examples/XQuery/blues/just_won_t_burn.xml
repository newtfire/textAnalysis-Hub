<lyrics>



Oh I'm feeling kinda lonely

And I'm feeling kinda down

Oh but I know I'm gonna be alright

If these blues are hangin' around

Hangin' 'round

Oh, hangin' 'round

Hangin' 'round

Oh, blues hangin' 'round



Oh! I'm feelin' kinda tired

And I don't know just what to do

Oh but I know I'm gonna be alright

'Cause these blues will pull me through

Pull me through

Oh, pull me through

Oh, pull me through

Oh, they're gonna pull me through



I'm feelin' all torn up

Just don't know which way to turn

Oh I'm gonna turn my head straight to these blues

'Cause these blues they just won't burn

Just won't burn

Oh, they just won't burn

Oh, they just won't burn

Oh, they won't

Oooh, ahhh, oh, they just won't burn



They just won't,

They just won't,

They just won't,

They just won't,

They just won't burn



No they won't burn

Oh, oh, they just won't burn

Ooh, I know they won't burn, ooh lord

No, just won't burn, oh, they just



Oh, they just won't burn
