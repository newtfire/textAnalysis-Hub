<lyrics>



The sky is cryin', look at the tears roll down the street

The sky is cryin', look at the tears roll down the street

I been lookin' for my baby, yeah, an' I wonder where can she be



I saw my baby early one mornin', an' she was walkin' on down the
street

I saw my baby early one mornin', an' she was walkin' on down the
street

You know it hurt me so bad, yeah, it made my poor heart skip a
beat



I got a bad feelin', my baby don't love me no more

I got a real bad, bad feelin', my baby don't love me no more

You know the sky is cryin', yeah, the tears rollin' down my nose



Fading:

The sky is cryin', look at the tears roll down the street
