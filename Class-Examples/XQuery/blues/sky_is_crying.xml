<lyrics>


<l>The sky is cryin', look at the tears roll down the street

</l>
<l>The sky is cryin', look at the tears roll down the street

</l>
<l>I been lookin' for my baby, yeah, an' I wonder where can she be



</l>
<l>I saw my baby early one mornin', an' she was walkin' on down the
street

</l>
<l>I saw my baby early one mornin', an' she was walkin' on down the
street

</l>
<l>You know it hurt me so bad, yeah, it made my poor heart skip a

beat




</l>
<l>I got a bad feelin', my baby don't love me no more

</l>
<l>I got a real bad, bad feelin', my baby don't love me no more

</l>
<l>You know the sky is cryin', yeah, the tears rollin' down my nose



</l>
<l>Fading:
