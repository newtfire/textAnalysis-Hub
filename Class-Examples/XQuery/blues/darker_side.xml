<lyrics>





Look at the man with the smile on his face
Looks like he#146;s always feelin#146; good
Sometimes you might want to take his place,
and sometimes I think that you would

When the sun is goin#146; down,
and there is no place to hide
Even in the brightest light,
you might lean toward the darker side

Look at the people, they learn how to lie so easy
They learn how to lie to get what they need,
and after they got what they needed
It turns into a simple case of greed

When they no longer feel ashamed,
and they#146;ve lost all sense of pride
Misery loves company,
and it#146;s lonely on the darker side

And when the party is over,
and the music has died
You#146;ll be dancin#146; to the music, baby,
somewhere on the darker side

Somewhere on the darker side
