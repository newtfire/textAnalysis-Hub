<l>Somebody done changed, somebody done changed the lock on that
door

</l>
<l>Somebody done changed, they done changed the lock on that door

</l>
<l>'Cause the key I got won't fit that lock no more



</l>
<l>Now I came home last night about half past ten

</l>
<l>Tried to get the key in the lock but I couldn't get it in

</l>
<l>'Cause somebody done changed

</l>
<l>They done changed the lock on that door

</l>
<l>'Cause the key I got won't fit that lock no more

</l>
<l>I looked through the window to see what I could see

</l>
<l>She was talking to someone else

</l>
<l>I know it wasn't me

</l>
<l>She said, "daddy, daddy, daddy, daddy, you don't have to go

</l>
<l>'Cause I done changed, I done changed that lock on my door"



</l>
<l>She changed the bed around, even painted the door

</l>
<l>She even changed the carpet, I mean on the floor

</l>
<l>My baby changed

</l>
<l>Oh she done changed the lock on my door

</l>
<l>'Cause the key I got won't fit that lock no more



</l>
<l>Well, I walked down the street, lookin' where I used to go

</l>
<l>She's got a mean black snake, and I can't go there no more

</l>
<l>My baby changed

</l>
<l>She done changed the lock on my door

</l>
<l>And the key I got won't fit that lock no more</l></lyrics></xml>
