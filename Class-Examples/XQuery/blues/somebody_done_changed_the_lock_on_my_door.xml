<lyrics>



Somebody done changed, somebody done changed the lock on that
door

Somebody done changed, they done changed the lock on that door

'Cause the key I got won't fit that lock no more



Now I came home last night about half past ten

Tried to get the key in the lock but I couldn't get it in

'Cause somebody done changed

They done changed the lock on that door

'Cause the key I got won't fit that lock no more

I looked through the window to see what I could see

She was talking to someone else

I know it wasn't me

She said, "daddy, daddy, daddy, daddy, you don't have to go

'Cause I done changed, I done changed that lock on my door"



She changed the bed around, even painted the door

She even changed the carpet, I mean on the floor

My baby changed

Oh she done changed the lock on my door

'Cause the key I got won't fit that lock no more



Well, I walked down the street, lookin' where I used to go

She's got a mean black snake, and I can't go there no more

My baby changed

She done changed the lock on my door

And the key I got won't fit that lock no more
