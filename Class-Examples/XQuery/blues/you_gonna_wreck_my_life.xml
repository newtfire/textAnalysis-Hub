<lyrics>



How many more years, are you gonna wreck my life

How many more years, are you gonna wreck my life

Well the way you done, you gonna wreck my life



How many times, you gonna treat me like you do

How many more times, you gonna treat me like you do

You took all of my money, and all of my love too



Now I'm old and gray, got no place to go

Now I'm old and gray, got no place to go

You got yourself a young stud, and you can't stand me no more



I'm going to the stairs, I'm gonna beg ya for my clothes

I'm going to the stairs, I'm gonna beg ya for my clothes

For where I go nobody knows
