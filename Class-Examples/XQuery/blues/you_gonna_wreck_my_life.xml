<l>How many more years, are you gonna wreck my life

</l>
<l>How many more years, are you gonna wreck my life

</l>
<l>Well the way you done, you gonna wreck my life



</l>
<l>How many times, you gonna treat me like you do

</l>
<l>How many more times, you gonna treat me like you do

</l>
<l>You took all of my money, and all of my love too



</l>
<l>Now I'm old and gray, got no place to go

</l>
<l>Now I'm old and gray, got no place to go

</l>
<l>You got yourself a young stud, and you can't stand me no more



</l>
<l>I'm going to the stairs, I'm gonna beg ya for my clothes

</l>
<l>I'm going to the stairs, I'm gonna beg ya for my clothes

</l>
<l>For where I go nobody knows</l></lyrics></xml>
