<lyrics>


<l>The judge found me guilty, the clerk he wrote it down

</l>
<l>The judge found me guilty, the clerk he wrote it down

</l>
<l>Just a poor gal in trouble, I know I'm county road bound



</l>
<l>Many days of sorrow, many nights of woe

</l>
<l>Many days of sorrow, many nights of woe

</l>
<l>And a ball and chain everywhere I go



</l>
<l>Chains on my feet, padlock on my hand

</l>
<l>Chains on my feet, padlock on my hand

</l>
<l>It's all on account of stealing a woman's man



</l>
<l>It was early this morning that I had my trial

</l>
<l>It was early this morning that I had my trial

</l><l>Ninety days on the county road, and judge didn't even smile</l></lyrics></xml>
