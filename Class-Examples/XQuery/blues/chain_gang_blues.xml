<lyrics>



The judge found me guilty, the clerk he wrote it down

The judge found me guilty, the clerk he wrote it down

Just a poor gal in trouble, I know I'm county road bound



Many days of sorrow, many nights of woe

Many days of sorrow, many nights of woe

And a ball and chain everywhere I go



Chains on my feet, padlock on my hand

Chains on my feet, padlock on my hand

It's all on account of stealing a woman's man



It was early this morning that I had my trial

It was early this morning that I had my trial

Ninety days on the county road, and judge didn't even smile
