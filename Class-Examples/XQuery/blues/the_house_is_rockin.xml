<l>Well, the house is a rockin' don't bother knockin'

</l>
<l>Yeah, the house is a rockin' don't bother knockin'

</l>
<l>Yeah, the house is a rockin' don't bother come on in



</l>
<l>Kick off your shoes start losin' the blues

</l>
<l>This old house ain't got nothin' to lose

</l>
<l>Seen it all for years start spreadin' the news

</l>
<l>We got room on the floor come on baby shake sumpin' loose



</l>
<l>Well, the house is a rockin' don't bother knockin'

</l>
<l>Yeah, the house is a rockin' don't bother knockin'

</l>
<l>Yeah, the house is a rockin' don't bother knockin'

</l>
<l>Yeah, the house is a rockin' don't bother come on in



</l>
<l>Walkin' up the street you can hear the sound,

</l>
<l>of some bad honky tonkers really layin' it down

</l>
<l>They've seen it all for years and got nothin' to lose,

</l>
<l>so get down on the floor 
shimmy

</l>
<l>'til you shake sumpin' loose



</l>
<l>Well, the house is a rockin' don't bother knockin'

</l>
<l>Yeah, the house is a rockin' don't bother knockin'

</l>
<l>Yeah, the house is a rockin' don't bother come on in

</l>
<l>I said the house is a rockin' don't bother come on in
