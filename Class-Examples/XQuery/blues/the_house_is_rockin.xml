<lyrics>



Well, the house is a rockin' don't bother knockin'

Yeah, the house is a rockin' don't bother knockin'

Yeah, the house is a rockin' don't bother come on in



Kick off your shoes start losin' the blues

This old house ain't got nothin' to lose

Seen it all for years start spreadin' the news

We got room on the floor come on baby shake sumpin' loose



Well, the house is a rockin' don't bother knockin'

Yeah, the house is a rockin' don't bother knockin'

Yeah, the house is a rockin' don't bother come on in



Well, the house is a rockin' don't bother knockin'

Yeah, the house is a rockin' don't bother knockin'

Yeah, the house is a rockin' don't bother come on in



Walkin' up the street you can hear the sound,

of some bad honky tonkers really layin' it down

They've seen it all for years and got nothin' to lose,

so get down on the floor 
shimmy

'til you shake sumpin' loose



Well, the house is a rockin' don't bother knockin'

Yeah, the house is a rockin' don't bother knockin'

Yeah, the house is a rockin' don't bother come on in

I said the house is a rockin' don't bother come on in
