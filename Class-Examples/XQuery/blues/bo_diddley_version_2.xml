<lyrics>


<l>Bo Diddley bought his babe a diamond ring, if that diamond ring don't
shine

</l>
<l>He gonna take it to a private eye, if that private eye can't see

</l>
<l>He'd better not take the ring from me



</l>
<l>Bo Diddley caught a nanny goat, to make his pretty baby a Sunday
coat

</l>
<l>Bo Diddley caught a bear cat, to make his pretty baby a Sunday

hat





</l>
<l>Mojo
come to my house, ya </l>
<l>

black cat bone
,
take my baby away from home


</l>
<l>Ugly ole mojo, where ya bin, up your house, and gone again



</l>
<l>Bo Diddley, Bo Diddley have you heard?

</l>
<l>My pretty baby says she was a bird</l></lyrics></xml>
