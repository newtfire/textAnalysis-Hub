<lyrics>



Bo Diddley bought his babe a diamond ring, if that diamond ring don't
shine

He gonna take it to a private eye, if that private eye can't see

He'd better not take the ring from me



Bo Diddley caught a nanny goat, to make his pretty baby a Sunday
coat

Bo Diddley caught a bear cat, to make his pretty baby a Sunday
hat




Mojo
 come to my house, ya

black cat bone
,
take my baby away from home

Ugly ole mojo, where ya bin, up your house, and gone again



Bo Diddley, Bo Diddley have you heard?

My pretty baby says she was a bird
