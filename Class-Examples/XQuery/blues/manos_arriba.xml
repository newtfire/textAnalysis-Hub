<lyrics>



Ain't gonna give you no line

Just gonna take back what's mine

First we start with the soul, yeah

An' then uh, maybe your gold



(Manos arriba, sucka!)

(Manos arriba)



You watch too much t.v.

You identify me

But I'm the one who done nothin'

So stop your huffin' an' puffin'



(Manos arriba sucka!)

(Manos arriba)



I heard it come on the squawk

You watchin' me like a hawk

I ain't got nothin' to sell, yeah

So you can go straight to hell



(Manos, manos, manos, manos arriba sucka!)



You won't let me go in style

You say I fit the profile

It don't take long to discover

That I'm the one takin' over



(Manos arriba, sucka!)
