<lyrics>


<l>If your man is nice and sweet

</l>
<l>Serving you lots of young pig meat

</l>
<l>Oh yes, keep it to yourself



</l>
<l>If you know you are standing fast

</l>
<l>Got him worried where you at

</l>
<l>Oh yes, keep it to yourself



</l>
<l>He don't fall for no one

</l>
<l>He don't call for no one

</l>
<l>He don't give nobody none of his L.O.V.E.

</l>
<l>'Cause it's yours



</l>
<l>If your man is full of action

</l>
<l>Givin' you lots of satisfaction

</l>
<l>Oh yes, keep it to yourself



</l>
<l>If you gotta have a kiss and a sweet

</l>
<l>Makes me week way down in my knees

</l>
<l>Oh yes, keep it to yourself



</l>
<l>If he tries to treat you right

</l>
<l>Give him lovin' every night

</l>
<l>Oh yes, keep it to yourself



</l>
<l>He don't fall for no one

</l>
<l>He don't call for no one

</l>
<l>He don't give nobody none of his L.O.V.E.

</l>
<l>'Cause it's yours



</l>
<l>With your man you got the best go

</l>
<l>Don't broadcast it on nobody's radio!

</l><l>Oh yes, keep it to yourself</l></lyrics></xml>
