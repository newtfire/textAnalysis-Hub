<lyrics>



If your man is nice and sweet

Serving you lots of young pig meat

Oh yes, keep it to yourself



If you know you are standing fast

Got him worried where you at

Oh yes, keep it to yourself



He don't fall for no one

He don't call for no one

He don't give nobody none of his L.O.V.E.

'Cause it's yours



If your man is full of action

Givin' you lots of satisfaction

Oh yes, keep it to yourself



If you gotta have a kiss and a sweet

Makes me week way down in my knees

Oh yes, keep it to yourself



If he tries to treat you right

Give him lovin' every night

Oh yes, keep it to yourself



He don't fall for no one

He don't call for no one

He don't give nobody none of his L.O.V.E.

'Cause it's yours



With your man you got the best go

Don't broadcast it on nobody's radio!

Oh yes, keep it to yourself
