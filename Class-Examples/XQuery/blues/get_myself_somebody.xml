<lyrics>


<l>I was by myself. tryin' to get my thoughts together

</l>
<l>Tryin' to figure out me something, that would make my life a little
better

</l>
<l>So I came up with one thing and I don't think I'm wrong

</l>
<l>Ain't nothing but a fool that wanna live his life alone



</l>
<l>So I got to get myself somebody

</l>
<l>Somebody to call my own

</l>
<l>'Cause it ain't nothing but a fool want to live his life all

alone




</l>
<l>From log rollers to ditch diggers

</l>
<l>From beggars to presidents

</l>
<l>Whoah, everybody's got somebody if they got a little sense



</l>
<l>So I got to get myself somebody

</l>
<l>Somebody to call my own

</l>
<l>Ain't nothing but a fool want to live his life all alone



</l>
<l>Gettin' used to my baby's ways is the price I'm gonna pay

</l>
<l>Gonna love her everyday when she talk too much and not know what she
say

</l>
<l>Gonna hold on to you baby like a dog holds on to a bone

</l>
<l>'Cause nothing in this world want to live his life alone



</l>
<l>So I got to get myself somebody

</l>
<l>Somebody to call my own

</l>
<l>'Cause it's nothing but a fool want to live his life all alone, all

alone




</l>
<l>Well I get so lonely sometimes, so lonely

</l>
<l>Oh, I get so lonely sometimes, I'm all alone

</l>
<l>I'm all alone</l></lyrics></xml>
