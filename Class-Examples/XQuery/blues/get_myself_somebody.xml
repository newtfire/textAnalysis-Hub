<lyrics>



I was by myself. tryin' to get my thoughts together

Tryin' to figure out me something, that would make my life a little
better

So I came up with one thing and I don't think I'm wrong

Ain't nothing but a fool that wanna live his life alone



So I got to get myself somebody

Somebody to call my own

'Cause it ain't nothing but a fool want to live his life all
alone



From log rollers to ditch diggers

From beggars to presidents

Whoah, everybody's got somebody if they got a little sense



So I got to get myself somebody

Somebody to call my own

Ain't nothing but a fool want to live his life all alone



Gettin' used to my baby's ways is the price I'm gonna pay

Gonna love her everyday when she talk too much and not know what she
say

Gonna hold on to you baby like a dog holds on to a bone

'Cause nothing in this world want to live his life alone



So I got to get myself somebody

Somebody to call my own

'Cause it's nothing but a fool want to live his life all alone, all
alone



Well I get so lonely sometimes, so lonely

Oh, I get so lonely sometimes, I'm all alone

I'm all alone
