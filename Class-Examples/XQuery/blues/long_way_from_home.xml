<lyrics>


<l>Look over here, look over there

</l>
<l>Look all around me everywhere

</l>
<l>Well it doesn't really matter,

</l>
<l>which way I wanna go

</l>
<l>'Cause the night is a fallin',

</l>
<l>and I'm a long long way from home

</l>
<l>I am a long long way from home, yes I am



</l>
<l>Listen to this, listen to that,

</l>
<l>people tryin' to tell me

</l>
<l>Where it's at,

</l>
<l>but it really doesn't matter

</l>
<l>I hear it all the time,

</l>
<l>and I'm standing at the crossroads

</l>
<l>'Bout to move on down the line,

</l>
<l>about to move on down the line



</l>
<l>Well I've been over here, been over there

</l>
<l>Friends all around me everywhere,

</l>
<l>but it really doesn't matter

</l>
<l>Which way I wanna go,

</l>
<l>I'm a million miles from nowhere

</l>
<l>And that's a long long way from home

</l>
<l>And that's a long long way from home



</l>
<l>Yeah a million miles from nowhere

</l>
<l>And that's a long long way from home

</l>
<l>And that's a long long way from home</l></lyrics></xml>
