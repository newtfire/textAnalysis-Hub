<lyrics>



Hey, fellas, yes, you, fellas, listen to me, I got something to tell
you

And I want you to listen to every word and govern yourselves
accordingly



Now, you see these girls with these fine diamonds, fine furs and fine
clothes

Well, they're looking for a husband and you're listening to a man who
knows

They ain't foolin', and if you fool around with them

You're gonna get yourself in a schoolin'



Listen, if she saves you dough, and won't go to the show

Beware

If she's easy to kiss and won't resist

Beware



And if you go for a walk, and she listens while you talk

She's tryin' to hook you



And nobody's lookin' and she asks you to taste her cookin'

Don't do it, don't do it

And if you go to a show and she wants to sit in the back row

Bring her down front, bring her right down front



If you wanna go for a snack, and she wants to sit in the booth in the
back

Beware



And listen, if she's used to caviar and fine silk

When you go out with her she wanna a hot dog and a malted milk

She's trying to get you



If you're used to goin' to Carnegie Hall, but when you take her out
night club'ing

All she wants is one meatball

You better take it easy



If she grabs your hand and says, "Darling, you're such a nice
man"

Beware, I'm telling you



(Should I tell them no more?)

(Tell them everything)



You better listen to me 'cause I'm telling you what's being put
down

You better pick up on it



If her sister calls your brother, you better get further

I'm telling you, you better watch it



And if she's acting kind of wild, and she says, "Darling, give me a
trial"

Don't you do it, don't be weak, don't give it to her

And if she smiles in your face and just melts into place

Let her melt, forget it, let her melt



(Should I tell them no more?)

(Tell them everything)



Now listen, if she calls you up on the phone, and says,

"Darling, are you all alone?"

Tell her, "No, no, I've got two, three women with me"



Don't pay no attention to women

Stand up for your right, be a man, be a man



(Are you listening?)

If you turn out the lights and she don't fight

That's the end, it's too late

She's got you hooked, you might as well stick with her



(Should I tell them no more?)



If you get home about two and don't know what to do

You pull back the curtains, and the whole family's looking at you

Get your business straight

Set the date, don't be late



Brother, beware, beware, beware

Brother, you better beware
