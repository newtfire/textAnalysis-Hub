<lyrics>


<l>Hey, fellas, yes, you, fellas, listen to me, I got something to tell
you

</l>
<l>And I want you to listen to every word and govern yourselves

accordingly




</l>
<l>Now, you see these girls with these fine diamonds, fine furs and fine
clothes

</l>
<l>Well, they're looking for a husband and you're listening to a man who
knows

</l>
<l>They ain't foolin', and if you fool around with them

</l>
<l>You're gonna get yourself in a schoolin'



</l>
<l>Listen, if she saves you dough, and won't go to the show

</l>
<l>Beware

</l>
<l>If she's easy to kiss and won't resist

</l>
<l>Beware



</l>
<l>And if you go for a walk, and she listens while you talk

</l>
<l>She's tryin' to hook you



</l>
<l>And nobody's lookin' and she asks you to taste her cookin'

</l>
<l>Don't do it, don't do it

</l>
<l>And if you go to a show and she wants to sit in the back row

</l>
<l>Bring her down front, bring her right down front



</l>
<l>If you wanna go for a snack, and she wants to sit in the booth in the
back

</l>
<l>Beware



</l>
<l>And listen, if she's used to caviar and fine silk

</l>
<l>When you go out with her she wanna a hot dog and a malted milk

</l>
<l>She's trying to get you



</l>
<l>If you're used to goin' to Carnegie Hall, but when you take her out
night club'ing

</l>
<l>All she wants is one meatball

</l>
<l>You better take it easy



</l>
<l>If she grabs your hand and says, "Darling, you're such a nice
man"

</l>
<l>Beware, I'm telling you



</l>
<l>(Should I tell them no more?)

</l>
<l>(Tell them everything)



</l>
<l>You better listen to me 'cause I'm telling you what's being put
down

</l>
<l>You better pick up on it



</l>
<l>If her sister calls your brother, you better get further

</l>
<l>I'm telling you, you better watch it



</l>
<l>And if she's acting kind of wild, and she says, "Darling, give me a
trial"

</l>
<l>Don't you do it, don't be weak, don't give it to her

</l>
<l>And if she smiles in your face and just melts into place

</l>
<l>Let her melt, forget it, let her melt



</l>
<l>(Should I tell them no more?)

</l>
<l>(Tell them everything)



</l>
<l>Now listen, if she calls you up on the phone, and says,

</l>
<l>"Darling, are you all alone?"

</l>
<l>Tell her, "No, no, I've got two, three women with me"



</l>
<l>Don't pay no attention to women

</l>
<l>Stand up for your right, be a man, be a man



</l>
<l>(Are you listening?)

</l>
<l>If you turn out the lights and she don't fight

</l>
<l>That's the end, it's too late

</l>
<l>She's got you hooked, you might as well stick with her



</l>
<l>(Should I tell them no more?)



</l>
<l>If you get home about two and don't know what to do

</l>
<l>You pull back the curtains, and the whole family's looking at you

</l>
<l>Get your business straight

</l>
<l>Set the date, don't be late



</l>
<l>Brother, beware, beware, beware

</l>
<l>Brother, you better beware</l></lyrics></xml>
