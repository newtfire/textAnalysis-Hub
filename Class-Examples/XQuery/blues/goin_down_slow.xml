<l>(spoken:

</l>
<l>Alright, alright.

</l>
<l>Thank you so much ladies and gentlemen right here,

</l>
<l>right here I want to tell you a little story.

</l>
<l>This is about a country boy from down home.

</l>
<l>This young man has never been north before.

</l>
<l>I want you to listen to me, I got something to tell you.



</l>
<l>He heard about Chicago.

</l>
<l>He worked hard over here, made all of that money, 800 dollars.

</l>
<l>After caring for his crop, he called his cousin in Chicago,

</l>
<l>and he said, "Cousin, I'm on my way".

</l>
<l>He picked all of that cotton.

</l>
<l>I said this is about a country boy like myself, B.B. King you
know.

</l>
<l>So when he get to Chicago, his cousin meet him and bring him out to
the club.

</l>
<l>He said, "Set him up!", cous's payin' for.

</l>
<l>Had all the go-go girls set up, waitin' up.

</l>
<l>They carried him downtown and put him up in one of the pleasure
hotels.

</l>
<l>They brought him back out and said, "Set him up!", cous's payin'
for.

</l>
<l>His money got a little lighter, they lured him out from the Lute and
brought him down to Robert's.

</l>
<l>And then he said, "Set him up!", cous's payin' for.

</l>
<l>And then the 800 dollars, bein' more money then my man had ever had,
began to run out.

</l>
<l>Then they moved him out and put him down with the ...

</l>
<l>And then, ladies and gentlemen, the go-go girls would get fewer.

</l>
<l>His friends was fewer.

</l>
<l>All his buddies are startin' passin' him on the other side of the
street.

</l>
<l>And then it happened all his buddies were gone.

</l>
<l>And my man knew only one thing to do, it was getting cold there, like
it is today,

</l>
<l>you know what I'm talking about.

</l>
<l>He went down to the railroad yard,

</l>
<l>and one of the few ladies that had helped him to spent his money,
came by to see him.

</l>
<l>And she said "You fool!, you fool!", I wouldn't have spend your
money, but the rest of them was spending your money so I decided to
spend my portion too, you know.

</l>
<l>But ladies, God bless 'em, wonderful something's aren't they?.

</l>
<l>They always like to feel like they're needed, and she knew my man
needed her bad.

</l>
<l>He gotten sick, he's layin' down there under the boxcar.

</l>
<l>Couldn't read so well, so you know if he couldn't read so well, he
couldn't write too well,

</l>
<l>you know what I'm talkin' about?

</l>
<l>So this is a letter back down home, I know what I'm talkin'
about.

</l>
<l>It go like this:)



</l>
<l>I've had my fun, whoah, if I don't get well no more

</l>
<l>Whoah, I've had my fun, people, ooh, if I don't get well no more

</l>
<l>Yes, my health is faillin' on me now, people

</l>
<l>Ooh, and I'm goin', goin' down slow



</l>
<l>Yes, tell my mother, people, please tell her the shape I'm in

</l>
<l>Ooh yes, tell my people, mother, tell her the shape I'm in

</l>
<l>Tell her to pray for me, people, ooh, to forgive, people, my sins



</l>
<l>Oohooh mother, mother I live alone with my prayers

</l>
<l>Ooh, tell my mother, people, tell her this is all in prayers

</l>
<l>Yes, if you don't see this old body, mother

</l>
<l>Hey, you know I'm out in the world somewhere</l></lyrics></xml>
