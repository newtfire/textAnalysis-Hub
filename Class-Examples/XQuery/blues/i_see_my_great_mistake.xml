<lyrics>



I've got somethin' to tell you baby, don't let it break your
heart

So long together, now we've got to part,

because I'm tired, of findin' frogs for snakes

After these long many years, babe I just see my great mistake



You told me that you loved me, said you loved me all your life

I caught you 'round the corner, tellin' that same lie twice

You know I'm tired, of findin' frogs for snakes

After these long many years, babe I just see my great mistake



Once I used to love you, I couldn't help myself

Found out you'd given your love baby, to somebody else

You know I'm tired, of findin' frogs for snakes

After these long many years, babe I just see my great mistake



Ain't gonna be your dog no more, little girl!



Because now I see my great mistake



Now listen little girl, you don't worry my mind any mo'

Find out you're actin' funny, I'm sure gonna let you go

Because I'm tired, of findin' frogs for snakes

After these long many years, I just see my great mistake
