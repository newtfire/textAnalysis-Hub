<lyrics>


<l>I've got somethin' to tell you baby, don't let it break your
heart

</l>
<l>So long together, now we've got to part,

</l>
<l>because I'm tired, of findin' frogs for snakes

</l>
<l>After these long many years, babe I just see my great mistake



</l>
<l>You told me that you loved me, said you loved me all your life

</l>
<l>I caught you 'round the corner, tellin' that same lie twice

</l>
<l>You know I'm tired, of findin' frogs for snakes

</l>
<l>After these long many years, babe I just see my great mistake



</l>
<l>Once I used to love you, I couldn't help myself

</l>
<l>Found out you'd given your love baby, to somebody else

</l>
<l>You know I'm tired, of findin' frogs for snakes

</l>
<l>After these long many years, babe I just see my great mistake



</l>
<l>Ain't gonna be your dog no more, little girl!



</l>
<l>Because now I see my great mistake



</l>
<l>Now listen little girl, you don't worry my mind any mo'

</l>
<l>Find out you're actin' funny, I'm sure gonna let you go

</l>
<l>Because I'm tired, of findin' frogs for snakes

</l>
<l>After these long many years, I just see my great mistake</l></lyrics></xml>
