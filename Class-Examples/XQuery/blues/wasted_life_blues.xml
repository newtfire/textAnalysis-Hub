<lyrics>



I've lived a life but nothin' I've gained

Each day I'm full of sorrow and pain

No one seems to care enough for poor me,

to give me a word of sympathy

Oh, me! Oh, me! Wonder what will become of poor me?



No father to guide me, no mother to care

Must bear my troubles alone

Not even a brother to help me share

This burden I must bear alone

Oh, me! Oh, me! Wonder what will become of poor me?



I'm settin' and thinkin' of the days gone by

They filled my heart with pain

I'm too weak to stand and too strong to cry

But I'm forgittin' it all in vain

Oh, me! Oh, me! Wonder what will become of poor me?



I've traveled and wandered almost everywhere

To git a little joy from life

Still I've gained nothin' but wars and despairs

Still strugglin' in this world of strife

Oh, me! Oh, me! Wonder what will become of poor me?
