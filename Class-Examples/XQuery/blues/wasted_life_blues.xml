<lyrics>


<l>I've lived a life but nothin' I've gained

</l>
<l>Each day I'm full of sorrow and pain

</l>
<l>No one seems to care enough for poor me,

</l>
<l>to give me a word of sympathy

</l>
<l>Oh, me! Oh, me! Wonder what will become of poor me?



</l>
<l>No father to guide me, no mother to care

</l>
<l>Must bear my troubles alone

</l>
<l>Not even a brother to help me share

</l>
<l>This burden I must bear alone

</l>
<l>Oh, me! Oh, me! Wonder what will become of poor me?



</l>
<l>I'm settin' and thinkin' of the days gone by

</l>
<l>They filled my heart with pain

</l>
<l>I'm too weak to stand and too strong to cry

</l>
<l>But I'm forgittin' it all in vain

</l>
<l>Oh, me! Oh, me! Wonder what will become of poor me?



</l>
<l>I've traveled and wandered almost everywhere

</l>
<l>To git a little joy from life

</l>
<l>Still I've gained nothin' but wars and despairs

</l>
<l>Still strugglin' in this world of strife

</l><l>Oh, me! Oh, me! Wonder what will become of poor me?</l></lyrics></xml>
