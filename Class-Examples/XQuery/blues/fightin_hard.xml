<lyrics>



If I could stroll 'cross the sands of time

I'd call my cronies up an' drink some wine

'Cause just the other day I heard you died

Disappeared when you was in your prime

An' I'm fightin' hard



Stompin' 'round on my grandma land

I held my little son in my hand

I know he knowed that I understand

He tryin' hard just to be a man, yeah

An' he's fightin' hard



I told him folks don't have a clue

Where you're from or where you're goin' to

An' sometime baby, gets so hard to deal

With folks that believe wrestlin' is real

An' we fightin' hard



If I could stroll 'cross the sands of time

I'd call my cronies up and drink some wine

'Cause all we got's just a little time

'Fore we all gotta say goodbye

An' I'm fightin' hard



An' I'm fightin' hard
