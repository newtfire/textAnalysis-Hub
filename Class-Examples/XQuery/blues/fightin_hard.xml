<lyrics>


<l>If I could stroll 'cross the sands of time

</l>
<l>I'd call my cronies up an' drink some wine

</l>
<l>'Cause just the other day I heard you died

</l>
<l>Disappeared when you was in your prime

</l>
<l>An' I'm fightin' hard



</l>
<l>Stompin' 'round on my grandma land

</l>
<l>I held my little son in my hand

</l>
<l>I know he knowed that I understand

</l>
<l>He tryin' hard just to be a man, yeah

</l>
<l>An' he's fightin' hard



</l>
<l>I told him folks don't have a clue

</l>
<l>Where you're from or where you're goin' to

</l>
<l>An' sometime baby, gets so hard to deal

</l>
<l>With folks that believe wrestlin' is real

</l>
<l>An' we fightin' hard



</l>
<l>If I could stroll 'cross the sands of time

</l>
<l>I'd call my cronies up and drink some wine

</l>
<l>'Cause all we got's just a little time

</l>
<l>'Fore we all gotta say goodbye

</l>
<l>An' I'm fightin' hard



</l>
<l>An' I'm fightin' hard</l></lyrics></xml>
