<lyrics>



If you don't bend you'll have to break

It's good advise but a little too late

Nothin' but trouble everywhere I go, yeah

What I've been through you never know

Got me down on my bendin' knee

Weepin' and bendin' like a willow tree



I'm not lyin' it's not a fake

You can tell by the look on my face

Just so much a man can take

Sooner or later he's gotta break

Yes, I'm down on my bendin' knee

Weeping an' bendin' like a willow tree



Like a bitter pill that ya have to take

I'm beggin' you baby, you say it's too late

For goodness sakes please give me a break

Just a little more that I can take

Got me down on my bendin' knee

Weepin' and bendin' like a willow tree
