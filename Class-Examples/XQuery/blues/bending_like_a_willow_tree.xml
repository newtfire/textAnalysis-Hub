<lyrics>


<l>If you don't bend you'll have to break

</l>
<l>It's good advise but a little too late

</l>
<l>Nothin' but trouble everywhere I go, yeah

</l>
<l>What I've been through you never know

</l>
<l>Got me down on my bendin' knee

</l>
<l>Weepin' and bendin' like a willow tree



</l>
<l>I'm not lyin' it's not a fake

</l>
<l>You can tell by the look on my face

</l>
<l>Just so much a man can take

</l>
<l>Sooner or later he's gotta break

</l>
<l>Yes, I'm down on my bendin' knee

</l>
<l>Weeping an' bendin' like a willow tree



</l>
<l>Like a bitter pill that ya have to take

</l>
<l>I'm beggin' you baby, you say it's too late

</l>
<l>For goodness sakes please give me a break

</l>
<l>Just a little more that I can take

</l>
<l>Got me down on my bendin' knee

</l>
<l>Weepin' and bendin' like a willow tree</l></lyrics></xml>
