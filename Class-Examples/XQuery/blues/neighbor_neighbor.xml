<lyrics>



Neighbor, neighbor, why you messin' in my life?

Neighbor, neighbor, you've been talkin' to my wife

Tellin' her you seen me, runnin' wild the other night, runnin' wild
the other night



A neighbor, neighbor, there's always one in every crowd

A neighbor, neighbor, tellin' lies and talkin' loud

You better watch your step now, you might fall off your cloud, you
might fall off your cloud



Now I was walking down a dusty road when along came a neighbor of
mine

He saw me walkin' with my head hung down, he just had to stop and
pass the time

Neighbor, neighbor, floatin' in the salty brine
1
, floatin'
in the salty brine



__________

Note 1: brine,
