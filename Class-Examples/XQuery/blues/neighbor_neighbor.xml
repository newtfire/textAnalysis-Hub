<lyrics>

<l>Neighbor, neighbor, why you messin' in my life?

</l>
<l>Neighbor, neighbor, you've been talkin' to my wife

</l>
<l>Tellin' her you seen me, runnin' wild the other night, runnin' wild
the other night



</l>
<l>A neighbor, neighbor, there's always one in every crowd

</l>
<l>A neighbor, neighbor, tellin' lies and talkin' loud

</l>
<l>You better watch your step now, you might fall off your cloud, you
might fall off your cloud



</l>
<l>Now I was walking down a dusty road when along came a neighbor of
mine

</l>
<l>He saw me walkin' with my head hung down, he just had to stop and
pass the time

</l>
<l>Neighbor, neighbor, floatin' in the salty brine
1
, floatin'
in the salty brine



</l>
