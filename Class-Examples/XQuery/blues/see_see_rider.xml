And it's hey, hey hey, she was standin' in the kitchen, honey, in her
morning gown

Lord, she was standin' in the kitchen, babe, in her morning gown

She was standin' in the kitchen, honey, in her morning gown



But I say hey hey, hey hey, Lord, see see rider, see what you done

Lord, now, see see rider, honey, see what you have done

Well, see see rider, see what you done done



Well hey, hey hey hey, hey hey



Well, the blues ain't nothin' but a good man feelin' bad

Lord, the blues ain't nothin' but a good man feelin' bad
