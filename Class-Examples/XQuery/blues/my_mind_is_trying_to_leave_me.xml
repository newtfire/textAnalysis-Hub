<lyrics>



I went to breakfast this mo'nin, down to the corner bar

I thought I heard my baby call my name, an' it came from so far

I started runnin' an' answerin', like a crazy fool would do

Aha, ya' see, my woman gone away an' left me

An' now my mind is tryin' to leave me too



Now my friend stepped out the bar

An' stopped me an' offered me a drink

I went in an' had a double

An' I began to think about my baby

Aha, like a crazy fool would do

You see, my woman gone away an' left me

An' now my mind is tryin' to leave me too



Oh!



Ha-ah, I went into the barber shop an' ordered ham an' eggs

An' each barber gave me fifty cent

They thought I was tryin' to beg

An' I started cryin' like a baby (like a baby, ha)

Like any fool would do

You see my woman gone away an' left me

An' now my mind is tryin' to leave me too
