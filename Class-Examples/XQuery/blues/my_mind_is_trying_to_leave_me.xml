<lyrics>


<l>I went to breakfast this mo'nin, down to the corner bar

</l>
<l>I thought I heard my baby call my name, an' it came from so far

</l>
<l>I started runnin' an' answerin', like a crazy fool would do

</l>
<l>Aha, ya' see, my woman gone away an' left me

</l>
<l>An' now my mind is tryin' to leave me too



</l>
<l>Now my friend stepped out the bar

</l>
<l>An' stopped me an' offered me a drink

</l>
<l>I went in an' had a double

</l>
<l>An' I began to think about my baby

</l>
<l>Aha, like a crazy fool would do

</l>
<l>You see, my woman gone away an' left me

</l>
<l>An' now my mind is tryin' to leave me too



</l>
<l>Oh!



</l>
<l>Ha-ah, I went into the barber shop an' ordered ham an' eggs

</l>
<l>An' each barber gave me fifty cent

</l>
<l>They thought I was tryin' to beg

</l>
<l>An' I started cryin' like a baby (like a baby, ha)

</l>
<l>Like any fool would do

</l>
<l>You see my woman gone away an' left me

</l>
<l>An' now my mind is tryin' to leave me too</l></lyrics></xml>
