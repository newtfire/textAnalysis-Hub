<lyrics>


<l>I've got a lovesick tale to tell to you

</l>
<l>Though it ain't no affair of mine

</l>
<l>It's 'bout a gal named Sue and a boy named Lou

</l>
<l>They were fighting all the time

</l>
<l>Sue came home one afternoon

</l>
<l>And found an empty dining room

</l>
<l>Without a word her turtledove had flown

</l>
<l>She began to moan



</l>
<l>My sweetie went away but he didn't say where

</l>
<l>He didn't say when, he didn't say why

</l>
<l>Oh, bid me goodbye

</l>
<l>I'm blue as I can be

</l>
<l>I know he loved another one but he didn't say who

</l>
<l>He didn't say when, he didn't say what

</l>
<l>His mama has got

</l>
<l>That took my sweetie from me

</l>
<l>I'm like a little lost sheep

</l>
<l>And I can't sleep

</l>
<l>But I keep trying to forget

</l>
<l>My trifling papa has left his mama all alone, I groan

</l>
<l>My sweetie went away but he didn't say where

</l>
<l>He didn't say when, he didn't say why

</l>
<l>I know I'll die

</l>
<l>Why don't he hurry home</l></lyrics></xml>
