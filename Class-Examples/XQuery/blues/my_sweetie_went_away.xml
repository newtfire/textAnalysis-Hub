<lyrics>



I've got a lovesick tale to tell to you

Though it ain't no affair of mine

It's 'bout a gal named Sue and a boy named Lou

They were fighting all the time

Sue came home one afternoon

And found an empty dining room

Without a word her turtledove had flown

She began to moan



My sweetie went away but he didn't say where

He didn't say when, he didn't say why

Oh, bid me goodbye

I'm blue as I can be

I know he loved another one but he didn't say who

He didn't say when, he didn't say what

His mama has got

That took my sweetie from me

I'm like a little lost sheep

And I can't sleep

But I keep trying to forget

My trifling papa has left his mama all alone, I groan

My sweetie went away but he didn't say where

He didn't say when, he didn't say why

I know I'll die

Why don't he hurry home
