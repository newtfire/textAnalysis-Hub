<lyrics>



Hmm, how long, how long, baby must I live on babe and be your
slave?

Hmm, how long, how long, must I live on and be your slave?

Yes, I bring home my paycheck, baby, and you throws it all away



I'm gonna git me a woman to help me reach my goal, yes, yes

I'm gonna find me a woman just to help me reach my goal, hm, mm, mm,
mm, mm

'Cause you don't do nothin', baby, but throw my money away
