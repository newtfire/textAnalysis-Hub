<l>Yes, be careful with a fool, 'cause someday he may get smart

</l>
<l>Yes, be careful with a fool, 'cause someday he may get smart

</l>
<l>Yes, he'll treat you so cold and chilly, it will hurt you to your

hurt




</l>
<l>I hate to remember how foolish I used to be

</l>
<l>I hate to remember how foolish I used to be

</l>
<l>Well, you know the way I used to love you, baby, and how bad you

treated me




</l>
<l>I used to cry about you baby and walk the streets late at night

</l>
<l>I used to cry about you baby and walk the streets late at night

</l>
<l>Yes, if you love me a little bit, baby, why don't you treat me half

way right?




</l>
<l>It's finally over, baby, babe, I know this is the end

</l>
<l>It's finally over, baby, babe, I know this is the end

</l>
<l>I've got you off of my mind, woman and I've started over again</l></lyrics></xml>
