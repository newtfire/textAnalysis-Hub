<lyrics>



Yes, be careful with a fool, 'cause someday he may get smart

Yes, be careful with a fool, 'cause someday he may get smart

Yes, he'll treat you so cold and chilly, it will hurt you to your
hurt



I hate to remember how foolish I used to be

I hate to remember how foolish I used to be

Well, you know the way I used to love you, baby, and how bad you
treated me



I used to cry about you baby and walk the streets late at night

I used to cry about you baby and walk the streets late at night

Yes, if you love me a little bit, baby, why don't you treat me half
way right?



It's finally over, baby, babe, I know this is the end

It's finally over, baby, babe, I know this is the end

I've got you off of my mind, woman and I've started over again
