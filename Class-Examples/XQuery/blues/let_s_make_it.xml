<l>Let's make it, let's make it baby

</l>
<l>Let's make it, oh right now, oh yeah

</l>
<l>Let's make it, oh baby, me and you



</l>
<l>I don't care, what the world may say

</l>
<l>Let's make it, let's make it

</l>
<l>Let's make it, oh babe, oho

</l>
<l>Oh yeah, not your mother, or you,

</l>
<l>not your sister, or me and you

</l>
<l>Let's make it, right now

</l>
<l>Let's get it, while gettin' it, it's good, ooh



</l>
<l>Let's make it, let's make it baby

</l>
<l>We ain't sayin' nothin', we ain't sayin' a thing

</l>
<l>Let's make it, me and you

</l>
<l>Let's make it, let's make it, let's make it</l></lyrics></xml>
