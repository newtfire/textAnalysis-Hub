<lyrics>



Let's make it, let's make it baby

Let's make it, oh right now, oh yeah

Let's make it, oh baby, me and you



I don't care, what the world may say

Let's make it, let's make it

Let's make it, oh babe, oho

Oh yeah, not your mother, or you,

not your sister, or me and you

Let's make it, right now

Let's get it, while gettin' it, it's good, ooh



Let's make it, let's make it baby

We ain't sayin' nothin', we ain't sayin' a thing

Let's make it, me and you

Let's make it, let's make it, let's make it
