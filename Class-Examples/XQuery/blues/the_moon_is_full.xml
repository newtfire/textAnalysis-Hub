<l>I said the moon is full, I feel my love comin' down

</l>
<l>I said the moon is full, I feel my love comin' down

</l>
<l>You see I met this little girl, I don't think I'm gonna wanna, wanna,

leave this town




</l>
<l>All my friends call me crazy, you just don't know how I feel
inside

</l>
<l>All my friends call me crazy, you just don't know how I feel
inside

</l>
<l>You know I love this little girl, 'cause she's got the little pretty,

pretty brown eyes




</l>
<l>Gonna take that train in the mornin', I think I'm gonna go back
home

</l>
<l>Gonna catch that train in the mornin' ya'all, I think I'm gonna go
back home

</l>
<l>And I know that my little girl know, oh that I won't be gone, I won't

be gone 'till dawn




</l>
<l>If I miss that train, I think I'm gonna to have to hitch-hike

</l>
<l>If I miss that train in the mornin' ya'all, I guess I'm gonna have to
hitch-hike

</l><l>And I'll let my little girl know, I'll just be gone, I'll be gone</l>
<l>overnight</l></lyrics></xml>
