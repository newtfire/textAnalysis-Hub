<lyrics>



I said the moon is full, I feel my love comin' down

I said the moon is full, I feel my love comin' down

You see I met this little girl, I don't think I'm gonna wanna, wanna,
leave this town



All my friends call me crazy, you just don't know how I feel
inside

All my friends call me crazy, you just don't know how I feel
inside

You know I love this little girl, 'cause she's got the little pretty,
pretty brown eyes



Gonna take that train in the mornin', I think I'm gonna go back
home

Gonna catch that train in the mornin' ya'all, I think I'm gonna go
back home

And I know that my little girl know, oh that I won't be gone, I won't
be gone 'till dawn



If I miss that train, I think I'm gonna to have to hitch-hike

If I miss that train in the mornin' ya'all, I guess I'm gonna have to
hitch-hike

And I'll let my little girl know, I'll just be gone, I'll be gone
overnight
