<l>(Spoken: Douse that light...)



</l>
<l>Now I just got back from baby's, we been rollin' all night long

</l>
<l>I said I just got back from baby's, we been rollin' all night
long

</l>
<l>She come on likes and loves me, but I feel like somethin' wrong



</l>
<l>Now, sometimes I go see baby, and sometimes she come see me

</l>
<l>I said, sometimes I go see baby, and sometimes baby come see me

</l>
<l>I got a funny, funny feelin', I'm not the only man she sees



</l>
<l>Now, I just got back from baby's, big white house on the hill

</l>
<l>I said, I just got back from baby's, big white house on the hill

</l>
<l>If her lovin' don't get me, I know her husband will</l></lyrics></xml>
