(Spoken: Douse that light...)



Now I just got back from baby's, we been rollin' all night long

I said I just got back from baby's, we been rollin' all night
long

She come on likes and loves me, but I feel like somethin' wrong



Now, sometimes I go see baby, and sometimes she come see me

I said, sometimes I go see baby, and sometimes baby come see me

I got a funny, funny feelin', I'm not the only man she sees



Now, I just got back from baby's, big white house on the hill

I said, I just got back from baby's, big white house on the hill

If her lovin' don't get me, I know her husband will
