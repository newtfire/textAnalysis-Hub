<lyrics>


<l>All you girls think the days are gone

</l>
<l>You don't have to worry, you can have your fun

</l>
<l>Take me, baby, for your little boy

</l>
<l>Three hundred pounds of heavenly joy

</l>
<l>This is it

</l>
<l>This is it

</l>
<l>Look what you get



</l>
<l>You been creeping and hiding behind his back

</l>
<l>'Cause you got you a man that you don't like

</l>
<l>Throw that Jack, baby, outta your mind

</l>
<l>Follow me, baby, have a real good time

</l>
<l>This is it

</l>
<l>This is it

</l>
<l>Look what you get



</l>
<l>Hoy! Hoy! I'm the boy

</l>
<l>Three hundred pounds of heavenly joy

</l>
<l>I'm so glad that you understand

</l>
<l>Three hundred pounds of muscle and man

</l>
<l>This is it

</l>
<l>This is it

</l>
<l>Look what you get



</l>
<l>If the men's all mad then the women's glad

</l>
<l>If the little kids' happy then the old folk's mad

</l>
<l>I'm so glad that you understand

</l>
<l>Three hundred pounds of muscle and man

</l>
<l>This is it

</l>
<l>This is it

</l>
<l>Look what you get
