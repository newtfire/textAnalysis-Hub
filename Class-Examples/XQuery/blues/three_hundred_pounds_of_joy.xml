<lyrics>



All you girls think the days are gone

You don't have to worry, you can have your fun

Take me, baby, for your little boy

Three hundred pounds of heavenly joy

This is it

This is it

Look what you get



You been creeping and hiding behind his back

'Cause you got you a man that you don't like

Throw that Jack, baby, outta your mind

Follow me, baby, have a real good time

This is it

This is it

Look what you get



Hoy! Hoy! I'm the boy

Three hundred pounds of heavenly joy

I'm so glad that you understand

Three hundred pounds of muscle and man

This is it

This is it

Look what you get



If the men's all mad then the women's glad

If the little kids' happy then the old folk's mad

I'm so glad that you understand

Three hundred pounds of muscle and man

This is it

This is it

Look what you get
