<lyrics>



On the day I was born, the nurses all gathered 'round

And they gazed in wide wonder, at the joy they had found

The head nurse spoke up, and she said leave this one alone

She could tell right away, that I was bad to the bone

Bad to the bone

Bad to the bone

B-B-B-B-Bad to the bone

B-B-B-B-Bad

B-B-B-B-Bad

Bad to the bone



I broke a thousand hearts, before I met you

I'll break a thousand more baby, before I am through

I wanna be yours pretty baby, yours and yours alone

I'm here to tell ya honey, that I'm bad to the bone

Bad to the bone

B-B-B-Bad

B-B-B-Bad

B-B-B-Bad

Bad to the bone



I make a rich woman beg, I'll make a good woman steal

I'll make an old woman blush, and make a young woman squeal

I wanna be yours pretty baby, yours and yours alone

I'm here to tell ya honey, that I'm bad to the bone

B-B-B-B-Bad

B-B-B-B-Bad

B-B-B-B-Bad

Bad to the bone
