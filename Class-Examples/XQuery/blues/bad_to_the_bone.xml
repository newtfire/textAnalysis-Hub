<lyrics>


<l>On the day I was born, the nurses all gathered 'round

</l>
<l>And they gazed in wide wonder, at the joy they had found

</l>
<l>The head nurse spoke up, and she said leave this one alone

</l>
<l>She could tell right away, that I was bad to the bone

</l>
<l>Bad to the bone

</l>
<l>Bad to the bone

</l>
<l>B-B-B-B-Bad to the bone

</l>
<l>B-B-B-B-Bad

</l>
<l>B-B-B-B-Bad

</l>
<l>Bad to the bone



</l>
<l>I broke a thousand hearts, before I met you

</l>
<l>I'll break a thousand more baby, before I am through

</l>
<l>I wanna be yours pretty baby, yours and yours alone

</l>
<l>I'm here to tell ya honey, that I'm bad to the bone

</l>
<l>Bad to the bone

</l>
<l>B-B-B-Bad

</l>
<l>B-B-B-Bad

</l>
<l>B-B-B-Bad

</l>
<l>Bad to the bone



</l>
<l>I make a rich woman beg, I'll make a good woman steal

</l>
<l>I'll make an old woman blush, and make a young woman squeal

</l>
<l>I wanna be yours pretty baby, yours and yours alone

</l>
<l>I'm here to tell ya honey, that I'm bad to the bone

</l>
<l>B-B-B-B-Bad

</l>
<l>B-B-B-B-Bad

</l>
<l>B-B-B-B-Bad

</l>
<l>Bad to the bone</l></lyrics></xml>
