<lyrics>



There ain't nothing I can do, or nothing I can say

That folks don't criticize me

But I'm goin' to, do just as I want to anyway

And don't care if they all despise me



If I should take a notion

To jump into the ocean

'T ain't nobody's bizness if I do, do, do do



If I go to church on Sunday

Then just 
shimmy
 down on
Monday

Ain't nobody's bizness if I do, if I do



If my friend ain't got no money

And I say "Take all mine, honey"

'T ain't nobody's bizness if I do, do, do do



If I give him my last nickel

And it leaves me in a pickle

'T ain't nobody's bizness if I do, if I do



Well I'd rather my man would hit me,

than to jump right up and quit me

'T ain't nobody's bizness if I do, do, do do



I swear I won't call no copper

If I'm beat up by my papa

'T ain't nobody's bizness if I do, if I do
