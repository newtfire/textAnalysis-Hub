<lyrics>


<l>Caught up in a whirlwind can't catch my breath,

</l>
<l>knee deep in hot water broke out in a cold sweat

</l>
<l>Can't catch a turtle in this rat race,

</l>
<l>feels like I'm losin' time at a breakneck pace



</l>
<l>Afraid of my own shadow in the face of grace,

</l>
<l>heart full of darkness spotlight on my face

</l>
<l>There was love all around me but I was lookin' for revenge,

</l>
<l>thank God it never found me would have been the end



</l>
<l>I was walkin' the tightrope steppin' on my friends

</l>
<l>Walkin' the tightrope it was a shame and a sin

</l>
<l>Walkin' the tightrope between wrong and right

</l>
<l>Walkin' the tightrope both day and night



</l>
<l>Lookin' back in front of me in the mirror's a grin,

</l>
<l>through eyes of love I see I'm really lookin' at a friend

</l>
<l>We've all had our problems that's the way life is,

</l>
<l>my heart goes out to others who are there to make amends



</l>
<l>We've been walkin' the tightrope tryin' to make it right

</l>
<l>Walkin' the tightrope every day and every night

</l>
<l>Walkin' the tightrope bring it all around

</l>
<l>Walkin' the tightrope from the lost to found



</l>
<l>Walkin' the tightrope stretched around the world

</l>
<l>Walkin' the tightrope save the boys and girls

</l>
<l>Walkin' the tightrope let's make it right

</l>
<l>Walkin' the tightrope do it do it tonight

</l>
<l>Walkin' the tightrope
