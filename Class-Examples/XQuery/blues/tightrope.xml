<lyrics>



Caught up in a whirlwind can't catch my breath,

knee deep in hot water broke out in a cold sweat

Can't catch a turtle in this rat race,

feels like I'm losin' time at a breakneck pace



Afraid of my own shadow in the face of grace,

heart full of darkness spotlight on my face

There was love all around me but I was lookin' for revenge,

thank God it never found me would have been the end



I was walkin' the tightrope steppin' on my friends

Walkin' the tightrope it was a shame and a sin

Walkin' the tightrope between wrong and right

Walkin' the tightrope both day and night



Lookin' back in front of me in the mirror's a grin,

through eyes of love I see I'm really lookin' at a friend

We've all had our problems that's the way life is,

my heart goes out to others who are there to make amends



We've been walkin' the tightrope tryin' to make it right

Walkin' the tightrope every day and every night

Walkin' the tightrope bring it all around

Walkin' the tightrope from the lost to found



Walkin' the tightrope stretched around the world

Walkin' the tightrope save the boys and girls

Walkin' the tightrope let's make it right

Walkin' the tightrope do it do it tonight

Walkin' the tightrope
