A good morning little schoolgirl,
can I go home with you?
Tell your mama and your daddy,
that I'm a little schoolboy too

Baby I love you,
I just can't help help myself
You're so good looking pretty babe,
I don't need nobody else.

Good morning little schoolgirl,
can I go home with you?
Uh, Uh, Uh
I'm gonna leave you baby,
about the break of day
On account of the way you treat me,
I've got to stay away

A good morning little schoolgirl,
can I go home with you?
Tell your mama and your daddy,
that I'm a little schoolboy too

Come on pretty baby,
oh you know I can't help myself
Uh, Uh, Uh
I'm gonna buy me an aeroplane,
to fly all over your town.
And tell everybody baby,
Lord knows you've been putting me down.

I can't stand it babe,
just cannot help myself
You're so young and pretty,
but you're lovin' somebody else

A good morning little schoolgirl,
can I go home with you?
Uh, uh, uh
Oh babe what you do to me,
I can't help myself
