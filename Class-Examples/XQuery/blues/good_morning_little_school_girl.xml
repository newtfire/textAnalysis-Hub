<lyrics>


<l>A good morning little schoolgirl,

can I go home with you?
Tell your mama and your daddy,
that I'm a little schoolboy too


</l>
<l>Baby I love you,

I just can't help help myself
You're so good looking pretty babe,
I don't need nobody else.


</l>
<l>Good morning little schoolgirl,

can I go home with you?
Uh, Uh, Uh
I'm gonna leave you baby,
about the break of day
On account of the way you treat me,
I've got to stay away


</l>
<l>A good morning little schoolgirl,

can I go home with you?
Tell your mama and your daddy,
that I'm a little schoolboy too


</l>
<l>Come on pretty baby,

oh you know I can't help myself
Uh, Uh, Uh
I'm gonna buy me an aeroplane,
to fly all over your town.
And tell everybody baby,
Lord knows you've been putting me down.


</l>
<l>I can't stand it babe,

just cannot help myself
You're so young and pretty,
but you're lovin' somebody else


</l>
<l>A good morning little schoolgirl,
can I go home with you?
Uh, uh, uh
Oh babe what you do to me,
I can't help myself</l></lyrics></xml>
