<lyrics>



I am an old woman

Named after my mother

My old man is another

Child that's grown old



If dreams were thunder

And lightnin' was desire

This old house would'a burned down

A long time ago



Make me an angel, to fly from Montgomery

Make me a poster, of an old rodeo

Just give me one thing, I can hold onto

To believe in this living is just a, hard way to go



When I was a young girl

I had me a cowboy

He wasn't much to look at

Just a free ramblin' man



Aw, but that was a long time

And no matter how I try

Those years they just flow by

Like a broken-down dam



Make me an angel, to fly from Montgomery

Make me a poster, of an old rodeo

Just give me one thing, I can hold onto

To believe in this living is just a, hard way to go



There's flies in the kitchen

I can hear 'em a-buzzin'

But I ain't done nothin'

Since I woke up today



How the hell can a person

Go to work in the mornin'

And come home in the evenin'

And have nothin' to say?



Make me an angel, to fly from Montgomery

Make me a poster, of an old rodeo

Just give me one thing, I can hold onto

To believe in this living is just a, hard way to go
