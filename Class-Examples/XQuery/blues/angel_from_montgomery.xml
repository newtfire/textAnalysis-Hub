<lyrics>


<l>I am an old woman

</l>
<l>Named after my mother

</l>
<l>My old man is another

</l>
<l>Child that's grown old



</l>
<l>If dreams were thunder

</l>
<l>And lightnin' was desire

</l>
<l>This old house would'a burned down

</l>
<l>A long time ago



</l>
<l>Make me an angel, to fly from Montgomery

</l>
<l>Make me a poster, of an old rodeo

</l>
<l>Just give me one thing, I can hold onto

</l>
<l>To believe in this living is just a, hard way to go



</l>
<l>When I was a young girl

</l>
<l>I had me a cowboy

</l>
<l>He wasn't much to look at

</l>
<l>Just a free ramblin' man



</l>
<l>Aw, but that was a long time

</l>
<l>And no matter how I try

</l>
<l>Those years they just flow by

</l>
<l>Like a broken-down dam



</l>
<l>Make me an angel, to fly from Montgomery

</l>
<l>Make me a poster, of an old rodeo

</l>
<l>Just give me one thing, I can hold onto

</l>
<l>To believe in this living is just a, hard way to go



</l>
<l>There's flies in the kitchen

</l>
<l>I can hear 'em a-buzzin'

</l>
<l>But I ain't done nothin'

</l>
<l>Since I woke up today



</l>
<l>How the hell can a person

</l>
<l>Go to work in the mornin'

</l>
<l>And come home in the evenin'

</l>
<l>And have nothin' to say?



</l>
<l>Make me an angel, to fly from Montgomery

</l>
<l>Make me a poster, of an old rodeo

</l>
<l>Just give me one thing, I can hold onto

</l><l>To believe in this living is just a, hard way to go</l></lyrics></xml>
