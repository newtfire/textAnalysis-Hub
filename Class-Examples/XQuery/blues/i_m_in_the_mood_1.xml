<lyrics>


<l>I'm in the mood baby, I'm in the mood for love

</l>
<l>I'm in the mood baby, I'm in the mood for love

</l>
<l>I'm in the mood, I'm in the mood, baby, I'm in the mood for love



</l>
<l>I said night time is the right time, to be with the one you love

</l>
<l>You know when night come baby, God know, you're so far away

</l>
<l>I'm in the mood, I'm in the mood baby, I'm in the mood for love

</l>
<l>I'm in the mood, in the mood, baby, in the mood for love



</l>
<l>I said yes, my mama told me, to leave that girl alone

</l>
<l>But my mama didn't know, God know, girl was puttin' down

</l>
<l>I'm in the mood, I'm in the mood baby, in the mood for love

</l>
<l>I'm in the mood, I'm in the mood, baby, in the mood for love</l></lyrics></xml>
