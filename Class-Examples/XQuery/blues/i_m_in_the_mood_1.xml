<lyrics>



I'm in the mood baby, I'm in the mood for love

I'm in the mood baby, I'm in the mood for love

I'm in the mood, I'm in the mood, baby, I'm in the mood for love



I said night time is the right time, to be with the one you love

You know when night come baby, God know, you're so far away

I'm in the mood, I'm in the mood baby, I'm in the mood for love

I'm in the mood, in the mood, baby, in the mood for love



I said yes, my mama told me, to leave that girl alone

But my mama didn't know, God know, girl was puttin' down

I'm in the mood, I'm in the mood baby, in the mood for love

I'm in the mood, I'm in the mood, baby, in the mood for love
