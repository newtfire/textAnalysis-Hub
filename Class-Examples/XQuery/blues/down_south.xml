<l>Now an' I'm goin' back down South

</l>
<l>Man, where the weather suits my clothes

</l>
<l>Now I done fooled around in Chicago

</l>
<l>Yeah, an' I got done almost froze

</l>
<l>Now that I done fooled around in Chicago

</l>
<l>Lord, I done almost froze



</l>
<l>Lord, my baby, my baby

</l>
<l>She don't treat me good no mo'

</l>
<l>Now I know the reason she don't love me

</l>
<l>She's wild about Mister So an' So

</l>
<l>Now I know the reason she don't love me

</l>
<l>She's wild about Mister So an' So



</l>
<l>Now an' I know my baby

</l>
<l>Mm I know, Miss Lacey, wanna see me now

</l>
<l>Because my baby she didn't want me

</l>
<l>To come way back up here, no how

</l>
<l>Lord, my baby she didn't want me

</l><l>To come way back up here, no how</l></lyrics></xml>
