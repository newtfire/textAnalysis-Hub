<lyrics>



Now an' I'm goin' back down South

Man, where the weather suits my clothes

Now I done fooled around in Chicago

Yeah, an' I got done almost froze

Now that I done fooled around in Chicago

Lord, I done almost froze



Lord, my baby, my baby

She don't treat me good no mo'

Now I know the reason she don't love me

She's wild about Mister So an' So

Now I know the reason she don't love me

She's wild about Mister So an' So



Now an' I know my baby

Mm I know, Miss Lacey, wanna see me now

Because my baby she didn't want me

To come way back up here, no how

Lord, my baby she didn't want me

To come way back up here, no how
