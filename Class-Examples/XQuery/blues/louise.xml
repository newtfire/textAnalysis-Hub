<lyrics>





Her name was Louise,
she came from Mississip'
She had a way with her walk,
her gown was really hip

I met her on the corner,
she was looking mighty fine
Well I knew right when she kissed my lips,
she was mine

She loved me in the morning,
she loved me noon and night
She dressed just like a pretty girl,
the girl was out of sight
Her name was Louise,
and you know she aimed to please
Louise

Well I met her on the street one day,
I saw her with my eyes
She looked and said hello to me,
I thought I would die
Next morning when she left me,
a smile upon my lips
She kissed me and she said good-bye,
I watched her crazy hips

She loved me in the morning,
she loved me noon and night
She dressed just like a pretty girl,
the girl was out of sight
Her name was Louise,
and you know she aimed to please

Louise

Well now a year has past,
she's been seeing other guys
I never thought a pretty face,
could tell so many lies

The guys that she's been seeing,
all have her on their minds
But by the time she's done with them,
they all look so satisfied

She loved me in the morning,
she loved me noon and night
She dressed just like a pretty girl,
the girl was out of sight
Her name was Louise,
and you know she aimed to please
Louise
