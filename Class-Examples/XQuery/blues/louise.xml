<lyrics>


<l>Her name was Louise,

she came from Mississip'
She had a way with her walk,
her gown was really hip


</l>
<l>I met her on the corner,

she was looking mighty fine
Well I knew right when she kissed my lips,
she was mine


</l>
<l>She loved me in the morning,

she loved me noon and night
She dressed just like a pretty girl,
the girl was out of sight
Her name was Louise,
and you know she aimed to please
Louise


</l>
<l>Well I met her on the street one day,

I saw her with my eyes
She looked and said hello to me,
I thought I would die
Next morning when she left me,
a smile upon my lips
She kissed me and she said good-bye,
I watched her crazy hips


</l>
<l>She loved me in the morning,

she loved me noon and night
She dressed just like a pretty girl,
the girl was out of sight
Her name was Louise,
and you know she aimed to please


</l>
<l>Louise

</l>
<l>Well now a year has past,

she's been seeing other guys
I never thought a pretty face,
could tell so many lies


</l>
<l>The guys that she's been seeing,

all have her on their minds
But by the time she's done with them,
they all look so satisfied


</l><l>She loved me in the morning,</l>
<l>she loved me noon and night</l>
<l>She dressed just like a pretty girl,</l>
<l>the girl was out of sight</l>
<l>Her name was Louise,</l>
<l>and you know she aimed to please</l>
<l>Louise</l></lyrics></xml>
