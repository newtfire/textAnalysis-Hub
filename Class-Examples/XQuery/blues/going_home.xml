<lyrics>


<l>I'm going home to see my baby, I'm going home

</l>
<l>I'm going home to see my baby, I'm going home

</l>
<l>I'm gonna take her in my arms

</l>
<l>I'm gonna hold her all night long

</l>
<l>I'm going home to see my baby, I'm going home



</l>
<l>So now, hurry up Mister Man

</l>
<l>Load just as fast as you can

</l>
<l>The plane is already late

</l>
<l>I'm gonna get home as soon as I can

</l>
<l>I wanted to take a bus

</l>
<l>But they said the road was bad

</l>
<l>I started to take a train but a freight was all they had



</l>
<l>I'm going home to see my baby, I'm going home

</l>
<l>I'm going home to see my baby, I'm going home

</l>
<l>I'm gonna take her in my arms

</l>
<l>I'm gonna hold her all night long

</l>
<l>I'm going home to see my baby, I'm going home



</l>
<l>If there is something wrong

</l>
<l>Want to you please let me know

</l>
<l>Because my baby needs me

</l>
<l>And I really really must go

</l>
<l>How bad I wanna see my woman

</l>
<l>I guess you'll never know

</l>
<l>I would start tryin' to walk

</l>
<l>But walkin' is too slow



</l>
<l>I'm going home to see my baby, I'm going home

</l>
<l>I'm going home to see my baby, I'm going home

</l>
<l>I'm gonna take her in my arms

</l>
<l>I'm gonna hold her all night long

</l>
<l>I'm going home to see my baby, I'm going home</l></lyrics></xml>
