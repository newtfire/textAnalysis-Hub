<lyrics>



I'm going home to see my baby, I'm going home

I'm going home to see my baby, I'm going home

I'm gonna take her in my arms

I'm gonna hold her all night long

I'm going home to see my baby, I'm going home



So now, hurry up Mister Man

Load just as fast as you can

The plane is already late

I'm gonna get home as soon as I can

I wanted to take a bus

But they said the road was bad

I started to take a train but a freight was all they had



I'm going home to see my baby, I'm going home

I'm going home to see my baby, I'm going home

I'm gonna take her in my arms

I'm gonna hold her all night long

I'm going home to see my baby, I'm going home



If there is something wrong

Want to you please let me know

Because my baby needs me

And I really really must go

How bad I wanna see my woman

I guess you'll never know

I would start tryin' to walk

But walkin' is too slow



I'm going home to see my baby, I'm going home

I'm going home to see my baby, I'm going home

I'm gonna take her in my arms

I'm gonna hold her all night long

I'm going home to see my baby, I'm going home
