<lyrics>


<l>Everyone has had the blues at some time

</l>
<l>And been used, I ain't lying

</l>
<l>I've been used and abused

</l>
<l>And I've got the blues, blues, blues

</l>
<l>Over you



</l>
<l>Everyone has had it hard at some time

</l>
<l>People trying to find a peace of mind

</l>
<l>I've been trying, I ain't lying

</l>
<l>Trying to find a peace of mind

</l>
<l>Over you



</l>
<l>I lay every night

</l>
<l>Thinking about my situation

</l>
<l>I get the blues

</l>
<l>Right off the bat

</l>
<l>If we can just have

</l>
<l>A decent conversation

</l>
<l>You know that things

</l>
<l>Wouldn't be so bad



</l>
<l>Oh I was cheated, why I don't know

</l>
<l>And mistreated by a no good so and so

</l>
<l>I've been cheated and mistreated

</l>
<l>And I've got the blues, blues, blues

</l>
<l>Over you



</l>
<l>I lay every night

</l>
<l>Thinking about my situation

</l>
<l>I get the blues

</l>
<l>Right off the bat

</l>
<l>If we can just have

</l>
<l>A decent conversation

</l>
<l>You know that things

</l>
<l>Wouldn't be so bad



</l>
<l>You've got to live and let live

</l>
<l>When we were together

</l>
<l>All you wanted for me was to give

</l>
<l>Now I'm not giving, you're barely living

</l>
<l>You're on your own

</l>
<l>You're living all alone

</l>
<l>Now we're through, me and you

</l>
<l>And I don't have the blues, blues, blues

</l><l>Over you</l></lyrics></xml>
