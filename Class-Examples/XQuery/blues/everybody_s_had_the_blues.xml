<lyrics>



Everyone has had the blues at some time

And been used, I ain't lying

I've been used and abused

And I've got the blues, blues, blues

Over you



Everyone has had it hard at some time

People trying to find a peace of mind

I've been trying, I ain't lying

Trying to find a peace of mind

Over you



I lay every night

Thinking about my situation

I get the blues

Right off the bat

If we can just have

A decent conversation

You know that things

Wouldn't be so bad



Oh I was cheated, why I don't know

And mistreated by a no good so and so

I've been cheated and mistreated

And I've got the blues, blues, blues

Over you



I lay every night

Thinking about my situation

I get the blues

Right off the bat

If we can just have

A decent conversation

You know that things

Wouldn't be so bad



You've got to live and let live

When we were together

All you wanted for me was to give

Now I'm not giving, you're barely living

You're on your own

You're living all alone

Now we're through, me and you

And I don't have the blues, blues, blues

Over you
