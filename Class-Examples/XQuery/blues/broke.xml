<lyrics>



I used to be a big shot long ago

I had a Cadillac an' a whole lotta dough

Real fine women used to chase me down

Now, not one-a those gals can be found

They're never home whenever I call

Don't seem to want me around at all



I'm broke, I'm broke, I'm broke, I'm broke

Stone-cold broke, I ain't got a lousy dime



Went to a nightclub an' had my fun

Shuckin' an' 
jivin'
 wit'
ev'ryone

Drinkin' that beer an' gin an' wine

Boy, I'm tellin' ya I had a good time

When I got home I didn't have no loot

Had to go down an' pawn my suit



I'm broke, I'm broke, I'm broke, I'm broke (ha-ha)

Stone-cold broke, I ain't got a lousy dime



Now, I'm a low-down dirty bum

Right back where I started from

I got no car, I got no gal

I ain't even got a pal

Huffin' an' puffin' can't raise a cent

Put me out, I can't pay my rent



I'm broke, I'm broke, I'm broke, I'm broke

Stone-cold broke, I ain't got a lousy dime



(Spoken:

"Damn, I'm broke man, I got no damn money"



"What n' the hell am I gonna do now?"



"Oh hey, Jim, what's happenin' man?"



"Oh man, I'm sure glad to see you!"



"Yeah, I know I owe you twenty dollars man,

but you know hey, look it"



"Well you know they picked up my car up this mornin'?"



"What?" (hm, a-ha)



"You know they say a man ain't suppose to cry?"



"Man, I'm gonna tell ya, you know that they didn't lie"



"Ay, I, I, I'm broke man, I swear I'm broke"



"Ha, I ain't had, man I ain't got it, I got about two dollars, man
that's it"



"Ha, swear I'm broke man"



"Hm yeah, yeah I'm broke, yeah"



Fading:

"Trust me I'm broke, man, yeah I am")
