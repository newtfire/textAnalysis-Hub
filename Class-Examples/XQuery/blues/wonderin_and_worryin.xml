<l>Wonderin' and worryin', will my baby change her mind

</l>
<l>Wonderin' and worryin', will my baby change her mind

</l>
<l>I can't make you love me baby, don't know why I keep on tryin'



</l>
<l>I love you baby, darlin' you just don't understand

</l>
<l>I love you baby, darlin' you just don't understand

</l>
<l>I'm in hope someday darlin', I can be your lovin' man



</l>
<l>One thing baby, I want you to understand

</l>
<l>One thing baby, I want you to understand

</l>
<l>When you've mistreated me baby, you've misused your best friend</l></lyrics></xml>
