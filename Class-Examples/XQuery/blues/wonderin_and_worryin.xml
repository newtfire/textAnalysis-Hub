<lyrics>



Wonderin' and worryin', will my baby change her mind

Wonderin' and worryin', will my baby change her mind

I can't make you love me baby, don't know why I keep on tryin'



I love you baby, darlin' you just don't understand

I love you baby, darlin' you just don't understand

I'm in hope someday darlin', I can be your lovin' man



One thing baby, I want you to understand

One thing baby, I want you to understand

When you've mistreated me baby, you've misused your best friend
