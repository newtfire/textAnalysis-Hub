<l>Democrat put us on our feet, these crazy women they vote them
out

</l>
<l>Democrat put us on our feet, these crazy women they voted them
out

</l>
<l>I don't think they make the same mistake, they won't make the same
mistake no more

</l>
<l>They told them, "Ah, send your sons home",

</l>
<l>they did just that, they send them home to stay without a job

</l>
<l>They won't make that same mistake no more



</l>
<l>Democrat put us on our feet, these crazy women they vote them out

</l>
<l>I ain't goin' down, I ain't goin' down, no I ain't, I ain't goin'
down to the welfare store,

</l>
<l>It won't be long, 'fore the democrats be back in again,

</l>
<l>I know the girls, I know the girls, I know the girls

</l>
<l>You girls ain't gon' make that same mistake again no more, I know you
ain't,

</l>
<l>the men vote them in and the women , the women vote them out



</l>
<l>I ain't got no shoes, no shoes

</l>
<l>(spoken: But I ain't goin' to that welfare store.

</l>
<l>You know why?

</l>
<l>It won't be long 'fore election time,

</l>
<l>democrats be in)



</l>
<l>I know I get shoes, I get clothes, when the democrats get back in
again

</l>
<l>Vote them, they vote them in, I'm a democrat man, I'm a democrat
man

</l>
<l>Please, please don't be no fool no more

</l>
<l>Hmm, hmm I ain't goin' down to that welfare store

</l>
<l>It won't be long, whoa yeah

</l>
<l>I'm a democrat , I'm a democrat man

</l>
<l>And I'll be until the day I die</l></lyrics></xml>
