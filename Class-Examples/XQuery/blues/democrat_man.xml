<lyrics>



Democrat put us on our feet, these crazy women they vote them
out

Democrat put us on our feet, these crazy women they voted them
out

I don't think they make the same mistake, they won't make the same
mistake no more

They told them, "Ah, send your sons home",

they did just that, they send them home to stay without a job

They won't make that same mistake no more



Democrat put us on our feet, these crazy women they vote them out

I ain't goin' down, I ain't goin' down, no I ain't, I ain't goin'
down to the welfare store,

It won't be long, 'fore the democrats be back in again,

I know the girls, I know the girls, I know the girls

You girls ain't gon' make that same mistake again no more, I know you
ain't,

the men vote them in and the women , the women vote them out



I ain't got no shoes, no shoes

(spoken: But I ain't goin' to that welfare store.

You know why?

It won't be long 'fore election time,

democrats be in)



I know I get shoes, I get clothes, when the democrats get back in
again

Vote them, they vote them in, I'm a democrat man, I'm a democrat
man

Please, please don't be no fool no more

Hmm, hmm I ain't goin' down to that welfare store

It won't be long, whoa yeah

I'm a democrat , I'm a democrat man

And I'll be until the day I die
