[Intro]

A young man that inspired me on a guitar,

Mr. T-Bone Walker, I'm gonna do one of his tunes

for you ladies and gentlemen

Called Stormy Monday, if ya don't mind



Hello!

We used to do a lot of the shows together...



They call it stormy Monday (thank you!)

Tuesday's just as bad

(Look out Les, this goin' out to you, Les)

And they call it stormy Monday

Tuesday's just as bad

Wednesday's worse

Thursday, oh so sad, yeah



Yeah, that eagle flies on Friday, an' Saturday I go out to play

Yes, that eagle flies on Friday, an' Saturday I go out to play

Sunday I go to church, I do get on my knees an' pray



[We got Larry Burton on guitar, how 'bout givin' him a hand,
ladies and gentlemen?]

(Yeah!)



The sun rise in the East, and it sets up in the West

Yeah, the sun rise in the East, baby, and it sets up in the West,
yeah

It's hard to tell, it's hard to tell, which one of my love, that I
love best
