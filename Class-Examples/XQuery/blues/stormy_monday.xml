<l>[Intro]

</l>
<l>A young man that inspired me on a guitar,

</l>
<l>Mr. T-Bone Walker, I'm gonna do one of his tunes

</l>
<l>for you ladies and gentlemen

</l>
<l>Called Stormy Monday, if ya don't mind



</l>
<l>Hello!

</l>
<l>We used to do a lot of the shows together...



</l>
<l>They call it stormy Monday (thank you!)

</l>
<l>Tuesday's just as bad

</l>
<l>(Look out Les, this goin' out to you, Les)

</l>
<l>And they call it stormy Monday

</l>
<l>Tuesday's just as bad

</l>
<l>Wednesday's worse

</l>
<l>Thursday, oh so sad, yeah



</l>
<l>Yeah, that eagle flies on Friday, an' Saturday I go out to play

</l>
<l>Yes, that eagle flies on Friday, an' Saturday I go out to play

</l>
<l>Sunday I go to church, I do get on my knees an' pray



</l>
<l>[We got Larry Burton on guitar, how 'bout givin' him a hand,
ladies and gentlemen?]

</l>
<l>(Yeah!)



</l>
<l>The sun rise in the East, and it sets up in the West

</l>
<l>Yeah, the sun rise in the East, baby, and it sets up in the West,
yeah

</l><l>It's hard to tell, it's hard to tell, which one of my love, that I</l>
<l>love best</l></lyrics></xml>
