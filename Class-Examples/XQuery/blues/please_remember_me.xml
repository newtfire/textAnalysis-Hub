<lyrics>



I'm cryin' please, baby, honey, please remember me

I'm cryin' please, baby, please remember me

Well, it fills my heart with great consolation, darlin', to know that
you will remember me



Well, I want you to love me, baby, like the snow falls on the cold,
cold ground

Yes, I want you to love me, baby, like the snow falls on the cold,
cold ground

Lord, with your love like that, darlin', I know you'll never let me
down



Well, alright

Just talk to me, baby

Yes, alright



Well, when you were leavin', baby, well, I could see the smile on
your face

Oh, yes, when my baby was leavin', people, I could see the smile on
her face

Well, you know I'm so glad, people, there is no-one can take my
place
