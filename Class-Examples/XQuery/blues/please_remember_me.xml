<l>I'm cryin' please, baby, honey, please remember me

</l>
<l>I'm cryin' please, baby, please remember me

</l>
<l>Well, it fills my heart with great consolation, darlin', to know that

you will remember me




</l>
<l>Well, I want you to love me, baby, like the snow falls on the cold,
cold ground

</l>
<l>Yes, I want you to love me, baby, like the snow falls on the cold,
cold ground

</l>
<l>Lord, with your love like that, darlin', I know you'll never let me

down




</l>
<l>Well, alright

</l>
<l>Just talk to me, baby

</l>
<l>Yes, alright



</l>
<l>Well, when you were leavin', baby, well, I could see the smile on
your face

</l>
<l>Oh, yes, when my baby was leavin', people, I could see the smile on
her face

</l><l>Well, you know I'm so glad, people, there is no-one can take my</l>
<l>place</l></lyrics></xml>
