<lyrics>



My baby caught the train, left me all alone

My baby caught the train, left me all alone

She knows I love her, she doin' me wrong



My baby bought the ticket, long as her right arm

My baby bought the ticket, long as my right arm

She says she's gonna ride, long as I been from home



Well who been talking, everything that I do

Well who been talking, everything that I do

Well you is my baby, I hate to lose



Well good bye baby, hate to see you go

Well good bye baby, hate to see you go

You know I love you, I'm the causin of it all

I'm the causin' of it all

I'm the causin' of it all

I'm the causin' of it all

I'm the causin' of it all
