<l>My baby caught the train, left me all alone

</l>
<l>My baby caught the train, left me all alone

</l>
<l>She knows I love her, she doin' me wrong



</l>
<l>My baby bought the ticket, long as her right arm

</l>
<l>My baby bought the ticket, long as my right arm

</l>
<l>She says she's gonna ride, long as I been from home



</l>
<l>Well who been talking, everything that I do

</l>
<l>Well who been talking, everything that I do

</l>
<l>Well you is my baby, I hate to lose



</l>
<l>Well good bye baby, hate to see you go

</l>
<l>Well good bye baby, hate to see you go

</l>
<l>You know I love you, I'm the causin of it all

</l>
<l>I'm the causin' of it all

</l>

</l>
