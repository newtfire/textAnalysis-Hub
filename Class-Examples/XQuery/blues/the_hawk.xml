<lyrics>



(Spoken:

I remember when I was snowed in and up at old Shire town.

I'm sure the next tour take me right back through that town.

Snow was up to your shoulders man and that ain't no lie.

Chicago wasn't so cold, it would make a polar bear cry.)



Now when you hear the people talk about their bird called the
hawk

Now I'm gonna tell ya somethin' that'll make you, let out a
squawk



(Spoken:

Now where I live the weather's mostly warm.

We don't have to worry about no snow or if we have a storm.

But Shire town sits on the shores of a lake,

and when that hawk flaps his wings it make you shiver an' shake.)



Now when you hear the people talk about their bird called the
hawk

Man, I'm tellin' ya one thing, they just let out a squawk



(Spoken:

But man, you should a been there in the winter of '78.

You couldn't catch a cab down on State and Lake.

Now, you know that's bad 'cause, that's right in the heart of
town.

And it was so bad the mayor had to close the whole town down.)



Now when you hear the people talk about their bird called the
hawk

Oh man, I tell you, tell you, let out a squawk
