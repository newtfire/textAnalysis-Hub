<lyrics>


<l>(Spoken:

</l>
<l>I remember when I was snowed in and up at old Shire town.

</l>
<l>I'm sure the next tour take me right back through that town.

</l>
<l>Snow was up to your shoulders man and that ain't no lie.

</l>
<l>Chicago wasn't so cold, it would make a polar bear cry.)



</l>
<l>Now when you hear the people talk about their bird called the
hawk

</l>
<l>Now I'm gonna tell ya somethin' that'll make you, let out a

squawk




</l>
<l>(Spoken:

</l>
<l>Now where I live the weather's mostly warm.

</l>
<l>We don't have to worry about no snow or if we have a storm.

</l>
<l>But Shire town sits on the shores of a lake,

</l>
<l>and when that hawk flaps his wings it make you shiver an' shake.)



</l>
<l>Now when you hear the people talk about their bird called the
hawk

</l>
<l>Man, I'm tellin' ya one thing, they just let out a squawk



</l>
<l>(Spoken:

</l>
<l>But man, you should a been there in the winter of '78.

</l>
<l>You couldn't catch a cab down on State and Lake.

</l>
<l>Now, you know that's bad 'cause, that's right in the heart of
town.

</l>
<l>And it was so bad the mayor had to close the whole town down.)



</l>
<l>Now when you hear the people talk about their bird called the
hawk

</l><l>Oh man, I tell you, tell you, let out a squawk</l></lyrics></xml>
