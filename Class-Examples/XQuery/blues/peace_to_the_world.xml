<lyrics>



Raise up your hands, and put a smile on your face

I'm talking to everyone, in the human race

We're proud and strong, so stand up tall

Let's all get together, bring peace to the world



There's a train of love, beginning right here

So jump on to it, and have no fear

It's yours, it's mine, we got the call

Let's all get together, and bring peace to the world



Let's all get together, bring peace to the world

Let's all get together, bring peace to the world

Every man and woman, boy and girl

Let's all get together, bring peace to the world



Shelter the homeless, open your door

Feed the hungry, give to the poor

Offer your heart, don't think small

Let's all get together, bring peace to the world



Let's all get together, bring peace to the world

Let's all get together, bring peace to the world

Every man and woman, boy and girl

Let's all get together, bring peace to the world
