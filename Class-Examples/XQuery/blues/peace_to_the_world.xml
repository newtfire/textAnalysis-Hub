<lyrics>


<l>Raise up your hands, and put a smile on your face

</l>
<l>I'm talking to everyone, in the human race

</l>
<l>We're proud and strong, so stand up tall

</l>
<l>Let's all get together, bring peace to the world



</l>
<l>There's a train of love, beginning right here

</l>
<l>So jump on to it, and have no fear

</l>
<l>It's yours, it's mine, we got the call

</l>
<l>Let's all get together, and bring peace to the world



</l>
<l>Let's all get together, bring peace to the world

</l>
<l>Let's all get together, bring peace to the world

</l>
<l>Every man and woman, boy and girl

</l>
<l>Let's all get together, bring peace to the world



</l>
<l>Shelter the homeless, open your door

</l>
<l>Feed the hungry, give to the poor

</l>
<l>Offer your heart, don't think small

</l>
<l>Let's all get together, bring peace to the world



</l>
<l>Let's all get together, bring peace to the world

</l>
<l>Let's all get together, bring peace to the world

</l>
<l>Every man and woman, boy and girl

</l>
<l>Let's all get together, bring peace to the world</l></lyrics></xml>
