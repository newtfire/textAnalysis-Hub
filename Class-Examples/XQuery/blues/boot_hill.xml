<lyrics>



Look up on the wall baby,

hand me down my shootin' iron

Look up on the wall baby,

hand me down my shootin' iron

Call your mother long distance,

tell her to expect your body home



If the city don't bury you baby,

Lord knows the county will

If the city don't bury you baby,

Lord knows the county will

You made your last mistake,

you going way out on that boot hill



Lord I don't want to whacks you darlin',

'cause you gave me my first thrill

Lord I don't want to whacks you baby,

'cause you gave me my first thrill

You did me so wrong,

you're going way out on that boot hill
