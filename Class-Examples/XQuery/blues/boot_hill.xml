<lyrics>


<l>Look up on the wall baby,

</l>
<l>hand me down my shootin' iron

</l>
<l>Look up on the wall baby,

</l>
<l>hand me down my shootin' iron

</l>
<l>Call your mother long distance,

</l>
<l>tell her to expect your body home



</l>
<l>If the city don't bury you baby,

</l>
<l>Lord knows the county will

</l>
<l>If the city don't bury you baby,

</l>
<l>Lord knows the county will

</l>
<l>You made your last mistake,

</l>
<l>you going way out on that boot hill



</l>
<l>Lord I don't want to whacks you darlin',

</l>
<l>'cause you gave me my first thrill

</l>
<l>Lord I don't want to whacks you baby,

</l>
<l>'cause you gave me my first thrill

</l>
<l>You did me so wrong,

</l>
<l>you're going way out on that boot hill
