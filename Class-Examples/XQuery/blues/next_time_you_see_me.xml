<lyrics>


<l>Next time you see me, things won't be the same

</l>
<l>Yes, next time you see me, things won't be the same

</l>
<l>And if it hurts you my darlin', you only have yourself to blame



</l>
<l>Like a true, true sayin', all that shines is not gold

</l>
<l>Yes, like a true, true sayin', all that shine is not gold

</l>
<l>And like the good book say, you've got to reap just what you sow



</l>
<l>Well, you lied, cheated, uh-oh for so long

</l>
<l>Well, you lied, cheated, uh-oh for so long

</l>
<l>You're just the wrong darned woman, another queen is on your

throne




</l>
<l>Next time you see me, things won't be the same

</l>
<l>Yes, next time you see me, things won't be the same

</l>
<l>And if it hurts you my darlin', you only have yourself to blame

</l>
<l>fading:

</l>
<l>And if it hurts you my darlin', you only have yourself to blame

</l>
<l>And if it hurts you my darlin', you only have yourself to blame

</l>
<l>And if it hurts you my darlin', you only have yourself to blame</l></lyrics></xml>
