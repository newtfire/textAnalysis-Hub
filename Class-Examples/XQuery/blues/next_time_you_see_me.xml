<lyrics>



Next time you see me, things won't be the same

Yes, next time you see me, things won't be the same

And if it hurts you my darlin', you only have yourself to blame



Like a true, true sayin', all that shines is not gold

Yes, like a true, true sayin', all that shine is not gold

And like the good book say, you've got to reap just what you sow



Well, you lied, cheated, uh-oh for so long

Well, you lied, cheated, uh-oh for so long

You're just the wrong darned woman, another queen is on your
throne



Next time you see me, things won't be the same

Yes, next time you see me, things won't be the same

And if it hurts you my darlin', you only have yourself to blame

fading:

And if it hurts you my darlin', you only have yourself to blame

And if it hurts you my darlin', you only have yourself to blame

And if it hurts you my darlin', you only have yourself to blame
