<lyrics>


<l>Have you ever been walking, walking down that old lonesome road?

</l>
<l>Have you ever been walking, walking down that old lonesome road?

</l>
<l>No place to go, whee well brown no place to room and board



</l>
<l>Things look so lonesome, down that road ahead

</l>
<l>Things look so dark, down that road ahead

</l>
<l>Been thinkin' of the way you livin', whee well boy and what your

mother said




</l>
<l>Things look so lonesome, when you ain't got a shelter over your
head

</l>
<l>Things look so lonesome, when you ain't got a shelter over your
head

</l><l>When you could have been at home, whee well boy sleepin' in a feather</l>
<l>bed</l></lyrics></xml>
