<lyrics>



Have you ever been walking, walking down that old lonesome road?

Have you ever been walking, walking down that old lonesome road?

No place to go, whee well brown no place to room and board



Things look so lonesome, down that road ahead

Things look so dark, down that road ahead

Been thinkin' of the way you livin', whee well boy and what your
mother said



Things look so lonesome, when you ain't got a shelter over your
head

Things look so lonesome, when you ain't got a shelter over your
head

When you could have been at home, whee well boy sleepin' in a feather
bed
