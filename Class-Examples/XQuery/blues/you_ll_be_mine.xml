<lyrics>



You so sweet, you so fine

How I wish, you were mine

Honey I'll, be your love

You'll be mine, you'll be mine



You so nice, you so true

I'm so glad, I love you

Honey I'll, be your love

You'll be mine, you'll be mine



Tell me, pretty baby

If you, gonna try

If you'll, stay baby

Hang on baby 'till the, day I die



It's true, I love you

I don't care, what you do

Honey I'll, be your love

You'll be mine, you'll be mine

You'll be mine, you'll be mine



Tell me, pretty baby

If your, gonna try

If you'll, stay baby

Hang on baby 'till the, day I die



It's true, I love you

I don't care, what you do

Honey I'll, be your love

You'll be mine, you'll be mine

You'll be mine, you'll be mine
