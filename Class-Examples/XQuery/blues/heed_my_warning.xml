<lyrics>



You can lead a horse to water

But you can't make him drink

You can send a kid to college

But you can't make him think

You'll never miss your water, baby

ill the well runs dry

And you'll never miss me, baby

Till I say good-bye

Mm hm, you'd better heed my warning



The straw that broke the camel's back

Didn't have to be so big

And when you ran off and left me, baby

I almost blew my wig

They say he who has the last laugh

Always laughs the best

And I'm gonna laugh louder, baby

Than all the rest

Mm hm, baby, you'd better heed

You'd better heed my warning



If you want me to get out, baby

You know you don't have to push

But you'll find a bird in hand

Is worth two in the bush

There's no need to lock the barn door

When the cow is gone

But you're gonna miss me, baby

On some frosty dawn

Mm hm, you know you'd better heed

You'd better heed my warning



It's a long, long road

That don't have a turn

You have to be an early bird

If you wanna catch a worm

They say absence makes

The heart grow fonder

So its plain to see

If the grass look greener yonder

Baby, that's where I'm gonna be

Mm hm, baby, you know you'd better heed

You'd better heed my warning
