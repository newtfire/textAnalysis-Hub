<lyrics>


<l>You can lead a horse to water

</l>
<l>But you can't make him drink

</l>
<l>You can send a kid to college

</l>
<l>But you can't make him think

</l>
<l>You'll never miss your water, baby

</l>
<l>ill the well runs dry

</l>
<l>And you'll never miss me, baby

</l>
<l>Till I say good-bye

</l>
<l>Mm hm, you'd better heed my warning



</l>
<l>The straw that broke the camel's back

</l>
<l>Didn't have to be so big

</l>
<l>And when you ran off and left me, baby

</l>
<l>I almost blew my wig

</l>
<l>They say he who has the last laugh

</l>
<l>Always laughs the best

</l>
<l>And I'm gonna laugh louder, baby

</l>
<l>Than all the rest

</l>
<l>Mm hm, baby, you'd better heed

</l>
<l>You'd better heed my warning



</l>
<l>If you want me to get out, baby

</l>
<l>You know you don't have to push

</l>
<l>But you'll find a bird in hand

</l>
<l>Is worth two in the bush

</l>
<l>There's no need to lock the barn door

</l>
<l>When the cow is gone

</l>
<l>But you're gonna miss me, baby

</l>
<l>On some frosty dawn

</l>
<l>Mm hm, you know you'd better heed

</l>
<l>You'd better heed my warning



</l>
<l>It's a long, long road

</l>
<l>That don't have a turn

</l>
<l>You have to be an early bird

</l>
<l>If you wanna catch a worm

</l>
<l>They say absence makes

</l>
<l>The heart grow fonder

</l>
<l>So its plain to see

</l>
<l>If the grass look greener yonder

</l>
<l>Baby, that's where I'm gonna be

</l>
<l>Mm hm, baby, you know you'd better heed

</l>
<l>You'd better heed my warning</l></lyrics></xml>
