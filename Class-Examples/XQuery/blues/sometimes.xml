<lyrics>



Sometime I feel like cryin', but the tears won't come down

Sometime I feel like cryin', but the tears won't come down

All because I want my loved one, but she's nowhere around



Sometime I think I gonna leave, then again I wanna stay

Oh-oh, think I wanna leave, then again I wanna stay

Yes my thought's so mixed up, ever since she went away



Sometime I hope and I pray, that she'll return someday

Oh-oh, hope and I pray, that she'll return someday

But I'm so all alone, I know I can't last this way



Sometime I feel like cryin', but the tears won't come down

Oh yeah, feel like cryin' , but the tears won't come down

All because I want my loved one and she's nowhere around
