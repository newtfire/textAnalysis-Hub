<lyrics>


<l>Sometime I feel like cryin', but the tears won't come down

</l>
<l>Sometime I feel like cryin', but the tears won't come down

</l>
<l>All because I want my loved one, but she's nowhere around



</l>
<l>Sometime I think I gonna leave, then again I wanna stay

</l>
<l>Oh-oh, think I wanna leave, then again I wanna stay

</l>
<l>Yes my thought's so mixed up, ever since she went away



</l>
<l>Sometime I hope and I pray, that she'll return someday

</l>
<l>Oh-oh, hope and I pray, that she'll return someday

</l>
<l>But I'm so all alone, I know I can't last this way



</l>
<l>Sometime I feel like cryin', but the tears won't come down

</l>
<l>Oh yeah, feel like cryin' , but the tears won't come down

</l>
<l>All because I want my loved one and she's nowhere around</l></lyrics></xml>
