<lyrics>



I love the tip, I love the top, I love you better than a hog loves
slop

'Cause you're a big legged woman, with a short short miniskirt

Promise me darlin', you'll never make me feel like dirt



Just like the vine, goes around the stump, you are mine, call me
sugar lump

'Cause you're a big-legged woman, with a short short miniskirt

Promise me darlin, you'll never make me feel like dirt



I've told you once, I've told you twice, we go together, like fried
beans and rice

'Cause you're a big legged woman, with a short short miniskirt

Promise me darlin, you'll never make me feel like dirt



Ashes to ashes and dust to dust, you mess with my woman, I'm gonna
hurt you first

'Cause she's a big-legged woman, with a short short miniskirt

Promise me darlin, you'll never make me feel like dirt



I love my big-legged woman, I love my big-legged woman

I love my big-legged woman, I love my big-legged woman

I love my big-legged woman, I love my big-legged woman

She's alright, she's alright

She's alright, she's alright

She's alright, she's alright

She's alright she's alright

She's alright she's...
