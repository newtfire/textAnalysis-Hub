<lyrics>


<l>I love the tip, I love the top, I love you better than a hog loves
slop

</l>
<l>'Cause you're a big legged woman, with a short short miniskirt

</l>
<l>Promise me darlin', you'll never make me feel like dirt



</l>
<l>Just like the vine, goes around the stump, you are mine, call me
sugar lump

</l>
<l>'Cause you're a big-legged woman, with a short short miniskirt

</l>
<l>Promise me darlin, you'll never make me feel like dirt



</l>
<l>I've told you once, I've told you twice, we go together, like fried
beans and rice

</l>
<l>'Cause you're a big legged woman, with a short short miniskirt

</l>
<l>Promise me darlin, you'll never make me feel like dirt



</l>
<l>Ashes to ashes and dust to dust, you mess with my woman, I'm gonna
hurt you first

</l>
<l>'Cause she's a big-legged woman, with a short short miniskirt

</l>
<l>Promise me darlin, you'll never make me feel like dirt



</l>
<l>I love my big-legged woman, I love my big-legged woman

</l>
<l>I love my big-legged woman, I love my big-legged woman

</l>
<l>I love my big-legged woman, I love my big-legged woman

</l>
<l>She's alright, she's alright

</l>
<l>She's alright, she's alright

</l>
<l>She's alright, she's alright

</l>
<l>She's alright she's alright

</l>
<l>She's alright she's...</l></lyrics></xml>
