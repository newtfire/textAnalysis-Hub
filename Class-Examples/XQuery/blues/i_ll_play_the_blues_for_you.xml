<lyrics>


<l>If you're down and out and you feel real hurt

</l>
<l>Come on over to the place where I live

</l>
<l>And all your loneliness I'll try to soothe

</l>
<l>I'll play the blues for you



</l>
<l>Don't be afraid come on in

</l>
<l>You might run across some of your old friends

</l>
<l>All your loneliness I gotta soothe

</l>
<l>I'll play the blues for you



</l>
<l>I got no big name and I ain't no big star

</l>
<l>I play the blues for you on my guitar

</l>
<l>All your loneliness I'll try to soothe

</l>
<l>I 'll play the blues for you</l></lyrics></xml>
