<l>Angelina, baby, won't you please come home

</l>
<l>Angelina, baby, won't you please come home

</l>
<l>You know my heart is aching and all my dreams have gone



</l>
<l>Well, now my bed is empty, my feets and my hands are cold

</l>
<l>You know my bed is empty, my feets and my hands are cold

</l>
<l>Come on home, Angelina, my love for you will never grow old



</l>
<l>Well now I've tried to love you with diamonds and pearls

</l>
<l>But all that did was tear us apart

</l>
<l>And I've tried to give you everything in the world

</l>
<l>When all you really wanted - to wound my heart, oh-ho



</l>
<l>Angelina, baby, won't you please come home

</l>
<l>Oh, Angelina, baby, won't you please come home

</l>
<l>You know my heart is aching and all my dreams have gone



</l>
<l>Well I've tried to love you with diamonds and pearls

</l>
<l>But all that did was tear us apart

</l>
<l>And I've tried to give you everything in the world

</l>
<l>When all you really wanted - to wound my heart, my heart



</l>
<l>Angelina, baby, baby, won't you please come home

</l>
<l>Well, sweet Angelina, baby, won't you please come home

</l>
<l>You know my heart is aching and all my dreams have gone



</l>
<l>(That's right, baby)



</l>
<l>You know my heart is aching and all my dreams have gone</l></lyrics></xml>
