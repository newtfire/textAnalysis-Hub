<lyrics>



Angelina, baby, won't you please come home

Angelina, baby, won't you please come home

You know my heart is aching and all my dreams have gone



Well, now my bed is empty, my feets and my hands are cold

You know my bed is empty, my feets and my hands are cold

Come on home, Angelina, my love for you will never grow old



Well now I've tried to love you with diamonds and pearls

But all that did was tear us apart

And I've tried to give you everything in the world

When all you really wanted - to wound my heart, oh-ho



Angelina, baby, won't you please come home

Oh, Angelina, baby, won't you please come home

You know my heart is aching and all my dreams have gone



Well I've tried to love you with diamonds and pearls

But all that did was tear us apart

And I've tried to give you everything in the world

When all you really wanted - to wound my heart, my heart



Angelina, baby, baby, won't you please come home

Well, sweet Angelina, baby, won't you please come home

You know my heart is aching and all my dreams have gone



(That's right, baby)



You know my heart is aching and all my dreams have gone
