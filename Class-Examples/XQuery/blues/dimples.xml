<lyrics>



I love the way you walk

I love the way you walk

I'm crazy 'bout your walk

I love the way you walk

You my babe, I got my eyes on you



I like the way you switch

I like the way you switch

I like the way you switch

I like the way you switch

You my babe, I got my eyes on you



You got dimples in your jaw

You got dimples in your jaw

You got dimples in your jaw

You got dimples in your jaw

You my babe, I got my eyes on you



Well I see you every day

Well I see you every day

If you need to look

Well I see you every day

Well I see you every day

You my babe, I got my eyes on you
