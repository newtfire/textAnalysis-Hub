<lyrics>



Give me a pencil and paper, I just want to figure your time

Give me a pencil and paper, I just want to figure your time

Well I'm gonna put it down in black and white, you know I ain't
lyin'



On the twelfth of April and the year in 19 and 61

On the twelfth of April and the year a 19 and 61

Ya know I watched it, a few times now, an' you and your man, was
havin' fun



Right then, I quitted you, but you begged me to take you back,
uum

Yeah, ya know I think I've quittin' that woman, but she begged me to
take her back

Yeah, you know I'z a man-a-my word, now and now this is the way, my
bab-ay



Um-hm



'Ciden' I said I'm through, bab-ay I mean I'm through

'Ciden' I said that I m through, bab-ay I mean I'm through

Yeah, and I been so many people forgotten, one day I'm goin' to
forget you...
