<lyrics>



I ask you where you're goin' and you tell me where you
been

I can tell you been doin' me wrong, baby, from the shape you're
in

You better open up you're eyes baby, 'cause fools do get wise



Your late up and sleep all day, you jump and you ramble all night

Well the fool that I am baby, I can tell you ain't doin' me right

You better wake up and realize that fools do get wise



Yeah, when the cat's away, I know the rat 's gonna play

But I can't tell what you're puttin' down, woman, you play when the
cat 's around

You better try this one on for size, I tell you fools do get wise



I'm through being you're fool baby, I ain't gonna give you another
red cent

Gonna tell the rent man to padlock the door, 'cause I ain't gonna pay
your rent no more

You better open up you're eyes woman, fools do get wise
