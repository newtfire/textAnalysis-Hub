<lyrics>


<l>I ask you where you're goin' and you tell me where you
been

</l>
<l>I can tell you been doin' me wrong, baby, from the shape you're
in

</l>
<l>You better open up you're eyes baby, 'cause fools do get wise



</l>
<l>Your late up and sleep all day, you jump and you ramble all night

</l>
<l>Well the fool that I am baby, I can tell you ain't doin' me right

</l>
<l>You better wake up and realize that fools do get wise



</l>
<l>Yeah, when the cat's away, I know the rat 's gonna play

</l>
<l>But I can't tell what you're puttin' down, woman, you play when the
cat 's around

</l>
<l>You better try this one on for size, I tell you fools do get wise



</l>
<l>I'm through being you're fool baby, I ain't gonna give you another
red cent

</l>
<l>Gonna tell the rent man to padlock the door, 'cause I ain't gonna pay
your rent no more

</l>
<l>You better open up you're eyes woman, fools do get wise</l></lyrics></xml>
