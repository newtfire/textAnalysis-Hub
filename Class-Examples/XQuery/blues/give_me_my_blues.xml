<lyrics>



I play my music, the only way that I can

Play my music only, only way I can

Some people really dig it, some just don't understand



I play my music only, only way I can

I play my music, play it the only way I can

Some people really dig it, some just don't understand



I don't play the drums

I can't disco dance

But I can play the blues

Put you in a trance



I can play my music, only way I can

Some people really dig it

Some just don't understand



Give my blues song, I'll play it all night long

Give me a blues song, I'll play it all night long

It may not sound right to you but I know that, that ain't wrong



I don't do no country

I don't do no jazz

I don't do no punk rock

That kinda razz-ma-tazz



I play my blues song

The only way I can

Some people really dig it

Some just don't understand



Ooh-ho, yeah
