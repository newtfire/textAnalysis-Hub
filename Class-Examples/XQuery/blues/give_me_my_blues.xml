<lyrics>


<l>I play my music, the only way that I can

</l>
<l>Play my music only, only way I can

</l>
<l>Some people really dig it, some just don't understand



</l>
<l>I play my music only, only way I can

</l>
<l>I play my music, play it the only way I can

</l>
<l>Some people really dig it, some just don't understand



</l>
<l>I don't play the drums

</l>
<l>I can't disco dance

</l>
<l>But I can play the blues

</l>
<l>Put you in a trance



</l>
<l>I can play my music, only way I can

</l>
<l>Some people really dig it

</l>
<l>Some just don't understand



</l>
<l>Give my blues song, I'll play it all night long

</l>
<l>Give me a blues song, I'll play it all night long

</l>
<l>It may not sound right to you but I know that, that ain't wrong



</l>
<l>I don't do no country

</l>
<l>I don't do no jazz

</l>
<l>I don't do no punk rock

</l>
<l>That kinda razz-ma-tazz



</l>
<l>I play my blues song

</l>
<l>The only way I can

</l>
<l>Some people really dig it

</l>
<l>Some just don't understand



</l><l>Ooh-ho, yeah</l></lyrics></xml>
