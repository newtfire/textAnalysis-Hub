<lyrics>



Trouble in mind, I'm blue

But I won't be blue always,

'Cause that sun is gonna shine in my back door someday



Now all you men's the same

But now I'm old enough to change my name

Lord, that sun's gonna shine in my back door someday



I'm gonna lay my head

On that lonesome railroad line

And let the 2:19 ease my troubled mind



Trouble in mind, I'm blue,

But I won't be blue always

Child, that wind's gonna come and blow my blues away!
