<lyrics>



Oh, baby you done lost your good thing now

Oh, baby you done lost your good thing now

Well the way I used to love you baby, baby that's the way I hate you
now



You used to say that you loved me, but baby I believe you've changed
your mind

You used to say that you loved me, but baby I believe you've changed
your mind

Well I don't blame you baby, because you ain't what you used to
be



Let me love you just one more time, yes let me love you just one more
time anyway

Oh, let me love you, let me love you, let me love you, one more time
baby

Let me love you just one more time anyway, oh you can't quit me now
baby

Because you didn't mean me no good anyway



Well you know where I'm from baby, so please don't try to mistreat
me

Yes you know where I'm from baby, so please don't try to mistreat
me

Yes because I'll make your mother a present, baby of you and your
casket too



Oh you once said you loved me and you would do anything I said

Oh you once said you loved me baby and you would do anything I
said

Oh but the way you treat me now baby, I just soon rather be dead



Oh, baby you done lost your good thing now

Oh, baby you done lost your good thing now

The way I used to love you, baby that's the way I hate you now
