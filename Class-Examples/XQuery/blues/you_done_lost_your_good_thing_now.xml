<l>Oh, baby you done lost your good thing now

</l>
<l>Oh, baby you done lost your good thing now

</l>
<l>Well the way I used to love you baby, baby that's the way I hate you

now




</l>
<l>You used to say that you loved me, but baby I believe you've changed
your mind

</l>
<l>You used to say that you loved me, but baby I believe you've changed
your mind

</l>
<l>Well I don't blame you baby, because you ain't what you used to

be




</l>
<l>Let me love you just one more time, yes let me love you just one more
time anyway

</l>
<l>Oh, let me love you, let me love you, let me love you, one more time
baby

</l>
<l>Let me love you just one more time anyway, oh you can't quit me now
baby

</l>
<l>Because you didn't mean me no good anyway



</l>
<l>Well you know where I'm from baby, so please don't try to mistreat
me

</l>
<l>Yes you know where I'm from baby, so please don't try to mistreat
me

</l>
<l>Yes because I'll make your mother a present, baby of you and your

casket too




</l>
<l>Oh you once said you loved me and you would do anything I said

</l>
<l>Oh you once said you loved me baby and you would do anything I
said

</l>
<l>Oh but the way you treat me now baby, I just soon rather be dead



</l>
<l>Oh, baby you done lost your good thing now

</l>
<l>Oh, baby you done lost your good thing now

</l><l>The way I used to love you, baby that's the way I hate you now</l></lyrics></xml>
