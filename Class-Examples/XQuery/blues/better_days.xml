<lyrics>


<l>I've been wrong, wrong for so long

</l>
<l>Living life like this, I just can't go on

</l>
<l>Without a helping hand,

</l>
<l>I just can't seem to find my way

</l>
<l>So I'll keep waiting, waiting for my better days

</l>
<l>Better Days



</l>
<l>Now I said a prayer last night,

</l>
<l>when my day was through

</l>
<l>That I could live my life,

</l>
<l>the way the Lord would want me to

</l>
<l>'Cause without a helping hand,

</l>
<l>I just can't seem to find my way

</l>
<l>So I'll keep waiting, waiting for my better days

</l>
<l>Better Days



</l>
<l>Tell me I have a home just as long as you have yours

</l>
<l>'Cause there's a pain in my heart

</l>
<l>Oh that I've just got to cure

</l>
<l>Please, please baby won't you take me in

</l>
<l>There's been too many times I needed to find a true friend

</l>
<l>Say you'll always, always tell the truth to me

</l>
<l>'Cause there's been too many times,

</l>
<l>that I've been lied to and deceived,

</l>
<l>and somehow I got lost, and now I can't find my way

</l>
<l>Oh I guess I'll keep waiting, waiting for my better days

</l>
<l>Better Days



</l>
<l>Tell me I have a home just as long as you have yours

</l>
<l>'Cause there's a pain in my heart

</l>
<l>Oh that I've just got to cure,

</l>
<l>and somehow I got lost, and now I can't find my way

</l>
<l>Oh I guess I'll keep waiting, waiting for my better days

</l>
<l>Better Days</l></lyrics></xml>
