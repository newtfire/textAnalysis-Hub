<lyrics>



I've been wrong, wrong for so long

Living life like this, I just can't go on

Without a helping hand,

I just can't seem to find my way

So I'll keep waiting, waiting for my better days

Better Days



Now I said a prayer last night,

when my day was through

That I could live my life,

the way the Lord would want me to

'Cause without a helping hand,

I just can't seem to find my way

So I'll keep waiting, waiting for my better days

Better Days



Tell me I have a home just as long as you have yours

'Cause there's a pain in my heart

Oh that I've just got to cure

Please, please baby won't you take me in

There's been too many times I needed to find a true friend

Say you'll always, always tell the truth to me

'Cause there's been too many times,

that I've been lied to and deceived,

and somehow I got lost, and now I can't find my way

Oh I guess I'll keep waiting, waiting for my better days

Better Days



Tell me I have a home just as long as you have yours

'Cause there's a pain in my heart

Oh that I've just got to cure,

and somehow I got lost, and now I can't find my way

Oh I guess I'll keep waiting, waiting for my better days

Better Days
