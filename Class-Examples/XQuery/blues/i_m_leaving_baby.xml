<lyrics>



Leaving, going back 
down
the line

Leaving, going back down the line

You don't treat me right, baby

Going to Tennessee

Tennessee, here I come

Tennessee, that's my home, going back

Tennessee

I'm cutting out, cutting out, baby, cutting out

This morning, baby, oh yeah

Going home, cutting out, oh yeah



Now, baby, you give me a normal line of 
jive

You told me you'll always be my friend

I brought you here, now baby, you done me wrong

I'm leaving, leaving

I'm going back down the line, down the line

Oh yes, hmmm, hmmm, hmmm, hmmm

When you say, goodbye

When you say, goodbye

Oh baby
