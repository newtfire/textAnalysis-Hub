<l>Leaving, going back down the line

<l>You don't treat me right, baby

</l>
<l>Going to Tennessee

</l>
<l>Tennessee, here I come

</l>
<l>Tennessee, that's my home, going back

</l>
<l>Tennessee

</l>
<l>I'm cutting out, cutting out, baby, cutting out

</l>
<l>This morning, baby, oh yeah

</l>
<l>Going home, cutting out, oh yeah



</l>
<l>Now, baby, you give me a normal line of 
jive

</l>
<l>You told me you'll always be my friend

</l>
<l>I brought you here, now baby, you done me wrong

</l>
<l>I'm leaving, leaving

</l>
<l>I'm going back down the line, down the line

</l>
<l>Oh yes, hmmm, hmmm, hmmm, hmmm

</l>
<l>When you say, goodbye
