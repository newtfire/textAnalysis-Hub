<l>Well I'll be around to see ya baby

</l>
<l>Well I'll be around no matter what you say

</l>
<l>I'll be around, yes I'll be around

</l>
<l>To see what you're puttin' down



</l>
<l>You know you told me that you loved me

</l>
<l>You know you told me and I hope it's true

</l>
<l>Well I'll be around, yes I'll be around

</l>
<l>To see what you're puttin' down



</l>
<l>You know I called you in the morning

</l>
<l>You know I called you darling to come back to the Wolf

</l>
<l>But I'll be around, yes I'll be around

</l>
<l>To see what you're puttin' down



</l>
<l>You know I loved you for myself

</l>
<l>You know I love you, I don't love nobody else

</l>
<l>Well, I'll be around, I'll be around

</l>
<l>I don't want you runnin' around</l></lyrics></xml>
