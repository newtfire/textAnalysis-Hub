<lyrics>



Well I'll be around to see ya baby

Well I'll be around no matter what you say

I'll be around, yes I'll be around

To see what you're puttin' down



You know you told me that you loved me

You know you told me and I hope it's true

Well I'll be around, yes I'll be around

To see what you're puttin' down



You know I called you in the morning

You know I called you darling to come back to the Wolf

But I'll be around, yes I'll be around

To see what you're puttin' down



You know I loved you for myself

You know I love you, I don't love nobody else

Well, I'll be around, I'll be around

I don't want you runnin' around
