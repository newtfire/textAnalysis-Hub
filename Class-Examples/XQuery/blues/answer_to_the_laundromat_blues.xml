<lyrics>



(Spoken:

This number's bein' especially played

And dedicated to all of the women

From all of the men)



You see you women have a good thing goin'

But we hip to ya now



You take two or three pieces

And go down to the laundromat

An' take ya eight hours to wash 'em

No good!



We gonna buy ya washers and dryers

And we're gonna put ya at home in the basement

And we gonna kick the door down that goes to the basement

While we can hear the washer when it stop



And baby, baby, baby, when that washer stop

You better be though

Or you better have a darn good explanation!



Don't you go get whupped all on the toenails

We're gonna raise your eye lashes and whup ya some

And if ya run fast enough

We're gonna whup ya on the bottom of the feet

Ain't that right men?

Speak up for yourself! (yeah, yeah)



There will be no more goin' to the laundromat

Puttin' your clothes in there

And gettin' your girlfriend keep her eye on it

While you step out the back door



You better take my advise

You might need it on your vacation this summer

I'd hate to see ya come up with a leg screwed off

Or a eye punched out

Yeah!



Whoa! yeah, yeah!



I know you don't know it babe (yeah, yeah, yeah)

But things look bad for you

Hey, I know you don't know it babe

But I'm gonna keep a close eye on you



Well, ev'ry time you go to the laundromat, baby

I want you to know, I want you to know

That I'll be there too!
