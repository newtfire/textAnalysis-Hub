<l>(Spoken:

</l>
<l>This number's bein' especially played

</l>
<l>And dedicated to all of the women

</l>
<l>From all of the men)



</l>
<l>You see you women have a good thing goin'

</l>
<l>But we hip to ya now



</l>
<l>You take two or three pieces

</l>
<l>And go down to the laundromat

</l>
<l>An' take ya eight hours to wash 'em

</l>
<l>No good!



</l>
<l>We gonna buy ya washers and dryers

</l>
<l>And we're gonna put ya at home in the basement

</l>
<l>And we gonna kick the door down that goes to the basement

</l>
<l>While we can hear the washer when it stop



</l>
<l>And baby, baby, baby, when that washer stop

</l>
<l>You better be though

</l>
<l>Or you better have a darn good explanation!



</l>
<l>Don't you go get whupped all on the toenails

</l>
<l>We're gonna raise your eye lashes and whup ya some

</l>
<l>And if ya run fast enough

</l>
<l>We're gonna whup ya on the bottom of the feet

</l>
<l>Ain't that right men?

</l>
<l>Speak up for yourself! (yeah, yeah)



</l>
<l>There will be no more goin' to the laundromat

</l>
<l>Puttin' your clothes in there

</l>
<l>And gettin' your girlfriend keep her eye on it

</l>
<l>While you step out the back door



</l>
<l>You better take my advise

</l>
<l>You might need it on your vacation this summer

</l>
<l>I'd hate to see ya come up with a leg screwed off

</l>
<l>Or a eye punched out

</l>
<l>Yeah!



</l>
<l>Whoa! yeah, yeah!



</l>
<l>I know you don't know it babe (yeah, yeah, yeah)

</l>
<l>But things look bad for you

</l>
<l>Hey, I know you don't know it babe

</l>
<l>But I'm gonna keep a close eye on you



</l>
<l>Well, ev'ry time you go to the laundromat, baby

</l>
<l>I want you to know, I want you to know

</l><l>That I'll be there too!</l></lyrics></xml>
