<l>I wonder why, why my baby won't treat me right

</l>
<l>I wonder why, why my baby won't treat me right

</l>
<l>She go off every day and she won't come home 'till night



</l>
<l>"I'll be home" well, last week that's what she said

</l>
<l>"I'll be home" well, last week that's what she said

</l>
<l>She don't care if I don't eat

</l>
<l>'Cause she don't know how the rent is paid



</l>
<l>She's a gamblin' woman, she chases men in between

</l>
<l>She's a gamblin' girl, she chases men in between

</l>
<l>She mistreats me and she cheats me

</l>
<l>Meanest woman I ever seen



</l>
<l>The kid's in bed, I lay awake 'till broad daylight

</l>
<l>The kid's in bed, I lay awake 'till broad daylight

</l><l>Every now and then I wonder will my baby be home tonight</l></lyrics></xml>
