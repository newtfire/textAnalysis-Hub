<lyrics>



I wonder why, why my baby won't treat me right

I wonder why, why my baby won't treat me right

She go off every day and she won't come home 'till night



"I'll be home" well, last week that's what she said

"I'll be home" well, last week that's what she said

She don't care if I don't eat

'Cause she don't know how the rent is paid



She's a gamblin' woman, she chases men in between

She's a gamblin' girl, she chases men in between

She mistreats me and she cheats me

Meanest woman I ever seen



The kid's in bed, I lay awake 'till broad daylight

The kid's in bed, I lay awake 'till broad daylight

Every now and then I wonder will my baby be home tonight
