<lyrics>


<l>Sittin' down by my window, just lookin' out at the rain, at the
rain

</l>
<l>I said I'm sittin' down by my window, just lookin' out at the
rain

</l>
<l>You know somethin' came along, grabbed a hold of me, felt just like a

ball and chain




</l>
<l>And I say, oh, oh, oh, hon', why does every thing go wrong? It all
goes wrong

</l>
<l>And I say, oh, now tell me why, does every thing go wrong, all
wrong

</l>
<l>Say, here you gone today, an' I wanted to love you, for so long



</l>
<l>Love's got a hold on me, baby, feels just like a ball and chain, hmm
hmm hmm

</l>
<l>Oh, love's got a hold on me, baby, feels just like a ball and
chain

</l>
<l>And I don't know why the man I'm lovin', wanna leave me in so much

pain




</l>
<l>And I say, oh oh oh, hon', tell me why, tell me why, tell me why, oh
tell me why, why, why

</l>
<l>And I say, oh, honey why, why, oh why, tell me why, I thought our
love would last

</l>
<l>Honey, gonna last, last, till the day I die



</l>
<l>And I say oh, whoa, whoa, hon', it ain't fair, it ain't fair what you
can do, what you can do, Lord

</l>
<l>And I say oh whoa, Lord, it ain't fair, it ain't fair what you can
do, Lord, you can do

</l>
<l>Oh suddenly you broke my heart, oh when I was givin' my love to

you




</l>
<l>Sittin' down by my window, just lookin' out at the rain

</l>
<l>I said I'm sittin' down by my window, just lookin' out at the
rain

</l>
<l>Somethin' came along, grabbed a hold of me, felt just like a ball and

chain




</l>
<l>And I say oh, hon this can't be, this can't be all in vain, no, no,
no

</l>
<l>And I say whoa, whoa, this can't be, honey, it can't be all in
vain

</l><l>Hope there is someone that could tell me, hon', tell me why love is</l>
<l>like a ball and chain</l></lyrics></xml>
