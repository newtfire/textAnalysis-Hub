<lyrics>



I'm gonna get up in the morning, I believe I'll dust my broom

I'm gonna get up in the morning, I believe I'll dust my broom

Well my best gal I'll be leaving, so my friend, get out my room



I'm gonna write a letter to China, see if my baby's over there

I'm gonna write a letter to China, see if my baby's over there

If she ain't up in the Hawaiian Islands, must be in Ethiopia
somewhere



I believe believe my time alone

I believe believe my time alone

I've had to quit my baby and give up my happy home
