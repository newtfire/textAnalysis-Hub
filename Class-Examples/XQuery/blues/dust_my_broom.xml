<lyrics>


<l>I'm gonna get up in the morning, I believe I'll dust my broom

</l>
<l>I'm gonna get up in the morning, I believe I'll dust my broom

</l>
<l>Well my best gal I'll be leaving, so my friend, get out my room



</l>
<l>I'm gonna write a letter to China, see if my baby's over there

</l>
<l>I'm gonna write a letter to China, see if my baby's over there

</l>
<l>If she ain't up in the Hawaiian Islands, must be in Ethiopia

somewhere




</l>
<l>I believe believe my time alone

</l>
<l>I believe believe my time alone

</l>
<l>I've had to quit my baby and give up my happy home</l></lyrics></xml>
