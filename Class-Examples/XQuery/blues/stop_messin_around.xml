<lyrics>


<l>Oh, baby please stop messin' around. you're messin' around with my
heart

</l>
<l>Baby please stop messin' around, you're messin' around with my
heart

</l>
<l>And if you don't stop messin' baby, pretty soon we're gonna have to

part




</l>
<l>Oh, baby please stop messin' around, you're messin' around all the
time

</l>
<l>Baby please stop messin' around, you're messin' around all the
time

</l>
<l>And if you don't stop messin' baby, you're gonna be someone else's

baby, not mine




</l>
<l>Squeeze me baby till my face turn cherry red, roll me so hard, I'll
fall right out of bed

</l>
<l>Please stop messin' around, you're messin around all the time

</l>
<l>If you don't stop messin' baby, you're gonna be someone else's baby,

not mine




</l>
<l>Squeeze me baby till my face turn cherry red, roll me so hard, I'm
gonna fall right out of bed

</l>
<l>Please stop messin' around, you're messin around all the time

</l>
<l>If you don't stop messin' baby, you're gonna be someone else's baby,
not mine

</l>
<l>Yeah!</l></lyrics></xml>
