<lyrics>



Oh, baby please stop messin' around. you're messin' around with my
heart

Baby please stop messin' around, you're messin' around with my
heart

And if you don't stop messin' baby, pretty soon we're gonna have to
part



Oh, baby please stop messin' around, you're messin' around all the
time

Baby please stop messin' around, you're messin' around all the
time

And if you don't stop messin' baby, you're gonna be someone else's
baby, not mine



Squeeze me baby till my face turn cherry red, roll me so hard, I'll
fall right out of bed

Please stop messin' around, you're messin around all the time

If you don't stop messin' baby, you're gonna be someone else's baby,
not mine



Squeeze me baby till my face turn cherry red, roll me so hard, I'm
gonna fall right out of bed

Please stop messin' around, you're messin around all the time

If you don't stop messin' baby, you're gonna be someone else's baby,
not mine

Yeah!
