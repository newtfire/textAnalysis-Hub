<lyrics>





Well maybe in the mornin', I don't know

Baby don't know, just how soon

But I'm leavin' you

Woman I've got to put you down

Well if you can't treat me right

Ain't no use for me hangin' around



Well you told me that you love me

You cross your heart to die

But I found out that wasn't so

I'm leavin' you

Woman I got to put you down

Girl if you can't treat me right

Ain't no use for me hangin' around



Well early in the mornin' before I rise

You lay that role in your bloodshot eyes

You's a mean little thing, meanest woman I ever seen

No matter how I try to treat you right

Still you's a mean little thing



Well you told me that you love me

You cross your heart to die

But I found out, baby, bye bye

I'm leavin'

Woman I got to put you down

Well if you can't treat me right

Ain't no use for me hangin' around



Well early in the morning before I rise

You lay that role in your bloodshot eyes

You's a mean little thing

Mean little thing as you can be

Well if you can't treat me right

Still you's a mean little thing



I'm leavin'

I'm leavin'

I'm leavin'

I'm leavin'
