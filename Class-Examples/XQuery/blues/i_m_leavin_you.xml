<lyrics>


<l>Well maybe in the mornin', I don't know

</l>
<l>Baby don't know, just how soon

</l>
<l>But I'm leavin' you

</l>
<l>Woman I've got to put you down

</l>
<l>Well if you can't treat me right

</l>
<l>Ain't no use for me hangin' around



</l>
<l>Well you told me that you love me

</l>
<l>You cross your heart to die

</l>
<l>But I found out that wasn't so

</l>
<l>I'm leavin' you

</l>
<l>Woman I got to put you down

</l>
<l>Girl if you can't treat me right

</l>
<l>Ain't no use for me hangin' around



</l>
<l>Well early in the mornin' before I rise

</l>
<l>You lay that role in your bloodshot eyes

</l>
<l>You's a mean little thing, meanest woman I ever seen

</l>
<l>No matter how I try to treat you right

</l>
<l>Still you's a mean little thing



</l>
<l>Well you told me that you love me

</l>
<l>You cross your heart to die

</l>
<l>But I found out, baby, bye bye

</l>
<l>I'm leavin'

</l>
<l>Woman I got to put you down

</l>
<l>Well if you can't treat me right

</l>
<l>Ain't no use for me hangin' around



</l>
<l>Well early in the morning before I rise

</l>
<l>You lay that role in your bloodshot eyes

</l>
<l>You's a mean little thing

</l>
<l>Mean little thing as you can be

</l>
<l>Well if you can't treat me right

</l>
<l>Still you's a mean little thing



</l>
<l>I'm leavin'

</l>
<l>I'm leavin'

</l>
<l>I'm leavin'

</l>
<l>I'm leavin'</l></lyrics></xml>
