<lyrics>


<l>Got to have you baby, don't you say that you don't care

</l>
<l>Got to have you baby, don't you say that you don't care

</l>
<l>Any way you want it baby, I'll settle for a back door love affair



</l>
<l>I call you on the telephone, the party says that you ain't there

</l>
<l>I call you on the telephone, the party says that you ain't there

</l><l>When a man asked who's callin', I said, "Just tell 'em it's a back</l>
<l>door love affair"</l></lyrics></xml>
