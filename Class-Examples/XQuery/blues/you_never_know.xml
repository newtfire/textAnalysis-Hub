<lyrics>



Yeah, you never know how you hurt me, baby, how bad I feel inside

Oh, you never know how you hurt me, woman, how bad I feel inside

I believed you when you said you loved me, oh, but I know you
lied



Oh, when I lay down in darkness, I keep hearin' your sweet voice

When I lay down in darkness, baby, I keep hearin' your sweet
voice

And I remember your church, woman, oh, and how I rejoice



I know the people are talkin', baby, but I don't care what they
say

I realize that people talkin', baby, but I don't care what they
say

I know I still love you, woman, and I want you home to stay



Yeah, if you ever change your mind, woman, won't you please come on
home

Oh, if you ever change your mind, baby, won't you please come on
home

Yes, I'm not good without you, baby and you're not good to me
gone
