<l>Yeah, you never know how you hurt me, baby, how bad I feel inside

<l>Oh, you never know how you hurt me, woman, how bad I feel inside

</l>
<l>I believed you when you said you loved me, oh, but I know you

lied




</l>
<l>Oh, when I lay down in darkness, I keep hearin' your sweet voice

</l>
<l>When I lay down in darkness, baby, I keep hearin' your sweet
voice

</l>
<l>And I remember your church, woman, oh, and how I rejoice



</l>
<l>I know the people are talkin', baby, but I don't care what they
say

</l>
<l>I realize that people talkin', baby, but I don't care what they
say

</l>
<l>I know I still love you, woman, and I want you home to stay



</l>
<l>Yeah, if you ever change your mind, woman, won't you please come on
home

home
