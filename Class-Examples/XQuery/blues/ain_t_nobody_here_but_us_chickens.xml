<lyrics>



One night farmer Brown was takin' the air

Locked up the barnyard with the greatest of care

Down in the hen house something stirred

When he shouted, "Who's there?"

This is what he heard



There ain't nobody here but us chickens

There ain't nobody here at all

So calm yourself and stop that fuss

There ain't nobody here but us

We chickens tryin' to sleep and you butt in

And hobble, hobble, hobble, hobble, with your chin

There ain't nobody here but us chickens

There ain't nobody here at all

You're stompin' around and shakin' the ground

Kicking up an awful dust

We chickens tryin' to sleep and you butt in

And hobble, hobble, hobble, hobble, it's a sin



Tomorrow is a busy day

We got things to do, we got eggs to lay

We got ground to dig and worms to scratch

It takes a lot of sittin', gettin' chicks to hatch

Oh, there ain't nobody here but us chickens

There ain't nobody here at all

So quiet yourself and stop that fuss

There ain't nobody here but us

Kindly point the gun the other way

And hobble, hobble, hobble, hobble off and hit the hay



Tomorrow is a busy day

We got things to do, we got eggs to lay

We got ground to dig and worms to scratch

It takes a lot of sittin', gettin' chicks to hatch

Oh, there ain't nobody here but us chickens

There ain't nobody here at all

So quiet yourself and stop that fuss

There ain't nobody here but us

Kindly point the gun the other way

And hobble, hobble, hobble, hobble off and hit the hay



Hey, hey boss man, what do you say?

It's easy, pickin's, there ain't nobody here but us chickens
