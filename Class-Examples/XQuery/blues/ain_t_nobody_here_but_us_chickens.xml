<lyrics>


<l>One night farmer Brown was takin' the air

</l>
<l>Locked up the barnyard with the greatest of care

</l>
<l>Down in the hen house something stirred

</l>
<l>When he shouted, "Who's there?"

</l>
<l>This is what he heard



</l>
<l>There ain't nobody here but us chickens

</l>
<l>There ain't nobody here at all

</l>
<l>So calm yourself and stop that fuss

</l>
<l>There ain't nobody here but us

</l>
<l>We chickens tryin' to sleep and you butt in

</l>
<l>And hobble, hobble, hobble, hobble, with your chin

</l>
<l>There ain't nobody here but us chickens

</l>
<l>There ain't nobody here at all

</l>
<l>You're stompin' around and shakin' the ground

</l>
<l>Kicking up an awful dust

</l>
<l>We chickens tryin' to sleep and you butt in

</l>
<l>And hobble, hobble, hobble, hobble, it's a sin



</l>
<l>Tomorrow is a busy day

</l>
<l>We got things to do, we got eggs to lay

</l>
<l>We got ground to dig and worms to scratch

</l>
<l>It takes a lot of sittin', gettin' chicks to hatch

</l>
<l>Oh, there ain't nobody here but us chickens

</l>
<l>There ain't nobody here at all

</l>
<l>So quiet yourself and stop that fuss

</l>
<l>There ain't nobody here but us

</l>
<l>Kindly point the gun the other way

</l>
<l>And hobble, hobble, hobble, hobble off and hit the hay



</l>
<l>Tomorrow is a busy day

</l>
<l>We got things to do, we got eggs to lay

</l>
<l>We got ground to dig and worms to scratch

</l>
<l>It takes a lot of sittin', gettin' chicks to hatch

</l>
<l>Oh, there ain't nobody here but us chickens

</l>
<l>There ain't nobody here at all

</l>
<l>So quiet yourself and stop that fuss

</l>
<l>There ain't nobody here but us

</l>
<l>Kindly point the gun the other way

</l>
<l>And hobble, hobble, hobble, hobble off and hit the hay



</l>
<l>Hey, hey boss man, what do you say?

</l>
<l>It's easy, pickin's, there ain't nobody here but us chickens</l></lyrics></xml>
