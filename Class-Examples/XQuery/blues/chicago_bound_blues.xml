<lyrics>

<l>Late last night, I sold away and cried

</l>
<l>Late last night, I sold away and cried

</l>
<l>Had the blues for Chicago, I just can't be satisfied



</l>
<l>Blues on my brain, my tongue refused to talk

</l>
<l>Blues on my brain, my tongue refused to talk

</l>
<l>I was followin' my daddy but my feet refuses to walk



</l>
<l>Mean old fireman, cruel old engineer

</l>
<l>Lord mean old fireman, cruel old engineer

</l>
<l>You took my man and left his mama standing here



</l>

Big red headline, tomorrow Defender news

</l>
<l>"Woman dead down home, these old Chicago blues"

</l>
<l>I said blues
