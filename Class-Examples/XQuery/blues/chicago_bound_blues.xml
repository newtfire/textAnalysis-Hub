<lyrics>



Late last night, I sold away and cried

Late last night, I sold away and cried

Had the blues for Chicago, I just can't be satisfied



Blues on my brain, my tongue refused to talk

Blues on my brain, my tongue refused to talk

I was followin' my daddy but my feet refuses to walk



Mean old fireman, cruel old engineer

Lord mean old fireman, cruel old engineer

You took my man and left his mama standing here



Big red headline, tomorrow Defender
1
 news

Big red headline, tomorrow Defender news

"Woman dead down home, these old Chicago blues"

I said blues
