You may be rich

You may be poor

You may be high

Or you just may be low

But if you fall in love

Oh, and you should lose

A woman don't care

She don't care who she gives the blues



Wo, you may be young

You may be old

Maybe you've heard

Or maybe you've never been told

If you've got a good woman

Oh, try not to misuse

Oh, a woman don't care

She don't care who she gives the blues



She'll make you hot in the winter

Make you cold in the summertime

She'll make you feel young in the spring

And in the fall drive you out of your mind

A woman, don't you hear me callin' you?

Yeah woman, you don't care

Yeah, you don't care who you give the blues



Oh, you may be up

You may be down

You may be short, tall, skinny

Or you just might be round

Oh, don't be too sure of your woman

Thinkin' man, that you can't lose

Oh, remember that a woman don't care

She don't care who she gives the blues
