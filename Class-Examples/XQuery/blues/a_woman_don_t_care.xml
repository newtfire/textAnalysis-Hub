<lyrics>


<l>You may be rich

</l>
<l>You may be poor

</l>
<l>You may be high

</l>
<l>Or you just may be low

</l>
<l>But if you fall in love

</l>
<l>Oh, and you should lose

</l>
<l>A woman don't care

</l>
<l>She don't care who she gives the blues



</l>
<l>Wo, you may be young

</l>
<l>You may be old

</l>
<l>Maybe you've heard

</l>
<l>Or maybe you've never been told

</l>
<l>If you've got a good woman

</l>
<l>Oh, try not to misuse

</l>
<l>Oh, a woman don't care

</l>
<l>She don't care who she gives the blues



</l>
<l>She'll make you hot in the winter

</l>
<l>Make you cold in the summertime

</l>
<l>She'll make you feel young in the spring

</l>
<l>And in the fall drive you out of your mind

</l>
<l>A woman, don't you hear me callin' you?

</l>
<l>Yeah woman, you don't care

</l>
<l>Yeah, you don't care who you give the blues



</l>
<l>Oh, you may be up

</l>
<l>You may be down

</l>
<l>You may be short, tall, skinny

</l>
<l>Or you just might be round

</l>
<l>Oh, don't be too sure of your woman

</l>
<l>Thinkin' man, that you can't lose

</l>
<l>Oh, remember that a woman don't care

</l>
<l>She don't care who she gives the blues</l></lyrics></xml>
