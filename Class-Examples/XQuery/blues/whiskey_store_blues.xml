<lyrics>


<l>I worked all day long

</l>
<l>Out in the cold and snow

</l>
<l>I come home lookin' for my supper

</l>
<l>You're around some whiskey store



</l>
<l>You're just a whiskey drinkin' woman

</l>
<l>We never will get very far

</l>
<l>Because every time I wanna find you

</l>
<l>I just go around some whiskey bar



</l>
<l>I leave house written grocery bill

</l>
<l>At home every week

</l>
<l>And every Monday mornin'

</l>
<l>The landlord puts my clothes out in the street



</l>
<l>Because you're the whiskey drinkin' woman

</l>
<l>We never will get very far

</l>
<l>Well then every time I wanna find you

</l>
<l>You're layin' around some whiskey bar



</l>
<l>You know our friends came around

</l>
<l>To give us a nice time

</l>
<l>You say, "Hurry let's go to the liquor store,

</l>
<l>Before they change their mind"



</l>
<l>Just a whiskey drinkin' woman

</l>
<l>We never will get very far

</l>
<l>Well then every time I wanna find you

</l>
<l>You're layin' around some whiskey bar



</l>
<l>Now so you can pack up baby

</l>
<l>Out for yourself you must go

</l>
<l>I never see you nowhere

</l>
<l>Unless I stop at some whiskey store



</l>
<l>Just a whiskey drinkin' woman

</l>
<l>We never will get very far

</l>
<l>Well then every time I wanna find you

</l>
<l>You're layin' around some whiskey bar</l></lyrics></xml>
