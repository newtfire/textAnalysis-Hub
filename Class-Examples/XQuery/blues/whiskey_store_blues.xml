<lyrics>



I worked all day long

Out in the cold and snow

I come home lookin' for my supper

You're around some whiskey store



You're just a whiskey drinkin' woman

We never will get very far

Because every time I wanna find you

I just go around some whiskey bar



I leave house written grocery bill

At home every week

And every Monday mornin'

The landlord puts my clothes out in the street



Because you're the whiskey drinkin' woman

We never will get very far

Well then every time I wanna find you

You're layin' around some whiskey bar



You know our friends came around

To give us a nice time

You say, "Hurry let's go to the liquor store,

Before they change their mind"



Just a whiskey drinkin' woman

We never will get very far

Well then every time I wanna find you

You're layin' around some whiskey bar



Now so you can pack up baby

Out for yourself you must go

I never see you nowhere

Unless I stop at some whiskey store



Just a whiskey drinkin' woman

We never will get very far

Well then every time I wanna find you

You're layin' around some whiskey bar
