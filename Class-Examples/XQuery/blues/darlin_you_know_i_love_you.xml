<lyrics>


<l>Darlin', darlin' you know I love you,

</l>
<l>I love you, for myself

</l>
<l>But you're gone, gone and left me for someone else



</l>
<l>I think of you, think of you every morning

</l>
<l>I dream of you, every night, and with love,

</l>
<l>love to be with you always



</l>
<l>When night began to fall,

</l>
<l>I cry, cry alone

</l>
<l>And I wish, maybe I can hold you in my arms tonight



</l>
<l>Oh, darlin', darlin' you know I love you,

</l>
<l>I love you, for myself

</l>
<l>But you're gone, gone and left me for someone else</l></lyrics></xml>
