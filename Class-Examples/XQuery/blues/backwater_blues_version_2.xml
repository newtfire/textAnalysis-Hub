<lyrics>



When it rained five days and the skies turned dark as
night

When it rained five days and the skies turned dark as night

There was trouble taking place in the lowlands at night



I woke up this morning, wouldn't even get out of my door

I woke up this morning, wouldn't even get out of my door

Enough trouble to make poor girl wonder where she gonna go



They rowed a little boat, about five miles 'cross the farm

They rowed a little boat, about five miles 'cross the farm

I packed up all my clothing, throwed it in and they rowed me
along



It thundered and it lightened and the winds began to blow

It thundered and it lightened and the winds began to blow

There was a thousand women, didn't have no place to go



I went out to the lonesome, high old lonesome hill

I went out to the lonesome, high old lonesome hill

I looked won on the old house, where I used to live



Backwater
1
 blues have caused me to pack up my things and
go

Backwater blues have caused me to pack up my things and go

'Cause my house fell down and I can't live there no more



Hmm, I can't live there no more

Hmm, I can't live there no more

And there ain't no place for a poor old girl to go



__________

Note: This was one of her most successful records; it was recorded
just before the catastrophic 
great
Mississippi flood of 1927
;

Note 1: backwater, mostly old river beds which are left to take the
excess flood water to relieve pressure on the 
levees

(embankments). As the height of the water is excessive, however,
breaches in the levee walls are deliberately made at certain points
to allow particular areas to flood and thus lessen the pressure of
water. These are the "backwaters," which occur in the St. Francis
Basin to the west of the river between 
Memphis

and Helena, in the great 
Yazoo-Mississippi
Delta
 north of 
Vicksburg
,
in the Tensas Basin west of 
Natchez
,
and at other selected points.
