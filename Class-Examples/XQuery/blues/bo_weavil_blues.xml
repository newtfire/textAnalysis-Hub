<lyrics>



Hey, bo-weavil
1
, don't sing them blues
no more

Hey, hey, bo-weavil, don't sing them blues no more

Bo-weavil's here, bo-weavil's everywhere you'll go



I'm a lone bo-weavil, been out a great long time

I'm a lone bo-weavil, been out a great long time

I'm gonna sing these blues to ease the bo-weavil's lonesome mind



I don't want no man to put no sugar in my tea

I don't want no man to put no sugar in my tea

Some of them's so evil, I'm afraid they might poison me



I went downtown and bought me a hat

I brought it back home, I laid it on the shelf

Looked at my bed, I'm getting tired of sleeping by myself



__________

Note: take 2 on the album;

Note 1: bo or boll weevil or weavil, a grayish weevil, super-family
of beetles, that infests the cotton plant and feeds on the squares
and bolls.
