<l>Hey, bo-weavil

1
, don't sing them blues
no more


</l>
<l>Hey, hey, bo-weavil, don't sing them blues no more

</l>
<l>Bo-weavil's here, bo-weavil's everywhere you'll go



</l>
<l>I'm a lone bo-weavil, been out a great long time

</l>
<l>I'm a lone bo-weavil, been out a great long time

</l>
<l>I'm gonna sing these blues to ease the bo-weavil's lonesome mind



</l>
<l>I don't want no man to put no sugar in my tea

</l>
<l>I don't want no man to put no sugar in my tea

</l>
<l>Some of them's so evil, I'm afraid they might poison me



</l>
<l>I went downtown and bought me a hat

</l>
<l>I brought it back home, I laid it on the shelf

</l>
<l>Looked at my bed, I'm getting tired of sleeping by myself



</l>

<note>Note: take 2 on the album;

and bolls.
