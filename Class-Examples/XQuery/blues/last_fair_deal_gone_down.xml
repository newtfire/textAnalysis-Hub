<l>It's the last fair deal goin' down,

</l>
<l>last fair deal goin' down

</l>
<l>It's the last fair deal goin' down, good Lord,

</l>
<l>on that 

Gulfport Island
Road
1




</l>
<l>Ida Belle, don't you cry this time

</l>
<l>Ida Belle, don't you cry this time

</l>
<l>If you cry about a nickel, you'll die 'bout a dime

</l>
<l>I wouldn't cry, but the money it ain't mine



</l>
<l>My 

captain 
's so mean
on me


</l>
<l>My captain's so mean on me

</l>
<l>My captain's so mean on me, good Lord,

</l>
<l>on that Gulfport Island Road



</l>
<l>Workin' my way back home

</l>
<l>Workin' my way back home

</l>
<l>I'm workin' my way back home, good Lord,

</l>
<l>on that Gulfport Island Road



</l>
<l>It's the last fair deal goin' down, last fair deal goin' down

</l>
<l>It's the last fair deal goin' down, good Lord,

</l>
<l>on that Gulfport Island Road

</l>
<l>On that Gulfport Island Road

</l>
<l>On that Gulfport Island
