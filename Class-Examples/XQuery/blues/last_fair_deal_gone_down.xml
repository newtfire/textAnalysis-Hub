<lyrics>



It's the last fair deal goin' down,

last fair deal goin' down

It's the last fair deal goin' down, good Lord,

on that 
Gulfport Island
Road
1



Ida Belle, don't you cry this time

Ida Belle, don't you cry this time

If you cry about a nickel, you'll die 'bout a dime

I wouldn't cry, but the money it ain't mine



My 
captain 
's so mean
on me

My captain's so mean on me

My captain's so mean on me, good Lord,

on that Gulfport Island Road



Workin' my way back home

Workin' my way back home

I'm workin' my way back home, good Lord,

on that Gulfport Island Road



It's the last fair deal goin' down, last fair deal goin' down

It's the last fair deal goin' down, good Lord,

on that Gulfport Island Road

On that Gulfport Island Road

On that Gulfport Island
