<lyrics>


<l>When I first met you baby, you were a real gone chick

</l>
<l>When I first met you baby, you were a real gone chick

</l>
<l>Now you've let your skirt down 'n you know that ain't the lick



</l>
<l>You better wake up baby n' change your antique ways

</l>
<l>You better wake up baby n' change your antique ways

</l>
<l>Instead of advancin' baby, you're goin back to horse and buggy

days




</l>
<l>You said the style is changin', I don't know why I should laugh or
cry

</l>
<l>You said the style is changin' I don't know if I should laugh or
cry

</l>
<l>You've been wearin' long skirts baby, you don't know the reason

why




</l>
<l>Just leave it up to a woman, they'll do it every time

</l>
<l>Just leave it up to a woman, they'll do it every time

</l>
<l>Well ain't no long skirt baby, gonna be no gal a-mine</l></lyrics></xml>
