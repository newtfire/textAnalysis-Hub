<lyrics>



When I first met you baby, you were a real gone chick

When I first met you baby, you were a real gone chick

Now you've let your skirt down 'n you know that ain't the lick



You better wake up baby n' change your antique ways

You better wake up baby n' change your antique ways

Instead of advancin' baby, you're goin back to horse and buggy
days



You said the style is changin', I don't know why I should laugh or
cry

You said the style is changin' I don't know if I should laugh or
cry

You've been wearin' long skirts baby, you don't know the reason
why



Just leave it up to a woman, they'll do it every time

Just leave it up to a woman, they'll do it every time

Well ain't no long skirt baby, gonna be no gal a-mine
