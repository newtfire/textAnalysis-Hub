<lyrics>


<l>I keep on tryin' to get ahead, I'm doin' the best I can

</l>
<l>But every time I try to pull up

</l>
<l>They pull me right back down again

</l>
<l>You got me down now and I hope you're satisfied

</l>
<l>Oh, it's so hard to to try to keep my head up

</l>
<l>Yes, when you're puttin' pressure on me

</l>
<l>From every side, every side



</l>
<l>Even Uncle Sam say

</l>
<l>I owe a lot of money way back from nineteen fifty six

</l>
<l>Now, how could I owe him anything

</l>
<l>When that whole year I was sick

</l>
<l>They won't let me make my money

</l>
<l>Won't even let me buy my clothes

</l>
<l>Oh, it's so hard to get something to eat

</l>
<l>Yes, and now they want to throw me outdoors

</l>
<l>Throw me outdoors



</l>
<l>Yes, everybody's laughin' at me

</l>
<l>I can see the joy in their eyes

</l>
<l>They're glad because I'm down now

</l>
<l>Just look at the Devils in disguise

</l>
<l>And I have no-one to turn to

</l>
<l>No-one to lend me a helpin' hand

</l>
<l>Oh, I'm tellin' you, shakes has really got me now

</l>
<l>Yes, I'm a lonely, lonely man</l></lyrics></xml>
