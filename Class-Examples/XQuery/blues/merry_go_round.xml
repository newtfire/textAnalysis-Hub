<lyrics>


<l>When I first met you baby, I didn't even know your name

</l>
<l>When I first met you baby, I didn't even know your name

</l>
<l>Oh, I was feelin' low on the ground, bad luck and evil women were to

blame




</l>
<l>I never realized how sweet and kind one woman can be

</l>
<l>I never realized, people, how sweet and kind a woman can be

</l>
<l>Oh, but when I looked in your eyes, I knew true love had come to
me

</l>
<l>Yeah



</l>
<l>Take my hand, hold it tight and don't let go

</l>
<l>Take my hand, take my hand, hold it tight and don't let go

</l><l>'Cause our love is like a merry-go-round, forever and ever round it</l>
<l>goes</l></lyrics></xml>
