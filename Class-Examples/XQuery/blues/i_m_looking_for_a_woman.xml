<lyrics>


<l>I'm looking for a woman, that will work to set me down

</l>
<l>I'm looking for a woman, that will work to set me down

</l>
<l>I've been looking all night long, she can't be found



</l>
<l>Well I met one last night, and I told her what I liked

</l>
<l>Well I met one last night, and I told her what I liked

</l>
<l>She said get away from here country boy, go back to your

countryside




</l>
<l>Well tell me baby, what you see wrong with me

</l>
<l>Well tell me baby, what you see wrong with me

</l>
<l>Well if I had you baby, you wouldn't be lookin' back at me



</l>
<l>Well so long mama, baby bye-bye you bye

</l>
<l>Well so long mama, baby bye-bye you bye

</l>
<l>Well now bye-bye baby, with a tear in your eye</l></lyrics></xml>
