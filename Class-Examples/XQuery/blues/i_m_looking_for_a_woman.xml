<lyrics>



I'm looking for a woman, that will work to set me down

I'm looking for a woman, that will work to set me down

I've been looking all night long, she can't be found



Well I met one last night, and I told her what I liked

Well I met one last night, and I told her what I liked

She said get away from here country boy, go back to your
countryside



Well tell me baby, what you see wrong with me

Well tell me baby, what you see wrong with me

Well if I had you baby, you wouldn't be lookin' back at me



Well so long mama, baby bye-bye you bye

Well so long mama, baby bye-bye you bye

Well now bye-bye baby, with a tear in your eye
