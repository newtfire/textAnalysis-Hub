<lyrics>


<l>My silent prayer is the love we knew

</l>
<l>If it should reach all of the heart of you

</l>
<l>I'll offer the heart you had manage to break

</l>
<l>I'll offer the love that forgave your mistake



</l>
<l>Deep in my heart you still belong to me

</l>
<l>I only know I'll never, never be free

</l>
<l>Please don't consider the love a closed episode

</l>
<l>The love that we knew comes to few

</l>
<l>For my silent love is for you and only for you</l></lyrics></xml>
