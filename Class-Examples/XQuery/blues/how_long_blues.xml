<lyrics>



How long, baby how long,

Has that evenin' train been gone?

How long, baby baby, how long?



Well if I could holler, like a mountain jack

I'd calls from my mountain

Call my baby back

How long, how long, baby how long?



The brook runs in the river

The river runs into the sea

If I don't run into my baby

A train is gonna run into me



How long, how long, baby how long?

Baby, baby, baby, how long?
