<lyrics>



Some folk built like this, some folk built like that

But the way I'm built, you shouldn't call me fat

Because I'm built for comfort, I ain't built for speed

But I got everything all the good girls need



I don't have no diamond, and I don't have no gold

But I've got a lot of lovin' and I want you to know

That I'm built for comfort, I ain't built for speed

But I got everything all the good girls need



Some folk built like this, some folk built like that

But the way I'm built, you shouldn't call me fat

Because I'm built for comfort, I ain't built for speed

But I got everything all the good girls need



Some folk rip and roar, some folk b'lieve in signs

But if you want me, you got to take your time

Because I'm built for comfort, I ain't built for speed

But I got everything all the good girls need



But I got everything all the good girls need

I, I love you baby

I, I love you baby

But I got everything all of the good girls need



And I don't got no diamonds, don't have no gold

Got a lot of lovin' to satisfy your soul

I'm built for comfort, I ain't built for speed

But I got everything all the good girls need
