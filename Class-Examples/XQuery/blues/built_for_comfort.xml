<lyrics>


<l>Some folk built like this, some folk built like that

</l>
<l>But the way I'm built, you shouldn't call me fat

</l>
<l>Because I'm built for comfort, I ain't built for speed

</l>
<l>But I got everything all the good girls need



</l>
<l>I don't have no diamond, and I don't have no gold

</l>
<l>But I've got a lot of lovin' and I want you to know

</l>
<l>That I'm built for comfort, I ain't built for speed

</l>
<l>But I got everything all the good girls need



</l>
<l>Some folk built like this, some folk built like that

</l>
<l>But the way I'm built, you shouldn't call me fat

</l>
<l>Because I'm built for comfort, I ain't built for speed

</l>
<l>But I got everything all the good girls need



</l>
<l>Some folk rip and roar, some folk b'lieve in signs

</l>
<l>But if you want me, you got to take your time

</l>
<l>Because I'm built for comfort, I ain't built for speed

</l>
<l>But I got everything all the good girls need



</l>
<l>But I got everything all the good girls need

</l>
<l>I, I love you baby

</l>
<l>I, I love you baby

</l>
<l>But I got everything all of the good girls need



</l>
<l>And I don't got no diamonds, don't have no gold

</l>
<l>Got a lot of lovin' to satisfy your soul

</l>
<l>I'm built for comfort, I ain't built for speed

</l>
<l>But I got everything all the good girls need</l></lyrics></xml>
