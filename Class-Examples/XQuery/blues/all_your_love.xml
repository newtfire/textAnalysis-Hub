<lyrics>


<l>All the love I miss loving, all the kiss I miss kissing

</l>
<l>All the love I miss loving, all the kiss I miss kissing

</l>
<l>Before I met you baby, never knew what I was missing



</l>
<l>All your love, pretty baby, that I got in store for you

</l>
<l>All your love, pretty baby, that I got in store for you

</l>
<l>I love you pretty baby, well I say you love me too



</l>
<l>All your loving, pretty baby, all your loving, pretty baby

</l>
<l>All your loving, pretty baby, all your loving, pretty baby

</l>
<l>Since I first met you baby, I never knew what I was missing



</l>
<l>Hey, hey baby, hey, hey baby

</l>
<l>Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, baby, oh, oh, baby

</l>
<l>Since I first met you baby, never knew what I was missing</l></lyrics></xml>
