<lyrics>


<l>One summer day, she went away

</l>
<l>She gone and left me, she gone to stay

</l>
<l>But now she's gone, and I can't worry

</l>
<l>Because I'm sittin' on top of the world



</l>
<l>Worked all the summer, worked all the fall

</l>
<l>Had to take Christmas, in my overalls

</l>
<l>But now she's gone, and I don't worry

</l>
<l>Sittin' on top of the world



</l>
<l>Goin' down to the freight yard, catch me a freight train

</l>
<l>I'm gonna leave this town, work done got hard

</l>
<l>But now she's gone, and I don't worry

</l>
<l>Sittin' on top of the world</l></lyrics></xml>
