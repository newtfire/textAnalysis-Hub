<lyrics>



One summer day, she went away

She gone and left me, she gone to stay

But now she's gone, and I can't worry

Because I'm sittin' on top of the world



Worked all the summer, worked all the fall

Had to take Christmas, in my overalls

But now she's gone, and I don't worry

Sittin' on top of the world



Goin' down to the freight yard, catch me a freight train

I'm gonna leave this town, work done got hard

But now she's gone, and I don't worry

Sittin' on top of the world
