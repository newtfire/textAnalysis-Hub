<lyrics>


<l>You're throwing it all away

</l>
<l>Everything we've been living for

</l>
<l>All the promises that were made

</l>
<l>They all have gone and flown away



</l>
<l>You locked me out

</l>
<l>And let your new love come in

</l>
<l>Now you are making it

</l>
<l>With my closest friend

</l>
<l>Fussing and fighting, baby

</l>
<l>Where have you been

</l>
<l>Yeah, I get the message

</l>
<l>That you clearly send



</l>
<l>You're so mean and evil

</l>
<l>You're so mean

</l>
<l>You're so mean and evil

</l>
<l>You're so mean



</l>
<l>I saw you at the place

</l>
<l>Where we used to go

</l>
<l>Showing it off

</l>
<l>With the lights down low

</l>
<l>Telling your lover about eternity

</l>
<l>How soon you forget

</l>
<l>That's what you once told me



</l>
<l>Your sweet talking

</l>
<l>Made me go for it

</l>
<l>Now you've got someone else

</l>
<l>At the top of your list

</l>
<l>Like the wind

</l>
<l>That's blowing free

</l>
<l>Suddenly you've changed

</l>
<l>Turned your back on me



</l>
<l>You're so mean and evil

</l>
<l>You're so mean

</l>
<l>You're so mean and evil

</l>
<l>You're so mean



</l>
<l>Your sweet talking

</l>
<l>Made me go for it

</l>
<l>Now you've got someone else

</l>
<l>At the top of your list

</l>
<l>Like the wind

</l>
<l>That's blowing free

</l>
<l>Suddenly you've changed

</l>
<l>Turned your back on me



</l>
<l>You're so mean and evil

</l>
<l>You're so mean

</l>
<l>You're so mean and evil

</l>
<l>You're so mean</l></lyrics></xml>
