<lyrics>



You're throwing it all away

Everything we've been living for

All the promises that were made

They all have gone and flown away



You locked me out

And let your new love come in

Now you are making it

With my closest friend

Fussing and fighting, baby

Where have you been

Yeah, I get the message

That you clearly send



You're so mean and evil

You're so mean

You're so mean and evil

You're so mean



I saw you at the place

Where we used to go

Showing it off

With the lights down low

Telling your lover about eternity

How soon you forget

That's what you once told me



Your sweet talking

Made me go for it

Now you've got someone else

At the top of your list

Like the wind

That's blowing free

Suddenly you've changed

Turned your back on me



You're so mean and evil

You're so mean

You're so mean and evil

You're so mean



Your sweet talking

Made me go for it

Now you've got someone else

At the top of your list

Like the wind

That's blowing free

Suddenly you've changed

Turned your back on me



You're so mean and evil

You're so mean

You're so mean and evil

You're so mean
