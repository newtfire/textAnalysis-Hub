<lyrics>



My baby came home last night

And she looked at me real cool

She said, "Albert, you ain't nothin' but a overgrown fool,

I'm gonna leave you, gonna leave you behind"

I said, " Baby I'm gonna tell you, that a good fool is hard to
find"



Now, baby if you leave me, it would hurt me to my soul

I just can't understand why baby, any woman could be so cold

But a good fool, a good fool, is hard to find

Take a lesson from me baby, a good fool is hard to find



The last time you left me, I didn't have much to lose

You left me with nothin' woman, but a pair of thin-sole shoe

But a good fool, a good fool is hard to find

Take a lesson from me baby, a good fool is hard to find



Now listen to me baby, I think you should be told

When they made yo' daddy, somebody went an' broke the mold

A good fool, a good fool is hard to find

You take the lesson from me woman, a good fool is hard to find
