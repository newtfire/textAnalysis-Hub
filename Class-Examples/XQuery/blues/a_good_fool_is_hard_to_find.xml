<lyrics>


<l>My baby came home last night

</l>
<l>And she looked at me real cool

</l>
<l>She said, "Albert, you ain't nothin' but a overgrown fool,

</l>
<l>I'm gonna leave you, gonna leave you behind"

</l>
<l>I said, " Baby I'm gonna tell you, that a good fool is hard to

find"




</l>
<l>Now, baby if you leave me, it would hurt me to my soul

</l>
<l>I just can't understand why baby, any woman could be so cold

</l>
<l>But a good fool, a good fool, is hard to find

</l>
<l>Take a lesson from me baby, a good fool is hard to find



</l>
<l>The last time you left me, I didn't have much to lose

</l>
<l>You left me with nothin' woman, but a pair of thin-sole shoe

</l>
<l>But a good fool, a good fool is hard to find

</l>
<l>Take a lesson from me baby, a good fool is hard to find



</l>
<l>Now listen to me baby, I think you should be told

</l>
<l>When they made yo' daddy, somebody went an' broke the mold

</l>
<l>A good fool, a good fool is hard to find

</l>
<l>You take the lesson from me woman, a good fool is hard to find</l></lyrics></xml>
