<lyrics>



Let your hair down, baby, let's have a nat'ural ball

Let your hair down, baby, let's have a nat'ural ball

If you don't let your hair down, woman, we can't have no fun at
all



Oh, and you can't take it wit' you, that's one thing for sure

Oh, and you can't take it wit' you, that's one thing for sure

There ain't nothin' in the world, that a T-Bone shuffle won't
cure



Come here baby, sit down on your daddy's knee

Come here baby, sit down on your daddy's knee

I've got somethin' pretty baby, somethin' that's ailin' me
