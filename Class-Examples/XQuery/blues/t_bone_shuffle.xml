<l>Let your hair down, baby, let's have a nat'ural ball

</l>
<l>Let your hair down, baby, let's have a nat'ural ball

</l>
<l>If you don't let your hair down, woman, we can't have no fun at

all




</l>
<l>Oh, and you can't take it wit' you, that's one thing for sure

</l>
<l>Oh, and you can't take it wit' you, that's one thing for sure

</l>
<l>There ain't nothin' in the world, that a T-Bone shuffle won't

cure




</l>
<l>Come here baby, sit down on your daddy's knee

</l>
<l>Come here baby, sit down on your daddy's knee

</l>
<l>I've got somethin' pretty baby, somethin' that's ailin' me</l></lyrics></xml>
