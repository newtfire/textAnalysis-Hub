<lyrics>


<l>I'm in the wrong business

</l>
<l>I swear I ain't lyin'

</l>
<l>I stay hungry, broke all the time

</l>
<l>I'm gonna send my guitar home

</l>
<l>Leave these blues alone

</l>
<l>I'm in the wrong business

</l>
<l>I ain't lyin'



</l>
<l>Should have been a boxer

</l>
<l>Makin' the movie "Rocky 3"

</l>
<l>I would be a star Like the wrestler Mr. T

</l>
<l>Should've been like Michael Jackson

</l>
<l>When I was the age of five

</l>
<l>But chose this guitar

</l>
<l>Now I'm broke and can't survive



</l>
<l>I'm in the wrong business

</l>
<l>I ain't lyin' 'Cause I stay hungry, broke all the time

</l>
<l>I'm gonna send my guitar home

</l>
<l>Leave these blues alone

</l>
<l>I'm in the wrong business

</l>
<l>I ain't lyin'



</l>
<l>These guitar freaks

</l>
<l>Have made my blood sugar go up

</l>
<l>Be better off

</l>
<l>If I was driving a trailer truck

</l>
<l>Like Boxcar Willie

</l>
<l>I played these blues and made me a bum

</l>
<l>I'm gonna give up this music

</l>
<l>Move back to the farm



</l>
<l>I'm in the wrong business

</l>
<l>I ain't lyin'

</l>
<l>'Cause I stay broke, hungry all the time

</l>
<l>I'm gonna send my guitar home

</l>
<l>Leave these blues alone

</l>
<l>I'm in the wrong business

</l>
<l>I ain't lyin'



</l>
<l>I've played these blues

</l>
<l>Now I'm full up to my neck

</l>
<l>If I keep on playin'

</l>
<l>I tell you I'm gonna do like Johnny Paycheck

</l>
<l>He had a job

</l>
<l>Got money for years

</l>
<l>I'm gonna shelve my guita

</l>
<l>r I ain't got no job to shelve



</l>
<l>I'm in the wrong business

</l>
<l>I ain't lyin'

</l>
<l>Stay broke, hungry all the time

</l>
<l>I'm gonna send my guitar home

</l>
<l>Leave these blues alone

</l>
<l>I'm in the wrong business

</l>
<l>I ain't lyin'



</l>
<l>I'm in the wrong business

</l>
<l>I ain't lyin', folks

</l>
<l>Stay broke, hungry all the time

</l>
<l>I'm gonna send my guitar home

</l>
<l>Leave these blues alone

</l>
<l>I'm in the wrong business

</l>
<l>I ain't lyin'</l></lyrics></xml>
