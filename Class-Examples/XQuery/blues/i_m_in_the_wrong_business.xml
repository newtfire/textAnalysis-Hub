<lyrics>



I'm in the wrong business

I swear I ain't lyin'

I stay hungry, broke all the time

I'm gonna send my guitar home

Leave these blues alone

I'm in the wrong business

I ain't lyin'



Should have been a boxer

Makin' the movie "Rocky 3"

I would be a star Like the wrestler Mr. T

Should've been like Michael Jackson

When I was the age of five

But chose this guitar

Now I'm broke and can't survive



I'm in the wrong business

I ain't lyin' 'Cause I stay hungry, broke all the time

I'm gonna send my guitar home

Leave these blues alone

I'm in the wrong business

I ain't lyin'



These guitar freaks

Have made my blood sugar go up

Be better off

If I was driving a trailer truck

Like Boxcar Willie

I played these blues and made me a bum

I'm gonna give up this music

Move back to the farm



I'm in the wrong business

I ain't lyin'

'Cause I stay broke, hungry all the time

I'm gonna send my guitar home

Leave these blues alone

I'm in the wrong business

I ain't lyin'



I've played these blues

Now I'm full up to my neck

If I keep on playin'

I tell you I'm gonna do like Johnny Paycheck

He had a job

Got money for years

I'm gonna shelve my guita

r I ain't got no job to shelve



I'm in the wrong business

I ain't lyin'

Stay broke, hungry all the time

I'm gonna send my guitar home

Leave these blues alone

I'm in the wrong business

I ain't lyin'



I'm in the wrong business

I ain't lyin', folks

Stay broke, hungry all the time

I'm gonna send my guitar home

Leave these blues alone

I'm in the wrong business

I ain't lyin'
