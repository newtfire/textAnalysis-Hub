<lyrics>



Oh wee, baby I declare you sure look fine

Oho wee, baby I declare you sure look fine

A girl like you has made many a man change his mind



Baby when you walk you know you shake like a willow tree

Baby when you walk you know you shake like a willow tree

A girl like you would just love to make a fool of me



Let me love you baby, let me love you baby

Let me love you little darlin', let me love you baby

Let me love you darlin' 'till your good love drives me crazy



Let me love you baby, let me love you baby

Let me love you little darlin', let me love you baby

Let me love you darlin' 'till your good love drives me crazy
