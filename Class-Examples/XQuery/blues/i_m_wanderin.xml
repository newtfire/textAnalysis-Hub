<lyrics>



I been driftin', like a ship out on the foam

I been driftin', like a ship out on the foam

Well, I ain't got nobody, in the world to care for me



If my baby would only take me back again

Oh, take me back again

'Cause I ain't got nobody to speak a word for me



Hmm, won't you give me one more chance?

Hmm, won't you give me one more chance?

'Cause I ain't got nobody, baby, to speak a word for me

No, but I ain't



I declare I ain't got nobody, babe

Honey chile, to speak a word for me

I, I, babe, I'm a big world for myself

Oh, yeah, honey chile, I'm by myself

I'm way down here, babe

Way, way down here, babe, honey chile, by myself

Hmm, hmm, you know I feel so bad

Honey give me one more chance

I ain't got nobody, babe, speak a word for me, babe

Honey give me one more chance

I ain't got nobody, babe, speak a word for me, babe

I, babe, I, gimme one more chance, gimme one more chance

Hmm, hmm, gimme babe, honey, one more chance

I'm wanderin' babe, just like a ship lost on the foam



Hmm, hmm, you know I'm lost, pretty baby

just like a ship lost out on the foam
