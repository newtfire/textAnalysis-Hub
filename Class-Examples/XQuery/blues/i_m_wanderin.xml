<l>I been driftin', like a ship out on the foam

</l>
<l>I been driftin', like a ship out on the foam

</l>
<l>Well, I ain't got nobody, in the world to care for me



</l>
<l>If my baby would only take me back again

</l>
<l>Oh, take me back again

</l>
<l>'Cause I ain't got nobody to speak a word for me



</l>
<l>Hmm, won't you give me one more chance?

</l>
<l>Hmm, won't you give me one more chance?

</l>
<l>'Cause I ain't got nobody, baby, to speak a word for me

</l>
<l>No, but I ain't



</l>
<l>I declare I ain't got nobody, babe

</l>
<l>Honey chile, to speak a word for me

</l>
<l>I, I, babe, I'm a big world for myself

</l>
<l>Oh, yeah, honey chile, I'm by myself

</l>
<l>I'm way down here, babe

</l>
<l>Way, way down here, babe, honey chile, by myself

</l>
<l>Hmm, hmm, you know I feel so bad

</l>
<l>Honey give me one more chance

</l>
<l>I ain't got nobody, babe, speak a word for me, babe

</l>
<l>Honey give me one more chance

</l>
<l>I ain't got nobody, babe, speak a word for me, babe

</l>
<l>I, babe, I, gimme one more chance, gimme one more chance

</l>
<l>Hmm, hmm, gimme babe, honey, one more chance

</l>
<l>I'm wanderin' babe, just like a ship lost on the foam



</l>
