<lyrics>



My friends, they all told me, man, there's something gonna change
your life

My friends, they all told me, man, there's something gonna change
your life

Gotta have that brown sugar, man it's just gonna change my life

Man, I gotta have that brown sugar, man, it's just gonna make me feel
so right



There's something make me feel good, and it's gonna change my
life

There's something make me feel good, and it's gonna change my
life

I gotta have some of that brown sugar, gotta try it before I die



Man it sure do save me when there's no place left for me

Man it sure do save me when there's no place left for me

Gotta have some of that brown sugar as long as that's gonna set me
free



Man, there's somethin' make me feel good and it's gonna change my
life

Man, there's somethin' make me feel good and it's gonna change my
life

I gotta have some of that brown sugar, gotta try it before I die
