IV - Long Distance Boogie



<l>Is everybody feelin' good? You makin' us feel good, too!</l>

<l>Now, early this morning I got on that long distance telephone and I
called my mama</l>

<l>I said, "Mama, this is your boy, and I'm way down here in New
Orleans, Louisiana"</l>

<l>And she said, "That's all right, boy"</l>

<l>And she turned to my papa and she said, "Papa, our boy's way down
there in New Orleans</l>

<l>We cannot let him stay out all night long"</l>

<l>She did!</l>

<l>Long about that time, I heard my papa lean toward my mama</l>

<l>I heard papa tell mama, "Let that boy boogie-woogie"</l>

<l>He said, "It's in him and it's got to come out"</l>


<l>So I went downtown</l>

<l>There's a lot of people there</l>

<l>They was-a really havin' a ball</l>

<l>And I felt so good</l>

<l>Yes, I felt so good</l>

<l>Yes, I felt so good</l>

<l>Yes, I felt so good</l>

<l>Yes, I felt so good</l>

<l>Yes, I felt so good</l>

<l>Yes, I felt so good</l>


<l>Boogie, children!</l>
