<lyrics>


<l>I'm gonna tell you just the way I feel

</l>
<l>No use in waiting around

</l>
<l>I've got this feeling that it might be real,

</l>
<l>and that's just from the sound



</l>
<l>Oh my heart when I heard you laugh,

</l>
<l>and when I saw that smile

</l>
<l>You made me feel like I was alive again

</l>
<l>I hadn't felt that in a while



</l>
<l>But I don't want to waste your time

</l>
<l>'Cause if I'm not the right girl or,

</l>
<l>it's not the right time for you

</l>
<l>Here's what I'm gonna do

</l>
<l>I'll send this song out to you

</l>
<l>Oh, then it's up to you



</l>
<l>Now don't you worry that you'll break my heart

</l>
<l>Don't make no difference to me

</l>
<l>I've had it happen once or twice before

</l>
<l>Won't need no sympathy



</l>
<l>I'll probably find something to keep my mind very occupied

</l>
<l>I think I'll read some book on my list,

</l>
<l>or take a long walk outside

</l>
<l>But I don't want to waste your time

</l>
<l>'Cause if I'm not the right girl or,

</l>
<l>it's not the right time for you

</l>
<l>Here's what I'm gonna do,

</l>
<l>I'll send this song out to you

</l>
<l>Oh, then it's up to you



</l>
<l>Oh, it's up to you baby, it's up to you baby

</l>
<l>Oh, it's up to you baby, it's up to you baby



</l>
<l>And while I don't want to waste your time

</l>
<l>I just ask that you maybe play it out in your mind

</l>
<l>And if your heart starts talking to you

</l>
<l>Just hear what it's saying 'cause

</l>
<l>It might be telling you what to do



</l>
<l>Oh, it's up to you baby, it's up to you baby

</l><l>Oh, it's up to you baby, it's up to you baby</l></lyrics></xml>
