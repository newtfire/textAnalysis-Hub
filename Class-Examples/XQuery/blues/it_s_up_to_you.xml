<lyrics>



I'm gonna tell you just the way I feel

No use in waiting around

I've got this feeling that it might be real,

and that's just from the sound



Oh my heart when I heard you laugh,

and when I saw that smile

You made me feel like I was alive again

I hadn't felt that in a while



But I don't want to waste your time

'Cause if I'm not the right girl or,

it's not the right time for you

Here's what I'm gonna do

I'll send this song out to you

Oh, then it's up to you



Now don't you worry that you'll break my heart

Don't make no difference to me

I've had it happen once or twice before

Won't need no sympathy



I'll probably find something to keep my mind very occupied

I think I'll read some book on my list,

or take a long walk outside

But I don't want to waste your time

'Cause if I'm not the right girl or,

it's not the right time for you

Here's what I'm gonna do,

I'll send this song out to you

Oh, then it's up to you



Oh, it's up to you baby, it's up to you baby

Oh, it's up to you baby, it's up to you baby



And while I don't want to waste your time

I just ask that you maybe play it out in your mind

And if your heart starts talking to you

Just hear what it's saying 'cause

It might be telling you what to do



Oh, it's up to you baby, it's up to you baby

Oh, it's up to you baby, it's up to you baby
