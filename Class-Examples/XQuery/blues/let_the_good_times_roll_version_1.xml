<lyrics>


<l>Hey everybody, let's have some fun

</l>
<l>You only live for once and when you're dead you're done

</l>
<l>So let the good times roll, let the good times roll

</l>
<l>And live a long long

</l>
<l>I don't care if you are young or old no no, get together and let the

good times roll




</l>
<l>Don't stand there moaning, talking trash

</l>
<l>If you wanna have some fun, you'd better go out and spend some
cash

</l>
<l>And let the good time roll

</l>
<l>Let the good time roll

</l>
<l>I don't care if you young or old, get together and let the good times

roll




</l>
<l>Don't stand there moaning, talking trash

</l>
<l>If you wanna have some fun, you'd better go out and spend some
cash

</l>
<l>And let the good time roll

</l>
<l>Let the good time roll

</l>
<l>I don't care if you young or old, get together and let the good times

roll




</l>
<l>Hey mister landlord, lock up all the doors

</l>
<l>When the police comes around, tell them Johnny's coming down

</l>
<l>Let the good times roll

</l>
<l>Let the good times roll

</l>
<l>And Lord I don't care if you young or old,

</l>
<l>That's good enough to let the good times roll



</l>
<l>Hey everybody!

</l>
<l>Tell everybody !

</l>
<l>That B.B. and Bobby's in town

</l>
<l>I got a dollar and a quarter

</l>
<l>And I'm just raring to clown

</l>
<l>Don't let nobody play me cheap

</l>
<l>I got fifty cents to know that I'm gonna keep

</l>
<l>Let the good times roll

</l>
<l>I don't care if you young or old

</l>
<l>Let's get together and let the good times roll</l></lyrics></xml>
