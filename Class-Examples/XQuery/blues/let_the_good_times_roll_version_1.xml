<lyrics>



Hey everybody, let's have some fun

You only live for once and when you're dead you're done

So let the good times roll, let the good times roll

And live a long long

I don't care if you are young or old no no, get together and let the
good times roll



Don't stand there moaning, talking trash

If you wanna have some fun, you'd better go out and spend some
cash

And let the good time roll

Let the good time roll

I don't care if you young or old, get together and let the good times
roll



Don't stand there moaning, talking trash

If you wanna have some fun, you'd better go out and spend some
cash

And let the good time roll

Let the good time roll

I don't care if you young or old, get together and let the good times
roll



Hey mister landlord, lock up all the doors

When the police comes around, tell them Johnny's coming down

Let the good times roll

Let the good times roll

And Lord I don't care if you young or old,

That's good enough to let the good times roll



Hey everybody!

Tell everybody !

That B.B. and Bobby's in town

I got a dollar and a quarter

And I'm just raring to clown

Don't let nobody play me cheap

I got fifty cents to know that I'm gonna keep

Let the good times roll

I don't care if you young or old

Let's get together and let the good times roll
