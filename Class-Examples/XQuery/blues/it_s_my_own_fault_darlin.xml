<lyrics>


<l>It's my own fault darlin', that you treat me the way you
do

</l>
<l>It's my own fault darlin', caused you treat me the way you do

</l>
<l>When you left me darlin', I was callin' from town to town



</l>
<l>Ooh, won't you give me one more chance

</l>
<l>Ooh baby, won't you give me one more chance

</l>
<l>Baby, I'll prove that I'm in love with you, you know I'll be

travelin' no more




</l>
<l>It's my own fault darlin', I made you treat me the way you do

</l>
<l>It's my own fault darlin', I made you treat me the way you do

</l>
<l>Baby I go alone, I just realized, all I did



</l>
<l>Oh goodbye baby, I know we may never meet again

</l>
<l>Oh goodbye baby, I know we may never meet again

</l><l>But it's my own fault darlin', I made you treat me the way you</l>
<l>did</l></lyrics></xml>
