<lyrics>



Oh pretty woman she's the rising sun

Says all your cheap paint and powder ain't gonna help you none

She's a pretty woman right down to the bone

So you just might as well still leave your skin alone



Pretty woman

What's the matter with you

Can't make you love me, no matter what I do



Oh pretty woman what you trying to do

You kept on foolin' around till I got stuck on you

So you just drop that mess and come down off your throne

Stop using my poor heart as a stepping stone



Pretty woman

What's the matter with you

Can't make you love me, no matter what I do



Oh pretty woman that's all right for you

Now you just go on doing what you want to do

But someday when you thing you've got it made

You get in water deep enough so you can't wade



Pretty woman

What's the matter with you

Can't make you love me, no matter what I do
