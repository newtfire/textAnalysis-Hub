<lyrics>


<l>Oh pretty woman she's the rising sun

</l>
<l>Says all your cheap paint and powder ain't gonna help you none

</l>
<l>She's a pretty woman right down to the bone

</l>
<l>So you just might as well still leave your skin alone



</l>
<l>Pretty woman

</l>
<l>What's the matter with you

</l>
<l>Can't make you love me, no matter what I do



</l>
<l>Oh pretty woman what you trying to do

</l>
<l>You kept on foolin' around till I got stuck on you

</l>
<l>So you just drop that mess and come down off your throne

</l>
<l>Stop using my poor heart as a stepping stone



</l>
<l>Pretty woman

</l>
<l>What's the matter with you

</l>
<l>Can't make you love me, no matter what I do



</l>
<l>Oh pretty woman that's all right for you

</l>
<l>Now you just go on doing what you want to do

</l>
<l>But someday when you thing you've got it made

</l>
<l>You get in water deep enough so you can't wade



</l>
<l>Pretty woman

</l>
<l>What's the matter with you

</l>
<l>Can't make you love me, no matter what I do</l></lyrics></xml>
