<lyrics>



Lord, I woke early this morning, Lord, I was laid down on my
floor

You know, woke early this morning, I was laid down on my floor

Lord, no one to love me, no one to love me, baby, even no place to
go



Lord, when you get home, baby, sit down and write me a few of your
lines

Lord, when you get home, baby, sit down and write me a few of your
lines

Lord, that'll be..., Lord, mama, turn my worryin' mind



Lord, sometime I wonder, baby, what's gonna come of me

Lord, sometime I wonder, baby, what's gonna come of me
