<lyrics>


<l>Lord, I woke early this morning, Lord, I was laid down on my
floor

</l>
<l>You know, woke early this morning, I was laid down on my floor

</l>
<l>Lord, no one to love me, no one to love me, baby, even no place to

go




</l>
<l>Lord, when you get home, baby, sit down and write me a few of your
lines

</l>
<l>Lord, when you get home, baby, sit down and write me a few of your
lines

</l>
<l>Lord, that'll be..., Lord, mama, turn my worryin' mind



</l>
<l>Lord, sometime I wonder, baby, what's gonna come of me
