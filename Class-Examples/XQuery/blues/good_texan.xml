<lyrics>



Say things to me like a cowgirl would,

I'll do tricks for you like a cowboy should

You look romantic layin' in the hay,

I need you tonight in a new kind-a way

When you look at me with those eyes,

it makes me start to fantasize



Do it to me like I know you could,

so I can do it to you baby like a Texan should



Ridin' the range I think of you,

I dig your chili you know it's true

Make big money put it in the bank,

that longhorn caddy got a great big tank



Do it to me like I know you could,

so I can do it to you baby like a Texan should



Well you're the kind-a woman who's above the rest,

well nothing for me but the best

You say you need a fella who really can,

do it to you good like a Texan man



Massive wardrobe of cowboy clothes,

top of my head to the tip of my toes

Ah, you look so good in my hat with fringe on it,

so put on my boots hmmm doggone it



Do it to me like I know you could,

I do it to you like a Texan should

Do it to me baby like I know you could,

so I can do it to you baby like a good Texan should
