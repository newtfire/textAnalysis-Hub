<lyrics>


<l>Say things to me like a cowgirl would,

</l>
<l>I'll do tricks for you like a cowboy should

</l>
<l>You look romantic layin' in the hay,

</l>
<l>I need you tonight in a new kind-a way

</l>
<l>When you look at me with those eyes,

</l>
<l>it makes me start to fantasize



</l>
<l>Do it to me like I know you could,

</l>
<l>so I can do it to you baby like a Texan should



</l>
<l>Ridin' the range I think of you,

</l>
<l>I dig your chili you know it's true

</l>
<l>Make big money put it in the bank,

</l>
<l>that longhorn caddy got a great big tank



</l>
<l>Do it to me like I know you could,

</l>
<l>so I can do it to you baby like a Texan should



</l>
<l>Well you're the kind-a woman who's above the rest,

</l>
<l>well nothing for me but the best

</l>
<l>You say you need a fella who really can,

</l>
<l>do it to you good like a Texan man



</l>
<l>Massive wardrobe of cowboy clothes,

</l>
<l>top of my head to the tip of my toes

</l>
<l>Ah, you look so good in my hat with fringe on it,

</l>
<l>so put on my boots hmmm doggone it



</l>
<l>Do it to me like I know you could,

</l>
<l>I do it to you like a Texan should

</l>
<l>Do it to me baby like I know you could,

</l>
<l>so I can do it to you baby like a good Texan should
