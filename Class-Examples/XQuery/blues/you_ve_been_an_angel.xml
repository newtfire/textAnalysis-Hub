<lyrics>



I don't mean to hurt you, baby and I'm sorry if I do

I don't really mean to hurt you, woman, and I'm sorry if I do

Why should I make myself miserable baby

Baby, you know I'm human too



Oh, please don't hate me

Because I know we just don't belong

Oh baby, please don't hate me

I know we just don't belong

I found me someone who wants me

Baby, won't you please set me free



I have to admit you've been an angel, baby

And I'm grateful for the wife you've been

Oh, I have to admit you've been an angel, baby

And I'm grateful for the wife you've been

Oh, but now my heart belongs to another

So to hold me baby, is really a sin



I want you to try to forgive me

Babe and please try to understand

I want you to please, please try to forgive me baby

Babe and please try to understand

You know I didn't make myself, woman

And it's not my fault there's somebody else
