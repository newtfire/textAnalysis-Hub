<lyrics>


<l>I don't mean to hurt you, baby and I'm sorry if I do

</l>
<l>I don't really mean to hurt you, woman, and I'm sorry if I do

</l>
<l>Why should I make myself miserable baby

</l>
<l>Baby, you know I'm human too



</l>
<l>Oh, please don't hate me

</l>
<l>Because I know we just don't belong

</l>
<l>Oh baby, please don't hate me

</l>
<l>I know we just don't belong

</l>
<l>I found me someone who wants me

</l>
<l>Baby, won't you please set me free



</l>
<l>I have to admit you've been an angel, baby

</l>
<l>And I'm grateful for the wife you've been

</l>
<l>Oh, I have to admit you've been an angel, baby

</l>
<l>And I'm grateful for the wife you've been

</l>
<l>Oh, but now my heart belongs to another

</l>
<l>So to hold me baby, is really a sin



</l>
<l>I want you to try to forgive me

</l>
<l>Babe and please try to understand

</l>
<l>I want you to please, please try to forgive me baby

</l>
<l>Babe and please try to understand

</l>
<l>You know I didn't make myself, woman

</l>
<l>And it's not my fault there's somebody else</l></lyrics></xml>
