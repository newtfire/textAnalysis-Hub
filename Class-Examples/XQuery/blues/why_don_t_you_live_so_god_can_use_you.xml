<lyrics>



Why don't you live so, God can use you, anywhere Lord,
anytime

Why don't you live so, God can use you, anywhere, Lord, anytime



Why don't you think so, God can use you, anywhere, any time

Why don't you think so, God can use you, anywhere, Lord, any time



Why don't you walk so, God can use you, anywhere, Lord, any time

Why don't you walk so, God can use you, anywhere, Lord, any time



Why don't you moan so, God can use you, anywhere, Lord, any time

Why don't you moan so, God can use you, anywhere Lord, any time



Why don't you sing so, God can use you, anywhere Lord, any time

Why don't you sing so, God can use you, anywhere Lord
