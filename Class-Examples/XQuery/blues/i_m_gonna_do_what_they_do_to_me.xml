<lyrics>



The next woman I get

She gotta have a job

I'm not tryin' to be no pimp

I just don't intend to work to hard

I won't have to buy the groceries

She gotta pay the rent

She gotta fill up my car every day

And give me account of every dime she spend



I made up my mind

If this is the way life has gotta be

I'm gonna do the same thing

The same thing they been doing to me



She gotta make me think she loves me

By staying in her place

And sleep in another room

So she won't be snorin' in my face

And when I ask her for some money

To go out on the town

I want you to hand it to me smilin'

And don't you have no frown



I made up my mind baby

If this is the way life has gotta be

Yes I'm gonna do the same thing

The same thing they been doing to me



Now when I ask for some money

To go out on the town

I want you to hand it to me smilin'

And don't you be no clown

Now that might sound cold to ya baby

You might think I'm unfair

But I've been hurt so many times

Till I, I really don't care



I made up my mind baby

If this is the way life has gotta be

I'm gonna do the same thing

The same thing they been doing to me
