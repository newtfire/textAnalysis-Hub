<lyrics>


<l>The next woman I get

</l>
<l>She gotta have a job

</l>
<l>I'm not tryin' to be no pimp

</l>
<l>I just don't intend to work to hard

</l>
<l>I won't have to buy the groceries

</l>
<l>She gotta pay the rent

</l>
<l>She gotta fill up my car every day

</l>
<l>And give me account of every dime she spend



</l>
<l>I made up my mind

</l>
<l>If this is the way life has gotta be

</l>
<l>I'm gonna do the same thing

</l>
<l>The same thing they been doing to me



</l>
<l>She gotta make me think she loves me

</l>
<l>By staying in her place

</l>
<l>And sleep in another room

</l>
<l>So she won't be snorin' in my face

</l>
<l>And when I ask her for some money

</l>
<l>To go out on the town

</l>
<l>I want you to hand it to me smilin'

</l>
<l>And don't you have no frown



</l>
<l>I made up my mind baby

</l>
<l>If this is the way life has gotta be

</l>
<l>Yes I'm gonna do the same thing

</l>
<l>The same thing they been doing to me



</l>
<l>Now when I ask for some money

</l>
<l>To go out on the town

</l>
<l>I want you to hand it to me smilin'

</l>
<l>And don't you be no clown

</l>
<l>Now that might sound cold to ya baby

</l>
<l>You might think I'm unfair

</l>
<l>But I've been hurt so many times

</l>
<l>Till I, I really don't care



</l>
<l>I made up my mind baby

</l>
<l>If this is the way life has gotta be

</l>
<l>I'm gonna do the same thing

</l><l>The same thing they been doing to me</l></lyrics></xml>
