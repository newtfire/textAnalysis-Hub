<lyrics>


<l>Well you keep on talkin' bout it

Till you're stone cold blue in the face
But there ain't nothing darling
That true love can't replace


</l>
<l>Ya, you're right, right back

Tryin' to pretend
Ya, you're right back, right back,
Doin' the same old things again


</l>
<l>Well you're money hungry
And your heart is full of greed
Tellin' everybody you get everything you need

</l>
<l>So you say

</l>
<l>You're right, right back
Doin' the same old thing again

</l>
<l>Ya for me it's the same old movie

Same movie just a different scene
Never meaning what you're sayin'
Never sayin' what you mean


</l>
<l>Now you're right, right back

Trying to pretend
Ya I said, you're right, right back
Doin' the same old thing again


</l>
<l>You're money hungry
And you're heart is full of greed
Tellin' everybody you get everything you need

</l>
<l>You know it's a lie

</l>
<l>And now you're right, right back
Tryin' to pretend
Doin' the same old thing again

</l>
<l>Ya you're right, right back

Tryin' to pretend
Ya you're right, right back
Doin' the same old things again


</l>
<l>Ahhhh

</l>
<l>Right back
Right back
Right back

</l><l>Now you're right, right back</l>
<l>Tryin' to pretend</l>
<l>Doin' the same old thing again</l>
<l>Right back, tryin' to pretend</l>
<l>Right back doin' the same old thing again</l>
<l>Right back</l>
<l>Right back</l></lyrics></xml>
