<lyrics>





Well you keep on talkin' bout it
Till you're stone cold blue in the face
But there ain't nothing darling
That true love can't replace

Ya, you're right, right back
Tryin' to pretend
Ya, you're right back, right back,
Doin' the same old things again

Well you're money hungry
And your heart is full of greed
Tellin' everybody you get everything you need

So you say

You're right, right back
Doin' the same old thing again

Ya for me it's the same old movie
Same movie just a different scene
Never meaning what you're sayin'
Never sayin' what you mean

Now you're right, right back
Trying to pretend
Ya I said, you're right, right back
Doin' the same old thing again

You're money hungry
And you're heart is full of greed
Tellin' everybody you get everything you need

You know it's a lie

And now you're right, right back
Tryin' to pretend
Doin' the same old thing again

Ya you're right, right back
Tryin' to pretend
Ya you're right, right back
Doin' the same old things again

Ahhhh

Right back
Right back
Right back

Now you're right, right back
Tryin' to pretend
Doin' the same old thing again
Right back, tryin' to pretend
Right back doin' the same old thing again
Right back
Right back
