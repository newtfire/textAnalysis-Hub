<lyrics>



So much has went unspoken

Along the way

Hearts have healed

And hearts have broken

In the pain of yesterday

Gone are the shadows

They vanished in the Light

Let your heart surrender

Let your soul take flight



(Chorus:)

And let bygones be bygones

And troubles be long gone

And if I never told you

How I feel about you

I'm telling you now



We gather here together

With all of our friends

In a room full of love and laughter

The healing begins

And if this was my last moment

My last breath

I'd wanna be surrounded

With joy and happiness



(Chorus)



And if I never told you

How I feel about you

I'm telling you now
