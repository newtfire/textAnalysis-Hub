Hey boweavil
1
 don't bring them blues no more

Hey boweavil don't bring them blues no more

Boweavil's here, boweavil's everywhere you go



I'm a lone boweavil, been out a great long time

I'm a lone boweavil, been out a great long time

For to sing this song, to ease boweavil's troublin' mind



I don't want no sugar put into my tea

I don't want no sugar put into my tea

The mens are so evil, I'm scared they might poison me



I went downtown

I bought myself a hat

I brought it back home

I laid it on the shelf

I looked in my bedroom

Tired sleepin' by myself

I'm tired sleepin' by myself
