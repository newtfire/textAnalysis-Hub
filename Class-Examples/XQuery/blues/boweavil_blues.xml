<l>Hey boweavil
1
don't bring them blues no more </l>
<l>
Hey boweavil don't bring them blues no more

</l>
<l>Boweavil's here, boweavil's everywhere you go



</l>
<l>I'm a lone boweavil, been out a great long time

</l>
<l>I'm a lone boweavil, been out a great long time

</l>
<l>For to sing this song, to ease boweavil's troublin' mind



</l>
<l>I don't want no sugar put into my tea

</l>
<l>I don't want no sugar put into my tea

</l>
<l>The mens are so evil, I'm scared they might poison me



</l>
<l>I went downtown

</l>
<l>I bought myself a hat

</l>
<l>I brought it back home

</l>
<l>I laid it on the shelf

</l>
<l>I looked in my bedroom

</l>
<l>Tired sleepin' by myself

</l>
<l>I'm tired sleepin' by myself
