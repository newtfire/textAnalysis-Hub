<lyrics>



Old pal, old pal, you stole my man away

Old pal, old pal, you stole my man away

But that's all right, I'll get him back some day



You stole my man, between midnight and day

You stole my man, between midnight and day

Yes, I bet you old pal, I still will make you pay



Why should you have, a daddy of your own

Why should you have, a daddy of your own

Old pal, old pal, you better let my man alone



Now you says, true friends should understand

Old pal, you said, true friends should understand

But that's no sign we should take each other's man
