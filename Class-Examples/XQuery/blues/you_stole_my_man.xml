<lyrics>


<l>Old pal, old pal, you stole my man away

</l>
<l>Old pal, old pal, you stole my man away

</l>
<l>But that's all right, I'll get him back some day



</l>
<l>You stole my man, between midnight and day

</l>
<l>You stole my man, between midnight and day

</l>
<l>Yes, I bet you old pal, I still will make you pay



</l>
<l>Why should you have, a daddy of your own

</l>
<l>Why should you have, a daddy of your own

</l>
<l>Old pal, old pal, you better let my man alone



</l>
<l>Now you says, true friends should understand

</l>
<l>Old pal, you said, true friends should understand

</l>
<l>But that's no sign we should take each other's man</l></lyrics></xml>
