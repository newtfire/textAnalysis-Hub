<l>Hold that train, conductor, please don't let that engineer start

<l>Hold that train, conductor, please don't let that engineer start

</l>
<l>Well, I wanna ride your train this morning, just to ease my achin'

heart




</l>
<l>Yes, for the last few mornings lately, before I get out of my bed

</l>
<l>Yes, for the last few mornings lately, before I get out of my bed

</l>
<l>Well, I hear your whistle moanin' and it almost drives me out of my

head




</l>
<l>I'll pay my fare when we starts rollin', all your money's right here
in my pants

</l>
<l>I'll pay my fare when we starts rollin', all your money's right here
in my pants

</l>
<l>Well, I know I should back and buy a ticket, yes, but I'm afraid to

take the chance




</l>
<l>Oh, don't stop this train, conductor, till this old state is out of
sight

</l>
<l>Yes, don't stop this train, conductor, till Mississippi is out of
sight

</l><l>Well, you know I'm going to California, where I, I know my baby will</l>
<l>treat me right</l></lyrics></xml>
