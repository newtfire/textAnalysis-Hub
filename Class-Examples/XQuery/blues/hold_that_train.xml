<lyrics>



Hold that train, conductor, please don't let that engineer start

Hold that train, conductor, please don't let that engineer start

Well, I wanna ride your train this morning, just to ease my achin'
heart



Yes, for the last few mornings lately, before I get out of my bed

Yes, for the last few mornings lately, before I get out of my bed

Well, I hear your whistle moanin' and it almost drives me out of my
head



I'll pay my fare when we starts rollin', all your money's right here
in my pants

I'll pay my fare when we starts rollin', all your money's right here
in my pants

Well, I know I should back and buy a ticket, yes, but I'm afraid to
take the chance



Oh, don't stop this train, conductor, till this old state is out of
sight

Yes, don't stop this train, conductor, till Mississippi is out of
sight

Well, you know I'm going to California, where I, I know my baby will
treat me right
