<lyrics>


<l>I got a mean red spider, and she been webbin' all over town

</l>
<l>I got a mean red spider, and she been webbin' all over town

</l>
<l>I'm gonna get me a mean black spider, so I can tear her cobweb

down




</l>
<l>I got a break comin', no need for me to moan

</l>
<l>I got a break is sho' comin', no need for me to moan

</l>
<l>That's jus' a mean red spider, she's breakin' up my happy home



</l>
<l>All right stop this stuff man

</l>
<l>Go ahead man



</l>
<l>If I don't go crazy, I will surely lose my mind

</l>
<l>Well you know if I don't go crazy, I will surely lose my mind

</l>
<l>That's jus' a mean red spider, and she jus' bother me all the

time

<note>Note: Muddy's first Chicago recording. He reocrded the song in 1946
for the 20th Century label. The lyrics are based on Robert "Junior"
Lockwood's song "Black Spider Blues". Muddy changed the spider to red
and female. This is the 1948 version for the Aristocrat label.</note></lyrics></xml>
