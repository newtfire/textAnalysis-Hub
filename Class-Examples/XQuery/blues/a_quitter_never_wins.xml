<lyrics>


<l>Seems like now days ain#146;t nothin#146; meant to last

one day you#146;ve got it all and then it disappears so fast,
and you know our love is on and off again
Well I know you wanna quit me, baby,
but a quitter never wins


</l>
<l>Well, you#146;ve walked out on our lovin#146;,

but I#146;ve stayed through thick and thin,
and you know our love is on and off again
I know you want to quit me,
but a quitter never wins


</l>
<l>Seems like now days love is a word that no one means

Ya said you#146;d never leave me,
then ya upped and walked right out on me,
and now our love is on and off again
Well, I know you wanna quit me,
but a quitter never wins


</l><l>Well, I know you wanna quit me baby</l>
<l>But a quitter never wins,</l>
