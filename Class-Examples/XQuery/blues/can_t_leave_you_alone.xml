<lyrics>


<l>I cry for love that's gone

</l>
<l>A love that can't be mine

</l>
<l>Well I'll pay every day for loving you

</l>
<l>Darling deep down inside



</l>
<l>How am I gonna tell you

</l>
<l>How am I gonna let you know

</l>
<l>That night and day I think about you

</l>
<l>And it's killing me slow



</l>
<l>The temptation of you is oh so strong

</l>
<l>I know I can't have you

</l>
<l>Why can't I leave you alone



</l>
<l>Oh I know that this trouble

</l>
<l>Oh it's here to stay

</l>
<l>That's why I'm keeping me distance

</l>
<l>Oh I'm praying that you come my way

</l>
<l>Praying that you come my way

</l>
<l>Oh praying that you come my way



</l>
<l>The temptation of you is oh so strong

</l>
<l>I know I can't have you

</l>
<l>Why can't I leave you alone



</l>
<l>Oh I want you to come see me

</l>
<l>Oh late at night

</l>
<l>That's when we'll pull down the shades darling

</l>
<l>And we'll turn down the lights



</l>
<l>Ooo I don't want to hurt myself

</l>
<l>Don't want to drive you away

</l>
<l>That's why I'm keeping my distance

</l>
<l>Oh I'm praying that you come my way

</l>
<l>Praying that you come my way

</l>
<l>Oh praying that you come my
