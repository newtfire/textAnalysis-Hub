<lyrics>



I cry for love that's gone

A love that can't be mine

Well I'll pay every day for loving you

Darling deep down inside



How am I gonna tell you

How am I gonna let you know

That night and day I think about you

And it's killing me slow



The temptation of you is oh so strong

I know I can't have you

Why can't I leave you alone



Oh I know that this trouble

Oh it's here to stay

That's why I'm keeping me distance

Oh I'm praying that you come my way

Praying that you come my way

Oh praying that you come my way



The temptation of you is oh so strong

I know I can't have you

Why can't I leave you alone



Oh I want you to come see me

Oh late at night

That's when we'll pull down the shades darling

And we'll turn down the lights



Ooo I don't want to hurt myself

Don't want to drive you away

That's why I'm keeping my distance

Oh I'm praying that you come my way

Praying that you come my way

Oh praying that you come my

Oh praying that you come my way
