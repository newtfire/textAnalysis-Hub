<lyrics>


<l>You lay me down, whisper in my ear
Well, it may be my name you call,
but it's his name I hear

</l>
<l>You promised me through thick and thin
You told me you loved me, you told me a lie,
because you love him

</l>
<l>And I'm missin'; your love every day

I'm missin'; your love every way
Though you're here with me,
I'm still missin'; your love


</l>
<l>And when we talk, you look into my eyes
You're talkin'; to me but baby I can see,
he's on your mind

</l>
<l>And I'm missin'; your love every day

I'm missin'; your love love every way
Though you're here with me, baby, I'm missin'; your love,
I reach out for you and you turn away
It takes all I can do to make it through the day,
and I'm missin'; your love


</l><l>And I'm missin'; your love every day,</l>
<l>missin'; your love every way</l>
<l>Though you're here with me,</l>
<l>I'm still missin'; your love</l></lyrics></xml>
