<l>Did you ever wake up with sorrow all on your mind?</l>

<l>Did you ever wake up with sorrow all on your mind?</l>

<l>He plays the blues to his congregation, hear his trombone whine</l>



<l>He'll make you love, he'll make you cry, he'll sit right down and
moan</l>

<l>He'll weep and moan till I hear him say</l>

<l>Lord I wonder where my loving man is gone</l>




<l>Easy rider
, you see
I'm going away,</l>

<l>I won't be back until you change your ways</l>

<l>I won't be back until you change your ways</l>



<l>I'm going to the river carryin' a brand new rockin' chair</l>

<l>I'm going to the river carryin' a brand new rockin' chair</l>

<l>I'm gonna ask Mister Tadpole to move all his stuff from here</l>



<l>Blues jumped a rabbit, run him for a solid mile</l>

<l>Blues jumped a rabbit, run him for a solid mile</l>

<l>The rabbit turned over and he cried like a natural</l>
