<l>That's my baby in the white boots

</l>
<l>That's my baby on the floor

</l>
<l>That's my baby havin' some fun

</l>
<l>And yellin' more, more, more



</l>
<l>That's my baby in the short skirt

</l>
<l>Wo, out of control

</l>
<l>Ah, she becomes another woman

</l>
<l>When she rocks &amp; rolls



</l>
<l>She's having a good time

</l>
<l>Goin' round &amp; round

</l>
<l>She's really rippin' it up

</l>
<l>You know she can't sit down, oh no



</l>
<l>That's my baby lookin' so good

</l>
<l>You know I can't explain

</l>
<l>How when she's dancing in the white boots

</l>
<l>It makes her go insane



</l>
<l>She's having a good time

</l>
<l>Goin' round &amp; round

</l>
<l>She's really rippin' it up

</l>
<l>You know she can't sit down, oh no



</l>
<l>That's my baby in the short skirt

</l>
<l>With the white boots on



</l>
<l>That's my baby in the white boots

</l>
<l>That's my baby on the floor

</l>
<l>That's my baby havin' some fun

</l>
<l>And yellin' more, more, more



</l>
<l>She's having a good time

</l>
<l>Goin' round &amp; round

</l>
<l>She's really rippin' it up

</l>
<l>You know she can't sit down, oh no



</l>
<l>That's my baby in the short skirt

</l>
<l>With the white boots on



</l>
<l>With the white boots on

</l>
<l>In the short skirt

</l>
<l>With the white boots on

</l>
<l>Can't explain



</l>
<l>You know I can't explain

</l>
<l>How when she's dancing in the white boots

</l>
<l>It makes her go insane



</l>
<l>White boots, white boots

</l>
<l>White boots, white boots
