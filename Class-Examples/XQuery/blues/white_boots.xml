That's my baby in the white boots

That's my baby on the floor

That's my baby havin' some fun

And yellin' more, more, more



That's my baby in the short skirt

Wo, out of control

Ah, she becomes another woman

When she rocks &amp; rolls



She's having a good time

Goin' round &amp; round

She's really rippin' it up

You know she can't sit down, oh no



That's my baby lookin' so good

You know I can't explain

How when she's dancing in the white boots

It makes her go insane



She's having a good time

Goin' round &amp; round

She's really rippin' it up

You know she can't sit down, oh no



That's my baby in the short skirt

With the white boots on



That's my baby in the white boots

That's my baby on the floor

That's my baby havin' some fun

And yellin' more, more, more



She's having a good time

Goin' round &amp; round

She's really rippin' it up

You know she can't sit down, oh no



That's my baby in the short skirt

With the white boots on



With the white boots on

In the short skirt

With the white boots on

Can't explain



You know I can't explain

How when she's dancing in the white boots

It makes her go insane



White boots, white boots

White boots, white boots
