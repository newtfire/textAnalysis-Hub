<lyrics>



I ain't never missed a woman, anytime or anyhow

Said I ain't never missed a woman, anytime or anyhow

I said, I ain't never missed nobody, just like the way I miss my baby
now



If you could see my woman, you'd know why no one else can take her
place

If you could see my woman, people, you'd realize why no one else can
take her place

You'd know just what I'm talking 'bout, if you could see my baby's
sweet, sweet face



That's why I ain't never missed a woman, anytime or any place

No, I ain't never ever missed a woman, anytime or any place

When I say I ain't never missed nobody, I mean I ain't never missed
nobody like I miss my baby now, yeah
