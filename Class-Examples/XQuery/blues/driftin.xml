<lyrics>


<l>I ain't never missed a woman, anytime or anyhow

</l>
<l>Said I ain't never missed a woman, anytime or anyhow

</l>
<l>I said, I ain't never missed nobody, just like the way I miss my baby

now




</l>
<l>If you could see my woman, you'd know why no one else can take her
place

</l>
<l>If you could see my woman, people, you'd realize why no one else can
take her place

</l>
<l>You'd know just what I'm talking 'bout, if you could see my baby's

sweet, sweet face




</l>
<l>That's why I ain't never missed a woman, anytime or any place

</l>
<l>No, I ain't never ever missed a woman, anytime or any place

</l><l>When I say I ain't never missed nobody, I mean I ain't never missed</l>
<l>nobody like I miss my baby now, yeah</l></lyrics></xml>
