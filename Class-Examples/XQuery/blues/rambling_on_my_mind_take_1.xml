<l>I got 

ramblin'
,
I got ramblin' on my mind


</l>
<l>I got ramblin', I got ramblin' all on my mind

</l>
<l>Hate to leave my baby, but you treats me so unkind



</l>
<l>I got mean things, I got mean things all on my mind

</l>
<l>Little girl, little girl, I got mean things all on my mind

</l>
<l>Hate to leave you here, babe, but you treats me so unkind



</l>
<l>Runnin' down to the station, catch the first mail train I see

</l>
<l>(spoken: I think I hear her comin' now)

</l>
<l>Runnin' down to the station, catch the old first mail train I see

</l>
<l>I got the blues about Miss So-and-So and the child got the blues

about me




</l>
<l>And I'm leavin' this mornin', with my arm' fold' up and cryin'

</l>
<l>And I'm leavin' this mornin', with my arm' fold' up and cryin'

</l>
<l>Hate to leave my baby, but she treats me so unkind



</l>
<l>I got mean things, I've got mean things on my mind

</l>
<l>I got mean things, I got mean things all on my mind

</l>
<l>I got to leave my baby, well, she treats me so unkind</l></lyrics></xml>
