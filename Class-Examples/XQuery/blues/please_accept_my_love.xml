<lyrics>


<l>I don't even know your name

</l>
<l>But I love you just the same

</l>
<l>If you let me hold your hand

</l>
<l>Then I think maybe I can make you understand



</l>
<l>If you only, only knew

</l>
<l>Just how much I love you

</l>
<l>Loving you the way I do

</l>
<l>Then you'd take the night to love me too



</l>
<l>I'd like the picture on the wall

</l>
<l>So please don't let me fall

</l>
<l>It's my heart I'm thinkin' of

</l>
<l>So please, please accept my love



</l>
<l>If you let me be your slave

</l>
<l>Your love I'll cherish to my grave

</l>
<l>And if you should die before I do

</l>
<l>I'll, I said I'll, I'll end my life to be with you



</l>
<l>Yes, I will!</l></lyrics></xml>
