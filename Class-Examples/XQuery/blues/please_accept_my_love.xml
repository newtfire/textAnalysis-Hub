<lyrics>



I don't even know your name

But I love you just the same

If you let me hold your hand

Then I think maybe I can make you understand



If you only, only knew

Just how much I love you

Loving you the way I do

Then you'd take the night to love me too



I'd like the picture on the wall

So please don't let me fall

It's my heart I'm thinkin' of

So please, please accept my love



If you let me be your slave

Your love I'll cherish to my grave

And if you should die before I do

I'll, I said I'll, I'll end my life to be with you



Yes, I will!
