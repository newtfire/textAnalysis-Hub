<lyrics>



I went to the crossroad, fell down on my knees

I went to the crossroad, fell down on my knees

Asked the Lord above "Have mercy, save poor Bob, if you please"



Mmmmm, standin' at the crossroad, I tried 
to
flag a ride

Standin' at the crossroad, I tried to flag a ride

Didn't nobody seem to know me, everybody pass me by



Mmmm, the sun goin' down, boy, dark gon' catch me here

Oooo, oooeeee, boy, dark gon' catch me here

I haven't got no lovin' sweet woman that love and feel my care



You can run, you can run, tell my friend-boy
1
 Willie
Brown
2

You can run, tell my friend-boy
1
 Willie
Brown
2

Lord, that I'm standin' at the crossroad, babe, I believe I'm sinkin'
down



__________

Note 1: friend-boy is a dialectic synonym for "boyfriend" when used
between men;

Note 2: this could either be the close friend of Son House named
Willie Brown with whom he played together when Robert Johnson first
began to play, or the younger Willie Brown who did some recordings
for the Library of Congress or yet another completely unknown Willie
Brown, who knows(?);

Note: did Robert Johnson sell his soul to the devil at the
crossroads?. Read about it at 
The
Mudcat Cafeacute;
.



In the 
Delta of the
Mississippi River
, where Robert Johnson was born, they said that
if an aspiring bluesman waited by the side of a deserted country
crossroads in the dark of a moonless night, then Satan himself might
come and tune his guitar, sealing a pact for the bluesman's soul and
guaranteeing a lifetime of easy money, women, and fame. They said
that Robert Johnson must have waited by the crossroads and gotten his
guitar fine-tuned.
