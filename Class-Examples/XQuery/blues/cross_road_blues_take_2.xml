<l>I went to the crossroad, fell down on my knees

</l>
<l>I went to the crossroad, fell down on my knees

</l>
<l>Asked the Lord above "Have mercy, save poor Bob, if you please"



</l>
<l>Mmmmm, standin' at the crossroad, I tried 
to
flag a ride

</l>
<l>Standin' at the crossroad, I tried to flag a ride

</l>
<l>Didn't nobody seem to know me, everybody pass me by



</l>
<l>Mmmm, the sun goin' down, boy, dark gon' catch me here

</l>
<l>Oooo, oooeeee, boy, dark gon' catch me here

</l>
<l>I haven't got no lovin' sweet woman that love and feel my care



</l>
<l>You can run, you can run, tell my friend-boy
1
Willie </l>
<l>Brown
2

</l>
<l>You can run, tell my friend-boy
1
Willie </l>
<l>Brown
2

</l>
<l>Lord, that I'm standin' at the crossroad, babe, I believe I'm sinkin'

down

<note>Note 1: friend-boy is a dialectic synonym for "boyfriend" when used
between men;

Note 2: this could either be the close friend of Son House named
Willie Brown with whom he played together when Robert Johnson first
began to play, or the younger Willie Brown who did some recordings
for the Library of Congress or yet another completely unknown Willie
Brown, who knows(?);

Note: did Robert Johnson sell his soul to the devil at the
crossroads?
.



In the Delta of the Mississippi River, where Robert Johnson was born, they said that
if an aspiring bluesman waited by the side of a deserted country
crossroads in the dark of a moonless night, then Satan himself might
come and tune his guitar, sealing a pact for the bluesman's soul and
guaranteeing a lifetime of easy money, women, and fame. They said
that Robert Johnson must have waited by the crossroads and gotten his
guitar fine-tuned.</note></lyrics></xml>
