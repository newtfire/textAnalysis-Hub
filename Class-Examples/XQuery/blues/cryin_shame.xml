<lyrics>


<l>I try my best just to past the test

</l>
<l>But I don't think I'm gonna make it

</l>
<l>Wham bam, people got a hold on me

</l>
<l>And I just can't seem to shake it



</l>
<l>I'm always down since I hit this town

</l>
<l>Lord knows it sure is a pity

</l>
<l>I never understand the woman or the man

</l>
<l>What gets off livin' in the city



</l>
<l>Anyway you see it, it remains the same

</l>
<l>Can anybody tell me who's to blame?

</l>
<l>Anyway you see it, it remains the same

</l>
<l>Livin' like this is a cryin' shame

</l>
<l>Cryin' shame

</l>
<l>Cryin' shame



</l>
<l>Workin' all day got no time to play

</l>
<l>It's enough to make you worry

</l>
<l>I just can't see for the life of me

</l>
<l>Why everyone's in such a hurry



</l>
<l>It takes all my money, got to please me honey

</l>
<l>It sho' is makin' me crazy

</l>
<l>Gotta find a way for to get my pay

</l>
<l>Layin' down feelin' lazy



</l>
<l>Anyway you see it, it remains the same

</l>
<l>Can anybody tell me who's to blame?

</l>
<l>Anyway you see it, it remains the same

</l>
<l>Livin' like this is a cryin' shame



</l>
<l>Cryin' shame

</l>
<l>Cryin' shame
