<lyrics>



I try my best just to past the test

But I don't think I'm gonna make it

Wham bam, people got a hold on me

And I just can't seem to shake it



I'm always down since I hit this town

Lord knows it sure is a pity

I never understand the woman or the man

What gets off livin' in the city



Anyway you see it, it remains the same

Can anybody tell me who's to blame?

Anyway you see it, it remains the same

Livin' like this is a cryin' shame

Cryin' shame

Cryin' shame



Workin' all day got no time to play

It's enough to make you worry

I just can't see for the life of me

Why everyone's in such a hurry



It takes all my money, got to please me honey

It sho' is makin' me crazy

Gotta find a way for to get my pay

Layin' down feelin' lazy



Anyway you see it, it remains the same

Can anybody tell me who's to blame?

Anyway you see it, it remains the same

Livin' like this is a cryin' shame



Cryin' shame

Cryin' shame

Cryin' shame
