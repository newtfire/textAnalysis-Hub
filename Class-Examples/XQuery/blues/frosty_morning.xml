<lyrics>



How come I'm blue as can be, how come I need sympathy

I know what's troubling me, listen and you'll see

Because the good man that I got, left me all alone

Woke up this morning at four, when I heard him slamming my door



Did you ever wake up on a frosty morning and discover your good man
gone

Did you ever wake up on a frosty morning and discover your good man
gone

If you did you'll understand, why I'm singing sad moanful songs



Well, he didn't provide and he wasn't handsome, so he might not
appeal to you

Well, he didn't provide and he wasn't handsome, so he might not
appeal to you

But he gave me plenty loving and I never had to beg him too



Now my damper
1
 is down and my fire ain't burning and a
chill's all around my bed

My damper is down and my fire ain't burning and a chill's all around
my bed

When you lose the man you love, then a gal is just as good as
dead



__________

Note 1: damper, a device that damps as a valve or plate (as in the
flue of a furnace) for regulating the draft.
