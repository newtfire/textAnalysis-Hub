<lyrics>

<l>How come I'm blue as can be, how come I need sympathy

</l>
<l>I know what's troubling me, listen and you'll see

</l>
<l>Because the good man that I got, left me all alone

</l>
<l>Woke up this morning at four, when I heard him slamming my door



</l>
<l>Did you ever wake up on a frosty morning and discover your good man
gone

</l>
<l>Did you ever wake up on a frosty morning and discover your good man
gone

</l>
<l>If you did you'll understand, why I'm singing sad moanful songs



</l>
<l>Well, he didn't provide and he wasn't handsome, so he might not
appeal to you

</l>
<l>Well, he didn't provide and he wasn't handsome, so he might not
appeal to you

</l>
<l>But he gave me plenty loving and I never had to beg him too



</l>
<l>Now my damper
1
is down and my fire ain't burning and a </l>
<l>chill's all around my bed

</l>
<l>My damper is down and my fire ain't burning and a chill's all around
my bed

</l>
<l>When you lose the man you love, then a gal is just as good as
dead



</l>

flue of a furnace) for regulating the draft</note></lyrics></xml>
