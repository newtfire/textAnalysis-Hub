<lyrics>



It's great to be rich and a doggone shame to be poor

It's great to be rich and a doggone shame to be poor

It's a lowdown dirty deal when your woman don't want you no more



I tried to please her but it only made her mad

I tried to please her but it only made her mad

She done strip me and took everything I had



Now what you gonna do with a woman like that?

Now what you gonna do with a woman like that?

Who takes all your money yes and leaves you flat?



Yes it's great to be rich and a doggone shame to be poor

It's a lowdown dirty deal when your woman don't want you no more

Now it was money in the morning, and money every night



If I didn't have no money, she was ready to fight

It's great to be rich and a doggone shame to be poor

It's a lowdown dirty deal when your woman don't want you no more
