<l>It's great to be rich and a doggone shame to be poor

</l>
<l>It's great to be rich and a doggone shame to be poor

</l>
<l>It's a lowdown dirty deal when your woman don't want you no more



</l>
<l>I tried to please her but it only made her mad

</l>
<l>I tried to please her but it only made her mad

</l>
<l>She done strip me and took everything I had



</l>
<l>Now what you gonna do with a woman like that?

</l>
<l>Now what you gonna do with a woman like that?

</l>
<l>Who takes all your money yes and leaves you flat?



</l>
<l>Yes it's great to be rich and a doggone shame to be poor

</l>
<l>It's a lowdown dirty deal when your woman don't want you no more

</l>
<l>Now it was money in the morning, and money every night



</l>
<l>If I didn't have no money, she was ready to fight

</l>
<l>It's great to be rich and a doggone shame to be poor

</l>
<l>It's a lowdown dirty deal when your woman don't want you no more</l></lyrics></xml>
