<lyrics>



If you're down an' out, an' you feel real hurt

Come on over, to the place where I work

An' all your loneliness, I'll try to soothe

I'll play the blues for you



Don't be afraid, come on in

You might run across, yeah, some of your old friends

All your loneliness, I've got to soothe



I'll play the blues for you



(Spoken:

Come on in, sit right here

Let's rap awhile

Ya see I'm kinda lonely too, yeah

An' loneliness is a very bad thing

If ya let it get the best of ya



An' loneliness can get ya down, you know

Yeah, yeah, are you comfortable now?

Yeah, yeah, that's outta sight



Yeah, as I was sayin' before

Loneliness can get you down, an'I have heard of, ah

Loneliness blowin' some good people's mind, ya know?

But ya can't do that

This is a big world, this is a big world

An' there's too many nice things happenin' in this world



You're a very pretty girl

Where you live?

No, no, no, disregard that, that's okay, that's okay

Most important thing

I wanna know YOU

I say, I wanna know YOU



Uh-huh, ooo-wee, that's groovy, ain't it?)



I'll play the blues for you



I ain't got no big name

Oh Lord, an' I ain't no big star

I'll play the blues for you, on my guitar

All your loneliness, I'll try to soothe



I'll play the blues for you, um!



'Cuse me



Um! woo! um! Woo! Uh-huh, yeah!

Uh-huh! um! Oh!
