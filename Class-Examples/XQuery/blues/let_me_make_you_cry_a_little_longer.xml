<lyrics>


<l>You know by now that I've been passed

</l>
<l>Through an awful lot of hands

</l>
<l>And all I have is what is left

</l>
<l>From ten thousand one night stands



</l>
<l>Sometimes I feel like I was there

</l>
<l>When the blues began

</l>
<l>With this crying guitar holding me

</l>
<l>Like a woman holds a man



</l>
<l>Let me make you cry a little longer

</l>
<l>Let me make you high a little longer

</l>
<l>Oh, I want to try a little longer

</l>
<l>Make some woman sigh a little longer



</l>
<l>At night sometimes I can still feel

</l>
<l>Every place I've ever been

</l>
<l>I feel it in my music

</l>
<l>And it all comes back again



</l>
<l>You know I've played for city lights

</l>
<l>And for stars above

</l>
<l>And every note I ever play

</l>
<l>I always play for love



</l>
<l>Let me make you cry a little longer

</l>
<l>Let me make you high a little longer

</l>
<l>Oh, I want to try a little longer

</l>
<l>Make some woman sigh a little longer</l></lyrics></xml>
