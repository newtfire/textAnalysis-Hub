<lyrics>



You know by now that I've been passed

Through an awful lot of hands

And all I have is what is left

From ten thousand one night stands



Sometimes I feel like I was there

When the blues began

With this crying guitar holding me

Like a woman holds a man



Let me make you cry a little longer

Let me make you high a little longer

Oh, I want to try a little longer

Make some woman sigh a little longer



At night sometimes I can still feel

Every place I've ever been

I feel it in my music

And it all comes back again



You know I've played for city lights

And for stars above

And every note I ever play

I always play for love



Let me make you cry a little longer

Let me make you high a little longer

Oh, I want to try a little longer

Make some woman sigh a little longer
