<l>I have the blues before sunrise, tears standing in my eyes

</l>
<l>I have the blues before sunrise, tears standing in my eyes

</l>
<l>It was a miserable feeling, now babe, a feeling I do despise



</l>
<l>I have to leave, leave you baby, because you know you done me
wrong

</l>
<l>I have to leave you baby, because you know you done me wrong

</l>
<l>I'm gonna pack up and leave you darling and break up my happy

home




</l>
<l>I have to leave, leave you baby, I'm gonna leave you all alone

</l>
<l>I'm gonna leave you baby, I'm gonna leave you all alone

</l>
<l>I'm gonna pack up and leav you darling, because you know you done me

wrong




</l>
<l>Well now goodbye, goodbye baby, I'll see you on some rainy day

</l>
<l>Well now goodbye baby, I'll see you on some rainy day
