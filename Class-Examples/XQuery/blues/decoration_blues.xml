<l>Lord, I had a woman, she was nice lovin' in ev'ry way

</l>
<l>Lord, I had a woman, she was nice lovin' in ev'ry way

</l>
<l>Lord, but she died and left me, I have the blues on ev'ry decoration
day
1



</l>
<l>Lord, I hated to see her leave, because these were the last words my
baby had to say

</l>
<l>Lord, I hate to see her leave me, because these are the last words my
baby had to say

</l>
<l>She told me to bring her some flowers, on ev'ry decoration day



</l>
<l>People you havin' a good time now, just like the flowers that comes
in May

</l>
<l>People you havin' a good time now, just like the flowers that comes
in May

</l>
<l>Now, but Sonny Boy, thinks about his baby, on ev'ry decoration
day



</l>
<l>Fare you well, baby, I ain't got no mo' to say

</l>
<l>Fare you well, baby, I ain't got no mo' to say

</l>
<l>Lord, but I always rememeber, I won't never forget decoration day



</l>
<l>Play along boy!

<note>Note 1: decoration day, from the custom of decorating graves on this
day. The last Monday in May observed as a legal holiday in most
states of the U.S. in remembrance of war dead</note></lyrics></xml>
