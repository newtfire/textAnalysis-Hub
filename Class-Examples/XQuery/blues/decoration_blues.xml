<lyrics>



Lord, I had a woman, she was nice lovin' in ev'ry way

Lord, I had a woman, she was nice lovin' in ev'ry way

Lord, but she died and left me, I have the blues on ev'ry decoration
day
1



Lord, I hated to see her leave, because these were the last words my
baby had to say

Lord, I hate to see her leave me, because these are the last words my
baby had to say

She told me to bring her some flowers, on ev'ry decoration day



People you havin' a good time now, just like the flowers that comes
in May

People you havin' a good time now, just like the flowers that comes
in May

Now, but Sonny Boy, thinks about his baby, on ev'ry decoration
day



Fare you well, baby, I ain't got no mo' to say

Fare you well, baby, I ain't got no mo' to say

Lord, but I always rememeber, I won't never forget decoration day



Play along boy!



__________

Note 1: decoration day, from the custom of decorating graves on this
day. The last Monday in May observed as a legal holiday in most
states of the U.S. in remembrance of war dead.
