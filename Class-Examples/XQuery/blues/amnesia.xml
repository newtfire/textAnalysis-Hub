<lyrics>



There's a girl in the town calling my name

She says I put her down and I'm the one to blame

Well I broke her heart and left her here to cry

And I know that girl is telling me a lie

She says, "I left and took back my ring,

I don't remember a god-darn thing"



I used to like to run around

My reputation was going down

Spent my money like it was out of style

I wouldn't even give my gal a smile

She says, "I left and took back my ring,

I really don't remember a thing"



Amnesia, amnesia, amnesia

Baby what I do



Amnesia, amnesia, amnesia

Baby what I do



I used to like to run around

With every little girl in this town

Well I spent my money like it was out of style

I wouldn't even give my gal a smile

She says she wants me to come home

I wish the girl would just leave me alone



Amnesia, amnesia, amnesia

Baby what I do
