<lyrics>


<l>There's a girl in the town calling my name

</l>
<l>She says I put her down and I'm the one to blame

</l>
<l>Well I broke her heart and left her here to cry

</l>
<l>And I know that girl is telling me a lie

</l>
<l>She says, "I left and took back my ring,

</l>
<l>I don't remember a god-darn thing"



</l>
<l>I used to like to run around

</l>
<l>My reputation was going down

</l>
<l>Spent my money like it was out of style

</l>
<l>I wouldn't even give my gal a smile

</l>
<l>She says, "I left and took back my ring,

</l>
<l>I really don't remember a thing"



</l>
<l>Amnesia, amnesia, amnesia

</l>
<l>Baby what I do



</l>
<l>Amnesia, amnesia, amnesia

</l>
<l>Baby what I do



</l>
<l>I used to like to run around

</l>
<l>With every little girl in this town

</l>
<l>Well I spent my money like it was out of style

</l>
<l>I wouldn't even give my gal a smile

</l>
<l>She says she wants me to come home

</l>
<l>I wish the girl would just leave me alone



</l>
<l>Amnesia, amnesia, amnesia

</l>
<l>Baby what I do</l></lyrics></xml>
