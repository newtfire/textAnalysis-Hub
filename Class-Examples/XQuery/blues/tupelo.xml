<lyrics>


<l>(spoken:

</l>
<l>Did you read about the flood?

</l>
<l>It happened long time ago, in a little country town, way back in
Mississippi

</l>
<l>It rained and it rained, it rained both night and day

</l>
<l>The people got worried, they began to cry,

</l>
<l>"Lord have mercy, where can we go now?"

</l>
<l>There were women and there was children, screaming and crying,

</l>
<l>"Lord have mercy and a great disaster, who can we turn to now, but
you?"

</l>
<l>The great flood of 
Tupelo,
Mississippi

</l>
<l>It happened one evenin', one Friday evenin', a long time ago,

</l>
<l>it rained and it started rainin'

</l>
<l>The people of Tupelo, out on the farm gathering their harvest,

</l>
<l>a dark cloud rolled, way back in Tupelo, Mississippi, hmm, hmm)



</l>
<l>Wasn't that a mighty time,

</l>
<l>wasn't that a mighty time?

</l>
<l>Wasn't that a mighty time,

</l>
<l>a mighty time, that evenin'?

</l>
<l>It rained, both night and day

</l>
<l>The poor people that had no place to go, hmm,hmm

</l>
<l>A little town, called Tupelo, Mississippi

</l>
<l>I never forget it and I know you won't either</l></lyrics></xml>
