<lyrics>



Willie the Wimp was buried today,

they laid him to rest in a special way.

Sent him off in the finest style,

that casket-mobile really drove 'em wild

Southside Chicago will think of him often,

talkin' 'bout Willie the Wimp and his cadillac coffin,

Willie the Wimp and his cadillac coffin



That casket, it looked like a fine Seville,

he had a vanity license and a cadillac grille

Willie was propped up in the driver's seat,

he had diamonds on his fingers and a smile sweet

Fine red suit had the whole town talkin',

talkin' 'bout Willie the Wimp and his Cadillac coffin

Willie the Wimp and his cadillac coffin



Oh, cadillac to heaven he was wavin' the banner,

he left like he lived, in a lively manner

With a-hundred dollar bills in his fingers tight,

he had flowers for wheels and a-flashin' headlights

He been wishin' for wings, no way he was walkin',

talkin' 'bout Willie the Wimp and his cadillac coffin

Yeah, Willie the Wimp and his cadillac coffin
