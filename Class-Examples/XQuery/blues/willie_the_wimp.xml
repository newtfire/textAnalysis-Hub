<l>Willie the Wimp was buried today,

</l>
<l>they laid him to rest in a special way.

</l>
<l>Sent him off in the finest style,

</l>
<l>that casket-mobile really drove 'em wild

</l>
<l>Southside Chicago will think of him often,

</l>
<l>talkin' 'bout Willie the Wimp and his cadillac coffin,

</l>
<l>Willie the Wimp and his cadillac coffin



</l>
<l>That casket, it looked like a fine Seville,

</l>
<l>he had a vanity license and a cadillac grille

</l>
<l>Willie was propped up in the driver's seat,

</l>
<l>he had diamonds on his fingers and a smile sweet

</l>
<l>Fine red suit had the whole town talkin',

</l>
<l>talkin' 'bout Willie the Wimp and his Cadillac coffin

</l>
<l>Willie the Wimp and his cadillac coffin



</l>
<l>Oh, cadillac to heaven he was wavin' the banner,

</l>
<l>he left like he lived, in a lively manner

</l>
<l>With a-hundred dollar bills in his fingers tight,

</l>
<l>he had flowers for wheels and a-flashin' headlights

</l>
<l>He been wishin' for wings, no way he was walkin',

</l>
<l>talkin' 'bout Willie the Wimp and his cadillac coffin

</l>
<l>Yeah, Willie the Wimp and his cadillac coffin</l></lyrics></xml>
