<lyrics>



I gave you a diamond ring, you won't wear

It's a nine thousand dollar thing, you don't care

I set up a wedding date, you couldn't make it

You said all the love we made, you were just faking



But girl, you know, what hurts me the most

Is I gave all my love to you, all you ever give me

All you ever give me, all you ever give me is the blues

Is the blues



I gave you my Cadillac keys, you don't drive

I hired you a limousine, you won't ride

Bought you the house on the hill, you hate the view

Even wrote you into my will, gave you something to look forward
to



But girl, you know, what hurts me the most

Is I gave all my love to you

All you ever give me

All you ever give me

All you ever give me is the blues

Nothing but the blues



I've tried and tried, but I'm mystified

I've done all that I can do, I've given you my best

You put me to the test

All you ever give me

All you ever give me

All you ever give me is the blues

Nothing but the blues



But girl, you know, what hurts me the most

Is I gave all my love to you

All you ever give me

All you ever give me

All you ever gave me was the blues

All you ever gave me

All you ever gave me

All you ever gave me

All you ever gave me was the blues

Nothing but the blues
