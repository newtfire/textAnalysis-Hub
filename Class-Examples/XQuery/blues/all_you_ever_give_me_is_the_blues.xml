<lyrics>


<l>I gave you a diamond ring, you won't wear

</l>
<l>It's a nine thousand dollar thing, you don't care

</l>
<l>I set up a wedding date, you couldn't make it

</l>
<l>You said all the love we made, you were just faking



</l>
<l>But girl, you know, what hurts me the most

</l>
<l>Is I gave all my love to you, all you ever give me

</l>
<l>All you ever give me, all you ever give me is the blues

</l>
<l>Is the blues



</l>
<l>I gave you my Cadillac keys, you don't drive

</l>
<l>I hired you a limousine, you won't ride

</l>
<l>Bought you the house on the hill, you hate the view

</l>
<l>Even wrote you into my will, gave you something to look forward

to




</l>
<l>But girl, you know, what hurts me the most

</l>
<l>Is I gave all my love to you

</l>
<l>All you ever give me

</l>
<l>All you ever give me

</l>
<l>All you ever give me is the blues

</l>
<l>Nothing but the blues



</l>
<l>I've tried and tried, but I'm mystified

</l>
<l>I've done all that I can do, I've given you my best

</l>
<l>You put me to the test

</l>
<l>All you ever give me

</l>
<l>All you ever give me

</l>
<l>All you ever give me is the blues

</l>
<l>Nothing but the blues



</l>
<l>But girl, you know, what hurts me the most

</l>
<l>Is I gave all my love to you

</l>
<l>All you ever give me

</l>
<l>All you ever give me

</l>
<l>All you ever gave me was the blues

</l>
<l>All you ever gave me

</l>
<l>All you ever gave me

</l>
<l>All you ever gave me

</l>
<l>All you ever gave me was the blues

</l><l>Nothing but the blues</l></lyrics></xml>
