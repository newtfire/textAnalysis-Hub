<lyrics>



Missed the Saturday dance,

heard they crowded the floor

It's awfully different without you,

don't get around much anymore



Thought I visit the club,

got as far as the door

I just couldn't bear without you,

I don't get around much anymore



Darling I guess, my mind is more at ease

but nevertheless, why stir up memories

Been invited on a date,

I might have gone, but what for

I just couldn't bear it without you,

I don't get around much anymore



Don't get around much anymore
