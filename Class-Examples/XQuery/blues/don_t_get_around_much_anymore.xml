<lyrics>


<l>Missed the Saturday dance,

</l>
<l>heard they crowded the floor

</l>
<l>It's awfully different without you,

</l>
<l>don't get around much anymore



</l>
<l>Thought I visit the club,

</l>
<l>got as far as the door

</l>
<l>I just couldn't bear without you,

</l>
<l>I don't get around much anymore



</l>
<l>Darling I guess, my mind is more at ease

</l>
<l>but nevertheless, why stir up memories

</l>
<l>Been invited on a date,

</l>
<l>I might have gone, but what for

</l>
<l>I just couldn't bear it without you,

</l>
<l>I don't get around much anymore



</l>
<l>Don't get around much anymore</l></lyrics></xml>
