<lyrics>



Girl, you're my sunshine

You chase away the raindrops

Make it all worthwhile

Make all the pain stop

Just like a river you keep love flowing

Don't let our world stop, keep it growing



Oh I like you just the way you are

Honey, don't change on me

Don't change on me

Please don't change on me

Girl, you're my lucky star

Don't change on me

Don't change on me

(Please) don't ever change



I used to wonder where would I find

Some kind of happiness and peace of mind

I was living in darkness

Oh but then you came

Bringing in the sunlight

And easing my pain



Oh I like you just the way you are

Honey, don't change on me

Don't change on me

Please don't change on me

Girl, you're my lucky star

Don't change on me

Don't change on me

(Please) don't ever change



If there's a heaven

Then this is my prayer

Lord knows I want to know you

If we ever should meet there

And then forever we'll walk together

Nothing but sunshine

And no more stormy weather



Oh I like you just the way you are

Honey, don't change on me

Don't change on me

Please don't change on me

Girl, you're my lucky star

Don't change on me

Don't change on me

(Please) don't ever change
