<lyrics>


<l>Girl, you're my sunshine

</l>
<l>You chase away the raindrops

</l>
<l>Make it all worthwhile

</l>
<l>Make all the pain stop

</l>
<l>Just like a river you keep love flowing

</l>
<l>Don't let our world stop, keep it growing



</l>
<l>Oh I like you just the way you are

</l>
<l>Honey, don't change on me

</l>
<l>Don't change on me

</l>
<l>Please don't change on me

</l>
<l>Girl, you're my lucky star

</l>
<l>Don't change on me

</l>
<l>Don't change on me

</l>
<l>(Please) don't ever change



</l>
<l>I used to wonder where would I find

</l>
<l>Some kind of happiness and peace of mind

</l>
<l>I was living in darkness

</l>
<l>Oh but then you came

</l>
<l>Bringing in the sunlight

</l>
<l>And easing my pain



</l>
<l>Oh I like you just the way you are

</l>
<l>Honey, don't change on me

</l>
<l>Don't change on me

</l>
<l>Please don't change on me

</l>
<l>Girl, you're my lucky star

</l>
<l>Don't change on me

</l>
<l>Don't change on me

</l>
<l>(Please) don't ever change



</l>
<l>If there's a heaven

</l>
<l>Then this is my prayer

</l>
<l>Lord knows I want to know you

</l>
<l>If we ever should meet there

</l>
<l>And then forever we'll walk together

</l>
<l>Nothing but sunshine

</l>
<l>And no more stormy weather



</l>
<l>Oh I like you just the way you are

</l>
<l>Honey, don't change on me

</l>
<l>Don't change on me

</l>
<l>Please don't change on me

</l>
<l>Girl, you're my lucky star

</l>
<l>Don't change on me

</l>
<l>Don't change on me

</l>
<l>(Please) don't ever change</l></lyrics></xml>
