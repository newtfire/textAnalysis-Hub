<l>Everyday baby, when the sun go down

</l>
<l>I get with my friends, an' I begin to clown

</l>
<l>I don't care, what the people are thinkin'

</l>
<l>I ain't drunk, I'm just drinkin'



</l>
<l>(But you're so high)

</l>
<l>Oh man, you know I ain't high

</l>
<l>(But you're so high)

</l>
<l>I just take a little bit, now an' then

</l>
<l>(But you're so high)

</l>
<l>Now you oughta be 'shamed of yourself

</l>
<l>(Stay drunk all the time)

</l>
<l>Oh, c'mon now, you know ya'all get like that



</l>
<l>Come home last night, all loose

</l>
<l>Baby get in a fuss, I said, "Honey, hush"

</l>
<l>I don't care, what the people are thinkin'

</l>
<l>I ain't drunk, I'm just drinkin'



</l>
<l>(But you're so high)

</l>
<l>I ain't drunk, I done told ya'all I ain't drunk now

</l>
<l>What ya'all doin' drinkin'?

</l>
<l>(But you're so high)

</l>
<l>Actually, I'm just havin' fun, man

</l>
<l>(But you're so high)

</l>
<l>What? I know I'm not

</l>
<l>(Stay drunk all the time)

</l>
<l>Damn, I don't know why you're all talkin' about me like that!



</l>
<l>You done the right thing, I wanna thank you, too

</l>
<l>Now, let's have a little drink, just me an' you

</l>
<l>I don't care, what the people are thinkin'

</l>
<l>I ain't drunk, but I'm just drinkin'



</l>
<l>(But you're so high)

</l>
<l>Who me? I ain't high man

</l>
<l>(But you're so high)

</l>
<l>I don't know why you all talk about me like that

</l>
<l>(But you're so high)

</l>
<l>You oughta mind your own business, brother

</l>
<l>(Stay drunk all the time)



</l>
<l>You, you oughta watch yourself, too

</l>
<l>You don't understand what I'm sayin'



</l>
<l>I wanna tip you, baby, before I go

</l>
<l>I be back tomorrow night an' drink so mo'

</l>
<l>I don't care, what the people are thinkin'

</l>

</l>
<l>Oh no, you the one drunk!

</l>
<l>Look at yo' eyes, man!

</l>
<l>(But you're so high)

</l>
<l>Don't you tell my old lady, now!

</l>
<l>(But you're so high)

</l>
<l>Well I ain't had but four or five
