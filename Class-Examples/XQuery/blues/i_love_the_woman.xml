<lyrics>



I love the woman, an' learned a lesson that I can't forget

Yes, I love the woman, an' learned a lesson that I can't forget

Yes, she's mean an' she's evil and now my life is in a solid mess



Yeah...



She wakes me in the mornin'

Right before the break of day

Tellin' me to get up and go out

I had a earn myself some pay



How she scolds me like an orphan

And treats me like a clown

And when I need some lovin'

That woman can't be found



And I love the woman

And learned a lesson that I can't forget

Yes, she's mean an' she's evil

And now my life is in a solid mess!
