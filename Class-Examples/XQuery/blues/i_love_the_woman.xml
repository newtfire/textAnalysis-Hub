<lyrics>


<l>I love the woman, an' learned a lesson that I can't forget

</l>
<l>Yes, I love the woman, an' learned a lesson that I can't forget

</l>
<l>Yes, she's mean an' she's evil and now my life is in a solid mess



</l>
<l>Yeah...



</l>
<l>She wakes me in the mornin'

</l>
<l>Right before the break of day

</l>
<l>Tellin' me to get up and go out

</l>
<l>I had a earn myself some pay



</l>
<l>How she scolds me like an orphan

</l>
<l>And treats me like a clown

</l>
<l>And when I need some lovin'

</l>
<l>That woman can't be found



</l>
<l>And I love the woman

</l>
<l>And learned a lesson that I can't forget

</l>
<l>Yes, she's mean an' she's evil

</l>
<l>And now my life is in a solid mess!
