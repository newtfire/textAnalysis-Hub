<lyrics>



I keep laughing

Through the tears I cry

No way life is getting to me

We're all out there

Gotta live and die

No one's above it

May as well love it



Face the music

This is your time to dance

Let your life roll on

When they hit you

Just get up

And go another round



Oh baby, don't you know

I know the lowdown

Everything that's going up

Must go down

Speed it up or slow down

Life's a merry-go-round

Ride it high

'Cause we all hit the ground



I had money

And it all slipped away

Guess I didn't really, really need it

I can make it

Living day to day

Don't look for answers

Follow the dancers



Face the music

'Cause they're playing your tune

Let the night roll on

Take it from me

'Cause I've been the long

Long way around



Oh baby, don't you know

I know the lowdown

Everything that's going up

Must go down

Speed it up or slow down

Life's a merry-go-round

Ride it high

'Cause we all hit the ground
