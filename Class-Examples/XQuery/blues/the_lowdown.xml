<lyrics>


<l>I keep laughing

</l>
<l>Through the tears I cry

</l>
<l>No way life is getting to me

</l>
<l>We're all out there

</l>
<l>Gotta live and die

</l>
<l>No one's above it

</l>
<l>May as well love it



</l>
<l>Face the music

</l>
<l>This is your time to dance

</l>
<l>Let your life roll on

</l>
<l>When they hit you

</l>
<l>Just get up

</l>
<l>And go another round



</l>
<l>Oh baby, don't you know

</l>
<l>I know the lowdown

</l>
<l>Everything that's going up

</l>
<l>Must go down

</l>
<l>Speed it up or slow down

</l>
<l>Life's a merry-go-round

</l>
<l>Ride it high

</l>
<l>'Cause we all hit the ground



</l>
<l>I had money

</l>
<l>And it all slipped away

</l>
<l>Guess I didn't really, really need it

</l>
<l>I can make it

</l>
<l>Living day to day

</l>
<l>Don't look for answers

</l>
<l>Follow the dancers



</l>
<l>Face the music

</l>
<l>'Cause they're playing your tune

</l>
<l>Let the night roll on

</l>
<l>Take it from me

</l>
<l>'Cause I've been the long

</l>
<l>Long way around



</l>
<l>Oh baby, don't you know

</l>
<l>I know the lowdown

</l>
<l>Everything that's going up

</l>
<l>Must go down

</l>
<l>Speed it up or slow down

</l>
<l>Life's a merry-go-round

</l>
<l>Ride it high

</l>
<l>'Cause we all hit the ground</l></lyrics></xml>
