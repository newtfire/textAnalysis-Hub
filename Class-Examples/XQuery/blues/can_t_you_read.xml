<lyrics>



Way back in the nineteen hundred and ten

The monkey and the baboon, they came walkin' in

The monkey told the baboon, "Let's shoot a game a pool"

The monkey could shoot, but the baboon wasn't no fool



Next thing came along was a little mule

He said, "You know I'm so mad, I even can't wear no shoe"

Next thing came along, there was Mr. Cat

"We ain't gonna have no such a-stuff goin' on here like that"

Next thing came, was a little mouse,

"Let's all get drunk an' break up this doggone house"



Can't you read, now can't you read

If you keep on readin' I'm bound to put you out



Well, the monkey an' the elephant, they went out for a little
drive

The elephant hit the monkey right square in his eye

The monkey looked up with a tear an' a sigh

Said, "Look at here big boy, you oughta get someone your size,

One of these days I'm gonna climb your tree,

Remember big boy you gotta march right under me"

"When you march under me, you better march careful 'n fast,

I'll get me a limb an' break it 'cross your...

Now can't you read, now can't you read

If you keep on readin', I'm bound to put you out



If anybody just happen to ask you

Where the weddin' gonna be?

Come right down there on Hazen street

Cold down there just about the end of the week

You can get most anything that you care to eat

If you don't like shrimp, just name your dish

They'll even serve you some a that ol' fillet fish



Now can't you read, now can't you read

If you keep on reading, mama, I'm bound to put you out



Yeah, play it Mr. Maceo! (piano)



Well, fifteen cents you know that's the regular price

If you got two fifteen, we'll even serve you twice

Can't you read, now can't you read

If you keep on reading, I'm bound to put you out

Note: vocals by Big Maceo and Tampa Red;

Note 1: "The last line in the 3rd verse is missing a word at the end
on purpose. The word is "ass" but he doesn't sing it (rhymes with
fast) and I guess the listener is suppose to fill in the blank. Can
you imagine they didn't sing "bad words" back then?", Anita Cantor
