<l>Now, go get the night light, somethin' gettin' wrong with my
Fridgidaire
1

</l>
<l>Go get the light, now, somethin' gettin' wrong with my
Fridgidaire

</l>
<l>Well now, what's gettin' to matter with it, it takes God, you know,
in this world to tell



</l>
<l>Now, I just brought me a Fridgidaire and I brought me a kitchen set,
too

</l>
<l>Now, I brought me a brand new Fridgidaire, I brought me a kitchen set
too

</l>
<l>Well, said I been lookin 'round all over this town, I swear, I want
none of these women blue



</l>
<l>Now I have me coffee early in the mo'nin', I want you to have me tea
at night

</l>
<l>I need coffee sweet, early in the mo'nin', I want you to have me tea
at night

</l>
<l>Well 'n if I can't get my tea three times a day, mama, it look like
me an you can't get along right



</l>
<l>Now, but that's alright mama, I don't like the way you do

</l>
<l>No, but that's alright mama, baby, I don't like the way you do

</l>
<l>Well, but I been tryin' two or three days, woman, you know just to
get rid of you

<note>Note 1: Fridgidaire, the first big (U.S.) brand name in automatic
refrigerators. Automatic because, instead of putting the ice in
yourself, a sealed refrigerant kept the box cold</note></lyrics></xml>
