<l>Sugar mama, sugar mama, sugar mama please come back to me

</l>
<l>Sugar mama, sugar mama, sugar mama please come back to me

</l>
<l>Bring me my granulated sugar

, sugar mama, and try to ease
my misery



</l>
<l>You've got this new grade of sugar, sugar mama, an you done made me
love it too

</l>
<l>You've got this new grade of sugar, sugar mama, an you done made me
love it too

</l>
<l>You've got this granulated sugar, sugar mama, ain't nobody else got,
but you



</l>
<l>They been braggin' 'bout your sugar, sugar mama, been braggin' all
over town

</l>
<l>They been braggin' 'bout your sugar, sugar mama, braggin' all over
town

</l>
<l>Now, the bootleggers
2
want you to sell 'em enough to make </l>
<l>whiskey,

</l>
<l>but you won't sell 'em about four or five pounds



</l>
<l>I like my coffee sweet in the mornin', you know, an I'm crazy 'bout
my tea at night

</l>
<l>I like my coffee sweet in the mornin', you know, an I'm crazy 'bout
my tea at night

</l>
<l>Don't get my sugar three times a day, oh, Lord, then I don't feel
right
