<lyrics>



Sugar mama, sugar mama, sugar mama please come back to me

Sugar mama, sugar mama, sugar mama please come back to me

Bring me my granulated sugar
1
, sugar mama, and try to ease
my misery



You've got this new grade of sugar, sugar mama, an you done made me
love it too

You've got this new grade of sugar, sugar mama, an you done made me
love it too

You've got this granulated sugar, sugar mama, ain't nobody else got,
but you



They been braggin' 'bout your sugar, sugar mama, been braggin' all
over town

They been braggin' 'bout your sugar, sugar mama, braggin' all over
town

Now, the bootleggers
2
 want you to sell 'em enough to make
whiskey,

but you won't sell 'em about four or five pounds



I like my coffee sweet in the mornin', you know, an I'm crazy 'bout
my tea at night

I like my coffee sweet in the mornin', you know, an I'm crazy 'bout
my tea at night

Don't get my sugar three times a day, oh, Lord, then I don't feel
right
