<lyrics>



You had style, you had class

You had everything to make a love last

You had grace, you had charm

You had me hanging on your arm

When I found out you were a fake

You rared up and bit me like a snake

And I was ready to let go

And let all my feelings show



(Chorus:)

Tell me why you wanna be so cold

Why you wanna be so mean

You've gone and let your true colors show

You're a perpetual blues machine



We could have been just fine

If you'd have only been all mine

'Cause I was for real, but you did not know

That you were steppin' on my heart

As you were walkin' out the door

But now I know who you are

And it's a damn good thing we didn't get too far

'Cause I'm not the one that's right for you



You need a man to do your rolling

Like what you want him to do



(Chorus)



Now you've gone, and I'm glad

That we didn't let it go too bad

You know I tried to make it go

But there was just no way to tell u so



(Chorus)
