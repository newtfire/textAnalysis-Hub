<lyrics>


<l>You had style, you had class

</l>
<l>You had everything to make a love last

</l>
<l>You had grace, you had charm

</l>
<l>You had me hanging on your arm

</l>
<l>When I found out you were a fake

</l>
<l>You rared up and bit me like a snake

</l>
<l>And I was ready to let go

</l>
<l>And let all my feelings show



</l>
<l>(Chorus:)

</l>
<l>Tell me why you wanna be so cold

</l>
<l>Why you wanna be so mean

</l>
<l>You've gone and let your true colors show

</l>
<l>You're a perpetual blues machine



</l>
<l>We could have been just fine

</l>
<l>If you'd have only been all mine

</l>
<l>'Cause I was for real, but you did not know

</l>
<l>That you were steppin' on my heart

</l>
<l>As you were walkin' out the door

</l>
<l>But now I know who you are

</l>
<l>And it's a damn good thing we didn't get too far

</l>
<l>'Cause I'm not the one that's right for you



</l>
<l>You need a man to do your rolling

</l>
<l>Like what you want him to do



</l>
<l>(Chorus)



</l>
<l>Now you've gone, and I'm glad

</l>
<l>That we didn't let it go too bad

</l>
<l>You know I tried to make it go

</l>
<l>But there was just no way to tell u so



</l>
<l>(Chorus)</l></lyrics></xml>
