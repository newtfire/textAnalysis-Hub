<lyrics>



Makin' love is good for you

Makin' love is good for you

Makin' love is good for you

Makin' love is good for you

So take care of your body

Make a little love today



Ain't nobody can live forever

It's just something that we all understand

But while you're young, y'all

We can make it better

If we take care of our bodies while we can



'Cause makin' love is good for you

Makin' love is good for you

So take care of your body

Make a little love today



Man and woman get together

Play the game and swear they're havin' fun

But if we make a little love

From the very start

What a lovely way to getto know someone



So makin' love is good for you

Makin' love is good for you

So take care of your body

Make a little love today



Let the wise man think about it

I'll just put my thinkin' all on the shelf

But if the good Lord made something

Better than love

I swear he must've kept it there for myself



Hey, makin' love is good for you

Makin' love is good for you

So take care of your body

Make a little love today
