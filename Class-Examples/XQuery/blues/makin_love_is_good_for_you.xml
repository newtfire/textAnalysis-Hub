<l>Makin' love is good for you

</l>
<l>Makin' love is good for you

</l>
<l>Makin' love is good for you

</l>
<l>Makin' love is good for you

</l>
<l>So take care of your body

</l>
<l>Make a little love today



</l>
<l>Ain't nobody can live forever

</l>
<l>It's just something that we all understand

</l>
<l>But while you're young, y'all

</l>
<l>We can make it better

</l>
<l>If we take care of our bodies while we can



</l>
<l>'Cause makin' love is good for you

</l>
<l>Makin' love is good for you

</l>
<l>So take care of your body

</l>
<l>Make a little love today



</l>
<l>Man and woman get together

</l>
<l>Play the game and swear they're havin' fun

</l>
<l>But if we make a little love

</l>
<l>From the very start

</l>
<l>What a lovely way to getto know someone



</l>
<l>So makin' love is good for you

</l>
<l>Makin' love is good for you

</l>
<l>So take care of your body

</l>
<l>Make a little love today



</l>
<l>Let the wise man think about it

</l>
<l>I'll just put my thinkin' all on the shelf

</l>
<l>But if the good Lord made something

</l>
<l>Better than love

</l>
<l>I swear he must've kept it there for myself



</l>
<l>Hey, makin' love is good for you

</l>
<l>Makin' love is good for you

</l>
<l>So take care of your body

</l>
<l>Make a little love today</l></lyrics></xml>
