<lyrics>



Judge you wanna hear my plea, before you open up your
court

But I don't want no sympathy, 'cause I done cut my good man's
throat



I caught him with a trifling Jane, I warned him 'bout before

I had my knife and went insane, and the rest you ought to know



Judge, judge, please mister judge, send me to the 'lectric chair

Judge, judge, good mister judge, let me go away from here



I wanna take a journey, to the devil down below

I done killed my man, I wanna reap just what I sow



Oh judge, judge, lordy lordy judge, send me to the 'lectric chair

Judge, judge, hear me judge, send me to the 'lectric chair



I love him so dear, I cut him with my barlow
1
, I kicked
him in the side

I stood here laughing o'r him, while he wallowed around and died



Oh judge, judge, lordy judge, send me to the 'lectric chair

Judge, judge, sweet mister judge, send me to the 'lectric chair

Judge, judge, good kind judge, burn me 'cause I don't care



I don't want no one good mayor, to go my bail

I don't want to spend no, ninety-nine years in jail

So judge, judge, good kind judge, send me to the 'lectric chair



__________

Note 1: barlow, a sturdy inexpensive jackknife.
