<lyrics>

<l>Judge you wanna hear my plea, before you open up your
court

</l>
<l>But I don't want no sympathy, 'cause I done cut my good man's
throat



</l>
<l>I caught him with a trifling Jane, I warned him 'bout before

</l>
<l>I had my knife and went insane, and the rest you ought to know



</l>
<l>Judge, judge, please mister judge, send me to the 'lectric chair

</l>
<l>Judge, judge, good mister judge, let me go away from here



</l>
<l>I wanna take a journey, to the devil down below

</l>
<l>I done killed my man, I wanna reap just what I sow



</l>
<l>Oh judge, judge, lordy lordy judge, send me to the 'lectric chair

</l>
<l>Judge, judge, hear me judge, send me to the 'lectric chair



</l>
<l>I love him so dear, I cut him with my barlow
1
, I kicked
him in the side

</l>
<l>I stood here laughing o'r him, while he wallowed around and died



</l>
<l>Oh judge, judge, lordy judge, send me to the 'lectric chair

</l>
<l>Judge, judge, sweet mister judge, send me to the 'lectric chair

</l>
<l>Judge, judge, good kind judge, burn me 'cause I don't care



</l>
<l>I don't want no one good mayor, to go my bail

</l>
<l>I don't want to spend no, ninety-nine years in jail

</l>
<l>So judge, judge, good kind judge, send me to the 'lectric chair



</l>
