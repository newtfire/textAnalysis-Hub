<lyrics>



Early this mornin', when you knocked upon my door

Early this mornin', ooh, when you knocked upon my door

And I said, "hello, satan, I believe it's time to go"



Me and the devil, was walkin' side by side

Me and the devil, ooh, was walkin' side by side

I'm goin' to beat my woman, until I get satisfied



She say you don't see why, that I will dog her 'round

(spoken: Now, baby, you know you ain't doin' me right, now)

She say you don't see why, ooh, that I will dog her 'round

It must-a be that old evil spirit, so deep down in the ground



You may bury my body, down by the highway side

(spoken: Baby, I don't care where you bury my body when I'm dead and
gone)

You may bury my body, ooh, down by the highway side

So my old evil spirit, can get a Greyhound bus and ride
