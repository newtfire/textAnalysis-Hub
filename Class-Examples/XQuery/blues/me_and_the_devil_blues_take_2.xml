<lyrics>


<l>Early this mornin', when you knocked upon my door

</l>
<l>Early this mornin', ooh, when you knocked upon my door

</l>
<l>And I said, "hello, satan, I believe it's time to go"



</l>
<l>Me and the devil, was walkin' side by side

</l>
<l>Me and the devil, ooh, was walkin' side by side

</l>
<l>I'm goin' to beat my woman, until I get satisfied



</l>
<l>She say you don't see why, that I will dog her 'round

</l>
<l>(spoken: Now, baby, you know you ain't doin' me right, now)

</l>
<l>She say you don't see why, ooh, that I will dog her 'round

</l>
<l>It must-a be that old evil spirit, so deep down in the ground



</l>
<l>You may bury my body, down by the highway side

</l>
<l>(spoken: Baby, I don't care where you bury my body when I'm dead and
gone)

</l>
<l>You may bury my body, ooh, down by the highway side

</l>
<l>So my old evil spirit, can get a Greyhound bus and ride</l></lyrics></xml>
