<lyrics>

<l>I hear these women raving 'bout their 
monkey
men

</l>
<l>About their trifling
1
husbands and their no good </l>
<l>friends

</l>
<l>These poor women sit around all day and moan

</l>
<l>Wondering why their wandering papa's don't come home

</l>
<l>But wild women don't worry, wild women don't have no blues



</l>
<l>Now when you've got a man, don't never be on the square

</l>
<l>'Cause if you do he'll have a woman everywhere

</l>
<l>I never was known to treat no one man right

</l>
<l>I keep 'em working hard both day and night

</l>
<l>'Cause wild women don't worry, wild women don't have their blues



</l>
<l>I've got a disposition and a way of my own

</l>
<l>When my man starts kicking I let him find another home

</l>
<l>I get full of good liquor, walk the streets all night

</l>
<l>Go home and put my man out if he don't act right

</l>
<l>Wild women don't worry, wild women don't have their blues



</l>
<l>You never get nothing by being an angel child

</l>
<l>You better change your ways and get real wild

</l>
<l>I wanna tell you something, I wouldn't tell you a lie

</l>
<l>Wild women are the only kind that really get by

</l>
<l>'Cause wild women don't worry, wild women don't have their blues
