<lyrics>



This is hip pretty baby

This is hip pretty baby

This is hip pretty baby

I messed around and fell in love



You know you called me up on your telephone

You want me to take you for a ride

This is hip pretty baby

This is hip pretty baby

This is hip pretty baby

I messed around and fell in love



Will you come to my house and you dance with me

You hold me tight and you kiss me too

This is hip pretty baby

This is hip pretty baby

This is hip pretty baby

You gonna kiss me baby

I messed around and fell in love, ooh yeah



When you call me up, you talk a long time

You talk to me over your telephone

You tellin' me, your comin' round over baby

This is hip pretty baby

This is hip pretty baby

This is hip pretty baby

I messed around and fell in love



When you blasting me, you rock me too

You rock my soul and set on fire

This is hip pretty baby

This is hip pretty baby

This is hip pretty baby

I messed around and fell in love



You been a rockin' good way

You been a rockin' good way

You been a rockin' good way

I messed around and fell in love
