<lyrics>

<l>I dreamed last night I was far from harm

</l>
<l>Woke up and found my man in a sissy's
1
arms </l>

<l>"Hello, Central, it's 'bout to run me wild

</l>
<l>Can I get that number, or will I have to wait a while?"



</l>
<l>Some are young, some are old

</l>
<l>My man says sissy's got good jelly roll



</l>
<l>My man got a sissy, his name is Miss Kate

</l>
<l>He shook that thing like jelly on a plate



</l>
<l>Now all the people ask me why I'm all alone

</l>
<l>A sissy shook that thing and took my man from me



</l>
