<lyrics>



I dreamed last night I was far from harm

Woke up and found my man in a sissy's
1
 arms



"Hello, Central, it's 'bout to run me wild

Can I get that number, or will I have to wait a while?"



Some are young, some are old

My man says sissy's got good jelly roll



My man got a sissy, his name is Miss Kate

He shook that thing like jelly on a plate



Now all the people ask me why I'm all alone

A sissy shook that thing and took my man from me



__________

Note 1: sissy, homosexual.
