<lyrics>



Come to me baby, come to me C.O.D.

Come to me baby, come to me C.O.D.

I can't stand these blues, they're too much for me



You know special delivery, return so many line

Ah special delivery, return too many line

I don't want no credit, just let me love you 'til I die



You know some will like to argue, every time they take a drink

I don't have time to do either one if our love is on the blink

Come to me baby, come to me C.O.D.

Put my money on my honey, cash on delivery



Ah special delivery, return so many line

You know special delivery return, too many line

Don't give me no credit, just let me love you 'til I die, yeah



You know some will like to argue, every time they take a drink

I don't have time to do either one when our love is on the blink

Come to me baby, come to me C.O.D.

Put my money on my honey, cash on delivery



Come to me baby, come to me C.O.D.

Oh come to me baby, come to me C.O.D.

'Cause I can't stand these blues, they're too much for me, oh



Oh baby, baby, come on, make it C.O.D, come here baby

Oh listen baby, I need you right now, can't you come right away

Make it C.O.D., oh, C.O.D.
