<lyrics>


<l>Come to me baby, come to me C.O.D.

</l>
<l>Come to me baby, come to me C.O.D.

</l>
<l>I can't stand these blues, they're too much for me



</l>
<l>You know special delivery, return so many line

</l>
<l>Ah special delivery, return too many line

</l>
<l>I don't want no credit, just let me love you 'til I die



</l>
<l>You know some will like to argue, every time they take a drink

</l>
<l>I don't have time to do either one if our love is on the blink

</l>
<l>Come to me baby, come to me C.O.D.

</l>
<l>Put my money on my honey, cash on delivery



</l>
<l>Ah special delivery, return so many line

</l>
<l>You know special delivery return, too many line

</l>
<l>Don't give me no credit, just let me love you 'til I die, yeah



</l>
<l>You know some will like to argue, every time they take a drink

</l>
<l>I don't have time to do either one when our love is on the blink

</l>
<l>Come to me baby, come to me C.O.D.

</l>
<l>Put my money on my honey, cash on delivery



</l>
<l>Come to me baby, come to me C.O.D.

</l>
<l>Oh come to me baby, come to me C.O.D.

</l>
<l>'Cause I can't stand these blues, they're too much for me, oh



</l>
<l>Oh baby, baby, come on, make it C.O.D, come here baby

</l>
<l>Oh listen baby, I need you right now, can't you come right away

</l>
<l>Make it C.O.D., oh, C.O.D.
