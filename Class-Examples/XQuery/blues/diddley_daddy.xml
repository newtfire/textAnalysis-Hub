<lyrics>



Diddley Diddley daddy

Diddley Diddley daddy



I got a baby that's oh so pretty,

I found her right here in the Windy City

Somebody kissed my baby last night,

my pretty baby cried, you know it wasn't right



Diddley Diddley daddy

Diddley Diddley daddy



My baby started to cry in vain,

say, "Bo Diddley, you know you're a natural born man"

I say I love you baby with all my heart,

please don't never say we'll part.



Diddley Diddley daddy

Diddley Diddley daddy



Bo Diddley, Bo Diddley here's our scene,

I want to know if you do love me



Diddley Diddley daddy

Diddley Diddley daddy
