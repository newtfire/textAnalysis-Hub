<lyrics>



I'm gonna tell you about my baby

I speak of her with pride

She go all the way to make me satisfied

Oh she's my baby, she's my baby, don't you see

I can't call her sugar 'cause sugar never was so sweet



It ain't no suprise, she serve me in the bed

She manicure my nails, scratch dandruff from my head

She's my baby, she's my baby, don't you see

I can't call her sugar 'cause sugar never was so sweet



When I say what I want, that's the way it's gonna be

She fall over backwards to go right on pleasin' me

Oh she's my baby, she's my baby, can't you see

I can't call her sugar 'cause sugar never was so sweet
