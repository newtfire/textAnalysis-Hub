<lyrics>


<l>I'm gonna tell you about my baby

</l>
<l>I speak of her with pride

</l>
<l>She go all the way to make me satisfied

</l>
<l>Oh she's my baby, she's my baby, don't you see

</l>
<l>I can't call her sugar 'cause sugar never was so sweet



</l>
<l>It ain't no suprise, she serve me in the bed

</l>
<l>She manicure my nails, scratch dandruff from my head

</l>
<l>She's my baby, she's my baby, don't you see

</l>
<l>I can't call her sugar 'cause sugar never was so sweet



</l>
<l>When I say what I want, that's the way it's gonna be

</l>
<l>She fall over backwards to go right on pleasin' me

</l>
<l>Oh she's my baby, she's my baby, can't you see

</l>
<l>I can't call her sugar 'cause sugar never was so sweet</l></lyrics></xml>
