<lyrics>



I've got papers on you baby

You gotta do what I say

I've got papers on you baby

You gotta do what I say

I mean business woman

I've got too old to play



I've got papers on you baby

And I mean you're mine all mine

I've got papers on you baby

And I mean you're mine all mine

Well, if you do what I tell you woman

We've got to get along real fine



Yes, the red light means stop

The green light means go

Tell you something once

I ain't gonna tell you no more

I've got papers on you baby

You gotta do what I say

I've got old baby

And I'm too old to play



Well, now I'll see that you eat

And see that you have a place to stay

Well, now I'll see that you eat

And see that you have a place to stay

Yes, but as long as you stay in this house

I ain't gonna let you have your way



I've got papers on you baby

I mean it in black and white

I've got papers on you baby

I mean it in black and white

Well you're hard to get along with

But you just gotta treat me right
