<l>I've got papers on you baby

</l>
<l>You gotta do what I say

</l>
<l>I've got papers on you baby

</l>
<l>You gotta do what I say

</l>
<l>I mean business woman

</l>
<l>I've got too old to play



</l>
<l>I've got papers on you baby

</l>
<l>And I mean you're mine all mine

</l>
<l>I've got papers on you baby

</l>
<l>And I mean you're mine all mine

</l>
<l>Well, if you do what I tell you woman

</l>
<l>We've got to get along real fine



</l>
<l>Yes, the red light means stop

</l>
<l>The green light means go

</l>
<l>Tell you something once

</l>
<l>I ain't gonna tell you no more

</l>
<l>I've got papers on you baby

</l>
<l>You gotta do what I say

</l>
<l>I've got old baby

</l>
<l>And I'm too old to play



</l>
<l>Well, now I'll see that you eat

</l>
<l>And see that you have a place to stay

</l>
<l>Well, now I'll see that you eat

</l>
<l>And see that you have a place to stay

</l>
<l>Yes, but as long as you stay in this house

</l>
<l>I ain't gonna let you have your way



</l>
<l>I've got papers on you baby

</l>
<l>I mean it in black and white

</l>
<l>I've got papers on you baby

</l>
<l>I mean it in black and white

</l>
<l>Well you're hard to get along with

</l>
<l>But you just gotta treat me right</l></lyrics></xml>
