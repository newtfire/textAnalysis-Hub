<lyrics>



My gal keeps me cryin'

My gal keeps me cryin'

Wringin' my hands and cryin'

Oh Lord, make her treat me right

I done got so

I can't stand her out of my sight



She's the best love I ever had

The best love I ever had

But sometime

My baby knows she makes me mad

Sometimes she makes me happy

Then again she makes feel so sad



Hey, she's the best love I ever had

The best love I ever had

But sometime

My baby knows she makes me mad

Sometimes she makes me happy

Then again she makes feel so sad
