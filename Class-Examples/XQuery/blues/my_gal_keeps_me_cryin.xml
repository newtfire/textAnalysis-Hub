<l>My gal keeps me cryin'

</l>
<l>My gal keeps me cryin'

</l>
<l>Wringin' my hands and cryin'

</l>
<l>Oh Lord, make her treat me right

</l>
<l>I done got so

</l>
<l>I can't stand her out of my sight



</l>
<l>She's the best love I ever had

</l>
<l>The best love I ever had

</l>
<l>But sometime

</l>
<l>My baby knows she makes me mad

</l>
<l>Sometimes she makes me happy

</l>
<l>Then again she makes feel so sad



</l>
<l>Hey, she's the best love I ever had

</l>
<l>The best love I ever had

</l>
<l>But sometime

</l>
<l>My baby knows she makes me mad

</l>
<l>Sometimes she makes me happy

</l><l>Then again she makes feel so sad</l></lyrics></xml>
