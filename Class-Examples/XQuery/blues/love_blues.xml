<lyrics>



I love the way you love me and I love the way you comb your
hair

I love the way you love me, baby, love the way you comb your hair

If it would left up to me, babe, you would never 
...



Hey, sweet mama, baby, don't you go too far

Hey, sweet mama, baby, don't you go too far

I wanna know every minute who you're with and where you are



I love you, baby, so please don't you leave me here all alone

I can't stand it, baby, when you leave me here all alone

So whenever you decide to go, baby, just don't stay gone too long



I love you, baby, I just can't leave you alone

You know, I love you, baby, and I just can't leave you alone

I love you baby just like a dog loves a bone



I'm gonna wrap my arms around you and squeeze you till I cry

I'm gonna wrap my arms around you, squeeze you till I cry (yes, I
am)

Gonna keep on loving you, baby, till the day I die



(It's gonna be a long time)
