<lyrics>


<l>I love the way you love me and I love the way you comb your
hair

</l>
<l>I love the way you love me, baby, love the way you comb your hair

</l>
<l>If it would left up to me, babe, you would never 

...




</l>
<l>Hey, sweet mama, baby, don't you go too far

</l>
<l>Hey, sweet mama, baby, don't you go too far

</l>
<l>I wanna know every minute who you're with and where you are



</l>
<l>I love you, baby, so please don't you leave me here all alone

</l>
<l>I can't stand it, baby, when you leave me here all alone

</l>
<l>So whenever you decide to go, baby, just don't stay gone too long



</l>
<l>I love you, baby, I just can't leave you alone

</l>
<l>You know, I love you, baby, and I just can't leave you alone

</l>
<l>I love you baby just like a dog loves a bone



</l>
<l>I'm gonna wrap my arms around you and squeeze you till I cry

</l>
<l>I'm gonna wrap my arms around you, squeeze you till I cry (yes, I
am)

</l>
<l>Gonna keep on loving you, baby, till the day I die



</l>
<l>(It's gonna be a long time)



</l>
