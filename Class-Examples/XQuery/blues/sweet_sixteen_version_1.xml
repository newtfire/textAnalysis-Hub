(spoken:

How about it?, how about it?, it takes a lot of people to make it
possible,

so give 'em a big hand. Everybody is working to try to make it
nicer.

Anyway! As I leave you... a little bit of Sweet Sixteen for the guys
-

just a taste - give me C for Sweet Sixteen...)



When I first met you baby, baby you were just sweet sixteen

First met you baby, baby you was just sweet sixteen

Just left your home then baby, oh the sweetest thing I'd ever
seen



But you wouldn't do nothing for me baby, you wouldn't do anything I
asked you to

You wouldn't do nothing for me baby, oh you wouldn't do anything I
asked you to

You know you ran away from your home baby, and now you wanna run away
from old me too



My brother's in Korea baby, my sister's down in New Orleans

Brother's in Korea baby, oh sister sister down in New Orleans

You know I'm having so much troubles people,

baby I wonder what in the world is gonna happen to me



Oh yes sweet sixteen baby, sweet sixteen, oh yes

The sweetest thing baby, oh yes

The sweetest thing I ever seen

You know I'm having so much trouble people,

baby I wonder what in the world's gonna happen to me



Sweet sixteen, sweet sixteen oh yes

You know I'm having so much trouble people

Baby I wonder

Yes I wonder

Baby I wonder

I wonder what in the world's gonna happen to me
