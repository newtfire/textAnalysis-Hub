<l>(spoken:

</l>
<l>How about it?, how about it?, it takes a lot of people to make it
possible,

</l>
<l>so give 'em a big hand. Everybody is working to try to make it
nicer.

</l>
<l>Anyway! As I leave you... a little bit of Sweet Sixteen for the guys
-

</l>
<l>just a taste - give me C for Sweet Sixteen...)



</l>
<l>When I first met you baby, baby you were just sweet sixteen

</l>
<l>First met you baby, baby you was just sweet sixteen

</l>
<l>Just left your home then baby, oh the sweetest thing I'd ever

seen




</l>
<l>But you wouldn't do nothing for me baby, you wouldn't do anything I
asked you to

</l>
<l>You wouldn't do nothing for me baby, oh you wouldn't do anything I
asked you to

</l>
<l>You know you ran away from your home baby, and now you wanna run away

from old me too




</l>
<l>My brother's in Korea baby, my sister's down in New Orleans

</l>
<l>Brother's in Korea baby, oh sister sister down in New Orleans

</l>
<l>You know I'm having so much troubles people,

</l>
<l>baby I wonder what in the world is gonna happen to me



</l>
<l>Oh yes sweet sixteen baby, sweet sixteen, oh yes

</l>
<l>The sweetest thing baby, oh yes

</l>
<l>The sweetest thing I ever seen

</l>
<l>You know I'm having so much trouble people,

</l>
<l>baby I wonder what in the world's gonna happen to me



</l>
<l>Sweet sixteen, sweet sixteen oh yes

</l>
<l>You know I'm having so much trouble people

</l>
<l>Baby I wonder
