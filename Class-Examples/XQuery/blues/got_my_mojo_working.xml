<l>Got my 
mojo
working, but </l>
<l>it just won't work on you

</l>
<l>Got my mojo working, but it just won't work on you

</l>
<l>I wanna love you so bad till I don't know what to do



</l>
<l>I'm going down to Louisiana to get me a mojo hand

</l>
<l>I'm going down to Louisiana to get me a mojo hand

</l>
<l>I'm gonna have all you women right here at my command



</l>
<l>Got my mojo working

<note>Note: the original version of Got My Mojo Working was sung in a jump
blues style by 
Ann
Cole
. She performed the song on stage in 1956, which was how
Muddy Waters found the song!. Muddy Waters adapted it to his style
but the bassline is still the same. The song can be found on the 1999
Rhino Records anthology album 
Jump,
Jive &amp; Swing
. These are the lyrics to the original version as
sung by Ann Cole and written by 
Preston
Foster
:



I got my 
black cat
bone
, all pure and dry

I got a 
four-leaf
clover
, all hangin' high



Got my 
hoodoo
 ashes all
around your bead

Got my black snake roots underneath your head



I got my 
mojo
 workin', but
it just won't work on you

I want to love you so, till I don't know what to do



I got a gypsy woman givin' me advice

I got some red hot tips I got to keep on ice



I got a 
rabbit
foot
, I know it's workin' right

I got a strand of hair I'm keepin' day and night
