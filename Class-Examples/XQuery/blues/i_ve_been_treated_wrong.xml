<lyrics>


<l>I don't know my name, I don't know when I was born

</l>
<l>I don't know my real name, don't know when I was born

</l>
<l>The trouble I've been havin', seem like I was raised in a orphan

home




</l>
<l>My mother died an left me, when I was only two years old

</l>
<l>My mother died an left me, when I was two years old

</l>
<l>An' the trouble I've been havin', the Good Lord, only knows



</l>
<l>I've been treated like an orphan, an' been workin' like a slave

</l>
<l>I've been treated like an orphan, an' I've been workin' like a
slave

</l>
<l>An' if I never get my revenge, evilness will carry me to my grave



</l>
<l>Now I've been havin' trouble, ever since I've been grown

</l>
<l>Lord knows, I've been havin' trouble, trouble, trouble, ever since I
was grown

</l><l>Well I'm too old for the orphans, an' too young for the old folks</l>
