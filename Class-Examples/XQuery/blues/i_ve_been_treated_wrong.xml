<lyrics>



I don't know my name, I don't know when I was born

I don't know my real name, don't know when I was born

The trouble I've been havin', seem like I was raised in a orphan
home



My mother died an left me, when I was only two years old

My mother died an left me, when I was two years old

An' the trouble I've been havin', the Good Lord, only knows



I've been treated like an orphan, an' been workin' like a slave

I've been treated like an orphan, an' I've been workin' like a
slave

An' if I never get my revenge, evilness will carry me to my grave



Now I've been havin' trouble, ever since I've been grown

Lord knows, I've been havin' trouble, trouble, trouble, ever since I
was grown

Well I'm too old for the orphans, an' too young for the old folks
home
