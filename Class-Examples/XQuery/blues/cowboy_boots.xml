<lyrics>



All my life I've been tryin' to save

To get a pair of cowboy boots

Sixteen years of my life I gave

To get a pair of cowboy boots



I wanna go where the money's free

Hollywood is callin' me

Oh what a great big star I'll be

In a pair of cowboy boots



I'm gonna get on a t.v. show

In a pair of cowboy boots

I'm gonna ride in a rodeo-ooo

In a pair of cowboy boots



I wanna go where the badman lurk

Get me a job an' go to work

Give a lesson to Wyatt Earp

In a pair of cowboy boots



Oh give me a home

Where the swimmin' pools roll on

Where the money grows on trees

And the gals just wanna be squeezed



I'm gonna get there if I have to crawl

To get a pair of cowboy boots

Get in the movies and that ain't all

In a pair of cowboy boots



I'm gonna get me a leather vest

Gun on my hip and star on my chest

I'll be the tale of the golden west

In a pair of cowboy boots



Oh give me a home

Where the swimmin' pools roll on

Where the money grows on trees

And the gals just wanna be squeezed



I'm gonna get there if I have to crawl

To get a pair of cowboy boots

Get in the movies and that ain't all

In a pair of cowboy boots



I'm gonna get me a leather vest

Gun on my hip a star on my chest

I'll be the tale of the golden west

In a pair of cowboy boots
