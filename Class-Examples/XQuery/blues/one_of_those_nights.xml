<lyrics>



Come here, baby

Let me wrap you around my fingers

I want you so much

And love's just a touch away

So touch me, baby

And you'll feel a man on fire

Just hold on to me

'Cause it's gonna be one of those nights



Oh one of those nights

When love has us right in its hands

Oh here in the dark

What you do to my heart

Woman, your wonder don't end

And it's one of those nights

One of those nights again



Darling, I know

I know this ain't no time for talking

But you know I've just got to tell you

I just have to tell you

How I feel right now

And I wanna say, baby, you're something

And I'm wrapped around your finger

I want you again

'Cause I'm so far into one of those nights



Oh one of those nights

When love has us right in its hands

Oh here in the dark

What you do to my heart

Woman, your wonder don't end

And it's one of those nights

One of those nights again
