<lyrics>


<l>Come here, baby

</l>
<l>Let me wrap you around my fingers

</l>
<l>I want you so much

</l>
<l>And love's just a touch away

</l>
<l>So touch me, baby

</l>
<l>And you'll feel a man on fire

</l>
<l>Just hold on to me

</l>
<l>'Cause it's gonna be one of those nights



</l>
<l>Oh one of those nights

</l>
<l>When love has us right in its hands

</l>
<l>Oh here in the dark

</l>
<l>What you do to my heart

</l>
<l>Woman, your wonder don't end

</l>
<l>And it's one of those nights

</l>
<l>One of those nights again



</l>
<l>Darling, I know

</l>
<l>I know this ain't no time for talking

</l>
<l>But you know I've just got to tell you

</l>
<l>I just have to tell you

</l>
<l>How I feel right now

</l>
<l>And I wanna say, baby, you're something

</l>
<l>And I'm wrapped around your finger

</l>
<l>I want you again

</l>
<l>'Cause I'm so far into one of those nights



</l>
<l>Oh one of those nights

</l>
<l>When love has us right in its hands

</l>
<l>Oh here in the dark

</l>
<l>What you do to my heart

</l>
<l>Woman, your wonder don't end

</l>
<l>And it's one of those nights

</l><l>One of those nights again</l></lyrics></xml>
