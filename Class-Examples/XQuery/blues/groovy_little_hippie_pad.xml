<l>I'm gonna find me a groovy little hippie pad

</l>
<l>I'm gonna find me a groovy little hippie pad

</l>
<l>I work a hundred grand scam from a border town

</l>
<l>Well, I'll be feeling glad



</l>
<l>I'm gonna find me a blonde-haired mama, in a Jeep with a German
shepherd by her side

</l>
<l>I'm gonna find me a blonde-haired mama, with boots and a .44 on her
side

</l>
<l>And if I ain't too high or used up, I'll have her take me for a

groovy little hippie ride




</l>
<l>I'm gonna fix brown rice every day, and drink down a bottle of
Midnight Red

</l>
<l>I'm gonna fix brown rice every day, and drink down a bottle of
Midnight Red

</l><l>That's all I need to get groovy, that's what all the little hippie</l>
<l>said</l></lyrics></xml>
