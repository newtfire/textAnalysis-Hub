<lyrics>



I'm gonna find me a groovy little hippie pad

I'm gonna find me a groovy little hippie pad

I work a hundred grand scam from a border town

Well, I'll be feeling glad



I'm gonna find me a blonde-haired mama, in a Jeep with a German
shepherd by her side

I'm gonna find me a blonde-haired mama, with boots and a .44 on her
side

And if I ain't too high or used up, I'll have her take me for a
groovy little hippie ride



I'm gonna fix brown rice every day, and drink down a bottle of
Midnight Red

I'm gonna fix brown rice every day, and drink down a bottle of
Midnight Red

That's all I need to get groovy, that's what all the little hippie
said
