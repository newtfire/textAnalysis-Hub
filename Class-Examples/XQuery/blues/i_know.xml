<lyrics>



I know you don't love me no more

No more, no, no more

And I don't wanna be hurt anymore

Anymore

I love so hard

Everything I did was no joy

If I can't love you right, baby

I don't have to love you at all



I know you don't want me no more

No more, no, no more

And I need someone else

Who's gonna love me more

Love me more

Ain't no need me cryin' now

After you have put me down

If you don't want me no more, baby

Ain't no use you hangin' round



I know you don't want me no more

No more, no, no more

And I need someone else

Who's gonna love me more

Love me more

Ain't no need me cryin' now

After you have put me down

If you don't want me no more, baby

Ain't no use you hangin' round



I know you don't want me no more

I know, I know

And I don't wanna be hurt anymore

Anymore

Love me more

After you have put me down

Ain't no use you hangin' round

You don't want me no more, baby

Ain't no use you hangin' round
