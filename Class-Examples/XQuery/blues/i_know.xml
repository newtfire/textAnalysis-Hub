<lyrics>


<l>I know you don't love me no more

</l>
<l>No more, no, no more

</l>
<l>And I don't wanna be hurt anymore

</l>
<l>Anymore

</l>
<l>I love so hard

</l>
<l>Everything I did was no joy

</l>
<l>If I can't love you right, baby

</l>
<l>I don't have to love you at all



</l>
<l>I know you don't want me no more

</l>
<l>No more, no, no more

</l>
<l>And I need someone else

</l>
<l>Who's gonna love me more

</l>
<l>Love me more

</l>
<l>Ain't no need me cryin' now

</l>
<l>After you have put me down

</l>
<l>If you don't want me no more, baby

</l>
<l>Ain't no use you hangin' round



</l>
<l>I know you don't want me no more

</l>
<l>No more, no, no more

</l>
<l>And I need someone else

</l>
<l>Who's gonna love me more

</l>
<l>Love me more

</l>
<l>Ain't no need me cryin' now

</l>
<l>After you have put me down

</l>
<l>If you don't want me no more, baby

</l>
<l>Ain't no use you hangin' round



</l>
<l>I know you don't want me no more

</l>
<l>I know, I know

</l>
<l>And I don't wanna be hurt anymore

</l>
<l>Anymore

</l>
<l>Love me more

</l>
<l>After you have put me down

</l>
<l>Ain't no use you hangin' round

</l>
<l>You don't want me no more, baby

</l>
<l>Ain't no use you hangin' round</l></lyrics></xml>
