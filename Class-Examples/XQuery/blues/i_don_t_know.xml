<lyrics>



You tell me that you love me

That you really care

We've talked it out

We did our best

And still it ain't going nowhere



It feels like our forever

just ended yesterday

And all our tomorrow's

Were simply tossed away



Should I stay, should I go, I don't know



Could it be I've always

Known it all along

And didn't have the courage

To tell you what was wrong



What's the in cryin

Why should we be sad

Maybe in the long run

It really ain't so sad



Should I stay, should I go, I don't know



Whatever I tell myself

Whatever I do

I can't get a hold on nothing

And I can't break through

Whenever I feel myself

Slipping away

I'm gonna hold on



There's a time to walk away

And a time to learn

A time will come when Ill know

Just when and where to turn



Until we know the answer

Faith is all we have

Our trust is in the moment

Fear is in the past
