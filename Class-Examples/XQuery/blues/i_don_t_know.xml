<lyrics>


<l>You tell me that you love me

</l>
<l>That you really care

</l>
<l>We've talked it out

</l>
<l>We did our best

</l>
<l>And still it ain't going nowhere



</l>
<l>It feels like our forever

</l>
<l>just ended yesterday

</l>
<l>And all our tomorrow's

</l>
<l>Were simply tossed away



</l>
<l>Should I stay, should I go, I don't know



</l>
<l>Could it be I've always

</l>
<l>Known it all along

</l>
<l>And didn't have the courage

</l>
<l>To tell you what was wrong



</l>
<l>What's the in cryin

</l>
<l>Why should we be sad

</l>
<l>Maybe in the long run

</l>
<l>It really ain't so sad



</l>
<l>Should I stay, should I go, I don't know



</l>
<l>Whatever I tell myself

</l>
<l>Whatever I do

</l>
<l>I can't get a hold on nothing

</l>
<l>And I can't break through

</l>
<l>Whenever I feel myself

</l>
<l>Slipping away

</l>
<l>I'm gonna hold on



</l>
<l>There's a time to walk away

</l>
<l>And a time to learn

</l>
<l>A time will come when Ill know

</l>
<l>Just when and where to turn



</l>
<l>Until we know the answer

</l>
<l>Faith is all we have

</l>
<l>Our trust is in the moment

</l>
<l>Fear is in the past</l></lyrics></xml>
