<lyrics>



Well I'm as free as a bird now,

as flight-free as a bumble bee

I'm here and then gone tomorrow,

footloose child and fancy free

I'm absolutely independent,

and nothing at all is gonna worry me



Yeah, I've only got one cradle to rock now,

I'm gonna rock it everywhere I go

From St. Louie to San Francisco,

from Canada to Mexico

I'm gonna let my cradle rock now,

till it just won't rock no more



Well I believe I was born to rumble,

the open road is gonna bring me close

I've come to know some way out people,

to say the least they give the most

Who live and love across both borders,

trip east from west from coast to coast



Yeah I've only got one cradle to rock now,

I'm gonna rock it everywhere I go

From New York to California,

from Texas to Toronto

Yeah I'm gonna let my cradle rock now,

till it just won't rock no more



__________

Note: ok, ok, it's not really blues, no blues at all. But because
George has been stung by the Chuckberry-bee way back and since you're
in these here George Thorogood pages, I take it you won't give damn
and so I decided to post these here classic no-blues-at-all rock
lyrics anyway
