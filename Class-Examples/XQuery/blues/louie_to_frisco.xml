<lyrics>


<l>Well I'm as free as a bird now,

</l>
<l>as flight-free as a bumble bee

</l>
<l>I'm here and then gone tomorrow,

</l>
<l>footloose child and fancy free

</l>
<l>I'm absolutely independent,

</l>
<l>and nothing at all is gonna worry me



</l>
<l>Yeah, I've only got one cradle to rock now,

</l>
<l>I'm gonna rock it everywhere I go

</l>
<l>From St. Louie to San Francisco,

</l>
<l>from Canada to Mexico

</l>
<l>I'm gonna let my cradle rock now,

</l>
<l>till it just won't rock no more



</l>
<l>Well I believe I was born to rumble,

</l>
<l>the open road is gonna bring me close

</l>
<l>I've come to know some way out people,

</l>
<l>to say the least they give the most

</l>
<l>Who live and love across both borders,

</l>
<l>trip east from west from coast to coast



</l>
<l>Yeah I've only got one cradle to rock now,

</l>
<l>I'm gonna rock it everywhere I go

</l>
<l>From New York to California,

</l>
<l>from Texas to Toronto

</l>
<l>Yeah I'm gonna let my cradle rock now,

</l>
<l>till it just won't rock no more



</l>

<note>Note: ok, ok, it's not really blues, no blues at all. But because
George has been stung by the Chuckberry-bee way back and since you're
in these here George Thorogood pages, I take it you won't give damn
and so I decided to post these here classic no-blues-at-all rock
lyrics anyway</note></lyrics></xml>
