<lyrics>



Yeah, you get off of my back, baby

Can't you tell you're choking me

Oh I ain't no pony, baby

Can't you tell you're choking me

Yeah, you just get off of my back, baby

Can't you see you're hurting me



Well, I don't mind helping you, baby

Every now, now and then

Yes, you ain't helped yourself, baby

Since God knows when

So you just get off of my back now, baby

Can't you see you're hurting me



Yes, I'm standing here telling you, baby

This is the end of the line

Yes, I'm tired of you riding me, baby

I declare I ain't lying

So you just get off of my back, baby

Can't you see you're hurting me



Well, you get off, get off, get off, baby

'Cause you're a heavy, heavy load

Yes, you can catch yourself

Another ride, baby

Somewhere further down the road

You just get off, get off, baby

Can't you see you're hurting me
