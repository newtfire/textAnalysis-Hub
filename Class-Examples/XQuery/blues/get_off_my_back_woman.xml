<lyrics>


<l>Yeah, you get off of my back, baby

</l>
<l>Can't you tell you're choking me

</l>
<l>Oh I ain't no pony, baby

</l>
<l>Can't you tell you're choking me

</l>
<l>Yeah, you just get off of my back, baby

</l>
<l>Can't you see you're hurting me



</l>
<l>Well, I don't mind helping you, baby

</l>
<l>Every now, now and then

</l>
<l>Yes, you ain't helped yourself, baby

</l>
<l>Since God knows when

</l>
<l>So you just get off of my back now, baby

</l>
<l>Can't you see you're hurting me



</l>
<l>Yes, I'm standing here telling you, baby

</l>
<l>This is the end of the line

</l>
<l>Yes, I'm tired of you riding me, baby

</l>
<l>I declare I ain't lying

</l>
<l>So you just get off of my back, baby

</l>
<l>Can't you see you're hurting me



</l>
<l>Well, you get off, get off, get off, baby

</l>
<l>'Cause you're a heavy, heavy load

</l>
<l>Yes, you can catch yourself

</l>
<l>Another ride, baby

</l>
<l>Somewhere further down the road

</l>
<l>You just get off, get off, baby

</l>
<l>Can't you see you're hurting me</l></lyrics></xml>
