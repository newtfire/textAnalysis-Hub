<lyrics>


<l>Your gonna miss me little darlin', the day that I'm gone

</l>
<l>Your gonna miss me little baby, the day that I'm gone

</l>
<l>Cause I'm leavin' in the mornin', won't be back at all



</l>
<l>You have run me ragged baby, your own fault your on your own

</l>
<l>You have run me ragged baby, your own fault your on your own

</l>
<l>You didn't want me no way baby, 'till that other man was gone



</l>
<l>You can try to get me back baby, with all your tricks and charms

</l>
<l>You can try to get me back baby, with all your tricks and charms

</l>
<l>But when all your games are over, you'll be left with empty arms



</l>
<l>Low down and dead, and all alone</l></lyrics></xml>
