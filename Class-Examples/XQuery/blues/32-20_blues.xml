<lyrics>

I'm gonna get my 32-20, my baby she ridin' around in a V8    Ford
Lord, I'm gonna get my 32-20, my little girl ridin' around in a V8    Ford
Well, you know it musta been a while ago, man, somebody went out my backdoor

That's the reason I carry my 32-20, that the reason I carries it    ev'ryday
Lord, that's the reason I carry my 32-20, that's the reason I    carries it ev'ryday
Well now, you know how she been runnin' around here,    hmm,
I'd a-swear somebody gonna fade away

Lord, I got a lil' into trouble, down on Mr. Stovall's place
Lord,    I have got in a little trouble, way down on Mr. Stovall's place
Well now,    you know my baby she been runnin' around here ridin',
and I had to sit down    and change my ways

I got a pretty little thing, livin' down by
Frairs Point
I got a    pretty little thing, she's livin' down on Friars Fairs town
Now you know the    reason I carry that 32-20, man, I don't want my little baby ridin' around

Play that thing boy!

Well that's why I tote my 32-20, little gal, ev'rywhere I go
Yeah,    that's why I tote my 32-20, baby, most ev'rywhere I go
Well now, you know    I'm tired of my baby runnin' around here ridin', man, down in a V8 Ford
