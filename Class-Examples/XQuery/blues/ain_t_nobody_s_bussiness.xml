<lyrics>


<l>There is nothing I can do, nothing I can say

</l>
<l>That folks don't criticize me, but I'm gonna do

</l>
<l>Just what I want to do anyway, don't care if they all despise me



</l>
<l>One day we have ham and bacon

</l>
<l>And the next day ain't nothing shaking

</l>
<l>But it ain't nobody's business if we do



</l>
<l>If me and my baby fuzz and fight

</l>
<l>Yes and the next minute let me tell you were alright

</l>
<l>Ain't nobody's business if we do



</l>
<l>I'm three three times seven

</l>
<l>Lord, lord, lord let me tell you it makes twenty one

</l>
<l>And it ain't nobody's business what I'll do



</l>
<l>Lord, lord, lord,lord, lord, lord, lord,

</l>
<l>Lord, lord, lord,lord, lord, lord, lord,

</l>
<l>Ain't nobody's business what I'll do

</l>
<l>I said lord, lord, lord,lord, lord, lord, lord,

</l>
<l>Mmm, lord, lord

</l>
<l>And it ain't nobody's business what I'll do</l></lyrics></xml>
