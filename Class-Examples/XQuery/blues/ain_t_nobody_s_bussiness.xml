<lyrics>



There is nothing I can do, nothing I can say

That folks don't criticize me, but I'm gonna do

Just what I want to do anyway, don't care if they all despise me



One day we have ham and bacon

And the next day ain't nothing shaking

But it ain't nobody's business if we do



If me and my baby fuzz and fight

Yes and the next minute let me tell you were alright

Ain't nobody's business if we do



I'm three three times seven

Lord, lord, lord let me tell you it makes twenty one

And it ain't nobody's business what I'll do



Lord, lord, lord,lord, lord, lord, lord,

Lord, lord, lord,lord, lord, lord, lord,

Ain't nobody's business what I'll do

I said lord, lord, lord,lord, lord, lord, lord,

Mmm, lord, lord

And it ain't nobody's business what I'll do
