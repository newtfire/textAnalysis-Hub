<lyrics>



We're gonna take ya way back, ha ha

I said we're gonna take ya way back #91;Yeah!#93;

Ha, ha

(Let's start!)



When the sunrise in the east, lover

It set deeply in the west



(Spoken:

Oh, turn my organ down a-lil' bit so I can croon a lil' bit on
ya)



Oh, the sunrise in the east

It set deeply in the west

I've been lookin' for my lover

An' I haven't found her yet



I'm gonna call up China

An' see if my woman's over there

Well, I'm gonna call up China

An' see if my woman's over there

You know, I've searched the whole world over, Lord

I can't find my lover, nowhere (hey-ya)



She won't write me no letter

She won't even call me on the telephone

No, she won't write me no letter

She won't even call me on the telephone

You know I haven't had no real good lovin'

Since that gal-a mine been gone



(Spoken:

I can't see my, engineer

Hey, somebody! (hey, hey)

Where's Mister ... lt;name of engineer, inaudiblegt;

Well, Ooh!)



Someday baby, hahahaha

You're gonna want me, like I want you

Oh, someday baby, you're gonna want me, like I want you

But when you call me long distance, darlin'

I'll say I have nothing for you to do



Someday baby, you're gonna want me, like I want you

Hey, someday baby, you're gonna want me, like I want you

Oh, but when ya call me on the phone, angel

I'll say I have nothin' for you to do



Woo, thank you!
