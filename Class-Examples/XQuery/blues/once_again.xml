<lyrics>



Once again my brother wants his solitude

And once again my neighbor's got an attitude

And once again baby, I'm in the mood

For love, yeah for love



Once again my baby boy done skinned his knee

Once again somebody want a piece of me

And once again baby, I can't see

For love, yeah for love



Once again somebody went and gone too far

Once again a hand caught in the cookie jar

And once again, baby I'm wishin' on a star

For love, yeah for love
