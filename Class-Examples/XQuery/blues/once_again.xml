<lyrics>


<l>Once again my brother wants his solitude

</l>
<l>And once again my neighbor's got an attitude

</l>
<l>And once again baby, I'm in the mood

</l>
<l>For love, yeah for love



</l>
<l>Once again my baby boy done skinned his knee

</l>
<l>Once again somebody want a piece of me

</l>
<l>And once again baby, I can't see

</l>
<l>For love, yeah for love



</l>
<l>Once again somebody went and gone too far

</l>
<l>Once again a hand caught in the cookie jar

</l>
<l>And once again, baby I'm wishin' on a star

</l>
<l>For love, yeah for love</l></lyrics></xml>
