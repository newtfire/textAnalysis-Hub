<lyrics>



What did I hear goin' on 'round town

You tell everybody you're gonna put the kid down

Whoa loard baby you drivin' me insane

You been messin' with the kid, you better not be messin' with the
man



You know the kid didn't jive, you know the kid didn't play

He said what he mean and he meant what he said

Whoa Lord now baby you drivin' me insane

You been messin' with the kid, you better not be messin' with the
man



You spendin' my money as it come as a gift

I work for my money upon a eight-hour shift

Whoa, Lord now, baby you drivin' me insane

You been messin' with the kid, you better not be messin' with the
man



Now anything you want it, when you just say it

Didn't the kid buy, the time he got paid

Whoa, Lord, baby you drivin' me insane

You been messin' with the kid, you better not be messin' with the
man



You taken the kid's car and you drove it all 'round town

You told everybody you're gonna put him down

Whoa, Lord, baby you drivin' me insane

You been messin' with my kid, you better not be messin' with the
man
