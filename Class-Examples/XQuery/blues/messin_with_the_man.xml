<l>What did I hear goin' on 'round town

</l>
<l>You tell everybody you're gonna put the kid down

</l>
<l>Whoa loard baby you drivin' me insane

</l>
<l>You been messin' with the kid, you better not be messin' with the

man




</l>
<l>You know the kid didn't jive, you know the kid didn't play

</l>
<l>He said what he mean and he meant what he said

</l>
<l>Whoa Lord now baby you drivin' me insane

</l>
<l>You been messin' with the kid, you better not be messin' with the

man




</l>
<l>You spendin' my money as it come as a gift

</l>
<l>I work for my money upon a eight-hour shift

</l>
<l>Whoa, Lord now, baby you drivin' me insane

</l>
<l>You been messin' with the kid, you better not be messin' with the

man




</l>
<l>Now anything you want it, when you just say it

</l>
<l>Didn't the kid buy, the time he got paid

</l>
<l>Whoa, Lord, baby you drivin' me insane

</l>
<l>You been messin' with the kid, you better not be messin' with the

man




</l>
<l>You taken the kid's car and you drove it all 'round town

</l>
<l>You told everybody you're gonna put him down

</l>
<l>Whoa, Lord, baby you drivin' me insane

</l><l>You been messin' with my kid, you better not be messin' with the</l>
<l>man</l></lyrics></xml>
