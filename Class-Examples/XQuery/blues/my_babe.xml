<lyrics>



My baby don't stand no cheating, my babe

No, my baby don't stand no cheating, my baby

My baby don't stand no cheatin'

She don't stand none a-that midnight creepin'

My babe, is a true little baby, my baby



My baby, I know she loves me, my baby

My baby, I know she loves me, my baby

My baby, I know she loves me,

All she wanna do is kiss an' hug me

My baby, a true little baby, my baby



(My babe, my baby)

(My babe, my baby)

(My babe, my baby)

(My babe, my baby)



My baby don't stand no foolin', my baby

(My babe)

No, my baby don't stand no foolin', my baby

(My babe)

My baby don't stand no foolin'

Once she get mad, there ain't no coolin'

My babe is a true little baby, my babe



(My babe, my baby)

(My babe, my baby)

(My babe, my baby)

(My babe, my baby)



(My babe, my baby)

(My babe, my baby)

(My babe, my baby)

(My babe, my baby)



(My babe, my baby)

(My babe, my baby)

Fading:

(My babe, my baby)

(My babe, my baby)

(My babe, my baby)
