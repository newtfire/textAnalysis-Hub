<lyrics>


<l>The late show is over

</l>
<l>And the city is fast asleep

</l>
<l>And I'm lost in a world

</l>
<l>That's just too cold and deep

</l>
<l>I've turned so many ways

</l>
<l>I'm spinning like a top

</l>
<l>I wish that I could get off

</l>
<l>Or get this world to stop



</l>
<l>I'm a stranger and afraid

</l>
<l>I'm a stranger and afraid

</l>
<l>I'm a stranger and afraid

</l>
<l>In a world I never made



</l>
<l>I'm always chasing dragons

</l>
<l>With a sword that's made of tin

</l>
<l>So I know in my soul

</l>
<l>There's no way I can win

</l>
<l>I tried, oh I tried

</l>
<l>But there's no place, no place to go

</l>
<l>There's no one here who knows me

</l>
<l>And no one here I know



</l>
<l>I'm a stranger and afraid

</l>
<l>I'm a stranger and afraid

</l>
<l>I'm a stranger and afraid

</l>
<l>In a world I never made</l></lyrics></xml>
