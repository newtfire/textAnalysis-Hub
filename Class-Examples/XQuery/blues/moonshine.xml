<lyrics>



Now any this 
moonshine
,
moonshine do harm to many men

Now any this moonshine, moonshine do harm to many men

Now that is the reason why, yeah I'll believe, I'll make a change



Now, moonshine will make you shoot guns, make you wanna fight

At night when you go home, an you can't treat your wife right



You been drinkin' moonshine

Moonshine do harm to many men

Now that is the reason why

I believe I'll make a change



Now, moonshine will make you think that the policeman, is little
deliver boy

Moonshine will make you think that street cars, is little children
play toys



Then you been drinkin' moonshine

Moonshine does harm to many men

Now that is the reason why

I believe I'll make a change



Now, moonshine will make you go home, lay down 'cross your bed

An your wife try to talk wit' you, you say you didn't hear a word she
said



You been drinkin' moonshine

Moonshine do harm to many men

Now that is the reason why

I believe I'll make a change



Now, moonshine will make you just drunk, n' walk out in the
street

Moonshine will make you cuss out most, anybody you meet



You been drinkin' moonshine

Moonshine do harm to many men

Now that is the reason why

I believe I'll make a change
