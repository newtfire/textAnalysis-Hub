<lyrics>


<l>You got me walkin' across the floor

</l>
<l>My friends tell me, you don't want me no more

</l>
<l>Baby, don't you hear me cryin' for you?

</l>
<l>I wish you'd come home to me baby

</l>
<l>You know I can't live my life without you



</l>
<l>Don't you hear my cryin',

</l>
<l>Wahoo, wahoo, wahoo, wahoo, wahoo, wahoo, wahoo, wahoo



</l>
<l>My shoes, makin' holes in my tracks

</l>
<l>My clothes, are fallin' offa my back

</l>
<l>Baby, don't you hear my cryin' for you?

</l>
<l>I wish you'd come home to me baby

</l>
<l>I can't live my life without you



</l>
<l>Don't ya hear my cryin'

</l>
<l>Wahoo, wahoo, wahoo, wahoo, wahoo, wahoo, wahoo, wahoo



</l>
<l>My shoes, makin' holes in my tracks

</l>
<l>My clothes, fallin' off a my back

</l>
<l>Baby, don't you hear me cryin' for you?

</l>
<l>I wish you'd come home to me baby

</l>
<l>I can't live my life without you



</l>
<l>Don't you hear me cryin'

</l>
<l>Wahoo, wahoo, wahoo, wahoo, wahoo, wahoo, wahoo, wahoo</l></lyrics></xml>
