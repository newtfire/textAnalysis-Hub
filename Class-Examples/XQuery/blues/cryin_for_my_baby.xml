<lyrics>



You got me walkin' across the floor

My friends tell me, you don't want me no more

Baby, don't you hear me cryin' for you?

I wish you'd come home to me baby

You know I can't live my life without you



Don't you hear my cryin',

Wahoo, wahoo, wahoo, wahoo, wahoo, wahoo, wahoo, wahoo



My shoes, makin' holes in my tracks

My clothes, are fallin' offa my back

Baby, don't you hear my cryin' for you?

I wish you'd come home to me baby

I can't live my life without you



Don't ya hear my cryin'

Wahoo, wahoo, wahoo, wahoo, wahoo, wahoo, wahoo, wahoo



My shoes, makin' holes in my tracks

My clothes, fallin' off a my back

Baby, don't you hear me cryin' for you?

I wish you'd come home to me baby

I can't live my life without you



Don't you hear me cryin'

Wahoo, wahoo, wahoo, wahoo, wahoo, wahoo, wahoo, wahoo
