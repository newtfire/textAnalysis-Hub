<lyrics>


<l>Walking with my baby, she got great big feet

</l>
<l>Long, lean and cranky and ain't had nothing to eat

</l>
<l>But she's my baby, I love her just the same

</l>
<l>I'm crazy about my baby 'cause Caldonia is her name



</l>
<l>Caldonia, Caldonia

</l>
<l>What makes your big head so hard?

</l>
<l>I love you, I love you just the same

</l>
<l>I'm crazy about you, baby, 'cause Caldonia is your name



</l>
<l>You know my mother told me to leave Caldonia alone

</l>
<l>No kidding, that what she said

</l>
<l>She said, "Son, the woman ain't no good, leave her alone"

</l>
<l>But mama didn't know what Caldonia had been putting down

</l>
<l>So I'm going down to Caldonia's house and ask her just one more

time




</l>
<l>Caldonia, Caldonia

</l>
<l>What makes your big head so hard?

</l>
<l>I love you, love you just the same

</l>
<l>I'm crazy about you, baby, 'cause Caldonia is your name</l></lyrics></xml>
