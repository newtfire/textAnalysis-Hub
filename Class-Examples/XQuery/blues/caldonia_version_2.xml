<lyrics>



Walking with my baby, she got great big feet

Long, lean and cranky and ain't had nothing to eat

But she's my baby, I love her just the same

I'm crazy about my baby 'cause Caldonia is her name



Caldonia, Caldonia

What makes your big head so hard?

I love you, I love you just the same

I'm crazy about you, baby, 'cause Caldonia is your name



You know my mother told me to leave Caldonia alone

No kidding, that what she said

She said, "Son, the woman ain't no good, leave her alone"

But mama didn't know what Caldonia had been putting down

So I'm going down to Caldonia's house and ask her just one more
time



Caldonia, Caldonia

What makes your big head so hard?

I love you, love you just the same

I'm crazy about you, baby, 'cause Caldonia is your name
