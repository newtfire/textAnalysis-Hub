<lyrics>


<l>Come home this mornin' my woman she treated me like dirt

</l>
<l>Just because I had lipstick on my shirt

</l>
<l>She looked at me she made a nasty crack

</l>
<l>I said, "Please, please woman get off-a my back"



</l>
<l>I got mad (got mad baby)

</l>
<l>Got so mad (I got a bad little baby)

</l>
<l>I got mad you can see

</l>
<l>That woman tryin' to beat the hell out-a me



</l>
<l>I got the meanest woman that you ever seen

</l>
<l>That woman tried to beat the hell out of me

</l>
<l>She said, "I'm tired of you foolin' around"

</l>
<l>Then she picked up a brick an' damn near knocked me down



</l>
<l>I got mad (got made baby)

</l>
<l>Got so mad (I got a bad little baby)

</l>
<l>I got mad you can see that woman tryin' to beat the hell out of

me




</l>
<l>Now I thought of ev'ry night and day

</l>
<l>That kinda love can't go on that way

</l>
<l>That woman she said, "You tryin' to be slick"

</l>
<l>She said, "I will take this knife and I will cut off your prick!"

</l>
<l>I got mad (I got mad baby)

</l>
<l>Got so mad (I got a bad little baby)

</l>
<l>I got mad you can see that woman tryin' to beat the hell out of
me

</l>
<l>Whoa yeah



</l>
<l>I got mad (I got a bad little baby)

</l>
<l>Got so mad (I got a bad little baby)

</l>
<l>I got mad (I got a bad little baby)

</l>
<l>I stay so mad (I got a bad little baby)

</l>
<l>I got mad you can see that woman tried to beat the hell out of me
