<lyrics>



Come home this mornin' my woman she treated me like dirt

Just because I had lipstick on my shirt

She looked at me she made a nasty crack

I said, "Please, please woman get off-a my back"



I got mad (got mad baby)

Got so mad (I got a bad little baby)

I got mad you can see

That woman tryin' to beat the hell out-a me



I got the meanest woman that you ever seen

That woman tried to beat the hell out of me

She said, "I'm tired of you foolin' around"

Then she picked up a brick an' damn near knocked me down



I got mad (got made baby)

Got so mad (I got a bad little baby)

I got mad you can see that woman tryin' to beat the hell out of
me



Now I thought of ev'ry night and day

That kinda love can't go on that way

That woman she said, "You tryin' to be slick"

She said, "I will take this knife and I will cut off your prick!"

I got mad (I got mad baby)

Got so mad (I got a bad little baby)

I got mad you can see that woman tryin' to beat the hell out of
me

Whoa yeah



I got mad (I got a bad little baby)

Got so mad (I got a bad little baby)

I got mad (I got a bad little baby)

I stay so mad (I got a bad little baby)

I got mad you can see that woman tried to beat the hell out of me
