<lyrics>


<l>They were two lonely folks doin' the do's and don'ts,

</l>
<l>and got the notion together they'd be happy

</l>
<l>Thought they'd lose the crowd 'n' do the mess around,

</l>
<l>decided to make it snappy

</l>
<l>Just a twist of fate they didn't hesitate,

</l>
<l>now they had another party to lean on

</l>
<l>She made him jump and sang he made her share that thing,

</l>
<l>looks like they gonna have a ball ain't nothin' wrong at all

</l>
<l>Wo they gonna have a ball



</l>
<l>They got to askin' what if they had to scratch-n-sniff,

</l>
<l>to find out what it is they are after

</l>
<l>Got the ants out their pants 'n' took the chance on romance.

</l>
<l>made some plans to make it forever

</l>
<l>Now several years have gone they still gettin' along,

</l>
<l>they know what true love is made of

</l>
<l>Now they know that life's a trip with all it's bumps and dips,

</l>
<l>they gonna help one another along

</l><l>No</l></lyrics></xml>
