<lyrics>



They were two lonely folks doin' the do's and don'ts,

and got the notion together they'd be happy

Thought they'd lose the crowd 'n' do the mess around,

decided to make it snappy

Just a twist of fate they didn't hesitate,

now they had another party to lean on

She made him jump and sang he made her share that thing,

looks like they gonna have a ball ain't nothin' wrong at all

Wo they gonna have a ball



They got to askin' what if they had to scratch-n-sniff,

to find out what it is they are after

Got the ants out their pants 'n' took the chance on romance.

made some plans to make it forever

Now several years have gone they still gettin' along,

they know what true love is made of

Now they know that life's a trip with all it's bumps and dips,

they gonna help one another along

No
