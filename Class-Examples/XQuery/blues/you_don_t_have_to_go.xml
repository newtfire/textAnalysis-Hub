<l>Oh baby, you don't have to go

</l>
<l>Oh baby, you don't have to go

</l>
<l>You know I'm gonna pack up baby, down the road I go



</l>
<l>Whoa baby, what's gettin' wrong with you

</l>
<l>Whoa baby, what's gettin' wrong with you

</l>
<l>You don't treat me nothin' girl, like you used to do



</l>
<l>Well I gave you all of my money and let you go downtown

</l>
<l>You come back in the evenin' you call me all kind of clown

</l>
<l>Oh baby, you don't have to go

</l>
<l>You know I'm gonna pack up baby, down the road I go



</l>
<l>Whoa baby, turn your lamp down low

</l>
<l>Whoa baby, turn your lamp down low

</l>
<l>I beg you all night baby, you don't have to go</l></lyrics></xml>
