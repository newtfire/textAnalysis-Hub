<lyrics>



Oh baby, you don't have to go

Oh baby, you don't have to go

You know I'm gonna pack up baby, down the road I go



Whoa baby, what's gettin' wrong with you

Whoa baby, what's gettin' wrong with you

You don't treat me nothin' girl, like you used to do



Well I gave you all of my money and let you go downtown

You come back in the evenin' you call me all kind of clown

Oh baby, you don't have to go

You know I'm gonna pack up baby, down the road I go



Whoa baby, turn your lamp down low

Whoa baby, turn your lamp down low

I beg you all night baby, you don't have to go
