<lyrics>


<l>I've got a good mind to give up living, and go shopping instead

</l>
<l>I say, I've got a good mind to give up living, and go shopping
instead

</l>
<l>To pick up me a tombstone, and be pronounced dead



</l>
<l>When I read your letter this morning, that was in your place in
bed

</l>
<l>I read your letter this morning, that was in your place in bed

</l>
<l>And that's when I decided, that I would be better off dead



</l>
<l>It read, there is no use you looking, or ever hoping to get me
back

</l>
<l>Oh, there's no use you looking, or ever hoping to get me back

</l>
<l>Yes, because it's all over now, and baby you can bet on that</l></lyrics></xml>
