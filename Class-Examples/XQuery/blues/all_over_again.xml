<lyrics>



I've got a good mind to give up living, and go shopping instead

I say, I've got a good mind to give up living, and go shopping
instead

To pick up me a tombstone, and be pronounced dead



When I read your letter this morning, that was in your place in
bed

I read your letter this morning, that was in your place in bed

And that's when I decided, that I would be better off dead



It read, there is no use you looking, or ever hoping to get me
back

Oh, there's no use you looking, or ever hoping to get me back

Yes, because it's all over now, and baby you can bet on that
