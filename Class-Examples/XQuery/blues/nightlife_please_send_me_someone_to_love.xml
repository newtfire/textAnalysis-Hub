<lyrics>



When the evening, the evening sun goes down

You gonna find me somewhere hanging around

The night life, people, it ain't no good life

But it's my life, yeah



All the people just like you and me

Everybody's dreaming

Dreaming about their old used to be

The night life, hey, it ain't no good life, people

Oh but it's my life



Yes listen to the blues, people

Listen to what they're saying

Yes listen to the blues, people

Listen to the way they're playing



Heaven please send to all mankind

Understanding and peace of mind

If it's not asking too much

Please send me someone to love, someone to love



Show the world, show them how to get along

Peace will enter when hate is gone

If it's not asking too much

Please send me someone to love

Please send me someone to love



Nights I lay awake and ponder world's troubles

And my answer is always the same

Unless man put an end to this damnable sin

Hate will put the world in a flame, what a shame



Just because I'm, because I'm in misery

Oh I don't beg, I don't beg for no sympathy

But if it's not asking too much

Please send me someone to love, yeah



Oh the night life, people it ain't no good life

But it's my life, yeah

So please, please, please, please, please, please

Please send me someone to love

Someone to love



(Yes! Well, excuse me)
