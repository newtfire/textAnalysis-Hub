<lyrics>


<l>When the evening, the evening sun goes down

</l>
<l>You gonna find me somewhere hanging around

</l>
<l>The night life, people, it ain't no good life

</l>
<l>But it's my life, yeah



</l>
<l>All the people just like you and me

</l>
<l>Everybody's dreaming

</l>
<l>Dreaming about their old used to be

</l>
<l>The night life, hey, it ain't no good life, people

</l>
<l>Oh but it's my life



</l>
<l>Yes listen to the blues, people

</l>
<l>Listen to what they're saying

</l>
<l>Yes listen to the blues, people

</l>
<l>Listen to the way they're playing



</l>
<l>Heaven please send to all mankind

</l>
<l>Understanding and peace of mind

</l>
<l>If it's not asking too much

</l>
<l>Please send me someone to love, someone to love



</l>
<l>Show the world, show them how to get along

</l>
<l>Peace will enter when hate is gone

</l>
<l>If it's not asking too much

</l>
<l>Please send me someone to love

</l>
<l>Please send me someone to love



</l>
<l>Nights I lay awake and ponder world's troubles

</l>
<l>And my answer is always the same

</l>
<l>Unless man put an end to this damnable sin

</l>
<l>Hate will put the world in a flame, what a shame



</l>
<l>Just because I'm, because I'm in misery

</l>
<l>Oh I don't beg, I don't beg for no sympathy

</l>
<l>But if it's not asking too much

</l>
<l>Please send me someone to love, yeah



</l>
<l>Oh the night life, people it ain't no good life

</l>
<l>But it's my life, yeah

</l>
<l>So please, please, please, please, please, please

</l>
<l>Please send me someone to love

</l>
<l>Someone to love



</l>
<l>(Yes! Well, excuse me)</l></lyrics></xml>
