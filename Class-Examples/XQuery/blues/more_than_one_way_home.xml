<lyrics>


<l>Daddy came around every once in awhile

</l>
<l>But momma, she was there all the time

</l>
<l>And summertime in Compton

</l>
<l>Was not like TV

</l>
<l>But we were right there

</l>
<l>Where we needed to be

</l>
<l>And the Thurmond boys

</l>
<l>On peach street

</l>
<l>With only their dad

</l>
<l>So proud of themselves

</l>
<l>And that old Pontiac they had

</l>
<l>And miss brooks her bible

</l>
<l>And her three little boys

</l>
<l>At the double rock

</l>
<l>Baptist church

</l>
<l>Makin' a joyful noise



</l>
<l>(Chorus:)

</l>
<l>Well there's more than

</l>
<l>One way home

</l>
<l>Ain't no right way

</l>
<l>Ain't no wrong

</l>
<l>And whatever road you

</l>
<l>Might be on

</l>
<l>You find your own way

</l>
<l>'Cause there's more than

</l>
<l>One way home



</l>
<l>Got me a job at the grocery store

</l>
<l>Workin' weekdays after

</l>
<l>School from 5 to 9

</l>
<l>Tommy, John and Charlie were

</l>
<l>The neighborhood stars



</l>
<l>With their midsize homes,

</l>
<l>And their big fancy cars

</l>
<l>And when the eagle flied on Friday

</l>
<l>I'd go out and play

</l>
<l>Wastin' time with Otis

</l>
<l>Out on the dock of the bay

</l>
<l>And my ticket to adventure

</l>
<l>Was a ride on the bus

</l>
<l>Different places,

</l>
<l>Different faces

</l>
<l>But they were just like us



</l>
<l>(Chorus 2x)</l></lyrics></xml>
