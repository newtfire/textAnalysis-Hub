<lyrics>



Daddy came around every once in awhile

But momma, she was there all the time

And summertime in Compton

Was not like TV

But we were right there

Where we needed to be

And the Thurmond boys

On peach street

With only their dad

So proud of themselves

And that old Pontiac they had

And miss brooks her bible

And her three little boys

At the double rock

Baptist church

Makin' a joyful noise



(Chorus:)

Well there's more than

One way home

Ain't no right way

Ain't no wrong

And whatever road you

Might be on

You find your own way

'Cause there's more than

One way home



Got me a job at the grocery store

Workin' weekdays after

School from 5 to 9

Tommy, John and Charlie were

The neighborhood stars



With their midsize homes,

And their big fancy cars

And when the eagle flied on Friday

I'd go out and play

Wastin' time with Otis

Out on the dock of the bay

And my ticket to adventure

Was a ride on the bus

Different places,

Different faces

But they were just like us



(Chorus 2x)
