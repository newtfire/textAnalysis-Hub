<lyrics>



All day long

I've been thinking about you, baby

With loving you on my mind

I couldn't hardly wait

To get home to you, baby

So I could do a little overtime

Baby, baby, you've been so good to me

I want to understand

If I want a do right woman

Then I've got to be a do right man



So I'm gonna lay another log

On the fire, baby

Before my flame gets too low

Yes, I'm gonna lay another log

On the fire, baby

Trying to keep Jody from my door



Oh I know I've been neglecting you

Lately, baby

Just trying to make ends meet

But tonight I'm gonna be

On my love job, baby

Me working on you, you working on me



Wine, music, and a little candlelight

Just to help me unwind

'Cause I know

I got so much love to give, baby

And tonight I'm gonna take my time



I'm gonna lay another log

On the fire, baby

Before my flame gets too low

Said I'm gonna lay another log

On the fire, baby

Just trying to keep Jody from my door



I'm gonna lay another log

On the fire, baby

Before my flame gets too low

Yes, I'm gonna lay another log

On the fire, baby

Just gotta keep Jody from my door



I'm gonna lay another log

On the fire, baby

Before my flame gets too low

Think I'm gonna lay another log

On the fire, baby

Just trying to keep Jody from my door...
