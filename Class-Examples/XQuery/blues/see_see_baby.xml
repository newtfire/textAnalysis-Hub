<lyrics>



See-see baby

See what you have done, Lordy mama

No need to worry

See-see baby

See what you have done



Yes, you've told me a lie

Now you man has come



That man you got don't love you

Yes, he told me so, Lordy mama, no need to worry

The man don't love you, yes he told me so

He's just only jivin' you baby

He in love with the girl next door



Oh an' I love your teasin', an' the way you carries on, oh Lordy
mama

No need to worry, I love your teasin' an' the way you carries on

Yes, you told me a lie, little girl you know that's wrong



__________

Note: Federal Single #12428, July 1961.
