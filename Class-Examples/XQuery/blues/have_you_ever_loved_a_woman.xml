<lyrics>


<l>Have you ever loved a woman, so much you tremble in pain?

</l>
<l>Yes, have you ever loved a woman, so much you tremble in pain?

</l>
<l>Yes, all the time you know, she bears another man's name



</l>
<l>You just love that woman, so much it's a shame an' a sin

</l>
<l>Yes, you just love that woman, so much it's a shame an' a sin

</l>
<l>Yes, you know, yes you know, she's in love to your very best

friend




</l>
<l>Yes, have you ever loved a woman, one that you know you can't leave
her alone?

</l>
<l>Yes, have you ever loved a woman, one you know you can't leave her
alone?

</l>
<l>Yes, 'cause there's somethin' deep inside a you, won't let you wreck
your best friend's home

</l>
<l>Hey, hey, hey
