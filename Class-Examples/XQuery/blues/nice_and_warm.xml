<lyrics>


<l>Can't wait to get back home
where the sun is always
nice and warm

</l>
<l>Can't wait to get back home
where the sun is always
nice and warm

</l>
<l>You know it's freezin' out here
and that howlin' wind sends a nasty chill through my bones

</l>
<l>Oh you know I

shivered myself to sleep last night
the cold won't let me be
That's when I woke up and realized that
this ain't no place for me
and I can't
can't wait to get back home
where the sun is always nice and warm


</l>
<l>You know it's freezin' out here
and that howlin' wind sends a nasty chill through my bones

</l>
<l>Some good old friends got together

and they took me away
from this cold old alley babe
to a warm place I could stay
oh I can't
can't wait to get back home
where the sun is always nice and warm


</l><l>I'm so happy to see you all</l>
<l>and that old nasty chill is gone</l></lyrics></xml>
