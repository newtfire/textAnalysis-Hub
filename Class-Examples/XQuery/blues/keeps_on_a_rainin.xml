<lyrics>


<l>One dark and stormy night, Bill Jones was feeling blue

</l>
<l>Things didn't seem just right, so he didn't know just what to do

</l>
<l>I said: Bill, please tell me, ain't you satisfied?

</l>
<l>He looked around so pitiful, then to me he replied



</l>
<l>Keeps on a-rainin', look how it's rainin'

</l>
<l>Papa he can't make no time

</l>
<l>Wind keeps blowing, cold wind blowing

</l>
<l>Soon I'll find a southern clime
1

</l>
<l>In the wintertime when it starts to snow

</l>
<l>You know you pretty mama's got to have some dough

</l>
<l>Keeps on rainin', look how it's rainin'

</l>
<l>Papa he can't make no time



</l>
<l>Ain't the snow just beautiful, some people say

</l>
<l>But I'd rather see it in a moving picture play

</l>
<l>Keeps on snowin', look how it's snowin'

</l>
<l>Papa he can't make no time



</l>
