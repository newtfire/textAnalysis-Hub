<lyrics>



One dark and stormy night, Bill Jones was feeling blue

Things didn't seem just right, so he didn't know just what to do

I said: Bill, please tell me, ain't you satisfied?

He looked around so pitiful, then to me he replied



Keeps on a-rainin', look how it's rainin'

Papa he can't make no time

Wind keeps blowing, cold wind blowing

Soon I'll find a southern clime
1

In the wintertime when it starts to snow

You know you pretty mama's got to have some dough

Keeps on rainin', look how it's rainin'

Papa he can't make no time



Ain't the snow just beautiful, some people say

But I'd rather see it in a moving picture play

Keeps on snowin', look how it's snowin'

Papa he can't make no time

Note 1: clime, climate.
