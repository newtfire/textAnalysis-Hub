<lyrics>



Tell me pretty daddy, what's the matter now

Tell me pretty daddy, what's the matter now

Aw, you're trying to quit me and you don't know how



I'd rather be dead, buried in the sea

I'd rather be dead, buried in the sea

Than have the man I love say he don't want me



Lawd, Lawd, Lawd, Lawd, Lawd, Lawd

Lawd, Lawd, Lawdy, Lawdy, Lawd

Oh, the man I love treats me like a dog



I'd rather see my coffin come rolling in my door

I'd rather see my coffin come rolling in my door

Than hear the man I love say. "I don't want you no more"
