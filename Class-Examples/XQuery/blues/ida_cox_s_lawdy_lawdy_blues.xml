<l>Tell me pretty daddy, what's the matter now

</l>
<l>Tell me pretty daddy, what's the matter now

</l>
<l>Aw, you're trying to quit me and you don't know how



</l>
<l>I'd rather be dead, buried in the sea

</l>
<l>I'd rather be dead, buried in the sea

</l>
<l>Than have the man I love say he don't want me



</l>
<l>Lawd, Lawd, Lawd, Lawd, Lawd, Lawd

</l>
<l>Lawd, Lawd, Lawdy, Lawdy, Lawd

</l>
<l>Oh, the man I love treats me like a dog



</l>
<l>I'd rather see my coffin come rolling in my door

</l>
<l>I'd rather see my coffin come rolling in my door

</l><l>Than hear the man I love say. "I don't want you no more"</l></lyrics></xml>
