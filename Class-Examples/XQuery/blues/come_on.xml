<lyrics>



People talkin' but they just don't know,

what's in my heart and why I love you so

I love you baby like a miner loves gold,

come on baby let the good times roll



Let the good times roll,

come on it soothes my soul

Oh let the good times roll,

come on, come on, come on



A lot of people live in make believe,

they keep a lot of dirt up their sleeve

My love baby ain't the kind to fold,

come on baby let the good times roll

Let the good times roll,

come on an' let it roll

Ah yeah, let it roll, come on, let it roll



Our lovin's nice if it's understood,

it's even nicer when you feel so good

You got me flippin' like a flag on a pole,

come on sugar let the good times roll



Oh let the good times roll,

come on let it roll, come on, come on

Come on, come on, come on and let it roll
