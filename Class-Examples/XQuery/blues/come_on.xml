<lyrics>


<l>People talkin' but they just don't know,

</l>
<l>what's in my heart and why I love you so

</l>
<l>I love you baby like a miner loves gold,

</l>
<l>come on baby let the good times roll



</l>
<l>Let the good times roll,

</l>
<l>come on it soothes my soul

</l>
<l>Oh let the good times roll,

</l>
<l>come on, come on, come on



</l>
<l>A lot of people live in make believe,

</l>
<l>they keep a lot of dirt up their sleeve

</l>
<l>My love baby ain't the kind to fold,

</l>
<l>come on baby let the good times roll

</l>
<l>Let the good times roll,

</l>
<l>come on an' let it roll

</l>
<l>Ah yeah, let it roll, come on, let it roll



</l>
<l>Our lovin's nice if it's understood,

</l>
<l>it's even nicer when you feel so good

</l>
<l>You got me flippin' like a flag on a pole,

</l>
<l>come on sugar let the good times roll



</l>
<l>Oh let the good times roll,

</l>
<l>come on let it roll, come on, come on

</l>
<l>Come on, come on, come on and let it roll</l></lyrics></xml>
