<lyrics>



I bought a spray last night 'n I sprayed all over my house

I bought a spray last night 'n I sprayed all over my house

Mosquitoes all around my door won't let nobody come out



Mosquitoes all around me, mosquitoes everywhere I go

Mosquitoes all around me, mosquitoes everywhere I go

No matter where I go, they sticks their bills in me



I would say gallinipper
1
, these gallinippers bites too
hard

I would say gallinipper, these gallinippers bites too hard

I stepped back in my kitchen and they springing up in my back
yard
