<lyrics>


<l>I bought a spray last night 'n I sprayed all over my house

</l>
<l>I bought a spray last night 'n I sprayed all over my house

</l>
<l>Mosquitoes all around my door won't let nobody come out



</l>
<l>Mosquitoes all around me, mosquitoes everywhere I go

</l>
<l>Mosquitoes all around me, mosquitoes everywhere I go

</l>
<l>No matter where I go, they sticks their bills in me



</l>
<l>I would say gallinipper

1
, these gallinippers bites too
hard


</l>
<l>I would say gallinipper, these gallinippers bites too hard

</l>
<l>I stepped back in my kitchen and they springing up in my back

yard




</l>
