<lyrics>



I've lost the right to say that I love you,

I've lost the right to say that you are fine

Yes, I've lost the right to say that I love you baby,

and I've lost the right to say that you are fine

I've lost the right to say that I need you like I do now baby

and I'm slowly losing my mind



Oh, you once told me how much you love me,

and I said God love us all

Oh, you told me once how much you love me baby

and I said God love us all

Yes, I was young and just a fool then baby,

and couldn't hear the lovers call



Oh, now I'm all alone and waiting here baby,

I have no one to call my own

Yes, I'm all alone and I'm waiting baby,

I have no one to call my own

Yes, you are just a fool each lonely heartbeat says,

now I wonder why was I born
