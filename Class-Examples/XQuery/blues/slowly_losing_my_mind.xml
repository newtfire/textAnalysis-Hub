<lyrics>


<l>I've lost the right to say that I love you,

</l>
<l>I've lost the right to say that you are fine

</l>
<l>Yes, I've lost the right to say that I love you baby,

</l>
<l>and I've lost the right to say that you are fine

</l>
<l>I've lost the right to say that I need you like I do now baby

</l>
<l>and I'm slowly losing my mind



</l>
<l>Oh, you once told me how much you love me,

</l>
<l>and I said God love us all

</l>
<l>Oh, you told me once how much you love me baby

</l>
<l>and I said God love us all

</l>
<l>Yes, I was young and just a fool then baby,

</l>
<l>and couldn't hear the lovers call



</l>
<l>Oh, now I'm all alone and waiting here baby,

</l>
<l>I have no one to call my own

</l>
<l>Yes, I'm all alone and I'm waiting baby,

</l>
<l>I have no one to call my own

</l>
<l>Yes, you are just a fool each lonely heartbeat says,

</l><l>now I wonder why was I born</l></lyrics></xml>
