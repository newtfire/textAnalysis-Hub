<lyrics>


<l>I can hear my name ringin', ringin' all up and down the
line

</l>
<l>Yes I can hear my name ringin', ringin' all up and down the line

</l>
<l>I don't believe my woman loves me, I believe I'm just messin' up my

time




</l>
<l>Yes, I have the blues before sunrise, with the tears gettin' to my
eyes

</l>
<l>I have the blues before sunrise and the tears gettin' to my eyes

</l>
<l>Yes, I get that funny feeling, it's the feeling I do despise



</l>
<l>Yes, last night as I laid there dreamin', I was layin' there by
myself

</l>
<l>Yes, last night as I laid dreamin', I was layin' there by myself

</l><l>I was just thinkin' if my woman don't love me, I hope she's not in</l>
<l>love with nobody else</l></lyrics></xml>
