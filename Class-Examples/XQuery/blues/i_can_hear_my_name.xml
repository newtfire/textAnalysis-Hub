<lyrics>



I can hear my name ringin', ringin' all up and down the
line

Yes I can hear my name ringin', ringin' all up and down the line

I don't believe my woman loves me, I believe I'm just messin' up my
time



Yes, I have the blues before sunrise, with the tears gettin' to my
eyes

I have the blues before sunrise and the tears gettin' to my eyes

Yes, I get that funny feeling, it's the feeling I do despise



Yes, last night as I laid there dreamin', I was layin' there by
myself

Yes, last night as I laid dreamin', I was layin' there by myself

I was just thinkin' if my woman don't love me, I hope she's not in
love with nobody else
