<lyrics>


<l>Will you love me tomorrow like you say you love me now?

</l>
<l>Will you love me tomorrow like you say you love me now?

</l>
<l>When the flames of our flesh have stopped burning, and the fire of

our love has gone out




</l>
<l>Too many times I've given too much, now give me your love in
return

</l>
<l>Too many times I've given too much, now give me your love in
return

</l>
<l>Give me your mind and your heart, but please don't leave me with a

love that burns




</l>
<l>Please don't use me as your fool, 'cause my heart can't stand another
lie

</l>
<l>Oh, don't use me as your fool, 'cause my heart just can't stand
another lie

</l><l>And if you can't love me tomorrow, please leave me alone in my room</l>
<l>to cry</l></lyrics></xml>
