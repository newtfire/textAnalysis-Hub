<lyrics>



Will you love me tomorrow like you say you love me now?

Will you love me tomorrow like you say you love me now?

When the flames of our flesh have stopped burning, and the fire of
our love has gone out



Too many times I've given too much, now give me your love in
return

Too many times I've given too much, now give me your love in
return

Give me your mind and your heart, but please don't leave me with a
love that burns



Please don't use me as your fool, 'cause my heart can't stand another
lie

Oh, don't use me as your fool, 'cause my heart just can't stand
another lie

And if you can't love me tomorrow, please leave me alone in my room
to cry
