<lyrics>


<l>C'mon children, we got soul food in the house

</l>
<l>We got cornbread, mash potato, a-candied yam an' turnip greens

</l>
<l>We got a little chitlin', it's soul food



</l>
<l>I see the preacher comin', we're fixin' a plate

</l>
<l>"Will ya pass the biscuit please?"

</l>
<l>Shut-up boy, an' eat them greens!



</l>
<l>It's soul food, ya get your stomach full

</l>
<l>Want ya to eat, ya'all

</l>
<l>I'm gonna play for ya



</l>
<l>Ow! Woo!



</l>
<l>I see a man headed 'cross the track

</l>
<l>Food was so good, I see he's comin' back



</l>
<l>It's soul food

</l>
<l>It's soul food

</l>
<l>It's soul food

</l>
<l>It's soul food

</l>
<l>It's soul food

</l>
<l>It's soul food

</l>
<l>It's soul food

</l>
<l>It's soul food</l></lyrics></xml>
