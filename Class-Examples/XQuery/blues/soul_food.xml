<lyrics>



C'mon children, we got soul food in the house

We got cornbread, mash potato, a-candied yam an' turnip greens

We got a little chitlin', it's soul food



I see the preacher comin', we're fixin' a plate

"Will ya pass the biscuit please?"

Shut-up boy, an' eat them greens!



It's soul food, ya get your stomach full

Want ya to eat, ya'all

I'm gonna play for ya



Ow! Woo!



I see a man headed 'cross the track

Food was so good, I see he's comin' back



It's soul food

It's soul food

It's soul food

It's soul food

It's soul food

It's soul food

It's soul food

It's soul food
