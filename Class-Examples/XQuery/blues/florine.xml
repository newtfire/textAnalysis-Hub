Florine, Lord you know I call her, Flo

Florine, you know I call her, Flo

She's my hip shakin' mama and she shake like jello



You know I met her, long time ago

You know I met her, long time ago

She's my hip shakin' mama and she shake like jello

Woo-hoo-hoo



Shake it, shake it baby

(Shake it, shake it baby)

An' shake it, shake it baby

(Shake it, shake it baby)

Shake it, shake it baby

(Shake it, shake it baby)

Now shake it, shake it baby

(Shake it, shake it baby)



She's my hip shakin' mama

And she shake like jello

Hoo-hoo-hoo



You know I met her, long time ago

You know I met her, long time ago

She's my hip shakin' mama and she shake like jello

Hee-hee



Shake it, shake it baby

(Shake it, shake it baby)

Shake it, shake it baby

(Shake it shake it baby)

Shake it, shake it baby

(Shake it, shake it baby)

An' shake it, shake it baby

(Shake it, shake it baby)



She's my hip shakin' mama

And she shake like jello

E-hee-ee



Woo-hoo-eee



Woo-hoo
