<lyrics>



When I wasn't nothin' but a child

When I wasn't nothin' but a child

All you men tried to drive me wild



Now I'm growin' old

Now I'm growin' old

and I've got what it takes to get all of you men told



My mama says I'm reckless, my daddy says I'm wild

My mama says I'm reckless, my daddy says I'm wild

I ain't good lookin' but I'm somebody's angel child



Daddy, mama wants some lovin'

Daddy, mama wants some huggin'

Darn it pretty papa, mama wants some lovin' I vow

Darn pretty papa, mama wants some lovin' right now
