<lyrics>



I got a wobblin' baby, wobble me all the time

I got a wobblin' baby, wobble me all the time

Wobble me in the mornin', wobble me all the time

Oh, wobble me baby



Nobody treat me baby, treat me the way you do

Nobody treat me baby, treat me the way you do

I love you baby, love you all the time

Oh, wobble me baby, wobble me



If you ever leave me baby, I believe I would die

If you ever leave me baby, I believe I would die

Ah, without your love, baby, you know tour daddy's through



I said, "Wobble me baby", I got a wobblin' baby

Way she wobbles all right

Wobble me in the mornin', wobble me late at night

Wobble me baby, wobble me baby, wobble me all the time

Oh, nobody please me, please like you do
