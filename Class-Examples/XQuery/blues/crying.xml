<lyrics>


<l>I#146;m crying

</l>
<l>Yes, I#146;m crying

</l>
<l>And I just don#146;t know

</l>
<l>How it#146;s all going to end

</l>
<l>I#146;m thinking back a long time

</l>
<l>When I hit my woman down

</l>
<l>It was a bad bad evil night

</l>
<l>When I realized what I#146;d done

</l>
<l>It was way too late, too late

</l>
<l>Too late for words and I#146;m crying



</l>
<l>In torment sometimes

</l>
<l>We hurt each other so bad

</l>
<l>Nobody to turn to, no going back

</l>
<l>No such thing as God for us

</l>
<l>No more to touch her body

</l>
<l>No more to stroke her hair

</l>
<l>All I can do is break down in tears

</l>
<l>I#146;m crying and wondering

</l>
<l>Where am I now because of what I did

</l>
<l>I just don#146;t know and I#146;m crying



</l>
<l>It was a long time ago

</l>
<l>The pain is over now

</l>
<l>But I still think back sometimes

</l>
<l>And remember how I cried

</l>
<l>I was crying</l></lyrics></xml>
