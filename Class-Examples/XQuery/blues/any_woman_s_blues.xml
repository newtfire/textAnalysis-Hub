<lyrics>


<l>My man ain't acting right

</l>
<l>He stays out late at night

</l>
<l>But still he says he loves no one but me

</l>
<l>But if I find the gal

</l>
<l>That's trying to steal my pal

</l>
<l>I'll get her told, just you wait and see

</l>
<l>I feel so blue, don't know what to do

</l>
<l>Every woman in my place is bound to feel blue too



</l>
<l>Lord, I love my man better than I love myself

</l>
<l>I love my man better than I love myself

</l>
<l>And if he don't have me, he sure won't have nobody else



</l>
<l>My man's got teeth like a lighthouse in the sea

</l>
<l>My man's got teeth like a lighthouse in the sea

</l>
<l>And every time he smiles, he throws his light on me



</l>
<l>His voice sounds like chimes, I mean the organ kind

</l>
<l>His voice sounds like chimes, I mean the organ kind

</l>
<l>And every time he speaks, it's music to my troubled mind



</l>
<l>I'm gonna buy myself a graveyard of my own

</l>
<l>I'm gonna buy myself a graveyard of my own

</l>
<l>Gonna kill somebody if they don't let my man alone</l></lyrics></xml>
