<lyrics>



My man ain't acting right

He stays out late at night

But still he says he loves no one but me

But if I find the gal

That's trying to steal my pal

I'll get her told, just you wait and see

I feel so blue, don't know what to do

Every woman in my place is bound to feel blue too



Lord, I love my man better than I love myself

I love my man better than I love myself

And if he don't have me, he sure won't have nobody else



My man's got teeth like a lighthouse in the sea

My man's got teeth like a lighthouse in the sea

And every time he smiles, he throws his light on me



His voice sounds like chimes, I mean the organ kind

His voice sounds like chimes, I mean the organ kind

And every time he speaks, it's music to my troubled mind



I'm gonna buy myself a graveyard of my own

I'm gonna buy myself a graveyard of my own

Gonna kill somebody if they don't let my man alone
