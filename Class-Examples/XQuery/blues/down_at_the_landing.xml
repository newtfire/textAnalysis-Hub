<l>When I was down at the landing people, Lord, waiting with my
head hung down

</l>
<l>Lord, I was down at the landing, with my head hung down

</l>
<l>I could see everybody's baby gettin' on board, Lord, but I couldn't

see mine, Lord, I couldn't




</l>
<l>I said "Lord have mercy, where could my baby be"

</l>
<l>I said "Lord have mercy, people, where could my baby be"

</l>
<l>I could see everybody's ba, ba, ba, ba, baby, Lord, but I can't see

mine




</l>
<l>This big boat kept on rollin', big boat kept on rollin' along

</l>
<l>Lord, but it did, Lord, the big boat, the big boat people. big boat
kept on rollin' along

</l>
<l>I was standin' there wonderin', with my head hung down



</l>
<l>I believe I'll call to the cargo, yes, yes, yeah, I'm gonna see if my
baby's down

</l>
<l>Oh, call to the cargo, see if my baby's down

</l><l>My baby she might have got hung up people, Lord, if she could make it</l>
<l>down</l></lyrics></xml>
