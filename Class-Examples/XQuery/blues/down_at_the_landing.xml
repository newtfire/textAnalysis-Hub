<lyrics>



When I was down at the landing people, Lord, waiting with my
head hung down

Lord, I was down at the landing, with my head hung down

I could see everybody's baby gettin' on board, Lord, but I couldn't
see mine, Lord, I couldn't



I said "Lord have mercy, where could my baby be"

I said "Lord have mercy, people, where could my baby be"

I could see everybody's ba, ba, ba, ba, baby, Lord, but I can't see
mine



This big boat kept on rollin', big boat kept on rollin' along

Lord, but it did, Lord, the big boat, the big boat people. big boat
kept on rollin' along

I was standin' there wonderin', with my head hung down



I believe I'll call to the cargo, yes, yes, yeah, I'm gonna see if my
baby's down

Oh, call to the cargo, see if my baby's down

My baby she might have got hung up people, Lord, if she could make it
down
