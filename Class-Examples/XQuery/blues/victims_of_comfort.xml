<lyrics>



No rocket's gonna fly that high

There's no escaping the enemy he's you and I

We poison up our water, we're chokin' on the air

Last stop before it gets too late or is it already too late?

Is it already too late

For the victims of comfort?

Got no one else to blame

We're just the victims of comfort

We cannot soothe the pain



And it's a technological merry-go-round

Dangerous solutions buried under the ground

And everyone likes a party

But no-one wants to clean

Well I'd like to see a change somehow and I believe we're busy right
now

Just a little busy right now

I am just a victim of comfort

I got no one else to blame

I'm just a victim of comfort

Cryin' shame



Boy what have we got to lose? Everything

Yes and what do we stand to gain? Everything, so let's

Try together before we have to cry together

It's too soon to die together

I'm just a victim of comfort

Got no one else to blame

I'm just a victim of comfort

Got to soothe the pain

Be the victims of comfort

Got no one else to blame

I am just a victim of comfort

Cryin' shame
