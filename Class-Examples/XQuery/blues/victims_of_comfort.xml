<lyrics>


<l>No rocket's gonna fly that high

</l>
<l>There's no escaping the enemy he's you and I

</l>
<l>We poison up our water, we're chokin' on the air

</l>
<l>Last stop before it gets too late or is it already too late?

</l>
<l>Is it already too late

</l>
<l>For the victims of comfort?

</l>
<l>Got no one else to blame

</l>
<l>We're just the victims of comfort

</l>
<l>We cannot soothe the pain



</l>
<l>And it's a technological merry-go-round

</l>
<l>Dangerous solutions buried under the ground

</l>
<l>And everyone likes a party

</l>
<l>But no-one wants to clean

</l>
<l>Well I'd like to see a change somehow and I believe we're busy right
now

</l>
<l>Just a little busy right now

</l>
<l>I am just a victim of comfort

</l>
<l>I got no one else to blame

</l>
<l>I'm just a victim of comfort

</l>
<l>Cryin' shame



</l>
<l>Boy what have we got to lose? Everything

</l>
<l>Yes and what do we stand to gain? Everything, so let's

</l>
<l>Try together before we have to cry together

</l>
<l>It's too soon to die together

</l>
<l>I'm just a victim of comfort

</l>
<l>Got no one else to blame

</l>
<l>I'm just a victim of comfort

</l>
<l>Got to soothe the pain

</l>
<l>Be the victims of comfort

</l>
<l>Got no one else to blame

</l>
<l>I am just a victim of comfort

</l>
<l>Cryin' shame</l></lyrics></xml>
