<lyrics>



I got a whole lot of lovin'

Baby just waiting for you

I got a whole lot of lovin'

Baby just waiting for you

And the way I could love you woman

Honey I know you could love me too



Oh you're so good lookin' baby

And you build up from the ground

Well you're so good lookin' baby

And you build up from the ground

Every time I see you baby

My love starts tumbling down



Yeah, you're just my type baby

Just my height and size

Said you're just my type baby

You're just my height and size

And the reason I love you

Because you've got those little dreamy eyes
