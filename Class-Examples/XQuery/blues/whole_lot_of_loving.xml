<l>I got a whole lot of lovin'

</l>
<l>Baby just waiting for you

</l>
<l>I got a whole lot of lovin'

</l>
<l>Baby just waiting for you

</l>
<l>And the way I could love you woman

</l>
<l>Honey I know you could love me too



</l>
<l>Oh you're so good lookin' baby

</l>
<l>And you build up from the ground

</l>
<l>Well you're so good lookin' baby

</l>
<l>And you build up from the ground

</l>
<l>Every time I see you baby

</l>
<l>My love starts tumbling down



</l>
<l>Yeah, you're just my type baby

</l>
<l>Just my height and size

</l>
<l>Said you're just my type baby

</l>
<l>You're just my height and size

</l>
<l>And the reason I love you

</l>
<l>Because you've got those little dreamy eyes</l></lyrics></xml>
