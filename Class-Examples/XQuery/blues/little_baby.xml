<lyrics>



You'll go and I'll come with you little baby

You'll go and I'll come with you little baby

You'll go and I'll come with you

You'll bet your life that I won't quit you

You'll go and I'll come with you little baby



You'll go to court

And I'll come along

You'll go to jail

And I'll throw your bond

You got time

Tell you what I'll do

I'll stay outside and wait for you



You'll go and I'll come with you little baby

You'll go and I'll come with you little baby

You'll go and I'll come with you

You'll bet your life that I won't quit you

You'll go and I'll come with you little baby



You'll go to church

And I'll go there too

You'll go to work

I'll tell you what I do

You'll get paid

I'll hold the money

I'll be right there to protect you honey



You'll go and I'll come with you little baby

You'll go and I'll come with you little baby

You'll go and I'll come with you

You'll bet your life that I won't quit you

You'll go and I'll come with you little baby



You'll get the fair

And I'll go to show

You'll bet the horses

And I'll pick up the dough

You work hard

Hurt my pride

I'll be right there by your side



You'll go and I'll come with you little baby

You'll go and I'll come with you little baby

You'll go and I'll come with you

You'll bet your life that I won't quit you

You'll go and I'll come with you little baby



Ooh, little baby

Ooh, little baby

Ooh, little baby
