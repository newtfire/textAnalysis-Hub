<l>You'll bet your life that I won't quit you

</l>
<l>You'll go and I'll come with you little baby



</l>
<l>You'll go to court

</l>
<l>And I'll come along

</l>
<l>You'll go to jail

</l>
<l>And I'll throw your bond

</l>
<l>You got time

</l>
<l>Tell you what I'll do

</l>
<l>I'll stay outside and wait for you



</l>

</l>
<l>I'll tell you what I do

</l>
<l>You'll get paid

</l>
<l>I'll hold the money

</l>
<l>I'll be right there to protect you honey

</l>
<l>And I'll go to show

</l>
<l>You'll bet the horses

</l>
<l>And I'll pick up the dough

</l>
<l>You work hard

</l>
<l>Hurt my pride

</l>
<l>I'll be right there by your side
