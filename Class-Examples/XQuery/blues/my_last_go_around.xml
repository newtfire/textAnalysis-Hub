<lyrics>


<l>Babe, I'm on my last go 'round and I hate to say goodbye

</l>
<l>Babe, I'm on my last go 'round but it's time to say goodbye

</l>
<l>Since you did what you wanna do, babe, and I guess you satisfied



</l>
<l>Since you've got me grievin', babe, an' I'm scared to say,
goodbye

</l>
<l>You got me grievin', baby, an' I'm scared to say, goodbye

</l>
<l>Well I've got to leave you baby and it ain't no use to crying



</l>
<l>You started me to drinkin', baby, drinkin' both night and day

</l>
<l>An' you started me to drinkin', baby, an' runnin' from town to
town

</l>
<l>You know I had a good woman but you made her throw me down

</l>
<l>Yeah



</l>
<l>Yeah, you make me drunk on Sunday, just to play me for your clown

</l>
<l>Baby, you make me drunk on Sunday, just to play me for your clown

</l><l>Babe, you know I meant you all the good but you tried to tear me</l>
<l>down</l></lyrics></xml>
