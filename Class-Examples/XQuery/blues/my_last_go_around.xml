<lyrics>



Babe, I'm on my last go 'round and I hate to say goodbye

Babe, I'm on my last go 'round but it's time to say goodbye

Since you did what you wanna do, babe, and I guess you satisfied



Since you've got me grievin', babe, an' I'm scared to say,
goodbye

You got me grievin', baby, an' I'm scared to say, goodbye

Well I've got to leave you baby and it ain't no use to crying



You started me to drinkin', baby, drinkin' both night and day

An' you started me to drinkin', baby, an' runnin' from town to
town

You know I had a good woman but you made her throw me down

Yeah



Yeah, you make me drunk on Sunday, just to play me for your clown

Baby, you make me drunk on Sunday, just to play me for your clown

Babe, you know I meant you all the good but you tried to tear me
down
