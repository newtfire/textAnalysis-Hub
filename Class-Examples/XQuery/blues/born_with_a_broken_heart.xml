<lyrics>


<l>Up from the ashes, out of the flames

</l>
<l>Keeps gettin' stronger, like a slow rollin' train

</l>
<l>Watch it run

</l>
<l>Oh, why do the good die young

</l>
<l>Burnin' like a shootin' star

</l>
<l>Born with a broken heart



</l>
<l>Off in the distance, it was callin' my name

</l>
<l>So I took me a ride, on that slow rollin' train

</l>
<l>It still runs

</l>
<l>But it seems that the good die young

</l>
<l>Playin' on that sad guitar

</l>
<l>Born with a broken heart

</l>
<l>Burnin' like a shootin' star

</l>
<l>Born with a broken heart



</l>
<l>Seems it was over, before it begun

</l>
<l>Killed by a bullet, from a six-string gun

</l>
<l>Bang a drum

</l>
<l>Oh, why do the good die young

</l>
<l>Ridin' in a long black car

</l>
<l>Born with a broken heart

</l>
<l>Playin' on that sad guitar

</l>
<l>Born with a broken heart

</l>
<l>Burnin' like a shootin' star

</l>
<l>Born with a broken heart</l></lyrics></xml>
