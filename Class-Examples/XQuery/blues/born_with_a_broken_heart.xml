<lyrics>



Up from the ashes, out of the flames

Keeps gettin' stronger, like a slow rollin' train

Watch it run

Oh, why do the good die young

Burnin' like a shootin' star

Born with a broken heart



Off in the distance, it was callin' my name

So I took me a ride, on that slow rollin' train

It still runs

But it seems that the good die young

Playin' on that sad guitar

Born with a broken heart

Burnin' like a shootin' star

Born with a broken heart



Seems it was over, before it begun

Killed by a bullet, from a six-string gun

Bang a drum

Oh, why do the good die young

Ridin' in a long black car

Born with a broken heart

Playin' on that sad guitar

Born with a broken heart

Burnin' like a shootin' star

Born with a broken heart
