<lyrics>



I'm ready, ready as anybody can be

I'm ready, ready as anybody can be

Now I'm ready for you,

I hope you're ready for me



I got an axe-hounds face made on a graveyard frame,

shootin' tombstone bullets, wearin' ball and chain

I'm drinkin' TNT, smokin' dynamite,

I hope some screwball start a fight



I'm ready, ready as anybody can be

Now I'm ready for you,

I hope you're ready for me



All you pretty little chicks with your pretty little hair,

I know you think that I ain't nowhere

But stop what your doin' an' look over here,

I'll prove to ya, baby, that I ain't no square



I'm ready, ready as anybody can be

Now I'm ready for you,

I hope you're ready for me



I been drinkin' gin like never before,

I feel so good, babe, I want you to know

One more drink, and I wish you would,

I takes a whole lotta lovin' to make me feel good, cause



I'm ready, ready as anybody can be

Now I'm ready for you,

I hope you're ready for me
