<lyrics>


<l>I'm ready, ready as anybody can be

</l>
<l>I'm ready, ready as anybody can be

</l>
<l>Now I'm ready for you,

</l>
<l>I hope you're ready for me



</l>
<l>I got an axe-hounds face made on a graveyard frame,

</l>
<l>shootin' tombstone bullets, wearin' ball and chain

</l>
<l>I'm drinkin' TNT, smokin' dynamite,

</l>
<l>I hope some screwball start a fight



</l>
<l>I'm ready, ready as anybody can be

</l>
<l>Now I'm ready for you,

</l>
<l>I hope you're ready for me



</l>
<l>All you pretty little chicks with your pretty little hair,

</l>
<l>I know you think that I ain't nowhere

</l>
<l>But stop what your doin' an' look over here,

</l>
<l>I'll prove to ya, baby, that I ain't no square



</l>
<l>I'm ready, ready as anybody can be

</l>
<l>Now I'm ready for you,

</l>
<l>I hope you're ready for me



</l>
<l>I been drinkin' gin like never before,

</l>
<l>I feel so good, babe, I want you to know

</l>
<l>One more drink, and I wish you would,

</l>
<l>I takes a whole lotta lovin' to make me feel good, cause



</l>
<l>I'm ready, ready as anybody can be

</l>
<l>Now I'm ready for you,

</l>
<l>I hope you're ready for me</l></lyrics></xml>
