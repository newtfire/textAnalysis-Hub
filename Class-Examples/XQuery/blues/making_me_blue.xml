I had no worries

Till I met you

But ever since that day, baby

Lord, what I've been doing through

I found no rest

No happiness

You don't do nothing but making me blue



You said you loved me

And I believed in you

I sent you down baby

And been seein' you through

But for that mistake

You made my heart ache

You don't do nothing but making me blue



This life I'm living

Stayin' here with you

Been nothing but heartaches

Woman and you know it's true

You don't satisfy

Won't even try

You don't do nothing but making me blue



Now I'm sayin' it's over

Yes, and leavin' you

Just stay where you are, little girl

I say I'm leavin' you

You had your fun

What's done is done

You don't do nothing but making me blue
