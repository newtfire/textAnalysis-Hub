<lyrics>


<l>I had no worries

</l>
<l>Till I met you

</l>
<l>But ever since that day, baby

</l>
<l>Lord, what I've been doing through

</l>
<l>I found no rest

</l>
<l>No happiness

</l>
<l>You don't do nothing but making me blue



</l>
<l>You said you loved me

</l>
<l>And I believed in you

</l>
<l>I sent you down baby

</l>
<l>And been seein' you through

</l>
<l>But for that mistake

</l>
<l>You made my heart ache

</l>
<l>You don't do nothing but making me blue



</l>
<l>This life I'm living

</l>
<l>Stayin' here with you

</l>
<l>Been nothing but heartaches

</l>
<l>Woman and you know it's true

</l>
<l>You don't satisfy

</l>
<l>Won't even try

</l>
<l>You don't do nothing but making me blue



</l>
<l>Now I'm sayin' it's over

</l>
<l>Yes, and leavin' you

</l>
<l>Just stay where you are, little girl

</l>
<l>I say I'm leavin' you

</l>
<l>You had your fun

</l>
<l>What's done is done

</l>
<l>You don't do nothing but making me blue</l></lyrics></xml>
