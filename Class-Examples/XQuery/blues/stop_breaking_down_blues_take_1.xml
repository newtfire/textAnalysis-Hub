<lyrics>



Everytime I'm walkin', down the streets, some pretty mama
start breakin' down with me

Stop breakin' down, yes stop breakin' down

The stuff I got'll bust your brains out, baby, hoo hoo, it'll make
you lose your mind.



I can't walk the streets now con, consolate my mind,

some no-good woman she starts breakin' down

Stop breakin' down, please stop breakin' down

The stuff I got it gon' bust your brains out, baby, hoo hoo, it'll
make you lose your mind



Now, you Saturday night women's, you love to ape and clown,

you won't do nothin' but tear a good man reputation down

Stop breakin' down, please stop breakin' down

The stuff I got'll bust your brains out, baby, hoo hoo, it'll make
you lose your mind



Now, I give my baby, now, the ninety-nine degree,

she jumped up and throwed a pistol down on me

Stop breakin' down, please stop breakin' down

Stuff I got'll bust your brains out, baby, hoo hoo, it'll make you
lose your mind



I can't start walkin' down the streets, but some pretty mama don't
start breakin' down with me

Stop breakin' down, yeah stop breakin' down

The stuff I got'll bust your brains out, baby, hoo hoo, it'll make
you lose your mind
