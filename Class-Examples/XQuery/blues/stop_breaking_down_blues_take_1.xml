<lyrics>


<l>Everytime I'm walkin', down the streets, some pretty mama
start breakin' down with me

</l>
<l>Stop breakin' down, yes stop breakin' down

</l>
<l>The stuff I got'll bust your brains out, baby, hoo hoo, it'll make

you lose your mind.




</l>
<l>I can't walk the streets now con, consolate my mind,

</l>
<l>some no-good woman she starts breakin' down

</l>
<l>Stop breakin' down, please stop breakin' down

</l>
<l>The stuff I got it gon' bust your brains out, baby, hoo hoo, it'll

make you lose your mind




</l>
<l>Now, you Saturday night women's, you love to ape and clown,

</l>
<l>you won't do nothin' but tear a good man reputation down

</l>
<l>Stop breakin' down, please stop breakin' down

</l>
<l>The stuff I got'll bust your brains out, baby, hoo hoo, it'll make

you lose your mind




</l>
<l>Now, I give my baby, now, the ninety-nine degree,

</l>
<l>she jumped up and throwed a pistol down on me

</l>
<l>Stop breakin' down, please stop breakin' down

</l>
<l>Stuff I got'll bust your brains out, baby, hoo hoo, it'll make you

lose your mind




</l>
<l>I can't start walkin' down the streets, but some pretty mama don't
start breakin' down with me

</l>
<l>Stop breakin' down, yeah stop breakin' down

</l><l>The stuff I got'll bust your brains out, baby, hoo hoo, it'll make</l>
<l>you lose your mind</l></lyrics></xml>
