<lyrics>


<l>Well I had a woman, she was nice, kind and loving to me in every
way

</l>
<l>Oh I had a woman, she was nice, kind and loving to me in every
way

</l>
<l>Oh she used to love me and bring my breakfast to my bed every day



</l>
<l>For ten long years, she was my pride and joy

</l>
<l>Oh for ten long years, she was my pride and joy

</l>
<l>And I used to call her my little girl, oh she used to call me,

</l>
<l>she used to call me her little boy



</l>
<l>Oh it's all over baby, you know I'm all alone

</l>
<l>It's all over baby, damn you know I'm all alone

</l>
<l>Well the reason you hear me singing the blues baby,

</l>
<l>yeah you know my baby's gone, she's gone she's gone</l></lyrics></xml>
