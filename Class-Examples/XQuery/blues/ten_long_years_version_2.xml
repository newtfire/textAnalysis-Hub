<lyrics>



Well I had a woman, she was nice, kind and loving to me in every
way

Oh I had a woman, she was nice, kind and loving to me in every
way

Oh she used to love me and bring my breakfast to my bed every day



For ten long years, she was my pride and joy

Oh for ten long years, she was my pride and joy

And I used to call her my little girl, oh she used to call me,

she used to call me her little boy



Oh it's all over baby, you know I'm all alone

It's all over baby, damn you know I'm all alone

Well the reason you hear me singing the blues baby,

yeah you know my baby's gone, she's gone she's gone
