<lyrics>


<l>Blues stay away from me

</l>
<l>Oh blues, what don't you let me be

</l>
<l>Don't know why

</l>
<l>You keep on haunting me



</l>
<l>Love never meant for me

</l>
<l>Oh true love was never meant for me

</l>
<l>Seem somehow

</l>
<l>We never can agree



</l>
<l>Life is full of misery

</l>
<l>Oh dreams are like memories

</l>
<l>Bringing back

</l>
<l>The love that used to be



</l>
<l>Tears, so many I can't see

</l>
<l>Oh yes, don't mean a thing to me

</l>
<l>Oh, don't go by

</l>
<l>Still I can be free</l></lyrics></xml>
