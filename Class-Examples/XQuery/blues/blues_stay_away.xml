<lyrics>



Blues stay away from me

Oh blues, what don't you let me be

Don't know why

You keep on haunting me



Love never meant for me

Oh true love was never meant for me

Seem somehow

We never can agree



Life is full of misery

Oh dreams are like memories

Bringing back

The love that used to be



Tears, so many I can't see

Oh yes, don't mean a thing to me

Oh, don't go by

Still I can be free
