<lyrics>


<l>Some people die for hate

</l>
<l>Some die for love

</l>
<l>Some die because

</l>
<l>They don't have mate

</l>
<l>But all I want

</l>
<l>All I want is a little love

</l>
<l>All I've ever wanted, people

</l>
<l>All I want is just a little love



</l>
<l>All I want (All I want)

</l>
<l>A little bit of love (A little bit of love)

</l>
<l>All I want (All I want)

</l>
<l>Is a little bit of love (Is a little bit of love)

</l>
<l>All I want (All I want)

</l>
<l>Is just a little bit of love (Is just a little bit of love)



</l>
<l>Everybody say the world is large

</l>
<l>But to me it's very small

</l>
<l>Out of all of these women

</l>
<l>I can't find no true love at all

</l>
<l>All I want

</l>
<l>Is just a little love

</l>
<l>All I've ever wanted, mm

</l>
<l>Is just a little love



</l>
<l>All I want (All I want)

</l>
<l>Is a little bit of love (Is a little bit of love)

</l>
<l>All I want (All I want)

</l>
<l>Is a little bit of love (Is a little bit of love)

</l>
<l>I say all I want (All I want)

</l>
<l>Is just a little bit of love (Is just a little bit of love)



</l>
<l>All I want (All I want)

</l>
<l>Is a little bit of love (Is a little bit of love)

</l>
<l>All I need (All I need)

</l>
<l>Is a little bit of love (Is a little bit of love)

</l>
<l>All I want (All I want)

</l>
<l>Is just a little bit of love (Is just a little bit of love)



</l>
<l>All I want

</l>
<l>Is a little bit of love

</l>
<l>All I want

</l>
<l>Is a little bit of love

</l>
<l>All I want

</l>
<l>Is just a little bit of love</l></lyrics></xml>
