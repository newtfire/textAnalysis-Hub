<lyrics>



Some people die for hate

Some die for love

Some die because

They don't have mate

But all I want

All I want is a little love

All I've ever wanted, people

All I want is just a little love



All I want (All I want)

A little bit of love (A little bit of love)

All I want (All I want)

Is a little bit of love (Is a little bit of love)

All I want (All I want)

Is just a little bit of love (Is just a little bit of love)



Everybody say the world is large

But to me it's very small

Out of all of these women

I can't find no true love at all

All I want

Is just a little love

All I've ever wanted, mm

Is just a little love



All I want (All I want)

Is a little bit of love (Is a little bit of love)

All I want (All I want)

Is a little bit of love (Is a little bit of love)

I say all I want (All I want)

Is just a little bit of love (Is just a little bit of love)



All I want (All I want)

Is a little bit of love (Is a little bit of love)

All I need (All I need)

Is a little bit of love (Is a little bit of love)

All I want (All I want)

Is just a little bit of love (Is just a little bit of love)



All I want

Is a little bit of love

All I want

Is a little bit of love

All I want

Is just a little bit of love
