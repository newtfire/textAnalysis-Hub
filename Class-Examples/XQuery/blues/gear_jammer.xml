<lyrics>


<l>Running my rig around ninety-five,

</l>
<l>rockin' and rollin' in overdrive

</l>
<l>My heart's beating like a jackhammer,

</l>
<l>it's the midnight ride for the gear jammer



</l>
<l>Nine long days through twenty-three states,

</l>
<l>I gotta see my baby soon you know I just can't wait

</l>
<l>The police catch me I'll end up in the slammer,

</l>
<l>'cause the law don't want no gear jammer



</l>
<l>Running my rig in a mighty high gear,

</l>
<l>I don't care where I go just long as it ain't here

</l>
<l>Something gets in my way you know I'm gonna ram it,

</l>
<l>nobody fools around with this gear jammer



</l>
<l>Running my rig about ninety-five,

</l>
<l>I'm a-rockin' and a-rollin' in overdrive

</l>
<l>My heart's beating like a jackhammer,

</l>
<l>don't you get in the way of this gear jammer</l></lyrics></xml>
