<lyrics>



Running my rig around ninety-five,

rockin' and rollin' in overdrive

My heart's beating like a jackhammer,

it's the midnight ride for the gear jammer



Nine long days through twenty-three states,

I gotta see my baby soon you know I just can't wait

The police catch me I'll end up in the slammer,

'cause the law don't want no gear jammer



Running my rig in a mighty high gear,

I don't care where I go just long as it ain't here

Something gets in my way you know I'm gonna ram it,

nobody fools around with this gear jammer



Running my rig about ninety-five,

I'm a-rockin' and a-rollin' in overdrive

My heart's beating like a jackhammer,

don't you get in the way of this gear jammer
