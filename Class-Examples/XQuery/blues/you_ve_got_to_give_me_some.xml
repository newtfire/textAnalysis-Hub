<l>Loving is the thing I crave

</l>
<l>For your love I'll be your slave

</l>
<l>You gotta give me some, yes give me some

</l>
<l>Can't you hear me pleading, you gotta give me some



</l>
<l>Said mister Jones to old butcher Pete,

</l>
<l>I want a piece of your good old meat

</l>
<l>You gotta give me some, oh give me some

</l>
<l>I crave your round steak, you gotta give me some



</l>
<l>Sweet as candy in a candy shop

</l>
<l>Is just your sweet sweet lollipop

</l>
<l>You gotta give me some, please give me some

</l>
<l>I love all day suckers, you gotta give me some



</l>
<l>To the milkman I heard Mary scream

</l>
<l>Said she wanted a lots of cream

</l>
<l>You gotta give me some, oh give me some

</l>
<l>Catch it when you come sir, you gotta give me some



</l>
<l>Hear my cryin' on my bended knees

</l>
<l>If you wanna put my soul at ease

</l>
<l>You gotta give me some, please give me some

</l>
<l>Can't stand it any longer, you gotta give me some



</l>
<l>Seeper called to Pele-Mele, sugar lump

</l>
<l>Said I'm going crazy about your hump

</l>
<l>You've got to give me some, please give me some

</l>
<l>I can't wait eight days, you gotta give me some



</l>
<l>Jay bird said to the peckerwood,

</l>
<l>I like to peck like a pecker should

</l>
<l>But give me some, yes give me some

</l>
<l>I'm crazy about them worms, you've gotta give me some</l></lyrics></xml>
