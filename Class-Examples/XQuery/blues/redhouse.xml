There's a redhouse
1
 over yonder, that's where my
baby stays

Lord, there's a redhouse over yonder, Lord, that's where my baby
stays

I ain't been home to see my baby in, ninety-nine and one half
days



Wait a minute, something's wrong here, the key won't unlock this
door

Wait a minute, something's wrong, Lord, have mercy, this key won't
unlock this door

Something's goin' on here

I have a bad bad feeling that my baby, don't live here no more



Well, I might as well a go back over yonder, way back up on the
hill,

That 's something to do

Lord, I might as well go back over yonder, way back yonder cross the
hill

'Cause if my baby don't love me no more, I know her sister will

Note 1: redhouse, a house of prostitution, a whorehouse. There would
often be a red light lit over the front door to alert those who were
looking for some action as a means of saying "Hey, here's where you
get that stuff!" Though you will not likely find red lights burning
outside a brothel today, historically speaking, areas of a city where
there were concentrations of such places were known as "red-light
districts". Thanks to Larry Haston from Tennessee, "a native U.S.
Southerner and a blues freak", for this contribution to the list.
Sounds to me like Larry knows what he's talkin' 'bout ;-).
