<lyrics>


<l>When I first thought to 

hobo
'in,
hobo'in,


</l>
<l>I took a freight train to be my friend, oh Lord

</l>
<l>You know I hobo'd, hobo'd, hobo'd, hobo'd,

</l>
<l>hobo'd a long, long way from home, oh Lord



</l>
<l>Yes, my mother followed me that mornin', me that mornin'

</l>
<l>She followed me down to the yard, oh yeah

</l>
<l>She said my son he'd gone, he'd gone, he'd gone

</l>
<l>Yes he's gone 

in a, poorsome wear
*, oh yeah




</l>
<l>Yes I left my dear old mother, dear old mother

</l>
<l>I left my honor, 
need
* a crime, oh Lord

</l>
<l>Take care of my child,

</l>
<l>take care, take care of my child



</l>
