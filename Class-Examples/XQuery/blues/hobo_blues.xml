<lyrics>



When I first thought to 
hobo
'in,
hobo'in,

I took a freight train to be my friend, oh Lord

You know I hobo'd, hobo'd, hobo'd, hobo'd,

hobo'd a long, long way from home, oh Lord



Yes, my mother followed me that mornin', me that mornin'

She followed me down to the yard, oh yeah

She said my son he'd gone, he'd gone, he'd gone

Yes he's gone 
in a, poorsome wear
*, oh yeah



Yes I left my dear old mother, dear old mother

I left my honor, 
need
* a crime, oh Lord

Take care of my child,

take care, take care of my child



_________


* I'm not sure about the underlined parts in the 2nd and 3rd
