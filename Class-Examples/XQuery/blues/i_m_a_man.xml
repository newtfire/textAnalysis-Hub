<lyrics>



Now when I was a little boy,

at the age of five

I had somethin' in my pocket,

keep a lot of folks alive



Now I'm a man,

made twenty-one

You know baby,

we can have a lot of fun



I'm a man,

I spell M-A-N, man



All you pretty women,

stand in line

I can make love to you baby,

in an hour's time



I'm a man,

I spell M-A-N, man



I goin' back down,

to Kansas Stew

Bring back the second cousin,


Little Johnny the
cocheroo



I'm a man,

I spell M-A-N, man



The line I shoot,

will never miss

The way I make love to 'em,

they can't resist



I'm a man,

I spell M-A-N, man
