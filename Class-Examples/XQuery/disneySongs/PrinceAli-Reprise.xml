            <ln n="1"> Jafar, Jasmine </ln>
            <ln n="2"> Prince Ali, yes it is he, but not as you know him </ln>
            <ln n="3"> Read my lips and come to grips with reality </ln>
            <ln n="4"> Yes, meet a blast from your past </ln>
            <ln n="5"> Whose lies were too good to last </ln>
            <ln n="6"> Say hello to your precious Prince Ali! </ln>

            <ln n="7"> So Ali turns out to be merely Aladdin </ln>
            <ln n="8"> Just a con, need I go on, take it from me </ln>
            <ln n="9"> His personality flaws give me adequate cause </ln>
            <ln n="10"> To send him packing on a one-way trip so his prospects take a terminal dip </ln>
            <ln n="11"> His assets frozen, the venue chosen is in the ends of the Earth </ln>
            <ln n="12"> Salaam, ex-prince Ali! </ln>
