            <ln n="1">Oh, imagine a land, it's a faraway place</ln>
            <ln n="2">Where the caravan camels roam</ln>
            <ln n="3">Where you wander among every culture and tongue</ln>
            <ln n="4">It's chaotic, but, hey, it's home</ln>
        </lg>

        <lg n="2">
            <ln n="5">When the wind's from the East, and the sun's from the West</ln>
            <ln n="6">And the sand in the glass is right</ln>
            <ln n="7">Come on down, stop on by</ln>
            <ln n="8">Hop a carpet and fly</ln>
            <ln n="9">To another Arabian night</ln>
        </lg>

        <lg n="3">
            <ln n="10">As you wind through the streets at the fabled bazaars</ln>
            <ln n="11">With the cardamom-cluttered stalls</ln>
            <ln n="12">You can smell every spice</ln>
            <ln n="13">While you haggle the price</ln>
            <ln n="14">Of the silks and the satin shawls</ln>
        </lg>

        <lg n="4">
            <ln n="15">Oh, the music that plays as you move through a maze</ln>
            <ln n="16">In the haze of your pure delight</ln>
            <ln n="17">You are caught in a dance</ln>
            <ln n="18">You are lost in the trance</ln>
            <ln n="19">Of another Arabian night</ln>
        </lg>

        <lg n="5">
            <ln n="20">Arabian nights</ln>
            <ln n="21">Like Arabian days</ln>
            <ln n="22">More often than not are hotter than hot</ln>
            <ln n="23">In a lot of good ways</ln>
        </lg>

        <lg n="6">
            <ln n="24">Arabian nights</ln>
            <ln n="25">Like Arabian dreams</ln>
            <ln n="26">This mystical land of magic and sand</ln>
            <ln n="27">Is more than it seems</ln>
        </lg>

        <lg n="7">
            <ln n="28">There's a road that may lead you</ln>
            <ln n="29">To good or to greed through</ln>
            <ln n="30">The power your wishing commands</ln>
            <ln n="31">Let the darkness unfold or find fortunes untold</ln>
            <ln n="32">Well, your destiny lies in your hands</ln>
        </lg>

        <lg n="8">
            <ln n="33">Arabian nights</ln>
            <ln n="34">Like Arabian days</ln>
            <ln n="35">They seem to excite, take off and take flight</ln>
            <ln n="36">To shock and amaze</ln>
        </lg>

        <lg n="9">
            <ln n="37">Arabian nights</ln>
            <ln n="38">'Neath Arabian moons</ln>
            <ln n="39">A fool off his guard could fall and fall hard</ln>
            <ln n="40">Out there on the dunes</ln>
