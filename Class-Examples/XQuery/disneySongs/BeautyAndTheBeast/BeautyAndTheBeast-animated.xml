    <ln n="1"><char ref="#Potts">Mrs. Potts:</char>Tale as old as time</ln>
    <ln n="2">True as it can be</ln>
    <ln n="3">Barely even friends</ln>
    <ln n="4">Then somebody bends</ln>
    <ln n="5">Unexpectedly</ln>
</lg>

<lg n="2">
    <ln n="6">Just a little change</ln>
    <ln n="7">Small to say the least</ln>
    <ln n="8">Both a little scared</ln>
    <ln n="9">Neither one prepared</ln>
    <ln n="10">Beauty and the Beast</ln>
</lg>

<lg n="3">
    <ln n="11">Ever just the same</ln>
    <ln n="12">Ever a surprise</ln>
    <ln n="13">Ever as before</ln>
    <ln n="14">Ever just as sure</ln>
    <ln n="15">As the sun will rise</ln>

<lg n="4">
    <ln n="16">Tale as old as time</ln>
    <ln n="17">Tune as old as song</ln>
    <ln n="18">Bittersweet and strange</ln>
    <ln n="19">Finding you can change</ln>
    <ln n="20">Learning you were wrong</ln>
</lg>
    
<lg n="5">
    <ln n="21">Certain as the sun</ln>
    <ln n="22">Rising in the east</ln>
    <ln n="23">Tale as old as time</ln>
    <ln n="24">Song as old as rhyme</ln>
    <ln n="25">Beauty and the Beast</ln>
