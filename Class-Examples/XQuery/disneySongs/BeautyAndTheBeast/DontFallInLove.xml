    <ln n="1"><char ref="#Forte">Forte:</char> The quickest way to break your heart</ln>
    <ln n="2">Make you depressed and ill</ln>
    <ln n="3">Is to get tangled up inside</ln>
    <ln n="4">The side effects could kill</ln>
</lg>
    
<lg n="2">
    <ln n="5">All passion is a waste of time</ln>
    <ln n="6">A deadly game pour vous</ln>
    <ln n="7">I am your friend, your cher ami</ln>
    <ln n="8">I wouldn't lie to you</ln>
</lg>

<lg n="3">
    <ln n="9">If you must love someone, may I suggest</ln>
    <ln n="10">You love yourself! Just think it through</ln>
    <ln n="11">You'll never leave and you will find</ln>
    <ln n="12">You'll get more rest</ln>
    <ln n="13">You'll always feel as good as new</ln>
    <ln n="14">Your freedom is the most</ln>
    <ln n="15">Important thing, my friend</ln>
</lg>

<lg n="4">
    <ln n="16">You must be strong, you mustn't bend</ln>
    <ln n="17">Don't talk for hours</ln>
    <ln n="18">Don't send flowers</ln>
    <ln n="19">Don't write poems</ln>
    <ln n="20">Don't sing songs and dance</ln>
    <ln n="21">Beneath the stars</ln>
    <ln n="22">That shine above</ln>
    <ln n="23">Don't fall in love</ln>
</lg>

<lg n="5">
    <ln n="24">As soon as your heart rules your head</ln>
    <ln n="25">Your life is not your own</ln>
    <ln n="26">It's hell when someone's always there</ln>
    <ln n="27">It's bliss to be alone</ln>
    <ln n="28">And love of any kind is bad</ln>
    <ln n="29">A dog, a child, a cat</ln>
    <ln n="30">They take up so much precious time</ln>
    <ln n="31">Now where's the sense in that?</ln>
</lg>

<lg n="6">
    <ln n="32">Love takes the wildest heart and makes it tame</ln>
    <ln n="33">If you're turned on, then just turn off</ln>
    <ln n="34">Emotions are a thing all great men overcame</ln>
    <ln n="35">Please, don't make this grande catastrophe</ln>
    <ln n="36">Don't get attached to anyone or anything</ln>
    <ln n="37">There's nothing worse than things that cling</ln>
</lg>

<lg n="7">
    <ln n="38">You'll go to pot</ln>
    <ln n="39">You'll turn to drink</ln>
    <ln n="40">You'll never rest</ln>
    <ln n="41">You'll end up mad and</ln>
    <ln n="42">Looking like some</ln>
    <ln n="43">Poor demented dove</ln>
    <ln n="44">Don't fall in love</ln>
    <ln n="45">Don't fall in love</ln>
