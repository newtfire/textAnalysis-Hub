            <ln n="1">Did you ever wonder what it's like</ln>
            <ln n="2">To wonder from a different point of view?</ln>
            <ln n="3">To try and see life differently</ln>
            <ln n="4">While doing what somebody else might do?</ln>
            <ln n="5">Imagine seeing through a set of different eyes</ln>
            <ln n="6">You just might be surprised</ln>
            <ln n="7">You just might realize</ln>

            <ln n="11">A little care</ln>
            <ln n="12">A little "when you ever need me, I'll be there"</ln>

            <ln n="17">A little space</ln>
            <ln n="18">A little chance to help somebody find their place</ln>
            <ln n="19">It isn't much, but it means a lot</ln>
            <ln n="20">It's not a little thing to have a little thought</ln>
