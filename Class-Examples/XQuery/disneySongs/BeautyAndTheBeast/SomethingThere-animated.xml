    <ln n="1"><char ref="#Belle">Belle:</char> There's something sweet and almost kind</ln>
    <ln n="2">But he was mean, and he was coarse and unrefined</ln>
    <ln n="3">And now he's dear and so unsure</ln>
    <ln n="4">I wonder why I didn't see it there before</ln>
</lg>

<lg n="2">
    <ln n="5"><char ref="#Beast">Beast:</char> She glanced this way, I thought I saw</ln>
    <ln n="6">And when we touched she didn't shudder at my paw</ln>
    <ln n="7">No it can't be, I'll just ignore</ln>
    <ln n="8">But then she's never looked at me that way before</ln>
</lg>

<lg n="3">
    <ln n="9"><char ref="#Belle">Belle:</char> New and a bit alarming</ln>
    <ln n="10">Who'd have ever thought that this could be?</ln>
    <ln n="11">True that he's no Prince Charming</ln>
    <ln n="12">But there's something in him that I simply didn't see</ln>
</lg>

<lg n="4">
    <ln n="13"><char ref="#Castleware">Castleware:</char> Well, who'd have thought?</ln>
    <ln n="14">Well, bless my soul</ln>
    <ln n="15">Well, who'd have known?</ln>
    <ln n="16">Well, who indeed?</ln>
    <ln n="17">And who'd have guessed they'd come together on their own?</ln>
    <ln n="18">It's so peculiar</ln>
</lg>
    
<lg n="5">
    <ln n="19">Wait and see a few days more</ln>
    <ln n="20">There may be something there that wasn't there before</ln>
    <ln n="21">There may be something there that wasn't there before</ln>
    <ln n="22">There may be something there that wasn't there before</ln>
