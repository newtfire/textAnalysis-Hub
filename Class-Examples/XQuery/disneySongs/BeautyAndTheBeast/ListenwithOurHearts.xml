            <ln n="1">There are times I think</ln>
            <ln n="2">That no one seems to listen</ln>
            <ln n="3">There are times I think they listen</ln>
            <ln n="4">But don't hear</ln>
            <ln n="5">There are times I think they hear</ln>
            <ln n="6">But something's missing</ln>
            <ln n="7">The thoughts behind the words aren't clear</ln>
            <ln n="8">So, I think they're saying</ln>
            <ln n="9">something they're not saying</ln>
            <ln n="10">They think I mean something</ln>
            <ln n="11">I don't mean at all</ln>
            <ln n="12">Do we raise our voice miscommunicating?</ln>
            <ln n="13">Or simply say nothing at all</ln>
            <ln n="14">Is there another way to say it</ln>
            <ln n="15">In a way that can be heard?</ln>
            <ln n="16">Let me see if I can put it into words</ln>
        </lg>

        <lg n="2">
            <ln n="17">I can hear you, you can hear me</ln>
            <ln n="18">When we listen with our hearts</ln>
            <ln n="19">I understand you, you understand me</ln>
            <ln n="20">That's the place where we can start</ln>
            <ln n="21">Words of kindness and forgiveness</ln>
            <ln n="22">Bring us closer, not apart</ln>
            <ln n="23">When we speak our minds</ln>
            <ln n="24">And listen with our hearts</ln>
        </lg>

            <ln n="25">I can hear you, you can hear me</ln>
            <ln n="26">When we listen with our hearts</ln>
            <ln n="27">I understand you, you understand me</ln>
            <ln n="28">That's the place where we can start</ln>
            <ln n="29">Words of kindness and forgiveness</ln>
            <ln n="30">Bring us closer, not apart</ln>
            <ln n="31">When we speak our minds</ln>
            <ln n="32">And listen with our hearts</ln>
            <ln n="33">And listen with our hearts.</ln>
