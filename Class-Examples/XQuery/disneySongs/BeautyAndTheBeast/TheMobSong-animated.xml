    <ln n="1"><char ref="#Townies">Townies:</char> We're not safe until he's dead</ln>
    <ln n="2">He'll come stalking us at night</ln>
    <ln n="3">Set to sacrifice our children to his monstrous appetite</ln>
    <ln n="4">He'll wreak havoc on our village if we let him wander free</ln>

    <ln n="6">It's time to follow me</ln>

    <ln n="7"><char ref="#Townies">Townies:</char>Through the mist, through the woods</ln>
    <ln n="8">Through the darkness and the shadows</ln>
    <ln n="9">It's a nightmare, but it's one exciting ride</ln>
</lg>

<lg n="4">
    <ln n="10">Say a prayer, then we're there</ln>
    <ln n="11">At the drawbridge of a castle</ln>
    <ln n="12">And there's something truly terrible inside</ln>
</lg>

<lg n="5">
    <ln n="13">It's a beast; he's got fangs, razor-sharp ones</ln>
    <ln n="14">Massive paws, killer claws for the feast</ln>
</lg>

<lg n="6">
    <ln n="15">Hear him roar, see him foam</ln>
    <ln n="16">But we're not coming home</ln>
    <ln n="17">Till he's dead, good and dead!</ln>
    <ln n="18">Kill the Beast!</ln>
</lg>

<lg n="7">
    <ln n="19">Light your torch, mount your horse</ln>

</lg>

<lg n="10">
    <ln n="22">Through the mist, through the wood</ln>
    <ln n="23">Where within a haunted castle</ln>
    <ln n="24">Something's lurking that you don't see every day</ln>
</lg>

<lg n="11">
    <ln n="25">It's a beast, one as tall as a mountain</ln>
    <ln n="26">We won't rest till he's good and deceased</ln>
    <ln n="27">Sally forth! Tally ho!</ln>
    <ln n="28">Grab your sword! Grab your bow!</ln>
    <ln n="29">Praise the Lord and here we go!</ln>
</lg>

<lg n="12">
    <ln n="30">We don't like what we don't understand</ln>
    <ln n="31">In fact, it scares us</ln>
    <ln n="32">And this monster is mysterious at least</ln>
    <ln n="33">Bring your guns! Bring your knives!</ln>
    <ln n="34">Save your children and your wives</ln>
    <ln n="35">We'll save our village and our lives</ln>
    <ln n="36">We'll kill the Beast!</ln>

    <ln n="37"><char ref="#Castleware">Castleware:</char> Hearts ablaze, banners high</ln>
    <ln n="38">We go marching into battle</ln>
    <ln n="39">Unafraid, although the danger just increased</ln>
</lg>

<lg n="14">
    <ln n="40"><char ref="#Townies">Townies:</char> Raise the flag! Sing the song!</ln>
    <ln n="41">Here we come, we're fifty strong</ln>
    <ln n="42">And fifty Frenchmen can't be wrong</ln>
    <ln n="43">Let's kill the Beast!</ln>
