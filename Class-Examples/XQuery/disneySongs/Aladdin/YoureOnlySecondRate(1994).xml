            <ln n="2">I bet you've got a bunny under your hat </ln>
            <ln n="3">Now here's your chance to get the best of me</ln>
            <ln n="4">Hope your hand is hot</ln>
            <ln n="5">C'mon, clown, let's see what you've got</ln>
        </lg>

        <lg n="2">
            <ln n="6">You try to slam me with your hardest stuff</ln>
            <ln n="7">But your double whammy isn't up to snuff</ln>
        </lg>

        <lg n="3">
            <ln n="8">I'll set the record straight</ln>
            <ln n="9">You're simply out of date</ln>
            <ln n="10">You're only second rate!</ln>
        </lg>

        <lg n="4">
            <ln n="11">You think your cat's a meanie, but your tiger's tame</ln>
            <ln n="12">You've got a lot to learn about the genie game</ln>
            <ln n="13">So for your education I'll reiterate</ln>
            <ln n="14">You're only second rate!</ln>
        </lg>

        <lg n="5">
            <ln n="15">Men cower at the power in my pinky</ln>
            <ln n="16">My thumb is number one on every list</ln>
            <ln n="17">But if you're not convinced that I'm invincible</ln>
            <ln n="18">Put me to the test</ln>
            <ln n="19">I'd love to lay this rivalry to rest</ln>
        </lg>

        <lg n="6">
            <ln n="20">Go ahead and zap me with the big surprise</ln>
            <ln n="21">Snap me in a trap, cut me down to size</ln>
            <ln n="22">I'll make a great escape</ln>
            <ln n="23">It's just a piece of cake</ln>
            <ln n="24">You're only second rate!</ln>
        </lg>

        <lg n="7">
            <ln n="25">You know, your hocus-pocus isn't tough enough</ln>
            <ln n="26">And your mumbo-jumbo doesn't measure up</ln>
            <ln n="27">Let me pontificate upon your sorry state</ln>
            <ln n="28">You're only second rate!</ln>
        </lg>

        <lg n="8">
            <ln n="29">Zaba-caba-dabra!</ln>
            <ln n="30">Granny's gonna grab ya!</ln>
            <ln n="31">Alakazam-da-mus</ln>
            <ln n="32">And this thing's bigger than the both of us</ln>
        </lg>

        <lg n="9">
            <ln n="33">So spare me your tremendous scare</ln>
            <ln n="34">You look horrendous in your underwear</ln>
            <ln n="35">And I can hardly wait to discombobulate</ln>
            <ln n="36">I'll send ya back and packing in a shipping crate</ln>
            <ln n="37">You'd make a better living with a spinning plate</ln>
            <ln n="38">You're only second rate!</ln>
