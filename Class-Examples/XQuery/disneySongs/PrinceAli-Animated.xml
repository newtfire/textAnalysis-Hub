            <ln n="11">Prince Ali! Fabulous he, Ali Ababwa</ln>
            <ln n="12">Genuflect, show some respect</ln>
            <ln n="13">Down on one knee</ln>
            <ln n="14">Now, try your best to stay calm</ln>
            <ln n="15">Brush up your Sunday salaam</ln>
            <ln n="16">Then come and meet his spectacular coterie</ln>
        </lg>

            <ln n="17">Prince Ali! Mighty is he, Ali Ababwa</ln>
            <ln n="18">Strong as ten regular men, definitely</ln>
            <ln n="19">He faced the galloping hordes</ln>
            <ln n="20">A hundred bad guys with swords</ln>
            <ln n="21">Who sent those goons to their lords?</ln>
            <ln n="22">Why, Prince Ali</ln>
        </lg>

            <ln n="24">Purple peacocks, he's got fifty-three</ln>
            <ln n="25">When it comes to exotic-type mammals</ln>
            <ln n="26">Has he got a zoo?</ln>
            <ln n="27">I'm telling you, it's a world-class menagerie</ln>

            <ln n="28">Prince Ali! Handsome is he, Ali Ababwa</ln>
            <ln n="29">That physique! How can I speak</ln>
            <ln n="30">Weak at the knee</ln>
            <ln n="31">Well, get on out in that square</ln>
            <ln n="32">Adjust your veil and prepare</ln>
            <ln n="33">To gawk and grovel and stare at Prince Ali</ln>
        </lg>

        <lg n="8">
            <ln n="34">He's got ninety-five white Persian monkeys</ln>
            <ln n="35">(He's got the monkeys, let's see the monkeys)</ln>
            <ln n="36">And to view them he charges no fee</ln>
            <ln n="37">(He's generous, so generous)</ln>
            <ln n="38">He's got slaves, he's got servants and flunkies</ln>
            <ln n="39">(Proud to work for him)</ln>
            <ln n="40">They bow to his whim, love serving him</ln>
            <ln n="41">They're just lousy with loyalty to Ali!</ln>
            <ln n="42">Prince Ali!</ln>

            <ln n="43">Prince Ali! Amorous he, Ali Ababwa</ln>
            <ln n="44">Heard your princess was a sight lovely to see</ln>
            <ln n="45">And that, good people, is why</ln>
            <ln n="46">He got dolled up and dropped by</ln>
            <ln n="47">With sixty elephants, llamas galore</ln>
            <ln n="48">With his bears and lions</ln>
            <ln n="49">A brass band and more</ln>
            <ln n="50">With his forty fakirs, his cooks, his bakers</ln>
            <ln n="51">His birds that warble on key</ln>
            <ln n="52">Make way</ln>
            <ln n="53">For Prince Ali!</ln>
