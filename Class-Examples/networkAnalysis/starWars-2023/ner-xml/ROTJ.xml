 <title>Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the <name type="ORG">Jedi</name> (1983)</title>
by <writer>Lawrence Kasdan &amp; George Lucas</writer>


<script>The boundless heavens serve as a back-drop for the MAIN TITLE, followed 
by a ROLL-UP, which crawls into infinity.

<subTitle epNum="6">EPISODE 6 RETURN OF THE JEDI</subTitle>

<crawl>Luke Skywalker has returned to his home planet of Tatooine in an 
attempt to rescue his friend <name type="NORP">Han</name> Solo from the clutches of the vile 
gangster Jabba the <name type="ORG">Hut</name>t. Little does Luke know that the GALACTIC EMPIRE 
has secretly begun construction on a new armored space station even 
more powerful than the first dreaded Death Star. When completed, this 
ultimate weapon will spell certain doom for the small band of <name type="ORG">Rebels</name> 
struggling to restore freedom to the galaxy...</crawl>

<sd>PAN DOWN to reveal a monstrous half-completed Death Star, its massive 
superstructure curling away from the completed section like the arms of 
a giant octopus. Beyond, in benevolent contrast, floats the small, 
green moon of ENDOR.</sd>

<sd>An <name type="ORG">Imperial</name> <name type="ORG">Star Destroyer</name> moves overhead toward the massive armored 
space station, followed by two zipping <name type="ORG">TIE</name> fighters. A small <name type="ORG">Imperial</name> 
shuttle rockets from the main bay of the ship and hustles toward the 
Death Star.</sd>

<setting>2    INT IMPERIAL SHUTTLE - COCKPIT </setting>
The shuttle captain makes contact with <name type="ORG">the Death Star</name>.

<sp><speaker>SHUTTLE CAPTAIN</speaker>
Command station, this is <name type="FAC">ST 321</name>. Code Clearance Blue. We're starting 
our approach. Deactivate the security shield.</sp>

<sp><speaker>DEATH STAR CONTROLLER	(filtered VO)</speaker>
The security deflector shield will be deactivated when we have 
confirmation of your code transmission. Stand by... You are clear to 
proceed.</sp>

<sp><speaker>SHUTTLE CAPTAIN</speaker>
We're starting our approach.</sp>

<setting>3    INT DEATH STAR - CONTROL ROOM</setting>

<sd>Operators move about among the control panels. A SHIELD OPERATOR hits 
switches beside a large screen, on which is a display of the Death 
Star, <name type="LOC">the moon</name> Endor, and a bright web delineating the invisible 
deflector shield.</sd>

<sd>A control officer rushes over to the shield operator.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OFFICER</speaker>
Inform the commander that Lord Vader's shuttle has arrived.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OPERATOR</speaker>
Yes, sir.</sp>

<sd>The control officer moves to a view port and watches as the <name type="ORG">Imperial</name> 
shuttle lands in the massive docking bay. A squad of <name type="ORG">Imperial</name> 
stormtroopers moves into formation before the craft.</sd>

<setting>4    INT DEATH STAR - MAIN DOCKING BAY</setting>

<sd>The DEATH STAR COMMANDER, MOFF JERJERROD, a tall, confident technocrat, 
strides through the assembled troops to the base of the shuttle ramp. 
The troops snap to attention; many are uneasy about the new arrival. 
But <name type="ORG">the Death Star</name> commander stands arrogantly tall.</sd>

<sd>The exit hatch of the shuttle opens with a WHOOSH, revealing only 
darkness. Then, heavy FOOTSTEPS AND MECHANICAL BREATHING. From this 
black void appears DARTH VADER, LORD OF THE SITH. Vader looks over the 
assemblage as he walks down the ramp.</sd>

<sp><speaker>JERJERROD</speaker>
Lord Vader, this is an unexpected pleasure. We're honored by your 
presence.</sp>

<sp><speaker>VADER</speaker>
You may dispense with the pleasantries, Commander. I'm here to put you 
back on
schedule.</sp>

<sd>The commander turns ashen and begins to shake.</sd>

<sp><speaker>JERJERROD</speaker>
I assure you, Lord Vader, my men are working as fast as they can.</sp>

<sp><speaker>VADER</speaker>
Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them.</sp>

<sp><speaker>JERJERROD</speaker>
I tell you, this station will be operational as planned.</sp>

<sp><speaker>VADER</speaker>
The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation.</sp>

<sp><speaker>JERJERROD</speaker>
But he asks the impossible. I need more men.</sp>

<sp><speaker>VADER</speaker>
Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives.</sp>

<sp><speaker>JERJERROD	 (aghast)</speaker>
The Emperor's coming here?</sp>

<sp><speaker>VADER</speaker>
That is correct, Commander. And he is most displeased with your 
apparent lack of progress.</sp>

<sp><speaker>JERJERROD</speaker>
We shall double our efforts.</sp>

<sp><speaker>VADER</speaker>
I hope so, Commander, for your sake. The Emperor is not as forgiving as 
I am.</sp>

<setting>5    EXT ROAD TO JABBA'S PALACE - TATOOINE</setting>

<sd>A lonely, windswept road meanders through the desolate Tatooine 
terrain. We HEAR a familiar BEEPING and a distinctive reply before 
catching sight of <name type="ORG">ARTOO</name>-DETOO and SEE-THREEPIO, making their way along 
the road toward the ominous palace of Jabba the <name type="ORG">Hut</name>t.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
Of course I'm worried. And you should be, too. <name type="GPE">Lando</name> Calrissian and 
poor Chewbacca never returned from this awful place.</sp>

<sd><name type="GPE">Artoo</name> whistles timidly.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
Don't be so sure. If I told you half the things I've heard about this 
Jabba the <name type="ORG">Hut</name>t, you'd probably short-circuit.</sp>

<sd>The two droids fearfully approach the massive gate to the palace.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
<name type="GPE">Artoo</name>, are you sure this is the right place? I better knock, I suppose.</sp>

<setting>6    EXT JABBA'S PALACE - GATE </setting>

<sd><name type="ORG">Threepio</name> looks around for some kind of signaling device, then timidly 
knocks on the iron door.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO	 (instantly) </speaker>
There doesn't seem to be anyone there. Let's go back and tell Master 
Luke.</sp>

<sd>A small hatch in the middle of the door opens and a spidery mechanical 
arm, with a large electronic eyeball on the end, pops out and inspects 
the two droids.</sd>

<sp><speaker>STRANGE VOICE</speaker>
Tee chuta hhat yudd!</sp>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
Goodness gracious me!</sp>

 <name type="ORG">Threepio</name> points to <name type="GPE">Artoo</name>, then to himself.

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
<name type="GPE">Artoo</name> Detoowha bo Seethreepiowha ey toota odd mischka Jabba du <name type="ORG">Hut</name>t.</sp>

<sd>The eye looks from one robot to the other, there is a laugh then the 
eye zips back into the door. The hatch slams shut. <name type="GPE">Artoo</name> beeps his 
concern.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
I don't think they're going to let us in, <name type="GPE">Artoo</name>. We'd better go.</sp>

<sd><name type="GPE">Artoo</name> beeps his reluctance as <name type="ORG">Threepio</name> turns to leave. Suddenly the 
massive door starts to rise with a horrific metallic SCREECH. The 
robots turn back and face an endless black cavity. The droids look at 
one another, afraid to enter.</sd>

<sd><name type="GPE">Artoo</name> starts forward into the gloom. <name type="ORG">Threepio</name> rushes after his stubby 
companion. The door lowers noisily behind them.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO </speaker>
<name type="GPE">Artoo</name>, wait. Oh, dear! <name type="GPE">Artoo</name>. <name type="GPE">Artoo</name>, I really don't think we should 
rush into all this.</sp>

<sd><name type="GPE">Artoo</name> continues down the corridor, with <name type="ORG">Threepio</name> following.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
Oh, <name type="GPE">Artoo</name>!  <name type="GPE">Artoo</name>, wait for me!</sp>

<setting>7    INT JABBA'S PALACE - HALLWAY</setting>

<sd>The door slams shut with a loud crash that echoes throughout the dark 
passageway. The frightened robots are met by two giant, green GAMORREAN 
GUARDS, who fall in behind them. <name type="ORG">Threepio</name> glances quickly back at the 
two lumbering brutes, then back to <name type="GPE">Artoo</name>. One guard grunts an order. 
<name type="GPE">Artoo</name> beeps nervously.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
Just you deliver Master Luke's message and get us out of here. Oh my! 
Oh! Oh, no.</sp>

<sd>Walking toward them out of the darkness is BIB FORTUNA, a humanlike 
alien with long tentacles protruding from his skull.</sd>

<sp><speaker>BIB</speaker>
Die Wanna Wanga!</sp>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
Oh, my! Die Wanna Wauaga. We -- we bring a message to your master, 
Jabba the <name type="ORG">Hut</name>t.</sp>

<sd><name type="GPE">Artoo</name> lets out a series of quick beeps.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO	 (cont)</speaker>
...and a gift.
(thinks a moment, then to <name type="GPE">Artoo</name>)
Gift, what gift?</sp>

<sd>Bib shakes his head negatively.</sd>

<sp><speaker>BIB</speaker>
Nee Jabba no badda. Me chaade su goodie.</sp>

<sd>Bib holds out his hand toward <name type="GPE">Artoo</name> and the tiny droid backs up a bit, 
letting out a protesting array of squeaks. <name type="ORG">Threepio</name> turns to the 
strange-looking alien.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
He says that our instructions are to give it only to Jabba himself.</sp>

<sd>Bib thinks about this for a moment.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
I'm terribly sorry. I'm afraid he's ever so stubborn about these sort 
of things.</sp>

<sd>Bib gestures for the droids to follow.</sd>

<sp><speaker>BIB</speaker>
Nudd Chaa.</sp>

<sd>The droids follow the tall, tentacled alien into the darkness, trailed 
by the two guards.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
<name type="GPE">Artoo</name>, I have a bad feeling about this.</sp>

<setting>8    INT JABBA'S THRONE ROOM</setting>

<sd>The throne room is filled with the vilest, most grotesque CREATURES 
ever conceived in the universe. <name type="GPE">Artoo</name> and <name type="ORG">Threepio</name> seem very small as 
they pause in the doorway to the dimly lit chamber. Light shafts 
partially illuminate the drunken courtiers as Bib Fortuna crosses the 
room to the platform upon which rests the leader of this nauseating 
crowd: JABBA THE HUTT. The monarch of the galactic underworld is a 
repulsive blob of bloated fat with a maniacal grin. Chained to the 
horrible creature is the beautiful alien female dancer named OOLA. At 
the foot of the dais sits an obnoxious birdlike creature, SALACIOUS 
CRUMB. Bib whispers something in the slobbering degenerate's ear. Jabba 
laughs horribly, at the two terrified droids before him. <name type="ORG">Threepio</name> bows 
politely.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
Good morning.</sp>

<sp><speaker>JABBA</speaker>
Bo Shuda!</sp>

<sd>The robots jump forward to stand before the repulsive, loose-skinned 
villain.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
The message, <name type="GPE">Artoo</name>, the message.</sp>

<sd><name type="GPE">Artoo</name> whistles, and a beam of light projects from his domed head, 
creating a hologram of LUKE on the floor. The image grows to over ten 
feet tall, and the young <name type="ORG">Jedi</name> towers over the space gangsters.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
Greetings, Exalted One. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Luke 
Skywalker, <name type="ORG">Jedi</name> Knight and friend to Captain Solo. I know that you are 
powerful, mighty Jabba, and that your anger with Solo must be equally 
powerful. I seek an audience with Your Greatness to bargain for Solo's 
life. 
(Jabba's crowd laughs) 
With your wisdom, I'm sure that we can work out an arrangement which 
will be mutually beneficial and enable us to avoid any unpleasant 
confrontation. As a token of my goodwill, I present to you a gift: 
these two droids.</sp>

<sd><name type="ORG">Threepio</name> is startled by this announcement.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
What did he say?</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE	 (cont)</speaker>
... Both are hardworking and will serve you well.</sp>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
This can't be! <name type="GPE">Artoo</name>, you're playing the wrong message.</sp>

<sd>Luke's hologram disappears.</sd>

<sd>Jabba laughs while Bib speaks to him in <name type="ORG">Hut</name>tese.</sd>

<sp><speaker>JABBA	 (in <name type="ORG">Hut</name>tese subtitled)</speaker>
There will be no bargain.</sp>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
We're doomed.</sp>

<sp><speaker>JABBA	 (in <name type="ORG">Hut</name>tese subtitled)</speaker>
I will not give up my favorite decoration. I like Captain Solo where he 
is.</sp>

<sd>Jabba laughs hideously and looks toward an alcove beside the throne. 
<name type="NORP">Han</name>ging high, flat against the wall, exactly as we saw him last, is a 
carbonized HAN SOLO.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
<name type="GPE">Artoo</name>, look! Captain Solo. And he's still frozen in carbonite.</sp>

<setting>9    INT DUNGEON CORRIDOR </setting>

<sd>One of Jabba's Gamorrean guards marches <name type="GPE">Artoo</name> and <name type="ORG">Threepio</name> down a dank, 
shadowy passageway lined with holding cells. The cries of unspeakable 
creatures bounce off the cold stone walls. Occasionally a repulsive arm 
or tentacle grabs through the bars at the hapless droids. <name type="GPE">Artoo</name> beeps 
pitifully.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
What could possibly have come over Master Luke. Is it something I did? 
He never expressed any unhappiness with my work. Oh! Oh! Hold it! Ohh!</sp>

<sd>A large tentacle wraps around <name type="ORG">Threepio</name>'s neck. He manages to break 
free, and they move on to a door at the end of the corridor.</sd>

<setting>10   INT BOILER ROOM</setting>

<sd>The door slides open, revealing a room filled with steam and noisy 
machinery. The guard motions them into the boiler room, where they are 
met by a tall, thin humanlike robot named EV-9D9. Behind the robot can 
be seen a torture rack pulling the legs off a screaming baby work 
droid. A second power droid is upside down.  As smoking branding irons 
are pressed into his feet, the stubby robot lets out an agonized 
electronic scream. <name type="GPE">Artoo</name> and <name type="ORG">Threepio</name> cringe as the guard grunts to EV-
9D9.</sd>

<sp><speaker>NINEDENINE</speaker>
Ah, good. New acquisitions. You are a protocol droid, are you not?</sp>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
I am See-<name type="ORG">Threepio</name>, human-cy...</sp>

<sp><speaker>NINEDENINE</speaker>
Yes or no will do.</sp>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
Oh. Well, yes.</sp>

<sp><speaker>NINEDENINE</speaker>
How many languages do you speak?</sp>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
I am fluent in over six million forms of communication, and can 
readily...</sp>

<sp><speaker>NINEDENINE</speaker>
Splendid! We have been without an interpreter since our master got 
angry with our last protocol droid and disintegrated him.</sp>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
Disintegrated?</sp>

<sp><speaker>NINEDENINE	 (to a Gamorrean guard)</speaker>
Guard! This protocol droid might be useful. Fit him with a restraining 
bolt and take him back to His Excellency's main audience chamber.</sp>

<sd>The guard shoves <name type="ORG">Threepio</name> toward the door.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO	 (disappearing)</speaker>
<name type="GPE">Artoo</name>, don't leave me! Ohhh!</sp>

<sd><name type="GPE">Artoo</name> lets out a plaintive cry as the door closes. Then he beeps 
angrily.</sd>

<sp><speaker>NINEDENINE</speaker>
You're a feisty little one, but you'll soon learn some respect. I have 
need for you on the master's Sail Barge. And I think you'll fit in 
nicely.</sp>

<sd>The poor work droid in the background lets out another tortured 
electronic scream.</sd>

<setting>11   INT JABBA'S THRONE ROOM</setting>

<sd>The court of Jabba the <name type="ORG">Hut</name>t is in the midst of a drunken, raucous 
party. Sloppy, smelly monsters cheer and make rude noises as Oola and a 
fat female dancer perform in front of Jabba's throne.</sd>

<sd>Jabba leers at the dancers and with a lustful gleam in his eye beckons 
Oola to come and sit with him. She stops dancing and backs away, 
shaking her head. Jabba gets angry and points to a spot next to him.</sd>

<sp><speaker>JABBA</speaker>
Da Eitha!</sp>

<sd>The lovely alien shakes her head again and screams.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OOLA</speaker>
Na Chuba negatorie Na! Na! <name type="ORG">Natoota</name>...</sp>

<sd>Jabba is furious and pulls her toward him, tugging on the chain.</sd>

<sp><speaker>JABBA</speaker>
Boscka!</sp>

<sd>He pushes a button and, before the dancer can flee, a trap door in the 
floor springs open and swallows her up. As the door snaps shut, a 
muffled growl is followed by a hideous scream. Jabba and his monstrous 
friends laugh hysterically and several revelers hurry over to watch her 
fate through a grate.</sd>

<sd><name type="ORG">Threepio</name> cringes and glances wistfully at the carbonite form of <name type="NORP">Han</name> 
Solo, but is immediately distracted by a gunshot offscreen.�An 
unnatural quiet sweeps the boisterous gathering. On the far side of the 
room, the crush of debauchers moves aside to allow the approach of two 
guards followed by BOUSHH, an oddly cloaked bounty hunter, leading his 
captive, <name type="NORP">Han</name> Solo's copilot, CHEWBACCA THE WOOKIEE.</sd>

<sd>Bib takes his place next to his disgusting master, and whispers into 
his ear, pointing at Chewbacca and the bounty hunter. Jabba listens 
intently, then the bounty hunter bows before the gangster and speaks a 
greeting in a strange, electronically processed tongue (Ubese).</sd>

<sp><speaker>BOUSHH	 (in Ubese subtitled)</speaker>
I have come for the bounty on this <name type="NORP">Wookiee</name>.</sp>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
Oh, no! Chewbacca!</sp>

<sp><speaker>JABBA	 (in <name type="ORG">Hut</name>tese subtitled)</speaker>
At last we have the mighty Chewbacca.</sp>

<sd>Jabba lets out a loud, long, blood-curdling laugh and turns to 
<name type="ORG">Threepio</name>, waving him closer. The reluctant droid obeys.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
Oh, uh, yes, uh, I am here, Your Worshipfulness. Uh... yes!</sp>

<sd>Jabba continues speaking, as <name type="ORG">Threepio</name> nervously translates. Boushh 
listens, studying the dangerous creatures around the room. He notices 
BOBA FETT standing near the door.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
Oh. The illustrious Jabba bids you welcome and will gladly pay you the 
reward of twenty-five thousand.</sp>

<sp><speaker>BOUSHH	 (in Ubese subtitled)</speaker>
I want fifty thousand. No less.</sp>

<sd>Jabba immediately flies into a rage, knocking the golden droid off the 
raised throne into a clattering heap on the floor. Boushh adjusts his 
weapon as Jabba raves in <name type="ORG">Hut</name>tese and <name type="ORG">Threepio</name> struggles back onto the 
throne. The disheveled droid tries to compose himself.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
Uh, oh... but what, what did I say?
(to Boushh)
Uh, the mighty Jabba asks why he must pay fifty thousand.</sp>

<sd>The bounty hunter holds up a small silver ball in his hand. <name type="ORG">Threepio</name> 
looks at it, then looks at Jabba, then back to the bounty hunter. The 
droid is very nervous and Jabba is getting very impatient.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
Because he's holding a thermal detonator.</sp>

<sd>The guards instantly back away, as do most of the other monsters in the 
room. Jabba stares at the silver ball, which begins to glow in the 
bounty hunter's hand. The room has fallen into a tense hush. Jabba 
stares at the bounty hunter malevolently until a sly grin creeps across 
his vast mouth and he begins to laugh.</sd>

<sp><speaker>JABBA	 (in <name type="ORG">Hut</name>tese subtitled)</speaker>
This bounty hunter is my kind of scum. Fearless and inventive.</sp>

<sd>Jabba continues.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
Jabba offers the sum of thirty-five. And I suggest you take it.</sp>

<sd>Bib and the other monsters study the bounty hunter and wait for his 
reaction. Boushh releases a switch on the thermal detonator and it goes 
dead.</sd>

<sp><speaker>BOUSHH</speaker>
Zeebuss.</sp>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
He agrees!</sp>

<sd>The raucous crowd of monsters erupts in a symphony of cheers and 
applause as the party returns to its full noisy pitch. Chewbacca 
growls. As he is led away we spot LANDO CALRISSIAN, disguised as a 
skiff guard in a partial face mask. The band starts up and dancing 
girls take the center of the floor, to the hoots of the loudly 
appreciative creatures.</sd>

<sd>Boushh leans against a column with gunfighter cool and surveys the 
scene, his gaze stopping only when it connects with a glare from across 
the room. Boba Fett is watching him. Boushh shifts slightly, cradling 
his weapon lovingly. Boba Fett shifts with equally ominous arrogance.</sd>

<setting>12   INT DUNGEON CORRIDOR AND CELL</setting>

<sd>Gamorrean guards lead Chewie down the same hallway we saw before. When 
a tentacle reaches out at the <name type="NORP">Wookiee</name>, Chewie's ferocious ROAR echoes 
against the walls and the tentacle snaps back into its cell in terror. 
It takes all the guards to hurl Chewie roughly into a cell, slamming 
the door behind him. Chewie lets out a pathetic howl and bangs on the 
iron door.</sd>

<setting>13   EXT JABBA'S PALACE</setting>

<sd>The palace is sitting in the light of the double sunset. On the road in 
front, a large toadlike creature flicks its tongue out for a desert 
rodent and burps in satisfaction.</sd>

<setting>14   INT JABBA'S THRONE ROOM - NIGHT</setting>

<sd>Silence. The room is deserted, only the awful debris of the alien 
celebration giving mute witness to the activity here before. Several 
drunk creatures lie unconscious around the room, snoring loudly.</sd>

<sd>A shadowy figure moves stealthily among the columns at the perimeter of 
the room and is revealed to be Boushh, the bounty hunter. He picks his 
way carefully through the snoring, drunken monsters.</sd>

<sd><name type="NORP">Han</name> Solo, the frozen space pirate, hangs spotlighted on the wall, his 
coffin-like case suspended by a force field. The bounty hunter 
deactivates the force field by flipping a control switch to one side of 
the coffin. The heavy case slowly lowers to the floor of the alcove.</sd>

<sd>Boushh steps up to the case, studying <name type="NORP">Han</name>, and then turns to the 
controls on the side of the coffin. He activates a series of switches 
and, after one last hesitant look at <name type="NORP">Han</name>, slides the de-carbonization 
lever. The case begins to emit a sound as the hard shell covering the 
contours of <name type="NORP">Han</name>'s face begins to melt away. The bounty hunter watches 
as <name type="NORP">Han</name>'s body is freed of its metallic coat and his forearms and hands, 
previously raised in reflexive protest, drop slackly to his side. His 
face muscles relax from their mask of horror. He appears quite dead.</sd>

<sd>Boushh's ugly helmet leans close to <name type="NORP">Han</name>'s face listening for the breath 
of life. Nothing. He waits. <name type="NORP">Han</name>'s eyes pop open with a start and he 
begins coughing. The bounty hunter steadies the staggering newborn.</sd>

<sp><speaker>BOUSHH</speaker>
Just relax for a moment. You're free of the carbonite.</sp>

<sd><name type="NORP">Han</name> touches his face with his hand and moans.</sd>

<sp><speaker>BOUSHH</speaker>
Shhh. You have hibernation sickness.</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
I can't see.</sp>

<sp><speaker>BOUSHH</speaker>
Your eyesight will return in time.</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
Where am I?</sp>

<sp><speaker>BOUSHH</speaker>
Jabba's palace.</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
Who are you?</sp>

<sd>The bounty hunter reaches up and lifts the helmet from his head, 
revealing the beautiful face of PRINCESS LEIA.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LEIA</speaker>
Someone who loves you.</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
Leia!</sp>

<sp><speaker>LEIA</speaker>
I gotta get you out of here.</sp>

<sd>As Leia helps her weakened lover to stand up, the relative quiet is 
pierced by an obscene HUTTESE CACKLE from the other side of the alcove.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
What's that? I know that laugh.</sp>

<sd>The curtain on the far side of the alcove opens, revealing Jabba the 
<name type="ORG">Hut</name>t, surrounded by Bib and other aliens. He laughs again, and his 
gross cronies join in a cacophony of alien glee.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
Hey, Jabba. Look, Jabba, I was just on my way to pay you back, but I 
got a little sidetracked. It's not my fault.</sp>

<sd>Jabba laughs.</sd>

<sp><speaker>JABBA	 (in <name type="ORG">Hut</name>tese subtitled)</speaker>
It's too late for that, Solo. You may have been a good smuggler, but 
now you're Bantha fodder.</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
Look...</sp>

<sp><speaker>JABBA	 (cont <name type="ORG">Hut</name>tese subtitled)</speaker>
Take him away!</sp>

<sd>The guards grab <name type="NORP">Han</name> and start to lead him away.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
Jabba... I'll pay you triple! You're throwing away a fortune here. 
Don't be a fool!</sp>

<sd><name type="NORP">Han</name> is dragged off, as <name type="GPE">Lando</name> quickly moves forward and attempts to lead 
Leia away.</sd>

<sp><speaker>JABBA	 (in <name type="ORG">Hut</name>tese subtitled)</speaker>
Bring her to me.</sp>

<sd>Jabba chuckles as <name type="GPE">Lando</name> and a second guard drag the beautiful young 
princess toward him. <name type="ORG">Threepio</name> peeks from behind a monster and quickly 
turns away in disgust.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LEIA</speaker>
We have powerful friends. You're gonna regret this...</sp>

<sd>Inexorably her lovely face moves to within a few inches of Jabba's ugly

Ugh!</sp>

Ohhh, I can't bear to watch.</sp>

<setting>15   INT DUNGEON CELL</setting>

<sd>The heavy metal door of the dungeon whines and slowly creaks open. A 
guard throws the blinded star captain into the dark cell and the door 
slams shut behind him, leaving only a thin sliver of light from a crack 
in the door. <name type="NORP">Han</name> is trying to collect himself when suddenly a growl is 
heard from the far side of the cell. He jumps back against the cell 
door and listens.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
Chewie? Chewie, is that you?</sp>

<sd>The shadowy figure lets out a crazy yell and races toward <name type="NORP">Han</name>, lifting 
him off the ground with a big hug that carries them into the light, 
revealing Chewie.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
Ah! Chew--Chewie!</sp>

<sd>The giant <name type="NORP">Wookiee</name> barks with glee.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
Wait. I can't see, pal. What's goin' on?</sp>

<sd>Chewie barks an excited blue streak.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
Luke? Luke's crazy. He can't even take care of himself, much less 
rescue anybody.</sp>

<sd>Chewie barks a reply.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
A...<name type="ORG">Jedi</name> Knight? I--I'm out of it for a little while, everybody gets 
delusions of grandeur.</sp>

<sd>Chewie growls insistently. He holds <name type="NORP">Han</name> to his chest and pets his head.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
I'm all right, pal. I'm all right.</sp>

<setting>16   INT MAIN GATE AND HALL - JABBA'S PALACE</setting>

<sd>Noisily, the main gate lifts to flood the blackness with blinding LIGHT 
and reveal the silhouetted figure of LUKE SKYWALKER. He is clad in a 
robe similar to Ben's and wears neither pistol nor laser sword. Luke 
strides purposefully into the hallway. Two giant guards move to block 
Luke's path. Luke halts.</sd>

<sd>Luke raises his hand and points at the puzzled guards, who immediately 
lower their spears and fall back. The young <name type="ORG">Jedi</name> lowers his hand and 
moves on down the hallway.</sd>

<sd>Bib Fortuna appears out of the gloom. He speaks to Luke as they 
approach each other, but Luke doesn't stop and Bib must reverse his 
direction and hurry alongside the young <name type="ORG">Jedi</name> in order to carry on the 
conversation. Several other guards fall in behind them in the darkness.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
I must speak with Jabba.</sp>

<sd>Bib answers in <name type="ORG">Hut</name>tese, shaking his head in denial. Luke stops and 
stares at Bib; he raises his hand slightly.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
You will take me to Jabba now!</sp>

<sd>Bib turns in hypnotic response to Luke's command, and Luke follows him 
into the gloom.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
You serve your master well.</sp>

<sd>Bib responds.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
And you will be rewarded.</sp>

<setting>17   INT JABBA'S THRONE ROOM</setting>

<sd>Jabba is asleep on his throne, with Leia lying in front of him. 
Salacious sits by Jabba's tail, watching it wriggle. Leia is now 
dressed in the skimpy costume of a dancing girl; a chain runs from a 
manacle/necklace at her throat to her new master, Jabba the <name type="ORG">Hut</name>t. 
<name type="ORG">Threepio</name> stands behind Jabba as Bib comes up to the gangster slug.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
At last! Master Luke's come to rescue me.</sp>

<sp><speaker>BIB</speaker>
Master.</sp>

<sd>Jabba awakens with a start and Bib continues, in <name type="ORG">Hut</name>tese.</sd>

<sp><speaker>BIB</speaker>
...Luke Skywalker, <name type="ORG">Jedi</name> Knight.</sp>

<sp><speaker>JABBA	 (in <name type="ORG">Hut</name>tese subtitled)</speaker>
I told you not to admit him.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
I must be allowed to speak.</sp>

<sp><speaker>BIB	 (in <name type="ORG">Hut</name>tese subtitled)</speaker>
He must be allowed to speak.</sp>

<sd>Jabba, furious, clobbers Bib and shoves him away.</sd>

<sp><speaker>JABBA	 (in <name type="ORG">Hut</name>tese subtitled)</speaker>
You weak-minded fool! He's using an old <name type="ORG">Jedi</name> mind trick.</sp>

<sd>Luke stares hard at Jabba.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
You will bring Captain Solo and the <name type="NORP">Wookiee</name> to me.</sp>

<sp><speaker>JABBA	 (in <name type="ORG">Hut</name>tese subtitled)</speaker>
Your mind powers will not work on me, boy.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
Nevertheless, I'm taking Captain Solo and his friends. You can either 
profit by this... or be destroyed! It's your choice. But I warn you not 
to underestimate my powers.</sp>

<sd>Jabba's laugh is mean and loud. <name type="ORG">Threepio</name> attempts to warn Luke about 
the pit.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
Master Luke, you're standing on...</sp>

<sp><speaker>JABBA	 (in <name type="ORG">Hut</name>tese subtitled)</speaker>
There will be no bargain, young <name type="ORG">Jedi</name>. I shall enjoy watching you die.</sp>

<sd>Luke reaches out, and a pistol jumps out of a guard's holster and flies 
into Luke's hand. The bewildered guard grabs for it as Jabba raises his 
hand.</sd>

<sp><speaker>JABBA</speaker>
Bascka!</sp>

<sd>The floor suddenly drops away, sending Luke and the hapless guard into 
the pit. The pistol goes off, blasting a hole in the ceiling. Jabba 
laughs and his courtiers join in. Leia starts forward but is restrained 
by a human guard-- <name type="GPE">Lando</name>, recognizable behind his mask. She looks at 
him and he shakes his head "no."</sd>

<setting>18   INT RANCOR PIT</setting>

<sd>Luke and the guard have dropped twenty-five feet from a chute into the 
dungeonlike cage. Luke gets to his feet as the guard yells hysterically 
for help. A crowd gathers up around the edge of the pit as the door in 
the side of the pit starts to RUMBLE open. The guard screams in panic. 
Luke looks calmly around for a means of escape.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
Oh, no! The Rancor!</sp>

<sd>At the side of the pit, an iron door rumbles upward and a giant, fanged 
RANCOR emerges. The guard runs to the side of the pit and tries 
futilely to scramble to the top. The hideous beast closes in on him.</sd>

<sd>The Rancor moves past Luke, and as the guard continues to scramble, the 
Rancor picks him up and pops him into its slavering jaws. A few 
screams, and the guard is swallowed with a gulp. The audience cheers 
and laughs at the guard's fate.</sd>

<sd>The monster turns and starts for Luke. The young <name type="ORG">Jedi</name> dashes away just 
ahead of the monster's swipe at him, and picks up the long arm bone of 
an earlier victim. The monster grabs Luke and brings him up to his 
salivating mouth. At the last moment, Luke wedges the bone in the 
monster's mouth and is dropped to the floor. The monster bellows in 
rage and flails about, hitting the side of the pit, causing an 
avalanche.</sd>

<sd>The monster crushes the bone in its jaws and sees Luke, who squeezes 
into a crevice in the pit wall. Luke looks past the monster to the 
holding cave beyond. On the far side of the holding cave is a utility 
door--if only he can get to it. The Rancor spots Luke and reaches into 
the crevice for him. Luke grabs a large rock and raises it, smashing it 
down on the Rancor's finger.</sd>

19   HOLDING TUNNEL - RANCOR PIT

<sd>The Rancor lets out a loud howl as Luke makes a run for the holding 
cave. He reaches the door and pushes a button to open it. When he 
succeeds, he sees a heavy barred gate between him and safety. Beyond 
the gate two guards look up from their dinner. Luke turns to see the 
monster heading for him, and pulls with all his might on the gate. The 
guards move to the gate and start poking at the young <name type="ORG">Jedi</name> with spears, 
laughing.</sd>

<sd>Luke crouches (against the wall) as the monster starts to reach for 
him. Suddenly he notices a main door control panel halfway up the wall. 
As the Rancor moves in for the kill, Luke picks up a skull from the 
cave floor and hurls it at the panel. The giant overhead door comes 
crashing down on the beast's head, squashing it like a sledgehammer on 
an egg.</sd>

<sd>A startled gasp is heard from the stunned court. There's consternation 
at this turn of events. Heads look to Jabba, who is actually turning 
red with anger. Leia cannot suppress her joy. Jabba utters harsh 
commands to his guards and they hurry off.</sd>

<sp><speaker>JABBA	 (in <name type="ORG">Hut</name>tese subtitled)</speaker>
Bring me Solo and the <name type="NORP">Wookiee</name>. They will all suffer for this outrage.</sp>

<setting>21   INT RANCOR PIT</setting>

<sd>The Rancor KEEPERS have come into the cage and are examining their dead 
beast. One of them breaks down and weeps. The other glares menacingly 
at Luke, who is unworried. Several guards rush into the holding tunnel 
and take Luke away.</sd>

<setting>22   INT THRONE ROOM</setting>

<sd>The crowd of creepy courtiers parts as <name type="NORP">Han</name> and Chewie are brought into 
the throne room, and other guards drag Luke up the steps.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
Fine. Together again, huh?</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
Wouldn't miss it.</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
How are we doing?</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
The same as always.</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
That bad, huh? Where's Leia?</sp>

<sd>Luke looks to Leia.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LEIA</speaker>
I'm here.</sp>

<sd><name type="ORG">Threepio</name> is standing behind the grotesque gangster as he strokes Leia 
like a pet cat. Several of the guards, including <name type="GPE">Lando</name>, bring Luke from 
the other side of the room. Boba is standing behind Jabba.</sd>

<sd><name type="ORG">Threepio</name> steps forward and translates for the captives.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
Oh, dear. His High Exaltedness, the great Jabba the <name type="ORG">Hut</name>t, has decreed 
that you are to be terminated immediately.</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
Good, I hate long waits.</sp>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
You will therefore be taken to <name type="LOC">the Dune Sea</name> and cast into the pit of 
<name type="LOC">Carkoon</name>, the nesting place of the all-powerful Sarlacc.</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN	 (to Luke)</speaker>
Doesn't sound so bad.</sp>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
In his belly, you will find a new definition of pain and suffering, as 
you are slowly digested over a thousand years.</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
On second thought, let's pass on that, huh?</sp>

<sd>Chewie barks his agreement.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
You should have bargained, Jabba. That's the last mistake you'll ever 
make.</sp>

<sd>Jabba cackles evilly at this.</sd>

<sd>As the guards drag the prisoners from the throne room, a loud cheer 
rises from the crowd. Leia and Chewie exchange concerned looks, but 
Luke Skywalker, <name type="ORG">Jedi</name> warrior, cannot suppress a smile.</sd>

<setting>23   EXT TATOOINE SEA - SKIFF</setting>

<sd>Jabba's huge SAIL BARGE moves above the desert surface accompanied by 
two smaller Skiffs. One of the skiffs glides close, revealing Luke, 
<name type="NORP">Han</name>, and Chewie -- all in bonds -- surrounded by guards, one of whom is 
<name type="GPE">Lando</name> in disguise.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
I think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur, I see a 
big light blur.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
There's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know.</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
Just stick close to Chewie and <name type="GPE">Lando</name>. I've taken care of everything.</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
Oh... great!</sp>

<setting>24   INT BARGE OBSERVATION DECK</setting>

<sd>Jabba the <name type="ORG">Hut</name>t rides like a sultan in the massive antigravity ship. His 
entire retinue is with him, drinking, eating, and having a good time. 
Leia is watching her friends in the skiff when the chain attached to 
her neck is pulled tight and Jabba tugs the scantily clad princess to 
him.</sd>

<sp><speaker>JABBA	 (in <name type="ORG">Hut</name>tese subtitled)</speaker>
Soon you will learn to appreciate me.</sp>

<sd><name type="ORG">Threepio</name> wanders among the Sail Barge aliens, bumping into a smaller 
droid serving drinks, spilling them all over the place. The stubby 
droid lets out an angry series of beeps and whistles.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
Oh, I'm terribly sor... <name type="GPE">Artoo</name>! What are you doing here?</sp>

<sd><name type="GPE">Artoo</name> beeps a quick reply.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
Well, I can see you're serving drinks, but this place is dangerous. 
They're going to execute Master Luke and, if we're not careful, us too!</sp>

<sd><name type="GPE">Artoo</name> whistles a singsong response.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
Hmm.  I wish I had your confidence.</sp>

<setting>25   EXT SARLACC PIT </setting>

<sd>The convoy moves up over a huge sand pit. The Sail Barge stops to one 
side of the depression, as does the escort skiff. But the prisoner's 
skiff moves out directly over the center and hovers. At the bottom of 
the deep cone of sand is a repulsive, mucous-lined hole, surrounded by 
thousands of needle-sharp teeth. This is the SARLACC. A plank is 
extended from the edge of the prisoner's skiff. Guards release Luke's 
bonds and shove him out onto the plank above the Sarlacc's mouth.</sd>

<setting>26   EXT SAIL BARGE OBSERVATION DECK</setting>

<sd>Jabba and Leia are now by the rail, watching. <name type="ORG">Threepio</name> leans forward 
and the slobbering villain mumbles something to him. As <name type="ORG">Threepio</name> steps 
up to a comlink, Jabba raises his arm and the motley array of 
intergalactic pirates fall silent. <name type="ORG">Threepio</name>'s voice is amplified across 
loudspeakers.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
Victims of the almighty Sarlacc: His Excellency hopes that you will die 
honorably. But should any of you wish to beg for mercy, the great Jabba 
the <name type="ORG">Hut</name>t will now listen to your pleas.</sp>

no such pleasure from us. Right?</sp>

<sd>Chewie growls his agreement.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
Jabba! This is your last chance. Free us or die.</sp>

<sd><name type="GPE">Lando</name> moves unobtrusively along the skiff as Luke shoots a quick look 
of conspiracy to him.</sd>

<setting>28   INT SAIL BARGE OBSERVATION DECK</setting>

<sd>The assembled monsters rock with mocking laughter as <name type="GPE">Artoo</name> zips 
unnoticed up the ramp to the upper deck. Jabba's laughter subsides as 
he speaks into the comlink.</sd>

<sp><speaker>JABBA	 (in <name type="ORG">Hut</name>tese subtitled)</speaker>
Move him into position.</sp>

<sd>Jabba makes a thumbs-down gesture. Leia looks worried.</sd>

<setting>29   EXT BARGE - UPPER DECK</setting>

<sd><name type="GPE">Artoo</name> appears from below and zips over to the rail facing the pit. 
Below, in the skiff, Luke is prodded by a guard to the edge of the 
plank over the gaping Sarlacc. Luke looks up at <name type="GPE">Artoo</name>, then gives a 
jaunty salute: the signal the little droid has been waiting for. A flap 
opens in <name type="GPE">Artoo</name>'s domed head.</sd>

<sp><speaker>JABBA	 (in <name type="ORG">Hut</name>tese subtitled)</speaker>
Put him in.</sp>

<setting>30   EXT SKIFF - PLANK</setting>

<sd>Luke is prodded and jumps off the plank to the cheers of the 
bloodthirsty spectators. But, before anyone can even perceive what is 
happening, he spins around and grabs the end of the plank by his 
fingertips. The plank bends wildly from his weight and catapults him 
skyward. In midair he does a complete flip and drops down on the end of 
the plank in the same spot he just vacated, but facing the skiff. He 
casually extends an open palm and -- his lightsaber, which <name type="GPE">Artoo</name> has 
sent arcing toward him, drops into his hand.</sd>

<sd>With samurai speed, Luke ignites it and attacks the guard who prodded 
him off the plank, sending the hapless monster screaming overboard. The 
other guards swarm toward Luke. He wades into them, lightsaber 
flashing. <name type="GPE">Lando</name> struggles with another guard at the back of the skiff.</sd>

<setting>31   EXT SARLACC PIT</setting>

<sd>A bewildered guard lands in the soft, sandy slope of the pit, and 
begins sliding. He claws desperately as a Sarlacc tentacle grabs him 
and pulls him screaming into the viscous mouth.</sd>

<setting>32   INT SAIL BARGE</setting>

<sd>Jabba watches this and explodes in rage. He barks commands, and the 
guards around him rush off to do his bidding. The scuzzy creatures 
watching the action from the window are in an uproar.</sd>

<setting>33   EXT SKIFF </setting>

<sd>Luke knocks another guard off the skiff and into the waiting mouth of 
the Sarlacc. He starts to untie Chewie's bonds.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
Easy, Chewie.</sp>

<sd>At that moment, the deck gunmen on the barge unleash a series of blasts 
from a big cannon on the upper deck. <name type="GPE">Lando</name> is tossed from the deck of 
the rocking skiff. He manages to grab a rope, and dangles desperately 
above the Sarlacc pit.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LANDO</speaker>
Whoa! Whoa! Help!</sp>

<setting>34   EXT UPPER DECK - SAIL BARGE</setting>

<sd>With two swift strides, the dangerous Boba Fett ignites his rocket 
pack, leaps into the air, and flies from the barge down to the skiff.</sd>

<setting>35   EXT SKIFF</setting>

<sd>Boba lands on the skiff and starts to aim his laser gun at Luke, who 
has freed <name type="NORP">Han</name> and Chewie from their bonds. But before Boba can fire, 
the young <name type="ORG">Jedi</name> spins on him, lightsaber sweeping, and hacks the bounty 
hunter's gun in half.</sd>

<sd>Immediately, the skiff takes another direct hit from the barge's deck 
gun. Shards of skiff deck fly. Chewie and <name type="NORP">Han</name> are thrown against the 
rail.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
Chewie, you okay? Where is he?</sp>

<sd>The <name type="NORP">Wookiee</name> is wounded and he howls in pain.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
I'm okay, pal.</sp>

<sd>For a moment, Luke is distracted, and in that moment, Boba fires a 
cable out of his armored sleeve. Instantly, Luke is wrapped in a strong 
cable, his arms pinned against his side, his sword arm free only from 
the wrist down.  Luke bends his wrist so the lightsaber points straight 
up to reach the wire lasso and cuts through. Luke shrugs away the cable 
and stands free.</sd>

<sd>Another blast from the Barge's deck gun hits near Boba and he is 
knocked unconscious to the deck, next to where <name type="GPE">Lando</name> is hanging.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LANDO</speaker>
<name type="NORP">Han</name>! Chewie?</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
<name type="GPE">Lando</name>!</sp>

<sd>Luke is a little shaken but remains standing as a fusillade brackets 
him. The second skiff, loaded with guards firing their weapons, moves 
in on Luke fast. Luke leaps toward the incoming second skiff. The young 
<name type="ORG">Jedi</name> leaps into the middle of the second skiff and begins decimating 
the guards from their midst.</sd>

<sd>Chewie, wounded, tries to lift himself as he barks directions to <name type="NORP">Han</name>, 
guiding him toward a spear which has been dropped by one of the guards. 
<name type="NORP">Han</name> searches the deck as Chewie barks directions; finally he grabs hold 
of the spear.</sd>

<sd>Boba Fett, badly shaken, rises from the deck. He looks over at the 
other skiff, where Luke is whipping a mass of guards. Boba raises his 
arm, and aims his lethal appendage.</sd>

<sd>Chewie barks desperately at <name type="NORP">Han</name>.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
Boba Fett?! Boba Fett?! Where?</sp>

<sd>The space pirate turns around blindly, and the long spear in his hand 
whacks squarely in the middle of Boba's rocket pack.</sd>

<sd>The impact of the swing causes the rocket pack to ignite. Boba blasts 
off, flying over the second skiff like a missile, smashing against the 
side of the huge Sail Barge and sliding away into the pit. He screams 
as his armored body makes its last flight past <name type="GPE">Lando</name> and directly into 
the mucous mouth of the Sarlacc. The Sarlacc burps. Chewie growls a 
weak congratulations to <name type="NORP">Han</name>.</sd>

<setting>36   INT SAIL BARGE</setting>

<sd>Leia turns from the spectacle outside, leaps onto Jabba's throne, and 
throws the chain that enslaves her over his head around his bulbous 
neck. Then she dives off the other side of the throne, pulling the 
chain violently in her grasp. Jabba's flaccid neck contracts beneath 
the tightening chain. His huge eyes bulge from their sockets and his 
scum-coated tongue flops out. The Exalted <name type="ORG">Hut</name>t's huge tail spasms 
through its death throes and then slams down into final stillness. Leia 
struggles to free herself of her bondage.</sd>

<setting>37   EXT SKIFF</setting>

<sd>Luke continues to destroy the aliens on the guards' skiff, as <name type="NORP">Han</name> 
extends his spear downward to <name type="GPE">Lando</name>, who is still dangling precariously 
from a rope on the prisoner's skiff.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
<name type="GPE">Lando</name>, grab it!</sp>

<sp><speaker>LANDO</speaker>
Lower it!</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
I'm trying!</sp>

<sd>A major hit from the barge deck gun knocks the skiff on its side. <name type="NORP">Han</name> 
and almost everything else on board slides overboard. The rope breaks, 
and <name type="GPE">Lando</name> falls to the side of the Sarlacc pit. Luckily, <name type="NORP">Han</name>'s foot 
catches on the skiff railing and he dangles above <name type="GPE">Lando</name> and the pit. 
The wounded <name type="NORP">Wookiee</name> holds onto the skiff for dear life as another hit 
from the deck gun rocks the skiff violently.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
Whoa! Whoa! Grab me, Chewie! I'm slipping.</sp>

<sd>Chewie grabs hold of <name type="NORP">Han</name>'s feet, holding him upside down, as <name type="NORP">Han</name> 
extends the spear toward <name type="GPE">Lando</name>, who is clutching to the side of the 
pit.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
Grab it! L--<name type="GPE">Lando</name>. Grab!</sp>

<sd>Luke finishes off the last guard on the second skiff. He sees the deck 
gun blasting away at his helpless companions. Luke leaps from the 
skiff, across a chasm of air, to the sheer metallic side of the Sail 
Barge. Barely able to get a fingerhold, he begins a painful climb up 
the hull, when suddenly an ax smashes through a window an inch from his 
head. With <name type="ORG">Jedi</name> agility, Luke grasps the wrist holding the ax and yanks 
the helpless guard through the broken window and into the deadly pit.</sd>

<sd>The injured Chewie is reaching over the rail for the dangling <name type="NORP">Han</name>, who 
is in turn blindly reaching down toward the desperate <name type="GPE">Lando</name>. The Baron 
has stopped his slippage down the sandy slope of the Sarlacc pit by 
lying very still. Every time he tries to reach for <name type="NORP">Han</name>, the loose sand 
moves him closer to his final reward.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
Grab it! Almost... You almost got it!</sp>

<sd>Another blast hits the front of the tilted skiff, causing <name type="GPE">Lando</name> to let 
go of the spear.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LANDO</speaker>
Hold it! Whoa!</sp>

<sd>Again <name type="NORP">Han</name> extends the spear toward <name type="GPE">Lando</name>.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
Gently now. All... all right. Now easy, easy. Hold me, Chewie.</sp>

<sd><name type="GPE">Lando</name> screams. One of the Sarlacc's tentacles has wrapped tightly 
around his ankle, dragging him down the side of the pit.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, <name type="GPE">Lando</name>.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LANDO</speaker>
No, wait! I thought you were blind!</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
It's all right. Trust me. Don't move.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LANDO</speaker>
All right! A little higher! Just a little higher!</sp>

<sd><name type="NORP">Han</name> adjusts his aim as <name type="GPE">Lando</name> lowers his head, and the fuzzy-eyed pirate 
fires at the tentacle. Direct hit. The tentacle releases <name type="GPE">Lando</name>, and 
Chewie starts to pull them on board the skiff.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
Chewie, Pull us up! Come on! Okay... up, Chewie, up!</sp>

<setting>38   EXT UPPER DECK</setting>

<sd>The deck gunners have Chewie and the desperate dangling human chain in 
their gun sights when something up on deck commands their attention: 
Luke, standing before them like a pirate king, ignites his lightsaber. 
The deck gunners have barely reached for their pistols before the young

<sd>Leia is struggling against her chains in desperation as <name type="GPE">Artoo</name> zips 
through the tumult of confused monsters to the rescue; the stubby 
little droid extends a small laser gun and blasts the chain apart.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LEIA</speaker>
Come on. We gotta get out of here quick.</sp>

<sd><name type="GPE">Artoo</name> and Leia race for the exit, passing <name type="ORG">Threepio</name>, who is kicking and 
screaming as Salacious Crumb, the reptilian monkey- monster picks out 
one of the golden droid's eyes.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
Not my eyes! <name type="GPE">Artoo</name>, help! Quickly, <name type="GPE">Artoo</name>. Oh! Ohhh! You beast!</sp>

<sd><name type="GPE">Artoo</name> zips over and zaps Salacious, sending him skyward with a scream, 
crashing into the rafters as <name type="GPE">Artoo</name>, Leia, and <name type="ORG">Threepio</name> (with his eye 
dangling from a wire) hurry off.</sd>

<setting>40   EXT UPPER DECK - SAIL BARGE</setting>

<sd>Luke is warding off laser blasts with his lightsaber, surrounded by 
guards and fighting like a demon. Leia emerges onto the deck as Luke 
turns to face another guard.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE	 (to Leia)</speaker>
Get the gun! Point it at the deck!</sp>

<sd>Leia turns toward the barge cannon, climbs on the platform, and swivels 
the gun around.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
Point it at the deck!</sp>

<sd>A laser blast hits Luke's mechanical hand and he bends over in pain, 
but manages to swing his lightsaber upward and take out the last of the 
guards. He looks at the wounded hand, which reveals the mechanism. He 
flexes the hand; it still works.</sd>

<sd>Near the rail of the upper deck, <name type="GPE">Artoo</name> and <name type="ORG">Threepio</name> steady themselves 
as <name type="ORG">Threepio</name> gets ready to jump. <name type="GPE">Artoo</name> beeps wildly.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
<name type="GPE">Artoo</name>, where are we going? I couldn't possibly jump.</sp>

<sd><name type="GPE">Artoo</name> butts the golden droid over the edge and steps off himself, 
tumbling toward the sand.</sd>

<sd>Luke runs along the empty deck toward Leia and the barge gun, which she 
has brought around to point down at the deck.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
Come on!</sp>

<sd>Luke has hold on one of the rigging ropes from the mast. He gathers 
Leia in his other arm and kicks the trigger of the deck gun. The gun 
explodes into the deck as Luke and Leia swing out toward the skiff.</sd>

<setting>41   EXT SKIFF  </setting>

<sd><name type="NORP">Han</name> leans panting against the rail as Chewie helps <name type="GPE">Lando</name> onto the deck. 
Luke and Leia land on the skiff with flair.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
Let's go! And don't forget the droids.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LANDO</speaker>
We're on our way.</sp>

<sd>The Sail Barge is exploding in stages in the distance. Half of the huge 
craft is on fire.</sd>

<setting>42   EXT SAND DUNE</setting>

<sd><name type="ORG">Threepio</name>'s legs stick straight up from the dune where he landed. Next 
to it, <name type="GPE">Artoo</name>'s periscope is the only thing above the sand. The skiff 
floats above them and two large electromagnets dangle down on a wire. 
With a loud CLANG, both droids are pulled 
from the sand.</sd>

<setting>43   EXT DUNE SEA</setting>

<sd>The little skiff skips around the burning Sail Barge, which continues 
its chain of explosions. As the skiff sails off across the desert, the 
barge settles to the sand and disappears in one final conflagration.</sd>

<setting>44   EXT DUNE SEA - LANDING AREA</setting>

<sd>A ferocious sandstorm blocks our view. Then, through the ROAR, we HEAR 
THE VOICES of our heroes. They emerge slowly from the veil of sand, 
pressing on against the wind. First come <name type="GPE">Artoo</name> and <name type="ORG">Threepio</name>, followed 
by Leia guiding <name type="NORP">Han</name>, then Luke and <name type="GPE">Lando</name> come into view, each 
supporting one side of the towering Chewbacca, who hobbles from his 
wound.</sd>

<sd>Soon, they can make out some large vague shapes in the blowing sand. It 
is the Millennium <name type="ORG">Falcon</name> and, parked beside it, Luke's trusty X-wing 
and a two-seated Y-wing. They must shout to be heard.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
I don't know. All I can see is a lot of blowing sand!</sp>

<sp><speaker>LEIA</speaker>
That's all any of us can see.</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN	 (blinking)</speaker>
Then I guess I'm getting better.</sp>

<sd>As soon as the group huddles under the bulk of the <name type="ORG">Falcon</name>, the wind 
dies down to something more describable as a severe weather condition. 
<name type="ORG">Threepio</name> hits a switch, and the gang-plank lowers with a HUM.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN 	(turning to Luke)</speaker>
I've got to hand it to you, kid, you were pretty good out there.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE	 (shrugging it off)</speaker>
I had a lot of help. Think nothing of it.</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
No, I'm thinking a lot about it. That carbon freeze was the closest 
thing to dead there is. And it wasn't just sleepin'. It was a big wide 
awake nothing!</sp>

<sd>Luke nods, as Chewie growls affectionately at the young <name type="ORG">Jedi</name> warrior, 
mussing his hair like a proud uncle. And Leia warmly hugs him.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE 	(moving to his ship)</speaker>
I'll see you back at the fleet.</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
Why don't you leave that crate and come with us?</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
I have a promise I have to keep first... to an old friend.</sp>

<sd>Luke and <name type="GPE">Artoo</name> take off in their spacecraft.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN		</speaker>
(looking dubiously at <name type="GPE">Lando</name>, obviously remembering his friend's 
betrayal and subsequent aide)
Guess I owe you some thanks, too, <name type="GPE">Lando</name>.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LANDO</speaker>
Figured if I left you frozen like that you'd just give me bad luck the 
rest of my life, so I might as well get you unfrozen sooner or later.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LEIA</speaker>
He means "You're welcome."</sp>

<sp><speaker>LANDO</speaker>
Come on, let's get off this miserable dust ball.</sp>

44A  EXT SPACE ABOVE TATOOINE 

<sd>The desolate yellow planet fills the screen, Luke's X-wing appears and 
peels off to the left. A moment later, the FALCON appears as a dot and 
grows huge, to roar directly over the CAMERA.</sd>

<setting>45   INT X-WING - COCKPIT</setting>

<sd>Luke is at the controls, with <name type="GPE">Artoo</name> attached behind him outside the 
canopy. Luke speaks into his comlink to the others, in the MILLENNIUM 
FALCON.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
I'll meet you back at the fleet.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LEIA	 (over comlink)</speaker>
Hurry. The <name type="ORG">Alliance</name> should be assembled by now.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
I will.</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN	 (over comlink)</speaker>
Hey, Luke, thanks. Thanks for comin' after me. Now I owe you one.</sp>

<sd>A message from <name type="GPE">Artoo</name> appears on the small monitor screen in front of 
Luke. He smiles at the monitor and speaks to <name type="GPE">Artoo</name>, as he pulls a black 
glove on to cover his wounded mechanical hand.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
That's right, <name type="GPE">Artoo</name>. We're going to the <name type="FAC">Dagobah</name> system. I have a 
promise to keep... to an old friend.</sp>

<setting>46   EXT SPACE - DEATH STAR AND ENDOR</setting>

<sd>A Super <name type="ORG">Star Destroyer</name> and several ships of the <name type="ORG">Imperial</name> Fleet rest in 
space above the half-completed Death Star and its green neighbor, 
Endor. Four squads of <name type="ORG">TIE</name> fighters escort an <name type="ORG">Imperial</name> shuttle toward 
<name type="ORG">the Death Star</name>.</sd>

<setting>47   INT DEATH STAR - CORRIDOR TO DOCKING BAY</setting>

<sd>Lord Vader strides down the hallway, accompanied by a very nervous 
Death Star commander.</sd>

<setting>48   INT DOCKING BAY - DEATH STAR</setting>

<sd>Thousands of <name type="ORG">Imperial</name> troops in tight formation fill the mammoth 
docking bay. Vader and the officer walk to the landing platform, where 
the shuttle is coming to rest.</sd>

<sd>The shuttle's ramp lowers and the Emperor's Royal Guards come out and 
create a lethal perimeter. The assembled troops move to rigid attention 
with a momentous SNAP.</sd>

<sd>Then, in the huge SILENCE which follows, the EMPEROR appears. He is a 
rather small, shriveled old man. His bent frame slowly makes its way 
down the ramp with the aid of a gnarled cane. He wears a hooded cloak 
similar to the one Ben wears, except that it is black. The Emperor's 
face is shrouded and difficult to see, except for his piercing yellow 
eyes. Commander Jerjerrod and Darth Vader kneel to him. The <name type="ORG">Supreme</name> 
Ruler of the galaxy beckons to the Dark Lord.</sd>

<sp><speaker>EMPEROR	 (to Vader)</speaker>
Rise, my friend.</sp>

<sd>Vader rises and falls in next to the Emperor as he slowly makes his way 
along the rows of troops. Jerjerrod and the other commanders stay 
kneeling until the <name type="ORG">Supreme</name> Ruler and Vader, followed by several 
<name type="ORG">Imperial</name> dignitaries, pass by; only then do they join in the 
procession.</sd>

<sp><speaker>VADER</speaker>
The Death Star will be completed on schedule.</sp>

<sp><speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
You have done well, Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue 
your search for young Skywalker.</sp>

<sp><speaker>VADER</speaker>
Yes, my Master.</sp>

<sp><speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
Patience, my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does, 
you must bring him
before me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the 
dark side of the
<name type="ORG">Force</name>.</sp>

<sp><speaker>VADER</speaker>
As you wish.</sp>

<sp><speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen.</sp>

<sd>He laughs to himself as they pass along the vast line of <name type="ORG">Imperial</name> 
troops.</sd>

<setting>49   EXT YODA'S HOUSE - DAGOBAH</setting>

<sd>Once again, <name type="GPE">Artoo</name> finds himself waiting around in the damp environs of 
the swamp planet, and he's none too happy about it. He beeps 
disconsolately to himself and turns to look at Yoda's cottage. Warm 
yellow light escapes the oddly shaped windows to fight the gloom.</sd>

<setting>50   INT YODA'S HOUSE</setting>

<sd>The tip of a walking stick taps hesitantly across the earthen floor of 
the cottage. Our view travels up the stick to the small green hand that 
clutches it, and then to the familiar face of YODA, THE JEDI MASTER. 
His manner is frail, and his voice, though cheerful, seems weaker.</sd>

<sp><speaker>YODA</speaker>
Hmm. That face you make. Look I so old to young eyes?</sp>

<sd>Luke is sitting in a corner of the cramped space and, indeed, his look 
has been woeful. Caught, he tries to hide it.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
No... of course not.</sp>

<sp><speaker>YODA	 (tickled, chuckles)</speaker>
I do, yes, I do!  Sick have I become. Old and weak. 
(Points a crooked finger)
When nine hundred years old you reach, look as good you will not. Hmm?</sp>

<sd>Yoda chuckles at this, coughs, and hobbles over toward his bed.</sd>

<sp><speaker>YODA</speaker>
Soon will I rest. Yes, forever sleep. Earned it, I have.</sp>

<sd>Yoda sits himself on his bed, with great effort.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
Master Yoda, you can't die.</sp>

<sp><speaker>YODA</speaker>
Strong am I with the <name type="ORG">Force</name>... but not that strong! Twilight is upon me 
and soon night must fall. That is the way of things... the way of the 
<name type="ORG">Force</name>.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
But I need your help. I've come back to complete the training.</sp>

<sp><speaker>YODA</speaker>
No more training do you require. Already know you that which you need.</sp>

<sd>Yoda sighs, and lies back on his bed.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
Then I am a <name type="ORG">Jedi</name>?</sp>

<sp><speaker>YODA	 (shakes his head)</speaker>
Ohhh. Not yet. One thing remains: Vader. You must confront Vader. Then, 
only then, a <name type="ORG">Jedi</name> will you be. And confront him you will.</sp>

<sd>Luke is in agony. He is silent for a long moment, screwing up his 
courage. Finally he is able to ask.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
Master Yoda... is Darth Vader my father?</sp>

<sd>Yoda's eyes are full of weariness and compassion. An odd, sad smile 
creases his face. He turns painfully on his side, away from Luke.</sd>

<sp><speaker>YODA</speaker>
Mmm... rest I need. Yes... rest.</sp>

<sd>Luke watches him, each moment an eternity.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
Yoda, I must know.</sp>

<sp><speaker>YODA</speaker>
Your father he is.</sp>

<sd>Luke reacts as if cut.</sd>

<sp><speaker>YODA</speaker>
Told you, did he?</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
Yes.</sp>

<sd>A new look of concern crosses Yoda's face.  He closes his eyes.</sd>

<sp><speaker>YODA</speaker>
Unexpected this is, and unfortunate...</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
Unfortunate that I know the truth?</sp>

<sd>Yoda opens his eyes again and studies the youth.</sd>

<sp><speaker>YODA		 (gathering all his strength)</speaker>
No. Unfortunate that you rushed to face him... that incomplete was your 
training. Not
ready for the burden were you.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
Well, I'm sorry.</sp>

<sp><speaker>YODA</speaker>
Remember, a <name type="ORG">Jedi</name>'s strength flows from the <name type="ORG">Force</name>.  But beware.  Anger, 
fear, aggression.
The dark side are they.  Once you start down the dark path, forever 
will it dominate your
destiny.</sp>

<sd>He beckons the young <name type="ORG">Jedi</name> closer to him.</sd>

<sp><speaker>YODA</speaker>
Luke...Luke...Do not...Do not underestimate the powers of the Emperor, 
or suffer your father's fate, you will. Luke, when gone am I
(cough),
the last of the <name type="ORG">Jedi</name> will you be. Luke, the <name type="ORG">Force</name> runs strong in your 
family. Pass on what you have learned, Luke... 
(with great effort)
There is...another...Sky...Sky...walker.</sp>

<sd>He catches his breath. A shiver runs through the ancient green 
creature, and he dies. Luke stares at his dead master as he disappears 
in front of his eyes.</sd>

<setting>51   EXT DAGOBAH SWAMP - X-WING </setting>

<sd>Luke wanders back to where his ship is sitting. <name type="GPE">Artoo</name> beeps a greeting, 
but is ignored by his depressed master. Luke kneels down, begins to 
help <name type="GPE">Artoo</name> with the ship, then stops and shakes his head dejectedly.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
I can't do it, <name type="GPE">Artoo</name>. I can't go on alone.</sp>

<sp><speaker>BEN	 (OS)</speaker>
Yoda will always be with you.</sp>

<sd>Luke looks up to see the shimmering image of BEN KENOBI.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
Obi-Wan! Why didn't you tell me?</sp>

<sd>The ghost of Ben <name type="ORG">Kenobi</name> approaches him through the swamp.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father.</sp>

<sp><speaker>BEN</speaker>
You father was seduced by the dark side of the <name type="ORG">Force</name>. He ceased to be 
<name type="GPE">Anakin</name> Skywalker
and became Darth Vader. When that happened, the good man who was your 
father was destroyed. So what I have told you was true... from a 
certain point of view.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE	 (turning away, derisive)</speaker>
A certain point of view!</sp>

<sp><speaker>BEN</speaker>
Luke, you're going to find that many of the truths we cling to depend 
greatly on our own
point of view.</sp>

<sd>Luke is unresponsive. Ben studies him in silence for a moment.</sd>

<sp><speaker>BEN</speaker>
I don't blame you for being angry. If I was wrong in what I did, it 
certainly wouldn't have been for the first time. You see, what happened 
to your father was my fault.</sp>

<sd>Ben pauses sadly.</sd>

<sp><speaker>BEN</speaker>
<name type="GPE">Anakin</name> was a good friend.</sp>

<sd>Luke turns with interest at this. As Ben speaks, Luke settles on a 
stump, mesmerized. <name type="GPE">Artoo</name> comes over to offer his comforting presence.</sd>

<sp><speaker>BEN</speaker>
When I first knew him, your father was already a great pilot. But I was 
amazed how strongly the <name type="ORG">Force</name> was with him. I took it upon myself to 
train him as a <name type="ORG">Jedi</name>. I thought that I could instruct him just as well 
as Yoda. I was wrong. My pride has had terrible consequences for the 
galaxy.</sp>

<sd>Luke is entranced.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
There's still good in him.</sp>

<sp><speaker>BEN</speaker>
I also thought he could be turned back to the good side. It couldn't be 
done. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
I can't do it, Ben.</sp>

<sp><speaker>BEN</speaker>
You cannot escape your destiny.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
I tried to stop him once. I couldn't do it.</sp>

<sp><speaker>BEN</speaker>
Vader humbled you when first you met him, Luke... but that experience 
was part of your training. It taught you, among other things, the value 
of patience. Had you not been so impatient to defeat Vader then, you 
could have finished your training here with Yoda. You would have been 
prepared.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
But I had to help my friends.</sp>

<sp><speaker>BEN	 (grinning at Luke's indignation)</speaker>
And did you help them? It was they who had to save you. You achieved 
little by rushing back prematurely, I fear.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE	 (with sadness)</speaker>
I found out Darth Vader was my father.</sp>

<sp><speaker>BEN</speaker>
To be a <name type="ORG">Jedi</name>, Luke, you must confront and then go beyond the dark side 
- the side your father couldn't get past. Impatience is the easiest 
door - for you, like your father. Only, your father was seduced by what 
he found on the other side of the door, and you have held firm. You're 
no longer so reckless now, Luke. You are strong and patient. And now, 
you must face Darth Vader again!</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
I can't kill my own father.</sp>

<sp><speaker>BEN</speaker>
Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
Yoda spoke of another.</sp>

<sp><speaker>BEN</speaker>
The other he spoke of is your twin sister.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
But I have no sister.</sp>

<sp><speaker>BEN</speaker>
Hmm. To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your 
father when you were born. The Emperor knew, as I did, if <name type="GPE">Anakin</name> were 
to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the 
reason why your sister remains safely anonymous.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
Leia! Leia's my sister.</sp>

<sp><speaker>BEN</speaker>
Your insight serves you well. Bury your feelings deep down, Luke. They 
do you credit.
But they could be made to serve the Emperor.</sp>

<sd>Luke looks into the distance, trying to comprehend all this.</sd>

<sp><speaker>BEN	 (continuing his narrative)</speaker>
When your father left, he didn't know your mother was pregnant. Your 
mother and I knew he would find out eventually, but we wanted to keep 
you both as safe as possible, for as long as possible.  So I took you 
to live with my brother Owen on Tatooine... and your mother took Leia 
to live as the daughter of Senator Organa, on <name type="ORG">Alderaan</name>.</sp>

<sd>Luke turns, and settles near Ben to hear the tale.</sd>

<sp><speaker>BEN	 (attempting to give solace with his words)</speaker>
The Organa household was high-born and politically quite powerful in 
that system. Leia became a princess by virtue of lineage... no one knew 
she'd been adopted, of course. But it was a title without real power, 
since <name type="ORG">Alderaan</name> had long been a democracy.  Even so, the family 
continued to be politically powerful, and Leia, following in her foster 
father's path, became a senator as well.  That's not all she became, of 
course... she became the leader of her cell in the <name type="ORG">Alliance</name> against the 
corrupt <name type="GPE">Empire</name>. And because she had diplomatic immunity, she was a 
vital link for getting information to the Rebel cause.  That's what she 
was doing when her path crossed yours... for her foster parents had 
always told her to contact me on Tatooine, if her troubles became 
desperate.</sp>

<sd>Luke is overwhelmed by the truth, and is suddenly protective of his 
sister.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
But you can't let her get involved now, Ben. Vader will destroy her.</sp>

<sp><speaker>BEN</speaker>
She hasn't been trained in the ways of the <name type="ORG">Jedi</name> the way you have, 
Luke... but the <name type="ORG">Force</name> is strong with her, as it is with all of your 
family. There is no avoiding the battle. You must face and destroy 
Vader!</sp>

<setting>52   EXT SPACE - REBEL FLEET</setting>

<sd>The vast Rebel Fleet stretches as far as the eye can see. Overhead a 
dozen small Corellian battleships fly in formation. Fighters and 
battlecruisers surround the largest of the Rebel Star Cruisers, the 
HEADQUARTERS FRIGATE.</sd>

<setting>53   INT HEADQUARTERS FRIGATE - MAIN BRIEFING ROOM</setting>

<sd>Hundreds of Rebel commanders of all races and forms are assembled in 
the WAR ROOM. WEDGE is among them. In the center of the room is a 
holographic model depicting the half-completed <name type="ORG">Imperial</name> Death Star, the 
nearby Moon of Endor, and the protecting deflector shield.</sd>

<sp><speaker>MON MOTHMA, the leader of the <name type="ORG">Alliance</name>, enters the room. She is a stern </speaker>
but beautiful woman in her fifties. Conferring with her are several 
military leaders, including GENERAL MADINE and ADMIRAL ACKBAR (a 
salmon-colored Mon Calamari). <name type="GPE">Lando</name> moves through the crowd until he 
finds <name type="NORP">Han</name> and Chewie, standing next to Leia and the two droids.</sp>

<sd><name type="NORP">Han</name> peers at <name type="GPE">Lando</name>'s new insignia on his chest, and is amused.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
Well, look at you, a general, huh?</sp>

 LANDO
 Oh, well, someone must have told them about my little maneuver at the 
battle of Taanab.

<sp><speaker>HAN	 (sarcastic)</speaker>
Well, don't look at me, pal. I just said you were a fair pilot. I 
didn't know they were
lookin' for somebody to lead this crazy attack.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LANDO	 (smiling)</speaker>
I'm surprised they didn't ask you to do it.</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
Well, who says they didn't.  But I ain't crazy. You're the respectable 
one, remember?</sp>

<sd>Mon Mothma signals for attention, and the room falls silent.</sd>

<sp><speaker>MON MOTHMA</speaker>
The Emperor has made a critical error and the time for our attack has 
come.</sp>

<sd>This causes a stir. Mon Mothma turns to a holographic model of the 
Death Star, <name type="LOC">the Endor moon</name> and the protecting deflector shield in the 
center of the room.</sd>

<sp><speaker>MON MOTHMA</speaker>
The data brought to us by the <name type="NORP">Bothan</name> spies pinpoints the exact location 
of the Emperor's new battle station. We also know that the weapon 
systems of this Death Star are not yet operational. With the <name type="ORG">Imperial</name> 
Fleet spread throughout the galaxy in a vain effort to engage us, it is 
relatively unprotected. But most important of all, we've learned that 
the Emperor himself is personally overseeing the final stages of the 
construction of this Death Star.</sp>

<sd>A volley of spirited chatter erupts from the crowd. <name type="NORP">Han</name> turns to Leia 
as Chewie barks his amazement.</sd>

<sp><speaker>MON MOTHMA	 (cont)</speaker>
Many <name type="NORP">Bothan</name>s died to bring us this information. Admiral Ackbar, please.</sp>

<sd>Admiral Ackbar steps forward and points to <name type="ORG">the Death Star</name>'s force field 
and the Moon of Endor.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ACKBAR</speaker>
You can see here <name type="ORG">the Death Star</name> orbiting the forest Moon of Endor. 
Although the weapon
systems on this Death Star are not yet operational, <name type="ORG">the Death Star</name> does 
have a strong defense mechanism. It is protected by an energy shield, 
which is generated from the nearby forest Moon of Endor. The shield 
must be deactivated if any attack is to be attempted. Once the shield 
is down, our cruisers will create a perimeter, while the fighters fly 
into the superstructure and attempt to knock out the main reactor.</sp>

<sd>There's a concerned murmur.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ACKBAR	 (cont)</speaker>
General Calrissian has volunteered to lead the fighter attack</sp>

<sd><name type="NORP">Han</name> turns to <name type="GPE">Lando</name> with a look of respect.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
Good luck.</sp>

<sd><name type="GPE">Lando</name> nods his thanks.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
You're gonna need it.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ACKBAR</speaker>
General Madine.</sp>

<sd>Madine moves center stage.</sd>

<sp><speaker>GENERAL MADINE</speaker>
We have stolen a small <name type="ORG">Imperial</name> shuttle. Disguised as a cargo ship, and 
using a secret
<name type="ORG">Imperial</name> code, a strike team will land on <name type="LOC">the moon</name> and deactivate the

<sd>The assembly begins to mumble among themselves.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>

<sd>On an adjacent hill, the helmeted Rebel contingent makes its way up a

<sd><name type="NORP">Han</name> sneaks up behind one of the scouts, steps on a twig and the scout 
whirls, knocking <name type="NORP">Han</name> into a tree. The scout shouts for his companion.</sd>

<sp><speaker>SCOUT #1</speaker>
Go for help! Go!</sp>

<sd>The second scout jumps on his speeder bike and takes off, but Chewie 
gets off a shot on his crossbow laser weapon, causing the scout to 
crash into a tree. <name type="NORP">Han</name> and Scout #1 are in a rousing fistfight.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE	 (sarcastic)</speaker>
Great. Come on.</sp>

<sd>Luke starts for the scuffle, followed by Leia with her laser pistol 
drawn. As they run through the bushes, Leia stops and points to where 
two more scouts are sitting on their speeder bikes, with an unoccupied 
bike parked nearby.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LEIA</speaker>
Over there! Two more of them!</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
I see them. Wait, Leia!</sp>

<sd>But Leia doesn't hear him and races for the remaining speeder bike. She 
starts it up and takes off as Luke jumps on the bike behind her.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE	 (pointing to the controls)</speaker>
Quick! Jam their comlink. Center switch!</sp>

<sd>Luke and Leia speed into the dense foliage in hot pursuit, barely 
avoiding two huge trees.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
Hey, wait! Ahhh!</sp>

<sd>He flips the remaining scout to the ground.</sd>

<setting>65   EXT FOREST - THE BIKE CHASE</setting>

<sd>The two fleeing <name type="ORG">Imperial</name> scouts have a good lead as Luke and Leia 
pursue through the giant trees at 200 miles an hour, the fire from 
their bike's laser cannon hitting harmlessly near the moving targets.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
Move closer!</sp>

<sd>Leia guns it, closing the gap, as the two scouts recklessly veer 
through a narrow gap in the trees. One of the bikes SCRAPES a tree, 
slowing the scout.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
Get alongside that one!</sp>

<sd>Leia pulls her speeder bike up so close to the scout's bike that their 
steering vanes SCRAPE noisily. Luke leaps from his bike to the back of 
the scout's, grabs the <name type="ORG">Imperial</name> warrior around the neck, and flips him 
off the bike, into a thick tree trunk. Luke gains control of the bike 
and follows Leia, who has pulled ahead. They tear off after the 
remaining scout.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
Get him!</sp>

<sd>The speeding chase passes TWO MORE IMPERIAL SCOUTS. These two swing 
into pursuit, chasing Luke and Leia, firing away with their laser 
cannon. The two <name type="ORG">Rebels</name> look behind them just as Luke's bike takes a 
glancing hit.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE	 (indicating the one ahead)</speaker>
Keep on that one! I'll take these two!</sp>

<sd>With Leia shooting ahead, Luke suddenly slams his steering vanes into 
the braking mode. Luke's bike is a blur to the two pursuing scouts as 
they zip by him on either side. Luke slams his bike into forward and 
starts firing away, having switched places with his pursuers in a 
manner of seconds. Luke's aim is good and one scout's bike is blasted 
out of control. It explodes against a tree trunk.</sd>

<sd>The scout's cohort takes one glance back at the flash and shifts into 
turbo drive, going even faster. Luke keeps on his tail.</sd>

<sp><speaker>FAR AHEAD, Leia and the first scout are doing a highspeed slalom </speaker>
through the death-dealing trunks. Now Leia aims her bike skyward and 
rises out of sight.</sp>

<sd>The scout turns in confusion, unable to see his pursuer. Suddenly, Leia 
dives down upon him from above, cannon blasting. The scout's bike takes 
a glancing hit.</sd>

<sd>Leia moves in alongside him. The scout eyes her beside him, reaches 
down, and pulls out a handgun. Before Leia can react, the scout has 
blasted her bike, sending it out of control. Leia dives off as her bike 
explodes against a tree. The happy scout looks back at the explosion. 
But when he turns forward again, he is on a collision course with a 
giant fallen tree. He hits his brakes to no avail and disappears in a 
conflagration.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST: Luke and the last remaining scout continue </speaker>
their weaving chase through the trees. Now Luke moves up close. The 
scout responds by slamming his bike into Luke's. A fallen tree forms a 
bridge across their path. The scout zips under. Luke goes over the top 
and crashes his bike down on the scout's. Both riders look ahead - a 
wide trunk looms directly in Luke's path, but the scout's bike beside 
him makes it almost impossible for him to avoid it. Luke banks with all 
his might, leaning almost horizontal over the scout's bike, and is able 
to make it by, just clipping the tree. When he straightens, he and the 
scout discover that their two bikes have locked front vanes and are 
moving as one.</sp>

<sd>Another big tree looms in Luke's path. He reacts instinctively and 
dives off his bike. The two bikes come apart a second before Luke's 
explodes against a tree. The scout sweeps out and circles back to find 
Luke.</sd>

<sd>Luke rises from the undergrowth as the scout bears down on him and 
opens fire with his laser cannon. Luke ignites his laser sword and 
begins deflecting the bolts. The scout's bike keeps coming and it 
appears that in a second it will cut Luke in half. At the last instant, 
Luke steps aside and chops off the bike's control vanes with one mighty 
slash. The scout's bike begins to shudder, then, pitching and rolling, 
it rises up to slam directly into a tree in a giant ball of fire.</sd>

<setting>66   EXT SCOUT CAMPSITE - FOREST</setting>

<sd><name type="NORP">Han</name>, Chewie, and the droids, along with the rest of the squad, wait

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
Oh, General Solo, somebody's coming. Oh!</sp>

<sd><name type="NORP">Han</name>, Chewie, and the rest of the squad raise their weapons.</sd>

<sd>Luke steps out of the foliage to find the weapons trained on him. He's 
too tired to care. He plops himself down on a boulder and looks around.</sd>

<setting>67   EXT FOREST CLEARING - LEIA'S CRASH SITE</setting>

<sd>A strange little furry face with huge black eyes comes slowly into 
view. The creature is an EWOK, by the name of WICKET. He seems somewhat 
puzzled, and prods Leia with a spear. The princess groans; this 
frightens the stubby ball of fuzz and he prods her again. Leia sits up 
and stares at the three-foot-high Ewok. She tries to figure out where 
she is and what has happened. Her clothes are torn; she's bruised and 
disheveled.</sd>

<sd>The Ewok jumps up and grabs a four-foot-long spear, which he holds in a 
defensive position. Leia watches him as he circles warily and begins 
poking her with the sharp point of the spear.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LEIA</speaker>
Cut it out!</sp>

<sd>She stands up, and the Ewok quickly backs away.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LEIA</speaker>
I'm not gonna hurt you.</sp>

<sd>Leia looks around at the dense forest, and at the charred remains of 
her speeder bike, then sits down, with a sigh, on a fallen log.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LEIA</speaker>
Well, looks like I'm stuck here. Trouble is, I don't know where here 
is.</sp>

<sd>She puts her head in her hands to rub away some of the soreness from 
her fall. She looks over at the watchful little Ewok and pats the log 
beside her.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LEIA</speaker>
Well, maybe you can help me. Come on, sit down.</sp>

<sd>Wicket holds his spear up warily and growls at her like a puppy. Leia 
pats the log again.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LEIA</speaker>
I promise I won't hurt you. Now come here.</sp>

<sd>More growls and squeaks from the little bear creature.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LEIA</speaker>
All right. You want something to eat?</sp>

<sd>She takes a scrap of food out of her pocket and offers it to him. 
Wicket takes a step backward, then cocks his head and moves cautiously 
toward Leia, chattering in his squeaky Ewok language.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LEIA</speaker>
That's right. Come on. Hmmm?</sp>

<sd>Sniffing the food curiously, the Ewok comes toward Leia and sits on the 
log beside her. She takes off her helmet, and the little creature jumps 
back, startled again. He runs along the log, pointing his spear at her 
and chattering a blue streak. Leia holds out the helmet to him.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LEIA</speaker>
Look, it's a hat. It's not gonna hurt you. Look. You're a jittery 
little thing, aren't you?</sp>

<sd>Reassured, Wicket lowers his spear and climbs back on the log, coming 
to investigate the helmet. Suddenly his ears perk up and he begins to 
sniff the air. He looks around warily, whispering some Ewokese warning 
to Leia.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LEIA</speaker>
What is it?</sp>

<sd>Suddenly a laser bolt comes out of the foliage and explodes on the log 
next to Leia. Leia and Wicket both roll backwards off the log, hiding 
behind it. Leia holds her own laser gun ready, while Wicket disappears 
underneath the log. Another shot, and still no sight of anyone in the 
forest. Then Leia senses something and turns to find a large IMPERIAL 
SCOUT standing over her with his weapon pointed at her head. He reaches 
out his hand for her weapon.</sd>

<sp><speaker>SCOUT #l</speaker>
Freeze!  Come on, get up!</sp>

<sd>She hands the weapon over, as a second scout emerges from the foliage 
in front of the log.</sd>

<sp><speaker>SCOUT #1</speaker>
Go get your ride and take her back to base.</sp>

<sp><speaker>SCOUT #2</speaker>
Yes, sir.</sp>

<sd>The second scout starts toward his bike, as Wicket, crouched under the 
log, extends his spear and hits the first scout on the leg. The scout 
jumps and lets out an exclamation, and looks down at Wicket, puzzled. 
Leia grabs a branch and knocks him out. She dives for his laser pistol, 
and the second scout, now on his bike, takes off. Leia fires away and 
hits the escaping bike, causing it to crash into the first scout's 
bike, which flies end over end and explodes. The forest is quiet once 
more. Wicket pokes his fuzzy head up from behind the log and regards 
Leia with�new respect. He mumbles his awe. Leia hurries over, looking 
around all the time, and motions the chubby little creature into the 
dense foliage.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LEIA</speaker>
Come on, let's get outta here.</sp>

<sd>As they move into the foliage, Wicket takes the lead. He shrieks and 
tugs at Leia to follow him.</sd>

<sd><name type="NORP">Han</name>, Luke, Chewie, and the two droids are spread out as they move 
through the heavy foliage near the clearing where we last saw Leia. 
Luke finds Leia's helmet, picks it up with an expression of concern.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN	 (OS)</speaker>
Luke! Luke!</sp>

<sd>Luke runs with the helmet to where <name type="NORP">Han</name> has found the charred wreckage 
of a speeder bike in the grass.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
Oh, Master Luke.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
There's two more wrecked speeders back there. And I found this.</sp>

<sd>He tosses the helmet to <name type="NORP">Han</name>.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
I'm afraid that <name type="GPE">Artoo</name>'s sensors can find no trace of Princess Leia.</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN	 (gravely)</speaker>
I hope she's alright.</sp>

<sd>Chewbacca growls, sniffing the air, then, with a bark, pushes off 
through the foliage.</sd>

                              HAN
What, Chewie? What? Chewie!

<sd>The others rush to keep up with the giant <name type="NORP">Wookiee</name>. As he scoots along, 
<name type="GPE">Artoo</name> whistles nervously.</sd>

<setting>71   EXT FOREST - DENSE FOLIAGE</setting>

<sd>The group has reached a break in the undergrowth. Chewie walks up to a 
tall stake planted in the ground. There is a dead animal hanging from 
it.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
Hey, I don't get it.</sp>

<sd>The rest of the group joins the <name type="NORP">Wookiee</name> around the stake.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN	 (cont)</speaker>
Nah, it's just a dead animal, Chewie.</sp>

<sd>Chewie can't resist. He reaches toward the meat.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
Chewie, wa-wait!  Don't!</sp>

<sd>Too late. The <name type="NORP">Wookiee</name> has already pulled the animal from the stake. 
SPROOING! The group finds itself hanging upside down in an Ewok net, 
suspended high above the clearing. <name type="GPE">Artoo</name> lets out a wild series of 
beeps and whistles, and Chewie howls his regret. Their bodies are a 
jumble in the net. <name type="NORP">Han</name> removes a <name type="NORP">Wookiee</name> paw from his mouth.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
Nice work. Great, Chewie! Great! Always thinking with your stomach.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
Will you take it easy? Let's just figure out a way to get out of this 
thing. 
(trying to free an arm) 
<name type="NORP">Han</name>, can you reach my lightsaber?</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
Yeah, sure.</sp>

<sd><name type="GPE">Artoo</name> is at the bottommost point in the net. He extends his cutting 
appendage and begins slicing at the net. <name type="NORP">Han</name> is trying to squeeze an 
arm past <name type="ORG">Threepio</name> to get at Luke's lightsaber. The net continues to 
spin.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
<name type="GPE">Artoo</name>, I'm not sure that's such a good idea. It's a very long dro-o-
op!!</sp>

<sd><name type="GPE">Artoo</name> has cut through and the entire group tumbles out of the net, 
crashing to the ground. As they regain their senses and sit up, they 
realize they are surrounded by dozens of Ewoks, each brandishing a long 
spear.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
Wha--?  Hey!  Point that thing someplace else.</sp>

<sd><name type="NORP">Han</name> pushes the spear wielded by TEEBO out of his face and a second Ewok 
warrior comes up to argue with Teebo. The spear returns to <name type="NORP">Han</name>'s face. 
He grabs it angrily and starts to go for his laser pistol.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
Hey!</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
<name type="NORP">Han</name>, don't. It'll be all right.</sp>

<sd>The Ewoks swarm through them and confiscate their weapons. Luke lets 
them take his lightsaber. Chewie growls at the furry critters.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
Chewie, give 'em your crossbow.</sp>

<sd><name type="GPE">Artoo</name> and <name type="ORG">Threepio</name> are just untangling themselves. <name type="ORG">Threepio</name> gets free 
of the net and sits up, rattled.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
Oh, my head. Oh, my goodness!</sp>

<sd>When the Ewoks see <name type="ORG">Threepio</name>, they let out a gasp and chatter among 
themselves. <name type="ORG">Threepio</name> speaks to them in their native tongue. The Ewok 
nearest him drops his spear and prostrates himself before the droid. In 
a moment, all the Ewoks have followed suit. Chewie lets out a puzzled 
bark. <name type="NORP">Han</name> and Luke regard the bowed creatures in wonder. The Ewoks 
begin to chant at <name type="ORG">Threepio</name>.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
Do you understand anything they're saying?</sp>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
Oh, yes, Master Luke!  Remember that I am fluent in over six million 
forms of
communication.</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
What are you telling them?</sp>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
Hello, I think... I could be mistaken. They're using a very primitive 
dialect.  But
I do believe they think I am some sort of god.</sp>

<sd>Chewbacca and <name type="GPE">Artoo</name> think that's very funny. <name type="NORP">Han</name> and Luke exchange 
"what next?" looks.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
Well, why don't you use your divine influence and get us out of this?</sp>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
I beg your pardon, General Solo, but that just wouldn't be proper.</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
Proper?!</sp>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
It's against my programming to impersonate a deity.</sp>

<sd><name type="NORP">Han</name> moves toward <name type="ORG">Threepio</name> threateningly.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
Why, you--</sp>

<sd>Several Ewoks' spears are thrust in <name type="NORP">Han</name>'s face at the affront to their 
god. The Ewoks move in to protect their god and <name type="NORP">Han</name> is surrounded by a 
menacing circle of spears, all aimed at him. He holds up his hands 
placatingly.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
My mistake. He's an old friend of mine.</sp>

<setting>72   EXT FOREST - SERIES OF SHOTS</setting>

<sd>A procession of Ewoks winds through the ever-darkening forest. Their 
prisoners - <name type="NORP">Han</name>, Luke, Chewie, and <name type="GPE">Artoo</name> - are tied to long poles and 
wrapped in vines, cocoonlike.</sd>

<sd>Each pole is carried on the shoulders of several Ewoks. Behind the 
captives, <name type="ORG">Threepio</name> is carried on a litter, like a king, by the 
remaining creatures.</sd>

<setting>73   EXT FOREST WALKWAY - MOON FOREST</setting>

<sd>The procession moves along a shaky, narrow, wooden walkway, high in the 
giant trees. It stops at the end of the walkway, which drops off into 
nothingness. On the other side of the abyss is a village of mud huts 
and rickety walkways, attached to the giant trees. The lead Ewok takes 
hold of a long vine and swings across to the village square; the other 
Ewoks follow suit.</sd>

<setting>74   EXT EWOK VILLAGE SQUARE</setting>

<sd>The procession winds its way into the village square. Mother Ewoks 
gather their babies up and scurry into their huts at the sight of the 
newcomers. The group stops before the largest hut.</sd>

<sd><name type="NORP">Han</name>, Luke, Chewie, and <name type="GPE">Artoo</name> are still bound to their poles. <name type="NORP">Han</name> is 
placed on a spit above what looks like a barbecue pit and the others 
are leaned against a tree nearby. <name type="ORG">Threepio</name>'s litter/throne is gently 
placed near the pit. He watches with rapt fascination. <name type="NORP">Han</name>, Luke, and 
Chewie are less than fascinated.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
I have a really bad feeling about this.</sp>

<sd>Chewie growls his concern.</sd>

<sd>Suddenly all activity stops as LOGRAY, the tribal Medicine Man, comes 
out of the big hut. He examines the captives carefully, goes to join 
<name type="ORG">Threepio</name>, whose throne has been placed on an elevated platform. A 
larger, gray-haired Ewok, CHIEF CHIRPA, is examining Luke's lightsaber 
with great curiosity.</sd>

<sd>Logray speaks to <name type="ORG">Threepio</name> and the assemblage of fuzzy Ewoks, pointing 
to the prisoners tied to the stakes. The Ewoks begin filling the pit 
under <name type="NORP">Han</name> with firewood.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
What did he say?</sp>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it appears you are to be the 
main course at a
banquet in my honor.</sp>

<sd>The drums start beating, and all the furry heads turn to the large hut. 
Leia emerges, wearing an animal-skin dress. She sees what's happening 
at the same moment the prisoners see her.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN and LUKE</speaker>
Leia!</sp>

<sd>As she moves toward them, the Ewoks block her way with raised spears.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LEIA</speaker>
Oh!</sp>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
Your Royal Highness.</sp>

<sd><name type="GPE">Artoo</name> and Chewie chime in with their welcome. Leia looks at the 
assembled Ewoks and sighs.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LEIA</speaker>
But these are my friends. <name type="ORG">Threepio</name>, tell them they must be set free.</sp>

<sd><name type="ORG">Threepio</name> talks to Chirpa and Logray, who listen and shake their heads 
negatively. The Medicine Man gestures toward the prisoners and barks 
some orders. Several Ewoks jump up and pile more wood on the barbecue 
with vigor. Leia trades frantic looks with Luke and <name type="NORP">Han</name> .</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
Somehow, I got the feeling that didn't help us very much.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
<name type="ORG">Threepio</name>, tell them if they don't do as you wish, you'll become angry 
and use your magic.</sp>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
But Master Luke, what magic? I couldn't possibly --</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
Just tell them.</sp>

<sd><name type="ORG">Threepio</name> speaks to the Ewoks. The Ewoks are disturbed. Logray steps 
forward and challenges <name type="ORG">Threepio</name>. Luke closes his eyes and begins to 
concentrate.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
You see, Master Luke; they didn't believe me. Just...</sp>

<sd>Now the litter/throne, with <name type="ORG">Threepio</name> sitting upon it, rises from the 
ground. At first <name type="ORG">Threepio</name> doesn't notice and keeps talking.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
... as I said they wouldn't. Wha-wha-what's happening! Oh! Oh, dear! 
Oh!</sp>

<sd>The Ewoks fall back in terror from the floating throne. Now <name type="ORG">Threepio</name> 
begins to spin as though he were on a revolving stool, with <name type="ORG">Threepio</name> 
calling out in total panic at his situation.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
Put me down! He-e-elp! Master Luke! <name type="GPE">Artoo</name>! Somebody, somebody, help! 
Master Luke, <name type="GPE">Artoo</name>! <name type="GPE">Artoo</name>, quickly! Do something, somebody! Oh! Ohhh!</sp>

<sd>Chief Chirpa yells orders to the cowering Ewoks. They rush up and 
release the bound prisoners. Luke and <name type="NORP">Han</name> enfold Leia in a group 
embrace. Luke notices the spinning <name type="ORG">Threepio</name>, with <name type="GPE">Artoo</name> beeping up at 
him, and slowly lowers the golden droid and the throne to the ground. 
Logray orders the little droid cut down. <name type="GPE">Artoo</name> crashes to the ground. 
When the Ewoks set him upright, the little droid is fighting mad. <name type="GPE">Artoo</name> 
beeps a blue streak at the nearest Ewok, and begins pursuing him, 
finally getting close enough to zap him with an electric charge. The 
Ewok jumps two feet in the air and runs away, screaming. A small group 
of Ewoks surround the giant <name type="NORP">Wookiee</name>, scratching their heads and 
marveling at his height.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
Oh, oh, oh, oh! Thank goodness.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
Thanks, <name type="ORG">Threepio</name>.</sp>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO	 (still shaken)</speaker>
I...I never knew I had it in me.</sp>

<setting>75   INT CHIEF'S HUT - COUNCIL OF ELDERS</setting>

<sd>A glowing fire dances in the center of the spartan, low-ceilinged room, 
creating a kaleidoscope of shadows on the walls. Along one side, a 
group of ten Ewok elders flank Chief Chirpa, who sits on his throne. 
The <name type="ORG">Rebels</name> sit along the walls of the hut, with <name type="ORG">Threepio</name> between the 
two groups and Wicket and Teebo off to one side.</sd>

<sd><name type="ORG">Threepio</name> is in the midst of a long, animated speech in the Ewok's 
squeaky native tongue. The Ewoks listen carefully and occasionally 
murmur comments to each other. <name type="ORG">Threepio</name> points several times at the 
Rebel group and pantomimes a short history of the Galactic Civil War, 
mimicking the explosion and rocket sounds, imitating <name type="ORG">Imperial</name> walkers. 
Throughout the long account, certain familiar names are distinguishable 
in English: Princess Leia, <name type="GPE">Artoo</name>, Darth Vader, Death Star, <name type="ORG">Jedi</name>, Obi-
Wan <name type="ORG">Kenobi</name>. <name type="GPE">Artoo</name> begins beeping excitedly at <name type="ORG">Threepio</name>.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
Yes, <name type="GPE">Artoo</name>. I was just coming to that.</sp>

<sd><name type="ORG">Threepio</name> continues with: Millennium <name type="ORG">Falcon</name>, Cloud City, Vader, <name type="NORP">Han</name> 
Solo, carbonite, Sarlacc, bringing the history up to the present time.</sd>

<sd>At the end of it, the Chief, Logray, and the elders confer, then nod in 
agreement. The Chief stands and makes a pronouncement.</sd>

<sd>The drums begin to sound, and all the Ewoks stand with a great cheer 
and screeches.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
What's going on?</sp>

<sp><speaker>LEIA</speaker>
I don't know.</sp>

<sd>Luke has been sharing the joy with smiling visage, but now something 
passes like a dark cloud through his consciousness. The others do not 
notice.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
Wonderful! We are now a part of the tribe.</sp>

<sd>Several of the little teddy bears run up and hug the <name type="ORG">Rebels</name>.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
Just what I always wanted.</sp>

<sd>Chewbacca is being enthusiastically embraced by an Ewok, while Wicket 
clings to <name type="NORP">Han</name>'s leg.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN	 (chuckles)</speaker>
Well, short help is better than no help at all, Chewie. 
(to Wicket) 
Thank you. Okay.</sp>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
He says the scouts are going to show us the quickest way to the shield 
generator.</sp>

<sd>Chewie barks. Luke has drifted to the back of the hut. Now he wanders 
outside into <name type="LOC">the moon</name>light. Leia notices and follows.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
Good. How far is it? Ask him. We need some fresh supplies, too. And try 
and get our weapons back.</sp>

<sd><name type="NORP">Han</name> pulls <name type="ORG">Threepio</name> back as he keeps trying to translate.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN	 (cont)</speaker>
And hurry up, will ya? I haven't got all day.</sp>

<setting>76   EXT EWOK VILLAGE - NIGHT</setting>

<sd>The walkway is deserted now. The windows of the little huts glow and 
flicker from the fires inside. The sounds of the forest fill the soft 
night air. Luke has wandered away from the Chief's hut and stands 
staring up at <name type="ORG">the Death Star</name>. Leia finds him like that.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LEIA</speaker>
Luke, what's wrong?</sp>

<sd>Luke turns and looks at her a long moment.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
Leia... do you remember your mother? Your real mother?</sp>

<sp><speaker>LEIA</speaker>
Just a little bit. She died when I was very young.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
What do you remember?</sp>

<sp><speaker>LEIA</speaker>
Just...images, really. Feelings.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
Tell me.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LEIA</speaker>
(a little surprised at his insistence)
She was very beautiful. Kind, but...sad.
(looks up)
Why are you asking me all this?</sp>

<sd>He looks away.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
I have no memory of my mother. I never knew her.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LEIA</speaker>
Luke, tell me. What's troubling you?</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
Vader is here...now, on this moon.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LEIA	 (alarmed)</speaker>
How do you know?</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
I felt his presence. He's come for me. He can feel when I'm near. 
That's why I have to go.
(facing her)
As long as I stay, I'm endangering the group and our mission here.
(beat)
I have to face him.</sp>

<sd>Leia is distraught, confused.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LEIA</speaker>
Why?</sp>

<sd>Luke moves close and his manner is gentle. And very calm.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
He's my father.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LEIA</speaker>
Your father?</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
There's more. It won't be easy for you to hear it, but you must. If I 
don't make it back, you're the only hope for the <name type="ORG">Alliance</name>.</sp>

<sd>Leia is very disturbed by this. She moves away, as if to deny it.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LEIA</speaker>
Luke, don't talk that way. You have a power I--I don't understand and 
could never have.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
You're wrong, Leia. You have that power too. In time you'll learn to 
use it as I have. The <name type="ORG">Force</name> is strong in my family. My father has 
it...I have it...and...my sister has it.</sp>

<sd>Leia stares into his eyes. What she sees there frightens her. But she 
doesn't draw away. She begins to understand.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
Yes. It's you Leia.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LEIA</speaker>
I know. Somehow...I've always known.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
Then you know why I have to face him.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LEIA</speaker>
No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave 
this place. I wish I could go with you.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
No, you don't. You've always been strong.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LEIA</speaker>
But, why must you confront him?</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
Because...there is good in him. I've felt it. He won't turn me over to 
the Emperor. I can save him. I can turn him back to the good side. I 
have to try.</sp>

<sd>They hold each other close and look at each other, brother and sister.</sd>

<sd>Leia holds back her tears as Luke slowly lets her go and moves away. He 
disappears onto the walkway that leads out of the village. Leia, bathed 
in moonlight, watches him go as <name type="NORP">Han</name> comes out of the Chief's hut and 
comes over to her. Leia is crying, her body trembling. He realizes only 
now that she is crying.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
Hey, what's goin' on?</sp>

<sd>Leia attempts to stifle her sobs and wipes her eyes.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LEIA</speaker>
Nothing. I - just want to be alone for a little while.</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN	 (angry)</speaker>
Nothing?  Come on, tell me.  What's goin' on?</sp>

<sd>She looks up at him, struggling to control herself.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LEIA</speaker>
I...I can't tell you.</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN	 (loses his temper)</speaker>
Did you tell Luke? Is that who you could tell?</sp>

<sp><speaker>LEIA</speaker>
I...</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
Ahhh...</sp>

<sd>He starts to walk away, exasperated, then stops and walks back to her.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
I'm sorry.</sp>

Hold me.</sp>

gracefully on the huge platform.</sd>

<sd>Now, an <name type="ORG">Imperial</name> walker approaches the platform from the darkness of

particularly offensive in the midst of this verdant beauty.</sd>

<setting>78   EXT IMPERIAL LANDING PLATFORM - LOWER DECK</setting>

<sd>Darth Vader walks down the ramp of the shuttle onto the platform, into 
an elevator, and appears on a ramp on a lower level. He walks toward 
another ramp exit and is met by two troopers and a commander with Luke, 
in binders, at their center. The young <name type="ORG">Jedi</name> gazes at Vader with 
complete calm.</sd>

<sp><speaker>COMMANDER</speaker>
This is a Rebel that surrendered to us. Although he denies it, I 
believe there may be more of them, and I request permission to conduct 
a further search of the area.</sp>

<sd>The commander extends his hand, revealing Luke's lightsaber.</sd>

<sp><speaker>COMMANDER</speaker>
He was armed only with this.</sp>

<sd>Vader looks at Luke, turns away and faces the commander, taking the 
lightsaber from the commander's hand.</sd>

<sp><speaker>VADER</speaker>
Good work, Commander. Leave us. Conduct your search and bring his 
companions to me.</sp>

<sp><speaker>COMMANDER</speaker>
Yes, my Lord.</sp>

<sd>The officer and troops withdraw. Vader and Luke are left standing alone 
in the oddly tranquil beauty of the place. The sounds of the forest 
filter in upon them.</sd>

<sp><speaker>VADER</speaker>
The Emperor has been expecting you.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
I know, father.</sp>

<sp><speaker>VADER</speaker>
So, you have accepted the truth.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LURE</speaker>
I've accepted the truth that you were once <name type="GPE">Anakin</name> Skywalker, my father.</sp>

<sp><speaker>VADER	 (turning to face him)</speaker>
That name no longer has any meaning for me.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
It is the name of your true self. You've only forgotten. I know there 
is good in you. The Emperor hasn't driven it from you fully. That is 
why you couldn't destroy me. That's why you won't bring me to your 
Emperor now.</sp>

<sd>Vader looks down from Luke to the lightsaber in his own black- gloved 
hand. He seems to ponder Luke's words.</sd>

<sp><speaker>VADER	 (indicating lightsaber)</speaker>
I see you have constructed a new lightsaber.</sp>

<sd>Vader ignites the lightsaber and holds it to examine its humming, 
brilliant blade.</sd>

<sp><speaker>VADER</speaker>
Your skills are complete. Indeed, you are powerful, as the Emperor has 
foreseen.</sp>

<sd>They stand for a moment, the Vader extinguishes the lightsaber.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
Come with me.</sp>

<sp><speaker>VADER</speaker>
Obi-Wan once thought as you do.</sp>

<sd>Luke steps close to Vader, then stops. Vader is still.</sd>

<sp><speaker>VADER</speaker>
You don't know the power of the dark side. I must obey my master.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
I will not turn...and you'll be forced to kill me.</sp>

<sp><speaker>VADER</speaker>
If that is your destiny.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
Search your feelings, father. You can't do this. I feel the conflict 
within you. Let go
of your hate.</sp>

<sp><speaker>VADER</speaker>
It is too late for me, son. The Emperor will show you the true nature 
of the <name type="ORG">Force</name>. He is
your master now.</sp>

<sd>Vader signals to some distant stormtroopers. He and Luke stand staring

<sd><name type="NORP">Han</name>, Leia, Chewie, the droids, and their two Ewok guides, Wicket and 
Paploo, have reunited with the Rebel strike squad. The entire group is 
spread through the thick undergrowth. Below them is the BUNKER that 
leads into the generator. Four <name type="ORG">Imperial</name> scouts, their speeder bikes 
parked nearby, keep watch over the bunker entrance. Chewie growls an 
observation, and Paploo chatters away to <name type="NORP">Han</name> in Ewok language.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
Back door, huh? Good idea.</sp>

<sd>Wicket and Paploo continue their Ewok conversation.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN	 (cont)</speaker>

<sd><name type="ORG">Threepio</name> explains what is going on to Wicket and Paploo. The Ewoks 
chatter a moment between themselves. Then Paploo jumps up and scampers 
into the underbrush.</sd>

<sd><name type="ORG">Threepio</name> asks Wicket where Paploo went and is given a short reply.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
Oh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia!</sp>

<sd>Paploo has slipped out of the undergrowth near where the <name type="ORG">Imperial</name>

one of the scout's speeder bikes and begins flipping switches at

Paploo grins and continues flipping switches. The scouts leap up in 
surprise.</sd>

<sd>The <name type="ORG">Imperial</name> scouts race toward Paploo just as his speeder zooms into

<sp><speaker>SCOUT</speaker>
Look! Over there! Stop him!</sp>

<sd>Three of the <name type="ORG">Imperial</name> scouts jump on their rocket bikes and speed away 
in pursuit. The fourth watches them go from his post at the door.</sd>

<setting>88   EXT FOREST</setting>

<sd>Paploo sails through the trees, more lucky than in control. It's scary, 
but he loves it. When the <name type="ORG">Imperial</name> scouts pull within sight behind him 
and begin firing laser bolts, he decides he's had enough. As he rounds 
a tree, out of their sight, Paploo grabs a vine and swings up into the

still-flying, unoccupied bike.</sd>

<setting>89   EXT BUNKER</setting>

<sd><name type="NORP">Han</name> sneaks up behind the remaining <name type="ORG">Imperial</name> scout, taps him on the 
shoulder and lets the scout chase him behind the bunker into the arms 
of the waiting Rebel strike team. <name type="NORP">Han</name> returns to the front, and taps 
out a pattern on the bunker door's control panel. Everyone stands out 
of sight, police-style, as the door opens. <name type="NORP">Han</name> and Leia peek inside. No 
sign of life. The group enters the bunker silently, leaving one lookout 
behind.</sd>

<setting>90   INT DEATH STAR - EMPEROR'S THRONE ROOM</setting>

<sd>The elevator opens. Vader and Luke enter the room alone. They walk 
across the dark space to stand before the throne, father and son side 
by side beneath the gaze of the Emperor. Vader bows to his Master.</sd>

<sp><speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
Welcome, young Skywalker. I have been expecting you.</sp>

<sd>Luke peers at the hooded figure defiantly. The Emperor then looks down 
at Luke's binders.</sd>

<sp><speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
You no longer need those.</sp>

<sd>The Emperor motions ever so slightly with his finger and Luke's binders 
fall away, clattering to the floor. Luke looks down at his own hands, 
free now to reach out and grab the Emperor's neck. He does nothing.</sd>

<sp><speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>

<sd>The red-cloaked guards turn and disappear behind the elevator.</sd>

<sp><speaker>EMPEROR	 (to Luke)</speaker>
I'm looking forward to completing your training. In time you will call 
me Master.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>

<sd>The Emperor gets down from his throne and walks up very close to Luke. 
The Emperor looks into his eyes and, for the first time, Luke can 
perceive the evil visage within the hood.</sd>

<sp><speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
Oh, no, my young <name type="ORG">Jedi</name>. You will find that it is you who are 
mistaken...about a great many things.</sp>

<sp><speaker>VADER</speaker>
His lightsaber.</sp>

<sd>Vader extends a gloved hand toward the Emperor, revealing Luke's 
lightsaber. The Emperor takes it.</sd>

<sp><speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
Ah, yes, a <name type="ORG">Jedi</name>'s weapon. Much like your father's. By now you must know 
your father can never be turned from the dark side. So will it be with 
you.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
You're wrong. Soon I'll be dead...and you with me.</sp>

<sd>The Emperor laughs.</sd>

<sp><speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
Perhaps you refer to the imminent attack of your Rebel fleet.</sp>

<sd>Luke looks up sharply.</sd>

<sp><speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
Yes...I assure you we are quite safe from your friends here.</sp>

<sd>Vader looks at Luke.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
Your overconfidence is your weakness.</sp>

<sp><speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
Your faith in your friends is yours.</sp>

<sp><speaker>VADER</speaker>
It is pointless to resist, my son.</sp>

<sd>The Emperor turns to face Luke.</sd>

<sp><speaker>EMPEROR	 (angry)</speaker>
Everything that has transpired has done so according to my design.

Your friends up there on <name type="LOC">the Sanctuary Moon</name>...</sp>

<sd>Luke reacts. The Emperor notes it.</sd>

<sp><speaker>EMPEROR	 (cont)</speaker>

allowed the <name type="ORG">Alliance</name> to know the location of the shield generator. It 
is quite safe from your pitiful little band. An entire legion of my

<sd>Luke's look darts from the Emperor to Vader and, finally, to the sword

<sd>Biker scouts race around and over the two droids, blasting away at the 
little Ewoks as the furries scurry for cover.</sd>

<sd>A group of Ewoks have moved a primitive catapult into position. They 
fire off a large boulder that hits one of the walkers. The walker turns 
and heads for the catapult, blasting away with both guns. The Ewoks 
abandon their weapons and flee in all directions. Just as the walker 
moves in to stomp the catapult, Ewoks drop vines restraining two huge 
logs that swing down and smash thewalker's head flat.</sd>

<sd>A line of Ewoks hang desperately to a vine that is hooked to a walker's 
foot. As the walker moves along, the fuzzy creatures are dragged

giants. He's been yelling into the comlink.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LANDO	 (desperately)</speaker>
Yes! I said closer! Move as close as you can and engage those Star 
Destroyers at point-
blank range.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ACKBAR</speaker>
At that close range, we won't last long against those <name type="ORG">Star Destroyer</name>s.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LANDO</speaker>
We'll last longer then we will against that Death Star...and we might 
just take a few of
them with us.</sp>

<sd>The Rebel cruisers move very close to the <name type="ORG">Imperial</name> <name type="ORG">Star Destroyer</name>s and 
begin to blast away at point-blank range. Tiny fighters race across the 
giant surfaces, against a backdrop of laser fire.</sd>

<sd>The control tower of a <name type="ORG">Star Destroyer</name> is under attack.</sd>

<sp><speaker>REBEL PILOT</speaker>
She's gonna blow!</sp>

<sd>Y-WING PILOT
I'm hit!</sd>

<sd>The damaged Y-wing plummets toward the <name type="ORG">Star Destroyer</name>, and crashes into 
the control tower, exploding.</sd>

<setting>114  INT EMPEROR'S TOWER - THRONE ROOM</setting>

<sd>Out of the window and on the view screens, the Rebel fleet is being 
decimated in blinding explosions of light and debris. But in here there 
is no sound of battle. The Emperor turns to Luke.</sd>

<sp><speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
Your fleet has lost. And your friends on <name type="LOC">the Endor moon</name> will not 
survive. There is no escape, my young apprentice. The <name type="ORG">Alliance</name> will 
die...as will your friends.</sp>

<sd>Luke's eyes are full of rage. Vader watches him.</sd>

<sp><speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
Good. I can feel your anger. I am defenseless.  Take your weapon! 
Strike me down with all your hatred, and your journey towards the dark 
side will be complete.</sp>

<sd>Luke can resist no longer. The lightsaber flies into his hand. He 
ignites it in an instant and swings at the Emperor. Vader's lightsaber 
flashes into view, blocking Luke's blow before it can reach the 
Emperor. The two blades spark at contact. Luke turns to fight his 
father.</sd>

<setting>115  EXT FOREST</setting>

<sd>The battle rages on. Stormtroopers fire on Ewoks with sophisticated 
weapons while their furry little adversaries sneak up behind the 
<name type="ORG">Imperial</name> troopers and bash them over the head with large clubs.</sd>

<sd>A walker marches through the undergrowth blasting Ewoks as it goes. An 
Ewok warrior gives the signal, and a pile of logs is cut loose. The 
logs tumble under the walker's feet, causing it to slip and slide until 
it finally topples over with a great crash.</sd>

<sd>A scout bike races past and is lassoed with a heavy vine. The other end 
of the vine is tied to a tree, and the bike swings around in ever-
tightening circles until it runs out of rope and
crashes into the trees with a huge explosion.</sd>

<sd>Chewie swings on a vine to the roof of one of the walkers. Two Ewoks 
cling to him. They land with a thud on the top of the lurching machine, 
then hang on for dear life. One of the Ewoks peeks through the window.</sd>

<sp><speaker>WALKER PILOT #1</speaker>
Look!</sp>

<sp><speaker>PILOT #2</speaker>
Get him off of there!</sp>

<sd>The walker pilot opens the hatch to see what's going on. He is yanked 
out and tossed overboard before he can scream. The two Ewoks jump into 
the cockpit and knock the second pilot unconscious. The Ewoks are 
thrown violently as the mighty machine careens out of control. Outside, 
Chewie is almost knocked overboard; he sticks his head into the hatch 
with a series of angry barks. The Ewoks are too busy and frightened to 
listen to the <name type="NORP">Wookiee</name>'s complaint. Chewie slips inside the walker.</sd>

<sd>Chewbacca's walker moves through the forest, firing laser blasts at 
unsuspecting stormtroopers, and destroying other <name type="ORG">Imperial</name> walkers. The 
Ewoks shout and cheer as the giant machine helps turn the tide of the 
battle in their favor.</sd>

<setting>116  EXT FOREST - GENERATOR BUNKER</setting>

<sd><name type="NORP">Han</name> works furiously at the control panel; wires spark as he attempts to 
hotwire the door. He motions to Leia, who is blasting away at some 
stormtroopers.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
I think I got it. I got it!</sp>

<sd>The three wires spark as the connection is made. With a LOUD WHOOSH, a 
second blast door crashes down in front of the first.</sd>

<sd><name type="NORP">Han</name> frowns and turns back to the wires again. Leia exchanges shots with 
stormtroopers in the bushes, then suddenly cries out in pain, her 
shoulder hit by a laser blast.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
Oh, Princess Leia, are you all right?</sp>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
Let's see.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LEIA</speaker>
It's not bad.</sp>

<sp><speaker>STORMTROOPER	 (OS)</speaker>

<sd>They freeze.</sd>

<sp><speaker>THREEPIO</speaker>
Oh, dear.</sp>

<sp><speaker>STORMTROOPER</speaker>
Don't move!</sp>

<sd>Leia holds her laser gun ready, behind <name type="NORP">Han</name>, out of view of the two 
stormtroopers moving toward them. <name type="NORP">Han</name> and Leia's eyes lock; the moment 
seems suspended in time.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
I love you.</sp>

<sd>Another shared look between them, as she smiles up at <name type="NORP">Han</name>.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LEIA</speaker>
I know.</sp>

<sp><speaker>STORMTROOPER</speaker>
<name type="NORP">Han</name>ds up! Stand up!</sp>

<sd><name type="NORP">Han</name> stands up slowly and turns, revealing the gun in Leia's hand. She 
disposes of the stormtroopers in a flash. As <name type="NORP">Han</name> turns back toward 
Leia, he looks up to see a giant walker approach and stand before him, 
its deadly weapons aimed right at him.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN	 (to Leia)</speaker>
Stay back.</sp>

<sd>The hatch on top of the walker opens and Chewie sticks his head out and 
barks triumphantly.</sd>

<sp><speaker>HAN</speaker>
Chewie!  Get down here!  She's wounded!  No, wait....  I got an idea.</sp>

<setting>117  INT EMPEROR'S TOWER - THRONE ROOM</setting>

<sd>Luke and Vader are engaged in a man-to-man duel of lightsabers even 
more vicious then the battle on Bespin. But the young <name type="ORG">Jedi</name> has grown 
stronger in the interim, and now the advantage shifts to him. Vader is 
forced back, losing his balance, and is knocked down the stairs. Luke 
stands at the top of the stairs, ready to attack.</sd>

<sp><speaker>EMPEROR (laughing)</speaker>
Good.  Use your aggressive feelings, boy!  Let the hate flow through 
you.</sp>

<sd>Luke looks momentarily toward the Emperor, then back to Vader, and 
realizes he is using the dark side. He steps back, turns off his 
lightsaber, and relaxes, driving the hate from his being.</sd>

<sp><speaker>VADER</speaker>
Obi-Wan has taught you well.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
I will not fight you, father.</sp>

<sd>Vader walks back up the stairs to Luke.</sd>

<sp><speaker>VADER</speaker>
You are unwise to lower your defenses.</sp>

<sd>Vader attacks, forcing Luke on the defensive. The young <name type="ORG">Jedi</name> leaps in 
an amazing reverse flip up to the safety of the catwalk overhead. Vader 
stands below him.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
Your thoughts betray you, father. I feel the good in you...the 
conflict.</sp>

<sp><speaker>VADER</speaker>
There is no conflict.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before, and I don't believe 
you'll destroy me
now.</sp>

<sp><speaker>VADER</speaker>
You underestimate the power of the dark side. If you will not fight, 
then you will meet
your destiny.</sp>

<sd>Vader throws the laser sword and it cuts through the supports holding 
the catwalk, then returns to Vader's hand. Luke tumbles to the ground 
in a shower of sparks and rolls out of sight under the Emperor's 
platform. Vader moves to find him.</sd>

<sp><speaker>EMPEROR	 (laughs)</speaker>
Good.  Good.</sp>

<setting>118  EXT SPACE - AIR BATTLE</setting>

<sd>The two armadas, like their sea-bound ancestors, blast away at each 
other in individual point-blank confrontations. A <name type="ORG">Star Destroyer</name> 
explodes. The Rebel victor limps away, its back half alive with a 
series of minor explosions. The Rebel cruiser manages to move in next 
to a second <name type="ORG">Star Destroyer</name> before it explodes completely, taking the 
<name type="ORG">Imperial</name> <name type="ORG">Star Destroyer</name> with it. The <name type="ORG">Falcon</name> and several fighters attack

<sp><speaker>HAN/PILOT	 (VO)</speaker>

<sd>As the door to the bunker opens and the <name type="ORG">Imperial</name> troops rush out, 
they're surprised to find themselves surrounded by <name type="ORG">Rebels</name>, their

<setting>122  INT EMPEROR'S TOWER - THRONE ROOM</setting>

<sd>Vader stalks the low-ceilinged area on the level below the throne, 
searching for Luke in the semi-darkness, his lightsaber held ready.</sd>

<sp><speaker>VADER</speaker>
You cannot hide forever, Luke.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
I will not fight you.</sp>

<sp><speaker>VADER</speaker>
Give yourself to the dark side. It is the only way you can save your 
friends. Yes, your

for...</sp>

<sd>Vader stops and senses something. Luke shuts his eyes tightly, in 
anguish.</sd>

<sp><speaker>VADER</speaker>
Sister! So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed 
her, too. Obi-Wan
was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will 
not turn to the dark
side, then perhaps she will.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
Never-r-r!</sp>

<sd>Luke ignites his lightsaber and screams in anger, rushing at hisfather 
with a frenzy we have not seen before. Sparks fly as Luke and Vader 
fight in the cramped area. Luke's hatred forces Vader to retreat out of 
the low area and across a bridge overlooking a vast elevator shaft. 
Each stroke of Luke's sword drives his father further toward defeat.</sd>

<sd>The Dark Lord is knocked to his knees, and as he raises his sword to 
block another onslaught, Luke slashes Vader's right hand off at the 
wrist, causing metal and electronic parts to fly from the mechanical 
stump. Vader's sword clatters uselessly away, over the
edge of the platform and into the bottomless shaft below. Luke moves 
over Vader and holds the blade of his sword to the Dark Lord's throat. 
The Emperor watches with uncontrollable, pleased agitation.</sd>

<sp><speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
Good! Your hate has made you powerful. Now, fulfill your destiny and 
take your father's
place at my side!</sp>

<sd>Luke looks at his father's mechanical hand, then to his own mechanical, 
black-gloved hand, and realizes how much he is becoming like his 
father. He makes the decision for which he has spent a lifetime in 
preparation. Luke steps back and hurls his lightsaber away.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE</speaker>
Never! I'll never turn to the dark side. You've failed, Your Highness. 
I am a <name type="ORG">Jedi</name>,
like my father before me.</sp>

along with the bunker.</sd>

<setting>125  INT EMPEROR'S TOWER - THRONE ROOM</setting>

<sd>Luke stands still, as the Emperor reaches the bottom of thestairs. The 
Emperor's laughter has turned to anger. He raises his arms toward Luke.</sd>

<sp><speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
If you will not be turned, you will be destroyed.</sp>

<sd>Blinding bolts of energy, evil lightning, shoot from the Emperor's 
hands at Luke. Even in his surprise, the young <name type="ORG">Jedi</name> tries to use the 
<name type="ORG">Force</name> to deflect them. At first he is half successful, but after a 
moment the bolts of energy are coming with such speed and power the 
young <name type="ORG">Jedi</name> shrinks before them, his knees buckling. The wounded Vader 
struggles to his feet, and moves to stand at his master's side.</sd>

<sp><speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
Young fool...only now, at the end, do you understand.</sp>

<sd>Luke is almost unconscious beneath the continuing assault of the 
Emperor's lightning. He clutches a canister to keep from falling into 
the bottomless shaft as the bolts tear through him.</sd>

<sp><speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
Your feeble skills are no match for the power of the dark side. You 
have paid the price for
your lack of vision.</sp>

<sd>Luke writhes on the floor in unbearable pain, reaching weakly up toward 
where Vader stands watching.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LUKE	 (groans)</speaker>
Father, please. Help me.</sp>

<sd>Again Vader stands, watching Luke. He looks at his master, the Emperor, 
then back to Luke on the floor.</sd>

<sp><speaker>EMPEROR</speaker>
Now, young Skywalker...you will die.</sp>

<sd>Although it would not have seemed possible, the outpouring of bolts 
from the Emperor's fingers actually increases in intensity, the sound 
screaming through the room. Luke's body writhes in pain.</sd>

<sd>Vader grabs the Emperor from behind, fighting for control of the robed 
figure despite the Dark Lord's weakened body and gravely weakened arm. 
The Emperor struggles in his embrace, his bolt-shooting hands now 
lifted high, away from Luke. Now the white lightning arcs back to 
strike at Vader. He stumbles with his load as the sparks rain off his 
helmet and flow down over his black cape. He holds his evil master high 
over his head and walks to the edge of the abyss at the central core of 
the throne room. With one final burst of his once awesome strength, 
Darth Vader hurls the Emperor's body into the bottomless shaft.</sd>

<sd>The Emperor's body spins helplessly into the void, arcing as it falls 
into the abyss. Finally, when the body is far down the shaft, it 
explodes, creating a rush of air through the room.Vader's cape is 
whipped by the wind and he staggers, and collapses toward the 
bottomless hole. Luke crawls to his father's side and pulls him away 
from the edge of the abyss to safety. Both the young <name type="ORG">Jedi</name> and the giant 
warrior are too weak to move.</sd>

<sd>In the midst of this uproar, Luke is trying to carry the enormous
