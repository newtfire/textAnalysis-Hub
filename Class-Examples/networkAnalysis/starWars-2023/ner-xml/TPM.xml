<crawl>Turmoil has engulfed <name type="GPE">the Galactic Republic</name>. The taxation of
trade routes to outlaying star systems is in dispute.  Hoping
to resolve the matter with a blockade of deadly battleships,
the greedy Trade <name type="ORG">Federation</name> has stopped all shipping to the
small planet of <name type="ORG">Naboo</name>.While <name type="ORG">the congress of the Republic</name> endlessly debates this
alarming chain of events, the <name type="ORG">Supreme</name> Chancellor has secretly
dispatched two <name type="ORG">Jedi</name> <name type="ORG">Knights</name>, the guardians of peace and
justice in the galaxy, to settle the conflict... </crawl>

<sd>PAN DOWN to reveal a small space cruiser heading TOWARD CAMERA
at great speed. PAN with the cruiser as it heads towardthe
beautiful green planet of <name type="ORG">Naboo</name>, which is surrounded by
hundreds of Trade <name type="ORG">Federation</name> battleships.</sd>

<setting>INT. REPUBLIC CRUISER - COCKPIT</setting>

<sd>In the cockpit of the cruise, the CAPTAIN and PILOT maneuver
closer to one of the battleships.</sd>

<sp><speaker>QUI-GON (O.S.)</speaker>
	Captain.</sp>

<sd>The Captain turns to an unseen figure sitting behind her.</sd>

<sp><speaker>CAPTAIN</speaker>
	Yes, sir?</sp>

<sp><speaker>QUI-GON (O.S.)</speaker>
	Tell them we wish to board at once.</sp>

<sp><speaker>CAPTAIN</speaker>
	Yes, sir.</sp>

<sd>The CAPTAIN looks to her view screen, where NUTE GUNRAY, a
Neimoidian trade viceroy, waits for a reply.</sd>

<sp><speaker>CAPTAIN</speaker>
	With all due respect for the Trade
	<name type="ORG">Federation</name>, the Ambassadors for the
	<name type="ORG">Supreme</name> Chancellor wish to board
	immediately.</sp>

<sp><speaker>NUTE</speaker>
	Yes, yes, of coarse...ahhh...as you
	know, our blockade is perfectly legal,
	and we'd be happy to recieve the
	Ambassador...Happy to.</sp>

<sd>The screen goes black. Out the cockpit window, the sinister
battleship looms ever closer.</sd>

<setting>EXT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - DOCKING BAY - SPACE (FX)</setting>

<sd>The small space cruiser docks in the enormous main bay of
the <name type="ORG">Federation</name> battleship.</sd>

<setting>INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - DOCKING BAY - SPACE</setting>

<sd>A PROTOCOL DROID, TC-14, waits at the door to the docking
bay. Two WORKER DROIDS, PK-4 and EG-9 watch.</sd>

<sp><speaker>PK-4</speaker>
	They must be important if the Viceroy
	sent one of those useless protocol
	gearheads to greet them.</sp>

<sd>The door opens, and the Republic cruiser can be seen in the
docking bay.  Two darkly robed figures are greeted by TC-14.</sd>

<sp><speaker>TC-14</speaker>
	I'm TC-14 at your service. This way,
	please.</sp>

<sd>They move off down the hallway.</sd>

<sp><speaker>EG-9</speaker>
	A Republic cruiser! That's
	trouble...don't you think?</sp>

<sp><speaker>PK-4</speaker>
	I'm not made to think.</sp>

<setting>INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - CONFERENCE ROOM</setting>

<sd>A door slides open, and the two cloaked shapes are led PAST
CAMERA into the formal conference room by TC-14.</sd>

<sp><speaker>TC-14</speaker>
	I hope you honoured sirs with the
	most comfortable here. My master
	will be with you shortly.</sp>

<sd>The droid bows before OBI-WAN KENOBI and QUI- GON JINN. He
backs out the door and it closes. The JEDI lower their hoods
and look out a large window at the lush green planet of <name type="ORG">Naboo</name>.
QUI-GON sixty years old, has long white hair in a ponytail.
He is tall and striking, with blue eyes. OBI-WAN is twenty
five, with very short brown hair, pale skin, and blue eyes.
Several exotic, bird-like creatures SING in a cage near the
door.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-WAN</speaker>
	I have a bad feeling about this.</sp>

<sp><speaker>QUI-GON</speaker>
	I don't sense anything.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-WAN</speaker>
	It's not about the mission, Master,
	it's somethging...elsewhere...elusive.</sp>

<sp><speaker>QUI-GON</speaker>
	Don't center on your anxiety, Obi-
	Wan. Keep your concentration here
	and now where it belongs.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-WAN</speaker>
	Master Yoda says I should be mindful
	of the future...</sp>

<sp><speaker>QUI-GON</speaker>
	...but not at the expense of the
	moment. Be mindful of the living
	<name type="ORG">Force</name>, my young Padawan.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-WAN</speaker>
	Yes, Master...how do you think the
	trade viceroy will deal with the
	chancellor's demands?</sp>

<sp><speaker>QUI-GON</speaker>
	These <name type="ORG">Federation</name> types are cowards.
	The negotiations will be short.</sp>


<setting>INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE</setting>

<sd>NUTE GUNRAY and DAULTRAY DOFINE stand, stunned, before TC-
14.</sd>

<sp><speaker>NUTE</speaker>
	     (shaken)
	What?!? What did you say?</sp>

<sp><speaker>TC-14</speaker>
	The Ambassadors are <name type="ORG">Jedi</name> <name type="ORG">Knights</name>, I
	believe.</sp>

<sp><speaker>DOFINE</speaker>
	I knew it! They were sent to force a
	settlement, eh. Blind me, we're done
	for!</sp>

<sp><speaker>NUTE</speaker>
	Stay calm?  I'll wager the <name type="ORG">Senate</name>
	isn't aware of the <name type="ORG">Supreme</name>
	Chancellor's moves here. Go. Distract
	them until I can contact Lord Sidious.</sp>

<sp><speaker>DOFINE</speaker>
	Are you brain dead? I'm not going in
	there with two <name type="ORG">Jedi</name>! Send the droid.</sp>

<sd>Dofine turns to TC-14, who lets out a squeaky sigh.</sd>

<setting>INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - CONFERENCE ROOM</setting>

<sp><speaker>OBI-WAN</speaker>
	Is it their nature to make us wait
	this long?</sp>

<sd>The door to the conference room slides open, and TC-14 enters
with a tray of drinks and food.</sd>

<sp><speaker>QUI-GON</speaker>
	No. I sense an unusual amount of
	fear for something as trivial as
	this dispute.</sp>

<sd>Obi-Wan takes a drink.</sd>

<setting>INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE</setting>

<sd>Nute, Dofine, and Rune Haako are before the hologram of Darth
Sidious, a robed figure whose face is obscured by a hood.</sd>

<sp><speaker>DOFINE</speaker>
	This scheme of yours has failed,
	Lord Sidious. The blockade is
	finished! We dare not go against
	these <name type="ORG">Jedi</name>.</sp>

<sp><speaker>DARTH SIDIOUS</speaker>
	You seem more worried about the <name type="ORG">Jedi</name>
	than you are of me, Dofine. I am
	amused.. Viceroy!</sp>

<sd>Nute, looking very nervous, steps forward.</sd>

<sp><speaker>NUTE</speaker>
	Yes, My lord.</sp>

<sp><speaker>DARTH SIDIOUS</speaker>
	I don't want that stunted slime in
	my sight again. Do you understand?</sp>

<sp><speaker>NUTE</speaker>
	Yes, My Lord.</sp>

<sd>Nute gives Dofine a fierce look, and Dofine, terrified, rushed
off the bridge.</sd>

<sp><speaker>DARTH SIDIOUS</speaker>
	This turns of events is unfortunate.
	We must accelerate our plans, Viceroy.
	Begin landing your troops.</sp>

<sp><speaker>NUTE</speaker>
	Ahh, My Lord, is that, Legal?</sp>

<sp><speaker>DARTH SIDIOUS</speaker>
	I will make it legal.</sp>

<sp><speaker>NUTE</speaker>
	And, the <name type="ORG">Jedi</name>??</sp>

<sp><speaker>DARTH SIDIOUS</speaker>
	The Chancellor should never have
	brought them into this. Kill them,
	immediatly.</sp>

<sp><speaker>NUTE</speaker>
	Ye..Yes, My Lord. As you wish.</sp>

<setting>INT. REPUBLIC CRUISER - COCKPIT - DOCKING BAY</setting>

<sd>In the Cockpit of the Cruiser, the Captain and Pilot look up
and see a gun turret swing around and point directly at them.</sd>

<sp><speaker>PILOT</speaker>
	Captain !? Look !!</sp>

<sp><speaker>CAPTAIN</speaker>
	No! Warn...</sp>

<setting>EXT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - HANGER BAY</setting>

<sd>The battle gun fires. The Republic Cruiser explodes.</sd>

<setting>INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - CONFERENCE ROOM</setting>

<sd>Gui-Gon and Obi-Wan leap up to a standing position with their
light sabers drawn. TC-14 jumps back, startled, spilling the
drinks tray.</sd>

<sp><speaker>TC-14</speaker>
	Ahhh, Sorry, sir. The Viceroy...</sp>

<sd>Gui-Gon and Obi-Wan turn off their swords and listen intently.
A faint hissing sound can be heard.</sd>

<sp><speaker>GUI-GON</speaker>
	Gas!</sp>

<sd><name type="ORG">Qui-Gon</name> and Obi-Wan each taken a sudden deep breath and
holding it.  The exotic bird-like creatures in the cage dorp
dead.</sd>

<setting>INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - HALLWAY</setting>

<sd>A hologram of NUTE , surrounded by BATTLE DROIDS, appears in
the conference room hallway.</sd>

<sp><speaker>NUTE</speaker>
	They must be dead by now. Blast,
	what's left of them.</sp>

<sd>The hologram fades off, as a BATTLE DROID, OWO-1, cautiously
opens the door. A deadly green cloud billows from the room.
BATTLE DROIDS cock their weapons as a figure stumbles out of
the smoke. It is TC-14 , carrying the tray of drinks.</sd>

<sp><speaker>TC-14</speaker>
	Oh, excuse me, so sorry.</sp>

<sd>The PROTOCOL DROID passes the armed camp just as two flashing
laser swords fly out of the deadly fog, cutting down several
BATTLE DROIDS before they can fire.</sd>

<setting>INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE</setting>

<sd>The bridge is a cocophony of alarms. NUTE and RUNE watch OWO-
1 on the viewscreen.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OWO-1</speaker>
	Not sure exactly what...</sp>

<sd>OWO-1 is suddenly cut in half in mid-sentence. RUNE gives
NUTE a worried look.</sd>

<sp><speaker>NUTE</speaker>
	What in blazes is going on down there?</sp>

<sp><speaker>RUNE</speaker>
	Have you ever encountered a <name type="ORG">Jedi</name>
	Knight before, sir?</sp>

<sp><speaker>NUTE</speaker>
	Well, not exactly, but I don't...
	     (panicked)
	Seal off the bridge.</sp>

<sp><speaker>RUNE</speaker>
	That won't be enough, sir.</sp>

<sd>The doors to the bridge SLAM shut.</sd>

<sp><speaker>NUTE</speaker>
	I want destroyer droids up here at
	once!!!</sp>

<sp><speaker>RUNE</speaker>
	We will not survive this.</sp>

<setting>INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - HALLWAY - OUTSIDE BRIDGE</setting>

<sd>QUI-GON cuts several BATTLE DROIDS in half, creating a shower
of sparks and metal parts. OBI-WAN raises his hand, sending
several BATTLE DROIDS crashing into the wall.</sd>

<sd>QUI-GON makes his way to the bridge door and begins to cut
through it.</sd>

<setting>INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE</setting>

<sd>The CREW is very nervous as sparks start flying around the
bridge door.</sd>

<sd>QUI-GON and OBI-WAN are on the view screen.</sd>

<sp><speaker>NUTE</speaker>
	Close the blast doors!!!</sp>

<sd>The huge, very thick blast door slams shut, followed by a
second door, then a third. There is a hissing sound as the
huge doors seal shut. QUI-GON tabs the door with his sword.
The screen goes black as a red spot appears in the center of
the blast door.</sd>

<sp><speaker>RUNE</speaker>
	...They're still coming through!</sp>

<sd>On the door, chunks of molten metal begin to drop away.</sd>

<sp><speaker>NUTE</speaker>
	Impossible!! This is impossible!!</sp>

<sp><speaker>RUNE</speaker>
	Where are those destroyer droids?!</sp>

<setting>INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - HALLWAY - OUTSIDE BRIDGE</setting>

<sd>Ten ugly destroyer WHEEL DROIDS roll down the hallway at
full speed. Just before they get to the bridge area, they
stop and transform into their battle configuration. QUI-GON
can't see them but senses their presence.</sd>

<sp><speaker>QUI-GON</speaker>
	Destroyer droids!</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-WAN</speaker>
	Offhand, I'd say this mission is
	past the negotiaion stage.</sp>

<sd>The WHEEL DROIDS, led by P-59, rush the entry area from three
hallways, blasting away with their laser guns. They stop
firing and stand in a semi-circle as the smoke clears. OBI-
WAN and QUI-GON are nowhere to be seen.</sd>

<sp><speaker>P-59</speaker>
	Switch to bio...There they are!</sp>

<sd>The <name type="ORG">Jedi</name> materialize at the far end of the hallway and dash
through the doorway that slams shut. The WHEEL DROIDS blast
away at the two JEDI with their laser swords.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-WAN</speaker>
	They have shield generators!</sp>

<sp><speaker>QUI-GON</speaker>
	It's a standoff! Let's go!</sp>

<setting>INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE</setting>

<sd>NUTE and RUNE stand on the bridge, watching the view screen
as the WHEEL</sd>

<sd>DROIDS' POV speeds to the doorway.</sd>

<sp><speaker>RUNE</speaker>
	We have them on the run, sir...they're
	no match for destroyer droids.</sp>

<sp><speaker>TEY HOW</speaker>
	Sir, they've gone up the ventilation
	shaft.</sp>

<setting>INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - MAIN BAY</setting>

<sd>QUI-GON and OBI-WAN appear at a large vent in a giant hanger
bay. They are careful not to be seen. Thousands of BATTLE
DROIDS are loading onto landing craft.</sd>

<sp><speaker>QUI-GON</speaker>
	Battle droids.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-WAN</speaker>
	It's an invisible army.</sp>

<sp><speaker>QUI-GON</speaker>
	It's an odd play for the Trade
	<name type="ORG">Federation</name>. We've got to warn the
	<name type="ORG">Naboo</name> and contact Chancellor Valorum.
	Let's split up. <name type="ORG">Stow</name> aboard separate
	ships and meet down on the planet.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-WAN</speaker>
	You were right about one thing,
	Master. The negotiations were short.</sp>

<setting>INT. FEDERATION BATTLESHIP - BRIDGE</setting>

<sd>TEY HOW recieves a transmission.</sd>

<sp><speaker>TEY HOW</speaker>
	Sir, a transmission from the planet.</sp>

<sp><speaker>RUNE</speaker>
	It's Queen Amidala herself.</sp>

<sp><speaker>NUTE</speaker>
	At last we're getting results.</sp>

<sd>On the view screen, QUEEN AMIDALA appears in her throne room.
Wearing her elaborate headdress and robes, she sits,
surrounded by the GOVERNING COUNCIL and FOUR HANDMAIDENS,
EIRTAE, YANE, RABE, and SACHE.</sd>

<sp><speaker>NUTE</speaker>
	Again you come before me, Your
	highness. The <name type="ORG">Federation</name> is
	pleased.</sp>

<sp><speaker>AMIDALA</speaker>
	You will not be pleased when you
	hear what I have to say,
	Viceroy...Your trade boycott of our
	planet has ended.</sp>

<sd>NUTE smirks at RUNE.</sd>

<sp><speaker>NUTE</speaker>
	I was not aware of such a failure.</sp>

<sp><speaker>AMIDALA</speaker>
	I have word that the <name type="ORG">Senate</name> is finally
	voting on this blockade of yours.</sp>

<sp><speaker>NUTE</speaker>
	I take it you know the outcome. I
	wonder why they bother to vote.</sp>

<sp><speaker>AMIDALA</speaker>
	Enough of this pretense, Viceroy!
	I'm aware the Chancellor's Ambassadors
	are with you now, and that you have
	beencommanded to reach a settlement.</sp>

<sp><speaker>NUTE</speaker>
	I know nothing about any
	Ambassadors...you must be mistaken.</sp>

<sd>AMIDALA, surprised at his reaction, studies him carefully.</sd>

<sp><speaker>AMIDALA</speaker>
	Beware, Viceroy....the <name type="ORG">Federation</name> is
	going too far this time.</sp>

<sp><speaker>NUTE</speaker>
	Your Highness, we would never do
	anything without the approval of the
	<name type="ORG">Senate</name>. You assume too much.</sp>

<sp><speaker>AMIDALA</speaker>
	We will see.</sp>

<sd>The QUEEN fades off, and the view screen goes black.</sd>

<sp><speaker>RUNE</speaker>
	She's right, the <name type="ORG">Senate</name> will never....</sp>

<sp><speaker>NUTE</speaker>
	It's too late now.</sp>

<sp><speaker>RUNE</speaker>
	Do you think she suspects an attack?</sp>

<sp><speaker>NUTE</speaker>
	I don't know, but we must move quickly
	to disrupt all communications down
	there.</sp>

<setting>INT. NABOO PALACE - THRONE ROOM</setting>

<sd>The QUEEN, EIRTAE, SACHE and her Governor, SIO BIBBLE, stand
before a hologram of SENATOR PALPATINE, a thin, kindly man.</sd>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE</speaker>
	...How could that be true? I have
	assurances from the Chancellor...his
	Ambassaodrs did arrive. It must be
	the...get...negotiate...</sp>

<sd>The hologram of PALPATIONE sputters and fades away.</sd>

<sp><speaker>AMIDALA</speaker>
	Senator Palpatine?!?
	     (turns to Panaka)
	What's happening?</sp>

<sd>Capt. Panaka turns to his SARGEANT.</sd>

<sp><speaker>CAPT. PANAKA</speaker>
	Check the transmission generators...</sp>

<sp><speaker>BIBBLE</speaker>
	A malfunction?</sp>

<sp><speaker>CAPT. PANAKA</speaker>
	It could be the <name type="ORG">Federation</name> jamming
	us. Your Highness.</sp>

<sp><speaker>BIBBLE</speaker>
	A communications disruption can only
	mean one thing. Invasion.</sp>

<sp><speaker>AMIDALA</speaker>
	Don't jump to conclusions, Governor.
	The <name type="ORG">Federation</name> would not dare go
	that far.</sp>

<sp><speaker>CAPT. PANAKA</speaker>
	The <name type="ORG">Senate</name> would revoke their trade
	franchise, and they'd be finished.</sp>

<sp><speaker>AMIDALA</speaker>
	We must continue to rely on
	negotiation.</sp>

<sp><speaker>BIBBLE</speaker>
	Negotiation? We've lost all
	communications!...and where atre the
	Chancellors Ambassadors? How can we
	negotiate? We must prepare to defend
	ourselves.</sp>

<sp><speaker>CAPT. PANAKA</speaker>
	This is a dangerous situation, Your
	Highness.  Our security volunteers
	will be no match against a battle-
	hardened <name type="ORG">Federation</name> army.</sp>

<sp><speaker>AMIDALA</speaker>
	I will not condone a course of action
	that will lead us to war.</sp>

<sd>Three landing craft slowly descend through the cloud cover

Animals begin to run past him in a panic.</sd>

<sd>An odd, frog-like Gungan, <name type="ORG">JAR</name> <name type="ORG">JAR</name> INKS, squats holding a

<sd>SEBULBA, who is right next to ANAKIN, stands and waves to
his fans. A small pep band plays as his fans wave and cheer.</sd>

<sd>KITSTER attaches the giant engins to <name type="GPE">Anakin</name>'s Pod with a
long cable. SHMI gives ANAKIN a big hug and kiss. She looks
him right in the eye.</sd>

<sp><speaker>SHMI</speaker>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN</speaker>

<sd>PADME comes up and gives ANAKIN a little kiss on the cheeek.
SEBULBA bangs on a part protruding from <name type="GPE">Anakin</name>'s engine. He
looks around to see if anyone has noticed.</sd>

<sp><speaker>PADME</speaker>
	You carry all our hopes.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN</speaker>
	I won't let you down.</sp>

<sd>PADME moves away as SEBULBA edges his way next to ANAKIN and
gives him a sinister grin.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN (SUBTITLED)</speaker>
	Cha skrundee da pat, sleemo.
	(Don't count on it, slime-ball.)</sp>

<sd>ANAKIN looks the evil SEBULBA in the eye with a cold stare.
QUI-GON approaches, and SEBULBA backs off toward his racer.</sd>

<sp><speaker>JABBA (SUTITLED)</speaker>
	...Ka bazza kundee hodrudda!
	(...Let the challenge begin!)</sp>

<sd>The CROWD lets out a LOUD CHEER. QUI-GON helps ANAKIN into
his Pod. The boy straps himself into the tiny racer.</sd>

<sp><speaker>QUI-GON</speaker>
	Are you all set, Annie?
	     (<name type="GPE">Anakin</name> nods)
	Remember, concentrate on the moment.
	Feel. Don't think. Trust your

	May the <name type="ORG">Force</name> be with you.</sp>

<sd>QUI-GON steps away as ANAKIN puts on his goggles. The PILOTS
flip switches, and powerful energy binders shoot between the
engines. ANAKIN flips a switch, and his engine starts. The
incredible ROAR of high-powered engines igniting echoes
throughout the arena. One driver, ODY MANDRELL, yells at a
droid (DUM-4) to get away from the front of his engine.  The
crowd is tense.</sd>

<sp><speaker>SHMI</speaker>

<sp><speaker>PADME</speaker>

<sd>Jabba bites off the head of a frog and spits it at a gong,
signaling the start of the race.</sd>

<setting>EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - STARTING GRID - DAY</setting>

<sd>On a bridge over the track, a great green light at the center
flashes. The Podracers shoot forward with a high-pitches
scream. ANAKIN'S engine floods and coughs - then dies. All
the other Podracers except one swerve around him and dissapear
down the track. The slave boy struggles to get his racer
started. The two-headed announcer reports.</sd>

<sp><speaker>FODE/BEED (O.S.)</speaker>
	A : An dare ovv!
	(And they're off!)</sp>

	B : Oh...wait. Little Skywalker has
	stalled.

<sd>PADME and <name type="ORG">JAR</name> <name type="ORG">JAR</name> are very dissapointed with ANAKIN. QUI-GON
puts his arm around a very worried SHMI to comfort her.
Finally, <name type="GPE">Anakin</name>'s engines ignite. He zooms away after the
receeding pack of competitors, leaving one quadra-Pod racer
still trying to get started. The two-headed ANNOUNCER
describes the race as it progresses.</sd>

<sp><speaker>FODE/BEED (O.S.)</speaker>
	B : And there goes Skywalker... He'll
	be hard pressed to catch up with the
	leaders today.</sp>

<setting>EXT. MOS ESPA - RACETRACK - DAY (FX)</setting>

<sd>The Podracers fly across the desert. SEBULBA is running neck
and neck with MAWHONIC. They round the first turn in the
track, side by side.  SEBULBA drives his Pod into his rival,
forcing him into the wall of a large rock formation. MAWHONIC
crashes in a spectacular display of fire and smoke.  ANAKIN
is much faster than the back-end stragglers and passes them
easily.</sd>

<sd>One of the drivers, GASGANO, won't let ANAKIN by. ANAKIN
tries to pass him on one side and is cut off. He then tries
to pass him on the other side ansd is cut off. As they come
up on a cliff drop-off, ANAKIN backs off, then guns it as
GASGANO goes over the cliff. ANAJIN accelerates so fast that
he sails right over the top of GASGANO and speeds away.</sd>

<sd>Four TUSKEN RAIDERS perched above the race course fire their
rifles at the Pods racing in the canyon below them. One shot
ricochets off the back of <name type="GPE">Anakin</name>'s Pod.</sd>

<sp><speaker>FODE/BEED</speaker>

<sd>JABBA THE HUTT and the crowd watch the progress of the race
on small, hand-held view screens. <name type="ORG">JAR</name> <name type="ORG">JAR</name> is looking over
the shoulder of a strange alien named FANTA.</sd>

<sp><speaker><name type="ORG">JAR</name> <name type="ORG">JAR</name></speaker>

<sd>FANTA moves the view screen out of <name type="GPE">Jar Jar</name>'s view. PADME,
SHMI, and QUI-GON watch another screen and look worried.</sd>

<sd><name type="ORG">ARTOO</name>, down in the pits with KITSTER, lets out a worried
sigh. The driver of the quadra-Pod looks worried.</sd>

<setting>EXT. MOS ESPA - RACETRACK - DAY (FX)</setting>

<sd>ANAKIN is powering around corners and over hills and cliffs,
passing other racers right and left. SEBULBA is in the lead.
He is being challenged by another racer, XELBREE.</sd>

<sd>SEBULBA slows a little, and as XELBREE pulls alongside, he
opens a side vent on the racer's engine and the exhaust starts
to cut through the alien's engine.</sd>

<sd>The blast cuts along the engine until finally it EXPLODES.
SEBULBA deftly veers away.</sd>

<sd>ANAKIN works his way through a dense mass of racers as they
zoom over a dune sea, kicking up dust.  His Pod shakes
violently as he goes over a jump.</sd>

<sd>One of the Podracers, ODY, catches one of his engines in the
sand, and the whole thing EXPLODES.</sd>

<setting>EXT. MOS ESPA - ARENA - VIEWING PLATFORM - DAY</setting>

<sd>QUI-GON sits quietly, meditating. PADME and SHMI search the
landscape for any sign of the racers.  <name type="ORG">JAR</name> <name type="ORG">JAR</name> is still
annoying FANTA for information.  The crowd SCREAMS. WATTO is
laughing with his friends, confident in <name type="GPE">Anakin</name>'s defeat.</sd>

<sd>The quadra-Pod engines start just as the racers come around
the corner. The DRIVER, BEN QUADINAROS, puts it in gear, and
the four engines go off in all directions, EXPLODING in a
spectacular display. The Pod drops to the ground as SEBULBA
enters the arena, closely followed by all the OTHER RACERS.</sd>

<sd>KITSTER strains to see as <name type="ORG">ARTOO</name> beeps excitedly. The announcer
continues.</sd>

<sp><speaker>FODE/BEED (O.S.)</speaker>

<setting>EXT. MOS ESPA - RACETRACK - DAY (FX)</setting>

<sd>Sure enough, coming around the bend is ANAKIN, quickly gaining
on the pack.</sd>

<sd>The two-headed announcer describes the action. The crowd
goes wild.</sd>

	up through the field. He's in...
	A : <name type="ORG">Steeth pa nagoola</name>!
	(Sixth place, not bad.)</sp>

<sd>ANAKIN continues to gain on the pack. Tension for SHMI and
PADME is unbearable.</sd>

<sd>ODY stops in the pits. Droids work on his engines. DUM-4
stands in front of the engine and is sucked in, causing the
engine to die. DUM-4 is spit out the back of the engine,
very bent up. The engine lets out one final wheeze, then
EXPLODES in a puff of smoke.</sd>

<sp><speaker>FODE/BEED (O.S.)</speaker>
	A : <name type="ORG">Ody Mandrell</name>! Coona wa wunda

	attention.)</sp>

<sp><speaker>ODY</speaker>
	Droids!</sp>

<sd>TERTER is getting close to SEBULBA, who purposely breaks a
small part off his Pod, sending it into Terter's engine,
causing him to veer into ANAKIN, and unhooks one of the main
straps on <name type="GPE">Anakin</name>'s engines that links the Pod to his engines.
ANAKIN struggles to keep control of the little Pod. It whips
about wildly.</sd>

<sd>As the Pod swings near the broken engine strap, ANAKIN grabs
for it.</sd>

<sd>Finally, he catches the strap and manages to unhook it to
the Pod.</sd>

<sd>SEBULBA cuts the engine of OBITOKI with his side exhaust,
and the racer crashes with a cloud of dust. A THIRD RACER,
HABBA, flie into the cloud of dust and crashes into OBITOKI.
ANAKIN rounds a corner and heads into the cloud of smoke. He
hits a part of one of the engines but regains control.</sd>

<sp><speaker>FODE/BEED (O.S.)</speaker>
	B :At the start of the third and
	final lap, <name type="LOC">Sebulba</name> is in the lead,
	closely followed by Skywalker...</sp>

<sd>ANAKIN finally catches up with SEBULBA, and runs neck and
neck over the rough terrain. <name type="ORG">JAR</name> <name type="ORG">JAR</name>, QUI-GON, SHMI, and
PADME all SCREAM s ANAKIN comes through the arena. The lights
in the tower indicate that this is the third and last lap.
WATTO begins to worry.</sd>

<sd>SEBULBA uses his side exhaust port to try to cut through
<name type="GPE">Anakin</name>'s engines.</sd>

<sd>ANAKIN manages to avoid having his engine disabled but is
forced off course.</sd>

<sp><speaker>FODE/BEED (O.S.)</speaker>
	B : Skywalker is forced onto the
	service ramp!
	A : Oh noah!</sp>

<sd>On a tight corner, ANAKIN dives to the inside and takes the
lead.</sd>

<sp><speaker>FODE/BEED (O.S.)</speaker>
	B : Amazing... a controlled thrust
	and he's back on course! What a move!</sp>

<sd>SEBULBA is furious. He stay's right on <name type="GPE">Anakin</name>'s tail, crowding
him and pushing him through the turns.</sd>

<sd>SEBULBA pushes ANAKIN harder, and the young boy has a
difficult time keeping control. One of the parts on <name type="GPE">Anakin</name>'s
engines begins to shake loose. ANAKIN sees it and switches
over to an auxiliary system. While he is trying to accomplish
this maneuver, SEBULBA races past him.</sd>

<sd>ANAKIN tries to get around SEBULBA, to no avail. Every move
ANAKIN makes, SEBULBA is able to block.</sd>

<sd>Finally, ANAKIN fakes a move into the inside as he usually
does, then tries to go around SEBULBA on the outside. They
race sid by side down the final stretch of the track.</sd>

<sp><speaker>FODE/BEED (O.S.)</speaker>
	B : He's catching <name type="LOC">Sebulba</name>.
	A : <name type="ORG">Inkabunga</name>.
	(Incredible!)</sp>

<sd>SEBULBA veers toward ANAKIN and bangs into his Pod. He crashes
into ANAKIN over and over. The young boy struggles to maintain
control as the steering rods on the two Pods become hooked
together. SEBULBA laughs at ANAKIN.</sd>

<sp><speaker>FODE/BEED (O.S.)</speaker>
	B : That little human being is out
	of his mind.
	A : <name type="NORP">Punda</name> tah punda!
	(They're neck and neck!)
	B : They're side by side!
	A : <name type="ORG">Bongo du bongu</name>!
	(Shoulder to shoulder!)</sp>

<sd>As they head for the final stretch, ANAKIN fights to unlock
the steering rods by trying to pull away from SEBULBA. The
strain on the steering rod is tremendous. Suddenly, ANAKIN's
steering arm breaks, and his Pos starts spinning.</sd>

<sd>The release of tension sends SEBULBA into an ancient statue.
One engine EXPLODES, then the other.  SEBULBA skids through
the fire-balls, blackened, but unhurt. He slides to a smoking
stop, gets out of his racer, and throws what's left of a
shifter arm on the ground. Suddenly he realizes his pants
are on fire, and he struggles to put them out.  ANAKIN flies
through the EXPLOSION as the crowd stands, CHERRING.  PADME
and <name type="ORG">JAR</name> <name type="ORG">JAR</name> jump up and down with excitment, PADME screaming
for joy. <name type="ORG">ARTOO</name> and KITSTER whistle hysterically. QUI-GON and

	Listen to your feelings; Annie, you

<sd>ANAKIN takes a deep breath, drops his head. QUI-GON and SHMI
exchange a look of concern.  When ANAKIN raises up, there
are tears in his eyes.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN</speaker>
	I'm going to miss you so much, Mom...</sp>

<sp><speaker>SHMI</speaker>

<sd>ANAKIN hugs KITSTER and runs toward QUI-GON, then stops to
look back at his mother standing in the doorway. He turns
back to QUI-GON, then turns and runs back to his mother.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN</speaker>
	     (starting to cry)
	I can't do it, Mom. I just can't.</sp>

<sd>SHMI hugs ANAKIN. QUI-GON watches from the distance. She
kneels down and looks him in the face.</sd>

<sp><speaker>SHMI</speaker>
	Annie, remember when you climbed the

<sd>ANAKIN shakes his head.</sd>

<sp><speaker>SHMI</speaker>
	This is one of those times when you

<sd>SHMI hugs ANAKIN, then turns him around so he is facing QUI-

<sd>ANAKIN runs to join QUI-GON, who has already started down

something out of the corner of his eye.  Suddenly, without
breaking his stride, he ignites his laser sword, swing around,
and lunges forward and cuts a lurking PROBE DROID in half.
QUI-GON inspects the sparking and fizzing DROID.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN</speaker>

<sd>ANAKIN drops to the ground just as DARTH MAUL sweeps over

has hit the ground, the Sith Lord has swund a death blow
with his laser sword that is barely blocked by QUI-GON.</sd>

<sd>ANAKIN picks himself up. The two galactic warriors, Sith and
<name type="ORG">Jedi</name>, are bashing each other with incredible blows. They
move in a continual cloudof dust, smashing everything around
them. This is a fierce fight. ANAKIN gets up, bewildered by
the confrontation.</sd>

<sd><name type="GPE">Anakin</name>, tentative, walks down one of the long hallways in
Senator Palpatine's quarters. He stops before a dor that is
flanked by TWO GUARDS.</sd>

<sp><speaker>GUARD</speaker>
	May I help you, son?</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN</speaker>
	I'm...I'm looking for the handmaiden,
	<name type="NORP">Padm</name>e.</sp>

<sd>The GUARD speaks into his comlink as ANAKIN looks around a

<sp><speaker>GUARD</speaker>
	The boy is here to see <name type="NORP">Padm</name>e.</sp>

<sp><speaker>RABE</speaker>
	Send him in.</sp>

<sd>The doors open, and ANAKIN enters the Queen's quarters.</sd>

<sd>RABE greets ANAKIN as TWO OTHER HANDMAIDENS come and go into
the next room.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN</speaker>
	I'd like to speak with <name type="NORP">Padm</name>e, if I
	could.</sp>

<sp><speaker>RABE</speaker>
	I'm sorry, Annie. <name type="NORP">Padm</name>e is not here

<sd>The Queen speaks out in the next room.</sd>

<sp><speaker>AMIDALA (O.S.)</speaker>

<sp><speaker>RABE</speaker>
	<name type="GPE">Anakin</name> Skywalker, to see <name type="NORP">Padm</name>e, Your

<sd>The QUEEN moves into the doorway and studies ANAKIN. ANAKIN
bows and looks down, then takes a peek at her.</sd>

<sp><speaker>AMIDALA</speaker>
	I've sent <name type="NORP">Padm</name>e on an errand.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN</speaker>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN</speaker>

<sp><speaker>AMIDALA</speaker>
	We will tell her for you. We're sure

<sd>ANAKIN bows again.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN</speaker>

<setting>EXT. CORUSCANT - GALACTIC SENATE BUILDING - DAY (FX)</setting>

<sd>A large, distinctive looking domed building stands out amid
the cityscape of <name type="GPE">Coruscant</name>.</sd>

<setting>INT. MAIN ROTUNDA - GALACTIC SENATE - DAY</setting>

<sd>The <name type="ORG">Senate</name> chambers are huge. Thousands of SENATORS and their
AIDES sit in the circular assembly area. CHANCELLOR VALORUM
sits in an elevated area in the center. Hindreds of AIDES
and DROIDS hurry about. SENATOR PALPATINE, QUEEN AMIDALA,
EIRTA, RABE, and Capt. Panaka sit in the <name type="ORG">Naboo</name> congressional
box, which is actually a floating platform. PALPATINE leans
over to the QUEEN.</sd>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE</speaker>
	If the <name type="ORG">Federation</name> moves to defer the
	motion...Your Majesty, Ibeg of you
	to ask for a resolution to end this
	congressional session.</sp>

<sp><speaker>AMIDALA</speaker>
	I wish I had your confidence in this,
	Senator.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE</speaker>
	You must force a new election for
	<name type="ORG">Supreme</name> Chancellor... I promise you
	there are many who will support us...
	it is our best chance... Your Majesty,
	our only, chance.</sp>

<sp><speaker>AMIDALA</speaker>
	You truely believe Chancellor Valorum
	will not bring our motion to a vote?</sp>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE</speaker>
	He is distracted...he is afraid. He
	will be of no help.</sp>

<sp><speaker>VALORUM</speaker>
	The Chair recognizes the Senator
	from the sovereign system of <name type="ORG">Naboo</name>.</sp>

<sd>The <name type="ORG">Naboo</name> congressional box floats into the center.</sd>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE</speaker>
	<name type="ORG">Supreme</name> Chancellor, delegates of the
	<name type="ORG">Senate</name>. A tragedy has occured on our
	peaceful system of <name type="ORG">Naboo</name>. We have
	become caugt in a dispute you're all
	well aware of, which began right
	here with the taxation of trade
	routes, and has now engulfed our
	entire planet in the oppresion of
	the Trade <name type="ORG">Federation</name>.</sp>

<sd>A second box rushes into the center of the <name type="ORG">Senate</name>. It is
filled with <name type="ORG">Federation</name> trade barons led by LOTT DOD, the
Senator for the <name type="ORG">Federation</name>.</sd>

<sp><speaker>LOTT DOD</speaker>
	This is outrageous! I object to the
	Senator's statements!</sp>

<sp><speaker>VALORUM</speaker>
	The Chair does not recognize the
	Senator from the Trade <name type="ORG">Federation</name> at
	this time. Please return to your
	station.</sp>

<sd>LOTT DOD reluctantly moves back to his place.</sd>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE</speaker>
	To state our allegations, I present
	Queen Amidala, the recently elected
	ruler of <name type="ORG">Naboo</name>, to speak on our
	behalf.</sp>

<sd>QUEEN AMIDALA stands and addresses the assembly. There is
some applause.</sd>

<sp><speaker>AMIDALA</speaker>
	Honorable representatives of the
	Republic, distinguished delegates,
	and Your Honor <name type="ORG">Supreme</name> Chancellor
	Valorum, I come to you under the
	gravest of circumstances. The <name type="ORG">Naboo</name>
	system has been invaded by force.
	Invaded...against all the laws of
	the Republic by <name type="ORG">the Droid Armies</name> of
	the Trade...</sp>

<sp><speaker>LOTT DOD</speaker>
	I object! There is no proof. This is
	incredible. We recommend a commision
	be sent to <name type="ORG">Naboo</name> to assertain the
	truth.</sp>

<sp><speaker>VALORUM</speaker>
	Overruled.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LOTT DOD</speaker>
	Your Honor, you cannot allow us to
	be condemned without reasonable
	observation. It's against all the
	rules of procedure.</sp>

<sd>A third box representing Malastare moves into the center of
the room. AKS MOE, the Ambassador, addresses the convention.</sd>

<sp><speaker>AKS MOE</speaker>
	The <name type="ORG">Congress</name> of Malastare concurs
	with the honorable delegate from the
	Trade <name type="ORG">Federation</name>. A commision must
	be appointed...that is the law.</sp>

<sp><speaker>VALORUM</speaker>
	The point...</sp>

<sd>VALORUM confers with several of his AIDES and VICE CHAIRMAN
MAS AMEDDA.</sd>

<sd>PALPATINE whispers something to the QUEEN.</sd>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE</speaker>
	Enter the bureaucrats, the true rulers
	of the Republic, and on the payroll
	of the Trade <name type="ORG">Federation</name>, I might
	add. This is where Chancellor
	Valorum's strength will dissapear.</sp>

<sp><speaker>VALORUM</speaker>
	The point is conceded...Section 523A
	take precedence here. Queen Amidala
	of the <name type="ORG">Naboo</name>, will you defer your
	motion to allow a commission to
	explore the validity of your
	accusations?</sp>

<sd>QUEEN AMIDALA is angry but remains composed.</sd>

<sp><speaker>AMIDALA</speaker>
	     (angrily)
	I will not defer... I have come before
	you to resolve this attack on our
	sovereignty now.  I was not elected
	to watch my people suffer and die
	while you discuss this invasion in a
	committee. If this body is not capable
	of action, I suggest new leadership
	is needed. I move for a "vote of no
	confidence"...in Chancellor Valorum's
	leadership.</sp>

<sp><speaker>VALORUM</speaker>
	What?...No!</sp>

<sd>This causes a great stir in the assembly. A loud mumur
cresendos into a roar of approval and jeers. CHANCELLOR
VALORUM is stunned and stands speechless. His Vice Chair,
MAS AMEDDA, takes over.</sd>

<sp><speaker>MAS AMEDDA</speaker>
	<name type="ORG">Order</name>! We shall have order...</sp>

<sd>Things settledown a little. The <name type="ORG">Federation</name> box settles next
to AMIDALA.</sd>

<sd>PRINCE BAIL ORGANA moves his box into the arena.</sd>

<sp><speaker>BAIL ORGANA</speaker>
	<name type="ORG">Alderaan</name> seconds the motion for a
	vote of no confidence in Chancellor
	Valorum.</sp>

<sp><speaker>MAS AMEDDA</speaker>
	The motion has been seconded by Bail

<sd>MAS AMEDDA turns to the confused VALORUM, and whispers
something to him.</sd>

<sp><speaker>BAIL ORGANA</speaker>
	There must be no delays. The motion
	is on the floor and must be voted
	upon in this session.</sp>

<sp><speaker>LOTT DOD</speaker>
	The Trade <name type="ORG">Federation</name> moves the motion
	be sent to the procedures committee
	for study.</sp>

<sd>The assembly begins to chant. VALORUM talks to MAS AMEDDA.</sd>

<sp><speaker>ASSEMBLY</speaker>
	Vote now! Vote now! Vote now!</sp>

<sd>PALPATINE stands next to AMIDALA.</sd>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE</speaker>
	You see, Your <name type="ORG">Majaesty</name>, the tide is
	with us... Valorum will be voted
	out, I assure you, and they will
	elect in a new Chancellor, a strong
	Chancellor, one who will not let our

<sp><speaker>MAS AMEDDA</speaker>
	The <name type="ORG">Supreme</name> Chancellor requests a
	recess. Tomorrow we will begin the
	vote.</sp>

<sd>The <name type="ORG">Federation</name> delegation is furious. VALORUM turns to
PALPATINE.</sd>

<sp><speaker>VALORUM</speaker>
	Palpatine, I thought you were my

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN</speaker>
	     (a little angry)
	What's that got to do with anything?</sp>

<sp><speaker>YODA</speaker>
	Eveything. Fear is the path to the

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE</speaker>
	A surprise, to be sure, but a welcome
	one. I promise, Your Majesty, if I

<sp><speaker>AMIDALA</speaker>

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE</speaker>
	I understand your concern, Your

<sp><speaker>AMIDALA</speaker>
	With the <name type="ORG">Senate</name> in transition, there

<sp><speaker>PALPATINE</speaker>

	Your Highness, this is a battle I do

<sp><speaker>PADME</speaker>
	The battle is a diversion. The <name type="NORP">Gungans</name>
	must draw the Droid <name type="ORG">Army</name> away from

	using the secret passages on the

<sp><speaker>QUI-GON</speaker>

<sp><speaker>PADME</speaker>
	We have a plan which should immobilize
	the Droid <name type="ORG">Army</name>. We will send what
	pilots we have to knock out the Droid
	control ship which is orbiting the
	planet. If we can get past their
	rayshields, we can sever communication
	and their droids will be helpless.</sp>

<sp><speaker>QUI-GON</speaker>
	A well-conceived plan. However,
	there's great risk. The weapons on
	your fighters may not penetrate the
	shields on the control ship.</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-WAN</speaker>
	And there's an even bigger danger.
	If the Vicroy escapes, Your Highness,
	he will return with another droid
	army.</sp>

<sp><speaker>PADME</speaker>
	That is why we must not fail to get

<sp><speaker>OBI-WAN</speaker>
	Master Yoda, Igave <name type="ORG">Qui-Gon</name> my word.
	I will train <name type="GPE">Anakin</name>. Without the
	approval of the <name type="ORG">Council</name> if I must.</sp>

<sp><speaker>YODA</speaker>
	<name type="ORG">Qui-Gon</name>'s defiance I sense in you.
	Need that, you do not. Agree, the
	council does. Your apprentice, young
	Skywalker will be.</sp>

<sd>QUI-GON's body goes up in flames as the JEDI COUNCIL, the
QUEEN, SIO BIBBLE, Capt. Panaka, the HANDMAIDENS, and ABOUT
ONE HUNDRED NABOO TROOPES, TWENTY OTHER JEDI, PALPATINE, OBI-
WAN (standing with ANAKIN), <name type="ORG">JAR</name> <name type="ORG">JAR</name>, BOSS NASS, and TWENTY
OTHER GUNGAN WARRIORS watch. There is a drum roll that stops.
Doves are released, and the body is gone. ANAKIN looks to
OBI-WAN.</sd>

<sp><speaker>OBI-WAN</speaker>
	He is one with the <name type="ORG">Force</name>, <name type="GPE">Anakin</name>...You
	must let go.</sp>

<sp><speaker>ANAKIN</speaker>
	 What will happen to me now?</sp>

<sp><speaker>OBI-WAN</speaker>
	I am your Master now. You will become
	a <name type="ORG">Jedi</name>, I promise.</sp>

<sd>To one side, MACE WINDU turns to YODA.</sd>

<sp><speaker>MACE WINDU</speaker>
	There is no doubt. The mysterious
	warrior was a Sith.</sp>

<sp><speaker>YODA</speaker>
	Always two there are... no more...
	no less. A master and an apprentice.</sp>

<sp><speaker>MACE WINDU</speaker>
	But which one was destroyed, the
	master or the apprentice?</sp>

<sd>They give each other a concerned look.</sd>
