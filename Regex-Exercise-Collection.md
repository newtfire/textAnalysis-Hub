# Regex Exercise: Bojack Horseman or your own project collection

This exercise is designed to familiarize you with regex Find and Replaced operations over a collection of files. We'll be continuing to work with the oXygen XML Editor to help us view matches before we replace. It's also possible to do regular expression match and replace operations using programming code such as Python's re library or XSLT's analyze-string, and we can explore that in your projects if you like. We find oXygen especially helpful for seeing matches as you're testing regular expressions.

To this point, we have been working with one file at a time, using the Find/Replace window. For working with a collection of files, go to the Find menu and familiarize yourself with Find/Replace in files. The options are different here.
