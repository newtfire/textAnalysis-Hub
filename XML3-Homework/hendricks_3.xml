        <verse n="1"> It's empty in the valley of <pronoun type="possessive">your</pronoun> heart The
            sun, it rises slowly as <pronoun type="object">you</pronoun> walk Away from all the fears
            And all the faults you've left behind The harvest left no food for <pronoun type="object"
            >you</pronoun> to eat <pronoun type="object">You</pronoun> cannibal, <pronoun
            type="object">you</pronoun> meat-eater, <pronoun type="object">you</pronoun> see But

                the noose around <pronoun type="possessive">your</pronoun> neck And I'll find strength in
                pain And <pronoun type="nominative">I</pronoun> will change <pronoun type="possessive adj."
                >my</pronoun> ways I'll know <pronoun type="posessive adj.">my</pronoun> name as it's
                called again </chorus>
