#pip-spacey Troubleshooting - 4/20/22

1. Open up PythonScript, go to run it, and then click the wrench on the Results screen.

2. Find the Python interpretor line. Find the path that it is set to.

3. Write down your path in an effort to keep track of your files in your Terminal (for Mac) or your Command Line (Windows).

4. Type source Scripts/activate.

5. If your command is successful, it will say (venv) in Windows and venv in Mac.

6. Stay in your terminal and do the pip-install right there.

You are now ready to run the spaCy on your computer!
