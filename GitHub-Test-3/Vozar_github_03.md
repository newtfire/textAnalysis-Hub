                <h1>Reflection on Developing Sites with GitHub Pages and WordPress</h1>
                
                <p>Creating and developing websites on different platforms offers unique insights into each environment’s benefits and challenges. For this project, I developed one website                        using GitHub Pages and another on WordPress. Reflecting on this experience, I observed distinct differences in accessibility, flexibility, and the                                               learning curve associated with each method. Below, I’ll explore these differences and the skills necessary for each platform.</p>
                
                <h2>Challenges for a New Learner</h2>
                
                <h3>GitHub Pages</h3>
                <p>For a new learner, GitHub Pages can be somewhat intimidating because of its reliance on understanding Git workflows and version control. The initial setup of pushing                            commits, configuring repositories, and managing file structures could be challenging for someone unfamiliar with these concepts. Additionally, customizing themes in GitHub                      Pages requires familiarity with Markdown and potentially HTML/CSS, which can add to the learning curve.</p>
                
                <h3>WordPress</h3>
                <p>In contrast, WordPress provides a more visual, user-friendly interface with drag-and-drop functionality, making it approachable for beginners. The lack of coding                                requirements initially feels like a relief for new learners; however, limitations in customization may prompt users to explore additional tools or code to achieve the                           desired results.</p>
                
                <h2>Advantages of Each Method</h2>
                
                <h3>GitHub Pages</h3>
                <p>GitHub Pages is particularly advantageous for users looking to learn web development basics while simultaneously familiarizing themselves with version control. It promotes a                    clean, structured workflow and enables users to track changes. GitHub also integrates easily with other developer tools, providing an environment conducive to learning                          code.</p>
                
                <h3>WordPress</h3>
                <p>For non-developers or those looking to create a site quickly without a steep learning curve, WordPress is ideal. Its interface allows rapid design and deployment,                               often with a wider array of pre-designed themes and plugins, making it convenient for users focused on content rather than code.</p>
                
                <h2>Challenges in Modifying Layout and Organization</h2>
                
                <h3>GitHub Pages</h3>
                <p>Modifying layout on GitHub Pages can be challenging, especially since it involves editing the code directly. This platform requires knowledge of HTML CSS, and possibly                          Markup, which may bedaunting for some users. Simple adjustments may require navigating through code files, which is time-consuming without coding experience.</p>
                
                <h3>WordPress</h3>
               <p>Modifications in WordPress are typically more straightforward due to its visual editor. However, the downside is often limited customization options, which can                                  restrict the user’s ability to fully personalize the site. Advanced users may find these limitations frustrating if they want to go beyond the platform’s capabilities. In my experience transitioning to WordPress for my website, I encountered significant challenges that made the process far less intuitive compared to coding my original site. I found WordPress to be difficult to navigate, with a complex interface that often felt overwhelming. Unlike the straightforward process of writing code, the reliance on themes, plugins, and various settings created an environment that was cumbersome and time-consuming. While I appreciate the potential that WordPress offers for users seeking a more visual editing experience, I ultimately found the flexibility and control of coding to be far superior for my needs.</p>
                
                <h2>Necessary Skills for Each Platform</h2>
                
                <h3>GitHub Pages</h3>
                <p>Developing a site on GitHub Pages necessitates a basic understanding of Git, as well as foundational coding skills in HTML, CSS, and possibly Markdown. Familiarity                    with these tools is crucial for creating and maintaining the website effectively.</p>
                
                <h3>WordPress</h3>
                <p>In contrast, WordPress requires minimal technical skills at the outset. A basic understanding of design principles is helpful, as is familiarity with the                                        platform’s specific features, which may include plugins, widgets, and custom layouts.</p>
                
                <h2>Skills I Want to Improve</h2>
                <p>Moving forward, I would like to improve my coding skills to streamline the development process in GitHub Pages and enhance the level of customization I can achieve. For                         WordPress, learning to use third-party tools or scripts to extend the platform’s capabilities would be valuable for overcoming the limitations I encountered. However, I found wordpress to be exceedingly difficult for absolutely no reason. I hope I never have to use it again.</p>
