# A Day In the World of a College Student


## Morning
Most mornings begin around 10 a.m., though some start as early as 5:30 a.m. A quick shower and a change of clothes precede the daily commute on trusty public transportation. With the first class at 8 a.m., punctuality is key.

## Afternoon
By the afternoon, I’m wrapping up my third class of the day. I hurry to catch the bus, making it home just in time to let my dogs out before dashing to another stop to catch a ride to work.

</ul>

## Evening
I usually arrive at work about 30 minutes early and set up my homework station in the break room. After exchanging hellos and catching up with coworkers, it's nearly time to prep the set for our first show. I head to the studio, uncover the tables, and set up the microphones and IFBs. I always double-check the IFB batteries— nothing is more stressful than one dying during a live show.
