# *"Fictional interview with phineas from phineas and ferb about how he feels about being "a little young" to be building so many inventions"*
'''

Interviewer:  
>Phineas, you and your brother Ferb have built some incredible inventions, but some people might say that you're a little young to be doing so much. How do you feel about that?

Phineas: 
>Well, I don't really think about our age when we're building. We just love to create and invent new things. Age is just a number, right? Plus, we have our older sister Candace to help us when we need it.

Interviewer: 
>That's true. Your inventions are quite impressive, but some people might be worried about the safety of some of them. How do you ensure that they're safe to use?

Phineas: 
>Safety is very important to us. Before we use any of our inventions, we always test them thoroughly and make sure they're completely safe. And if there's ever a problem, Ferb is always there to help us fix it.

Interviewer: 
>That's good to know. And what about the future? Do you have any plans for what you'll invent next?

Phineas: 
>Oh, we've got plenty of ideas! We're always thinking of new things to invent and create. We have a long list of projects we want to tackle. The possibilities are endless!

Interviewer: 
>Well, we can't wait to see what you come up with next. Thank you for talking with us, Phineas.

Phineas: 
>Thank you! It's been a pleasure.
