# GitHub Test 3

This directory is here, in the textAnalysis-Hub/GitHub-Test-3, to hold your files for Part 3 of the GitHub Test. This stage of the GitHub test series is designed to give you experience writing and posting markdown files, as well as pushing to a branch and entering a Pull Request. 

Markdown is used for writing documentation that's quick to write and easy to read, and it's used a lot on GitHub to explain processes. To learn and practice markdown, work with [GitHub's Markdown Tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) to prepare a file.  

To proceed with completing this portion of the test:

1. Check what branch you are in on your local computer's clone of this textAnalysis-Hub.
1. Make your way to the main branch (if you are not already there) using the appropriate git commands. 
1. Use the appropriate git command to update the main branch and pull in this folder (GitHub-Test-3).
1. Then create a new branch (using the appropriate git command) Name the branch with your name, a hyphen, and GitTest3, like this: `ebeshero-GitTest3`
1. Save **a markdown file** you have written into **this folder** (GitHub-Test-3) in the repo. For the purposes of our exam, the markdown must contain:
   * at least one heading
   * at least one list (bulleted or numbered)
   * at least one codeblock with a few lines of code of some kind inside (any code you've written at all: some XML, HTML, CSS, or Python). 

1. Push your branch to the remote repo and issue a new pull request asking me (@ebeshero) to merge your branch into the main branch.
