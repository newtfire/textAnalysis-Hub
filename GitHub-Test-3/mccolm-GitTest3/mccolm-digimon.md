# Digimon

Just the first topic that came to my mind!
Digimon is short for Digital Monsters. This franchise is one of the now many monster collection games.
The first sight of Digimon cam from a Manga called C'mon Digimon which released in 1997. Digimon Adventure first aired on March 7, 1999. The first Digimon game released May 23, 2000 in North America.
