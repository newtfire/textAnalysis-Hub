# Git Test 3
##Aidan Ray

Here is some random text to show that I know how to write in markdown:
**This stuff here should all be in bold**
You can also use markdown to quote code like `git push`
On this line I have decided to *italicize* the word *italicize*

In addition to just coding text, you can also put a bunch of it into its own block.
Here's a chunk of code from a previous xml assignment:
```
<exposition narrator="Jeralt">
<gtm img="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/HgY_hq45hj0/maxresdefault.jpg">
<title>Great Tree Moon</title>
<line>The icy winds of the <geo type="mount">Oghma Mountains</geo> have begun to scatter,</line>
<line>and the verdant fields once again spring to life across <continent name="Fodlan">FÃ³dlan</continent>,</line>
<line>heralding the start of a new year.</line>
<line>As they celebrate the dawning year, the people pray</line>
<line>that they may realize their full potential, just as a tiny sprout hopes to</line>
<line>one day grow into a great tree.</line>
</gtm>
```
