## **Space Theories**
I have a theory that somewhere
across the universe,
there is a planet just like ours
but their forests float on water,
their whales dance through the sky,
there are twice the amount of stars
visible from their skies,
and the peole there were given the choice
to love or live forever
and still, still
every single one of them chose love

## **N/A**
If you listen to them too long, your fears will
become the bricks with which you build your 
house. And houses built by fear only know 
how to do one thing. Collapse.
