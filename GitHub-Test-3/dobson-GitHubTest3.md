## HTML Code Block Key

I'll be listing here what is included within the **HTML** code block

* Background color change
* The div element
* Text and information

```
<html>
    <style>
div {
  width: 300px;
  margin: auto;
  background-color:Red;
</style>
        <title>GitHub Test Three </title>
    <body style="background-color:orange;">
        <div>
            <h2>Weird snail fact</h2>
            <p>Snails have rows of teeth on their tongues. A garden snail has about 14,000 teeth, but other species can have over 20,000. !</p>
        </div>
    </body>
</html>
