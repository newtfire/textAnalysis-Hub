# GitHub Test 3

Hello, and welcome to my markdown that I made for the third part of the GitHub Test!
Here, you will see that I have put up some headings, a list, as well as an XML code I wrote down.

## A bulleted list
For example, here are some of my favorite video games that I enjoy playing either by myself, with
my twin, Kayla, or my friends!

- Metroid
- Dance Dance Revolution
- Pokemon
- Super Smash Brothers Ultimate
- Hatsune Miku: Project Diva Future Tone
- League of Legends
- Jackbox Party Packs
- Mario Party

## My XML Code
As a proud DIGIT student, XML is one of my favorite coding techniques because it is easy to learn
and program your own text files, whether they are big or small. Below is an XML code that I wrote
down from scratch:

```

<root>
<introduction>My name is <name>Alyssa Hopple</name> and I am a <major>DIGIT</major> student at <school campus="Behrend">Penn State University</school>.</introduction>
This code block shows some <code>XML</code> that I <action>programmed</action> myself as it is one of the requirements for the third part of the
<assessment part="3">GitHub Test</assessment>.
<code>XML</code> is an interesting thing to do, isn't it? 
</root>

```

Thank you for reading this markdown file, and have a nice day!
