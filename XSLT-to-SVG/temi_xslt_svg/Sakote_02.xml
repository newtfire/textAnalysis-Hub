            <Step>Using an electric mixer, cream together the <ing ref="but">butter</ing> and
                <ing>sugar.</ing> </Step>
           <step> Then add the <ing>eggs</ing> and mix at medium speed until the
            mixture looks curdled.</step> 
            <step>Sift together dry ingredients and add at low speed until just
            combined.</step> 
            <step>Scoop and roll the dough by hand into 1-tbsp. balls, then pat flat.</step> [You could
            also refrigerate the dough until it’s firm enough to roll out on a flat surface and cut
            out into rounds.] 
            <step>Bake at 350F for 15-18 minutes (ours were about 1/3″ thick, so you
            could roll them thinner and have a slightly shorter cooking time) </step>
            <step>They’re done once they turn the slightest bit brown around the edges. This halved recipe yielded about two
            dozen cookies.</step>
