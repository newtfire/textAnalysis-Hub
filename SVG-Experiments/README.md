## SVG Experiments

Before saving your work in this directory, **be sure to check out a branch first** so we don't see merge conflicts! 

Create and checkout your own new  branch with `git checkout -b __yourBranchName__` but obviously replace the __yourBranchName__ with something realistic for you,  and you don't need the ___ characters.

Save your work, push the branch, and issue a pull request to complete the assignment.
