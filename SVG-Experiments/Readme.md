# SVG + Git Branching Exercise

Clone the textAnalysis-Hub repo.

Check out a branch with your name in it: e.g. besheroSVGBranch 

Copy your SVG folder here and rename it to include your initials, as in "ebb-SVG"

Commit and push to your branch.

Open a pull request to request someone else merge this to the main branch.

Remember to paste the link to your Pull Request in Canvas to complete the exercise.
