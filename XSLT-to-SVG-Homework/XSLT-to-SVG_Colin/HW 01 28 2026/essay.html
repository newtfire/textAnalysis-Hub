        <h2>Comparing GitHub v.s. WordPress</h2>
        <div style="line-height:1.25;">
            After I have prepared both of my websites using <b>GitHub &amp; WordPress</b>, I strongly prefer the GitHub code heavy version. The most significant change between the two sources is the interfaces. GitHub has a very technical interface, making it difficult for new learners. WordPress has a very friendly, and easy to navigate menu. While this may swing some users over to WordPress, I disagree. GitHub has many advantages over its counterpart. To start, GitHub is more widely used compared to WordPress. Getting used to GitHub is ultimately better for future coders. Even when video editing, I have downloaded templates for transitions from GitHub. And while it is more technical, it effectively taught me how to code better. 
            
            <br></br>Another reason I prefer GitHub is the challenges I faced through operating WordPress. Wordpress. I had to reword and upload my code into bits or the website would mess up. Also the images unfortunately have to be redone as well as my external websites don't seem to work. Besides that, for both websites it is necessary to learn patience and critical thinking. Patience for the amount of problems and troubleshooting you will have to do and critical thinking to solve these issues effectively. Finally, if I was to improve anything from this website, I would want to improve my CSS. I know HTML pretty decently just not how to style it nicely. Positioning images is difficult for me. Overall, I would continue with GitHub if given the choice.
