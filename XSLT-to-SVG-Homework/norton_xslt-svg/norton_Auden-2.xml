    <poem form="4x4">
        <stanza>
            <ln>Looking up at the stars,<cma/> I know quite well</ln>
            <ln>That,<cma/> for all they care,<cma/> I can go to hell,<cma/></ln>
            <ln>But on earth indifference is the least</ln>
            <ln>We have to dread from man or beast.<prd/></ln>
        </stanza>
        <stanza>
            <ln>How should we like it were stars to burn</ln>
            <ln>With a passion for us we could not return?<qsn/></ln>
            <ln>If equal affection cannot be,<cma/></ln>
            <ln>Let the more loving one be me.<prd/></ln>
        </stanza>
        <stanza>
            <ln>Admirer as I think I am</ln>
            <ln>Of stars that do not give a damn,<cma/></ln>
            <ln>I cannot,<cma/> now I see them,<cma/> say</ln>
            <ln>I missed one terribly all day.<prd/></ln>
        </stanza>
        <stanza>
            <ln>Were all stars to disappear or die,<cma/></ln>
            <ln>I should learn to look at an empty sky</ln>
            <ln>And feel its total dark sublime</ln>
            <ln>Though this might take me a little time.<prd/></ln>
