      <h1>The Oblivion Crisis</h1>
      <h2>by Praxis Sarcorum, Imperial Historian</h2>
      <h3>A summary of the events stemming from <strong>the assassination of <strong>Emperor Uriel Septim VII</strong></strong></h3>
      
      <section class="main">
         
         <p>At the turning of the Fourth Age, in the year 3E 433, <strong>the <strong>Emperor Uriel Septim VII</strong> was
               assassinated</strong> and <strong>the <strong>Amulet of Kings</strong>
               was destroyed</strong>. This set in motion a chain of events that would bring
            down an empire and change forever the relationship between man and the gods.</p>
         
         
         <p><strong>The <span class="faction">assassins</span> first attacked the
               <strong>Emperor</strong></strong> in the
            <em>White Gold Tower</em>. While the <span class="faction">Blades</span> held <span class="faction">them</span> back,
            <strong>the <strong>Emperor</strong> made <strong>his</strong> way down to the
               <em>dungeons</em></strong>, to a <em>secret escape
               route</em> built into <em>one of the prison cells</em>. For
            reasons known only to <strong>himself</strong>, the <strong>Emperor</strong>
            <strong>pardoned the fortunate <strong>prisoner</strong></strong> in that <em>cell</em>. Some say the
            <strong>prisoner</strong> reminded <strong>him</strong> of a childhood friend. Others say it was a <strong>moment of
               prophecy</strong>. Whatever the case, the <strong>prisoner</strong> came to play a fateful role in the history of the
            <em>Empire</em> and <em>Tamriel</em> - surely a sign that
            the gods themselves were at work.</p>
         
         
         <p>The pursuing <strong><span class="faction">assassins</span> killed the
               <span class="faction">Blades</span> bodyguards</strong> in a relentless
            series of sneak attacks. Eventually <strong><span class="faction">they</span>
               struck down the <strong>Emperor</strong>
               <strong>himself</strong></strong>. Before <strong>he</strong> fell, <strong><strong>Uriel Septim VII</strong> gave the <strong>Amulet of Kings</strong> to
               the <strong>prisoner</strong></strong>, who somehow
            <strong>made it out of the <em>Imperial sewers</em></strong> and
            into the light of day.</p>
         
         
         <p>The assassination is now known to have been the work of a group of <span class="faction">daedric cultists</span> known as the <span class="faction">Mythic Dawn</span>. (Those who still suspect the <span class="faction">Dark Brotherhood</span> should consider two facts: first, they would have only
            needed a single assassin, not a small army of them; second, the <span class="faction">Dark Brotherhood</span> would never be so foolish as to
            <strong>effectively declare war on the Empire</strong> and thus ensure their
            complete destruction. Witness the eventual fate of the <span class="faction">Mythic
               Dawn</span>.)</p>
         
         
         
         
         <p>The <strong>Amulet of Kings</strong> next surfaced at <em>Weynon
               Priory</em> near <em>Chorrol</em>. <strong>Jauffre</strong>, secret Grandmaster of the
            <span class="faction">Blades</span> and head of the
            <em>priory</em>, <strong>took possession of the
               <strong>amulet</strong></strong>. <strong>The <strong>messenger</strong> was sent off to <em>Kvatch</em></strong> to find a lowly <strong>priest</strong> named <strong>Martin</strong>.
            Unbeknownst even to <strong>himself</strong>, <strong>Martin</strong> was the bastard son of <strong>Uriel Septim VII</strong>, and the last heir to the Ruby
            Throne. <strong>He</strong> alone could use the
            <strong>Amulet of Kings</strong> to light the Dragonfires that wards the
            barrier between <em>Tamriel</em> and <em>Oblivion</em>, and save
            the world from the <span class="faction">Mythic Dawn</span> plot.</p>
         
         
         <p><strong>The <strong>prisoner</strong> arrived at <em>Kvatch</em></strong> to find <em>it</em> overrun by <span class="faction">daedra</span> that had poured in
            from a newly-opened Oblivion Gate, the start of the Empire-spanning devastation of
            the
            Oblivion Crisis. How <strong>the <strong>prisoner</strong> closed
               the gate</strong> is not recorded. Once closed, <strong>Martin</strong> and the surviving <em>Kvatch</em>
            <span class="faction">guardsmen</span> drove back the <span class="faction">daedra</span>.</p>
         
         
         <p>Now known as the Hero of <em>Kvatch</em>, <strong>the <strong>prisoner</strong> and <strong>Martin</strong>
               returned to <em>Weynon Priory</em></strong>, only to find the
            <em>priory</em> sacked and the <strong>Amulet</strong> taken.
            <strong>Jauffre</strong> survived the attack, however, and
            <strong>the <strong>three of them</strong>
               made their way to <em>Cloud Ruler Temple</em></strong>, bastion of
            the <span class="faction">Blades</span>. This secret <em>fortress</em> in
            the <em>mountains</em> outside <em>Bruma</em> is
            where <strong>Martin</strong> was held safe while
            <strong>the Hero of <em>Kvatch</em> searched for the lost
               <strong>Amulet</strong></strong>.</p>
         
         
         <p>Knowing only that a mysterious group called the <span class="faction">Mythic
               Dawn</span> was behind the <strong>assassination and theft of the
               <strong>Amulet</strong></strong>, <strong>the Hero of <em>Kvatch</em> was sent to locate
               the <span class="faction">cult</span></strong>. With the help of
            <strong>Baurus</strong>, a <span class="faction">Blade</span> in the
            service of the <strong>Emperor</strong>, <strong>they</strong> somehow <strong>used the
               <strong>Commentaries on the Mysterium Xarxes</strong></strong>,
            esoteric works by the madman <strong>Mankar Camoran</strong>,
            to direct <strong>them</strong> to the <span class="faction">Mythic Dawn</span>'s secret <em>lair</em>. Scholars
            familiar with the <strong>Commentaries</strong> claim the location is not directly
            mentioned in <strong>them</strong>. How <strong>they</strong> did this remains a mystery.</p>
         
         
         <p>No official records exist of how <strong>the Hero of
               <em>Kvatch</em> penetrated the <span class="faction">Mythic Dawn</span>'s <em>lair</em></strong>
            near <em>Lake Arrius</em>. There is a bardic tale that claims the <strong>Hero</strong> used <strong>trickery and disguise</strong>, but
            that is just speculation.What was discovered there is that <strong>Mankar Camoran</strong> was behind the <span class="faction">Mythic Dawn</span>, and that the <span class="faction">group</span> worshiped the daedric prince <strong>Mehrunes Dagon</strong>. <strong>Mankar
               Camoran</strong> believed <strong>himself</strong> to
            be a direct descendant of the <strong>Camoran Usurper</strong>, the infamous
            pretender to the throne of <em>Valenwood</em>.</p>
         
         
         <p>Somehow <strong>the <strong>Hero</strong> escaped with the
               <strong>Mysterium Xarxes itself</strong></strong>, the holy book of
            the <span class="faction">Mythic Dawn cult</span>. <strong>Mankar Camoran</strong> fled to <em>Oblivion</em> with the
            <strong>Amulet of Kings</strong>. With some effort and great risk to
            <strong>his</strong> sanity, <strong><strong>Martin</strong> deciphered the Mysterium
               Xarxes</strong> and intended to use <strong>it</strong> to open a gateway
            to <strong>Mankar Camoran</strong> in order to recover the
            <strong>Amulet of Kings</strong>.</p>
         
         
         <p>Before <strong>Martin</strong> could perform the ritual
            to open the gateway, <strong><strong>Mehrunes
                  Dagon</strong> opened an Oblivion Gate outside <em>Bruma</em></strong>. <strong>The Hero of
               <em>Kvatch</em> saved the <em>city</em> and <strong>Martin</strong>
               by entering the gate and closing it</strong> before a <span class="faction">daedric siege engine</span> could destroy <em>Bruma</em>
            and <em>Cloud Ruler Temple</em>. Many songs and stories have been told of
            this battle and I will not retell them here. The Hero of <em>Kvatch</em> was now also known as the Savior of <em>Bruma</em>.</p>
         
         
         <p>With the <em>city</em> and <em>Cloud Ruler
               Temple</em> safe, <strong><strong>Martin</strong>
               opened the portal to <strong>Mankar Camoran</strong>'s
               "<em>Paradise</em>"</strong>. The details of what transpired in
            this <em>place</em> have not been recorded. All that is known is that
            <strong>the Savior of <em>Bruma</em> travelled to this <em>Paradise</em>,
               killed <strong>Mankar Camoran</strong>, and returned with
               the <strong>Amulet of Kings</strong></strong>.</p>
         
         
         <p>With the <strong>Amulet</strong> in hand, <strong><strong>Martin Septim</strong> presented <strong>himself</strong> to the <span class="faction">Elder
                  Council</span> to be crowned Emperor of all
               <em>Tamriel</em></strong>. Once crowned <strong>he</strong> planned to relight the Dragonfires and seal
            <em>Tamriel</em> from <em>Oblivion</em>. In a last-ditch
            attempt to stop <strong>him</strong>, <strong><strong>Mehrunes Dagon</strong> launched an assault on the
               <em>Imperial City</em>, opening several Oblivion Gates
               within the <em>capital</em> itself</strong>. Uncrowned,
            <strong>Martin</strong> joined the battle in the <em>city streets</em>.</p>
         
         
         <p><strong><strong>Mehrunes Dagon himself</strong>
               left <em>Oblivion</em> and entered
               <em>Tamriel</em></strong>, breaking the covenant. Only the unlit
            Dragonfires allowed this to be possible. Now that the barrier was ripped asunder,
            it was
            too late to relighting the Fires. <strong>Martin
               Septim</strong> chose to make the ultimate sacrifice - <strong><strong>he</strong> shattered the <strong>Amulet of
                  Kings</strong> to become the <strong>avatar of the god
                  Akatosh</strong> and do battle with <strong>Mehrunes
                  Dagon</strong></strong>.</p>
         
         
         <p>Records of this battle vary wildly. What we do know is that
            <strong><strong>Mehrunes Dagon</strong> was
               defeated and sent back to <em>Oblivion</em></strong>.
            <strong>The <strong>avatar of Akatosh</strong> was
               turned to stone</strong> and can be seen to this day in the <em>Temple of
               the One</em> in the <em>Imperial City</em>. With the
            <strong>Amulet</strong> gone, the Dragonfires quenched, and the last
            Dragonblood Emperor dead, the barrier to <em>Oblivion</em> is sealed
            forever.</p>
